This book makes JavaScript less challenging to learn for newcomers by offering a modern view that is as consistent as possible. Highlights:    Get started quickly by initially focusing on modern features.   Test-driven exercises and quizzes available for most chapters.   Covers all essential features of JavaScript, up to and including ES2021.   Optional advanced sections let you dig deeper.  No prior knowledge of JavaScript is required, but you should know how to program.  15   16  1 Before you buy the book  1.1.2 What is not covered by this book?    Some advanced language features are not explained, but references to appropri- ate material are provided – for example, to my other JavaScript books at Explor- ingJS.com, which are free to read online.    This book deliberately focuses on the language. Browser-only features, etc. are  not described.  Isn’t this book too long for impatient people?  1.1.3 There are several ways in which you can read this book. One of them involves skipping much of the content in order to get started quickly. For details, see §2.1.1 “In which order should I read the content in this book?”.  1.2 Previewing and buying this book 1.2.1 How can I preview the book, the exercises, and the quizzes?

You can use it to get started with JavaScript as quickly as possible. This “mode” is  for impatient people:  19   20  2 FAQ: book and supplementary material  – Start reading with §8 “Using JavaScript: the big picture”. – Skip all chapters and sections marked as “advanced”, and all quick refer-  ences.    It gives you a comprehensive look at current JavaScript. In this “mode”, you read  everything and don’t skip advanced content and quick references.    It serves as a reference. If there is a topic that you are interested in, you can ﬁnd information on it via the table of contents or via the index. Due to basic and ad- vanced content being mixed, everything you need is usually in a single location. The quizzes and exercises play an important part in helping you practice and retain what you have learned.  2.1.2 Why are some chapters and sections marked with “ advanced ”? Several chapters and sections are marked with “ advanced ”. The idea is that you can initially skip them. That is, you can get a quick working knowledge of JavaScript by only reading the basic  non-advanced  content. As your knowledge evolves, you can later come back to some or all of the advanced content.  2.1.3 Why are some chapters marked with “ bonus ”? The bonus chapters are only available in the paid versions of this book  print and ebook . They are listed in the full table of contents.  I own a digital version  2.2 2.2.1 How do I submit feedback and corrections? The HTML version of this book  online, or ad-free archive in the paid version  has a link at the end of each chapter that enables you to give feedback.  2.2.2 How do I get updates for the downloads I bought at Payhip?    The receipt email for the purchase includes a link. You’ll always be able to down-  load the latest version of the ﬁles at that location.    If you opted into emails while buying, you’ll get an email whenever there is new  content. To opt in later, you must contact Payhip  see bottom of payhip.com .  2.2.3 Can I upgrade from package “Ebooks” to package “Ebooks + ex-  ercises + quizzes”?  Yes. The instructions for doing so are on the homepage of this book.   I own the print version  2.3 I own the print version 2.3 2.3.1 Can I get a discount for a digital version? If you bought the print version, you can get a discount for a digital version. The home- page of the print version explains how. Alas, the reverse is not possible: you cannot get a discount for the print version if you bought a digital version.  21  2.3.2 Can I submit an error or see submitted errors? On the homepage of the print version, you can submit errors and see submitted errors.  Is there an online list with the URLs in this book?  2.3.3 The homepage of the print version has a list with all the URLs that you see in the footnotes of the print version.  2.4 Notations and conventions 2.4.1 What is a type signature? Why am I seeing static types in this  book?  For example, you may see:  Number.isFinite num: number : boolean  That is called the type signature of Number.isFinite  . This notation, especially the static types number of num and boolean of the result, are not real JavaScript. The notation is borrowed from the compile-to-JavaScript language TypeScript  which is mostly just JavaScript plus static typing . Why is this notation being used? It helps give you a quick idea of how a function works. The notation is explained in detail in “Tackling TypeScript”, but is usually relatively in- tuitive.  2.4.2 What do the notes with icons mean?  Reading instructions  Explains how to best read the content.  External content  Points to additional, external, content.   22  Tip  Gives a tip related to the current content.  2 FAQ: book and supplementary material  Question  Asks and answers a question pertinent to the current content  think FAQ .

For more information, consult §5.2 “Standardizing JavaScript”.  3.1 The cons of JavaScript Among programmers, JavaScript isn’t always well liked. One reason is that it has a fair amount of quirks. Some of them are just unusual ways of doing something. Others are considered bugs. Either way, learning why JavaScript does something the way it does, helps with dealing with the quirks and with accepting JavaScript  maybe even liking it . Hopefully, this book can be of assistance here. Additionally, many traditional quirks have been eliminated now. For example:    Traditionally, JavaScript variables weren’t block-scoped. ES6 introduced let and  const, which let you declare block-scoped variables.    Prior to ES6, implementing object factories and inheritance via function and .pro- totype was clumsy. ES6 introduced classes, which provide more convenient syn- tax for these mechanisms.  23     Traditionally, JavaScript did not have built-in modules. ES6 added them to the  3 Why JavaScript?  bonus   24  language.  Lastly, JavaScript’s standard library is limited, but:   There are plans for adding more functionality.   Many libraries are easily available via the npm software registry.  3.2 The pros of JavaScript On the plus side, JavaScript offers many beneﬁts.  3.2.1 Community JavaScript’s popularity means that it’s well supported and well documented. Whenever you create something in JavaScript, you can rely on many people being  potentially  in- terested. And there is a large pool of JavaScript programmers from which you can hire, if you need to. No single party controls JavaScript – it is evolved by TC39, a committee comprising many organizations. The language is evolved via an open process that encourages feedback from the public.  3.2.2 Practically useful With JavaScript, you can write apps for many client platforms. These are a few example technologies:    Progressive Web Apps can be installed natively on Android and many desktop op-    Electron lets you build cross-platform desktop apps.   React Native lets you write apps for iOS and Android that have native user inter-  erating systems.  faces.    Node.js provides extensive support for writing shell scripts  in addition to being a  platform for web servers .  JavaScript is supported by many server platforms and services – for example:    Node.js  many of the following services are based on Node.js or support its APIs    ZEIT Now   Microsoft Azure Functions   AWS Lambda   Google Cloud Functions  There are many data technologies available for JavaScript: many databases support it and intermediate layers  such as GraphQL  exist. Additionally, the standard data format JSON  JavaScript Object Notation  is based on JavaScript and supported by its standard library. Lastly, many, if not most, tools for JavaScript are written in JavaScript. That includes IDEs, build tools, and more. As a consequence, you install them the same way you install your libraries and you can customize them in JavaScript.   3.3 Pro and con of JavaScript: innovation  3.2.3 Language  25    Many libraries are available, via the de-facto standard in the JavaScript universe,  the npm software registry.  tures:    If you are unhappy with “plain” JavaScript, it is relatively easy to add more fea-  – You can compile future and modern language features to current and past  versions of JavaScript, via Babel.  – You can add static typing, via TypeScript and Flow. – You can work with ReasonML, which is, roughly, OCaml with JavaScript  syntax. It can be compiled to JavaScript or native code.    The language is ﬂexible: it is dynamic and supports both object-oriented program-  ming and functional programming.    JavaScript has become suprisingly fast for such a dynamic language.  – Whenever it isn’t fast enough, you can switch to WebAssembly, a universal virtual machine built into most JavaScript engines. It can run static code at nearly native speeds.  3.3 Pro and con of JavaScript: innovation There is much innovation in the JavaScript ecosystem: new approaches to implementing user interfaces, new ways of optimizing the delivery of software, and more. The upside is that you will constantly learn new things. The downside is that the constant change can be exhausting at times. Thankfully, things have somewhat slowed down, recently: all of ES6  which was a considerable modernization of the language  is becoming established, as are certain tools and workﬂows.

Self inspired JavaScript’s prototypal inheritance.   Closures and environments were borrowed from Scheme.   AWK inﬂuenced JavaScript’s functions  including the keyword function .   JavaScript’s strings, Arrays, and regular expressions take cues from Perl.   HyperTalk inspired event handling via onclick in web browsers.  With ECMAScript 6, new inﬂuences came to JavaScript:    Generators were borrowed from Python.   The syntax of arrow functions came from CoffeeScript.   C++ contributed the keyword const.   Destructuring was inspired by Lisp’s destructuring bind.   Template literals came from the E language  where they are called quasi literals .  4.2 The nature of JavaScript These are a few traits of the language:    Its syntax is part of the C family of languages  curly braces, etc. .  27   28  4 The nature of JavaScript  bonus     It is a dynamic language: most objects can be changed in various ways at runtime,  objects can be created directly, etc.    It is a dynamically typed language: variables don’t have ﬁxed static types and you  can assign any value to a given  mutable  variable.    It has functional programming features: ﬁrst-class functions, closures, partial ap-  plication via bind  , etc.    It has object-oriented features: mutable state, objects, inheritance, classes, etc.   It often fails silently: see the next subsection for details.   It is deployed as source code. But that source code is often miniﬁed  rewritten to  require less storage . And there are plans for a binary source code format.    JavaScript is part of the web platform – it is the language built into web browsers. But it is also used elsewhere – for example, in Node.js, for server things, and shell scripting.    JavaScript engines often optimize less-efﬁcient language mechanisms under the hood. For example, in principle, JavaScript Arrays are dictionaries. But under the hood, engines store Arrays contiguously if they have contiguous indices.  JavaScript often fails silently  4.2.1 JavaScript often fails silently. Let’s look at two examples. First example: If the operands of an operator don’t have the appropriate types, they are converted as necessary.  Second example: If an arithmetic computation fails, you get an error value, not an excep- tion.  > '3' * '5' 15  > 1   0 Infinity  The reason for the silent failures is historical: JavaScript did not have exceptions until ECMAScript 3. Since then, its designers have tried to avoid silent failures.  4.3 Tips for getting started with JavaScript These are a few tips to help you get started with JavaScript:    Take your time to really get to know this language. The conventional C-style syn- tax hides that this is a very unconventional language. Learn especially the quirks and the rationales behind them. Then you will understand and appreciate the lan- guage better.  – In addition to details, this book also teaches simple rules of thumb to be safe – for example, “Always use === to determine if two values are equal, never ==.”   4.3 Tips for getting started with JavaScript  29    Language tools make it easier to work with JavaScript. For example:  – You can statically type JavaScript via TypeScript or Flow. – You can check for problems and anti-patterns via linters such as ESLint. – You can format your code automatically via code formatters such as Prettier.    Get in contact with the community:  – Twitter is popular among JavaScript programmers. As a mode of communi- cation that sits between the spoken and the written word, it is well suited for exchanging knowledge.  – Many cities have regular free meetups where people come together to learn  topics related to JavaScript.  – JavaScript conferences are another convenient way of meeting other  JavaScript programmers.

Eich worked at Netscape and implemented JavaScript for their web browser, Netscape Navigator. The idea was that major interactive parts of the client-side web were to be implemented in Java. JavaScript was supposed to be a glue language for those parts and to also make HTML slightly more interactive. Given its role of assisting Java, JavaScript had to look like Java. That ruled out existing solutions such as Perl, Python, TCL, and others. Initially, JavaScript’s name changed several times:    Its code name was Mocha.   In the Netscape Navigator 2.0 betas  September 1995 , it was called LiveScript.   In Netscape Navigator 2.0 beta 3  December 1995 , it got its ﬁnal name, JavaScript.  31   32 5.2 Standardizing JavaScript There are two standards for JavaScript:  5 History and evolution of JavaScript    ECMA-262 is hosted by Ecma International. It is the primary standard.   ISO IEC 16262 is hosted by the International Organization for Standardization  ISO  and the International Electrotechnical Commission  IEC . This is a secondary standard.  The language described by these standards is called ECMAScript, not JavaScript. A differ- ent name was chosen because Sun  now Oracle  had a trademark for the latter name. The “ECMA” in “ECMAScript” comes from the organization that hosts the primary standard.  The original name of that organization was ECMA, an acronym for European Computer Manufacturers Association. It was later changed to Ecma International  with “Ecma” be- ing a proper name, not an acronym  because the organization’s activities had expanded beyond Europe. The initial all-caps acronym explains the spelling of ECMAScript. In principle, JavaScript and ECMAScript mean the same thing. Sometimes the following distinction is made:    The term JavaScript refers to the language and its implementations.   The term ECMAScript refers to the language standard and language versions.  Therefore, ECMAScript 6 is a version of the language  its 6th edition .  5.3 Timeline of ECMAScript versions This is a brief timeline of ECMAScript versions:  standard.    ECMAScript 1  June 1997 : First version of the standard.   ECMAScript 2  June 1998 : Small update to keep ECMA-262 in sync with the ISO    ECMAScript 3  December 1999 : Adds many core features – “[…] regular expres- sions, better string handling, new control statements [do-while, switch], try catch exception handling, […]”    ECMAScript 4  abandoned in July 2008 : Would have been a massive upgrade  with static typing, modules, namespaces, and more , but ended up being too am- bitious and dividing the language’s stewards.    ECMAScript 5  December 2009 : Brought minor improvements – a few standard    ECMAScript 5.1  June 2011 : Another small update to keep Ecma and ISO stan-  library features and strict mode.  dards in sync.    ECMAScript 6  June 2015 : A large update that fulﬁlled many of the promises of ECMAScript 4. This version is the ﬁrst one whose ofﬁcial name – ECMAScript 2015 – is based on the year of publication.    ECMAScript 2016  June 2016 : First yearly release. The shorter release life cycle  resulted in fewer new features compared to the large ES6.    ECMAScript 2017  June 2017 . Second yearly release.   Subsequent ECMAScript versions  ES2018, etc.  are always ratiﬁed in June.   33  5.4 Ecma Technical Committee 39  TC39  5.4 Ecma Technical Committee 39  TC39  TC39 is the committee that evolves JavaScript. Its member are, strictly speaking, compa- nies: Adobe, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, Opera, Twitter, and others. That is, companies that are usually ﬁerce competitors are working together for the good of the language. Every two months, TC39 has meetings that member-appointed delegates and invited experts attend. The minutes of those meetings are public in a GitHub repository.  5.5 The TC39 process With ECMAScript 6, two issues with the release process used at that time became obvi- ous:    If too much time passes between releases then features that are ready early, have to wait a long time until they can be released. And features that are ready late, risk being rushed to make the deadline.    Features were often designed long before they were implemented and used. De- sign deﬁciencies related to implementation and use were therefore discovered too late.  In response to these issues, TC39 instituted the new TC39 process:    ECMAScript features are designed independently and go through stages, starting  at 0  “strawman” , ending at 4  “ﬁnished” .    Especially the later stages require prototype implementations and real-world test-  ing, leading to feedback loops between designs and implementations.    ECMAScript versions are released once per year and include all features that have  reached stage 4 prior to a release deadline.  The result: smaller, incremental releases, whose features have already been ﬁeld-tested. Fig. 5.1 illustrates the TC39 process. ES2016 was the ﬁrst ECMAScript version that was designed according to the TC39 pro- cess.  5.5.1 Tip: Think in individual features and stages, not ECMAScript  versions  Up to and including ES6, it was most common to think about JavaScript in terms of ECMAScript versions – for example, “Does this browser support ES6 yet?” Starting with ES2016, it’s better to think in individual features: once a feature reaches stage 4, you can safely use it  if it’s supported by the JavaScript engines you are targeting . You don’t have to wait until the next ECMAScript release.   34  5 History and evolution of JavaScript  Figure 5.1: Each ECMAScript feature proposal goes through stages that are numbered from 0 to 4. Champions are TC39 members that support the authors of a feature. Test 262 is a suite of tests that checks JavaScript engines for compliance with the language speciﬁcation.  Review at TC39 meeting  Stage 0: strawman  Sketch  Pick champions  Stage 1: proposal  TC39 helps  First spec text, 2 implementations  Stage 2: draft  Spec complete  Likely to be standardized  Stage 3: candidate  Done, needs feedback from implementations  Test 262 acceptance tests  Stage 4: ﬁnished  Ready for standardization   5.6 FAQ: TC39 process 5.6 FAQ: TC39 process 5.6.1 How is [my favorite proposed feature] doing? If you are wondering what stages various proposed features are in, consult the GitHub repository proposals.  35  Is there an ofﬁcial list of ECMAScript features?  5.6.2 Yes, the TC39 repo lists ﬁnished proposals and mentions in which ECMAScript versions they were introduced.  5.7 Evolving JavaScript: Don’t break the web One idea that occasionally comes up is to clean up JavaScript by removing old features and quirks. While the appeal of that idea is obvious, it has signiﬁcant downsides. Let’s assume we create a new version of JavaScript that is not backward compatible and ﬁx all of its ﬂaws. As a result, we’d encounter the following problems:    JavaScript engines become bloated: they need to support both the old and the new  version. The same is true for tools such as IDEs and build tools.    Programmers need to know, and be continually conscious of, the differences be-  tween the versions.    You can either migrate all of an existing code base to the new version  which can be a lot of work . Or you can mix versions and refactoring becomes harder because you can’t move code between versions without changing it.    You somehow have to specify per piece of code – be it a ﬁle or code embedded in a web page – what version it is written in. Every conceivable solution has pros and cons. For example, strict mode is a slightly cleaner version of ES5. One of the reasons why it wasn’t as popular as it should have been: it was a hassle to opt in via a directive at the beginning of a ﬁle or a function.  So what is the solution? Can we have our cake and eat it? The approach that was chosen for ES6 is called “One JavaScript”:    New versions are always completely backward compatible  but there may occa-  sionally be minor, hardly noticeable clean-ups .    Old features aren’t removed or ﬁxed. Instead, better versions of them are intro- duced. One example is declaring variables via let – which is an improved version of var.    If aspects of the language are changed, it is done inside new syntactic constructs. That is, you opt in implicitly. For example, yield is only a keyword inside gen- erators  which were introduced in ES6 . And all code inside modules and classes  both introduced in ES6  is implicitly in strict mode.

This book teaches the JavaScript language. It focuses on just the language, but offers occasional glimpses at two platforms where JavaScript can be used:    Web browser   Node.js  Node.js is important for web development in three ways:    You can use it to write server-side software in JavaScript.   You can also use it to write software for the command line  think Unix shell, Win- dows PowerShell, etc. . Many JavaScript-related tools are based on  and executed via  Node.js.    Node’s software registry, npm, has become the dominant way of installing tools  such as compilers and build tools  and libraries – even for client-side develop- ment.  8.2 The structure of browsers and Node.js The structures of the two JavaScript platforms web browser and Node.js are similar  ﬁg. 8.1 :  45   46  8 Using JavaScript: the big picture  Figure 8.1: The structure of the two JavaScript platforms web browser and Node.js. The APIs “standard library” and “platform API” are hosted on top of a foundational layer with a JavaScript engine and a platform-speciﬁc “core”.    The foundational layer consists of the JavaScript engine and platform-speciﬁc  “core” functionality.    Two APIs are hosted on top of this foundation:  – The JavaScript standard library is part of JavaScript proper and runs on top  of the engine.  platform-speciﬁc functionality. For example:  – The platform API are also available from JavaScript – it provides access to * In browsers, you need to use the platform-speciﬁc API if you want to do anything related to the user interface: react to mouse clicks, play sounds, etc. * In Node.js, the platform-speciﬁc API lets you read and write ﬁles, down- load data via HTTP, etc.  JavaScript references  8.3 When you have a question about a JavaScript, a web search usually helps. I can recom- mend the following online sources:    MDN web docs: cover various web technologies such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript,  and more. An excellent reference.

Don’t worry if some things don’t make sense, yet. They will all be explained in more detail later in this book. This overview is not exhaustive, either. It focuses on the essentials.  9.1.1 Basic constructs 9.1.1.1 Comments     single-line comment   * Comment with multiple lines *   9.1.1.2 Primitive  atomic  values Booleans:  true false Numbers: 1.141 -123  The basic number type is used for both ﬂoating point numbers  doubles  and integers. Bigints: 17n -49n  The basic number type can only properly represent integers within a range of 53 bits plus sign. Bigints can grow arbitrarily large in size. Strings: 'abc' "abc" `String with interpolated values: ${256} and ${true}`  JavaScript has no extra type for characters. It uses strings to represent them.   9.1 An overview of JavaScript’s syntax  49  9.1.1.3 Assertions An assertion describes what the result of a computation is expected to look like and throws an exception if those expectations aren’t correct. For example, the following assertion states that the result of the computation 7 plus 1 must be 8:  assert.equal 7 + 1, 8 ;  assert.equal   is a method call  the object is assert, the method is .equal    with two arguments: the actual result and the expected result. It is part of a Node.js assertion API that is explained later in this book. There is also assert.deepEqual   that compares objects deeply.  9.1.1.4 Logging to the console Logging to the console of a browser or Node.js:     Printing a value to standard out  another method call  console.log 'Hello!' ;     Printing error information to standard error console.error 'Something went wrong!' ;  9.1.1.5 Operators     Operators for booleans assert.equal true && false, false ;    And assert.equal true  false, true ;    Or     Operators for numbers assert.equal 3 + 4, 7 ; assert.equal 5 - 1, 4 ; assert.equal 3 * 4, 12 ; assert.equal 10   4, 2.5 ;     Operators for bigints assert.equal 3n + 4n, 7n ; assert.equal 5n - 1n, 4n ; assert.equal 3n * 4n, 12n ; assert.equal 10n   4n, 2n ;     Operators for strings assert.equal 'a' + 'b', 'ab' ; assert.equal 'I see ' + 3 + ' monkeys', 'I see 3 monkeys' ;     Comparison operators assert.equal 3 < 4, true ; assert.equal 3 <= 4, true ; assert.equal 'abc' === 'abc', true ; assert.equal 'abc' !== 'def', true ;   50  9 Syntax  JavaScript also has a == comparison operator. I recommend to avoid it – why is explained in §15.4.3 “Recommendation: always use strict equality”.  9.1.1.6 Declaring variables const creates immutable variable bindings: Each variable must be initialized immediately and we can’t assign a different value later. However, the value itself may be mutable and we may be able to change its contents. In other words: const does not make values immutable.     Declaring and initializing x  immutable binding : const x = 8;     Would cause a TypeError:    x = 9;  let creates mutable variable bindings:     Declaring y  mutable binding : let y;     We can assign a different value to y: y = 3 * 5;     Declaring and initializing z: let z = 3 * 5;  9.1.1.7 Ordinary function declarations     add1   has the parameters a and b function add1 a, b  {  return a + b;  }    Calling function add1   assert.equal add1 5, 2 , 7 ;  9.1.1.8 Arrow function expressions Arrow function expressions are used especially as arguments of function calls and method calls:  const add2 =  a, b  => { return a + b };    Calling function add2   assert.equal add2 5, 2 , 7 ;     Equivalent to add2: const add3 =  a, b  => a + b;  The previous code contains the following two arrow functions  the terms expression and statement are explained later in this chapter :   9.1 An overview of JavaScript’s syntax  51     An arrow function whose body is a code block  a, b  => { return a + b }     An arrow function whose body is an expression  a, b  => a + b  9.1.1.9 Plain objects     Creating a plain object via an object literal const obj = {  first: 'Jane',    property last: 'Doe',    property getFullName   {    property  method   return this.first + ' ' + this.last;  },  };     Getting a property value assert.equal obj.first, 'Jane' ;    Setting a property value obj.first = 'Janey';     Calling the method assert.equal obj.getFullName  , 'Janey Doe' ;  9.1.1.10 Arrays     Creating an Array via an Array literal const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; assert.equal arr.length, 3 ;     Getting an Array element assert.equal arr[1], 'b' ;    Setting an Array element arr[1] = 'β';     Adding an element to an Array: arr.push 'd' ;  assert.deepEqual   arr, ['a', 'β', 'c', 'd'] ;  9.1.1.11 Control ﬂow statements Conditional statement:  if  x < 0  {  x = -x;  }   9 Syntax  52  for-of loop:  }    Output:    'a'    'b'  const arr = ['a', 'b']; for  const element of arr  {  console.log element ;  9.1.2 Modules Each module is a single ﬁle. Consider, for example, the following two ﬁles with modules in them:  file-tools.mjs main.mjs  The module in file-tools.mjs exports its function isTextFilePath  :  export function isTextFilePath filePath  {  return filePath.endsWith '.txt' ;  }  The module in main.mjs imports the whole module path and the function is- TextFilePath  :     Import whole module as namespace object `path` import * as path from 'path';    Import a single export of module file-tools.mjs import {isTextFilePath} from '. file-tools.mjs';  9.1.3 Classes  class Person {  constructor name  { this.name = name;  } describe   {  return `Person named ${this.name}`;  } static logNames persons  {  for  const person of persons  {  console.log person.name ;  }  }  }  class Employee extends Person {  constructor name, title  {  super name ;   9.1 An overview of JavaScript’s syntax  53  this.title = title;  } describe   {  return super.describe   +  `  ${this.title} `;  }  }  const jane = new Employee 'Jane', 'CTO' ; assert.equal   jane.describe  , 'Person named Jane  CTO ' ;  9.1.4 Exception handling  function throwsException   {  throw new Error 'Problem!' ;  }  function catchesException   {  try {  throwsException  ;  } catch  err  {  assert.ok err instanceof Error ; assert.equal err.message, 'Problem!' ;  }  } Note:    try-finally and try-catch-finally are also supported.   We can throw any value, but features such as stack traces are only supported by  Error and its subclasses.  9.1.5 Legal variable and property names The grammatical category of variable names and property names is called identiﬁer. Identiﬁers are allowed to have the following characters:    Unicode letters: A–Z, a–z  etc.    $, _   Unicode digits: 0–9  etc.   – Variable names can’t start with a digit  Some words have special meaning in JavaScript and are called reserved. Examples in- clude: if, true, const. Reserved words can’t be used as variable names:  const if = 123;     SyntaxError: Unexpected token if   54  9 Syntax  But they are allowed as names of properties:  > const obj = { if: 123 }; > obj.if 123  9.1.6 Casing styles Common casing styles for concatenating words are:    Camel case: threeConcatenatedWords   Underscore case  also called snake case : three_concatenated_words   Dash case  also called kebab case : three-concatenated-words  9.1.7 Capitalization of names In general, JavaScript uses camel case, except for constants. Lowercase:    Functions, variables: myFunction   Methods: obj.myMethod   CSS:  – CSS entity: special-class – Corresponding JavaScript variable: specialClass  Uppercase:    Classes: MyClass   Constants: MY_CONSTANT  – Constants are also often written in camel case: myConstant  9.1.8 More naming conventions The following naming conventions are popular in JavaScript. If the name of a parameter starts with an underscore  or is an underscore  it means that this parameter is not used – for example:  arr.map  _x, i  => i   If the name of a property of an object starts with an underscore then that property is considered private:  class ValueWrapper {  constructor value  {  this._value = value;  }  }  9.1.9 Where to put semicolons? At the end of a statement:   55  But not if that statement ends with a curly brace:  9.2  Advanced   const x = 123; func  ;  while  false  {     ···  }    no semicolon  function func   {     ···  }    no semicolon     ···  };  Quiz: basic  See quiz app.  However, adding a semicolon after such a statement is not a syntax error – it is interpreted as an empty statement:     Function declaration followed by empty statement: function func   {    Unicode letter  including accented characters such as é and ü and characters from  non-latin alphabets, such as α    Advanced   9.2 All remaining sections of this chapter are advanced.  Identiﬁers  9.3 9.3.1 Valid identiﬁers  variable names, etc.  First character:    $   _  Subsequent characters:  Examples:  const ε = 0.0001; const строка = '';    Legal ﬁrst characters   Unicode digits  including Eastern Arabic numerals    Some other Unicode marks and punctuations   56  let _tmp = 0; const $foo2 = true;  9 Syntax  9.3.2 Reserved words Reserved words can’t be variable names, but they can be property names. All JavaScript keywords are reserved words:  await break case catch class const continue debugger default delete do else export extends finally for function if import in instanceof let new return static super switch this throw try typeof var void while with yield  The following tokens are also keywords, but currently not used in the language:  enum implements package protected interface private public  The following literals are reserved words:  true false null  Technically, these words are not reserved, but you should avoid them, too, because they effectively are keywords:  Infinity NaN undefined async  You shouldn’t use the names of global variables  String, Math, etc.  for your own vari- ables and parameters, either.  9.4 Statement vs. expression In this section, we explore how JavaScript distinguishes two kinds of syntactic constructs: statements and expressions. Afterward, we’ll see that that can cause problems because the same syntax can mean different things, depending on where it is used.  We pretend there are only statements and expressions  For the sake of simplicity, we pretend that there are only statements and expressions in JavaScript.  9.4.1 Statements A statement is a piece of code that can be executed and performs some kind of action. For example, if is a statement:  let myStr; if  myBool  {  myStr = 'Yes';  } else {  myStr = 'No';  }   9.4 Statement vs. expression  57  One more example of a statement: a function declaration.  function twice x  {  return x + x;  }  9.4.2 Expressions An expression is a piece of code that can be evaluated to produce a value. For example, the code between the parentheses is an expression: let myStr =  myBool ? 'Yes' : 'No' ;  The operator _?_:_ used between the parentheses is called the ternary operator. It is the expression version of the if statement. Let’s look at more examples of expressions. We enter expressions and the REPL evaluates them for us:  9.4.3 What is allowed where? The current location within JavaScript source code determines which kind of syntactic constructs you are allowed to use:    The body of a function must be a sequence of statements:  > 'ab' + 'cd' 'abcd' > Number '123'  123 > true  false true  function max x, y  {  if  x > y  { return x;  } else {  return y;  }  }    The arguments of a function call or a method call must be expressions:  console.log 'ab' + 'cd', Number '123'  ;  However, expressions can be used as statements. Then they are called expression state- ments. The opposite is not true: when the context requires an expression, you can’t use a statement. The following code demonstrates that any expression bar   can be either expression or statement – it depends on the context:  function f   {  console.log bar   ;    bar   is expression   bar  ;    bar  ; is  expression  statement  9 Syntax  9.5 Ambiguous syntax JavaScript has several programming constructs that are syntactically ambiguous: the same syntax is interpreted differently, depending on whether it is used in statement con- text or in expression context. This section explores the phenomenon and the pitfalls it causes.  9.5.1 Same syntax: function declaration and function expression A function declaration is a statement:  function id x  {  return x;  A function expression is an expression  right-hand side of = :  const id = function me x  {  return x;  9.5.2 Same syntax: object literal and block In the following code, {} is an object literal: an expression that creates an empty object.  const obj = {};  This is an empty code block  a statement :  58  }  }  };  { }  9.5.3 Disambiguation The ambiguities are only a problem in statement context: If the JavaScript parser en- counters ambiguous syntax, it doesn’t know if it’s a plain statement or an expression statement. For example:    If a statement starts with function: Is it a function declaration or a function ex-  pression?    If a statement starts with {: Is it an object literal or a code block?  To resolve the ambiguity, statements starting with function or { are never interpreted as expressions. If you want an expression statement to start with either one of these tokens, you must wrap it in parentheses:   function  x  { console.log x  }  'abc' ;   9.6 Semicolons     Output:    'abc' In this code:  59  1. We ﬁrst create a function via a function expression:  function  x  { console.log x  } 2. Then we invoke that function:  'abc'   The code fragment shown in  1  is only interpreted as an expression because we wrap it in parentheses. If we didn’t, we would get a syntax error because then JavaScript expects a function declaration and complains about the missing function name. Additionally, you can’t put a function call immediately after a function declaration. Later in this book, we’ll see more examples of pitfalls caused by syntactic ambiguity:    Assigning via object destructuring   Returning an object literal from an arrow function  9.6 Semicolons 9.6.1 Rule of thumb for semicolons Each statement is terminated by a semicolon:  const x = 3; someFunction 'abc' ; i++;  except statements ending with blocks:  function foo   {     ···  } if  y > 0  {     ···  }  The following case is slightly tricky:  const func =    => {};    semicolon!  The whole const declaration  a statement  ends with a semicolon, but inside it, there is an arrow function expression. That is, it’s not the statement per se that ends with a curly brace; it’s the embedded arrow function expression. That’s why there is a semicolon at the end.  9.6.2 Semicolons: control statements The body of a control statement is itself a statement. For example, this is the syntax of the while loop:   9 Syntax  60  while  condition   statement  The body can be a single statement:  while  a > 0  a--;  while  a > 0  {  a--;  }  while  processNextItem   > 0 ; Your second option is an empty block:  while  processNextItem   > 0  {}  But blocks are also statements and therefore legal bodies of control statements:  If you want a loop to have an empty body, your ﬁrst option is an empty statement  which is just a semicolon :  9.7 Automatic semicolon insertion  ASI  While I recommend to always write semicolons, most of them are optional in JavaScript. The mechanism that makes this possible is called automatic semicolon insertion  ASI . In a way, it corrects syntax errors. ASI works as follows. Parsing of a statement continues until there is either:    A semicolon   A line terminator followed by an illegal token  In other words, ASI can be seen as inserting semicolons at line breaks. The next subsec- tions cover the pitfalls of ASI.  9.7.1 ASI triggered unexpectedly The good news about ASI is that – if you don’t rely on it and always write semicolons – there is only one pitfall that you need to be aware of. It is that JavaScript forbids line breaks after some tokens. If you do insert a line break, a semicolon will be inserted, too. The token where this is most practically relevant is return. Consider, for example, the following code:  first: 'jane'  This code is parsed as:  return {  };  return; {  first: 'jane';   9.8 Semicolons: best practices  61  } ;  That is:    Return statement without operand: return;   Start of code block: {   Expression statement 'jane'; with label first:   End of code block: }   Empty statement: ;  Why does JavaScript do this? It protects against accidentally returning a value in a line after a return.  9.7.2 ASI unexpectedly not triggered In some cases, ASI is not triggered when you think it should be. That makes life more complicated for people who don’t like semicolons because they need to be aware of those cases. The following are three examples. There are more. Example 1: Unintended function call.  a = b + c  d + e .print    Parsed as:  a = b + c d + e .print  ; Example 2: Unintended division.  a = b  hi g.exec c .map d   Parsed as:  a = b   hi   g.exec c .map d ;  Example 3: Unintended property access.  someFunction   ['ul', 'ol'].map x => x + x   Executed as:  const propKey =  'ul','ol' ;    comma operator assert.equal propKey, 'ol' ;  someFunction  [propKey].map x => x + x ;  9.8 Semicolons: best practices I recommend that you always write semicolons:    I like the visual structure it gives code – you clearly see when a statement ends.   62  9 Syntax    There are less rules to keep in mind.   The majority of JavaScript programmers use semicolons.  However, there are also many people who don’t like the added visual clutter of semi- colons. If you are one of them: Code without them is legal. I recommend that you use tools to help you avoid mistakes. The following are two examples:    The automatic code formatter Prettier can be conﬁgured to not use semicolons. It then automatically ﬁxes problems. For example, if it encounters a line that starts with a square bracket, it preﬁxes that line with a semicolon.    The static checker ESLint has a rule that you tell your preferred style  always semi- colons or as few semicolons as possible  and that warns you about critical issues.  9.9 Strict mode vs. sloppy mode Starting with ECMAScript 5, JavaScript has two modes in which JavaScript can be exe- cuted:    Normal “sloppy” mode is the default in scripts  code fragments that are a precur-  sor to modules and supported by browsers .    Strict mode is the default in modules and classes, and can be switched on in scripts  how, is explained later . In this mode, several pitfalls of normal mode are removed and more exceptions are thrown.  You’ll rarely encounter sloppy mode in modern JavaScript code, which is almost always located in modules. In this book, I assume that strict mode is always switched on.  9.9.1 Switching on strict mode In script ﬁles and CommonJS modules, you switch on strict mode for a complete ﬁle, by putting the following code in the ﬁrst line:  'use strict';  The neat thing about this “directive” is that ECMAScript versions before 5 simply ignore it: it’s an expression statement that does nothing. You can also switch on strict mode for just a single function:  function functionInStrictMode   {  'use strict';  }  Improvements in strict mode  9.9.2 Let’s look at three things that strict mode does better than sloppy mode. Just in this one section, all code fragments are executed in sloppy mode.  9.9.2.1 Sloppy mode pitfall: changing an undeclared variable creates a global vari-  able  In non-strict mode, changing an undeclared variable creates a global variable.   9.9 Strict mode vs. sloppy mode  function sloppyFunc   { undeclaredVar1 = 123;  } sloppyFunc  ;    Created global variable `undeclaredVar1`: assert.equal undeclaredVar1, 123 ;  63  Strict mode does it better and throws a ReferenceError. That makes it easier to detect typos.  function strictFunc   {  'use strict'; undeclaredVar2 = 123;  } assert.throws      => strictFunc  , {  name: 'ReferenceError', message: 'undeclaredVar2 is not defined',  } ;  The assert.throws   states that its ﬁrst argument, a function, throws a ReferenceError when it is called.  9.9.2.2 Function declarations are block-scoped in strict mode, function-scoped in  sloppy mode  In strict mode, a variable created via a function declaration only exists within the inner- most enclosing block:  function strictFunc   {  'use strict'; {  function foo   { return 123 }  } return foo  ;    ReferenceError  } assert.throws      => strictFunc  , {  name: 'ReferenceError', message: 'foo is not defined',  } ;  {  function sloppyFunc   {  function foo   { return 123 }  } return foo  ;    works  In sloppy mode, function declarations are function-scoped:   64  9 Syntax  } assert.equal sloppyFunc  , 123 ;  9.9.2.3 Sloppy mode doesn’t throw exceptions when changing immutable data In strict mode, you get an exception if you try to change immutable data:  name: 'TypeError', message: "Cannot create property 'prop' on boolean 'true'",  function strictFunc   {  'use strict'; true.prop = 1;    TypeError  } assert.throws      => strictFunc  , {  } ;  In sloppy mode, the assignment fails silently:  function sloppyFunc   {  true.prop = 1;    fails silently return true.prop;  } assert.equal sloppyFunc  , undefined ;  Further reading: sloppy mode  For more information on how sloppy mode differs from strict mode, see MDN.

The following subsections describe a few of them.  10.1.1 Browser consoles Web browsers have so-called consoles: interactive command lines to which you can print text via console.log   and where you can run pieces of code. How to open the console differs from browser to browser. Fig. 10.1 shows the console of Google Chrome. To ﬁnd out how to open the console in your web browser, you can do a web search for “console «name-of-your-browser»”. These are pages for a few commonly used web browsers:    Apple Safari   Google Chrome   Microsoft Edge   Mozilla Firefox  65   66  10 Consoles: interactive JavaScript command lines  Figure 10.1: The console of the web browser “Google Chrome” is open  in the bottom half of window  while visiting a web page.   10.2 The console.* API: printing data and more  67  10.1.2 The Node.js REPL REPL stands for read-eval-print loop and basically means command line. To use it, you must ﬁrst start Node.js from an operating system command line, via the command node. Then an interaction with it looks as depicted in ﬁg. 10.2: The text after > is input from the user; everything else is output from Node.js.  Figure 10.2: Starting and using the Node.js REPL  interactive command line .  Reading: REPL interactions  I occasionally demonstrate JavaScript via REPL interactions. Then I also use greater- than symbols  >  to mark input – for example:  > 3 + 5 8  10.1.3 Other options Other options include:    There are many web apps that let you experiment with JavaScript in web browsers  – for example, Babel’s REPL.    There are also native apps and IDE plugins for running JavaScript.  Consoles often run in non-strict mode  In modern JavaScript, most code  e.g., modules  is executed in strict mode. How- ever, consoles often run in non-strict mode. Therefore, you may occasionally get slightly different results when using a console to execute code from this book.  10.2 The console.* API: printing data and more In browsers, the console is something you can bring up that is normally hidden. For Node.js, the console is the terminal that Node.js is currently running in.   68  10 Consoles: interactive JavaScript command lines  The full console.* API is documented on MDN web docs and on the Node.js website. It is not part of the JavaScript language standard, but much functionality is supported by both browsers and Node.js. In this chapter, we only look at the following two methods for printing data  “printing” means displaying in the console :  At the end, console.log   always prints a newline. Therefore, if you call it with zero arguments, it just prints a newline.    console.log     console.error    10.2.1 Printing values: console.log    stdout  There are two variants of this operation:  console.log ...values: any[] : void console.log pattern: string, ...values: any[] : void  10.2.1.1 Printing multiple values The ﬁrst variant prints  text representations of  values on the console:  console.log 'abc', 123, true ;    Output:    abc 123 true  10.2.1.2 Printing a string with substitutions The second variant performs string substitution: console.log 'Test: %s %j', 123, 'abc' ;    Output:    Test: 123 "abc"  These are some of the directives you can use for substitutions:    %s converts the corresponding value to a string and inserts it.  console.log '%s %s', 'abc', 123 ;    Output:    abc 123    %o inserts a string representation of an object.  console.log '%o', {foo: 123, bar: 'abc'} ;    Output:    { foo: 123, bar: 'abc' }    %j converts a value to a JSON string and inserts it.  console.log '%j', {foo: 123, bar: 'abc'} ;    Output:    {"foo":123,"bar":"abc"}   10.2 The console.* API: printing data and more  69    %% inserts a single %.  console.log '%s%%', 99 ;    Output:    99%  10.2.2 Printing error information: console.error    stderr  console.error   works the same as console.log  , but what it logs is considered error information. For Node.js, that means that the output goes to stderr instead of stdout on Unix.  10.2.3 Printing nested objects via JSON.stringify   JSON.stringify   is occasionally useful for printing nested objects:  console.log JSON.stringify {first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe'}, null, 2  ;  Output:  {  }  "first": "Jane", "last": "Doe"   70  10 Consoles: interactive JavaScript command lines   Chapter 11  Assertion API  Contents  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  11.1 Assertions in software development . 11.2 How assertions are used in this book .  . . 11.2.1 Documenting results in code examples via assertions 11.2.2 Implementing test-driven exercises via assertions . . . . . . . . . . . . .  11.3 Normal comparison vs. deep comparison . . . 11.4 Quick reference: module assert . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  11.4.1 Normal equality . . . 11.4.2 Deep equality . . . . 11.4.3 Expecting exceptions . 11.4.4 Another tool function .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . .  . .  . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  71 71 72 72 72 73 73 73 73 74  11.1 Assertions in software development In software development, assertions state facts about values or pieces of code that must be true. If they aren’t, an exception is thrown. Node.js supports assertions via its built-in module assert – for example:  import * as assert from 'assert strict'; assert.equal 3 + 5, 8 ;  This assertion states that the expected result of 3 plus 5 is 8. The import statement uses the recommended strict version of assert.  11.2 How assertions are used in this book In this book, assertions are used in two ways: to document results in code examples and to implement test-driven exercises.  71   72  11 Assertion API  11.2.1 Documenting results in code examples via assertions In code examples, assertions express expected results. Take, for example, the following function:  function id x  {  return x;  }  id   returns its parameter. We can show it in action via an assertion:  assert.equal id 'abc' , 'abc' ;  In the examples, I usually omit the statement for importing assert. The motivation behind using assertions is:    You can specify precisely what is expected.   Code examples can be tested automatically, which ensures that they really work.  Implementing test-driven exercises via assertions  11.2.2 The exercises for this book are test-driven, via the test framework Mocha. Checks inside the tests are made via methods of assert. The following is an example of such a test:     For the exercise, you must implement the function hello  .    The test checks if you have done it properly. test 'First exercise',    => {  assert.equal hello 'world' , 'Hello world!' ; assert.equal hello 'Jane' , 'Hello Jane!' ; assert.equal hello 'John' , 'Hello John!' ; assert.equal hello '' , 'Hello !' ;  } ;  For more information, consult §12 “Getting started with quizzes and exercises”.  11.3 Normal comparison vs. deep comparison The strict equal   uses === to compare values. Therefore, an object is only equal to itself – even if another object has the same content  because === does not compare the contents of objects, only their identities :  assert.notEqual {foo: 1}, {foo: 1} ;  deepEqual   is a better choice for comparing objects:  assert.deepEqual {foo: 1}, {foo: 1} ;  This method works for Arrays, too:  assert.notEqual ['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b', 'c'] ; assert.deepEqual ['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b', 'c'] ;   11.4 Quick reference: module assert 11.4 Quick reference: module assert For the full documentation, see the Node.js docs.  11.4.1 Normal equality  73    function equal actual: any, expected: any, message?: string : void  actual === expected must be true. If not, an AssertionError is thrown.  assert.equal 3+3, 6 ;    function notEqual actual: any, expected: any, message?: string : void  actual !== expected must be true. If not, an AssertionError is thrown.  assert.notEqual 3+3, 22 ;  The optional last parameter message can be used to explain what is asserted. If the asser- tion fails, the message is used to set up the AssertionError that is thrown.  let e; try {  const x = 3; assert.equal x, 8, 'x must be equal to 8'   } catch  err  { assert.equal  String err , 'AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: x must be equal to 8' ;  }  11.4.2 Deep equality    function deepEqual actual: any, expected: any, message?: string : void actual must be deeply equal to expected. If not, an AssertionError is thrown.  assert.deepEqual [1,2,3], [1,2,3] ; assert.deepEqual [], [] ;     To .equal  , an object is only equal to itself: assert.notEqual [], [] ;    function notDeepEqual actual: any, expected: any, message?: string :  void actual must not be deeply equal to expected. If it is, an AssertionError is thrown.  assert.notDeepEqual [1,2,3], [1,2] ;  11.4.3 Expecting exceptions If you want to  or expect to  receive an exception, you need throws  : This function calls its ﬁrst parameter, the function block, and only succeeds if it throws an exception. Additional parameters can be used to specify what that exception must look like.   74  11 Assertion API    function throws block: Function, message?: string : void    function throws block: Function, error: Function, message?: string :  assert.throws      => {  null.prop;  }   ;  void  assert.throws      => {  null.prop;  }, TypeError   ;  assert.throws      => {  null.prop;  assert.throws      => {  null.prop;   ;  }, {  }   ;    function throws block: Function, error: RegExp, message?: string : void  },  ^TypeError: Cannot read property 'prop' of null$     function throws block: Function, error: Object, message?: string : void  name: 'TypeError', message: `Cannot read property 'prop' of null`,  11.4.4 Another tool function    function fail message: string  Error : never  Always throws an AssertionError when it is called.

This section gives a brief introduction.  12.3.1 A typical test Typical test code is split into two parts:    Part 1: the code to be tested.   Part 2: the tests for the code.  Take, for example, the following two ﬁles:    id.mjs  code to be tested    id_test.mjs  tests   12.3.1.1 Part 1: the code The code itself resides in id.mjs:  export function id x  {  return x;  }  The key thing here is: everything we want to test must be exported. Otherwise, the test code can’t access it.  12.3.1.2 Part 2: the tests  Don’t worry about the exact details of tests  You don’t need to worry about the exact details of tests: They are always imple- mented for you. Therefore, you only need to read them, but not write them.  The tests for the code reside in id_test.mjs:     npm t demos quizzes-exercises id_test.mjs suite 'id_test.mjs' ;   12.3 Unit tests in JavaScript  79  import * as assert from 'assert strict';     A  import {id} from '. id.mjs';     B   test 'My test',    => {     C   assert.equal id 'abc' , 'abc' ;     D   } ;  The core of this test ﬁle is line D – an assertion: assert.equal   speciﬁes that the ex- pected result of id 'abc'  is 'abc'. As for the other lines:    The comment at the very beginning shows the shell command for running the test.   Line A: We import the Node.js assertion library  in strict assertion mode .   Line B: We import the function to test.   Line C: We deﬁne a test. This is done by calling the function test  :  – First parameter: the name of the test. – Second parameter: the test code, which is provided via an arrow function.  The parameter t gives us access to AVA’s testing API  assertions, etc. .  To run the test, we execute the following in a command line:  npm t demos quizzes-exercises id_test.mjs  The t is an abbreviation for test. That is, the long version of this command is:  npm test demos quizzes-exercises id_test.mjs  Exercise: Your ﬁrst exercise  The following exercise gives you a ﬁrst taste of what exercises are like:    exercises quizzes-exercises first_module_test.mjs  12.3.2 Asynchronous tests in Mocha  Reading  You may want to postpone reading this section until you get to the chapters on asynchronous programming.  Writing tests for asynchronous code requires extra work: The test receives its results later and has to signal to Mocha that it isn’t ﬁnished yet when it returns. The following subsections examine three ways of doing so.  12.3.2.1 Asynchronicity via callbacks If the callback we pass to test   has a parameter  e.g., done , Mocha switches to callback- based asynchronicity. When we are done with our asynchronous work, we have to call done:   80  12 Getting started with quizzes and exercises  test.cb 'divideCallback', t => {  divideCallback 8, 4,  error, result  => {  if  error  {  t.end error ;  } else {  assert.strictEqual result, 2 ; t.end  ;  This is what divideCallback   looks like:  function divideCallback x, y, callback  {  if  y === 0  {  callback new Error 'Division by zero'  ;  } else {  callback null, x   y ;  test 'dividePromise 1', t => {  return dividePromise 8, 4  .then result => {  assert.strictEqual result, 2 ;  dividePromise   is implemented as follows:  function dividePromise x, y  {  return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {  reject new Error 'Division by zero'  ;  if  y === 0  {  } else {  resolve x   y ;  } } ;  } ;  }  }  } ;  } ;  } } ;  }  12.3.2.2 Asynchronicity via Promises If a test returns a Promise, Mocha switches to Promise-based asynchronicity. A test is considered successful if the Promise is fulﬁlled and failed if the Promise is rejected or if a settlement takes longer than a timeout.  12.3.2.3 Async functions as test “bodies” Async functions always return Promises. Therefore, an async function is a convenient way of implementing an asynchronous test. The following code is equivalent to the pre- vious example.   12.3 Unit tests in JavaScript  81  test 'dividePromise 2', async t => {  const result = await dividePromise 8, 4 ; assert.strictEqual result, 2 ;    No explicit return necessary!  } ;  We don’t need to explicitly return anything: The implicitly returned undefined is used to fulﬁll the Promise returned by this async function. And if the test code throws an exception, then the async function takes care of rejecting the returned Promise.   82  12 Getting started with quizzes and exercises   Part III  Variables and values  83    Variables and assignment  Chapter 13  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  13.1 let . 13.2 const  . . 13.4.1 Shadowing variables . . .  . . 13.5  Advanced  . 13.6 Terminology: static vs. dynamic  . . . . . . . 13.2.1 const and immutability . . 13.2.2 const and loops . . . 13.3 Deciding between const and let . . . 13.4 The scope of a variable . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.6.1 Static phenomenon: scopes of variables . . . . 13.6.2 Dynamic phenomenon: function calls . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13.8.1 const and let: temporal dead zone . . . . . 13.8.2 Function declarations and early activation . 13.8.3 Class declarations are not activated early . . . . . 13.8.4 var: hoisting  partial early activation  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . 13.9.1 Bound variables vs. free variables . 13.9.2 What is a closure? . . . 13.9.3 Example: A factory for incrementors 13.9.4 Use cases for closures . .  13.7 Global variables and the global object . . . . .  . . 13.8 Declarations: scope and activation .  13.7.1 globalThis [ES2020]  13.9 Closures .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  86 86 86 87 87 87 88 89 89 89 89 90 90 92 92 93 95 95 96 96 96 97 98  These are JavaScript’s main ways of declaring variables:    let declares mutable variables.   const declares constants  immutable variables .  Before ES6, there was also var. But it has several quirks, so it’s best to avoid it in modern JavaScript. You can read more about it in Speaking JavaScript.  85   13 Variables and assignment  86 13.1 let Variables declared via let are mutable:  let i; i = 0; i = i + 1; assert.equal i, 1 ;  let i = 0;  You can also declare and assign at the same time:  13.2 const Variables declared via const are immutable. You must always initialize immediately:  const i = 0;    must initialize  assert.throws      => { i = i + 1 }, {  name: 'TypeError', message: 'Assignment to constant variable.',  13.2.1 const and immutability In JavaScript, const only means that the binding  the association between variable name and variable value  is immutable. The value itself may be mutable, like obj in the fol- lowing example.  const obj = { prop: 0 };     Allowed: changing properties of `obj` obj.prop = obj.prop + 1; assert.equal obj.prop, 1 ;     Not allowed: assigning to `obj` assert.throws      => { obj = {} }, {  name: 'TypeError', message: 'Assignment to constant variable.',  }   ;  }   ;   13.3 Deciding between const and let  87  13.2.2 const and loops You can use const with for-of loops, where a fresh binding is created for each iteration:  const arr = ['hello', 'world']; for  const elem of arr  {  console.log elem ;  }    Output:    'hello'    'world'  In plain for loops, you must use let, however:  const arr = ['hello', 'world']; for  let i=0; i<arr.length; i++  {  const elem = arr[i]; console.log elem ;  }  13.3 Deciding between const and let I recommend the following rules to decide between const and let:    const indicates an immutable binding and that a variable never changes its value.    let indicates that the value of a variable changes. Use it only when you can’t use  Prefer it.  const.  Exercise: const  exercises variables-assignment const_exrc.mjs  13.4 The scope of a variable The scope of a variable is the region of a program where it can be accessed. Consider the following code.  {       Scope A. Accessible: x  const x = 0; assert.equal x, 0 ; {    Scope B. Accessible: x, y  const y = 1; assert.equal x, 0 ; assert.equal y, 1 ; {    Scope C. Accessible: x, y, z  const z = 2; assert.equal x, 0 ; assert.equal y, 1 ;   88  13 Variables and assignment  }  }  }  }, {  } ;  assert.equal z, 2 ;  }    Outside. Not accessible: x, y, z assert.throws      => console.log x , {  name: 'ReferenceError', message: 'x is not defined',   ;   Scope A is the  direct  scope of x.   Scopes B and C are inner scopes of scope A.   Scope A is an outer scope of scope B and scope C.  Each variable is accessible in its direct scope and all scopes nested within that scope. The variables declared via const and let are called block-scoped because their scopes are always the innermost surrounding blocks.  13.4.1 Shadowing variables You can’t declare the same variable twice at the same level:  assert.throws      => {  eval 'let x = 1; let x = 2;' ;  name: 'SyntaxError', message: "Identifier 'x' has already been declared",  Why eval  ?  eval   delays parsing  and therefore the SyntaxError , until the callback of as- sert.throws   is executed. If we didn’t use it, we’d already get an error when this code is parsed and assert.throws   wouldn’t even be executed.  You can, however, nest a block and use the same variable name x that you used outside the block:  const x = 1; assert.equal x, 1 ; {  const x = 2; assert.equal x, 2 ;   89  Inside the block, the inner x is the only accessible variable with that name. The inner x is said to shadow the outer x. Once you leave the block, you can access the old value again.  13.5  Advanced   } assert.equal x, 1 ;  Quiz: basic  See quiz app.   Advanced   13.5 All remaining sections are advanced.  13.6 Terminology: static vs. dynamic These two adjectives describe phenomena in programming languages:    Static means that something is related to source code and can be determined with-  out executing code.    Dynamic means at runtime.  Let’s look at examples for these two terms.  13.6.1 Static phenomenon: scopes of variables Variable scopes are a static phenomenon. Consider the following code:  function f   { const x = 3;    ···  }  }  x is statically  or lexically  scoped. That is, its scope is ﬁxed and doesn’t change at runtime. Variable scopes form a static tree  via static nesting .  13.6.2 Dynamic phenomenon: function calls Function calls are a dynamic phenomenon. Consider the following code:  function g x  {} function h y  {  if  Math.random    g y ;     A   Whether or not the function call in line A happens, can only be decided at runtime. Function calls form a dynamic tree  via dynamic calls .   90 13.7 Global variables and the global object JavaScript’s variable scopes are nested. They form a tree:  13 Variables and assignment    The outermost scope is the root of the tree.   The scopes directly contained in that scope are the children of the root.   And so on.  The root is also called the global scope. In web browsers, the only location where one is directly in that scope is at the top level of a script. The variables of the global scope are called global variables and accessible everywhere. There are two kinds of global variables:    Global declarative variables are normal variables.  – They can only be created while at the top level of a script, via const, let, and  class declarations.    Global object variables are stored in properties of the so-called global object.  – They are created in the top level of a script, via var and function declarations. – The global object can be accessed via the global variable globalThis. It can  be used to create, read, and delete global object variables.  – Other than that, global object variables work like normal variables.  The following HTML fragment demonstrates globalThis and the two kinds of global variables.  const declarativeVariable = 'd'; var objectVariable = 'o';             All scripts share the same top-level scope: console.log declarativeVariable ;    'd' console.log objectVariable ;    'o'     Not all declarations create properties of the global object: console.log globalThis.declarativeVariable ;    undefined console.log globalThis.objectVariable ;    'o'     Each ECMAScript module has its own scope. Therefore, variables that exist at the top level of a module are not global. Fig. 13.1 illustrates how the various scopes are related.  13.7.1 globalThis [ES2020] The global variable globalThis is the new standard way of accessing the global object. It got its name from the fact that it has the same value as this in global scope.  globalThis does not always directly point to the global object  For example, in browsers, there is an indirection. That indirection is normally not noticable, but it is there and can be observed.   13.7 Global variables and the global object  91  Figure 13.1: The global scope is JavaScript’s outermost scope. It has two kinds of vari- ables: object variables  managed via the global object  and normal declarative variables. Each ECMAScript module has its own scope which is contained in the global scope.  13.7.1.1 Alternatives to globalThis Older ways of accessing the global object depend on the platform:    Global variable window: is the classic way of referring to the global object. But it  doesn’t work in Node.js and in Web Workers.    Global variable self: is available in Web Workers and browsers in general. But it  isn’t supported by Node.js.    Global variable global: is only available in Node.js.  13.7.1.2 Use cases for globalThis The global object is now considered a mistake that JavaScript can’t get rid of, due to backward compatibility. It affects performance negatively and is generally confusing. ECMAScript 6 introduced several features that make it easier to avoid the global object – for example:    const, let, and class declarations don’t create global object properties when used  in global scope.    Each ECMAScript module has its own local scope.  It is usually better to access global object variables via variables and not via properties of globalThis. The former has always worked the same on all JavaScript platforms. Tutorials on the web occasionally access global variables globVar via window.globVar. But the preﬁx “window.” is not necessary and I recommend to omit it:  window.encodeURIComponent str ;    no encodeURIComponent str ;    yes  Therefore, there are relatively few use cases for globalThis – for example:  Global scope  Object variables  Declarative variables  Top level of scripts: var, function declarations const, let, class declarations  Module scope 1  Module scope 2  ···   92  13 Variables and assignment    Polyﬁlls that add new features to old JavaScript engines.   Feature detection, to ﬁnd out what features a JavaScript engine supports.  13.8 Declarations: scope and activation These are two key aspects of declarations:    Scope: Where can a declared entity be seen? This is a static trait.   Activation: When can I access an entity? This is a dynamic trait. Some entities can be accessed as soon as we enter their scopes. For others, we have to wait until execution reaches their declarations.  Tbl. 13.1 summarizes how various declarations handle these aspects.  Table 13.1: Aspects of declarations. “Duplicates” describes if a declara- tion can be used twice with the same name  per scope . “Global prop.” describes if a declaration adds a property to the global object, when it is executed in the global scope of a script.

The following sections describe the other constructs in more detail.  13.8.1 const and let: temporal dead zone For JavaScript, TC39 needed to decide what happens if you access a constant in its direct scope, before its declaration:  {  }  console.log x ;    What happens here? const x;  Some possible approaches are:  1. The name is resolved in the scope surrounding the current scope. 2. You get undefined. 3. There is an error.   13.8 Declarations: scope and activation  93  Approach 1 was rejected because there is no precedent in the language for this approach. It would therefore not be intuitive to JavaScript programmers. Approach 2 was rejected because then x wouldn’t be a constant – it would have different values before and after its declaration. let uses the same approach 3 as const, so that both work similarly and it’s easy to switch between them. The time between entering the scope of a variable and executing its declaration is called the temporal dead zone  TDZ  of that variable:    During this time, the variable is considered to be uninitialized  as if that were a  special value it has .    If you access an uninitialized variable, you get a ReferenceError.   Once you reach a variable declaration, the variable is set to either the value of the initializer  speciﬁed via the assignment symbol  or undefined – if there is no initializer.  The following code illustrates the temporal dead zone:  if  true  {    entering scope of `tmp`, TDZ starts     `tmp` is uninitialized: assert.throws    =>  tmp = 'abc' , ReferenceError ; assert.throws    => console.log tmp , ReferenceError ;  let tmp;    TDZ ends assert.equal tmp, undefined ;  The next example shows that the temporal dead zone is truly temporal  related to time :  if  true  {    entering scope of `myVar`, TDZ starts  const func =    => {  console.log myVar ;    executed later     We are within the TDZ:    Accessing `myVar` causes `ReferenceError`  let myVar = 3;    TDZ ends func  ;    OK, called outside TDZ  Even though func   is located before the declaration of myVar and uses that variable, we can call func  . But we have to wait until the temporal dead zone of myVar is over.  13.8.2 Function declarations and early activation  More information on functions  };  }  }   94  13 Variables and assignment  In this section, we are using functions – before we had a chance to learn them prop- erly. Hopefully, everything still makes sense. Whenever it doesn’t, please see §27 “Callable values”.  A function declaration is always executed when entering its scope, regardless of where it is located within that scope. That enables you to call a function foo   before it is declared:  The early activation of foo   means that the previous code is equivalent to:  assert.equal foo  , 123 ;    OK function foo   { return 123; }  function foo   { return 123; } assert.equal foo  , 123 ;  If you declare a function via const or let, then it is not activated early. In the following example, you can only use bar   after its declaration.  assert.throws      => bar  ,    before declaration ReferenceError ;  const bar =    => { return 123; };  assert.equal bar  , 123 ;    after declaration  13.8.2.1 Calling ahead without early activation Even if a function g   is not activated early, it can be called by a preceding function f    in the same scope  if we adhere to the following rule: f   must be invoked after the declaration of g  .  const f =    => g  ; const g =    => 123;     We call f   after g   was declared: assert.equal f  , 123 ;  The functions of a module are usually invoked after its complete body is executed. There- fore, in modules, you rarely need to worry about the order of functions. Lastly, note how early activation automatically keeps the aforementioned rule: when entering a scope, all function declarations are executed ﬁrst, before any calls are made.  13.8.2.2 A pitfall of early activation If you rely on early activation to call a function before its declaration, then you need to be careful that it doesn’t access data that isn’t activated early.  funcDecl  ;  const MY_STR = 'abc'; function funcDecl   {   13.8 Declarations: scope and activation  95  assert.throws     => MY_STR, ReferenceError ;  }  The problem goes away if you make the call to funcDecl   after the declaration of MY_- STR.  13.8.2.3 The pros and cons of early activation We have seen that early activation has a pitfall and that you can get most of its beneﬁts without using it. Therefore, it is better to avoid early activation. But I don’t feel strongly about this and, as mentioned before, often use function declarations because I like their syntax.  13.8.3 Class declarations are not activated early Even though they are similar to function declarations in some ways, class declarations are not activated early:  assert.throws      => new MyClass  , ReferenceError ;  class MyClass {}  assert.equal new MyClass   instanceof MyClass, true ;  Why is that? Consider the following class declaration:  class MyClass extends Object {}  The operand of extends is an expression. Therefore, you can do things like this:  const identity = x => x; class MyClass extends identity Object  {}  Evaluating such an expression must be done at the location where it is mentioned. Any- thing else would be confusing. That explains why class declarations are not activated early.  13.8.4 var: hoisting  partial early activation  var is an older way of declaring variables that predates const and let  which are pre- ferred now . Consider the following var declaration.  var x = 123;  This declaration has two parts:    Declaration var x: The scope of a var-declared variable is the innermost surround- ing function and not the innermost surrounding block, as for most other declara- tions. Such a variable is already active at the beginning of its scope and initialized with undefined.   96  13 Variables and assignment    Assignment x = 123: The assignment is always executed in place.  The following code demonstrates the effects of var:  function f   {     Partial early activation: assert.equal x, undefined ; if  true  {  var x = 123;    The assignment is executed in place: assert.equal x, 123 ;  }    Scope is function, not block: assert.equal x, 123 ;  }  13.9 Closures Before we can explore closures, we need to learn about bound variables and free vari- ables.  13.9.1 Bound variables vs. free variables Per scope, there is a set of variables that are mentioned. Among these variables we dis- tinguish:    Bound variables are declared within the scope. They are parameters and local vari-    Free variables are declared externally. They are also called non-local variables.  ables.  Consider the following code:  function func x  {  const y = 123; console.log z ;  }  13.9.2 What is a closure? What is a closure then?  In the body of func  , x and y are bound variables. z is a free variable.  A closure is a function plus a connection to the variables that exist at its “birth place”.  What is the point of keeping this connection? It provides the values for the free variables of the function – for example:  function funcFactory value  {  return    => { return value;   13.9 Closures  };  }  97  const func = funcFactory 'abc' ; assert.equal func  , 'abc' ;     A   funcFactory returns a closure that is assigned to func. Because func has the connection to the variables at its birth place, it can still access the free variable value when it is called in line A  even though it “escaped” its scope .  All functions in JavaScript are closures  Static scoping is supported via closures in JavaScript. Therefore, every function is a closure.  13.9.3 Example: A factory for incrementors The following function returns incrementors  a name that I just made up . An incrementor is a function that internally stores a number. When it is called, it updates that number by adding the argument to it and returns the new value.  We can see that the function created in line A keeps its internal number in the free variable startValue. This time, we don’t just read from the birth scope, we use it to store data that we change and that persists across function calls. We can create more storage slots in the birth scope, via local variables:  function createInc startValue  {  return  step  => {     A   startValue += step; return startValue;  };  } const inc = createInc 5 ; assert.equal inc 2 , 7 ;  function createInc startValue  {  let index = -1; return  step  => {  startValue += step; index++; return [index, startValue];  };  } const inc = createInc 5 ; assert.deepEqual inc 2 , [0, 7] ; assert.deepEqual inc 2 , [1, 9] ; assert.deepEqual inc 2 , [2, 11] ;   98  13.9.4 Use cases for closures What are closures good for?  13 Variables and assignment    For starters, they are simply an implementation of static scoping. As such, they  provide context data for callbacks.    They can also be used by functions to store state that persists across function calls.  createInc   is an example of that.    And they can provide private data for objects  produced via literals or classes .  The details of how that works are explained in Exploring ES6.

Supporting tool: ===  In this chapter, we’ll occasionally use the strict equality operator. a === b evaluates to true if a and b are equal. What exactly that means is explained in §15.4.2 “Strict equality  === and !== ”.  14.1 What’s a type? For this chapter, I consider types to be sets of values – for example, the type boolean is the set { false, true }.  99   100 14.2  JavaScript’s type hierarchy  14 Values  Figure 14.1: A partial hierarchy of JavaScript’s types. Missing are the classes for errors, the classes associated with primitive types, and more. The diagram hints at the fact that not all objects are instances of Object.  Fig. 14.1 shows JavaScript’s type hierarchy. What do we learn from that diagram?    JavaScript distinguishes two kinds of values: primitive values and objects. We’ll  see soon what the difference is.    The diagram differentiates objects and instances of class Object. Each instance of Object is also an object, but not vice versa. However, virtually all objects that you’ll encounter in practice are instances of Object – for example, objects created via object literals. More details on this topic are explained in §31.4.3.4 “Objects that aren’t instances of Object”.  14.3 The types of the language speciﬁcation The ECMAScript speciﬁcation only knows a total of eight types. The names of those types are  I’m using TypeScript’s names, not the spec’s names :    undefined with the only element undefined   null with the only element null   boolean with the elements false and true   number the type of all numbers  e.g., -123, 3.141    bigint the type of all big integers  e.g., -123n    string the type of all strings  e.g., 'abc'    symbol the type of all symbols  e.g., Symbol 'My Symbol'     object the type of all objects  different from Object, the type of all instances of  class Object and its subclasses    any    primitive value   undeﬁned  null  boolean  number  string  symbol   object   Object  Array  Map  Set  Function  RegExp  Date   14.4 Primitive values vs. objects 14.4 Primitive values vs. objects The speciﬁcation makes an important distinction between values:  101    Primitive values are the elements of the types undefined, null, boolean, number,  bigint, string, symbol.    All other values are objects.  In contrast to Java  that inspired JavaScript here , primitive values are not second-class citizens. The difference between them and objects is more subtle. In a nutshell:    Primitive values: are atomic building blocks of data in JavaScript.  – They are passed by value: when primitive values are assigned to variables or  passed to functions, their contents are copied.  – They are compared by value: when comparing two primitive values, their con-  tents are compared.    Objects: are compound pieces of data.  – They are passed by identity  my term : when objects are assigned to variables  or passed to functions, their identities  think pointers  are copied.  – They are compared by identity  my term : when comparing two objects, their  identities are compared.  Other than that, primitive values and objects are quite similar: they both have properties  key-value entries  and can be used in the same locations. Next, we’ll look at primitive values and objects in more depth.  14.4.1 Primitive values  short: primitives  14.4.1.1 Primitives are immutable You can’t change, add, or remove properties of primitives:  let str = 'abc'; assert.equal str.length, 3 ; assert.throws      => { str.length = 1 },  ^TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'length'    ;  14.4.1.2 Primitives are passed by value Primitives are passed by value: variables  including parameters  store the contents of the primitives. When assigning a primitive value to a variable or passing it as an argument to a function, its content is copied.  let x = 123; let y = x; assert.equal y, 123 ;   102  14 Values  14.4.1.3 Primitives are compared by value Primitives are compared by value: when comparing two primitive values, we compare their contents.  assert.equal 123 === 123, true ; assert.equal 'abc' === 'abc', true ;  To see what’s so special about this way of comparing, read on and ﬁnd out how objects are compared.  14.4.2 Objects Objects are covered in detail in §30 “Single objects” and the following chapter. Here, we mainly focus on how they differ from primitive values. Let’s ﬁrst explore two common ways of creating objects:    Object literal:  const obj = {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',  };  The object literal starts and ends with curly braces {}. It creates an object with two properties. The ﬁrst property has the key 'first'  a string  and the value 'Jane'. The second property has the key 'last' and the value 'Doe'. For more information on object literals, consult §30.2.1 “Object literals: properties”.    Array literal:  const fruits = ['strawberry', 'apple'];  The Array literal starts and ends with square brackets []. It creates an Array with two elements: 'strawberry' and 'apple'. For more information on Array literals, consult §33.2.1 “Creating, reading, writing Arrays”.  14.4.2.1 Objects are mutable by default By default, you can freely change, add, and remove the properties of objects:  const obj = {};  obj.count = 2;    add a property assert.equal obj.count, 2 ;  obj.count = 3;    change a property assert.equal obj.count, 3 ;  14.4.2.2 Objects are passed by identity Objects are passed by identity  my term : variables  including parameters  store the identi- ties of objects.   14.5 The operators typeof and instanceof: what’s the type of a value?  103  The identity of an object is like a pointer  or a transparent reference  to the object’s actual data on the heap  think shared main memory of a JavaScript engine . When assigning an object to a variable or passing it as an argument to a function, its identity is copied. Each object literal creates a fresh object on the heap and returns its identity.  const a = {};    fresh empty object    Pass the identity in `a` to `b`: const b = a;     Now `a` and `b` point to the same object     they “share” that object : assert.equal a === b, true ;     Changing `a` also changes `b`: a.name = 'Tessa'; assert.equal b.name, 'Tessa' ;  JavaScript uses garbage collection to automatically manage memory:  let obj = { prop: 'value' }; obj = {};  Now the old value { prop: 'value' } of obj is garbage  not used anymore . JavaScript will automatically garbage-collect it  remove it from memory , at some point in time  pos- sibly never if there is enough free memory .  Details: passing by identity  “Passing by identity” means that the identity of an object  a transparent reference  is passed by value. This approach is also called “passing by sharing”.  14.4.2.3 Objects are compared by identity Objects are compared by identity  my term : two variables are only equal if they contain the same object identity. They are not equal if they refer to different objects with the same content.  const obj = {};    fresh empty object assert.equal obj === obj, true ;    same identity assert.equal {} === {}, false ;    different identities, same content  14.5 The operators typeof and instanceof: what’s the type  of a value?  The two operators typeof and instanceof let you determine what type a given value x has:   104  14 Values  if  typeof x === 'string'  ··· if  x instanceof Array  ···  How do they differ?  addition .    typeof distinguishes the 7 types of the speciﬁcation  minus one omission, plus one    instanceof tests which class created a given value.  Rule of thumb: typeof is for primitive values; instanceof is for objects  14.5.1 typeof  Table 14.1: The results of the typeof operator.  x  undefined null Boolean Number Bigint String Symbol Function All other objects  typeof x  'undefined' 'object' 'boolean' 'number' 'bigint' 'string' 'symbol' 'function' 'object'  Tbl. 14.1 lists all results of typeof. They roughly correspond to the 7 types of the language speciﬁcation. Alas, there are two differences, and they are language quirks:    typeof null returns 'object' and not 'null'. That’s a bug. Unfortunately, it  can’t be ﬁxed. TC39 tried to do that, but it broke too much code on the web.    typeof of a function should be 'object'  functions are objects . Introducing a  separate category for functions is confusing.  These are a few examples of using typeof:  > typeof undefined 'undefined' > typeof 123n 'bigint' > typeof 'abc' 'string' > typeof {} 'object'  Exercises: Two exercises on typeof   14.6 Classes and constructor functions  105    exercises values typeof_exrc.mjs   Bonus: exercises values is_object_test.mjs  14.5.2 instanceof This operator answers the question: has a value x been created by a class C?  x instanceof C  For example:  >  function   {}  instanceof Function true >  {}  instanceof Object true > [] instanceof Array true  Primitive values are not instances of anything:  > 123 instanceof Number false > '' instanceof String false > '' instanceof Object false  Exercise: instanceof  exercises values instanceof_exrc.mjs  14.6 Classes and constructor functions JavaScript’s original factories for objects are constructor functions: ordinary functions that return “instances” of themselves if you invoke them via the new operator. ES6 introduced classes, which are mainly better syntax for constructor functions. In this book, I’m using the terms constructor function and class interchangeably. Classes can be seen as partitioning the single type object of the speciﬁcation into sub- types – they give us more types than the limited 7 ones of the speciﬁcation. Each class is the type of the objects that were created by it.  14.6.1 Constructor functions associated with primitive types Each primitive type  except for the spec-internal types for undefined and null  has an associated constructor function  think class :    The constructor function Boolean is associated with booleans.   The constructor function Number is associated with numbers.   106  14 Values    The constructor function String is associated with strings.   The constructor function Symbol is associated with symbols. Each of these functions plays several roles – for example, Number:   You can use it as a function and convert values to numbers:  assert.equal Number '123' , 123 ;    Number.prototype provides the properties for numbers – for example, method  assert.equal  123 .toString, Number.prototype.toString ;    Number is a namespace container object for tool functions for numbers – for exam-  .toString  :  ple:  assert.equal Number.isInteger 123 , true ;    Lastly, you can also use Number as a class and create number objects. These objects  are different from real numbers and should be avoided.  assert.notEqual new Number 123 , 123 ; assert.equal new Number 123 .valueOf  , 123 ;  14.6.1.1 Wrapping primitive values The constructor functions related to primitive types are also called wrapper types because they provide the canonical way of converting primitive values to objects. In the process, primitive values are “wrapped” in objects.  const prim = true; assert.equal typeof prim, 'boolean' ; assert.equal prim instanceof Boolean, false ;  const wrapped = Object prim ; assert.equal typeof wrapped, 'object' ; assert.equal wrapped instanceof Boolean, true ;  assert.equal wrapped.valueOf  , prim ;    unwrap  Wrapping rarely matters in practice, but it is used internally in the language speciﬁcation, to give primitives properties.  14.7 Converting between types There are two ways in which values are converted to other types in JavaScript:    Explicit conversion: via functions such as String  .   Coercion  automatic conversion : happens when an operation receives operands -  parameters that it can’t work with.   14.7 Converting between types  107  14.7.1 Explicit conversion between types The function associated with a primitive type explicitly converts values to that type:  > Boolean 0  false > Number '123'  123 > String 123  '123'  > typeof Object 123  'object'  You can also use Object   to convert values to objects:  The following table describes in more detail how this conversion works:  x  Object x   undefined null boolean number bigint string symbol object  {} {} new Boolean x  new Number x  An instance of BigInt  new throws TypeError  new String x  An instance of Symbol  new throws TypeError  x  14.7.2 Coercion  automatic conversion between types  For many operations, JavaScript automatically converts the operands parameters if their types don’t ﬁt. This kind of automatic conversion is called coercion. For example, the multiplication operator coerces its operands to numbers:  Many built-in functions coerce, too. For example, parseInt   coerces its parameter to string  parsing stops at the ﬁrst character that is not a digit :  > '7' * '3' 21  > parseInt 123.45  123  Exercise: Converting values to primitives  exercises values conversion_exrc.mjs   108  Quiz See quiz app.  14 Values   Chapter 15  Operators  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  15.4 Equality: == vs. === .  15.1 Making sense of operators .  15.2 The plus operator  +  . . 15.3 Assignment operators .  . . . . . . . . 15.3.1 The plain assignment operator . . . 15.3.2 Compound assignment operators . . . . . . .  . 15.1.1 Operators coerce their operands to appropriate types . 15.1.2 Most operators only work with primitive values . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15.4.1 Loose equality  == and !=  . . . 15.4.2 Strict equality  === and !==  15.4.3 Recommendation: always use strict equality . . . 15.4.4 Even stricter than ===: Object.is   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  15.5 Ordering operators . . 15.6 Various other operators 15.6.1 Comma operator 15.6.2 void operator .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 109 . 110 . 110 . 110 . 111 . 111 . 111 . 112 . 112 . 113 . 114 . 114 . 115 . 116 . 116 . 116  15.1 Making sense of operators JavaScript’s operators may seem quirky. With the following two rules, they are easier to understand:    Operators coerce their operands to appropriate types   Most operators only work with primitive values  109   110  15 Operators  15.1.1 Operators coerce their operands to appropriate types If an operator gets operands that don’t have the proper types, it rarely throws an excep- tion. Instead, it coerces  automatically converts  the operands so that it can work with them. Let’s look at two examples. First, the multiplication operator can only work with numbers. Therefore, it converts strings to numbers before computing its result.  Second, the square brackets operator  [ ]  for accessing the properties of an object can only handle strings and symbols. All other values are coerced to string:     Coerce true to the string 'true' assert.equal obj[true], 123 ;  15.1.2 Most operators only work with primitive values As mentioned before, most operators only work with primitive values. If an operand is an object, it is usually coerced to a primitive value – for example:  Why? The plus operator ﬁrst coerces its operands to primitive values:  > '7' * '3' 21  const obj = {}; obj['true'] = 123;  > [1,2,3] + [4,5,6] '1,2,34,5,6'  > String [1,2,3]  '1,2,3' > String [4,5,6]  '4,5,6'  Next, it concatenates the two strings:  > '1,2,3' + '4,5,6' '1,2,34,5,6'  15.2 The plus operator  +  The plus operator works as follows in JavaScript:    First, it converts both operands to primitive values. Then it switches to one of two  modes:  – String mode: If one of the two primitive values is a string, then it converts  the other one to a string, concatenates both strings, and returns the result.  – Number mode: Otherwise, It converts both operands to numbers, adds them,  and returns the result.  String mode lets us use + to assemble strings:   111  15.3 Assignment operators  > 'There are ' + 3 + ' items' 'There are 3 items'  > 4 + true 5  Number true  is 1.  Number mode means that if neither operand is a string  or an object that becomes a string  then everything is coerced to numbers:  15.3 Assignment operators 15.3.1 The plain assignment operator The plain assignment operator is used to change storage locations: x = value;    assign to a previously declared variable obj.propKey = value;    assign to a property arr[index] = value;    assign to an Array element  Initializers in variable declarations can also be viewed as a form of assignment:  const x = value; let y = value;  15.3.2 Compound assignment operators JavaScript supports the following assignment operators:    Arithmetic assignment operators: += -= *=  = %= [ES1]  – += can also be used for string concatenation – Introduced later: **= [ES2016]    Bitwise assignment operators: &= ^= = [ES1]   Bitwise shift assignment operators:  >= >>>= [ES1]   Logical assignment operators: = &&= ??= [ES2021]  15.3.2.1 Logical assignment operators Logical assignment operators work differently from other compound assignment opera- tors:  Assignment operator a = b a &&= b a ??= b  Only assigns if a is Equivalent to Falsy a   a = b  Truthy a &&  a = b  a ??  a = b  Nullish  Why is a = b equivalent to the following expression?  a   a = b    112  Why not to this expression?  a = a  b  15 Operators  The former expression has the beneﬁt of short-circuiting: The assignment is only evalu- ated if a evaluates to false. Therefore, the assignment is only performed if it’s necessary. In contrast, the latter expression always performs an assignment. For more on ??=, see §16.4.5 “The nullish coalescing assignment operator  ??= ”.  15.3.2.2 The remaining compound assignment operators For operators op other than  && ??, the following two ways of assigning are equivalent:  If, for example, op is +, then we get the operator += that works as follows.  myvar op= value myvar = myvar op value  let str = ''; str += ' '; str += 'Hello!'; str += ' ';  assert.equal str, ' Hello! ' ;  15.4 Equality: == vs. === JavaScript has two kinds of equality operators: loose equality  ==  and strict equality  === . The recommendation is to always use the latter.    == is also called double equals. Its ofﬁcial name in the language speciﬁcation  Other names for == and ===  is abstract equality comparison.   === is also called triple equals.  15.4.1 Loose equality  == and !=  Loose equality is one of JavaScript’s quirks. It often coerces operands. Some of those coercions make sense:  > '123' == 123 true > false == 0 true  Others less so: > '' == 0 true   15.4 Equality: == vs. ===  113  Objects are coerced to primitives if  and only if!  the other operand is primitive:  If both operands are objects, they are only equal if they are the same object:  Lastly, == considers undefined and null to be equal:  > undefined == null true  15.4.2 Strict equality  === and !==  Strict equality never coerces. Two values are only equal if they have the same type. Let’s revisit our previous interaction with the == operator and see what the === operator does:  An object is only equal to another value if that value is the same object:  > [1, 2, 3] == '1,2,3' true > ['1', '2', '3'] == '1,2,3' true  > [1, 2, 3] == ['1', '2', '3'] false > [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3] false  > const arr = [1, 2, 3]; > arr == arr true  > false === 0 false > '123' === 123 false  > [1, 2, 3] === '1,2,3' false > ['1', '2', '3'] === '1,2,3' false  > [1, 2, 3] === ['1', '2', '3'] false > [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3] false  > const arr = [1, 2, 3]; > arr === arr true  > undefined === null false  The === operator does not consider undefined and null to be equal:   114  15 Operators  15.4.3 Recommendation: always use strict equality I recommend to always use ===. It makes your code easier to understand and spares you from having to think about the quirks of ==. Let’s look at two use cases for == and what I recommend to do instead.  15.4.3.1 Use case for ==: comparing with a number or a string == lets you check if a value x is a number or that number as a string – with a single comparison:  if  x == 123  {     x is either 123 or '123'  I prefer either of the following two alternatives:  if  x === 123  x === '123'  ··· if  Number x  === 123  ···  You can also convert x to a number when you ﬁrst encounter it.  15.4.3.2 Use case for ==: comparing with undefined or null Another use case for == is to check if a value x is either undefined or null:  if  x == null  {     x is either null or undefined  }  }  The problem with this code is that you can’t be sure if someone meant to write it that way or if they made a typo and meant === null. I prefer either of the following two alternatives: if  x === undefined  x === null  ··· if  !x  ···  A downside of the second alternative is that it accepts values other than undefined and null, but it is a well-established pattern in JavaScript  to be explained in detail in §17.3 “Truthiness-based existence checks” . The following three conditions are also roughly equivalent:  if  x != null  ··· if  x !== undefined && x !== null  ··· if  x  ···  15.4.4 Even stricter than ===: Object.is   Method Object.is   compares two values:  > Object.is 123, 123  true   115  15.5 Ordering operators  > Object.is 123, '123'  false  > Object.is NaN, NaN  true > NaN === NaN false  It is even stricter than ===. For example, it considers NaN, the error value for computations involving numbers, to be equal to itself:  That is occasionally useful. For example, you can use it to implement an improved ver- sion of the Array method .indexOf  :  const myIndexOf =  arr, elem  => {  return arr.findIndex x => Object.is x, elem  ;  };  myIndexOf   ﬁnds NaN in an Array, while .indexOf   doesn’t:  > myIndexOf [0,NaN,2], NaN  1 > [0,NaN,2].indexOf NaN  -1  15.5 Ordering operators  The result -1 means that .indexOf   couldn’t ﬁnd its argument in the Array.  Table 15.2: JavaScript’s ordering operators.  Operator < <= > >=  name less than Less than or equal Greater than Greater than or equal  JavaScript’s ordering operators  tbl. 15.2  work for both numbers and strings:  > 5 >= 2 true > 'bar' < 'foo' true   = are based on strict equality.  The ordering operators don’t work well for human languages   116  15 Operators  The ordering operators don’t work well for comparing text in a human language, e.g., when capitalization or accents are involved. The details are explained in §22.5 “Comparing strings”.  15.6 Various other operators The following operators are covered elsewhere in this book:    Operators for booleans, numbers, strings, objects   The nullish coalescing operator  ??  for default values  The next two subsections discuss two operators that are rarely used.  15.6.1 Comma operator The comma operator has two operands, evaluates both of them and returns the second one:  For more information on this operator, see Speaking JavaScript.  15.6.2 void operator The void operator evaluates its operand and returns undefined:  For more information on this operator, see Speaking JavaScript.  > 'a', 'b' 'b'  > void  3 + 2  undefined  Quiz See quiz app.   Part IV  Primitive values  117    Chapter 16  The non-values undefined and null  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . 16.1 undefined vs. null . . . . 16.2 Occurrences of undefined and null . . 16.2.1 Occurrences of undefined . . . . . . 16.2.2 Occurrences of null . 16.3 Checking for undefined or null . . . . 16.4 The nullish coalescing operator  ??  for default values [ES2020] . . 16.4.1 Example: counting matches . . . . 16.4.2 Example: specifying a default value for a property . 16.4.3 Using destructuring for default values . . . . 16.4.4 Legacy approach: using logical Or    for default values . . . 16.4.5 The nullish coalescing assignment operator  ??=  . . . . . . . . .  16.5 undefined and null don’t have properties . 16.6 The history of undefined and null . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 119 . 120 . 120 . 120 . 121 . 121 . 121 . 122 . 122 . 122 . 123 . 124 . 125  Many programming languages have one “non-value” called null. It indicates that a vari- able does not currently point to an object – for example, when it hasn’t been initialized yet. In contrast, JavaScript has two of them: undefined and null.  16.1 undefined vs. null Both values are very similar and often used interchangeably. How they differ is therefore subtle. The language itself makes the following distinction:    undefined means “not initialized”  e.g., a variable  or “not existing”  e.g., a prop-  erty of an object .  119   120  16 The non-values undefined and null    null means “the intentional absence of any object value”  a quote from the lan-  guage speciﬁcation .  Programmers may make the following distinction:  etc. .    undefined is the non-value used by the language  when something is uninitialized,    null means “explicitly switched off”. That is, it helps implement a type that com- prises both meaningful values and a meta-value that stands for “no meaningful value”. Such a type is called option type or maybe type in functional programming.  16.2 Occurrences of undefined and null The following subsections describe where undefined and null appear in the language. We’ll encounter several mechanisms that are explained in more detail later in this book.  16.2.1 Occurrences of undefined Uninitialized variable myVar:  let myVar; assert.equal myVar, undefined ;  Parameter x is not provided:  function func x  {  return x;  } assert.equal func  , undefined ;  Property .unknownProp is missing:  const obj = {}; assert.equal obj.unknownProp, undefined ;  If we don’t explicitly specify the result of a function via a return statement, JavaScript returns undefined for us: function func   {} assert.equal func  , undefined ;  16.2.2 Occurrences of null The prototype of an object is either an object or, at the end of a chain of prototypes, null. Object.prototype does not have a prototype:  > Object.getPrototypeOf Object.prototype  null  If we match a regular expression  such as  a   against a string  such as 'x' , we either get an object with matching data  if matching was successful  or null  if matching failed :  >  a .exec 'x'  null   16.3 Checking for undefined or null  121  The JSON data format does not support undefined, only null:  > JSON.stringify {a: undefined, b: null}  '{"b":null}'  16.3 Checking for undefined or null Checking for either:  if  x === null  ··· if  x === undefined  ···  Does x have a value?  if  x !== undefined && x !== null  {     ···  } if  x  {    truthy?     x is neither: undefined, null, false, 0, NaN, ''  Is x either undefined or null?  if  x === undefined  x === null  {     ···  } if  !x  {    falsy?     x is: undefined, null, false, 0, NaN, ''  }  }  Truthy means “is true if coerced to boolean”. Falsy means “is false if coerced to boolean”. Both concepts are explained properly in §17.2 “Falsy and truthy values”.  16.4 The nullish coalescing operator  ??  for default val-  ues [ES2020]  Sometimes we receive a value and only want to use it if it isn’t either null or undefined. Otherwise, we’d like to use a default value, as a fallback. We can do that via the nullish coalescing operator  ?? :  const valueToUse = receivedValue ?? defaultValue;  The following two expressions are equivalent:  a ?? b a !== undefined && a !== null ? a : b  16.4.1 Example: counting matches The following code shows a real-world example:   }  }  }  122  16 The non-values undefined and null  function countMatches regex, str  {  const matchResult = str.match regex ;    null or Array return  matchResult ?? [] .length;  assert.equal   assert.equal   assert.equal   countMatches  a g, 'ababa' , 3 ;  countMatches  b g, 'ababa' , 2 ;  countMatches  x g, 'ababa' , 0 ;  If there are one or more matches for regex inside str, then .match   returns an Array. If there are no matches, it unfortunately returns null  and not the empty Array . We ﬁx that via the ?? operator. We also could have used optional chaining:  return matchResult?.length ?? 0;  16.4.2 Example: specifying a default value for a property  function getTitle fileDesc  {  return fileDesc.title ?? ' Untitled ';  const files = [  {path: 'index.html', title: 'Home'}, {path: 'tmp.html'},  ]; assert.deepEqual   files.map f => getTitle f  , ['Home', ' Untitled '] ;  16.4.3 Using destructuring for default values In some cases, destructuring can also be used for default values – for example:  function getTitle fileDesc  {  const {title = ' Untitled '} = fileDesc; return title;  16.4.4 Legacy approach: using logical Or    for default values Before ECMAScript 2020 and the nullish coalescing operator, logical Or was used for default values. That has a downside.  works as expected for undefined and null:   16.4 The nullish coalescing operator  ??  for default values [ES2020]  123  But it also returns the default for all other falsy values – for example:  > undefined  'default' 'default' > null  'default' 'default'  > false  'default' 'default' > 0  'default' 'default' > 0n  'default' 'default' > ''  'default' 'default'  Compare that to how ?? works: > undefined ?? 'default' 'default' > null ?? 'default' 'default'  > false ?? 'default' false > 0 ?? 'default' 0 > 0n ?? 'default' 0n > '' ?? 'default' ''  16.4.5 The nullish coalescing assignment operator  ??=  ??= is a logical assignment operator. The following two expressions are roughly equiva- lent:  That means that ??= is short-circuiting: The assignment is only made if a is undefined or null.  16.4.5.1 Example: using ??= to add missing properties  a ??= b a ??  a = b   const books = [  isbn: '123',  {  }, {  title: 'ECMAScript Language Specification',   16 The non-values undefined and null  isbn: '456',  124  },  ];  }     Add property .title where it’s missing for  const book of books  {  book.title ??= ' Untitled ';  assert.deepEqual   isbn: '123', title: ' Untitled ',  books, [  {  }, {  }, ] ;  title: 'ECMAScript Language Specification', isbn: '456',  16.5 undefined and null don’t have properties undefined and null are the only two JavaScript values where we get an exception if we try to read a property. To explore this phenomenon, let’s use the following function, which reads  “gets”  property .foo and returns the result.  function getFoo x  {  return x.foo;  }  If we apply getFoo   to various values, we can see that it only fails for undefined and null:  > getFoo undefined  TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined > getFoo null  TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of null  > getFoo true  undefined > getFoo {}  undefined   16.6 The history of undefined and null 16.6 The history of undefined and null In Java  which inspired many aspects of JavaScript , initialization values depend on the static type of a variable:  125    Variables with object types are initialized with null.   Each primitive type has its own initialization value. For example, int variables  are initialized with 0.  In JavaScript, each variable can hold both object values and primitive values. Therefore, if null means “not an object”, JavaScript also needs an initialization value that means “neither an object nor a primitive value”. That initialization value is undefined.

Boolean x   Most descriptive; recommended.    x ? true : false    !!x  Uses the conditional operator  explained later in this chapter .  Uses the logical Not operator  ! . This operator coerces its operand to boolean. It is applied a second time to get a non-negated result.  Tbl. 17.1 describes how various values are converted to boolean. Table 17.1: Converting values to booleans.  x  Boolean x   undefined null boolean number  bigint  string  symbol object  false false x  no change  0 → false, NaN → false Other numbers → true 0 → false Other numbers → true '' → false Other strings → true true Always true  17.2 Falsy and truthy values When checking the condition of an if statement, a while loop, or a do-while loop, JavaScript works differently than you may expect. Take, for example, the following condition:  if  value  {}  In many programming languages, this condition is equivalent to:  if  value === true  {}  However, in JavaScript, it is equivalent to:  if  Boolean value  === true  {}  That is, JavaScript checks if value is true when converted to boolean. This kind of check is so common that the following names were introduced:    A value is called truthy if it is true when converted to boolean.   A value is called falsy if it is false when converted to boolean.  Each value is either truthy or falsy. Consulting tbl. 17.1, we can make an exhaustive list of falsy values:   17.3 Truthiness-based existence checks  129  All other values  including all objects  are truthy:  17.2.1 Checking for truthiness or falsiness    undefined   null   Boolean: false   Numbers: 0, NaN   Bigint: 0n   String: ''  > Boolean 'abc'  true > Boolean []  true > Boolean {}  true  if  x  {     x is truthy  if  !x  {     x is falsy  if  x  {  } else {     x is truthy     x is falsy  }  }  }  const result = x ? 'truthy' : 'falsy';  The conditional operator that is used in the last line, is explained later in this chapter.  Exercise: Truthiness  exercises booleans truthiness_exrc.mjs  17.3 Truthiness-based existence checks In JavaScript, if you read something that doesn’t exist  e.g., a missing parameter or a missing property , you usually get undefined as a result. In these cases, an existence check amounts to comparing a value with undefined. For example, the following code checks if object obj has the property .prop:  if  obj.prop !== undefined  {     obj has property .prop   130  17 Booleans  }  }  }  }  }  Due to undefined being falsy, we can shorten this check to:  if  obj.prop  {     obj has property .prop  17.3.1 Pitfall: truthiness-based existence checks are imprecise Truthiness-based existence checks have one pitfall: they are not very precise. Consider this previous example:  if  obj.prop  {     obj has property .prop  The body of the if statement is skipped if:    obj.prop is missing  in which case, JavaScript returns undefined .  However, it is also skipped if:   obj.prop is undefined.   obj.prop is any other falsy value  null, 0, '', etc. .  In practice, this rarely causes problems, but you have to be aware of this pitfall.  17.3.2 Use case: was a parameter provided? A truthiness check is often used to determine if the caller of a function provided a param- eter:  function func x  {  if  !x  {  }    ···  throw new Error 'Missing parameter x' ;  On the plus side, this pattern is established and short. It correctly throws errors for un- defined and null. On the minus side, there is the previously mentioned pitfall: the code also throws errors for all other falsy values. An alternative is to check for undefined:  if  x === undefined  {  throw new Error 'Missing parameter x' ;   17.4 Conditional operator  ? :   131  17.3.3 Use case: does a property exist? Truthiness checks are also often used to determine if a property exists:  function readFile fileDesc  {  if  !fileDesc.path  {  throw new Error 'Missing property: .path' ;  }    ···  } readFile { path: 'foo.txt' } ;    no error  This pattern is also established and has the usual caveat: it not only throws if the property is missing, but also if it exists and has any of the falsy values. If you truly want to check if the property exists, you have to use the in operator:  if  !  'path' in fileDesc   {  throw new Error 'Missing property: .path' ;  }  17.4 Conditional operator  ? :  The conditional operator is the expression version of the if statement. Its syntax is:  «condition» ? «thenExpression» : «elseExpression»  It is evaluated as follows:    If condition is truthy, evaluate and return thenExpression.   Otherwise, evaluate and return elseExpression.  The conditional operator is also called ternary operator because it has three operands. Examples:  > true ? 'yes' : 'no' 'yes' > false ? 'yes' : 'no' 'no' > '' ? 'yes' : 'no' 'no'     Output:    'then'  The following code demonstrates that whichever of the two branches “then” and “else” is chosen via the condition, only that branch is evaluated. The other branch isn’t.  const x =  true ? console.log 'then'  : console.log 'else'  ;   132 17 Booleans 17.5 Binary logical operators: And  x && y , Or  x  y  The binary logical operators && and  are value-preserving and short-circuiting.  17.5.1 Value-preservation Value-preservation means that operands are interpreted as booleans but returned unchanged:  > 12  'hello' 12 > 0  'hello' 'hello'  17.5.2 Short-circuiting Short-circuiting means if the ﬁrst operand already determines the result, then the second operand is not evaluated. The only other operator that delays evaluating its operands is the conditional operator. Usually, all operands are evaluated before performing an operation. For example, logical And  &&  does not evaluate its second operand if the ﬁrst one is falsy:  const x = false && console.log 'hello' ;    No output  If the ﬁrst operand is truthy, console.log   is executed:  const x = true && console.log 'hello' ;     Output:    'hello'  17.5.3 Logical And  x && y  The expression a && b  “a And b”  is evaluated as follows:  1. Evaluate a. 2. Is the result falsy? Return it. 3. Otherwise, evaluate b and return the result.  In other words, the following two expressions are roughly equivalent:  a && b !a ? a : b  Examples:  > false && true false > false && 'abc' false   17.5 Binary logical operators: And  x && y , Or  x  y   133  17.5.4 Logical Or    The expression a  b  “a Or b”  is evaluated as follows:  1. Evaluate a. 2. Is the result truthy? Return it. 3. Otherwise, evaluate b and return the result.  In other words, the following two expressions are roughly equivalent:  > true && false false > true && 'abc' 'abc'  > '' && 'abc' ''  a  b a ? a : b  Examples:  > true  false true > true  'abc' true  > false  true true > false  'abc' 'abc'  > 'abc'  'def' 'abc'  17.5.4.1 Legacy use case for logical Or   : providing default values ECMAScript 2020 introduced the nullish coalescing operator  ??  for default values. Be- fore that, logical Or was used for this purpose:  const valueToUse = receivedValue  defaultValue;  See §16.4 “The nullish coalescing operator  ??  for default values [ES2020]” for more information on ?? and the downsides of  in this case.

Bigints represent integers with an arbitrary precision.  This chapter covers numbers. Bigints are covered later in this book.  18.1 Numbers are used for both ﬂoating point numbers  and integers  The type number is used for both integers and ﬂoating point numbers in JavaScript:  98 123.45  > 98 === 98.0 true  However, all numbers are doubles, 64-bit ﬂoating point numbers implemented according to the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic  IEEE 754 . Integer numbers are simply ﬂoating point numbers without a decimal fraction:  Note that, under the hood, most JavaScript engines are often able to use real integers, with all associated performance and storage size beneﬁts.  18.2 Number literals Let’s examine literals for numbers.  Integer literals  18.2.1 Several integer literals let us express integers with various bases:     Binary  base 2  assert.equal 0b11, 3 ;    ES6     Octal  base 8  assert.equal 0o10, 8 ;    ES6     Decimal  base 10  assert.equal 35, 35 ;   18.2 Number literals  137     Hexadecimal  base 16  assert.equal 0xE7, 231 ;  18.2.2 Floating point literals Floating point numbers can only be expressed in base 10. Fractions: > 35.0 35  Exponent: eN means ×10N  > 3e2 300 > 3e-2 0.03 > 0.3e2 30  18.2.3 Syntactic pitfall: properties of integer literals Accessing a property of an integer literal entails a pitfall: If the integer literal is immedi- ately followed by a dot, then that dot is interpreted as a decimal dot:  7.toString  ;    syntax error  There are four ways to work around this pitfall:  7.0.toString    7 .toString   7..toString   7 .toString       space before dot  18.2.4 Underscores  _  as separators in number literals [ES2021] Grouping digits to make long numbers more readable has a long tradition. For example:    In 1825, London had 1,335,000 inhabitants.   The distance between Earth and Sun is 149,600,000 km.  Since ES2021, we can use underscores as separators in number literals:  const inhabitantsOfLondon = 1_335_000; const distanceEarthSunInKm = 149_600_000;  With other bases, grouping is important, too:  const fileSystemPermission = 0b111_111_000; const bytes = 0b1111_10101011_11110000_00001101; const words = 0xFAB_F00D;  We can also use the separator in fractions and exponents:   138  18 Numbers  const massOfElectronInKg = 9.109_383_56e-31; const trillionInShortScale = 1e1_2;  18.2.4.1 Where can we put separators? The locations of separators are restricted in two ways:    We can only put underscores between two digits. Therefore, all of the following  number literals are illegal:  3_.141 3._141  1_e12 1e_12  _1464301 1464301_  0_b111111000 0b_111111000     valid variable name!    We can’t use more than one underscore in a row:  123__456    two underscores – not allowed  The motivation behind these restrictions is to keep parsing simple and to avoid strange edge cases.  18.2.4.2 Parsing numbers with separators The following functions for parsing numbers do not support separators:    Number     parseInt     parseFloat    For example:  > Number '123_456'  NaN > parseInt '123_456'  123  The rationale is that numeric separators are for code. Other kinds of input should be processed differently.  18.3 Arithmetic operators 18.3.1 Binary arithmetic operators Tbl. 18.1 lists JavaScript’s binary arithmetic operators.   18.3 Arithmetic operators  139  Table 18.1: Binary arithmetic operators.  Operator Name n + m n - m n * m n   m n % m  Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Remainder  ES1 ES1 ES1 ES1 ES1  n ** m  Exponentiation  ES2016  Example 3 + 4 → 7 9 - 1 → 8 3 * 2.25 → 6.75 5.625   5 → 1.125 8 % 5 → 3 -8 % 5 → -3 4 ** 2 → 16  18.3.1.1 % is a remainder operator % is a remainder operator, not a modulo operator. operand:  Its result has the sign of the ﬁrst  For more information on the difference between remainder and modulo, see the blog post “Remainder operator vs. modulo operator  with JavaScript code ” on 2ality.  18.3.2 Unary plus  +  and negation  -  Tbl. 18.2 summarizes the two operators unary plus  +  and negation  - .  Table 18.2: The operators unary plus  +  and negation  - .  Operator Name +n -n  Unary plus Unary negation  ES1 ES1  Example + -7  → -7 - -7  → 7  Both operators coerce their operands to numbers:  > 5 % 3 2 > -5 % 3 -2  > +'5' 5 > +'-12' -12 > -'9' -9  Thus, unary plus lets us convert arbitrary values to numbers.   140  18 Numbers  Incrementing  ++  and decrementing  --   18.3.3 The incrementation operator ++ exists in a preﬁx version and a sufﬁx version. In both ver- sions, it destructively adds one to its operand. Therefore, its operand must be a storage location that can be changed. The decrementation operator -- works the same, but subtracts one from its operand. The next two examples explain the difference between the preﬁx and the sufﬁx version. Tbl. 18.3 summarizes the incrementation and decrementation operators.  Table 18.3: Incrementation operators and decrementation operators.  Operator Name v++ ++v v-- --v  Increment Increment Decrement Decrement  ES1 ES1 ES1 ES1  Example let v=0; [v++, v] → [0, 1] let v=0; [++v, v] → [1, 1] let v=1; [v--, v] → [1, 0] let v=1; [--v, v] → [0, 0]  Next, we’ll look at examples of these operators in use. Preﬁx ++ and preﬁx -- change their operands and then return them.  Sufﬁx ++ and sufﬁx -- return their operands and then change them.  let foo = 3; assert.equal ++foo, 4 ; assert.equal foo, 4 ;  let bar = 3; assert.equal --bar, 2 ; assert.equal bar, 2 ;  let foo = 3; assert.equal foo++, 3 ; assert.equal foo, 4 ;  let bar = 3; assert.equal bar--, 3 ; assert.equal bar, 2 ;  18.3.3.1 Operands: not just variables We can also apply these operators to property values:  const obj = { a: 1 }; ++obj.a; assert.equal obj.a, 2 ;  And to Array elements:   141  18.4 Converting to number  const arr = [ 4 ]; arr[0]++; assert.deepEqual arr, [5] ;  Exercise: Number operators  exercises numbers-math is_odd_test.mjs  18.4 Converting to number These are three ways of converting values to numbers:    Number value    +value   parseFloat value   avoid; different than the other two!   Recommendation: use the descriptive Number  . Tbl. 18.4 summarizes how it works.  Table 18.4: Converting values to numbers.  x  Number x   undefined null boolean number bigint string  symbol object  NaN +0 false → +0, true → 1 x  no change  Throws TypeError '' → +0 Other → parsed number, ignoring leading trailing whitespace Throws TypeError Conﬁgurable  e.g. via .valueOf     Examples:  assert.equal Number 123.45 , 123.45 ;  assert.equal Number '' , 0 ; assert.equal Number '\n 123.45 \t' , 123.45 ; assert.equal Number 'xyz' , NaN ;  > Number { valueOf   { return 123 } }  123  Exercise: Converting to number  How objects are converted to numbers can be conﬁgured – for example, by overriding .valueOf  :   142  18 Numbers  exercises numbers-math parse_number_test.mjs  18.5 Error values Two number values are returned when errors happen:    NaN   Infinity  18.5.1 Error value: NaN NaN is an abbreviation of “not a number”. Ironically, JavaScript considers it to be a num- ber:  > typeof NaN 'number'  When is NaN returned? NaN is returned if a number can’t be parsed:  NaN is returned if an operation can’t be performed:  NaN is returned if an operand or argument is NaN  to propagate errors :  > Number '$$$'  NaN > Number undefined  NaN  > Math.log -1  NaN > Math.sqrt -1  NaN  > NaN - 3 NaN > 7 ** NaN NaN  18.5.1.1 Checking for NaN NaN is the only JavaScript value that is not strictly equal to itself:  const n = NaN; assert.equal n === n, false ;  These are several ways of checking if a value x is NaN:  const x = NaN;  assert.equal Number.isNaN x , true ;    preferred assert.equal Object.is x, NaN , true ; assert.equal x !== x, true ;   18.5 Error values  143  In the last line, we use the comparison quirk to detect NaN.  Alas, there is no simple rule of thumb. We have to check for each method how it handles NaN.  18.5.1.2 Finding NaN in Arrays Some Array methods can’t ﬁnd NaN:  > [NaN].indexOf NaN  -1  Others can:  > [NaN].includes NaN  true > [NaN].findIndex x => Number.isNaN x   0 > [NaN].find x => Number.isNaN x   NaN  18.5.2 Error value: Infinity When is the error value Infinity returned? Inﬁnity is returned if a number is too large:  > Math.pow 2, 1023  8.98846567431158e+307 > Math.pow 2, 1024  Infinity  Inﬁnity is returned if there is a division by zero:  > 5   0 Infinity > -5   0 -Infinity  function findMinimum numbers  {  let min = Infinity; for  const n of numbers  {  if  n < min  min = n;  } return min;  }  assert.equal findMinimum [5, -1, 2] , -1 ; assert.equal findMinimum [] , Infinity ;  18.5.2.1 Infinity as a default value Infinity is larger than all other numbers  except NaN , making it a good default value:   144  18 Numbers  18.5.2.2 Checking for Infinity These are two common ways of checking if a value x is Infinity:  const x = Infinity;  assert.equal x === Infinity, true ; assert.equal Number.isFinite x , false ;  Exercise: Comparing numbers  exercises numbers-math find_max_test.mjs  18.6 The precision of numbers: careful with decimal frac-  tions  Internally, JavaScript ﬂoating point numbers are represented with base 2  according to the IEEE 754 standard . That means that decimal fractions  base 10  can’t always be represented precisely:  > 0.1 + 0.2 0.30000000000000004 > 1.3 * 3 3.9000000000000004 > 1.4 * 100000000000000 139999999999999.98  We therefore need to take rounding errors into consideration when performing arith- metic in JavaScript. Read on for an explanation of this phenomenon.

It uses three integers to do so, which take up a total of 64 bits of storage  double precision :  Component Sign Fraction Exponent  Size 1 bit 52 bits 11 bits  Integer range [0, 1] [0, 252−1] [−1023, 1024]  The ﬂoating point number represented by these integers is computed as follows:   –1 sign × 0b1.fraction × 2exponent  This representation can’t encode a zero because its second component  involving the fraction  always has a leading 1. Therefore, a zero is encoded via the special exponent −1023 and a fraction 0.  18.8.1 A simpliﬁed representation of ﬂoating point numbers To make further discussions easier, we simplify the previous representation:    Instead of base 2  binary , we use base 10  decimal  because that’s what most peo-  ple are more familiar with.    The fraction is a natural number that is interpreted as a fraction  digits after a point . We switch to a mantissa, an integer that is interpreted as itself. As a consequence, the exponent is used differently, but its fundamental role doesn’t change.    As the mantissa is an integer  with its own sign , we don’t need a separate sign,  anymore.  The new representation works like this:  mantissa × 10exponent  Let’s try out this representation for a few ﬂoating point numbers.    For the integer −123, we mainly need the mantissa:    For the number 1.5, we imagine there being a point after the mantissa. We use a  negative exponent to move that point one digit to the left:    For the number 0.25, we move the point two digits to the left:  Representations with negative exponents can also be written as fractions with positive exponents in the denominators:  > -123 *  10 ** 0  -123  > 15 *  10 ** -1  1.5  > 25 *  10 ** -2  0.25   146  18 Numbers  > 15 *  10 ** -1  === 15    10 ** 1  true > 25 *  10 ** -2  === 25    10 ** 2  true  These fractions help with understanding why there are numbers that our encoding can- not represent:    1 10 can be represented. It already has the required format: a power of 10 in the  denominator.    1 2 can be represented as 5 10. We turned the 2 in the denominator into a power  of 10 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 5.    1 4 can be represented as 25 100. We turned the 4 in the denominator into a power  of 10 by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 25.    1 3 cannot be represented. There is no way to turn the denominator into a power of 10.  The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5. Therefore, any denominator that only has these prime factors can be converted to a power of 10, by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by enough twos and ﬁves. If a denominator has a different prime factor, then there’s nothing we can do.   To conclude our excursion, we switch back to base 2:    0.5 = 1 2 can be represented with base 2 because the denominator is already a    0.25 = 1 4 can be represented with base 2 because the denominator is already a    0.1 = 1 10 cannot be represented because the denominator cannot be converted    0.2 = 2 10 cannot be represented because the denominator cannot be converted  power of 2.  power of 2.  to a power of 2.  to a power of 2.  Now we can see why 0.1 + 0.2 doesn’t produce a correct result: internally, neither of the two operands can be represented precisely. The only way to compute precisely with decimal fractions is by internally switching to base 10. For many programming languages, base 2 is the default and base 10 an option. For example, Java has the class BigDecimal and Python has the module decimal. There are tentative plans to add something similar to JavaScript: the ECMAScript proposal “Decimal” is currently at stage 0.  Integer numbers in JavaScript  18.9 Integer numbers are normal  ﬂoating point  numbers without decimal fractions:  > 1 === 1.0 true > Number.isInteger 1.0  true   18.9 Integer numbers in JavaScript  147  In this section, we’ll look at a few tools for working with these pseudo-integers. JavaScript also supports bigints, which are real integers.  18.9.1 Converting to integer The recommended way of converting numbers to integers is to use one of the rounding methods of the Math object:    Math.floor n : returns the largest integer i ≤ n    Math.ceil n : returns the smallest integer i ≥ n    Math.round n : returns the integer that is “closest” to n with __.5 being rounded  > Math.floor 2.1  2 > Math.floor 2.9  2  > Math.ceil 2.1  3 > Math.ceil 2.9  3  up – for example:  > Math.round 2.4  2 > Math.round 2.5  3  turning it into an integer. > Math.trunc 2.1  2 > Math.trunc 2.9  2    Math.trunc n : removes any decimal fraction  after the point  that n has, therefore  For more information on rounding, consult §19.3 “Rounding”.  18.9.2 Ranges of integer numbers in JavaScript These are important ranges of integer numbers in JavaScript:    Safe integers: can be represented “safely” by JavaScript  more on what that means  in the next subsection   – Precision: 53 bits plus sign – Range:  −253, 253     Array indices  – Precision: 32 bits, unsigned – Range: [0, 232−1   excluding the maximum length  – Typed Arrays have a larger range of 53 bits  safe and unsigned     Bitwise operators  bitwise Or, etc.    148  18 Numbers  – Precision: 32 bits – Range of unsigned right shift  >>> : unsigned, [0, 232  – Range of all other bitwise operators: signed, [−231, 231   18.9.3 Safe integers This is the range of integer numbers that are safe in JavaScript  53 bits plus a sign :  [–253–1, 253–1]  An integer is safe if it is represented by exactly one JavaScript number. Given that JavaScript numbers are encoded as a fraction multiplied by 2 to the power of an exponent, higher integers can also be represented, but then there are gaps between them. For example  18014398509481984 is 254 :  > 18014398509481984 18014398509481984 > 18014398509481985 18014398509481984 > 18014398509481986 18014398509481984 > 18014398509481987 18014398509481988  The following properties of Number help determine if an integer is safe:  assert.equal Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER,  2 ** 53  - 1 ; assert.equal Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER, -Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ;  assert.equal Number.isSafeInteger 5 , true ; assert.equal Number.isSafeInteger '5' , false ; assert.equal Number.isSafeInteger 5.1 , false ; assert.equal Number.isSafeInteger Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER , true ; assert.equal Number.isSafeInteger Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER+1 , false ;  Exercise: Detecting safe integers  exercises numbers-math is_safe_integer_test.mjs  18.9.3.1 Safe computations Let’s look at computations involving unsafe integers. The following result is incorrect and unsafe, even though both of its operands are safe:  > 9007199254740990 + 3 9007199254740992  The following result is safe, but incorrect. The ﬁrst operand is unsafe; the second operand is safe:   18.10 Bitwise operators  > 9007199254740995 - 10 9007199254740986  149  Therefore, the result of an expression a op b is correct if and only if:  isSafeInteger a  && isSafeInteger b  && isSafeInteger a op b   That is, both operands and the result must be safe.  18.10 Bitwise operators 18.10.1 Internally, JavaScript’s bitwise operators work with 32-bit integers. They produce their results in the following steps:  Internally, bitwise operators work with 32-bit integers    Input  JavaScript numbers : The 1–2 operands are ﬁrst converted to JavaScript  numbers  64-bit ﬂoating point numbers  and then to 32-bit integers.

Each type is always one of the following two:  Type Int32 Uint32  Description signed 32-bit integer unsigned 32-bit integer  Size 32 bits incl. sign 32 bits  Range [−231, 231  [0, 232   Considering the previously mentioned steps, I recommend to pretend that bitwise oper- ators internally work with unsigned 32-bit integers  step “computation”  and that Int32 and Uint32 only affect how JavaScript numbers are converted to and from integers  steps “input” and “output” .  18.10.1.2 Displaying JavaScript numbers as unsigned 32-bit integers While exploring the bitwise operators, it occasionally helps to display JavaScript num- bers as unsigned 32-bit integers in binary notation. That’s what b32   does  whose im- plementation is shown later :  assert.equal   assert.equal   b32 -1 , '11111111111111111111111111111111' ;  b32 1 , '00000000000000000000000000000001' ;   150  18 Numbers  assert.equal   b32 2 ** 31 , '10000000000000000000000000000000' ;  18.10.2 Bitwise Not  Table 18.7: The bitwise Not operator.

The following code is an implementation of it:   ** * Return a string representing n as a 32-bit unsigned integer, * in binary notation. *  function b32 n  {     >>> ensures highest bit isn’t interpreted as a sign return  n >>> 0 .toString 2 .padStart 32, '0' ;  } assert.equal   b32 6 , '00000000000000000000000000000110' ;  n >>> 0 means that we are shifting n zero bits to the right. Therefore, in principle, the >>> operator does nothing, but it still coerces n to an unsigned 32-bit integer:  > 12 >>> 0 12 > -12 >>> 0 4294967284 >  2**32 + 1  >>> 0 1  18.11 Quick reference: numbers 18.11.1 Global functions for numbers JavaScript has the following four global functions for numbers:   152    isFinite     isNaN     parseFloat     parseInt    18 Numbers  However, it is better to use the corresponding methods of Number  Number.isFinite  , etc. , which have fewer pitfalls. They were introduced with ES6 and are discussed below.  18.11.2 Static properties of Number    .EPSILON: number [ES6]  The difference between 1 and the next representable ﬂoating point number. In general, a machine epsilon provides an upper bound for rounding errors in ﬂoating point arithmetic.  – Approximately: 2.2204460492503130808472633361816 × 10-16    .MAX_SAFE_INTEGER: number [ES6]  The largest integer that JavaScript can represent unambiguously  253−1 .    .MAX_VALUE: number [ES1]  The largest positive ﬁnite JavaScript number.  – Approximately: 1.7976931348623157 × 10308    .MIN_SAFE_INTEGER: number [ES6]  The smallest integer that JavaScript can represent unambiguously  −253+1 .    .MIN_VALUE: number [ES1]  The smallest positive JavaScript number. Approximately 5 × 10−324.    .NaN: number [ES1]  The same as the global variable NaN.   .NEGATIVE_INFINITY: number [ES1]  The same as -Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY.    .POSITIVE_INFINITY: number [ES1]  The same as the global variable Infinity.  18.11.3 Static methods of Number    .isFinite num: number : boolean [ES6]  > Number.isFinite Infinity  false > Number.isFinite -Infinity  false  Returns true if num is an actual number  neither Infinity nor -Infinity nor NaN .   18.11 Quick reference: numbers  153    .isInteger num: number : boolean [ES6]  Returns true if num is a number and does not have a decimal fraction.  > Number.isFinite NaN  false > Number.isFinite 123  true  > Number.isInteger -17  true > Number.isInteger 33  true > Number.isInteger 33.1  false > Number.isInteger '33'  false > Number.isInteger NaN  false > Number.isInteger Infinity  false    .isNaN num: number : boolean [ES6] Returns true if num is the value NaN:  > Number.isNaN NaN  true > Number.isNaN 123  false > Number.isNaN 'abc'  false    .isSafeInteger num: number : boolean [ES6]  Returns true if num is a number and unambiguously represents an integer.    .parseFloat str: string : number [ES6]  Coerces its parameter to string and parses it as a ﬂoating point number. For con- verting strings to numbers, Number    which ignores leading and trailing white- space  is usually a better choice than Number.parseFloat    which ignores leading whitespace and illegal trailing characters and can hide problems .  > Number.parseFloat ' 123.4'  123.4 > Number ' 123.4'  NaN    .parseInt str: string, radix=10 : number [ES6]  Coerces its parameter to string and parses it as an integer, ignoring leading white- space and illegal trailing characters:   154  18 Numbers  The parameter radix speciﬁes the base of the number to be parsed:  > Number.parseInt ' 123'  123  > Number.parseInt '101', 2  5 > Number.parseInt 'FF', 16  255  Do not use this method to convert numbers to integers: coercing to string is inefﬁ- cient. And stopping before the ﬁrst non-digit is not a good algorithm for removing the fraction of a number. Here is an example where it goes wrong:  > Number.parseInt 1e21, 10     wrong 1  It is better to use one of the rounding functions of Math to convert a number to an integer:  > Math.trunc 1e21     correct 1e+21  18.11.4 Methods of Number.prototype  Number.prototype is where the methods of numbers are stored.    .toExponential fractionDigits?: number : string [ES3]  Returns a string that represents the number via exponential notation. With frac- tionDigits, we can specify, how many digits should be shown of the number that is multiplied with the exponent  the default is to show as many digits as necessary . Example: number too small to get a positive exponent via .toString  .  > 1234..toString   '1234'  > 1234..toExponential      3 fraction digits '1.234e+3' > 1234..toExponential 5  '1.23400e+3' > 1234..toExponential 1  '1.2e+3'  > 0.003.toString   '0.003' > 0.003.toExponential   '3e-3'    .toFixed fractionDigits=0 : string [ES3]  Example: fraction not small enough to get a negative exponent via .toString  .   18.11 Quick reference: numbers  155  Returns an exponent-free representation of the number, rounded to fractionDig- its digits.  > 0.00000012.toString      with exponent '1.2e-7'  > 0.00000012.toFixed 10     no exponent '0.0000001200' > 0.00000012.toFixed   '0'  If the number is 1021 or greater, even .toFixed   uses an exponent:  >  10 ** 21 .toFixed   '1e+21'    .toPrecision precision?: number : string [ES3]  Works like .toString  , but precision speciﬁes how many digits should be shown. If precision is missing, .toString   is used.     requires exponential notation  > 1234..toPrecision 3  '1.23e+3'  > 1234..toPrecision 4  '1234'  > 1234..toPrecision 5  '1234.0'  > 1.234.toPrecision 3  '1.23'    .toString radix=10 : string [ES1]  Returns a string representation of the number. By default, we get a base 10 numeral as a result:  > 123.456.toString   '123.456'  If we want the numeral to have a different base, we can specify it via radix:  > 4..toString 2     binary  base 2  '100' > 4.5.toString 2  '100.1'  > 255..toString 16     hexadecimal  base 16  'ff' > 255.66796875.toString 16  'ff.ab'   156  18 Numbers  > 1234567890..toString 36  'kf12oi'  parseInt   provides the inverse operation: it converts a string that contains an integer  no fraction!  numeral with a given base, to a number.  > parseInt 'kf12oi', 36  1234567890  18.11.5 Sources    Wikipedia   TypeScript’s built-in typings   MDN web docs for JavaScript   ECMAScript language speciﬁcation  Quiz: advanced  See quiz app.   Chapter 19  Math  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  19.1 Data properties . . 19.2 Exponents, roots, logarithms . 19.3 Rounding . . . . 19.4 Trigonometric Functions . 19.5 Various other functions . . . . . 19.6 Sources .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . 157 . 158 . 159 . 160 . 162 . 163  Math is an object with data properties and methods for processing numbers.

Before ECMAScript 2020, JavaScript handled integers as follows:    There only was a single type for ﬂoating point numbers and integers: 64-bit ﬂoat-  ing point numbers  IEEE 754 double precision .    Under the hood, most JavaScript engines transparently supported integers: If a number has no decimal digits and is within a certain range, it can internally be stored as a genuine integer. This representation is called small integer and usually ﬁts into 32 bits. For example, the range of small integers on the 64-bit version of the V8 engine is from −231 to 231−1  source .    JavaScript numbers could also represent integers beyond the small integer range, as ﬂoating point numbers. Here, the safe range is plus minus 53 bits. For more information on this topic, see §18.9.3 “Safe integers”. Sometimes, we need more than signed 53 bits – for example:    Twitter uses 64-bit integers as IDs for tweets  source . In JavaScript, these IDs had  to be stored in strings.    Financial technology uses so-called big integers  integers with arbitrary precision  to represent amounts of money. Internally, the amounts are multiplied so that the decimal numbers disappear. For example, USD amounts are multiplied by 100 so that the cents disappear.  20.2 Bigints Bigint is a new primitive data type for integers. Bigints don’t have a ﬁxed storage size in bits; their sizes adapt to the integers they represent:    Small integers are represented with fewer bits than large integers.   There is no negative lower limit or positive upper limit for the integers that can be  A bigint literal is a sequence of one or more digits, sufﬁxed with an n – for example:  Operators such as - and * are overloaded and work with bigints:  Bigints are primitive values. typeof returns a new result for them:  represented.  123n  > 123n * 456n 56088n  > typeof 123n 'bigint'   20.2 Bigints  167  20.2.1 Going beyond 53 bits for integers JavaScript numbers are internally represented as a fraction multiplied by an exponent  see §18.8 “Background: ﬂoating point precision” for details . As a consequence, if we go beyond the highest safe integer 253−1, there are still some integers that can be represented, but with gaps between them:  > 2**53 - 2    safe 9007199254740990 > 2**53 - 1    safe 9007199254740991  > 2**53    unsafe, same as next integer 9007199254740992 > 2**53 + 1 9007199254740992 > 2**53 + 2 9007199254740994 > 2**53 + 3 9007199254740996 > 2**53 + 4 9007199254740996 > 2**53 + 5 9007199254740996  Bigints enable us to go beyond 53 bits:  > 2n**53n 9007199254740992n > 2n**53n + 1n 9007199254740993n > 2n**53n + 2n 9007199254740994n  20.2.2 Example: using bigints This is what using bigints looks like  code based on an example in the proposal :   ** * Takes a bigint as an argument and returns a bigint *  function nthPrime nth  {  if  typeof nth !== 'bigint'  {  throw new TypeError  ;  } function isPrime p  {  for  let i = 2n; i < p; i++  {  if  p % i === 0n  return false;  } return true;   168  20 Bigints – arbitrary-precision integers [ES2020]  advanced   } for  let i = 2n; ; i++  {  if  isPrime i   {  if  --nth === 0n  return i;  }  }  }   ;  assert.deepEqual   [1n, 2n, 3n, 4n, 5n].map nth => nthPrime nth  , [2n, 3n, 5n, 7n, 11n]  20.3 Bigint literals Like number literals, bigint literals support several bases:    Decimal: 123n   Hexadecimal: 0xFFn   Binary: 0b1101n   Octal: 0o777n  Negative bigints are produced by preﬁxing the unary minus operator: -0123n  20.3.1 Underscores  _  as separators in bigint literals [ES2021] Just like in number literals, we can use underscores  _  as separators in bigint literals:  const massOfEarthInKg = 6_000_000_000_000_000_000_000_000n;  Bigints are often used to represent money in the ﬁnancial technical sector. Separators can help here, too:  const priceInCents = 123_000_00;    123 thousand dollars  As with number literals, two restrictions apply:    We can only put an underscore between two digits.   We can use at most one underscore in a row.  20.4 Reusing number operators for bigints  overloading  With most operators, we are not allowed to mix bigints and numbers. If we do, excep- tions are thrown:  > 2n + 1 TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions  The reason for this rule is that there is no general way of coercing a number and a bigint to a common type: numbers can’t represent bigints beyond 53 bits, bigints can’t represent   20.4 Reusing number operators for bigints  overloading   169  fractions. Therefore, the exceptions warn us about typos that may lead to unexpected results. For example, should the result of the following expression be 9007199254740993n or 9007199254740992?  It is also not clear what the result of the following expression should be:  2**53 + 1n  2n**53n * 3.3  > 7n * 3n 21n  > 1n   2n 0n  > - -64n  64n  20.4.1 Arithmetic operators Binary +, binary -, *, ** work as expected:  It is OK to mix bigints and strings:  > 6n + ' apples' '6 apples'   , % round towards zero  like Math.trunc   :  Unary - works as expected:  Unary + is not supported for bigints because much code relies on it coercing its operand to number:  > +23n TypeError: Cannot convert a BigInt value to a number  20.4.2 Ordering operators Ordering operators  , >=, <= work as expected:  Comparing bigints and numbers does not pose any risks. Therefore, we can mix bigints and numbers:  > 17n <= 17n true > 3n > -1n true  > 3n > -1 true   170  20 Bigints – arbitrary-precision integers [ES2020]  advanced   20.4.3 Bitwise operators 20.4.3.1 Bitwise operators for numbers Bitwise operators interpret numbers as 32-bit integers. These integers are either unsigned or signed. If they are signed, the negative of an integer is its two’s complement  adding an integer to its two’s complement – while ignoring overﬂow – produces zero :  Due to these integers having a ﬁxed size, their highest bits indicate their signs:  > 2**32-1 >> 0 -1  > 2**31 >> 0    highest bit is 1 -2147483648 > 2**31 - 1 >> 0    highest bit is 0 2147483647  20.4.3.2 Bitwise operators for bigints For bigints, bitwise operators interpret a negative sign as an inﬁnite two’s complement – for example:    -1 is ···111111  ones extend inﬁnitely to the left    -2 is ···111110   -3 is ···111101   -4 is ···111100  That is, a negative sign is more of an external ﬂag and not represented as an actual bit.  20.4.3.3 Bitwise Not  ~  Bitwise Not  ~  inverts all bits:  > ~0b10n -3n > ~0n -1n > ~-2n 1n  >  0b1010n  '1111' >  0b1010n & '10'  0b0111n .toString 2   0b0111n .toString 2   >  0b1010n  -1n .toString 2  '-1'  20.4.3.4 Binary bitwise operators  &, , ^  Applying binary bitwise operators to bigints works analogously to applying them to numbers:   20.4 Reusing number operators for bigints  overloading   171  >  0b1010n & -1n .toString 2  '1010'  20.4.3.5 Bitwise signed shift operators   >  The signed shift operators for bigints preserve the sign of a number:  Recall that -1n is a sequence of ones that extends inﬁnitely to the left. That’s why shifting it left doesn’t change it:  20.4.3.6 Bitwise unsigned right shift operator  >>>  There is no unsigned right shift operator for bigints:  > 2n >>> 1n TypeError: BigInts have no unsigned right shift, use >> instead  Why? The idea behind unsigned right shifting is that a zero is shifted in “from the left”. In other words, the assumption is that there is a ﬁnite amount of binary digits. However, with bigints, there is no “left”, their binary digits extend inﬁnitely. This is especially important with negative numbers. Signed right shift works even with an inﬁnite number of digits because the highest digit is preserved. Therefore, it can be adapted to bigints.  20.4.4 Loose equality  ==  and inequality  !=  Loose equality  ==  and inequality  !=  coerce values:  > 2n << 1n 4n > -2n << 1n -4n  > 2n >> 1n 1n > -2n >> 1n -1n  > -1n >> 20n -1n  > 0n == false true > 1n == true true  > 123n == 123 true  > 123n == '123' true   172  20 Bigints – arbitrary-precision integers [ES2020]  advanced   20.4.5 Strict equality  ===  and inequality  !==  Strict equality  ===  and inequality  !==  only consider values to be equal if they have the same type:  > 123n === 123 false > 123n === 123n true  20.5 The wrapper constructor BigInt Analogously to numbers, bigints have the associated wrapper constructor BigInt.  20.5.1 BigInt as a constructor and as a function    new BigInt  : throws a TypeError.   BigInt x  converts arbitrary values x to bigint. This works similarly to Number  , with several differences which are summarized in tbl. 20.1 and explained in more detail in the following subsections.  Table 20.1: Converting values to bigints.  x  undefined null boolean number  bigint string  symbol object  BigInt x  Throws TypeError Throws TypeError false → 0n, true → 1n Example: 123 → 123n Non-integer → throws RangeError x  no change  Example: '123' → 123n Unparsable → throws SyntaxError Throws TypeError Conﬁgurable  e.g. via .valueOf     20.5.1.1 Converting undefined and null A TypeError is thrown if x is either undefined or null:  > BigInt undefined  TypeError: Cannot convert undefined to a BigInt > BigInt null  TypeError: Cannot convert null to a BigInt  20.5.1.2 Converting strings If a string does not represent an integer, BigInt   throws a SyntaxError  whereas Num- ber   returns the error value NaN :   20.5 The wrapper constructor BigInt  173  > BigInt 'abc'  SyntaxError: Cannot convert abc to a BigInt  The sufﬁx 'n' is not allowed:  > BigInt '123n'  SyntaxError: Cannot convert 123n to a BigInt  All bases of bigint literals are allowed:  > BigInt '123'  123n > BigInt '0xFF'  255n > BigInt '0b1101'  13n > BigInt '0o777'  511n  20.5.1.3 Non-integer numbers produce exceptions  > BigInt 123.45  RangeError: The number 123.45 cannot be converted to a BigInt because it is not an integer > BigInt 123  123n  20.5.1.4 Converting objects How objects are converted to bigints can be conﬁgured – for example, by overriding .valueOf  :  > BigInt {valueOf   {return 123n}}  123n  20.5.2 BigInt.prototype.* methods BigInt.prototype holds the methods “inherited” by primitive bigints:   BigInt.prototype.toLocaleString reserved1?, reserved2?

Casts theInt to width bits  signed . This inﬂuences how the value is represented internally.   174  20 Bigints – arbitrary-precision integers [ES2020]  advanced   20.5.4 Casting and 64-bit integers Casting allows us to create integer values with a speciﬁc number of bits. If we want to restrict ourselves to just 64-bit integers, we have to always cast:  const uint64a = BigInt.asUintN 64, 12345n ; const uint64b = BigInt.asUintN 64, 67890n ; const result = BigInt.asUintN 64, uint64a * uint64b ;  20.6 Coercing bigints to other primitive types This table show what happens if we convert bigints to other primitive types:  Convert to boolean  number string  Explicit conversion Boolean 0n  → false Boolean int  → true Number 7n  → 7  example  String 7n  → '7'  example   Coercion  implicit conversion  !0n → true !int → false +int → TypeError  1  ''+7n → '7'  example   Footnote:  ues     1  Unary + is not supported for bigints, because much code relies on it coercing  its operand to number.  20.7 TypedArrays and DataView operations for 64-bit val-  Thanks to bigints, Typed Arrays and DataViews can support 64-bit values:    Typed Array constructors:  – BigInt64Array – BigUint64Array    DataView methods:  – DataView.prototype.getBigInt64   – DataView.prototype.setBigInt64   – DataView.prototype.getBigUint64   – DataView.prototype.setBigUint64    20.8 Bigints and JSON The JSON standard is ﬁxed and won’t change. The upside is that old JSON parsing code will never be outdated. The downside is that JSON can’t be extended to contain bigints. Stringifying bigints throws exceptions:  > JSON.stringify 123n  TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt   20.9 FAQ: Bigints  175  > JSON.stringify [123n]  TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt  20.8.1 Stringifying bigints Therefore, our best option is to store bigints in strings:  const bigintPrefix = '[[bigint]]';  function bigintReplacer _key, value  {  if  typeof value === 'bigint'  {  return bigintPrefix + value;  } return value;  const data = { value: 9007199254740993n }; assert.equal   JSON.stringify data, bigintReplacer , '{"value":"[[bigint]]9007199254740993"}'  }   ;  }   ;  20.8.2 Parsing bigints The following code shows how to parse strings such as the one that we have produced in the previous example.  function bigintReviver _key, value  {  if  typeof value === 'string' && value.startsWith bigintPrefix   {  return BigInt value.slice bigintPrefix.length  ;  } return value;  const str = '{"value":"[[bigint]]9007199254740993"}'; assert.deepEqual   JSON.parse str, bigintReviver , { value: 9007199254740993n }  20.9 FAQ: Bigints 20.9.1 How do I decide when to use numbers and when to use bigints? My recommendations:    Use numbers for up to 53 bits and for Array indices. Rationale: They already appear everywhere and are handled efﬁciently by most engines  especially if they ﬁt into 31 bits . Appearances include:   176  20 Bigints – arbitrary-precision integers [ES2020]  advanced   – Array.prototype.forEach   – Array.prototype.entries      Use bigints for large numeric values: If your fraction-less values don’t ﬁt into 53  bits, you have no choice but to move to bigints.  All existing web APIs return and accept only numbers and will only upgrade to bigint on a case-by-case basis.  20.9.2 Why not just increase the precision of numbers in the same  manner as is done for bigints?  One could conceivably split number into integer and double, but that would add many new complexities to the language  several integer-only operators etc. . I’ve sketched the consequences in a Gist.

Virtually all modern software that works with text, supports Unicode. The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium. A new version of the standard is published every year  with new emojis, etc. . Unicode version 1.0.0 was published in October 1991.  21.1 Code points vs. code units Two concepts are crucial for understanding Unicode:    Code points are numbers that represent Unicode characters.   Code units are numbers that encode code points, to store or transmit Unicode text. One or more code units encode a single code point. Each code unit has the same size, which depends on the encoding format that is used. The most popular format, UTF-8, has 8-bit code units.  177   178  21 Unicode – a brief introduction  advanced   21.1.1 Code points The ﬁrst version of Unicode had 16-bit code points. Since then, the number of characters has grown considerably and the size of code points was extended to 21 bits. These 21 bits are partitioned in 17 planes, with 16 bits each:    Plane 0: Basic Multilingual Plane  BMP , 0x0000–0xFFFF  – Contains characters for almost all modern languages  Latin characters, Asian  characters, etc.  and many symbols.    Plane 1: Supplementary Multilingual Plane  SMP , 0x10000–0x1FFFF  – Supports historic writing systems  e.g., Egyptian hieroglyphs and cuneiform   and additional modern writing systems. – Supports emojis and many other symbols.    Plane 2: Supplementary Ideographic Plane  SIP , 0x20000–0x2FFFF  – Contains additional CJK  Chinese, Japanese, Korean  ideographs.    Plane 3–13: Unassigned   Plane 14: Supplementary Special-Purpose Plane  SSP , 0xE0000–0xEFFFF  – Contains non-graphical characters such as tag characters and glyph variation    Plane 15–16: Supplementary Private Use Area  S PUA A B , 0x0F0000–0x10FFFF – Available for character assignment by parties outside the ISO and the Uni-  code Consortium. Not standardized.  selectors.  Planes 1-16 are called supplementary planes or astral planes. Let’s check the code points of a few characters:  > 'A'.codePointAt 0 .toString 16  '41' > 'ü'.codePointAt 0 .toString 16  'fc' > 'π'.codePointAt 0 .toString 16  '3c0' > '☺'.codePointAt 0 .toString 16  '1f642'  The hexadecimal numbers of the code points tell us that the ﬁrst three characters reside in plane 0  within 16 bits , while the emoji resides in plane 1.  21.1.2 Encoding Unicode code points: UTF-32, UTF-16, UTF-8 The main ways of encoding code points are three Unicode Transformation Formats  UTFs : UTF-32, UTF-16, UTF-8. The number at the end of each format indicates the size  in bits  of its code units.  21.1.2.1 UTF-32  Unicode Transformation Format 32  UTF-32 uses 32 bits to store code units, resulting in one code unit per code point. This format is the only one with ﬁxed-length encoding; all others use a varying number of code units to encode a single code point.   21.1 Code points vs. code units  179  21.1.2.2 UTF-16  Unicode Transformation Format 16  UTF-16 uses 16-bit code units. It encodes code points as follows:    The BMP  ﬁrst 16 bits of Unicode  is stored in single code units.   Astral planes: The BMP comprises 0x10_000 code points. Given that Unicode has a total of 0x110_000 code points, we still need to encode the remaining 0x100_000 code points  20 bits . The BMP has two ranges of unassigned code points that provide the necessary storage:  – Most signiﬁcant 10 bits  leading surrogate : 0xD800-0xDBFF – Least signiﬁcant 10 bits  trailing surrogate : 0xDC00-0xDFFF  In other words, the two hexadecimal digits at the end contribute 8 bits. But we can only use those 8 bits if a BMP starts with one of the following 2-digit pairs:    D8, D9, DA, DB   DC, DD, DE, DF  Per surrogate, we have a choice between 4 pairs, which is where the remaining 2 bits come from. As a consequence, each UTF-16 code unit is always either a leading surrogate, a trailing surrogate, or encodes a BMP code point. These are two examples of UTF-16-encoded code points:    Code point 0x03C0  π  is in the BMP and can therefore be represented by a single    Code point 0x1F642  ☺  is in an astral plane and represented by two code units:  UTF-16 code unit: 0x03C0.  0xD83D and 0xDE42.  21.1.2.3 UTF-8  Unicode Transformation Format 8  UTF-8 has 8-bit code units. It uses 1–4 code units to encode a code point:  Code points 0000–007F 0080–07FF 0800–FFFF 10000–1FFFFF  Code units 0bbbbbbb  7 bits  110bbbbb, 10bbbbbb  5+6 bits  1110bbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb  4+6+6 bits  11110bbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb  3+6+6+6 bits   Notes:  Three examples:    The bit preﬁx of each code unit tells us:  – Is it ﬁrst in a series of code units? If yes, how many code units will follow? – Is it second or later in a series of code units?    The character mappings in the 0000–007F range are the same as ASCII, which leads  to a degree of backward compatibility with older software.   180  21 Unicode – a brief introduction  advanced   Character Code point Code units 01000001 A 11001111, 10000000 π 11110000, 10011111, 10011001, 10000010 ☺  0x0041 0x03C0 0x1F642  21.2 Encodings used in web development: UTF-16 and  UTF-8  The Unicode encoding formats that are used in web development are: UTF-16 and UTF- 8.  21.2.1 Source code internally: UTF-16 The ECMAScript speciﬁcation internally represents source code as UTF-16.  21.2.2 Strings: UTF-16 The characters in JavaScript strings are based on UTF-16 code units:  > const smiley = '☺'; > smiley.length 2 > smiley === '\uD83D\uDE42'    code units true  For more information on Unicode and strings, consult §22.6 “Atoms of text: Unicode characters, JavaScript characters, grapheme clusters”.  21.2.3 Source code in ﬁles: UTF-8 HTML and JavaScript are almost always encoded as UTF-8 these days. For example, this is how HTML ﬁles usually start now:            ···  For HTML modules loaded in web browsers, the standard encoding is also UTF-8.  21.3 Grapheme clusters – the real characters The concept of a character becomes remarkably complex once you consider many of the world’s writing systems. On one hand, there are Unicode characters, as represented by code points.   21.3 Grapheme clusters – the real characters  181  On the other hand, there are grapheme clusters. A grapheme cluster corresponds most closely to a symbol displayed on screen or paper. It is deﬁned as “a horizontally seg- mentable unit of text”. Therefore, ofﬁcial Unicode documents also call it a user-perceived character. One or more code point characters are needed to encode a grapheme cluster. For example, the Devanagari kshi is encoded by 4 code points. We use spreading  ...  to split a string into an Array with code point characters  for details, consult §22.6.1 “Work- ing with code points” :  Flag emojis are also grapheme clusters and composed of two code point characters – for example, the ﬂag of Japan:  More information on grapheme clusters  For more information, consult “Let’s Stop Ascribing Meaning to Code Points” by Manish Goregaokar.

The next chapter covers template literals, which give us:    String interpolation   Multiple lines   Raw string literals  backslash has no special meaning   22.1.1 Escaping The backslash lets us create special characters:    Unix line break: '\n'   Windows line break: '\r\n'   Tab: '\t'   Backslash: '\\'  assert.equal   'She said: "Let\'s go!"', "She said: \"Let's go!\"" ;  The backslash also lets us use the delimiter of a string literal inside that literal:  22.2 Accessing characters and code points 22.2.1 Accessing JavaScript characters JavaScript has no extra data type for characters – characters are always represented as strings.  const str = 'abc';     Reading a character at a given index assert.equal str[1], 'b' ;     Counting the characters in a string: assert.equal str.length, 3 ;  22.2.2 Accessing Unicode code point characters via for-of and spread-  ing  Iterating over strings via for-of or spreading  ...  visits Unicode code point characters. Each code point character is encoded by 1–2 JavaScript characters. For more information,   22.3 String concatenation via +  185  see §22.6 “Atoms of text: Unicode characters, JavaScript characters, grapheme clusters”. This is how we iterate over the code point characters of a string via for-of:  for  const ch of 'x☺y'  {  console.log ch ;  }    Output:    'x'    '☺'    'y'  And this is how we convert a string into an Array of code point characters via spreading:  assert.deepEqual [...'x☺y'], ['x', '☺', 'y'] ;  22.3 String concatenation via + If at least one operand is a string, the plus operator  +  converts any non-strings to strings and concatenates the result:  assert.equal 3 + ' times ' + 4, '3 times 4' ;  The assignment operator += is useful if we want to assemble a string, piece by piece:  let str = '';    must be `let`! str += 'Say it'; str += ' one more'; str += ' time';  assert.equal str, 'Say it one more time' ;  Concatenating via + is efﬁcient  Using + to assemble strings is quite efﬁcient because most JavaScript engines inter- nally optimize it.  Exercise: Concatenating strings  exercises strings concat_string_array_test.mjs  22.4 Converting to string These are three ways of converting a value x to a string:    String x    ''+x   x.toString    does not work for undefined and null    186  22 Strings  Recommendation: use the descriptive and safe String  . Examples:  assert.equal String undefined , 'undefined' ; assert.equal String null , 'null' ;  assert.equal String false , 'false' ; assert.equal String true , 'true' ;  assert.equal String 123.45 , '123.45' ;  Pitfall for booleans: If we convert a boolean to a string via String  , we generally can’t convert it back via Boolean  :  The only string for which Boolean   returns false, is the empty string.  22.4.1 Stringifying objects Plain objects have a default string representation that is not very useful:  Arrays have a better string representation, but it still hides much information:  > String false  'false' > Boolean 'false'  true  > String {a: 1}  '[object Object]'  > String ['a', 'b']  'a,b' > String ['a', ['b']]  'a,b'  > String [1, 2]  '1,2' > String ['1', '2']  '1,2'  > String [true]  'true' > String ['true']  'true' > String true  'true'  Stringifying functions, returns their source code:  > String function f   {return 4}  'function f   {return 4}'   22.5 Comparing strings  187  22.4.2 Customizing the stringiﬁcation of objects We can override the built-in way of stringifying objects by implementing the method toString  :  const obj = { toString   {  return 'hello';  }  };  assert.equal String obj , 'hello' ;  22.4.3 An alternate way of stringifying values The JSON data format is a text representation of JavaScript values. Therefore, JSON. stringify   can also be used to convert values to strings:  > JSON.stringify {a: 1}  '{"a":1}' > JSON.stringify ['a', ['b']]  '["a",["b"]]'  The caveat is that JSON only supports null, booleans, numbers, strings, Arrays, and objects  which it always treats as if they were created by object literals . Tip: The third parameter lets us switch on multiline output and specify how much to indent – for example:  console.log JSON.stringify {first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe'}, null, 2  ;  This statement produces the following output:  {  }  "first": "Jane", "last": "Doe"  22.5 Comparing strings Strings can be compared via the following operators:    >=  There is one important caveat to consider: These operators compare based on the nu- meric values of JavaScript characters. That means that the order that JavaScript uses for strings is different from the one used in dictionaries and phone books:  > 'A' < 'B'    ok true > 'a' < 'B'    not ok false   188  > 'ä' < 'b'    not ok false  22 Strings  Properly comparing text is beyond the scope of this book. It is supported via the ECMA- Script Internationalization API  Intl .  22.6 Atoms of text: Unicode characters, JavaScript charac-  ters, grapheme clusters  Quick recap of §21 “Unicode – a brief introduction”:  of 21 bits.    Unicode characters are represented by code points – numbers which have a range    In JavaScript strings, Unicode is implemented via code units based on the encoding format UTF-16. Each code unit is a 16-bit number. One to two of code units are needed to encode a single code point.  – Therefore, each JavaScript character is represented by a code unit.  In the JavaScript standard library, code units are also called char codes. Which is what they are: numbers for JavaScript characters.    Grapheme clusters  user-perceived characters  are written symbols, as displayed on screen or paper. One or more Unicode characters are needed to encode a single grapheme cluster.  The following code demonstrates that a single Unicode character comprises one or two JavaScript characters. We count the latter via .length:     3 Unicode characters, 3 JavaScript characters: assert.equal 'abc'.length, 3 ;     1 Unicode character, 2 JavaScript characters: assert.equal '☺'.length, 2 ;  The following table summarizes the concepts we have just explored:  Numeric representation  Entity Grapheme cluster Unicode character JavaScript character UTF-16 code unit  Code point  Size  21 bits 16 bits  Encoded via 1+ code points 1–2 code units –  22.6.1 Working with code points Let’s explore JavaScript’s tools for working with code points. A Unicode code point escape lets us specify a code point hexadecimally  1–5 digits . It pro- duces one or two JavaScript characters.  > '\u{1F642}' '☺'   22.6 Atoms of text: Unicode characters, JavaScript characters, grapheme clusters  189  Unicode escape sequences  In the ECMAScript language speciﬁcation, Unicode code point escapes and Unicode code unit escapes  which we’ll encounter later  are called Unicode escape sequences.  String.fromCodePoint   converts a single code point to 1–2 JavaScript characters:  .codePointAt   converts 1–2 JavaScript characters to a single code point:  > String.fromCodePoint 0x1F642  '☺'  > '☺'.codePointAt 0 .toString 16  '1f642'  We can iterate over a string, which visits Unicode characters  not JavaScript characters . Iteration is described later in this book. One way of iterating is via a for-of loop:  const str = '☺a'; assert.equal str.length, 3 ;  for  const codePointChar of str  {  console.log codePointChar ;  Spreading  ...  into Array literals is also based on iteration and visits Unicode characters:  That makes it a good tool for counting Unicode characters:  22.6.2 Working with code units  char codes  Indices and lengths of strings are based on JavaScript characters  as represented by UTF- 16 code units . To specify a code unit hexadecimally, we can use a Unicode code unit escape with exactly four hexadecimal digits:  }     Output:    '☺'    'a'  > [...'☺a'] [ '☺', 'a' ]  > [...'☺a'].length 2 > '☺a'.length 3  > '\uD83D\uDE42' '☺'   190  22 Strings  And we can use String.fromCharCode  . Char code is the standard library’s name for code unit:  > String.fromCharCode 0xD83D  + String.fromCharCode 0xDE42  '☺'  To get the char code of a character, use .charCodeAt  :  > '☺'.charCodeAt 0 .toString 16  'd83d'  22.6.3 ASCII escapes If the code point of a character is below 256, we can refer to it via a ASCII escape with exactly two hexadecimal digits:  > 'He\x6C\x6Co' 'Hello'   The ofﬁcial name of ASCII escapes is Hexadecimal escape sequences – it was the ﬁrst escape that used hexadecimal numbers.   22.6.4 Caveat: grapheme clusters When working with text that may be written in any human language, it’s best to split at the boundaries of grapheme clusters, not at the boundaries of Unicode characters. TC39 is working on Intl.Segmenter, a proposal for the ECMAScript Internationaliza- tion API to support Unicode segmentation  along grapheme cluster boundaries, word boundaries, sentence boundaries, etc. . Until that proposal becomes a standard, we can use one of several libraries that are avail- able  do a web search for “JavaScript grapheme” .  22.7 Quick reference: Strings Strings are immutable; none of the string methods ever modify their strings.  22.7.1 Converting to string Tbl. 22.2 describes how various values are converted to strings.  Table 22.2: Converting values to strings.  x  String x   undefined null boolean number bigint string  'undefined' 'null' false → 'false', true → 'true' Example: 123 → '123' Example: 123n → '123' x  input, unchanged    22.7 Quick reference: Strings  191  x symbol object  String x  Example: Symbol 'abc'  → 'Symbol abc ' Conﬁgurable via, e.g., toString    22.7.2 Numeric values of characters    Char code: represents a JavaScript character numerically. JavaScript’s name for  Unicode code unit.  – Size: 16 bits, unsigned – Convert number to character: String.fromCharCode   [ES1] – Convert character to number: string method .charCodeAt   [ES1]    Code point: represents a Unicode character numerically.  – Size: 21 bits, unsigned  17 planes, 16 bits each  – Convert number to character: String.fromCodePoint   [ES6] – Convert character to number: string method .codePointAt   [ES6]  22.7.3 String operators     Access characters via [] const str = 'abc'; assert.equal str[1], 'b' ;     Concatenate strings via + assert.equal 'a' + 'b' + 'c', 'abc' ; assert.equal 'take ' + 3 + ' oranges', 'take 3 oranges' ;  22.7.4 String.prototype: ﬁnding and matching  String.prototype is where the methods of strings are stored.     .endsWith searchString: string, endPos=this.length : boolean [ES6]  Returns true if the string would end with searchString if its length were endPos. Returns false otherwise.    .includes searchString: string, startPos=0 : boolean [ES6]  Returns true if the string contains the searchString and false otherwise. The search starts at startPos.  > 'foo.txt'.endsWith '.txt'  true > 'abcde'.endsWith 'cd', 4  true  > 'abc'.includes 'b'  true > 'abc'.includes 'b', 2  false   192  22 Strings    .indexOf searchString: string, minIndex=0 : number [ES1]  Returns the lowest index at which searchString appears within the string or -1, otherwise. Any returned index will beminIndex‘ or higher.    .lastIndexOf searchString: string, maxIndex=Infinity : number [ES1]  Returns the highest index at which searchString appears within the string or -1, otherwise. Any returned index will bemaxIndex‘ or lower.  > 'abab'.indexOf 'a'  0 > 'abab'.indexOf 'a', 1  2 > 'abab'.indexOf 'c'  -1  > 'abab'.lastIndexOf 'ab', 2  2 > 'abab'.lastIndexOf 'ab', 1  0 > 'abab'.lastIndexOf 'ab'  2    [1 of 2] .match regExp: string  RegExp : RegExpMatchArray  null [ES3]  If regExp is a regular expression with ﬂag  g not set, then .match   returns the ﬁrst match for regExp within the string. Or null if there is no match. If regExp is a string, it is used to create a regular expression  think parameter of new RegExp    before performing the previously mentioned steps. The result has the following type:  interface RegExpMatchArray extends Array  {  index: number; input: string; groups: undefined  {  [key: string]: string  };  }  Numbered capture groups become Array indices  which is why this type extends Array . Named capture groups  ES2018  become properties of .groups. In this mode, .match   works like RegExp.prototype.exec  . Examples:  > 'ababb'.match  a b+    { 0: 'ab', 1: 'b', index: 0, input: 'ababb', groups: undefined } > 'ababb'.match  a ? b+    { 0: 'ab', 1: 'b', index: 0, input: 'ababb', groups: { foo: 'b' } } > 'abab'.match  x   null   22.7 Quick reference: Strings  193    [2 of 2] .match regExp: RegExp : string[]  null [ES3]  If ﬂag  g of regExp is set, .match   returns either an Array with all matches or null if there was no match.    .search regExp: string  RegExp : number [ES3]  Returns the index at which regExp occurs within the string. If regExp is a string, it is used to create a regular expression  think parameter of new RegExp   .    .startsWith searchString: string, startPos=0 : boolean [ES6]  Returns true if searchString occurs in the string at index startPos. Returns false otherwise.  22.7.5 String.prototype: extracting    .slice start=0, end=this.length : string [ES3]  Returns the substring of the string that starts at  including  index start and ends at  excluding  index end. If an index is negative, it is added to .length before it is used  -1 becomes this.length-1, etc. .  > 'ababb'.match  a b+  g  [ 'ab', 'abb' ] > 'ababb'.match  a ? b+  g  [ 'ab', 'abb' ] > 'abab'.match  x g  null  > 'a2b'.search  [0-9]   1 > 'a2b'.search '[0-9]'  1  > '.gitignore'.startsWith '.'  true > 'abcde'.startsWith 'bc', 1  true  > 'abc'.slice 1, 3  'bc' > 'abc'.slice 1  'bc' > 'abc'.slice -2  'bc'    .split separator: string  RegExp, limit?: number : string[] [ES3]  Splits the string into an Array of substrings – the strings that occur between the separators. The separator can be a string:  > 'a  b  c'.split ''  [ 'a ', ' b ', ' c' ]   194  22 Strings  It can also be a regular expression: > 'a : b : c'.split   *: *   [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] > 'a : b : c'.split    * :  *    [ 'a', ' ', ' ', 'b', ' ', ' ', 'c' ]  The last invocation demonstrates that captures made by groups in the regular ex- pression become elements of the returned Array. Warning: .split ''  splits a string into JavaScript characters. That doesn’t work well when dealing with astral Unicode characters  which are encoded as two JavaScript characters . For example, emojis are astral:  > '☺X☺'.split ''  [ '\uD83D', '\uDE42', 'X', '\uD83D', '\uDE42' ]  Instead, it is better to use spreading:  > [...'☺X☺'] [ '☺', 'X', '☺' ]    .substring start: number, end=this.length : string [ES1]  Use .slice   instead of this method. .substring   wasn’t implemented consis- tently in older engines and doesn’t support negative indices.  22.7.6 String.prototype: combining    .concat ...strings: string[] : string [ES3]  Returns the concatenation of the string and strings. 'a'.concat 'b'  is equiva- lent to 'a'+'b'. The latter is much more popular.  > 'ab'.concat 'cd', 'ef', 'gh'  'abcdefgh'    .padEnd len: number, fillString=' ' : string [ES2017]  Appends  fragments of  fillString to the string until it has the desired length len. If it already has or exceeds len, then it is returned without any changes.  > ''.padEnd 2  ' ' > 'abc'.padEnd 2  'abc' > ''.padEnd 5, 'abc'  'abca'  > ''.padStart 2  ' '    .padStart len: number, fillString=' ' : string [ES2017]  Prepends  fragments of  fillString to the string until it has the desired length len. If it already has or exceeds len, then it is returned without any changes.   22.7 Quick reference: Strings  195  > 'abc'.padStart 2  'abc' > ''.padStart 5, 'abc'  'abca'    .repeat count=0 : string [ES6]  Returns the string, concatenated count times.  > '*'.repeat   '' > '*'.repeat 3  '***'  22.7.7 String.prototype: transforming    .normalize form: 'NFC''NFD''NFKC''NFKD' = 'NFC' : string [ES6]  Normalizes the string according to the Unicode Normalization Forms.    [1 of 2] .replaceAll searchValue: string  RegExp, replaceValue: string :  string [ES2021]  What to do if you can’t use .replaceAll    If .replaceAll   isn’t available on your targeted platform, you can use .re- place   instead. How is explained in §45.5.8.1 “str.replace searchValue, replacementValue  [ES3]”.  Replaces all matches of searchValue with replaceValue. If searchValue is a reg- ular expression without ﬂag  g, a TypeError is thrown.  > 'x.x.'.replaceAll '.', ''  'xx' > 'x.x.'.replaceAll  . g, ''  '' > 'x.x.'.replaceAll  . , ''  TypeError: String.prototype.replaceAll called with a non-global RegExp argument  Special characters in replaceValue are:  – $$: becomes $ – $n: becomes the capture of numbered group n  alas, $0 stands for the string  '$0', it does not refer to the complete match   – $&: becomes the complete match – $`: becomes everything before the match – $': becomes everything after the match  Examples:   196  22 Strings  > 'a 1995-12 b'.replaceAll   [0-9]{4} - [0-9]{2}  g, '$2'  'a 12 b' > 'a 1995-12 b'.replaceAll   [0-9]{4} - [0-9]{2}  g, '$&'  'a 1995-12 b' > 'a 1995-12 b'.replaceAll   [0-9]{4} - [0-9]{2}  g, '$`'  'a a  b'  Named capture groups  ES2018  are supported, too:  – $  becomes the capture of named group name  Example:  assert.equal   'a 1995-12 b'.replaceAll   'a 12 b' ;    ? [0-9]{4} - ? [0-9]{2}  g, '$ ' ,    [2 of 2] .replaceAll searchValue: string  RegExp, replacer:  ...args:  any[]  => string : string [ES2021] If the second parameter is a function, occurrences are replaced with the strings it returns. Its parameters args are:  – matched: string. The complete match – g1: stringundefined. The capture of numbered group 1 – g2: stringundefined. The capture of numbered group 2 –  Etc.  – offset: number. Where was the match found in the input string? – input: string. The whole input string const regexp =   [0-9]{4} - [0-9]{2}  g; const replacer =  all, year, month  => '' + all + ''; assert.equal   'a 1995-12 b'.replaceAll regexp, replacer , 'a 1995-12 b' ;  Named capture groups  ES2018  are supported, too. If there are any, an argument is added at the end with an object whose properties contain the captures:  const regexp =   ? [0-9]{4} - ? [0-9]{2}  g; const replacer =  ...args  => {  const groups=args.pop  ; return '' + groups.month + '';  }; assert.equal   'a 1995-12 b'.replaceAll regexp, replacer , 'a 12 b' ;    .replace searchValue: string  RegExp, replaceValue: string : string  [ES3]    .replace searchValue: string  RegExp, replacer:  ...args: any[]  =>  string : string [ES3]   22.7 Quick reference: Strings  197  .replace   works like .replaceAll  , but only replaces the ﬁrst occurrence if searchValue is a string or a regular expression without  g:  > 'x.x.'.replace '.', ''  'xx.' > 'x.x.'.replace  . , ''  '.x.'  For more information on this method, see §45.5.8.1 “str.replace searchValue, replacementValue  [ES3]”.    .toUpperCase  : string [ES1]  Returns a copy of the string in which all lowercase alphabetic characters are con- verted to uppercase. How well that works for various alphabets, depends on the JavaScript engine.  > '-a2b-'.toUpperCase   '-A2B-' > 'αβγ'.toUpperCase   'ΑΒΓ'    .toLowerCase  : string [ES1]  > '-A2B-'.toLowerCase   '-a2b-' > 'ΑΒΓ'.toLowerCase   'αβγ'    .trim  : string [ES5]  > '\r\n\t '' > ' 'abc'  abc  '.trim    '.trim      .trimEnd  : string [ES2019]  > ' '  abc abc'  '.trimEnd      .trimStart  : string [ES2019]  > ' 'abc  abc '  '.trimStart    Returns a copy of the string in which all uppercase alphabetic characters are con- verted to lowercase. How well that works for various alphabets, depends on the JavaScript engine.  Returns a copy of the string in which all leading and trailing whitespace  spaces, tabs, line terminators, etc.  is gone.  Similar to .trim   but only the end of the string is trimmed:  Similar to .trim   but only the beginning of the string is trimmed:   22 Strings  198  22.7.8 Sources    TypeScript’s built-in typings   MDN web docs for JavaScript   ECMAScript language speciﬁcation  Exercise: Using string methods  exercises strings remove_extension_test.mjs  Quiz See quiz app.   Chapter 23  Using template literals and tagged templates  Contents  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . .  . . . .  23.1 Disambiguation: “template” . 23.2 Template literals . . . . . 23.3 Tagged templates .  . . . . . . 23.3.1 Cooked vs. raw template strings  advanced   . . . . . . . . 23.4 Examples of tagged templates  as provided via libraries  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  23.4.1 Tag function library: lit-html . . . 23.4.2 Tag function library: re-template-tag . . . 23.4.3 Tag function library: graphql-tag . . . . . 23.5 Raw string literals . 23.6  Advanced  . . . . . . 23.7 Multiline template literals and indentation . . . . . . . . . . .  23.7.1 Fix: template tag for dedenting . 23.7.2 Fix: .trim   . . . 23.8 Simple templating via template literals . .  23.8.1 A more complex example 23.8.2 Simple HTML-escaping .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 199 . 200 . 201 . 201 . 203 . 203 . 203 . 203 . 204 . 204 . 204 . 205 . 206 . 206 . 206 . 207  Before we dig into the two features template literal and tagged template, let’s ﬁrst examine the multiple meanings of the term template.  23.1 Disambiguation: “template” The following three things are signiﬁcantly different despite all having template in their names and despite all of them looking similar:  199   200  23 Using template literals and tagged templates    A text template is a function from data to text. It is frequently used in web devel- opment and often deﬁned via text ﬁles. For example, the following text deﬁnes a template for the library Handlebars:     {{title}}     {{body}}        This template has two blanks to be ﬁlled in: title and body. It is used like this:     First step: retrieve the template text, e.g. from a text file. const tmplFunc = Handlebars.compile TMPL_TEXT ;    compile string const data = {title: 'My page', body: 'Welcome to my page!'}; const html = tmplFunc data ;    A template literal is similar to a string literal, but has additional features – for exam-  ple, interpolation. It is delimited by backticks:  const num = 5; assert.equal `Count: ${num}!`, 'Count: 5!' ;    Syntactically, a tagged template is a template literal that follows a function  or rather, an expression that evaluates to a function . That leads to the function being called. Its arguments are derived from the contents of the template literal.  const getArgs =  ...args  => args; assert.deepEqual   getArgs`Count: ${5}!`, [['Count: ', '!'], 5]  ;  Note that getArgs   receives both the text of the literal and the data interpolated via ${}.  23.2 Template literals A template literal has two new features compared to a normal string literal. First, it supports string interpolation: if we put a dynamically computed value inside a ${}, it is converted to a string and inserted into the string returned by the literal.  throw new Error `At most ${MAX} allowed: ${x}!` ;  const MAX = 100; function doSomeWork x  {  if  x > MAX  {  }    ···  } assert.throws    23.3 Tagged templates  201     => doSomeWork 101 , {message: 'At most 100 allowed: 101!'} ;  Second, template literals can span multiple lines:  const str = `this is a text with multiple lines`;  Template literals always produce strings.  23.3 Tagged templates The expression in line A is a tagged template. It is equivalent to invoking tagFunc   with the arguments listed in the Array in line B.  function tagFunc ...args  {  return args;  }  const setting = 'dark mode'; const value = true;  assert.deepEqual   tagFunc`Setting ${setting} is ${value}!`,     A  [['Setting ', ' is ', '!'], 'dark mode', true]     B    ;  The function tagFunc before the ﬁrst backtick is called a tag function. Its arguments are:   Template strings  ﬁrst argument : an Array with the text fragments surrounding the  interpolations ${}.  – In the example: ['Setting ', ' is ', '!']    Substitutions  remaining arguments : the interpolated values.  – In the example: 'dark mode' and true  The static  ﬁxed  parts of the literal  the template strings  are kept separate from the dynamic parts  the substitutions . A tag function can return arbitrary values.  23.3.1 Cooked vs. raw template strings  advanced  So far, we have only seen the cooked interpretation of template strings. But tag functions actually get two interpretations:    A cooked interpretation where backslashes have special meaning. For example, \t produces a tab character. This interpretation of the template strings is stored as an Array in the ﬁrst argument.    A raw interpretation where backslashes do not have special meaning. For exam- ple, \t produces two characters – a backslash and a t. This interpretation of the template strings is stored in property .raw of the ﬁrst argument  an Array .   202  23 Using template literals and tagged templates  The raw interpretation enables raw string literals via String.raw  described later  and similar applications.  The following tag function cookedRaw uses both interpretations:  function cookedRaw templateStrings, ...substitutions  {  return {  cooked: [...templateStrings],    copy only Array elements raw: templateStrings.raw, substitutions,  };  } assert.deepEqual   cookedRaw`\tab${'subst'}\newline\\`, {  cooked: ['\tab', '\newline\\'], raw: substitutions: ['subst'],  ['\\tab', '\\newline\\\\'],  } ;  } ;  } ;  assert.deepEqual   cookedRaw`\u{54}\u0065\x78t`, {  cooked: ['Text'], raw: substitutions: [],  ['\\u{54}\\u0065\\x78t'],  assert.deepEqual   cookedRaw`\uu\xx ${1} after`, {  cooked: [undefined, ' after'], raw: substitutions: [1],  ['\\uu\\xx ', ' after'],  We can also use Unicode code point escapes  \u{1F642} , Unicode code unit escapes  \u03A9 , and ASCII escapes  \x52  in tagged templates:  If the syntax of one of these escapes isn’t correct, the corresponding cooked template string is undefined, while the raw version is still verbatim:  Incorrect escapes produce syntax errors in template literals and string literals. Why does JavaScript treat tagged templates differently? It lets us use tagged templates for text that we can’t put inside string literals – for example:  windowsPath`C:\uuu\xxx\111` latex`\unicode`   203 23.4 Examples of tagged templates  as provided via libraries  23.4 Examples of tagged templates  as provided via li-  braries   Tagged templates are great for supporting small embedded languages  so-called domain- speciﬁc languages . We’ll continue with a few examples.  23.4.1 Tag function library: lit-html lit-html is a templating library that is based on tagged templates and used by the frontend framework Polymer:  import {html, render} from 'lit-html';  const template =  items  => html`  repeat items,   item  => item.id,  item, index  => html` ${index}. ${item.name} `    ${     }     `;  repeat   is a custom function for looping. Its 2nd parameter produces unique keys for the values returned by the 3rd parameter. Note the nested tagged template used by that parameter.  23.4.2 Tag function library: re-template-tag re-template-tag is a simple library for composing regular expressions. Templates tagged with re produce regular expressions. The main beneﬁt is that we can interpolate regular expressions and plain text via ${}  line A :  const RE_YEAR = re` ? [0-9]{4} `; const RE_MONTH = re` ? [0-9]{2} `; const RE_DAY = re` ? [0-9]{2} `; const RE_DATE = re` ${RE_YEAR}-${RE_MONTH}-${RE_DAY} u`;     A   const match = RE_DATE.exec '2017-01-27' ; assert.equal match.groups.year, '2017' ;  23.4.3 Tag function library: graphql-tag The library graphql-tag lets us create GraphQL queries via tagged templates:  import gql from 'graphql-tag';  const query = gql`  {   204  23 Using template literals and tagged templates  user id: 5  {  firstName lastName  }  } `;  Additionally, there are plugins for pre-compiling such queries in Babel, TypeScript, etc.  23.5 Raw string literals Raw string literals are implemented via the tag function String.raw. They are string literals where backslashes don’t do anything special  such as escaping characters, etc. :  assert.equal String.raw`\back`, '\\back' ;  This helps whenever data contains backslashes – for example, strings with regular ex- pressions:  const regex1 =  ^\. ; const regex2 = new RegExp '^\\.' ; const regex3 = new RegExp String.raw`^\.` ;  All three regular expressions are equivalent. With a normal string literal, we have to write the backslash twice, to escape it for that literal. With a raw string literal, we don’t have to do that. Raw string literals are also useful for specifying Windows ﬁlename paths:  const WIN_PATH = String.raw`C:\foo\bar`; assert.equal WIN_PATH, 'C:\\foo\\bar' ;   Advanced   23.6 All remaining sections are advanced  23.7 Multiline template literals and indentation If we put multiline text in template literals, two goals are in conﬂict: On one hand, the template literal should be indented to ﬁt inside the source code. On the other hand, the lines of its content should start in the leftmost column. For example:  function div text  {  return `    ${text}     `;  }   23.7 Multiline template literals and indentation  205  console.log 'Output:' ; console.log   div 'Hello!'     Replace spaces with mid-dots: .replace    g, '·'     Replace \n with \n: .replace  \n g, '\n'    ;  Output:  ····  ······Hello! ····  ··  Due to the indentation, the template literal ﬁts well into the source code. Alas, the output is also indented. And we don’t want the return at the beginning and the return plus two spaces at the end.  There are two ways to ﬁx this: via a tagged template or by trimming the result of the template literal.  23.7.1 Fix: template tag for dedenting The ﬁrst ﬁx is to use a custom template tag that removes the unwanted whitespace. It uses the ﬁrst line after the initial line break to determine in which column the text starts and shortens the indentation everywhere. It also removes the line break at the very begin- ning and the indentation at the very end. One such template tag is dedent by Desmond Brand:  import dedent from 'dedent'; function divDedented text  {  return dedent`     ${text}     `.replace  \n g, '\n' ;  } console.log 'Output:' ; console.log divDedented 'Hello!'  ;  This time, the output is not indented:  Output:    Hello!      206  23 Using template literals and tagged templates  23.7.2 Fix: .trim   The second ﬁx is quicker, but also dirtier:  function divDedented text  {  `.trim  .replace  \n g, '\n' ;  } console.log 'Output:' ; console.log divDedented 'Hello!'  ;  return `     ${text}     Output:    Hello!     The string method .trim   removes the superﬂuous whitespace at the beginning and at the end, but the content itself must start in the leftmost column. The advantage of this solution is that we don’t need a custom tag function. The downside is that it looks ugly. The output is the same as with dedent:  23.8 Simple templating via template literals While template literals look like text templates, it is not immediately obvious how to use them for  text  templating: A text template gets its data from an object, while a template literal gets its data from variables. The solution is to use a template literal in the body of a function whose parameter receives the templating data – for example:  const tmpl =  data  => `Hello ${data.name}!`; assert.equal tmpl {name: 'Jane'} , 'Hello Jane!' ;  23.8.1 A more complex example As a more complex example, we’d like to take an Array of addresses and produce an HTML table. This is the Array:  const addresses = [  { first: ' ', last: 'Bond' }, { first: 'Lars', last: ' ' },  ];  The function tmpl   that produces the HTML table looks as follows:  1  2  3  4  5  const tmpl =  addrs  => `    ${addrs.map   addr  => `      23.8 Simple templating via template literals  207   ${escapeHtml addr.first }   ${escapeHtml addr.last }   6  7  8  9  10  11  12    `.trim    .join '' }    `.trim  ;  with a table.  This code contains two templating functions:    The ﬁrst one  line 1  takes addrs, an Array with addresses, and returns a string    The second one  line 4  takes addr, an object containing an address, and returns a string with a table row. Note the .trim   at the end, which removes unnecessary whitespace.  The ﬁrst templating function produces its result by wrapping a table element around an Array that it joins into a string  line 10 . That Array is produced by mapping the second templating function to each element of addrs  line 3 . It therefore contains strings with table rows. The helper function escapeHtml   is used to escape special HTML characters  line 6 and line 7 . Its implementation is shown in the next subsection. Let us call tmpl   with the addresses and log the result:  console.log tmpl addresses  ;  The output is:        &lt;Jane&gt;   Bond        Lars   &lt;Croft&gt;         function escapeHtml str  {  return str  .replace  & g, '&amp;'     first! .replace  > g, '&gt;'  .replace  < g, '&lt;'  .replace  " g, '&quot;'  .replace  ' g, '&39;'  .replace  ` g, '&96;'  ;  23.8.2 Simple HTML-escaping The following function escapes plain text so that it is displayed verbatim in HTML:   208  23 Using template literals and tagged templates  } assert.equal   assert.equal   escapeHtml 'Rock & Roll' , 'Rock &amp; Roll' ;  escapeHtml ' ' , '&lt;blank&gt;' ;  Exercise: HTML templating Exercise with bonus challenge: test.mjs  exercises template-literals templating_  Quiz See quiz app.   Chapter 24  Symbols  Contents  24.2 The descriptions of symbols . 24.3 Use cases for symbols .  24.1.1 Symbols are primitive values 24.1.2 Symbols are also like objects . . . . .  24.1 Symbols are primitives that are also like objects . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . 24.3.1 Symbols as values for constants . . 24.3.2 Symbols as unique property keys . . . . .  24.4 Publicly known symbols . 24.5 Converting symbols .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . 209 . 209 . 210 . 210 . 210 . 211 . 212 . 213 . 214  24.1 Symbols are primitives that are also like objects Symbols are primitive values that are created via the factory function Symbol  :  const mySymbol = Symbol 'mySymbol' ;  The parameter is optional and provides a description, which is mainly useful for debug- ging.  24.1.1 Symbols are primitive values Symbols are primitive values:    They have to be categorized via typeof:  const sym = Symbol  ; assert.equal typeof sym, 'symbol' ;    They can be property keys in objects:  209   210  const obj = { [sym]: 123,  };  24 Symbols  24.1.2 Symbols are also like objects Even though symbols are primitives, they are also like objects in that each value created by Symbol   is unique and not compared by value:  Prior to symbols, objects were the best choice if we needed values that were unique  only equal to themselves :  > Symbol   === Symbol   false  const string1 = 'abc'; const string2 = 'abc'; assert.equal   const object1 = {}; const object2 = {}; assert.equal   string1 === string2, true ;    not unique  object1 === object2, false ;    unique  const symbol1 = Symbol  ; const symbol2 = Symbol  ; assert.equal   symbol1 === symbol2, false ;    unique  24.2 The descriptions of symbols The parameter we pass to the symbol factory function provides a description for the created symbol:  const mySymbol = Symbol 'mySymbol' ; The description can be accessed in two ways. First, it is part of the string returned by .toString  :  assert.equal mySymbol.toString  , 'Symbol mySymbol ' ;  Second, since ES2019, we can retrieve the description via the property .description:  assert.equal mySymbol.description, 'mySymbol' ;  24.3 Use cases for symbols The main use cases for symbols, are:    Values for constants   24.3 Use cases for symbols    Unique property keys  211  24.3.1 Symbols as values for constants Let’s assume you want to create constants representing the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. One simple way of doing so would be to use strings:  const COLOR_BLUE = 'Blue';  On the plus side, logging that constant produces helpful output. On the minus side, there is a risk of mistaking an unrelated value for a color because two strings with the same content are considered equal:  const MOOD_BLUE = 'Blue'; assert.equal COLOR_BLUE, MOOD_BLUE ;  We can ﬁx that problem via symbols:  const COLOR_BLUE = Symbol 'Blue' ; const MOOD_BLUE = Symbol 'Blue' ;  assert.notEqual COLOR_BLUE, MOOD_BLUE ;  Let’s use symbol-valued constants to implement a function:  = Symbol 'Red' ;  const COLOR_RED const COLOR_ORANGE = Symbol 'Orange' ; const COLOR_YELLOW = Symbol 'Yellow' ; = Symbol 'Green' ; const COLOR_GREEN const COLOR_BLUE = Symbol 'Blue' ; const COLOR_VIOLET = Symbol 'Violet' ;  function getComplement color  {  switch  color  { case COLOR_RED:  return COLOR_GREEN;  case COLOR_ORANGE:  return COLOR_BLUE;  case COLOR_YELLOW:  return COLOR_VIOLET;  case COLOR_GREEN:  return COLOR_RED;  case COLOR_BLUE:  return COLOR_ORANGE;  case COLOR_VIOLET:  return COLOR_YELLOW;  default:  throw new Exception 'Unknown color: '+color ;  }  } assert.equal getComplement COLOR_YELLOW , COLOR_VIOLET ;   212  24 Symbols  24.3.2 Symbols as unique property keys The keys of properties  ﬁelds  in objects are used at two levels:    The program operates at a base level. The keys at that level reﬂect the problem domain  – the area in which a program solves a problem – for example:  – If a program manages employees, the property keys may be about job titles,  salary categories, department IDs, etc.  – If the program is a chess app, the property keys may be about chess pieces,  chess boards, player colors, etc.    ECMAScript and many libraries operate at a meta-level. They manage data and  provide services that are not part of the problem domain – for example:  – The standard method .toString   is used by ECMAScript when creating a  string representation of an object  line A :  const point = {  x: 7, y: 4, toString   {  },  }; assert.equal   return ` ${this.x}, ${this.y} `;  String point , ' 7, 4 ' ;     A   .x and .y are base-level properties – they are used to solve the problem of computing with points. .toString   is a meta-level property – it doesn’t have anything to do with the problem domain. – The standard ECMAScript method .toJSON    const point = {  x: 7, y: 4, toJSON   {  },  }; assert.equal   return [this.x, this.y];  JSON.stringify point , '[7,4]' ;  .x and .y are base-level properties, .toJSON   is a meta-level property.  The base level and the meta-level of a program must be independent: Base-level property keys should not be in conﬂict with meta-level property keys. If we use names  strings  as property keys, we are facing two challenges:    When a language is ﬁrst created, it can use any meta-level names it wants. Base- level code is forced to avoid those names. Later, however, when much base-level code already exists, meta-level names can’t be chosen freely, anymore.   24.4 Publicly known symbols  213    We could introduce naming rules to separate base level and meta-level. For exam- ple, Python brackets meta-level names with two underscores: __init__, __iter_- _, __hash__, etc. However, the meta-level names of the language and the meta- level names of libraries would still exist in the same namespace and can clash.  These are two examples of where the latter was an issue for JavaScript:    In May 2018, the Array method .flatten   had to be renamed to .flat   because  the former name was already used by libraries  source .    In November 2020, the Array method .item   had to be renamed to .at   because  the former name was already used by library  source .  Symbols, used as property keys, help us here: Each symbol is unique and a symbol key never clashes with any other string or symbol key.  24.3.2.1 Example: a library with a meta-level method As an example, let’s assume we are writing a library that treats objects differently if they implement a special method. This is what deﬁning a property key for such a method and implementing it for an object would look like:  const specialMethod = Symbol 'specialMethod' ; const obj = {  _id: 'kf12oi', [specialMethod]   {     A   return this._id;  }  }; assert.equal obj[specialMethod]  , 'kf12oi' ;  The square brackets in line A enable us to specify that the method must have the key specialMethod. More details are explained in §30.6.2 “Computed property keys”.  24.4 Publicly known symbols Symbols that play special roles within ECMAScript are called publicly known symbols. Ex- amples include:    Symbol.iterator: makes an object iterable. It’s the key of a method that returns an  iterator. For more information on this topic, see §32 “Synchronous iteration”.    Symbol.hasInstance: customizes how instanceof works. If an object implements a method with that key, it can be used at the right-hand side of that operator. For example:  const PrimitiveNull = {  [Symbol.hasInstance] x  {  return x === null;  }  }; assert.equal null instanceof PrimitiveNull, true ;   214  24 Symbols    Symbol.toStringTag: inﬂuences the default .toString   method.  > String {}  '[object Object]' > String { [Symbol.toStringTag]: 'is no money' }  '[object is no money]'  Note: It’s usually better to override .toString  .

Tbl. 24.1 has the answers.  Table 24.1: The results of converting symbols to other primitive types.  Convert to boolean number string  Explicit conversion Boolean sym  → OK Number sym  → TypeError String sym  → OK sym.toString   → OK  Coercion  implicit conv.  !sym → OK sym*2 → TypeError ''+sym → TypeError `${sym}` → TypeError  One key pitfall with symbols is how often exceptions are thrown when converting them to something else. What is the thinking behind that? First, conversion to number never makes sense and should be warned about. Second, converting a symbol to a string is indeed useful for diagnostic output. But it also makes sense to warn about accidentally turning a symbol into a string  which is a different kind of property key :  const obj = {}; const sym = Symbol  ; assert.throws      => { obj['__'+sym+'__'] = true }, { message: 'Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string' } ;  The downside is that the exceptions make working with symbols more complicated. You have to explicitly convert symbols when assembling strings via the plus operator:  > const mySymbol = Symbol 'mySymbol' ; > 'Symbol I used: ' + mySymbol TypeError: Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string > 'Symbol I used: ' + String mySymbol  'Symbol I used: Symbol mySymbol '   24.5 Converting symbols  Quiz See quiz app.  215   216  24 Symbols   Part V  Control ﬂow and data ﬂow  217    Chapter 25  Control ﬂow statements  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  25.4 switch statements [ES3]  25.1 Controlling loops: break and continue . . .  . 25.3.1 The syntax of if statements .  . . 25.2 Conditions of control ﬂow statements . . . 25.3 if statements [ES1] . . . . .  . 25.1.1 break . . 25.1.2 break plus label: leaving any labeled statement . 25.1.3 continue . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25.4.1 A ﬁrst example of a switch statement . . . . . 25.4.2 Don’t forget to return or break! 25.4.3 Empty case clauses . . . . . . . 25.4.4 Checking for illegal values via a default clause . . . . . . . . . 25.5.1 Examples of while loops . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25.7.1 Examples of for loops . . . . . . . . . . . 25.8.1 const: for-of vs. for . . . . . 25.8.2 Iterating over iterables . . . 25.8.3 Iterating over [index, element] pairs of Arrays . . . . . . . . . .  . 25.9 for-await-of loops [ES2018] 25.10for-in loops  avoid  [ES1] . . . 25.11Recomendations for looping .  25.6 do-while loops [ES3] . 25.7 for loops [ES1] . . .  25.5 while loops [ES1] .  25.8 for-of loops [ES6]  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 220 . 220 . 220 . 221 . 221 . 222 . 222 . 223 . 223 . 224 . 224 . 225 . 225 . 226 . 226 . 226 . 227 . 227 . 228 . 228 . 228 . 229 . 229 . 229  This chapter covers the following control ﬂow statements:    if statement [ES1]   switch statement [ES3]  219   220  25 Control ﬂow statements    while loop [ES1]   do-while loop [ES3]   for loop [ES1]   for-of loop [ES6]   for-await-of loop [ES2018]   for-in loop [ES1]  25.1 Controlling loops: break and continue The two operators break and continue can be used to control loops and other statements while we are inside them.  25.1.1 break There are two versions of break: one with an operand and one without an operand. The latter version works inside the following statements: while, do-while, for, for-of, for- await-of, for-in and switch. It immediately leaves the current statement:  for  const x of ['a', 'b', 'c']  {  console.log x ; if  x === 'b'  break; console.log '---'      Output:    'a'    '---'    'b'  }  }  25.1.2 break plus label: leaving any labeled statement break with an operand works everywhere. Its operand is a label. Labels can be put in front of any statement, including blocks. break my_label leaves the statement whose label is my_label:  my_label: {    label  if  condition  break my_label;    labeled break    ···  In the following example, the search can either:  loop  line B .    Fail: The loop ﬁnishes without ﬁnding a result. That is handled directly after the    Succeed: While looping, we ﬁnd a result. Then we use break plus label  line A   to skip the code that handles failure.  function findSuffix stringArray, suffix  {  let result; search_block: {   25.2 Conditions of control ﬂow statements  221  for  const str of stringArray  {  if  str.endsWith suffix   {     Success: result = str; break search_block;     A   }  }    for    Failure: result = ' Untitled ';     B   }    search_block  return { suffix, result };     Same as: {suffix: suffix, result: result}  } assert.deepEqual    ; assert.deepEqual    ;  findSuffix ['notes.txt', 'index.html'], '.html' , { suffix: '.html', result: 'index.html' }  findSuffix ['notes.txt', 'index.html'], '.mjs' , { suffix: '.mjs', result: ' Untitled ' }  25.1.3 continue continue only works inside while, do-while, for, for-of, for-await-of, and for-in. It immediately leaves the current loop iteration and continues with the next one – for example:  const lines = [ 'Normal line', ' Comment', 'Another normal line',  ]; for  const line of lines  {  if  line.startsWith ''   continue; console.log line ;  }    Output:    'Normal line'    'Another normal line'  25.2 Conditions of control ﬂow statements if, while, and do-while have conditions that are, in principle, boolean. However, a condition only has to be truthy  true if coerced to boolean  in order to be accepted. In other words, the following two control ﬂow statements are equivalent:   222  25 Control ﬂow statements  if  value  {} if  Boolean value  === true  {}  This is a list of all falsy values:    undefined, null   false   0, NaN   0n   ''  All other values are truthy. For more information, see §17.2 “Falsy and truthy values”.  25.3 if statements [ES1] These are two simple if statements: one with just a “then” branch and one with both a “then” branch and an “else” branch:  Instead of the block, else can also be followed by another if statement:  if  cond  {     then branch  if  cond  {     then branch  } else {     else branch  if  cond1  {     ···  } else if  cond2  {     ···  if  cond1  {     ···  } else if  cond2  {     ··· } else {    ···  }  }  }  }  You can continue this chain with more else ifs.  25.3.1 The syntax of if statements The general syntax of if statements is:  if  cond  «then_statement» else «else_statement»   25.4 switch statements [ES3]  223  So far, the then_statement has always been a block, but we can use any statement. That statement must be terminated with a semicolon:  if  true  console.log 'Yes' ; else console.log 'No' ;  That means that else if is not its own construct; it’s simply an if statement whose else_statement is another if statement.  25.4 switch statements [ES3] A switch statement looks as follows: switch  «switch_expression»  {  «switch_body»  }  The body of switch consists of zero or more case clauses:  case «case_expression»:  «statements»  And, optionally, a default clause:  default:  «statements»  A switch is executed as follows:    It evaluates the switch expression.   It jumps to the ﬁrst case clause whose expression has the same result as the switch  expression.    Otherwise, if there is no such clause, it jumps to the default clause.   Otherwise, if there is no default clause, it does nothing.  25.4.1 A ﬁrst example of a switch statement Let’s look at an example: The following function converts a number from 1–7 to the name of a weekday.  function dayOfTheWeek num  {  switch  num  {  case 1:  return 'Monday';  case 2:  case 3:  case 4:  case 5:  case 6:  return 'Tuesday';  return 'Wednesday';  return 'Thursday';  return 'Friday';   224  25 Control ﬂow statements  return 'Saturday';  case 7:  return 'Sunday';  }  } assert.equal dayOfTheWeek 5 , 'Friday' ;  25.4.2 Don’t forget to return or break! At the end of a case clause, execution continues with the next case clause, unless we return or break – for example:  function englishToFrench english  {  }    The result should be 'bonjour'! assert.equal englishToFrench 'hello' , 'au revoir' ;  That is, our implementation of dayOfTheWeek   only worked because we used return. We can ﬁx englishToFrench   by using break:  function englishToFrench english  {  let french; switch  english  {  case 'hello':  french = 'bonjour';  case 'goodbye':  french = 'au revoir';  } return french;  let french; switch  english  {  case 'hello':  french = 'bonjour'; break;  case 'goodbye':  french = 'au revoir'; break;  } return french;  } assert.equal englishToFrench 'hello' , 'bonjour' ;    ok  25.4.3 Empty case clauses The statements of a case clause can be omitted, which effectively gives us multiple case expressions per case clause:  function isWeekDay name  {  switch  name  { case 'Monday':   25.5 while loops [ES1]  225  25.4.4 Checking for illegal values via a default clause A default clause is jumped to if the switch expression has no other match. That makes it useful for error checking:  case 'Tuesday': case 'Wednesday': case 'Thursday': case 'Friday': return true;  case 'Saturday': case 'Sunday': return false;  }  } assert.equal isWeekDay 'Wednesday' , true ; assert.equal isWeekDay 'Sunday' , false ;  function isWeekDay name  {  switch  name  { case 'Monday': case 'Tuesday': case 'Wednesday': case 'Thursday': case 'Friday': return true;  case 'Saturday': case 'Sunday': return false;  default:  }  } assert.throws   throw new Error 'Illegal value: '+name ;     => isWeekDay 'January' , {message: 'Illegal value: January'} ;  Exercises: switch    exercises control-flow number_to_month_test.mjs   Bonus: exercises control-flow is_object_via_switch_test.mjs  25.5 while loops [ES1] A while loop has the following syntax:   226  }  while  «condition»  {  «statements»  25 Control ﬂow statements  Before each loop iteration, while evaluates condition:    If the result is falsy, the loop is ﬁnished.   If the result is truthy, the while body is executed one more time.  25.5.1 Examples of while loops The following code uses a while loop. In each loop iteration, it removes the ﬁrst element of arr via .shift   and logs it.  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; while  arr.length > 0  {  const elem = arr.shift  ;    remove first element console.log elem ;  }    Output:    'a'    'b'    'c'  If the condition always evaluates to true, then while is an inﬁnite loop:  while  true  {  if  Math.random   === 0  break;  }  25.6 do-while loops [ES3] The do-while loop works much like while, but it checks its condition after each loop iteration, not before.  let input; do {  input = prompt 'Enter text:' ; console.log input ;  } while  input !== ':q' ;  prompt   is a global function that is available in web browsers. It prompts the user to input text and returns it.  25.7 for loops [ES1] A for loop has the following syntax:  «statements»  }  for  «initialization»; «condition»; «post_iteration»  {   25.8 for-of loops [ES6]  227  The ﬁrst line is the head of the loop and controls how often the body  the remainder of the loop  is executed. It has three parts and each of them is optional:    initialization: sets up variables, etc. for the loop. Variables declared here via  let or const only exist inside the loop.    condition: This condition is checked before each loop iteration. If it is falsy, the  loop stops.    post_iteration: This code is executed after each loop iteration. A for loop is therefore roughly equivalent to the following while loop:  «initialization» while  «condition»  {  «statements» «post_iteration»  25.7.1 Examples of for loops As an example, this is how to count from zero to two via a for loop:  for  let i=0; i<3; i++  {  console.log i ;  This is how to log the contents of an Array via a for loop:  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; for  let i=0; i<arr.length; i++  {  console.log arr[i] ;  If we omit all three parts of the head, we get an inﬁnite loop:  if  Math.random   === 0  break;  25.8 for-of loops [ES6] A for-of loop iterates over any iterable – a data container that supports the iteration pro- tocol. Each iterated value is stored in a variable, as speciﬁed in the head:  }  }  }  }     Output:    0    1    2     Output:    'a'    'b'    'c'  for  ;;  {   228  25 Control ﬂow statements  for  «iteration_variable» of «iterable»  {  «statements»  }  The iteration variable is usually created via a variable declaration:  const iterable = ['hello', 'world']; for  const elem of iterable  {  console.log elem ;  }    Output:    'hello'    'world'  But we can also use a  mutable  variable that already exists:  const iterable = ['hello', 'world']; let elem; for  elem of iterable  {  console.log elem ;  }  }  25.8.1 const: for-of vs. for Note that in for-of loops we can use const. The iteration variable can still be different for each iteration  it just can’t change during the iteration . Think of it as a new const declaration being executed each time in a fresh scope. In contrast, in for loops we must declare variables via let or var if their values change.  Iterating over iterables  25.8.2 As mentioned before, for-of works with any iterable object, not just with Arrays – for example, with Sets:  const set = new Set ['hello', 'world'] ; for  const elem of set  {  console.log elem ;  Iterating over [index, element] pairs of Arrays  25.8.3 Lastly, we can also use for-of to iterate over the [index, element] entries of Arrays:  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; for  const [index, elem] of arr.entries    {  console.log `${index} -> ${elem}` ;  }    Output:    '0 -> a'    '1 -> b'    '2 -> c'   25.9 for-await-of loops [ES2018]  229  With [index, element], we are using destructuring to access Array elements.  Exercise: for-of  exercises control-flow array_to_string_test.mjs  25.9 for-await-of loops [ES2018] for-await-of is like for-of, but it works with asynchronous iterables instead of syn- chronous ones. And it can only be used inside async functions and async generators.  for await  const item of asyncIterable  {     ···  }  for-await-of is described in detail in the chapter on asynchronous iteration.  25.10 for-in loops  avoid  [ES1] The for-in loop visits all  own and inherited  enumerable property keys of an object. When looping over an Array, it is rarely a good choice:    It visits property keys, not values.   As property keys, the indices of Array elements are strings, not numbers  more  information on how Array elements work .    It visits all enumerable property keys  both own and inherited ones , not just those  of Array elements.  The following code demonstrates these points:  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; arr.propKey = 'property value';  for  const key in arr  {  console.log key ;  }     Output:    '0'    '1'    '2'    'propKey'  await-of.  25.11 Recomendations for looping    If you want to loop over an asynchronous iterable  in ES2018+ , you must use for-   230  25 Control ﬂow statements    For looping over a synchronous iterable  in ES6+ , you must use for-of. Note that  Arrays are iterables.    For looping over an Array in ES5+, you can use the Array method .forEach  .   Before ES5, you can use a plain for loop to loop over an Array.   Don’t use for-in to loop over an Array.

Why doesn’t JavaScript throw exceptions more often?  JavaScript didn’t support exceptions until ES3. That explains why they are used sparingly by the language and its standard library.  26.1 Motivation: throwing and catching exceptions Consider the following code. It reads proﬁles stored in ﬁles into an Array with instances of class Profile:  function readProfiles filePaths  {  const profiles = []; for  const filePath of filePaths  {  try {  const profile = readOneProfile filePath ; profiles.push profile ;  231   26 Exception handling  232  }  }  } catch  err  {     A   console.log 'Error in: '+filePath, err ;  } function readOneProfile filePath  {  const profile = new Profile  ; const file = openFile filePath ;    ···  Read the data in `file` into `profile`  return profile;  } function openFile filePath  {  if  !fs.existsSync filePath   {  throw new Error 'Could not find file '+filePath ;     B   }    ···  Open the file whose path is `filePath`   }  Let’s examine what happens in line B: An error occurred, but the best place to handle the problem is not the current location, it’s line A. There, we can skip the current ﬁle and move on to the next one. Therefore:    In line B, we use a throw statement to indicate that there was a problem.   In line A, we use a try-catch statement to handle the problem.  When we throw, the following constructs are active:  readProfiles ···   for  const filePath of filePaths   try  readOneProfile ···   openFile ···   if  !fs.existsSync filePath    throw  One by one, throw exits the nested constructs, until it encounters a try statement. Exe- cution continues in the catch clause of that try statement.  26.2 throw This is the syntax of the throw statement:  throw «value»;  throw new Error 'Problem!' ;  Any value can be thrown, but it’s best to throw an instance of Error or its subclasses.   26.3 The try statement  233  26.2.1 Options for creating error objects    Using class Error. That is less limiting in JavaScript than in a more static language  because we can add our own properties to instances:  const err = new Error 'Could not find the file' ; err.filePath = filePath; throw err;    Use one of JavaScript’s subclasses of Error  which are listed later .   Subclassing Error:  class MyError extends Error { } function func   {  throw new MyError 'Problem!' ;  } assert.throws     => func  , MyError ;  26.3 The try statement The maximal version of the try statement looks as follows:  try {  «try_statements» } catch  error  {  «catch_statements»  } finally {  «finally_statements»  }    try-catch   try-finally   try-catch-finally  We can combine these clauses as follows:  26.3.1 The try block The try block can be considered the body of the statement. This is where we execute the regular code.  26.3.2 The catch clause If an exception reaches the try block, then it is assigned to the parameter of the catch clause and the code in that clause is executed. Next, execution normally continues after the try statement. That may change if:    There is a return, break, or throw inside the catch block.   }  }  }  try {     ··· } catch {    ···  }  234  26 Exception handling    There is a finally clause  which is always executed before the try statement ends . The following code demonstrates that the value that is thrown in line A is indeed caught in line B.  const errorObject = new Error  ; function func   {  throw errorObject;     A   try {  func  ;  } catch  err  {     B   assert.equal err, errorObject ;  26.3.2.1 Omitting the catch binding Since ECMAScript 2019, we can omit the catch parameter if we are not interested in the value that was thrown:  That may be occasionally useful. For example, Node.js has the API function as- sert.throws func  that checks whether an error is thrown inside func. It could be implemented as follows.  function throws func  {  try {  func  ; } catch {  return;    everything OK  } throw new Error 'Function didn’t throw an exception!' ;  However, a more complete implementation of this function would have a catch param- eter and would, for example, check that its type is as expected.  26.3.3 The finally clause The code inside the finally clause is always executed at the end of a try statement – no matter what happens in the try block or the catch clause. Let’s look at a common use case for finally: We have created a resource and want to always destroy it when we are done with it, no matter what happens while working with it. We would implement that as follows:   26.4 Error classes  235  const resource = createResource  ; try {     Work with `resource`. Errors may be thrown.  } finally {  resource.destroy  ;  }  26.3.3.1 finally is always executed The finally clause is always executed, even if an error is thrown  line A :  let finallyWasExecuted = false; assert.throws   throw new Error  ;     A   } finally {  finallyWasExecuted = true;     => { try {  }  }, Error   ; assert.equal finallyWasExecuted, true ; And even if there is a return statement  line A :  let finallyWasExecuted = false; function func   {  try {  return;     A   } finally {  finallyWasExecuted = true;  }  } func  ; assert.equal finallyWasExecuted, true ;  26.4 Error classes Error is the common superclass of all built-in error classes. It has the following sub- classes  I’m quoting the ECMAScript speciﬁcation :    RangeError: Indicates a value that is not in the set or range of allowable values.   ReferenceError: Indicate that an invalid reference value has been detected.   SyntaxError: Indicates that a parsing error has occurred.   TypeError: is used to indicate an unsuccessful operation when none of the other  NativeError objects are an appropriate indication of the failure cause.    URIError: Indicates that one of the global URI handling functions was used in a  way that is incompatible with its deﬁnition.   236  26 Exception handling  26.4.1 Properties of error objects Consider err, an instance of Error:  const err = new Error 'Hello!' ; assert.equal String err , 'Error: Hello!' ;  Two properties of err are especially useful:    .message: contains just the error message.  assert.equal err.message, 'Hello!' ;    .stack: contains a stack trace. It is supported by all mainstream browsers.  assert.equal  err.stack, ` Error: Hello!  `.trim   ;  at file:  ch_exception-handling.mjs:1:13  Exercise: Exception handling  exercises exception-handling call_function_test.mjs  Quiz See quiz app.   Chapter 27  Callable values  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  functions  arrow functions .  27.3 Specialized functions  27.1 Kinds of functions . 27.2 Ordinary functions .  . . . . . . 27.2.1 Named function expressions  advanced  . . 27.2.2 Terminology: function deﬁnitions and function expressions . . . . . 27.2.3 Parts of a function declaration . . . . . 27.2.4 Roles played by ordinary functions . . . . . 27.2.5 Terminology: entity vs. syntax vs. role  advanced  . . . . . . . . . . . 27.3.1 Specialized functions are still functions . 27.3.2 Arrow functions . . . . . . 27.3.3 The special variable this in methods, ordinary functions and . 27.3.4 Recommendation: prefer specialized functions over ordinary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27.7 Methods of functions: .call  , .apply  , .bind   . . . . . . .  . . . . 27.4 Summary: kinds of callable values . . . 27.5 Returning values from functions and methods . . 27.6 Parameter handling . . . . . . . . . .  . 27.6.1 Terminology: parameters vs. arguments . 27.6.2 Terminology: callback . . . . 27.6.3 Too many or not enough arguments . . . . . . . 27.6.4 Parameter default values . . . . 27.6.5 Rest parameters . . . . . . . . . . . . 27.6.6 Named parameters . . . . . . . 27.6.7 Simulating named parameters . . . 27.6.8 Spreading  ...  into function calls . . .  27.7.1 The function method .call   . 27.7.2 The function method .apply   27.7.3 The function method .bind   .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 238 . 238 . 238 . 239 . 240 . 240 . 241 . 241 . 242 . 243  . 244  . 245 . 246 . 247 . 248 . 248 . 248 . 248 . 249 . 249 . 250 . 250 . 251 . 252 . 252 . 253 . 253  237   238  27 Callable values  In this chapter, we look at JavaScript values that can be invoked: functions, methods, and classes.  27.1 Kinds of functions JavaScript has two categories of functions:    An ordinary function can play several roles:  – Real function – Method – Constructor function    A specialized function can only play one of those roles – for example:  – An arrow function can only be a real function. – A method can only be a method. – A class can only be a constructor function.  Specialized functions were added to the language in ECMAScript 6.  Read on to ﬁnd out what all of those things mean.  27.2 Ordinary functions The following code shows two ways of doing  roughly  the same thing: creating an or- dinary function.     Function declaration  a statement  function ordinary1 a, b, c  {     ···  }     ···  };     const plus anonymous  nameless  function expression const ordinary2 = function  a, b, c  {  Inside a scope, function declarations are activated early  see §13.8 “Declarations: scope and activation”  and can be called before they are declared. That is occasionally useful. Variable declarations, such as the one for ordinary2, are not activated early.  27.2.1 Named function expressions  advanced  So far, we have only seen anonymous function expressions – which don’t have names:  const anonFuncExpr = function  a, b, c  {     ···  };   27.2 Ordinary functions  239  But there are also named function expressions:  const namedFuncExpr = function myName a, b, c  {     `myName` is only accessible in here  };  myName is only accessible inside the body of the function. The function can use it to refer to itself  for self-recursion, etc.  – independently of which variable it is assigned to:  const func = function funcExpr   { return funcExpr }; assert.equal func  , func ;     The name `funcExpr` only exists inside the function body: assert.throws    => funcExpr  , ReferenceError ;  Even if they are not assigned to variables, named function expressions have names  line A :  function getNameOfCallback callback  {  return callback.name;  }  assert.equal   assert.equal   getNameOfCallback function    {} , '' ;    anonymous  getNameOfCallback function named   {} , 'named' ;     A   Note that functions created via function declarations or variable declarations always have names:  function funcDecl   {} assert.equal   getNameOfCallback funcDecl , 'funcDecl' ;  const funcExpr = function    {}; assert.equal   getNameOfCallback funcExpr , 'funcExpr' ;  One beneﬁt of functions having names is that those names show up in exception stack traces.  27.2.2 Terminology: function deﬁnitions and function expressions A function deﬁnition is syntax that creates functions:    A function declaration  a statement    A function expression  Function declarations always produce ordinary functions. Function expressions produce either ordinary functions or specialized functions:    Ordinary function expressions  which we have already encountered :  – Anonymous function expressions   240  27 Callable values  – Named function expressions    Specialized function expressions  which we’ll look at later :  – Arrow functions  which are always expressions   While function declarations are still popular in JavaScript, function expressions are al- most always arrow functions in modern code.  27.2.3 Parts of a function declaration Let’s examine the parts of a function declaration via the following example. Most of the terms also apply to function expressions.  function add x, y  {  return x + y;  }   add is the name of the function declaration.   add x, y  is the head of the function declaration.   x and y are the parameters.   The curly braces  { and }  and everything between them are the body of the function  declaration.    The return statement explicitly returns a value from the function.  27.2.3.1 Trailing commas in parameter lists JavaScript has always allowed and ignored trailing commas in Array literals. Since ES5, they are also allowed in object literals. Since ES2017, we can add trailing commas to parameter lists  declarations and invocations :     Declaration function retrieveData   contentText, keyword, {unique, ignoreCase, pageSize},    trailing comma    {  }     ···     Invocation retrieveData    ;  '', null, {ignoreCase: true, pageSize: 10},    trailing comma  27.2.4 Roles played by ordinary functions Consider the following function declaration from the previous section:  function add x, y  {  return x + y;   27.3 Specialized functions  }  241  This function declaration creates an ordinary function whose name is add. As an ordinary function, add   can play three roles:    Real function: invoked via a function call.  assert.equal add 2, 1 , 3 ;    Method: stored in a property, invoked via a method call.  const obj = { addAsMethod: add }; assert.equal obj.addAsMethod 2, 4 , 6 ;     A   In line A, obj is called the receiver of the method call.    Constructor function: invoked via new.  const inst = new add  ; assert.equal inst instanceof add, true ;  As an aside, the names of constructor functions  incl. classes  normally start with capital letters.  entity.  27.2.5 Terminology: entity vs. syntax vs. role  advanced  The distinction between the concepts syntax, entity, and role is subtle and often doesn’t matter. But I’d like to sharpen your eye for it:    An entity is a JavaScript feature as it “lives” in RAM. An ordinary function is an  – Entities include: ordinary functions, arrow functions, methods, and classes.   Syntax is the code that we use to create entities. Function declarations and anony- mous function expressions are syntax. They both create entities that are called ordinary functions.  – Syntax includes: function declarations and anonymous function expressions. The syntax that produces arrow functions is also called arrow functions. The same is true for methods and classes.    A role describes how we use entities. The entity ordinary function can play the role real function, or the role method, or the role class. The entity arrow function can also play the role real function.  – The roles of functions are: real function, method, and constructor function. Many other programming languages only have a single entity that plays the role real function. Then they can use the name function for both role and entity.  27.3 Specialized functions Specialized functions are single-purpose versions of ordinary functions. Each one of them specializes in a single role:    The purpose of an arrow function is to be a real function:   242  27 Callable values  const arrow =    => {  return 123;  }; assert.equal arrow  , 123 ;    The purpose of a method is to be a method:  const obj = { myMethod   {  return 'abc';  }  }; assert.equal obj.myMethod  , 'abc' ;    The purpose of a class is to be a constructor function:  class MyClass {   * ··· *   } const inst = new MyClass  ;  Apart from nicer syntax, each kind of specialized function also supports new features, making them better at their jobs than ordinary functions.    Arrow functions are explained soon.   Methods are explained in the chapter on single objects.   Classes are explained in the chapter on classes.  Tbl. 27.1 lists the capabilities of ordinary and specialized functions.  Table 27.1: Capabilities of four kinds of functions. If a cell value is in parentheses, that implies some kind of limitation. The special variable this is explained in §27.3.3 “The special variable this in methods, ordi- nary functions and arrow functions”.  Ordinary function Arrow function Method Class  Function call  this === undefined  ✔  this === undefined  ✘  Method call ✔  lexical this  ✔ ✘  Constructor call ✔ ✘ ✘ ✔  27.3.1 Specialized functions are still functions It’s important to note that arrow functions, methods, and classes are still categorized as functions:  >     => {}  instanceof Function true >  { method   {} }.method  instanceof Function true >  class SomeClass {}  instanceof Function   27.3 Specialized functions  true  243  27.3.2 Arrow functions Arrow functions were added to JavaScript for two reasons: 1. To provide a more concise way for creating functions. 2. They work better as real functions inside methods: Methods can refer to the object that received a method call via the special variable this. Arrow functions can access the this of a surrounding method, ordinary functions can’t  because they have their own this .  We’ll ﬁrst examine the syntax of arrow functions and then how this works in various functions.  27.3.2.1 The syntax of arrow functions Let’s review the syntax of an anonymous function expression:  const f = function  x, y, z  { return 123 };  The  roughly  equivalent arrow function looks as follows. Arrow functions are expres- sions.  const f =  x, y, z  => { return 123 };  Here, the body of the arrow function is a block. But it can also be an expression. The following arrow function works exactly like the previous one.  const f =  x, y, z  => 123;  If an arrow function has only a single parameter and that parameter is an identiﬁer  not a destructuring pattern  then you can omit the parentheses around the parameter:  That is convenient when passing arrow functions as parameters to other functions or methods:  const id = x => x;  > [1,2,3].map x => x+1  [ 2, 3, 4 ]  This previous example demonstrates one beneﬁt of arrow functions – conciseness. If we perform the same task with a function expression, our code is more verbose:  [1,2,3].map function  x  { return x+1 } ;  27.3.2.2 Syntax pitfall: returning an object literal from an arrow function If you want the expression body of an arrow function to be an object literal, you must put the literal in parentheses:  const func1 =    =>  {a: 1} ; assert.deepEqual func1  , { a: 1 } ;   244  27 Callable values  If you don’t, JavaScript thinks, the arrow function has a block body  that doesn’t return anything :  const func2 =    => {a: 1}; assert.deepEqual func2  , undefined ;  {a: 1} is interpreted as a block with the label a: and the expression statement 1. Without an explicit return statement, the block body returns undefined. This pitfall is caused by syntactic ambiguity: object literals and code blocks have the same syntax. We use the parentheses to tell JavaScript that the body is an expression  an object literal  and not a statement  a block .  27.3.3 The special variable this in methods, ordinary functions and  arrow functions  The special variable this is an object-oriented feature  We are taking a quick look at the special variable this here, in order to understand why arrow functions are better real functions than ordinary functions. But this feature only matters in object-oriented programming and is covered in more depth in §30.4 “Methods and the special variable this”. Therefore, don’t worry if you don’t fully understand it yet.  Inside methods, the special variable this lets us access the receiver – the object which received the method call:  const obj = { myMethod   {  assert.equal this, obj ;  }; obj.myMethod  ;  const obj = {  myMethod: function    {  assert.equal this, obj ;  }; obj.myMethod  ;  }  }  function ordinaryFunc   {  assert.equal this, undefined ;  } ordinaryFunc  ;  Ordinary functions can be methods and therefore also have the implicit parameter this:  this is even an implicit parameter when we use an ordinary function as a real function. Then its value is undefined  in strict mode :   27.3 Specialized functions  245  That means that an ordinary function, used as a real function, can’t access the this of a surrounding method  line A . In contrast, arrow functions don’t have this as an implicit parameter. They treat it like any other variable and can therefore access the this of a surrounding method  line B :     => this.name,     A   ^TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined$  ;  const jill = { name: 'Jill', someMethod   {  function ordinaryFunc   {  assert.throws   } ordinaryFunc  ;  }; arrowFunc  ;  },  }; jill.someMethod  ;  const arrowFunc =    => {  assert.equal this.name, 'Jill' ;     B   In this code, we can observe two ways of handling this:    Dynamic this: In line A, we try to access the this of .someMethod   from an ordi- nary function. There, it is shadowed by the function’s own this, which is undefined  as ﬁlled in by the function call . Given that ordinary functions receive their this via  dynamic  function or method calls, their this is called dynamic.    Lexical this: In line B, we again try to access the this of .someMethod  . This time, we succeed because the arrow function does not have its own this. this is resolved lexically, just like any other variable. That’s why the this of arrow functions is called lexical.  27.3.4 Recommendation: prefer specialized functions over ordinary  functions  Normally, you should prefer specialized functions over ordinary functions, especially classes and methods. When it comes to real functions, the choice between an arrow function and an ordinary function is less clear-cut, though:    For anonymous inline function expressions, arrow functions are clear winners, due  to their compact syntax and them not having this as an implicit parameter:  const twiceOrdinary = [1, 2, 3].map function  x  {return x * 2} ; const twiceArrow = [1, 2, 3].map x => x * 2 ;    For stand-alone named function declarations, arrow functions still beneﬁt from lexical this. But function declarations  which produce ordinary functions  have   246  27 Callable values  nice syntax and early activation is also occasionally useful  see §13.8 “Declarations: scope and activation” . If this doesn’t appear in the body of an ordinary function, there is no downside to using it as a real function. The static checking tool ESLint can warn us during development when we do this wrong via a built-in rule.  function timesOrdinary x, y  {  return x * y;  } const timesArrow =  x, y  => {  return x * y;  };  27.4 Summary: kinds of callable values  This section refers to upcoming content  This section mainly serves as a reference for the current and upcoming chapters. Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything.  So far, all  real  functions and methods, that we have seen, were:    Single-result   Synchronous  Later chapters will cover other modes of programming:    Iteration treats objects as containers of data  so-called iterables  and provides a stan- dardized way for retrieving what is inside them. If a function or a method returns an iterable, it returns multiple values.    Asynchronous programming deals with handling a long-running computation. You are notiﬁed when the computation is ﬁnished and can do something else in be- tween. The standard pattern for asynchronously delivering single results is called Promise.  These modes can be combined – for example, there are synchronous iterables and asyn- chronous iterables. Several new kinds of functions and methods help with some of the mode combinations:   Async functions help implement functions that return Promises. There are also  async methods.    Synchronous generator functions help implement functions that return synchronous  iterables. There are also synchronous generator methods.    Asynchronous generator functions help implement functions that return asyn-  chronous iterables. There are also asynchronous generator methods.  That leaves us with 4 kinds  2 × 2  of functions and methods:    Synchronous vs. asynchronous   Generator vs. single-result   27.5 Returning values from functions and methods  247  Tbl. 27.2 gives an overview of the syntax for creating these 4 kinds of functions and meth- ods.  Table 27.2: Syntax for creating functions and methods. The last column speciﬁes how many values are produced by an entity.  Sync function function f   {} f = function    {} f =    => {} Sync generator function function* f   {} f = function*    {} Async function async function f   {} f = async function    {} f = async    => {} Async generator function async function* f   {} f = async function*    {}  Sync method { m   {} }  Sync gen. method { * m   {} }  Async method { async m   {} }  Result  value  iterable  Promise    1  0+  1  Async gen. method { async * m   {} }  async iterable  0+  27.5 Returning values from functions and methods  Everything mentioned in this section applies to both functions and methods.  The return statement explicitly returns a value from a function:  function func   {  return 123;  } assert.equal func  , 123 ;  Another example:  function boolToYesNo bool  {  if  bool  {  return 'Yes';  } else {  return 'No';  }  } assert.equal boolToYesNo true , 'Yes' ; assert.equal boolToYesNo false , 'No' ;  If, at the end of a function, you haven’t returned anything explicitly, JavaScript returns undefined for you:  function noReturn   {     No explicit return   248  27 Callable values  } assert.equal noReturn  , undefined ;  27.6 Parameter handling Once again, I am only mentioning functions in this section, but everything also applies to methods.  27.6.1 Terminology: parameters vs. arguments The term parameter and the term argument basically mean the same thing. If you want to, you can make the following distinction:    Parameters are part of a function deﬁnition. They are also called formal parameters    Arguments are part of a function call. They are also called actual parameters and  and formal arguments.  actual arguments.  27.6.2 Terminology: callback A callback or callback function is a function that is an argument of a function or method call. The following is an example of a callback:  const myArray = ['a', 'b']; const callback =  x  => console.log x ; myArray.forEach callback ;     Output:    'a'    'b'  27.6.3 Too many or not enough arguments JavaScript does not complain if a function call provides a different number of arguments than expected by the function deﬁnition:    Extra arguments are ignored.   Missing parameters are set to undefined.  For example:  function foo x, y  {  return [x, y];  }     Too many arguments: assert.deepEqual foo 'a', 'b', 'c' , ['a', 'b'] ;   27.6 Parameter handling  249     The expected number of arguments: assert.deepEqual foo 'a', 'b' , ['a', 'b'] ;     Not enough arguments: assert.deepEqual foo 'a' , ['a', undefined] ;  27.6.4 Parameter default values Parameter default values specify the value to use if a parameter has not been provided – for example:  function f x, y=0  {  return [x, y];  }  assert.deepEqual f 1 , [1, 0] ; assert.deepEqual f  , [undefined, 0] ;  undefined also triggers the default value:  assert.deepEqual   f undefined, undefined , [undefined, 0] ;  27.6.5 Rest parameters A rest parameter is declared by preﬁxing an identiﬁer with three dots  ... . During a function or method call, it receives an Array with all remaining arguments. If there are no extra arguments at the end, it is an empty Array – for example:  function f x, ...y  {  return [x, y];  } assert.deepEqual   f 'a', 'b', 'c' , ['a', ['b', 'c']] ;  assert.deepEqual   f  , [undefined, []] ;  27.6.5.1 Enforcing a certain number of arguments via a rest parameter You can use a rest parameter to enforce a certain number of arguments. Take, for example, the following function:  function createPoint x, y  {  return {x, y};     same as {x: x, y: y}  }  This is how we force callers to always provide two arguments:   27 Callable values  250  }  function createPoint ...args  {  if  args.length !== 2  {  } const [x, y] = args;     A  return {x, y};  throw new Error 'Please provide exactly 2 arguments!' ;  In line A, we access the elements of args via destructuring.  27.6.6 Named parameters When someone calls a function, the arguments provided by the caller are assigned to the parameters received by the callee. Two common ways of performing the mapping are: 1. Positional parameters: An argument is assigned to a parameter if they have the  same position. A function call with only positional arguments looks as follows.  selectEntries 3, 20, 2   2. Named parameters: An argument is assigned to a parameter if they have the same name. JavaScript doesn’t have named parameters, but you can simulate them. For example, this is a function call with only  simulated  named arguments:  selectEntries {start: 3, end: 20, step: 2}   Named parameters have several beneﬁts:    They lead to more self-explanatory code because each argument has a descriptive label. Just compare the two versions of selectEntries  : with the second one, it is much easier to see what happens.    The order of the arguments doesn’t matter  as long as the names are correct .   Handling more than one optional parameter is more convenient: callers can easily provide any subset of all optional parameters and don’t have to be aware of the ones they omit  with positional parameters, you have to ﬁll in preceding optional parameters, with undefined .  27.6.7 Simulating named parameters JavaScript doesn’t have real named parameters. The ofﬁcial way of simulating them is via object literals:  function selectEntries {start=0, end=-1, step=1}  {  return {start, end, step};  }  This function uses destructuring to access the properties of its single parameter. The pat- tern it uses is an abbreviation for the following pattern: {start: start=0, end: end=-1, step: step=1}  This destructuring pattern works for empty object literals:   27.6 Parameter handling  251  > selectEntries {}  { start: 0, end: -1, step: 1 }  But it does not work if you call the function without any parameters:  > selectEntries   TypeError: Cannot read property 'start' of undefined  You can ﬁx this by providing a default value for the whole pattern. This default value works the same as default values for simpler parameter deﬁnitions: if the parameter is missing, the default is used.  function selectEntries {start=0, end=-1, step=1} = {}  {  return {start, end, step};  } assert.deepEqual  selectEntries  , { start: 0, end: -1, step: 1 } ;  27.6.8 Spreading  ...  into function calls If you put three dots  ...  in front of the argument of a function call, then you spread it. That means that the argument must be an iterable object and the iterated values all become arguments. In other words, a single argument is expanded into multiple arguments – for example:  function func x, y  {  console.log x ; console.log y ;  } const someIterable = ['a', 'b']; func ...someIterable ;     same as func 'a', 'b'      Output:    'a'    'b'  Spreading and rest parameters use the same syntax  ... , but they serve opposite pur- poses:    Rest parameters are used when deﬁning functions or methods. They collect argu-    Spread arguments are used when calling functions or methods. They turn iterable  ments into Arrays.  objects into arguments.  27.6.8.1 Example: spreading into Math.max   Math.max   returns the largest one of its zero or more arguments. Alas, it can’t be used for Arrays, but spreading gives us a way out:   252  27 Callable values  > Math.max -1, 5, 11, 3  11 > Math.max ...[-1, 5, 11, 3]  11 > Math.max -1, ...[-5, 11], 3  11  27.6.8.2 Example: spreading into Array.prototype.push   Similarly, the Array method .push   destructively adds its zero or more parameters to the end of its Array. JavaScript has no method for destructively appending an Array to another one. Once again, we are saved by spreading:  const arr1 = ['a', 'b']; const arr2 = ['c', 'd'];  arr1.push ...arr2 ; assert.deepEqual arr1, ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] ;  Exercises: Parameter handling    Positional parameters:  test.mjs  exercises callables positional_parameters_    Named parameters: exercises callables named_parameters_test.mjs  27.7 Methods of functions: .call  , .apply  , .bind   Functions are objects and have methods. In this section, we look at three of those meth- ods: .call  , .apply  , and .bind  .  27.7.1 The function method .call   Each function someFunc has the following method:  someFunc.call thisValue, arg1, arg2, arg3 ;  This method invocation is loosely equivalent to the following function call:  someFunc arg1, arg2, arg3 ;  However, with .call  , we can also specify a value for the implicit parameter this. The following code demonstrates the use of .call  :  function func x, y  { return [this, x, y];  }  assert.deepEqual   func.call 'hello', 'a', 'b' , ['hello', 'a', 'b'] ;   27.7 Methods of functions: .call  , .apply  , .bind    253  As we have seen before, if we function-call an ordinary function, its this is undefined:  assert.deepEqual  func 'a', 'b' , [undefined, 'a', 'b'] ;  Therefore, the previous function call is equivalent to:  assert.deepEqual   func.call undefined, 'a', 'b' , [undefined, 'a', 'b'] ;  In arrow functions, the value for this provided via .call   is ignored.  27.7.2 The function method .apply   Each function someFunc has the following method:  someFunc.apply thisValue, [arg1, arg2, arg3] ;  This method invocation is loosely equivalent to the following function call  which uses spreading :  someFunc ...[arg1, arg2, arg3] ;  However, with .apply  , we can also specify a value for the implicit parameter this. The following code demonstrates the use of .apply  :  function func x, y  { return [this, x, y];  }  const args = ['a', 'b']; assert.deepEqual   func.apply 'hello', args , ['hello', 'a', 'b'] ;  27.7.3 The function method .bind   .bind   is another method of function objects. This method is invoked as follows:  const boundFunc = someFunc.bind thisValue, arg1, arg2 ;  .bind   returns a new function boundFunc  . Calling that function invokes someFunc   with this set to thisValue and these parameters: arg1, arg2, followed by the parameters of boundFunc  . That is, the following two function calls are equivalent:  boundFunc 'a', 'b'  someFunc.call thisValue, arg1, arg2, 'a', 'b'    254  27 Callable values  27.7.3.1 An alternative to .bind   Another way of pre-ﬁlling this and parameters is via an arrow function:  const boundFunc2 =  ...args  =>  someFunc.call thisValue, arg1, arg2, ...args ;  27.7.3.2 An implementation of .bind   Considering the previous section, .bind   can be implemented as a real function as fol- lows:  function bind func, thisValue, ...boundArgs  {  return  ...args  =>  func.call thisValue, ...boundArgs, ...args ;  27.7.3.3 Example: binding a real function Using .bind   for real functions is somewhat unintuitive because we have to provide a value for this. Given that it is undefined during function calls, it is usually set to undefined or null. In the following example, we create add8  , a function that has one parameter, by binding the ﬁrst parameter of add   to 8.  }  }  function add x, y  {  return x + y;  const add8 = add.bind undefined, 8 ; assert.equal add8 1 , 9 ;  Quiz See quiz app.   Chapter 28  Evaluating code dynamically: eval  , new Function    advanced   Contents  .  .  .  . . 28.1 eval   . . . 28.2 new Function   . . . 28.3 Recommendations .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . 255 . 256 . 256  In this chapter, we’ll look at two ways of evaluating code dynamically: eval   and new Function  .  28.1 eval   Given a string str with JavaScript code, eval str  evaluates that code and returns the result:  > eval '2 ** 4'  16  There are two ways of invoking eval  :    Directly, via a function call. Then the code in its argument is evaluated inside the  current scope.    Indirectly, not via a function call. Then it evaluates its code in global scope. “Not via a function call” means “anything that looks different than eval ··· ”:    eval.call undefined, '···'     0, eval  '···'   uses the comma operator    globalThis.eval '···'    const e = eval; e '···'   255   28 Evaluating code dynamically: eval  , new Function    advanced   256    Etc.  The following code illustrates the difference:  globalThis.myVariable = 'global'; function func   {  const myVariable = 'local';     Direct eval assert.equal eval 'myVariable' , 'local' ;     Indirect eval assert.equal eval.call undefined, 'myVariable' , 'global' ;  }  Evaluating code in global context is safer because the code has access to fewer internals.  28.2 new Function   new Function   creates a function object and is invoked as follows:  const func = new Function '«param_1»', ···, '«param_n»', '«func_body»' ; The previous statement is equivalent to the next statement. Note that «param_1», etc., are not inside string literals, anymore.  const func = function  «param_1», ···, «param_n»  {  «func_body»  };  In the next example, we create the same function twice, ﬁrst via new Function  , then via a function expression:  const times1 = new Function 'a', 'b', 'return a * b' ; const times2 = function  a, b  { return a * b };  new Function   creates non-strict mode functions  By default, functions created via new Function   are sloppy. If we want the func- tion body to be in strict mode, we have to switch it on manually.  28.3 Recommendations Avoid dynamic evaluation of code as much as you can:    It’s a security risk because it may enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code with  the privileges of your code.    It may be switched off – for example, in browsers, via a Content Security Policy. Very often, JavaScript is dynamic enough so that you don’t need eval   or similar. In the following example, what we are doing with eval    line A  can be achieved just as   28.3 Recommendations  well without it  line B .  const obj = {a: 1, b: 2}; const propKey = 'b';  257  assert.equal eval 'obj.' + propKey , 2 ;     A  assert.equal obj[propKey], 2 ;     B   If you have to dynamically evaluate code:    Prefer new Function   over eval  : it always executes its code in global context  and a function provides a clean interface to the evaluated code.    Prefer indirect eval over direct eval: evaluating code in global context is safer.   258  28 Evaluating code dynamically: eval  , new Function    advanced    Part VI  Modularity  259    Chapter 29  Modules  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  29.5 ECMAScript modules .  29.1.1 Exporting . 29.1.2 Importing .  . . . . 29.2 JavaScript source code formats .  29.1 Overview: syntax of ECMAScript modules . . . . . . .  . . . . 29.5.1 ES modules: syntax, semantics, loader API . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . 29.2.1 Code before built-in modules was written in ECMAScript 5 . . . . . . .  . 262 . 262 . 262 . 263 . 263 . 263 29.3 Before we had modules, we had scripts . 264 29.4 Module systems created prior to ES6 . 29.4.1 Server side: CommonJS modules . 265 29.4.2 Client side: AMD  Asynchronous Module Deﬁnition  modules 265 . 266 29.4.3 Characteristics of JavaScript modules . . 266 . . . 267 . 267 . 267 . 268 . 269 . 269 . 269 . 270 . 271 . 272 . 272 . 273 . 273 . 274 . 275 . 275 . 276  . . . . 29.6 Named exports and imports . . . . . 29.6.1 Named exports . . . 29.6.2 Named imports . . . . 29.6.3 Namespace imports . . 29.6.4 Named exporting styles: inline versus clause  advanced  . . . . . . 29.8.1 Imports are read-only views on exports . . 29.8.2 ESM’s transparent support for cyclic imports  advanced  . . 29.9.1 Packages are installed inside a directory node_modules  . . . 29.9.2 Why can npm be used to install frontend libraries? . . . . . . . . .  . . . 29.7.1 The two styles of default-exporting . . 29.7.2 The default export as a named export  advanced  . .  29.8 More details on exporting and importing .  29.10Naming modules . 29.11Module speciﬁers  29.7 Default exports and imports .  29.9 npm packages .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  261   262  29 Modules  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  29.12.1 Example: loading a module dynamically . 29.12.2 Use cases for import   . . .  29.11.1 Categories of module speciﬁers . 29.11.2 ES module speciﬁers in browsers 29.11.3 ES module speciﬁers on Node.js .  . . . 29.12Loading modules dynamically via import   [ES2020] . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . 29.13import.meta – metadata for the current module [ES2020] . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29.14Polyﬁlls: emulating native web platform features  advanced  . . .  29.13.1 import.meta.url . . . 29.13.2 import.meta.url and class URL . 29.13.3 import.meta.url on Node.js . . .  29.14.1 Sources of this section .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 276 . 276 . 277 . 278 . 278 . 279 . 280 . 280 . 280 . 281 . 282 . 282  29.1 Overview: syntax of ECMAScript modules 29.1.1 Exporting    Named exports export function f   {} export const one = 1; export {foo, b as bar};     Default exports export default function f   {}    declaration with optional name    Replacement for `const`  there must be exactly one value  export default 123;     Re-exporting from another module export {foo, b as bar} from '. some-module.mjs'; export * from '. some-module.mjs'; export * as ns from '. some-module.mjs';    ES2020  29.1.2  Importing    Named imports import {foo, bar as b} from '. some-module.mjs';    Namespace import import * as someModule from '. some-module.mjs';    Default import import someModule from '. some-module.mjs';     Combinations: import someModule, * as someModule from '. some-module.mjs'; import someModule, {foo, bar as b} from '. some-module.mjs';     Empty import  for modules with side effects  import '. some-module.mjs';   JavaScript source code formats  29.3 Before we had modules, we had scripts 29.2 The current landscape of JavaScript modules is quite diverse: ES6 brought built-in mod- ules, but the source code formats that came before them, are still around, too. Under- standing the latter helps understand the former, so let’s investigate. The next sections describe the following ways of delivering JavaScript source code:  263    Scripts are code fragments that browsers run in global scope. They are precursors    CommonJS modules are a module format that is mainly used on servers  e.g., via    AMD modules are a module format that is mainly used in browsers.   ECMAScript modules are JavaScript’s built-in module format. It supersedes all pre-  of modules.  Node.js .  vious formats.  Tbl. 29.1 gives an overview of these code formats. Note that for CommonJS modules and ECMAScript modules, two ﬁlename extensions are commonly used. Which one is appropriate depends on how you want to use a ﬁle. Details are given later in this chapter.  Table 29.1: Ways of delivering JavaScript source code.  Script CommonJS module AMD module ECMAScript module  Runs on browsers servers browsers browsers and servers  Loaded async sync async async  Filename ext. .js .js .cjs .js .js .mjs  29.2.1 Code before built-in modules was written in ECMAScript 5 Before we get to built-in modules  which were introduced with ES6 , all code that you’ll see, will be written in ES5. Among other things:   ES5 did not have const and let, only var.   ES5 did not have arrow functions, only function expressions.  29.3 Before we had modules, we had scripts Initially, browsers only had scripts – pieces of code that were executed in global scope. As an example, consider an HTML ﬁle that loads script ﬁles via the following HTML:            The main ﬁle is my-module.js, where we simulate a module:  var myModule =  function    {    Open IIFE     Imports  via global variables  var importedFunc1 = otherModule1.importedFunc1;   264  29 Modules  var importedFunc2 = otherModule2.importedFunc2;     Body function internalFunc   {     ···  } function exportedFunc   {  importedFunc1  ; importedFunc2  ; internalFunc  ;  }  };     Exports  assigned to global variable `myModule`  return {  exportedFunc: exportedFunc,  }   ;    Close IIFE  myModule is a global variable that is assigned the result of immediately invoking a func- tion expression. The function expression starts in the ﬁrst line. It is invoked in the last line. This way of wrapping a code fragment is called immediately invoked function expression  IIFE, coined by Ben Alman . What do we gain from an IIFE? var is not block-scoped  like const and let , it is function-scoped: the only way to create new scopes for var- declared variables is via functions or methods  with const and let, you can use either functions, methods, or blocks {} . Therefore, the IIFE in the example hides all of the following variables from global scope and minimizes name clashes: importedFunc1, im- portedFunc2, internalFunc, exportedFunc. Note that we are using an IIFE in a particular manner: at the end, we pick what we want to export and return it via an object literal. That is called the revealing module pattern  coined by Christian Heilmann . This way of simulating modules, has several issues:    Libraries in script ﬁles export and import functionality via global variables, which  risks name clashes.    Dependencies are not stated explicitly, and there is no built-in way for a script to load the scripts it depends on. Therefore, the web page has to load not just the scripts that are needed by the page but also the dependencies of those scripts, the dependencies’ dependencies, etc. And it has to do so in the right order!  29.4 Module systems created prior to ES6 Prior to ECMAScript 6, JavaScript did not have built-in modules. Therefore, the ﬂexi- ble syntax of the language was used to implement custom module systems within the language. Two popular ones are:    CommonJS  targeting the server side    29.4 Module systems created prior to ES6  265    AMD  Asynchronous Module Deﬁnition, targeting the client side   29.4.1 Server side: CommonJS modules The original CommonJS standard for modules was created for server and desktop plat- forms. It was the foundation of the original Node.js module system, where it achieved enormous popularity. Contributing to that popularity were the npm package manager for Node and tools that enabled using Node modules on the client side  browserify, web- pack, and others . From now on, CommonJS module means the Node.js version of this standard  which has a few additional features . This is an example of a CommonJS module:     Imports var importedFunc1 = require '. other-module1.js' .importedFunc1; var importedFunc2 = require '. other-module2.js' .importedFunc2;     Body function internalFunc   {     ···  } function exportedFunc   {  importedFunc1  ; importedFunc2  ; internalFunc  ;  }  };     Exports module.exports = {  exportedFunc: exportedFunc,  CommonJS can be characterized as follows:    Designed for servers.   Modules are meant to be loaded synchronously  the importer waits while the im-  ported module is loaded and executed .    Compact syntax.  29.4.2 Client side: AMD  Asynchronous Module Deﬁnition  modules The AMD module format was created to be easier to use in browsers than the CommonJS format. Its most popular implementation is RequireJS. The following is an example of an AMD module.  define ['. other-module1.js', '. other-module2.js'],  function  otherModule1, otherModule2  {  var importedFunc1 = otherModule1.importedFunc1; var importedFunc2 = otherModule2.importedFunc2;  function internalFunc   {   266  29 Modules     ···  } function exportedFunc   {  importedFunc1  ; importedFunc2  ; internalFunc  ;  }  return {  }; } ;  exportedFunc: exportedFunc,  AMD can be characterized as follows:    Designed for browsers.   Modules are meant to be loaded asynchronously. That’s a crucial requirement for browsers, where code can’t wait until a module has ﬁnished downloading. It has to be notiﬁed once the module is available.    The syntax is slightly more complicated.  On the plus side, AMD modules can be executed directly. In contrast, CommonJS mod- ules must either be compiled before deployment or custom source code must be gen- erated and evaluated dynamically  think eval   . That isn’t always permitted on the web.  29.4.3 Characteristics of JavaScript modules Looking at CommonJS and AMD, similarities between JavaScript module systems emerge:    There is one module per ﬁle.   Such a ﬁle is basically a piece of code that is executed:  – Local scope: The code is executed in a local “module scope”. Therefore, by default, all of the variables, functions, and classes declared in it are internal and not global.  – Exports: If you want any declared entity to be exported, you must explicitly  mark it as an export.  – Imports: Each module can import exported entities from other modules. Those other modules are identiﬁed via module speciﬁers  usually paths, occasionally full URLs .    Modules are singletons: Even if a module is imported multiple times, only a single  “instance” of it exists.    No global variables are used. Instead, module speciﬁers serve as global IDs.  29.5 ECMAScript modules ECMAScript modules  ES modules or ESM  were introduced with ES6. They continue the tradition of JavaScript modules and have all of their aforementioned characteristics. Ad- ditionally:   29.6 Named exports and imports  267    With CommonJS, ES modules share the compact syntax and support for cyclic de-  pendencies.    With AMD, ES modules share being designed for asynchronous loading.  ES modules also have new beneﬁts:    The syntax is even more compact than CommonJS’s.   Modules have static structures  which can’t be changed at runtime . That helps with static checking, optimized access of imports, dead code elimination, and more.    Support for cyclic imports is completely transparent.  This is an example of ES module syntax:  import {importedFunc1} from '. other-module1.mjs'; import {importedFunc2} from '. other-module2.mjs';  function internalFunc   {  ···  export function exportedFunc   {  importedFunc1  ; importedFunc2  ; internalFunc  ;  }  }  From now on, “module” means “ECMAScript module”.  29.5.1 ES modules: syntax, semantics, loader API The full standard of ES modules comprises the following parts:  1. Syntax  how code is written : What is a module? How are imports and exports  declared? Etc.  2. Semantics  how code is executed : How are variable bindings exported? How are  imports connected with exports? Etc.  3. A programmatic loader API for conﬁguring module loading. Parts 1 and 2 were introduced with ES6. Work on part 3 is ongoing.  29.6 Named exports and imports 29.6.1 Named exports Each module can have zero or more named exports. As an example, consider the following two ﬁles:  lib my-math.mjs main.mjs  Module my-math.mjs has two named exports: square and LIGHTSPEED.   268  29 Modules     Not exported, private to module function times a, b  {  return a * b;  } export function square x  {  return times x, x ;  } export const LIGHTSPEED = 299792458;  To export something, we put the keyword export in front of a declaration. Entities that are not exported are private to a module and can’t be accessed from outside.  29.6.2 Named imports Module main.mjs has a single named import, square:  import {square} from '. lib my-math.mjs'; assert.equal square 3 , 9 ;  It can also rename its import:  import {square as sq} from '. lib my-math.mjs'; assert.equal sq 3 , 9 ;  29.6.2.1 Syntactic pitfall: named importing is not destructuring Both named importing and destructuring look similar:  import {foo} from '. bar.mjs';    import const {foo} = require '. bar.mjs' ;    destructuring  But they are quite different:    Imports remain connected with their exports.   You can destructure again inside a destructuring pattern, but the {} in an import  statement can’t be nested.    The syntax for renaming is different:  import {foo as f} from '. bar.mjs';    importing const {foo: f} = require '. bar.mjs' ;    destructuring  Rationale: Destructuring is reminiscent of an object literal  including nesting , while importing evokes the idea of renaming.  Exercise: Named exports  exercises modules export_named_test.mjs   29.7 Default exports and imports  269  29.6.3 Namespace imports Namespace imports are an alternative to named imports. If we namespace-import a mod- ule, it becomes an object whose properties are the named exports. This is what main.mjs looks like if we use a namespace import:  import * as myMath from '. lib my-math.mjs'; assert.equal myMath.square 3 , 9 ;  assert.deepEqual   Object.keys myMath , ['LIGHTSPEED', 'square'] ;  29.6.4 Named exporting styles: inline versus clause  advanced  The named export style we have seen so far was inline: We exported entities by preﬁxing them with the keyword export. But we can also use separate export clauses. For example, this is what lib my-math.mjs looks like with an export clause:  function times a, b  {  return a * b;  } function square x  { return times x, x ;  } const LIGHTSPEED = 299792458;  function times a, b  {  return a * b;  } function sq x  {  return times x, x ;  } const LS = 299792458;  export { square, LIGHTSPEED };    semicolon!  With an export clause, we can rename before exporting and use different names inter- nally:  export {  };  sq as square, LS as LIGHTSPEED,    trailing comma is optional  29.7 Default exports and imports Each module can have at most one default export. The idea is that the module is the default- exported value.   270  29 Modules  Avoid mixing named exports and default exports  A module can have both named exports and a default export, but it’s usually better to stick to one export style per module.  As an example for default exports, consider the following two ﬁles:  my-func.mjs main.mjs  Module my-func.mjs has a default export:  const GREETING = 'Hello!'; export default function    {  return GREETING;  }  Module main.mjs default-imports the exported function:  import myFunc from '. my-func.mjs'; assert.equal myFunc  , 'Hello!' ;  Note the syntactic difference: the curly braces around named imports indicate that we are reaching into the module, while a default import is the module.  What are use cases for default exports?  The most common use case for a default export is a module that contains a single function or a single class.  29.7.1 The two styles of default-exporting There are two styles of doing default exports. First, you can label existing declarations with export default:  export default function foo   {}    no semicolon! export default class Bar {}    no semicolon!  Second, you can directly default-export values. In that style, export default is itself much like a declaration.  export default 'abc'; export default foo  ; export default  ^xyz$ ; export default 5 * 7; export default { no: false, yes: true };   29.7 Default exports and imports  271  29.7.1.1 Why are there two default export styles? The reason is that export default can’t be used to label const: const may deﬁne multi- ple values, but export default needs exactly one value. Consider the following hypo- thetical code:     Not legal JavaScript! export default const foo = 1, bar = 2, baz = 3;  With this code, you don’t know which one of the three values is the default export.  Exercise: Default exports  exercises modules export_default_test.mjs  29.7.2 The default export as a named export  advanced  Internally, a default export is simply a named export whose name is default. As an example, consider the previous module my-func.mjs with a default export:  The following module my-func2.mjs is equivalent to that module:  const GREETING = 'Hello!'; export default function    {  return GREETING;  }  }  };  const GREETING = 'Hello!'; function greet   { return GREETING;  export {  greet as default,  For importing, we can use a normal default import:  import myFunc from '. my-func2.mjs'; assert.equal myFunc  , 'Hello!' ;  Or we can use a named import:  import {default as myFunc} from '. my-func2.mjs'; assert.equal myFunc  , 'Hello!' ;  The default export is also available via property .default of namespace imports:  import * as mf from '. my-func2.mjs'; assert.equal mf.default  , 'Hello!' ;   272  29 Modules  Isn’t default illegal as a variable name?  default can’t be a variable name, but it can be an export name and it can be a property name:  const obj = {  default: 123,  }; assert.equal obj.default, 123 ;  Imports are read-only views on exports  29.8 More details on exporting and importing 29.8.1 So far, we have used imports and exports intuitively, and everything seems to have worked as expected. But now it is time to take a closer look at how imports and exports are really related. Consider the following two modules:  counter.mjs main.mjs  counter.mjs exports a  mutable!  variable and a function:  export let counter = 3; export function incCounter   {  counter++;  }  main.mjs name-imports both exports. When we use incCounter  , we discover that the connection to counter is live – we can always access the live state of that variable:  import { counter, incCounter } from '. counter.mjs';     The imported value `counter` is live assert.equal counter, 3 ; incCounter  ; assert.equal counter, 4 ;  Note that while the connection is live and we can read counter, we cannot change this variable  e.g., via counter++ . There are two beneﬁts to handling imports this way:    It is easier to split modules because previously shared variables can become ex-    This behavior is crucial for supporting transparent cyclic imports. Read on for  ports.  more information.   29.9 npm packages  273  29.8.2 ESM’s transparent support for cyclic imports  advanced  ESM supports cyclic imports transparently. To understand how that is achieved, consider the following example: ﬁg. 29.1 shows a directed graph of modules importing other modules. P importing M is the cycle in this case.  Figure 29.1: A directed graph of modules importing modules: M imports N and O, N imports P and Q, etc.  After parsing, these modules are set up in two phases:    Instantiation: Every module is visited and its imports are connected to its exports.  Before a parent can be instantiated, all of its children must be instantiated.    Evaluation: The bodies of the modules are executed. Once again, children are  evaluated before parents.  This approach handles cyclic imports correctly, due to two features of ES modules:    Due to the static structure of ES modules, the exports are already known after parsing. That makes it possible to instantiate P before its child M: P can already look up M’s exports.    When P is evaluated, M hasn’t been evaluated, yet. However, entities in P can already mention imports from M. They just can’t use them, yet, because the im- ported values are ﬁlled in later. For example, a function in P can access an import from M. The only limitation is that we must wait until after the evaluation of M, before calling that function. Imports being ﬁlled in later is enabled by them being “live immutable views” on exports.  29.9 npm packages The npm software registry is the dominant way of distributing JavaScript libraries and apps for Node.js and web browsers. It is managed via the npm package manager  short: npm . Software is distributed as so-called packages. A package is a directory containing arbitrary ﬁles and a ﬁle package.json at the top level that describes the package. For example, when npm creates an empty package inside a directory my-package , you get this package.json:  {  "name": "my-package",  M  N  Q  O  R  P  S   274  29 Modules  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"  "version": "1.0.0", "description": "", "main": "index.js", "scripts": {  }, "keywords": [], "author": "", "license": "ISC"  }  Some of these properties contain simple metadata:  three numbers:    name speciﬁes the name of this package. Once it is uploaded to the npm registry, it  can be installed via npm install my-package.    version is used for version management and follows semantic versioning, with  – Major version: is incremented when incompatible API changes are made. – Minor version: is incremented when functionality is added in a backward  compatible manner.  – Patch version: is incremented when backward compatible changes are made.    description, keywords, author make it easier to ﬁnd packages.   license clariﬁes how you can use this package.  Other properties enable advanced conﬁguration:    main: speciﬁes the module that “is” the package  explained later in this chapter .   scripts: are commands that you can execute via npm run. For example, the script  test can be executed via npm run test.  For more information on package.json, consult the npm documentation.  29.9.1 Packages are installed inside a directory node_modules  npm always installs packages inside a directory node_modules. There are usually many of these directories. Which one npm uses, depends on the directory where one currently is. For example, if we are inside a directory  tmp a b , npm tries to ﬁnd a node_modules in the current directory, its parent directory, the parent directory of the parent, etc. In other words, it searches the following chain of locations:     tmp a b node_modules    tmp a node_modules    tmp node_modules  When installing a package some-pkg, npm uses the closest node_modules. If, for example, we are inside  tmp a b  and there is a node_modules in that directory, then npm puts the package inside the directory:   tmp a b node_modules some-pkg   When importing a module, we can use a special module speciﬁer to tell Node.js that we want to import it from an installed package. How exactly that works, is explained later. For now, consider the following example:   29.10 Naming modules  275      home jane proj main.mjs import * as theModule from 'the-package the-module.mjs';  To ﬁnd the-module.mjs  Node.js prefers the ﬁlename extension .mjs for ES modules , Node.js walks up the node_module chain and searches the following locations:     home jane proj node_modules the-package the-module.mjs    home jane node_modules the-package the-module.mjs    home node_modules the-package the-module.mjs  29.9.2 Why can npm be used to install frontend libraries? Finding installed modules in node_modules directories is only supported on Node.js. So why can we also use npm to install libraries for browsers? That is enabled via bundling tools, such as webpack, that compile and optimize code before it is deployed online. During this compilation process, the code in npm packages is adapted so that it works in browsers.  29.10 Naming modules There are no established best practices for naming module ﬁles and the variables they are imported into. In this chapter, I’m using the following naming style:    The names of module ﬁles are dash-cased and start with lowercase letters:  . my-module.mjs . some-func.mjs    The names of namespace imports are lowercased and camel-cased:  import * as myModule from '. my-module.mjs';    The names of default imports are lowercased and camel-cased:  import someFunc from '. some-func.mjs';  What are the rationales behind this style?    npm doesn’t allow uppercase letters in package names  source . Thus, we avoid camel case, so that “local” ﬁles have names that are consistent with those of npm packages. Using only lowercase letters also minimizes conﬂicts between ﬁle sys- tems that are case-sensitive and ﬁle systems that aren’t: the former distinguish ﬁles whose names have the same letters, but with different cases; the latter don’t.    There are clear rules for translating dash-cased ﬁle names to camel-cased JavaScript variable names. Due to how we name namespace imports, these rules work for both namespace imports and default imports.  I also like underscore-cased module ﬁle names because you can directly use these names for namespace imports  without any translation :  import * as my_module from '. my_module.mjs';   276  29 Modules  But that style does not work for default imports: I like underscore-casing for namespace objects, but it is not a good choice for functions, etc.  29.11 Module speciﬁers Module speciﬁers are the strings that identify modules. They work slightly differently in browsers and Node.js. Before we can look at the differences, we need to learn about the different categories of module speciﬁers.  29.11.1 Categories of module speciﬁers In ES modules, we distinguish the following categories of speciﬁers. These categories originated with CommonJS modules.    Relative path: starts with a dot. Examples:  '. some other module.mjs' '.. .. lib counter.mjs'    Absolute path: starts with a slash. Example:  ' home jane file-tools.mjs'    URL: includes a protocol  technically, paths are URLs, too . Examples:  'https:  example.com some-module.mjs' 'file:   home john tmp main.mjs'    Bare path: does not start with a dot, a slash or a protocol, and consists of a single  ﬁlename without an extension. Examples:  'lodash' 'the-package'    Deep import path: starts with a bare path and has at least one slash. Example:  'the-package dist the-module.mjs'  29.11.2 ES module speciﬁers in browsers Browsers handle module speciﬁers as follows:    Relative paths, absolute paths, and URLs work as expected. They all must point to real ﬁles  in contrast to CommonJS, which lets you omit ﬁlename extensions and more .    The ﬁle name extensions of modules don’t matter, as long as they are served with  the content type text javascript.    How bare paths will end up being handled is not yet clear. You will probably  eventually be able to map them to other speciﬁers via lookup tables.  Note that bundling tools such as webpack, which combine modules into fewer ﬁles, are often less strict with speciﬁers than browsers. That’s because they operate at build - compile time  not at runtime  and can search for ﬁles by traversing the ﬁle system.   29.11 Module speciﬁers  277  29.11.3 ES module speciﬁers on Node.js Node.js handles module speciﬁers as follows:    Relative paths are resolved as they are in web browsers – relative to the path of the  current module.    Absolute paths are currently not supported. As a workaround, you can use URLs  that start with file:   . You can create such URLs via url.pathToFileURL  .    Only file: is supported as a protocol for URL speciﬁers.   A bare path is interpreted as a package name and resolved relative to the closest node_modules directory. What module should be loaded, is determined by looking at property "main" of the package’s package.json  similarly to CommonJS .    Deep import paths are also resolved relatively to the closest node_modules direc-  tory. They contain ﬁle names, so it is always clear which module is meant.  All speciﬁers, except bare paths, must refer to actual ﬁles. That is, ESM does not support the following CommonJS features:    CommonJS automatically adds missing ﬁlename extensions.   CommonJS can import a directory dir if there is a dir package.json with a "main"  property.    CommonJS can import a directory dir if there is a module dir index.js.  All built-in Node.js modules are available via bare paths and have named ESM exports – for example:  import * as assert from 'assert strict'; import * as path from 'path';  assert.equal   path.join 'a b c', '.. d' , 'a b d' ;  29.11.3.1 Filename extensions on Node.js Node.js supports the following default ﬁlename extensions:    .mjs for ES modules   .cjs for CommonJS modules  The ﬁlename extension .js stands for either ESM or CommonJS. Which one it is is conﬁg- ured via the “closest” package.json  in the current directory, the parent directory, etc. . Using package.json in this manner is independent of packages. In that package.json, there is a property "type", which has two settings:    "commonjs"  the default : ﬁles with the extension .js or without an extension are  interpreted as CommonJS modules.    "module": ﬁles with the extension .js or without an extension are interpreted as  ESM modules.   278  29 Modules  Interpreting non-ﬁle source code as either CommonJS or ESM  29.11.3.2 Not all source code executed by Node.js comes from ﬁles. You can also send it code via stdin, --eval, and --print. The command line option --input-type lets you specify how such code is interpreted:    As CommonJS  the default : --input-type=commonjs   As ESM: --input-type=module  29.12 Loading modules dynamically via import   [ES2020] So far, the only way to import a module has been via an import statement. That statement has several limitations:    You must use it at the top level of a module. That is, you can’t, for example, import  something when you are inside a block.    The module speciﬁer is always ﬁxed. That is, you can’t change what you import  depending on a condition. And you can’t assemble a speciﬁer dynamically.  The import   operator changes that. Let’s look at an example of it being used.  29.12.1 Example: loading a module dynamically Consider the following ﬁles:  lib my-math.mjs main1.mjs main2.mjs  We have already seen module my-math.mjs:    Not exported, private to module function times a, b  {  return a * b;  } export function square x  {  return times x, x ;  } export const LIGHTSPEED = 299792458;  This is what using import   looks like in main1.mjs:  const dir = '. lib '; const moduleSpecifier = dir + 'my-math.mjs';  function loadConstant   {  return import moduleSpecifier  .then myMath => {  const result = myMath.LIGHTSPEED; assert.equal result, 299792458 ; return result;   29.12 Loading modules dynamically via import   [ES2020]  279  } ;  }  Method .then   is part of Promises, a mechanism for handling asynchronous results, which is covered later in this book.  Two things in this code weren’t possible before:    We are importing inside a function  not at the top level .   The module speciﬁer comes from a variable.  Next, we’ll implement the exact same functionality in main2.mjs but via a so-called async function, which provides nicer syntax for Promises.  const dir = '. lib '; const moduleSpecifier = dir + 'my-math.mjs';  async function loadConstant   {  const myMath = await import moduleSpecifier ; const result = myMath.LIGHTSPEED; assert.equal result, 299792458 ; return result;  }  Why is import   an operator and not a function?  Even though it works much like a function, import   is an operator: in order to resolve module speciﬁers relatively to the current module, it needs to know from which module it is invoked. A normal function cannot receive this information as implicitly as an operator can. It would need, for example, a parameter.  29.12.2 Use cases for import   29.12.2.1 Loading code on demand Some functionality of web apps doesn’t have to be present when they start, it can be loaded on demand. Then import   helps because you can put such functionality into modules – for example:  button.addEventListener 'click', event => {  import '. dialogBox.mjs'   .then dialogBox => { dialogBox.open  ;  }  .catch error => {   * Error handling *   }   } ;   280  29 Modules  29.12.2.2 Conditional loading of modules We may want to load a module depending on whether a condition is true. For example, a module with a polyﬁll that makes a new feature available on legacy platforms:  if  isLegacyPlatform    {  import '. my-polyfill.mjs'   .then ··· ;  }  29.12.2.3 Computed module speciﬁers For applications such as internationalization, it helps if you can dynamically compute module speciﬁers:  import `messages_${getLocale  }.mjs`   .then ··· ;  29.13 import.meta – metadata for the current module  [ES2020]  The object import.meta holds metadata for the current module.  29.13.1 import.meta.url The most important property of import.meta is .url which contains a string with the URL of the current module ﬁle – for example: 'https:  example.com code main.mjs'  29.13.2 import.meta.url and class URL Class URL is available via a global variable in browsers and on Node.js. You can look up its full functionality in the Node.js documentation. When working with import.meta.url, its constructor is especially useful:  new URL input: string, base?: stringURL   Parameter input contains the URL to be parsed. It can be relative if the second parameter, base, is provided. In other words, this constructor lets us resolve a relative path against a base URL:  > new URL 'other.mjs', 'https:  example.com code main.mjs' .href 'https:  example.com code other.mjs' > new URL '.. other.mjs', 'https:  example.com code main.mjs' .href 'https:  example.com other.mjs'  This is how we get a URL instance that points to a ﬁle data.txt that sits next to the current module:  const urlOfData = new URL 'data.txt', import.meta.url ;   29.13 import.meta – metadata for the current module [ES2020]  281  29.13.3 import.meta.url on Node.js On Node.js, import.meta.url is always a string with a file: URL – for example:  'file:   Users rauschma my-module.mjs'  29.13.3.1 Example: reading a sibling ﬁle of a module Many Node.js ﬁle system operations accept either strings with paths or instances of URL. That enables us to read a sibling ﬁle data.txt of the current module:  import * as fs from 'fs'; function readData   {     data.txt sits next to current module const urlOfData = new URL 'data.txt', import.meta.url ; return fs.readFileSync urlOfData, {encoding: 'UTF-8'} ;  }  29.13.3.2 Module fs and URLs For most functions of the module fs, we can refer to ﬁles via:    Paths – in strings or instances of Buffer.   URLs – in instances of URL  with the protocol file:   For more information on this topic, see the Node.js API documentation.  29.13.3.3 Converting between file: URLs and paths The Node.js module url has two functions for converting between file: URLs and paths:    fileURLToPath url: URLstring : string  Converts a file: URL to a path.    pathToFileURL path: string : URL  Converts a path to a file: URL.  If you need a path that can be used in the local ﬁle system, then property .pathname of URL instances does not always work:  assert.equal   new URL 'file:   tmp with%20space.txt' .pathname, ' tmp with%20space.txt' ;  Therefore, it is better to use fileURLToPath  :  import * as url from 'url'; assert.equal   url.fileURLToPath 'file:   tmp with%20space.txt' , ' tmp with space.txt' ;    result on Unix  Similarly, pathToFileURL   does more than just prepend 'file:  ' to an absolute path.   282 29 Modules 29.14 Polyﬁlls: emulating native web platform features   advanced   Backends have polyﬁlls, too  This section is about frontend development and web browsers, but similar ideas apply to backend development.  Polyﬁlls help with a conﬂict that we are facing when developing a web application in JavaScript:    On one hand, we want to use modern web platform features that make the app  better and or development easier.    On the other hand, the app should run on as many browsers as possible.  Given a web platform feature X:    A polyﬁll for X is a piece of code. If it is executed on a platform that already has built- in support for X, it does nothing. Otherwise, it makes the feature available on the platform. In the latter case, the polyﬁlled feature is  mostly  indistinguishable from a native implementation. In order to achieve that, the polyﬁll usually makes global changes. For example, it may modify global data or conﬁgure a global module loader. Polyﬁlls are often packaged as modules.  – The term polyﬁll was coined by Remy Sharp.    A speculative polyﬁll is a polyﬁll for a proposed web platform feature  that is not  standardized, yet .  – Alternative term: prollyﬁll    A replica of X is a library that reproduces the API and functionality of X locally. Such a library exists independently of a native  and global  implementation of X.  – Replica is a new term introduced in this section. Alternative term: ponyﬁll    There is also the term shim, but it doesn’t have a universally agreed upon deﬁnition.  It often means roughly the same as polyﬁll.  Every time our web applications starts, it must ﬁrst execute all polyﬁlls for features that may not be available everywhere. Afterwards, we can be sure that those features are available natively.  29.14.1 Sources of this section    “What is a Polyﬁll?” by Remy Sharp   Inspiration for the term replica: The Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas   Useful clariﬁcation of “polyﬁll” and related terms: “Polyﬁlls and the evolution of  the Web”.

This chapter covers step 1; the next chapter covers steps 2–4. The steps are  ﬁg. 30.1 :  1. Single objects  this chapter : How do objects, JavaScript’s basic OOP building  blocks, work in isolation?  2. Prototype chains  next chapter : Each object has a chain of zero or more prototype  objects. Prototypes are JavaScript’s core inheritance mechanism.  3. Classes  next chapter : JavaScript’s classes are factories for objects. The relation-  ship between a class and its instances is based on prototypal inheritance.  4. Subclassing  next chapter : The relationship between a subclass and its superclass  is also based on prototypal inheritance.

In JavaScript:    An object is a set of properties  key-value entries .   A property key can only be a string or a symbol.  30.1.1 Roles of objects: record vs. dictionary Objects play two roles in JavaScript:    Records: Objects-as-records have a ﬁxed number of properties, whose keys are  known at development time. Their values can have different types.    Dictionaries: Objects-as-dictionaries have a variable number of properties, whose keys are not known at development time. All of their values have the same type.  These roles inﬂuence how objects are explained in this chapter:    First, we’ll explore objects-as-records. Even though property keys are strings or symbols under the hood, they will appear as ﬁxed identiﬁers to us, in this part of the chapter.    Later, we’ll explore objects-as-dictionaries. Note that Maps are usually better dic- tionaries than objects. However, some of the operations that we’ll encounter, can also be useful for objects-as-records.  30.2 Objects as records Let’s ﬁrst explore the role record of objects.  30.2.1 Object literals: properties Object literals are one way of creating objects-as-records. They are a stand-out feature of JavaScript: we can directly create objects – no need for classes! This is an example:  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',    optional trailing comma  };  In the example, we created an object via an object literal, which starts and ends with curly braces {}. Inside it, we deﬁned two properties  key-value entries :   The ﬁrst property has the key first and the value 'Jane'.   The second property has the key last and the value 'Doe'.  Since ES5, trailing commas are allowed in object literals. We will later see other ways of specifying property keys, but with this way of specifying them, they must follow the rules of JavaScript variable names. For example, we can use first_name as a property key, but not first-name . However, reserved words are allowed:   286  const obj = {  if: true, const: true,  };  30 Single objects  In order to check the effects of various operations on objects, we’ll occasionally use Ob- ject.keys   in this part of the chapter. It lists property keys:  > Object.keys {a:1, b:2}  [ 'a', 'b' ]  30.2.2 Object literals: property value shorthands Whenever the value of a property is deﬁned via a variable name and that name is the same as the key, we can omit the key.  function createPoint x, y  {  return {x, y};  } assert.deepEqual   createPoint 9, 2 , { x: 9, y: 2 }   ;  30.2.3 Getting properties This is how we get  read  a property  line A :  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',  };     Get property .first assert.equal jane.first, 'Jane' ;     A  Getting an unknown property produces undefined:  assert.equal jane.unknownProperty, undefined ;  30.2.4 Setting properties This is how we set  write to  a property:  const obj = {  prop: 1,  }; assert.equal obj.prop, 1 ; obj.prop = 2;     A  assert.equal obj.prop, 2 ;   30.2 Objects as records  287  We just changed an existing property via setting. If we set an unknown property, we create a new entry:  const obj = {};    empty object assert.deepEqual   Object.keys obj , [] ;  obj.unknownProperty = 'abc'; assert.deepEqual   Object.keys obj , ['unknownProperty'] ;  30.2.5 Object literals: methods The following code shows how to create the method .says   via an object literal:  const jane = {  first: 'Jane',    data property says text  {     method  return `${this.first} says “${text}”`;     A   },    comma as separator  optional at end   }; assert.equal jane.says 'hello' , 'Jane says “hello”' ;  During the method call jane.says 'hello' , jane is called the receiver of the method call and assigned to the special variable this  more on this in §30.4 “Methods and the special variable this” . That enables method .says   to access the sibling property .first in line A.  30.2.6 Object literals: accessors There are two kinds of accessors in JavaScript:    A getter is a method-like entity that is invoked by getting a property.   A setter is a method-like entity that is invoked by setting a property.  30.2.6.1 Getters A getter is created by preﬁxing a method deﬁnition with the modiﬁer get:  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe', get full   {  },  };  return `${this.first} ${this.last}`;  assert.equal jane.full, 'Jane Doe' ; jane.first = 'John'; assert.equal jane.full, 'John Doe' ;   288  30 Single objects  30.2.6.2 Setters A setter is created by preﬁxing a method deﬁnition with the modiﬁer set:  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe', set full fullName  {  const parts = fullName.split ' ' ; this.first = parts[0]; this.last = parts[1];  },  };  jane.full = 'Richard Roe'; assert.equal jane.first, 'Richard' ; assert.equal jane.last, 'Roe' ;  Exercise: Creating an object via an object literal  exercises single-objects color_point_object_test.mjs  30.3 Spreading into object literals  ...  [ES2018] Inside a function call, spreading  ...  turns the iterated values of an iterable object into arguments. Inside an object literal, a spread property adds the properties of another object to the current one:  > const obj = {foo: 1, bar: 2}; > {...obj, baz: 3} { foo: 1, bar: 2, baz: 3 }  If property keys clash, the property that is mentioned last “wins”:  > const obj = {foo: 1, bar: 2, baz: 3}; > {...obj, foo: true} { foo: true, bar: 2, baz: 3 } > {foo: true, ...obj} { foo: 1, bar: 2, baz: 3 }  All values are spreadable, even undefined and null:  > {...undefined} {} > {...null} {} > {...123} {} > {...'abc'}   30.3 Spreading into object literals  ...  [ES2018]  289  { '0': 'a', '1': 'b', '2': 'c' } > {...['a', 'b']} { '0': 'a', '1': 'b' }  Property .length of strings and of Arrays is hidden from this kind of operation  it is not enumerable; see §30.8.3 “Property attributes and property descriptors [ES5]” for more information .  30.3.1 Use case for spreading: copying objects We can use spreading to create a copy of an object original:  const copy = {...original};  Caveat – copying is shallow: copy is a fresh object with duplicates of all properties  key- value entries  of original. But if property values are objects, then those are not copied themselves; they are shared between original and copy. Let’s look at an example:  const original = { a: 1, b: {foo: true} }; const copy = {...original};  The ﬁrst level of copy is really a copy: If we change any properties at that level, it does not affect the original:  copy.a = 2; assert.deepEqual   original, { a: 1, b: {foo: true} } ;    no change  However, deeper levels are not copied. For example, the value of .b is shared between original and copy. Changing .b in the copy also changes it in the original.  copy.b.foo = false; assert.deepEqual   original, { a: 1, b: {foo: false} } ;  JavaScript doesn’t have built-in support for deep copying  Deep copies of objects  where all levels are copied  are notoriously difﬁcult to do generically. Therefore, JavaScript does not have a built-in operation for them  for now . If we need such an operation, we have to implement it ourselves.  30.3.2 Use case for spreading: default values for missing properties If one of the inputs of our code is an object with data, we can make properties optional by specifying default values that are used if those properties are missing. One technique for doing so is via an object whose properties contain the default values. In the following example, that object is DEFAULTS:  const DEFAULTS = {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}; const providedData = {foo: 1};   290  30 Single objects  const allData = {...DEFAULTS, ...providedData}; assert.deepEqual allData, {foo: 1, bar: 'b'} ;  The result, the object allData, is created by copying DEFAULTS and overriding its proper- ties with those of providedData. But we don’t need an object to specify the default values; we can also specify them inside the object literal, individually:  const providedData = {foo: 1};  const allData = {foo: 'a', bar: 'b', ...providedData}; assert.deepEqual allData, {foo: 1, bar: 'b'} ;  30.3.3 Use case for spreading: non-destructively changing properties So far, we have encountered one way of changing a property .foo of an object: We set it  line A  and mutate the object. That is, this way of changing a property is destructive.  const obj = {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}; obj.foo = 1;     A  assert.deepEqual obj, {foo: 1, bar: 'b'} ;  With spreading, we can change .foo non-destructively – we make a copy of obj where .foo has a different value:  const obj = {foo: 'a', bar: 'b'}; const updatedObj = {...obj, foo: 1}; assert.deepEqual updatedObj, {foo: 1, bar: 'b'} ;  Exercise: Non-destructively updating a property via spreading  ﬁxed key   exercises single-objects update_name_test.mjs  30.4 Methods and the special variable this 30.4.1 Methods are properties whose values are functions Let’s revisit the example that was used to introduce methods:  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', says text  {  },  };  return `${this.first} says “${text}”`;  Somewhat surprisingly, methods are functions:  assert.equal typeof jane.says, 'function' ;   30.4 Methods and the special variable this  291  Why is that? We learned in the chapter on callable values, that ordinary functions play several roles. Method is one of those roles. Therefore, under the hood, jane roughly looks as follows.  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', says: function  text  {  return `${this.first} says “${text}”`;  },  };  30.4.2 The special variable this Consider the following code:  const obj = {  someMethod x, y  {  assert.equal this, obj ;     A  assert.equal x, 'a' ; assert.equal y, 'b' ;  }  }; obj.someMethod 'a', 'b' ;     B   In line B, obj is the receiver of a method call. obj.someMethod via the implicit parameter whose name is this  line A .  It is passed to the function stored in  30.4.3 Methods and .call   Recall that methods are function objects that have methods – for example, method .call  . In the previous example, there was this method invocation:  obj.someMethod 'a', 'b'  This invocation is equivalent to:  obj.someMethod.call obj, 'a', 'b' ;  As an aside, this means that there are actually two different dot operators:  1. One for accessing properties: obj.prop 2. One for making method calls: obj.prop    They are different in that  2  is not just  1  followed by the function call operator   . Instead,  2  additionally speciﬁes a value for this.  30.4.4 Methods and .bind   .bind   is another method of function objects. In the following code, we use .bind   turn method .says   into the stand-alone function func  :  const jane = {  first: 'Jane',   292  },  };  says text  {  return `${this.first} says “${text}”`;     A   30 Single objects  const func = jane.says.bind jane, 'hello' ; assert.equal func  , 'Jane says “hello”' ;  Setting this to jane via .bind   is crucial here. Otherwise, func   wouldn’t work prop- erly because this is used in line A. In the next section, we’ll explore why that is.  30.4.5 this pitfall: extracting methods We now know quite a bit about functions and methods and are ready to take a look at the biggest pitfall involving methods and this: function-calling a method extracted from an object can fail if we are not careful. In the following example, we fail when we extract method jane.says  , store it in the variable func, and function-call func  .  },  } ;  } ;  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', says text  {  return `${this.first} says “${text}”`;  }; const func = jane.says;    extract the method assert.throws      => func 'hello' ,     A  {  name: 'TypeError', message: "Cannot read property 'first' of undefined",  The function call in line A is equivalent to:  assert.throws      => jane.says.call undefined, 'hello' ,    `this` is undefined! {  name: 'TypeError', message: "Cannot read property 'first' of undefined",  So how do we ﬁx this? We need to use .bind   to extract method .says  :  const func2 = jane.says.bind jane ; assert.equal func2 'hello' , 'Jane says “hello”' ;  The .bind   ensures that this is always jane when we call func  . We can also use arrow functions to extract methods:   30.4 Methods and the special variable this  293  const func3 = text => jane.says text ; assert.equal func3 'hello' , 'Jane says “hello”' ;  30.4.5.1 Example: extracting a method The following is a simpliﬁed version of code that we may see in actual web development:  class ClickHandler {  constructor id, elem  {  this.id = id; elem.addEventListener 'click', this.handleClick ;     A   } handleClick event  {  alert 'Clicked ' + this.id ;  }  }  In line A, we don’t extract the method .handleClick   properly. Instead, we should do:  elem.addEventListener 'click', this.handleClick.bind this  ;  30.4.5.2 How to avoid the pitfall of extracting methods Alas, there is no simple way around the pitfall of extracting methods: Whenever we extract a method, we have to be careful and do it properly – for example, by binding this or by using an arrow function.  Exercise: Extracting a method  exercises single-objects method_extraction_exrc.mjs  30.4.6 this pitfall: accidentally shadowing this  Accidentally shadowing this is only an issue with ordinary functions  Arrow functions don’t shadow this.  Consider the following problem: when we are inside an ordinary function, we can’t ac- cess the this of the surrounding scope because the ordinary function has its own this. In other words, a variable in an inner scope hides a variable in an outer scope. That is called shadowing. The following code is an example:  const prefixer = { prefix: '==> ', prefixStringArray stringArray  {  return stringArray.map   function  x  {  return this.prefix + x;     A   } ;   294  },  }; assert.throws   30 Single objects     => prefixer.prefixStringArray ['a', 'b'] ,  ^TypeError: Cannot read property 'prefix' of undefined$  ;  In line A, we want to access the this of .prefixStringArray  . But we can’t since the surrounding ordinary function has its own this that shadows  blocks access to  the this of the method. The value of the former this is undefined due to the callback being function-called. That explains the error message. The simplest way to ﬁx this problem is via an arrow function, which doesn’t have its own this and therefore doesn’t shadow anything:  We can also store this in a different variable  line A , so that it doesn’t get shadowed:  const prefixer = { prefix: '==> ', prefixStringArray stringArray  {  return stringArray.map    x  => {  return this.prefix + x;  } ;  },  }; assert.deepEqual   prefixer.prefixStringArray ['a', 'b'] , ['==> a', '==> b'] ;  prefixStringArray stringArray  {  const that = this;     A  return stringArray.map   function  x  {  return that.prefix + x;  } ;  },  prefixStringArray stringArray  {  return stringArray.map   function  x  {  return this.prefix + x;  }.bind this  ;     A   },  prefixStringArray stringArray  {  return stringArray.map   function  x  {  Another option is to specify a ﬁxed this for the callback via .bind    line A :  Lastly, .map   lets us specify a value for this  line A  that it uses when invoking the callback:   30.5 Optional chaining for property accesses and method calls [ES2020]  advanced   295  return this.prefix + x;  }, this ;     A   },  30.4.6.1 Avoiding the pitfall of accidentally shadowing this If you follow the advice in §27.3.4 “Recommendation: prefer specialized functions over ordinary functions”, you can avoid the pitfall of accidentally shadowing this. This is a summary:    Use arrow functions as anonymous inline functions. They don’t have this as an  implicit parameter and don’t shadow it.    For named stand-alone function declarations you can either use arrow functions or function declarations. If you do the latter, make sure this isn’t mentioned in their bodies.  30.4.7 The value of this in various contexts  advanced  What is the value of this in various contexts? Inside a callable entity, the value of this depends on how the callable entity is invoked and what kind of callable entity it is:    Function call:  – Ordinary functions: this === undefined  in strict mode  – Arrow functions: this is same as in surrounding scope  lexical this     Method call: this is receiver of call   new: this refers to newly created instance  We can also access this in all common top-level scopes:      element: this === globalThis   ECMAScript modules: this === undefined   CommonJS modules: this === module.exports  Tip: pretend that this doesn’t exist in top-level scopes  I like to do that because top-level this is confusing and rarely useful.  30.5 Optional chaining for property accesses and method  calls [ES2020]  advanced   The following kinds of optional chaining operations exist: obj?.prop    optional static property access obj?.[«expr»]    optional dynamic property access func?. «arg0», «arg1»     optional function or method call  The rough idea is:   296  30 Single objects    If the value before the question mark is neither undefined nor null, then perform  the operation after the question mark.    Otherwise, return undefined.  30.5.1 Example: optional static property access Consider the following data:  const persons = [  surname: 'Zoe', address: { street: {  name: 'Sesame Street', number: '123',  },  },  surname: 'Mariner',  surname: 'Carmen', address: { },  {  }, {  }, {  },  ];   ;   ;  We can use optional chaining to safely extract street names:  const streetNames = persons.map  p => p.address?.street?.name ;  assert.deepEqual   streetNames, ['Sesame Street', undefined, undefined]  30.5.1.1 Handling defaults via nullish coalescing The nullish coalescing operator allows us to use the default value ' no street ' instead of undefined:  const streetNames = persons.map   p => p.address?.street?.name ?? ' no name ' ;  assert.deepEqual   streetNames, ['Sesame Street', ' no name ', ' no name ']   30.5 Optional chaining for property accesses and method calls [ES2020]  advanced   297  30.5.2 The operators in more detail  advanced  30.5.2.1 Optional static property access The following two expressions are equivalent:  o?.prop  o !== undefined && o !== null  ? o.prop : undefined  Examples:  assert.equal undefined?.prop, undefined ; assert.equal null?.prop, undefined ; 1 ; assert.equal {prop:1}?.prop,  30.5.2.2 Optional dynamic property access The following two expressions are equivalent:  o?.[«expr»]  o !== undefined && o !== null  ? o[«expr»] : undefined  Examples:  const key = 'prop'; assert.equal undefined?.[key], undefined ; assert.equal null?.[key], undefined ; assert.equal {prop:1}?.[key], 1 ;  30.5.2.3 Optional function or method call The following two expressions are equivalent:  f?. arg0, arg1   f !== undefined && f !== null  ? f arg0, arg1  : undefined  Examples:  assert.equal undefined?. 123 , undefined ; assert.equal null?. 123 , undefined ; assert.equal String?. 123 , '123' ;  Note that this operator produces an error if its left-hand side is not callable:  assert.throws      => true?. 123 , TypeError ;  Why? The idea is that the operator only tolerates deliberate omissions. An uncallable value  other than undefined and null  is probably an error and should be reported, rather than worked around.  30.5.3 Short-circuiting  advanced  In a chain of property accesses and function method invocations, evaluation stops once the ﬁrst optional operator encounters undefined or null at its left-hand side:   30 Single objects  298  }  function isInvoked obj  {  let invoked = false; obj?.a.b.m invoked = true ; return invoked;  assert.equal   isInvoked {a: {b: {m   {}}}} , true ;     The left-hand side of ?. is undefined    and the assignment is not executed assert.equal   isInvoked undefined , false ;  This behavior differs from a normal operator function where JavaScript always evalu- ates all operands arguments before evaluating the operator function. It is called short- circuiting. Other short-circuiting operators:    a && b   a  b   c ? t : e  30.5.4 Frequently asked questions 30.5.4.1 Why are there dots in o?.[x] and f?.  ? The syntaxes of the following two optional operator are not ideal:  obj?.[«expr»] func?. «arg0», «arg1»     better: func? «arg0», «arg1»      better: obj?[«expr»]  Alas, the less elegant syntax is necessary, because distinguishing the ideal syntax  ﬁrst expression  from the conditional operator  second expression  is too complicated:  obj?['a', 'b', 'c'].map x => x+x  obj ? ['a', 'b', 'c'].map x => x+x  : []  30.5.4.2 Why does null?.prop evaluate to undefined and not null? The operator ?. is mainly about its right-hand side: Does property .prop exist? If not, stop early. Therefore, keeping information about its left-hand side is rarely useful. How- ever, only having a single “early termination” value does simplify things.  30.6 Objects as dictionaries  advanced  Objects work best as records. But before ES6, JavaScript did not have a data structure for dictionaries  ES6 brought Maps . Therefore, objects had to be used as dictionaries, which imposed a signﬁcant constraint: keys had to be strings  symbols were also introduced with ES6 .   30.6 Objects as dictionaries  advanced   299  We ﬁrst look at features of objects that are related to dictionaries but also useful for objects- as-records. This section concludes with tips for actually using objects as dictionaries  spoiler: use Maps if you can .  30.6.1 Arbitrary ﬁxed strings as property keys So far, we have always used objects as records. Property keys were ﬁxed tokens that had to be valid identiﬁers and internally became strings:  const obj = {  mustBeAnIdentifier: 123,  };     Get property assert.equal obj.mustBeAnIdentifier, 123 ;     Set property obj.mustBeAnIdentifier = 'abc'; assert.equal obj.mustBeAnIdentifier, 'abc' ;  As a next step, we’ll go beyond this limitation for property keys: In this section, we’ll use arbitrary ﬁxed strings as keys. In the next subsection, we’ll dynamically compute keys. Two techniques allow us to use arbitrary strings as property keys. First, when creating property keys via object literals, we can quote property keys  with single or double quotes :  const obj = {  'Can be any string!': 123,  };  Second, when getting or setting properties, we can use square brackets with strings in- side them:     Get property assert.equal obj['Can be any string!'], 123 ;     Set property obj['Can be any string!'] = 'abc'; assert.equal obj['Can be any string!'], 'abc' ;  We can also use these techniques for methods:  const obj = {  'A nice method'   {  return 'Yes!';  },  };  assert.equal obj['A nice method']  , 'Yes!' ;   300  30 Single objects  30.6.2 Computed property keys So far, property keys were always ﬁxed strings inside object literals. In this section we learn how to dynamically compute property keys. That enables us to use either arbitrary strings or symbols. The syntax of dynamically computed property keys in object literals is inspired by dy- namically accessing properties. That is, we can use square brackets to wrap expressions:  const obj = {  ['Hello world!']: true, ['f'+'o'+'o']: 123, [Symbol.toStringTag]: 'Goodbye',     A   };  assert.equal obj['Hello world!'], true ; assert.equal obj.foo, 123 ; assert.equal obj[Symbol.toStringTag], 'Goodbye' ;  The main use case for computed keys is having symbols as property keys  line A . Note that the square brackets operator for getting and setting properties works with arbitrary expressions:  assert.equal obj['f'+'o'+'o'], 123 ; assert.equal obj['==> foo'.slice -3 ], 123 ;  Methods can have computed property keys, too:  const methodKey = Symbol  ; const obj = {  [methodKey]   { return 'Yes!';  },  };  assert.equal obj[methodKey]  , 'Yes!' ;  For the remainder of this chapter, we’ll mostly use ﬁxed property keys again  because they are syntactically more convenient . But all features are also available for arbitrary strings and symbols.  Exercise: Non-destructively updating a property via spreading  computed  key  exercises single-objects update_property_test.mjs  30.6.3 The in operator: is there a property with a given key? The in operator checks if an object has a property with a given key:   30.6 Objects as dictionaries  advanced   301  const obj = { foo: 'abc', bar: false,  };  assert.equal 'foo' in obj, true ; assert.equal 'unknownKey' in obj, false ;  30.6.3.1 Checking if a property exists via truthiness We can also use a truthiness check to determine if a property exists:  assert.equal   obj.foo ? 'exists' : 'does not exist', 'exists' ; assert.equal   obj.unknownKey ? 'exists' : 'does not exist', 'does not exist' ;  The previous checks work because obj.foo is truthy and because reading a missing prop- erty returns undefined  which is falsy . There is, however, one important caveat: truthiness checks fail if the property exists, but has a falsy value  undefined, null, false, 0, "", etc. :  assert.equal   obj.bar ? 'exists' : 'does not exist', 'does not exist' ;    should be: 'exists'  30.6.4 Deleting properties We can delete properties via the delete operator:  const obj = {  foo: 123,  delete obj.foo;  }; assert.deepEqual Object.keys obj , ['foo'] ;  assert.deepEqual Object.keys obj , [] ;  30.6.5 Listing property keys  Table 30.1: Standard library methods for listing own  non-inherited  property keys. All of them return Arrays with strings and or symbols.  Object.keys   Object.getOwnPropertyNames    enumerable ✔ ✔  non-e.  ✔  string ✔ ✔  symbol   302  30 Single objects  Object.getOwnPropertySymbols   Reflect.ownKeys    enumerable ✔ ✔  non-e. ✔ ✔  string  ✔  symbol ✔ ✔  Each of the methods in tbl. 30.1 returns an Array with the own property keys of the parameter. In the names of the methods, we can see that the following distinction is made:    A property key can be either a string or a symbol.   A property name is a property key whose value is a string.   A property symbol is a property key whose value is a symbol.  The next section describes the term enumerable and demonstrates each of the methods.  30.6.5.1 Enumerability Enumerability is an attribute of a property. Non-enumerable properties are ignored by some operations – for example, by Object.keys    see tbl. 30.1  and by spread properties. By default, most properties are enumerable. The next example shows how to change that. It also demonstrates the various ways of listing property keys.  const enumerableSymbolKey = Symbol 'enumerableSymbolKey' ; const nonEnumSymbolKey = Symbol 'nonEnumSymbolKey' ;     We create enumerable properties via an object literal const obj = {     For non-enumerable properties, we need a more powerful tool Object.defineProperties obj, {  enumerableStringKey: 1, [enumerableSymbolKey]: 2,  }  nonEnumStringKey: {  value: 3, enumerable: false,  }, [nonEnumSymbolKey]: {  value: 4, enumerable: false,  }, } ;  assert.deepEqual   Object.keys obj , [ 'enumerableStringKey' ] ;  assert.deepEqual   Object.getOwnPropertyNames obj , [ 'enumerableStringKey', 'nonEnumStringKey' ] ;   30.6 Objects as dictionaries  advanced   303  assert.deepEqual   Object.getOwnPropertySymbols obj , [ enumerableSymbolKey, nonEnumSymbolKey ] ;  assert.deepEqual   Reflect.ownKeys obj , [  'enumerableStringKey', 'nonEnumStringKey', enumerableSymbolKey, nonEnumSymbolKey,  ] ;  Object.defineProperties   is explained later in this chapter.  30.6.6 Listing property values via Object.values   Object.values   lists the values of all enumerable properties of an object:  const obj = {foo: 1, bar: 2}; assert.deepEqual   Object.values obj , [1, 2] ;  30.6.7 Listing property entries via Object.entries   [ES2017] Object.entries   lists key-value pairs of enumerable properties. Each pair is encoded as a two-element Array:  const obj = {foo: 1, bar: 2}; assert.deepEqual   Object.entries obj , [  ['foo', 1], ['bar', 2],  ] ;  Exercise: Object.entries    exercises single-objects find_key_test.mjs  30.6.8 Properties are listed deterministically Own  non-inherited  properties of objects are always listed in the following order:  1. Properties with string keys that contain integer indices  that includes Array in-  dices : In ascending numeric order  2. Remaining properties with string keys: In the order in which they were added  3. Properties with symbol keys:  In the order in which they were added   304  30 Single objects  The following example demonstrates how property keys are sorted according to these rules:  > Object.keys {b:0,a:0, 10:0,2:0}  [ '2', '10', 'b', 'a' ]  The order of properties  The ECMAScript speciﬁcation describes in more detail how properties are ordered.  30.6.9 Assembling objects via Object.fromEntries   [ES2019] Given an iterable over [key, value] pairs, Object.fromEntries   creates an object:  assert.deepEqual   Object.fromEntries [['foo',1], ['bar',2]] , {  foo: 1, bar: 2,  }   ;  Object.fromEntries   does the opposite of Object.entries  . To demonstrate both, we’ll use them to implement two tool functions from the library Underscore in the next subsubsections.  30.6.9.1 Example: pick object, ...keys  pick returns a copy of object that only has those properties whose keys are mentioned as arguments:  const address = {  street: 'Evergreen Terrace', number: '742', city: 'Springfield', state: 'NT', zip: '49007',  }; assert.deepEqual   pick address, 'street', 'number' , {  street: 'Evergreen Terrace', number: '742',  }   ;  We can implement pick   as follows:  function pick object, ...keys  {  const filteredEntries = Object.entries object    30.6 Objects as dictionaries  advanced   305  .filter  [key, _value]  => keys.includes key  ;  return Object.fromEntries filteredEntries ;  30.6.9.2 Example: invert object  invert returns a copy of object where the keys and values of all properties are swapped:  }   ;  }  assert.deepEqual   invert {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3} , {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}  We can implement invert   like this:  function invert object  {  const reversedEntries = Object.entries object   .map  [key, value]  => [value, key] ;  return Object.fromEntries reversedEntries ;  30.6.9.3 A simple implementation of Object.fromEntries   The following function is a simpliﬁed version of Object.fromEntries  :  function fromEntries iterable  {  const result = {}; for  const [key, value] of iterable  {  let coercedKey; if  typeof key === 'string'  typeof key === 'symbol'  {  coercedKey = key;  } else {  coercedKey = String key ;  } result[coercedKey] = value;  } return result;  }  Exercise: Object.entries   and Object.fromEntries    exercises single-objects omit_properties_test.mjs  30.6.10 The pitfalls of using an object as a dictionary If we use plain objects  created via object literals  as dictionaries, we have to look out for two pitfalls. The ﬁrst pitfall is that the in operator also ﬁnds inherited properties:   306  30 Single objects  const dict = {}; assert.equal 'toString' in dict, true ;  We want dict to be treated as empty, but the in operator detects the properties it inherits from its prototype, Object.prototype. The second pitfall is that we can’t use the property key __proto__ because it has special powers  it sets the prototype of the object :  const dict = {};  dict['__proto__'] = 123;    No property was added to dict: assert.deepEqual Object.keys dict , [] ;  30.6.10.1 Safely using objects as dictionaries So how do you avoid the two pitfalls?    Whenever you can, use Maps. They are the best solution for dictionaries.   If you can’t, use a library for objects-as-dictionaries that does everything safely.   If you can’t, use an object without a prototype.  The following code demonstrates using objects without prototypes as dictionaries:  const dict = Object.create null ;    no prototype  assert.equal 'toString' in dict, false ;     A   dict['__proto__'] = 123; assert.deepEqual Object.keys dict , ['__proto__'] ;  We avoided both pitfalls:    First, a property without a prototype does not inherit any properties  line A .   Second, in modern JavaScript, __proto__ is implemented via Object.prototype. That means that it is switched off if Object.prototype is not in the prototype chain.  Exercise: Using an object as a dictionary  exercises single-objects simple_dict_test.mjs  30.7 Standard methods  advanced  Object.prototype deﬁnes several standard methods that can be overridden to conﬁgure how an object is treated by the language. Two important ones are:    .toString     .valueOf     30.8 Advanced topics  307  30.7.1 .toString   .toString   determines how objects are converted to strings:  > String {toString   { return 'Hello!' }}  'Hello!' > String {}  '[object Object]'  30.7.2 .valueOf   .valueOf   determines how objects are converted to numbers:  > Number {valueOf   { return 123 }}  123 > Number {}  NaN  30.8 Advanced topics The following subsections give brief overviews of a few advanced topics.  30.8.1 Object.assign   [ES6] Object.assign   is a tool method:  Object.assign target, source_1, source_2, ···   This expression assigns all properties of source_1 to target, then all properties of source_2, etc. At the end, it returns target – for example:  const target = { foo: 1 };  const result = Object.assign   target, {bar: 2}, {baz: 3, bar: 4} ;  assert.deepEqual   result, { foo: 1, bar: 4, baz: 3 } ;     target was modified and returned: assert.equal result, target ;  The use cases for Object.assign   are similar to those for spread properties. In a way, it spreads destructively.  30.8.2 Freezing objects [ES5] Object.freeze obj  makes obj completely immutable: We can’t change properties, add properties, or change its prototype – for example:   308  30 Single objects  const frozen = Object.freeze { x: 2, y: 5 } ; assert.throws      => { frozen.x = 7 }, {  name: 'TypeError', message:  ^Cannot assign to read only property 'x' ,  } ;  There is one caveat: Object.freeze obj  freezes shallowly. That is, only the properties of obj are frozen but not objects stored in properties.  More information  For more information on freezing and other ways of locking down objects, see Deep JavaScript.  30.8.3 Property attributes and property descriptors [ES5] Just as objects are composed of properties, properties are composed of attributes. The value of a property is only one of several attributes. Others include:   writable: Is it possible to change the value of the property?   enumerable: Is the property considered by Object.keys  , spreading, etc.?  When we are using one of the operations for handling property attributes, attributes are speciﬁed via property descriptors: objects where each property represents one attribute. For example, this is how we read the attributes of a property obj.foo:  const obj = { foo: 123 }; assert.deepEqual   Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor obj, 'foo' , {  value: 123, writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: true,  } ;  const obj = {  foo: 1, bar: 2,  };  And this is how we set the attributes of a property obj.bar:  assert.deepEqual Object.keys obj , ['foo', 'bar'] ;     Hide property `bar` from Object.keys   Object.defineProperty obj, 'bar', {  enumerable: false,   309  assert.deepEqual Object.keys obj , ['foo'] ;    Enumerability is covered in greater detail earlier in this chapter.

This chapter covers steps 2–4, the previous chapter covers step 1. The steps are  ﬁg. 31.1 :  311   312  31 Prototype chains and classes  1. Single objects  previous chapter : How do objects, JavaScript’s basic OOP build-  ing blocks, work in isolation?  2. Prototype chains  this chapter : Each object has a chain of zero or more prototype  objects. Prototypes are JavaScript’s core inheritance mechanism.  3. Classes  this chapter : JavaScript’s classes are factories for objects. The relationship  between a class and its instances is based on prototypal inheritance.  4. Subclassing  this chapter : The relationship between a subclass and its superclass  is also based on prototypal inheritance.  Figure 31.1: This book introduces object-oriented programming in JavaScript in four steps.  31.1 Prototype chains Prototypes are JavaScript’s only inheritance mechanism: each object has a prototype that is either null or an object. In the latter case, the object inherits all of the prototype’s properties. In an object literal, you can set the prototype via the special property __proto__:  const proto = {  protoProp: 'a',  }; const obj = {  __proto__: proto, objProp: 'b',  };     obj inherits .protoProp: assert.equal obj.protoProp, 'a' ; assert.equal 'protoProp' in obj, true ;  Given that a prototype object can have a prototype itself, we get a chain of objects – the so-called prototype chain. That means that inheritance gives us the impression that we are dealing with single objects, but we are actually dealing with chains of objects. Fig. 31.2 shows what the prototype chain of obj looks like. Non-inherited properties are called own properties. obj has one own property, .objProp.  mthd  ƒ  4  MyClass  data mthd  mthd data  ƒ 4  __proto__ data  1. Single objects 2. Prototype chains  3.

JavaScript’s operations: all properties vs. own properties  31.1.1 Some operations consider all properties  own and inherited  – for example, getting prop- erties:  > const obj = { foo: 1 }; > typeof obj.foo    own 'number' > typeof obj.toString    inherited 'function'  > Object.keys obj  [ 'foo' ]  Other operations only consider own properties – for example, Object.keys  :  Read on for another operation that also only considers own properties: setting proper- ties.  31.1.2 Pitfall: only the ﬁrst member of a prototype chain is mutated One aspect of prototype chains that may be counter-intuitive is that setting any property via an object – even an inherited one – only changes that very object – never one of the prototypes. Consider the following object obj:  const proto = {  protoProp: 'a',  }; const obj = {  __proto__: proto, objProp: 'b',  };  . . .  'a'  'b'  proto __proto__ protoProp  obj __proto__ objProp   314  31 Prototype chains and classes  In the next code snippet, we set the inherited property obj.protoProp  line A . That “changes” it by creating an own property: When reading obj.protoProp, the own prop- erty is found ﬁrst and its value overrides the value of the inherited property.     In the beginning, obj has one own property assert.deepEqual Object.keys obj , ['objProp'] ;  obj.protoProp = 'x';     A      We created a new own property: assert.deepEqual Object.keys obj , ['objProp', 'protoProp'] ;     The inherited property itself is unchanged: assert.equal proto.protoProp, 'a' ;     The own property overrides the inherited property: assert.equal obj.protoProp, 'x' ;  The prototype chain of obj is depicted in ﬁg. 31.3.  Figure 31.3: The own property .protoProp of obj overrides the property inherited from proto.  31.1.3 Tips for working with prototypes  advanced  31.1.3.1 Best practice: avoid __proto__, except in object literals I recommend to avoid the pseudo-property __proto__: As we will see later, not all ob- jects have it. However, __proto__ in object literals is different. There, it is a built-in feature and always available. The recommended ways of getting and setting prototypes are:    The best way to get a prototype is via the following method:  . . .  'a'  'b' 'x'  proto __proto__ protoProp  obj __proto__ objProp protoProp   31.1 Prototype chains  315  Object.getPrototypeOf obj: Object  : Object    The best way to set a prototype is when creating an object – via __proto__ in an  object literal or via:  Object.create proto: Object  : Object  If you have to, you can use Object.setPrototypeOf   to change the prototype of an existing object. But that may affect performance negatively.  This is how these features are used:  const proto1 = {}; const proto2 = {};  const obj = Object.create proto1 ; assert.equal Object.getPrototypeOf obj , proto1 ;  Object.setPrototypeOf obj, proto2 ; assert.equal Object.getPrototypeOf obj , proto2 ;  31.1.3.2 Check: is an object a prototype of another one? So far, “p is a prototype of o” always meant “p is a direct prototype of o”. But it can also be used more loosely and mean that p is in the prototype chain of o. That looser relationship can be checked via:  p.isPrototypeOf o   For example:  const a = {}; const b = {__proto__: a}; const c = {__proto__: b};  assert.equal a.isPrototypeOf b , true ; assert.equal a.isPrototypeOf c , true ;  assert.equal a.isPrototypeOf a , false ; assert.equal c.isPrototypeOf a , false ;  31.1.4 Sharing data via prototypes Consider the following code:  return 'Person named '+this.name;  const jane = { name: 'Jane', describe   {  },  }; const tarzan = { name: 'Tarzan',   316  },  };  describe   {  return 'Person named '+this.name;  31 Prototype chains and classes  assert.equal jane.describe  , 'Person named Jane' ; assert.equal tarzan.describe  , 'Person named Tarzan' ;  We have two objects that are very similar. Both have two properties whose names are .name and .describe. Additionally, method .describe   is the same. How can we avoid duplicating that method? We can move it to an object PersonProto and make that object a prototype of both jane and tarzan:  return 'Person named ' + this.name;  const PersonProto = {  describe   {  },  }; const jane = {  __proto__: PersonProto, name: 'Jane',  }; const tarzan = {  __proto__: PersonProto, name: 'Tarzan',  };  The name of the prototype reﬂects that both jane and tarzan are persons.  Figure 31.4: Objects jane and tarzan share method .describe  , via their common pro- totype PersonProto.  Fig. 31.4 illustrates how the three objects are connected: The objects at the bottom now contain the properties that are speciﬁc to jane and tarzan. The object at the top contains the properties that are shared between them. When you make the method call jane.describe  , this points to the receiver of that method call, jane  in the bottom-left corner of the diagram . That’s why the method still works. tarzan.describe   works similarly.  PersonProto describe  function   {···}  jane __proto__ name  'Jane'  tarzan __proto__ name  'Tarzan'   31.2 Classes  317  assert.equal jane.describe  , 'Person named Jane' ; assert.equal tarzan.describe  , 'Person named Tarzan' ;  31.2 Classes We are now ready to take on classes, which are basically a compact syntax for setting up prototype chains. Under the hood, JavaScript’s classes are unconventional. But that is something you rarely see when working with them. They should normally feel familiar to people who have used other object-oriented programming languages.  31.2.1 A class for persons We have previously worked with jane and tarzan, single objects representing persons. Let’s use a class declaration to implement a factory for person objects:  class Person {  constructor name  { this.name = name;  } describe   {  }  }  return 'Person named '+this.name;  jane and tarzan can now be created via new Person  :  const jane = new Person 'Jane' ; assert.equal jane.name, 'Jane' ; assert.equal jane.describe  , 'Person named Jane' ;  const tarzan = new Person 'Tarzan' ; assert.equal tarzan.name, 'Tarzan' ; assert.equal tarzan.describe  , 'Person named Tarzan' ;  Class Person has two methods:    The normal method .describe     The special method .constructor   which is called directly after a new instance has been created and initializes that instance. It receives the arguments that are passed to the new operator  after the class name . If you don’t need any arguments to set up a new instance, you can omit the constructor.  31.2.1.1 Class expressions There are two kinds of class deﬁnitions  ways of deﬁning classes :    Class declarations, which we have seen in the previous section.   Class expressions, which we’ll see next.  Class expressions can be anonymous and named:   318  31 Prototype chains and classes     Anonymous class expression const Person = class { ··· };     Named class expression const Person = class MyClass { ··· };  The name of a named class expression works similarly to the name of a named function expression. This was a ﬁrst look at classes. We’ll explore more features soon, but ﬁrst we need to learn the internals of classes.  31.2.2 Classes under the hood There is a lot going on under the hood of classes. Let’s look at the diagram for jane  ﬁg. 31.5 .  Figure 31.5: The class Person has the property .prototype that points to an object that is the prototype of all instances of Person. jane is one such instance.  The main purpose of class Person is to set up the prototype chain on the right  jane, followed by Person.prototype . It is interesting to note that both constructs inside class Person  .constructor and .describe    created properties for Person.prototype, not for Person. The reason for this slightly odd approach is backward compatibility: prior to classes, constructor functions  ordinary functions, invoked via the new operator  were often used as factories for objects. Classes are mostly better syntax for constructor functions and therefore remain compatible with old code. That explains why classes are functions:  > typeof Person 'function'  In this book, I use the terms constructor  function  and class interchangeably. It is easy to confuse .__proto__ and .prototype. Hopefully, ﬁg. 31.5 makes it clear how they differ:  Person prototype  Person.prototype constructor describe  function   {...}  jane __proto__ name  'Jane'   31.2 Classes  319    .__proto__ is a pseudo-property for accessing the prototype of an object.   .prototype is a normal property that is only special due to how the new operator uses it. The name is not ideal: Person.prototype does not point to the prototype of Person, it points to the prototype of all instances of Person.  31.2.2.1 Person.prototype.constructor  advanced  There is one detail in ﬁg. 31.5 that we haven’t looked at, yet: Person.prototype.constructor points back to Person:  > Person.prototype.constructor === Person true  This setup also exists due to backward compatibility. But it has two additional beneﬁts. First, each instance of a class inherits property .constructor. Therefore, given an in- stance, you can make “similar” objects using it:  const jane = new Person 'Jane' ;  const cheeta = new jane.constructor 'Cheeta' ;    cheeta is also an instance of Person     the instanceof operator is explained later  assert.equal cheeta instanceof Person, true ;  Second, you can get the name of the class that created a given instance:  const tarzan = new Person 'Tarzan' ;  assert.equal tarzan.constructor.name, 'Person' ;  31.2.3 Class deﬁnitions: prototype properties All constructs in the body of the following class declaration create properties of Foo.prototype. class Foo {  constructor prop  { this.prop = prop;  } protoMethod   {  return 'protoMethod';  } get protoGetter   {  return 'protoGetter';  Let’s examine them in order:  }  }  stance.    .constructor   is called after creating a new instance of Foo to set up that in-    .protoMethod   is a normal method. It is stored in Foo.prototype.   320  31 Prototype chains and classes    .protoGetter is a getter that is stored in Foo.prototype.  The following interaction uses class Foo:  > const foo = new Foo 123 ; > foo.prop 123  > foo.protoMethod   'protoMethod' > foo.protoGetter 'protoGetter'  31.2.4 Class deﬁnitions: static properties All constructs in the body of the following class declaration create so-called static prop- erties – properties of Bar itself.  class Bar {  static staticMethod   { return 'staticMethod';  } static get staticGetter   {  return 'staticGetter';  }  }  > Bar.staticMethod   'staticMethod' > Bar.staticGetter 'staticGetter'  The static method and the static getter are used as follows:  31.2.5 The instanceof operator The instanceof operator tells you if a value is an instance of a given class:  > new Person 'Jane'  instanceof Person true >  {}  instanceof Person false >  {}  instanceof Object true > [] instanceof Array true  We’ll explore the instanceof operator in more detail later, after we have looked at sub- classing.   31.3 Private data for classes  321  31.2.6 Why I recommend classes I recommend using classes for the following reasons:    Classes are a common standard for object creation and inheritance that is now widely supported across frameworks  React, Angular, Ember, etc. . This is an im- provement to how things were before, when almost every framework had its own inheritance library.    They help tools such as IDEs and type checkers with their work and enable new  features there.    If you come from another language to JavaScript and are used to classes, then you  can get started more quickly.    JavaScript engines optimize them. That is, code that uses classes is almost always  faster than code that uses a custom inheritance library.    You can subclass built-in constructor functions such as Error.  That doesn’t mean that classes are perfect:    There is a risk of overdoing inheritance.   There is a risk of putting too much functionality in classes  when some of it is often  better put in functions .    How they work superﬁcially and under the hood is quite different. In other words,  there is a disconnect between syntax and semantics. Two examples are:  – A method deﬁnition inside a class C creates a method in the object  C.prototype.  – Classes are functions.  The motivation for the disconnect is backward compatibility. Thankfully, the dis- connect causes few problems in practice; you are usually OK if you go along with what classes pretend to be.  Exercise: Writing a class  exercises proto-chains-classes point_class_test.mjs  31.3 Private data for classes This section describes techniques for hiding some of the data of an object from the outside. We discuss them in the context of classes, but they also work for objects created directly, e.g., via object literals.  31.3.1 Private data: naming convention The ﬁrst technique makes a property private by preﬁxing its name with an underscore. This doesn’t protect the property in any way; it merely signals to the outside: “You don’t need to know about this property.”   322  31 Prototype chains and classes  In the following code, the properties ._counter and ._action are private.  class Countdown {  constructor counter, action  {  this._counter = counter; this._action = action;  this._counter--; if  this._counter === 0  {  this._action  ;  } dec   {  }  }  }     The two properties aren’t really private: assert.deepEqual   Object.keys new Countdown   , ['_counter', '_action'] ;  With this technique, you don’t get any protection and private names can clash. On the plus side, it is easy to use.  31.3.2 Private data: WeakMaps Another technique is to use WeakMaps. How exactly that works is explained in the chapter on WeakMaps. This is a preview: const _counter = new WeakMap  ; const _action = new WeakMap  ;  class Countdown {  constructor counter, action  { _counter.set this, counter ; _action.set this, action ;  } dec   {  let counter = _counter.get this ; counter--; _counter.set this, counter ; if  counter === 0  {  _action.get this   ;  }  }  }     The two pseudo-properties are truly private: assert.deepEqual   Object.keys new Countdown   , [] ;   31.4 Subclassing  323  This technique offers you considerable protection from outside access and there can’t be any name clashes. But it is also more complicated to use.  31.3.3 More techniques for private data This book explains the most important techniques for private data in classes. There will also probably soon be built-in support for it. Consult the ECMAScript proposal “Class Public Instance Fields & Private Instance Fields” for details. A few additional techniques are explained in Exploring ES6.  31.4 Subclassing Classes can also subclass  “extend”  existing classes. As an example, the following class Employee subclasses Person:  class Person {  constructor name  { this.name = name;  } describe   {  return `Person named ${this.name}`;  } static logNames persons  {  for  const person of persons  {  console.log person.name ;  }  }  }  }  }  class Employee extends Person {  constructor name, title  {  super name ; this.title = title;  } describe   {  return super.describe   +  `  ${this.title} `;  const jane = new Employee 'Jane', 'CTO' ; assert.equal   jane.describe  , 'Person named Jane  CTO ' ;  Two comments:    Inside a .constructor   method, you must call the super-constructor via super     324  31 Prototype chains and classes  before you can access this. That’s because this doesn’t exist before the super- constructor is called  this phenomenon is speciﬁc to classes .    Static methods are also inherited. For example, Employee inherits the static method  .logNames  :  > 'logNames' in Employee true  Exercise: Subclassing  exercises proto-chains-classes color_point_class_test.mjs  31.4.1 Subclasses under the hood  advanced   Figure 31.6: These are the objects that make up class Person and its subclass, Employee. The left column is about classes. The right column is about the Employee instance jane and its prototype chain.  The classes Person and Employee from the previous section are made up of several objects  ﬁg. 31.6 . One key insight for understanding how these objects are related is that there are two prototype chains:    The instance prototype chain, on the right.   The class prototype chain, on the left.  31.4.1.1 The instance prototype chain  right column  The instance prototype chain starts with jane and continues with Employee.prototype and Person.prototype. In principle, the prototype chain ends at this point, but we get one more object: Object.prototype. This prototype provides services to virtually all objects, which is why it is included here, too:  Function.prototype  __proto__  Person  prototype  __proto__  Object.prototype  __proto__  Person.prototype  __proto__  Employee  prototype  Employee.prototype  __proto__  jane   31.4 Subclassing  325  > Object.getPrototypeOf Person.prototype  === Object.prototype true  31.4.1.2 The class prototype chain  left column  In the class prototype chain, Employee comes ﬁrst, Person next. Afterward, the chain continues with Function.prototype, which is only there because Person is a function and functions need the services of Function.prototype.  > Object.getPrototypeOf Person  === Function.prototype true  31.4.2 instanceof in more detail  advanced  We have not yet seen how instanceof really works. Given the expression:  x instanceof C  How does instanceof determine if x is an instance of C  or a subclass of C ? It does so by checking if C.prototype is in the prototype chain of x. That is, the following expression is equivalent:  C.prototype.isPrototypeOf x   If we go back to ﬁg. 31.6, we can conﬁrm that the prototype chain does lead us to the following correct answers:  31.4.3 Prototype chains of built-in objects  advanced  Next, we’ll use our knowledge of subclassing to understand the prototype chains of a few built-in objects. The following tool function p   helps us with our explorations.  const p = Object.getPrototypeOf.bind Object ;  We extracted method .getPrototypeOf   of Object and assigned it to p.  > jane instanceof Employee true > jane instanceof Person true > jane instanceof Object true  31.4.3.1 The prototype chain of {} Let’s start by examining plain objects: > p {}  === Object.prototype true > p p {}   === null true  Fig. 31.7 shows a diagram for this prototype chain. We can see that {} really is an instance of Object – Object.prototype is in its prototype chain.   326  31 Prototype chains and classes  Figure 31.7: The prototype chain of an object created via an object literal starts with that object, continues with Object.prototype, and ends with null.  31.4.3.2 The prototype chain of [] What does the prototype chain of an Array look like?  > p []  === Array.prototype true > p p []   === Object.prototype true > p p p []    === null true  Figure 31.8: The prototype chain of an Array has these members: the Array instance, Array.prototype, Object.prototype, null.  This prototype chain  visualized in ﬁg. 31.8  tells us that an Array object is an instance of Array, which is a subclass of Object.  null  __proto__  Object.prototype  __proto__  {}  null  __proto__  Object.prototype  __proto__  Array.prototype  __proto__  []   31.4 Subclassing  327  31.4.3.3 The prototype chain of function    {} Lastly, the prototype chain of an ordinary function tells us that all functions are objects:  > p function    {}  === Function.prototype true > p p function    {}   === Object.prototype true  31.4.3.4 Objects that aren’t instances of Object An object is only an instance of Object if Object.prototype is in its prototype chain. Most objects created via various literals are instances of Object:  >  {}  instanceof Object true >     => {}  instanceof Object true >  abc ug instanceof Object true  Objects that don’t have prototypes are not instances of Object:  >  { __proto__: null }  instanceof Object false  Object.prototype ends most prototype chains. Its prototype is null, which means it isn’t an instance of Object either:  > Object.prototype instanceof Object false  31.4.3.5 How exactly does the pseudo-property .__proto__ work? The pseudo-property .__proto__ is implemented by class Object via a getter and a setter. It could be implemented like this:  class Object {  get __proto__   {  return Object.getPrototypeOf this ;  } set __proto__ other  {  Object.setPrototypeOf this, other ;  }    ···  }  > '__proto__' in {} true > '__proto__' in { __proto__: null } false  That means that you can switch .__proto__ off by creating an object that doesn’t have Object.prototype in its prototype chain  see the previous section :   328  31 Prototype chains and classes  31.4.4 Dispatched vs. direct method calls  advanced  Let’s examine how method calls work with classes. We are revisiting jane from earlier:  class Person {  constructor name  { this.name = name;  } describe   {  return 'Person named '+this.name;  }  } const jane = new Person 'Jane' ;  Fig. 31.9 has a diagram with jane’s prototype chain.  Figure 31.9: The prototype chain of jane starts with jane and continues with Per- son.prototype.  Normal method calls are dispatched – the method call jane.describe   happens in two steps:    Dispatch: In the prototype chain of jane, ﬁnd the ﬁrst property whose key is 'de-  scribe' and retrieve its value.  const func = jane.describe;    Call: Call the value, while setting this to jane.  func.call jane ;  This way of dynamically looking for a method and invoking it is called dynamic dispatch. You can make the same method call directly, without dispatching:  Person.prototype.describe.call jane   This time, we directly point to the method via Person.prototype.describe and don’t search for it in the prototype chain. We also specify this differently via .call  .  . . .  Person.prototype __proto__ describe  function   {···}  jane __proto__ name  'Jane'   31.4 Subclassing  329  Note that this always points to the beginning of a prototype chain. That enables .de- scribe   to access .name.  31.4.4.1 Borrowing methods Direct method calls become useful when you are working with methods of Ob- ject.prototype. For example, Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty k  checks if this has a non-inherited property whose key is k:  > const obj = { foo: 123 }; > obj.hasOwnProperty 'foo'  true > obj.hasOwnProperty 'bar'  false  However, in the prototype chain of an object, there may be another property with the key 'hasOwnProperty' that overrides the method in Object.prototype. Then a dispatched method call doesn’t work:  > const obj = { hasOwnProperty: true }; > obj.hasOwnProperty 'bar'  TypeError: obj.hasOwnProperty is not a function  The workaround is to use a direct method call:  > Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call obj, 'bar'  false > Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call obj, 'hasOwnProperty'  true  This kind of direct method call is often abbreviated as follows:  >  {} .hasOwnProperty.call obj, 'bar'  false >  {} .hasOwnProperty.call obj, 'hasOwnProperty'  true  This pattern may seem inefﬁcient, but most engines optimize this pattern, so perfor- mance should not be an issue.  31.4.5 Mixin classes  advanced  JavaScript’s class system only supports single inheritance. That is, each class can have at most one superclass. One way around this limitation is via a technique called mixin classes  short: mixins . The idea is as follows: Let’s say we want a class C to inherit from two superclasses S1 and S2. That would be multiple inheritance, which JavaScript doesn’t support. Our workaround is to turn S1 and S2 into mixins, factories for subclasses:  const S1 =  Sup  => class extends Sup {  *···*  }; const S2 =  Sup  => class extends Sup {  *···*  };   330  31 Prototype chains and classes  Each of these two functions returns a class that extends a given superclass Sup. We create class C as follows:  class C extends S2 S1 Object   {   *···*   }  We now have a class C that extends a class S2 that extends a class S1 that extends Object  which most classes do implicitly .  31.4.5.1 Example: a mixin for brand management We implement a mixin Branded that has helper methods for setting and getting the brand of an object:  const Branded =  Sup  => class extends Sup {  setBrand brand  {  this._brand = brand; return this;  } getBrand   {  return this._brand;  }  };  }  }  We use this mixin to implement brand management for a class Car:  class Car extends Branded Object  {  constructor model  {  super  ; this._model = model;  } toString   {  return `${this.getBrand  } ${this._model}`;  The following code conﬁrms that the mixin worked: Car has method .setBrand   of Branded.  const modelT = new Car 'Model T' .setBrand 'Ford' ; assert.equal modelT.toString  , 'Ford Model T' ;  31.4.5.2 The beneﬁts of mixins Mixins free us from the constraints of single inheritance:    The same class can extend a single superclass and zero or more mixins.   The same mixin can be used by multiple classes.   31.5 FAQ: objects 31.5 FAQ: objects 31.5.1 Why do objects preserve the insertion order of properties? In principle, objects are unordered. The main reason for ordering properties is so that operations that list entries, keys, or values are deterministic. That helps, e.g., with testing.  331  Quiz See quiz app.   332  31 Prototype chains and classes   Part VII  Collections  333    Chapter 32  Synchronous iteration  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  32.4 Iteration in practice  32.1 What is synchronous iteration about? . 32.2 Core iteration constructs: iterables and iterators . 32.3 Iterating manually . . . . . . . .  . . 32.3.1 Iterating over an iterable via while . . . . . . . . . . 32.5 Quick reference: synchronous iteration . . . . . . . .  . . 32.4.1 Iterating over Arrays . 32.4.2 Iterating over Sets . . .  32.5.1 Iterable data sources 32.5.2 Iterating constructs .  . . . . . . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .  . 335 . 336 . 337 . 337 . 338 . 338 . 338 . 339 . 339 . 339  32.1 What is synchronous iteration about? Synchronous iteration is a protocol  interfaces plus rules for using them  that connects two groups of entities in JavaScript:    Data sources: On one hand, data comes in all shapes and sizes. In JavaScript’s standard library, you have the linear data structure Array, the ordered collection Set  elements are ordered by time of addition , the ordered dictionary Map  entries are ordered by time of addition , and more. In libraries, you may ﬁnd tree-shaped data structures and more.    Data consumers: On the other hand, you have a whole class of constructs and algorithms that only need to access their input sequentially: one value at a time, until all values were visited. Examples include the for-of loop and spreading into function calls  via ... .  The iteration protocol connects these two groups via the interface Iterable: data sources deliver their contents sequentially “through it”; data consumers get their input via it.  335   336  32 Synchronous iteration  Figure 32.1: Data consumers such as the for-of loop use the interface Iterable. Data sources such as Arrays implement that interface.  Fig. 32.1 illustrates how iteration works: data consumers use the interface Iterable; data sources implement it.  The JavaScript way of implementing interfaces  In JavaScript, an object implements an interface if it has all the methods that it de- scribes. The interfaces mentioned in this chapter only exist in the ECMAScript spec- iﬁcation.  Both sources and consumers of data proﬁt from this arrangement:    If you develop a new data structure, you only need to implement Iterable and a  raft of tools can immediately be applied to it.    If you write code that uses iteration, it automatically works with many sources of  data.  32.2 Core iteration constructs: iterables and iterators Two roles  described by interfaces  form the core of iteration  ﬁg. 32.2 :    An iterable is an object whose contents can be traversed sequentially.   An iterator is the pointer used for the traversal.  Figure 32.2: Iteration has two main interfaces: Iterable and Iterator. The former has a method that returns the latter. These are type deﬁnitions  in TypeScript’s notation  for the interfaces of the iteration protocol:  interface Iterable  {  Data consumers  Interface  Data sources  for-of loop  spreading  Iterable  Arrays  Maps  Strings  Iterable: traversable data structure ··· [Symbol.iterator]    returns  Iterator: pointer for traversing iterable next     32.3 Iterating manually  337  [Symbol.iterator]   : Iterator ;  }  }  }  interface Iterator  {  next   : IteratorResult ;  interface IteratorResult  {  value: T; done: boolean;  The interfaces are used as follows:    You ask an Iterable for an iterator via the method whose key is Symbol.iterator.   The Iterator returns the iterated values via its method .next  .   The values are not returned directly, but wrapped in objects with two properties:  – .value is the iterated value. – .done indicates if the end of the iteration has been reached yet. It is true after  the last iterated value and false beforehand.  Iterating manually  32.3 This is an example of using the iteration protocol:  const iterable = ['a', 'b'];     The iterable is a factory for iterators: const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]  ;     Call .next   until .done is true: assert.deepEqual   iterator.next  , { value: 'a', done: false } ;  assert.deepEqual   assert.deepEqual   iterator.next  , { value: 'b', done: false } ;  iterator.next  , { value: undefined, done: true } ;  Iterating over an iterable via while  32.3.1 The following code demonstrates how to use a while loop to iterate over an iterable:  function logAll iterable  {  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]  ; while  true  {  const {value, done} = iterator.next  ; if  done  break; console.log value ;  }   32 Synchronous iteration  338  }  logAll ['a', 'b'] ;    Output:    'a'    'b'  Exercise: Using sync iteration manually  exercises sync-iteration-use sync_iteration_manually_exrc.mjs  Iteration in practice  32.4 We have seen how to use the iteration protocol manually, and it is relatively cumbersome. But the protocol is not meant to be used directly – it is meant to be used via higher-level language constructs built on top of it. This section shows what that looks like.  Iterating over Arrays  32.4.1 JavaScript’s Arrays are iterable. That enables us to use the for-of loop:  Destructuring via Array patterns  explained later  also uses iteration under the hood:  const myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];  for  const x of myArray  {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'a'    'b'    'c'  const [first, second] = myArray; assert.equal first, 'a' ; assert.equal second, 'b' ;  Iterating over Sets  32.4.2 JavaScript’s Set data structure is iterable. That means for-of works:  const mySet = new Set  .add 'a' .add 'b' .add 'c' ;  for  const x of mySet  {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'a'   32.5 Quick reference: synchronous iteration  339     'b'    'c'  As does Array-destructuring:  const [first, second] = mySet; assert.equal first, 'a' ; assert.equal second, 'b' ;  32.5 Quick reference: synchronous iteration 32.5.1 The following built-in data sources are iterable:  Iterable data sources    Arrays   Strings   Maps   Sets    Browsers: DOM data structures   To iterate over the properties of objects, you need helpers such as Object.keys   and Object.entries  . That is necessary because properties exist at a different level that is independent of the level of data structures.  Iterating constructs  32.5.2 The following constructs are based on iteration:    Destructuring via an Array pattern:  const [x,y] = iterable;    The for-of loop:  for  const x of iterable  {  *···*  }    Array.from  :  const arr = Array.from iterable ;    Spreading  via ...  into function calls and Array literals:  func ...iterable ; const arr = [...iterable];    new Map   and new Set  :  const m = new Map iterableOverKeyValuePairs ; const s = new Set iterableOverElements ;    Promise.all   and Promise.race  :  const promise1 = Promise.all iterableOverPromises ; const promise2 = Promise.race iterableOverPromises ;   32 Synchronous iteration  function* generatorFunction   {  yield* iterable;  340    yield*:  }  Quiz See quiz app.   Chapter 33  Arrays  Array   Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  33.1 The two roles of Arrays in JavaScript . . . 33.2 Basic Array operations .  . . . . . . . . . . 33.2.1 Creating, reading, writing Arrays . . . 33.2.2 The .length of an Array . . . . . 33.2.3 Clearing an Array . . . . . 33.2.4 Spreading into Array literals [ES6] . . . 33.2.5 Arrays: listing indices and entries [ES6] . 33.2.6 Is a value an Array? . . . . . . 33.3 for-of and Arrays [ES6] . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33.3.1 for-of: iterating over elements . 33.3.2 for-of: iterating over indices . . . 33.3.3 for-of: iterating over [index, element] pairs . 33.4 Array-like objects . . . 33.5 Converting iterable and Array-like values to Arrays .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33.5.1 Converting iterables to Arrays via spreading  ...  . . 33.5.2 Converting iterables and Array-like objects to Arrays via Ar- . . 33.6.1 Do you need to create an empty Array that you’ll ﬁll completely .  . 33.6 Creating and ﬁlling Arrays with arbitrary lengths  ray.from    advanced  .  later on? .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 342 . 342 . 342 . 343 . 343 . 344 . 345 . 345 . 346 . 346 . 346 . 346 . 346 . 347 . 347  . 348 . 348  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 349 33.6.2 Do you need to create an Array ﬁlled with a primitive value? . 349 . 349 33.6.3 Do you need to create an Array ﬁlled with objects? . 33.6.4 Do you need to create a range of integers? . . . 349 33.6.5 Use a Typed Array if the elements are all integers or all ﬂoats . 350 . 350 . 350 . 351 . 352  . . . . 33.8.1 Array indices are  slightly special  property keys . 33.8.2 Arrays are dictionaries and can have holes . . .  33.7 Multidimensional Arrays . . . 33.8 More Array features  advanced  .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  341   342  33 Arrays  Array   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  33.9.1 Prepending elements and Arrays 33.9.2 Appending elements and Arrays 33.9.3 Removing elements . .  33.9 Adding and removing elements  destructively and non-destructively 353 . 353 . 354 . 354  . . . 33.10Methods: iteration and transformation  .find  , .map  , .filter  , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  etc.  . . 33.10.1 Callbacks for iteration and transformation methods . . . 33.10.2 Searching elements: .find  , .findIndex   . . . . . 33.10.3 .map  : copy while giving elements new values . 33.10.4 .flatMap  : mapping to zero or more values . . . . . 33.10.5 .filter  : only keep some of the elements . . . . . . 33.10.6 .reduce  : deriving a value from an Array  advanced  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33.12.1 new Array   . . 33.12.2 Static methods of Array . . 33.12.3 Methods of Array .prototype . 33.12.4 Sources . .  . . 33.11.1 Customizing the sort order . . . 33.11.2 Sorting numbers . . 33.11.3 Sorting objects . . . . . . .  . . . . 33.12Quick reference: Array  . . .  . 355 . 355 . 356 . 356 . 357 . 359 . 360 . 363 . 363 . 364 . 364 . 364 . 365 . 365 . 365 . 372  33.11.sort  : sorting Arrays .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  33.1 The two roles of Arrays in JavaScript Arrays play two roles in JavaScript:    Tuples: Arrays-as-tuples have a ﬁxed number of indexed elements. Each of those  elements can have a different type.    Sequences: Arrays-as-sequences have a variable number of indexed elements.  Each of those elements has the same type.  In practice, these two roles are often mixed. Notably, Arrays-as-sequences are so ﬂexible that you can use them as  traditional  arrays, stacks, and queues  see exercise later in this chapter .  33.2 Basic Array operations 33.2.1 Creating, reading, writing Arrays The best way to create an Array is via an Array literal:  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];  The Array literal starts and ends with square brackets []. It creates an Array with three elements: 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Trailing commas are allowed and ignored in Array literals:   33.2 Basic Array operations  343  const arr = [  'a', 'b', 'c',  ];  To read an Array element, you put an index in square brackets  indices start at zero :  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; assert.equal arr[0], 'a' ;  To change an Array element, you assign to an Array with an index:  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; arr[0] = 'x'; assert.deepEqual arr, ['x', 'b', 'c'] ;  The range of Array indices is 32 bits  excluding the maximum length : [0, 232−1   33.2.2 The .length of an Array Every Array has a property .length that can be used to both read and change !  the number of elements in an Array. The length of an Array is always the highest index plus one:  If you write to the Array at the index of the length, you append an element:  > const arr = ['a', 'b']; > arr.length 2  > arr[arr.length] = 'c'; > arr [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] > arr.length 3  > arr.push 'd' ; > arr [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ]  > arr.length = 1; > arr [ 'a' ]  If you set .length, you are pruning the Array by removing elements:  33.2.3 Clearing an Array To clear  empty  an Array, you can either set its .length to zero:  Another way of  destructively  appending an element is via the Array method .push  :   344  33 Arrays  Array   or you can assign a new empty Array to the variable storing the Array:  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; arr.length = 0; assert.deepEqual arr, [] ;  let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; arr = []; assert.deepEqual arr, [] ;  The latter approach has the advantage of not affecting other locations that point to the same Array. If, however, you do want to reset a shared Array for everyone, then you need the former approach.  Exercise: Removing empty lines via .push    exercises arrays remove_empty_lines_push_test.mjs  33.2.4 Spreading into Array literals [ES6] Inside an Array literal, a spread element consists of three dots  ...  followed by an expres- sion. It results in the expression being evaluated and then iterated over. Each iterated value becomes an additional Array element – for example:  > const iterable = ['b', 'c']; > ['a', ...iterable, 'd'] [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ]  That means that we can use spreading to create a copy of an Array:  const original = ['a', 'b', 'c']; const copy = [...original];  Spreading is also convenient for concatenating Arrays  and other iterables  into Arrays:  const arr1 = ['a', 'b']; const arr2 = ['c', 'd'];  const concatenated = [...arr1, ...arr2, 'e']; assert.deepEqual   concatenated, ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] ;  Due to spreading using iteration, it only works if the value is iterable:  > [...'abc']    strings are iterable [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] > [...123] TypeError: number 123 is not iterable > [...undefined] TypeError: undefined is not iterable   33.2 Basic Array operations  345  Spreading into Array literals is shallow  Similar to spreading into object literals, spreading into Array literals creates shallow copies. That is, nested Arrays are not copied.  33.2.5 Arrays: listing indices and entries [ES6] Method .keys   lists the indices of an Array:  const arr = ['a', 'b']; assert.deepEqual   [...arr.keys  ],     A  [0, 1] ;  .keys   returns an iterable. In line A, we spread to obtain an Array. Listing Array indices is different from listing properties. The former produces numbers; the latter produces stringiﬁed numbers  in addition to non-index property keys :  Method .entries   lists the contents of an Array as [index, element] pairs:  const arr = ['a', 'b']; arr.prop = true;  assert.deepEqual   Object.keys arr , ['0', '1', 'prop'] ;  const arr = ['a', 'b']; assert.deepEqual   [...arr.entries  ], [[0, 'a'], [1, 'b']] ;  > [] instanceof Array true > Array.isArray []  true  Is a value an Array?  33.2.6 Following are two ways of checking if a value is an Array:  instanceof is usually ﬁne. You need Array.isArray   if a value may come from an- other realm. Roughly, a realm is an instance of JavaScript’s global scope. Some realms are isolated from each other  e.g., Web Workers in browsers , but there are also realms between which you can move data – for example, same-origin iframes in browsers. x instanceof Array checks the prototype chain of x and therefore returns false if x is an Array from another realm. typeof categorizes Arrays as objects:   346  > typeof [] 'object'  33 Arrays  Array   33.3 for-of and Arrays [ES6] We have already encountered the for-of loop. This section brieﬂy recaps how to use it for Arrays.  33.3.1 for-of: iterating over elements The following for-of loop iterates over the elements of an Array:  for  const element of ['a', 'b']  {  console.log element ;  33.3.2 for-of: iterating over indices This for-of loop iterates over the indices of an Array: for  const element of ['a', 'b'].keys    {  console.log element ;  33.3.3 for-of: iterating over [index, element] pairs The following for-of loop iterates over [index, element] pairs. Destructuring  described later , gives us convenient syntax for setting up index and element in the head of for-of.  for  const [index, element] of ['a', 'b'].entries    {  console.log index, element ;  33.4 Array-like objects Some operations that work with Arrays require only the bare minimum: values must only be Array-like. An Array-like value is an object with the following properties:    .length: holds the length of the Array-like object.  }    Output:    'a'    'b'  }    Output:    0    1  }    Output:    0, 'a'    1, 'b'   33.5 Converting iterable and Array-like values to Arrays  347    [0]: holds the element at index 0  etc. . Note that if you use numbers as property names, they are always coerced to strings. Therefore, [0] retrieves the value of the property whose key is '0'.  For example, Array.from   accepts Array-like objects and converts them to Arrays:     If you omit .length, it is interpreted as 0 assert.deepEqual  Array.from {} , [] ;  assert.deepEqual   Array.from {length:2, 0:'a', 1:'b'} , [ 'a', 'b' ] ;  The TypeScript interface for Array-like objects is:  interface ArrayLike  {  length: number; [n: number]: T;  }  Array-like objects are relatively rare in modern JavaScript  Array-like objects used to be common before ES6; now you don’t see them very often.  33.5 Converting iterable and Array-like values to Arrays There are two common ways of converting iterable and Array-like values to Arrays: spreading and Array.from  .  33.5.1 Converting iterables to Arrays via spreading  ...  Inside an Array literal, spreading via ... converts any iterable object into a series of Array elements. For example:     Get an Array-like collection from a web browser’s DOM const domCollection = document.querySelectorAll 'a' ;     Alas, the collection is missing many Array methods assert.equal 'map' in domCollection, false ;     Solution: convert it to an Array const arr = [...domCollection]; assert.deepEqual   arr.map x => x.href , ['https:  2ality.com', 'https:  exploringjs.com'] ;  The conversion works because the DOM collection is iterable.   348  33 Arrays  Array   33.5.2 Converting iterables and Array-like objects to Arrays via Ar-  ray.from    advanced   Array.from   can be used in two modes.  33.5.2.1 Mode 1 of Array.from  : converting The ﬁrst mode has the following type signature:  .from  iterable: Iterable   ArrayLike  : T[]  Interface Iterable is shown in the chapter on synchronous iteration. Interface ArrayLike appeared earlier in this chapter. With a single parameter, Array.from   converts anything iterable or Array-like to an Array:  > Array.from new Set ['a', 'b']   [ 'a', 'b' ] > Array.from {length: 2, 0:'a', 1:'b'}  [ 'a', 'b' ]  33.5.2.2 Mode 2 of Array.from  : converting and mapping The second mode of Array.from   involves two parameters:  .from    iterable: Iterable   ArrayLike , mapFunc:  v: T, i: number  => U, thisArg?: any  : U[]  In this mode, Array.from   does several things:    It iterates over iterable.   It calls mapFunc with each iterated value. The optional parameter thisArg speciﬁes  a this for mapFunc.    It applies mapFunc to each iterated value.   It collects the results in a new Array and returns it.  In other words: we are going from an iterable with elements of type T to an Array with elements of type U. This is an example:  > Array.from new Set ['a', 'b'] , x => x + x  [ 'aa', 'bb' ]  33.6 Creating and ﬁlling Arrays with arbitrary lengths The best way of creating an Array is via an Array literal. However, you can’t always use one: The Array may be too large, you may not know its length during development, or   33.6 Creating and ﬁlling Arrays with arbitrary lengths  349  you may want to keep its length ﬂexible. Then I recommend the following techniques for creating, and possibly ﬁlling, Arrays.  33.6.1 Do you need to create an empty Array that you’ll ﬁll completely  later on? > new Array 3  [ , , ,]  Note that the result has three holes  empty slots  – the last comma in an Array literal is always ignored.  33.6.2 Do you need to create an Array ﬁlled with a primitive value?  > new Array 3 .fill 0  [0, 0, 0]  Caveat: If you use .fill   with an object, then each Array element will refer to this object  sharing it .  const arr = new Array 3 .fill {} ; arr[0].prop = true; assert.deepEqual   arr, [  {prop: true}, {prop: true}, {prop: true},  ] ;  The next subsection explains how to ﬁx this.  33.6.3 Do you need to create an Array ﬁlled with objects?  > Array.from {length: 3},    =>  {}   [{}, {}, {}]  33.6.4 Do you need to create a range of integers?  function createRange start, end  {  return Array.from {length: end-start},  _, i  => i+start ;  } assert.deepEqual   createRange 2, 5 , [2, 3, 4] ;   ** Returns an iterable *  function createRange end  {  return new Array end .keys  ;  Here is an alternative, slightly hacky technique for creating integer ranges that start at zero:   350  33 Arrays  Array   } assert.deepEqual   [...createRange 4 ], [0, 1, 2, 3] ;  This works because .keys   treats holes like undefined elements and lists their indices.  33.6.5 Use a Typed Array if the elements are all integers or all ﬂoats If you are dealing with Arrays of integers or ﬂoats, consider Typed Arrays, which were created for this purpose.  33.7 Multidimensional Arrays JavaScript does not have real multidimensional Arrays; you need to resort to Arrays whose elements are Arrays:  function initMultiArray ...dimensions  { function initMultiArrayRec dimIndex  { if  dimIndex >= dimensions.length  {  return 0;  } else {  const dim = dimensions[dimIndex]; const arr = []; for  let i=0; i<dim; i++  {  arr.push initMultiArrayRec dimIndex+1  ;  } return arr;  }  } return initMultiArrayRec 0 ;  }  ] ;  const arr = initMultiArray 4, 3, 2 ; arr[3][2][1] = 'X';    last in each dimension assert.deepEqual arr, [  [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ] ], [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ] ], [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ] ], [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0 ], [ 0, 'X' ] ],  33.8 More Array features  advanced  In this section, we look at phenomena you don’t encounter often when working with Arrays.   33.8 More Array features  advanced   351  33.8.1 Array indices are  slightly special  property keys You’d think that Array elements are special because you are accessing them via numbers. But the square brackets operator [] for doing so is the same operator that is used for accessing properties. It coerces any value  that is not a symbol  to a string. Therefore, Array elements are  almost  normal properties  line A  and it doesn’t matter if you use numbers or strings as indices  lines B and C :  const arr = ['a', 'b']; arr.prop = 123; assert.deepEqual   Object.keys arr , ['0', '1', 'prop'] ;     A   assert.equal arr[0], 'a' ;     B  assert.equal arr['0'], 'a' ;     C   To make matters even more confusing, this is only how the language speciﬁcation deﬁnes things  the theory of JavaScript, if you will . Most JavaScript engines optimize under the hood and do use actual integers to access Array elements  the practice of JavaScript, if you will . Property keys  strings!  that are used for Array elements are called indices. A string str is an index if converting it to a 32-bit unsigned integer and back results in the original value. Written as a formula:  ToString ToUint32 str   === str  33.8.1.1 Listing indices When listing property keys, indices are treated specially – they always come ﬁrst and are sorted like numbers  '2' comes before '10' :  const arr = []; arr.prop = true; arr[1] = 'b'; arr[0] = 'a';  assert.deepEqual   Object.keys arr , ['0', '1', 'prop'] ;  assert.equal arr.length, 2 ; assert.deepEqual   [...arr.keys  ], [0, 1] ;  assert.deepEqual   Note that .length, .entries   and .keys   treat Array indices as numbers and ignore non-index properties:  [...arr.entries  ], [[0, 'a'], [1, 'b']] ;  We used a spread element  ...  to convert the iterables returned by .keys   and .en- tries   to Arrays.   352  33 Arrays  Array   33.8.2 Arrays are dictionaries and can have holes We distinguish two kinds of Arrays in JavaScript:    An Array arr is dense if all indices i, with 0 ≤ i < arr.length, exist. That is, the  indices form a contiguous range.    An Array is sparse if the range of indices has holes in it. That is, some indices are  missing.  Arrays can be sparse in JavaScript because Arrays are actually dictionaries from indices to values.  Recommendation: avoid holes  So far, we have only seen dense Arrays and it’s indeed recommended to avoid holes: They make your code more complicated and are not handled consistently by Array methods. Additionally, JavaScript engines optimize dense Arrays, making them faster.  33.8.2.1 Creating holes You can create holes by skipping indices when assigning elements:  const arr = []; arr[0] = 'a'; arr[2] = 'c';  assert.deepEqual Object.keys arr , ['0', '2'] ;     A   assert.equal 0 in arr, true ;    element assert.equal 1 in arr, false ;    hole  In line A, we are using Object.keys   because arr.keys   treats holes as if they were undefined elements and does not reveal them. Another way of creating holes is to skip elements in Array literals:  const arr = ['a', , 'c'];  assert.deepEqual Object.keys arr , ['0', '2'] ;  You can also delete Array elements: const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; assert.deepEqual Object.keys arr , ['0', '1', '2'] ; delete arr[1]; assert.deepEqual Object.keys arr , ['0', '2'] ;  33.8.2.2 How do Array operations treat holes? Alas, there are many different ways in which Array operations treat holes. Some Array operations remove holes:   33.9 Adding and removing elements  destructively and non-destructively   353  > ['a',,'b'].filter x => true  [ 'a', 'b' ]  Some Array operations ignore holes:  > ['a', ,'a'].every x => x === 'a'  true  Some Array operations ignore but preserve holes:  > ['a',,'b'].map x => 'c'  [ 'c', , 'c' ]  Some Array operations treat holes as undefined elements:  > Array.from ['a',,'b'], x => x  [ 'a', undefined, 'b' ] > [...['a',,'b'].entries  ] [[0, 'a'], [1, undefined], [2, 'b']]  Object.keys   works differently than .keys    strings vs. numbers, holes don’t have keys :  > [...['a',,'b'].keys  ] [ 0, 1, 2 ] > Object.keys ['a',,'b']  [ '0', '2' ]  There is no rule to remember here. If it ever matters how an Array operation treats holes, the best approach is to do a quick test in a console.  33.9 Adding and removing elements  destructively and  non-destructively   JavaScript’s Array is quite ﬂexible and more like a combination of array, stack, and queue. This section explores ways of adding and removing Array elements. Most operations can be performed both destructively  modifying the Array  and non-destructively  producing a modiﬁed copy .  33.9.1 Prepending elements and Arrays In the following code, we destructively prepend single elements to arr1 and an Array to arr2:  const arr1 = ['a', 'b']; arr1.unshift 'x', 'y' ;    prepend single elements assert.deepEqual arr1, ['x', 'y', 'a', 'b'] ;  const arr2 = ['a', 'b']; arr2.unshift ...['x', 'y'] ;    prepend Array assert.deepEqual arr2, ['x', 'y', 'a', 'b'] ;   354  33 Arrays  Array   33.9.2 Appending elements and Arrays In the following code, we destructively append single elements to arr1 and an Array to arr2:  Spreading lets us unshift an Array into arr2. Non-destructive prepending is done via spread elements:  const arr1 = ['a', 'b']; assert.deepEqual   ['x', 'y', ...arr1],    prepend single elements ['x', 'y', 'a', 'b'] ;  assert.deepEqual arr1, ['a', 'b'] ;    unchanged!  const arr2 = ['a', 'b']; assert.deepEqual   [...['x', 'y'], ...arr2],    prepend Array ['x', 'y', 'a', 'b'] ;  assert.deepEqual arr2, ['a', 'b'] ;    unchanged!  const arr1 = ['a', 'b']; arr1.push 'x', 'y' ;    append single elements assert.deepEqual arr1, ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y'] ;  const arr2 = ['a', 'b']; arr2.push ...['x', 'y'] ;    append Array assert.deepEqual arr2, ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y'] ;  Spreading lets us push an Array into arr2. Non-destructive appending is done via spread elements:  const arr1 = ['a', 'b']; assert.deepEqual   [...arr1, 'x', 'y'],    append single elements ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y'] ;  assert.deepEqual arr1, ['a', 'b'] ;    unchanged!  const arr2 = ['a', 'b']; assert.deepEqual   [...arr2, ...['x', 'y']],    append Array ['a', 'b', 'x', 'y'] ;  assert.deepEqual arr2, ['a', 'b'] ;    unchanged!  33.9.3 Removing elements These are three destructive ways of removing Array elements:     Destructively remove first element: const arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']; assert.equal arr1.shift  , 'a' ;   33.10 Methods: iteration and transformation  .find  , .map  , .filter  , etc.   355  assert.deepEqual arr1, ['b', 'c'] ;     Destructively remove last element: const arr2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']; assert.equal arr2.pop  , 'c' ; assert.deepEqual arr2, ['a', 'b'] ;     Remove one or more elements anywhere: const arr3 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']; assert.deepEqual arr3.splice 1, 2 , ['b', 'c'] ; assert.deepEqual arr3, ['a', 'd'] ;  .splice   is covered in more detail in the quick reference at the end of this chapter. Destructuring via a rest element lets you non-destructively remove elements from the beginning of an Array  destructuring is covered later .  const arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];    Ignore first element, extract remaining elements const [, ...arr2] = arr1;  assert.deepEqual arr2, ['b', 'c'] ; assert.deepEqual arr1, ['a', 'b', 'c'] ;    unchanged!  Alas, a rest element must come last in an Array. Therefore, you can only use it to extract sufﬁxes.  Exercise: Implementing a queue via an Array  exercises arrays queue_via_array_test.mjs  33.10 Methods:  iteration and transformation  .find  ,  .map  , .filter  , etc.   In this section, we take a look at Array methods for iterating over Arrays and for trans- forming Arrays.  33.10.1 Callbacks for iteration and transformation methods All iteration and transformation methods use callbacks. The former feed all iterated val- ues to their callbacks; the latter ask their callbacks how to transform Arrays. These callbacks have type signatures that look as follows:  callback:  value: T, index: number, array: Array   => boolean  That is, the callback gets three parameters  it is free to ignore any of them :    value is the most important one. This parameter holds the iterated value that is  currently being processed.   356  33 Arrays  Array     index can additionally tell the callback what the index of the iterated value is.   array points to the current Array  the receiver of the method call . Some algo- rithms need to refer to the whole Array – e.g., to search it for answers. This param- eter lets you write reusable callbacks for such algorithms.  What the callback is expected to return depends on the method it is passed to. Possibili- ties include:    .map   ﬁlls its result with the values returned by its callback:  > ['a', 'b', 'c'].map x => x + x  [ 'aa', 'bb', 'cc' ]    .find   returns the ﬁrst Array element for which its callback returns true:  > ['a', 'bb', 'ccc'].find str => str.length >= 2  'bb'  Both of these methods are described in more detail later.  33.10.2 Searching elements: .find  , .findIndex   .find   returns the ﬁrst element for which its callback returns a truthy value  and un- defined if it can’t ﬁnd anything :  .findIndex   returns the index of the ﬁrst element for which its callback returns a truthy value  and -1 if it can’t ﬁnd anything :  > [6, -5, 8].find x => x < 0  -5 > [6, 5, 8].find x => x < 0  undefined  > [6, -5, 8].findIndex x => x < 0  1 > [6, 5, 8].findIndex x => x < 0  -1  .findIndex   can be implemented as follows: function findIndex arr, callback  {  for  const [i, x] of arr.entries    {  if  callback x, i, arr   {  return i;  }  } return -1;  }  33.10.3 .map  : copy while giving elements new values .map   returns a modiﬁed copy of the receiver. The elements of the copy are the results of applying map’s callback to the elements of the receiver.   33.10 Methods: iteration and transformation  .find  , .map  , .filter  , etc.   357  All of this is easier to understand via examples:  > [1, 2, 3].map x => x * 3  [ 3, 6, 9 ] > ['how', 'are', 'you'].map str => str.toUpperCase    [ 'HOW', 'ARE', 'YOU' ] > [true, true, true].map  _x, index  => index  [ 0, 1, 2 ]  .map   can be implemented as follows:  function map arr, mapFunc  {  const result = []; for  const [i, x] of arr.entries    {  result.push mapFunc x, i, arr  ;  } return result;  }  Exercise: Numbering lines via .map   exercises arrays number_lines_test.mjs  33.10.4 .flatMap  : mapping to zero or more values The type signature of Array .prototype.flatMap   is:  .flatMap     : U[]  callback:  value: T, index: number, array: T[]  => UArray , thisValue?: any  Both .map   and .flatMap   take a function callback as a parameter that controls how an input Array is translated to an output Array:    With .map  , each input Array element is translated to exactly one output element.  That is, callback returns a single value.    With .flatMap  , each input Array element is translated to zero or more output elements. That is, callback returns an Array of values  it can also return non- Array values, but that is rare .  This is .flatMap   in action:  > ['a', 'b', 'c'].flatMap x => [x,x]  [ 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c' ] > ['a', 'b', 'c'].flatMap x => [x]  [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] > ['a', 'b', 'c'].flatMap x => []  []   358  33 Arrays  Array   33.10.4.1 A simple implementation You could implement .flatMap   as follows. Note: This implementation is simpler than the built-in version, which, for example, performs more checks.  function flatMap arr, mapFunc  {  const result = []; for  const [index, elem] of arr.entries    {  const x = mapFunc elem, index, arr ;    We allow mapFunc   to return non-Arrays if  Array.isArray x   {  result.push ...x ;  } else {  result.push x ;  }  } return result;  }  What is .flatMap   good for? Let’s look at use cases!  33.10.4.2 Use case: ﬁltering and mapping at the same time The result of the Array method .map   always has the same length as the Array it is invoked on. That is, its callback can’t skip Array elements it isn’t interested in. The ability of .flatMap   to do so is useful in the next example. We will use the following function processArray   to create an Array that we’ll then ﬁlter and map via .flatMap  :  function processArray arr, callback  {  return arr.map x => {  try {  return { value: callback x  };  } catch  e  {  return { error: e };  } } ;  }  ] ;  Next, we create an Array results via processArray  :  const results = processArray [1, -5, 6], throwIfNegative ; assert.deepEqual results, [  { value: 1 }, { error: new Error 'Illegal value: -5'  }, { value: 6 },  function throwIfNegative value  {  if  value < 0  {  throw new Error 'Illegal value: '+value ;   33.10 Methods: iteration and transformation  .find  , .map  , .filter  , etc.   359  } return value;  }  We can now use .flatMap   to extract just the values or just the errors from results:  const values = results.flatMap   result => result.value ? [result.value] : [] ;  assert.deepEqual values, [1, 6] ;  const errors = results.flatMap   result => result.error ? [result.error] : [] ;  assert.deepEqual errors, [new Error 'Illegal value: -5' ] ;  33.10.4.3 Use case: mapping to multiple values The Array method .map   maps each input Array element to one output element. But what if we want to map it to multiple output elements? That becomes necessary in the following example:  > stringsToCodePoints ['many', 'a', 'moon']  ['m', 'a', 'n', 'y', 'a', 'm', 'o', 'o', 'n']  We want to convert an Array of strings to an Array of Unicode characters  code points . The following function achieves that via .flatMap  :  function stringsToCodePoints strs  {  return strs.flatMap str => [...str] ;  }  Exercises: .flatMap      exercises arrays convert_to_numbers_test.mjs   exercises arrays replace_objects_test.mjs  33.10.5 .filter  : only keep some of the elements The Array method .filter   returns an Array collecting all elements for which the call- back returns a truthy value. For example:  > [-1, 2, 5, -7, 6].filter x => x >= 0  [ 2, 5, 6 ] > ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].filter  _x,i  =>  i%2 ===0  [ 'a', 'c' ]  .filter   can be implemented as follows: function filter arr, filterFunc  {  const result = [];   360  33 Arrays  Array   for  const [i, x] of arr.entries    {  if  filterFunc x, i, arr   {  result.push x ;  }  } return result;  }  Exercise: Removing empty lines via .filter    exercises arrays remove_empty_lines_filter_test.mjs  33.10.6 .reduce  : deriving a value from an Array  advanced  Method .reduce   is a powerful tool for computing a “summary” of an Array arr. A summary can be any kind of value:    A number. For example, the sum of all elements of arr.   An Array. For example, a copy of arr, where each element is twice the original  element.    Etc.  .reduce    reduce is also known as foldl  “fold left”  in functional programming and popular there. One caveat is that it can make code difﬁcult to understand. .reduce   has the following type signature  inside an Array  :  callback:  accumulator: U, element: T, index: number, array: T[]  => U, init?: U  : U  T is the type of the Array elements, U is the type of the summary. The two may or may not be different. accumulator is just another name for “summary”. To compute the summary of an Array arr, .reduce   feeds all Array elements to its callback one at a time:  const accumulator_0 = callback init, arr[0] ; const accumulator_1 = callback accumulator_0, arr[1] ; const accumulator_2 = callback accumulator_1, arr[2] ;    Etc.  callback combines the previously computed summary  stored in its parameter accu- mulator  with the current Array element and returns the next accumulator. The result of .reduce   is the ﬁnal accumulator – the last result of callback after it has visited all elements. In other words: callback does most of the work; .reduce   just invokes it in a useful manner.   33.10 Methods: iteration and transformation  .find  , .map  , .filter  , etc.   361  You could say that the callback folds Array elements into the accumulator. That’s why this operation is called “fold” in functional programming.  33.10.6.1 A ﬁrst example Let’s look at an example of .reduce   in action: function addAll   computes the sum of all numbers in an Array arr. function addAll arr  { const startSum = 0; const callback =  sum, element  => sum + element; return arr.reduce callback, startSum ;  } assert.equal addAll [1, assert.equal addAll [7, -4, 2] , 5 ;  2, 3] , 6 ;     A   In this case, the accumulator holds the sum of all Array elements that callback has al- ready visited. How was the result 6 derived from the Array in line A? Via the following invocations of callback:  callback 0, 1  --> 1 callback 1, 2  --> 3 callback 3, 3  --> 6  Notes:    The ﬁrst parameters are the current accumulators  starting with parameter init of  .reduce   .    The second parameters are the current Array elements.   The results are the next accumulators.   The last result of callback is also the result of .reduce  .  Alternatively, we could have implemented addAll   via a for-of loop:  function addAll arr  {  let sum = 0; for  const element of arr  {  sum = sum + element;  } return sum;  }  It’s hard to say which of the two implementations is “better”: the one based on .reduce   is a little more concise, while the one based on for-of may be a little easier to understand – especially if you are not familiar with functional programming.  33.10.6.2 Example: ﬁnding indices via .reduce   The following function is an implementation of the Array method .indexOf  . It returns the ﬁrst index at which the given searchValue appears inside the Array arr:   362  33 Arrays  Array   const NOT_FOUND = -1; function indexOf arr, searchValue  {  return arr.reduce    result, elem, index  => {  if  result !== NOT_FOUND  {     We have already found something: don’t change anything return result;  } else if  elem === searchValue  {  return index;  } else {  return NOT_FOUND;  }  }, NOT_FOUND ;  } assert.equal indexOf ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'b' , 1 ; assert.equal indexOf ['a', 'b', 'c'], 'x' , -1 ;  One limitation of .reduce   is that you can’t ﬁnish early  in a for-of loop, you can break . Here, we always immediately return the result once we have found it.  33.10.6.3 Example: doubling Array elements Function double arr  returns a copy of inArr whose elements are all multiplied by 2:  function double inArr  {  return inArr.reduce    outArr, element  => {  outArr.push element * 2 ; return outArr;  }, [] ;  } assert.deepEqual   double [1, 2, 3] , [2, 4, 6] ;  We modify the initial value [] by pushing into it. A non-destructive, more functional version of double   looks as follows:  function double inArr  {  return inArr.reduce      Don’t change `outArr`, return a fresh Array  outArr, element  => [...outArr, element * 2], [] ;  } assert.deepEqual   double [1, 2, 3] , [2, 4, 6] ;  This version is more elegant but also slower and uses more memory.   33.11 .sort  : sorting Arrays  363  Exercises: .reduce      map   via .reduce  : exercises arrays map_via_reduce_test.mjs   filter   via .reduce  : exercises arrays filter_via_reduce_test.mjs   countMatches   via .reduce  : exercises arrays count_matches_via_  reduce_test.mjs  33.11 .sort  : sorting Arrays .sort   has the following type deﬁnition:  sort compareFunc?:  a: T, b: T  => number : this  By default, .sort   sorts string representations of the elements. These representations are compared via <. This operator compares lexicographically  the ﬁrst characters are most signiﬁcant . You can see that when sorting numbers:  > [200, 3, 10].sort   [ 10, 200, 3 ]  When sorting human-language strings, you need to be aware that they are compared according to their code unit values  char codes :  > ['pie', 'cookie', 'éclair', 'Pie', 'Cookie', 'Éclair'].sort   [ 'Cookie', 'Pie', 'cookie', 'pie', 'Éclair', 'éclair' ]  As you can see, all unaccented uppercase letters come before all unaccented lowercase letters, which come before all accented letters. Use Intl, the JavaScript internationaliza- tion API, if you want proper sorting for human languages. Note that .sort   sorts in place; it changes and returns its receiver:  33.11.1 Customizing the sort order You can customize the sort order via the parameter compareFunc, which must return a number that is:  > const arr = ['a', 'c', 'b']; > arr.sort   === arr true > arr [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]    negative if a < b   zero if a === b   positive if a > b  Tip for remembering these rules  A negative number is less than zero  etc. .   364  33 Arrays  Array   33.11.2 Sorting numbers You can use this helper function to sort numbers:  function compareNumbers a, b  {  } else if  a === b  {  if  a < b  { return -1;  return 0;  } else {  return 1;  }  } assert.deepEqual   [200, 3, 10].sort compareNumbers , [3, 10, 200] ;  The following is a quick and dirty alternative.  > [200, 3, 10].sort  a,b  => a - b  [ 3, 10, 200 ]  The downsides of this approach are:    It is cryptic.   There is a risk of numeric overﬂow or underﬂow, if a-b becomes a large positive  or negative number.  33.11.3 Sorting objects You also need to use a compare function if you want to sort objects. As an example, the following code shows how to sort objects by age.  const arr = [ {age: 200}, {age: 3}, {age: 10} ]; assert.deepEqual   arr.sort  obj1, obj2  => obj1.age - obj2.age , [{ age: 3 }, { age: 10 }, { age: 200 }]  ;  Exercise: Sorting objects by name  exercises arrays sort_objects_test.mjs  33.12 Quick reference: Array  Legend:    R: method does not change the Array  non-destructive .   W: method changes the Array  destructive .   33.12 Quick reference: Array   365  33.12.1 new Array   new Array n  creates an Array of length n that contains n holes:     Trailing commas are always ignored.    Therefore: number of commas = number of holes assert.deepEqual new Array 3 , [,,,] ;  new Array   creates an empty Array. However, I recommend to always use [] instead.  33.12.2 Static methods of Array    Array.from  iterable: Iterable   ArrayLike  : T[] [ES6]   Array.from  iterable: Iterable   ArrayLike , mapFunc:  v: T,  k: number  => U, thisArg?: any : U[] [ES6] Converts an iterable or an Array-like object to an Array. Optionally, the input values can be translated via mapFunc before they are added to the output Array. Examples:  > Array.from new Set ['a', 'b']      iterable [ 'a', 'b' ] > Array.from {length: 2, 0:'a', 1:'b'}     Array-like object [ 'a', 'b' ]    Array.of  ...items: T[] : T[] [ES6]  This static method is mainly useful for subclasses of Array, where it serves as a custom Array literal:  class MyArray extends Array {}  assert.equal   MyArray.of 'a', 'b'  instanceof MyArray, true ;  33.12.3 Methods of Array .prototype    .concat ...items: Array  : T[] [R, ES3]  Returns a new Array that is the concatenation of the receiver and all items. Non- Array parameters  such as 'b' in the following example  are treated as if they were Arrays with single elements.  > ['a'].concat 'b', ['c', 'd']  [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' ]    .copyWithin target: number, start: number, end=this.length : this [W, ES6] Copies the elements whose indices range from  including  start to  excluding  end to indices starting with target.

The opposite of .pop  .    .reduce  callback:  accumulator: U, element: T, index: number, array:  T[]  => U, init?: U : U [R, ES5] This method produces a summary of the receiver: it feeds all Array elements to callback, which combines a current summary  in parameter accumulator  with the current Array element and returns the next accumulator:  const accumulator_0 = callback init, arr[0] ; const accumulator_1 = callback accumulator_0, arr[1] ; const accumulator_2 = callback accumulator_1, arr[2] ;    Etc.  The result of .reduce   is the last result of callback after it has visited all Array elements.  > [1, 2, 3].reduce  accu, x  => accu + x, 0  6 > [1, 2, 3].reduce  accu, x  => accu + String x , ''  '123'  If no init is provided, the Array element at index 0 is used and the element at index 1 is visited ﬁrst. Therefore, the Array must have at least length 1.    .reduceRight  callback:  accumulator: U, element: T, index: number,  array: T[]  => U, init?: U : U [R, ES5]   370  33 Arrays  Array   Works like .reduce  , but visits the Array elements backward, starting with the last element.  > [1, 2, 3].reduceRight  accu, x  => accu + String x , ''  '321'    .reverse  : this [W, ES1]  Rearranges the elements of the receiver so that they are in reverse order and then returns the receiver.  > const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; > arr.reverse   [ 'c', 'b', 'a' ] > arr [ 'c', 'b', 'a' ]    .shift  : T  undefined [W, ES3]  > const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; > arr.shift   'a' > arr [ 'b', 'c' ]  Removes and returns the ﬁrst element of the receiver.

Other- wise, it returns false. It stops as soon as it receives a truthy value.

By default, it sorts string representations of the elements. It does so lexicographically and according to the code unit values  char codes  of the characters:  > ['pie', 'cookie', 'éclair', 'Pie', 'Cookie', 'Éclair'].sort   [ 'Cookie', 'Pie', 'cookie', 'pie', 'Éclair', 'éclair' ] > [200, 3, 10].sort   [ 10, 200, 3 ]  You can customize the sort order via compareFunc, which returns a number that is:  – negative if a < b – zero if a === b – positive if a > b  Trick for sorting numbers  with a risk of numeric overﬂow or underﬂow :  > [200, 3, 10].sort  a, b  => a - b  [ 3, 10, 200 ]  .sort   is stable  Since ECMAScript 2019, sorting is guaranteed to be stable: if elements are considered equal by sorting, then sorting does not change the order of those elements  relative to each other .    .splice start: number, deleteCount=this.length-start, ...items: T[] :  T[] [W, ES3] At index start, it removes deleteCount elements and inserts the items. It returns the deleted elements.  > const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']; > arr.splice 1, 2, 'x', 'y'  [ 'b', 'c' ] > arr [ 'a', 'x', 'y', 'd' ]  start can be negative and is added to .length if it is:  > ['a', 'b', 'c'].splice -2, 2  [ 'b', 'c' ]    .toString  : string [R, ES1]  Converts all elements to strings via String  , concatenates them while separating them with commas, and returns the result.  > [1, 2, 3].toString   '1,2,3' > ['1', '2', '3'].toString   '1,2,3'   372  33 Arrays  Array   > [].toString   ''    .unshift ...items: T[] : number [W, ES3]  Inserts the items at the beginning of the receiver and returns its length after this modiﬁcation.  > const arr = ['c', 'd']; > arr.unshift 'e', 'f'  4 > arr [ 'e', 'f', 'c', 'd' ]    .values  : Iterable  [R, ES6]  Returns an iterable over the values of the receiver.  > [...['a', 'b'].values  ] [ 'a', 'b' ]  33.12.4 Sources    TypeScript’s built-in typings   MDN web docs for JavaScript   ECMAScript language speciﬁcation  Quiz See quiz app.   Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   Chapter 34  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . .  34.2 Element types .  34.1 The basics of the API  . . 34.3 More information on Typed Arrays .  . . . . . . 34.2.1 Handling overﬂow and underﬂow . . . 34.2.2 Endianness . .  . . . . 34.1.1 Use cases for Typed Arrays . . . 34.1.2 The core classes: ArrayBuffer, Typed Arrays, DataView . . . 34.1.3 Using Typed Arrays . . . . . 34.1.4 Using DataViews . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34.3.1 The static method «ElementType»Array.from   . . . . . . 34.3.2 Typed Arrays are iterable . . . . 34.3.3 Typed Arrays vs. normal Arrays . . . . . . 34.3.4 Converting Typed Arrays to and from normal Arrays . . 34.3.5 Concatenating Typed Arrays . . . . . . . . . 34.4 Quick references: indices vs. offsets . . . . . . . . 34.5 Quick reference: ArrayBuffers . . . . . . 34.5.1 new ArrayBuffer   . . . . . . . 34.5.2 Static methods of ArrayBuffer . . . . . . . . . 34.5.3 Properties of ArrayBuffer.prototype . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34.6.1 Static methods of TypedArray  . . . . . 34.6.2 Properties of TypedArray .prototype . . . 34.6.3 new «ElementType»Array   . . . 34.6.4 Static properties of «ElementType»Array . . . 34.6.5 Properties of «ElementType»Array.prototype . . .  34.6 Quick reference: Typed Arrays .  34.7 Quick reference: DataViews .  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 374 . 374 . 374 . 375 . 376 . 376 . 377 . 378 . 379 . 379 . 380 . 381 . 381 . 382 . 382 . 383 . 383 . 383 . 384 . 384 . 384 . 385 . 386 . 387 . 387 . 387  373   374  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   34.7.1 new DataView   . . . 34.7.2 Properties of DataView.prototype .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . 387 . 388  34.1 The basics of the API Much data on the web is text: JSON ﬁles, HTML ﬁles, CSS ﬁles, JavaScript code, etc. JavaScript handles such data well via its built-in strings. However, before 2011, it did not handle binary data well. The Typed Array Speciﬁcation 1.0 was introduced on February 8, 2011 and provides tools for working with binary data. With ECMAScript 6, Typed Arrays were added to the core language and gained methods that were previously only available for normal Arrays  .map  , .filter  , etc. .  34.1.1 Use cases for Typed Arrays The main uses cases for Typed Arrays, are:    Processing binary data: managing image data, manipulating binary ﬁles, handling  binary network protocols, etc.    Interacting with native APIs: Native APIs often receive and return data in a binary format, which you could neither store nor manipulate well in pre-ES6 JavaScript. That meant that whenever you were communicating with such an API, data had to be converted from JavaScript to binary and back for every call. Typed Arrays elim- inate this bottleneck. One example of communicating with native APIs is WebGL, for which Typed Arrays were initially created. Section “History of Typed Arrays” of the article “Typed Arrays: Binary Data in the Browser”  by Ilmari Heikkinen for HTML5 Rocks  has more information.  34.1.2 The core classes: ArrayBuffer, Typed Arrays, DataView The Typed Array API stores binary data in instances of ArrayBuffer:  const buf = new ArrayBuffer 4 ;    length in bytes     buf is initialized with zeros  An ArrayBuffer itself is a black box: if you want to access its data, you must wrap it in another object – a view object. Two kinds of view objects are available:    Typed Arrays: let you access the data as an indexed sequence of elements that all  have the same type. Examples include:  – Uint8Array: Elements are unsigned 8-bit integers. Unsigned means that their  ranges start at zero.  – Int16Array: Elements are signed 16-bit integers. Signed means that they have  a sign and can be negative, zero, or positive.  – Float32Array: Elements are 32-bit ﬂoating point numbers.    DataViews: let you interpret the data as various types  Uint8, Int16, Float32, etc.   that you can read and write at any byte offset.  Fig. 34.1 shows a class diagram of the API.   34.1 The basics of the API  375  Figure 34.1: The classes of the Typed Array API.  34.1.3 Using Typed Arrays Typed Arrays are used much like normal Arrays with a few notable differences:    Typed Arrays store their data in ArrayBuffers.   All elements are initialized with zeros.   All elements have the same type. Writing values to a Typed Array coerces them to  that type. Reading values produces normal numbers or bigints.   The length of a Typed Array is immutable; it can’t be changed.   Typed Arrays can’t have holes.  34.1.3.1 Creating Typed Arrays The following code shows three different ways of creating the same Typed Array:     Argument: Typed Array or Array-like object const ta1 = new Uint8Array [0, 1, 2] ;  const ta2 = Uint8Array.of 0, 1, 2 ;  const ta3 = new Uint8Array 3 ;    length of Typed Array ta3[0] = 0; ta3[1] = 1; ta3[2] = 2;  assert.deepEqual ta1, ta2 ; assert.deepEqual ta1, ta3 ;   376  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   34.1.3.2 The wrapped ArrayBuffer  const typedArray = new Int16Array 2 ;    2 elements assert.equal typedArray.length, 2 ;  assert.deepEqual   typedArray.buffer, new ArrayBuffer 4  ;    4 bytes  34.1.3.3 Getting and setting elements  const typedArray = new Int16Array 2 ;  assert.equal typedArray[1], 0 ;    initialized with 0 typedArray[1] = 72; assert.equal typedArray[1], 72 ;  34.1.4 Using DataViews This is how DataViews are used:  const dataView = new DataView new ArrayBuffer 4  ; assert.equal dataView.getInt16 0 , 0 ; assert.equal dataView.getUint8 0 , 0 ; dataView.setUint8 0, 5 ;  34.2 Element types  Table 34.1: Element types supported by the Typed Array API.

These types  e.g., Int32  show up in two loca- tions:    In Typed Arrays, they specify the types of the elements. For example, all elements   34.2 Element types  377  of a Int32Array have the type Int32. The element type is the only aspect of Typed Arrays that differs.    In DataViews, they are the lenses through which they access their ArrayBuffers  when you use methods such as .getInt32   and .setInt32  .  The element type Uint8C is special: it is not supported by DataView and only exists to enable Uint8ClampedArray. This Typed Array is used by the canvas element  where it replaces CanvasPixelArray  and should otherwise be avoided. The only difference between Uint8C and Uint8 is how overﬂow and underﬂow are handled  as explained in the next subsection . Typed Arrays and Array Buffers use numbers and bigints to import and export values:   The types BigInt64 and BigUint64 are handled via bigints. For example, setters  accept bigints and getters return bigints.    All other element types are handled via numbers.  34.2.1 Handling overﬂow and underﬂow Normally, when a value is out of the range of the element type, modulo arithmetic is used to convert it to a value within range. For signed and unsigned integers that means that:    The highest value plus one is converted to the lowest value  0 for unsigned inte-  gers .    The lowest value minus one is converted to the highest value.  The following function helps illustrate how conversion works:  function setAndGet typedArray, value  {  typedArray[0] = value; return typedArray[0];  }  Modulo conversion for unsigned 8-bit integers:  const uint8 = new Uint8Array 1 ;     Highest value of range assert.equal setAndGet uint8, 255 , 255 ;    Overflow assert.equal setAndGet uint8, 256 , 0 ;     Lowest value of range assert.equal setAndGet uint8, 0 , 0 ;    Underflow assert.equal setAndGet uint8, -1 , 255 ;  Modulo conversion for signed 8-bit integers:  const int8 = new Int8Array 1 ;   378  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced      Highest value of range assert.equal setAndGet int8, 127 , 127 ;    Overflow assert.equal setAndGet int8, 128 , -128 ;     Lowest value of range assert.equal setAndGet int8, -128 , -128 ;    Underflow assert.equal setAndGet int8, -129 , 127 ;  Clamped conversion is different:    All underﬂowing values are converted to the lowest value.   All overﬂowing values are converted to the highest value. const uint8c = new Uint8ClampedArray 1 ;     Highest value of range assert.equal setAndGet uint8c, 255 , 255 ;    Overflow assert.equal setAndGet uint8c, 256 , 255 ;     Lowest value of range assert.equal setAndGet uint8c, 0 , 0 ;    Underflow assert.equal setAndGet uint8c, -1 , 0 ;  34.2.2 Endianness Whenever a type  such as Uint16  is stored as a sequence of multiple bytes, endianness matters:    Big endian: the most signiﬁcant byte comes ﬁrst. For example, the Uint16 value  0x4321 is stored as two bytes – ﬁrst 0x43, then 0x21.    Little endian: the least signiﬁcant byte comes ﬁrst. For example, the Uint16 value  0x4321 is stored as two bytes – ﬁrst 0x21, then 0x43.  Endianness tends to be ﬁxed per CPU architecture and consistent across native APIs. Typed Arrays are used to communicate with those APIs, which is why their endianness follows the endianness of the platform and can’t be changed. On the other hand, the endianness of protocols and binary ﬁles varies, but is ﬁxed per format, across platforms. Therefore, we must be able to access data with either endian- ness. DataViews serve this use case and let you specify endianness when you get or set a value. Quoting Wikipedia on Endianness:    Big-endian representation is the most common convention in data networking; ﬁelds in the protocols of the Internet protocol suite, such as IPv4, IPv6, TCP, and UDP, are transmitted in big-endian order. For this reason, big-endian byte order is also referred to as network byte order.   34.3 More information on Typed Arrays  379    Little-endian storage is popular for microprocessors in part due to signiﬁcant his-  torical inﬂuence on microprocessor designs by Intel Corporation.  Other orderings are also possible. Those are generically called middle-endian or mixed- endian.  34.3 More information on Typed Arrays In this section, «ElementType»Array stands for Int8Array, Uint8Array, etc. ElementType is Int8, Uint8, etc.  34.3.1 The static method «ElementType»Array.from   This method has the type signature:  .from    source: Iterable ArrayLike , mapfn?: S => ElementType, thisArg?: any  : «ElementType»Array  .from   converts source into an instance of this  a Typed Array . For example, normal Arrays are iterable and can be converted with this method:  assert.deepEqual   Uint16Array.from [0, 1, 2] , Uint16Array.of 0, 1, 2  ;  Typed Arrays are also iterable:  assert.deepEqual   Uint16Array.from Uint8Array.of 0, 1, 2  , Uint16Array.of 0, 1, 2  ;  source can also be an Array-like object:  assert.deepEqual   Uint16Array.from {0:0, 1:1, 2:2, length: 3} , Uint16Array.of 0, 1, 2  ;  The optional mapfn lets you transform the elements of source before they become ele- ments of the result. Why perform the two steps mapping and conversion in one go? Com- pared to mapping separately via .map  , there are two advantages:  1. No intermediate Array or Typed Array is needed. 2. When converting between Typed Arrays with different precisions, less can go  wrong.  Read on for an explanation of the second advantage.  34.3.1.1 Pitfall: mapping while converting between Typed Array types The static method .from   can optionally both map and convert between Typed Array types. Less can go wrong if you use that method.   380  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   To see why that is, let us ﬁrst convert a Typed Array to a Typed Array with a higher precision. If we use .from   to map, the result is automatically correct. Otherwise, you must ﬁrst convert and then map.  const typedArray = Int8Array.of 127, 126, 125 ; assert.deepEqual   Int16Array.from typedArray, x => x * 2 , Int16Array.of 254, 252, 250  ;  assert.deepEqual   Int16Array.from typedArray .map x => x * 2 , Int16Array.of 254, 252, 250  ;    OK  assert.deepEqual   Int16Array.from typedArray.map x => x * 2  , Int16Array.of -2, -4, -6  ;    wrong  If we go from a Typed Array to a Typed Array with a lower precision, mapping via .from   produces the correct result. Otherwise, we must ﬁrst map and then convert.  assert.deepEqual   Int8Array.from Int16Array.of 254, 252, 250 , x => x   2 , Int8Array.of 127, 126, 125  ;  assert.deepEqual   assert.deepEqual   Int8Array.from Int16Array.of 254, 252, 250 .map x => x   2  , Int8Array.of 127, 126, 125  ;    OK  Int8Array.from Int16Array.of 254, 252, 250  .map x => x   2 , Int8Array.of -1, -2, -3  ;    wrong  The problem is that if we map via .map  , then input type and output type are the same. In contrast, .from   goes from an arbitrary input type to an output type that you specify via its receiver.  34.3.2 Typed Arrays are iterable Typed Arrays are iterable. That means that you can use the for-of loop and other iteration-based mechanisms:  const ui8 = Uint8Array.of 0, 1, 2 ; for  const byte of ui8  {  console.log byte ;  }    Output:    0    1    2  ArrayBuffers and DataViews are not iterable.   34.3 More information on Typed Arrays  381  34.3.3 Typed Arrays vs. normal Arrays Typed Arrays are much like normal Arrays: they have a .length, elements can be ac- cessed via the bracket operator [], and they have most of the standard Array methods. They differ from normal Arrays in the following ways:    Typed Arrays have buffers. The elements of a Typed Array ta are not stored in ta, they are stored in an associated ArrayBuffer that can be accessed via ta.buffer:  const ta = new Uint16Array 2 ;    2 elements assert.deepEqual   ta.buffer, new ArrayBuffer 4  ;    4 bytes    Typed Arrays are initialized with zeros:  – new Array 4  creates a normal Array without any elements. It only has four  holes  indices less than the .length that have no associated elements .  – new Uint8Array 4  creates a Typed Array whose four elements are all 0.  assert.deepEqual new Uint8Array 4 , Uint8Array.of 0, 0, 0, 0  ;    All of the elements of a Typed Array have the same type:  – Setting elements converts values to that type.  const ta = new Uint8Array 1 ;  ta[0] = 257; assert.equal ta[0], 1 ;    257 % 256  overflow   ta[0] = '2'; assert.equal ta[0], 2 ;  – Getting elements returns numbers or bigints.  const ta = new Uint8Array 1 ; assert.equal ta[0], 0 ; assert.equal typeof ta[0], 'number' ;    The .length of a Typed Array is derived from its ArrayBuffer and never changes   unless you switch to a different ArrayBuffer .    Normal Arrays can have holes; Typed Arrays can’t.  34.3.4 Converting Typed Arrays to and from normal Arrays To convert a normal Array to a Typed Array, you pass it to a Typed Array constructor  which accepts Array-like objects and Typed Arrays  or to «ElementType»Array.from    which accepts iterables and Array-like objects . For example:  const ta1 = new Uint8Array [0, 1, 2] ; const ta2 = Uint8Array.from [0, 1, 2] ; assert.deepEqual ta1, ta2 ;   382  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   To convert a Typed Array to a normal Array, you can use spreading or Array.from    because Typed Arrays are iterable :  assert.deepEqual   assert.deepEqual   [...Uint8Array.of 0, 1, 2 ], [0, 1, 2]  ;  Array.from Uint8Array.of 0, 1, 2  , [0, 1, 2]  ;  34.3.5 Concatenating Typed Arrays Typed Arrays don’t have a method .concat  , like normal Arrays do. The workaround is to use their overloaded method .set  :  .set typedArray: TypedArray, offset=0 : void .set arrayLike: ArrayLike , offset=0 : void  It copies the existing typedArray or arrayLike into the receiver, at index offset. Type- dArray is a ﬁctitious abstract superclass of all concrete Typed Array classes. The following function uses that method to copy zero or more Typed Arrays  or Array- like objects  into an instance of resultConstructor:  function concatenate resultConstructor, ...arrays  {  let totalLength = 0; for  const arr of arrays  { totalLength += arr.length;  } const result = new resultConstructor totalLength ; let offset = 0; for  const arr of arrays  { result.set arr, offset ; offset += arr.length;  } return result;  } assert.deepEqual   concatenate Uint8Array, Uint8Array.of 1, 2 , [3, 4] , Uint8Array.of 1, 2, 3, 4  ;  34.4 Quick references: indices vs. offsets In preparation for the quick references on ArrayBuffers, Typed Arrays, and DataViews, we need learn the differences between indices and offsets:    Indices for the bracket operator [ ]: You can only use non-negative indices  start-  ing at 0 . In normal Arrays, writing to negative indices creates properties:  const arr = [6, 7]; arr[-1] = 5;   34.5 Quick reference: ArrayBuffers  383  assert.deepEqual   Object.keys arr , ['0', '1', '-1'] ;  In Typed Arrays, writing to negative indices is ignored:  const tarr = Uint8Array.of 6, 7 ; tarr[-1] = 5; assert.deepEqual   Object.keys tarr , ['0', '1'] ;    Indices for methods of ArrayBuffers, Typed Arrays, and DataViews: Every index can be negative. If it is, it is added to the length of the entity to produce the actual index. Therefore, -1 refers to the last element, -2 to the second-last, etc. Methods of normal Arrays work the same way.  const ui8 = Uint8Array.of 0, 1, 2 ; assert.deepEqual ui8.slice -1 , Uint8Array.of 2  ;    Offsets passed to methods of Typed Arrays and DataViews: must be non-negative  – for example:  const dataView = new DataView new ArrayBuffer 4  ; assert.throws      => dataView.getUint8 -1 , {  name: 'RangeError', message: 'Offset is outside the bounds of the DataView',  } ;  Whether a parameter is an index or an offset can only be determined by looking at doc- umentation; there is no simple rule.  34.5 Quick reference: ArrayBuffers ArrayBuffers store binary data, which is meant to be accessed via Typed Arrays and DataViews.  34.5.1 new ArrayBuffer   The type signature of the constructor is: new ArrayBuffer length: number   Invoking this constructor via new creates an instance whose capacity is length bytes. Each of those bytes is initially 0. You can’t change the length of an ArrayBuffer; you can only create a new one with a different length.  34.5.2 Static methods of ArrayBuffer    ArrayBuffer.isView arg: any    384  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   Returns true if arg is an object and a view for an ArrayBuffer  i.e., if it is a Typed Array or a DataView .  34.5.3 Properties of ArrayBuffer.prototype    get .byteLength  : number  Returns the capacity of this ArrayBuffer in bytes.    .slice startIndex: number, endIndex=this.byteLength   Creates a new ArrayBuffer that contains the bytes of this ArrayBuffer whose in- dices are greater than or equal to startIndex and less than endIndex. start and endIndex can be negative  see §34.4 “Quick references: indices vs. offsets” .  34.6 Quick reference: Typed Arrays The properties of the various Typed Array objects are introduced in two steps:  1. TypedArray: First, we look at the abstract superclass of all Typed Array classes  which was shown in the class diagram at the beginning of this chapter . I’m call- ing that superclass TypedArray, but it is not directly accessible from JavaScript. TypedArray.prototype houses all methods of Typed Arrays.  2. «ElementType»Array: The concrete Typed Array classes are called Uint8Array, Int16Array, Float32Array, etc. These are the classes that you use via new, .of, and .from  .  34.6.1 Static methods of TypedArray  Both static TypedArray methods are inherited by its subclasses  Uint8Array, etc. . Type- dArray is abstract. Therefore, you always use these methods via the subclasses, which are concrete and can have direct instances.    .from  source: Iterable ArrayLike , mapfn?: S => T, thisArg?:  any  : instanceof this Converts an iterable  including Arrays and Typed Arrays  or an Array-like object to an instance of this  instanceof this is my invention to express that fact .  assert.deepEqual   Uint16Array.from [0, 1, 2] , Uint16Array.of 0, 1, 2  ;  The optional mapfn lets you transform the elements of source before they become elements of the result.  assert.deepEqual   Int16Array.from Int8Array.of 127, 126, 125 , x => x * 2 , Int16Array.of 254, 252, 250  ;    .of ...items: bigint[] : instanceof this  BigInt64Array, BigUint64Array    34.6 Quick reference: Typed Arrays  385    .of ...items: number[] : instanceof this  all other Typed Arrays   Creates a new instance of this whose elements are items  coerced to the element type .  assert.deepEqual   Int16Array.of -1234, 5, 67 , new Int16Array [-1234, 5, 67]   ;  34.6.2 Properties of TypedArray .prototype Indices accepted by Typed Array methods can be negative  they work like traditional Array methods that way . Offsets must be non-negative. For details, see §34.4 “Quick references: indices vs. offsets”.  34.6.2.1 Properties speciﬁc to Typed Arrays The following properties are speciﬁc to Typed Arrays; normal Arrays don’t have them:    get .buffer  : ArrayBuffer  Returns the buffer backing this Typed Array.    get .length  : number  Returns the length in elements of this Typed Array’s buffer.    get .byteLength  : number  Returns the size in bytes of this Typed Array’s buffer.    get .byteOffset  : number  Returns the offset where this Typed Array “starts” inside its ArrayBuffer.    .set typedArray: TypedArray, offset=0 : void   .set arrayLike: ArrayLike , offset=0 : void  BigInt64Array, BigU-  int64Array     .set arrayLike: ArrayLike , offset=0 : void  all other Typed Ar-  rays  Copies all elements of the ﬁrst parameter to this Typed Array. The element at index 0 of the parameter is written to index offset of this Typed Array  etc. . For more information on Array-like objects, consult §33.4 “Array-like objects”.   .subarray startIndex=0, endIndex=this.length : TypedArray   Returns a new Typed Array that has the same buffer as this Typed Array, but a  generally  smaller range. If startIndex is non-negative then the ﬁrst element of the resulting Typed Array is this[startIndex], the second this[startIndex+1]  etc. . If startIndex in negative, it is converted appropriately.   386  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   34.6.2.2 Array methods The following methods are basically the same as the methods of normal Arrays:    .copyWithin target: number, start: number, end=this.length : this [W, ES6]   .entries  : Iterable  [R, ES6]   .every callback:  value: T, index: number, array: TypedArray   =>  boolean, thisArg?: any : boolean [R, ES6]    .fill value: T, start=0, end=this.length : this [W, ES6]   .filter callback:  value: T, index: number, array: TypedArray   =>    .find predicate:  value: T, index: number, obj: T[]  => boolean, this-    .findIndex predicate:  value: T, index: number, obj: T[]  => boolean,    .forEach callback:  value: T, index: number, array: TypedArray   =>  any, thisArg?: any : T[] [R, ES6]  Arg?: any : T  undefined [R, ES6]  thisArg?: any : number [R, ES6]  void, thisArg?: any : void [R, ES6]    .includes searchElement: T, fromIndex=0 : boolean [R, ES2016]   .indexOf searchElement: T, fromIndex=0 : number [R, ES6]   .join separator = ',' : string [R, ES6]   .keys  : Iterable  [R, ES6]   .lastIndexOf searchElement: T, fromIndex=this.length-1 : number [R, ES6]   .map  mapFunc:  value: T, index: number, array: TypedArray   => U,    .reduce  callback:  accumulator: U, element: T, index: number, array:  thisArg?: any : U[] [R, ES6]  T[]  => U, init?: U : U [R, ES6]    .reduceRight  callback:  accumulator: U, element: T, index: number,  array: T[]  => U, init?: U : U [R, ES6]    .reverse  : this [W, ES6]   .slice start=0, end=this.length : T[] [R, ES6]   .some callback:  value: T, index: number, array: TypedArray   =>  boolean, thisArg?: any : boolean [R, ES6]    .sort compareFunc?:  a: T, b: T  => number : this [W, ES6]   .toString  : string [R, ES6]   .values  : Iterable  [R, ES6]  For details on how these methods work, please consult §33.12.3 “Methods of Ar- ray .prototype”.  34.6.3 new «ElementType»Array   Each Typed Array constructor has a name that follows the pattern «ElementType»Array, where «ElementType» is one of the element types in the table at the beginning. That means that there are 11 constructors for Typed Arrays:    Float32Array, Float64Array   Int8Array, Int16Array, Int32Array, BigInt64Array   Uint8Array, Uint8ClampedArray, Uint16Array, Uint32Array, BigUint64Array  Each constructor has four overloaded versions – it behaves differently depending on how many arguments it receives and what their types are:   34.7 Quick reference: DataViews  387    new «ElementType»Array buffer: ArrayBuffer, byteOffset=0, length=0   Creates a new «ElementType»Array whose buffer is buffer. It starts accessing the buffer at the given byteOffset and will have the given length. Note that length counts elements of the Typed Array  with 1–8 bytes each , not bytes.    new «ElementType»Array length=0   Creates a new «ElementType»Array with the given length and the appropriate buffer. The buffer’s size in bytes is:  length * «ElementType»Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT    new «ElementType»Array source: TypedArray   Creates a new instance of «ElementType»Array whose elements have the same values as the elements of source, but coerced to ElementType.    new «ElementType»Array source: ArrayLike    BigInt64Array, BigU-  int64Array     new «ElementType»Array source: ArrayLike    all other Typed Arrays  Creates a new instance of «ElementType»Array whose elements have the same val- ues as the elements of source, but coerced to ElementType. For more information on Array-like objects, consult §33.4 “Array-like objects”.  34.6.4 Static properties of «ElementType»Array   «ElementType»Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT: number  Counts how many bytes are needed to store a single element:  > Uint8Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT 1 > Int16Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT 2 > Float64Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT 8  34.6.5 Properties of «ElementType»Array.prototype    .BYTES_PER_ELEMENT: number  The same as «ElementType»Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT.  34.7 Quick reference: DataViews 34.7.1 new DataView      new DataView buffer: ArrayBuffer, byteOffset=0, byteLength=buffer.byteLength-  byteOffset    388  34 Typed Arrays: handling binary data  advanced   Creates a new DataView whose data is stored in the ArrayBuffer buffer. By de- fault, the new DataView can access all of buffer. The last two parameters allow you to change that.  34.7.2 Properties of DataView.prototype In the remainder of this section, «ElementType» refers to either:    Int8, Int16, Int32, BigInt64   Uint8, Uint16, Uint32, BigUint64   Float32, Float64  These are the properties of DataView.prototype:    get .buffer  : ArrayBuffer  Returns the ArrayBuffer of this DataView.    get .byteLength  : number  Returns how many bytes can be accessed by this DataView.    get .byteOffset  : number  Returns at which offset this DataView starts accessing the bytes in its buffer.    .get«ElementType» byteOffset:   BigInt64, BigUint64   number,  littleEndian=false :  bigint    .get«ElementType» byteOffset: number, littleEndian=false : number  all  other element types  Reads a value from the buffer of this DataView. number,    .set«ElementType» byteOffset:  dian=false : void  BigInt64, BigUint64     .set«ElementType» byteOffset:  number, dian=false : void  all other element types  Writes value to the buffer of this DataView.  value:  bigint,  littleEn-  value:  number,  littleEn-   Chapter 35  Maps  Map   Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  35.1 Using Maps .  35.4 Missing Map operations .  . . . . . . . 35.1.1 Creating Maps . . 35.1.2 Copying Maps . 35.1.3 Working with single entries . . 35.1.4 Determining the size of a Map and clearing it . . . 35.1.5 Getting the keys and values of a Map . 35.1.6 Getting the entries of a Map . . . . . 35.1.7 Listed in insertion order: entries, keys, values 35.1.8 Converting between Maps and Objects . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35.2 Example: Counting characters . . . 35.3 A few more details about the keys of Maps  advanced  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35.6.1 When should I use a Map, and when should I use an object? . . 35.6.2 When would I use an object as a key in a Map? . . . 35.6.3 Why do Maps preserve the insertion order of entries? . . . 35.6.4 Why do Maps have a .size, while Arrays have a .length? .  . . . . . . . . . . . . 35.5.1 Constructor . 35.5.2 Map .prototype: handling single entries . 35.5.3 Map .prototype: handling all entries . . 35.5.4 Map .prototype: iterating and looping . . . 35.5.5 Sources of this section . . . . .  35.3.1 What keys are considered equal? . . . . .  . . 35.4.1 Mapping and ﬁltering Maps . . . 35.4.2 Combining Maps . . . . 35.5 Quick reference: Map  . . . . .  35.6 FAQ: Maps .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 390 . 390 . 390 . 390 . 391 . 391 . 391 . 392 . 392 . 393 . 393 . 394 . 394 . 394 . 395 . 396 . 396 . 396 . 397 . 397 . 398 . 399 . 399 . 399 . 399 . 399  Before ES6, JavaScript didn’t have a data structure for dictionaries and  ab used objects as dictionaries from strings to arbitrary values. ES6 brought Maps, which are dictionaries from arbitrary values to arbitrary values.  389   390 35.1 Using Maps An instance of Map maps keys to values. A single key-value mapping is called an entry.  35 Maps  Map   35.1.1 Creating Maps There are three common ways of creating Maps. First, you can use the constructor without any parameters to create an empty Map:  const emptyMap = new Map  ; assert.equal emptyMap.size, 0 ;  Second, you can pass an iterable  e.g., an Array  over key-value “pairs”  Arrays with two elements  to the constructor: const map = new Map [  [1, 'one'], [2, 'two'], [3, 'three'],    trailing comma is ignored  ] ;  Third, the .set   method adds entries to a Map and is chainable:  const map = new Map    .set 1, 'one'  .set 2, 'two'  .set 3, 'three' ;  35.1.2 Copying Maps As we’ll see later, Maps are also iterables over key-value pairs. Therefore, you can use the constructor to create a copy of a Map. That copy is shallow: keys and values are the same; they are not duplicated.  const original = new Map    .set false, 'no'  .set true, 'yes' ;  const copy = new Map original ; assert.deepEqual original, copy ;  const map = new Map  ;  map.set 'foo', 123 ;  assert.equal map.get 'foo' , 123 ;    Unknown key:  35.1.3 Working with single entries .set   and .get   are for writing and reading values  given keys .   35.1 Using Maps  391  assert.equal map.get 'bar' , undefined ;    Use the default value '' if an entry is missing: assert.equal map.get 'bar'  ?? '', '' ;  .has   checks if a Map has an entry with a given key. .delete   removes entries.  const map = new Map [['foo', 123]] ;  assert.equal map.has 'foo' , true ; assert.equal map.delete 'foo' , true  assert.equal map.has 'foo' , false   35.1.4 Determining the size of a Map and clearing it .size contains the number of entries in a Map. .clear   removes all entries of a Map.  35.1.5 Getting the keys and values of a Map .keys   returns an iterable over the keys of a Map:  ;  ;  const map = new Map    .set 'foo', true  .set 'bar', false   assert.equal map.size, 2  map.clear  ; assert.equal map.size, 0   const map = new Map    .set false, 'no'  .set true, 'yes'   for  const key of map.keys    {  console.log key ;  }    Output:    false    true  assert.deepEqual  [...map.keys  ], [false, true] ;  .values   works like .keys  , but for values instead of keys.  35.1.6 Getting the entries of a Map .entries   returns an iterable over the entries of a Map:  We can use spreading  ...  to convert the iterable returned by .keys   to an Array:   35 Maps  Map   392  const map = new Map    .set false, 'no'  .set true, 'yes'   ;  for  const entry of map.entries    {  console.log entry ;  }    Output:    [false, 'no']    [true, 'yes']  assert.deepEqual   [...map.entries  ], [[false, 'no'], [true, 'yes']] ;  for  const [key, value] of map  {  console.log key, value ;  }    Output:    false, 'no'    true, 'yes'  [...map1.keys  ], ['a', 'b'] ;  const map1 = new Map [  ['a', 1], ['b', 2],  ] ; assert.deepEqual   const map2 = new Map [  ['b', 2], ['a', 1],  ] ; assert.deepEqual   [...map2.keys  ], ['b', 'a'] ;  Spreading  ...  converts the iterable returned by .entries   to an Array:  Map instances are also iterables over entries. In the following code, we use destructuring to access the keys and values of map:  35.1.7 Listed in insertion order: entries, keys, values Maps record in which order entries were created and honor that order when listing en- tries, keys, or values:  35.1.8 Converting between Maps and Objects As long as a Map only uses strings and symbols as keys, you can convert it to an object  via Object.fromEntries   :   35.2 Example: Counting characters  393  You can also convert an object to a Map with string or symbol keys  via Ob- ject.entries   :  const map = new Map [  ['a', 1], ['b', 2],  ] ; const obj = Object.fromEntries map ; assert.deepEqual   obj, {a: 1, b: 2} ;  const obj = {  a: 1, b: 2,  }; const map = new Map Object.entries obj  ; assert.deepEqual   map, new Map [['a', 1], ['b', 2]]  ;  35.2 Example: Counting characters countChars   returns a Map that maps characters to numbers of occurrences.  function countChars chars  {  const charCounts = new Map  ; for  let ch of chars  { ch = ch.toLowerCase  ; const prevCount = charCounts.get ch  ?? 0; charCounts.set ch, prevCount+1 ;  } return charCounts;  }  const result = countChars 'AaBccc' ; assert.deepEqual   [...result], [  ['a', 2], ['b', 1], ['c', 3],  ]   ;  vanced   35.3 A few more details about the keys of Maps  ad-  Any value can be a key, even an object:   394  35 Maps  Map   const map = new Map  ;  const KEY1 = {}; const KEY2 = {};  map.set KEY1, 'hello' ; map.set KEY2, 'world' ;  assert.equal map.get KEY1 , 'hello' ; assert.equal map.get KEY2 , 'world' ;  35.3.1 What keys are considered equal? Most Map operations need to check whether a value is equal to one of the keys. They do so via the internal operation SameValueZero, which works like === but considers NaN to be equal to itself. As a consequence, you can use NaN as a key in Maps, just like any other value:  > const map = new Map  ;  > map.set NaN, 123 ; > map.get NaN  123  Different objects are always considered to be different. That is something that can’t be changed  yet – conﬁguring key equality is on TC39’s long-term roadmap .  > new Map  .set {}, 1 .set {}, 2 .size 2  35.4 Missing Map operations 35.4.1 Mapping and ﬁltering Maps You can .map   and .filter   an Array, but there are no such operations for a Map. The solution is:  1. Convert the Map into an Array of [key, value] pairs. 2. Map or ﬁlter the Array. 3. Convert the result back to a Map.  I’ll use the following Map to demonstrate how that works.  const originalMap = new Map   .set 1, 'a'  .set 2, 'b'  .set 3, 'c' ;  Mapping originalMap:   35.4 Missing Map operations  395  const mappedMap = new Map     step 3  [...originalMap]    step 1 .map  [k, v]  => [k * 2, '_' + v]     step 2   ; assert.deepEqual [...mappedMap],  [[2,'_a'], [4,'_b'], [6,'_c']] ;  Filtering originalMap:  const filteredMap = new Map     step 3  [...originalMap]    step 1 .filter  [k, v]  => k < 3     step 2   ; assert.deepEqual [...filteredMap],  [[1,'a'], [2,'b']] ;  Step 1 is performed by spreading  ...  in the Array literal.  35.4.2 Combining Maps There are no methods for combining Maps, which is why we must use a workaround that is similar to the one from the previous section. Let’s combine the following two Maps:  const map1 = new Map    .set 1, '1a'  .set 2, '1b'  .set 3, '1c'   const map2 = new Map    .set 2, '2b'  .set 3, '2c'  .set 4, '2d'   ;  ;   ;  To combine map1 and map2, we turn them into Arrays via spreading  ...  and concatenate those Arrays. Afterward, we convert the result back to a Map. All of that is done in line A.  const combinedMap = new Map [...map1, ...map2] ;     A  assert.deepEqual   [...combinedMap],    convert to Array for comparison [ [ 1, '1a' ], [ 2, '2b' ], [ 3, '2c' ], [ 4, '2d' ] ]   396  35 Maps  Map   Exercise: Combining two Maps  exercises maps combine_maps_test.mjs  35.5 Quick reference: Map  Note: For the sake of conciseness, I’m pretending that all keys have the same type K and that all values have the same type V.  35.5.1 Constructor    new Map  entries?: Iterable   [ES6]  If you don’t provide the parameter entries, then an empty Map is created. If you do provide an iterable over [key, value] pairs, then those pairs are added as entries to the Map. For example:  const map = new Map [  [ 1, 'one' ], [ 2, 'two' ], [ 3, 'three' ],    trailing comma is ignored  ] ;  35.5.2 Map .prototype: handling single entries    .get key: K : V [ES6]  Returns the value that key is mapped to in this Map. If there is no key key in this Map, undefined is returned.  const map = new Map [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']] ; assert.equal map.get 1 , 'one' ; assert.equal map.get 5 , undefined ;    .set key: K, value: V : this [ES6]  Maps the given key to the given value. If there is already an entry whose key is key, it is updated. Otherwise, a new entry is created. This method returns this, which means that you can chain it.  const map = new Map [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']] ; map.set 1, 'ONE!'   .set 3, 'THREE!' ;  assert.deepEqual   [...map.entries  ], [[1, 'ONE!'], [2, 'two'], [3, 'THREE!']] ;    .has key: K : boolean [ES6]  Returns whether the given key exists in this Map.   35.5 Quick reference: Map   397  const map = new Map [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']] ; assert.equal map.has 1 , true ;    key exists assert.equal map.has 5 , false ;    key does not exist    .delete key: K : boolean [ES6]  If there is an entry whose key is key, it is removed and true is returned. Otherwise, nothing happens and false is returned.  const map = new Map [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']] ; assert.equal map.delete 1 , true ; assert.equal map.delete 5 , false ;    nothing happens assert.deepEqual   [...map.entries  ], [[2, 'two']] ;  35.5.3 Map .prototype: handling all entries    get .size: number [ES6]  Returns how many entries this Map has.  const map = new Map [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']] ; assert.equal map.size, 2 ;    .clear  : void [ES6]  Removes all entries from this Map.  const map = new Map [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']] ; assert.equal map.size, 2 ; map.clear  ; assert.equal map.size, 0 ;  35.5.4 Map .prototype: iterating and looping Both iterating and looping happen in the order in which entries were added to a Map.    .entries  : Iterable  [ES6]  Returns an iterable with one [key, value] pair for each entry in this Map. The pairs are Arrays of length 2.  const map = new Map [[1, 'one'], [2, 'two']] ; for  const entry of map.entries    {  console.log entry ;  }    Output:    [1, 'one']    [2, 'two']    .forEach callback:  value: V, key: K, theMap: Map   => void, this-  Arg?: any : void [ES6]   398  35 Maps  Map   The ﬁrst parameter is a callback that is invoked once for each entry in this Map.

If you need a dictionary-like data structure with keys that are neither strings nor symbols, you have no choice: you must use a Map. If, however, your keys are either strings or symbols, you must decide whether or not to use an object. A rough general guideline is:  399    Is there a ﬁxed set of keys  known at development time ?  Then use an object obj and access the values via ﬁxed keys:  const value = obj.key;    Can the set of keys change at runtime?  Then use a Map map and access the values via keys stored in variables:  const theKey = 123; map.get theKey ;  35.6.2 When would I use an object as a key in a Map? You normally want Map keys to be compared by value  two keys are considered equal if they have the same content . That excludes objects. However, there is one use case for objects as keys: externally attaching data to objects. But that use case is served better by WeakMaps, where entries don’t prevent keys from being garbage-collected  for details, consult the next chapter .  35.6.3 Why do Maps preserve the insertion order of entries? In principle, Maps are unordered. The main reason for ordering entries is so that oper- ations that list entries, keys, or values are deterministic. That helps, for example, with testing.  35.6.4 Why do Maps have a .size, while Arrays have a .length? In JavaScript, indexable sequences  such as Arrays and strings  have a .length, while unindexed collections  such as Maps and Sets  have a .size:    .length is based on indices; it is always the highest index plus one.   .size counts the number of elements in a collection.

The keys of a WeakMap are weakly held: if an object is a key in a WeakMap, it can  still be garbage-collected. That lets us use WeakMaps to attach data to objects.  The next two sections examine in more detail what that means.  36.1 WeakMaps are black boxes It is impossible to inspect what’s inside a WeakMap:    For example, you can’t iterate or loop over keys, values or entries. And you can’t    Additionally, you can’t clear a WeakMap either – you have to create a fresh in-  compute the size.  stance.  These restrictions enable a security property. Quoting Mark Miller:  The mapping from weakmap key pair value can only be observed or af- fected by someone who has both the weakmap and the key. With clear  ,  401   402  36 WeakMaps  WeakMap   advanced   someone with only the WeakMap would’ve been able to affect the WeakMap- and-key-to-value mapping.  36.2 The keys of a WeakMap are weakly held The keys of a WeakMap are said to be weakly held: Normally if one object refers to another one, then the latter object can’t be garbage-collected as long as the former exists. With a WeakMap, that is different: If an object is a key and not referred to elsewhere, it can be garbage-collected while the WeakMap still exists. That also leads to the corresponding entry being removed  but there is no way to observe that .  36.2.1 All WeakMap keys must be objects All WeakMap keys must be objects. You get an error if you use a primitive value:  > const wm = new WeakMap  ; > wm.set 123, 'test'  TypeError: Invalid value used as weak map key  With primitive values as keys, WeakMaps wouldn’t be black boxes anymore. But given that primitive values are never garbage-collected, you don’t proﬁt from weakly held keys anyway, and can just as well use a normal Map.  36.2.2 Use case: attaching values to objects This is the main use case for WeakMaps: you can use them to externally attach values to objects – for example:  const wm = new WeakMap  ; {  const obj = {}; wm.set obj, 'attachedValue' ;     A   }     B   In line A, we attach a value to obj. In line B, obj can already be garbage-collected, even though wm still exists. This technique of attaching a value to an object is equivalent to a property of that object being stored externally. If wm were a property, the previous code would look as follows:  {  }  const obj = {}; obj.wm = 'attachedValue';   36.3 Examples 36.3 Examples 36.3.1 Caching computed results via WeakMaps With WeakMaps, you can associate previously computed results with objects without having to worry about memory management. The following function countOwnKeys   is an example: it caches previous results in the WeakMap cache.  403  If we use this function with an object obj, you can see that the result is only computed for the ﬁrst invocation, while a cached value is used for the second invocation:  36.3.2 Keeping private data in WeakMaps In the following code, the WeakMaps _counter and _action are used to store the values of virtual properties of instances of Countdown:  const cache = new WeakMap  ; function countOwnKeys obj  {  if  cache.has obj   {  return [cache.get obj , 'cached'];  } else {  const count = Object.keys obj .length; cache.set obj, count ; return [count, 'computed'];  }  }  > const obj = { foo: 1, bar: 2}; > countOwnKeys obj  [2, 'computed'] > countOwnKeys obj  [2, 'cached']  const _counter = new WeakMap  ; const _action = new WeakMap  ;  class Countdown {  constructor counter, action  { _counter.set this, counter ; _action.set this, action ;  } dec   {  let counter = _counter.get this ; counter--; _counter.set this, counter ; if  counter === 0  {  _action.get this   ;  }  }  }   404  36 WeakMaps  WeakMap   advanced      The two pseudo-properties are truly private: assert.deepEqual   Object.keys new Countdown   , [] ;  This is how Countdown is used:  let invoked = false;  const cd = new Countdown 3,    => invoked = true ;  cd.dec  ; assert.equal invoked, false ; cd.dec  ; assert.equal invoked, false ; cd.dec  ; assert.equal invoked, true ;  Exercise: WeakMaps for private data  exercises weakmaps weakmaps_private_data_test.mjs  36.4 WeakMap API The constructor and the four methods of WeakMap work the same as their Map equivalents:    new WeakMap  entries?: Iterable   [ES6]   .delete key: K  : boolean [ES6]   .get key: K  : V [ES6]   .has key: K  : boolean [ES6]   .set key: K, value: V  : this [ES6]  Quiz See quiz app.   Chapter 37  Sets  Set   Contents  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . . . . .  37.1 Using Sets .  37.2 Examples of using Sets  . . . 37.1.1 Creating Sets . . 37.1.2 Adding, removing, checking membership . 37.1.3 Determining the size of a Set and clearing it 37.1.4 Iterating over Sets . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37.2.1 Removing duplicates from an Array . . . 37.2.2 Creating a set of Unicode characters  code points  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37.6.1 Why do Sets have a .size, while Arrays have a .length? .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37.5.1 Constructor . . . . 37.5.2 Set .prototype: single Set elements . 37.5.3 Set .prototype: all Set elements . . . . 37.5.4 Set .prototype: iterating and looping . . . 37.5.5 Symmetry with Map . . . . .  37.3 What Set elements are considered equal? . . . 37.4 Missing Set operations . . . 37.4.1 Union  a ∪ b  . . 37.4.2 Intersection  a ∩ b  . . . . 37.4.3 Difference  a \ b  . . 37.4.4 Mapping over Sets . . . 37.4.5 Filtering Sets . 37.5 Quick reference: Set  . . . . . . .  37.6 FAQ: Sets .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 406 . 406 . 406 . 406 . 407 . 407 . 407 . 407 . 407 . 408 . 408 . 408 . 409 . 409 . 409 . 409 . 409 . 409 . 410 . 410 . 411 . 411 . 411  Before ES6, JavaScript didn’t have a data structure for sets. Instead, two workarounds were used:    The keys of an object were used as a set of strings.  405   406  37 Sets  Set     Arrays were used as sets of arbitrary values. The downside is that checking mem-  bership  if an Array contains a value  is slower.  Since ES6, JavaScript has the data structure Set, which can contain arbitrary values and performs membership checks quickly.  37.1 Using Sets 37.1.1 Creating Sets There are three common ways of creating Sets. First, you can use the constructor without any parameters to create an empty Set:  const emptySet = new Set  ; assert.equal emptySet.size, 0 ;  Second, you can pass an iterable  e.g., an Array  to the constructor. The iterated values become elements of the new Set:  const set = new Set ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ;  Third, the .add   method adds elements to a Set and is chainable:  const set = new Set   .add 'red'  .add 'green'  .add 'blue' ;  37.1.2 Adding, removing, checking membership .add   adds an element to a Set.  const set = new Set  ; set.add 'red' ;  .has   checks if an element is a member of a Set.  assert.equal set.has 'red' , true ;  .delete   removes an element from a Set.  assert.equal set.delete 'red' , true ;    there was a deletion assert.equal set.has 'red' , false ;  37.1.3 Determining the size of a Set and clearing it .size contains the number of elements in a Set.  const set = new Set    .add 'foo'  .add 'bar' ;  assert.equal set.size, 2   .clear   removes all elements of a Set.   407  37.2 Examples of using Sets  set.clear  ; assert.equal set.size, 0   Iterating over Sets  37.1.4 Sets are iterable and the for-of loop works as you’d expect:  const set = new Set ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ; for  const x of set  {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'red'    'green'    'blue'  As you can see, Sets preserve insertion order. That is, elements are always iterated over in the order in which they were added. Given that Sets are iterable, you can use spreading  ...  to convert them to Arrays:  const set = new Set ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ; const arr = [...set];    ['red', 'green', 'blue']  37.2 Examples of using Sets 37.2.1 Removing duplicates from an Array Converting an Array to a Set and back, removes duplicates from the Array:  assert.deepEqual   [...new Set [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3] ], [1, 2, 3] ;  37.2.2 Creating a set of Unicode characters  code points  Strings are iterable and can therefore be used as parameters for new Set  :  assert.deepEqual  new Set 'abc' , new Set ['a', 'b', 'c']  ;  37.3 What Set elements are considered equal? As with Map keys, Set elements are compared similarly to ===, with the exception of NaN being equal to itself.  > const set = new Set [NaN, NaN, NaN] ; > set.size 1   37 Sets  Set   As with ===, two different objects are never considered equal  and there is no way to change that at the moment :  408  > set.has NaN  true  > const set = new Set  ;  > set.add {} ; > set.size 1  > set.add {} ; > set.size 2  37.4 Missing Set operations Sets are missing several common operations. Such an operation can usually be imple- mented by:    Converting the input Sets to Arrays by spreading into Array literals.   Performing the operation on Arrays.   Converting the result to a Set and returning it.  37.4.1 Union  a ∪ b  Computing the union of two Sets a and b means creating a Set that contains the elements of both a and b.  const a = new Set [1,2,3] ; const b = new Set [4,3,2] ;    Use spreading to concatenate two iterables const union = new Set [...a, ...b] ;  assert.deepEqual [...union], [1, 2, 3, 4] ;  Intersection  a ∩ b   37.4.2 Computing the intersection of two Sets a and b means creating a Set that contains those elements of a that are also in b.  const a = new Set [1,2,3] ; const b = new Set [4,3,2] ; const intersection = new Set   [...a].filter x => b.has x   ;  assert.deepEqual [...intersection], [2, 3] ;   37.5 Quick reference: Set   409  37.4.3 Difference  a \ b  Computing the difference between two Sets a and b means creating a Set that contains those elements of a that are not in b. This operation is also sometimes called minus  − .  const a = new Set [1,2,3] ; const b = new Set [4,3,2] ; const difference = new Set   [...a].filter x => !b.has x   ;  assert.deepEqual [...difference], [1] ;  37.4.4 Mapping over Sets Sets don’t have a method .map  . But we can borrow the one that Arrays have:  const set = new Set [1, 2, 3] ; const mappedSet = new Set [...set].map x => x * 2  ;     Convert mappedSet to an Array to check what’s inside it assert.deepEqual [...mappedSet], [2, 4, 6] ;  37.4.5 Filtering Sets We can’t directly .filter   Sets, so we need to use the corresponding Array method:  const set = new Set [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ; const filteredSet = new Set [...set].filter x =>  x % 2  === 0  ;  assert.deepEqual [...filteredSet], [2, 4] ;  37.5 Quick reference: Set  37.5.1 Constructor    new Set  values?: Iterable   [ES6]  If you don’t provide the parameter values, then an empty Set is created. If you do, then the iterated values are added as elements to the Set. For example:  const set = new Set ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ;  37.5.2 Set .prototype: single Set elements    .add value: T : this [ES6]  Adds value to this Set. This method returns this, which means that it can be chained.  const set = new Set ['red'] ; set.add 'green' .add 'blue' ; assert.deepEqual [...set], ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ;   410  37 Sets  Set     .delete value: T : boolean [ES6]  Removes value from this Set. Returns true if something was deleted and false, otherwise.  const set = new Set ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ; assert.equal set.delete 'red' , true ;    there was a deletion assert.deepEqual [...set], ['green', 'blue'] ;    .has value: T : boolean [ES6]  Checks whether value is in this Set.  const set = new Set ['red', 'green'] ; assert.equal set.has 'red' , true ; assert.equal set.has 'blue' , false ;  37.5.3 Set .prototype: all Set elements    get .size: number [ES6]  Returns how many elements there are in this Set.  const set = new Set ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ; assert.equal set.size, 3 ;    .clear  : void [ES6]  Removes all elements from this Set.  const set = new Set ['red', 'green', 'blue'] ; assert.equal set.size, 3 ; set.clear  ; assert.equal set.size, 0 ;  37.5.4 Set .prototype: iterating and looping    .values  : Iterable  [ES6]  Returns an iterable over all elements of this Set. const set = new Set ['red', 'green'] ; for  const x of set.values    {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'red'    'green'    [Symbol.iterator]  : Iterable  [ES6]  Default way of iterating over Sets. Same as .values  .  const set = new Set ['red', 'green'] ; for  const x of set  {  console.log x ;   37.6 FAQ: Sets  }    Output:    'red'    'green'  411    .forEach callback:  value: T, key: T, theSet: Set   => void, thisArg?:  any : void [ES6] Feeds each element of this Set to callback  . value and key both contain the current element. This redundancy was introduced so that this callback has the same type signature as the callback of Map.prototype.forEach  . You can specify the this of callback via thisArg. If you omit it, this is undefined.  const set = new Set ['red', 'green'] ; set.forEach x => console.log x  ;    Output:    'red'    'green'  37.5.5 Symmetry with Map The following two methods mainly exist so that Sets and Maps have similar interfaces. Each Set element is handled as if it were a Map entry whose key and value are both the element.    Set.prototype.entries  : Iterable  [ES6]   Set.prototype.keys  : Iterable  [ES6] .entries   enables you to convert a Set to a Map:  const set = new Set ['a', 'b', 'c'] ; const map = new Map set.entries   ; assert.deepEqual   [...map.entries  ], [['a','a'], ['b','b'], ['c','c']] ;  37.6 FAQ: Sets 37.6.1 Why do Sets have a .size, while Arrays have a .length?

Given that we can’t iterate over their elements, there are not that many use cases for WeakSets. They do enable us to mark objects.  38.1 Example: Marking objects as safe to use with a  method  The following code demonstrates how a class can ensure that its methods are only ap- plied to instances that were created by it  based on code by Domenic Denicola :  const instancesOfSafeClass = new WeakSet  ;  instancesOfSafeClass.add this ;  class SafeClass { constructor   {  }  method   {  if  !instancesOfSafeClass.has this   {  413   throw new TypeError 'Incompatible object!' ;  38 WeakSets  WeakSet   advanced   const safeInstance = new SafeClass  ; safeInstance.method  ;    works  const obj = {}; SafeClass.prototype.method.call obj ;    throws an exception  414  }  }  }  assert.throws      => {  }, TypeError   ;  38.2 WeakSet API The constructor and the three methods of WeakSet work the same as their Set equiva- lents:    new WeakSet  values?: Iterable   [ES6]   .add value: T : this [ES6]   .delete value: T : boolean [ES6]   .has value: T : boolean [ES6]   Chapter 39  Destructuring  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  39.5 Array-destructuring .  . . 39.6 Examples of destructuring .  39.1 A ﬁrst taste of destructuring . 39.2 Constructing vs. extracting . . 39.3 Where can we destructure? 39.4 Object-destructuring . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39.4.1 Property value shorthands . 39.4.2 Rest properties . . . . 39.4.3 Syntax pitfall: assigning via object destructuring . . . . . 39.5.1 Array-destructuring works with any iterable . . . . . 39.5.2 Rest elements . . . . . . . 39.6.1 Array-destructuring: swapping variable values . 39.6.2 Array-destructuring: operations that return Arrays 39.6.3 Object-destructuring: multiple return values . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39.7 What happens if a pattern part does not match anything? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . 39.8.1 You can’t object-destructure undefined and null . 39.8.2 You can’t Array-destructure non-iterable values . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . 39.11Parameter deﬁnitions are similar to destructuring . 39.12Nested destructuring . . .  . . . . 39.10.1 Default values in Array-destructuring . 39.10.2 Default values in object-destructuring .  39.7.1 Object-destructuring and missing properties . . 39.7.2 Array-destructuring and missing elements . . . .  39.8 What values can’t be destructured? .  39.9  Advanced  . 39.10Default values  . . . .  . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 416 . 416 . 417 . 418 . 418 . 419 . 419 . 419 . 420 . 420 . 420 . 420 . 421 . 421 . 422 . 422 . 422 . 422 . 422 . 423 . 423 . 423 . 423 . 424 . 424 . 424  415   416 39.1 A ﬁrst taste of destructuring With normal assignment, you extract one piece of data at a time – for example:  39 Destructuring  With destructuring, you can extract multiple pieces of data at the same time via patterns in locations that receive data. The left-hand side of = in the previous code is one such location. In the following code, the square brackets in line A are a destructuring pattern:  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; const x = arr[0];    extract const y = arr[1];    extract  const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']; const [x, y] = arr;     A  assert.equal x, 'a' ; assert.equal y, 'b' ;  This code does the same as the previous code. Note that the pattern is “smaller” than the data: we are only extracting what we need.  39.2 Constructing vs. extracting In order to understand what destructuring is, consider that JavaScript has two kinds of operations that are opposites:    You can construct compound data, for example, by setting properties and via object  literals.    You can extract data out of compound data, for example, by getting properties.  Constructing data looks as follows:     Constructing: one property at a time const jane1 = {}; jane1.first = 'Jane'; jane1.last = 'Doe';     Constructing: multiple properties const jane2 = { first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',  };  assert.deepEqual jane1, jane2 ;  Extracting data looks as follows:  const jane = {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',  };   39.3 Where can we destructure?  417     Extracting: one property at a time const f1 = jane.first; const l1 = jane.last; assert.equal f1, 'Jane' ; assert.equal l1, 'Doe' ;     Extracting: multiple properties  NEW!  const {first: f2, last: l2} = jane;     A  assert.equal f2, 'Jane' ; assert.equal l2, 'Doe' ;  The operation in line A is new: we declare two variables f2 and l2 and initialize them via destructuring  multivalue extraction . The following part of line A is a destructuring pattern:  {first: f2, last: l2}  Destructuring patterns are syntactically similar to the literals that are used for multivalue construction. But they appear where data is received  e.g., at the left-hand sides of as- signments , not where data is created  e.g., at the right-hand sides of assignments .  39.3 Where can we destructure? Destructuring patterns can be used at “data sink locations” such as:    Variable declarations:  const [a] = ['x']; assert.equal a, 'x' ;  let [b] = ['y']; assert.equal b, 'y' ;    Assignments:  let b; [b] = ['z']; assert.equal b, 'z' ;    Parameter deﬁnitions:  const f =  [x]  => x; assert.equal f ['a'] , 'a' ;  Note that variable declarations include const and let declarations in for-of loops:  const arr = ['a', 'b']; for  const [index, element] of arr.entries    {  console.log index, element ;  }    Output:   418     0, 'a'    1, 'b'  39 Destructuring  In the next two sections, we’ll look deeper into the two kinds of destructuring: object- destructuring and Array-destructuring.  39.4 Object-destructuring Object-destructuring lets you batch-extract values of properties via patterns that look like object literals:  const address = {  street: 'Evergreen Terrace', number: '742', city: 'Springfield', state: 'NT', zip: '49007',  };  const { street: s, city: c } = address; assert.equal s, 'Evergreen Terrace' ; assert.equal c, 'Springfield' ;  You can think of the pattern as a transparent sheet that you place over the data: the pattern key 'street' has a match in the data. Therefore, the data value 'Evergreen Terrace' is assigned to the pattern variable s. You can also object-destructure primitive values:  const {length: len} = 'abc'; assert.equal len, 3 ;  And you can object-destructure Arrays:  const {0:x, 2:y} = ['a', 'b', 'c']; assert.equal x, 'a' ; assert.equal y, 'c' ;  Why does that work? Array indices are also properties.  39.4.1 Property value shorthands Object literals support property value shorthands and so do object patterns:  const { street, city } = address; assert.equal street, 'Evergreen Terrace' ; assert.equal city, 'Springfield' ;  Exercise: Object-destructuring  exercises destructuring object_destructuring_exrc.mjs   39.5 Array-destructuring  419  39.4.2 Rest properties In object literals, you can have spread properties. In object patterns, you can have rest properties  which must come last :  const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }; const { a: propValue, ...remaining } = obj;     A   assert.equal propValue, 1 ; assert.deepEqual remaining, {b:2, c:3} ;  A rest property variable, such as remaining  line A , is assigned an object with all data properties whose keys are not mentioned in the pattern. remaining can also be viewed as the result of non-destructively removing property a from obj.  39.4.3 Syntax pitfall: assigning via object destructuring If we object-destructure in an assignment, we are facing a pitfall caused by syntactic ambiguity – you can’t start a statement with a curly brace because then JavaScript thinks you are starting a block:  let prop; assert.throws      => eval "{prop} = { prop: 'hello' };" , {  name: 'SyntaxError', message: "Unexpected token '='",  } ;  Why eval  ?  eval   delays parsing  and therefore the SyntaxError  until the callback of as- sert.throws   is executed. If we didn’t use it, we’d already get an error when this code is parsed and assert.throws   wouldn’t even be executed.  The workaround is to put the whole assignment in parentheses:  let prop;  {prop} = { prop: 'hello' } ; assert.equal prop, 'hello' ;  39.5 Array-destructuring Array-destructuring lets you batch-extract values of Array elements via patterns that look like Array literals:  const [x, y] = ['a', 'b']; assert.equal x, 'a' ;   420  39 Destructuring  assert.equal y, 'b' ;  You can skip elements by mentioning holes inside Array patterns:  const [, x, y] = ['a', 'b', 'c'];     A  assert.equal x, 'b' ; assert.equal y, 'c' ;  The ﬁrst element of the Array pattern in line A is a hole, which is why the Array element at index 0 is ignored.  39.5.1 Array-destructuring works with any iterable Array-destructuring can be applied to any value that is iterable, not just to Arrays:     Sets are iterable const mySet = new Set  .add 'a' .add 'b' .add 'c' ; const [first, second] = mySet; assert.equal first, 'a' ; assert.equal second, 'b' ;     Strings are iterable const [a, b] = 'xyz'; assert.equal a, 'x' ; assert.equal b, 'y' ;  39.5.2 Rest elements In Array literals, you can have spread elements. In Array patterns, you can have rest elements  which must come last :  const [x, y, ...remaining] = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];     A   assert.equal x, 'a' ; assert.equal y, 'b' ; assert.deepEqual remaining, ['c', 'd'] ;  A rest element variable, such as remaining  line A , is assigned an Array with all elements of the destructured value that were not mentioned yet.  39.6 Examples of destructuring 39.6.1 Array-destructuring: swapping variable values You can use Array-destructuring to swap the values of two variables without needing a temporary variable:  let x = 'a'; let y = 'b';  [x,y] = [y,x];    swap   39.6 Examples of destructuring  421  assert.equal x, 'b' ; assert.equal y, 'a' ;  39.6.2 Array-destructuring: operations that return Arrays Array-destructuring is useful when operations return Arrays, as does, for example, the regular expression method .exec  :     Skip the element at index 0  the whole match : const [, year, month, day] =   ^ [0-9]{4} - [0-9]{2} - [0-9]{2} $  .exec '2999-12-31' ;  assert.equal year, '2999' ; assert.equal month, '12' ; assert.equal day, '31' ;  39.6.3 Object-destructuring: multiple return values Destructuring is very useful if a function returns multiple values – either packaged as an Array or packaged as an object. Consider a function findElement   that ﬁnds elements in an Array:  findElement array,  value, index  => «boolean expression»   Its second parameter is a function that receives the value and index of an element and returns a boolean indicating if this is the element the caller is looking for. We are now faced with a dilemma: Should findElement   return the value of the element it found or the index? One solution would be to create two separate functions, but that would result in duplicated code because both functions would be very similar. The following implementation avoids duplication by returning an object that contains both index and value of the element that is found:  function findElement arr, predicate  {  for  let index=0; index < arr.length; index++  {  const value = arr[index]; if  predicate value   {    We found something: return { value, index };  }  }  }    We didn’t find anything: return { value: undefined, index: -1 };  Destructuring helps us with processing the result of findElement  :  const arr = [7, 8, 6];   422  39 Destructuring  const {value, index} = findElement arr, x => x % 2 === 0 ; assert.equal value, 8 ; assert.equal index, 1 ;  As we are working with property keys, the order in which we mention value and index doesn’t matter:  const {index, value} = findElement arr, x => x % 2 === 0 ;  The kicker is that destructuring also serves us well if we are only interested in one of the two results:  const arr = [7, 8, 6];  const {value} = findElement arr, x => x % 2 === 0 ; assert.equal value, 8 ;  const {index} = findElement arr, x => x % 2 === 0 ; assert.equal index, 1 ;  All of these conveniences combined make this way of handling multiple return values quite versatile.  39.7 What happens if a pattern part does not match any-  thing?  What happens if there is no match for part of a pattern? The same thing that happens if you use non-batch operators: you get undefined.  39.7.1 Object-destructuring and missing properties If a property in an object pattern has no match on the right-hand side, you get undefined:  const {prop: p} = {}; assert.equal p, undefined ;  const [x] = []; assert.equal x, undefined ;  39.7.2 Array-destructuring and missing elements If an element in an Array pattern has no match on the right-hand side, you get undefined:  39.8 What values can’t be destructured? 39.8.1 You can’t object-destructure undefined and null Object-destructuring only fails if the value to be destructured is either undefined or null. That is, it fails whenever accessing a property via the dot operator would fail too.   39.9  Advanced   423  > const {prop} = undefined TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'prop' of 'undefined' as it is undefined.  > const {prop} = null TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'prop' of 'null' as it is null.  39.8.2 You can’t Array-destructure non-iterable values Array-destructuring demands that the destructured value be iterable. Therefore, you can’t Array-destructure undefined and null. But you can’t Array-destructure non-iterable objects either:  > const [x] = {} TypeError: {} is not iterable  Quiz: basic  See quiz app.   Advanced   39.9 All of the remaining sections are advanced.  39.10 Default values Normally, if a pattern has no match, the corresponding variable is set to undefined:  If you want a different value to be used, you need to specify a default value  via = :  const {prop: p} = {}; assert.equal p, undefined ;  const {prop: p = 123} = {};     A  assert.equal p, 123 ;  In line A, we specify the default value for p to be 123. That default is used because the data that we are destructuring has no property named prop.  39.10.1 Default values in Array-destructuring Here, we have two default values that are assigned to the variables x and y because the corresponding elements don’t exist in the Array that is destructured.  const [x=1, y=2] = [];  assert.equal x, 1 ; assert.equal y, 2 ;   424  39 Destructuring  The default value for the ﬁrst element of the Array pattern is 1; the default value for the second element is 2.  39.10.2 Default values in object-destructuring You can also specify default values for object-destructuring:  const {first: f='', last: l=''} = {}; assert.equal f, '' ; assert.equal l, '' ;  Neither property key first nor property key last exist in the object that is destructured. Therefore, the default values are used. With property value shorthands, this code becomes simpler:  const {first='', last=''} = {}; assert.equal first, '' ; assert.equal last, '' ;  39.11 Parameter deﬁnitions are similar to destructuring Considering what we have learned in this chapter, parameter deﬁnitions have much in common with an Array pattern  rest elements, default values, etc. . In fact, the following two function declarations are equivalent:  function f1 «pattern1», «pattern2»  {     ···  function f2 ...args  {  const [«pattern1», «pattern2»] = args;    ···  }  }  39.12 Nested destructuring Until now, we have only used variables as assignment targets  data sinks  inside destruc- turing patterns. But you can also use patterns as assignment targets, which enables you to nest patterns to arbitrary depths:  const arr = [  { first: 'Jane', last: 'Bond' }, { first: 'Lars', last: 'Croft' },  ]; const [, {first}] = arr; assert.equal first, 'Lars' ;  Inside the Array pattern in line A, there is a nested object pattern at index 1. Nested patterns can become difﬁcult to understand, so they are best used in moderation.   39.12 Nested destructuring  Quiz: advanced  See quiz app.  425   426  39 Destructuring   Chapter 40  Synchronous generators  advanced   Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . .  40.1 What are synchronous generators? .  . . . . . . 40.2 Calling generators from generators  advanced  . . . .  . . 40.1.1 Generator functions return iterables and ﬁll them via yield . . . 40.1.2 yield pauses a generator function . . . 40.1.3 Why does yield pause execution? . . . 40.1.4 Example: Mapping over iterables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . 40.3 Background: external iteration vs. internal iteration . 40.4 Use case for generators: reusing traversals . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . 40.5 Advanced features of generators .  40.4.1 The traversal to reuse . 40.4.2 Internal iteration  push  40.4.3 External iteration  pull  .  40.2.1 Calling generators via yield* . 40.2.2 Example: Iterating over a tree .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . .  . .  . .  .  . 427 . 428 . 428 . 430 . 431 . 431 . 431 . 432 . 433 . 434 . 434 . 434 . 435 . 435  40.1 What are synchronous generators? Synchronous generators are special versions of function deﬁnitions and method deﬁni- tions that always return synchronous iterables:     Generator function declaration function* genFunc1   {  *···*  }     Generator function expression const genFunc2 = function*    {  *···*  };  427   428  40 Synchronous generators  advanced      Generator method definition in an object literal const obj = {  * generatorMethod   {     ···     Generator method definition in a class definition     class declaration or class expression  class MyClass {  * generatorMethod   {     ···  }  };  }  }  Asterisks  *  mark functions and methods as generators:    Functions: The pseudo-keyword function* is a combination of the keyword func-  tion and an asterisk.    Methods: The * is a modiﬁer  similar to static and get .  40.1.1 Generator functions return iterables and ﬁll them via yield If you call a generator function, it returns an iterable  actually, an iterator that is also iterable . The generator ﬁlls that iterable via the yield operator:  const iterable = genFunc1  ;    Convert the iterable to an Array, to check what’s inside: assert.deepEqual [...iterable], ['a', 'b'] ;  function* genFunc1   {  yield 'a'; yield 'b';  }     You can also use a for-of loop for  const x of genFunc1    {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'a'    'b'  40.1.2 yield pauses a generator function Using a generator function involves the following steps:    Function-calling it returns an iterator iter  that is also an iterable .   Iterating over iter repeatedly invokes iter.next  . Each time, we jump into the  body of the generator function until there is a yield that returns a value.   40.1 What are synchronous generators?  429  Therefore, yield does more than just add values to iterables – it also pauses and exits the generator function:    Like return, a yield exits the body of the function and returns a value  via    Unlike return, if you repeat the invocation  of .next   , execution resumes di-  .next   .  rectly after the yield.  Let’s examine what that means via the following generator function.  let location = 0; function* genFunc2   {  location = 1; yield 'a'; location = 2; yield 'b'; location = 3;  }  In order to use genFunc2  , we must ﬁrst create the iterator iterable iter. genFunc2   is now paused “before” its body. const iter = genFunc2  ;    genFunc2   is now paused “before” its body: assert.equal location, 0 ;  iter implements the iteration protocol. Therefore, we control the execution of gen- Func2   via iter.next  . Calling that method resumes the paused genFunc2   and ex- ecutes it until there is a yield. Then execution pauses and .next   returns the operand of the yield:  assert.deepEqual   iter.next  , {value: 'a', done: false} ;     genFunc2   is now paused directly after the first `yield`: assert.equal location, 1 ;  Note that the yielded value 'a' is wrapped in an object, which is how iterators always deliver their values. We call iter.next   again and execution continues where we previously paused. Once we encounter the second yield, genFunc2   is paused and .next   returns the yielded value 'b'.  assert.deepEqual   iter.next  , {value: 'b', done: false} ;     genFunc2   is now paused directly after the second `yield`: assert.equal location, 2 ;  We call iter.next   one more time and execution continues until it leaves the body of genFunc2  :  assert.deepEqual   iter.next  , {value: undefined, done: true} ;     We have reached the end of genFunc2  : assert.equal location, 3 ;   430  40 Synchronous generators  advanced   This time, property .done of the result of .next   is true, which means that the iterator is ﬁnished.  40.1.3 Why does yield pause execution? What are the beneﬁts of yield pausing execution? Why doesn’t it simply work like the Array method .push   and ﬁll the iterable with values without pausing? Due to pausing, generators provide many of the features of coroutines  think processes that are multitasked cooperatively . For example, when you ask for the next value of an iterable, that value is computed lazily  on demand . The following two generator functions demonstrate what that means.   ** * Returns an iterable over lines *  function* genLines   {  yield 'A line'; yield 'Another line'; yield 'Last line';  }   ** * Input: iterable over lines * Output: iterable over numbered lines *  function* numberLines lineIterable  {  let lineNumber = 1; for  const line of lineIterable  {    input yield lineNumber + ': ' + line;    output lineNumber++;  }  }  Note that the yield in numberLines   appears inside a for-of loop. yield can be used inside loops, but not inside callbacks  more on that later . Let’s combine both generators to produce the iterable numberedLines:  const numberedLines = numberLines genLines   ; assert.deepEqual   numberedLines.next  , {value: '1: A line', done: false} ;  assert.deepEqual   numberedLines.next  , {value: '2: Another line', done: false} ;  The key beneﬁt of using generators here is that everything works incrementally: via numberedLines.next  , we ask numberLines   for only a single numbered line. In turn, it asks genLines   for only a single unnumbered line. This incrementalism continues to work if, for example, genLines   reads its lines from a large text ﬁle: If we ask numberLines   for a numbered line, we get one as soon as genLines   has read its ﬁrst line from the text ﬁle.   40.2 Calling generators from generators  advanced   431  Without generators, genLines   would ﬁrst read all lines and return them. Then num- berLines   would number all lines and return them. We therefore have to wait much longer until we get the ﬁrst numbered line.  Exercise: Turning a normal function into a generator  exercises sync-generators fib_seq_test.mjs  40.1.4 Example: Mapping over iterables The following function mapIter   is similar to the Array method .map  , but it returns an iterable, not an Array, and produces its results on demand.  function* mapIter iterable, func  {  let index = 0; for  const x of iterable  {  yield func x, index ; index++;  }  }  const iterable = mapIter ['a', 'b'], x => x + x ; assert.deepEqual [...iterable], ['aa', 'bb'] ;  Exercise: Filtering iterables  exercises sync-generators filter_iter_gen_test.mjs  40.2 Calling generators from generators  advanced  40.2.1 Calling generators via yield* yield only works directly inside generators – so far we haven’t seen a way of delegating yielding to another function or method. Let’s ﬁrst examine what does not work: in the following example, we’d like foo   to call bar  , so that the latter yields two values for the former. Alas, a naive approach fails:  function* bar   {  yield 'a'; yield 'b';  } function* foo   {  } assert.deepEqual  [...foo  ], [] ;     Nothing happens if we call `bar  `: bar  ;   432  40 Synchronous generators  advanced   Why doesn’t this work? The function call bar   returns an iterable, which we ignore. What we want is for foo   to yield everything that is yielded by bar  . That’s what the yield* operator does: function* bar   {  yield 'a'; yield 'b';  } function* foo   {  yield* bar  ;  } assert.deepEqual   [...foo  ], ['a', 'b'] ;  In other words, the previous foo   is roughly equivalent to:  function* foo   {  for  const x of bar    {  yield x;  }  }  Note that yield* works with any iterable:  function* gen   { yield* [1, 2];  } assert.deepEqual   [...gen  ], [1, 2] ;  40.2.2 Example: Iterating over a tree yield* lets us make recursive calls in generators, which is useful when iterating over recursive data structures such as trees. Take, for example, the following data structure for binary trees.  class BinaryTree {  constructor value, left=null, right=null  {  this.value = value; this.left = left; this.right = right;  }  yield this.value; if  this.left  {  } if  this.right  {   ** Prefix iteration: parent before children *  * [Symbol.iterator]   {     Same as yield* this.left[Symbol.iterator]   yield* this.left;   40.3 Background: external iteration vs. internal iteration  433  Method [Symbol.iterator]   adds support for the iteration protocol, which means that we can use a for-of loop to iterate over an instance of BinaryTree:  yield* this.right;  }  }  }  const tree = new BinaryTree 'a',  new BinaryTree 'b',  new BinaryTree 'c' , new BinaryTree 'd'  ,  new BinaryTree 'e'  ;  for  const x of tree  {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'a'    'b'    'c'    'd'    'e'  Exercise: Iterating over a nested Array  exercises sync-generators iter_nested_arrays_test.mjs  40.3 Background: external iteration vs. internal iteration In preparation for the next section, we need to learn about two different styles of iterating over the values “inside” an object:    External iteration  pull : Your code asks the object for the values via an iteration protocol. For example, the for-of loop is based on JavaScript’s iteration protocol:  for  const x of ['a', 'b']  {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'a'    'b'  ['a', 'b'].forEach  x  => {  console.log x ;  } ;    Internal iteration  push : You pass a callback function to a method of the object and the method feeds the values to the callback. For example, Arrays have the method .forEach  :   434  40 Synchronous generators  advanced      Output:    'a'    'b'  The next section has examples for both styles of iteration.  40.4 Use case for generators: reusing traversals One important use case for generators is extracting and reusing traversals.  40.4.1 The traversal to reuse As an example, consider the following function that traverses a tree of ﬁles and logs their paths  it uses the Node.js API for doing so :  function logPaths dir  {  for  const fileName of fs.readdirSync dir   {  const filePath = path.resolve dir, fileName ; console.log filePath ; const stats = fs.statSync filePath ; if  stats.isDirectory    {  logPaths filePath ;    recursive call  Consider the following directory:  }  }  }  mydir   a.txt b.txt subdir   c.txt  Let’s log the paths inside mydir :  logPaths 'mydir' ;     Output:    'mydir a.txt'    'mydir b.txt'    'mydir subdir'    'mydir subdir c.txt'  How can we reuse this traversal and do something other than logging the paths?  Internal iteration  push   40.4.2 One way of reusing traversal code is via internal iteration: Each traversed value is passsed to a callback  line A .   40.5 Advanced features of generators  435  function visitPaths dir, callback  {  for  const fileName of fs.readdirSync dir   {  const filePath = path.resolve dir, fileName ; callback filePath ;     A  const stats = fs.statSync filePath ; if  stats.isDirectory    {  visitPaths filePath, callback ;  } const paths = []; visitPaths 'mydir', p => paths.push p  ; assert.deepEqual   }  }  paths, [  ] ;  'mydir a.txt', 'mydir b.txt', 'mydir subdir', 'mydir subdir c.txt',  function* iterPaths dir  {  for  const fileName of fs.readdirSync dir   {  const filePath = path.resolve dir, fileName ; yield filePath;     A  const stats = fs.statSync filePath ; if  stats.isDirectory    {  yield* iterPaths filePath ;  }  }  } const paths = [...iterPaths 'mydir' ];  40.4.3 External iteration  pull  Another way of reusing traversal code is via external iteration: We can write a generator that yields all traversed values  line A .  40.5 Advanced features of generators The chapter on generators in Exploring ES6 covers two features that are beyond the scope of this book:    yield can also receive data, via an argument of .next  .   Generators can also return values  not just yield them . Such values do not be-  come iteration values, but can be retrieved via yield*.   436  40 Synchronous generators  advanced    Part VIII  Asynchronicity  437    Asynchronous programming in JavaScript  Chapter 41  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  41.1 A roadmap for asynchronous programming in JavaScript . .  . 41.1.1 Synchronous functions . . 41.1.2 JavaScript executes tasks sequentially in a single process . 41.1.3 Callback-based asynchronous functions . 41.1.4 Promise-based asynchronous functions . . . . . 41.1.5 Async functions . . . . . . 41.1.6 Next steps . 41.2 The call stack . . . . . . . . . 41.3 The event loop . . . . . . . 41.4 How to avoid blocking the JavaScript process . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 41.4.1 The user interface of the browser can be blocked . . . . 41.4.2 How can we avoid blocking the browser? . . . . . . 41.4.3 Taking breaks . . . 41.4.4 Run-to-completion semantics . . . . . . . . . . . 41.5.1 Delivering asynchronous results via events . 41.5.2 Delivering asynchronous results via callbacks . . . . . . . .  . . 41.5 Patterns for delivering asynchronous results  41.6 Asynchronous code: the downsides 41.7 Resources . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 440 . 440 . 440 . 440 . 441 . 441 . 442 . 442 . 443 . 444 . 444 . 445 . 445 . 446 . 446 . 447 . 449 . 449 . 450  This chapter explains the foundations of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.  439   440 41 Asynchronous programming in JavaScript 41.1 A roadmap for asynchronous programming in  JavaScript  This section provides a roadmap for the content on asynchronous programming in JavaScript.  Don’t worry about the details!  Don’t worry if you don’t understand everything yet. This is just a quick peek at what’s coming up.  41.1.1 Synchronous functions Normal functions are synchronous: the caller waits until the callee is ﬁnished with its computation. divideSync   in line A is a synchronous function call:  function main   {  try {  const result = divideSync 12, 3 ;     A  assert.equal result, 4 ;  } catch  err  {  assert.fail err ;  }  }  }  JavaScript executes tasks sequentially in a single process  41.1.2 By default, JavaScript tasks are functions that are executed sequentially in a single process. That looks like this: while  true  {  const task = taskQueue.dequeue  ; task  ;    run task  This loop is also called the event loop because events, such as clicking a mouse, add tasks to the queue. Due to this style of cooperative multitasking, we don’t want a task to block other tasks from being executed while, for example, it waits for results coming from a server. The next subsection explores how to handle this case.  41.1.3 Callback-based asynchronous functions What if divide   needs a server to compute its result? Then the result should be deliv- ered in a different manner: The caller shouldn’t have to wait  synchronously  until the result is ready; it should be notiﬁed  asynchronously  when it is. One way of delivering the result asynchronously is by giving divide   a callback function that it uses to notify the caller.   41.1 A roadmap for asynchronous programming in JavaScript  441  function main   {  divideCallback 12, 3,  err, result  => {  if  err  {  assert.fail err ;  } else {  assert.equal result, 4 ;  } } ;  }  When there is an asynchronous function call:  divideCallback x, y, callback   Then the following steps happen:    divideCallback   sends a request to a server.   Then the current task main   is ﬁnished and other tasks can be executed.   When a response from the server arrives, it is either:  – An error err: Then the following task is added to the queue.  taskQueue.enqueue    => callback err  ;  – A result r: Then the following task is added to the queue.  taskQueue.enqueue    => callback null, r  ;  41.1.4 Promise-based asynchronous functions Promises are two things:    A standard pattern that makes working with callbacks easier.   The mechanism on which async functions  the topic of the next subsection  are built.  Invoking a Promise-based function looks as follows.  function main   {  dividePromise 12, 3   .then result => assert.equal result, 4   .catch err => assert.fail err  ;  41.1.5 Async functions One way of looking at async functions is as better syntax for Promise-based code:  async function main   {  try {  } catch  err  {  assert.fail err ;  const result = await dividePromise 12, 3 ;     A  assert.equal result, 4 ;  }  }  }   442  41 Asynchronous programming in JavaScript  The dividePromise   we are calling in line A is the same Promise-based function as in the previous section. But we now have synchronous-looking syntax for handling the call. await can only be used inside a special kind of function, an async function  note the keyword async in front of the keyword function . await pauses the current async func- tion and returns from it. Once the awaited result is ready, the execution of the function continues where it left off.  41.1.6 Next steps    In this chapter, we’ll see how synchronous function calls work. We’ll also explore  JavaScript’s way of executing code in a single process, via its event loop.    Asynchronicity via callbacks is also described in this chapter.   The following chapters cover Promises and async functions.   This series of chapters on asynchronous programming concludes with the chapter on asynchronous iteration, which is similar to synchronous iteration, but iterated values are delivered asynchronously.  41.2 The call stack Whenever a function calls another function, we need to remember where to return to after the latter function is ﬁnished. That is typically done via a stack – the call stack: the caller pushes onto it the location to return to, and the callee jumps to that location after it is done. This is an example where several calls happen:  function h z  {  const error = new Error  ; console.log error.stack ;  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  } function g y  {  h y + 1 ;  } function f x  {  g x + 1 ;  } f 3 ;    done  Initially, before running this piece of code, the call stack is empty. After the function call f 3  in line 11, the stack has one entry:    Line 12  location in top-level scope   After the function call g x + 1  in line 9, the stack has two entries:    Line 10  location in f      Line 12  location in top-level scope   After the function call h y + 1  in line 6, the stack has three entries:   41.3 The event loop  443    Line 7  location in g      Line 10  location in f      Line 12  location in top-level scope   Logging error in line 3, produces the following output:  DEBUG  Error:  at h  file:  demos async-js stack_trace.mjs:2:17  at g  file:  demos async-js stack_trace.mjs:6:3  at f  file:  demos async-js stack_trace.mjs:9:3  at file:  demos async-js stack_trace.mjs:11:1  This is a so-called stack trace of where the Error object was created. Note that it records where calls were made, not return locations. Creating the exception in line 2 is yet an- other call. That’s why the stack trace includes a location inside h  . After line 3, each of the functions terminates and each time, the top entry is removed from the call stack. After function f is done, we are back in top-level scope and the stack is empty. When the code fragment ends then that is like an implicit return. If we consider the code fragment to be a task that is executed, then returning with an empty call stack ends the task.  41.3 The event loop By default, JavaScript runs in a single process – in both web browsers and Node.js. The so-called event loop sequentially executes tasks  pieces of code  inside that process. The event loop is depicted in ﬁg. 41.1.  Figure 41.1: Task sources add code to run to the task queue, which is emptied by the event loop.  Task sources:    DOM manipulation    User interaction    Networking    History traversal    …  func3  running  func2 func1  onTimeout  Call stack  Event loop ↺  onClick Task queue  onDone  onClick   444  41 Asynchronous programming in JavaScript  Two parties access the task queue:    Task sources add tasks to the queue. Some of those sources run concurrently to the JavaScript process. For example, one task source takes care of user interface events: if a user clicks somewhere and a click listener was registered, then an invocation of that listener is added to the task queue.    The event loop runs continuously inside the JavaScript process. During each loop iteration, it takes one task out of the queue  if the queue is empty, it waits until it isn’t  and executes it. That task is ﬁnished when the call stack is empty and there is a return. Control goes back to the event loop, which then retrieves the next task from the queue and executes it. And so on.  The following JavaScript code is an approximation of the event loop:  while  true  {  const task = taskQueue.dequeue  ; task  ;    run task  }  41.4 How to avoid blocking the JavaScript process 41.4.1 The user interface of the browser can be blocked Many of the user interface mechanisms of browsers also run in the JavaScript process  as tasks . Therefore, long-running JavaScript code can block the user interface. Let’s look at a web page that demonstrates that. There are two ways in which you can try out that page:    You can run it online.   You can open the following ﬁle inside the repository with the exercises: demos   async-js blocking.html  The following HTML is the page’s user interface:   Block      Click me!   The idea is that you click “Block” and a long-running loop is executed via JavaScript. During that loop, you can’t click the button because the browser JavaScript process is blocked. A simpliﬁed version of the JavaScript code looks like this:  document.getElementById 'block'   .addEventListener 'click', doBlock ;     A   function doBlock event  {     ··· displayStatus 'Blocking...' ;    ··· sleep 5000 ;     B    41.4 How to avoid blocking the JavaScript process  445  displayStatus 'Done' ;  function sleep milliseconds  {  const start = Date.now  ; while   Date.now   - start  < milliseconds ;  } function displayStatus status  {  document.getElementById 'statusMessage'   .textContent = status;  }  }  These are the key parts of the code:    Line A: We tell the browser to call doBlock   whenever the HTML element is  clicked whose ID is block.    doBlock   displays status information and then calls sleep   to block the  JavaScript process for 5000 milliseconds  line B .    sleep   blocks the JavaScript process by looping until enough time has passed.   displayStatus   displays status messages inside the   whose ID is sta-  tusMessage.  41.4.2 How can we avoid blocking the browser? There are several ways in which you can prevent a long-running operation from blocking the browser:    The operation can deliver its result asynchronously: Some operations, such as down- loads, can be performed concurrently to the JavaScript process. The JavaScript code triggering such an operation registers a callback, which is invoked with the result once the operation is ﬁnished. The invocation is handled via the task queue. This style of delivering a result is called asynchronous because the caller doesn’t wait until the results are ready. Normal function calls deliver their results syn- chronously.    Perform long computations in separate processes: This can be done via so-called Web Workers. Web Workers are heavyweight processes that run concurrently to the main process. Each one of them has its own runtime environment  global variables, etc. . They are completely isolated and must be communicated with via message passing. Consult MDN web docs for more information.    Take breaks during long computations. The next subsection explains how.  41.4.3 Taking breaks The following global function executes its parameter callback after a delay of ms mil- liseconds  the type signature is simpliﬁed – setTimeout   has more features :  function setTimeout callback:    => void, ms: number : any  The function returns a handle  an ID  that can be used to clear the timeout  cancel the execution of the callback  via the following global function:   446  41 Asynchronous programming in JavaScript  function clearTimeout handle?: any : void  setTimeout   is available on both browsers and Node.js. The next subsection shows it in action.  setTimeout   lets tasks take breaks  Another way of looking at setTimeout   is that the current task takes a break and continues later via the callback.  41.4.4 Run-to-completion semantics JavaScript makes a guarantee for tasks:  Each task is always ﬁnished  “run to completion”  before the next task is executed.  As a consequence, tasks don’t have to worry about their data being changed while they are working on it  concurrent modiﬁcation . That simpliﬁes programming in JavaScript. The following example demonstrates this guarantee:  console.log 'start' ; setTimeout    => {  console.log 'callback' ;  }, 0 ; console.log 'end' ;     Output:    'start'    'end'    'callback'  setTimeout   puts its parameter into the task queue. The parameter is therefore exe- cuted sometime after the current piece of code  task  is completely ﬁnished. The parameter ms only speciﬁes when the task is put into the queue, not when exactly it runs. It may even never run – for example, if there is a task before it in the queue that never terminates. That explains why the previous code logs 'end' before 'callback', even though the parameter ms is 0.  41.5 Patterns for delivering asynchronous results In order to avoid blocking the main process while waiting for a long-running operation to ﬁnish, results are often delivered asynchronously in JavaScript. These are three popular patterns for doing so:    Events   Callbacks   Promises   41.5 Patterns for delivering asynchronous results  447  The ﬁrst two patterns are explained in the next two subsections. Promises are explained in the next chapter.  41.5.1 Delivering asynchronous results via events Events as a pattern work as follows:    They are used to deliver values asynchronously.   They do so zero or more times.   There are three roles in this pattern:  – The event  an object  carries the data to be delivered. – The event listener is a function that receives events via a parameter. – The event source sends events and lets you register event listeners.  Multiple variations of this pattern exist in the world of JavaScript. We’ll look at three examples next.  41.5.1.1 Events: IndexedDB IndexedDB is a database that is built into web browsers. This is an example of using it:  const openRequest = indexedDB.open 'MyDatabase', 1 ;     A   openRequest.onsuccess =  event  => {  const db = event.target.result;    ···  openRequest.onerror =  error  => {  console.error error ;  };  };  indexedDB has an unusual way of invoking operations:    Each operation has an associated method for creating request objects. For example, in line A, the operation is “open”, the method is .open  , and the request object is openRequest.    The parameters for the operation are provided via the request object, not via pa- rameters of the method. For example, the event listeners  functions  are stored in the properties .onsuccess and .onerror.    The invocation of the operation is added to the task queue via the method  in line A . That is, we conﬁgure the operation after its invocation has already been added to the queue. Only run-to-completion semantics saves us from race conditions here and ensures that the operation runs after the current code fragment is ﬁnished.  41.5.1.2 Events: XMLHttpRequest The XMLHttpRequest API lets us make downloads from within a web browser. This is how we download the ﬁle http:  example.com textfile.txt:   448  41 Asynchronous programming in JavaScript  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ;     A  xhr.open 'GET', 'http:  example.com textfile.txt' ;     B  xhr.onload =    => {     C  if  xhr.status == 200  {  processData xhr.responseText ;  } else {  }  assert.fail new Error xhr.statusText  ;  }; xhr.onerror =    => {     D   assert.fail new Error 'Network error'  ;  }; xhr.send  ;     E   function processData str  {  assert.equal str, 'Content of textfile.txt\n' ;  }  }  With this API, we ﬁrst create a request object  line A , then conﬁgure it, then activate it  line E . The conﬁguration consists of:    Specifying which HTTP request method to use  line B : GET, POST, PUT, etc.   Registering a listener  line C  that is notiﬁed if something could be downloaded. Inside the listener, we still need to determine if the download contains what we requested or informs us of an error. Note that some of the result data is delivered via the request object xhr.  I’m not a fan of this kind of mixing of input and output data.     Registering a listener  line D  that is notiﬁed if there was a network error.  41.5.1.3 Events: DOM We have already seen DOM events in action in §41.4.1 “The user interface of the browser can be blocked”. The following code also handles click events:  const element = document.getElementById 'my-link' ;     A  element.addEventListener 'click', clickListener ;     B   function clickListener event  { event.preventDefault  ;     C  console.log event.shiftKey ;     D   We ﬁrst ask the browser to retrieve the HTML element whose ID is 'my-link'  line A . Then we add a listener for all click events  line B . In the listener, we ﬁrst tell the browser not to perform its default action  line C  – going to the target of the link. Then we log to the console if the shift key is currently pressed  line D .   41.6 Asynchronous code: the downsides  449  41.5.2 Delivering asynchronous results via callbacks Callbacks are another pattern for handling asynchronous results. They are only used for one-off results and have the advantage of being less verbose than events. As an example, consider a function readFile   that reads a text ﬁle and returns its con- tents asynchronously. This is how you call readFile   if it uses Node.js-style callbacks:  readFile 'some-file.txt', {encoding: 'utf8'},   error, data  => {  if  error  {  assert.fail error ; return;  } assert.equal data, 'The content of some-file.txt\n' ;  } ;  There is a single callback that handles both success and failure. If the ﬁrst parameter is not null then an error happened. Otherwise, the result can be found in the second parameter.  Exercises: Callback-based code  The following exercises use tests for asynchronous code, which are different from tests for synchronous code. Consult §12.3.2 “Asynchronous tests in Mocha” for more information.    From synchronous to callback-based code: exercises async-js read_    Implementing a callback-based version of .map  :  exercises async-  file_cb_exrc.mjs  js map_cb_test.mjs  41.6 Asynchronous code: the downsides In many situations, on either browsers or Node.js, you have no choice, you must use asynchronous code. In this chapter, we have seen several patterns that such code can use. All of them have two disadvantages:    Asynchronous code is more verbose than synchronous code.   If you call asynchronous code, your code must become asynchronous too. That’s because you can’t wait synchronously for an asynchronous result. Asynchronous code has an infectious quality.  The ﬁrst disadvantage becomes less severe with Promises  covered in the next chapter  and mostly disappears with async functions  covered in the chapter after next . Alas, the infectiousness of async code does not go away. But it is mitigated by the fact that switching between sync and async is easy with async functions.   450 41.7 Resources  41 Asynchronous programming in JavaScript    “Help, I’m stuck in an event-loop” by Philip Roberts  video .   “Event loops”, section in HTML5 spec.

Recommended reading  This chapter builds on the previous chapter with background on asynchronous pro- gramming in JavaScript.  42.1 The basics of using Promises Promises are a pattern for delivering results asynchronously.  42.1.1 Using a Promise-based function The following code is an example of using the Promise-based function addAsync    whose implementation is shown soon :  addAsync 3, 4   .then result => {    success  assert.equal result, 7 ;  }  .catch error => {    failure  assert.fail error ;  } ;  Promises are similar to the event pattern: There is an object  a Promise , where we register callbacks:    Method .then   registers callbacks that handle results.   Method .catch   registers callbacks that handle errors.   42.1 The basics of using Promises  453  A Promise-based function returns a Promise and sends it a result or an error  if and when it is done . The Promise passes it on to the relevant callbacks. In contrast to the event pattern, Promises are optimized for one-off results:    A result  or an error  is cached so that it doesn’t matter if we register a callback  before or after the result  or error  was sent.    We can chain the Promise methods .then   and .catch   because they both return Promises. That helps with sequentially invoking multiple asynchronous functions. More on that later.  42.1.2 What is a Promise? What is a Promise? There are two ways of looking at it:    On one hand, it is a placeholder or container for the ﬁnal result that will eventually  be delivered.    On the other hand, it is an object with which we can register listeners.  Implementing a Promise-based function  42.1.3 This is an implementation of a Promise-based function that adds two numbers x and y:  function addAsync x, y  {  return new Promise    resolve, reject  => {     A   if  x === undefined  y === undefined  {  reject new Error 'Must provide two parameters'  ;  } else {  resolve x + y ;  } } ;  }  addAsync   immediately invokes the Promise constructor. The actual implementation of that function resides in the callback that is passed to that constructor  line A . That callback is provided with two functions:    resolve is used for delivering a result  in case of success .   reject is used for delivering an error  in case of failure .  42.1.4 States of Promises Fig. 42.1 depicts the three states a Promise can be in. Promises specialize in one-off results and protect us against race conditions  registering too early or too late :    If we register a .then   callback or a .catch   callback too early, it is notiﬁed once  a Promise is settled.    Once a Promise is settled, the settlement value  result or error  is cached. Thus, if .then   or .catch   are called after the settlement, they receive the cached value.   454  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  Figure 42.1: A Promise can be in either one of three states: pending, fulﬁlled, or rejected. If a Promise is in a ﬁnal  non-pending  state, it is called settled.  Additionally, once a Promise is settled, its state and settlement value can’t change any- more. That helps make code predictable and enforces the one-off nature of Promises.  Some Promises are never settled  It is possible that a Promise is never settled. For example:  new Promise    => {}   42.1.5 Promise.resolve  : create a Promise fulﬁlled with a given  value  Promise.resolve x  creates a Promise that is fulﬁlled with the value x:  Promise.resolve 123   .then x => {  assert.equal x, 123 ;  } ;  If the parameter is already a Promise, it is returned unchanged:  const abcPromise = Promise.resolve 'abc' ; assert.equal   Promise.resolve abcPromise , abcPromise ;  Therefore, given an arbitrary value x, we can use Promise.resolve x  to ensure we have a Promise. Note that the name is resolve, not fulfill, because .resolve   returns a rejected Promise if its Parameter is a rejected Promise.  42.1.6 Promise.reject  : create a Promise rejected with a given value Promise.reject err  creates a Promise that is rejected with the value err:  const myError = new Error 'My error!' ; Promise.reject myError   .catch err => {  Pending  Settled  Fulﬁlled  Rejected   42.1 The basics of using Promises  455  assert.equal err, myError ;  } ;  42.1.7 Returning and throwing in .then   callbacks .then   handles Promise fulﬁllments. It also returns a fresh Promise. How that Promise is settled depends on what happens inside the callback. Let’s look at three common cases.  42.1.7.1 Returning a non-Promise value First, the callback can return a non-Promise value  line A . Consequently, the Promise returned by .then   is fulﬁlled with that value  as checked in line B :  42.1.7.2 Returning a Promise Second, the callback can return a Promise p  line A . Consequently, p “becomes” what .then   returns. In other words: the Promise that .then   has already returned is effec- tively replaced by p.  Why is that useful? We can return the result of a Promise-based operation and process its fulﬁllment value via a “ﬂat”  non-nested  .then  . Compare:  Promise.resolve 'abc'   .then str => {  return str + str;     A   }  .then str2 => {  assert.equal str2, 'abcabc' ;     B   } ;  Promise.resolve 'abc'   .then str => {  return Promise.resolve 123 ;     A   }  .then num => {  assert.equal num, 123 ;  } ;     Flat asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {   *···*  return asyncFunc2  ;  }  .then result2 => {   *···*   } ;     Nested asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {   456  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]   *···*  asyncFunc2   .then result2 => {   *···*   } ;  } ;  42.1.7.3 Throwing an exception Third, the callback can throw an exception. Consequently, the Promise returned by .then   is rejected with that exception. That is, a synchronous error is converted into an asynchronous error.  const myError = new Error 'My error!' ; Promise.resolve 'abc'   .then str => {  throw myError;  }  .catch err => {  assert.equal err, myError ;  } ;  42.1.8 .catch   and its callback The difference between .then   and .catch   is that the latter is triggered by rejec- tions, not fulﬁllments. However, both methods turn the actions of their callbacks into Promises in the same manner. For example, in the following code, the value returned by the .catch   callback in line A becomes a fulﬁllment value:  const err = new Error  ;  Promise.reject err   .catch e => {  assert.equal e, err ;    Something went wrong, use a default value return 'default value';     A   }  .then str => {  } ;  assert.equal str, 'default value' ;  42.1.9 Chaining method calls .then   and .catch   always return Promises. That enables us to create arbitrary long chains of method calls:  function myAsyncFunc   {  return asyncFunc1       A   .then result1 => {     ···   42.1 The basics of using Promises  457  return asyncFunc2  ;    a Promise  }  .then result2 => {     ··· return result2 ?? ' Empty ';    not a Promise  }  .then result3 => {     ··· return asyncFunc4  ;    a Promise  } ;  }  Due to chaining, the return in line A returns the result of the last .then  . In a way, .then   is the asynchronous version of the synchronous semicolon:    .then   executes two asynchronous operations sequentially.   The semicolon executes two synchronous operations sequentially.  We can also add .catch   into the mix and let it handle multiple error sources at the same time:     Failure: handle errors of asyncFunc1  , asyncFunc2      and any  sync  exceptions thrown in previous callbacks  42.1.10 .finally   [ES2018] The Promise method .finally   is often used as follows:  asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {     ··· return asyncFunction2  ;  }  .then result2 => {     ···  }  .catch error => {  } ;  somePromise  .then  result  => {     ···  }  .catch  error  => {     ···  }  .finally    => {     ···  }   ;   458  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  The .finally   callback is always executed – independently of somePromise and the values returned by .then   and or .catch  . In contrast:    The .then   callback is only executed if somePromise is fulﬁlled.   The .catch   callback is only executed if:  – either somePromise is rejected, – or the .then   callback returns a rejected Promise, – or the .then   callback throws an exception.  .finally   ignores what its callback returns and simply passes on the settlement that existed before it was called: Promise.resolve 123  .finally    => {}  .then  result  => {  assert.equal result, 123 ;  If, however, the .finally   callback throws an exception, the Promise returned by .fi- nally   is rejected:  } ;  } ;  } ;  Promise.reject 'error'   .finally    => {}  .catch  error  => {  assert.equal error, 'error' ;  Promise.reject 'error  originally '   .finally    => {  throw 'error  finally ';  }  .catch  error  => {  assert.equal error, 'error  finally ' ;  42.1.10.1 Use case for .finally  : cleaning up One common use case for .finally   is similar to a common use case of the synchronous finally clause: cleaning up after you are done with a resource. That should always happen, regardless of whether everything went smoothly or there was an error – for example:  let connection; db.open   .then  conn  => {  connection = conn; return connection.select { name: 'Jane' } ;  }  .then  result  => {    Process result    Use `connection` to make more queries   42.1 The basics of using Promises  459  42.1.10.2 Use case for .finally  : doing something ﬁrst after any kind of settlement We can also use .finally   before both .then   and .catch  . Then what we do in the .finally   callback is always executed before the other two callbacks.  For example, this is what happens with a fulﬁlled Promise:  }     ··· .catch  error  => {    handle errors  }  .finally    => {  connection.close  ;  } ;  Promise.resolve 'fulfilled'   .finally    => {  console.log 'finally' ;  }  .then  result  => {  console.log 'then ' + result ;  }  .catch  error  => {  console.log 'catch ' + error ;  }   ;    Output:    'finally'    'then fulfilled'  This is what happens with a rejected Promise:  Promise.reject 'rejected'   .finally    => {  console.log 'finally' ;  }  .then  result  => {  console.log 'then ' + result ;  }  .catch  error  => {  console.log 'catch ' + error ;  }   ;    Output:    'finally'    'catch rejected'   460  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  42.1.11 Advantages of promises over plain callbacks These are some of the advantages of Promises over plain callbacks when it comes to handling one-off results:    The type signatures of Promise-based functions and methods are cleaner: if a func- tion is callback-based, some parameters are about input, while the one or two call- backs at the end are about output. With Promises, everything output-related is handled via the returned value.    Chaining asynchronous processing steps is more convenient.   Promises handle both asynchronous errors  via rejections  and synchronous errors: Inside the callbacks for new Promise  , .then  , and .catch  , exceptions are con- verted to rejections. In contrast, if we use callbacks for asynchronicity, exceptions are normally not handled for us; we have to do it ourselves.    Promises are a single standard that is slowly replacing several, mutually incom- patible alternatives. For example, in Node.js, many functions are now available in Promise-based versions. And new asynchronous browser APIs are usually Promise-based.  One of the biggest advantages of Promises involves not working with them directly: they are the foundation of async functions, a synchronous-looking syntax for performing asyn- chronous computations. Asynchronous functions are covered in the next chapter.  42.2 Examples Seeing Promises in action helps with understanding them. Let’s look at examples.  42.2.1 Node.js: Reading a ﬁle asynchronously Consider the following text ﬁle person.json with JSON data in it:  Let’s look at two versions of code that reads this ﬁle and parses it into an object. First, a callback-based version. Second, a Promise-based version.  42.2.1.1 The callback-based version The following code reads the contents of this ﬁle and converts it to a JavaScript object. It is based on Node.js-style callbacks:  {  }  "first": "Jane", "last": "Doe"  import * as fs from 'fs'; fs.readFile 'person.json',   error, text  => {  if  error  {     A      Failure   42.2 Examples  461  const obj = JSON.parse text ;     C  assert.deepEqual obj, {  assert.fail error ;  } else {     Success try {     B   first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',  } ;  } catch  e  {     Invalid JSON assert.fail e ;  }  } } ;  fs is a built-in Node.js module for ﬁle system operations. We use the callback-based function fs.readFile   to read a ﬁle whose name is person.json. If we succeed, the content is delivered via the parameter text as a string. In line C, we convert that string from the text-based data format JSON into a JavaScript object. JSON is an object with methods for consuming and producing JSON. It is part of JavaScript’s standard library and documented later in this book. Note that there are two error-handling mechanisms: the if in line A takes care of asyn- chronous errors reported by fs.readFile  , while the try in line B takes care of syn- chronous errors reported by JSON.parse  .  42.2.1.2 The Promise-based version The following code uses readFileAsync  , a Promise-based version of fs.readFile    created via util.promisify  , which is explained later :  readFileAsync 'person.json'   .then text => {     A      Success const obj = JSON.parse text ; assert.deepEqual obj, {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',  } ;  }  .catch err => {     B      Failure: file I O error or JSON syntax error assert.fail err ;  } ;  Function readFileAsync   returns a Promise. In line A, we specify a success callback via method .then   of that Promise. The remaining code in then’s callback is synchronous. .then   returns a Promise, which enables the invocation of the Promise method .catch   in line B. We use it to specify a failure callback.   462  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  Note that .catch   lets us handle both the asynchronous errors of readFileAsync   and the synchronous errors of JSON.parse   because exceptions inside a .then   callback become rejections.  42.2.2 Browsers: Promisifying XMLHttpRequest We have previously seen the event-based XMLHttpRequest API for downloading data in web browsers. The following function promisiﬁes that API:  function httpGet url  {  return new Promise    resolve, reject  => {  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ; xhr.onload =    => {  if  xhr.status === 200  {  resolve xhr.responseText ;     A   } else {     Something went wrong  404, etc.  reject new Error xhr.statusText  ;     B   }  } xhr.onerror =    => {  }; xhr.open 'GET', url ; xhr.send  ;  reject new Error 'Network error'  ;     C   } ;  }  A .  Note how the results and errors of XMLHttpRequest are handled via resolve   and re- ject  :    A successful outcome leads to the returned Promise being fullﬁlled with it  line    An error leads to the Promise being rejected  lines B and C .  This is how to use httpGet  :  httpGet 'http:  example.com textfile.txt'   .then content => {  assert.equal content, 'Content of textfile.txt\n' ;  }  .catch error => {  assert.fail error ;  } ;  Exercise: Timing out a Promise  exercises promises promise_timeout_test.mjs   42.2 Examples  463  42.2.3 Node.js: util.promisify   util.promisify   is a utility function that converts a callback-based function f into a Promise-based one. That is, we are going from this type signature:  f arg_1, ···, arg_n,  err: Error, result: T  => void  : void  To this type signature:  f arg_1, ···, arg_n  : Promise   import * as fs from 'fs'; import {promisify} from 'util';  The following code promisiﬁes the callback-based fs.readFile    line A  and uses it:  const readFileAsync = promisify fs.readFile ;     A   readFileAsync 'some-file.txt', {encoding: 'utf8'}   assert.equal text, 'The content of some-file.txt\n' ;  .then text => {  }  .catch err => {  assert.fail err ;  } ;  Exercises: util.promisify      Using util.promisify  : exercises promises read_file_async_exrc.

Think of it as a Promise-based version of XMLHttpRequest. The following is an excerpt of the API:  interface Body {  text   : Promise ; ···  } interface Response extends Body {  ···  } declare function fetch str  : Promise ;  That means we can use fetch   as follows:  fetch 'http:  example.com textfile.txt'   .then response => response.text      464  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  .then text => {  } ;  assert.equal text, 'Content of textfile.txt\n' ;  Exercise: Using the fetch API  exercises promises fetch_json_test.mjs  42.3 Error handling: don’t mix rejections and exceptions Rule for implementing functions and methods:  Don’t mix  asynchronous  rejections and  synchronous  exceptions.  This makes our synchronous and asynchronous code more predictable and simpler be- cause we can always focus on a single error-handling mechanism. For Promise-based functions and methods, the rule means that they should never throw exceptions. Alas, it is easy to accidentally get this wrong – for example:  The problem is that if an exception is thrown in line A, then asyncFunc   will throw an exception. Callers of that function only expect rejections and are not prepared for an exception. There are three ways in which we can ﬁx this issue. We can wrap the whole body of the function in a try-catch statement and return a re- jected Promise if an exception is thrown:     Don’t do this function asyncFunc   {  doSomethingSync  ;     A  return doSomethingAsync    .then result => {     ···  } ;  }     Solution 1 function asyncFunc   {  try {  doSomethingSync  ; return doSomethingAsync    .then result => {     ···  } ;  } catch  err  {  return Promise.reject err ;  }  }  Given that .then   converts exceptions to rejections, we can execute doSomethingSync   inside a .then   callback. To do so, we start a Promise chain via Promise.resolve  . We   42.4 Promise-based functions start synchronously, settle asynchronously  465  ignore the fulﬁllment value undefined of that initial Promise.     Solution 2 function asyncFunc   {  return Promise.resolve    .then    => {  doSomethingSync  ; return doSomethingAsync  ;  }  .then result => {     ···  } ;  }  }     Solution 3 function asyncFunc   {  return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {  doSomethingSync  ; resolve doSomethingAsync   ;  }  .then result => {     ···  } ;  Lastly, new Promise   also converts exceptions to rejections. Using this constructor is therefore similar to the previous solution:  42.4 Promise-based functions start synchronously, settle  asynchronously  Most Promise-based functions are executed as follows:    Their execution starts right away, synchronously  in the current task .   But the Promise they return is guaranteed to be settled asynchronously  in a later  task  – if ever.  The following code demonstrates that:  function asyncFunc   {  console.log 'asyncFunc' ; return new Promise    resolve, _reject  => {  console.log 'new Promise  ' ; resolve  ;  } ;  } console.log 'START' ; asyncFunc    .then    => {   466  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  console.log '.then  ' ;     A   } ;  console.log 'END' ;     Output:    'START'    'asyncFunc'    'new Promise  '    ' END '    '.then  '  We can see that the callback of new Promise   is executed before the end of the code, while the result is delivered later  line A . Beneﬁts of this approach:    Starting synchronously helps avoid race conditions because we can rely on the order in which Promise-based functions begin. There is an example in the next chapter, where text is written to a ﬁle and race conditions are avoided.    Chaining Promises won’t starve other tasks of processing time because before a Promise is settled, there will always be a break, during which the event loop can run.    Promise-based functions always return results asynchronously; we can be sure that there is never a synchronous return. This kind of predictability makes code easier to work with.  More information on this approach  “Designing APIs for Asynchrony” by Isaac Z. Schlueter  42.5 Promise combinator functions: working with Arrays  of Promises  42.5.1 What is a Promise combinator function? The combinator pattern is a pattern in functional programming for building structures. It is based on two kinds of functions:    Primitive functions  short: primitives  create atomic pieces.   Combinator functions  short: combinators  combine atomic and or compound pieces  to create compound pieces.  When it comes to JavaScript Promises:    Primitive functions include: Promise.resolve  , Promise.reject     Combinators  Promise.race  ,  Promise.all  ,  include:  Promise.allSettled  . In each of these cases:  Promise.any  ,  – Input is an iterable over zero or more Promises.   42.5 Promise combinator functions: working with Arrays of Promises  467  – Output is a single Promise.  Next, we’ll take a closer look at the mentioned Promise combinators.  42.5.2 Promise.all   This is the type signature of Promise.all  :  Promise.all   returns a Promise which is:   Fulﬁlled if all promises are fulﬁlled.  Promise.all  promises: Iterable > : Promise >  – Then its fulﬁllment value is an Array with the fulﬁllment values of promises.    Rejected if at least one Promise is rejected.  – Then its rejection value is the rejection value of that Promise.  This is a quick demo of the output Promise being fulﬁlled:  The following example demonstrates what happens if at least one of the input Promises is rejected:  const promises = [  Promise.resolve 'result a' , Promise.resolve 'result b' , Promise.resolve 'result c' ,  ]; Promise.all promises   .then  arr  => assert.deepEqual   arr, ['result a', 'result b', 'result c']    ;  const promises = [  Promise.resolve 'result a' , Promise.resolve 'result b' , Promise.reject 'ERROR' ,  ]; Promise.all promises   .catch  err  => assert.equal   err, 'ERROR'    ;  Fig. 42.2 illustrates how Promise.all   works.  42.5.2.1 Asynchronous .map   via Promise.all   Array transformation methods such as .map  , .filter  , etc., are made for syn- chronous computations. For example:  function timesTwoSync x  {  return 2 * x;  } const arr = [1, 2, 3];   468  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  Figure 42.2: The Promise combinator Promise.all  .  const result = arr.map timesTwoSync ; assert.deepEqual result, [2, 4, 6] ;  What happens if the callback of .map   is a Promise-based function  a function that maps normal values to Promises ? Then the result of .map   is an Array of Promises. Alas, that is not data that normal code can work with. Thankfully, we can ﬁx that via Promise.all  : It converts an Array of Promises into a Promise that is fulﬁlled with an Array of normal values.  function timesTwoAsync x  {  return new Promise resolve => resolve x * 2  ;  } const arr = [1, 2, 3]; const promiseArr = arr.map timesTwoAsync ; Promise.all promiseArr   .then result => {  assert.deepEqual result, [2, 4, 6] ;  } ;  42.5.2.2 A more realistic .map   example Next, we’ll use .map   and Promise.all   to downlooad text ﬁles from the web. For that, we need the following tool function:  function downloadText url  {  return fetch url   .then  response  => {     A  if  !response.ok  {     B   throw new Error response.statusText ;  } return response.text  ;     C   } ;  }  [  ✓ ✗ v0 r0  ,  ✓ ✗ v1 r1  ,  ···  ]  ∀  ∃  all  ✓  [v0, v1, ···]  ✗ ri   42.5 Promise combinator functions: working with Arrays of Promises  469  downloadText   uses the Promise-based fetch API to download a text ﬁle as a string:    First, it asynchronously retrieves a response  line A .   response.ok  line B  checks if there were errors such as “ﬁle not found”.   If there weren’t any, we use .text    line C  to retrieve the content of the ﬁle as a  string.  In the following example, we download two text ﬁles:  42.5.2.3 A simple implementation of Promise.all   This is a simpliﬁed implementation of Promise.all    e.g., it performs no safety checks :  const urls = [  'http:  example.com first.txt', 'http:  example.com second.txt',  ];  const promises = urls.map   url => downloadText url  ;  Promise.all promises   .then     ;   arr  => assert.deepEqual   arr, ['First!', 'Second!']  function all iterable  {  return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {  let index = 0; for  const promise of iterable  {     Capture the current value of `index` const currentIndex = index; promise.then   value  => {  if  anErrorOccurred  return; result[currentIndex] = value; elementCount++; if  elementCount === result.length  {  resolve result ;  }  },  err  => {  if  anErrorOccurred  return; anErrorOccurred = true; reject err ;  } ;  index++;  } if  index === 0  {   470  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  resolve [] ; return;  } let elementCount = 0; let anErrorOccurred = false; const result = new Array index ;  } ;  }  42.5.3 Promise.race   This is the type signature of Promise.race  :  Promise.race  promises: Iterable > : Promise   Promise.race   returns a Promise q which is settled as soon as the ﬁrst Promise p among promises is settled. q has the same settlement value as p. In the following demo, the settlement of the fulﬁlled Promise  line A  happens before the settlement of the rejected Promise  line B . Therefore, the result is also fulﬁlled  line C .  const promises = [  new Promise  resolve, reject  =>  setTimeout    => resolve 'result' , 100  ,     A   new Promise  resolve, reject  =>  setTimeout    => reject 'ERROR' , 200  ,     B   ]; Promise.race promises   .then  result  => assert.equal      C   result, 'result'  ;  In the next demo, the rejection happens ﬁrst:  const promises = [  new Promise  resolve, reject  =>  setTimeout    => resolve 'result' , 200  ,  new Promise  resolve, reject  =>  setTimeout    => reject 'ERROR' , 100  ,  ]; Promise.race promises   .then    result  => assert.fail  ,  err  => assert.equal   err, 'ERROR'  ;  Note that the Promise returned by Promise.race   is settled as soon as the ﬁrst among its input Promises is settled. That means that the result of Promise.race []  is never settled. Fig. 42.3 illustrates how Promise.race   works.   42.5 Promise combinator functions: working with Arrays of Promises  471  Figure 42.3: The Promise combinator Promise.race  .  42.5.3.1 Using Promise.race   to time out a Promise In this section, we are going to use Promise.race   to time out Promises. The following helper function will be useful several times:  function resolveAfter ms, value=undefined  { return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {  setTimeout    => resolve value , ms ;  resolveAfter   returns a Promise that is resolved with value after ms milliseconds. This function times out a Promise:  function timeout timeoutInMs, promise  {  return Promise.race [  promise, resolveAfter timeoutInMs,  Promise.reject new Error 'Operation timed out'   ,  } ;  }  ] ;  }  timeout   returns a Promise whose settlement is the same as the one of whichever Promise settles ﬁrst among the following two:  1. The parameter promise 2. A Promise that is rejected after timeoutInMs milliseconds  To produce the second Promise, timeout   uses the fact that resolving a pending Promise with a rejected Promise leads to the former being rejected. Let’s see timeout   in action. Here, the input Promise is fulﬁlled before the timeout. Therefore, the output Promise is fulﬁlled.  timeout 200, resolveAfter 100, 'Result!'    [  ✓ ✗ v0 r0  ,  ✓ ✗ v1 r1  ,  ···  ]  1st  1st  race  ✓ vi  ✗ ri   472  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  .then result => assert.equal result, 'Result!'  ;  Here, the timeout happens before the input Promise is fulﬁlled. Therefore, the output Promise is rejected.  timeout 100, resolveAfter 2000, 'Result!'    .catch err => assert.deepEqual err, new Error 'Operation timed out'   ;  It is important to understand what “timing out a Promise” really means:    If the input Promise is settled quickly enough, its settlement is passed on to the  output Promise.    If it isn’t settled quickly enough, the output Promise is rejected.  That is, timing out only prevents the input Promise from affecting the output  since a Promise can only be settled once . But it does not stop the asynchronous operation that produced the input Promise. That is a different subject matter.  42.5.3.2 A simple implementation of Promise.race   This is a simpliﬁed implementation of Promise.race    e.g., it performs no safety checks :  function race iterable  {  return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {  for  const promise of iterable  {  promise.then   value  => {  },  err  => {  if  settlementOccurred  return; settlementOccurred = true; resolve value ;  if  settlementOccurred  return; settlementOccurred = true; reject err ;  } ;  } let settlementOccurred = false;  } ;  }  42.5.4 Promise.any   [ES2021] This is the type signature of Promise.any  :  Promise.any  promises: Iterable > : Promise   Promise.any   returns a Promise p. How it is settled, depends on the parameter promises  which refers to an iterable over Promises :    If and when the ﬁrst Promise is fulﬁlled, p is resolved with that Promise.   42.5 Promise combinator functions: working with Arrays of Promises  473    If all Promises are rejected, p is rejected with an instance of AggregateError that  contains all rejection values.  This is the type signature of AggregateError  a few members were omitted :  class AggregateError {  constructor errors: Iterable , message: string ; get errors  : Array ; get message  : string;  }  Fig. 42.4 illustrates how Promise.any   works.  Figure 42.4: The Promise combinator Promise.any  .  42.5.4.1 Two ﬁrst examples This is what happens if one Promise is fulﬁlled:  const promises = [  Promise.reject 'ERROR A' , Promise.reject 'ERROR B' , Promise.resolve 'result' ,  ]; Promise.any promises   .then  result  => assert.equal   result, 'result'    ;  This is what happens if all Promises are rejected:  const promises = [  Promise.reject 'ERROR A' , Promise.reject 'ERROR B' , Promise.reject 'ERROR C' ,  ]; Promise.any promises   [  ✓ ✗ v0 r0  ,  ✓ ✗ v1 r1  ,  ···  ]  ∃  ∀  any  ✓ vi  ✗  [r0, r1, ···]   474  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  .catch  aggregateError  => assert.deepEqual   aggregateError.errors, ['ERROR A', 'ERROR B', 'ERROR C']    ;  42.5.4.2 Promise.any   vs. Promise.all   There are two ways in which Promise.any   and Promise.all   can be compared:    They are inverses of each other:  – Promise.all  : First input rejection rejects the result Promise or its fulﬁll-  ment value is an Array with input fulﬁllment values.  – Promise.any  : First input fulﬁllment fulﬁlls the result Promise or its rejec-  tion value is an Array with input rejection values.    They have different focuses:  – Promise.all   is interested in all fulﬁllments. The opposite case  at least one  – Promise.any   is interested in the ﬁrst fulﬁllment. The opposite case  only  rejection  leads to a rejection.  rejections  leads to a rejection.  42.5.4.3 Promise.any   vs. Promise.race   Promise.any   and Promise.race   are also related, but interested in different things:   Promise.race   is interested in settlements. The Promise which is settled ﬁrst, “wins”. In other words: We want to know about the asynchronous computation that terminates ﬁrst.    Promise.any   is interested in fulﬁllments. The Promise which is fulﬁlled ﬁrst, “wins”. In other words: We want to know about the asynchronous computation that succeeds ﬁrst.  The main – relatively rare – use case for .race   is timing out Promises. The use cases for .any   are broader. We’ll look at them next.  42.5.4.4 Use cases for Promise.any   We use Promise.any   if we have multiple asynchronous computations and we are only interested in the ﬁrst successful one. In a way, we let the computations compete with each other and use whichever one is fastest. The following code demonstrates what that looks like when downloading resources:  const resource = await Promise.any [  fetch 'http:  example.com first.txt'  .then response => response.text   , fetch 'http:  example.com second.txt'  .then response => response.text   ,  ] ;  The same pattern enables us to use whichever module downloads more quickly:   ] ;  let lodash; try {  } catch {  }  42.5 Promise combinator functions: working with Arrays of Promises  475  const lodash = await Promise.any [  import 'https:  primary.example.com lodash' , import 'https:  secondary.example.com lodash' ,  For comparison, this is the code we’d use if the secondary server is only a fallback – in case the primary server fails:  lodash = await import 'https:  primary.example.com lodash' ;  lodash = await import 'https:  secondary.example.com lodash' ;  42.5.4.5 How would we implement Promise.any  ? A simple implementation of Promise.any   is basically a mirror version of the imple- mentation of Promise.all  .  42.5.5 Promise.allSettled   [ES2020] This time, the type signatures are a little more complicated. Feel free to skip ahead to the ﬁrst demo, which should be easier to understand. This is the type signature of Promise.allSettled  :  Promise.allSettled  promises: Iterable >   : Promise >>  It returns a Promise for an Array whose elements have the following type signature:  type SettlementObject  = FulfillmentObject   RejectionObject;  interface FulfillmentObject  {  status: 'fulfilled'; value: T;  }  }  interface RejectionObject {  status: 'rejected'; reason: unknown;  Promise.allSettled   returns a Promise out. Once all promises are settled, out is ful- ﬁlled with an Array. Each element e of that Array corresponds to one Promise p of promises:    If p is fulﬁlled with the fulﬁllment value v, then e is  { status: 'fulfilled', value:  v }    If p is rejected with the rejection value r, then e is   476  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  { status: 'rejected',  reason: r }  Unless there is an error when iterating over promises, the output Promise out is never rejected. Fig. 42.5 illustrates how Promise.allSettled   works.  Figure 42.5: The Promise combinator Promise.allSettled  .  42.5.5.1 A ﬁrst demo of Promise.allSettled   This is a quick ﬁrst demo of how Promise.allSettled   works:  Promise.allSettled [  Promise.resolve 'a' , Promise.reject 'b' ,  ]  .then arr => assert.deepEqual arr, [  { status: 'fulfilled', value: { status: 'rejected',  'a' }, reason: 'b' },  ]  ;  42.5.5.2 A longer example for Promise.allSettled   The next example is similar to the .map   plus Promise.all   example  from which we are borrowing the function downloadText   : We are downloading multiple text ﬁles whose URLs are stored in an Array. However, this time, we don’t want to stop when there is an error, we want to keep going. Promise.allSettled   allows us to do that:  const urls = [  'http:  example.com exists.txt', 'http:  example.com missing.txt',  ];  const result = Promise.allSettled   [  ✓ ✗ v0 r0  ,  ✓ ✗ v1 r1  ,  ···  ]  xi = { status: 'fulﬁlled', value: vi }  allSettled  ✓  [x0, x1, ···]  ✗  iteration error  xi = { status: 'rejected', reason: ri }   42.5 Promise combinator functions: working with Arrays of Promises  477  42.5.5.3 A simple implementation of Promise.allSettled   This is a simpliﬁed implementation of Promise.allSettled    e.g., it performs no safety checks :  urls.map u => downloadText u   ;  result.then   arr => assert.deepEqual   status: 'fulfilled', value: 'Hello!',  status: 'rejected', reason: new Error 'Not Found' ,  arr, [  {  }, {  },  ]    ;  function allSettled iterable  {  return new Promise  resolve, reject  => { function addElementToResult i, elem  {  result[i] = elem; elementCount++; if  elementCount === result.length  {  resolve result ;  }  }  let index = 0; for  const promise of iterable  {     Capture the current value of `index` const currentIndex = index; promise.then    value  => addElementToResult   currentIndex, {  status: 'fulfilled', value  } ,  currentIndex, {  status: 'rejected', reason   reason  => addElementToResult   }  ; index++;  } if  index === 0  {   478  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  resolve [] ; return;  } let elementCount = 0; const result = new Array index ;  } ;  }  42.5.6 Short-circuiting  advanced  For a Promise combinator, short-circuiting means that the output Promise is settled early – before all input Promises are settled. The following combinators short-circuit:    Promise.all  : The output Promise is rejected as soon as one input Promise is    Promise.race  : The output Promise is settled as soon as one input Promise is    Promise.any  : The output Promise is fulﬁlled as soon as one input Promise is  rejected.  settled.  fulﬁlled.  Once again, settling early does not mean that the operations behind the ignored Promises are stopped. It just means that their settlements are ignored.  42.6 Concurrency and Promise.all    advanced  42.6.1 Sequential execution vs. concurrent execution Consider the following code:  const asyncFunc1 =    => Promise.resolve 'one' ; const asyncFunc2 =    => Promise.resolve 'two' ;  asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {  assert.equal result1, 'one' ; return asyncFunc2  ;  }  .then result2 => {  assert.equal result2, 'two' ;  Using .then   in this manner executes Promise-based functions sequentially: only after the result of asyncFunc1   is settled will asyncFunc2   be executed. Promise.all   helps execute Promise-based functions more concurrently:  Promise.all [asyncFunc1  , asyncFunc2  ]   .then arr => {  assert.deepEqual arr, ['one', 'two'] ;  } ;  } ;   42.6 Concurrency and Promise.all    advanced   479  42.6.2 Concurrency tip: focus on when operations start Tip for determining how “concurrent” asynchronous code is: Focus on when asyn- chronous operations start, not on how their Promises are handled. For example, each of the following functions executes asyncFunc1   and asyncFunc2   concurrently because they are started at nearly the same time.  function concurrentAll   {  return Promise.all [asyncFunc1  , asyncFunc2  ] ;  function concurrentThen   { const p1 = asyncFunc1  ; const p2 = asyncFunc2  ; return p1.then r1 => p2.then r2 => [r1, r2]  ;  On the other hand, both of the following functions execute asyncFunc1   and async- Func2   sequentially: asyncFunc2   is only invoked after the Promise of asyncFunc1   is fulﬁlled.  function sequentialThen   {  return asyncFunc1    .then r1 => asyncFunc2   .then r2 => [r1, r2]  ;  function sequentialAll   { const p1 = asyncFunc1  ; const p2 = p1.then    => asyncFunc2   ; return Promise.all [p1, p2] ;  }  }  }  }  42.6.3 Promise.all   is fork-join Promise.all   is loosely related to the concurrency pattern “fork join”. Let’s revisit an example that we have encountered previously:      A  fork downloadText 'http:  example.com first.txt' , downloadText 'http:  example.com second.txt' ,  Promise.all [  ]      B  join .then    arr  => assert.deepEqual   arr, ['First!', 'Second!']    ;    Fork: In line A, we are forking two asynchronous computations and executing  them concurrently.   480  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]    Join: In line B, we are joining these computations into a single “thread” which is  started once all of them are done.  Computation starts with the Promise returned by asyncFunc  . But afterward, compu- tation continues and another Promise is created via .then  . foo   returns the former Promise, but should return the latter. This is how to ﬁx it:  42.7 Tips for chaining Promises This section gives tips for chaining Promises.  42.7.1 Chaining mistake: losing the tail Problem:     Don’t do this function foo   {  const promise = asyncFunc  ; promise.then result => {     ···  } ;  return promise;  }  function foo   {  const promise = asyncFunc  ; return promise.then result => {     ···  } ;  }  42.7.2 Chaining mistake: nesting Problem:     Don’t do this asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {  return asyncFunc2   .then result2 => {     A      ···  } ;  } ;  asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {  return asyncFunc2  ;  }   The .then   in line A is nested. A ﬂat structure would be better:   481  42.7 Tips for chaining Promises  .then result2 => {     ···  } ;  42.7.3 Chaining mistake: more nesting than necessary This is another example of avoidable nesting:     Don’t do this asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {  if  result1 < 0  {  return asyncFuncA   .then resultA => 'Result: ' + resultA ;  } else {  return asyncFuncB   .then resultB => 'Result: ' + resultB ;  } } ;  } ;  We can once again get a ﬂat structure:  asyncFunc1    .then result1 => {  return result1 < 0 ? asyncFuncA   : asyncFuncB  ;  }  .then resultAB => {  return 'Result: ' + resultAB;  42.7.4 Not all nesting is bad In the following code, we actually beneﬁt from nesting:  db.open    .then connection => {     A   return connection.select { name: 'Jane' }   .then result => {     B      Process result    Use `connection` to make more queries  }     ··· .finally    => {  connection.close  ;     C   } ;  }   We are receiving an asynchronous result in line A. In line B, we are nesting so that we have access to variable connection inside the callback and in line C.   482  42 Promises for asynchronous programming [ES6]  42.7.5 Chaining mistake: creating Promises instead of chaining Problem:     Don’t do this class Model {  insertInto db  {  return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {     A   db.insert this.fields  .then resultCode => {  this.notifyObservers {event: 'created', model: this} ; resolve resultCode ;  } .catch err => {  reject err ;  }   } ;  }    ···  }  }  } ;  }    ···  In line A, we are creating a Promise to deliver the result of db.insert  . That is unnec- essarily verbose and can be simpliﬁed:  class Model {  insertInto db  {  return db.insert this.fields   .then resultCode => {  this.notifyObservers {event: 'created', model: this} ; return resultCode;  The key idea is that we don’t need to create a Promise; we can return the result of the .then   call. An additional beneﬁt is that we don’t need to catch and re-reject the failure of db.insert  . We simply pass its rejection on to the caller of .insertInto  .  42.8 Quick reference: Promise combinator functions Unless noted otherwise, the functionality was introduced in ECMAScript 6  which is when Promises were added to the language . Glossary:    Short-circuiting: In some cases, the output Promise can be settled early  before ev- ery input Promise is settled . More information on how this works is given later.  42.8.1 Promise.all    Promise.all  promises: Iterable >    42.8 Quick reference: Promise combinator functions  483  : Promise >    Fulﬁllment of P: if all input Promises are fulﬁlled.  – Value: Array with the fulﬁllment values of the input Promises    Rejection of P: if one input Promise is rejected. – Value: rejection value of the input Promise    Short-circuits: yes   Use case: processing Arrays with Promises  rejections terminate processing   42.8.2 Promise.race    Promise.race  promises: Iterable >   : Promise     Settlement of P: if the ﬁrst input Promise is settled. – Value: settlement value of the input Promise    Short-circuits: yes   Use case: reacting to the ﬁrst settlement among multiple Promises  42.8.3 Promise.any   [ES2021]  Promise.any  promises: Iterable > : Promise    Fulﬁllment of P: if one input Promise is fulﬁlled. – Value: fulﬁllment value of the input Promise    Rejection of P: if all input Promises are rejected.  – Value: AggregateError that contains the rejection values of the input  Promises.

In order to use async functions, we should therefore understand Promises. They are explained in the previous chapter.  43.1 Async functions: the basics Consider the following async function:  485   486  43 Async functions  async function fetchJsonAsync url  {  try {  const request = await fetch url ;    async const text = await request.text  ;    async return JSON.parse text ;    sync  } catch  error  {  assert.fail error ;  }  }  function fetchJsonViaPromises url  {  return fetch url     async .then request => request.text       async .then text => JSON.parse text      sync .catch error => {  assert.fail error ;  } ;  }  The previous, rather synchronous-looking code is equivalent to the following code that uses Promises directly:  A few observations about the async function fetchJsonAsync  :    Async functions are marked with the keyword async.   Inside the body of an async function, we write Promise-based code as if it were synchronous. We only need to apply the await operator whenever a value is a Promise. That operator pauses the async function and resumes it once the Promise is settled:  – If the Promise is fulﬁlled, await returns the fulﬁllment value. – If the Promise is rejected, await throws the rejection value.    The result of an async function is always a Promise:  – Any value that is returned  explicitly or implicitly  is used to fulﬁll the  Promise.  – Any exception that is thrown is used to reject the Promise.  Both fetchJsonAsync   and fetchJsonViaPromises   are called in exactly the same way, like this:  fetchJsonAsync 'http:  example.com person.json'  .then obj => {  assert.deepEqual obj, {  first: 'Jane', last: 'Doe',  } ;  } ;   43.2 Returning from async functions  487  Async functions are as Promise-based as functions that use Promises di-  rectly From the outside, it is virtually impossible to tell the difference between an async function and a function that returns a Promise.  43.1.1 Async constructs JavaScript has the following async versions of synchronous callable entities. Their roles are always either real function or method.     Async function declaration async function func1   {}     Async function expression const func2 = async function    {};     Async arrow function const func3 = async    => {};     Async method definition in an object literal const obj = { async m   {} };     Async method definition in a class definition class MyClass { async m   {} }  Asynchronous functions vs. async functions  The difference between the terms asynchronous function and async function is subtle, but important:    An asynchronous function is any function that delivers its result asyn- chronously – for example, a callback-based function or a Promise-based function.    An async function is deﬁned via special syntax, involving the keywords async and await. It is also called async await due to these two keywords. Async functions are based on Promises and therefore also asynchronous functions  which is somewhat confusing .  43.2 Returning from async functions 43.2.1 Async functions always return Promises Each async function always returns a Promise. Inside the async function, we fulﬁll the result Promise via return  line A :  async function asyncFunc   {   } ;  } ;  } ;  }  }  43 Async functions  As usual, if we don’t explicitly return anything, undefined is returned for us:  488  }  return 123;     A   asyncFunc   .then result => {  assert.equal result, 123 ;  async function asyncFunc   { }  asyncFunc   .then result => {  assert.equal result, undefined ;  We reject the result Promise via throw  line A :  async function asyncFunc   {  throw new Error 'Problem!' ;     A   asyncFunc   .catch err => {  assert.deepEqual err, new Error 'Problem!'  ;  43.2.2 Returned Promises are not wrapped If we return a Promise p from an async function, then p becomes the result of the function  or rather, the result “locks in” on p and behaves exactly like it . That is, the Promise is not wrapped in yet another Promise. async function asyncFunc   {  return Promise.resolve 'abc' ;  asyncFunc   .then result => assert.equal result, 'abc'  ;  Recall that any Promise q is treated similarly in the following situations:   resolve q  inside new Promise  resolve, reject  => { ··· }    return q inside .then result => { ··· }    return q inside .catch err => { ··· }   43.2.3 Executing async functions: synchronous start, asynchronous  settlement  advanced   Async functions are executed as follows:   43.3 await: working with Promises  489    The Promise p for the result is created when the async function is started.   Then the body is executed. There are two ways in which execution can leave the  body:  – Execution can leave permanently while settling p:  * A return fulﬁlls p. * A throw rejects p.  – Execution can also leave temporarily when awaiting the settlement of an- other Promise q via await. The async function is paused and execution leaves it. It is resumed once q is settled.    Promise p is returned after execution has left the body for the ﬁrst time  perma-  nently or temporarily .  Note that the notiﬁcation of the settlement of the result p happens asynchronously, as is always the case with Promises. The following code demonstrates that an async function is started synchronously  line A , then the current task ﬁnishes  line C , then the result Promise is settled – asynchronously  line B .  async function asyncFunc   {  console.log 'asyncFunc   starts' ;     A  return 'abc';  } asyncFunc  . then x => {     B   console.log `Resolved: ${x}` ;  } ; console.log 'Task ends' ;     C      Output:    'asyncFunc   starts'    'Task ends'    'Resolved: abc'  43.3 await: working with Promises The await operator can only be used inside async functions and async generators  which are explained in §44.2 “Asynchronous generators” . Its operand is usually a Promise and leads to the following steps being performed:    The current async function is paused and returned from. This step is similar to  how yield works in sync generators.    Eventually, the current task is ﬁnished and processing of the task queue continues.   When and if the Promise is settled, the async function is resumed in a new task:  – If the Promise is fulﬁlled, await returns the fulﬁllment value. – If the Promise is rejected, await throws the rejection value.  Read on to ﬁnd out more about how await handles Promises in various states.   490  43 Async functions  43.3.1 await and fulﬁlled Promises If its operand ends up being a fulﬁlled Promise, await returns its fulﬁllment value:  assert.equal await Promise.resolve 'yes!' , 'yes!' ;  Non-Promise values are allowed, too, and simply passed on  synchronously, without pausing the async function :  assert.equal await 'yes!', 'yes!' ;  43.3.2 await and rejected Promises If its operand is a rejected Promise, then await throws the rejection value:  try {  }  await Promise.reject new Error   ; assert.fail  ;    we never get here  } catch  e  {  assert.equal e instanceof Error, true ;  Exercise: Fetch API via async functions  exercises async-functions fetch_json2_test.mjs  43.3.3 await is shallow  we can’t use it in callbacks  If we are inside an async function and want to pause it via await, we must do so directly within that function; we can’t use it inside a nested function, such as a callback. That is, pausing is shallow. For example, the following code can’t be executed:  async function downloadContent urls  {  return urls.map  url  => {  return await httpGet url ;    SyntaxError!  } ;  }  } ;  }  The reason is that normal arrow functions don’t allow await inside their bodies. OK, let’s try an async arrow function then:  async function downloadContent urls  {  return urls.map async  url  => {  return await httpGet url ;  Alas, this doesn’t work either: Now .map    and therefore downloadContent    returns an Array with Promises, not an Array with  unwrapped  values.   43.4  Advanced   491  One possible solution is to use Promise.all   to unwrap all Promises:  async function downloadContent urls  {  const promiseArray = urls.map async  url  => {  return await httpGet url ;     A   } ; return await Promise.all promiseArray ;  Can this code be improved? Yes it can: in line A, we are unwrapping a Promise via await, only to re-wrap it immediately via return. If we omit await, we don’t even need an async arrow function:  }  }  async function downloadContent urls  {  const promiseArray = urls.map   url => httpGet url  ;  return await Promise.all promiseArray ;     B   For the same reason, we can also omit await in line B.  Exercise: Mapping and ﬁltering asynchronously  exercises async-functions map_async_test.mjs   Advanced   43.4 All remaining sections are advanced.  Immediately invoked async arrow functions  43.5 If we need an await outside an async function, we can immediately invoke an async arrow function:   async    => {    start  const promise = Promise.resolve 'abc' ; const value = await promise; assert.equal value, 'abc' ;  }   ;    end  The result of an immediately invoked async arrow function is a Promise:  const promise =  async    => 123   ; promise.then x => assert.equal x, 123  ;  One use case for immediately invoked async arrow functions is using await at the top level of a module  e.g., to download data via fetch   .   492 43.6 Concurrency and await In the next two subsections, we’ll use the helper function paused  :  43 Async functions   ** * Resolves after `ms` milliseconds *  function delay ms  {  return new Promise  resolve, _reject  => {  setTimeout resolve, ms ;  } ;  } async function paused id  {  console.log 'START ' + id ; await delay 10 ;    pause console.log 'END ' + id ; return id;  }  }  async function sequentialAwait   {  const result1 = await paused 'first' ; assert.equal result1, 'first' ;  const result2 = await paused 'second' ; assert.equal result2, 'second' ;     Output:    'START first'    ' END first'    'START second'    ' END second'  43.6.1 await: running asynchronous functions sequentially If we preﬁx the invocations of multiple asynchronous functions with await, then those functions are executed sequentially:  That is, paused 'second'  is only started after paused 'first'  is completely ﬁnished.  43.6.2 await: running asynchronous functions concurrently If we want to run multiple functions concurrently, we can use the tool method Promise.all  :  async function concurrentPromiseAll   {  const result = await Promise.all [ paused 'first' , paused 'second'   ] ; assert.deepEqual result, ['first', 'second'] ;   43.7 Tips for using async functions  493  }     Output:    'START first'    'START second'    ' END first'    ' END second'  Here, both asynchronous functions are started at the same time. Once both are settled, await gives us either an Array of fulﬁllment values or – if at least one Promise is rejected – an exception. Recall from §42.6.2 “Concurrency tip: focus on when operations start” that what counts is when we start a Promise-based computation; not how we process its result. Therefore, the following code is as “concurrent” as the previous one:  async function concurrentAwait   {  const resultPromise1 = paused 'first' ; const resultPromise2 = paused 'second' ;  assert.equal await resultPromise1, 'first' ; assert.equal await resultPromise2, 'second' ;  }    Output:    'START first'    'START second'    ' END first'    ' END second'  43.7 Tips for using async functions 43.7.1 We don’t need await if we “ﬁre and forget” await is not required when working with a Promise-based function; we only need it if we want to pause and wait until the returned Promise is settled. If we only want to start an asynchronous operation, then we don’t need it:  async function asyncFunc   {  const writer = openFile 'someFile.txt' ; writer.write 'hello' ;    don’t wait writer.write 'world' ;    don’t wait await writer.close  ;    wait for file to close  }  In this code, we don’t await .write   because we don’t care when it is ﬁnished. We do, however, want to wait until .close   is done. Note: Each invocation of .write   starts synchronously. That prevents race conditions.   494  43 Async functions  It can make sense to await and ignore the result  43.7.2 It can occasionally make sense to use await, even if we ignore its result – for example:  await longRunningAsyncOperation  ; console.log 'Done!' ;  Here, we are using await to join a long-running asynchronous operation. That ensures that the logging really happens after that operation is done.

It comprises the following interfaces:  495   496  44 Asynchronous iteration  interface Iterable  {  [Symbol.iterator]   : Iterator ;  } interface Iterator  {  next   : IteratorResult ;  } interface IteratorResult  {  value: T; done: boolean;  }   An Iterable is a data structure whose contents can be accessed via iteration. It is    An Iterator is a factory for iteration results that we retrieve by calling the method  a factory for iterators.  .next  .    Each IterationResult contains the iterated .value and a boolean .done that is  true after the last element and false before.  For the protocol for asynchronous iteration, we only want to change one thing: the values produced by .next   should be delivered asynchronously. There are two conceivable options:    The .value could contain a Promise .   .next   could return Promise >.  In other words, the question is whether to wrap just values or whole iterator results in Promises. It has to be the latter because when .next   returns a result, it starts an asynchronous computation. Whether or not that computation produces a value or signals the end of the iteration can only be determined after it is ﬁnished. Therefore, both .done and .value need to be wrapped in a Promise. The interfaces for async iteration look as follows.  interface AsyncIterable  {  [Symbol.asyncIterator]   : AsyncIterator ;  } interface AsyncIterator  {  } interface IteratorResult  {  next   : Promise >;     A   value: T; done: boolean;  }  The only difference to the synchronous interfaces is the return type of .next    line A .  44.1.2 Using async iteration directly The following code uses the asynchronous iteration protocol directly:   44.1 Basic asynchronous iteration  497  const asyncIterable = syncToAsyncIterable ['a', 'b'] ;     A  const asyncIterator = asyncIterable[Symbol.asyncIterator]  ;     Call .next   until .done is true: asyncIterator.next       B  .then iteratorResult => {  assert.deepEqual  iteratorResult, { value: 'a', done: false } ;  return asyncIterator.next  ;     C   }  .then iteratorResult => {  assert.deepEqual  iteratorResult, { value: 'b', done: false } ;  return asyncIterator.next  ;     D   }  .then iteratorResult => {  assert.deepEqual  iteratorResult, { value: undefined, done: true } ;  }  ;  }  In line A, we create an asynchronous iterable over the value 'a' and 'b'. We’ll see an implementation of syncToAsyncIterable   later.  We call .next   in line B, line C and line D. Each time, we use .next   to unwrap the Promise and assert.deepEqual   to check the unwrapped value.  We can simplify this code if we use an async function. Now we unwrap Promises via await and the code looks almost like we are doing synchronous iteration:  async function f   {  const asyncIterable = syncToAsyncIterable ['a', 'b'] ; const asyncIterator = asyncIterable[Symbol.asyncIterator]  ;     Call .next   until .done is true: assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterator.next  , { value: 'a', done: false } ;  assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterator.next  , { value: 'b', done: false } ;  assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterator.next  , { value: undefined, done: true } ;   498  44 Asynchronous iteration  44.1.3 Using async iteration via for-await-of The asynchronous iteration protocol is not meant to be used directly. One of the language constructs that supports it is the for-await-of loop, which is an asynchronous version of the for-of loop. It can be used in async functions and async generators  which are introduced later in this chapter . This is an example of for-await-of in use:  for await  const x of syncToAsyncIterable ['a', 'b']   {  for-await-of is relatively ﬂexible. In addition to asynchronous iterables, it also supports synchronous iterables:  for await  const x of ['a', 'b']  {  console.log x ;  And it supports synchronous iterables over values that are wrapped in Promises:  const arr = [Promise.resolve 'a' , Promise.resolve 'b' ]; for await  const x of arr  {  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'a'    'b'  }    Output:    'a'    'b'  console.log x ;  }    Output:    'a'    'b'  Exercise: Convert an async iterable to an Array  Warning: We’ll soon see the solution for this exercise in this chapter.    exercises async-iteration async_iterable_to_array_test.mjs  44.2 Asynchronous generators An asynchronous generator is two things at the same time:    An async function  input : We can use await and for-await-of to retrieve data.   A generator that returns an asynchronous iterable  output : We can use yield and  yield* to produce data.  Asynchronous generators are very similar to synchronous generators   44.2 Asynchronous generators  499  Due to async generators and sync generators being so similar, I don’t explain how exactly yield and yield* work. Please consult §40 “Synchronous generators” if you have doubts.  Therefore, an asynchronous generator has:    Input that can be:  – synchronous  single values, sync iterables  or – asynchronous  Promises, async iterables .    Output that is an asynchronous iterable.  This looks as follows:  async function* asyncGen   {     Input: Promises, async iterables const x = await somePromise; for await  const y of someAsyncIterable  {     ···  }     Output yield someValue; yield* otherAsyncGen  ;  }  }  }  44.2.1 Example: creating an async iterable via an async generator Let’s look at an example. The following code creates an async iterable with three num- bers:  async function* yield123   { for  let i=1; i<=3; i++  {  yield i;  Does the result of yield123   conform to the async iteration protocol?   async    => {  const asyncIterable = yield123  ; const asyncIterator = asyncIterable[Symbol.asyncIterator]  ; assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterator.next  , { value: 1, done: false } ;  assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterator.next  , { value: 2, done: false } ;  assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterator.next  , { value: 3, done: false } ;   500  44 Asynchronous iteration  assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterator.next  , { value: undefined, done: true } ;  }   ;  We wrapped the code in an immediately invoked async arrow function.  44.2.2 Example: converting a sync iterable to an async iterable The following asynchronous generator converts a synchronous iterable to an asyn- chronous iterable. It implements the function syncToAsyncIterable   that we have used previously.  async function* syncToAsyncIterable syncIterable  {  for  const elem of syncIterable  {  yield elem;  }  }  Note: The input is synchronous in this case  no await is needed .  44.2.3 Example: converting an async iterable to an Array The following function is a solution to a previous exercise. It converts an async iterable to an Array  think spreading, but for async iterables instead of sync iterables .  async function asyncIterableToArray asyncIterable  {  const result = []; for await  const value of asyncIterable  {  result.push value ;  } return result;  }  Note that we can’t use an async generator in this case: We get our input via for-await- of and return an Array wrapped in a Promise. The latter requirement rules out async generators. This is a test for asyncIterableToArray  :  async function* createAsyncIterable   {  yield 'a'; yield 'b';  } const asyncIterable = createAsyncIterable  ; assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterableToArray asyncIterable ,     A  ['a', 'b']   ;  Note the await in line A, which is needed to unwrap the Promise returned by asyncIt- erableToArray  . In order for await to work, this code fragment must be run inside an   44.2 Asynchronous generators  async function.  501  44.2.4 Example: transforming an async iterable Let’s implement an async generator that produces a new async iterable by transforming an existing async iterable.  async function* timesTwo asyncNumbers  { for await  const x of asyncNumbers  {  yield x * 2;  }  }   ;  To test this function, we use asyncIterableToArray   from the previous section.  async function* createAsyncIterable   {  for  let i=1; i<=3; i++  {  yield i;  }  } assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterableToArray timesTwo createAsyncIterable    , [2, 4, 6]  Exercise: Async generators  Warning: We’ll soon see the solution for this exercise in this chapter.    exercises async-iteration number_lines_test.mjs  44.2.5 Example: mapping over asynchronous iterables As a reminder, this is how to map over synchronous iterables:  function* mapSync iterable, func  {  let index = 0; for  const x of iterable  {  yield func x, index ; index++;  }  } const syncIterable = mapSync ['a', 'b', 'c'], s => s.repeat 3  ; assert.deepEqual   [...syncIterable], ['aaa', 'bbb', 'ccc'] ;  The asynchronous version looks as follows:  async function* mapAsync asyncIterable, func  {     A   let index = 0;   502  }  }  for await  const x of asyncIterable  {     B   yield func x, index ; index++;  44 Asynchronous iteration  Note how similar the sync implementation and the async implementation are. The only two differences are the async in line A and the await in line B. That is comparable to going from a synchronous function to an asynchronous function – we only need to add the keyword async and the occasional await. To test mapAsync  , we use the helper function asyncIterableToArray    shown earlier in this chapter :  async function* createAsyncIterable   {  yield 'a'; yield 'b';  } const mapped = mapAsync   createAsyncIterable  , s => s.repeat 3  ;  assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterableToArray mapped ,     A  ['aaa', 'bbb'] ;  Once again, we await to unwrap a Promise  line A  and this code fragment must run inside an async function.  Exercise: filterAsyncIter    exercises async-iteration filter_async_iter_test.mjs  44.3 Async iteration over Node.js streams 44.3.1 Node.js streams: async via callbacks  push  Traditionally, reading asynchronously from Node.js streams is done via callbacks:  function main inputFilePath  {  const readStream = fs.createReadStream inputFilePath,  { encoding: 'utf8', highWaterMark: 1024 } ;  readStream.on 'data',  chunk  => {  console.log '>>> '+chunk ;  } ; readStream.on 'end',    => {  console.log ' DONE ' ;  } ;  }  That is, the stream is in control and pushes data to the reader.   44.3 Async iteration over Node.js streams  503  44.3.2 Node.js streams: async via async iteration  pull  Starting with Node.js 10, we can also use asynchronous iteration to read from streams:  async function main inputFilePath  {  const readStream = fs.createReadStream inputFilePath,  { encoding: 'utf8', highWaterMark: 1024 } ;  for await  const chunk of readStream  {  console.log '>>> '+chunk ;  } console.log ' DONE ' ;  }  This time, the reader is in control and pulls data from the stream.  44.3.3 Example: from chunks to lines Node.js streams iterate over chunks  arbitrarily long pieces  of data. The following asyn- chronous generator converts an async iterable over chunks to an async iterable over lines:   ** * Parameter: async iterable of chunks  strings  * Result: async iterable of lines  incl. newlines  *  async function* chunksToLines chunksAsync  {  let previous = ''; for await  const chunk of chunksAsync  {    input  previous += chunk; let eolIndex; while   eolIndex = previous.indexOf '\n'   >= 0  {     line includes the EOL  Windows '\r\n' or Unix '\n'  const line = previous.slice 0, eolIndex+1 ; yield line;    output previous = previous.slice eolIndex+1 ;  } if  previous.length > 0  {  yield previous;  }  }  }  Let’s apply chunksToLines   to an async iterable over chunks  as produced by chunkIt- erable   :  async function* chunkIterable   {  yield 'First\nSec'; yield 'ond\nThird\nF'; yield 'ourth';  } const linesIterable = chunksToLines chunkIterable   ;   504  44 Asynchronous iteration  assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterableToArray linesIterable , [  'First\n', 'Second\n', 'Third\n', 'Fourth',  ] ;  Now that we have an asynchronous iterable over lines, we can use the solution of a previous exercise, numberLines  , to number those lines:  async function* numberLines linesAsync  {  let lineNumber = 1; for await  const line of linesAsync  {  yield lineNumber + ': ' + line; lineNumber++;  }  } const numberedLines = numberLines chunksToLines chunkIterable    ; assert.deepEqual   await asyncIterableToArray numberedLines , [  '1: First\n', '2: Second\n', '3: Third\n', '4: Fourth',  ] ;   Part IX  More standard library  505    Regular expressions  RegExp   Chapter 45  Contents  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  45.3 Flags .  45.2 Syntax .  . . . . . . . . . . . . 45.3.1 Flag: Unicode mode via  u .  . . . . . . . . 45.2.1 Syntax characters . . 45.2.2 Basic atoms . . . . . . 45.2.3 Unicode property escapes [ES2018] . . 45.2.4 Character classes . . . . . . . . . 45.2.5 Groups . . . . . . . . 45.2.6 Quantiﬁers . . . . . 45.2.7 Assertions . . . 45.2.8 Disjunction    . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45.4 Properties of regular expression objects . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45.5 Methods for working with regular expressions .  . 45.1 Creating regular expressions 45.1.1 Literal vs. constructor . . 45.1.2 Cloning and non-destructively modifying regular expressions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45.5.1 By default, regular expressions match anywhere in a string . 45.5.2 regExp.test str : is there a match?

The ﬂags u and i. Flags conﬁgure how the pattern is interpreted. For example, i enables case-insensitive matching. A list of available ﬂags is given later in this chapter.  45.1.2 Cloning and non-destructively modifying regular expressions There are two variants of the constructor RegExp  :    new RegExp pattern : string, flags = ''  [ES3]  A new regular expression is created as speciﬁed via pattern. If flags is missing, the empty string '' is used.    new RegExp regExp : RegExp, flags = regExp.flags  [ES6]  regExp is cloned. If flags is provided, then it determines the ﬂags of the clone.  The second variant is useful for cloning regular expressions, optionally while modifying them. Flags are immutable and this is the only way of changing them – for example:   45.2 Syntax  509  function copyAndAddFlags regExp, flagsToAdd=''  {     The constructor doesn’t allow duplicate flags;    make sure there aren’t any: const newFlags = [...new Set regExp.flags + flagsToAdd ].join '' ; return new RegExp regExp, newFlags ;  } assert.equal  abc i.flags, 'i' ; assert.equal copyAndAddFlags  abc i, 'g' .flags, 'gi' ;  45.2 Syntax 45.2.1 Syntax characters At the top level of a regular expression, the following syntax characters are special. They are escaped by preﬁxing a backslash  \ .  \ ^ $ . * + ?     [ ] { }   In regular expression literals, we must escape slashs:  In the argument of new RegExp  , we don’t have to escape slashes:  >  \  .test ' '  true  > new RegExp ' ' .test ' '  true  45.2.2 Basic atoms Atoms are the basic building blocks of regular expressions.    Pattern characters are all characters except syntax characters  ^, $, etc. . Pattern char-  acters match themselves. Examples: A b %    . matches any character. We can use the ﬂag  s  dotAll  to control if the dot  matches line terminators or not  more below .    Character escapes  each escape matches a single ﬁxed character :  – Control escapes  for a few control characters :  * \f: form feed  FF  * \n: line feed  LF  * \r: carriage return  CR  * \t: character tabulation * \v: line tabulation  – Arbitrary control characters: \cA  Ctrl-A , …, \cZ  Ctrl-Z  – Unicode code units: \u00E4 – Unicode code points  require ﬂag  u : \u{1F44D}    Character class escapes  each escape matches one out of a set of characters :  – \d: digits  same as [0-9]   * \D: non-digits  gramming languages   – \w: “word” characters  same as [A-Za-z0-9_], related to identiﬁers in pro-   510  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   – \s: whitespace  space, tab, line terminators, etc.   * \W: non-word characters * \S: non-whitespace * Require ﬂag  u. * Described in the next subsection.  – Unicode property escapes [ES2018]: \p{White_Space}, \P{White_Space}, etc.  45.2.3 Unicode property escapes [ES2018] 45.2.3.1 Unicode character properties In the Unicode standard, each character has properties – metadata describing it. Proper- ties play an important role in deﬁning the nature of a character. Quoting the Unicode Standard, Sect. 3.3, D3:  The semantics of a character are determined by its identity, normative prop- erties, and behavior.  These are a few examples of properties:    Name: a unique name, composed of uppercase letters, digits, hyphens, and spaces  – for example:  – A: Name = LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A – ☺: Name = SLIGHTLY SMILING FACE    General_Category: categorizes characters – for example:  – x: General_Category = Lowercase_Letter – $: General_Category = Currency_Symbol    White_Space: used for marking invisible spacing characters, such as spaces, tabs  and newlines – for example: – \t: White_Space = True – π: White_Space = False    Age: version of the Unicode Standard in which a character was introduced – for  example: The Euro sign € was added in version 2.1 of the Unicode standard.    Block: a contiguous range of code points. Blocks don’t overlap and their names  – €: Age = 2.1  are unique. For example:  – S: Block = Basic_Latin  range U+0000..U+007F  – ☺: Block = Emoticons  range U+1F600..U+1F64F     Script: is a collection of characters used by one or more writing systems.  – Some scripts support several writing systems. For example, the Latin script  supports the writing systems English, French, German, Latin, etc.  – Some languages can be written in multiple alternate writing systems that are supported by multiple scripts. For example, Turkish used the Arabic script before it transitioned to the Latin script in the early 20th century.  – Examples:  * α: Script = Greek * Д: Script = Cyrillic   45.2 Syntax  45.2.3.2 Unicode property escapes Unicode property escapes look like this:  511  value is value.  Comments:  the same as p.  1. \p{prop=value}: matches all characters whose property prop has the value value. 2. \P{prop=value}: matches all characters that do not have a property prop whose  3. \p{bin_prop}: matches all characters whose binary property bin_prop is True. 4. \P{bin_prop}: matches all characters whose binary property bin_prop is False.    We can only use Unicode property escapes if the ﬂag  u is set. Without  u, \p is    Forms  3  and  4  can be used as abbreviations if the property is General_Category.  For example, the following two escapes are equivalent:  \p{Lowercase_Letter} \p{General_Category=Lowercase_Letter}  Examples:    Checking for whitespace:  >  ^\p{White_Space}+$ u.test '\t \n\r'  true    Checking for Greek letters:  >  ^\p{Script=Greek}+$ u.test 'μετά'  true    Deleting any letters:  > '1π2ü3é4'.replace  \p{Letter} ug, ''  '1234'    Deleting lowercase letters:  > 'AbCdEf'.replace  \p{Lowercase_Letter} ug, ''  'ACE' Further reading:    Lists of Unicode properties and their values: “Unicode Standard Annex 44: Uni- code Character Database”  Editors: Mark Davis, Laurențiu Iancu, Ken Whistler   45.2.4 Character classes A character class wraps class ranges in square brackets. The class ranges specify a set of characters:    [«class ranges»] matches any character in the set.   [^«class ranges»] matches any character not in the set.  Rules for class ranges:   512  45 Regular expressions  RegExp     Non-syntax characters stand for themselves: [abc]   Only the following four characters are special and must be escaped via slashes:  ^ \ - ]  – ^ only has to be escaped if it comes ﬁrst. – - need not be escaped if it comes ﬁrst or last.    Character escapes  \n, \u{1F44D}, etc.  have the usual meaning.  – Watch out: \b stands for backspace. Elsewhere in a regular expression, it  matches word boundaries.    Character class escapes  \d, \p{White_Space}, etc.  have the usual meaning.   Ranges of characters are speciﬁed via dashes: [a-z]  45.2.5 Groups    Positional capture group:  +  – Backreference: \1, \2, etc.    Named capture group [ES2018]:  ? +   – Backreference: \k     Noncapturing group:  ?:+   45.2.6 Quantiﬁers By default, all of the following quantiﬁers are greedy  they match as many characters as possible :  To make them reluctant  so that they match as few characters as possible , put question marks  ?  after them:    ?: match never or once   *: match zero or more times   +: match one or more times   {n}: match n times   {n,}: match n or more times   {n,m}: match at least n times, at most m times.  >  ".*" .exec '"abc"def"' [0] '"abc"def"' >  ".*?" .exec '"abc"def"' [0]    reluctant '"abc"'     greedy  45.2.7 Assertions    ^ matches only at the beginning of the input   $ matches only at the end of the input   \b matches only at a word boundary  – \B matches only when not at a word boundary   45.3 Flags  513  45.2.7.1 Lookahead assertions Positive lookahead:  ?=«pattern»  matches if pattern matches what comes next. Example: sequences of lowercase letters that are followed by an X.  > 'abcX def'.match  [a-z]+ ?=X  g  [ 'abc' ]  Note that the X itself is not part of the matched substring. Negative lookahead:  ?!«pattern»  matches if pattern does not match what comes next. Example: sequences of lowercase letters that are not followed by an X.  > 'abcX def'.match  [a-z]+ ?!X  g  [ 'ab', 'def' ]  45.2.7.2 Lookbehind assertions [ES2018] Positive lookbehind:  ?<=«pattern»  matches if pattern matches what came before. Example: sequences of lowercase letters that are preceded by an X.  > 'Xabc def'.match   ?<=X [a-z]+ g  [ 'abc' ]  Negative lookbehind:  ?<!«pattern»  matches if pattern does not match what came before. Example: sequences of lowercase letters that are not preceded by an X.  > 'Xabc def'.match   ?<!X [a-z]+ g  [ 'bc', 'def' ]  Example: replace “.js” with “.html”, but not in “Node.js”.  > 'Node.js: index.js and main.js'.replace   ?<!Node \.js g, '.html'  'Node.js: index.html and main.html'  45.2.8 Disjunction    Caveat: this operator has low precedence. Use groups if necessary:    ^aazz$ matches all strings that start with aa and or end with zz. Note that  has  a lower precedence than ^ and $.    ^ aazz $ matches the two strings 'aa' and 'zz'.   ^a az z$ matches the two strings 'aaz' and 'azz'.  45.3 Flags   514  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   Table 45.1: These are the regular expression ﬂags supported by JavaScript.  Literal ﬂag g i m s u y  Property name global ignoreCase multiline dotAll unicode sticky  Description Match multiple times Match case-insensitively ^ and $ match per line  ES ES3 ES3 ES3 ES2018 Dot matches line terminators ES6 ES6  Unicode mode  recommended  No characters between matches  The following regular expression ﬂags are available in JavaScript  tbl. 45.1 provides a compact overview :     g  .global : fundamentally changes how the following methods work.  – RegExp.prototype.test   – RegExp.prototype.exec   – String.prototype.match    How, is explained in §45.6.1 “The ﬂags  g and  y”. In a nutshell, without  g, the methods only consider the ﬁrst match for a regular expression in an input string. With  g, they consider all matches.     i  .ignoreCase : switches on case-insensitive matching:     m  .multiline : If this ﬂag is on, ^ matches the beginning of each line and $ matches the end of each line. If it is off, ^ matches the beginning of the whole input string and $ matches the end of the whole input string.  >  a .test 'A'  false >  a i.test 'A'  true  > 'a1\na2\na3'.match  ^a. gm  [ 'a1', 'a2', 'a3' ] > 'a1\na2\na3'.match  ^a. g  [ 'a1' ]     u  .unicode : This ﬂag switches on the Unicode mode for a regular expression.  That mode is explained in the next subsection.     y  .sticky : This ﬂag mainly makes sense in conjunction with  g. When both are switched on, any match must directly follow the previous one  that is, it must start at index .lastIndex of the regular expression object . Therefore, the ﬁrst match must be at index 0.  > 'a1a2 a3'.match  a. gy  [ 'a1', 'a2' ] > '_a1a2 a3'.match  a. gy     first match must be at index 0   515  45.3 Flags  null  > 'a1a2 a3'.match  a. g  [ 'a1', 'a2', 'a3' ] > '_a1a2 a3'.match  a. g  [ 'a1', 'a2', 'a3' ]  it does:  >  . .test '\n'  false >  . s.test '\n'  true  >  [^] .test '\n'  true  The main use case for  y is tokenization  during parsing .     s  .dotAll : By default, the dot does not match line terminators. With this ﬂag,  Workaround if  s isn’t supported: Use [^] instead of a dot.  45.3.1 Flag: Unicode mode via  u The ﬂag  u switches on a special Unicode mode for regular expressions. That mode enables several features:    In patterns, we can use Unicode code point escapes such as \u{1F42A} to specify characters. Code unit escapes such as \u03B1 only have a range of four hexadeci- mal digits  which corresponds to the basic multilingual plane .    In patterns, we can use Unicode property escapes such as \p{White_Space}.   Many escapes are now forbidden. For example: \a \- \:  Pattern characters always match themselves:  >  pa-: .test 'pa-:'  true  Without  u, there are some pattern characters that still match themselves if we escape them with backslashes:  >  \p\a\-\: .test 'pa-:'  true With  u:  – \p starts a Unicode property escape. – The remaining “self-matching” escapes are forbidden. As a consequence,  they can now be used for new features in the future.    The atomic units for matching are Unicode characters  code points , not JavaScript  characters  code units .   516  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   The following subsections explain the last item in more detail. They use the following Unicode character to explain when the atomic units are Unicode characters and when they are JavaScript characters: const codePoint = '☺'; const codeUnits = '\uD83D\uDE42';    UTF-16  assert.equal codePoint, codeUnits ;    same string!  I’m only switching between ☺ and \uD83D\uDE42, to illustrate how JavaScript sees things. Both are equivalent and can be used interchangeably in strings and regular expressions.  45.3.1.1 Consequence: we can put Unicode characters in character classes With  u, the two code units of ☺ are treated as a single character:  >  ^[☺]$ u.test '☺'  true  Without  u, ☺ is treated as two characters:  >  ^[\uD83D\uDE42]$ .test '\uD83D\uDE42'  false >  ^[\uD83D\uDE42]$ .test '\uDE42'  true  Note that ^ and $ demand that the input string have a single character. That’s why the ﬁrst result is false.  45.3.1.2 Consequence:  the dot operator  .  matches Unicode characters, not  JavaScript characters  With  u, the dot operator matches Unicode characters:  > '☺'.match  . gu .length 1  .match   plus  g returns an Array with all the matches of a regular expression. Without  u, the dot operator matches JavaScript characters:  > '\uD83D\uDE80'.match  . g .length 2  45.3.1.3 Consequence: quantiﬁers apply to Unicode characters, not JavaScript char-  acters  With  u, a quantiﬁer applies to the whole preceding Unicode character:  >  ^☺{3}$ u.test '☺☺☺'  true  Without  u, a quantiﬁer only applies to the preceding JavaScript character:   45.4 Properties of regular expression objects  517  >  ^\uD83D\uDE80{3}$ .test '\uD83D\uDE80\uDE80\uDE80'  true  45.4 Properties of regular expression objects Noteworthy:    Strictly speaking, only .lastIndex is a real instance property. All other properties  are implemented via getters.    Accordingly, .lastIndex is the only mutable property. All other properties are read-only. If we want to change them, we need to copy the regular expression  consult §45.1.2 “Cloning and non-destructively modifying regular expressions” for details .  45.4.1 Flags as properties Each regular expression ﬂag exists as a property with a longer, more descriptive name:  This is the complete list of ﬂag properties:  >  a i.ignoreCase true >  a .ignoreCase false    .dotAll   s    .global   g    .ignoreCase   i    .multiline   m    .sticky   y    .unicode   u   45.4.2 Other properties Each regular expression also has the following properties:    .source [ES3]: The regular expression pattern    .flags [ES6]: The ﬂags of the regular expression  >  abc ig.source 'abc'  >  abc ig.flags 'gi'  and  y” for details.    .lastIndex [ES3]: Used when ﬂag  g is switched on. Consult §45.6.1 “The ﬂags  g   518 45.5 Methods for working with regular expressions 45.5.1 By default, regular expressions match anywhere in a string By default, regular expressions match anywhere in a string:  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   We can change that by using assertions such as ^ or by using the ﬂag  y:  45.5.2 regExp.test str : is there a match? [ES3] The regular expression method .test   returns true if regExp matches str:  >  a .test '__a__'  true  >  ^a .test '__a__'  false >  ^a .test 'a__'  true  >  bc .test 'ABCD'  false >  bc i.test 'ABCD'  true >  \.mjs$ .test 'main.mjs'  true  > const r =  a g; > r.test 'aab'  true > r.test 'aab'  true > r.test 'aab'  false  With .test   we should normally avoid the  g ﬂag. If we use it, we generally don’t get the same result every time we call the method:  The results are due to  a  having two matches in the string. After all of those were found, .test   returns false.  45.5.3 str.search regExp : at what index is the match? [ES3] The string method .search   returns the ﬁrst index of str at which there is a match for regExp:  > '_abc_'.search  abc   1 > 'main.mjs'.search  \.mjs$   4   45.5 Methods for working with regular expressions  519  45.5.4 regExp.exec str : capturing groups [ES3] 45.5.4.1 Getting a match object for the ﬁrst match Without the ﬂag  g, .exec   returns the captures of the ﬁrst match for regExp in str:  The result is a match object with the following properties:    [0]: the complete substring matched by the regular expression   [1]: capture of positional group 1  etc.    .index: where did the match occur?   .input: the string that was matched against   .groups: captures of named groups  45.5.4.2 Named capture groups [ES2018] The previous example contained a single positional group. The following example demonstrates named groups:  assert.deepEqual     a+ b .exec 'ab aab' , {  0: 'ab', 1: 'a', index: 0, input: 'ab aab', groups: undefined,  }   ;  assert.deepEqual     ? a+ b .exec 'ab aab' , {  0: 'ab', 1: 'a', index: 0, input: 'ab aab', groups: { as: 'a' },  }   ;  In the result of .exec  , we can see that a named group is also a positional group – its capture exists twice:    Once as a positional capture  property '1' .   Once as a named capture  property groups.as .  45.5.4.3 Looping over all matches  Better alternative for retrieving all matches: str.matchAll regExp  [ES2020]   520  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   Since ECMAScript 2020, JavaScript has another method for retrieving all matches: str.matchAll regExp . This method is easier to use and has fewer caveats.  If we want to retrieve all matches of a regular expression  not just the ﬁrst one , we need to switch on the ﬂag  g. Then we can call .exec   multiple times and get one match each time. After the last match, .exec   returns null.  > const regExp =   a+ b g; > regExp.exec 'ab aab'  { 0: 'ab', 1: 'a', index: 0, input: 'ab aab', groups: undefined } > regExp.exec 'ab aab'  { 0: 'aab', 1: 'aa', index: 3, input: 'ab aab', groups: undefined } > regExp.exec 'ab aab'  null  Therefore, we can loop over all matches as follows:  const regExp =   a+ b g; const str = 'ab aab';  let match;    Check for null via truthiness    Alternative: while   match = regExp.exec str   !== null  while  match = regExp.exec str   {  console.log match[1] ;  }    Output:    'a'    'aa'  Be careful when sharing regular expressions with  g!  Sharing regular expressions with  g has a few pitfalls, which are explained later.  Exercise: Extracting quoted text via .exec    exercises regexps extract_quoted_test.mjs  45.5.5 str.match regExp : getting all group 0 captures [ES3] Without  g, .match   works like .exec   – it returns a single match object. With  g, .match   returns all substrings of str that match regExp:  > 'ab aab'.match   a+ b g  [ 'ab', 'aab' ]  If there is no match, .match   returns null:   45.5 Methods for working with regular expressions  521  > 'xyz'.match   a+ b g  null  We can use the nullish coalescing operator  ??  to protect ourselves against null:  const numberOfMatches =  str.match regExp  ?? [] .length;  45.5.6 str.matchAll regExp : getting an iterable over all match ob-  jects [ES2020]  This is how .matchAll   is invoked:  const matchIterable = str.matchAll regExp ;  Given a string and a regular expression, .matchAll   returns an iterable over the match objects of all matches. We can also use the spread operator  ...  to convert the iterable to an Array:  > [...'-a-a-a'.matchAll  - a  ug ] [  { 0:'-a', 1:'a', index: 0, input: '-a-a-a', groups: undefined }, { 0:'-a', 1:'a', index: 2, input: '-a-a-a', groups: undefined }, { 0:'-a', 1:'a', index: 4, input: '-a-a-a', groups: undefined },  ]  Flag  g must be set:  > [...'-a-a-a'.matchAll  - a  u ] TypeError: String.prototype.matchAll called with a non-global RegExp argument  .matchAll   isn’t affected by regExp.lastIndex and doesn’t change it.  Implementing .matchAll    45.5.6.1 .matchAll   could be implemented via .exec   as follows:  function* matchAll str, regExp  {  if  !regExp.global  {  throw new TypeError 'Flag  g must be set!' ;  } const localCopy = new RegExp regExp, regExp.flags ; let match; while  match = localCopy.exec str   {  yield match;  }  }  Making a local copy ensures two things:    regex.lastIndex isn’t changed.   localCopy.lastIndex is zero.  Using matchAll  :   522  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   const str = '"fee" "fi" "fo" "fum"'; const regex =  " [^"]* " g;  for  const match of matchAll str, regex   {  console.log match[1] ;  }    Output:    'fee'    'fi'    'fo'    'fum'  45.5.7 regExp.exec   vs. str.match   vs. str.matchAll   The following table summarizes the differences between three methods:  regExp.exec str  str.match regExp  str.matchAll regExp   With  g  Without  g First match object Next match object or null First match object Array of group 0 captures Iterable over match objects TypeError  45.5.8 Replacing with str.replace   and str.replaceAll   Both replacing methods have two parameters:    str.replace searchValue, replacementValue    str.replaceAll searchValue, replacementValue   searchValue can be:    A string   A regular expression replacementValue can be:    String: Replace matches with this string. The character $ has special meaning and  lets us insert captures of groups and more  details are explained later .    Function: Compute strings that replace matches via this function.  The two methods differ as follows:    .replace   replaces the ﬁrst occurrence of a string or a regular expression without    .replaceAll   replaces all occurrences of a string or a regular expression with  g.   g.  This table summarizes how that works:  string Search for: → First occurrence .replace .replaceAll All occurrences  RegExp w o \g First occurrence TypeError  RegExp with  g  All occurrences  All occurrences   45.5 Methods for working with regular expressions  523  The last column of .replace   is in parentheses because this method existed long before .replaceAll   and therefore supports functionality that now should be handled via the latter method. If we could change that, .replace   would throw a TypeError here. We ﬁrst explore how .replace   and .replaceAll   work individually when replace- mentValue is a simple string  without the character $ . Then we examine how both are affected by more complicated replacement values.  45.5.8.1 str.replace searchValue, replacementValue  [ES3] How .replace   operates is inﬂuenced by its ﬁrst parameter searchValue:    Regular expression without  g: Replace ﬁrst match of this regular expression.    String: Replace ﬁrst occurrence of this string  the string is interpreted verbatim,  > 'aaa'.replace  a , 'x'  'xaa'  not as a regular expression .  > 'aaa'.replace 'a', 'x'  'xaa'  > 'aaa'.replace  a g, 'x'  'xxx'    Regular expression with  g: Replace all matches of this regular expression.  Recommendation: If .replaceAll   is available, it’s better to use that method in this case – its purpose is to replace multiple occurrences.  If we want to replace every occurrence of a string, we have two options:    We can use .replaceAll    which was introduced in ES2021 .   Later in this chapter, we will encounter [the tool function escapeForRegExp    which will help us convert a string into a regular expression that matches that string multiple times  e.g., '*' becomes  \* g .  45.5.8.2 str.replaceAll searchValue, replacementValue  [ES2021] How .replaceAll   operates is inﬂuenced by its ﬁrst parameter searchValue:    Regular expression with  g: Replace all matches of this regular expression.    String: Replace all occurrences of this string  the string is interpreted verbatim, not  > 'aaa'.replaceAll  a g, 'x'  'xxx'  as a regular expression .  > 'aaa'.replaceAll 'a', 'x'  'xxx'    Regular expression without  g: A TypeError is thrown  because the purpose of  .replaceAll   is to replace multiple occurrences .   524  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   > 'aaa'.replaceAll  a , 'x'  TypeError: String.prototype.replaceAll called with a non-global RegExp argument  45.5.8.3 The parameter replacementValue of .replace   and .replaceAll   So far, we have only used the parameter replacementValue with simple strings, but it can do more. If its value is:    A string, then matches are replaced with this string. The character $ has special  meaning and lets us insert captures of groups and more  read on for details .    A function, then matches are replaced by strings that are computed via this func-  tion.  45.5.8.4 replacementValue is a string If the replacement value is a string, the dollar sign has special meaning – it inserts text matched by the regular expression:  Text $$ $& $` $' $n $   Result single $ complete match text before match text after match capture of positional group n  n > 0  capture of named group name [ES2018]  Example: Inserting the text before, inside, and after the matched substring.  > 'a1 a2'.replaceAll  a g, " $`$&$' "  ' a1 a2 1  a1 a2 2'  Example: Inserting the captures of positional groups.  > const regExp =  ^ [A-Za-z]+ :  .* $ ug; > 'first: Jane'.replaceAll regExp, 'KEY: $1, VALUE: $2'  'KEY: first, VALUE: Jane'  Example: Inserting the captures of named groups.  > const regExp =  ^ ? [A-Za-z]+ :  ? .* $ ug; > 'first: Jane'.replaceAll regExp, 'KEY: $ , VALUE: $ '  'KEY: first, VALUE: Jane'  Exercise: Change quotes via .replace   and a named group  exercises regexps change_quotes_test.mjs   45.6 The ﬂags  g and  y, and the property .lastIndex  advanced   525  45.5.8.5 replacementValue is a function If the replacement value is a function, we can compute each replacement. In the following example, we multiply each non-negative integer that we ﬁnd by two.  assert.equal    ;  '3 cats and 4 dogs'.replaceAll  [0-9]+ g,  all  => 2 * Number all  , '6 cats and 8 dogs'  The replacement function gets the following parameters. Note how similar they are to match objects. These parameters are all positional, but I’ve included how one might name them:    all: complete match   g1: capture of positional group 1   Etc.   index: where did the match occur?   input: the string in which we are replacing   groups [ES2018]: captures of named groups  an object   45.5.9 Other methods for working with regular expressions String.prototype.split   is described in the chapter on strings. Its ﬁrst parameter of String.prototype.split   is either a string or a regular expression. If it is the latter, then captures of groups appear in the result:  > 'a:b : c'.split ':'  [ 'a', 'b ', ' c' ] > 'a:b : c'.split   *: *   [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ] > 'a:b : c'.split    * :  *    [ 'a', '', '', 'b', ' ', ' ', 'c' ]  45.6 The ﬂags  g and  y, and the property .lastIndex  ad-  vanced   In this section, we examine how the RegExp ﬂags  g and  y work and how they de- pend on the RegExp property .lastIndex. We’ll also discover an interesting use case for .lastIndex that you may ﬁnd surprising.  45.6.1 The ﬂags  g and  y Every method reacts differently to  g and  y; this gives us a rough general idea:     g  .global, ES3 : The regular expression should match multiple times, anywhere  in a string.     y  .sticky, ES6 : Any match inside a string should immediately follow a previ-  ous match  the matches “stick” together .   526  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   If a regular expression has neither the ﬂag  g nor the ﬂag  y, matching happens once and starts at the beginning. With either  g or  y, matching is performed relative to a “current position” inside the input string. That position is stored in the regular expression property .lastIndex. There are three groups of regular-expression-related methods:  1. The string methods .search regExp  and .split regExp  completely ignore  g  and  y  and therefore also .lastIndex .  2. The RegExp methods .exec str  and .test str  change in two ways if either  g  or  y is set. First, we get multiple matches, by calling one method repeatedly. Each time, it returns either another result  a match object or true  or an “end of results” value  null or false . Second, the regular expression property .lastIndex is used to step through the input string. On one hand, .lastIndex determines where matching starts:     g means that a match must begin at .lastIndex or later.    y means that a match must begin at .lastIndex. That is, the beginning of  the regular expression is anchored to .lastIndex. Note that ^ and $ continue to work as usually: They anchor matches to the beginning or end of the input string, unless .multiline is set. Then they anchor to the beginnings or ends of lines.  On the other hand, .lastIndex is set to one plus the last index of the previous match.  3. All other methods are affected as follows:     g leads to multiple matches.    y leads to a single match that must start at .lastIndex.    yg leads to multiple matches without gaps.  This was a ﬁrst overview. The next sections get into more details.  45.6.2 How exactly are methods affected by  g and  y? 45.6.2.1 regExp.exec str  [ES3] Without  g and  y, .exec   ignores .lastIndex and always returns a match object for the ﬁrst match:  > const re =   ; re.lastIndex = 1; > [re.exec '-' , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 0, input: '-' }, 1] > [re.exec '-' , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 0, input: '-' }, 1]  With  g, the match must start at .lastIndex or later. .lastIndex is updated. If there is no match, null is returned.   45.6 The ﬂags  g and  y, and the property .lastIndex  advanced   527  > const re =   g; re.lastIndex = 1; > [re.exec '-' , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 1, input: '-' }, 2] > [re.exec '-' , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 3, input: '-' }, 4] > [re.exec '-' , re.lastIndex] [null, 0]  > const re =   y; re.lastIndex = 1; > [re.exec '-' , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 1, input: '-' }, 2] > [re.exec '-' , re.lastIndex] [null, 0]  With  yg, .exec   behaves the same as with  y.  With  y, the match must start at exactly .lastIndex. .lastIndex is updated. If there is no match, null is returned.  45.6.2.2 regExp.test str  [ES3] This method behaves the same same as .exec  , but instead of returning a match object, it returns true, and instead of returning null, it returns false. For example, without either  g or  y, the result is always true:  > const re =   ; re.lastIndex = 1; > [re.test '-' , re.lastIndex] [true, 1] > [re.test '-' , re.lastIndex] [true, 1]  With  g, there are two matches:  > const re =   g; re.lastIndex = 1; > [re.test '-' , re.lastIndex] [true, 2] > [re.test '-' , re.lastIndex] [true, 4] > [re.test '-' , re.lastIndex] [false, 0]  With  y, there is only one match:  > const re =   y; re.lastIndex = 1; > [re.test '-' , re.lastIndex] [true, 2] > [re.test '-' , re.lastIndex] [false, 0]  With  yg, .test   behaves the same as with  y.   528  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   With  g, we get all matches  group 0  in an Array. .lastIndex is ignored and reset to zero.  45.6.2.3 str.match regExp  [ES3] Without  g, .match   works like .exec  . Either without  y:  > const re =   ; re.lastIndex = 1; > ['-'.match re , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 0, input: '-' }, 1] > ['-'.match re , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 0, input: '-' }, 1]  Or with  y:  > const re =   y; re.lastIndex = 1; > ['-'.match re , re.lastIndex] [{ 0: '', index: 1, input: '-' }, 2] > ['-'.match re , re.lastIndex] [null, 0]  > const re =   g; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.match re  ['', '', ''] > re.lastIndex 0   yg works like  g, but there are no gaps between matches:  > const re =   yg; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.match re  ['', ''] > re.lastIndex 0  45.6.2.4 str.matchAll regExp  [ES2020] If  g is not set, .matchAll   throws an exception:  > const re =   y; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.matchAll re  TypeError: String.prototype.matchAll called with a non-global RegExp argument  > const re =   g; re.lastIndex = 1; > [...'-'.matchAll re ] [  { 0: '', index: 1, input: '-' }, { 0: '', index: 3, input: '-' },  ] > re.lastIndex 1  If  g is set, matching starts at .lastIndex and that property isn’t changed:   45.6 The ﬂags  g and  y, and the property .lastIndex  advanced   529  If  yg is set, the behavior is the same as with  g, but there are no gaps between matches:  With  g, all occurrences are replaced. .lastIndex is ignored but reset to zero.  > const re =   yg; re.lastIndex = 1; > [...'-'.matchAll re ] [  { 0: '', index: 1, input: '-' },  ] > re.lastIndex 1  45.6.2.5 str.replace regExp, str  [ES3] Without  g and  y, only the ﬁrst occurrence is replaced:  > const re =   ; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.replace re, 'x'  'x-' > re.lastIndex 1  > const re =   g; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.replace re, 'x'  'xx-x' > re.lastIndex 0  > const re =   y; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.replace re, 'x'  'x-' > re.lastIndex 2  > const re =   yg; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.replace re, 'x'  'xx-' > re.lastIndex 0   yg works like  g, but gaps between matches are not allowed:  45.6.2.6 str.replaceAll regExp, str  [ES2021] .replaceAll   works like .replace   but throws an exception if  g is not set:  > const re =   y; re.lastIndex = 1; > '-'.replaceAll re, 'x'  TypeError: String.prototype.replaceAll called with a non-global RegExp argument  With  y, only the  ﬁrst  occurrence at .lastIndex is replaced. .lastIndex is updated.   530  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   45.6.3 Four pitfalls of  g and  y and how to deal with them We will ﬁrst look at four pitfalls of  g and  y and then at ways of dealing with those pitfalls.  45.6.3.1 Pitfall 1: We can’t inline a regular expression with  g or  y A regular expression with  g can’t be inlined. For example, in the following while loop, the regular expression is created fresh, every time the condition is checked. Therefore, its .lastIndex is always zero and the loop never terminates.  let matchObj;    Infinite loop while  matchObj =  a+ g.exec 'bbbaabaaa'   {  console.log matchObj[0] ;  }  With  y, the problem is the same.  45.6.3.2 Pitfall 2: Removing  g or  y can break code If code expects a regular expression with  g and has a loop over the results of .exec   or .test  , then a regular expression without  g can cause an inﬁnite loop:  function collectMatches regExp, str  {  const matches = []; let matchObj;    Infinite loop while  matchObj = regExp.exec str   {  matches.push matchObj[0] ;  } return matches;  } collectMatches  a+ , 'bbbaabaaa' ;    Missing: flag  g  Why is there an inﬁnity loop? Because .exec   always returns the ﬁrst result, a match object, and never null. With  y, the problem is the same.  45.6.3.3 Pitfall 3: Adding  g or  y can break code With .test  , there is another caveat: It is affected by .lastIndex. Therefore, if we want to check exactly once if a regular expression matches a string, then the regular expression must not have  g. Otherwise, we generally get a different result every time we call .test  :  > const regExp =  ^X g; > [regExp.test 'Xa' , regExp.lastIndex] [ true, 1 ] > [regExp.test 'Xa' , regExp.lastIndex] [ false, 0 ]   45.6 The ﬂags  g and  y, and the property .lastIndex  advanced   531  > [regExp.test 'Xa' , regExp.lastIndex] [ true, 1 ]  The ﬁrst invocation produces a match and updates .lastIndex. The second invocation does not ﬁnd a match and resets .lastIndex to zero. If we create a regular expression speciﬁcally for .test  , then we probably won’t add  g. However, the likeliness of encountering  g increases if we use the same regular ex- pression for replacing and for testing. Once again, this problem also exists with  y:  45.6.3.4 Pitfall 4: Code can produce unexpected results if .lastIndex isn’t zero Given all the regular expression operations that are affected by .lastIndex, we must be careful with many algorithms that .lastIndex is zero at the beginning. Otherwise, we may get unexpected results:  > const regExp =  ^X y; > regExp.test 'Xa'  true > regExp.test 'Xa'  false > regExp.test 'Xa'  true  function countMatches regExp, str  {  let count = 0; while  regExp.test str   {  count++;  } return count;  }  const myRegExp =  a g; myRegExp.lastIndex = 4; assert.equal   countMatches myRegExp, 'babaa' , 1 ;    should be 3  Normally, .lastIndex is zero in newly created regular expressions and we won’t change it explicitly like we did in the example. But .lastIndex can still end up not being zero if we use the regular expression multiple times.  45.6.3.5 How to avoid the pitfalls of  g and  y As an example of dealing with  g and .lastIndex, we revisit countMatches   from the previous example. How do we prevent a wrong regular expression from breaking our code? Let’s look at three approaches.  45.6.3.5.1 Throwing exceptions First, we can throw an exception if  g isn’t set or .lastIndex isn’t zero:   532  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   function countMatches regExp, str  {  if  !regExp.global  {  throw new Error 'Flag  g of regExp must be set' ;  } if  regExp.lastIndex !== 0  {  throw new Error 'regExp.lastIndex must be zero' ;  }  let count = 0; while  regExp.test str   {  count++;  } return count;  }  }  }  45.6.3.5.2 Cloning regular expressions Second, we can clone the parameter. That has the added beneﬁt that regExp won’t be changed.  function countMatches regExp, str  {  const cloneFlags = regExp.flags +  regExp.global ? '' : 'g' ; const clone = new RegExp regExp, cloneFlags ;  let count = 0; while  clone.test str   {  count++;  } return count;  45.6.3.5.3 Using an operation that isn’t affected by .lastIndex or ﬂags Several regular expression operations are not affected by .lastIndex or by ﬂags. For example, .match   ignores .lastIndex if  g is present:  function countMatches regExp, str  {  if  !regExp.global  {  throw new Error 'Flag  g of regExp must be set' ;  } return  str.match regExp  ?? [] .length;  const myRegExp =  a g; myRegExp.lastIndex = 4; assert.equal countMatches myRegExp, 'babaa' , 3 ;    OK!  Here, countMatches   works even though we didn’t check or ﬁx .lastIndex.   45.6 The ﬂags  g and  y, and the property .lastIndex  advanced   533  45.6.4 Use case for .lastIndex: starting matching at a given index Apart from storing state, .lastIndex can also be used to start matching at a given index. This section describes how.  45.6.4.1 Example: Checking if a regular expression matches at a given index Given that .test   is affected by  y and .lastIndex, we can use it to check if a regular expression regExp matches a string str at a given index: function matchesStringAt regExp, str, index  {  throw new Error 'Flag  y of regExp must be set' ;  if  !regExp.sticky  {  } regExp.lastIndex = index; return regExp.test str ;  } assert.equal   assert.equal   matchesStringAt  x+ y, 'aaxxx', 0 , false ;  matchesStringAt  x+ y, 'aaxxx', 2 , true ;  regExp is anchored to .lastIndex due to  y. Note that we must not use the assertion ^ which would anchor regExp to the beginning of the input string.  45.6.4.2 Example: Finding the location of a match, starting at a given index .search   lets us ﬁnd the location where a regular expression matches:  > '--'.search     0  Alas, we can’t change where .search   starts looking for matches. As a work-around, we can use .exec   for searching:  function searchAt regExp, str, index  {  if  !regExp.global && !regExp.sticky  {  throw new Error 'Either flag  g or flag  y of regExp must be set' ;  } regExp.lastIndex = index; const match = regExp.exec str ; if  match  {  return match.index;  } else {  return -1;  }  }  assert.equal   searchAt   g, '--', 0 , 0 ;   534  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   assert.equal   searchAt   g, '--', 1 , 3 ;  45.6.4.3 Example: Replacing an occurrence at a given index When used without  g and with  y, .replace   makes one replacement – if there is a match at .lastIndex:  function replaceOnceAt str, regExp, replacement, index  {  if  ! regExp.sticky && !regExp.global   {  throw new Error 'Flag  y must be set, flag  g must not be set' ;  } regExp.lastIndex = index; return str.replace regExp, replacement ;  } assert.equal   assert.equal   assert.equal   replaceOnceAt 'aa aaaa a',  a+ y, 'X', 0 , 'X aaaa a' ;  replaceOnceAt 'aa aaaa a',  a+ y, 'X', 3 , 'aa X a' ;  replaceOnceAt 'aa aaaa a',  a+ y, 'X', 8 , 'aa aaaa X' ;  45.6.5 The downsides of .lastIndex The regular expression property .lastIndex has two signiﬁcant downsides:    It makes regular expressions stateful:  – We now have to be mindful of the states of regular expressions and how we  – For many use cases, we can’t make them immutable via freezing, either.   Support for .lastIndex is inconsistent among regular expression operations.  On the upside, .lastIndex also gives us additional useful functionality: We can dictate where matching should begin  for some operations .  share them.  45.6.6 Summary: .global   g  and .sticky   y  The following two methods are completely unaffected by  g and  y:    String.prototype.search     String.prototype.split    This table explains how the remaining regular-expression-related methods are affected by these two ﬂags:  r.exec s   r.test s      {i:0} .lI unch true .lI unch   g  {i:1} .lI upd true .lI upd   y  {i:1} .lI upd true .lI upd   yg  {i:1} .lI upd true .lI upd   45.7 Techniques for working with regular expressions  535  s.match r   s.matchAll r   s.replace r, 'x'   s.replaceAll r, 'x'       g   y   yg  {i:0} .lI unch TypeError  "x-" .lI unch TypeError  ["","",""] .lI reset [{i:1}, {i:3}] .lI unch "xx-x" .lI reset "xx-x" .lI reset  {i:1} .lI upd TypeError  "x-" .lI upd TypeError  ["",""] .lI reset [{i:1}] .lI unch "xx-" .lI reset "xx-" .lI reset  Variables:  Abbreviations:  const r =   ; r.lastIndex = 1; const s = '-';    {i:2}: match object whose property .index has the value 2   .lI upd: .lastIndex is updated   .lI reset: .lastIndex is reset to zero   .lI unch: .lastIndex is unchanged  The Node.js script that generated the previous table  The previous table was generated via a Node.js script.  45.7 Techniques for working with regular expressions 45.7.1 Escaping arbitrary text for regular expressions The following function escapes an arbitrary text so that it is matched verbatim if we put it inside a regular expression:  function escapeForRegExp str  {  return str.replace  [\\^$.*+?  [\]{}] g, '\\$&' ;     A   } assert.equal escapeForRegExp '[yes?]' , String.raw`\[yes\?\]` ; assert.equal escapeForRegExp '_g_' , String.raw`_g_` ;  In line A, we escape all syntax characters. We have to be selective because the regular expression ﬂag  u forbids many escapes – for example: \a \: \- escapeForRegExp   has two use cases:    We want to insert plain text into a regular expression that we create dynamically  via new RegExp  .    We want to replace all occurrences of a plain text string via the regular expression  method .replace    and can’t use .replaceAll   .   536  45 Regular expressions  RegExp   .replace   only lets us replace plain text once. With escapeForRegExp  , we can work around that limitation:  const plainText = ':- '; const regExp = new RegExp escapeForRegExp plainText , 'ug' ; assert.equal   ':-  :-  :- '.replace regExp, '☺' , '☺ ☺ ☺' ;  45.7.2 Matching everything or nothing Sometimes, we may need a regular expression that matches everything or nothing – for example, as a default value.    Match everything:   ?:    The empty group    matches everything. We make it non-capturing  via ?: , to avoid unnecessary work. >   ?:  .test ''  true >   ?:  .test 'abc'  true    Match nothing:  .^   ^ only matches at the beginning of a string. The dot moves matching beyond the ﬁrst character and now ^ doesn’t match anymore.  >  .^ .test ''  false >  .^ .test 'abc'  false   Chapter 46  Dates  Date   Contents  46.4 Time values .  46.2 Time standards .  46.3 Background: date time formats  ISO   46.1 Best practice: avoid the built-in Date .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  . .  . .  . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . 46.1.1 Things to look for in a date library . . . 46.2.1 Background: UTC vs. Z vs. GMT . 46.2.2 Dates do not support time zones . . . .  . . . . . . 46.3.1 Tip: append a Z to make date parsing deterministic . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . 46.4.1 Creating time values . . 46.4.2 Getting and setting time values . . . 46.5.1 Creating dates via numbers 46.5.2 Parsing dates from strings . . 46.5.3 Other ways of creating dates . . . 46.6.1 Time unit getters and setters . . . . . 46.7.1 Strings with times . 46.7.2 Strings with dates . . . 46.7.3 Strings with dates and times . . . 46.7.4 Other methods  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . .  . . .  . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  46.7 Converting Dates to strings . . . . .  46.6 Getters and setters .  46.5 Creating Dates .  . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 537 . 538 . 538 . 538 . 538 . 539 . 540 . 541 . 541 . 541 . 542 . 542 . 542 . 542 . 543 . 543 . 543 . 543 . 544 . 544 . 544  This chapter describes JavaScript’s API for working with dates – the class Date.  46.1 Best practice: avoid the built-in Date The JavaScript Date API is cumbersome to use. Hence, it’s best to rely on a library for anything related to dates. Popular libraries include:  537   538    Moment.js   Day.js   Luxon   js-joda   date-fns  46 Dates  Date   Consult the blog post “Why you shouldn’t use Moment.js…” for the pros and cons of these libraries. Additionally, TC39 is working on a new date API for JavaScript: temporal.  46.1.1 Things to look for in a date library Two things are important to keep in mind:    Tree-shaking can considerably reduce the size of a library. It is a technique of only deploying those exports of a library to a web server that are imported somewhere. Functions are much more amenable to tree-shaking than classes.    Support for time zones: As explained later, Date does not support time zones, which introduces a number of pitfalls and is a key weakness. Make sure that your date library supports them.  46.2 Time standards 46.2.1 Background: UTC vs. Z vs. GMT UTC, Z, and GMT are ways of specifying time that are similar, but subtly different:    UTC  Coordinated Universal Time  is the time standard that all times zones are based on. They are speciﬁed relative to it. That is, no country or territory has UTC as its local time zone.    Z  Zulu Time Zone  is a military time zone that is often used in aviation and the  military as another name for UTC+0.    GMT  Greenwich Mean Time  is a time zone used in some European and African  countries. It is UTC plus zero hours and therefore has the same time as UTC.  Sources:    “The Difference Between GMT and UTC” at TimeAndDate.com   “Z – Zulu Time Zone  Military Time ” at TimeAndDate.com  46.2.2 Dates do not support time zones Dates support the following time standards:    The local time zone  which depends on the current location    UTC   Time offsets  relative to UTC    46.3 Background: date time formats  ISO   539  Depending on the operation, only some of those options are available. For example, when converting dates to strings or extracting time units such as the day of the month, you can only choose between the local time zone and UTC. Internally, Dates are stored as UTC. When converting from or to the local time zone, the necessary offsets are determined via the date. In the following example, the local time zone is Europe Paris:     CEST  Central European Summer Time  assert.equal   new Date '2122-06-29' .getTimezoneOffset  , -120 ;     CET  Central European Time  assert.equal   new Date '2122-12-29' .getTimezoneOffset  , -60 ;  Whenever you create or convert dates, you need to be mindful of the time standard being used – for example: new Date   uses the local time zone while .toISOString   uses UTC.  > new Date 2077, 0, 27 .toISOString   '2077-01-26T23:00:00.000Z'  Dates interpret 0 as January. The day of the month is 27 in the local time zone, but 26 in UTC.  Documenting the time standards supported by each operation  In the remainder of this chapter, the supported time standards are noted for each operation.  46.2.2.1 The downsides of not being able to specify time zones Not being able to specify time zones has two downsides:    It makes it impossible to support multiple time zones.   It can lead to location-speciﬁc bugs. For example, the previous example produces  different results depending on where it is executed. To be safe:  – Use UTC-based operations whenever possible – Use Z or a time offset when parsing strings  see the next section for more  information .  46.3 Background: date time formats  ISO  Date time formats describe:    The strings accepted by:  – Date.parse   – new Date     540  46 Dates  Date     The strings returned by  always longest format :  – Date.prototype.toISOString    The following is an example of a date time string returned by .toISOString  :  '2033-05-28T15:59:59.123Z'  Date time formats have the following structures:   Date formats: Y=year; M=month; D=day    Time formats: T=separator  the string 'T' ; H=hour; m=minute; s=second and  millisecond; Z=Zulu Time Zone  the string 'Z'   YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM YYYY  THH:mm:ss.sss THH:mm:ss.sssZ  THH:mm:ss THH:mm:ssZ  THH:mm THH:mmZ    Date time formats: are date formats followed by time formats.  – For example  longest : YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ  Instead of Z  which is UTC+0 , we can also specify time offsets relative to UTC:    THH:mm+HH:mm  etc.    THH:mm-HH:mm  etc.   46.3.1 Tip: append a Z to make date parsing deterministic If you add a Z to the end of a string, date parsing doesn’t produce different results at different locations:    Without Z: Input is January 27  in the Europe Paris time zone , output is January  26  in UTC .  > new Date '2077-01-27T00:00' .toISOString   '2077-01-26T23:00:00.000Z'    With Z: Input is January 27, output is January 27.  > new Date '2077-01-27T00:00Z' .toISOString   '2077-01-27T00:00:00.000Z'   46.4 Time values 46.4 Time values A time value represents a date via the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC. Time values can be used to create Dates:  541  const timeValue = 0; assert.equal   new Date timeValue .toISOString  , '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z' ;  Coercing a Date to a number returns its time value:  > Number new Date 123   123  Ordering operators coerce their operands to numbers. Therefore, you can use these op- erators to compare Dates:  assert.equal   new Date '1972-05-03'  < new Date '2001-12-23' , true ;     Internally: assert.equal 73699200000 < 1009065600000, true ;  46.4.1 Creating time values The following methods create time values:    Date.now  : number  UTC   Returns the current time as a time value.    Date.parse dateTimeStr: string : number  local time zone, UTC, time offset   Parses dateTimeStr and returns the corresponding time value.    Date.UTC year,month,date?,hours?,minutes?,seconds?,milliseconds? :  number  UTC  Returns the time value for the speciﬁed UTC date time.  46.4.2 Getting and setting time values   Date.prototype.getTime  : number  UTC   Returns the time value corresponding to the Date.    Date.prototype.setTime timeValue   UTC  Sets this to the date encoded by timeValue.   46 Dates  Date   542 46.5 Creating Dates 46.5.1 Creating dates via numbers new Date year: number, month: number, date?: number, hours?: number, min- utes?: number, seconds?: number, milliseconds?: number   local time zone  Two of the parameters have pitfalls:    For month, 0 is January, 1 is February, etc.   If 0 ≤ year ≤ 99, then 1900 is added:  > new Date 12, 1, 22, 19, 11 .getFullYear   1912  That’s why, elsewhere in this chapter, we avoid the time unit year and always use fullYear. But in this case, we have no choice.  Example:  > new Date 2077,0,27, 21,49 .toISOString      CET  UTC+1  '2077-01-27T20:49:00.000Z'  Note that the input hours  21  are different from the output hours  20 . The former refer to the local time zone, the latter to UTC.  46.5.2 Parsing dates from strings new Date dateTimeStr: string   local time zone, UTC, time offset  If there is a Z at the end, UTC is used:  > new Date '2077-01-27T00:00Z' .toISOString   '2077-01-27T00:00:00.000Z'  If there is not Z or time offset at the end, the local time zone is used:  > new Date '2077-01-27T00:00' .toISOString      CET  UTC+1  '2077-01-26T23:00:00.000Z'  If a string only contains a date, it is interpreted as UTC:  > new Date '2077-01-27' .toISOString   '2077-01-27T00:00:00.000Z'  46.5.3 Other ways of creating dates   new Date timeValue: number   UTC   > new Date 0 .toISOString   '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'    new Date    UTC   The same as new Date Date.now   .   543  46.6 Getters and setters 46.6 Getters and setters 46.6.1 Time unit getters and setters Dates have getters and setters for time units – for example:    Date.prototype.getFullYear     Date.prototype.setFullYear num   These getters and setters conform to the following patterns:    Local time zone:  – Date.prototype.get«Unit»   – Date.prototype.set«Unit» num   – Date.prototype.getUTC«Unit»   – Date.prototype.setUTC«Unit» num   These are the time units that are supported:  – FullYear – Month: month  0–11 . Pitfall: 0 is January, etc. – Date: day of the month  1–31  – Day  getter only : day of the week  0–6, 0 is Sunday   – Hours: hour  0–23  – Minutes: minutes  0–59  – Seconds: seconds  0–59  – Milliseconds: milliseconds  0–999     UTC:    Date    Time  There is one more getter that doesn’t conform to the previously mentioned patterns:    Date.prototype.getTimezoneOffset    Returns the time difference between local time zone and UTC in minutes. For ex- ample, for Europe Paris, it returns -120  CEST, Central European Summer Time  or -60  CET, Central European Time :  > new Date '2122-06-29' .getTimezoneOffset   -120 > new Date '2122-12-29' .getTimezoneOffset   -60  46.7 Converting Dates to strings Example Date:  const d = new Date 0 ;  46.7.1 Strings with times    Date.prototype.toTimeString    local time zone    544  46 Dates  Date   > d.toTimeString   '01:00:00 GMT+0100  Central European Standard Time '  46.7.2 Strings with dates    Date.prototype.toDateString    local time zone   > d.toDateString   'Thu Jan 01 1970'  46.7.3 Strings with dates and times    Date.prototype.toString    local time zone     Date.prototype.toUTCString    UTC   > d.toUTCString   'Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT'   Date.prototype.toISOString    UTC   > d.toISOString   '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'  > d.toString   'Thu Jan 01 1970 01:00:00 GMT+0100  Central European Standard Time '  46.7.4 Other methods The following three methods are not really part of ECMAScript, but rather of the ECMA- Script internationalization API. That API has much functionality for formatting dates  including support for time zones , but not for parsing them.

JSON  “JavaScript Object Notation”  is a storage format that uses text to encode data. Its syntax is a subset of JavaScript expressions. As an example, consider the following text, stored in a ﬁle jane.json:  {  }  "first": "Jane", "last": "Porter", "married": true, "born": 1890, "friends": [ "Tarzan", "Cheeta" ]  JavaScript has the global namespace object JSON that provides methods for creating and parsing JSON.  545   546 47.1 The discovery and standardization of JSON A speciﬁcation for JSON was published by Douglas Crockford in 2001, at json.org. He explains:  47 Creating and parsing JSON  JSON   I discovered JSON. I do not claim to have invented JSON because it already existed in nature. What I did was I found it, I named it, I described how it was useful. I don’t claim to be the ﬁrst person to have discovered it; I know that there are other people who discovered it at least a year before I did. The earliest occurrence I’ve found was, there was someone at Netscape who was using JavaScript array literals for doing data communication as early as 1996, which was at least ﬁve years before I stumbled onto the idea.  Later, JSON was standardized as ECMA-404:    1st edition: October 2013   2nd edition: December 2017  JSON’s grammar is frozen  47.1.1 Quoting the ECMA-404 standard:  Because it is so simple, it is not expected that the JSON grammar will ever change. This gives JSON, as a foundational notation, tremendous stability.  Therefore, JSON will never get improvements such as optional trailing commas, com- ments, or unquoted keys – independently of whether or not they are considered desir- able. However, that still leaves room for creating supersets of JSON that compile to plain JSON.  JSON syntax  47.2 JSON consists of the following parts of JavaScript:    Compound:  – Object literals:  * Property keys are double-quoted strings. * Property values are JSON values. * No trailing commas are allowed. * Elements are JSON values. * No holes or trailing commas are allowed.  – Array literals:  – null  but not undefined  – Booleans – Numbers  excluding NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity  – Strings  must be double-quoted     Atomic:  As a consequence, you can’t  directly  represent cyclic structures in JSON.   47.3 Using the JSON API 47.3 Using the JSON API The global namespace object JSON contains methods for working with JSON data.  547  47.3.1 JSON.stringify data, replacer?, space?  .stringify   converts JavaScript data to a JSON string. In this section, we are ignoring the parameter replacer; it is explained in §47.4 “Customizing stringiﬁcation and pars- ing”.  47.3.1.1 Result: a single line of text If you only provide the ﬁrst argument, .stringify   returns a single line of text:  assert.equal   JSON.stringify {foo: ['a', 'b']} , '{"foo":["a","b"]}'  ;  47.3.1.2 Result: a tree of indented lines If you provide a non-negative integer for space, then .stringify   returns one or more lines and indents by space spaces per level of nesting:  assert.equal  JSON.stringify {foo: ['a', 'b']}, null, 2 , `{  "foo": [  "a", "b"  ] }` ;  47.3.1.3 Details on how JavaScript data is stringiﬁed Primitive values:    Supported primitive values are stringiﬁed as expected:  > JSON.stringify 'abc'  '"abc"' > JSON.stringify 123  '123' > JSON.stringify null  'null'    Unsupported numbers: 'null'  > JSON.stringify NaN  'null' > JSON.stringify Infinity  'null'    Bigints: TypeError   548  47 Creating and parsing JSON  JSON   > JSON.stringify 123n  TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt    Other unsupported primitive values are not stringiﬁed; they produce the result  undefined:  > JSON.stringify undefined  undefined > JSON.stringify Symbol    undefined  Objects:    If an object has a method .toJSON  , then the result of that method is stringiﬁed:  > JSON.stringify {toJSON   {return true}}  'true'  Dates have a method .toJSON   that returns a string:  > JSON.stringify new Date 2999, 11, 31   '"2999-12-30T23:00:00.000Z"'    Wrapped primitive values are unwrapped and stringiﬁed:  > JSON.stringify new Boolean true   'true' > JSON.stringify new Number 123   '123'    Arrays are stringiﬁed as Array literals. Unsupported Array elements are stringi-  ﬁed as if they were null:  > JSON.stringify [undefined, 123, Symbol  ]  '[null,123,null]'    All other objects – except for functions – are stringiﬁed as object literals. Properties  with unsupported values are omitted:  > JSON.stringify {a: Symbol  , b: true}  '{"b":true}'    Functions are not stringiﬁed:  > JSON.stringify    => {}  undefined  47.3.2 JSON.parse text, reviver?  .parse   converts a JSON text to a JavaScript value. In this section, we are ignoring the parameter reviver; it is explained §47.4 “Customizing stringiﬁcation and parsing”. This is an example of using .parse  :  > JSON.parse '{"foo":["a","b"]}'  { foo: [ 'a', 'b' ] }   47.4 Customizing stringiﬁcation and parsing  advanced   549  47.3.3 Example: converting to and from JSON The following class implements conversions from  line A  and to  line B  JSON.  class Point {  static fromJson jsonObj  {     A   return new Point jsonObj.x, jsonObj.y ;  }  }  }  constructor x, y  {  this.x = x; this.y = y;  toJSON   {     B   return {x: this.x, y: this.y};  }   Converting JSON to a point: We use the static method Point.fromJson   to parse  JSON and create an instance of Point.  assert.deepEqual   Point.fromJson JSON.parse '{"x":3,"y":5}'  , new Point 3, 5   ;    Converting a point to JSON: JSON.stringify   internally calls the previously  mentioned method .toJSON  .  assert.equal   JSON.stringify new Point 3, 5  , '{"x":3,"y":5}'  ;  Exercise: Converting an object to and from JSON  exercises json to_from_json_test.mjs  47.4 Customizing stringiﬁcation and parsing  advanced  Stringiﬁcation and parsing can be customized as follows:    JSON.stringify data, replacer?, space?   The optional parameter replacer contains either:  – An Array with names of properties. If a value in data is stringiﬁed as an object literal, then only the mentioned properties are considered. All other properties are ignored.  – A value visitor, a function that can transform JavaScript data before it is stringi-  ﬁed.    JSON.parse text, reviver?    550  47 Creating and parsing JSON  JSON   The optional parameter reviver contains a value visitor that can transform the parsed JSON data before it is returned.  47.4.1 .stringfy  : specifying which properties of objects to stringify If the second parameter of .stringify   is an Array, then only object properties, whose names are mentioned there, are included in the result:  const obj = {  a: 1, b: {  c: 2, d: 3,  }  }; assert.equal   JSON.stringify obj, ['b', 'c'] , '{"b":{"c":2}}' ;  47.4.2 .stringify   and .parse  : value visitors What I call a value visitor is a function that transforms JavaScript data:    JSON.stringify   lets the value visitor in its parameter replacer transform    JSON.parse   lets the value visitor in its parameter reviver transform parsed  JavaScript data before it is stringiﬁed.  JavaScript data before it is returned.  In this section, JavaScript data is considered to be a tree of values. If the data is atomic, it is a tree that only has a root. All values in the tree are fed to the value visitor, one at a time. Depending on what the visitor returns, the current value is omitted, changed, or preserved. A value visitor has the following type signature:  type ValueVisitor =  key: string, value: any  => any;  The parameters are:    value: The current value.   this: Parent of current value. The parent of the root value r is {'': r}.  – Note: this is an implicit parameter and only available if the value visitor is    key: Key or index of the current value inside its parent. The key of the root value  an ordinary function.  is ''.  The value visitor can return:    value: means there won’t be any change.   A different value x: leads to value being replaced with x in the output tree.   undefined: leads to value being omitted in the output tree.   47.4 Customizing stringiﬁcation and parsing  advanced   551  47.4.3 Example: visiting values The following code shows in which order a value visitor sees values:  const log = []; function valueVisitor key, value  {  log.push {this: this, key, value} ; return value;    no change  }  const root = {  a: 1, b: {  c: 2, d: 3,  }  }; JSON.stringify root, valueVisitor ; assert.deepEqual log, [  { this: { '': root }, key: '', { this: root { this: root { this: root.b { this: root.b  }, , key: 'a', value: 1 }, , key: 'b', value: root.b }, }, , key: 'c', value: 2 , key: 'd', value: 3 },  value: root  ] ;  As we can see, the replacer of JSON.stringify   visits values top-down  root ﬁrst, leaves last . The rationale for going in that direction is that we are converting JavaScript values to JSON values. And a single JavaScript object may be expanded into a tree of JSON- compatible values. In contrast, the reviver of JSON.parse   visits values bottom-up  leaves ﬁrst, root last . The rationale for going in that direction is that we are assembling JSON values into JavaScript values. Therefore, we need to convert the parts before we can convert the whole.  47.4.4 Example: stringifying unsupported values JSON.stringify   has no special support for regular expression objects – it stringiﬁes them as if they were plain objects:  const obj = { name: 'abc', regex:  abc ui,  }; assert.equal   JSON.stringify obj , '{"name":"abc","regex":{}}' ;  We can ﬁx that via a replacer:   552  47 Creating and parsing JSON  JSON   function replacer key, value  { if  value instanceof RegExp  {  return {  __type__: 'RegExp', source: value.source, flags: value.flags,  };  } else {  }  return value;    no change  } assert.equal  JSON.stringify obj, replacer, 2 , `{  "name": "abc", "regex": {  "__type__": "RegExp", "source": "abc", "flags": "iu"  } }` ;  } else {  return value;  }  } const str = `{  "name": "abc", "regex": {  "__type__": "RegExp", "source": "abc", "flags": "iu"  } }`; assert.deepEqual   JSON.parse str, reviver , {  name: 'abc', regex:  abc ui,  } ;  47.4.5 Example: parsing unsupported values To JSON.parse   the result from the previous section, we need a reviver:  function reviver key, value  {     Very simple check if  value && value.__type__ === 'RegExp'  {  return new RegExp value.source, value.flags ;   47.5 FAQ 47.5 FAQ 47.5.1 Why doesn’t JSON support comments? Douglas Crockford explains why in a Google+ post from 1 May 2012:  553  I removed comments from JSON because I saw people were using them to hold parsing directives, a practice which would have destroyed interoper- ability. I know that the lack of comments makes some people sad, but it shouldn’t. Suppose you are using JSON to keep conﬁguration ﬁles, which you would like to annotate. Go ahead and insert all the comments you like. Then pipe it through JSMin [a miniﬁer for JavaScript] before handing it to your JSON parser.   554  47 Creating and parsing JSON  JSON    Part X  Miscellaneous topics  555    Chapter 48  Next steps: overview of web development  bonus   Contents  48.1 Tips against feeling overwhelmed . . 48.2 Things worth learning for web development 48.2.1 Keep an eye on WebAssembly  Wasm ! . 48.3 Example: tool-based JavaScript workﬂow . 48.4 An overview of JavaScript tools . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . .  . . . . . getting from the JavaScript you write to the . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . . . . . .  . .  . 557 . 558 . 559 . 560 . 562  . 562 . 563 . 564 . 564 . 564 . 564  48.4.1 Building:  JavaScript you deploy . . . . . . . . . 48.5 Tools not related to JavaScript .  48.4.2 Static checking . 48.4.3 Testing . . . 48.4.4 Package managers 48.4.5 Libraries . .  . . . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  You now know most of the JavaScript language. This chapter gives an overview of web development and describes next steps. It answers questions such as:    What should I learn next for web development?   What JavaScript-related tools should I know about?  48.1 Tips against feeling overwhelmed Web development has become a vast ﬁeld: Between JavaScript, web browsers, server- side JavaScript, JavaScript libraries, and JavaScript tools, there is a lot to know. Addi- tionally, everything is always changing: some things go out of style, new things are invented, etc. How can you avoid feeling overwhelmed when faced with this constantly changing vast- ness of knowledge?  557   558  48 Next steps: overview of web development  bonus     Focus on the web technologies that you work with most often and learn them well. If you do frontend development, that may be JavaScript, CSS, SVG, or something else.    For JavaScript: Know the language, but also try out one tool in each of the follow-  ing categories  which are covered in more detail later .  – Compilers: compile future JavaScript or supersets of JavaScript to normal  JavaScript.  – Bundlers: combine all modules used by a web app into a single ﬁle  a script or a module . That makes loading faster and enables dead code elimination.  – Static checkers. For example:  * Linters: check for anti-patterns, style violations, and more. * Type checkers: type JavaScript statically and report errors.  – Test libraries and tools – Version control  usually git   Trust in your ability to learn on demand  It is commendable to learn something out of pure curiosity. But I’m wary of trying to learn everything and spreading yourself too thin. That also induces an anxiety of not knowing enough  because you never will . Instead, trust in your ability to learn things on demand!  48.2 Things worth learning for web development These are a few things worth learning for web development:    Browser APIs such as the Document Object Model  DOM , the browsers’ represen- tation of HTML in memory. They are the foundations of any kind of frontend development.    JavaScript-adjacent technologies such as HTML and CSS.   Frontend frameworks: When you get started with web development, it can be instructive to write user interfaces without any libraries. Once you feel more con- ﬁdent, frontend frameworks make many things easier, especially for larger apps. Popular frameworks include React, Angular, Vue, Ember, Svelte.    Node.js is the most popular platform for server-side JavaScript. But it also lets you run JavaScript in the command line. Most JavaScript-related tools  even compil- ers!  are implemented in Node.js-based JavaScript and installed via npm. A good way to get started with Node.js, is to use it for shell scripting.    JavaScript tooling: Modern web development involves many tools. Later in this  chapter, there is an overview of the current tooling ecosystem.    Progressive web apps: The driving idea behind progressive web apps is to give web apps features that, traditionally, only native apps had – for example: native in- stallation on mobile and desktop operating systems; ofﬂine operation; showing notiﬁcations to users. Google has published a checklist detailing what makes a web app progressive. The minimum requirements are:   48.2 Things worth learning for web development  559  – The app must be served over HTTPS  not the unsecure HTTP . – The app must have a Web App Manifest ﬁle, specifying metadata such as app name and icon  often in multiple resolutions . The ﬁle s  of the icon must also be present.  – The app must have a service worker: a base layer of the app that runs in the background, in a separate process  independently of web pages . One of its responsibilities is to keep the app functioning when there is no internet con- nection. Among others, two mechanisms help it do that: It is a local proxy that supervises all of the web resource requests of the app. And it has ac- cess to a browser’s cache. Therefore, it can use the cache to fulﬁll requests when the app is ofﬂine – after initially caching all critical resources. Other ca- pabilities of service workers include synchronizing data in the background; receiving server-sent push messages; and the aforementioned showing noti- ﬁcations to users.  One good resource for learning web development – including and beyond JavaScript – is MDN web docs.  48.2.1 Keep an eye on WebAssembly  Wasm ! WebAssembly is a universal virtual machine that is built into most JavaScript engines. You get the following distribution of work:    JavaScript is for dynamic, higher-level code.   WebAssembly is for static, lower-level code.  For static code, WebAssembly is quite fast: C C++ code, compiled to WebAssembly, is about 50% as fast as the same code, compiled to native  source . Use cases include support for new video formats, machine learning, gaming, etc. WebAssembly works well as a compilation target for various languages. Does this mean JavaScript will be compiled to WebAssembly or replaced by another language?  48.2.1.1 Will JavaScript be compiled to WebAssembly? JavaScript engines perform many optimizations for JavaScript’s highly dynamic features. If you wanted to compile JavaScript to WebAssembly, you’d have to implement these optimizations on top of WebAssembly. The result would be slower than current engines and have a similar code base. Therefore, you wouldn’t gain anything.  48.2.1.2 Will JavaScript be replaced by another language? Does WebAssembly mean that JavaScript is about to be replaced by another language? WebAssembly does make it easier to support languages other than JavaScript in web browsers. But those languages face several challenges on that platform:    All browser APIs are based on JavaScript.   The runtimes  standard library, etc.  of other languages incur an additional mem-  ory overhead, whereas JavaScript’s runtime is already built into web browsers.    JavaScript is well-known, has many libraries and tools, etc.   560  48 Next steps: overview of web development  bonus   Additionally, many parts of the WebAssembly ecosystem  e.g., debugging  are works in progress. For dynamic code, JavaScript is comparatively fast. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, it will probably remain the most popular choice for high-level code. For low-level code, compiling more static languages  such as Rust  to WebAssembly is an intriguing option. Given that it is just a virtual machine, there are not that many practically relevant things to learn about WebAssembly. But it is worth keeping an eye on its evolving role in web development. It is also becoming popular as a stand-alone virtual machine; e.g., sup- ported by the WebAssembly System Interface.  48.3 Example: tool-based JavaScript workﬂow  Figure 48.1: A classic, very simple web app: An HTML ﬁle refers to a JavaScript ﬁle code.js, which imbues the former with interactivity. code.js uses the library li- brary.js, which must also be loaded by the HTML ﬁle.  Fig. 48.1 depicts a classic web app – when web development was less sophisticated  for better and for worse :    index.html contains the HTML ﬁle that is opened in web browsers.   code.js contains the JavaScript code loaded and used by index.html.   That code depends on the library library.js, a ﬁle that was downloaded man- ually and put next to code.js. It is accessed via a global variable. Note that the HTML ﬁle needs to load the dependency library.js for code.js. code.js can’t do that itself.  Since then, JavaScript workﬂows have become more complex. Fig. 48.2 shows such a workﬂow – one that is based on the JavaScript bundler webpack. Let’s examine the pieces  data, tools, technologies  involved in this workﬂow:    The app itself consists of multiple modules, written in TypeScript – a language that is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. Each ﬁle is an ECMAScript module, plus static type annotations.    The library used by the app is now downloaded and installed via the npm pack- age manager. It also transparently handles transitive dependencies – if this package       index.html  loads  code.js  loads  library.js   48.3 Example: tool-based JavaScript workﬂow  561  Figure 48.2: This is the workﬂow when developing a web app with the bundler webpack. Our web app consists of multiple modules. We tell webpack, in which one execution starts  the so-called entry point . It then analyzes the imports of the entry point, the im- ports of the imports, etc., to determine what code is needed to run the app. All of that code is put into a single script ﬁle.  Entry  Library via   npm  imports  TypeScript  module  imports  TypeScript  module  compiled to  compiled to  JS code  JS code  a  d  d  e  d to  added to  a d d e d to  Output  bundle.js  loads  index.html      562  48 Next steps: overview of web development  bonus   depends on other packages, etc.    All TypeScript ﬁles are compiled to plain JS via a loader, a plugin for webpack.   The tool webpack combines all plain JavaScript ﬁles into a single JavaScript script  ﬁle. This process is called bundling. Bundling is done for two reasons:  – Downloading a single ﬁle is usually faster in web browsers. – During bundling, you can perform various optimizations, such as leaving  out code that isn’t used.  The basic structure is still the same: the HTML ﬁle loads a JavaScript script ﬁle via a   element. However:    The code is now modular without the HTML ﬁle having to know the modules.   bundle.js only includes the code that is needed to run the app  vs. all of li-  brary.js .    We used a package manager to install the libraries that our code depends on.   The libraries aren’t accessed via global variables but via ES module speciﬁers. In modern browsers, you can also deliver the bundle as a module  vs. as a script ﬁle .  48.4 An overview of JavaScript tools Now that we have seen one workﬂow, let’s look at various categories of tools that are popular in the world of JavaScript. You’ll see categories of tools and lots of names of speciﬁc tools. The former are much more important. The names change, as tools come into and out of style, but I wanted you to see at least some of them.  48.4.1 Building: getting from the JavaScript you write to the JavaScript  you deploy  Building JavaScript means getting from the JavaScript you write to the JavaScript you deploy. The following tools are often involved in this process:    Transpilers: A transpiler is a compiler that compiles source code to source code.  Two transpilers that are popular in the JavaScript community are:  – Babel compiles upcoming and modern JavaScript features to older versions of the language. That means you can use new features in your code and still run it on older browsers.  – TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. Roughly, it is the latest version of  JavaScript plus static typing.    Miniﬁers: A miniﬁer compiles JavaScript to equivalent, smaller  as in fewer charac- ters  JavaScript. It does so by renaming variables, removing comments, removing whitespace, etc. For example, given the following input:  let numberOfOccurrences = 5; if  Math.random    {     Math.random   is not zero   48.4 An overview of JavaScript tools  563  numberOfOccurrences++  }  A miniﬁer might produce:  let a=5;Math.random  &&a++; – Popular miniﬁers include: UglifyJS, babel-minify, Terser, and Closure Com-  piler.    Bundlers: compile and optimize the code of a JavaScript app. The input of a bundler is many ﬁles – all of the app’s code plus the libraries it uses. A bundler combines these input ﬁles to produce fewer output ﬁles  which tends to improve performance . A bundler minimizes the size of its output via techniques such as tree-shaking. Tree- shaking is a form of dead code elimination: only those module exports are put in the output that are imported somewhere  across all code, while considering tran- sitive imports . It is also common to perform compilation steps such as transpiling and miniﬁca- tion while bundling. In these cases, a bundler relies on the previously mentioned tools, packaged as libraries.  – Popular bundlers include webpack, browserify, Rollup, and Parcel.  All of these tools and build steps are usually coordinated via so-called task runners  think “make” in Unix . There are:    Dedicated task runners: grunt, gulp, broccoli, etc.   Tools that can be used as simple task runners: npm  via its “scripts”  and webpack   via plugins .  48.4.2 Static checking Static checking means analyzing source code statically  without running it . It can be used to detect a variety of problems. Tools include:    Linters: check the source code for problematic patterns, unused variables, etc. Lin- ters are especially useful if you are still learning the language because they point out if you are doing something wrong.  – Popular linters include JSLint, JSHint, ESLint    Code style checkers: check if code is formatted properly. They consider indenta-  tion, spaces after brackets, spaces after commas, etc. – Example: JSCS  JavaScript Code Style checker     Code formatters: automatically format your code for you, according to rules that  you can customize.  – Example: Prettier    Type checkers: add static type checking to JavaScript.  – Popular type checkers: TypeScript  which is also a transpiler , Flow.   564  48 Next steps: overview of web development  bonus   48.4.3 Testing JavaScript has many testing frameworks – for example:    Unit testing: Jasmine, Mocha, AVA, Jest, Karma, etc.   Integration testing: Jenkins, Travis CI, etc.   User interface testing: CasperJS, Protractor, Nightwatch.js, TestCafé, etc.  48.4.4 Package managers The most popular package manager for JavaScript is npm. It started as a package man- ager for Node.js but has since also become dominant for client-side web development and tools of any kind. There are alternatives to npm, but they are all based in one way or another on npm’s software registry:    Yarn is a different take on npm; some of the features it pioneered are now also  supported by npm.    pnpm focuses on saving space when installing packages locally.  48.4.5 Libraries    Various helpers: lodash  which was originally based on the Underscore.js library   is one of the most popular general helper libraries for JavaScript.    Data structures: The following libraries are two examples among many.  – Immutable.js provides immutable data structures for JavaScript. – Immer is an interesting lightweight alternative to Immutable.js.  It also doesn’t mutate the data it operates on, but it works with normal objects and Arrays.    Date libraries: JavaScript’s built-in support for dates is limited and full of pitfalls.  The chapter on dates lists libraries that you can use instead.    Internationalization: In this area, ECMAScript’s standard library is complemented by the ECMAScript Internationalization API  ECMA-402 . It is accessed via the global variable Intl and available in most modern browsers.    Implementing and accessing services: The following are two popular options that  are supported by a variety of libraries and tools.  – REST  Representative State Transfer  is one popular option for services and  based on HTTP S .  – GraphQL is more sophisticated  for example, it can combine multiple data  sources  and supports a query language.  48.5 Tools not related to JavaScript Given that JavaScript is just one of several kinds of artifacts involved in web develop- ment, more tools exist. These are but a few examples:    CSS:  – Miniﬁers: reduce the size of CSS by removing comments, etc.   48.5 Tools not related to JavaScript  565  – Preprocessors: let you write compact CSS  sometimes augmented with con- trol ﬂow constructs, etc.  that is expanded into deployable, more verbose CSS.  – Frameworks: provide help with layout, decent-looking user interface com-  ponents, etc.    Images: Automatically optimizing the size of bitmap images, etc.   566  48 Next steps: overview of web development  bonus    Part XI  Appendices  567    Chapter 49  Index  !x, 134 ++x, 140 x++, 140 +x, 139 ,  comma operator , 116 --x, 140 x--, 140 -x, 139 x && y, 132 x + y, 110 x - y, 138 x   y, 138 x << y, 150 x === y, 113 x >>> y, 150 x >> y, 150 x ??= y, 123 x ??
