You need some familiarity with HTML Web pages  and JavaScript, but no prior knowledge of jQuery is required.  Which Version of jQuery is for this Book?  The  code  samples  in  this  book  were  initially  written  using  jQuery  1.7.1.   These code samples were upgraded to jQuery 2.0 beta, along with jQuery  Migrate plugin  version 1.9.1  to ensure that the code samples do not con- tain any deprecated jQuery methods.  There are two benefits to this approach.  First, you can use these HTML  Web pages with jQuery 2.0 beta and be assured that they do not contain any  deprecated jQuery code. In addition, if you need to use a version of jQuery  prior to version 2.0  perhaps due to an existing code base , these HTML  Web pages work correctly without modification.  What About jQuery 2.0?  The current production version of jQuery is version 1.9, and jQuery 2.0 beta  is also available.  As this book goes to print, jQuery 2.0 will probably become  available as well. The key point to remember is that jQuery 2.0 removes sup- port for IE 6, IE 7, and IE 8, and also deprecates some jQuery methods that  are available in earlier versions of jQuery. Fortunately, version 2.0 will be  backward compliant with jQuery 1.9.    Which Version of jQuery Should Readers Use?  This is an important question because there are at least five active versions  of jQuery in HTML Web pages  back to version 1.6.x . The answer is simple:   strive to write code that is compliant with jQuery 2.0.   There are two things that you can do to achieve jQuery 2.0 compliance.   First, make sure that you do not use the jQuery methods that have been de- supported, which are available here  along with other changes : http:  jquery.com upgrade-guide 1.9  Second, use the jQuery Migrate plugin, which you can use with either 1.9 or  2.0 to detect deprecated and removed features, or to restore old features for    xiv      Preface  cases where you need old code to run with new jQuery. The plugin and the  messages it generates are documented in the project README.  You can use the plugin simply by including it after your jQuery file and  check for warning messages regarding deprecated code. For example, if you  plan to use jQuery 1.9 in your HTML Web pages, include the following code  snippet:        If you plan to use jQuery 2.0 in your HTML Web pages, include the follow- ing code snippet:  src=”http:  code.jquery.com jquery-2.0.0b1.js”><   <script  script>     When you add the preceding code snippet to an HTML Web page and then  launch that Web page in a WebKit-based browser, you will see the following  message in the Inspector if there are no errors: JQMIGRATE: Logging is active  You can find additional details on the jQuery blog:  http:  blog.jquery.com   How Do I Actually Find the Deprecated Code?  Launch the HTML Web page in question in a WebKit-based browser and  open the Web Inspector to check for errors or warnings. Unfortunately, the  jQuery Migrate plugin can generate warning messages that are unintuitive.  For example, consider the following code snippet in JQDragAndDrop1.html  in Chapter 5: <!--  <script src=”http:  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jque- ryui 1.8.9 jquery-ui.min.js”>   --> <script src=”http:  ajax.googleapis.com ajax libs jque- ryui 1.10.1 jquery-ui.min.js”>   You must use the second   element because the first   ele-   ment does not work correctly. Listing 1 displays the output in Web Inspector  when you launch the HTML Web page and you attempt to drag-and-drop  any of the images.  Preface      xv  FIGURE 1  An Error Message from jQuery Migration Plugin in Web Inspector.  If you launch an HTML Web page and you find “cryptic” error messages,  check the jQuery Website for the latest version of the CDN-based JavaS- cript and CSS files and update your Web page accordingly. If this does not  resolve the issue, perform a Google search to see if you can find a link with  a solution for the error.

C H A P T E R1  JQUERY CONCEPTS  This  chapter  introduces  you  to  jQuery  and  provides  examples  of  using   jQuery  APIs  to  manipulate  elements  in  HTML5  Web  pages.  jQuery  is an extremely popular open source JavaScript-based toolkit that pro- vides a layer of abstraction over JavaScript. Moreover, jQuery supports multiple  browsers, which simplifies the code in your HTML Web pages.   The jQuery homepage provides a download link for the source code, along   with documentation, developer resources, and other useful links:  http:  jquery.org  jQuery is an open source JavaScript toolkit that enables you to write cross-brows- er and cross-platform JavaScript code for managing elements in an HTML Web  page, This includes finding, creating, updating, and deleting not only elements,  but also element attributes, as well as the ability to add or remove style-related  attributes of elements.  Some of the important and useful features of jQuery  in no particular or- der   include  its  support  for  cross-browser  code,  third-party  jQuery  plugins,  themeable widgets, event handling, AJAX support, and simpler DOM traversal.  Using jQuery to Find Elements in Web Pages  A key point to remember is that the “$” prefix is the jQuery function. The  $ prefix is a short-hand form of jQuery  , which means that the following two  lines of code are the same: var pElements1 = $ "p" ; var pElements2 = jQuery "p" ; A third option is the use of window.jQuery, but this is less common than using  jQuery or simply the $ sign.   2      jQuery Pocket Primer  One key point to remember is that a jQuery search actually returns a “re- sult set,” which is the set of elements that match the selection criteria. You can  then apply an “action” to that set of elements. For example, you can find all the  paragraphs in an HTML Web page and then set their text to red. After applying  an action to a set of elements, a new set of elements is returned. In fact, you can  apply a second action to that modified set, which returns yet another set. This  process of applying multiple methods to a set is called method chaining, and  the good news is that you “chain” together as many function invocations as you  wish. Method chaining enables you to write very compact yet powerful code, as  you will see in some examples in this chapter. As a preview, the following code  snippet illustrates the use of jQuery method chaining: $ "ul liitem4" .next  .next  .css {'font-size':24,                                 'background-color':'blue'} ; As  a  simple  example  of  how  to  use  jQuery  to  select  a  set  of  elements  in  an  HTML Web page, the following code snippet returns the set of   elements   if any  in an HTML Web page and assigns that set of elements to the JavaScript  variable pElements: var pElements = $ "p" ; The following code samples illustrate these and other jQuery concepts.  A “Hello World” Web Page with jQuery  The example in this section finds a single HTML   element and then  changes its text. Later you will also see the modified code that enables you to  manipulate an HTML Web page containing multiple HTML   elements.  Listing  1.1  displays  the  contents  of  HelloWorld1.html  that  illustrates  how to add jQuery functionality to an HTML5 Web page that contains a single  HTML   element.  NOTE  Listing 1.1 contains console.log   that is available in  WebKit-based browsers, but might not be available with- out some type of plugin or extension for other browsers.  LISTING 1.1 HelloWorld1.html               Hello World               jQuery Concepts      3       Hello World From a Paragraph          $ document .ready function  {         get the 'id' value      var pId = $ "p" .attr "id" ;          get the text in the   element      var pText = $ "p" .text  ;      console.log  pId+" says "+pText ;          update the text in the   element      $ "p" .text "Goodbye World From a Paragraph" ;      pText = $ "p" .text  ;      console.log pId+" says "+pText ;    } ;          Listing 1.1 references two jQuery files with this code snippet:     <script   src="http:  code.jquery.com jquery-migrate-1.1.0.js">    Important: the first HTML   element in the HTML   element  starts with this line: $ document .ready function  {      do something here } ; The preceding construct ensures that the DOM has been loaded into memory,  so it’s safe to access and manipulate DOM elements.  Remember that you can use the $ sign to represent jQuery, and you can get  the value of an attribute of an HTML element  such as a   element  using the  jQuery attr   function. For example, you can get the value of the id attribute  of an HTML   element as follows: var pId   = $ "p" .attr 'id' ; You can get the text string in an HTML   element using the jQuery text    function, as shown here:    get the text in the   element var pText = $ "p" .text  ; console.log  pId+' says '+pText ;   4      jQuery Pocket Primer  Finally, you can use the same text   function to update the text in an HTML    element, as shown here:    update the text in the   element $ "p" .text "Goodbye World From a Paragraph" ; Launch the file in Listing 1.1 and open the Inspector that is available in your  WebKit-based  browser.  Next,  select  “Inspect  Element”,  and  click  the  “>>”  symbol at the bottom of the Web page to see the output from the two con- sole.log   statements in Listing 1.1. Keep in mind that the exact sequence  of steps for using the Web Inspector is different for Chrome than for Safari, and  the sequence will probably also change in future versions of these two browsers. In case you don’t already know, you can use Chrome Web Inspector to view  the contents of variables, which can be very helpful for debugging purposes.  You can experiment with the features of Chrome Web Inspector, and also read  online tutorials about this excellent tool.  Querying and Modifying the DOM with jQuery  This section shows you how to use various jQuery modifiers that make it  very  easy  to  find  and  update  elements  in  an  HTML5  Web  page.    The  code  samples  are  short  because  they  illustrate  only  one  or  two  qualifiers,  but  you  can combine them to perform very sophisticated DOM traversals and context- sensitive modifications to DOM elements.  Some of the qualifiers that are discussed in the code samples in this section  includes :ﬁ rst, :last, :even, and :odd. A partial list of selectors includes  :eq  , :lt  , :gt  , :has  , :contains  , and :eq  .  Find and Modify Elements With :first and :last Qualifiers  The example in this section shows you how to use the jQuery :ﬁ rst and   :last qualifiers to manipulate the text in HTML elements.  Listing 1.2 displays the contents of JQModifyElements1.html that illus-  trates how to switch the contents of two   elements. LISTING 1.2 JQModifyElements1.html               jQuery and Modifying Elements                <script      src="http:  code.jquery.com jquery-migrate-1.1.0.js">           jQuery Concepts      5        Hello From Paragraph One     Goodbye From Paragraph Two            $ document .ready function  {         get information in first paragraph:      var pId1   = $ "p:first" .attr 'id' ;      var pText1 = $ "p:first" .text  ;            get information in last paragraph:      var pId2   = $ "p:last" .attr 'id' ;      var pText2 = $ "p:last" .text  ;       $ "p:first" .html pText2 ;      $ "p:last" .html pText1 ;      $ "p:first" .text pText2 ;      $ "p:last" .text pText1 ;    } ;           Listing 1.2 references the required jQuery file, adds two HTML   elements,  and then extracts the value of the id attribute and the text in the first   ele- ment as shown here:    get information in first paragraph: var pId1   = $ "p:first" .attr 'id' ; var pText1 = $ "p:first" .text  ; The next block of code performs the same thing with the second   element.  Then, the text of the two   elements is switched with the following two lines  of code: $ "p:first" .html pText2 ; $ "p:last" .html pText1 ; Despite the simplicity of the jQuery code, this illustrates the ease with which  you can manipulate HTML elements in an HTML Web page by means of the  available jQuery functions.  Incidentally,  you  can  get  and  set  the  value  of  an  HTML    field    whose id attribute has value myInput  with the following two lines of code: $ "myInput" .val   $ "myInput .text "new input value" ;  Figure 1.1 displays the result of rendering the page JQModifyElements1. html  in a landscape-mode screenshot taken from an Asus Prime tablet with  Android ICS.   6      jQuery Pocket Primer  FIGURE 1.1  Modifying element in jQuery on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  The next section shows you how to use jQuery methods that can set collec-  tion of elements with the jQuery qualifiers :even   and :odd  .  Finding Elements with :eq, :lt, and :gt Qualifiers  There are many jQuery functions available to perform sophisticated ma- nipulations of HTML elements with relative ease. This section contains some  useful code snippets that illustrate some of the other jQuery functions that are  available.  For example, the jQuery qualifiers :eq  , :lt  , and :gt   respectively  match elements whose position is equal to, less than, or greater than, in a list of  items. Recall that since lists in jQuery start from index 0, the first item in a list  has index zero of the list.  An example of finding the   element with index 3:  $ 'p:eq 3 ' .text 'index equals three' ; An example of finding the   element with index greater than 3: $ 'p:gt 3 ' .text 'index is greater than three' ; An example of finding the   element with index less than 3: $ 'p:lt 3 ' .text 'index is less than three' ; The preceding code snippets show you some of the things that are possible with  jQuery  functions.  Also,  there  are  jQuery  functions  that  perform  conditional  tests on HTML elements.  For  example,  jQuery  provides  custom  selectors,  such  as :has  , :con- tains  , and :eq  . You can use these selectors to select elements, as in the  following example: $ "div:contains 'foo' "    You can also use these selectors to filter other selectors, as shown here: $ "div" .contains 'foo'  In addition, you can search for elements based on the value of their id attribute  or by a specific class attribute, as shown in the next section.   jQuery Concepts      7  Properties versus Attributes in jQuery  In general terms, an attribute is descriptive information attached to a DOM  node that is not the node’s contents or child nodes. For example, in the follow- ing code snippet:  Hello  class is an attribute with the value “intro.”  A  property  is  a  value  derived  from  the  node   attributes  and  all ,  and  is  often writeable. For example, every node has an attributes  property with  a reference to all the attributes. In the preceding code snippet, there will be a  className property that initialized from the class attribute.  In most cases you want the property, but if you need to see the original   value, then use the attribute.  Additional information regarding properties and attributes is here: https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs DOM element http:  stackoverflow.com questions 5874652 prop-vs-attr jQuery provides the .prop   method for properties and the jQuery .attr    method for attributes.  Unfortunately, the jQuery documentation describes the  .prop   method and the .attr   method with an identical statement: "Get the value of a property for the first element in the set  of matched elements or set one or more properties for every  matched element."  However, the good news is in the following statement:  "To maintain backwards compatability [sic], the .attr   meth- od  in  jQuery  1.6.1+  will  retrieve  and  update  the  property  for you so no code for Boolean attributes is required to be  changed to .prop  ."  The safest thing to do is to use the jQuery .attr   method on primitive  values  such as Boolean or single-valued strings  and to use the jQuery .prop    method for multi-valued strings  such as “style” . With this point in mind, the  next section shows you how to work with attributes in jQuery.  Finding and Setting Element Attributes  You’ve seen how to use various jQuery functions to manipulate elements,  and also how to find the value of an attribute. This section contains examples of  updating the attributes of elements.  The following snippet gets the value of the src attribute of an element:  var $source = $ "img" .attr "src" ; The next code snippet shows how to set the value of one attribute: $ "img" .attr "src", " images MyHouse.jpg" ; The following code snippet shows how to set multiple attributes in one com- mand  displayed over multiple lines for convenience : $ "img" .attr {   8      jQuery Pocket Primer         src: " images MyHouse.jpg",        title: "House",        alt: "House" } ; The preceding code snippet sets the values of the attributes src, title, and  alt to their respective values.  Notice that the syntax of the jQuery attr   method is very similar to the  jQuery css   method, so when you understand one function, you will under- stand the other one as well.  Working with Custom Attributes  HTML5  supports  custom  attributes,  provided  that  the  attribute  name  starts with the string data- followed by an attribute name. Although you might  not need to use custom attributes right now, jQuery Mobile relies heavily on  custom attributes, so this functionality is extremely useful.  You can retrieve the values of custom attributes using the jQuery .data     method. For example, suppose your HTML Web page contains this snippet:     You can retrieve the values of these custom attributes as follows: $ "div" .data "role"  returns the value page $ "div" .data "value"  returns the value 99 $ "div" .data "status"  returns the value true You  will  see  more  examples  of  manipulating  custom  data  attributes  in  jQuery Mobile code samples, and if you’re really ambitious, you can find more  examples in the jQuery Mobile source code.  Using jQuery to Remove Elements  As you can probably guess, jQuery enables you to remove elements in ad- dition to finding and modifying elements in an HTML Web page. Listing 1.3  contains a portion of the HTML Web page JQRemovingElements1.html that  illustrates how to remove elements via jQuery. LISTING 1.3 JQRemovingElements1.html       $ document .ready function  {         remove the   element Dave      $ "Dave" .remove  ;          remove the   element Michelle      $ "div1" .remove "Michelle" ;          remove   elements containing "Goodbye"      $ "p" .filter ":contains 'Goodbye' " .remove  ;    } ;     jQuery Concepts      9  Listing 1.3 contains three lines of code for removing elements, the first of which  is shown here  and the second is similar :    remove the   element Dave $ "Dave" .remove  ; Although  the  preceding  code  snippet  performs  just  as  you  would  expect,  an  example that illustrates the real power of jQuery is shown in the following code  snippet, which uses the jQuery filter   method to find and then remove all  the HTML   elements that contain the string Goodbye: $ "p" .filter ":contains 'Goodbye' " .remove  ; Compare the simple and intuitive nature of the preceding single line of jQuery  code with the corresponding JavaScript code that is required to perform the  same functionality.  FIGURE 1.2  Removing elements with jQuery on an iPad3.  Figure 1.2 displays the result of rendering RemovingElements1.htmlin  a portrait-mode screenshot taken from an iOS application running on an iPad3.  Creating DOM Elements  jQuery provides the clone   method and the append   method for cre- ating  new  DOM  elements.  The clone    method  creates  a  true  copy  of  an  element. On the other hand, the append   method operates on the specified  element.  Listing  1.4  displays  the  contents  of  JQCreatingElements1.html  that illustrates how to use both of these jQuery methods in order to create new  elements in an HTML Web page. LISTING 1.4 JQCreatingElements1.html               $ document .ready function  {         append a clone of the Dave element to "div2":      $ "Dave" .clone  .css {color:"000"} .appendTo "div2" ;          append another clone of the Dave element to "div2":      $ "Dave" .clone  .css {color:"00f"}         .appendTo "div2" ;   10      jQuery Pocket Primer          move the red Dave to the end of "div4":      $ "Dave" .appendTo "div4" ;          prepend Dave to all the 'div' elements:      $ "Dave" .clone  .prependTo "div" ;    } ;           Listing  1.3  introduces  the  jQuery clone    method,  an  example  of  which  is  shown here:    append a clone of the Dave element to "div2": $ "Dave" .clone  .css {color:"000"} .appendTo "div2" ; The purpose of the preceding code snippet is clear, and you can even read it  from left to right to grasp its purpose: clone the element whose id is Dave, set  its color to black, and append this cloned element to the element whose id is  div2.  The only other new functionality in Listing 1.3 is the jQuery prependTo    function, which inserts an element before  instead of after  a specified element,  as shown here:    prepend Dave to all the 'div' elements:   $ "Dave" .clone  .prependTo "div" ; to  remember:  clone true   will  also  propagate  One  other  point  the  event  handlers  of  the  source  element.  There  are  other  jQuery  methods for inserting DOM elements, some of which are described in a later  section.  Figure 1.3 displays the result of rendering JQCreatingElements1.html  in a landscape-mode screenshot taken from an iOS application running on an  iPad3.  FIGURE 1.3  Creating elements with jQuery on an iPad3.  The jQuery append   and appendTo   methods  The jQuery documentation provides a succinct explanation about these two   methods:  "The.append  and .appendTo  methods  perform  the  same  task.  The  major difference is in the syntax-specifically, in the placement of the content    jQuery Concepts      11  and target. With .append  , the selector expression preceding the method is  the container into which the content is inserted. With .appendTo  , on the  other hand, the content precedes the method, either as a selector expression or  as markup created on the fly, and it is inserted into the target container."  Perhaps this casual explanation will clarify the difference:  {select-something-here}.append and-append-stuff-from-here  {specify-stuff-here}.appendTo and-append-that-stuff-here  This chapter contains code samples that use these methods so that you will re- member the difference between these two jQuery methods.  Useful jQuery Code Blocks  This  section  contains  a  set  of  code  snippets  that  enable  you  to  perform  conditional logic and then execute your custom code. The code samples in this  section are straightforward, and the comments explain their purpose.  Check if jQuery is loaded:  if  typeof jQuery == 'undefined'  {       jQuery is not loaded  }  Check if an element exists:   if   $ 'myElement' .length > 0   {         the element exists } Note that the “>” symbol in the preceding code snippet is often omitted in the  “truthy” style of programming, but it’s good to be explicit in your code.  Checking for empty elements:  $ '*' .each function   {    if  $ this .text   == ""  {         do something here     }    } ; Returns true or false based on content of a   element: var emptyTest = $ 'myDiv' .is ':empty' ; Determine if a checkbox is checked  returns true false : $ 'checkBox' .attr 'checked' ; Find all checked checkboxes: $ 'input[type=checkbox]:checked' ; Disable enable inputs for a button element: $ "submit-button" .attr "disabled", true ;   12      jQuery Pocket Primer  Remove an attribute from a button element: $ "submit-button" .removeAttr "disabled" ; The preceding code snippets give you an idea of the compact manner in which  you can check various conditions. As you become more proficient with jQuery,  you will develop your own set of useful code snippets.  Now let’s take a look at another important class of jQuery functions that  enable you to navigate around the DOM, some of which are discussed in the  next section.  Handling Click Events in jQuery  jQuery provides support for various types of events and user gestures that  you can “bind” to custom code  written by you  that is executed whenever those  events or gestures take place. The events that you can detect and bind in jQuery  Mobile are discussed in the jQuery Mobile chapter.  The click   function enables you to handle click events using the following   syntax: $ "button1" .click function   {          do something } There are several techniques for handling events, and the recommended tech- nique for doing so is shown here: $ "button1" .on "click" , function   {          do something }  The dblclick   function enables you to handle double click events, and   an example of the syntax is here:      $ "button2" .dblclick function   {          do something     }  Incidentally,  the focus    function  provides  focus  on  selected  elements.  Al- though it is not covered here, you can get more information by consulting the  online documentation.  Listing  1.5  displays  most  of  the  contents  of  JQClickDivs1.html  that  illustrates  how  to  detect  click  events  and  then  update  the  contents  of  both    elements in this HTML5 Web page. LISTING 1.5 JQClickDivs1.html               jQuery Concepts      13      Detecting Click Events with jQuery                <script      src="http:  code.jquery.com jquery-migrate-1.1.0.js">              The first div element      The second div element            var click1=0, click2=0, total=0;     $ document .ready function   {       $ "div1" .click function   {         ++click1;         ++total;         $ this .text "Clicked: "+click1+" total: "+total ;        $ "div2" .text "Clicked: "+click2+" total:                         "+total ;       } ;         $ "div2" .click function   {         ++click2;         ++total;         $ this .text "Clicked: "+click2+" total: "+total ;        $ "div1" .text "Clicked: "+click1+" total: "+total ;       } ;     } ;             Listing 1.5 references the required jQuery file, followed by some CSS styling  definitions, along with two HTML   elements. The code for adding a click  event listener to the first HTML   element is shown here  with similar  jQuery code for the second HTML   element : $ "div1" .click function   {       ++click1;      ++total;      $ this .text "Clicked: "+click1+" total: "+total ;      $ "div2" .text "Clicked: "+click2+" total: "+total ;  } ;    14      jQuery Pocket Primer  Whenever users click on the preceding HTML   element, its click count  and the total click count are incremented, and the text of both HTML    elements are updated with the click count for the individual   elements as  well as the sum of the click counts for both   elements.  Although the example in Listing 1.4 is simplistic, it does illustrate how to  keep track of events in different HTML elements in an HTML Web page. A  more realistic example could involve an HTML Web page with an HTML Form  that has inter-dependencies between elements in the form.  Figure 1.4 displays the result of rendering the HTML page JQClickDi- vs1.html in a landscape-mode screenshot taken from an iOS application run- ning on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  FIGURE 1.4  Counting click events on an Asus Prime Tablet with Android ICS.  Handling Events in jQuery 1.7 and Beyond  In jQuery 1.7 and beyond, the preferred method for defining an event han-  dler uses the following construct: $ "some-element" .on some-event   However,  versions  of  jQuery  prior  to  version  1.7  provide  several  techniques  to bind events to elements, and three of these techniques have been depre- cated. Since version 1.7 was introduced recently, you will probably be exposed  to HTML Web pages containing earlier versions of jQuery for quite some time.  Consequently, you need to be aware of those other coding techniques so that  you will be able to read the jQuery code in HTML Web pages that use earlier  versions of jQuery.   For  the  purpose  of  illustration,  suppose  that  you  need  to  bind  a  “click”   event to an HTML   element whose id attribute is div1.   The preferred method for defining an event handler with this code block    which you saw earlier in this chapter  is shown here: $ "div1" .on "click" , function   {       do something }   jQuery Concepts      15  However, HTML Web pages using older versions of jQuery also use an event  handler defined like this: $ "div1" .click function   {       do something }  A third method for defining an event handler is to use the bind   method,  which has been deprecated in version 1.7:  $ "button1" .bind "click" , function   {       do something } A fourth method for defining an event handler is to use the live   method,  which has also been deprecated in version 1.7: $ "div1" .live "click" , function   {       do something } The bind   method and the live   method attach a handler to an event to  any element that matches the current selector. In addition, the live   method  attaches the same handler to elements created later, which match the current  selector.  A  fifth  method  for  defining  an  event  handler  is  to  use  the delegate     method, which has also been deprecated in version 1.7: $ "div1" .delegate "click" , function   {       do something } In the preceding code blocks, an event handler was defined in order to handle  a click event, but similar comments apply to other user-initiated events, such as  swipeleft and swiperight. If you want to learn more about other changes in  jQuery 1.7, you can find a summary of the changes  with links  here:  http:  api.jquery.com category version 1.7  You  can  also  get  detailed  information  regarding  new  functionality  and   changes in jQuery 1.7 on this Web page:  http:  blog.jquery.com 2011 11 03 jquery-1-7-released  Additional  information  regarding  the  most  recent  versions  of  jQuery  is   available in the Preface of this book.  Chaining jQuery Functions  You have already seen examples of chaining jQuery commands, and you  might have used chained commands in Java  especially with JAXB  such as the  following: myList  .getFirstElem  .getCustomer  .setFirstName "Dave" ;   16      jQuery Pocket Primer  jQuery chaining supports more sophisticated operations than the preced- ing code snippet. By default, jQuery references the first element in a chain, but  you can change the default behavior.  For example, you can instruct jQuery to  reference the current element using the .parent   method, perform some  manipulation, and then use the jQuery .end   method to reference the first  element in the chain again.  A good example that illustrates the information discussed in the previous   paragraph is here:  the-chain  http:  blog.pengoworks.com index.cfm 2007 10 26 jQuery-Understanding-  Keep in mind the following caveats: use caution when you change the de- fault behavior in method chaining because the actual behavior might not be the  behavior that you expect in your code. In addition, make sure that you clearly  document such code, lest you confuse people who are less knowledgeable than  you about jQuery.  Accelerometer Values with jQuery  The example in this section illustrates how you can use jQuery to obtain   accelerometer values for a mobile device.  Listing 1.6 displays the contents of JQAccelerometer1.html that illus- trates how to display the accelerometer values of a mobile device whenever the  device undergoes acceleration in any direction. The CSS stylesheet JQAccel- erometer1.css contains simple selectors that are not shown here, but you can  find the complete listing on the CD.

After determining the color associated with each  direction, the associated rectangular   element is updated with the cor- responding color.  After binding the window object to the devicemotion event, we can use  the event object  in this case called e  to obtain a JavaScript reference to the ac- celeration object  which is called acceler . We can then extract current values  for the three different axes, as shown here: $ 'document' .ready function  {    $ window .bind "devicemotion", function e {       var accelEvent = e.originalEvent,              acceler = accelEvent.accelerationIncludingGrav- ity,              x = acceler.x, y = acceler.y, z = acceler.z; For simplicity, the array of colors contains only three colors, and the following  code computes a number between 0 and 2 in order to determine the color for  the x direction: if x < 0       { intx = 0; } else if x < 1  { intx = 1; }  else           { intx = 2; } The color for the x direction is calculated like this: colorX = colors[intx];  The background color of the HTML   element that is associated with   the x direction is updated with the following code: $ "valueX" .css "backgroundColor", colorX ; Finally, the current value of the acceleration in the x direction is displayed us- ing the following code snippet: $ "valueX" .html " Acceleration x:  " + x + "  " ;  The corresponding values for the y direction and the z direction are computed  in a similar fashion.

In some cases, CSS3 concepts are presented  without code samples due to space limitations; however, those concepts  are included because it’s important for you to be aware of their existence. By  necessity, this chapter assumes that you have a moderate understanding of CSS,  which means that you can write a basic stylesheet with selectors and properties.  If you are unfamiliar with CSS selectors, there are many introductory articles  available through an Internet search. If you are convinced that CSS operates  under  confusing  and  seemingly  arcane  rules,  then  it’s  probably  worth  your  while to read an online article about the CSS box model, after which you will  have a better understanding of the underlying logic of CSS.   The first part of this chapter contains code samples that illustrate how to  create shadow effects, how to render rectangles with rounded corners, and also  how to use linear and radial gradients. The second part of this chapter covers  CSS3 transforms  scale, rotate, skew, and translate , along with code samples  that illustrate how to apply transforms to HTML elements and to JPG files.   The third part of this chapter covers CSS3 2D graphics, such as linear gra-  dients, radial gradients, and CSS3 transforms.  You can launch the code samples in this chapter in a Webkit-based brows- er on a desktop or a laptop. You can also view them on mobile devices, provided  that you launch them in a browser that supports the CSS3 features that are used  in the code samples. For your convenience, many of the code samples in this  chapter are accompanied by screenshots of the code samples on a Sprint Nexus  S 4G and an Asus Prime Android ICS 10” tablet  both on Android ICS , which  enables you to compare those screenshots with the corresponding images that  are rendered on Webkit-based browsers on desktops and laptops. In Chapter 10,    22      jQuery Pocket Primer  you  will  learn  the  process  of  creating  Android  applications  that  can  launch  HTML5 Web pages.  CSS3 Support and Browser-Specific Prefixes for CSS3  Properties  Before we delve into the details of CSS3, there are two important details  that you need to know about defining CSS3-based selectors for HTML pages.  First, you need to know the CSS3 features that are available in different brows- ers. One of the best Websites for determining browser support for CSS3 fea- tures is here:  http:  caniuse.com  The preceding link contains tabular information regarding CSS3 support   in IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome, and Opera, as well as several mobile browsers. Another  highly  useful  tool  that  checks  for  CSS3  feature  support  is  En- hance.js. It tests browsers to determine whether or not they can support a set  of essential CSS and JavaScript properties, and then delivers features to those  browsers that satisfy the test. You can download Enhance.js here:  https:  github.com filamentgroup EnhanceJS A third useful tool is Modernizr, which checks for HTML5-related feature   detection in various browsers, and its homepage is here:  http:  www.modernizr.com  At some point you will start using JavaScript in your HTML5 Web pages   indeed, you probably do so already , and Modernizr provides a programmatic  way to check for many HTML5 and CSS3 features in different browsers.   In  order  to  use  Modernizr,  include  the  following  code  snippet  in  the     element of your Web pages:  <  script> Navigate to the Modernizr homepage where you can read the documentation,  tutorials, and details regarding the set of feature detection.  The second detail that you need to know is that many CSS3 properties cur- rently require browser-specific prefixes in order for them to work correctly. The  prefix applies to “work in progress” for individual browsers, and the final speci- fication drops browser-specific prefixes. The prefixes –ie-, -moz-, and -o- are  for Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Opera, respectively. Note that Opera also  supports –webkit- prefixes, and it’s possible that other browsers will do the  same  check the respective Websites for updates .  As an illustration, the following code block shows examples of these pre-  fixes: -ie-webkit-border-radius: 8px; -moz-webkit-border-radius: 8px; -o-webkit-border-radius: 8px; border-radius: 8px;   Introduction to CSS3      23  In your CSS selectors, specify the attributes with browser-specific prefixes be- fore the “generic” property, which serves as a default choice in the event that  the browser-specific attributes are not selected. The CSS3 code samples in this  book contain WebKit-specific prefixes, which helps us keep the CSS stylesheets  manageable in terms of size. If you need CSS stylesheets that work on multiple  browsers  for current versions as well as older versions , there are essentially  two options available. One option involves manually adding the CSS3 code with  all  the  required  browser-specific  prefixes,  which  can  be  tedious  to  maintain  and also error-prone. Another option is to use CSS toolkits or frameworks  dis- cussed  in  the  next  chapter ,  which  can  programmatically  generate  the  CSS3  code that contains all browser-specific prefixes.  Finally, an extensive list of browser-prefixed CSS properties is here: http:  peter.sh experiments vendor-prefixed-css-property-overview  An extensive list of prefix-free CSS properties is here: http:  www.blooberry.com indexdot css propindex all.htm  Quick Overview of CSS3 Features  CSS3 adopts a modularized approach involving multiple sub-specifications  for extending existing CSS2 functionality as well as supporting new functional- ity. As such, CSS3 can be logically divided into the following categories:   cid:81  Backgrounds borders   cid:81  Color   cid:81  Media queries   cid:81  Multi-column layout   cid:81  Selectors  With  CSS3,  you  can  create  boxes  with  rounded  corners  and  shadow  effects;  create rich graphics effects using linear and radial gradients; detect portrait and  landscape mode; detect the type of mobile device using media query selectors;  and produce multi-column text rendering and formatting.  In addition, CSS3 enables you to define sophisticated node selection rules  in  selectors  using  pseudo-classes   described  in  the  next  section ,  first  or  last  child   :ﬁ rst-child, :last-child, :ﬁ rst-of-type, and :last-of-type ,  and also pattern-matching tests for attributes of elements. Several sections in  this chapter contain examples of how to create such selection rules.  CSS3 Pseudo Classes and Attribute Selection  This brief section contains examples of some pseudo-classes, followed by  snippets that show you how to select elements based on the relative position of  text strings in various attributes of those elements.    24      jQuery Pocket Primer  Recall that the class attribute in CSS provides a way to mark a group of   elements as having a certain property, such as the following code snippet:   On the other hand, pseudo-classes enable you to reference an arbitrary group  of  elements  by  some  identifying  feature  that  they  possess.  For  example,  the  following code snippet collects the first paragraph in each HTML    element in an HTML Web page: section:p:first-of-type  CSS3  supports  an  extensive  and  rich  set  of  pseudo-classes,  including  nth- child  , along with some of its semantically related “variants,” such as nth- of-type  ,  nth-first-of-type  ,  nth-last-of-type  ,  and  nth- last-child  .  CSS3 also supports Boolean selectors  which are also pseudo-classes  such  as empty,  enabled,  disabled,  and  checked,  which  are  very  useful  for  Form-related HTML elements. One other pseudo class is not  , which returns  a set of elements that do not match the selection criteria.  Although this section focuses on the :nth-child   pseudo-class, you will  become familiar with various other CSS3 pseudo-classes. In the event that you  need to use those pseudo-classes, a link is provided at the end of this section,  which contains more information and examples that illustrate how to use them.  The CSS3 :nth-child   pseudo-class is both powerful and useful, and it   has the following form: :nth-child insert-a-keyword-or-linear-expression-here  The following list provides various examples of using the nth-child   pseu- do-class in order to match various subsets of child elements of an HTML    element  which can be substituted by other HTML elements as well : div:nth-child 1 : matches the first child element div:nth-child 2 : matches the second child element div:nth-child :even : matches the even child elements div:nth-child :odd : matches the odd child elements The  interesting  and  powerful  aspect  of  the nth-child    pseudo-class  is  its  support for linear expressions of the form an+b, where a is a positive integer  and b is a non-negative integer, as shown here  using an HTML5   ele- ment : div:nth-child 3n : matches every third child, starting from position 0 div:nth-child 3n+1 : matches every third child, starting from position 1 div:nth-child 3n+2 : matches every third child, starting from position 2 Another very useful pseudo-class involves :hover, which can easily create nice  visual effects. The following example of the CSS3 :hover pseudo-class changes   CSS3 Pseudo Classes   Introduction to CSS3      25  the font size of an element whose id attribute has value text1, whenever users  hover over the associated element with their mouse: text1:hover {   font-size: 12pt; }  CSS3 Attribute Selection  You  can  specify  CSS3  selectors  that  select  HTML  elements,  as  well  as  HTML elements based on the value of an attribute of an HTML element us- ing various regular expressions. For example, the following selector selects img  elements whose src attribute starts with the text string Laurie, and then sets  the width attribute and the height attribute of the selected img elements to  100px: img[src^="Laurie"] {   width: 100px; height: 100px; } The preceding CSS3 selector is useful when you want to set different dimen- sions to images based on the name of the images  Laurie, Shelly, Steve, and  so forth .  The following HTML   elements do not match the preceding selector:      CSS3 uses the meta-characters ^, $, and *  followed by the = symbol  in order  to match an initial, terminal, or arbitrary position for a text string. If you are  familiar with the Unix utilities grep and sed, as well as the vi text editor, then  these meta-characters are very familiar to you. However, CSS3 imposes a re- striction for using meta-characters: they can only be used in the context of an  attribute match  which uses square brackets .  The following selector selects HTML img elements whose src attribute  ends  with  the  text  string  jpeg,  and  then  sets  the  width  attribute  and  the  height attribute of the selected img elements to 150px: img[src$="jpeg"] {   width: 150px; height: 150px; }  The preceding CSS3 selector is useful when you want to set different di- mensions to images based on the type of the images  jpg, png, jpeg, and so  forth .  The following selector selects HTML img elements whose src attribute  contains any occurrence of the text string baby, and then sets the width attri- bute and the height attribute of the selected HTML img elements to 200px: img[src*="baby"] {   width: 200px; height: 200px; }   26      jQuery Pocket Primer  The preceding CSS3 selector is useful when you want to set different dimen- sions to images based on the “classification” of the images  mybaby, yourbaby,  babygirl, babyboy, and so forth .  If you want to learn more about patterns  and their descriptions  that you   can use in CSS3 selectors, an extensive list is available here:  http:  www.w3.org TR css3-selectors This concludes part one of this chapter, and the next section delves into   CSS3 graphics-oriented effects, such as rounded corners and shadow effects.  CSS3 Shadow Effects and Rounded Corners  CSS3 shadow effects are useful for creating vivid visual effects. You can use  shadow effects for text as well as rectangular regions. CSS3 also enables you to  easily render rectangles with rounded corners, so you do not need JPG files in  order to create this effect.  Specifying Colors with RGB and HSL  Before we delve into the interesting features of CSS3, you need to know  how to represent colors. One method is to use  R, G, B  triples, which repre- sent the Red, Green, and Blue components of a color. For instance, the triples   255, 0, 0 ,  255, 255, 0 ,  and  0, 0, 255   respectively  represent  the  colors Red, Yellow, and Blue. Other ways of specifying the color include: the  hexadecimal triples  F, 0, 0  and  FF, 0, 0 ; the decimal triple  100%, 0,  0 ; or the string F00. You can also use  R, G, B, A , where the fourth com- ponent specifies the opacity, which is a decimal number between 0  invisible   to 1  opaque  inclusive.   However, there is also the HSL  Hue, Saturation, and Luminosity  rep- resentation of colors, where the first component is an angle between 0 and 360   0 degrees is north , and the other two components are percentages between  0 and 100. For instance,  0, 100%, 50% ,  120, 100%, 50% , and  240,  100%, 50%  represent the colors Red, Green, and Blue, respectively.  The code samples in this book use  R,  G,  B  and  R,  G,  B,  A  for  representing  colors,  but  you  can  perform  an  Internet  search  to  obtain  more  information regarding HSL.  CSS3 and Text Shadow Effects  A shadow effect for text can make a Web page look more vivid and appeal- ing. Many Websites look better with shadow effects that are not overpowering  for users  unless you specifically need to do so .   Listing 2.1 displays the contents of the HTML5 page TextShadow1.html  that illustrate how to render text with a shadow effect, and Listing 2.2 displays  the  contents  of  the  CSS  stylesheet TextShadow1.css  that  is  referenced  in  Listing 2.1. LISTING 2.1  TextShadow1.html     Introduction to CSS3      27             CSS Text Shadow Example    <link href="TextShadow1.css"          rel="stylesheet" type="text css">                    Line One Shadow Effect     Line Two Shadow Effect            Line Three Vivid Effect                                  13       August       2012               13       August       2012                                      13        August       2012           The code in Listing 2.1 is straightforward:  there is a reference to the CSS  stylesheet TextShadow1.css  that  contains  two  CSS  selectors.  One  selector  specifies how to render the HTML   element whose id attribute has value  text1, and the other selector matches the HTML   element whose id  attribute is text2. Although the CSS3 rotate   function is included in this  example, we’ll defer a more detailed discussion of this function until later in  this chapter. LISTING 2.2 TextShadow1.css text1 {   font-size: 24pt;   text-shadow: 2px 4px 5px 00f; }     text2 {   font-size: 32pt;   text-shadow: 0px 1px 6px 000,   28      jQuery Pocket Primer                 4px 5px 6px f00; }   * note the multiple parts in the text-shadow definition *      text3 {   font-size: 40pt;   text-shadow: 0px 1px 6px  fff,                2px 4px 4px  0ff,                4px 5px 6px  00f,                0px 0px 10px 444,                0px 0px 20px 844,                0px 0px 30px a44,                0px 0px 40px f44; }         text4 {   position: absolute;   top: 200px;   right: 200px;   font-size: 48pt;   text-shadow: 0px 1px 6px  fff,                2px 4px 4px  0ff,                4px 5px 6px  00f,                0px 0px 10px 000,                0px 0px 20px 448,                0px 0px 30px a4a,                0px 0px 40px fff;   -webkit-transform: rotate -90deg ; }   text5 {   position: absolute;   left: 0px;   font-size: 48pt;   text-shadow: 2px 4px 5px 00f;   -webkit-transform: rotate -10deg ; }  text6 {   float: left;   font-size: 48pt;   text-shadow: 2px 4px 5px f00;   -webkit-transform: rotate -170deg ; }   * 'transform' is explained later *  text1:hover, text2:hover, text3:hover, text4:hover, text5:hover, text6:hover {   Introduction to CSS3      29  -webkit-transform : scale 2  rotate -45deg ; transform : scale 2  rotate -45deg ; } The first selector in Listing 2.2 specifies a font-size of 24 and a text-shad- ow that renders text with a blue background  represented by the hexadecimal  value 00f . The attribute text-shadow specifies  from left to right  the x- coordinate, the y-coordinate, the blur radius, and the color of the shadow. The  second selector specifies a font-size of 32 and a red shadow background  f00 .  The third selector creates a richer visual effect by specifying multiple compo- nents in the text-shadow property, which were chosen by experimenting with  effects that are possible with different values in the various components.  The final CSS3 selector creates an animation effect whenever users hover  over any of the six text strings, and the details of the animation will be deferred  until later in this chapter.  Figure  2.1  displays  the  result  of  matching  the  selectors  in  the  CSS  stylesheet TextShadow1.css with the HTML   elements in the HTML  page TextShadow1.html. The landscape-mode screenshot is taken from an  Android application  based on the code in Listing 2.1 and Listing 2.2  running  on a Nexus S 4G  Android ICS  smart phone.  FIGURE 2.1  CSS3 text shadow effects.   30      jQuery Pocket Primer  CSS3 and Box Shadow Effects  You can also apply a shadow effect to a box that encloses a text string, which  can be effective in terms of drawing attention to specific parts of a Web page.  However, the same caveat regarding over-use applies to box shadows.  The HTML page BoxShadow1.html and BoxShadow1.css are not shown  here, but they are available on the CD. Together, they render a box shadow ef- fect.  The key property is the box-shadow property, as shown here in bold for   ON THE CD  Mozilla, WebKit, and the non-prefixed property: box1 {   position:relative;top:10px;   width: 50%;   height: 30px;   font-size: 20px;   -moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 800;   -webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 800;   box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 800;  Figure  2.2  displays  a  landscape-mode  screenshot  is  taken  from  a  Nexus  S 4G with Android ICS  based on the code in BoxShadow1.html and Box- Shadow1.css .  FIGURE 2.2  CSS3 box shadow effect on a Sprint Nexus with Android ICS.  CSS3 and Rounded Corners  Web developers have waited a long time for rounded corners in CSS, and  CSS3 makes it very easy to render boxes with rounded corners. Listing 2.3 dis- plays the contents of the HTML page RoundedCorners1.html that renders  text strings in boxes with rounded corners, and Listing 2.4 displays the CSS file  RoundedCorners1.css. LISTING 2.3  RoundedCorners1.html          Introduction to CSS3      31    <link href="RoundedCorners1.css" rel="stylesheet"                                                  type="text css">              Text Inside a Rounded Rectangle         Line One of Text with a Shadow Effect     Line Two of Text with a Shadow Effect       Listing 2.3 contains a reference to the CSS stylesheet RoundedCorners1. css that contains three CSS selectors that match the elements whose id at- tribute has value anchor, text1, and text2, respectively. The CSS selectors  defined in RoundedCorners1.css create visual effects, and as you will see,  the hover pseudo-selector enables you to create animation effects. LISTING 2.4  RoundedCorners1.css a.anchor:hover { background: 00F; }    a.anchor { background: FF0; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; padding: 4px 4px; color: rgba 255,0,0,0.8 ; text-shadow: 0 1px 1px rgba 0,0,0,0.4 ; -webkit-border-radius: 8px; border-radius: 8px; }  Listing 2.4 contains the selector a.anchor:hover that changes the text color  from yellow  FF0  to blue  00F  during a two-second interval whenever users  hover over any anchor element with their mouse.  The selector a.anchor contains various attributes that specify the dimen- sions of the box that encloses the text in the   element, along with two new  pairs of attributes. The first pair specifies the border-radius attribute  and  the WebKit-specific attribute  whose value is 8px, which determines the radius   in pixels  of the rounded corners of the box that encloses the text in the    element. The last two selectors are identical to the selectors in Listing 2.1.  Figure 2.3 displays the result of matching the selectors that are defined in  the CSS stylesheet RoundedCorners1.css with elements in the HTML page  RoundedCorners1.html in a landscape-mode screenshot taken from an Asus  Prime tablet with Android ICS.   32      jQuery Pocket Primer  FIGURE 2.3  CSS3 rounded corners effect on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  CSS3 Gradients  CSS3  supports  linear  gradients  and  radial  gradients,  which  enable  you  to  create  gradient  effects  that  are  as  visually  rich  as  gradients  in  other  technologies such as SVG. The code samples in this section illustrate how to  define linear gradients and radial gradients in CSS3 and then match them to  HTML elements. Linear Gradients  CSS3  linear  gradients  require  you  to  specify  one  or  more  “color  stops,”  each of which specifies a start color, and end color, and a rendering pattern.  Webkit-based browsers support the following syntax to define a linear gradient:   cid:81  A start point   cid:81  An end point   cid:81  A start color using from     cid:81  Zero or more stop-colors   cid:81  An end color using to   A start point can be specified as an  x, y  pair of numbers or percentages. For  example, the pair  100, 25%  specifies the point that is 100 pixels to the right  of the origin and 25% of the way down from the top of the pattern. Recall that  the origin is located in the upper-left corner of the screen.  Listing 2.5 displays the contents of LinearGradient1.html and Listing  2.6 displays the contents of LinearGradient1.css, which illustrate how to  use linear gradients with text strings that are enclosed in   elements and an    element.

Since the next three selectors  in Listing 2.6 are similar to the first selector, we will not discuss their content.  The next CSS selector creates a text outline with a nice shadow effect by   rendering the text in white with a thin black shadow, as shown here: color: fff; text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba 0,0,0,0.5 ; The final portion of Listing 2.6 contains three selectors that affect the rendering  of  the    element  and  its  embedded    element.    The h3  selector  speci- fies the width and font size; the h3 selector specifies a linear gradient; and the  h3:after selector specifies the text string "This is a Line of Gradient  Text" to display after the HTML5   element.  Note: you can use h3:before  to specify a text string to display before an HTML5   element.  Other attri- butes are specified, but these are the main attributes for these selectors.  Figure 2.4 displays the result of matching the selectors in the CSS stylesheet  LinearGradient1.css  to  the  HTML  page  LinearGradient1.html  in  a  landscape-mode screenshot taken from an Android application running on an  Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  Radial Gradients  CSS3 radial gradients are more complex than CSS3 linear gradients, but  you  can  use  them  to  create  more  complex  gradient  effects.  Webkit-based  browsers support the following syntax to define a radial gradient:   cid:81  A start point   cid:81  A start radius   cid:81  An end point   cid:81  An end radius   36      jQuery Pocket Primer  FIGURE 2.4  CSS3 Linear gradient effect on an Asus Prime 10” tablet with Android ICS.     cid:81  A start color using from     cid:81  Zero or more color-stops   cid:81  An end color using to    ON THE CD  Notice that the syntax for a radial gradient is similar to the syntax for a linear  gradient, except that you also specify a start radius and an end radius.  The HTML5 Web page RadialGradient1.html and the CSS stylesheet  RadialGradient1.css are not shown here, but the full listing is available on  the CD. The essence of the code in the HTML5 code involves this code block:      Text3     Text2     Text4     Text1     The CSS stylesheet RadialGradient1.css contains five CSS selectors that  match the five HTML   elements, and one of the selectors is shown here: radial1 { background: -webkit-gradient    radial, 500 40%, 0, 301 25%, 360, from red ,   color-stop 0.05, orange , color-stop 0.4, yellow ,   color-stop 0.6, green , color-stop 0.8, blue ,   to fff    ; } The radial1 selector contains a background attribute that defines a radial  gradient using the –webkit- prefix, and it specifies the following:   cid:81   cid:31 A start point of  500, 40%    cid:81  A start radius of 0   Introduction to CSS3      37    cid:81  An end point of  301, 25%    cid:81  An end radius of 360   cid:81  A start color of red   cid:81  An end color of white  fff   The other selectors have the same syntax as the first selector, but the rendered  radial gradients are significantly different. You can create these  and other  ef- fects by specifying different start points and end points, and by specifying a start  radius that is larger than the end radius.  Figure 2.5 displays the result of matching the selectors in the CSS stylesheet  RadialGradient1.css to the HTML page RadialGradient1.html  in a  landscape-mode screenshot taken from an Android application running on an  Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  FIGURE 2.5  CSS3 Radial gradient effect on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  CSS3 2D Transforms  In addition to transitions, CSS3 supports four common transforms that you  can apply to 2D shapes and also to JPG files. The four CSS3 transforms are  scale, rotate, skew, and translate. The following sections contain code  samples  that  illustrate  how  to  apply  each  of  these  CSS3  transforms  to  a  set  of  JPG  files.  The  animation  effects  occur  when  users  hover  over  any  of  the  JPG files; moreover, you can create “partial” animation effects by moving your  mouse quickly between adjacent JPG files.  Listing 2.7 displays the contents of Scale1.html and Listing 2.8 displays  the contents of Scale1.css, which illustrate how to scale JPG files to create a  “hover box” image gallery.

LISTING 2.8  Scale1.css outer { float: left; position: relative; top: 50px; left: 50px; }  img { -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1.0s ease; transition: transform 1.0s ease; }   img.scaled {   -webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 800;   box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 800; }  img.scaled:hover { -webkit-transform : scale 2 ; transform : scale 2 ; }   Introduction to CSS3      39  The img selector in Listing 2.8 specifies a transition property that ap- plies a transform effect occurring during a one-second interval using the ease  function, as shown here: transition: transform 1.0s ease; Next, the selector img.scaled specifies a box-shadow property that creates  a reddish shadow effect  which you saw earlier in this chapter , as shown here: img.scaled {   -webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 800;   box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 800; } Finally, the selector img.scaled:hover specifies a transform attribute that  uses the scale   function in order to double the size of the associated JPG  file whenever users hover over any of the   elements with their mouse, as  shown here: transform : scale 2 ; Since the img selector specifies a one-second interval using an ease function,  the scaling effect will last for one second. Experiment with different values for  the CSS3 scale   function and also different value for the time interval to cre- ate the animation effects that suit your needs.   Another point to remember is that you can scale both horizontally and ver-  tically: img { -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 1.0s ease; transition: transform 1.0s ease; }  img.mystyle:hover { -webkit-transform : scaleX 1.5  scaleY 0.5 ; transform : scaleX 1.5  scaleY 0.5 ; } Figure 2.6 displays the result of matching the selectors in the CSS stylesheet  Scale1.css to the HTML page Scale1.html.

Rotate Transforms  The CSS3 transform attribute allows you to specify the rotate   func-  tion in order to create scaling effects, and its syntax looks like this: rotate someValue ; You can replace someValue with any number. When someValue is positive,  the rotation is clockwise; when someValue is negative, the rotation is counter    40      jQuery Pocket Primer  ON THE CD  ON THE CD  FIGURE 2.6  CSS3-based scaling effect on JPG files.  clockwise; and when someValue is zero, there is no rotation effect. In all cases,  the initial position for the rotation effect is the positive horizontal axis.  The HTML5 Web page Rotate1.html and the CSS stylesheet Rotate1. css  on the CD illustrate how to create rotation effects, a sample of which is  shown here: img.imageL:hover { -webkit-transform : scale 2  rotate -45deg ; transform : scale 2  rotate -45deg ; }      The img  selector  that  specifies  a transition  attribute  that  creates  an  ani- mation effect during a one-second interval using the ease timing function, as  shown here: transition: transform 1.0s ease; The  CSS3  transform  attribute  allows  you  to  specify  the skew    function  in  order to create skewing effects, and its syntax looks like this: skew xAngle, yAngle ; You  can  replace xAngle  and yAngle  with  any  number.  When xAngle  and  yAngle are positive, the skew effect is clockwise; when xAngle and yAngle are  negative, the skew effect is counter clockwise; and when xAngle and yAngle  are zero, there is no skew effect. In all cases, the initial position for the skew  effect is the positive horizontal axis.  The HTML5 Web page Skew1.html and the CSS stylesheet Skew1.css  are on the CD, and they illustrate how to create skew effects. The CSS stylesheet  contains the img selector that specifies a transition attribute, which in turn  creates an animation effect during a one-second interval using the ease timing  function, as shown here: transition: transform 1.0s ease; There are also the four selectors img.skewed1, img.skewed2, img.skewed3,  and img.skewed4  create background shadow effects with darker shades of  red, yellow, green, and blue, respectively  all of which you have seen in earlier  code samples .   Introduction to CSS3      41  The selector img.skewed1:hover specifies a transform attribute that per- forms a skew effect whenever users hover over the first    element with  their mouse, as shown here: transform : scale 2  skew -10deg, -30deg ; The other three CSS3 selectors also use a combination of the CSS functions  skew    and scale  to  create  distinct  visual  effects.  Notice  that  the  fourth  hover selector also sets the opacity property to 0.5, which takes place in par- allel with the other effects in this selector.  Figure 2.7 displays the result of matching the selectors in the CSS stylesheet  Skew1.css to the elements in the HTML page Skew1.html. The landscape- mode screenshot is taken from an Android application running on a Nexus S 4G  smart phone with Android ICS.  FIGURE 2.7  CSS3-based skew effects on JPG files.  The  CSS3  transform  attribute  allows  you  to  specify  the  translate    function in order to create an effect that involves a horizontal and or vertical  “shift” of an element, and its syntax looks like this: translate xDirection, yDirection ;  The translation is in relation to the origin, which is the upper-left corner of  the screen. Thus, positive values for xDirection and yDirection produce a  shift to the right and downward, respectively, whereas negative values for xDi- rection and yDirection produce a shift to the left and upward. Zero values  for xDirection and yDirection do not cause any translation effect.  The Web page Translate1.html and the CSS stylesheet Translate1.  css on the CD illustrate how to apply a translation effect to a JPG file. img.trans2:hover { -webkit-transform : scale 0.5  translate -50px, -50px ; transform : scale 0.5  translate -50px, -50px ; }  The CSS stylesheet contains the img selector specifies a transform effect during  a one-second interval using the ease timing function, as shown here: transition: transform 1.0s ease;  ON THE CD   42      jQuery Pocket Primer  The  four  selectors  img.trans1,  img.trans2,  img.trans3,  and  img. trans4  create background shadow effects with darker shades of red, yellow,  green, and blue, respectively, just as you saw in the previous section.  The  selector  img.trans1:hover  specifies  a  transform  attribute  that  performs a scale effect and a translation effect whenever users hover over the  first   element with their mouse, as shown here: -webkit-transform : scale 2  translate 100px, 50px ; transform : scale 2  translate 100px, 50px ;  Figure 2.8 displays the result of matching the selectors defined in the CSS3  stylesheet Translate1.css to the elements in the HTML page Translate1. html.

CSS3 Media Queries  CSS3 media queries are very useful logical expressions that enable you to  detect mobile applications on devices with differing physical attributes and ori- entation. For example, with CSS3 media queries you can change the dimen- sions and layout of your applications so that they render appropriately on smart  phones as well as tablets.   Specifically, you can use CSS3 media queries in order to determine the fol-  lowing characteristics of a device:   cid:81  Browser window width and height   cid:81  Device width and height   cid:81  Orientation  landscape or portrait    cid:81  Aspect ratio   cid:81  Device aspect ratio   cid:81  Resolution   Introduction to CSS3      43  CSS3 media queries are Boolean expressions that contain one or more “sim- ple terms”  connected with and or or  that evaluate to true or false. Thus,  CSS3 media queries represent conditional logic that evaluates to either true  or false.  As an example, the following link element loads the CSS stylesheet my- stuff.css only if the device is a screen and the maximum width of the device  is 480px: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text css"          media="screen and  max-device-width: 480px "                           href="mystuff.css" > The preceding link contains a media attribute that specifies two components:  a  media type of screen and a query that specifies a max-device-width whose  value  is 480px.  The  supported  values  for  media  in  CSS3  media  queries  are  braille, embossed, handheld, print, projection, screen, speech,  tty, and tv.  The next CSS3 media query checks the media type, the maximum device   width, and the resolution of a device: @media screen and  max-device-width: 480px  and  resolution:  160dpi  {      innerDiv {      float: none;      }  } If the CSS3 media query in the preceding code snippet evaluates to true, then  the nested CSS selector will match the HTML element whose id attribute has  the value innerDiv, and its float property will be set to none on any device  whose maximum screen width is 480px. As you can see, it’s possible to create  compact CSS3 media queries that contain non-trivial logic, which is obviously  very useful because CSS3 does not have any if then else construct that is  available in other programming languages.  Additional Code Samples on the CD  The CSS stylesheet CSS3MediaQuery1.css and the HTML5 Web page  CSS3MediaQuery1.html  illustrate  how  to  use  media  queries  in  order  to  change the size of two images when users rotate their mobile device.  You can detect a change of orientation of a mobile device using simple Ja- vaScript code, so you are not “forced” to use CSS3 media queries. The HTML5  Web page CSS3OrientationJS1.html on the CD illustrates how to use stan- dard JavaScript in order to change the size of two images when users rotate  their mobile device.  In essence, the code uses the value of the variable window.orientation  in order to detect four different orientations of your mobile device. In each of   ON THE CD  ON THE CD   44      jQuery Pocket Primer  those four cases, the dimensions of the JPG files are updated with the following  type of code: document.getElementById "img1" .style.width  = "120px"; document.getElementById "img1" .style.height = "300px";  Although this is a very simple example, hopefully this code gives you an ap-  preciation for the capabilities of CSS3 Media Queries.  Summary  This chapter showed you how to create graphics effects, shadow effects,  and how to use transforms in CSS3. You learned how to create animation ef- fects that you can apply to HTML elements, and you saw how to define CSS3  selectors to do the following:   cid:81  Render rounded rectangles   cid:81  Create shadow effects for text and 2D shapes   cid:81  Create linear and radial gradients   cid:81  Use the methods translate  , rotate  , skew  , and scale     cid:81  Create CSS3-based animation effects   C H A P T E R  3  ANIMATION EFFECTS WITH  JQUERY AND CSS3 This  chapter  shows  you  how  to  create  HTML5  Web  pages  that  create   animation effects and also provide interactivity for users. You’ll see an  assortment  of  jQuery  functions  that  create  various  animation  effects,  which  you  can  easily  incorporate  in  your  HTML5  Web  pages.  This  eclectic  chapter is intended to provide you with many animation effects, along with an  assortment of code samples and code fragments that you can incorporate into  your other HTML5 Web pages.  The first part of this chapter shows you how to use jQuery in order to ma- nipulate the attributes of an element by setting the values of properties in CSS3  selectors, along with examples of creating animation effects using animate and  effect. You’ll see code examples that create slide-based and fade-related  fa- deIn, fadeOut, fadeTo  animation effects. This section also illustrates how  to create 2D animation effects using jQuery together with CSS3 keyframes.  The  second  part  of  this  chapter  illustrates  how  to  create  a  “follow  the  mouse” HTML5 Web page that uses CSS3 for the visual effect and jQuery for  updating the location of the gradient-filled rectangle. Remember that the CSS3  examples in the chapters of this book are specifically for WebKit-based brows- ers, but you can modify the code samples to include vendor-specific prefixes so  that the code samples will run in other browsers. The last example in this chap- ter illustrates how to render SVG with jQuery using a jQuery plugin.  Note that this chapter covers jQuery animation effects and chapter seven  contains some corresponding animation effects using jQuery Mobile, and that  both chapters contain CSS3-based animation effects as well. Due to space con- straints, this chapter covers only a portion of the animation-related functionality  that is available in jQuery. You can learn more about jQuery animation by read- ing the online jQuery documentation or by performing an Internet search for  additional tutorials and articles.   46      jQuery Pocket Primer  Working with CSS3 Selectors in jQuery  This  section  contains  code  samples  that  illustrate  how  to  use  jQuery  to  programmatically create HTML elements and to style them with CSS3 to cre- ate  various  effects,  such  as  rounded  corners,  gradients,  and  shadow  effects.  By manually creating the required CSS3 selectors and the HTML elements,  you can leverage the power of jQuery to create even more sophisticated visual  effects.  Basic Animation Effects in jQuery  This section contains code fragments rather than complete code listings,  and these code fragments illustrate how to create animation effects in jQuery  using the functions hide   and show  , and also how to set the animation  speed. You'll also learn how to use the jQuery toggle   function to toggle CSS  properties.  Keep in mind that this section covers only a portion of the rich set of func- tionality that is available with jQuery functions that create animation effects.  Be sure to read the jQuery online documentation to learn about many other  features that are supported.  The jQuery hide   and show   functions enable you to change the visibil- ity of elements in an HTML page. For example, the following code block hides  the second button when users click the first button; when users double click on  the first button, the second button becomes visible: $ "myButton1" .click function   {   $ myButton2" .hide  ; } ; $ "myButton1" .dblclick function   {   $ myButton2" .show  ; } ; The jQuery toggle function can handle two or more occurrences of the same  event on an element. For example, the following code fragment handles one,  two, or three click events on an element with the specified id value: $ "myDiv1" .toggle        function   {         $ "myText" .text "First click" ;       },      function   {         $ "myText" .text "Second click" ;       },      function   {         $ "myText" .text "Third click" ;       } } ;   Using Callback Functions  Animation Effects with  jQuery and CSS3      47  Two  other  useful  jQuery  methods  are  removeClass    and  addClass  ,  which remove or add CSS classes, respectively, and an example is here: $ "myDiv1" .toggle        function   {         $ "myText" .addClass "shiny" ;       },      function   {         $ "myText" .addClass "dark" ;       } } ; The  jQuery  addClass    method  adds  a  CSS  class,  whereas  the  toggle- Class   method “toggles” the CSS class; i.e., the class is added if it’s not pres- ent, and it’s removed if it is already included.  Other related jQuery methods include fadeClass  , which uses a fading   effect, and slideClass  , which creates a sliding effect.  Many jQuery functions  including hide  , show  , toggle  , and slide- related functions  enable you to specify a callback function that is executed after  the specified action is completed. For example, you can define the following  code block: $ "myButton1" .click function   {   $ myButton2" .hide 'slow',     function callback   {         do something else    } ; } ; When users click on an element whose id is myButton1, the preceding code  block slowly hides the element whose id is myButton2, and after the animation  is completed, the code in the callback function is executed.  This book contains WebKit-based code samples, but if you decide to use  the preceding code block with IE, keep in mind that there is a bug involving the  use of named functions in callbacks in IE. The following article provides useful  information regarding named functions:  http:  kangax.github.com nfe  jQuery Fade and Slide Animation Effects  The jQuery fade-related and slide-related effects are easy to create, and if  you define them appropriately, they can create very nice visual effects in your  Web pages.  The  following  example  combines  the  jQuery,  .fadeIn  ,  and  .fade- Out   functions and also shows you how to chain these functions so that you  can create multiple animation effects.   48      jQuery Pocket Primer  The fadeIn  , fadeOut  , and fadeToggle   Functions  The  three  jQuery  functions .fadeIn  ,   fadeOut    ,  and fadeTog- gle   methods can specify three parameters, and their syntax is shown here: jQuery list-of-elements .fadeIn speed ;  jQuery list-of-elements .fadeOut speed ;  jquery list-of-elements .fadeTo speed ;  The  following  code  block  illustrates  how  to  use  these  three  jQuery   functions: $ "something" .click function   {    $ this .fadeIn 'slow' ; } ; $ "something" .click function   {    $ this .fadeOut 'slow' ; } ; $ "something" .click function   {    $ this .fadeTo 'slow', .65 ; } ; Listing 3.1 displays the contents of FadeInOut.html, and illustrates how to  perform simple and chained fading effects in jQuery.

The first point to notice is the JavaScript variable para  that stores a reference to the HTML   elements that are direct child ele- ments of HTML   elements, as shown here: $ document .ready function  {   var para = $ "div > p" ;      code omitted } The next code block dynamically adds an HTML   element to the HTML    elements that are referenced in the para variable: para.each function  {   var p = $ this ;   p.append '<span style="color:red;font-size:18px"'+   50      jQuery Pocket Primer             '>This Text Will Fade on Hover ' ; } ; When users hover over any of the HTML   elements, the jQuery code cre- ates multiple fade-related effects for the HTML   elements using jQuery  method chaining. An example is shown below: $ this .find "span" .fadeOut 2000 .fadeIn "slow"                      .fadeOut "fast" .fadeIn 2000                      .fadeOut "slow" ; You can use jQuery methods to apply effects to elements other than the ele- ment that has the current focus. For example, if you want to hide a sibling ele- ment during a hover event, you can do something like this: $ this .next  .fade  ;  The next section shows you how to use jQuery slide-related functions in order  to create slide-related animation effects.  jQuery Slide-Related Functions  The  jQuery slideUp  ,   slideDown  ,  and slideToggle    methods   can specify three parameters, and they have the following syntax: jQuery elements .slideUp [milliseconds], [easing-function],                           [callback-function] ;  jQuery elements .slideDown [milliseconds],                             [easing-function],                             [callback-function] ;  jQuery elements .slideToggle [milliseconds],                               [easing-function],                               [callback-function] ; The value milliseconds specifies the duration of the animation effect, and  the callback-function  is  an  optional  JavaScript  function  that  is  executed  after the animation is completed.

One  point  to  keep  in  mind  is  that  sliding  effects  do  not  always  work  as  expected  some jerkiness may occur  for elements that have CSS padding or  margin properties or a width property that is not set to a fixed width. Experi- ment with these scenarios to see if the resultant behavior is what you expect, or  if it is acceptable for your Web pages.  Easing Functions in jQuery  jQuery supports a set of so-called “easing” functions that provide different  types of animation effects. In general terms, an easing function uses some type  of equation as the path for an animation effect. For example, you can use a linear  equation to create animation with constant speed. You can also use a quadratic  equation  a polynomial of degree two, whose general form is a*x*x+b*x+c  to  create animation effects with acceleration or for quadratic Bezier curves, and  cubic equations for cubic Bezier curves.  jQuery also provides easing functions for animation whose speed is more  complex  slow, fast, slow  at different positions of an easing function. Before  you search for jQuery plugins, it’s well worth your time to explore the existing  jQuery easing functions, some of which are: linear,  easeInQuad,  ease- OutQuad, easeInCubic, easeOutCubic, easeInOutCubic, easeInSine,  easeOutSine, easeInOutSine,  easeInElastic,  easeOutElastic, and  easeInOutElastic.  You can find numerous links that provide an extensive set of demonstration   of jQuery easing functions, including the one shown here:  http:  jqueryui.com demos effect easing.html  In addition, there are many jQuery plugins available for custom animation-re- lated easing functions, or you can create your own jQuery plugin if you cannot  find one that fits your needs.  The jQuery .animate   Method  The jQuery animate   method can take four parameters, and they look   like this: jQuery elements .animate [properties],                           [milliseconds],                           [easing-function],                           [complete-function] ; The properties parameter contains the list of properties to animate, and the  milliseconds parameter specifies the duration of the animation effect. The  easing-function parameter specifies one of the easing functions discussed in the  previous section, and the complete-function specifies the JavaScript call- back function to execute when the animation effect has completed.   ON THE CD  ON THE CD  Animation Effects with  jQuery and CSS3      53  The HTML5 Web page JQAnimate1.html on the CD illustrates how to  use the jQuery animate   function in order to create animation effects on two  PNG files.  This HTML5 Web page contains two PNG images, along with jQuery click  handlers for two HTML   elements. Whenever users click on the left  button, the jQuery code decreases the PNG opacity from 1.0 to 0.25, shifts  the image file 50 units to the right, and increases its height by 100 units during  a five-second interval, as shown here: $ 'text1' .animate {     opacity: 0.25,     left: '+=50',     height: '+=100'   }, 5000, function   {        Animation complete  do something else  } ;  Whenever users click on the second button, the jQuery code performs similar  animation effects on the right-side image file. Launch the code in Listing 3.2  and click the buttons to see the animation effects.  You can see a variation of the animation effects in Listing 3.2 in the HTML5  Web page JQAnimate2.html, as well as sequential and parallel animation ef- fects in the HTML5 Web page JQAnimate2.html, both of which are available  on the CD.  You  can  use  the  jQuery animate    function  to  create  other  interesting  visual  effects  by  changing  different  CSS  properties  of  HTML  elements.  For  example, the following code block create a “wobbling” effect with list items that  are part of an HTML   element: $ 'mylist li' .hover function   {    $ this .animate {paddingLeft: '+=15px'}, 200 ; }, function   {    $ this .animate {paddingLeft: '-=15px'}, 200 ; } ; You can also create linear and swing animation effects, as shown here: $ 'p:first' .toggle function   {    $ this .animate {'height':'+=150px'}, 1000, 'linear' ; }, function   {    $ this .animate {'height':'-=150px'}, 1000, 'swing' ; } ;  Custom CSS Animation Using the .animate   Function  You can use jQuery to animate many CSS properties, including border- width, bottom, font-size, height, margin, opacity, padding, right,  top, width,  and word-spacing. In addition, you can specify the duration  with slow, fast, or an integer value that represents milliseconds.    54      jQuery Pocket Primer  The following code animates the width and height attributes of an HTML     element so that their final values will be 500 and 300, respectively: $ "myDiv" .click function   {   $ this .animate {      width:'500px', height: '300px'   } ; } ; In the preceding jQuery code snippet, the width will increase to 500px if its  initial value is less than 500px; otherwise it will decrease the width to 500px.   The same holds true for the height attribute .  CSS3-Based Animation Effects  This section illustrates a variety of animation effects that you can create  with CSS3, where the code samples use CSS3 @keyframes rules and 2D 3D  transforms.  Animation Effects with CSS3 Keyframes and 2D Transforms  Listing 3.3 displays the contents of JQButtonAnimation1.html, and il- lustrates how to create button-related animation effects that are triggered by  the hover pseudo-class.

Whenever users click on either button, the CSS3 keyframes definition is  applied to the button. This in turn creates animation effects using combinations  of the functions translate  , rotate  , and skew   for the time periods   either 2 seconds or 4 seconds  specified in the associated selectors. In addition,  the click handlers create a fading effect that lasts for 500 milliseconds.  When you launch the HTML Web page JQButtonAnimation1.html in  a browser, you will see the animation effect whenever you hover over either of  the buttons.   Animation Effects with  jQuery and CSS3      57  2D Transforms with CSS3 and jQuery  The code sample in this section shows you how to apply CSS transforms  directly to elements  based on user-initiated events  using the jQuery css    function.  Listing 3.4 displays the contents of JQTransforms2D1.css, which con- tains  CSS3  selectors  that  are  applied  to  the  HTML5  Web  page  JQTrans- forms2D1.html, shown in Listing 3.4. LISTING 3.4  JQTransforms2D1.css outer {   position: absolute;   left: 50px;   top: 150px; }  inner1 {   float: left;   background-color:F00;   width: 200px;   height:150px; }  inner2 {   float: left;   background-color:FF0;   width: 200px;   height:150px; }  inner3 {   float: left;   background-color:00F;   width: 200px;   height:150px; } Listing 3.4 is very straightforward: several properties, such as the width and  height,  are  specified  for  three  HTML    elements  that  are  defined  in  Listing 3.5. LISTING 3.5  JQTransforms2D1.html               jQuery Transform Effects    58      jQuery Pocket Primer                    <script       src="http:  code.jquery.com jquery-migrate-1.1.0.js">              Click Inside Any of the Rectangles:                                                 $ document .ready function   {       $ "inner1" .click function   {         $ "div" .css {height: '300px',           'webkit-transform': 'scale 0.5, 0.5  skew -10deg,                                                       20deg '         } ;       } ;          $ "inner2" .click function   {         $ "div" .css {height: '200px',                       width: '250px',          'webkit-transform': 'scale 0.5, 0.8  rotate -45deg '         } ;       } ;        $ "inner3" .click function   {         $ "div" .css {height: '100px',                       width: '250px',          'webkit-transform': 'skew -10deg, 10deg  rotate -45deg '         } ;       } ;    } ;              Animation Effects with  jQuery and CSS3      59  Listing 3.5 defines event handlers for the click event for three HTML    elements, all of which invoke the jQuery css   function in order to update  properties of the   element that received a click event.  For example, the first HTML   element is updated as follows when-  ever users click on this element: $ "div" .css {height: '300px',     'webkit-transform': 'scale 0.5, 0.5  skew -10deg, 20deg ' } ; As you can see, the height property is set to 300px, and transforms are applied  to the   elements when users click on them.  Keep in mind that you can move the CSS3 code, referenced in the click  handlers in Listing 3.5, to a separate CSS stylesheet. This makes it easier to  maintain the CSS3 code in a single file, and you can also reference the same  CSS stylesheet in multiple HTML Web pages.  In addition to CSS3 2D animation effects, you can obviously create CSS3  3D animation effects. Experiment with the code in Listing 3.5 by adding some  of the 3D effects that are available in code chapters in Chapter 2, or from the  following open source project:  http:  code.google.com p css3-graphics Figure 3.1 displays JQTransforms2D1.html in the Chrome browser on   a MacBook.  The remainder of this chapter contains examples that are different from  the previous code samples. Listing 3.4 and Listing 3.5 involve mouse-related  functionality and how to handle mouse events programmatically. Listing 3.6  in the next section shows you a very rudimentary game-oriented code sample  that combines JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS3 more extensively than earlier ex- amples.  FIGURE 3.1  Transformed rectangles in jQuery in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.   60      jQuery Pocket Primer  A Follow-the-Mouse Example with jQuery  The code sample in this section extends the functionality introduced in the  previous section by showing you how to programmatically create HTML    elements and append them to the DOM.  Listing 3.6 displays the contents of JQSketchFollowMouse1.html that  illustrates how to render a   element under the current location of a user’s  mouse using jQuery and CSS3 in an HTML5 Web page.

The key point to note is that the  event object  called e in this code sample  gives us access to the coordinates of  the current move position. We can use the attributes e.pageX and e.pageY to  set the CSS properties left and top, respectively.  Notice also the inclusion of an empty HTML   element immediately  after the HTML   element in Listing 3.6. This element is required be- cause UI elements added after a script are known to disappear in some older  browsers. The solution is to include the empty   element and then append  content to that element.  Handling Other Events with jQuery  You have seen code samples that illustrate how to use jQuery to handle  various events. jQuery provides extensive support for mouse-related events and  also support for keyboard events, as described in the next two sections.   62      jQuery Pocket Primer  Handling Mouse Events  jQuery supports the following common mouse events that are probably fa- miliar  to  you: mousedown, mouseenter, mouseleave, mousemove, mouse- out, mouseover, and mouseup. You can detect each of these mouse events in  jQuery using the following jQuery code constructs: $ "myInput" .mousedown function   {      do something } ; $ "myInput" .mouseenter function   {      do something } ; $ "myInput" .mouseleave function   {      do something } ; $ "myInput" .mousemove function   {      do something } ; $ "myInput" .mouseout function   {      do something } ; $ "myInput" .mouseover function   {      do something } ; $ "myInput" .mouseup function   {      do something } ; You  can  include  any  of  the  preceding  code  snippets  that  you  need  in  your  HTML Web pages and then add the processing logic to provide the intended  functionality.  Handling Keyboard Events  You can also detect keypress, keyup, and keydown events in jQuery. For  example, this code displays an alert when users click on the uppercase “Z” key: $ "myInput" .keypress function e  {   if  e.which == 90  alert  'Z was typed.'  } ; You can check for other key events, keeping in mind that uppercase A is decimal  65  hexadecimal 41 , lowercase a is decimal 97  hexadecimal 61 , and lower- case z is decimal 122  hexadecimal 7A .  You can also add many other effects, including the animation effects that   are available in previous code samples in this chapter.   Animation Effects with  jQuery and CSS3      63  Additional Code Samples on the CD  The HTML5 Web page JQSlideShow1.html illustrates how to create a  slideshow with JPG images using jQuery, which uses the following code block  to determine the next HTML   element  which wraps around to the first  image in the list when we reach the right-most image  and adds the show at- tribute, as shown here: next = curr.next  .length ? curr.next   :                curr.parent  .children ':first' ;  next.addClass "show" ;  The  HTML5  Web  page  JQSketchSolid1.html  on  the  CD  illustrates  how to create a rudimentary sketching program with jQuery and CSS3 in an  HTML5 Web page.

The jQuery plugin rotate3di for 3D animation enables you to animate   HTML content, along with other visual effects, and its homepage is here:  http:  www.zachstronaut.com projects rotate3di  You  can  also  combine  jQuery  with  SVG  instead  of  dynamically  creating     elements  that  are  styled  with  CSS3  selectors.  The  accompanying  CD  contains the HTML5 Web page JQArchDoubleEllipse1Rotate1.html that  illustrates how to combine jQuery with SVG. However, this code is similar to  earlier code samples, so its contents are omitted from this chapter.  The HTML5 Web page JQBouncingBalls1.html on the CD illustrates  how to render a set of vertically bouncing balls in a jQuery HTML5 Web page.

This section provides  three links with various tips and some performance benchmarks.  The first link is an article written by Christian Heilmann that contains five   performance-related tips:  html5-perform-better   http:  christianheilmann.com 2013 01 25 five-things-you-can-do-to-make-  The second link provides performance benchmarks  and it differs slightly   from one of Christian’s recommendations :  http:  blog.tumult.com 2013 02 28 transform-translate-vs-top-left ?utm_  source=html5weekly&utm_medium=email  The third link is in an article on Opera’s Website, comparing the perfor-  mance of CSS3 and jQuery animation:  "CSS3 wins the race by lengths. The huge difference in performance is be- cause the browser's CSS processor is written in C++ and native code executes  very fast whereas jQuery  JavaScript  is an interpreted language and the brows- er can’t predict JavaScript ahead in time, in terms of what event will occur next."  The preceding quote is from the following Website:  http:  dev.opera.com articles view css3-vs-jquery- animations comments The preceding Website also states the following:  “Although the results above indicate that you should use CSS3 for anima- tions, you should bear in mind the advantages and disadvantages we discussed  earlier on in the article. You need to keep in mind that a fair amount of people  still use Internet Explorer 7 and 8, so you should use jQuery if your animations  absolutely need to work the same in those older browsers.”  The preceding links provide guidelines for improving the performance of  your HTML5 Web pages. However, you might need to perform a more detailed  analysis  of  the  contents  of  your  HTML5  Web  page  in  order  to  fine-tune  its  performance. Perform an Internet search for articles that discuss performance  issues in Web pages with similar animation effects.  Summary  This  chapter  introduced  you  to  jQuery  graphics  and  animation  effects,  along with code samples that illustrated how to use jQuery functions to create  simple animation effects.

C H A P T E R  4  JQUERY UI CONTROLS  This chapter introduces you to various jQuery UI controls, along with code   samples that show how to render some jQuery UI controls in HTML5  Web pages. The rationale for using these UI controls is simple: they do  not require nearly as much effort as writing your own custom UI controls, nor  do you need to maintain the code for these controls. Moreover, these UI con- trols work well on a range of browsers.  You will see examples of using jQuery to render accordions, buttons, com- bo  boxes,  date  pickers,  progress  bars,  sliders,  and  tabs.  In  addition,  you  will  learn  how  to  programmatically  handle  user-initiated  events  involving  jQuery  UI controls. There are more UI controls available that you can learn about by  consulting the jQuery homepage.  The jQuery UI controls in this chapter are presented alphabetically, so feel  free to skip around to read about the UI controls that are of interest to you.  Although information about these UI controls is available in the jQuery docu- mentation, this is a primer book, so it’s more appropriate to include a list of UI  controls in one convenient location instead of telling you to “go read the docu- mentation.” After you have read this chapter, you will also be in a better position  to understand the lengthy code sample at the end of the chapter. The sample  illustrates an HTML5 Web page with various jQuery UI controls in a manner  that reflects a somewhat realistic scenario.  This chapter also contains code samples for handling user click events that  trigger updates in other  sometimes graphical  elements that are defined else- where in the same HTML5 Web page. This approach makes it easy to under- stand how to implement event-related functionality, and hopefully you will be  able to adapt the code samples in this chapter to your specific needs.  One point to keep in mind is that the HTML5 Web pages in this chapter  contain both HTML markup and jQuery code. For longer Web pages, it makes    68      jQuery Pocket Primer  more sense to put jQuery code in a separate file  just as we have done with CSS  stylesheets . However, almost every Web page in this chapter is short  between  one page and 1.5 pages , so it’s a choice based on convenience to keep the code  in a single file.  A second point involves how to write your own jQuery plugins, which is  beyond the scope of this book. You can find online tutorials that show you how  to write jQuery plugins if you cannot find any existing jQuery plugins that meet  your needs.  Using jQuery 2.0 in this Chapter  The following code samples work correctly on jQuery 1.5, but they do not   work correctly with jQuery 2.0.0:   cid:81  JQUIProgressBar1.html  no progress bar displayed    cid:81  JQUISlider1.html  no slider displayed    cid:81  JQUISliderColors1.html  no slider displayed    cid:81  JQUIThemes1.html  use plugin available on github   Keep  in  mind  that  future  versions  of  jQuery  will  undoubtedly  resolve  these  issues and other inconsistencies that you might encounter in your own HTML  Web pages that use jQuery.  Accordion Effects  jQuery UI supports an accordion widget, which contains one or more “fold-  ers” whose contents are shown only when users click on a particular folder.   Listing 4.1 displays the contents of the HTML5 Web page JQUIAccor-  dion1.html, which illustrates how to render an accordion widget. LISTING 4.1  JQUIAccordion1.html                jQuery Accordion     <link href="JQUIAccordion1.css" rel="stylesheet"                                         type="text css">   <link type="text css"          href="css themename jquery-ui-1.8.14.custom.css"  >                              jQuery UI Controls      69    <link href="JQUIAccordion1.css"          rel="stylesheet" type="text css">                   Section 1                    This is the first section of the accordion.                  Section 2                    This is the second section of the accordion.                         List item one              List item two              List item three                             Section 3                    This is the section of the third accordion.                 Section 4                    This is the section of the fourth accordion.                                                                                   $ document .ready function   {       $ "accordion" .accordion  ;     } ;            70      jQuery Pocket Primer  Listing 4.1 is straightforward: after the usual file references, there is an HTML    element that references a HTML   element  whose id attri- bute has value accordion . This HTML   element also contains 4 HTML    elements that refer to four different “sections” in the HTML Web page. The   element contains jQuery code that renders the contents of  this HTML   element as an accordion in literally one line of code, shown  here:      $ document .ready function   {      $ "accordion" .accordion  ;    } ;   In fact, the code in the preceding   element is the typical manner in  which jQuery renders the contents of an HTML   element as a jQuery  widget:  $ "theDivID" .widgetType  ; In this example, the widgetType function is the jQuery accordion   func- tion. You can create different accordion effects by overriding some of the de- fault CSS definitions for a jQuery accordion. For example, insert the following  section of code before the first section of the accordion in Listing 4.1, and see  how this changes the effect of selecting each section in the accordion: <h3  class="ui-accordion-header  ui-helper-reset  ui-state-ac- tive ui-corner-top">        Section 1     LISTING 4.2  JQUIAccordion1.css inner1 {   float: left;   background-col33r:F00;   width: 200px;   height:200px; }  inner2 {   float: left;   background-color:FF0;   width: 200px;   height:200px; }  inner3 {   jQuery UI Controls      71    float: left;   background-color:00F;   width: 200px;   height:200px; } The three selectors in Listing 4.2 match  their  corresponding  HTML     el- ements  in  Listing  4.1,  which  renders  three rectangular shapes with red, yel- low, and blue, respectively. This effect  is visible when users click on the lowest  folder   labeled  “Section  4”   in  the  ac- cordion. In a sense, an accordion can be  viewed  as  a  set  of  vertical  tabs,  where  each  tab  contains  whatever  HTML  content  you  want  to  render,  including  graphics-like effects.  Launch the HTML5 Web page in  Listing  4.1  and  click  on  each  “folder”  in  the  rendered  accordion,  which  will  reveal the contents of the currently se- lected folder and also hide the contents  of the other folders of this accordion.  FIGURE 4.1  A jQuery accordion on a  Nexus S 4G with Android ICS.  Figure 4.1 displays the result of rendering JQUIAccordion1.html in List- ing 4.1 in a landscape-mode screenshot taken from an Android application run- ning on a Nexus S 4G with Android ICS.  Buttons  Buttons are obviously important in Web pages, especially for submitting  form-based  data,  and  jQuery  provides  significant  support  for  button-related  functionality. You can define CSS3 selectors to apply whatever styling effects  you need to HTML buttons, including gradients and shadow effects.  Listing  4.3  displays  the  contents  of  the  HTML5  Web  page  JQUIBut- tons1.html, which illustrates how to render buttons in an HTML Web page.  The CSS stylesheet JQUIButtons1.css is omitted because its contents are the  same as Listing 4.2.

This extra class is redundant in this code snippet, but it  shows you the flexibility of specifying a set of HTML elements that you want to  convert into jQuery buttons.  The next block of code renders three HTML   elements with colors  that are specified in their corresponding selectors that are defined in the associ- ated CSS stylesheet.  Launch the HTML Web page in Listing 4.3, and when you click on the top  row of buttons  which includes the anchor link , the rectangles change colors.  For example, the buttons change color whenever users click on them because  of the following code: $ "button" .click function   {      ++clickCount;     color1 = divColors[ clickCount  % divColors.length];     $ "inner1" .css {background: color1} ; } ;  In the preceding event handler, the colors are selected from a JavaScript array  called divColors that contains a set of colors.

Check Boxes and Radio Buttons  jQuery enables you to add event handlers to HTML checkboxes and radio   buttons so that you can determine which ones that users have selected.  Listing 4.4 displays the contents of JQUICheckBoxRadio1.html that il- lustrates how to render a checkbox and a set of radio buttons in an HTML Web  page.

You can find the state of the checkbox whose name attribute has the value   checkbox1 with this event handler:   76      jQuery Pocket Primer  $ "input[name='checkbox1']" .click function   {    $ "input1" .val "checkbox1" ; } ; Similarly, you can determine which radio button is checked with this code: $ "input[name='radio']" .click function   {    $ "input1" .val $ this .val   ; } ; In  addition,  you  can  also  check  which  radio  button  is  selected  with  the  following code snippet: var value = $ "input[@name= fieldname] :checked"  .val  ; In the preceding snippet, you need to replace fieldname with the correspond- ing name in the form field. $ 'input:radio[ name="postage" ]' .change  function  {   if  $ this .is  ':checked'   && $ this .val    == 'Yes'  {      append goes here   } } ; Figure  4.3  displays  the  result  of  rendering  JQUICheckBoxRadio1.html  in  Listing 4.4 in a Chrome browser on a MacBook.  FIGURE 4.3  Checkboxes button in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  Combo Boxes  jQuery provides support for HTML combo boxes, and you can attach event   handlers to detect events that are associated with those HTML elements.  Listing 4.5 displays the contents of JQUIComboBox1.html that illustrates  how to render a combo box in an HTML Web page, and to execute a block of  code whenever users select a different value in the combo box. LISTING 4.5  JQUIComboBox1.html                 jQuery ComboBox     <link type="text css"    jQuery UI Controls      77          href="css themename jquery-ui-1.8.14.custom.css"  >                                    ComboBoxInfo {       position: relative;       font-size: 20px;       top: 10px;       width: 50%;       height: 50px;    }                                    My ComboBox:                  Value 1          Value 2          Value 3                     Value 4            Value 5            Value 6                          You selected:                                                                                    $ document .ready function   {       $ "ComboBox" .change function   {   78      jQuery Pocket Primer             display the selected value         $ "selected1" .val             $ "ComboBox option:selected" .text   ;       } ;     } ;           Listing 4.5 is straightforward:  the first section references the required jQuery  files, followed by an HTML   element, and then the definition of the  items in a combo box.  Whenever users change the selected item in the combo box, this block of   code is executed: $ "ComboBox" .change function   {        display the selected value     $ "selected1" .val          $ "ComboBox option:selected" .text   ; } ; Figure  4.4  displays  the  result  of  rendering  JQUIComboBox1.html  in  Listing 4.5 in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  FIGURE 4.4  Combo box in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  Date Pickers  jQuery supports “date picker” functionality that enables you to set the past,  current, and future dates, as well as the ability to modify those dates in a con- textually relevant manner.  Listing  4.6  displays  the  contents  of  the  HTML5  Web  page  JQUIDat- ePicker1.html  that  illustrates  how  to  render  a  jQuery  datepicker  wid- get  in  an  HTML  Web  page.

Next,  the  HTML    element specifies the container of the three HTML   elements,  followed  by  a  block  of  code  that  converts  three  HTML    fields  into  jQuery datepicker widgets, shown here:   $ "date1" .datepicker  ;   $ "date2" .datepicker  ;   $ "date3" .datepicker  ; You can specify a future date and when you want to change that future date,  jQuery will display the previous and next months that are relative to that date,  as shown here:    set date to the future  var futureDate = "07 07 2017"; $ "date3" .datepicker "setDate",futureDate ; Figure 4.5 displays the result of rendering JQUIDatePicker1.html in Listing  4.6 in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  FIGURE 4.5  A date picker in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  Progress Bars  You can create and update progress bars very easily using jQuery. Listing  4.7 displays the contents of JQUIProgressBar1.html and illustrates how to  render a progress bar in an HTML Web page.   jQuery UI Controls      81  LISTING 4.7  JQUIProgressBar1.html               jQuery Progress Bar       <link  rel="stylesheet"  type="text css"    href="http:  ajax. googleapis.com ajax libs jqueryui 1.8 themes base jquery-ui. css" >            <script      src="http:  code.jquery.com jquery-migrate-1.1.0.js">                       progressBarDiv1 {       width: 30%;     }                            Progress Bar:                              Progress Bar Value:                            Set New Value:                       $ document .ready function   {   82      jQuery Pocket Primer     $ "progressBarDiv1" .progressbar { value: 40 } ;        $ "text1" .val $ "progressBarDiv1" .progressbar "value"  ;         $ "newValue" .bind "change", function   {          var newVal = $ "newVal" .val  ;          $ "progressBarDiv1" .progressbar "option", "value",                                            parseInt newVal  ;        } ;    } ;          Listing 4.7 references the usual jQuery files, followed by an HTML    element  whose id value is outer  that contains the HTML code for a progress  bar, the current value of the progress bar  which is initialized to 40 , and an  input field that allows users to change the value of the status bar.  The creation, display, and update of the value of the progress bar is handled   in the following code block:  $ document .ready function   {    $ "progressBarDiv1" .progressbar { value: 40 } ;     $ "text1" .val $ "progressBarDiv1" .progressbar "value"  ;     $ "newValue" .bind "change", function   {       var newVal = $ "newVal" .val  ;     $ "progressBarDiv1" .progressbar "option", "value",                                         parseInt newVal  ;    } ; } ;  As you can see, the preceding code block binds a change event to the second  HTML   field. When users enter a new value, the progress bar is up- dated with that value.  Figure 4.6 displays the result of rendering JQUIProgressBar1.html in   Listing 4.7 in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  FIGURE 4.6  Progress bar in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.   Additional Code Samples on the CD  jQuery UI Controls      83  ON THE CD  The  HTML5  Web  page  JQUISlider1.html  illustrates  how  to  render  horizontal and vertical sliders in an HTML Web page, and a key block of code  is shown here: $ document .ready function   {      $ "sliderDiv1" .slider {          orientation: 'horizontal',          min: 0,          max: 200,          step: 10,          value: 100      } ; } One simple use of jQuery sliders is to use them to control the speed of anima- tion effects  which can also be done with a spinner .  The HTML5 Web page JQUIAnimSlider1.html illustrates how to use a   slider widget to control an animation effect.   Currently, jQuery does not provide scroll pane widgets, but you still have  some options available. One option is to use HTML5 progress bars, which are  simple  to  use  and  they  provide  some  “reasonable”  functionality.  If  HTML5  progress bars are insufficient for your needs, you may use a jQuery plugin that  supports scroll pane widgets, such as the jScrollPane plugin whose homepage  is here:  http:  jscrollpane.kelvinluck.com  The jScrollPane plugin provides the jScrollPane- .min. js JavaScript file, as well as a CSS stylesheet  jScrollPane.css  that you can  override with your own customizations.  This  plugin  provides  over  20  demos  that  show  you  how  to  create  scroll  bars  horizontal, vertical, or both , the use of arrow buttons, its scrollTo and  scrollBy methods, how to style scrollbars in an IFRAME, and various other  effects.  The jQuery tab widget supports various options, methods, and events, and  the HTML5 Web page JQUITabs.html illustrates how to render tabs in an  HTML Web page.  jQuery  UI  provides  very  nice  support  for  switching  between  different  themes, which consist of different look-and-feel effects that are applied to wid- gets and text. You can find very good information about jQuery themes on these  Websites:  http:  jqueryui.com docs Theming http:  jqueryui.com docs Theming API http:  jqueryui.com docs ThemingUsing_ThemeRoller_and_Themes The  HTML5  Web  page JQUIThemes1.html  illustrates  how  to  dynami-  cally apply different themes to an HTML Web page with a set of widgets:   84      jQuery Pocket Primer  http:  midnightprogrammer.net post Change-Page-Themes-Dynamically-  Using-JQuery-Theme-Roller.aspx  NOTE  The theme switcher is no longer supported as of jQuery UI  1.9, but you can use the “Super-Theme-Switcher” that is  available on github: https:  github.com harborhoffer Super-Theme-Switcher  Create “Exploding” Effects  The following example is purely for fun, and you might even find a good  use for the jQuery effect   function, which enables you to create some nice  visual effects.  The HTML5 Web page JQUIEffects1.html illustrates how to horizon- tally shake and then “explode” an HTML   element and its HTML    child elements.  The   element defines a click handler for the container HTML    element by means of method chaining that uses the jQuery effect    method, as shown here: $ "outer" .effect 'shake', {times:3}, 300             .effect 'highlight', {}, 3000             .hide 'explode', {}, 1000 ; When  users  click  on  this  element,  it  will  first  shake  horizontally  three  times   each time for 300 milliseconds , then change the color to a highlight effect.  After 3 seconds, it will create an “exploding” effect that lasts for one second.  The HTML5 Web page JQUITravel1.html illustrates how to use some  of the UI components that you saw earlier in this chapter. The validation details  have been omitted in order to illustrate how to manipulate the UI components  in a code sample of reasonable length, using techniques that you can use in your  own Web pages.

You learned how to use the following jQuery UI controls:   cid:81   cid:31 Accordion effects   cid:81   cid:31 Buttons    cid:81   cid:31 Check boxes and radio buttons    cid:81   cid:31 Combo boxes    cid:81   cid:31 Date pickers    cid:81   cid:31 Dialog boxes    cid:81   cid:31 Progress bars    cid:81   cid:31 Scroll panes    cid:81   cid:31 Sliders    cid:81   cid:31 Tabs    cid:81   cid:31 Theming jQuery UI     cid:81   cid:31 ThemeRoller and themes    C H A P T E R  5  OTHER HTML5 TECHNOLOGIES  This chapter provides an overview of several HTML5-related technolo-  gies and code samples for many of these technologies. Although you can  use the HTML5 technologies in this chapter without jQuery, it makes  sense to discuss jQuery plugins for various HTML5 technologies. Since new  jQuery plugins are continually being written, compare the latest jQuery plugins  with the plugins that are covered in this chapter.  The  HTML5  technologies  in  this  chapter  are  presented  according  to  their  W3C  status:  W3C  Recommendation   REC ,  Candidate  Recommenda- tion  CR , Last Call  LC , Working Draft  WD , and experimental APIs. The  HTML5  technologies  in  each  section  are  presented  alphabetically.  This  ap- proach enables you to quickly determine the status of each HTML5 technology,  which is the main advantage over using a pure alphabetical listing of HTML5  technologies.  The first part of this chapter briefly describes the stages of the W3C pro- cess, after which you will discover that the HTML5 technologies that are cur- rently in the REC status are SVG, MathML, CORS, and the Geolocation APIs. The second part of this chapter contains the HTML5 technologies with a  W3C CR status, which includes the Battery API and the Vibration API. You will  also learn about XHR2  currently in WD status , which includes an example of  the new FormData object.   The third part of this chapter contains a code sample that illustrates drag  and drop for JPG files via jQuery  which is simpler than “pure” HTML5 Drag  and Drop APIs , an example of invoking some of the HTML5 file APIs in jQue- ry, and finally a jQuery plugin for obtaining Geolocation information about us- ers. You will also learn about the jQuery plugins jStorage and jStore that  provide a layer of abstraction on top of the HTML5 Storage APIs. The final part  of this chapter provides an overview of the History APIs, which is an HTML5  technology whose W3C status is WD.   88      jQuery Pocket Primer  If you have the choice  and perhaps the “luxury” , you probably prefer ease  of coding instead of getting “bogged down” in long and tedious code samples  when there are simpler alternatives available. For example, the code sample  that uses jQuery for HTML5 Drag and Drop  DnD  is much more straightfor- ward than a code sample that directly invokes the existing HTML5 DnD APIs.  The other advantage of simpler code samples is that they will quickly in- troduce you to a number of HTML5 technologies, after which you will be in a  better position to explore the nuances of those HTML5 technologies. Another  scenario is to combine jQuery Mobile with other toolkits, such as PhoneGap   discussed in Chapter 10  or appMobi  not discussed in this book . Toolkits such  as PhoneGap provide support for hardware functionality; you can also combine  PhoneGap with jQuery Mobile. Your application requirements and constraints  will determine your choice of toolkits  if any  for your mobile Web applications. In general, jQuery and jQuery Mobile will probably work with other tool- kits, but you ought to check online forums for any issues that might affect your  Web applications. Finally, if you prefer not to use jQuery plugins, you can per- form an Internet search to find online tutorials that illustrate to create HTML5  Web pages using pure HTML5 APIs for all the HTML5 technologies that are  covered in this book.   The Stages in the W3C Review Process   If you are unfamiliar with the various stages of the W3C process, the fol-  lowing brief description  from earliest stage to final stage  is provided below.  A WD  “Working Draft”  document is the first form of a standard that is  publicly  available.  Comments  are  widely  accepted  but  not  guaranteed  to  be  incorporated, and this document could differ significantly from its final form.  A LC  “Last Call”  status involves the creation of a public record of the  responses of a working group to all comments about a specification. This stage  also handles bug reports about a specification. Incidentally, HTML5 reached  LC status in the W3C in May 2011.  A CR  “Candidate Recommendation”  status is firmer than the WD docu- ment, where major features have been finalized. The goal is to elicit assistance  from the development community regarding the extent to which the standard  can be implemented.  A PR  “Proposed Recommendation”  status means that the standard has  passed two previous stages, and at this point the document is submitted to the  W3C for final approval.  A REC  “Recommendation”  status is the final stage of a ratification pro- cess, comparable to a published technical standard in many other industries.  The criterion for the specification becoming a W3C Recommendation is “two  100% complete and fully interoperable implementations.”  Recall that Chapter 1 describes some of the groups that create specifica- tions, with detailed information about APIs for the technologies that are dis- cussed in this chapter.   Other HTML5 Technologies      89  HTML5 APIs in W3C Recommendation Status  REC   You might be surprised to discover that SVG and MathML have a REC sta- tus. Both of these technologies are mature and are included under the HTML5  umbrella. However, neither topic is covered in this book.  HTML5 Geolocation  Geolocation allows users to share their current location, which may be deter- mined by the following methods:   cid:81  Cell tower   cid:81  GPS hardware on the device   cid:81  IP address   cid:81  Wireless network connection  The actual method used depends on the browser and the capabilities of the  device. The browser then determines the location and passes it back to the Geo- location API. Note that the W3C Geolocation specification mentions that there  is no guarantee that the Geolocation API returns the device's actual location.  The geolocation object is a child object of window.navigator, and you  can check if your browser supports geolocation with the following type of  code block: if window.navigator.geolocation  {      geolocation supported } else {      geolocation not supported } The  W3C  Geolocation  API  enables  you  to  obtain  geolocation  information  in  a  browser  session  that  is  running  on  a  device.  The  geolocation  ob- ject  is  available  in  the  global  window.navigator  object,  accessed  via  window.navigator.geolocation.  Note that the Geolocation API requires users to allow a Web application to   access location information:   cid:81  The geolocation object contains the following three methods:   cid:81  getCurrentPosition successCallback, errorCallback, op-  tions     cid:81  watchPosition successCallback, errorCallback, options    cid:81  clearWatch watchId    The method getCurrentPosition    tries to get geolocation informa- tion. It uses the successCallback method if it is successful; otherwise, it calls  the errorCallback method in its argument list.    90      jQuery Pocket Primer  The  method  watchPosition    obtains  the  geolocation  at  regular  in- tervals, and it also returns a watchId value.  Success and failure are handled  through the two JavaScript methods in its list of arguments.  Finally,  the  method  clearWatch watchId   stops  the  watch  process   based on the value of watchId.   The major difference between the first two methods is that the watchPo- sition   method will return a value immediately upon being called, and the  returned value uniquely identifies that watch operation.  A table that displays support for Geolocation on desktop and mobile brows-  ers is here:  http:  caniuse.com geolocation  Obtain a User’s Position with getCurrentPosition    The PositionOptions object is an optional parameter that can be passed  to the getCurrentPosition   method and watchPosition   methods. All  of the properties in the PositionOptions object are optional as well.  For example, you can define an instance of a PositionOptions object by   means of the following JavaScript code block: var options = {    enableHighAccuracy: true,    maximumAge: 60000,    timeout: 45000 }; Next, we can invoke the getCurrentPosition   method by specifying a Ja- vaScript success function, a JavaScript error function, and the previously de- fined options variable, as shown here: navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition successCallback,                                           errorCallback,                                           options ;  Track a User’s Position with watchPosition    This method is useful when an application requires an updated position  each time that a device changes location. The watch operation is an asynchro- nous operation that is invoked as shown here: var watchID = null;  var options = { enableHighAccuracy: true, timeout: 30000 };  if  window.navigator.geolocation  {     watchID = navigator.geolocation.watchPosition                  successCallback,errorCallback, options ;  } else {    alert 'Your browser does not support geolocation.' ; }  function successCallback position  {    Other HTML5 Technologies      91     console.log "Success obtaining the device location" ; }     Error obtaining the location function errorCallback error  {     console.log "Error obtaining the device location" ; } If your browser supports Geolocation, the JavaScript variable watcher is initial- ized via an invocation of the watchPosition   method of the geolocation  object. Notice the JavaScript functions successCallback   and errorCall- back   for handling success or failure, respectively.  In our case, these func- tions simply display a message in the browser’s console .  The W3C Geolocation API provides a method for clearing a watch opera-  tion by passing a watchId to the clearWatch   method, as shown here: navigator.geolocation.clearWatch watcher ;  After creating a new watch operation, you can remove that watch after suc-  cessfully retrieving the position of a device, as shown here: function successCallback position  {      navigator.geolocation.clearWatch watcher ;        Do something with a location here } As  you  can  see,  the  JavaScript  successCallback    function  does  nothing  more than “clear” the JavaScript variable watcher. The key point is that you  will continue receiving information until you clear this variable.  You can perform a Google search to find various JavaScript plugins that  support Geolocation. If you prefer to use a jQuery plugin for Geolocation, there  are several available, including this one:  http:  mobile.tutsplus.com tutorials mobile-web-apps html5-geolocation   HTML5 Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  CORS   In brief, the “same origin policy” allows scripts that originate from the same  site  and  protocol  to  execute,  and  they  can  access  each  other’s  methods  and  properties without restriction. This policy also restricts AJAX calls to the same  origin as the page  but with a “loophole” that circumvents this restriction when  dynamically loading   tags .  As a simple example, the following pair of URLs is from the same site but  with different protocols, so they do not meet the criteria for “same origin policy”: http:  foo.com https:  foo.com On the other hand, cross-origin resource sharing  CORS  specifies the ways in  which a Web server can allow its resources to be accessed by Web pages from    92      jQuery Pocket Primer  different domains. Although CORS is more flexible than “same origin policy,” it  does not allow access to resources by any and all requests.   In  simplified  terms,  the  CORS  specification  provides  support  for  cross- domain communication by means of a simple header exchange between a client  and a server.   Some of the new HTTP headers for the CORS specification are Options,  Origin,  and  Access-Control-Allow-Origin.  When  the  appropriate  CORS headers are provided, CORS makes it possible to make asynchronous  HTTP requests to other domains.  Keep the following point in mind: there is no single CORS API, but any  API that uses the cross-origin features may be referred to as a CORS API. In  practice, a CORS API uses the XMLHttpRequest object as a “container” for  sending and receiving the requisite headers for CORS, and also the withCre- dentials property that can be used for determining programmatically wheth- er or not an XMLHttpRequest object supports CORS.  For a more detailed description of CORS, perform an Internet search and   you will find many free articles with such information.  HTML5 APIs in W3C Candidate Recommendation Status  CR   This section of the chapter contains a set of HTML5 APIs that have Can- didate Recommendation status. Although the HTML5 technologies Navigation  Timing, RDFa, and Selectors have CR status, they are not discussed in this book.  The Battery API  The Battery API is maintained by the DAP  Device APIs  working group,  which provides information about the battery status of the hosting device. The  following simple code snippet from Battery1.html shows you how to write  the battery level to the console each time the level changes: navigator.battery.onlevelchange = function    {   console.log navigator.battery.level ; }; The next section contains an AJAX-based code sample shows you how to use the  new FormData object with XHR2, described below.  XMLHttpRequest Level 2  XHR2   The  XMLHttpRequest  Level  2  specification  supports  the  following  new   features:   cid:81  Handling byte streams such as File, Blob, and FormData objects for   upload and download    cid:81  Showing progress events during upload and download   Other HTML5 Technologies      93    cid:81  Making cross-origin requests   cid:81  Making anonymous requests  not HTTP Referrer    cid:81  Setting a timeout for the request  Before we look at an XHR2 code sample, we’ll start with a code sample that  shows you how to make a simple AJAX request, followed by an AJAX request  that uses jQuery.   Making AJAX Calls without jQuery  The  code  sample  in  this  section  shows  you  how  to  make  a  “traditional”  AJAX call. Later, we will look at how to accomplish the same task using jQuery.  The purpose of this example is to illustrate the fact that jQuery  once again   enables you to write simpler code that is easier to maintain, debug, and enhance  with additional functionality  which you already know from the code samples  you have seen throughout this book .  NOTE  You must launch BasicAjax1.html from an actual Web  server  not a file navigator  because this Web page reads the  contents of a local file called sample.xml.  LISTING 5.1 BasicAjax1.html            Basic Ajax         var xmlHTTP, myFile = "http:  localhost:8080 sample.xml";        var url = "http:  localhost:8080 sample.xml";     function loadXML url, callback  {      if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {            Chrome, Firefox, IE7+, Opera, and Safari         xmlHTTP = new XMLHttpRequest  ;      } else {            IE5 and IE6         xmlHTTP = new ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ;      }       xmlHTTP.onreadystatechange = callback;      xmlHTTP.open "GET", url, true ;      xmlHTTP.send  ;    }     function init   {   94      jQuery Pocket Primer       loadXML myFile, function   {        if xmlHTTP.readyState==4 && xmlHTTP.status==200  {          document.getElementById "myDiv" .innerHTML =                                          xmlHTTP.responseText;        }      } ;    }                  Listing  5.1  contains  a  JavaScript  function  init    that  is  executed  when  the  Web  page  is  loaded  into  a  browser.  The  init    function  invokes  the  loadXML    function  with  the  name  of  an  XML  document,  along  with  a  JavaScript function that is executed when the AJAX request is completed.   The loadXML   function contains conditional logic that determines how  to initialize the JavaScript variable xmlhttp, followed by a code block that sets  the name of the callback function, specifies a GET method and a URL in the  url variable  not shown in this code sample , and then makes the actual AJAX  request, as shown here: xmlHTTP.onreadystatechange = callback; xmlHTTP.open "GET", url, true ; xmlHTTP.send  ; When the AJAX request is completed, the HTML   element in Listing  5.1 is updated with the data that is returned by the AJAX request. In this code  sample, the XML document sample.xml is an SVG document containing 3  rectangles and is reproduced here:   <svg xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 2000 svg"      xmlns:xlink="http:  www.w3.org 1999 xlink"      width="100%" height="100%">   <rect x="50"  y="10" width="100" height="200"         stroke="blue" fill="red"  >   <rect x="200" y="10" width="100" height="200"         stroke="blue" fill="green"  >   <rect x="350" y="10" width="100" height="200"         stroke="blue" fill="blue"  >   If you are new to AJAX, then the code in Listing 5.1 might seem convoluted,  and perhaps even confusing. Fortunately, jQuery simplifies the process of mak- ing AJAX requests by shielding you from the lower-level details, as you will see  in the next section.   Other HTML5 Technologies      95  Making AJAX Calls with jQuery  This  example  is  the  modified  version  of  Listing  5.1,  which  adds  jQuery  functionality to the code. There are several jQuery methods that provide AJAX- based  functionality,  including  jQuery.load  ,  jQuery.get  ,jQuery. post  , and jQuery.ajax  .  NOTE  You must launch JQueryAjax1.html from an actual Web  server  not a file navigator  because this Web page reads the  contents of a local file called sample.xml.  Listing 5.2 displays the contents of JQueryAjax1.html that illustrates how to  use the first of these jQuery AJAX methods in an HTML Web page in order to  produce the same result as Listing 5.1. LISTING 5.2 JQueryAjax1.html             JQuery Ajax                                        var url = "http:  localhost:8080 sample.xml";      $ document .ready function   {       $ "myDiv" .load url, function   {} ;     } ;           Listing 5.2 contains only one line of code that performs an AJAX request via the  jQuery load   method, as shown here: $ "myDiv" .load url, function   {} ; The  result  executing  the  code  in  Listing  5.2  is  the  same  as  the  result  of  ex- ecuting the Listing 5.1. The contents of the HTML   element whose id  attribute is myDiv are replaced with the contents of sample.xml, and three  SVG-based rectangles are rendered.   96      jQuery Pocket Primer  Alternatively, you can use the jQuery.ajax   method as shown here:      $.ajax {        url:  url,        type: "get",        success: GotData,        dataType: 'xml'     } ;   In the preceding code block, you also need to define a JavaScript function called  GotData   where you would process the result of the Ajax invocation.  As you would expect, jQuery provides much more AJAX functionality. Spe-  cifically, jQuery provides support for the following callback hooks: beforeSend   fail   dataFilter   done   always   The functions beforeSend  , error  , and done   are intuitively named  and they behave as expected. The dataFilter   callback is the first callback  to receive data; after it performs its processing, the done   callback is invoked.  Finally, the always   callback is invoked, regardless of whether the result of  the AJAX invocation was successful or in error.  A concise example of jQuery code that makes an AJAX request using meth-  od chaining with several of the preceding APIs is here:    Assign handlers immediately after making the request,    and get a reference to the jqxhr object for this request var jqxhr = $.ajax  "example.php"       .done function   { alert "success" ; }      .fail function   { alert "error" ; }      .always function   { alert "complete" ; } ;      perform other work here ...      Set another completion function for the request above jqxhr.always function   { alert "second complete" ; } ;  If you want to explore more AJAX-related features in jQuery, a complete list of  jQuery AJAX methods is here:  http:  api.jquery.com category ajax  http:  api.jquery.com ajaxComplete  The next section contains a code sample that uses the new FormData object.   Other HTML5 Technologies      97  AJAX Requests using XMLHttpRequest Level 2  XHR2   Listing  5.3  displays AjaxForm.html,  which  illustrates  how  to  create  an   HTML5 Web page using the new FormData object and XHR2. LISTING 5.3 AjaxForm.html             Ajax Form        function sendForm form  {     var formData = new FormData form ;        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ;     xhr.open 'POST', form.action, true ;     xhr.onload = function e  {           do something here      };          xhr.send formData ;           Prevent page submission      return false;    }                             Listing 5.3 is straightforward. The   element contains a HTML    element with several input fields. Next, the form data is submitted via the Ja- vaScript function sendForm  , which creates a FormData object and then sub- mits the user-provided data via XHR2, as shown in this code block: var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest  ; xhr.open 'POST', form.action, true ; xhr.onload = function e  {   98      jQuery Pocket Primer         do something here }; xhr.send formData ;  ON THE CD  NOTE  The CD does not provide a PHP file xhr2.php, so the  HTML Web page AjaxForm1.html does not submit form  data to a server.  A final point to know: the XMLHttpRequest Level 2 specification supports  the transfer of binary data and also tracks the upload progress through the XML- HttpRequestUpload object. Consequently, XHR2 can be used for binary file  transfers via the File APIs and the FormData object.  If you need to use XHR2 in your HTML Web pages, an XHR2 library is   here:  https:  github.com p-m-p xhr2-lib  More tutorials and information regarding XHR2 are here:  http:  www.html5rocks.com en tutorials file xhr2   http:  www.matiasmancini.com.ar jquery-plugin-ajax-form-validation-ht-  ml5.html  HTML5 Drag and Drop  DnD   HTML5  Drag  and  Drop   DnD   enables  you  to  rearrange  the  layout  of  HTML elements in an HTML Web page. HTML4 does not have built-in sup- port for DnD, and creating such support requires considerably more JavaScript  code than a toolkit such as jQuery.   On the other hand, HTML5 provides APIs that support Drag and Drop in   HTML5 Web pages. HTML5 Drag and Drop emits the following events: drag dragend dragenter dragleave dragover dragstart drop In addition, the HTML5 DnD provides a source element, the data content, and  the target. Respectively, they represent the drag “start” element, the data being  dragged, and the “target” element.  In your HTML5 Web page, you attach event listeners to elements  with an   optional third parameter , as shown here:  myElement.addEventListener 'dragenter', handleDragEnter, false ; myElement.addEventListener 'dragleave', handleDragLeave, false ; myElement.addEventListener 'dragover',  handleDragOver,  false ; myElement.addEventListener 'dragstart', handleDragStart, false ;   Other HTML5 Technologies      99  Next, you define custom code in each of the JavaScript event handlers that will  be executed whenever the associated event occurs.  However, keep in mind that HTML5 Web pages with DnD functionality  still require browser-specific code, which means that you need to maintain the  code in multiple HTML5 Web pages if you want to support multiple browsers. Eric Bidelman has written an extensive and detailed blog entry that shows   you how to write an HTML5 Web page with Drag and Drop functionality:  http:  www.html5rocks.com en tutorials dnd basics  We will skip examples of “native” HTML5 DnD and proceed to an example   of using jQuery with HTML5 DnD, which is covered in the next section.  jQuery and HTML5 Drag and Drop  Drag and Drop is exceptionally simple in jQuery: only one line of code is   required for an HTML element.  Listing 5.4 displays the contents of the HTML5 Web page JQDragAnd- Drop1.html, which illustrates how easy it is to create an HTML5 Web page  with Drag and Drop using jQuery.

More information about jQuery Drag and Drop  including the list of available  options  is available here:  http:  jqueryui.com demos draggable   There are several jQuery plug-ins for drag-and-drop functionality that are listed  here:  http:  plugins.jquery.com projects plugins?type=45  You can also use jQuery Mobile with HTML5 DnD, and although we will not  discuss  an  example   due  to  space  constraints ,  you  can  perform  an  Internet  search to find tutorials and code examples, or you can start with the details in  this link:  http:  www.jsplugins.com Scripts Plugins View Jquery-Mobile-Drag-And-Drop   jQuery and HTML5 Local Storage  HTML5 provides both local storage and session storage that enable Web  pages to store data locally. Although they are not discussed in this book, you  can perform an Internet search to learn about their functionality. This section  introduces you to jQuery plugins that provide a layer of abstraction over local  storage and session storage.  The jQuery plugin jStorage is a cross-browser plugin that enables you to  use jQuery syntax in order to manage data in local storage, and its homepage is  here:  http:  www.jstorage.info  The JStorage APIs enable you to get, set, and delete data in storage. You  can also check if storage is available, as well as the size of the stored data  in  bytes .

If this value does not exist, then the load_data_from_ server   JavaScript function  which is not implemented in this code sample   is invoked, and then the return value is stored in local storage.  You can also use the jQuery plugin jStore for HTML5 storage, which is a  cross-browser plugin that enables you to use jQuery syntax in order to manage  data in local storage. Its homepage is here:  http:  code.google.com p jquery-jstore source browse trunk src engines jS-  tore.Html5.js?r=6  Libraries for HTML5 Local Storage  A  number  of  JavaScript  toolkits  are  available  for  local  storage,  some  of  which use jQuery  and some do not use jQuery . This short section briefly de- scribes some of the available toolkits.  lscache emulates memcache functions using HTML5 localStorage for  caching data in a client browser, along with an expiration time for each data  item.   The lscache homepage is here: https:  github.com pamelafox lscache  If the localStorage limit  approximately 5MB  is exceeded, items that are  closest to their expiration date are removed. If localStorage is unavailable,  lscache does not cache anything  and all cache requests return null .  The lscache methods are set  , get  , remove  , and ﬂ ush  , and a   jQuery lscache plugin is available here:  https:  github.com mckamey  YQL LocalCache is a wrapper for YQL to support local storage, and its homep- age is here:  https:  github.com phunkei autoStorage  A sample invocation with YQL LocalCache with self-explanatory parameters is  here: yqlcache.get {   104      jQuery Pocket Primer    yql: 'select * from flickr.photos.search where text="warsaw"',   id: 'myphotos',   cacheage:   60*60*1000  ,   callback: function data  {     console.log data ;   } } ; The returned data in the callback is an object with two properties: data  the  YQL data  and type  ‘cached’ for cached data or ‘freshcache’ . You can get ad- ditional code samples here:  https:  github.com codepo8 yql-localcache  Savify is a jQuery plugin for automatically recording a user’s progress in a form  while it is being completed. Its homepage is here:  https:  github.com blackcoat Savify  jQuery and HTML5 File APIs  ON THE CD  The HTML5 File APIs enable you to create, read, and write files on the file  system. The first step is to obtain access to the HTML5 FileSystem, after which  you can perform file-related operations. You can read about these APIs and see  some code examples here  and make sure you check whether or not your target  browser is supported :  http:  blueimp.github.com jQuery-File-Upload  http:  www.htmlgoodies.com html5 other responding-to-html5-filereader-  events.html The CD contains the HTML Web page JQFileInfo1.html, which illustrates  how to use jQuery in order to display the attributes of a file that is selected by  users.  A  more  interesting   and  useful   example  is JQFileUpload2.html  in  Listing 5.6, which illustrates how to use jQuery and XHR2 to upload files.  LISTING 5.6 JQFileUpload2.html                  File Upload with XHR2                               Other HTML5 Technologies      105     $ document .ready function    {       var url = "http:  localhost:8080 ";        $ "body" .on "change", 'fileUploader', function   {             Prepare post data          var data = new FormData  ;           data.append 'uploadfile', this.files[0] ;                  invoke the jQuery .ajax method:          $.ajax {            url: url,            type: 'POST',            contentType: false,            processData: false,            data: data,            success:  function data  {                            do something here                      },              dataType: 'text'           } ;        } ;      } ;                           Listing  5.6  contains  an  HTML    field  that  enables  users  to  select  a  file from the file system. After a file is selected, the jQuery “change” event is  triggered, and an XHR2 FormData object  discussed earlier in this chapter  is  created and populated, as shown here: var data = new FormData  ;  data.append 'uploadfile', this.files[0] ; The selected file is uploaded via the jQuery .ajax   method, which contains  a “success” function that is invoked after the AJAX request has been completed  successfully.  Note that you must set the value of contentType and processData to   false, or you will get the following error in the Web Inspector: Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation  The following link provides an explanation regarding these two parameters:  http:  stackoverflow.com questions 12431760 html5-formdata-file-upload-  with-rubyonrails   106      jQuery Pocket Primer  If you want to use a jQuery plugin for uploading files in HTML5 Web pag- es, there are several available, such as the cross-browser jQuery plugin jque- ry-ﬁ ledrop. Its homepage is here:  https:  github.com weixiyen jquery-filedrop  HTML5 History APIs  Prior to HTML5, the browser support for history-related APIs provided  limited functionality. You could find the number of items in the browser his- tory, move forward and backward, and several links backward, as shown here: console.log history.length ; console.log history.forward   ; console.log history.back   ; console.log history.go -2  ;  Several new APIs are available, as shown here:  history.pushState data, title, url ; history.replaceState data, title, url ;  The parameters in the history.pushState   method are as follows:   cid:81   cid:31 data is some type of structured data, assigned to the history item.    cid:81  title is the name of the item in the history drop-down that is dis-  played by the browser’s back and forward buttons.    cid:81  url is the  optional  URL that is displayed in the address bar. The parameters in the history.replaceState   method are the same as the  history.pushState   method, except that the former updates information  that is already in the browser’s history.  In  addition,  there  is  the  new popstate  event,  which  occurs  when  uses   view their browser history, and you can use it in the following manner: window.addEventListener "popstate", function event  {      do something here  } ; Keep in mind that different browsers implement HTML5 browser history in  different ways, so the following JavaScript toolkit is useful:  https:  github.com balupton History.js   The History.js toolkit supports jQuery, MooTools and Prototype. In HTML5  browsers, you can modify the URL directly without resorting to hashes  such as  example.com  foo … . In addition, changing the fragment does not trigger  a page reload.   Other HTML5 Technologies      107  HTML5 Offline Web Applications  The purpose of offline Web applications is simple:  users can work on an  application even when they are disconnected from the Internet. When users do  have access to the Internet, their data changes are synchronized so that every- thing is in a consistent state.  A Website that contains demos, additional links, and tutorial-like informa-  tion is here:  http:  appcachefacts.info   The HTML5 specification requires a so-called “manifest file”  with “appcache”  as the suggested suffix  that contains the following three sections:   CACHE  the list of files that are going to be cached  NETWORK  the files outside the cache that can only be accessed online  FALLBACK  specifies the resource to display when users try to access non-  As a simple example, Listing 5.7 displays the contents of a sample manifest   cached resources   file called MyApp.appcache. LISTING 5.7 MyApp.appcache CACHE MANIFEST  Verson 1.0.0 CACHE:  Index.html Cachedstuff.html Mystyle.css Myimage.jpg  NETWORK: * FALLBACK:   noncached.html You must ensure that the manifest file is served with the following MIME type: text cache-manifest Second,  Web  applications  that  uses  offline  functionality  must  reference  the  manifest file at the top of one of its Web pages:   If you have a Web page that is hosted by a provider, you can verify that the Web  page contains the correct MIME type by issuing the following type of command: curl –I http:  www.myprovider.com mymanifest.manifest   108      jQuery Pocket Primer  Detecting Online and Offline Status  The simplest way to determine whether or not an application is offline in an   HTML5 Web page is with the following code snippet: if navigator.online  {      application is online } else {      application is offline } For mobile applications that use jQuery Mobile, you can use the following type  of code block: $ document .bind "offline", function   {      application is offline } Binding the offline event as shown in the preceding code block is useful for  handling situations whereby an application goes offline while users are actively  viewing an application.  In addition, you would send data to a server only when you are online, and   store data locally via HTML5 LocalStorage when you are offline.  The  jQuery  plugin  jquery-ofﬂ ine  is  a  cross-browser  plugin  that  enables you to use jQuery syntax for offline applications. Its homepage is here:  https:  github.com wycats jquery-offline  Summary  This  chapter  provided  an  overview  of  various  HTML5  technologies  and  grouped them according to their current W3C status. For your convenience,  these HTML5 technologies are listed alphabetically below:   cid:81   cid:31 CORS   cid:81  AJAX  XHR2    cid:81  Drag and Drop   cid:81  File APIs   cid:81  Forms   cid:81  Geolocation   C H A P T E R  6  INTRODUCTION TO SINGLE-PAGE  APPLICATIONS  This chapter provides an introduction to Single-Page Applications, com-  monly referred to as SPAs. The first part of this chapter briefly discusses  the  rationale  for  creating  a  single-page  application  in  JavaScript.  The  XHR2 section contains AJAX-related examples, starting with a generic AJAX  code sample, followed by a jQuery-based AJAX code sample. The second part of  this Chapter provides an overview of BackboneJS and Twitter Bootstrap.  The third part of this chapter contains an abbreviated introduction to Jade,  MongoDB, Mongoose, and NodeJS. The final portion of this chapter provides  code for a minimalistic SPA that you can enhance with your own custom code.  What is an SPA?  Let’s start with a whirlwind “review” of Web application architecture. First  there were servers that delivered static pages to Websites, which evolved into  servers that could deliver dynamically generated Web pages  using languages  such as PHP  to Websites. Next came AJAX, which provided partial-page re- fresh functionality that was more efficient and also created a better user experi- ence. Then, a collection of Comet-based solutions arose in order to make the  communication between browsers and servers more efficient. More recently,  HTML5 WebSockets provide bidirectional full duplex asynchronous communi- cation between browsers and servers via a persistent TCP connection using the  WebSocket protocol. This is an improvement over the HTTP protocol that is  the basis for all earlier Web applications.  During this time, various strategies were devised for the division of code  between the browser and the server. One approach involves a “thick server”  where most of the operations  such as generating dynamic Web pages and user  authentication validation  are performed, along with a “thin client”  or browser   that renders a Web page from a server but with limited additional functionality.   110      jQuery Pocket Primer  Modern Web Architecture  Recently there has been a proliferation of JavaScript toolkits that enable  people to develop Web applications with a “thick client” and “thin server.” Al- though there is a diversity of architectures  even among recent Websites , many  modern Web applications have the following architecture:   cid:81  DOM  contains read-only data    cid:81  Models  contain the state and data of the application    cid:81  Modules  small independent subsystems    cid:81  Views  they observe model changes via notifications  SPAs are based on the preceding characteristics of a modern Web application:   they have a model layer that handles data and view layers that read data from  models, so they can redraw the UI without involving a server round-trip, which  can give SPAs a more “native” feel to them. Fewer round-trips reduce the load  on the server, which is obviously another benefit.   However, keep in mind the following points. First, there is no “specifica- tion” for SPA, and that SPA is evolving and improving over time as a result of  the contributions from people in the community. Second, some toolkits that  have an SPA also use AJAX, which arguably breaks the “ideal” design of SPA.  Thus, different toolkits  and the applications that are based on those toolkits   have different implementations of SPA, which in turn increases the likelihood  that you will find a toolkit that is well suited to your specific needs.   The  MVC   Model-View-Controller   pattern  is  well  documented   plenty  of  online  information  is  available   and  has  been  popular  for  years;  however,  the concept of controllers can be absent from SPAs and from some JavaScript  toolkits.  “Traditional”  Web  applications  use  a  page  refresh  in  order  to  navi- gate between independent views, whereas JavaScript Web applications based  on SPA can retrieve  via AJAX  data from a server and dynamically rendered  data in different views in the same Web page. Routers are used for navigation  purposes because URLs are not updated while navigating to different views in  a SPA Web application.  Although controllers usually update the view when the model changes  and  vice  versa ,  most  JavaScript  MVC  frameworks  tend  to  differ  from  the  MVC  pattern in terms of their use of controllers. As designs evolve in a community,  variants emerge based on individual preferences and experiences. Since no in- dividual or organization promotes the idea of MVC, these variants are free to  co-exist.  Contrary to what you might read in online articles, BackboneJS does not  have an MVC pattern: controllers are absent in current versions.  Also, note that  the Controller object in early versions was renamed to the Router object in  later versions.  Some controller-like logic is located in BackboneJS views and   MVC and MV* Patterns   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      111  also  in BackboneJS  routers   the  latter  are  employed  to  manage  application  states . BackboneJS views receive notifications when there are model changes,  and the views are updated accordingly. BackboneJS can be best classified as  having an MV* architecture.  In addition, there are other models, such as the MVP  Model-View-Present- er  pattern and MVVM  Model-View-ViewModel, which is used in .NET frame- works and in KnockoutJS . MVP appears to be better suited to Web applica- tions in which there are numerous large views, and the role of the Presenter  overlaps with that of a controller.  You can learn more about MVC and MVP in this article: http:  martinfowler.com eaaDev uiArchs.html  Generating Web Pages in SPAs  As  you  already  know,  many  Web  pages  are  generated  dynamically  on  a  server that sends those Web pages to browsers. In modern Web applications,  one  solution  is  to  generate  Web  pages  using  client-side  templating.  Another  solution is to use code; this is the more traditional approach. The distinction  between server-rendered and client-rendered Web pages helps to reinforce the  fact that the server renders a given Web page, but the client renders subsequent  updates.  Handling Model-Related Events in SPAs  The two major options for handling model data changes are observables  and event emitters, and there is little difference between these two approaches.  When a change occurs, the code that is “bound” to that change event is trig- gered. For example, events are registered on objects: MyApp.on 'change', function   { ... } ; whereas observers are attached through global names: Framework.registerObserver window.MyApp,'change',function   {...} ; Observables usually have some type of name resolution system, where you use  strings  in  order  to  refer  to  objects.  A  global  name  resolution  system   where  names are strings rather than directly accessing objects  is often added for ob- servables in order to facilitate the use of observers, which can only be registered  when the objects they refer to have been instantiated.   Client-Side Technologies for SPAs  In brief, client-side technologies for an SPA include toolkits such as jQue- ry, BackboneJS, and Jade. However, you can certainly use other toolkits, such  as variants of BackBoneJS  Spine, Vertebrae, and so forth , or an entirely  different toolkit  such as EmberJS . In addition to Jade, there are other tem- plating engines available, including Mustache and Handlebars. Perform an  Internet search for information as well as a feature comparison of these toolkits.   112      jQuery Pocket Primer  BackboneJS  Backbone.js  is  an  open  source  JavaScript  toolkit  for  developing  struc-  tured Web applications, and its homepage is here:  http:  Backbone.js.org  Although Backbone.js  is  not  based  on  an MVC   Model-View-Controller   pattern,  there  are  some  similarities. Backbone.js  provides  models  with  key- value binding and custom events, collections with an API of enumerable func- tions, and views with declarative event handling, all of which is connected to your  existing API over a RESTful JSON interface. Backbone.js is an open-source  component of DocumentCloud, and it’s available on GitHub under the MIT soft- ware license, where you can find the source code, an online test suite, an example  application, a list of tutorials, and real-world projects that use Backbone.js.   Download Backbone.js from its GitHub repository: https:  github.com documentcloud backbone   A Brief Introduction to BackboneJS  The following subsections give you a simple overview of models, views, col- lections, and routers in BackboneJS. After you have read this section, you can  search for online tutorials that show you examples of BackboneJS applications. What is a Model?  According to the authors of Backbone: “Models are the heart of any JavaScript application, containing the interac- tive data as well as a large part of the logic surrounding it: conversions, valida- tions, computed properties, and access control.”  Whenever you create a new instance of a model, the initialize   meth- od is invoked  which is also the case when you instantiate a new view in Back- boneJS . A simple example is shown in the following code block: Vehicle = Backbone.Model.extend {     initialize: function  {         alert "I am a vehicle" ;     } } ; var vehicle = new Vehicle; You can set parameters in a model in one of two ways. One method is to use a  constructor, as shown here: var vehicle = new Vehicle {model: "Ford", make: "Mustang"} ; Another way is to use the set method, as shown here: vehicle.set {make: "Ford", model: "Mustang"} ; After setting property value pairs, you can retrieve their values as follows: var make  = vehicle.get "make" ;     "Mustang" var model = vehicle.get "model" ;    "Ford"   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      113  You can also set default values in the following manner:  Vehicle = Backbone.Model.extend {     defaults: {       make:   "Ford",       model:  "Mustang"     },       initialize: function  {         alert "I am a vehicle" ;     }    } ; Model Changes  You  can  listen  for  changes  to  the  model  and  execute  code  whenever  a   change is detected.  For example, here the new contents of the initialize method:  initialize: function  {    alert "I am a vehicle" ;     this.bind "change:model", function  {            var model = this.get "model" ;             alert "Changed my model to " + model ;    } ; } There are various other features available for manipulating models that you can  read in the online documentation. What is a View?  In simplified terms, Backbone views provide a visual representation of the  data models in an application. Moreover, Backbone views listen to events and  respond to changes in data models in order to ensure that data in a given view  is synchronized with its associated model. SearchView = Backbone.View.extend {     initialize: function  {         alert "A view of a vehicle." ;     } } ;     The initialize function is like a constructor in that    it is always called when you instantiate a Backbone View var search_view = new SearchView  ; What is a Collection?  A Collection in BackboneJS is an ordered set of models. Collections  are useful because you can include methods inside of them to fetch data from a  server, prepare that data before returning the collection, and set sample collec- tions for debugging testing.    114      jQuery Pocket Primer  Moreover,  you  can  add  event  listeners  and  attach  views  to  collections,   which is not the case for simple JavaScript arrays.  As a simple example, we can use the Model Vehicle that we created in  the previous section in order to create a Collection in Backbone as follows:  var Cars = Backbone.Collection.extend {   model: Vehicle } ;  var vehicle1 = new Vehicle { make: "Ford",  model: "Mustang"  } ; var vehicle2 = new Vehicle { make: "GM",    model: "Camaro"   } ; var vehicle3 = new Vehicle { make: "GM",    model: "Corvette" } ;  var myCars = new Cars [ vehicle1, vehicle2, vehicle3] ; console.log  myCars.models  ;    [vehicle1, vehicle2, vehicle3]  What is a Router?  BackboneJS  routers  are  used  for  mapping  URL  fragments  in  your  ap- plication   e.g.,  mapping  example.com * foo  to  shareFoo .  Routing  the  URLs  in  your  applications  via  URL  fragments  makes  them  useful  for  ap- plications  that  need  URL  routing  and  history  capabilities.  Defined  rout- ers  should  contain  at  least  one  route  and  a  function  to  map  to  that  particu- lar  route.  Keep  in  mind  that  routes  interpret  anything  after ""  tag  in  the  URL,  and  all  links  in  your  application  should  target  either " action"  or  "action."   As a simple example, the following code block defines a Backbone router:  var MyAppRouter = Backbone.Router.extend {     routes: {             matches http:  example.com you-can-put-anything- here         "*actions": "defaultRoute"      },     defaultRoute: function  actions  {            The variable passed in matches the variable             that is in the route definition "actions"         alert  actions  ;     } } ;     Initiate the router var appRouter = new MyAppRouter  ;     Start Backbone history  required for bookmarkable URLs  Backbone.history.start  ; This  concludes  a  bare-bones  introduction  to BackboneJS.  The  next  section  provides some useful links with more detailed information.   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      115  Useful Links  A collection of BackboneJS tutorials is here: http:  backbonetutorials.com  An example of using BackboneJS with jQuery Mobile: http:  coenraets.org blog 2012 03 using-backbone-js-with-jquery-mobile  http:  weblog.bocoup.com organizing-your-backbone-js-application-with-  modules   Backbone Boilerplate  Backbone-boilerplate  is  an  open  source  JavaScript  toolkit  that  pro- vides “boilerplate” functionality analogous to toolkits such as HTML5 Boiler- plate. Its homepage is here:  https:  github.com tbranyen backbone-boilerplate The set-up instructions for Backbone-boilerplate are available in the   readme.md file that is included in this distribution:  https:  github.com backbone-boilerplate grunt-bbb The set-up is somewhat lengthy  and beyond the constraints of this chap- ter , but it’s worth exploring this toolkit if you plan to use BackboneJS exten- sively in your code.  Variations of BackboneJS  There are many variations of BackboneJS  which are also extensions of   BackboneJS , some of which are listed here: pine.js joint.js ligament.js vertebrae.js bones.js  provides server-side functionality  hambone.js shinbone.js Space constraints in this chapter preclude a thorough discussion of these tool- kits, but you can perform an Internet search to find information about these  toolkits.   One other variant of BackboneJS is SpineJS, which uses controllers  even  though it is based on BackboneJS . Controllers in SpineJS provide the “glue”  in Web applications, and they provide the functionality of traditional controllers.  The following SpineJS code block defines a Spine controller with three  functions. The controller synchronizes changes in models to update views  and  vice versa . Compare this code with BackboneJS code blocks that you saw ear- lier in this chapter:    Controllers inherit from Spine.Controller:   116      jQuery Pocket Primer  var RecipesController = Spine.Controller.sub {   init: function  {     this.item.bind 'update',  this.proxy this.render  ;     this.item.bind 'destroy', this.proxy this.remove  ;   },    render: function  {        Handle templating     this.replace $ 'recipeTemplate' .tmpl this.item  ;     return this;   },    remove: function  {     this.$el.remove  ;     this.release  ;   } } ;  EmberJS  In addition to BackboneJS, there are various toolkits available, and one of   the most popular is EmberJS, whose homepage is here:  http:  emberjs.com  EmberJS applications download everything that is required to run during  the initial page load, which is consistent with SPA. One point to keep in mind  is that EmberJS adopts an MVC pattern as well as a heavy emphasis on routers,  and also a templating engine. EmberJS focuses on the “heavy lifting” to handle  some of the more burdensome JavaScript tasks. On the other hand, Backbone- JS has a much more minimalistic approach  but it can be enhanced with Back- bone Boilerplate .  As a simple illustration, the following code block shows you how to define   JavaScript objects in EmberJS. Person = Ember.Object.extend {   greeting: function msg  {     alert msg ;  } } ;  var person = Person.create  ;    alert message: My Name is Dave person.greeting "My name is Dave" ;  var person = Person.create {   name: "Jeanine Smith",   greeting: function   {   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      117      this.greeting "My name is " + this.get 'name'  ;   } } ;     alert message: My Name is Jeanine  person.greeting  ; You can extend objects in EmberJS, as shown here: var HappyPerson = Person.extend {   greeting: function msg  {     this._super greeting.toUpperCase   ;   } } ;  You can also add event listeners in EmberJS, as shown here:  person.addObserver 'name', function   {      do something after a name change } ;  person.set 'name", 'Oswald' ; An extensive comparison between BackboneJS and EmberJS is here:  http:  www.i-programmer.info programming htmlcss 4966-creating-web-  apps-the-camera-api.html  If BackboneJS and EmberJS are not a good fit for your needs, you can  perform an Internet search for other toolkits. You can also find various online  articles that discuss the merits of various toolkits, and sometimes you can find  articles that provide a direct comparison of various toolkits. One point to keep  in mind is that there is an abundance of toolkits available. If time is a constraint,  you might need to limit your analysis to a small number of toolkits so that you  can properly assess them.  Twitter Bootstrap  Twitter Bootstrap is an open source project for creating Websites and  Web  applications.  This  toolkit  contains  HTML-  and  CSS-based  design  tem- plates for UI Controls  such as forms, buttons, charts, navigation, and so forth ,  as well as user interactions.  Currently, Twitter Bootstrap is the most watched and forked reposi-  tory in GitHub, and you can download it here:  http:  twitter.github.com Bootstrap  http:  blog.getBootstrap.com  Twitter Bootstrap was designed primarily as a style guide to document  best practices, and also to assist people of diverse skill levels. Bootstrap supports  new HTML5 elements and syntax, and you can use Bootstrap as a complete kit  or to start something more complex.  Twitter Bootstrap was initially created for modern browsers, but it has  expanded its support to include all major browsers  including IE7 . In addition,    118      jQuery Pocket Primer  Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 supports tablets and smartphones, and its responsive  design means that its components are scaled according to a range of resolutions  and  devices,  thereby  providing  a  consistent  experience.  Moreover, Twitter  Bootstrap provides custom-built jQuery plugins, and it’s built on top of the  LESS toolkit. Some features of Twitter  Bootstrap 2.0 are tooltips, styled  stateful buttons, more table and form styling, and an improved structure for its  CSS source code  multiple files instead of a single monolithic file . Bootstrap  also  supports  styling  for  tabs,  navigation  bars,  form  controls,  navigation  lists,  labels, and others. If you prefer, you can create your own custom download if  you do not want to download the full toolkit.   Bootstrap requires HTML5 doctype, which is specified with this snippet:     Twitter Bootstrap sets basic global display, typography, and link styles   located  in scaffolding.less  of  the  distribution ,  including  the  following  examples:   cid:81   cid:31 Remove margin on the body   cid:81  Set background-color: white; on the body   cid:81  Use the @baseFontFamily, @baseFontSize, and @baseLineHeight   attributes as the typographic base    cid:81  Set the global link color via @linkColor and apply link underlines   only on :hover  Keep in mind that Twitter  Bootstrap 2.0 uses much of Normalize.css   which also powers HTML5 Boilerplate  instead of the ‘reset’ block in version  1 of Bootstrap.  Additional details are available here: http:  twitter.github.com bootstrap scaffolding.html One interesting Bootstrap feature is its support for progress bars using the  CSS classes .bar and .progress that are available in Bootstrap. As an illus- tration, the following code block shows how to render bars with different colors  based on custom attributes that start with the string progress-, as shown here:            <div class="progress progress-success" style="margin-bottom:                                               9px;">          <div class="progress progress-warning" style="margin-bottom:                                                9px;">            Introduction to Single-Page Applications      119  <div class="progress progress-danger" style="margin-bottom:                                               9px;">          Useful Links  The following links provide a sample application using Twitter  Boot-  strap, as well as a set of videos and tutorials:  https:  dev.twitter.com blog say-hello-to-Bootstrap-2 http:  webdesign.tutsplus.com tutorials workflow-tutorials twitter-Boot-  strap-101-tabs-and-pills   http:  twitter.github.com Bootstrap examples.html Here is an example of BackboneJS with Twitter Bootstrap: http:  coenraets.org blog 2012 02 sample-app-with-backbone-js-and-twit-  The following open source project uses Bootstrap with SaSS instead of   ter-Bootstrap   LESS:  https:  github.com jlong sass-twitter-Bootstrap  A Minimalistic SPA  The remainder of this chapter shows you how to set up several server-side  toolkits  for  creating  a  very  simple  SPA.  You  will  see  “bare  bones”  code  that  provides a starting point for an SPA that enables users to see the books that  their friends have read, along with other information, such as reviews, interest- ing book quotes, and so forth. This application uses the following technologies: Jade MongoDB Mongoose NodeJS The next section of this chapter provides a high-level description of the tech- nologies in the preceding list that have not been discussed already. The final  section of this chapter contains code blocks that will help you understand the  logic of the SPA application. As a suggestion, include additional toolkits  such  as BackboneJS and jQuery  in this SPA so that you can expand your skillset.  Jade  Jade is a popular templating language for NodeJS, and its homepage is here: http:  jade-lang.com  Download Jade here: https:  github.com visionmedia jadereadme   120      jQuery Pocket Primer  After you uncompress the Jade distribution, you can create a single Jade   JavaScript file with the following command: make jade.js  Note that you can also install Jade via npm  the package manager for Node-  JS  as follows: npm install jade Jade Code Samples  Jade uses HTML tags to generate HTML elements, the “” syntax to gen- erate id attributes, and the “.” syntax to generate class attributes. Indentation  specifies nesting of elements. For example, the following Jade code block: html   head   body     div     divmyid     div.myclass     p my paragraph generates the following HTML:                                my paragraph       Jade  supports  interpolation,  so  you  can  pass  data  to  a Jade  document.  For  example, suppose you have this data: {fname: john, lname: smith} and that you have this Jade element: div user {fname} {lname}  then the result is this HTML element:  john smith  Jade also supports comments  single and multi-line , conditional logic, a “case”  statement, filters, and iteration.  As a more concrete example, Listing 6.1 displays the contents of layout.  jade, which generates a very basic HTML5 Web page.   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      121  LISTING 6.1 layout.jade doctype 5 html   head     title= title     link rel='stylesheet', href=' css style.css'      script src=' js jquery-1.8.2.min.js'       script src=' js client.js'      script src=' js templates.js'    body       block content As you can see in Listing 6.1, Jade uses an easy syntax for defining links to CSS  stylesheets and for defining HTML   elements.  In addition, Jade allows you to extend the contents of a template and also  to use conditional logic. Listing 6.2 extends the contents with layout.jade  based on whether or not user.id  which is defined elsewhere  is defined. LISTING 6.2 index.jade extends layout  block content     h1= title     - if  user.id          p Hello {user.name}, and welcome to {title}         p           a href=' managebooks'  My Book List         p           a href=' logout'  Logout         bookhistory     - else         div             a href=' login'  Login with password         div             a href=' register'  Register As  you  can  see,  the  first  portion  of  Listing  6.2   starting  with  “if”   displays  a  welcome message and a link where the currently logged-in user can see a list of  books. The second portion of Listing 6.2  starting with “else”  displays a    element with a link for the login page, as well as a second   element for a  registration page.  A Minimal NodeJS Code Sample with Jade  This section shows you how to create a tiny NodeJS application that uses  Jade with the following three Jade files  which are placed in a views subdi- rectory  and one JavaScript file: views index.jade   122      jQuery Pocket Primer  views layout.jade views navigation.jade server.js  Here are the contents of index.jade:  h1   a href='http:  www.google.com '  Google Home Page  Here are the contents of layout.jade:  !!! 5   html lang='en'      head   title= title   body!= body     divnavigation!= partial 'navigation.jade'  Here are the contents of navigation.jade: divnavigation   a href=' '  home  Jade files in this section. LISTING 6.3 server.js var express = require 'express' ; var app = express.createServer  ;  app.configure function    {    app.set 'views', __dirname + ' views' ;    app.set 'view engine', 'jade' ; } ;  Listing 6.3 displays the contents of server.js that references the three   app.get ' ', function req, res  {     res.render 'index.jade',       { pageTitle: 'Jade Example', layout: false } ; } ;  app.listen 9000 ; Although we have not covered Node-related code, you can see that the code  creates  an  application,  sets  some  configuration  values,  and  then  renders  the  HTML  Web  page  that  is  defined  by  the Jade-based  templates  in  the view  subdirectory.  In  slightly  more  detail,  Listing  6.3  starts  by  creating  an express-based  application called app. Next, the code specifies the views subdirectory of the  current directory  indicated by the built-in variable __dirname , and also con- figures Jade as the “view engine.” The next portion of code specifies what to do  with a GET request, as shown here:   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      123  app.get ' ', function req, res  {     res.render 'index.jade',       { pageTitle: 'Jade Example', layout: false } ; } ; The preceding code renders a response by returning the contents of index. jade  in the views subdirectory , which is an HTML Web page with a link to  the Google homepage.  The final line of code listens on port 9000 of localhost.  NOTE  You must launch this Node application by performing a ‘cd’  into the simple_app directory that is on the CD.  There are many other templating solutions available, and some of the more   popular ones are listed here: Mustache.js Handlebars.js Dust.js  jQuery.tmpl plugin  Underscore Micro-templating PURE You can perform an Internet search to find links and tutorials with examples  that illustrate how to use the preceding templating engines.  ON THE CD  Other Templating Solutions  MongoDB  MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, and its homepage is here: http:  www.mongodb.org  A good place to start working with MongoDB is here: https:  mongolab.com home Download and install MongoDB from this Website: http:  www.mongodb.org downloads After you install MongoDB, you can start MongoDB with the following com-  mand: mongodb You  can  also  launch  an  interactive  session  by  typing mongo  in  another  com- mand shell, which enables you to manage schemas and perform CRUD-like  operations from the command line.  CRUD stands for create, read, update, and  delete, the four key database operations.   For example, the following sequence of commands shows you how to insert  a new user in the users schema  which is defined in the Mongoose section  later in this chapter .   124      jQuery Pocket Primer  mongo > > use db switched to db db > users = db.users db.users > users.find  ; > > users.insert {firstName:'a', lastName:'b'} ; > users.find   {         "_id" : ObjectId "509425f82685d84f9c41c858" ,         "firstName" : "a",         "lastName" : "b" } Consult the documentation for additional details about commands that you can  execute in the MongoDB command shell.  NodeJS  ON THE CD  NodeJS is a popular server technology that executes JavaScript. You can   download and install NodeJS from its homepage:  http:  nodejs.org  This section will describe only the basic information and the modules that  you need in order to work with a NodeJS server used in the sample application  on the CD.  After  you  have  installed NodeJS  on  your  machine,  install express  and   mongoose with these commands: npm install express npm install mongoose Just to show you that you can use NodeJS without a templating engine  such  as Jade ,  Listing  6.4  displays  the  contents  of HelloWorld.js  that  displays  the text string “Hello World” when users navigate to localhost:5000 in a  browser. LISTING 6.4 HelloWorld.js   create an app server var express = require "express" ; var app = express  ;    send 'Hello World' to the client  app.get ' ', function req, res  {     res.send 'Hello World' ; } ;   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      125  app.listen 5000 ; Launch the application from the command line as follows: node HelloWorld.js Launch a browser and navigate to the URL http:  localhost:5000. You will see  the text string “Hello World.”  Now that you have seen how to launch simple NodeJS applications  with  and without templates , you are ready to create a NodeJS application that uses  Mongoose and MongoDB, which is the topic of the next section of this chapter.  Mongoose  Mongoose is an ORM  written in NodeJS  for MongoDB that enables you to   define schemas in a MongoDB database, and its homepage is here:  http:  mongoosejs.com index.html Install Mongoose with the npm package manager, as shown here:  npm install mongoose The following sections show you how to connect to a MongoDB instance via Mon- goose, followed by an example of creating schemas, creating instances of the  schemas, and then modifying and saving those instances to a MongoDB database.  Connecting to MongoDB via Mongoose  You  can  connect  to  MongoDB  with  the  mongoose.connect    method.  The following command is the minimum needed to connect the myapp data- base running locally on the default port  27017 : mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  localhost myapp' ; You can specify additional parameters in the uri depending on your environment: mongoose.connect 'mongodb:  username:password@host:port                                                   database' ; Consult the documentation for additional options for connecting to a MongoDB  database.  Creating Schemas in Mongoose  The permitted SchemaTypes in Mongoose are: String, Number, Date,   Buffer, Boolean, Mixed, ObjectId, and Array.  First we need to define two variables that reference Mongoose and a Mon-  goDB database as follows: var mongoose = require 'mongoose' ,     db = mongoose.createConnection 'localhost', 'test' ; Now let’s create a simple Person schema in Mongoose: var personSchema = new mongoose.Schema {   126      jQuery Pocket Primer      id:        Schema.Types.ObjectId,     firstName: String,     lastName:  String }  We can add methods to our Person schema, as shown here: personSchema.methods.pname = function    {   var fullname = this.firstname+" "+this.lastname;   console.log fullname ; } Next we compile our Person schema into a Model as follows: var Person = db.model 'Person', personSchema ;  Note that a model is just a class that enables us to construct documents. In   this example, a document is a Person object.  Let’s create two Person objects as follows:  var p1 = new Person { firstName: 'John', lastname: 'Smith' }  var p2 = new Person { firstName: 'Jane', lastname: 'Jones' }   Finally, we can save our objects in MongoDB as follows:  p1.save function  error  {   if  error  {      console.log "error saving p1" ;   } } ;  p2.save function  error  {   if  error  {      console.log "error saving p2" ;   } } ;  You can specify other properties in a Mongoose schema, such as indexes,  setters, and getters. For example, the following code block shows you how to  expand the definition of the User schema with several additional properties: mongoose.model 'User', {   properties: ['first, 'last'],   cast:       {age: Number},   indexes:    ['first', 'last'],   setters:    {first: function  {} },   getters:    {full_name: function  {} },   methods:    {save: function   } };   Introduction to Single-Page Applications      127  An SPA Code Sample  The SPA code sample creates three Mongoose schemas to represent users,   books, and user comments about books.  The userSchema contains information about users and the list of books  that each user had read. There is a one-to-many relationship  each user can  read multiple books , as shown here: var userSchema = new mongoose.Schema {     userid:    Schema.Types.ObjectId,     firstName: String,     lastName:  String,     date:      {type: Date, default: Date.now},     books:     [{type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Book'}] }   The bookSchema contains information about books and the list of users  that have read each book. Similar to userSchema, there is a one-to-many rela- tionship  multiple users can read each book , as shown here: var bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema {     bookid:      Schema.Types.ObjectId,     bookAuthor:  String,     bookTitle:   String,     bookPubDate: {type: Date},     bookEdition: Number,     date:        {type: Date, default: Date.now},     users:       [{type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User'}] }  The  commentSchema  contains  information  about  the  comments  that  users  make about books that they have read. It references a user, a book, and a com- ment about a book, as shown here: var commentSchema = new mongoose.Schema {     commentid: Schema.Types.ObjectId,     userid:    {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User'},     bookid:    {type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Book'},     comment:   String,     date:      {type: Date, default: Date.now} }  Now we can compile our three schemas into Models as follows: var Book    = db.model 'Book', bookSchema ; var User    = db.model 'User', userSchema ; var Comment = db.model 'Comment', commentSchema ; Finally, we can create objects for the three schemas. The following code block  creates a new book, a new user, and a comment about the new book by the new  user:   128      jQuery Pocket Primer  var b1 = new Book {bookAuthor:  'Oswald Campesato',                      bookTitle:  'HTML5 Canvas and CSS3 Graphics',                    bookPubDate: '07 30 2012'                    } ;  var u1 = new User {firstName:  'John', lastname: 'Smith'} ; var c1 = new Comment {userid: u1, bookid: b1, comment:                                               "Great book!"} ;  Now we need to update b1 to add user u1 to the list of users who have read   the book: b1.users.push u1 ; Next, update u1 to add the book b1 to the list of books that user u1 has read: u1.books.push b1 ;  Save the modified b1, u1, and c1 with the following code snippet: b1.save  ; u1.save  ; c1.save  ; You also need code that enables users to find and update existing books and us- ers. The following method enables us to find and update a book by its id value: Book.findByIdAndUpdate b1.bookid,  {  $set:  {  books:  ap- pendB1}},    function  err, book  {     if  err  return handleError err ;     res.send book ; } ; The following method enables us to find and update a user: Book.findByIdAndUpdate b1.userid,  {  $set:  {  books:  appen- dU1}},    function  err, book  {     if  err  return handleError err ;     res.send book ; } ; Now you know how to do the following:   cid:81   cid:31 Connect to a MongoDB database in Mongoose   cid:81  Create MongoDB schemas using Mongoose   cid:81  Create and insert documents for a MongoDB database  The code in Listing 6.5 contains the code  the schema definitions are shown  above and are not displayed in the code sample  for connecting to a MongoDB  instance, creating schemas, populating some instances of the schemas, and then  saving the instances to the database.

There is also a code block that enables you to add new users by  extracting the relevant pieces of information from a URL and then constructing  the following structure that is saved to the database:   sample URL for adding a user:   http:  localhost:3003 adduser tom smith  app.get ' adduser :first :last :username',  res {   var user_data = {  function req,    Introduction to Single-Page Applications      131          first_name: req.params.first       , last_name: req.params.last       , username: req.params.username     };      var user = new User user_data ;      user.save  function error, data {         if error {             res.json error ;         }         else{             res.json data ;         }     } ; } ; Now open a command shell and launch MongoDB with the following command: mongod Open a second shell and launch the code in Listing 6.5 as follows: node app.js Finally, launch a browser session and navigate to localhost:3003 to view the  application.  Summary  In  this  chapter,  you  learned  about  the  rationale  for  creating  a  single- page  application   SPA .  You  also  learned  about  technologies  such  as  Jade,  MongoDB,  Mongoose,  and  NodeJS  that  you  can  use  for  supporting  the  different parts of an SPA.    C H A P T E R  7  INTRODUCTION TO JQUERY MOBILE  This chapter contains an introduction to jQuery Mobile, and shows you   how  to  create  HTML5-based  applications  using  jQuery  Mobile.  Web  pages for desktop browsers are rendered differently on mobile devic- es, which is immediately apparent whenever you see the tiny font size of the  rendered text on a mobile device. Fortunately, jQuery Mobile is highly “page  aware,” and it provides many useful before-and-after page-related events that  you can override with customizations that are tailored to your needs.  In fact, jQuery Mobile is designed around the notion of  mostly  single- page applications with multiple “page views”  discussed later in this chapter ,  whereas jQuery was designed when multi-page sites and applications were pre- dominant. Thus, jQuery Mobile has a view-oriented model, whereas jQuery has  a Web page-oriented model. This important distinction will help you under- stand the rationale for the features that are available in jQuery Mobile.   In this chapter, you will become well acquainted with the data- prefix in  custom attributes, which are part of the HTML5 specification  Section 3.2.3.8 .  jQuery Mobile makes extensive use of custom attributes with a data- prefix,  whereas custom attributes are not used in jQuery. In fact, jQuery Mobile uses  this custom attribute for specifying behavior, functionality, and layout. As you  will  see,  two  frequently  used  custom  attributes  are  data-role  and  data- transition.  If you want to write Web pages that display correctly on different devices,  then at a minimum you need to take into account the dimensions  width and  height  of those devices. Other considerations include, but are not limited to: DPI   Dots Per Inch , which varies between mobile devices, and whether or not you  want to allow users to pinch or zoom into the Web page. One of the strengths of  jQuery Mobile is that device differences are handled automatically for you, in ad- dition to its rich feature set and its support for many mobile platforms.    134      jQuery Pocket Primer  The  first  part  of  this  chapter  provides  an  overview  of  some  features  of  jQuery Mobile, as well as some important differences from jQuery. You will  see how jQuery Mobile programmatically enhances your Web pages with extra  functionality.  This  reduces  the  coding  effort  on  your  part  in  order  to  create  mobile-enabled Web pages, and also ensures that your Web pages will render  correctly on different mobile devices. In addition, you will learn about page- related events that jQuery Mobile exposes  there are many such events , and  some of the default behavior that you can override programmatically.  The second part of this chapter discusses multi-page views in jQuery Mobile,  and various ways for positioning headers and footers. The third part of this chapter  discusses buttons in jQuery Mobile, which is an extensive topic with lots of rich  functionality, and you will see complete code samples and useful code snippets.   The fourth part of this chapter contains code samples that illustrate how to  work with various widgets  including list views, navigation bars, and menus  in  jQuery Mobile. The intent of these code samples is to show you not just how to  use these widgets, but also how to incorporate CSS3-based graphics effects in  the code samples. Some of these effects, such as shadow and gradients  which  you learned how to do in Chapter 3 , show you how to create a richer visual ef- fect that goes beyond the “out of the box” functionality of jQuery Mobile. The  final portion of this chapter contains code samples that show you how to use  AJAX and Geolocation in HTML Web pages with jQuery Mobile.   Using jQuery 2.0 in This Chapter  The following code samples work correctly in jQuery2.0.0, but they report  “spurious” warnings that you can see when you launch them in a WebKit-based  browser and then open the Web Inspector:   cid:81  JQMAjax1.html   cid:81  JQMButtons1.html   cid:81  JQMFixed1.html   cid:81  JQMForm1.html   cid:81  JQMHelloWorld1.html   cid:81  JQMMenu1.html   cid:81  JQMNavigationBar1.html   cid:81  JQMNestedListViews1.html   cid:81  JQMPageEvents1.html   cid:81  JQMSimpleListView1.html   cid:81  JQMMultiPageViews1.html   cid:81  JQMGeolocation1.html   Overview of jQuery Mobile  Introduction to jQuery Mobile      135  jQuery Mobile is essentially a collection of jQuery plugins and widgets that  enable you to write mobile Web applications that run on multiple platforms.  You already know that jQuery focuses on desktop Web applications; by contrast,  jQuery  Mobile   which  includes  a  CSS  stylesheet  and  a  JavaScript  library   is  intended for mobile devices. However, jQuery Mobile does rely on the "base"  jQuery library that you must reference prior to referencing the jQuery Mobile  library in a Web page. In addition, jQuery Mobile uses features of HTML5 and  CSS3  such as transitions and animation , and small icons for navigation.  jQuery Mobile relies on custom attributes with a data- prefix. In case you  do not know, custom attributes are new in HTML5, and they always have such  a prefix. This support for custom data attributes provides HTML5 markup with  some of the functionality that is available in XML. This enables code to process  custom tags and their values and also pass validation at the same time.  A simple jQuery Mobile page has the following structure:    cid:81  An optional   element with a data-role="header" attribute   cid:81  A mandatory   element with a data-role="content" attribute   cid:81   cid:31 An optional   element with a data-role="footer" attribute  During initialization, jQuery Mobile pre-processes a Web page and inserts  additional markup, CSS classes, and event handlers. You will see an example  of how jQuery Mobile modifies a Web page in the "Hello World" code sample  later in this chapter.  There  are  several  important  details  that  you  need  to  be  aware  of  when  writing jQuery Mobile Web pages. First, jQuery Mobile provides the following  page-related events that you can invoke programmatically during the lifecycle  of a jQuery Mobile page: pageInit  , pageCreate  , pageShow  , and  pageHide  . Second, jQuery Mobile supports custom events for handling user  gestures such as swipe, tap, tap-and-hold, and orientation changes  of a device. Third, jQuery Mobile uses themes to customize the look and feel  of mobile applications, along with progressive enhancement  discussed briefly  in Chapter 1  to enable your mobile application to run on a diverse set of Web- enabled devices.  Another key point to keep in mind is that jQuery uses this construct:  $ document .ready   {      do something here } On the other hand, jQuery Mobile uses this construct: $ selector .live 'pageinit',  function event {      do something here }  ;   136      jQuery Pocket Primer  Notice the different focus: jQuery sends an event when a Web page has been  loaded, whereas jQuery Mobile sends an event when a page  or page view  has  been initialized.  Key Features and Components in jQuery Mobile  If you have read the previous chapters that cover jQuery, you have already  acquired substantial knowledge of jQuery features. This knowledge is useful for  another reason: jQuery Mobile uses jQuery as its foundation, and the jQuery  library must always precede the jQuery Mobile library in your HTML5 Web  pages.   jQuery Mobile provides many useful features that will simplify the process  of creating mobile applications. Some of the jQuery Mobile features are listed  here:   cid:81  Compatible with major mobile platforms  Android, iOS, and others    cid:81  Uses HTML5 markup   cid:81  Adopts progressive enhancement approach   cid:81  Provides a compact toolkit  about 12K compressed    cid:81  Supports plugins and themes   cid:81  Supports touch and mouse-based user gestures   cid:81  Supports WAI-ARIA  In addition, jQuery Mobile supports the following components  and others that  are not listed here :   cid:81  Buttons   cid:81  Form elements   cid:81  List views   cid:81  Pages and dialogs   cid:81  Toolbars  The  jQuery  code  samples  in  this  book  use  a  simple  naming  convention:  the  names of HTML5 Web pages that contain jQuery code start with “JQ,” and the  names of HTML5 Web pages that contain jQuery Mobile start with the letters  “JQM.” Keep in mind that this naming convention is only for this book.  A Minimal jQuery Mobile Web Page  Listing 7.1 displays the contents of JQMHelloWorld1.html that illustrates  how to display the message “Hello World” in an HTML5 Web page when ren- dered on a desktop browser, tablet, or smart phone.

FIGURE 7.2  Hello World on a Sprint Nexus S 4G with Android ICS  landscape mode .  Now launch Listing 7.1 in a Webkit-based browser, and compare what you   see in Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2.  Earlier you learned that jQuery Mobile enhances a mobile Web page with  additional  tags  and  CSS  classes.  jQuery  Mobile  “injects”  various  CSS  classes   that are part of jQuery Mobile  into the HTML5 Web page in Listing 7.1. In  general, you will not need to be concerned with these details; however, you can  delve into the jQuery Mobile source code if you need a deeper understanding  of these details. The HTML5 page JQMHelloWorld1Enhanced.html on the  CD shows you how jQuery "enhances" the contents of the HTML5 Web page  HelloWorld1.html.  ON THE CD  More Differences between jQuery and jQuery Mobile  jQuery is a toolkit for creating HTML Web pages on a desktop browser,  whereas jQuery Mobile provides support for additional functionality that is rel- evant for mobile devices:   cid:81  Support for multiple page views   cid:81  Custom attributes with a data- prefix for page views and transitions   Introduction to jQuery Mobile      139    cid:81  Page transitions  pagebeforehide, pagebeforeshow, and so forth    cid:81  The jqmData   custom selector   cid:81  The mobileInit event  jQuery Mobile Page Views  jQuery Mobile Custom Attributes  As you saw in a previous code sample, each page view in a jQuery Mobile  application is defined by an HTML   element with a data-role="page"  attribute, along with an optional header element, a mandatory content element,  and an optional footer element.   Navigation between page views is straightforward: simply add a link to the    element with the data-role="content" attribute in the jQuery Mo- bile application, as shown here:        A second page view Home         The transition between page views occurs when users tap on a link, and jQuery  Mobile automatically handles the necessary details of the transition. A complete  example of a jQuery Mobile Web page with multiple page views  and how to  navigate between the page views  is provided later in this chapter.  jQuery Mobile uses the data-role attribute to identify different parts of a  "page view"  which is essentially one screen , and some of its supported values  are page, header, content, and footer. The data-role attribute is also  used  to  enhance  HTML  elements.  For  example,  if  you  specify  the  attribute  data-role="listview" as part of the HTML   tag of an unordered list,  then jQuery Mobile will make the necessary enhancements  such as inserting  markup, adding CSS classes, and exposing listeners  so that you can treat the  unordered list as though it were a widget.   As another example, you can create a navigation bar by adding the attribute  data-role="navbar"  to  the  block-level  HTML5     element,  and  the  text  strings in the associated list items  which are enclosed in the HTML5    element  are displayed as tab elements in the navigation bar.   The data-transition attribute specifies transition effects when chang- ing  page  views  or  when  displaying  dialogs.  Since  these  transitions  are  based  on CSS3, these transitions work only in browsers that support CSS3  such as  WebKit-based browsers . The allowable values for the data-transition at- tribute are fade, ﬂ ip, pop, slide, slidedown, and slideup.  Some of the other custom jQuery Mobile attributes are data-backbtn,  data-divider, data-direction, data-icon, data-inline, data- position, data-rel, and data-url.   140      jQuery Pocket Primer  jQuery Mobile Page Transitions  jQuery Mobile provides page transitions  as well as the event and ui ob- jects  that you can reference in custom code blocks that you bind to any page  transition. Keep in mind that a "page" can be a separate HTML Web page as  well as an HTML   element inside the currently loaded HTML Web page. Here is the sequence of page events that occurs during a page initialization:  pagebeforecreate: fires first pagecreate: fires when DOM is populated pageinit: after initialization is completed pagebeforeshow: fires on 'to' page before transition pageshow: fires on 'to' page after transition  Whenever users tap a link that navigates to a page that is loaded for the first   time, the following sequence of events occurs: pagebeforehide: fires on the 'from' page before transition pagebeforeshow: fires on the 'to' page before transition pagehide: fires on the 'from' page after transition pageshow: fires on the 'to' page after transition Whenever a new page is loaded using AJAX, the following sequence of events  occurs: pagebeforeload: before the AJAX call is made pageload: after the AJAX call is completed pageloadfailed: fired if an AJAX call has failed  During  page  transitions,  ui.nextPage  is  assigned  the  target  page  of  the  transition,  or  an  empty  jQuery  object  if  there  is  no  next  page.  Similarly,  ui.prevPage is assigned the current page prior to the transition, or an empty  jQuery object if there is no previous page.  jQuery Mobile uses AJAX-based asynchronous method invocations for its  internal functionality, so it distinguishes page load events from page show and  hide events. Page load events occur when a file is loaded into the browser in a  synchronous manner, and the jQuery document .ready   method is avail- able,  along  with  other  initialization  events.  Note  that  in  some  cases  you  can  explicitly specify synchronous instead of asynchronous method invocation, but  this feature is not discussed in this chapter  check the online jQuery Mobile  documentation if you want more details .  As you will see later in this chapter, a single HTML Web page may contain  multiple jQuery Mobile page views, and users can navigate among those page  views  multiple  times.  These  transitions  do  not  fire  page  load  events;  jQuery  Mobile provides a set of events that happen every time a page transition occurs. Since the page hide and show events are triggered every time a page tran- sition happens, make sure that you do not bind the event handlers more than  once by first checking if the event handler is not already bound  otherwise do  nothing , or by clearing the binding prior to rebinding to a given event.   Listing 7.2 displays the contents of JQMPageEvents1.html that illustrates   Introduction to jQuery Mobile      141  the sequence in which page events are executed.

The main block of code uses the jQuery  live   method to bind various page-related events, which displays a message  in the console whenever the page event occurs.  Figure 7.3 displays the result of rendering the HTML Web page in Listing  7.2 in the Chrome browser on a MacBook. The Chrome Inspector at the bot- tom of Figure 7.3 shows you the sequence of paged-related events that are fired  in jQuery Mobile.  FIGURE 7.3  jQuery Mobile page events on the Chrome browser on a MacBook.   Introduction to jQuery Mobile      143  jQuery Mobile and CSS-Related Page Initialization  In addition to exposing page-related events, jQuery Mobile performs ad- ditional processing on an HTML Web page before the Web page is rendered in  a browser. First, jQuery Mobile triggers the beforecreate event, then adds  the ui-page  class to all page elements, and finally adds the ui-nojs  class  to all page elements that have data-role="none"  or data-role="nojs"  applied to them.  Next, jQuery Mobile searches for child elements with a data- attribute  and adds theming classes, an appropriate ARIA role, and  if necessary  also adds  a back button to the header for any pages beyond the first page.  Finally, jQuery Mobile enhances buttons, control groups, and form con-  trols, and makes any necessary adjustments to toolbars.  Thus, jQuery Mobile performs a significant amount of work on your be- half, which means that you are unencumbered with these tedious and low-level  details so that you can concentrate on the functionality of your mobile applica- tions.  There is even more good news: jQuery Mobile automatically handles page  transitions and back buttons as users navigate through the various pages of your  mobile application. jQuery Mobile also handles external pages by performing  an asynchronous fetch  using AJAX  and then integrating that external page into  the current document  and an error message is displayed if the external page  was not found . The external page is incorporated into the first element with a  data-role="page"  attribute  into  the  current  document   while  ignoring  all  other content of that page .  Note  that  jQuery  Mobile  displays  an  error  message  if  it  cannot  find  the  Web  page  or  if  the  Web  page  does  not  contain  an  element  with  a  data- role="page" attribute. Make sure that the id values in the external Web  page are distinct from the id values of the current Web page.  By  the  way,  you  can  override  the  default  page  loading  in  two  ways:  specifying a target attribute on a link  such as _blank ,  or by specifying a  rel="external" attribute on the link.  jQuery  Mobile  triggers  the mobileinit  event  on  the  document  object  immediately  upon  execution,  so  you  can  bind  to  it  and  override  any  default  configuration.  For instance, suppose you need to prevent jQuery Mobile from applying  styling rules to specific types of HTML elements throughout a mobile applica- tion. The following code block prevents jQuery Mobile from applying its styling  rules  on a global level  to HTML   and   elements: $ document .bind 'mobileinit',function    {    $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNative = "input,                                                   textarea"; } ;  The mobileinit Event   144      jQuery Pocket Primer  Note that the data-role="none" attribute serves the same purpose as  the previous code block, except that it is applied only to the specific element  that includes this attribute.  jQuery Mobile Options and Customization  jQuery Mobile provides options and methods for various objects, including  .mobile, .mobile.path,  and .mobile.history.  There  are  many  options  that you can configure for your mobile application, and we’ll cover just a few of  them in this section. One method that is obviously useful is the jQuery Mobile  pageLoading   method that shows and hides the jQuery Mobile loading dia- log. You call this method with a Boolean value of true to hide the dialog, and  call this method without a parameter to show the dialog, as shown here:    Show the page loading dialog  $.mobile.pageLoading  ;      Hide the loading dialog  $.mobile.pageLoading true ; You can also customize the “loading message” and also the type of transition  effect, as and shown here:  $.mobile.loadingMessage = "wait a few moments "; $.mobile.defaultPageTransition = "pop";  Another way of doing the same thing as the previous two lines is shown here: $.extent $.mobile, {     "loadingMessage" = "wait a few moments",     "defaultPageTransition" = "pop"  } ; In fact, you can configure jQuery Mobile with your own initialization as follows:  1   create  a  script  that  loads  before  jQuery  Mobile  is  loaded,  and  2   bind  an  event handler to the mobileinit event.  If  you  want  more  information  about  jQuery  Mobile  custom  initialization, options, and methods, read the jQuery documentation  for an in-depth explanation of how you can use them.  Page Navigation and Changing Pages  As users navigate around your mobile Web application, jQuery Mobile also  updates the location.hash object, with the unique URL of each page view   which  is  defined  by  an  element  with  a  data-role="page"  attribute .  jQuery Mobile automatically stores the URL for each page is stored in the data- url attribute, which jQuery Mobile assigns to the "container" element of a page.    Introduction to jQuery Mobile      145  jQuery Mobile also provides a set of methods that enable you to program- matically handle page changes and scrolling. One of these methods is change- Page  , whose syntax looks like this: changePage to, transition, back, changeHash ; The to parameter is a string that specifies an element id or a filename  along  with many other options , and it is a reference to the target page. The tran- sition parameter is the name of the transition effect that is created when the  application  goes  to  the  target  page.  The back  parameter  is  a  Boolean  value  that specifies whether or not a transition is in reverse. Finally, the changeHash  parameter is a Boolean that specifies whether or not to update the location. hash object.  The changePage   method enables you to create more sophisticated page  transition effects. For example, the following code snippet goes to page ﬁ rst  when users click on the .back-btn, with a “flip” effect in reverse without up- dating the location hash: $ ".back-btn" .bind "click", function   {   changePage "first", "flip", true, false ; } ; jQuery Mobile also provides the silentScroll   method with a single inte- ger value that specifies the y-position of the destination. When this method is  invoked, the scroll event listeners are not triggered. As an example, the follow- ing code snippet scrolls down to position 200: $.mobile.silentScroll 200 ;  The jqmData   Custom Selector  In Chapter 1, you learned about the jQuery data   method. jQuery Mo- bile  provides  a  corresponding  method  called jqmData  ,  which  is  a  custom  selector specifically for selecting custom data- attributes.   For example, in jQuery you can select all the elements in a Web page that   contain a data-role attribute whose value is page using this code snippet: $ "[data-role='page']"  You can select the same set of elements using jqmData   as shown here: $ ":jqmData role='page' "  Select all elements with any custom data- attribute within those selected pag- es:  $ ":jqmData role='page' " .jqmData role  Note that the jqmData   selector automatically handles namespacing for you  by specifying a value for the string namespace-  which is empty by default ,  thereby avoiding tagname collisions.   146      jQuery Pocket Primer  Multiple Page Views in One HTML5 Web Page  jQuery Mobile enables you to conveniently define multiple page views in a  single HTML5 Web page, along with a simple mechanism for users to navigate  among the different page views in the HTML5 Web page. The use of a single  HTML5 Web page is recommended because this approach is more efficient  than creating a mobile application with multiple HTML5 Web pages. Although  the initial download for the HTML5 Web page might be longer, there are no  additional Internet accesses required when users navigate to different parts of  the Web page.   Listing 7.3 displays the contents of JQMMultiPageViews1.html that il- lustrates  how  to  navigate  between  multiple  internal  page  views  in  a  single  HTML5 Web page.

When users navigate to the second page view, this code snippet  returns to the first page view:   Click Here or the 'Back' Button to go Home<  a>  The  page  views  or  screens  in  a  jQuery  Mobile  application  are  top-level  sibling elements, each of which contains the attribute data-role="page"  so  pages cannot be nested .   The jQuery Mobile framework automatically generates a back button and  a home button on every page view, but you can suppress the back button by  specifying the attribute data-backbtn="false" attribute, as shown here:       Page Header     Figure 7.4 displays the result of rendering the HTML Web page in List- ing 7.3 in a landscape-mode screenshot taken from a Sprint Nexus S 4G with  Android ICS.  FIGURE 7.4  Multi-page app on a Sprint Nexus S 4G with Android ICS.  When you click on the link on the Web page, the application navigates to   the second screen, whose code definition is also included in Listing 7.3.    148      jQuery Pocket Primer  Positioning the Header and Footer in Page Views  jQuery Mobile can dynamically position the header and footer toolbars in   three ways:  Standard:  The  toolbars  are  presented  according  to  the  document  flow,  scrolling into and out of the viewport as the user scrolls through data. This is  the default.  Fixed: The header and footer will appear at the top and bottom of the view- port and remain there as the user scrolls. Tapping on the screen will cause them  to return to their regular position in the document flow.  Fullscreen: The header and footer will appear within the viewport and stay  present as the user scrolls, regardless of where the user is in the content. Tap- ping on the screen will hide them. Essentially, the header and footer are re- moved from the document flow and are always dynamically positioned at the  top and bottom of the viewport.  Include  the  data-position="ﬁ xed"  attribute  in  the     or    tags to create a fixed header and footer, as illustrated in Listing 7.4  that displays the contents of JQMFixed1.html. LISTING 7.4 JQMFixed1.html                  Fixed Header and Footer in jQueryMobile     <link rel="stylesheet"     href="http:  code.jquery.com mobile 1.1.0 jquery.                                       mobile-1.1.0.min.css"  >                     <script src="http:  code.jquery.com mobile 1.1.0                                    jquery.mobile-1.1.0.min.js">                                    jQuery Mobile                          Content area.

You  can  also  create  a  fullscreen  header  or  a  fullscreen  footer  by  including  the  attribute  data-fullscreen="true"  in  the  element  that  contains  the  data-role="page"  attribute,  along  with  the  attribute  data- position="ﬁ xed" to the header and footer elements, as shown here:              jQuery Mobile                 Content area                Mercury Learning             About this app   Figure  7.5  displays  the  result  of  rendering  the  HTML5  Web  page  in  Listing 7.5, in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  FIGURE 7.5  Fixed headers footers in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  Launch the HTML5 Web page in Listing 7.5 in the Chrome browser. As you  resize your browser horizontally or vertically, notice how the header and footer  “bar” remain anchored to the top and the bottom of the screen, respectively.  Now that you understand the structure of an HTML5 Web page in jQuery   Mobile, let’s see how to add jQuery Mobile buttons to an HTML5 Web page.   150      jQuery Pocket Primer  Working with Buttons in jQuery Mobile  jQuery Mobile provides a set of button markup options that enable you to  style links as buttons, and also built-in support for automatically handling vari- ous types of HTML   elements as though they were buttons. In addi- tion, jQuery Mobile supports inline buttons, grouped buttons  both vertical and  horizontal , and an assortment of theming effects for buttons.  jQuery Mobile creates stylized buttons by applying data-role="button"  to HTML   buttons,   tags, and anchor links. Buttons are as  wide as their containing element; however, if you specify the attribute data- inline="true", then buttons are rendered only as wide as their content.  In some of the earlier versions of jQuery Mobile  prior to 1.7 , you could  prevent  jQuery  Mobile  from  applying  its  styling  to  a  button  by  placing  your  custom markup inside an HTML   element located inside the HTML5    element. However, this functionality is no longer available in version  1.7 and beyond; keep this in mind in case you encounter this functionality in  Web pages that use older versions of jQuery Mobile.  You can also create a reverse transition without going back in history by us- ing the attribute data-direction="reverse" instead of data-rel="back",  as shown here:       Reverse Tran- sition     Left and Right Buttons          Add     Buttons can be moved to the left or right, as shown here:     Right    Page title    Left     Navigation Buttons as Anchor Links  In jQuery Mobile, the recommended practice is to define navigation but- tons as anchor links and to define form submission buttons as button elements.  An anchor link that contains the attribute data-role="button" is styled   as a button, as shown here:   Link-based button  A jQuery Mobile button element or input element whose type is submit, reset,  button, or image does not require the attribute data-role="button" because  jQuery Mobile automatically treats these elements as a link-based button.   Introduction to jQuery Mobile      151  Although the original form-based button is not displayed, it is included in  the HTML markup. When a click event occurs on a link button, a correspond- ing click event occurs on the original form button.  Groups of Buttons and Column Grids  jQuery Mobile enables you to render a set of buttons  or checkboxes or  radio buttons  as a block by defining a container HTML   element that  specifies the attribute data-role="controlgroup", and then include one or  more button elements. The default rendering of the included buttons is hori- zontal  a row , and you can render the buttons as a vertical group by specifying  the attribute data-type="vertical".  jQuery Mobile renders the buttons, removes margins  and drop shadows   between buttons, and also “rounds” the first and last buttons in order to create  a group-like effect. The following code block shows you how to specify a hori- zontal group of buttons:       One      Two      Three      One point to keep in mind: the buttons will “wrap” to additional rows if the  number of buttons exceeds the screen width. Listing 7.5 shows you how to ren- der a horizontal group and a vertical group of buttons.  The jQuery Mobile framework enables you to render CSS-based columns  through a block style class convention called ui-grid. You can render two- column, three-column, four-column, and five-column layouts by using the class  value ui-grid-a,  ui-grid-b,  ui-grid-c, and  ui-grid-d, respectively.  The following code block illustrates how to render a two-column layout:       Block 1 and text inside will wrap     Block 2 and text inside will wrap    Notice the difference in the following code block that displays a three-column lay- out:      Block 1 and text inside will wrap     Block 2 and text inside will wrap     Block 3 and text inside will wrap     You can find more details and code samples here:  http:  jquerymobile.com demos 1.0b1  demos 1.0 docs content content-grids.html   152      jQuery Pocket Primer  Rendering Buttons with Themes  jQuery Mobile has an extensive theming system, involving themes labeled  “a” through “e,” for controlling the manner in which buttons are styled. When a  link is added to a container, jQuery Mobile will assign it a theme “swatch” letter  that matches the theme of its parent. For example, a button placed inside a con- tent container with a theme of “a”  black in the default theme  is automatically  assigned the button theme of “a”  charcoal in the default theme .   An example of a button theme is shown here:      <a href="left.html" data-icon="arrow-l"      data-role="button" data-theme="a">Left    Listing 7.5 displays the contents of JQMButtons1.html, which illustrates how  to render buttons horizontally and vertically, how to apply different themes, and  how to specify custom CSS selectors.

Notice that the vertical group of buttons is rendered with a reddish-tinged  background shadow, which creates a richer visual effect. This is accomplished  simply by specifying a value of shadow for the class attribute, as shown in bold  in this code block: <a href="index6.html" class="shadow"                        data-role="button">Vertical1  <a href="index7.html" class="shadow"                        data-role="button">Vertical2  <a href="index8.html" class="shadow"                        data-role="button">Vertical3  In addition, the “cancel” and “submit” buttons specify class="shadow", and  they are rendered with a psychedelic effect, which you obviously don’t want to  render in most cases. Nevertheless, you see how easily you can style buttons  with custom CSS3-based visual effects, and the definition of the shadow selec- tor is shown in Listing 7.6.  The bottom row of four HTML   elements in Listing 7.5 renders four  directional arrows because they have a data-icon attribute that is set to ar- row-l,  arrow-u,  arrow-d, and  arrow-r, respectively. In addition, these  four  HTML     elements  specify  different  values  for  the  attribute  data- theme, and they are rendered according to the visual display for each of these  pre-defined jQuery Mobile themes.  Note that the HTML   elements in Listing 7.6 reference HTML Web  pages that are not defined for this mobile application. Thus, when users click on  these links, they will see an error message.

As you can see, there are many styling-related options available in jQuery  mobile, so a summary of the discussion about jQuery Mobile buttons might be  helpful:   cid:81   cid:31 An anchor link with the attribute data-role="button" is rendered as   a button.    cid:81   cid:31 Any input element with the type button, submit, reset, or image is as- signed a class of ui-btn-hidden and a link-based button is displayed.    cid:81  Add a data-icon attribute to create a button with an icon.   cid:81  Add a data-iconpos attribute to change the position of the icon.   156      jQuery Pocket Primer    cid:81  Specify data-inline="true" to render a button only as wide as its   text.    cid:81  data-role="controlgroup"  data-type="horizontal"  groups   buttons vertically  horizontally  in a   element.     cid:81  data-theme="e"  attribute  is  the  fifth  of  five  jQuery  themes   “a”   through “e” .  List Views in jQuery Mobile  jQuery Mobile supports list views  which are very common in mobile ap- plications  and several variations, including list view buttons, nested list views,  and list view split buttons. jQuery Mobile can enhance ordered lists and un- ordered lists by applying the attribute data-role="listview" to a list. List  view elements that are embedded inside anchor tags respond to user gestures,  as shown in Listing 7.7, which displays the contents of the jQuery Mobile Web  page JQMSimpleListView1.html. LISTING 7.7 JQMSimpleListView1.html                   Simple List Views in jQuery Mobile      <link rel="stylesheet"     href="http:  code.jquery.com mobile 1.1.0                                 jquery.mobile-1.1.0.min.css"  >                    <script src="http:  code.jquery.com mobile 1.1.0                                    jquery.mobile-1.1.0.min.js">                                This is the Header                    Simple Unordered List Example                         Unordered Item 1                Unordered Item 2      Introduction to jQuery Mobile      157              Unordered Item 3                       Simple Ordered List Example                        Ordered Item 1                Ordered Item 2                Ordered Item 3                              This is the Footer                   Whenever users tap on any list item in Listing 7.7, you can detect that event and  execute custom code  if any  that you have bound to that event. In this example,  the href attribute has value , so the page is reloaded when users tap or click  on the list items.  Figure 7.7 displays the result of rendering the HTML Web page in Listing   7.7 in landscape mode on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  FIGURE 7.7  List view on an Asus Prime Tablet with Android ICS.  Additional Code Samples on the CD  jQuery Mobile can create interactive views with nested lists, and users can  “drill down” by tapping on list items. The first view displays the items in the  top-level list, and tapping on one of those items will display the sublist for that  item  and so forth . In addition, jQuery Mobile automatically provides a back  button and also takes care of the URL mapping and transitions between pages.  The  HTML5  Web  page JQMNestedListViews1.html  on  the  CD  is  a  jQuery Mobile Web page that illustrates how to render nested lists and how to  navigate between pages when users click on list items.  Navigation bars in mobile applications often consist of a set of buttons that  enable users to navigate through the page views. jQuery Mobile allows you to  include navigation bars in the header, footer, or content areas of a page view   and also provide the appropriate formatting for the navigation bars .  ON THE CD  ON THE CD   158      jQuery Pocket Primer  To designate a navigation bar, apply the data-role="navigation" to a  block level element like the HTML 5   element. Anchor tags contained  within  a  designated  navigation  element  will  be  formatted  as  a  button  group.  jQuery Mobile will automatically handle changing the active and inactive states  of the buttons, as shown in the HTML5 Web page JQMNavigationBar1.html  on the CD.  jQuery Mobile enables you to show and hide a list of menu options, and you  can also use transitions to create animation effects as the menu list is displayed  or hidden from view. The HTML5 Web page JQMMenu1.html on the CD il- lustrates how to create a sliding menu in an HTML5 Web page.  ON THE CD  ON THE CD  jQuery Mobile and AJAX  jQuery Mobile uses AJAX for form submission, and will attempt to inte- grate the server response into the DOM of the application, providing transitions  as expected. If you wish to prevent jQuery Mobile from using AJAX to handle a  form, apply the attribute data-ajax="false" to the form tag.  Listing 7.8 displays the contents of JQMAjax1.html that illustrates how to   handle AJAX invocations in a jQuery Mobile application.

Fortunately, jQuery Mobile emits events for user ges- tures, such as orientationchange, scrollstart, scrollstop, swipe,  swipeleft, swiperight, tap, and taphold. The first part of this chap- ter  shows  you  how  to  handle  some  of  these  user  gestures.  You  will  also  see  code samples that show you how to create slide-related and fade-related anima- tion effects in jQuery. The final portion of this section briefly discusses jQuery  Mobile virtual mouse events, which can simplify your code when you want to  handle mouse-related events as well as touch-related events in an HTML Web  page.  The  second  part  of  this  chapter  shows  you  how  to  create  CSS3  2D 3D  animation effects with jQuery Mobile. One code sample uses jQuery Mobile to  create a 3D cube effect. Also, there are samples on the CD that render “bounc- ing balls,” and show how to access accelerometer values for a mobile device and  then display the real-time values in a jQuery Mobile Web page.  Recall that in Chapter 2 you learned how to create CSS3 2D and 3D ef- fects, and in Chapter 3 you learned how to combine those effects with jQuery  in HTML5 Web pages. In this chapter, you will see how to create some of the  corresponding effects using jQuery Mobile.  Handling User Gestures and Events in jQuery Mobile  jQuery  Mobile  emits  an  assortment  of  events  for  user  gestures,  such  as  orientationchange, scrollstart, scrollstop, swipe, swipeleft,  swiperight, tap, and taphold.  If you need to handle many user gestures, consider the option of using a  jQuery plugin instead of writing your own code. There are various plugins avail- able, and the next section briefly discusses two of those plugins.  ON THE CD   166      jQuery Pocket Primer  When you want to detect user gestures on a HTML Web page, you can  write custom jQuery code using the jQuery .on "click"  method to handle  those  gestures.  Please  review  the  section  in  Chapter  1  regarding  the  jQuery  event-related methods that are deprecated in jQuery 1.7 and beyond, as well as  the recommended jQuery method for handling events.  As you probably know, a tap event occurs whenever users tap on an ele- ment, whereas a taphold event occurs when users touch an element and main- tain contact for one second. You can bind to a tap event and a taphold event  in jQuery Mobile with the following code snippets: $ "body" .bind "tap", function    {   console.log "Tap Event on the body Element" ;   return false;  } ;  $ "body" .bind "taphold", function    {   console.log "Tap Hold Event on the body Element" ;   return false;  } ; The return false statement inside a jQuery event handler is effectively the  same  as  invoking  e.preventDefault     which  prevents  the  default  event  from  occurring   and  also  e.stopPropagation     which  does  prevent  the  event from "bubbling up"  on the jQuery Event object that is passed as a pa- rameter to the JavaScript function  which is not supplied in this example . Keep  in mind that the return false statement in non-jQuery event handlers does  not prevent "bubbling up" behavior on the event that occurred.  A swipe event occurs when there is a horizontal drag at the rate of 30px  or  greater  during a one-second interval. The swipeleft and swiperight events  occur when the swipe event is toward the left or toward the right, respectively. Listing 8.1 displays the contents of JQMSwipeEvents1.html, illustrating  how to handle tap events as well as swipe left and swipe right events in jQuery  Mobile.

Under those three images  are three text strings that act as “labels” for user gestures that are associated  with the left, middle, and right image, respectively. Listing 8.1 also contains  console.log   messages that are displayed in Chrome Inspector whenever  users tap or swipe one of the rendered images. Incidentally, the code in Listing  8.1 was deployed as an Android application from inside Eclipse; after switching  to the DDMS  Dalvik Debug Monitor Server  perspective, you might see the  following type of message in the Eclipse console if you swipe your finger too  quickly: "Miss  a  drag  as  we  are  waiting  for  Webcore's  response  for  touch down."

Two jQuery Plugins for Detecting User Gestures  The jGestures jQuery plugin handles a vast set of user gestures, including  pinch, rotate, swipe-related and tap-related user gestures. This jQuery plugin is  available for download here:  https:  jgestures.codeplex.com   The syntax for handling user gestures uses the jQuery bind method. For ex- ample, you can bind a swipe gesture with the jGestures plugin with the fol- lowing code snippet: jQuery 'swipe' .bind 'swipeone',eventHandler ; Another jQuery Mobile plugin that handles various user gestures is here:  https:  github.com eightmedia hammer.js  This JavaScript toolkit has a good collection of samples that illustrate how to  handle user gestures. Since there are many jQuery Mobile plugins available for  handling user gestures, it’s a good idea to perform an Internet search to find  many of those plugins, after which you can assess them to determine which ones  best fit your needs.    ON THE CD  User Gestures and Animation Effects in jQuery Mobile      169  Scroll Events in jQuery Mobile  jQuery  Mobile  supports  the  following  custom  events:  orientationchange   triggered by changing the orientation of a device, either vertically or horizon- tally , scrollstart  triggered when a scroll begins , and scrollstop  trig- gered when a scroll ends . You can bind to these events like you would with  other jQuery events, using live  or bind  , whose usage prior to version 1.7  of jQuery is discussed in Chapter 6. In addition, when your jQuery Mobile code  binds to the orientationchange event, the callback function can specify a  second argument that contains an orientation property equal to either por- trait or landscape.   The HTML5 Web page JQMScrollEvents1.html on the CD illustrates   how to handle scrolling events in JQuery Mobile, and its logic looks like this:     $ "page1" .live 'pageinit',  function event,ui {      var eventsElement = $ 'events' ;      $ window .bind 'scrollstart', function    {        console.log 'Scroll start' ;        $ '.ui-body-c' .css 'background', 'green' ;        eventsElement.append '  Start                                              Scroll  ' ;        eventsElement.listview 'refresh' ;        eventsElement.listview  ;      } ;       $ window .bind 'scrollstop', function    {         console.log 'Scroll stop' ;         $ '.ui-body-c' .css 'background', 'red' ;         eventsElement.append '  Stop                                              Scroll  ' ;         eventsElement.listview 'refresh' ;         eventsElement.listview  ;      } ;       $ window .bind 'orientationchange', function    {         console.log 'Orientationchange change' ;         $ '.ui-body-c' .css 'background', 'red' ;         eventsElement.append '                                           Orientation  ' ;         eventsElement.listview 'refresh' ;         eventsElement.listview  ;      } ;   } ;     ON THE CD  170      jQuery Pocket Primer  Portrait Mode versus Landscape Mode  In addition to detecting orientation of a mobile device, you will probably  need to change the CSS class that is used to style elements in a Web page when  there is a change of orientation.  The HTML5 Web page JQMOrientation1.html on the CD illustrates  how easily you can change the CSS classes associated with HTML elements  based on the orientation of a mobile device. The key logic is contained in this  code block: $ "page1" .live 'pageinit',  function event,ui {    $ window .bind  'orientationchange', function  e  {      console.log "new orientation: "+e.orientation ;      $ "content" .removeClass 'portrait landscape'          .addClass  e.orientation ? 'landscape' : 'portrait' ;    } ; } ; Notice that the orientationchange event is bound to the window object. In  the current example, the background color is set to red and the width is set to  320px in portrait mode, whereas the background color is set to blue and the  width is set to 480px in landscape mode.  One  other  thing  to  keep  in  mind  is  that window.orientation  has  the   value 0 for portrait mode and either -90 or 90 for landscape mode.  Another approach is to use the following type of code in your HTML Web   page: @media  all  and   orientation:  portrait   {  body  {background- color: red} } <link rel="stylesheet"        media="all and  orientation: landscape "                                         href="landscape.css"  > Figure 8.2 displays the result of rendering JQMOrientation1.html in a land-  scape-mode screenshot taken from an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  FIGURE 8.2  Detecting orientation on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  Animation Effects Using jQuery Mobile  There  are  various  jQuery-based  animation  effects  that  you  can  create  with jQuery Mobile, which includes fading effects, sliding effects, and custom    ON THE CD  User Gestures and Animation Effects in jQuery Mobile      171  Fade-related Methods  animation effects. The methods for creating animation effects  available both  in jQuery and jQuery Mobile  include: animation  , clearQueue  ,  de- lay  , dequeue  , fadeIn  , fadeOut  , fadeTo  , fadeToggle  ,  hide  , queue  , show  , slideDown  , slideToggle  , slideUp  ,  stop  , and toggle  .  This section contains code samples that illustrate how to create some of   these animation effects in jQuery Mobile.  The jQuery .fadeIn   and .fadeOut   methods provide an easy way to   create simple animation effects.  The HTML5 Web page JQMFadeInOut1.html on the CD illustrates how  to use the jQuery .fadeIn   and .fadeOut   methods in a jQuery Mobile  page, and its main logic looks like this:                          Click Header To Show Text                          <img id="sample1" src="Sample1.png"                                       width="200" height="200" >         <img id="sample2" src="Sample2.png"                                     width="200" height="200" >          <img id="sample3" src="Sample3.png"                                      width="200" height="200" >           Hello World from jQuery Mobile           Goodbye World from jQuery Mobile           Click on this text to toggle this paragraph.                  Footer                      $ "page1" .live 'pageinit',  function event,ui {         var imgs = $ "img" ;             fade out when users click on the first           $ "img:first" .click function    {           $ "img:first" .fadeOut "slow" ;          } ;                display first   when users click on the last            $ "img:last" .click function    {           $ "img:first" .fadeIn "slow" ;   172      jQuery Pocket Primer          } ;             fade when users click on the first           $ "p:first" .click function    {           $ "p:first" .fadeOut "slow" ;         } ;             display first   when users click on the last           $ "p:last" .click function    {           $ "p:first" .fadeIn "slow" ;         } ;       }        ;          The  HTML5  Web  page JQMFadeInOut1.html  contains  the  jQuery  Mobile  code for a single page view that responds to click events by storing a reference  to the images with this code snippet: var imgs = $ "img" ; If you have an HTML page with many   elements, the use of a variable  such  as  imgs  can  sometimes  be  more  efficient,  because  jQuery  performs  a  DOM  traversal  only  once.  In  this  code  sample,  we  don’t  use  the imgs  vari- able  because  there  are  just  three    elements,  so  there  is  no  noticeable  performance penalty involved in performing a search each time we reference  an   element. However, it’s important for you to be aware of this coding  technique.  The click event on the first image causes the image to slowly fade, as shown   here:    fade out when users click on the first   $ "img:first" .click function    {    $ "img:first" .fadeOut "slow" ;  } ;    The first image is slowly displayed again whenever users click on the right-most  image:    display first   when users click on the last   $ "img:last" .click function    {    $ "img:first" .fadeIn "slow" ; } ; You can use similar code blocks to capture events on other HTML elements.  In this example, we could have also captured all the   elements with this  snippet: var para = $ "p" ;   User Gestures and Animation Effects in jQuery Mobile      173  However, in JQMFadeInOut1.html we reference the first and last HTML    elements using $ "p:first"  and $ "p:last" , and we then perform simi- lar fade effects.  Figure 8.3 displays the result of rendering JQMFadeInOut1.html in land-  scape-mode in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  FIGURE 8.3  Fade effects on the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  Slide-Related jQuery Methods  As you can surmise, the jQuery .slideUp   and .slideDown   methods   provide slide-related functionality for jQuery Mobile.  The HTML5 Web page JQMSlideUpDown1.html on the CD illustrates  how to use the jQuery .slideUp   and .slideDown   methods in a jQuery  Mobile Web page, and a portion of the code is displayed here:                Header                  Click me or one of the Rectangles:          First          Second          Third          Fourth                Footer         ON THE CD          $ "page1" .live 'pageinit',  function event,ui  {       $ "page1" .click function   {         if  $ "div:first" .is ":hidden"   {         $ "div" .show "slow" ;        } else {         $ "div[name='first']" .slideUp 2000 ;        }   174      jQuery Pocket Primer        $ "div[name='first']" .css {background:'00f'}                .show 2000 .hide 2000 .slideDown 2000 ;      }      }              The  HTML5  Web  page  JQMSlideUpDown1.html  contains  a     ele- ment that uses CSS to apply some styling to four rectangles, followed by a code  block that handles a click event anywhere in the page view: $ "page1" .click function   {       handle a click event on the page } The  heart  of  the  jQuery  Mobile  code  consists  of  one  line  of  code  that  uses  method  chaining  to  create  a  multi-part  animation  effect  that  1   changes  the  background color to red, 2  performs a “show” and “hide” animation effect for 2  seconds, followed by 3  a “slide” effect that occurs during 2 seconds, whenever  users click on a rectangle, as shown here: $ "div[name='first']" .css {background:'00f'}          .show 2000 .hide 2000 .slideDown 2000 ;  Figure  8.4  displays  the  result  of  rendering JQMSlideUpDown1.html  in   landscape-mode on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  FIGURE 8.4  Fade effects on an Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.  jQuery Mobile and Transition Effects  jQuery Mobile uses WebKit-based CSS3 transforms for animating the page  transitions, and WebKit-based browsers currently provide the best support for  CSS3  transforms   but  other  browsers  are  improving  their  level  of  support .  Since WebKit–based browsers use hardware acceleration, CSS animation ef- fects appear smooth on mobile devices as well as laptops and desktops.  You  specify  a  transition  by  applying  the  data-transition  property,   whose seven supported values are:   cid:81  fade: simply fade the page or dialog in over the previous content    cid:81  flip: an animated page flip, rotating the current view out with the   other view on the reverse side    cid:81  pop: the page springs into view from the center of the screen    User Gestures and Animation Effects in jQuery Mobile      175    cid:81  slide: slide in from the left or right, pushing previous content out of     cid:81  slidedown: slide down from the top, over the top of the current   the way   content     cid:81  slideup: slide up to the top, revealing the next content below  jQuery Mobile also provides the animationComplete event, which you   can be useful after adding or removing a class that applies a CSS transition.  Listing 8.2 displays the contents of JQMTransition1.html that illustrates   how to use slidedown and ﬂ ip transitions in a jQuery Mobile page. LISTING 8.2 JQMTransition1.html                This is the first page header                             Go to Page  Two                      This is the first page footer                               This is the second page header                      You saw a slidedown effect        <a href="first" data-transition="flip"                          data-direction="reverse">           Go to Page 1 via 'flip' and reverse                              This is the second page footer                 176      jQuery Pocket Primer  Listing 8.2 contains the code for a jQuery Mobile Web page. When you click on  the link in the first page view, you will see a slide effect created by the following  code snippet in the content HTML   of the first page view  whose id  attribute has value first :   Go to Page Two   The second page view displays the following text and hyperlink: You saw a slidedown effect Go to Page 1 via ‘flip’ and reverse When you click on the preceding link, you will see a flip effect that is cre- ated with the following code snippet in the content HTML   of the sec- ond page view  whose id attribute has value second : <a href="first" data-transition="flip"                   data-direction="reverse"> Note that jQuery Mobile will attempt to use the reverse transition when us- ing the automatic back button or when hiding a dialog. This simple example  illustrates some page transition effects that you can create when you navigate  between page views. You can experiment with a number of different transition  effects to find the ones that suit your requirements.   Figure 8.5 displays the result of rendering JQMTransition1.html in List-  ing 8.2 in landscape mode in the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  FIGURE 8.5  Transition effects on the Chrome browser on a MacBook.  jQuery Mobile and Animation Effects with CSS3  Recall that jQuery Mobile uses WebKit-based CSS3 transforms for animat- ing the page transitions. WebKit browsers use hardware acceleration, so that  CSS animation effects appear smooth on mobile devices, laptops, and desktops. Listing 8.3 displays the contents of JQMJPG1.html that illustrates how to  use slideDown   and slideUp   in conjunction with JPG files in a jQuery  Mobile page.   User Gestures and Animation Effects in jQuery Mobile      177  LISTING 8.3 JQMRenderJPG1.html                         <img id="sample1" src="Sample1.png" width="200"                                             height="200" >        <img id="sample2" src="Sample2.png" width="200"                                             height="200" >                                 Click Me To Display The Right Image                         Click Me To Shrink The Right Image                                      $ "page1" .live 'pageinit',  function event,ui  {         $ "sample2" .hover function   {           $ this .slideUp 800 ;         } ;          $ "sample2" .hover function   {           $ this .css {'position':'relative',                        'width':'200px',                        'height':'200px'                        } ;         } ;          $ "button1" .click function   {           $ "sample2" .slideDown 800 ;         } ;          $ "button2" .click function   {           $ "sample2" .css {'position':'relative',                               'width':'100px',                               'height':'100px'                              } ;         } ;       }                  } ;     178      jQuery Pocket Primer  Listing  8.3  renders  two  images  and  contains  two  buttons  that  bind  to  click  events.  The  visual  effects  depend  on  the  sequence  in  which  the  buttons  are  clicked. When users click on the second button  “Click Me To Shrink The Right  Image” , the right-most image is reduced from its initial dimensions of 200x200  to dimensions of 100x100 using this code block: $ "button2" .click function   {   $ "sample2" .css {'position':'relative',                      'width':'100px',                      'height':'100px'                } ; } ; As you can see, the preceding code block uses the jQuery css   function to  modify the width and height of the right-most image, which means there is no  transition effect.  Next, if users hover over the right-most image  which is now reduced in  size , the image will shrink and disappear with a transitional effect because of  the following code block: $ "sample2" .hover function   {    $ this .slideUp 800 ; } ; Now if users click on the first button  “Click Me To Display The Right Image” ,  the second image will reappear  again using a transitional effect  with its origi- nal dimensions because of the following code: $ "button1" .click function   {    $ "sample2" .slideDown 800 ; } ; This code samples illustrates how easy it is to write jQuery code for creating  pleasant animation effects with images. Moreover, you can combine the jQuery  animation effects with the jQuery css   function. For example, you can use  the css   function to render an image with a background radial gradient effect  when users click on the image, or update  any other CSS properties of the image  or  element  in question.  Thus, you can combine your knowl- edge of jQuery animation, CSS, and CSS3  graphics and animation to create interest- ing effects by means of simple and com- pact jQuery code.

These events are useful because each one handles a mouse  event  as  well  as  its  corresponding  touch-based  event,  which  can  reduce  the  amount of code that you need to write in your Web pages. In addition, the use  of virtual mouse events can support both the desktop and mobile style interac- tions in the same Web page.  The name of a virtual mouse event in jQuery Mobile starts with the letter  “v”  for “virtual”  followed by the common or standard name for a mouse event.  For example, the vmousedown virtual event “delivers” the mousedown event  and also the touchstart event. The list of virtual mouse events  and their cor- responding touch-related and mouse-related events  is shown here:  vclick  touchend or mouse click events  vmousecancel  touch or mouse mousecancel events  vmousedown  touchstart or mousedown events  vmousemove  touchmove or mousemove events  vmouseover  touch or mouseover events  vmouseup  touchend or mouseup events   Keep  the  following  in  mind:  on  touch-enabled  devices,  the vclick  event  is  dispatched after the vmouseup event; however, vmouseup is dispatched before  vmousedown, and vmousedown is dispatched before vclick, as you would ex- pect. Furthermore, the event object contains the properties pageX,  pageY,  screenX, screenY, clientX, and clientY that contain coordinate informa- tion, as you will see in a subsequent code sample.  The HTML5 Web page JQM2DAnimationRGrad4Reﬂ ect1.html and the  CSS  stylesheet JQM2DAnimationRGrad4Reﬂ ect1.css  on  the  CD  illustrate  how to create CSS3 2D animation effects in jQuery Mobile.

The four CSS3 selectors define radial gradients  defined in the ac- companying CSS stylesheet on the CD , which are very similar to CSS3 code  samples in Chapter 2.  Read the appropriate section if you need to refresh your  memory.  The key point to notice is that even though the visual effects in this  code sample are not new, this code dem- onstrates you how easily you can combine  jQuery  Mobile  code  with  CSS3  2D 3D  graphics and animation effects.

The  code  uses  the  first  two  vir- tual mouse events to determine if a vmousemove event is accompanied with  a vmousedown event; if the latter is true, then a new HTML   element  is programmatically created at the current location of a user’s mouse and then  inserted into the DOM.

The HTML5 Web page JQM3DCube1.html  on the CD illustrates how to render a 3D cube with CSS3.

In this example, the CSS3 selectors  apply various 3D animation effects whenever users tap or hover over one of the  faces of the 3D cube.

Additional Code Samples on the CD  The CD contains several other code samples with similar techniques using  jQuery Mobile. You can use these techniques as “building blocks,” perhaps also  with some of your own, in order to create more complex visual effects.  The code samples are primarily for fun, and you can experiment with them  to create other interesting effects by modifying additional CSS properties dy- namically.  You can create page-turning effects in jQuery Mobile applications in vari- ous ways, and in this section you will see how to use the jQuery plugin Turn.js  whose homepage is here:  ON THE CD  http:  www.turnjs.com   184      jQuery Pocket Primer  This code sample contains many examples of handling jQuery Mobile vir- tual events as well as user gestures and key events. Although space precludes  us from discussing every detail of this code sample, it’s well worth your time to  read the code in detail to learn some useful techniques.  The HTML5 Web page JQMPageTurn1.html on the CD illustrates how  to use Turn.js in order to simulate page-turning effects in a jQuery Mobile  application.  Accelerometer Values with jQuery  The HTML5 Web page JQMAccelerometer1.html on the CD illustrates  how to display the accelerometer values of a mobile device whenever the device  undergoes acceleration in any direction.   ON THE CD  ON THE CD  Summary  This chapter introduced you to animation effects in jQuery Mobile, and you  saw code samples that illustrated how to perform various effects.

HTML5 Canvas  supports  various  APIs  for  rendering 2D shapes with an assortment of graphics effects. Although there are  many online Canvas-related and CSS3-related tutorials available  which you  can confirm via a quick Internet search , few of them provide code examples of  using both HTML5 Canvas and CSS3 graphics effects.   As you will see, various code samples in this chapter contain  sometimes  striking  combinations of HTML5 Canvas, CSS3 graphics, and CSS3 2D 3D  animation effects that you are unlikely to find in any online resources or topic- related books. These code samples provide a starting point for you to create  your own visually compelling graphics effects.  In  addition,  most  of  the  sections  in  this  chapter  start  with  the  syntax  of  the APIs that are used in the associated code listings, partly because the code  samples contain a lot of details and also illustrate multiple concepts. So, even  though this is an “introductory” chapter about HTML5 Canvas, you will learn  considerably more than you would expect from a basic overview that you might  find in other books.  The first part of this chapter shows you how to render line segments, rect- angles, and circles in HTML5 Canvas, and also how to combine HTML5 Can- vas with CSS3 stylesheets.   The second part introduces you to linear and radial gradients in HTML5  Canvas, with examples of how to apply them to Bézier curves and JPG files.  The third part of this chapter discusses jCanvas, which is a jQuery plugin for  HTML5 Canvas, and also an example of combining Canvas-based graphics  with jQuery Mobile.  The concepts and code samples in this chapter will help you understand  the HTML5 Canvas-based charts and graphs. If you want to explore additional    186      jQuery Pocket Primer  HTML5 Canvas graphics after you have finished reading this chapter, an ex- tensive set of code samples is available here:  http:  code.google.com p html5-canvas-graphics This chapter provides techniques for creating various visual effects that you  can use in your custom charts and graphs. At the same time, it’s also important  for you to assess the trade-off  time, effort, and cost  between writing low-level  Canvas-based graphics code, such as the code samples in this chapter, versus  the availability of open source projects and commercial products.   One more point to keep in mind:  HTML5 Canvas does not have any sort  of “dependency” on jQuery or jQuery Mobile. If necessary, you can create hy- brid HTML5 mobile applications containing HTML5 Canvas in conjunction  with other toolkits  such as PhoneGap  or even without a toolkit.  What is HTML5 Canvas?  Several years ago Canvas began in OS X as a widget toolkit. After Canvas  had already been available in the Safari browser, it became a specification for  the Web. Now, it is commonly referred to as HTML5 Canvas.   HTML5  Canvas  and  SVG  both  allow  you  to  programmatically  render  graphics in a browser via JavaScript. However, HTML5 Canvas uses “immedi- ate mode,” which is a write-and-forget approach to rendering graphics. Thus,  if you want to write a sketching program in HTML5 Canvas and you also want  to provide an “undo” feature, then you must programmatically keep track of  everything that users have drawn on the screen. On the other hand, SVG uses a  “retained mode,” which involves a DOM  Document Object Model  structure  that keeps track of the rendered objects and their relationship to one another. If you are going to write HTML Web pages that make extensive use of graph- ics effects, you’ll probably need to understand the differences between HTML5  Canvas and SVG in terms of performance. You have the freedom to use one  technology exclusively, but you can also create HTML Web pages that contain a  mixture of HTML5 Canvas, SVG, and CSS3. Performance-related information  can help you decide how you are going to code your HTML Web pages.   Although this chapter does not delve into the preceding points in any more  detail, you can find a good overview of some features advantages of HTML5  Canvas here:  http:  thinkvitamin.com code how-to-draw-with-html-5-canvas  Incidentally, if you need HTML5 Canvas support in Internet Explorer 8,  you can use ExplorerCanvas, which is an open source project that is available  here:  http:  code.google.com p explorercanvas  You can use the preceding code project simply by including the following   code snippet in your HTML Web pages:         Introduction to HTML5  Canvas      187  HTML5 Canvas versus SVG  One point to consider is when it’s advantageous to use HTML5 Canvas  instead  of  a  technology  such  as  SVG.  The  following  short  list  contains  some  features to consider when you are making this type of analysis:   cid:81   cid:31 Native versus plug-in browser support   cid:81  Level of SVG support in different browsers   cid:81  Animation support   cid:81  Support for filters  SVG only    cid:81  Built-in support for HTML-like widgets   cid:81  Third-party support  Most  modern  browsers  provide  varying  degrees  of  built-in  support  for  SVG,  and  Adobe’s  SVG  viewer  can  be  used  with  Microsoft’s  Internet  Explorer. If you need filter-based visual effects, then SVG provides a very rich   perhaps even the best  functionality. If you need built-in support for HTML  controls,  then  frameworks  such  as  Wijmo  might  be  a  good  solution  for  your  needs. Another point to consider is that Adobe no longer supports its SVG view- er. This is a significant decision, because Adobe’s SVG viewer had been the de  facto standard for SVG viewers for many years. Although Firefox and Opera  have made significant progress in terms of their support for SVG, and both are  enhancing their support for SVG, they still lack the feature support of Adobe’s  SVG viewer. Thus, you need to weigh the most important factors in order to  make the decision that will meet your project-related needs.  A very good article containing examples and diagrams that compares the   use of HTML5 Canvas and SVG is here:  http:  blogs.msdn.com b ie archive 2011 04 22 thoughts-on-when-to-use-  canvas-and-svg.aspx  The HTML5 Canvas Coordinate System  Think back to your days in high school, where you learned that the Car- tesian coordinate system identifies any point in the Euclidean plane by means  of a pair of numbers, often written as  x,y . The first number represents the  horizontal value and the second number represents the vertical value. The hori- zontal axis is labeled the x-axis, and positive values on the x-axis are to the right  of the vertical axis  i.e., toward the right . The vertical axis is labeled the y-axis,  and positive values on the y-axis are above the horizontal axis. The origin is the  intersection point of the x-axis and the y-axis.  The situation is almost the same in the HTML5 Canvas coordinate system.  The x-axis is horizontal and the positive direction is toward the right. The y-axis  is vertical, but the positive direction is downward, which is the opposite direc- tion of most graphs in a typical mathematics textbook. In the HTML5 Canvas  coordinate  system,  the  origin  is  the  upper-left  corner  of  the  screen   not  the    188      jQuery Pocket Primer  FIGURE 9.1  Four points rendered in  HTML5 Canvas.  lower-left corner , and the unit of measurement is the pixel. As this book goes to  print, the largest visible display is 2880×1800, and undoubtedly larger displays  will be available in the future.  As  a  simple  illustration,  Figure  9.1  displays   four points in an HTML5   element.  If you start from the origin  the upper-left cor- ner of the screen  and move 50 pixels to the right,  followed by 50 pixels downward, you will reach the  upper-left  point  in  Figure  9.1.  Next,  if  you  start  from the origin and move 200 pixels to the right  and 50 pixels downward, you will reach the upper- right point in Listing 9.1. In a similar fashion, the  two  points  in  the  second  “row”  have  coordinates   50,100   and   200,100 .  Notice  that  the  two  points in the first row have the same value for the y-coordinate, which makes  sense because they are the same distance away from the top of the Web page;  the same is true for the two points in the second row. Similarly, the two points  in the left “column” have the same x-coordinate because they are both the same  distance from the left side of the Web page.  Now that you have an understanding of the HTML5 Canvas coordinate  system, let’s take a look at the contents of Listing 9.1, which displays a minimal  HTML5 Web page that is ready for rendering HTML5 Canvas-based graphics.  Every Canvas-based code sample in this book uses the code  or some variant   that is displayed in Listing 9.1. Note that if you launch this code in a browser  session, you will only see a blank screen. LISTING 9.1 Canvas1.html               Canvas Drawing Rectangles      <!--     window.addEventListener 'load', function    {          Get the canvas element       var elem = document.getElementById 'myCanvas' ;       if  !elem  !elem.getContext  {         return;       }               Get the canvas 2d context       var context = elem.getContext '2d' ;       if  !context  {         return;       }   Introduction to HTML5  Canvas      189           Insert your custom Canvas graphics code here       } ;        -->                                                        No support for Canvas.           Listing 9.1 contains an HTML   element that checks for the existence of  an HTML   element inside the HTML   element of the Web  page, and then gets the 2D context from the HTML   element. If you  skip over the various conditional statements in Listing 9.1, there are two lines  of code that enable us to get a reference to the variable context, which repre- sents a drawable surface: var elem = document.getElementById 'myCanvas' ; var context = elem.getContext '2d' ; If you launch Listing 9.1 in a browser that does not support HTML5 Canvas,  the text message “No support for Canvas.” is displayed.  The following code snippet is executed whenever you launch the Web page  because of an anonymous JavaScript function that is executed during the load  event:  <!-- window.addEventListener 'load', function    {      do something here } ;    -->  Now that you understand the underlying code for rendering Canvas-based 2D  shapes, you can focus on the code that actually draws some 2D shapes, starting  with the example in the next section.  Line Segments, Rectangles, Circles, and Shadow Effects  This section contains an assortment of code samples that illustrate how to  render 2D shapes in HTML5 Canvas. There are many concepts introduced  in this section, so before delving into the code sample, let’s look at some of the  HTML5 Canvas APIs that are used in this section. Chapter 2 contains a section  that describes various ways for specifying colors, and the material in that sec- tion is relevant for the code sample in this chapter  so you can quickly review its  contents now if you need to do so .   HTML5 Canvas  provides  the ﬁ llRect    method  for  rendering  a  rect- angle, which requires four parameters:  the upper-left vertex  defined by its x-   190      jQuery Pocket Primer  coordinate and its y-coordinate  of the rectangle, the width of the rectangle, and  the height of the desired rectangle. The Canvas ﬁ llRect   API looks like this: context.fillRect x, y, width, height ;  HTML5  Canvas  allows  you  to  render  line  segments  by  specifying  the   x,y  coordinates of the two endpoints of a line segment. The two new APIs  that are used in the code sample in this section are moveTo   and lineTo  ,  and they look like this: context.moveTo x1, y1 ; context.lineTo x2, y2 ; The preceding code snippet represents the line segment whose two endpoints  are specified by the points  x1, y1  and  x2, y2 . Note that you can also  render the same line segment with the following code snippet: context.moveTo x2, y2 ; context.lineTo x1, y1 ; Shadow effects provide a richer visual experience that is an improvement over  the use of non-shadow effects. You create a shadow effect by assigning values to  three shadow-related attributes that control the size of the underlying shadow  and also the extent of the “fuzziness” of the shadow, as shown here: context.shadowOffsetX = shadowX; context.shadowOffsetY = shadowY; context.shadowBlur    = 4; You can also assign  R,G,B  or  R,G,B,A  values to shadowColor  which is an  attribute of the drawing context  as shown here: context.shadowColor   = "rgba 0,0,64,1.0 "; The HTML5 Web page RandRectanglesShadow.html in Listing 9.2  with  code sections omitted for brevity  uses this technique in order to render a set of  randomly generated rectangles with a shadow effect.

The loop calculates the coordi- nates of the upper-left vertex of each rectangle as shown here: basePointX = canWidth*Math.random  ; basePointY = canHeight*Math.random  ; The next part of the loop assigns the background color  which alternates be- tween a dark blue and dark red shadow , and then sets up the shadow effect  by specifying values for the attributes shadowOffsetX, shadowOffsetY, and  shadowBlur, as shown here: context.shadowOffsetX = shadowX; context.shadowOffsetY = shadowY; context.shadowBlur    = 4; The actual rendering of each rectangle is performed by the following code: context.fillRect basePointX, basePointY,                  rectWidth, rectHeight ; Notice  that  the  clickCount  variable  is  incremented  each  time  users  click  inside the HTML5 Canvas element, and its value determines which shadow  color is applied to the randomly generated rectangles.  Although shadow effects create a pleasing effect, they also have an impact  on performance. If you need shadow-like effects but performance becomes an  issue, one alternative is to render a background shape in black  or some other  dark color , and then rendering the same shape  with a small offset  using a  different color.   For example, you can create a shadow effect for rectangles by first render- ing a black rectangle and then rendering a red rectangle on top of the black  rectangle, as shown here:    render a black rectangle  context.fillStyle = '000'; context.fillRect 50+shadowX, 50+shadowY, 200, 100 ;     render a red rectangle  context.fillStyle = 'f00'; context.fillRect 50, 50, 200, 100 ; The values for shadowX and shadowY determine the size of the background  “shadow,” and the choice of positive versus negative values for shadowX and  shadowY will determine the relative position of the black rectangle with respect  to the red rectangle.  The  CSS  stylesheet  CSS3Background2.css  that  is  referenced  in  the  HTML5 Web page RandRectanglesShadow1.html is available on the CD.  This  CSS  stylesheet  contains  two  similar  CSS3  selectors  for  rendering  the  HTML5    element  defined  in  Listing  9.2,  as  well  as  a  hover-based  selector that changes the background of the HTML5   element when-  ON THE CD   Introduction to HTML5  Canvas      193  ever users hover over this element with  their  mouse.  The  myCanvas  selec- tor  defines  a  radial  gradient,  followed  by  two  repeating  radial  gradients  that  specify  various  combinations  of  red,  green,  yellow,  and  blue  at  different  pixel locations. A key point involves the  use  of  transparent,  which  changes  the  gap  between  consecutive  colors  that are rendered.  FIGURE  9.2  Canvas  random  rectangles  on  an  Asus Prime tablet with Android ICS.

HTML5 Canvas Linear Gradients  HTML5 Canvas provides two primary types of color gradients  similar to   SVG and CSS3 : linear gradients and radial gradients.   Linear color gradients can be further sub-divided into three types:  hori- zontal linear gradients, vertical linear gradients, and diagonal linear gradients.  Thus, HTML5 Canvas provides color gradients that enable you to create pleas- ing visual effects.   A linear gradient is defined in terms of ColorStop elements, each of which  contains a decimal  between 0 and 1  and a hexadecimal value that represents  a  color.  For  example,  if  you  define  a  linear  gradient  with  an  initial  color  of  FF0000  the hexadecimal value for red  and a final color of 000000  the  hexadecimal value for black , then the resultant color gradient will range  in a  linear fashion  from red to black. Linear gradients enable you to create vivid  and  interesting  color  combinations,  and  they  are  available  in  three  varieties:   horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. Note that “linear gradient” and “linear color  gradient” are used interchangeably in this book.  Horizontal, Vertical, and Diagonal Linear Gradients  As you learned in the introduction of this chapter, HTML5 Canvas sup- ports  the  method  createLinearGradient  that  you  can  use  to  program- matically create linear gradients. Its syntax looks like this: context.createLinearGradient startX, startY, endX, endY ; The HTML5 page LGradRectangles1.html in Listing 9.4 demonstrates how  to  render  a  set  of  rectangles  with  horizontal,  vertical,  and  diagonal  linear  gra- dients. Listing 9.3 references the CSS3 stylesheet HoverAnimation1.css that  applies CSS3 keyframes-based 2D animation to the first HTML5    element whenever users hover over this   element with their mouse.  Listing 9.4 also references the CSS3 stylesheet HoverAnimation2.css, which    194      jQuery Pocket Primer  acts  in  a  similar  fashion.  However,  this  stylesheet  applies  CSS3  3D  animation  effects to the second HTML5   element in Listing 9.3. Since the ani- mation techniques in these CSS stylesheets were discussed in Chapter 2, we will  omit them from this chapter, but the entire source code is available on the CD.

The linear gradients have two, three,  or four invocations of the addColorStop   meth- od, using various combinations of colors  expressed  in hexadecimal form  so that you can see some of  the gradient effects that are possible.  Experiment with different values for the color  stop definitions to see how their values change the  appearance of the rendered rectangles.  set  of   random- ly  generated  rectangles  with  a  shadow  effect   Figure  9.3  displays  a   FIGURE  9.3  Linear  gradient  rectangles on a Nexus 7 tablet  with Android JellyBean.   196      jQuery Pocket Primer  Radial Color Gradients  based on LGradRectangles1.html, in landscape mode on a Nexus 7 tablet  with Android JellyBean.  A radial color gradient is the second type of HTML5 Canvas-based color  gradient. You can define a radial color gradient via the createRadialGradi- ent    method,  using  the addColorStop    method  to  add  color  values.  Its  syntax  without the addColorStop   method  looks like this: context.createRadialGradient startCenterX, startCenterY,     startRadius, endsCenterX, endCenterY, endRadius ; A  radial  color  gradient  can  be  compared  to  the  ripple  effect  that  is  created  when you drop a stone in a pond, where each “ripple” has a color that changes  in  a  gradient  fashion.  Each  ripple  corresponds  to  a  color  stop  element.  For  example, if you define a radial gradient with a start color of FF0000  which  is red  and an end color of 000000  which is black , then the resultant color  gradient will range—in a radial fashion—from red to black. Radial gradients can  also contain multiple start stop color combinations. The point to keep in mind  is that radial gradients change colors in a linear fashion, but the rendered colors  are drawn in a set of expanding concentric circles. Note that “radial gradient”  and “radial color gradient” are used interchangeably in this book.  The  HTML5  Web  page RGradRectangles1.html,  which  renders  line  segments, rectangles, and circles in an HTML5   element using linear  and radial gradients, is available on the CD. gradient1 = context.createRadialGradient currentX,                                          currentY,                                          0,                                         currentX+rectWidth,                                           currentY+rectHeight,                                          rectWidth ;  gradient1.addColorStop 0, 'f00' ; gradient1.addColorStop 1, '00f' ; context.fillStyle = gradient1; context.fillRect currentX, currentY,                  rectWidth, rectHeight ; The  HTML5  Web  page  RGradRectangles1.htmlis  similar  to  Listing  9.3, except for the use of a radial gradient  instead of a linear gradient  that  ranges in a radial fashion from blue to red. The method addColorStop    is  invoked  four  times  in  order  to  add  four  “color  stop  values”  to  the  radial  gradient. This Web page also references HoverAnimation1.css, whose en- tire source code is available on the CD.

HTML5 Canvas Transforms and Saving State  HTML5 Canvas enables you to rotate, scale, shear, or translate  shift hori- zontally and or vertically  2D shapes and text strings with the following methods: rotate x,y  scale x,y  transform x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3  translate x,y  One thing to keep in mind is that you specify the transforms you want to apply   along with setting attributes values  before actually rendering a graphics shape  in your HTML5 Web pages.  The following code snippets illustrate sample values that you can use in the  preceding Canvas methods, where context is a JavaScript variable that refer- ences the context of an HTML5   element: context.rotate 30*Math.PI 180 ; context.scale 0.8, 0.4 ; context.translate 100, 200 ; context.transform 1, 0, 0.5, 1, 0, 0 ;  The rotate   method in the preceding code block references the JavaScript  constant Math.PI whose value represents PI radians. In case you have forgot- ten, PI radians equal 180 degrees, so 2*PI radians is 360 degrees, and PI 2  radians is 90 degrees. Hence, Math.PI 6 radians  or 30*Math.PI 180  is the  same as 30 degrees. You won’t need to know anything more about radians, but  feel free to perform an Internet search if you want to read some tutorials that  provide additional examples.  Two  additional  APIs  in  HTML5  Canvas  are  save    and  restore  ,  which enable you to save the current state of a canvas state, make some changes,  and then restore the original state of the canvas. The save   method “pushes”  the current state on a stack, and the restore   method “pops” the most recent  state that was pushed onto the stack.   ON THE CD  ON THE CD  198      jQuery Pocket Primer  You can save  and later restore  a canvas state after having applied any of  the transformations listed in this section, and also after having specified values  for shadow-related attributes  among others . You can invoke the save   and  restore   methods multiple times on a canvas state, which makes these two  methods very useful for game-related Web pages. We will not use these two  methods in any code samples in this chapter, but you can perform an Internet  search to read tutorials and also find code samples.  The HTML5 Web page JQMCanvasTransforms1.html on the CD illus-  trates how to apply four HTML5 Canvas transforms to a text string.  jCanvas: a jQuery Plugin for HTML5 Canvas  The jCanvas jQuery plugin enables you to use jQuery syntax in order to  specify  2D  shapes  that  are  rendered  in  an  HTML5     element.  Its  homepage is here:  http:  calebevans.me projects jcanvas   The  HTML5  Web  page  JCanvasSam- ples1.html on the CD illustrates how to ren- der several 2D shapes using jCanvas.  Figure 9.5 displays the result of rendering  JCanvasSamples1.html  in  landscape  mode  on an iPad3.  You  can  also  use  jQuery  Mobile  with  HTML5 Canvas, as shown in the code sample  in the next section.  FIGURE  9.5  The  plugin on an iPad3.  jQuery  jCanvas   HTML5 Canvas with CSS3 and jQuery Mobile  By  now,  we  hope  you  understand  how  to  render  2D  shapes  in  HTML5  Canvas. This section contains a code sample that shows you how to combine  jQuery Mobile, HTML5 Canvas, and the dynamic creation of HTML    elements whenever users tap inside the HTML5    element in this  Web page.  Keep in mind that although the graphics effects are not necessarily relevant  to your requirements, this code sample does illustrate how to handle dynamic  creation of elements as well as tap events in jQuery Mobile  which are handled  differently from tap events in jQuery .

After initial- izing some JavaScript variables, Listing 9.4 contains the definition of the JavaS- cript variables gradient1, gradient2, gradient3, and gradient4, each of  which contains the definition of a Webkit-based radial gradient.  When users tap on the   element whose id has value MyCanvas,  the code adds a new rectangle at the location of the tap event, and then the    element slowly disappears, as shown here: $ "MyCanvas" .live 'vmousedown',function event  {   xCoord = 0.40* event.clientX *window.devicePixelRatio;   yCoord = 0.40* event.clientY *window.devicePixelRatio;      context.fillStyle  =  rectColors[++tapCount%rectColors. length];   context.fillRect xCoord, yCoord, rectWidth, rectHeight ;    $ "MyCanvas" .hide "slow" ; } ;  Keep in mind that you must use the vmousedown event, because a tap event in  jQuery Mobile does not provide you with the coordinates of the location of the  tap event. You also need to use the value of window.devicePixelRatio in  the calculations for the location of the tap event.  When users tap on the   element whose id has value tapInside,  the hidden   element is displayed again, along with any rectangles that  were previously rendered via the ﬁ llRect   method.  When users tap on the   element whose id value is CanvasPar- ent, the code first uses conditional logic to determine which radial gradient to  select and assign to the JavaScript variable currentBG.  Next, a new HTML   element is dynamically created at the location    Introduction to HTML5  Canvas      203  of the tap event and appended to the CanvasParent element, as shown here: newNode = $ ' ' .css {'position':'absolute',                           'background': currentBG,                           'width':'35px',                           'height':'35px',                            top: event.pageY,                            left: event.pageX                           } ;    append the new rectangle to CanvasParent $ "CanvasParent" .append newNode ; Notice that the position property is set to absolute in the preceding code  block, which means that this dynamically created   element will remain  visible whenever the MyCanvas element slowly fades from view. However, all  the rectangles that are rendered using the fillRect   method will also slowly  disappear.  Finally, whenever users click on any of the bottom four   elements  that are rendered with radial gradients, the code will cause them to disappear  “out of sequence,” and the remaining visible elements will be shifted accord- ingly.

Since each of these selectors defines Webkit-based ra- dial gradients that you have already seen in earlier ex- amples in this book, we won’t discuss the details of those  gradients.

Introduction to HTML5  Canvas      205  Additional Code Samples on the CD  ON THE CD  HTML5 Canvas  provides  support  for  both  quadratic  Bézier  curves  and  cubic Bézier curves. The code samples in this section show you how to gener- ate interesting combinations of Bézier curves by using various types of gradient  shading. Later in this book, you will see how to use ECMAScript in order to  programmatically change the values of attributes.  Bézier curves are named after Pierre Bézier, who promoted them during  the 1970s. Bézier curves can represent many non-linear shapes, they can be  found in interesting applications, including PostScript for the representation of  fonts. An Internet search will yield many Web pages with interesting demon- strations  some of which also require additional plug-ins . You’ll find computer  programs written in C and Java, some of which are interactive, that demonstrate  Bézier curves.  Cubic Bézier curves have two end points and two control points, whereas  quadratic Bézier curves have two end points and a single control point. The  x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a cubic Bézier curve can be represented as a  parameterized cubic equation whose coefficients are derived from the control  points and the end points. The beauty of HTML5 Canvas is that it allows you to  define both quadratic and cubic Bézier curves via the   element without  having to delve into the mathematical underpinnings of Bézier curves. If you’re  interested in learning the specific details, you can browse the Web, where you’ll  find books and plenty of articles that cover this interesting topic.  HTML5 Canvas provides the quadraticCurveTo   method for creating  quadratic Bézier curves, which requires one control point and an end point.  HTML5 Canvas also provides the bezierCurveTo   method for creating cu- bic Bézier curves, which requires you to specify two control points and an end  point. The context point  which is the location of the most recently rendered  point  is used as the start point for quadratic and cubic Bézier curves.  The syntax for the HTML5 Canvas quadraticCurveTo   method looks   like this: quadraticCurveTo controlX, controlY, endX, endY ; The syntax for the HTML5 Canvas bezierCurveTo   method looks like this: bezierCurveTo controlX1,controlY1,controlX2,controlY2,endX,endY ; The  HTML5  page LRGradQCBezier1.html  demonstrates  how  to  render  a  quadratic Bézier curve with linear gradient shading and a cubic Bézier curve  with radial gradient shading. The two CSS stylesheets CSS3Background4.css  and HoverAnimation1.css are available on the CD.  The cubic Bézier curve defined in the HTML5 page LRGradQCBezier1. html  is rendered with a radial gradient using six color stops, based on several  calculated points, as shown here: context.bezierCurveTo       currentX+3*multiplier*rectWidth,   ON THE CD   206      jQuery Pocket Primer       currentY+2*multiplier*rectHeight,      currentX+2*multiplier*rectWidth,       currentY-multiplier*rectHeight,      currentX+100, currentY+300 ; Experiment with different values for the points in a Bézier curve, and you might  find other ways to create pleasing visual effects. The next portion of Listing 9.6  renders a quadratic Bézier curve using a linear gradient with five color stops.  Note that whenever users click on the “redraw” button, another cubic and  quadratic Bézier curve are drawn, based on the value of the variable click- Count that is incremented each time that users click on the “redraw” button.  The new curves are superimposed on the previous curves, thereby creating a  nice visual effect. However, if you want to refresh the HTML5   ele- ment prior to rendering another pair of Bézier curves, simply uncomment the  second line in the following code snippet:    clear the canvas before drawing new set of rectangles   context.clearRect 0, 0, elem.width, elem.height ;  Figure  9.7  renders  the  quadratic  and  cubic  Bézier  curves  that  are  defined  in  LRGradQCBezier1.html  in  landscape  mode on an iPad3.  HTML5  Canvas  supports  the  ren- dering of JPG files, and you can also apply  CSS selectors to the HTML5    element.  The  CD  contains  the  HTML5  Web  page  Image1.html  and  Image1.  ON THE CD  FIGURE 9.7  Gradient Bézier curves on an iPad3.  css whose selectors match the HTML5   element.  Incidentally,  HTML5  Canvas  also  supports  a  clip    method  that  enables  you  to  “clip”  JPG  files  in  various  ways.  Moreover,  you  can  perform  compositing effects, and you can even manipulate the individual pixels of a JPG  file. Search the Internet for articles that describe the technical details of these  effects.  HTML5 Canvas provides the method createPattern image,  type   that enables you to render a set of images according to a pattern type, whose  values can be repeat, repeat-x, repeat-y, and no-repeat. An example of  the syntax  and also how to use it  looks like this: var pattern = canvas.createPattern img,"repeat" ; canvas.fillStyle = pattern; canvas.fillRect 0,0,500,300 ; The HTML5 Web page RepeatingImage1.html on the CD illustrates how to  repeat a JPG image on an HTML5   element.

Other HTML5 Canvas Toolkits  There are several very good JavaScript toolkits available that provide a layer  of abstraction on top of HTML5 Canvas , including Easel.js, Fabric.js,  and Paper.js.  In addition to the code samples that are available on the respective homep- age of these toolkits, you might enjoy the contents of the following open source  project, which uses Easel.js to create graphics code samples:  http:  code.google.com p easeljs-graphics  Summary  This chapter introduced you to HTML5 Canvas and showed you examples  of creating 2D shapes with the HTML5   element. You also learned  how to combine HTML5 Canvas with jQuery custom code so that you can ma- nipulate HTML5 Web pages with Canvas-based 2D shapes. In particular, you  learned how to do the following in HTML5 Canvas:   cid:81   cid:31 Render line segments, rectangles, and circles   cid:81  Create linear and radial gradients   cid:81  Create Bézier curves   cid:81  Display JPG files   cid:81  Use jCanvas  a jQuery plugin for Canvas    cid:81  Combine HTML5 Canvas with CSS3   cid:81  Combine HTML5 Canvas with jQuery Mobile    C H A P T E R10  USING PHONEGAP FOR HTML5  MOBILE APPS This chapter shows you how to create HTML5-based hybrid mobile ap-  plications for Android and iOS. The code samples in this chapter contain  HTML5 and various combinations of HTML5, CSS3, and SVG.   As you will soon discover, there are more Android-based code samples than  iOS-based code samples. The choice of mobile platform for the code samples  is purely a stylistic one. However, every Android-based code sample does have  an iOS-based counterpart, and vice versa  both platforms provide the necessary  feature support for all the samples in this chapter . Although it was possible to  include the same set of code samples for both platforms, doing so would have  been needlessly redundant. Moreover, this chapter provides you with the infor- mation that you need in order to “convert” an Android-based code sample to its  iOS counterpart  and vice versa .  The first part of this chapter provides an overview of how to develop hybrid  Android  applications  using  a  “manual”  approach  instead  of  a  toolkit  such  as  PhoneGap. The code samples in this section use the same code that you have  seen in earlier chapters, and they show you how to create the hybrid Android  mobile applications that will enable you to create the same screenshots. If you  feel  ambitious,  you  can  create  Android-based  mobile  applications  for  all  the  code samples in this book!  The second part of this chapter contains Android-based code samples that  show you how to combine native Android applications with CSS3, SVG, and  HTML5 Canvas. This section contains an example of rendering a mouse-en- abled multi-line graph whose values can be updated whenever users click on  the button that is rendered underneath the line graph. Keep in mind that the  discussion following the code samples moves quickly because the HTML Web  pages contain simple markup, the CSS3 selectors contain code that you have  seen in earlier chapters, and the SVG shapes are discussed in Chapter 4.  The third part of this chapter provides a quick overview of Apache Cordova   formerly known as PhoneGap , which is a popular cross-platform toolkit for    210      jQuery Pocket Primer  developing mobile applications. In 2011 Adobe acquired Nitobi, the company  that created PhoneGap, and shortly thereafter Adobe open sourced PhoneGap.  This section explains what PhoneGap can do, and some toolkits that you can  use with PhoneGap. You will learn how to create a PhoneGap-based Android  application that renders CSS3-based animation effects. You can deploy this mo- bile application to Android-based mobile devices that support Android ICS or  higher.  The final part of this chapter discusses how to create iOS hybrid mobile   applications using the PhoneGap plugin for Xcode.   As you will see in this chapter, PhoneGap allows you to create mobile ap- plications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can deploy those mobile ap- plications to numerous platforms, including Android, iOS, BlackBerry and Win- dows Mobile. You can also create mobile applications that combine PhoneGap  with Sencha Touch, another popular framework . However, due to space limi- tations, Sencha Touch is not discussed in this chapter.   If you are unfamiliar with any of the mobile platforms in this chapter, you  can still work through the examples in this chapter because they consist of HT- ML5-based  code.  The  sequence  of  steps  for  creating  HTML5-based  mobile  applications on a mobile platform is essentially independent of the actual code.   HTML5 CSS3 and Android Applications  If you are unfamiliar with Android, you can read the Appendix for this book  that contains a concise overview of the Android-specific concepts in the code  samples in this chapter. You can refer to the appropriate section whenever you  encounter an Android concept that is not clear to you.  The code sample in this section shows you how to launch an HTML5 Web  page  which also references a CSS3 stylesheet  inside an Android application.  The key idea consists of three steps: 1. Modify the Android Activity class to instantiate an Android Web-  View class, along with some JavaScript-related settings.  2. Reference an HTML5 Web page that is in the assets www subdirec-  tory of the Android project.  3. Copy the HTML5 Web page, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files   into the assets www subdirectory of the Android project.  In Step 3, you will probably create a hierarchical set of directories that contain  files that are of the same type  HTML, CSS, or JavaScript , in much the same  way that you organize your files in a Web application.  Now launch Eclipse and create an Android project called AndroidCSS3.  Make sure that you select Android version 3.1 or higher, which is necessary in  order to render CSS3-based effects.  After you have created the project, let’s take a look at four files that con- tain the custom code for this Android mobile application. Listings 10.1, 10.2,    Using PhoneGap for HTML5 Mobile Apps      211  and 10.3 respectively display the contents of the project files main.xml, An- droidCSS3.html, and AndroidCSS3Activity.java. LISTING 10.1 main.xml   <LinearLayout xmlns:android="http:  schemas.android.com apk                                      res android"     android:orientation=”vertical”     android:layout_width=”fill_parent”     android:layout_height=”fill_parent”>   <WebView android:id=”@+id webview”            android:layout_width=”fill_parent”            android:layout_height=”fill_parent”>       Listing  10.1  specifies  a  LinearLayout  that  contains  an  Android  WebView,  which will occupy the entire screen of the mobile device. This is the behavior  that we want to see, because the Android default browser is rendered inside the  Android WebView. LISTING 10.2 AndroidCSS3.html        CSS Radial Gradient Example                 Text1     Text2     Text3     Text4         Listing  10.2  is  a  straightforward  HTML  Web  page  that  references  a  CSS  stylesheet  AndroidCSS3.css   that  is  available  on  the  CD ,  along  with  an  HTML   element  whose id attribute has value outer  that serves as a  “container” for four more HTML   elements.  The CSS stylesheet AndroidCSS3.css contains a CSS selector for styling  the HTML   element whose id has value outer, followed by four CSS se- lectors radial1, radial2, radial3, and radial4 that are used to style the  corresponding HTML   elements in Listing 10.2.

The  final  line  of  code  loads  the  contents  of  the  HTML  Web  page An- droidCSS3.html  which is in the assets www  subdirectory , as shown  here: webview.loadUrl "file:   android_asset AndroidCSS3.html" ; Figure 10.1 displays a CSS3-based Android application on an Asus Prime tablet  with Android ICS.  SVG and Android Applications  The example in this section shows you how to create an Android mobile  application that renders SVG code that is embedded in an HTML5 Web page.  Now launch Eclipse and create an Android project called AndroidSVG1, mak- ing sure that you select Android version 3.1 or higher, which is necessary in  order to render SVG elements.   The example in the previous section contains four custom files, whereas  the Android SVG example in this section contains two files with custom code:  the HTML5 Web page AndroidSVG1.html in Listing 10.4 and the Java class  AndroidSVG1.java, which is available on the CD.

Appendix  A contains examples of these 2D shapes  among others , and you can review the  appropriate material if you need to refresh your memory.  The Java class AndroidSVG1Activity.java is omitted, but its contents  are very similar to Listing 10.3. The complete source code is available on the  CD.

Launch  Eclipse and create an Android project called AndroidCanvas1. Make sure that  you select Android version 3.1 or higher, which is necessary in order to render  SVG elements.   The example in this section contains one custom file called AndroidCan-  vas1.html, which is displayed in Listing 10.5.

The draw   function contains JavaScript code that draws a set of line  segments  and  arcs  into  the  HTML5    element,  whose id  attribute  has value canvas1. You can review the code samples in chapter eleven that  have similar functionality if you don’t remember the details of the syntax of this  JavaScript code.  Figure  10.3  displays  a  Canvas-based  Android application on an Asus Prime tablet  with Android ICS.  The next portion of this chapter delves  into  PhoneGap,  which  is  a  toolkit  that  au- tomatically  creates  the  lower  level  “scaf- folding”  that  you  performed  manually  in  the  previous  part  of  this  chapter.  You  will  get instructions for installing the PhoneGap  plugin for Eclipse to create Android mobile  applications. Later in this chapter, you will  also learn how to install the PhoneGap plugin for Xcode in order to create HT- ML5-based mobile applications for iOS mobile devices.  FIGURE  10.3  A  Canvas-based  Android  application on an Asus Prime tablet with An- droid ICS.  What is PhoneGap?  PhoneGap is an open source device agnostic mobile application develop- ment tool that enables you to create cross-platform mobile applications using  CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, and its homepage is here:  http:  phonegap.com The PhoneGap homepage provides documentation, code samples, and a   download link for the PhoneGap distribution.  PhoneGap enables you to create HTML-based mobile application for An- droid, Blackberry, iPhone, Palm, Symbian, and Windows Mobile. PhoneGap  provides support for touch events, event listeners, rendering images, database  access, different file formats  XML and JSON , and Web Services.   Note that if you want to develop iPhone applications, you must have a Mac- Book  or  some  other  OS  X  machine,  along  with  other  dependencies  that  are  discussed later in this chapter. How Does PhoneGap Work?  PhoneGap  mobile  applications  involve  a  Web  view  that  is  embedded  in a native “shell,” and your custom code runs in the Web view. In addition,  PhoneGap provides a JavaScript API for accessing native features of a mobile  device, and your code can use PhoneGap in order to access those native fea- tures. For example, PhoneGap contains JavaScript APIs for accessing Acceler- ometer, Camera, Compass, Contacts, Device information, Events, Geolocation,  Media, Notification, and Storage.   218      jQuery Pocket Primer  Keep in mind that PhoneGap does not provide HTML UI elements. Thus, if  you need this functionality in your mobile applications, you can add other toolkits  and frameworks, such as jQuery Mobile, Sencha Touch, or Appcelerator.  Now that you have a basic understanding of the capabilities of PhoneGap,  install the PhoneGap 2.0  which was released as this book goes to print  for  Xcode and Eclipse by following the instructions here:  http:  outof.me phonegap-2-0-getting-started   In case you prefer to compile your mobile applications in the “cloud,” Adobe  provides a Website for this purpose:  https:  build.phonegap.com   If you have completed the installation of the PhoneGap plugin for Eclipse, you  are now ready to create a PhoneGap application for Android, which is the topic  of the next section.  Creating Android Apps with The PhoneGap Plugin   Create  an  Android  project  in  Eclipse  by  clicking  on  the  icon  for  the  PhoneGap plugin and then  for the purposes of this example  specify PGJQM1  for the Project  Name, check the checkbox for including the jQuery Mobile  files, select the Android version that your Android device supports, and then  enter com.iquarkt.phonegap as the package name.   Click the “Finish” button. After the project has been created, navigate to  the assets www subdirectory of the newly created Android project. You will  find  the  following  files   version  numbers  might  be  different  when  this  book  goes to print : index.html phonegap-1.3.0.js  There  is  also  a  generated  Java  file  PhoneGap1Activity.java,  whose   contents are displayed in Listing 10.6.

Now navigate to Run > Android application in  order to launch this Android project and on your Android  device you will see something similar to Figure 10.4.  Figure 10.4 displays a set of menu items that enable   you to access hardware-related functionality.  Working with HTML5, PhoneGap, and iOS  FIGURE 10.4  A  PhoneGap-based  Android mobile  application.  This  section  shows  you  how  to  create  iOS  mobile  applications  using  PhoneGap, which is exactly the process that was used to create the iOS mobile  applications in this book.   Their screenshots on an iPad3 are included in vari- ous chapters.  Every iOS mobile application in this book was developed on a  MacBook OS X 10.8.2 with Apple’s Xcode 4.5 and PhoneGap.  Earlier in this chapter you learned how to create Android applications in  Eclipse, which is an IDE that runs on multiple OSes, but the situation is differ- ent for creating iOS applications  with or without PhoneGap .   First you need access to an Apple device  such as a MacBook, Mac Mini,  or Mac Pro  with Apple’s Xcode installed in order to create mobile applications  for iOS mobile devices. If you register as a developer you can download Xcode  for free, or for $4.99 in the Apple iStore. Although this section uses Xcode 4.5,  it is possible to install a lower version of Xcode.  However, make sure that you  check the minimum required version for OS X.    222      jQuery Pocket Primer  Secondly, you need to install the PhoneGap plugin for Xcode 4 by following  the detailed instructions here  which also contain a link for installing PhoneGap  on Xcode 3 :  http:  wiki.phonegap.com w page 39991939 Getting%20Started%20  with%20PhoneGap%20iOS%20using%20Xcode%204  Thirdly, you need to register as an Apple Developer  which costs $99 per  year  if you want to deploy your iOS mobile applications to iOS devices. How- ever, if you only plan to use the iOS Simulator, you can do so at no charge.  After you have set up a laptop with the required software, you will be ready  to create an iOS mobile application with PhoneGap, which is the topic of the  next section.  NOTE  ON THE CD  PhoneGap applications always have the same filename in- dex.html, so in order to provide multiple PhoneGap project  files in the same directory on the CD, the HTML Web page  index.html for each PhoneGap project is saved in a Web  page whose name is the same as the project. For example, the  contents of the HTML Web page ThreeDCube1.html in the  next section are actually the same as the generated Web page  index.html that is specific to the PhoneGap project in the  next section.  A CSS3 Cube on iOS Using PhoneGap  Create  an  Xcode  application  called  ThreeDCube1  by  selecting  the  PhoneGap  plugin.   Make  sure  that  your  filenames  start  with  an  alphabetical  character, or you will get errors when you attempt to compile and deploy your  applications.   Note that if you are using Xcode 4.3.1, then you will need to perform a  manual copy of the generated www subdirectory into the project home direc- tory  of  your  current  Xcode  application.  When  you  have  performed  this  step  correctly, you will no longer see an error message when you launch your mobile  application in the Simulator or on your iOS device.  The  CSS  stylesheet  ThreeDCube1.css  is  the  same  as  the  CSS  file  3DCube1.css in Chapter 2, so we won’t display its contents here. Listing 10.9  displays the contents of the HTML Web page ThreeDCube1.html that is the  same as the HTML Web page index.html that is generated by the PhoneGap  plugin in XCode. LISTING 10.9 index.html             CSS 3D Cube Example        Using PhoneGap for HTML5 Mobile Apps      223    <meta name="viewport"         content="width=device-width,  initial-scale=1.0,  maximum- scale=1.0, user-scalable=no;"  >              <link  rel="stylesheet"  media="only  screen  and   max-device- width: 1024px " href="ipad.css" type="text css"  >     <link  rel="stylesheet"  media="only  screen  and   max-device- width: 480px " href="iphone.css" type="text css"  >   -->    <!-- If your application is targeting iOS BEFORE 4.0 you MUST  put json2.js from        http:  www.JSON.org json2.js into your www directory and  include it here -->                   If you want to prevent dragging, uncomment this section    *   function preventBehavior e    {       e.preventDefault  ;     };   document.addEventListener "touchmove", preventBehavior, false ;   *     function onBodyLoad     {     document.addEventListener "deviceready", onDeviceReady,       false ;   }    function onDeviceReady     {        do your thing!     navigator.notification.alert "PhoneGap is working"    }                 Text1    224      jQuery Pocket Primer     Text2     Text3           Listing 10.9 is the result of combining the HTML Web page 3DCube1.html  from Chapter 2  which is essentially a set of HTML   elements  with the  HTML  Web  page index.html  that  is  automatically  generated  by  PhoneGap  when you create a mobile application in Xcode using the PhoneGap plugin.  Now run this mobile application, either  in the Xcode Simulator or on your mobile de- vice, and you will see a graphics image that is  similar to Figure 10.5.  The process for creating the other iOS- based  mobile  applications  in  this  chapter  is identical to the process for the preceding  iOS  mobile  application,  so  there  is  no  need  to include additional examples. However, it’s  worth your while to spend some time creating  additional iOS mobile applications, which will increase your comfort level and  perhaps also motivate you to learn about other features of Xcode.  FIGURE 10.5  A CSS3 cube on an iPad3.  Additional Code Samples on the CD  ON THE CD  ON THE CD  Although Android does not have built-in support for rendering charts and  graphs, you can create them using Canvas-based code that is very similar to the  code in the previous section.  Launch  Eclipse  and  create  an  Android  project  called AndroidCanvas- MultiLine2, making sure that you select Android version 3.1 or higher. The  HTML5 Web page AndroidCanvasMultiLine2.html on the CD contains  JavaScript code for rendering multiple line graphs using HTML5 Canvas.  Figure 10.6 displays a Canvas-based multi-line graph Android application   on a Nexus S 4G with Android ICS.  FIGURE 10.6  A Canvas-based multi-line Graph on an Android smart phone.   Using PhoneGap for HTML5 Mobile Apps      225  The  Android  project  HTML5CanvasBBall2  contains  the  HTML5  Web  page HTML5CanvasBBall2.html that contains JavaScript code for creating a  bouncing ball effect in HTML5 Canvas.  The Android project PhoneGapForm1 contains the HTML5 Web page PhoneGapForm1.html  which will actually be named index.html in your  Android project  that illustrates how to create a form for various types of user  input in PhoneGap, and the types of the input fields are such that the following  occurs when users navigate to this form:   cid:81   cid:31 Text input displays a standard keyboard    cid:81  Telephone input displays a telephone keypad    cid:81  URL input displays a URL keyboard    cid:81  Email input displays an email keyboard    cid:81  Zip code input displays a numeric keyboard  For the final code sample in this chapter, create an Xcode application called  ThreeDCube1  by  selecting  the  PhoneGap  plugin.   Make  sure  that  your  file- names  start  with  an  alphabetical  character  or  you  will  get  errors  when  you  attempt  to  compile  and  deploy  your  applications.   Copy  the  CSS  stylesheet  ThreeDCube1.css  into  your  project,  and  replace  index.html  with  the  HTML Web page ThreeDCube1.html in your project.   The process for creating the other iOS-based mobile applications in this  chapter is identical to the process for the preceding iOS mobile application, so  there is no need to include additional examples. However, it’s worth your while  to spend some time creating additional iOS mobile applications. Not only will  this increase your comfort level, but it will perhaps also motivate you to learn  about other features of Xcode.  Summary  This  chapter  showed  you  how  to  create  hybrid  Android  mobile  applica- tions that contain HTML5, CSS3, and SVG. You created such mobile applica- tions manually, which involved creating Android projects in Eclipse, and then  modifying the contents of the Android Activity class and populating an assets  subdirectory with HTML-related files.  Next,  you  learned  how  to  use  the  PhoneGap  Eclipse  plugin,  which  simplifies  the  process  of  creating  an  Android  project.  You  also  saw  how  the  PhoneGap  plugin  creates  a  default  page  that  allows  you  to  use  “live”  features of your Android device.   ON THE CD-ROM  The CD contains an assortment of code samples, appendices, and figures that  accompany the material in the book.
