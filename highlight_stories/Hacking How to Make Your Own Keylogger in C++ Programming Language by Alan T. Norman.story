Hide	Keylogger	console	window About	The	Author Conclusion   INTRODUCTION  	 Today,	with	the	existence	of	a	program	called	a	Keylogger,	gaining	unauthorized access	to	a	computer	user’s	passwords,	accounts	and	confidential	information has	become	as	easy	as	falling	off	a	log.	You	don’t	necessarily	need	to	have physical	access	to	the	user’s	computer	before	you	are	able	to	monitor	it, sometimes	all	it	takes	is	a	single	click	on	a	link	to	your	program	by	the	user. Anyone	with	basic	knowledge	about	computer	can	use	a	Keylogger.	By	the	time you	are	done	with	this	chapter,	hopefully	you	will	be	able	to	make	your	own Keylogger	through	simple,	well	explained	and	illustrated	steps	I	have	made	for you. WHAT	IS	A	KEYLOGGER? A	Keylogger,	sometimes	called	a	“keystroke	logger”	or	“system	monitor”	is	a computer	program	that	monitors	and	records	every	keystroke	made	by	a computer	user	to	gain	unauthorized	access	to	passwords	and	other	confidential information. MAKING	YOUR	OWN	KEYLOGGER	VS	DOWNLOADING	ONE Why	it’s	better	to	write	your	own	Keylogger	as	opposed	to	just	downloading	it from	the	internet	is	the	reason	of	Anti-virus	detection.	If	you	write	your	own custom	codes	for	a	keylogger	and	keep	the	source	code	to	yourself,	companies that	specialize	in	creating	Anti-virus	will	have	nothing	about	your	Keylogger and	thus,	the	chances	of	cracking	it	will	be	considerably	low. Furthermore,	downloading	a	Keylogger	from	the	Internet	is	tremendously dangerous,	as	you	have	no	idea	what	might	have	been	imbedded	in	the	program. In	other	words,	you	might	have	your	own	system	“monitored”.   REQUIREMENTS	FOR	MAKING	YOUR	OWN	KEYLOGGER In	other	to	make	your	own	Keylogger,	you	will	need	to	have	some	certain packages	ready	to	use.	Some	of	these	packages	include: 1.	A	VIRTUAL	MACHINE When	codes	are	written	and	needed	to	be	tested,	it	is	not	always	advisable	to	run them	directly	on	your	computer.	This	is	because	the	code	might	have	a destructive	nature	and	running	them	could	leave	your	system	damaged.	It	is	in cases	of	testing	written	programs	that	the	utilization	of	a	Virtual	Machine	comes handy. A	virtual	machine	is	a	program	that	has	an	environment	similar	to	the	one	your computer	system	has,	where	programs	that	might	be	destructive	can	be	tested without	causing	the	slightest	harm	to	it,	should	it	be	destructive. You	will	be	right	if	you	say	-	whatever	happens	within	a	virtual	machine	stays within	a	virtual	machine.	A	virtual	machine	can	be	downloaded	easily. 2.	WINDOWS	OPERATING	SYSTEM The	Keylogger	we	will	be	making	will	be	one	that	can	only	infect	a	windows PC.	We	choose	to	make	such	a	Keylogger	because	majority	of	the	desktop	users utilize	a	windows	platform.	However,	besides	that,	making	a	Keylogger	that	can infect	a	windows	system	is	far	easier	compared	to	making	one	that	will	function on	a	Mac	PC.	For	this	reason,	we	begin	with	the	easy	works	and	later	we	can advance	to	the	more	complex	ones	in	my	next	books. 3.	IDE	–	INTEGRATED	DEVELOPMENT	ENVIRONMENT An	IDE	is	a	software	suite	that	consolidates	the	basic	tools	that	developers	need to	write	and	test	software. Typically,	an	IDE	contains	a	code	editor,	a	debugger	and	a	compiler	that	the developer	accesses	through	a	single	graphical	interface	 GUI .	We	will	utilize	an IDE	called	“eclipse”	for	this	project. 4.	COMPILER A	compiler	is	a	special	program	that	processes	statements	written	in	a	particular computer	language	and	converts	them	to	machine	language	or	“code”	that	a computer	processor	can	understand.   Before	we	start	writing	our	Keylogger,	we	will	need	to	set	up	our	environment and	also	learn	some	basic	things	about	C++.	C++	because	most	of	the	codes	for windows	are	written	in	it	and	our	Keylogger	is	targeted	for	windows. You	definitely	want	your	Keylogger	to	have	the	capability	of	running universally	across	all	systems	that	utilize	the	windows	operating	system. Just	so	you	know	before	hand,	C++	is	not	the	next	easiest	programming language	to	learn	because	of	the	nature	of	its	syntax.	Notwithstanding,	don’t	give up	already,	we	will	begin	with	the	simple	things	and	move	on	gradually	to	the more	advanced	ones,	taking	a	comprehensive	step-by-step	approach. I	also	advise	that	you	use	external	materials	on	C++	to	expand	your	knowledge on	the	areas	we	will	touch	during	the	cause	of	this	project	as	this	will	enhance your	productivity. Hopefully,	by	the	end	of	this	chapter	you	will	be	able	to	make	your	own Keylogger	and	also	modify	it	to	suit	your	purposes.   SETTING	UP	THE	ENVIRONMENT  	 Just	like	we	need	to	set	our	computer	systems	up	before	we	get	working	with them,	in	the	same	light	we	also	need	to	setup	an	environment	which	will	enable us	code	in	C++	and	in	the	final	account	of	things,	make	a	Keylogger. The	first	thing	we	will	need	is	an	Integrated	Development	Environment	 IDE  and	as	stated	earlier,	we	will	be	using	Eclipse.	The	IDE	of	our	choice	 Eclipse 	is java	based	and	so	we	need	to	visit	the	Java	website	 www.eclipse.org 	to download	it.  When	we	get	on	the	Java	site,	we	will	discover	that	there	are	numerous	options of	eclipse	programs	that	are	available	for	download.	However,	since	we	intend	to use	the	C++	programing	language	we	download	“Eclipse	for	C C++	developers" still	having	at	the	back	of	our	minds	that	we	are	working	on	a	windows	platform. Hence,	while	there	are	Eclipse	versions	for	Linux,	Solaris,	Mac	systems	and others	we	will	download	Eclipse	for	the	Windows	platform.   We	also	need	to	choose	between	the	32	or	64-bit	operating	system	option, depending	on	the	one	your	computer	runs	on.	You	can	easily	check	which	your system	runs	on	by	right	clicking	on	“PC”	or	“My	computer”	and	then	on properties.	This	steps	lead	to	the	display	of	your	system	specifications.	After	the determination	of	the	bits	your	system	runs	on,	go	ahead	and	download	the Eclipse	file	that	is	compatible	with	it. When	the	download	is	complete,	the	downloaded	file	will	be	in	your	download folder	by	default	unless	you	made	changes	locate	it.	We	will	be	required	to	unzip the	file,	as	it	will	be	zipped. After	the	unzipping	and	installation	of	the	Eclipse	file,	an	attempt	to	run	it	will result	in	the	display	of	an	error	message	stating	that	Eclipse	cannot	work	without a	Java	Run	time	Environment	 JRE 	or	a	Java	Development	Kit	 JDK .	This	is no	problem	at	all,	as	all	we	need	do	is	return	to	the	Internet	and	download	a JDK.	The	latest	versions	of	the	JDK	usually	come	with	the	JRE. We	can	simply	Google	“Java	development	kit”	and	click	on	a	link	leading	to	the Oracle	website	where	we	can	make	the	required	download.   On	the	site,	we	have	got	the	JDK	program	for	a	lot	of	different	operating	systems and	for	different	system	bits	ranging	from	JDK	for	Linux	system	to	JDK	for	Mac OS	Solaris	and	more.	However,	as	we	know,	we	are	interested	in	a	JDK	for	the windows	OS.	So	we	go	right	ahead	and	download	it	making	sure	it	fits	our system	bits	 32	or	64 .  We	will	be	required	to	accept	the	Oracle	Binary	Code	License	agreement	by clicking	on	the	box	provided	before	we	can	begin	the	download.	We	do	this	and go	ahead	with	the	download	and	installation	of	the	JDK. Now,	unlike	most	programs	we	download,	we	have	to	set	environment	variables path.	We	do	this	for	the	JDK	because	it	does	not	automatically	set	its	path	like most	other	programs	do.	The	implication	of	an	unset	variable	path	is	that:	each time	we	want	to	run	such	a	file	 with	unset	variable	path ,	we	have	to	specify	the full	path	to	the	executable	file	such	as: 	C:\Program	Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin\javac”Myclass.java.	This	could	be	really tedious	and	also	lead	to	lots	of	errors. For	instance	Eclipse	requires	JDK	to	run,	but	if	the	JDK	path	is	not	set,	Eclipse will	be	unable	to	locate	it	and	thus	will	not	be	able	to	run	unless	the	path manually	inputted.	Setting	path	simply	means	setting	an	address	to	make	the location	of	the	program	possible. SETTING	THE	JDK	PATH  1.															Navigate	to	file	explorer	 shortcut:	windows	+	E ,	right-click	on “PC”	or	“My	computer,”	from	the	drop	down	menu	that	is	displayed,	click   on	“Properties.” 2.															Click	on	advanced	settings	and	then	from	the	pop-up	menu	that appears,	click	on	“environment	variables”	then	navigate	down	to	system variables	and	select	one	at	random.  3.															Press	“P”	on	your	keyboard	and	you	will	be	redirected	to	“Path.” Now	let’s	go	ahead	and	edit	it.	The	default	path	will	begin	like	so: %systemRoot%...	As	it	is	shown	in	a	more	complete	form	in	the	figure below.	 The	address	was	only	shown	in	notepad	for	enlargement	purposes, you	need	not	place	the	path	in	notepad	too. 	We	are	going	to	make	an addition	to	the	default	path.  4.															Add	C:\mingw\binbin;	to	the	already	existing	address,	so	it	looks just	the	way	it	is	in	the	figure	below.	Avoid	making	any	other	change	in	the   path,	else	an	error	message	will	be	encountered	on	attempt	to	run	Eclipse.  5.															Click	on	“OK”	as	many	times	as	you	are	prompted	to	and	finally, click	on	apply	and	the	JDK	path	is	set.  True,	we	have	made	a	couple	of	downloads	and	we	should	jump	right	into	the meat	of	the	matter:	making	our	Keylogger	but	wait	just	a	minute,	are	we	not forgetting	something?	Of	course	we	are! We	have	a	Virtual	Machine	where	all	operations	regarding	our	Keylogger	will be	carried	out.	We	have	Eclipse	where	all	our	code	writing	will	be	done,	we	also have	the	JDK	which	will	enable	us	run	Eclipse	on	our	system.	What	we	lack	is	a compiler	which	will	translate	our	C++	written	codes	to	machine	language	which is	understandable	to	our	computer	systems. Without	wasting	time,	we	can	download	our	compiler	from	www.mingw.org even	though	there	are	still	other	sites	we	can	make	downloads	from.	However, MinGW	is	straightforward.  Hit	the	download	button	at	the	top	right	hand	corner	to	start	downloading	the compiler.	Again,	the	compiler	is	going	to	be	in	a	zipped	format	and	like	we	did for	the	JDK	we	downloaded	previously,	unzip	it	by	extracting	its	content	to	any location	of	your	choice.	Finally,	install	the	compiler. Now,	with	the	variable	path	set,	the	JDK	and	a	compiler	installed,	we	can comfortably	lunch	the	eclipse	environment	without	getting	any	error	messages and	write	our	codes	with	certainty	that	they	will	be	interpreted	to	our	computer and	will	be	executed	too.   SETTING	THE	ECLIPSE	ENVIRONMENT:  On	lunching	Eclipse,	greetings	with	a	welcome	screen	that	will	offer	a	tour around	the	eclipse	environment	will	be	displayed.	If	you	happen	to	be	one	that loves	practical	guides,	you	could	go	on	with	it,	else	close	it.	Immediately	after the	greeting	note,	Eclipse	displays	a	small	default	program,	which	will	print “hello	world”	when,	compiled.	Do	not	worry	about	how	complex	these	codes might	seem	at	first	glance,	as	we	progress	things	will	unwrap	and	you	will	see that	coding	is	just	piece	of	cake	waiting	to	be	eaten.  *The	lines	in	purple,	blue	and	green	texts	are	called	“Codes.”	We	will	be	playing around	with	them	in	no	time.   STEPS	TO	SETUP	THE	ENVIRONMENT	FOR	CODING:  1.															Close	the	default	program.	We	can	achieve	this	by	clicking	on	the projects	‘x’	button	at	the	left	hand	side	of	the	screen. 2.															Click	on	“File”	in	the	upper	left	corner,	select	“New”	and	then	C++ project	because	we	want	to	create	a	C++	environment. 3.															Give	the	project	you	want	to	create	a	befitting	name	e.g.	Keylogger, Calculator,	Mary	Jane,	anything. 4.															Under	“Project	type”	select	“Empty	project.”	Select	“MinGW GCC”	 which	is	the	compiler	we	downloaded 	under	“Toolchains.”	Click on	“Next”	to	proceed	with	author	and	copyright	settings	or	click	“Finish”	to go	to	Eclipse	code	editor	directly.  …and	we	are	done	with	things	in	that	category.	Now,	just	like	we	did	for	the JDK,	we	need	to	go	ahead	and	set	some	paths	right	here. LISTED	BELOW	ARE	THE	STEPS:  1.															Go	to	your	project	name,	right-click	on	it	and	from	the	drop-down menu	that	appears	scroll	down	and	click	“Properties”. 2.															Expand	the	C C++	build	and	from	the	drop	down	menu,	click	on “Environment.”  	  3.															Under	“Environment	path	to	select,”	click	on	“Path”	and	click	on “Edit.”	The	default	path	displayed	is	long,	cumbersome	and	tedious however,	we	only	need	to	add	a	small	path	variable	to	its	beginning.   4.															Remember	the	path	we	copied	out	when	we	were	setting	our	JDK path	variable?  C:\mingw\binbin;	paste	it	at	the	beginning	of	the	eclipse	path	variable	so	it looks	like	it	does	in	the	figure	below:  5.															Click	on	“Apply”  We	have	just	one	more	thing	to	do	and	we	are	done	with	setting	up	eclipse.	This is	setting	the	binary	parser.  1.															Click	on	“File”	and	from	the	drop	down	menu	that	appears,	click	on “Properties,”		“C++	Build”	and	then	go	into	settings. 2.															Under	“Settings“	Click	on	“Binary	Parser.”	Make	sure	that	the	PE   Windows	parser	is	ticked. 3.															Click	on	“Ok”	and	that’s	all	about	the	settings.  HOW	TO	RUN	WRITTEN	CODES Now	that	your	environment	is	set	your	coding	can	begin.	However	it	does	not	all end	at	just	writing	many	and	many	lines	of	codes,	running	them	is	important. Running	written	codes	at	intervals	is	important	as	it	enables	the	coder	know	if what	he	is	writing	is	coming	out	the	way	he	wants	it.	You	run	your	codes	as	you write	so	you	know	the	outcome	of	what	you	have	written	and	if	there	any changes	you	will	like	to	make.	Here	are	simple	steps	to	running	your	written codes:  1.															At	the	upper	left	corner	of	the	eclipse	environment,	there	is	a hammer	symbol.	The	hammer	signifies	“Build.”	Without	building	the written	code,	it	will	not	run.	Click	on	it	 Shortcut:	Ctrl	B 	to	build	your code. 2.															There	is	a	big	green	“Play”	button	at	the	top	middle	portion	of	your screen,	click	on	it	to	run	your	written	program.	The	button	signifies	“Run,” click	on	it	and	your	program	will	run.	That’s	it,	simple	as	ABC.   PROGRAMMING	BASICS	 CRASH	COURSE	ON	C++   	 True,	we	are	concerned	with	making	a	Keylogger	and	you	must	be	wondering why	we	are	still	beating	around	the	bush.	Thing	is,	it	is	really	necessary	that	we equip	ourselves	with	basic	knowledge	of	the	environments	we	will	work	in	and the	tools	we	will	use. C++	is	the	programming	language	we	have	decided	to	use	and	so	we	will	go through	basic	areas	of	this	language	which	will	give	us	a	sense	of	direction	of where	we	are	headed	 making	a	Keylogger. 	later	on,	as	we	progress	we	will learn	more	and	more	and	more	of	this	language.   TERMS  Variable.	A	variable	is	a	location	in	memory	where	a	value	can	be	stored for	use	by	a	program.	An	analogy	is	the	post	office	boxes	where	each	box	has	an address	 post	office	box	number .	When	the	box	is	opened,	the	content	will	be retrieved.	Similarly,	each	memory	location	has	an	address	and	when	that	is invoked,	the	content	can	be	retrieved. Identifier.	An	identifier	is	a	sequence	of	characters	taken	from	the	C++ character	set.	 	Each	variable	needs	an	identifier	that	distinguishes	it	from	another.	For	instance, given	a	variable	a,	‘a’	is	the	identifier	and	the	value	is	the	content.	An	identifier can	consist	of	alphabets,	digits	and	 	or	underscores.  														It	must	not	start	with	a	digit 														C++	is	case	sensitive;	that	is	upper	case	and	lower	case	letters	are considered	different	from	each	other.	For	example	boy	!=	BOY	 where	!= means	not	equal	to   														It	must	not	be	a	reserved	word  Reserved	words.	A	reserved	word	or	keyword	is	a	word	that	has	special meaning	to	the	C++	compiler.	Some	C++	keywords	are:	double,	asm,	break, operator,	static,	void,	etc. To	declare	a	variable,	it	must	be	first	given	a	name	and	type	of	data	to	hold.	For example: Int	a;	where	‘a’	is	an	identifier	and	is	of	type	integer. There	are	several	C++	data	types	and	each	of	these	data	types	have	their functions.	Listed	below	are	the	various	data	types:  														Int:	These	are	small	whole	numbers	e.g. 														Long	int:	Large	whole	numbers 														Float:	small	real	numbers 														Double:	Theses	are	numbers	with	decimal	points,	e.g.	20.3,	0.45 														Long	double:	Very	large	real	numbers 														Char:	A	single	character 														Bool:	Boolean	value.	It	can	take	one	of	two	values:	true	or	false   UNDERSTANDING	CODE	STATEMENTS  When	we	first	launched	Eclipse	and	were	welcomed	with	a	greeting	note,	we saw	a	default	program	shortly	after	which	if	we	ran	using	the	steps	we	learnt earlier	would	have	displayed	“Hello	World.”	Let	us	go	through	the	functions	of those	codes	that	were	written	in	green,	purple	and	red	in	that	default	program  and	how	they	operate.  														include:	The	statement	include	is	a	call	for	statements	from	a  library	to	be	included	in	the	program	being	written.	A	library	can	be	said	to be	a	room	which	houses	a	lot	of	pre-written	codes	that	we	can	utilize	at	any time.	It	saves	us	the	stress	of	having	to	write	every	single	thing	we	might need	while	coding.  														 	:	This	is	a	library	file	which	contains	some	certain functions	which	will	enable	us	utilize	some	certain	commands.	Some	of these	commands	include:	Cout	and	Cin.  														Cout:	This	is	a	command	that	displays	the	outcome	of	written	codes  to	the	computer	user.	For	example,	if	you	write	codes	for	a	program	that will	ask	a	user	questions,	the	Cout	statement	is	what	will	make	the questions	visible	to	the	user.  														Cin:	This	statement	is	a	command	which	is	used	to	receive	input  from	a	user.	For	instance	if	you	write	a	program	that	collects	the	biometrics of	different	people,	the	Cin	command	is	what	will	enable	your	program take	in	the	information	the	computer	user	will	key	in.  A	good	example	explaining	both	the	Cin	and	Cout	statement	is	a	calculator.	CIn allows	the	calculator	to	take	in	your	inputs	and	Cout	lets	it	display	an	answer	to you.  														  :	The	double	slash	is	a	comment	line.	This	means	that	the  particular	line	it	precedes	will	not	be	taking	into	consideration.	It	is	used	by the	code	writer	to	explain	what	a	particular	line	of	code	does	either	for	his   remembrance	or	for	other	programmers	that	might	work	with	his	code.	We also	have	a	multi-line	comment.	A	multi-line	comment	has	a	single	slash and	an	asterisk	sign	together	  * .	It	functions	just	like	a	single	line comment	except	that	the	statement	being	written	can	exceed	a	single	line.  EXAMPLES	OF: A	single	line	comment:	  Life	is	not	a	bed	of	roses. Multi-line	comment:	 *Roses	are	red	violets	are	blue, most	poems	rhyme	but	this	one	doesn’t.*\   A	TYPICAL	PROGRAM  The	diagram	below	shows	a	simple	program	which	is	designed	to	ask	the computer	user	to	input	two	separate	values	which	it	prints	out.	Let’s	go	through the	lines	of	this	code	step-by-step	understanding	what	each	means.  Line	1:	This	line	contains	include	 .	It	is	what	begins	this	program. The	include	statement	calls	the	Cin	and	Cout	commands	out	of	the	library  .	Without	this	line,	the	program	will	neither	take	in	nor	display	any input. Line	2:	“Using	namespace”	is	a	command,	and	“std”	which	stands	for	‘standard’ is	a	library. When	you	write	“Using	namespace	std”	you	are	bringing	everything	from	that library	into	your	class,	but	it	is	not	quite	like	using	the	include	command. Namespace	in	C++	is	a	way	to	put	word	in	a	scope,	and	any	word	that	is	outside of	that	scope	cannot	see	the	code	inside	the	namespace.	In	order	for	the	code	that is	outside	of	a	namespace	to	see	code	that	is	INSIDE	of	a	namespace,	you	must use	the	“Using	namespace”	command. Line	4:	On	this	line,	the	main  	is	a	function	and	“int”	specifies	the	type	of values	that	the	function	will	be	dealing	with	 integers. 	A	function	in	C++	is	a group	of	statements	that	together	forms	a	task.	This	is	the	first	function	always	in C++	and	it	must	always	be	written. Lines	5	&	14:	The	curly	braces	on	line	5	and	14	indicate	the	start	and	end	of	a compound	statement.   Line	6:	Here,	two	variables	are	allocated,	variable	‘a’	and	variable	‘b’.	As	stated earlier,	a	variable	is	a	location	assigned	to	the	RAM	used	to	store	data. Therefore,	two	memory	allocations	are	made	to	store	integers.	Variable	‘a’	was assigned	a	value	of	10	and	variable	‘b’	a	value	20.	This	process	is	called initialization,	i.e.	setting	an	initial	value	so	even	without	input	by	a	user	there	is	a starting	value. Line	7:	On	this	line	initialization	was	made.	The	variable	of	type	double	was initialized	just	as	the	variable	of	type	integer	was	initialized. Line	9:	On	this	line	the	print	out	statement	Cout	is	utilized.	It	prints	the statement	“Enter	the	values	for	“a	and	b”	though	without	the	quotation	marks. Only	statements	within	the	quotation	marks	get	printed.	Note	that	the	a	and	b written	in	the	statement	“Enter	the	values	for	a	and	b”	will	not	display	the	value contained	in	the	variable	‘a’	it	will	only	display	it	as	the	letter	of	an	alphabet because	it	lies	within	the	quotation	marks. At	the	end	of	this	line,	we	have	a	reserved	word	endL.	The	endL	word	causes every	statement	that	comes	after	it	to	begin	on	a	new	line. Line	10:	This	line	contains	the	Cin	>>	statement.	The	Cin	statement	prompts	the user	to	input	a	value	for	both	a	and	b.	Without	the	computer	user	making	such input,	the	program	will	not	progress. Line	11:	When	observed,	in	the	statement	Cout		<<		“	Value	of	a:	”	it	can	be seen	that	after	the	column	 ushering	in	the	expected	input	of	the	user 	there	is	a space	before	the	quotation	mark	which	ends	the	statement.	These	spaces	will make	the	output	look	as	shown	below	when	the	program	is	set	to	run. 																				Value	of	a:	50 However,	without	this	space,	the	output	will	take	this	form: 																			Value	of	a:50 Meanwhile,	the	stand	alone	‘a’	is	what	will	display	the	value	inputted	by	the user.	The	endL	at	the	center	of	both	statements	takes	“Value	of	b:	”	to	the	next line	on	display	when	the	program	is	set	to	run. Line	13:	The	return	0;	statement	enables	the	main	function	to	return	an	integer   data	type.	Technically,	in	C	or	C++,	main	function	has	to	return	a	value	because it	is	declared	as	“int	main”.	If	main	is	declared	like	“void	main”,	then	there’s	no need	of	return	0. Next	up,	we	have	a	couple	of	operators,	which	enable	us	carry	out	some operations.	Some	of	these	operators	include	–	the	math	operator,	comparison operator, The	math	operator:	Like	the	name	implies,	it	enables	us	carry	out	mathematical operations.	The	math	operators	we	have	in	the	real	world	are	the	very	same	ones we	have	here.	They	are: Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division	& Modulus  The	modulus	is	the	number	that	remains	when	you	divide	two	numbers. Example,	when	you	divide	5	by	2,	the	result	will	be	2	with	a	remainder	of	1.	The remainder	1	is	the	modulus. We	also	have	Comparison	operators	and	they	are:  														The	equal	–	equal	operator	==	:	It	is	worthy	of	note	that	the  double	equal	sign	operator	 	==	 	doesn’t	function	like	the	single	equal	sign operator	 	=	 .	While	the	single	equal	sign	operator	is	used	for	assigning values	to	a	variable,	the	double	sign	operator	compares	the	values	between two	variables	especially	when	used	with	a	conditional	statement	  *conditional	statements	will	be	treated	later .	  	  For	instance,	writing	a	=	b	will	assign	whatever	values	in	b	to	a 																																								While Writing	something	like	if		a	==	b	…	 	where	“if”	is	a	conditional	statement 	will confirm	if	the	value	contained	in	b	is	same	as	that	in	a.	And	if	it	is,	a	particular operation	specified	by	the	code	writer	will	be	executed. Not-equal-to	operator		!=	:	This	operator	as	the	name	implies	that	the	two	or more	variables	in	comparison	are	not	equal.	For	instance,	a	!=	b	implies	that	the values	in	the	variables	a	and	b	are	different.   The	and-and	operator	&&:	This	represents	the	word	and.	So,	if	you	have	for example: 																																														a	!=	c	&&	b	==	a It	can	be	read	as	a	condition	which	reads	as	“	a	is	not	equal	to	c	AND	b	equals a.” The	OR	operator		Just	like	the	regular	OR	word	we	use	everyday,	the	one	here in	C++	means	the	same. 																																						a	!=	c		b	==	a The	statement	above	simply	reads:	“a	is	not	equal	to	c		OR	b	equals	a” Now,	let	us	walk	through	actual	lines	of	code	where	the	comparison	statements are	used	together	with	some	conditional	statement.  Do	you	see	the	logic	of	the	code	above	already? Basically,	Line	9	is	stating	that	if	the	value	contained	in	the	variable	a	is	same	as that	contained	in	b	and	the	value	in	c	is	not	equal	to	that	in	b	then	the	statement “I	will	not	sleep”	written	on	Line	11	will	be	displayed.	However,	if	any	of	these conditions	happen	to	be	false	 for	instance	a	does	not	equal	b	or	c	equals	d 	then the	statement	on	line	15	which	reads	“I	will	fight	against	sleep”	will	be	printed. The	else	written	on	Line	15	is	a	conditional	statement,	which	just	like	it	does	in the	real	world	means	that	if	the	condition	on	Line	9	evaluates	to	false	then	the statement	on	Line	11	be	skipped	and	another	condition	down	the	line	be considered.   If	the	OR	statement	was	used	in	place	of	the	else	statement,	it	will	imply	that only	one	of	the	conditions	on	Line	9	will	have	to	be	true	 either	the	value	in	a	== b	or	c	!=	d 	for	the	statement	on	Line	11	to	be	considered	and	that	on	Line	15	to be	ignored. Going	through	series	and	series	of	codes	for	different	programs	will	enhance understanding	and	on	the	long	run	get	you	used	to	the	operators,	their	various functions	and	how	they	can	be	used. By	adding	some	new	statements	to	our	previously	analyzed	program	and explaining	them	step	by	step	our	understanding	of	coding	in	C++	will	improve greatly.	When	this	is	achieved,	walking	through	the	process	of	making	a Keylogger	will	cause	you	no	sweat. Let	us	analyze	the	following	programs	below:				  The	code	from	Line	1	to	7	is	familiar	codes	and	hence,	they	have	been	omitted. In	Line	9	and	11,	the	Cout	function	is	used	and	the	statement	“Enter	value	for	a: ”	and	“Enter	value	for	b:	”	will	be	printed	out	 note	the	space	at	the	end	of	both sentences,	between	colon	and	the	quotation	mark	that	ends	the	statements. Remember	its	purpose .	On	Line	10	and	12,	the	Cin	functions	which	will	require the	computer	user	to	input	a	value,	is	utilized.	Once	both	values	requested	of	the user	by	the	program	are	entered,	the	program	does	evaluation	based	on	the conditional	statements	on	Line	14	and	if	the	result	is	true,	the	program	prints	as directed	by	Line16	“A	is	greater	than	B”.   On	Line	18,	the	conditional	statement	else	if	is	a	type	of	conditional	statement used	in	between	the	if	and	else	statements.	It	is	used	to	add	several	other conditions	which	if	all	evaluated	to	false,	will	result	to	the	printing	of	line	under the	else	statement.	As	utilized	in	this	program,	if	the	condition	a	>	b	is	false,	the line	under	the	else	statement	–A	is	less	than	B-	will	be	printed	except	the	else	if condition	is	true	then	“A	is	equal	to	B”	will	be	printed.  As	observed	from	the	codes	written	above,	the	user	inputted	the	value	1	for	the variable	a	and	3	for	the	variable	b.	These	values	do	not	meet	the	condition	on Line	14,	neither	do	they	meet	that	on	Line	18	and	so	the	else	statement	is considered.	The	statement	on	Line	24	“A	is	less	than	B	is	printed.”   LOOPS  A	loop	in	C++	can	be	said	to	be	a	circular	path	through	which	conditional statements	being	evaluated	continue	on	in	circles	never	to	stop	until	the	required condition	is	met	or	an	escape	route	is	provided.	Let	us	analyze	a	program	which loops	are	used.	There	are	several	loops	such	as	the	While	loop,	the	For	loop, the														.Let	us	begin	with	the	While	loop.  It	can	be	seen	that	the	while	statement	is	placed	just	before	the	lines	of	code	in which	repetitive	evaluation	is	required,	the	user	input	inclusive	 Cin	and	Cout statements .	After	the	while,	there	is	always	a	parenthesis	which	holds	things such	as	true,	false,	1	or	0.	The	number	1	can	be	replaced	with	true	like	0	with false.	The	loop	can	be	set	to	run	continuously	without	stopping	or	set	to	a number	of	times	to	run	before	stopping. Like	you	know,	Line	12	and	14	are	just	statements	that	will	be	printed	out	and Line	13	and	14	will	ask	the	user	to	input	values	repetitively	 Loop 	.	From	Line 17	down	to	23	lies	the	conditional	statement	to	be	evaluated.	On	Line	25	both variable	a	and	b	are	assigned	a	value	-1.	Now	supposing	all	other	conditions evaluate	to	false	the	program	will	continue	to	run	until	the	condition	on	Line	25 evaluates	to	true	 a	==	-1		b	==	-1 	i.e.	the	user	inputs	a	value	of	-1	then	the instruction	on	Line	26	will	be	carried	out	i.e.	the	loop	will	break	and	the statement	on	Line	29	will	be	printed. However,	the	way	we	went	about	our	conditional	statement	for	the	loop	to	be terminated	is	not	so	efficient.	This	is	so	because	if	the	user	inputs	a	value	of	-1   for	a	as	Line	13	requires,	the	loop	will	not	break	but	the	user	will	be	asked	again for	an	input	for	the	variable	b.	Only	when	both	a	and	b	are	assigned	a	value	of	-1 will	the	loop	be	broken. Let	us	look	at	a	more	efficient	way	of	utilizing	our	conditional	statements	and break	statement	so	that	when	the	user	inputs	a	-1	value	for	either	of	both variables,	the	loop	will	terminate.  As	seen	in	the	figure	above,	the	if	statement	 that	leads	to	the	break	out	of	the loop 	and	the	break	statement	are	brought	directly	under	Line	13	that	asks	for user	input	so	that	upon	the	input	of	a	value	-1	by	the	user,	the	loop	will	be broken	and	the	else	statement	printed.	In	a	situation	where	a	value	aside	from	-1 is	inputted,	the	statement	on	Line	12	will	be	printed	out	after	which	Line	13	will request	an	input	from	the	user	for	variable	b.	Again	if	a	value	other	than	-1	is inputted	for	variable	b,	the	rest	of	the	conditional	statements	below	will	be evaluated	and	a	corresponding	result	will	be	printed	out:  Furthermore,	it	is	important	you	know	that	knowing	how	to	arrange	your	lines	of code	so	they	produce	a	particular	output	is	not	woven	around	C++.	It	requires   just	basic	logic.	All	you	need	know	is	the	different	statements,	what	they	are used	for	and	how	they	can	be	used.	The	way	they	are	to	be	arranged	to	carry	out a	specific	function	can	be	wholly	your	idea. Next	we	will	be	doing	the	For	loop.	However,	before	we	go	into	that,	let	us	see how	increments	work.  Everything	from	our	previous	program	so	far	stays	the	same,	however	on	Line	9, there	is	a	variable	i	that	is	initialized	i.e.	set	to	0.		This	variable	i	is	created	so	it could	be	used	within	the	while	loop	to	set	the	number	of	times	the	program within	the	loop	will	run	before	terminating. 																														While 	i	<=	3	 	on	line	10	is	a	condition	which	instructs	the program	to	keep	on	running	while	the	value	of	i	is	less	than	3	but	stop	once	i	has becomes	3	i.e.	the	program	will	run	three	times.   On	Line	35,	the	i++	is	an	increment	statement,	which	simply	implies	that	the value	1	should	be	added	to	i	each	time	a	loop	is	completed.	It	can	also	be	written as:	i	=	i	+	1	however,	i++	is	short	and	is	what	most	people	use. <<	i	has	been	added	at	the	end	of	every	conditional	statement	so	the	number	of completed	cycles	will	be	displayed	after	each	loop. FOR	LOOP: The	For	carries	out	basically	the	same	function	as	the	While	loop.	They	are alike	in	the	sense	that	both	make	a	program	run	in	iterations.	However,	a difference	between	them	both	is	in	the	way	they	are	utilized	in	the	program.  It	can	be	seen	from	the	figure	above,	how	the	for	loop	is	written.	For 	int		i	=	0; i	<	3;	i++ 	simply	means	that	the	variable	i	is	assigned	to	hold	data	of	type variable	and	is	initialized	to	zero.	i	<	3;	i++	instructs	the	program	to	run continuously	 keeping	count	of	the	number	of	completed	loops 	until	i	is	1	value less	than	3	i.e.	The	program	will	run	only	two	times.	Also,	it	is	worthy	of	note that	since	the	increment	is	made	within	the	parenthesis	after	the	for	loop,	the increment	will	only	function	for	the	program	within	that	block	 Line	10	to	25 . UTILIZING	THE	MATH	OPERATORS As	stated	earlier,	the	math	operators	here	in	the	world	of	C++	are	no	different than	those	in	the	real	world.	Let	us	see	how	these	operators	can	be	used, especially	with	other	data	types	such	as	float	and	double	as	we	have	been	so	far been	playing	with	integers	only.	We	will	also	see	why	certain	data	types	   cannot	hold	some	values,  decimal	or	integers. On	Line	6,	7	and	8	of	the	program	above,	values	are	assigned	to	the	variables	of type:	int,	double,	and	float	alike.	These	values	assigned	fit	the	variable	types. A	simple	division	operation	is	carried	out	on	Line	10,	which	is	a b.	when	the program	is	run,	the	value	2	is	printed	out	as	the	answer.	You	might	begin	to wonder	if	the	entire	math	in	the	world	is	wrong	because	Mr.	Computer	never makes	mistakes.	However,	you	got	it	right	and	Mr.	Computer	was	wrong	this once!	The	answer	evaluated	to	2	because	the	variables	a	and	b	are	of	the	type integer	and	integers	cannot	hold	decimal	values	so	it	prints	put	only	the	whole part.   If	variables	a	and	b	were	of	type	float	or	double,	the	result	would	have	been printed	in	full,	i.e.	both	the	whole	and	decimal	part	as	shown	in	the	figure	below, In	the	program	above	on	Line	10,	a	division	operation	similar	to	the	previous one	is	carried	out.	However	in	this	particular	operation	the	values	were	assigned variable	of	type	double	 	c	=	10.3,	d	=	60.234	 .	It	can	be	seen	that	upon	running the	program,	the	answer	printed	out	is	0.171.	The	answer	comes	with	its	decimal part	because	of	the	variable	type	assigned	 double . So	far	we	have	been	treating	the	basics	of	C++	and	it	is	expected	that	by	now, you	are	able	to	write	a	simple	program,	perhaps	a	“Hello	world”	program. However	if	there	are	certain	things	you	still	do	not	understand	or	don’t	really	get a	hold	of,	do	not	panic	for	as	we	progress	with	the	coding,	you	will	definitely	get along. FUNCTIONS:	Functions	are	groups	of	codes	brought	together	as	a	single	body to	carry	out	a	specific	function.	The	functions	we	speak	of	here	are	similar	to	the normal	main	function	we	usually	write	at	the	beginning	of	our	code	however, they	come	under	the	main	function.	We	can	also	create	functions	outside	of	the main	and	later	call	them	within	the	main. We	need	functions	because	we	need	to	group	certain	blocks	or	family	designed to	carry	out	specific	functions.	For	instance	suppose	we	need	a	function	to	add, subtract	and	divide	a	set	of	numbers,	writing	codes	to	carry	out	this	arithmetic operation	severally	will	be	really	difficult.	However,	a	function	capable	of   carrying	out	the	required	arithmetic	operation	can	be	written	and	called	within the	main	function	each	time	it	is	required.  Let	us	go	through	practical  examples	to	make	the	creation	and	use	of	functions	a	lot	clearer. Generally,	in	the	program	above,	a	function	sum	is	created	to	cause	the	addition of	two	variables	a	and	b.	This	function	will	on	the	long	run	make	our	work easier.	For	instance,	anywhere	within	the	program	where	a	similar	math operation	is	required,	all	that	needs	to	be	done	is	to	call	the	function. On	line	5,a	function	sum	is	created	to	accept	and	process	input	of	type	variable. Within	the	parenthesis,	the	function	sum,	has	two	variables	a	and	b	declared.	On line	8,	the	main	variable	is	declared	also	and	within	it,	the	specific	jobs	for	the function	to	carry	out	is	defined. “The	sum	of	3	and	5	is:	”	written	on	Line	10	like	you	know,	is	just	a	statement that	will	be	printed	out.	However,	at	the	end	of	this	Line,	the	function	sum	is called	and	the	variables	a	and	b	are	set	to	3	and	5	respectively.	On	Line	14,	the function,	which	was	created	outside	the	main	function,	is	brought	into	it.	Finally, on	Line	16	a	math	operation	meant	to	cause	the	sum	of	a	and	b	is	written.	On running	the	program,	the	sum	of	the	variables	a	and	b	 3,5 	displays	the	result	8. That	done,	let	us	analyze	a	similar	program	with	some	new	things	in	it.   There	are	several	new	things	here,	basically	the	getline	statement	on	Line	13. For	now	let	us	just	take	the	syntax	for	how	we	see	it	as	it	has	got	a	whole background	to	its	own	and	will	lead	us	off	our	tracks	if	we	run	after	it.	We	will learn	more	and	more	about	it	as	we	progress. There	is	also	the	string	variable	type	as	seen	on	Line	22.	The	String	variable type	is	used	to	contain	spaces	and	lots	and	lots	of	letters.	In	fact,	most	all	the statements	we	have	printed	to	the	display	window	so	far	in	this	course	can	be held	by	string.  Just	so	we	know,	the	little	figure	above	was	just	written	to	introduce	a	new variable	type,	which	we	will	definitely	use	later	on.	The	variable	type	is	char. This	variable	type	holds	characters	such	as	a	dollar	sign,	a	single	letter	like	the one	on	Line	13	above	etc.	It	is	usually	utilized	with	single	quotation	marks. Finally,	let	us	go	into	pointers	and	files,	after	which	we	will	start	writing	our codes	for	a	Keylogger.   POINTERS	AND	FILES  POINTERS:  	Basically,	a	pointer	in	not	just	C++	but	in	other	programming	languages	is	used in	showing	the	memory	locations	of	variables.	Let	us	analyze	the	little	program above	to	help	us	understand	how	pointers	are	used. Codes	from	Line	1	to	6	serve	the	same	purpose	they	have	always	served	in previous	codes	we	have	written.	A	variable	num	of	type	int	is	declared	on	Line 9.	Since	a	pointer	discloses	the	memory	location	of	a	variable,	there	has	to	be	a variable	whose	location	declared.	On	Line	10,	the	pointer	is	declared.	This	is done	by	using	a	variable	type,	same	as	that	of	the	variable,	whose	location	is	to be	established,	followed	by	an	asterisk	and	finally	the	name	of	the	pointer.	The pointer	can	have	any	name,	ptr	was	used	in	above	program. Now,	one	Line	9,	the	pointer	is	told	to	point	to	the	variable	num.	This	is	done	by typing	the	name	of	the	pointer	 ptr 	and	equating	it	to	an	ampersand	sign	 &  and	the	variable	name	 num 	with	no	space	in-between.	On	line	13,	a	COut statement	is	written	to	output	num	 which	we	set	earlier	to	a	value	of	10 	and ptr,	which	will	display	the	memory	location	of	num.	As	seen	in	the	figure above,	on	running	the	code,	it	displays	the	value	contained	in	num	 10 	together   with	the	memory	location	of	the	variable	 0x28ff18 . Note	that	on	Line	13,	if	we	wanted	the	pointer	to	print	to	console	the	value contained	in	the	variable,	we	could	simply	have	put	an	asterisk	before	ptr	as shown	in	the	figure	below.   FILES:  We	might	be	asking	ourselves	why	on	earth	we	need	Files.	Well,	if	we	are	going to	need	a	Keylogger,	we	are	going	to	need	to	know	how	to	use	files	because	if you	have	a	Keylogger	on	somebody’s	system,	we	will	be	storing	the	keystrokes of	the	user	in	the	files.	If	the	user	types	ABC,	it	should	be	written	to	a	file somewhere. We	need	to	know	how	to	write	to	a	file	using	nothing	else	but	C++.	It	is	a	very simple	process	that	is	not	complicated	in	any	way.	In	fact	it	is	very	similar	to Cout	and	Cin.	All	we	need	do	is:  														Type	in	include	 	just	under	the	include 	so  that	we	will	be	able	to	write	to	a	file.  														Create	an	output	stream	just	like	on	Line	8	and	give	it	a	name.	The output	stream	is	created	by	just	writing	ofstream	and	adding	any	name	of your	choice	to	it.	On	Line	8,	the	output	stream’s	name	is	write.		Note	that paths	will	have	to	be	specified	else,	it	will	be	in	your	project	folder.  To	locate	the	default	path,	click	on	“PC”	or	“My	Computer”	depending	on	how it	is	on	your	system,	on	“Local	Disk”	and	then	on	“Users.”	Click	on	the	user name	of	the	User	you	are	using	at	the	moment.  														Locate	“Work	space”	and	click	on	it  	   	 Within	“Workspace,”	look	for	your	C++	project	name	and	click	on	it.	If	you named	your	project	-	Keylogger,	you	should	be	looking	for	Keylogger. 	  	  														The	saved	Keystrokes	will	be	within	Keylogger	by	default.  Let’s	go	ahead	and	specify	file	paths	for	the	exact	location	we	will	like	obtained keystrokes	to	be	sent	to.  Within	the	parenthesis	in	front	of	the	file	creator	statement	on	Line	8,	include your	desired	path.	In	the	program	above,	C:\\Users\\Creator\\OUR_FILE	is	the chosen	path	where	the	stored	keystrokes	would	follow	to	OUR_FILE	 the	file name 		where	they	will	be	stored.	Having	done	this,	your	file	name	is	formed and	a	path	to	it	is	specified. WRITING	TO	YOUR	FILE: In	other	to	write	to	your	file	or	in	other	words	send	inputs	to	your	created	file,	on a	line	number	put	down	your	file	name	 in	the	program	above:	write 	the	same   way	you	print	out	statements	with	Cout	i.e. 																			Write	<<	“……”  Now,	from	the	part	of	the	program	displayed	in	the	figure	above,	take	a	look	at the	statement: 										“Windows	is	awesome	I	like	working	in	it,	I	like	all	the	freedom	I	have	in it	as”	“opposed	to	Linux” Notice	how	the	quotation	mark	is	used;	it	makes	no	difference	to	the	computer however	as	it	will	all	be	displayed	on	a	single	line	unless	an	escape	sequence such	as:	\n	or	endL	is	used.  In	the	above	figure,	the	program	has	been	compiled	and	set	to	run,	however	the statement	in	quotes	is	not	printed	to	the	display	window.	This	is	normal,	as	we did	not	instruct	the	program	to	display	inputs	but	to	send	them	to	OUR_FILE. Let’s	go	ahead	and	confirm	if	our	statement	was	written	to	the	file	we	created.   Ureka!!!	There	lies	our	statement	within	the	file	we	created	via	the	path	we	set. Well	done. Now,	it	is	good	practice	to	always	close	a	file	at	the	end	of	its	codes.	Its	easy work	and	we	have	a	built	in	function	for	that,	it	involves	just	re-writing	our output	filestream	name	 on	line	8:	write 	dot	close	and	then	parenthesis	with	a semi-colon	as	shown	in	the	figure	below	I.e.	write 	  	This	will	effectively	close  the	file	even	though	we	can’t	see	it. READING	FROM	A	FILE: We	will	go	through	the	basic	process	of	reading	input	from	a	file	however	later on	we	will	have	to	combine	this	with	loops	to	enable	us	achieve	more functionality.	For	the	time	being,	we	will	go	through	how	to	read	individual characters	from	a	file. Below	is	a	figure	which	displays	a	program	with	this	done,	let	us	evaluate	it.   First	of	all,	because	we	need	a	variable	to	store	it,	a	variable	x,	of	type	string	is created	on	Line	11.	Down	on	Line	13,	the	statement	read	>>		x;	will	read	the first	word	into	x		i.e.	it	will	reach	only	until	the	first	space	comes	along.	And	on Line	15,	Cout	x,	instructs	the	program	to	print	to	console	the	statement	the variable	x. On	running	the	program,	“Windows”	is	displayed	which	is	the	first	word	of	the statement	that	was	sent	to	our	file	 OUR_FILE.txt .	  Find	more	explanation	in	the	figure	displayed	above. As	we	advance,	we	will	see	how	we	can	read	the	whole	statement	or	input regardless	of	its	length,	regardless	of	the	spaces	between	each	word	and	so	on and	so	forth.	It	is	not	complicated,	as	we	only	need	to	create	a	loop	and	know how	to	handle	it.	We	will	do	this	definitely	as	we	need	to	master	how	to	write	to a	file	and	also	read	from	it. We	have	finally	come	through	the	basics	of	C++	and	so	we	can	now	start	with building	our	Keylogger.	We	will	begin	from	the	most	simple,	primitive   Keylogger	we	can	lay	hands	so	we	can	set	our	feet	right	and	from	there	move	on to	the	more	sophisticated	ones.   BASIC	KEYLOGGER  The	first	things	we	are	going	to	need	for	the	Keylogger	are	the	include  	and	include	 	header	files	because	we	are	going	to be	needing	some	functions	for	which	these	are	the	requirement. Building	loops	within	loops	 nested	loops 	is	important,	as	the	Keylogger	will have	lots	and	lots	of	this	within	it.	The	program	below	shows	how	a	loop	is	built within	another	loop	and	made	to	run	infinitely.  On	line	11,	a	variable	of	type	char	is	created	and	on	Line	13,	the	first	loop	 for loop	begins .	Within	the	parenthesis	of	this	loop,	conditions	are	set	to	govern	the operation	of	the	program	block.	A	variable	i	of	type	int	is	created	and	initialized to	0.	The	loop	is	set	to	continue	running	as	long	as	i	is	less	than	3	i.e.	i	will	run two	times.	The	i++	counts	and	records	the	number	of	cycles	the	program	has completed	and	stops	it	once	it	satisfies	the	condition	of	i	<	3.	The	beginning	and end	or	start	and	finish	of	this	loop	is	defined	by	the	braces	which	spans	from Line	14	to	Line	21. Note:	Curly	braces	are	used	to	mark	the	beginning	and	end	of	functions. In	other	words,	the	for	loop	on	line	13	will	begin	and	once	it	begins,	it	will	start evaluating	the	conditions	laid	out	within	it.	If	it	evaluates	to	true,	i.e.	if	i	is	less than	3,	it	will	run	whatever	codes	are	within	the	curly	brackets	of	the	for	loop.   Within	Line	15	and	18,	we	have	another	for	loop	nested	under	the	first.	The program	evaluates	the	codes	on	Line	15	and	as	long	as	it	evaluates	to	true,	it will	keep	on	printing	the	statement	on	Line	17	until	it	becomes	false	-when	j becomes	greater	or	equal	to	3-	it	will	stop,	exit	the	second	loop	and	enter	the	first loop	again	then	it	will	print	out	the	statement	on	Line	20	again	also.	If	the	first condition	evaluates	to	be	true	again,	the	second	loop	will	run	again	and	so	on	3 times	 0	–	2	=	0,	1,	2	times .	Study	the	program	below	taking	cognizance	of	it’s output.  Now	that	you	have	an	understanding	of	how	nested	structures	work,	let’s	get right	into	its	application	on	the	Keylogger.   From	the	figure	directly	above,	Line	12	contains	a	for	loop.	The	two	semi- colons	within	its	parenthesis	specifies	that	the	loop	is	an	infinite	one	i.e.	it	is	set to	run	continuously	without	ceasing.	On	Line	14	lies	a	nested	loop	whose conditions	specify	the	range	of	characters	the	program	will	be	able	to	read.	This range	of	character	is	obtained	from	the	ASCII	codes.	It	is	not	necessary	to	carry the	ASCII	table	in	your	head,	reference	can	simply	be	made	to	it	from	the internet.	Below	is	an	example	of	an	ASCII	code	table:  Each	number	represents	a	number	of	characters.	In	our	Keylogger	program,	Line 14	contains	characters	within	8	and	222	from	the	ASCII	table.	The	statement	on Line	16	is	a	statement	new	to	us,	however	it’s	nothing	complex.	It	is	called	a system	interrupt	function.	What	it	simply	does	is	observe	if	a	computer	user types	anything	on	his	keyboard.	Considering	the	fact	that	it	is	used	with	an	if   statement	it	says:	has	the	user	pressed	any	key	yet?	If	yes,	store	the	keys	in	our variable	c	and	then	based	on	Line	18	and	19,	send	it	to	our	file. On	the	same	Line	 18 ,	within	the	parenthesis,	the	ios	::	app	specifies	that	we don’t	want	our	file	to	be	re-written	every	time	somebody	presses	a	key.	If	we don’t	specify	this,	each	time	a	user	presses	a	Key,	the	file	will	open	again	and whatever	was	written	previously	will	be	over	written	by	the	new	content. It	seems	like	we	are	done	with	our	primitive	Keylogger	and	are	ready	to	run	it. However,	if	we	try	to	run	the	program	the	way	it	is	we	will	get	an	error	message. At	a	glance,	what	do	you	think	might	result	in	an	error? The	header	file!	We	failed	to	attach	the	header	file	that	will	enable	the	program run perform	a	function	that	was	specified	within	our	code	i.e.	function	to	send received	input	to	a	file.	The	header	file	for	this	 which	lets	us	utilize	the ofstream	function 	is	include	 .	Now	with	the	following	file	headers at	the	top	of	our	codes	our	program	will	run	successfully:  On	running	the	Keylogger	program	in	our	eclipse	environment	we	will	think	that the	program	is	not	functioning	because	nothing	will	be	printed	to	the	window console.	This	is	normal	however	as	we	didn’t	specify	anywhere	within	our	code that	inputs	be	printed	but	instead	be	sent	to	our	file. Our	little	Keylogger	functions,	storing	Keystrokes	we	make	anywhere	on	our system	presently	and	sending	them	to	Record.txt.	For	proof	that	the	Keylogger works,	let	us	visit	our	browser,	make	inputs	and	return	to	our	file	to	see	if	our inputs	are	stored.   In	the	figure	above,	it	can	be	seen	that	a	browser	was	opened	and	the	Yahoo website	was	visited.	Now	we	signed	in,	inputting	our	username	as USERNAME,	and	password	as	PASSWORD.	After	doing	this,	to	ascertain	if our	Keylogger	was	functioning,	we	went	to	our	default	file	location	for	our Keylogger	project	and	as	can	be	seen	displayed	on	the	white	screen	covering	the browser	partly,	the	input	we	made	for	the	website	Yahoo.com	was	recorded  however	the	dot	in	yahoo.com	isn’t	present,	we	will	make	sure	we	take	all characters	into	consideration	as	we	proceed	with	the	addition	of	more	features	to the	Keylogger .	Username	and	Password	was	also	recorded	as	seen. We	have	succeeded	in	writing	a	very	simple	Keylogger	however,	it	lacks	some features	such	as	filters,	which	will	filter	out	some	unwanted	characters	such	as the	Tab-like	spaces	that	appeared	when	we	made	inputs.	Also,	we	will	work	on adding	other	features	to	it. The	Keylogger	we	built	isn’t	too	awesome	majorly	because	of	the	way	it	records information.	When	we	test	ran	it,	we	discovered	that	it	couldn’t	handle	spaces and	tabs	alike	but	just	saved	the	input	anyway.	Let	us	build	more	functions	into our	Keylogger	so	it	will	become	better	at	handling	inputs.	We	can	achieve	this by	utilizing	Switch	statements.	Let’s	get	into	it	right	away! Mention	was	made	earlier	that	in	order	for	us	to	equip	our	Keylogger	with	the capability	of	handling	spaces,	tabs	and	other	characters	we	will	have	to	utilize the	switch	statement.	However	before	we	bring	in	our	switch	statement,	we	will   need	to	group	our	previously	written	 codes	under	one	function:	void	log  ,	to	make	things	easier	for	us.	Our	grouping will	be	done	as	shown	in	the	figure	below:  So	on	Line	8	the	function	void	with	name	log	is	created	to	house	our	previous codes.	This	function	will	return	no	value.	Furthermore,	as	required	void	is	called within	the	main	function	on	Line	8	so	it	can	be	used	at	any	time	by	simply calling	it	and	not	having	to	re-write	it	all	over	again.	On	re-testing	the	program, it	will	run	just	like	it	did	previously. INCORPORATING	THE	SWITCH	STATEMENT: With	reference	to	the	figure	above:  Delete	write	<<	c;	on	Line	27.	We	will	put	this	back	later	as	a default	case	so	incase	our	conditional	statements	all	evaluate	to   false,	it	will	be	executed.	For	the	main	time	let’s	take	it	out	so	we could	put	our	cases	in	place. As	on	Line	28,	write	the	switch	statement	and	pass	whatever happens	in	the	variable	c	 which	we	created	earlier 	to	switch	by parenthesizing	it	so	whatever	comes	into	the	variable	is	handled by	switch. Let’s	create	a	case	 one	of	different	conditions ,	say	case	8.	So,	if the	variable	c	has	a	numerical	value	of	8	 as	in	case	8 	in	ASCII	it  means	it	is	a	back	space. We	keep	on	adding	cases	utilizing	different	numbers	from	the ASCII	code	depending	on	what	the	numbers	represent,	so	our Keylogger	can	relate	to	almost	any	character	a	user	inputs.  So;	said	in	other	words,	what	the	statements	from	Line	22	to	35	does	is	this:   Line	22	covers	values	from	the	ASCII	code	within	8	and	222.	Line	24	has	a conditional	if	statement	which	checks	to	see	if	there	has	been	any	key interruptions	i.e.	if	any	key	on	the	users	keyboard	has	been	pressed	and	if	this evaluates	to	true,	the	function	on	Line	26	should	take	note	of	it,	store	it	in	a	file defined	on	the	same	line	as	Record.text	and	also	make	sure	that	later	inputs	do not	overwrite	earlier	ones.	The	switch	statement	on	Line	28	lets	the	cases	which are	evaluated	within	Line	30	and	34	be	passed	into	the	variable	c,	describing every	step	of	the	way,	what	key,	be	it	a	backspace,	the	enter	key,	escape	key	etc. a	user	presses	on	his	keyboard	instead	of	giving	us	those	tab	spaces	it	gave earlier.	Line	35	will	save	the	keystrokes	of	the	user	-supposing	he	doesn’t	press any	of	the	keys	within		number	8	to	222	of	the	ASCII	codes	or	any	of	those	our cases	cover-	the	way	it	did	in	our	primitive	Keylogger. Time	has	to	be	taken	to	include	cases	that	will	cover	a	lot	of	possible	characters that	can	be	utilized	for	a	username	or	password,	as	this	will	make	the	Keylogger save	user	inputs	in	a	way	that	will	be	understood.	Let’s	take	a	look	at	upper	and lower	case	letters.   UPPER	AND	LOWER	CASE	LETTERS  Just	as	important	as	the	upper	and	lower	case	letters	are	to	the	English	language, they	are	important	too	to	general	programming	especially	when	it	comes	to utilizing	them	for	the	purpose	of	the	Keylogger.	We	have	to	learn	how	to differentiate	between	the	two	letter	cases.	We	will	also	be	doing	a	little	bit	of filtering	with	the	tab,	caps	lock,	shift,	alt,	arrow	and	mouse	keys	too.  Well,	we	can	differentiate	between	the	upper	and	lower	case	letters	by	using	the state	of	the	shift	key;	we	can	also	use	the	state	of	the	arrow	key	too.	So	if	either of	these	two	keys	is	pressed	then	please	write	capital	letters	otherwise	write lower	case	letters.	This	is	what	we	want	to	tell	our	program.	By	default,	the program	above	will	write	in	capital	letters	so	we	have	to	define	the	state	for lower	case	letters. It’s	true	that	slight	changes	has	been	made	to	the	program	for	our	Keylogger shown	in	the	figure	above,	nevertheless	do	not	gather	butterflies	in	your	stomach as	we	will	analyze	the	whole	program.	We	made	mention	that	the	first Keylogger	we	made	was	a	primitive	one,	gradually	we	are	going	into	the	more sophisticated	ones. One	of	the	things	we	have	changed	is	the	variable	in	which	our	keystrokes	are placed.	We	changed	its	name	from	c	to	key.	Giving	names	that	fit	the information	to	be	placed	in	variables	is	good	practice	as	it	helps	in	the	location of	any	information	very	easily	or	should	in	case	you	are	working	with	a	team	of other	code	writers,	they	will	be	able	to	locate	whatever	function	they	seek	very easily.   On	line	23,	we	have	incorporated	the	sleep	function	though	it	has	be	commented out	for	the	time	being	it	will	be	used	later	on.	The	sleep	function	helps	prevent the	CPU	from	maxing	 causing	it	to	slow	down 	out	as	a	result	of	running repetitively.	However	the	sleep	function	is	not	the	best	solution	for	preventing the	CPU	from	maxing	out	but	for	now	we	will	use	it	to	avoid	getting	into	any complex	matters. While	the	Sleep  	function	will	pause	the	program	for	any	number	of milliseconds	put	within	the	parenthesis	 e.g.	sleep 1 ,	sleep 2 ,	sleep 5 …	etc. , the	sleep  	function	with	zero	within	its	parenthesis	 i.e.	sleep 0  	does something	different.	It	tells	the	program	to	stop	using	the	CPU	whenever	another program	wants	to	use	it. Let	us	go	ahead	and	analyze	the	code	from	Line	31	down	to	43	as	it	is	a	block, which	works	together.  *Note	that	Key	+=	32	is	equivalent	to	Key	=	Key	+	32. The	block	of	codes	displayed	in	figure	above	is	one	created	for	the	purpose	of distinguishing	between	the	upper	and	lower	case	letters.	 Line	30	contains	an	if	statement	which	basically	say:	if	the	value	of	key	is greater	than	64	 all	values	from	ASCII	code 	but	lesser	than	91	and	the	shift	key is	not	pressed	 written	as	! GetAsyncKey	 0x10  	 	-where	0x10	is	the hexadecimal	notation	for	the	Shift	key-	please	add	32	to	the	previous	key	values. It	is	worthy	of	note	that	the	range	64	to	91	within	the	if	conditional	statements was	not	just	chosen	at	random	but	on	intent	owing	to	the	fact	that	letters	of	the alphabet	fall	between	this	range	on	the	ASCII	table. From	the	cutout	of	the	ASCII	code	displayed	in	the	figure	below,	doing	some little	math,	we	will	see	why	we	chose	the	number	32	to	be	added	to	the	values	in key	within	our	conditional	if	statement	on	Line	31.   Our	if	conditional	statement	on	Line	31	stated:	if	key	is	greater	than	64…	this means	during	evaluation,	Key	will	be	read	from	the	number	65.	Now	take	a	look at	the	number	65	on	the	ASCII	table	under	the	character	column.	65	represents the	upper	case	letter	A. Now,	if	32	is	added	to	65	the	result	is	97.	Take	a	look	at	the	char	column	of number	97	on	the	ASCII	table,	does	the	number	97	represent	the	lower	case letter	a?	Yes	it	does! Remember	that	by	default	our	Keylogger	program	will	use	upper	case	letters	and like	the	codes	within	Line	31	and	33	states,	if	the	shift	key	is	not	pressed	 to make	the	letter	uppercase 	then		the	value	32	 which	will	convert	the	letter	to	its lowercase	as	defined	by	the	ASCII	table 	should	be	added.	Now	we	know	why 32	is	the	number	chosen	to	be	added. You	can	go	ahead	and	pick	a	number	from	the	ASCII	table,	which	represents any	uppercase	letter,	add	32	to	that	number	and	see	if	it	leads	you	to	the lowercase	of	the	very	same	letter. While	the	statement	on	Line	34	closes	the	file:	that	on	Line	35	is	utilized	for	just the	test	run	so	we	don’t	check	for	anything	else.	We	might	remove	it	later,	but let’s	just	see	how	it	works	in	our	program	for	the	main	time.   Analyzed	together,	Line	31	to	42	says:	if	the	range	of	values	in	the	program	falls within	that	which	contains	letters	of	the	alphabet	in	ASCII	code	and	the	shift	key is	not	pressed	 for	capitalization 	add	the	number	32	to	the	previous	values	to convert	to	lowercase	and	this	lower	case	be	written	to	file	unless	however,	the shift	key	is	not	pressed	then	the	input	should	be	sent	to	file	in	uppercase. The	figure	below	shows	the	output	of	the	program	during	a	test-run	session:  Here	command	prompt	was	used	 the	Keylogger	can	be	tested	anywhere	as	long as	inputs	are	made 	to	test	the	program	and	like	you	see,	it	did	work. Note	also	that	the	program	we	just	analyzed	was	one	for	differentiating	between the	upper	and	lowercase	letters.	During	the	test	above,	spaces	were	not	given between	each	of	the	words	we	wrote,	this	is	because	we	used	a	multi-line comment	to	shutout	the	aspect	of	our	code	that	contains	the	required	cases	to handle	spacing	and	similar	function	and	so	if	we	used	spacing	the	form	of	the input	would	be	in	some	sort	of	disarray.	Our	basic	intention	here	was	to	treat uppercase	and	lowercase	letters.   Furthermore,	this	is	just	one	way	to	implement	the	differentiation	between	the uppercase	and	lower	case	letters	there	are	several	ways	to	do	this.	Some	of	them are	probably	better	than	this	one,	feel	free	to	experiment	for	it	will	help	further your	knowledge. FILTERING	CHARACTERS: Here,	we	are	going	to	see	how	we	can	filter	out	all	types	of	characters.	This	is important	as	in	in	most	cases,	people	tend	to	type	in	certain	characters	such	as: asterisk	signs,	exclamation	mark,	symbol	for	a	British	pound	etc.	as	passwords and	these	symbols	in	most	cases	are	obtained	by	the	combination	of	two	or	more keys.	Filtering	will	enable	our	Keylogger	recognize	when	such	keys	are	pressed by	a	user. We	need	to	deal	with	these	things	however,	the	big	question	is	HOW?	Well think	of	it	these	ways,	what	will	you	press	on	your	keyboard	to	get	the exclamation	mark?	Depending	on	the	keyboard	you	use,	however	for	the exclamation	mark	it	is	quite	universal;	Shift	1	will	give	you	that.	We	need	to make	a	statement,	which	will	recognize	the	state	of	the	shift	key	and	if	the	shift key	is	pressed	and	the	value,	which	follows	after,	is	the	ASCII	value	of	the number	1	on	the	keyboard,	please	don’t	record	1,	record	“exclamation	mark” instead. Let’s	go	about	solving	this	problem.		Utilizing	the	if	statement	solely	is	not	the best	way	to	tackle	this,	however	using	it	together	with	the	switch	statement	Is awesome	as	it	will	help	with	better	efficiency. Bringing	in	the	rest	of	the	codes	we	have	written	previously,	adding	the	recent codes	displayed	in	the	figure	below	from	Line	43	to	Line	50	gives	our	Keylogger the	feature	of	being	able	to	detect	such	inputs	as	the	exclamation	mark	and	other symbols	which	a	user	may	use	within	his	password.   Having	described	the	functions	of	the	codes	from	Line	35	down	to	45	earlier	and being	that	we	are	used	to	the	codes	and	how	they	operate	 Basics	of	C++ 	we might	already	have	made	a	good	guess	of	how	the	part	of	the	program	above	will function.	Well	that’s	good	as	it	tells	greatly	that	we	are	better	than	we	started	and that’s	great! Well,	from	the	ASCII	code,	the	value	49	on	Line	 47 	represents	the	number	1. Line	49	says:	if	the	shift	key	 described	by	0x10	in	Hexadecimal	form 	is interrupted	tell	us	this.	Also,	since	the	program	has	case	49	added	to	its	list,	if the	user	types	the	number	1	on	his	keyboard	immediately	after	the	shift	key	it will	send	the	exclamation	symbol	 ! 	to	RECORD.txt	as	directed	by	Line	50.  As	shown	in	the	figure	above,	the	Keylogger	is	being	run	and	tested	by	utilizing the	quotation	mark	in	addition	to	a	short	note,	which	says	“Heythere”	through the	command	prompt	window	to	see	if	it	will	recognize	the	exclamation	symbol and	send	it	to	our	project	file	as	we	defined	it	 ! 	or	just	give	us	some	other result.   Nice!	As	seen	above	in	the	figure,	our	Keylogger	now	writes	the	exclamation mark	for	what	it	truly	is	and	not	just	some	funny	figure	*the	statement highlighted	is	previously	tested	work,	it	isn’t	part	and	parcel	of	the	result	of	the recent	test. From	this	point	on,	we	just	have	to	continue	building	on	the	switch	statement, adding	more	and	more	cases	to	represent	all	the	characters	we	will	want	our Keylogger	to	be	able	to	interpret.	This	will	allow	us	to	customize	our	Keylogger to	a	keyboard	that	we	will	like	generally,	so	even	if	a	person	has	his	or	her	keys configured	differently	it	affects	you	but	not	very	much. So	far	we	have	written	our	codes	in	blocks,	from	the	case-checking	block,	the character	incorporation	block	to	the	filing	block	etc.	and	have	put	these	blocks with	different	functions	together	to	fulfil	a	single	the	single	purpose	of	a	good Keylogger.	Now	let’s	go	ahead	with	the	case	incorporation	 filtering 	and	better general	code	arrangement.   ENCOMPASSING	OTHER	CHARACTERS  	 We	have	incorporated	more	break	statements	at	the	end	of	each	check,	so	if	the conditional	statement	evaluates	to	true,	the	program	should	jump	the	loop	and move	on		to	the	next	task.	Also	in	the	else	part	where	we	have	the	switch statement	with	cases	under	it;	for	all	the	characters	we	see	ranging	from	the parenthesis,	backslash,	forward	slash,	exclamation	mark	etc.	in	the	figure	below, they	are	written	in	a	way	in	which	the	program	can	tell	that	just	a	value	was pressed	without	a	shift	key	and	therefore	it	should	print	that	value	and	not	a symbol.  For	instance,	on	Line	48	we	have	case	48	written.	48	on	the	ASCII	table represent	the	number	0.  So,	when	a	user	presses	the	key	that	carries	the	number	0	and	at	the	same	time	a close	parenthesis,	depending	on	whether	shift	is	pressed	or	not	 based	on	the statement	of	Line	50 ,	either	a	close	parenthesis	“ ”	or	a	0	will	be	recorded  examine	the	code	within	Line	48	and	52 .	With	the	 GetAsyncKey 0x10   function	on	Line	50,	the	program	verifies		whether	the	shift	key	is	being	pressed   or	not	and	if	it	is	and		0	is	being	pressed	along	with	it	then	the	close	parenthesis will	be	considered	and	if	it	is	not,	0	will	be	written. With	the	break	statement	on	Line	55,	if	the	condition,	which	lies	within	Line	48 and	54,	evaluates	to	true,	the	program	does	not	go	checking	other	cases	out	just yet,	it	exits	the	loop	immediately. Basically,	for	the	rest	of	the	cases	in	the	program	from	Line	48	down	concerned with	determining	whether	or	not	it	is	a	number	typed	by	the	user	or	a	symbol sharing	the	same	key	as	the	individual	numbers	on	the	keyboard,	we	follow	the same	logic	as	we	have	for	the	0	or	close	parenthesis	case	which	falls	within Line	48	and	53.  The	figures	below	shows	what	the	cases	will	look	like	put	together:   Now	we	have	incorporated	cases	to	cover	both	the	keyboard	numbers	and symbols,	let	us	go	ahead	and	test	if	they	function	properly.   Having	gathered	the	cases	to	cover	numbers	and	symbols	of	the	Keyboard,	it	is good	that	we	test	to	see	if	the	Keylogger	actually	recognizes	them.	So	as	seen above,	we	have	built	the	code	and	set	it	to	run.	Using	the	command	prompt window	we	type	in	the	digits	on	the	keyboard	and	also	the	symbols	by	holding down	the	shift	key	combing	the	digits	1	–	9	one	after	the	other.  From	the	figure	above	it	is	clear	that	the	Keylogger	recognizes	our	number	and symbol	inputs	and	so,	if	a	user	happens	to	use	numbers	and	symbols	for password	or	username	or	anything	else,	our	Keylogger	at	its	present	state	will still	do	good	magic. Earlier,	we	added	a	function	which	enables	our	Keylogger	tell	the	difference between	upper	and	lower	case	letters	so	it	will	still	do	fine	if	a	user	uses	a mixture	of	numbers,	symbols,	upper	and	lower	case	letters	as	password.   Having	come	this	far,	we	can	decide	to	utilize	the	Keylogger	the	way	it	is	but adding	more	functionality	wouldn’t	be	bad	at	all	as	the	more	keys	we	get	to	add to	the	Keylogger,	the	better	we	can	trust	its	overall	performance.	Lets	go	ahead and	add	more	cases	that	will	make	our	Keylogger	generally	more	relevant. VIRTUAL	KEYS: So	far	we	have	been	adding	series	of	cases	revolving	around	numbers,	letters	and symbols	however	an	area	we	haven’t	really	done	much	work	in	is	the	area	of virtual	keys.	The	virtual	keys	cover	the	tab	key,	capslock,	backspace,	escape, delete	key	and	many	more	keys	such	as	the	f-keys,	the	arrow	keys	etc.	which serve	a	purpose	of	making	the	logged	information	obtained	by	the	Keylogger look	presentable	and	readable. Imagine	what	your	log	will	look	like	if	your	Keylogger	sent	you	a	week’s	work of	gathered	inputs	without	including	backspace,	delete	key	or	tab.	The	log	will be	so	lengthy	and	it	will	be	hard	to	sieve	out	the	actual	info	from	the	lot. We	try	to	narrow	down	our	Keylogger	to	contain	most	of	the	keys	that	users	are likely	to	use	for	passwords,	instead	of	just	adding	everything.	For	instance	the arrow	keys,	num	lock	and	f-keys	don’t	necessarily	need	to	be	added	to	the Keylogger. This	is	important	as	most	Keyloggers	gather	info	for	a	week	or	more	before sending	it	over.	Besides,	the	more	the	not-too	relevant	keys	we	have	present,	the more	the	load	of	input	we	have	to	sieve	through	to	obtain	just	maybe	a	single password	and	username	we	require. Virtual	Keys	can	be	searched	for	on	the	Internet	and	depending	on	your	quest, you	can	add	those	that	will	better	fulfill	your	purpose.   Within	Line	127	down	to	145,	we	have	incorporated	a	good	number	of	really important	codes,	such	as	the	backspace,	delete,	escape	and	other	keys	as	seen above. As	observed,	the	virtual	Keys	can	be	written	without	using	neither	the	if statement	nor	the	curly	brackets	and	they	still	function	fine. Let’s	go	ahead	and	carry	out	a	real	life	test	of	our	Keylogger	to	see	how	fine	it performs	and	how	more	readable	the	logged	file	will	be.	  As	seen	above	our	Keylogger	is	first	tested	one	more	time	using	the	command window	to	gauge	its	functionality	and	like	you	might	have	noticed	already,	it showed	that	the	user	utilized	a	backspace	once	in	the	process	of	writing username.	So	you	see	already	that	our	logged	file	is	more	readable. Now	let’s	go	ahead	and	test	our	Keylogger	within	a	browser	to	ascertain	if	it	will work	just	fine	there	too.   We	visited	a	couple	of	sites	before	finally	stopping	by	the	Ubuntu	forum	where we	have	inputted	a	username	and	a	password.	If	our	Keylogger	is	a	good	one,	it should	have	recorded	our	Keystrokes	from	the	first	time	we	opened	the	browser. Let’s	see	if	it	did.  Perfect!	Our	Keylogger	works	really	fine	as	it	tells	that	I	visited	Udemy	and Gmail	before	finally	attempting	to	login	to	the	Ubuntu	forum.   HIDE	KEYLOGGER	CONSOLE	WINDOW  Basically,	we	have	incorporated	a	lot	in	our	Keylogger	and	we	can	say	that	we are	done	however,	there	are	still	two	important	things	left	for	us	to	do	before	we say	we	have	completed	our	Keylogger.	The	first	is:	creating	a	release	version	of the	Keylogger	so	it	can	be	installed	on	a	CD	or	sent	as	a	file	and	the	second: hiding	the	file.	We	will	also	see	one	problem	the	Keylogger	has	which	we cannot	see	while	running	it	from	within	the	eclipse	environment. 	 Here	are	the	steps	to	creating	a	release	version	of	our	Keylogger:  Being	that	the	program	is	well	written	within	the	editor,	go	to	the “Hammer”	in	the	upper	left	corner	of	eclipse	environment.	From the	drop	down	menu	that	appears,	select	“debug”	and	then “release.”  Ensure	that	the	Keylogger	is	not	running	to	avoid	getting	an	error message.	Then,	Select	“build”	or	use	ctrl	+	s	to	achieve	the	same purpose.  														Open	up	the	file	manager	and	go	into	our	workspace.	Click	on  “Keylogger”	which	is	the	name	of	our	project,	open	it	up.	Within “keylogger”	we	have	a	debug	version,	a	release	and	some	other	files. Now,	the	release	version	of	our	Keylogger	is	ready	for	execution.   	 HIDING	THE	KEYLOGGER: On	clicking	on	the	Keylogger.exe	 the	executional	file ,	a	black	window,	which saves	the	Keystrokes	of	the	user,	appears	on	the	home	screen	and	it	looks	like	it does	in	the	figure	below:  The	black	window	records	whatever	keys	we	press	to	the	RECORD.txt	file	but this	isn’t	good	at	all	as	whoever	sees	such	a	display	on	his	or	her	screen	will smell	a	rat.	And	what	do	you	think	a	typical	computer	user	will	do?	Probably press	the	X	 close	button 	and	that’s	it;	your	Keylogger	stops	running	and	all your	effort	down	the	drain	for	no	good	reason. However,	there	is	a	way	we	can	hide	this	window.	We	can	do	this	by	creating	a function	-that	will	hide	the	entire	program-	within	our	code.	Let	us	begin	by giving	this	function	a	name	that	will	help	us	identify	it	from	within	the	code	so we	can	make	reference	to	it	whenever	need	be,	say:	hide.   In	creating	the	function	that	will	hide	the	Keylogger	we	will	need	to	first	create	a function	outside	the	main	function	and	then	call	it	within	it	 the	main	function  we	will	also	need	to	create	another	function	at	the	end	of	the	program. On	line	9,	a	function	that	will	hide	the	Keylogger	is	created	with	the	name	hide. It	is	created	outside	the	main	function.	Following	this,	the	function	is	called within	the	main	function	on	Line	13	and	an	extension	of	this	function	is	also added	to	the	end	of	the	program	as	seen	in	the	figure	below:  On	Line	182,	a	handler	called	stealth	is	created	to	handle	the	input	 the Keylogger	window	being	displayed	on	the	home	screen 	generated	by	the FindwindowA  	function.	On	Line	185,	details	of	the	Keylogger	window	which has	been	obtained	and	stored	in	stealth,	is	set	to	0.	Zero	implying	that	it shouldn’t	display	it	on	the	home	screen. That	done,	on	building	and	releasing	our	Keylogger	afresh	as	an	executable	file, we	obtain	a	wonderful	result.	The	Keylogger	no	longer	displays	a	window	on	the home	screen	so	not	even	you	the	creator	can	see	that	it	is	running.	Confirming whether	your	code	is	running	might	be	a	problem	however.	A	way	you	can check	it	is	by	writing	something	anywhere	on	your	system	perhaps	your	notepad. After	this,	open	your	workspace	as	well	as	the	Record.txt	file	and	if	your keystrokes	are	saved	then	your	Keylogger	works.   If	you	have	gotten	to	this	point,	big	congrats	to	you! Finally,	we	have	come	to	the	end	of	this	course	which	illustrates	how	to	build	a Keylogger.	Hopefully	at	this	point,	making	your	own	Keylogger	wouldn’t seem	like	an	impossible	task	to	you	anymore	but	one	that	can	easily	be accomplished	without	much	stress. Though	the	Keylogger	we	have	built	here	might	not	be	the	most	advanced	one that	there	is	out	there	or	one	with	the	super	features	that	you	expected	a Keylogger	to	have,	however	with	the	knowledge	you	have	gathered	on	building what	we	have	here,	making	others	with	more	advanced	features	such	as	webcam activation,	screen	capturing	and	other	cool	features	wouldn’t	be	a	problem	to you	with	little	research. Furthermore,	if	you	followed	this	course	it	is	expected	that	you	understand	pretty much	about	the	C++	programing	language,	its	syntax,	how	it	functions	and	you are	able	to	write	other	programs	beside	the	Keylogger	which	you	have	just	learnt to	build. Continue	practicing,	researching	and	finding	solutions	to	problems	you	will encounter	along	the	way	and	you	will	record	great	improvements.   ABOUT	THE	AUTHOR  Alan	T.
