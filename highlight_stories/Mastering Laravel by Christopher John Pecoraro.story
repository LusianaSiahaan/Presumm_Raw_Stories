I would like to thank my family for putting up with me through the  late nights while I was reviewing this book and my work colleagues  for advising me to put the time in to do the review. Of course, most  of all, I would like to thank my pet beagle, Archer, who, without fail,  never ceases to make me smile.   Js Lim had totally no idea about programming back in 2008. He started to pick  up programming when doing an assignment at Tunku Abdul Rahman college,  Malaysia, using the C programming language. Then, in 2011, he entered into a  company as an internship trainee. This was the first time he studied PHP. His  company was using two frameworks: one was an in-house framework, which was  quite messy, and the other one was CodeIgniter. At that moment, the in-house  framework needed to be refactored; thus, he and his team managed to code the  AdoDB ORM plugin into that and changed it to an MVC design, which took quite  some time. He is very fresh and is always looking for new things to learn. He saw  his supervisor using Ubuntu and Vim, and he followed that the rest of the staff was  using Windows and Notepad++. He is now a Vim lover.  After his graduation, he joined a company that was into developing enterprise projects  using ColdFusion. After working there for 3 months, he left due to the technologies  used. He joined a company named Werebits, which was a start-up. This company  was doing an in-house project, ChopInk, which is a kind of loyalty program. The  technology behind this was LAMP stack-hosted on Amazon EC2, Zend Framework  1. After a few months, the company took a project, which he chose to use Zend  Framework 2 on, and took some time to finish the project. Later on, the CEO decided to  migrate ChopInk to another framework. He was assigned the task of choosing a better  framework; after some research, he decided to use Laravel 4. Up until now, Laravel is  still the best framework for him as well as to the Werebits team. At some point, he was  approached by a college friend to join a company named Weavary Connection as a  partner; he then got the technology over, which was the Laravel framework.   Chinmoy Maity is a programmer, entrepreneur, and loves to write code   for a living.  He graduated in 2010 with a BSc in computer science with a first-class grade.   He completed has MCA  master of computer application  degree in 2013 with a   first-class grade and was awarded a gold medal.  He has been working in the web development industry for the last two and a half  years  mostly with start-ups .  Since 2007, he has been coding, and this has become his profession—he is a backend  developer. He is always excited to learn new technologies, write new code, and  learn new programming languages. He is an expert in building core PHP and  PHP framework-based applications. Other than being good at frontend  such as  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, responsive designing, and so on , he does  development too. Besides all his professional work, he works on a few hobby  projects that are related to Android and robotics.   www.PacktPub.com  Support files, eBooks, discount offers, and more For support files and downloads related to your book, please visit   www.PacktPub.com.

Laravel 5 is proving to be the most usable framework for  novice and expert programmers alike. Following modern PHP's object-oriented best  practices, reduce the time to market and build robust web and API-driven mobile  applications that can be automatically tested and deployed.  You will learn how to rapidly develop software applications using the Laravel 5   PHP framework.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Designing Done Right with phpspec, speaks about how to configure Laravel 5  for phpspec to perform modern unit testing, to use phpspec to design classes, and to  perform unit and functional testing. Chapter 2, Automating Tests – Migrating and Seeding Your Database, covers database  migrations, the mechanics behind them and how to create a seed for testing. Chapter 3, Building Services, Commands, and Events, talks about Model-View-Controller  and how has evolved into services, commands, and events to decouple code and  practice separation of concerns.  Chapter 4, Creating RESTful APIs, takes you through the creation of a RESTful API:  the basic CRUD operations  create, read, update, and delete , as well as discussing  some best practices and hypermedia controls  HATEOAS . Chapter 5, Using the Form Builder, takes you to the web interface side of things and  shows you how to take advantage of the some of the newest features of Laravel 5 to  create web forms. Reversed routing will be discussed here as well.  [ vii ]   Chapter 6, Taming Complexity with Annotations, focuses on annotations. The routes. php file easily becomes messy when an application grows in complexity. Using  annotations inside of controllers, code legibility is drastically increased; however,  there are some disadvantages in addition to the advantages. Chapter 7, Filtering Requests with Middleware, shows you how to create reusable filters  that can be called either before or after the controllers.  Chapter 8, Querying the Database with the Eloquent ORM, helps you learn how to use an  ORM in a way to reduce the probability of errors in coding, increase the security and  reduction of SQL-injection probability, and also learn how to deal with the limits of  the Eloquent ORM. Chapter 9, Scaling Laravel, speaks about scaling an application to move it into a cloud- based architecture. The read write master slave configuration is discussed and the  reader is guided through the configuration. Chapter 10, Building, Compiling, and Testing with Elixir, introduces Elixir. Elixir is  based on gulp, which is a task runner and is a series of build scripts that automates  common tasks in the Laravel software development workflow.  What you need for this book We'll need the following software:     Apache Nginx    PHP 5.4 or greater    MySQL or similar    Composer    phpspec    Node.js    npm  Who this book is for If you are an experienced novice or a capable PHP programmer who has a basic  understanding of the concepts of modern PHP  at least version 5.4 , then this   book is ideal for you.  [ viii ]   Basic object-oriented programming and database knowledge is expected. You should  already know your way around Laravel or will have at least experimented with the  framework.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different  kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of  their meaning.  Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,  pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: “  The new artisan command is run as follows”  A block of code is set as follows:  protected function schedule Schedule $schedule      {         $schedule->command 'inspire'               ->hourly  ;         $schedule->command 'manage:waitinglist'              ->everyFiveMinutes  ;      }  Any command-line input or output is written as follows:  $ php artisan schedule:run  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the  screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: “ The  migration table now appears, as shown in the following screenshot.”  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  [ ix ]   Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome. Let us know what you think about  this book—what you liked or disliked.

[ xi ]    Designing Done Right with  phpspec  Many things have happened since Laravel's humble beginnings in 2011. Taylor  Otwell, a .NET programmer, sought out PHP as a way to do a side project, since he  was told that hosted PHP was cheap and ubiquitous. What originally started out as  an extension to CodeIgniter become its own code. Freeing up the code base from the  limitations of CodeIgniter's PHP 5.2, all of the new features that PHP 5.3 had to offer,  such as namespacing and closures, could be used. The time span between the release  of versions 1 and 3 of Laravel was only one year. With version 3, things happened  very quickly. After its explosion in popularity, which happened around the time that  version 4 was released, it quickly began to steal the market share from other popular  frameworks such as CodeIgniter, Zend, Symfony, Yii, and CakePHP to eventually  take the pole position. Along with its expressive syntax, great documentation, and a  passionate founder came large community mainstays the IRC and Slack chat room,  The Laravel Podcast, and the Laracasts instructional video website. Also, the newly  created commercial support such as Envoyer, which provides 100 percent uptime,  means that Laravel was also welcomed by enterprises. With the release of Laravel  4.2, the minimum required PHP version was increased to 5.4 to take advantage of  modern PHP features such as traits.   [ 1 ]   Using Laravel's traits along with the new syntax, such as the [] array shortcut,   makes coding a breeze. Laravel's expressive syntax, coupled with these modern   PHP features, makes it a great choice for any developer who wishes to build   robust applications.  Laravel's rise in success, as reported by Google Trends  A new era In late 2014, the second most important part of the history of Laravel occurred.  When what was scheduled to be version 4.3 changed many of the core principals of  Laravel, the community decided that it should become version 5.  The arrival of Laravel 5 brings about many changes in the way we use it to build  software. The built-in MVC architecture that was inherited from frameworks such  as CodeIgniter has been abandoned in favor of being more dynamic, modular, and  even daringly framework-agnostic. Many of the components have been decoupled as  much as possible. The most important part of Laravel's history will be the arrival of  Laravel version 5.1, which will have long-term support  LTS . Thus, Laravel's place  in enterprises will be solidified even more. Also, the minimum PHP requirements  will be changed to version 5.5. So, for any new projects, PHP 5.5, or even PHP 5.6, is  recommended because upgrading to PHP version 7 will be even easier.  [ 2 ]   A leaner app The  app directory was slimmed down, leaving in only the most essential parts of  the application. Directories such as config, database, storage, and tests have  been moved out of the app directory since they are auxiliary to the application itself.  Most importantly, the integration of the testing tools has matured drastically.  PSR Thanks to the efforts of the Framework Interoperability Group  PHP-FIG , the  developer of the PHP Standard Recommendation  PSR , the reading, writing, and  formatting of the framework code is becoming easier. It even allows developers  to more easily work in more than one framework. Laravel is a part of the FIG  and continues to adopt its recommendations into the framework. Laravel 5.1, for  example, will adopt the PSR-2 standard. For more information about the PHP FIG  and PSR, visit the PHP-FIG website, http:  www.php-fig.org.  Installing and configuring Laravel The latest up-to-date instructions to install Laravel can always be found at the  Laravel website, http:  laravel.com. To begin using Laravel in a development  environment, the current best practices suggest using the following:     Vagrant: This provides a convenient way to manage a virtual machine,    such as Virtualbox.     PuPHPet: This is an excellent tool that can be used to create a virtual   machine of various types. For more information about PuPHPet, visit  https:  puphpet.com.     Phansible: This is an alternative to PuPHPet. For information about   Phansible, visit http:  phansible.com.     Homestead: This is maintained by the Laravel community, and is a virtual   machine that is created specifically for Laravel and which uses NGINX  instead of Apache. For more information about Homestead, visit   https:  github.com laravel homestead.  [ 3 ]   Installation The basic process involves downloading and installing Composer and then adding  Laravel as a dependency. An important detail is that the storage directory, which is  located parallel to the  app directory, needs to be set in such a way that it is writable  by the web server user in order to allow Laravel 5 to do things like writing the log  files. It is also important to make sure that $ php artisan key:generate is used to  generate a 32-character key that is used for hashing because, since the release of PHP  5.6, Mcrypt is more strict as regards its requirements. For Laravel 5.1, OpenSSL will  replace Mcrypt.  Configuration In Laravel 4, the environments were configured in a manner that relied on the  hostname of the server or a development machine, and this was rather contrived.  Laravel 5 instead uses a .env file that sets up the various environments. This file is  included in .gitignore. Thus, each machine should receive its configuration from a  source outside the source code control.  So for example, something like the following code can be used to set up a local  development:  APP_ENV=local APP_DEBUG=true APP_KEY=SomeRandomString DB_HOST=localhost DB_DATABASE=example DB_USERNAME=DBUser DB_PASSWORD=DBPass CACHE_DRIVER=file SESSION_DRIVER=file  Namespacing A nice new feature of Laravel is that it allows you to set the highest level namespace  to something such as MyCompany through the app:name command. This command  will actually change the namespace of all the relevant files inside the  app directory  from App to MyCompany, for example. This namespace then lives inside the  app  directory. This builds namespacing right into virtually every file whereas previously,  in version 4.x, it was optional.  [ 4 ]   TDD done right The culture of test-driven development is not new. Rather, it has been around  even before Kent Beck wrote SUnit in the 1990's. The xUNIT family of unit testing  frameworks, which stemmed from SUnit, has grown to provide a testing solution   for PHP.  PHPUnit The PHP port of the PHP testing software is named PHPUnit. Yet, test-driven  development in the PHP language is a fairly recent concept. For example, in his  book, "The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications", which  was published at the end of 2012, Chris Hartjes wrote "I started looking into the  culture of testing surrounding CodeIgniter. It's weaker than a newborn baby."  Testing has been a part of the Laravel framework since version 3 that uses the  PHPUnit unit-testing tool, and therefore Laravel's inclusion of the phpunit.xml   file was a huge leap forward in the effort to encourage developers to embrace   test-driven development.  phpspec Another testing tool, RSpec, emerged in the Ruby community in 2007 and was a  refinement on test-driven development. It featured behavior driven development   BDD . The phpspec tool, which brought ported RSpec's BDD to PHP, is growing  rapidly in popularity. Its co-creator, Marcello Duarte, repeatedly states that "BDD  is TDD done right". Therefore, BDD is simply an improvement or evolution of TDD.  Laravel 5 now cleverly includes phpspec as a way to accentuate the design by  specification paradigm of behavior-driven development.  Since an essential step in building a Laravel 5 application is to specify which entities  to create, after installing and configuring Laravel 5, the developer may immediately  start designing by running phpspec as a design tool.  [ 5 ]   Entity creation Let's create a sample web application. If the client has asked us to build a   booking system for tourism structures, then the system may contain the entities   such as accommodations  hotels and bed and breakfasts, for example , rooms,   rates, and reservations.  The simplified database schema will look like this:  [ 6 ]   The MyCompany database schema The database schema has the following assumptions:     An accommodation has many rooms    Reservations are made for a single user    A reservation may include more than one room    A reservation has a start date and an end date    Rates are valid for one room from a start date to an end date    A room has many amenities    The start date of the reservation must come before the end date    A reservation cannot be made for more than fifteen days    A reservation cannot include more than four rooms  Designing with phpspec Now, let's begin using phpspec as a design tool to build our entities.  If the top-level namespace is MyCompany, then use phpspec and simply type the  following command:   phpspec describe MyCompany AccommodationRepository  On typing the preceding command, spec AccommodationSpecRepository.php   gets created:  <?php  namespace spec\MyCompany;  use PhpSpec\ObjectBehavior; use Prophecy\Argument;  class AccommodationRepositorySpec extends ObjectBehavior {     function it_is_initializable       {  [ 7 ]           $this->shouldHaveType 'MyCompany\AccommodationRepository' ;     } <?php  namespace MyCompany;  class AccommodationRepository { }  The path to phpspec should be added to either the .bashrc or the  .bash_profile file so that phpspec can be run directly.  Then, type the following command:   phpspec run  On typing the preceding command, the developer is shown, as follows:  class MyCompany\AcccommodationRepository does not exist.  Do you want me to create 'MyCompany\AccommodationRepository'     for you? [Y n]  After typing Y, the AccommodationRepository.php class is created, as follows:  <?php  namespace MyCompany;  class AccommodationRepository {}  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files from your account at  http:  www.packtpub.com for all the Packt Publishing books  you have purchased.

[ 8 ]   The beauty of phpspec lies in its simplicity and the ability to speed up the creation of  classes which carry along with the specification.  The basic steps involved in describing and creating a class with phpspec  Specifying with phpspec At the core of phpspec is the ability to allow us to specify the behavior of   entities and simultaneously test them. By simply specifying what the business   rules are as given by the customer, we can easily create tests for each business   rule. However, the real power of phpspec lies in how it uses an expressive,   natural language syntax. Let's take a look at the business rules that were   previously given to us regarding reservations:     The start date of the reservation must come before the end date    A reservation cannot be made for more than fifteen days    A reservation cannot include more than four rooms  [ 9 ]   Run the following command:   phpspec describe MyCompany Accommodation ReservationValidator  phpspec will produce the following output for the preceding command:  <?php  namespace spec\MyCompany\Accommodation;  use PhpSpec\ObjectBehavior; use Prophecy\Argument;  class ReservationSpec extends ObjectBehavior {     function it_is_initializable       {         $this->shouldHaveType 'MyCompany\Accommodation\Reservation' ;     } }  Then, run phpspec by using the following command:   phpspec run  phpspec will respond as usual with the following output:  Do you want me to create     'MyCompany\Accommodation\ReservationValidator' for you?  Then, phpspec will create the ReservationValidator class, as follows:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Accommodation;   class ReservationValidator {  }  Let's create a validate   function that will take the following parameters:     A start date string that determines the start of the reservation    An end date string that determines the end of the reservation    An array of room objects to add to the reservation  [ 10 ]   The following is the code snippet that creates the validate   function:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Accommodation;  use Carbon\Carbon;  class ReservationValidator {          public function validate $start_date, $end_date, $rooms      {     }  }  We will include the Carbon class, which will help us to work with the dates.   For the first business rule, which states that the start date of the reservation   must come before the end date, we can now create our first specification method   in the ReservationValidatorSpec class, as follows:  function its_start_date_must_come_before_the_end_date     $start_date,$end_date,$room  {     $rooms = [$room];     $start_date = '2015-06-03';     $end_date = '2015-06-03';     $this->shouldThrow '\InvalidArgumentException'         ->duringValidate  $start_date, $end_date, $rooms ; }  In the preceding function, phpspec starts the specification with it or its. phpspec  uses the snake case for high legibility, and start_date_must_be_less_than_the_ end_date is an exact copy of the specification. Isn't this just wonderful?  When $start_date, $end_date, and the room are passed, they automatically  get mocked. Nothing else is needed. We will create a $rooms array that is valid.  However, we will set the $start_date and $end_date in such a way that they both  have the same values to cause the test to fail. The expression syntax is shown in  the preceding code. The shouldThrow comes before during, which then takes the  method name Validate.   [ 11 ]   We have given phpspec what it needs to automatically create the validate    method for us. We will specify that $this, which is the ReservationValidator  class, will throw an InvalidArgumentException. Run the following command:   phpspec run  Once again, phpspec asks us the following:   Do you want me to create     'MyCompany\Accommodation\Reservation::validate  '      for you?  By simply typing Y at the prompt, the method is created inside the  ReservationValidator class. It is that easy. When phpspec is run again, it  will fail because the method has not thrown an exception yet. So now, the code  needs to be written. Inside the function, we will create two Carbon objects  from a string that is formatted like "2015-06-02" so that we are able to harness  the power of Carbon's powerful date comparisons. In this case, we will use the  $date1->diffInDays $date2 ; method to test whether the difference between  the $end and the $start is less than one. If this is the case, we will throw the  InvalidArgumentException and display a user-friendly message. Now, when we  rerun phpspec, the test will pass:  $end = Carbon::createFromFormat 'Y-m-d', $end_date ; $start = Carbon::createFromFormat 'Y-m-d', $start_date ;          if  $end->diffInDays $start <1  {             throw new \InvalidArgumentException 'Requires end date to  be greater than start date.' ;         }  Red, green, refactor The rules of test-driven development call for red, green, refactor, which means that  once the tests pass  green , we should try to refactor or simplify the code inside the  method without altering the functionality.  Have a look at the if test:  if   $end->diffInDays $start  < 1   {  [ 12 ]   The preceding code isn't quite readable. We can refactor it in the following way:  if  !$end->diffInDays $start >0   However, even the preceding code is not very legible, and we are also using an  integer directly in the code.  Let's move 0 into a constant. To improve the readability, we'll change it to the  minimum amount of days required for a reservation, as follows:   const MINIMUM_STAY_LENGTH = 1;  Let's extract the comparison into a method, as follows:       **      * @param $end      * @param $start      * @return bool      *      private function endDateIsGreaterThanStartDate $end, $start      {         return $end->diffInDays $start  >= MINIMUM_STAY_LENGTH;     }  We can now write the if statement like this:  if  !$this->endDateIsGreaterThanStartDate $end, $start    The preceding statement is much more expressive and readable.  Now, for the next rule, which states that a reservation cannot be made for more than  fifteen days, we'll need to create the method in the following way:  function it_cannot_be_made_for_more_than_fifteen_days User $user,  $start_date, $end_date, Room $room  {         $start_date = '2015-06-01';         $end_date = '2015-07-30';         $rooms = [$room];         $this->shouldThrow '\InvalidArgumentException'          ->duringCreateNew  $user,$start_date,$end_date,$rooms ; }  [ 13 ]   Here, we set the $end_date so that it is assigned a date that occurs more  than a month after the $start_date to cause the method to throw an  InvalidArgumentException. Once again, upon execution of the phpspec command,  the test will fail. Let's modify the existing method to check the date range. We'll add  the following code to the method:    if  $end->diffInDays $start >15  {        throw new \InvalidArgumentException 'Cannot reserve a room        for more than fifteen  15  days.' ;   }  Once again, phpspec happily runs all the tests successfully. Refactoring, we will once  again extract the if condition and create the constant, as follows:     const MAXIMUM_STAY_LENGTH = 15;     **      * @param $end      * @param $start      * @return bool      *      private function daysAreGreaterThanMaximumAllowed         $end, $start      {         return $end->diffInDays $start  >             self::MAXIMUM_STAY_LENGTH;     }     if  $this->daysAreGreaterThanMaximumAllowed $end, $start   {             throw new \InvalidArgumentException                 'Cannot reserve a room for more                 than fifteen  15  days.' ;    }  Tidying things up We could leave things like this, but let's clean it up since we have tests. Since the   endDateIsGreaterThanStartDate $end, $start  and daysAreGreaterThanMaxi mumAllowed $end, $start  functions both check for the minimum and maximum  allowed stay respectively, we can call them from another method.   [ 14 ]   We will refactor endDateIsGreaterThanStartDate   into daysAreLessThanMini mumAllowed $end, $start  and then create another method that checks both the  minimum and maximum stay length, as follows:  private function daysAreWithinAcceptableRange $end, $start      {         if  $this->daysAreLessThanMinimumAllowed $end, $start               $this->daysAreGreaterThanMaximumAllowed                 $end, $start   {            return false;         } else {            return true;         }     }  This leaves us with simply one function, instead of two, in the createNew function,  as follows:  if  !$this->daysAreWithinAcceptableRange $end, $start   {             throw new \InvalidArgumentException 'Requires                 a stay length from '                 . self::MINIMUM_STAY_LENGTH . ' to '.                     self::MAXIMUM_STAY_LENGTH . ' days.' ;         }  For the third rule, which states that a reservation cannot contain more than four  rooms, the process is the same. Create the specification, as follows:  it_cannot_contain_than_four_rooms  The change here will be in the parameters. This time, we will mock five rooms so   that the test will fail, as follows:  function it_cannot_contain_than_four_rooms User $user,     $start_date, $end_date, Room $room1, Room $room2, Room     $room3, Room $room4, Room $room5   Five room objects will be loaded into the $rooms array, and the test will fail   as follows:  $rooms = [$room1, $room2, $room3, $room4, $room5];     $this->shouldThrow '\InvalidArgumentException'         ->duringCreateNew $user,$start_date,$end_date,$rooms ;     }  [ 15 ]   After adding code to check the size of the array, the final class will look like this:  <?php  namespace MyCompany\Accommodation;  use Carbon\Carbon; class ReservationValidator {      const MINIMUM_STAY_LENGTH = 1;     const MAXIMUM_STAY_LENGTH = 15;     const MAXIMUM_ROOMS = 4;       **      * @param $start_date      * @param $end_date      * @param $rooms      * @return $this      *      public function validate $start_date, $end_date, $rooms      {         $end = Carbon::createFromFormat 'Y-m-d', $end_date ;         $start = Carbon::createFromFormat 'Y-m-d', $start_date ;          if  !$this->daysAreWithinAcceptableRange $end, $start   {             throw new \InvalidArgumentException                 'Requires a stay length from '                 . self::MINIMUM_STAY_LENGTH . ' to '.                     self::MAXIMUM_STAY_LENGTH . ' days.' ;         }         if  !is_array $rooms   {             throw new \InvalidArgumentException 'Requires last                 parameter rooms to be an array.' ;         }         if  $this->tooManyRooms $rooms   {             throw new \InvalidArgumentException 'Cannot reserve                 more than '. self::MAXIMUM_ROOMS .' rooms.' ;         }          return $this;  [ 16 ]       }       **      * @param $end      * @param $start      * @return bool      *      private function daysAreLessThanMinimumAllowed $end, $start      {         return $end->diffInDays $start  <             self::MINIMUM_STAY_LENGTH;     }       **      * @param $end      * @param $start      * @return bool      *      private function daysAreGreaterThanMaximumAllowed         $end, $start      {         return $end->diffInDays $start  >             self::MAXIMUM_STAY_LENGTH;     }       **      * @param $end      * @param $start      * @return bool      *      private function daysAreWithinAcceptableRange $end, $start      {         if  $this->daysAreLessThanMinimumAllowed $end, $start               $this->daysAreGreaterThanMaximumAllowed                 $end, $start   {             return false;         } else {             return true;         }     }  [ 17 ]        **      * @param $rooms      * @return bool      *      private function tooManyRooms $rooms      {         return count $rooms  > self::MAXIMUM_ROOMS;     }      public function rooms  {         return $this->belongsToMany 'MyCompany\Accommodation            \Room' ->withTimestamps  ;     }  }  The method is very clean. There are only two if statements—the first to verify that  the date range is valid, and other one to verify that the number of rooms is within the  valid range. The constants are easily accessible and can be changed as the business  requirements change. Clearly, the addition of phpspec into the development  workflow combines what earlier required two steps—writing the assertions with  PHPUnit and then writing the code. Now, we will leave phpspec and move on  to Artisan, which developers are familiar with as it was a feature of the previous  versions of Laravel.  Controllers Next, we'll create some sample controllers. At the time of writing this book, we need  to use Artisan and phpspec together. Let's create a controller for the room entity, as  follows:  $ php artisan make:controller RoomController  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;  use MyCompany\Http\Requests; use MyCompany\Http\Controllers\Controller;  use Illuminate\Http\Request; class RoomController extends Controller {  [ 18 ]            **         * Display a listing of the resource.         *         * @return Response         *          public function index           {}           **         * Show the form for creating a new resource.         *         * @return Response         *          public function create           {}           **         * Store a newly created resource in storage.         *         * @return Response         *          public function store           {} ….          }  Note that this will be created in app Http Controllers directory,  which is a new location for Laravel 5. The new HTTP directory houses  the controllers, middleware, and requests directories, grouping together  the files related to the HTTP request or the actual request. Additionally,  this directory configuration is optional, and routes can call any  autoloaded location, usually through a namespaced PSR-4 structure.  [ 19 ]   The command bus Laravel 5 has adopted the command bus pattern, which creates commands that  get created in the app Commands directory. Whereas commands in Laravel 4 were  thought of as command-line tools, in Laravel 5, the command is thought of as a class  whose methods can be used from within the application, allowing for an excellent  reuse of code. The concept of a command here is a task that needs to be done, or in  our example, a room to be reserved for a user. The paradigm of a bus then transports  the command using the new DispatchesCommands trait, which is used in the base  controller class. Every controller created by Artisan extends this class to a handler  method, where the actual work is performed.  To use Laravel's command bus design pattern, we'll now use Artisan to create a few  commands. We'll go into detail about commands in a future chapter, but to begin, we  will type the following command:  $ php artisan make:commandReserveRoomCommand --handler  Typing this creates a command to reserve a room which could be called from  anywhere in the code, isolating the business logic from the controllers and models,  and also allowing the command to be executed in an asynchronous mode.  <?php namespace MyCompany\Commands;  use MyCompany\Commands\Command;  class ReserveRoomCommand extends Command {       **     * Create a new command instance.     *     * @return void     *      public function __construct       {                }  }  <?php namespace MyCompany\Commands;  use MyCompany\Commands\Command; use MyCompany\User;  [ 20 ]  After filling in the details of the command, the class will now look like this:   class ReserveRoomCommand extends Command {      public $user;     public $rooms;     public $start_date;     public $end_date;       **     * Create a new command instance.     *     * @return void     *      public function __construct User $user,         $start_date, $end_date, $rooms      {         $this->rooms = $rooms;         $this->user = $user;         $this->start_date = $start_date;         $this->end_date = $end_date;     }  }  <?php namespace MyCompany\Handlers\Commands;  use MyCompany\Commands\ReserveRoomCommand;  use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;  class ReserveRoomCommandHandler {       **     * Create the command handler.     *     * @return void     *   [ 21 ]  The --handler parameter creates an additional class, ReserveRoomCommandHandler,  containing a constructor and a handle method, which injects the  ReserveRoomCommand. This file will be present in the app Handlers Commands  directory. If the --handler flag is not used, then the ReserveRoomCommand class will  contain its own handler method, and the separate handler class will not get created:       public function __construct       {                }       **     * Handle the command.     *     * @paramReserveRoomCommand  $command     * @return void     *      public function handle ReserveRoomCommand $command      {                }  }  We will fill in the handle method with the validation of the reservation, as follows:  public function handle ReserveRoomCommand $command      {         $reservation = new             \MyCompany\Accommodation\ReservationValidator  ;         $reservation->validate          $command->start_date, $command->             end_date, $command->rooms ;     }   Summary phpspec adds a mature, robust, test-first, test-driven, and a specification-by-example  approach to creating the business logic aspect of the software. This, coupled with  the ease of creation of models, controllers, commands, events, and event handlers,  sets Laravel at the front of the PHP framework race. Also, it has adopted many best  practices that are used by the best programmers in the industry.  In this chapter, we learned how to use phpspec to easily design classes and their  accompanying tests from the command line. This workflow, accompanied by  Artisan, makes the process of setting up the basic structure of a Laravel 5 application  very easy.  In the next chapter, we'll take a look at database migrations, the mechanics behind  them, and ways to create a seed for testing.  [ 22 ]   Automating Tests – Migrating  and Seeding Your Database  So far, we have created some base models and the general outline of the database.  Now, we need to create database migrations and seeding. Traditionally, database  "dump" files have been used as a way to pass around both the schema, which is  the structure of the tables, and the data, which would be the initial or predefined  records, such as default values; unchanging lists, such as cities or countries; and  users such as "admin". These dump files that contain SQL can be committed to  source code control. This is not always the best way to maintain the integrity of the  database; since every time a developer adds records or modifies the database, all of  the developers in the team would need to drop and recreate the database or add or  delete the data, tables, rows, columns, or indexes manually. Migrations allow the  database to live in the form of code, actually residing inside the Laravel project, as  well as to be versioned within source code control.  Migrations are run from the command line and can also be automated to  automatically create the database, whenever required if it doesn't already exist, or  drop and recreate the tables and populate the tables if they already exist. Migrations  have existed for a while in Laravel, so their presence in Laravel 5 is not surprising.  Using Laravel's migration feature The first step is to run the artisan command:  $ php artisan migrate:install  [ 23 ]   This will create a table named migration, which has two columns: migration,  which is a varchar 255 in MySQL, and batch, which is an integer. This table will be  used by Laravel to keep track of which migrations have been run. In other words, it  maintains a history of all of the operations that have been performed. The following  is a list of the main operations:     install: As mentioned earlier, this operation installs    refresh: This operation resets and reruns all of the migrations     reset: This operation rolls back all of migrations    rollback: This operation is a type of "undo", and simply rolls back the last   operation     status: This operation produces a table-like output of the migrations and   states whether or not they have been run  An example of migration Laravel 5 contains two migrations in the  database migrations directory.  The first migration creates the users table.  The second one creates the password_resets table, which, as you may have  guessed, is used to recover lost passwords. Unless specified, the migrations operate  on the database that is configured in the  config database.php configuration file:  <?php  use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint; use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;  class CreateUsersTable extends Migration {     **    * Run the migrations.    *    * @return void    *    public function up     {     Schema::create 'users', function Blueprint $table      {  [ 24 ]         $table->smallIncrements 'id' ->unsigned  ;       $table->string 'name' ;       $table->string 'email' ->unique  ;       $table->string 'password', 60 ;       $table->rememberToken  ;       $table->timestamps  ;       $table->softDeletes  ;     } ;   }     **    * Reverse the migrations.    *    * @return void    *    public function down     {     Schema::drop 'users' ;   }  }  Migrations extend the Migration class and use the Blueprint class.  There are two methods: up and down, which are used when the migrate commands  and the rollback commands are used, respectively. The Schema::create   method  is called with the table name as the first parameter and a function callback as the  second parameter, which accepts an instance of a Blueprint object as a parameter.  Creating the table The $table object has a few methods that perform tasks such as creating indexes,  setting up auto-increment fields, stating which type of fields should be created, and  passing the name of the field as a parameter.  The first command is used to create an auto-increment field id, which will be   the primary key of the table. Then, string fields, such as name, email, and password  are created. Note that the unique method is chained to the create statement for   the email field, stating that the email field will be used as the login name user ID,  as this is a common practice in most modern web applications. The rememberToken  is used to allow the user to remain authenticated per each session. This token gets  reset on each login and logout, protecting the user from a potentially malicious  hijacking attempt.  [ 25 ]   The Laravel migration magic Laravel migrations are also capable of creating timestamp fields that are used to  automatically store creation and update information for each model through its   table row.  $table->timestamps  ; The following line of code tells the migration to automatically create two columns  in the table, namely created_at and updated_at, which is automatically used by  Laravel's Eloquent Object-relational mapping  ORM  to allow the application to  know when the object was created and when it was updated:  $table->timestamps    In the following example, the fields are updated as follows:   * *   created_at is set with timestamps *  $user = new User  ; $user->email = "johndoe@acmewidgets.com"; $user->name = "John Doe"; $user->save  ;    created_at is set with timestamps   * *   updated_at is set with timestamps *  $user = User::find 1 ;   where 1 is the $id $user->email = "johndoe@acmeenterprise.com"; $user->save  ;   updated_at is updated  Another great Laravel feature is the soft delete field. This provides a type of recycle  bin to allow the data to be optionally restored at a later time. This feature simply adds another column to the table to allow soft deleting of the  data. The code to be added to the migration looks like this:  $table->softDeletes  ;  [ 26 ]   This adds a column to the database, deleted_at, which will either have null  as its value or a timestamp to indicate when the record was deleted. This builds a  recycle bin feature right into your database application.  Run the following command:  $ php artisan migrate  The migration is initiated and the tables are created. The migration table now  appears, as shown in the following screenshot:  The structure of the users table is shown in the following screenshot:  To rollback the migration, run the following command:  $ php artisan migrate:rollback  The rollback command uses the migration table to determine which actions to  rollback. In this case, the migrations table, after it has been run, is now empty.  [ 27 ]   From schema to migration A common situation that occurs during the development process is that a schema  is created, and then, we need to create a migration from that schema. At the time of  writing, there is no official tool to do this in the Laravel core, but there are several  packages available.  One such package is the migrations-generator package.  First, add the following line to the require-dev section of the composer.json file to  require the migrations-generator dependency in the composer.json file:  "require-dev": {     "phpunit phpunit": "~4.0",     "phpspec phpspec": "~2.1",     "xethron migrations-generator": "dev-feature laravel-five-stable",     "way generators": "dev-feature laravel-five-stable"   },  It is also necessary to add the following text to the composer.json file at the   root level:  "repositories": [   {     "type": "git",     "url": "git@github.com:jamisonvalenta Laravel-4-Generators.git"   }],  Composer's require-dev command The require-dev command, as opposed to require, is a mechanism of a composer  that allows certain packages that are needed only in the development phase. Most  testing tools and migration tools will only be used in the local development machine,  QA machine, and or in a continuous integration environment, but not in the  production environment. This mechanism keeps your production installation free of  unnecessary packages.  Laravel's providers array Laravel's providers array in the config app.php file lists the providers that are  available to Laravel at all times.   [ 28 ]   We will add both the way generator and the Xethron migration service  providers:  'providers' => [           *          * Laravel Framework Service Providers...          *            Illuminate\Foundation\Providers\              ArtisanServiceProvider::class,           Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider::class,           Illuminate\Broadcasting\BroadcastServiceProvider::class,         ...     'Way\Generators\GeneratorsServiceProvider',     'Xethron\MigrationsGenerator\        MigrationsGeneratorServiceProvider' ]  The composer update command The composer update command is a simple, yet powerful way to make sure that  everything that needs to be in place is actually working and free of errors. After  running this command, we're now ready to run the migrations.  Generating the migrations Simply type the following command:  $ php artisan  The artisan command will display a list of all of the possible commands. The  migrate:generate command should be included on the list of valid commands. If  this command is not on the list, then something is not configured correctly.  Once you confirm that the migrate:generate command exists in the list, simply run  the following command:  $ php artisan migrate:generate  This will start the process.   In this example, we have used the MySQL database. By entering Y when prompted,  the process will begin and the output should show one migration file created for  each table in the database.

[ 30 ]   Migration anatomy Consider an example of one of the lines in the migration file; we can see that the table  object is used in a chain of methods. The following line of the migration file sets up  the state attributes in the location eloquent attribute in the locations table:  $table->smallInteger 'state_id' ->unsigned  ->index 'state_id' ;  List tables Often, it is necessary to create or import a list of finite items that usually remain  constant, such as cities, states, countries, and similar items. Let's call these list tables  or lookup tables. In these tables, the ID should usually be positive. These lists  may grow, but they usually will not have any data that is deleted or updated. The  smallInteger type is used to keep the table small and also represent a value that  belongs to a finite list, something that will not grow naturally. The next method,  unsigned, states that the limit will be 65535. This value should be enough to  represent most of the states, provinces, or similar types of geographical regions  where a hotel could be located. The last method in the chain adds an index to the  database column. This is essential in list tables like these, which are used in the  select statements or in the read statements. The Read statements will be discussed  in Chapter 9, Scaling Laravel. It is important to use unsigned, as it doubles the positive  limit, which otherwise would be 32767. Using the index, we can speed up the look  up time and access a cached version of the data in the table.  The softDelete and timestamp properties Regarding softDeletes and timestamps for list tables, it depends. If the table is  not very large, it shouldn't be too harmful to keep track of any updates, inserts, or  deletions if they do happen; however, if the list consists of countries, where changes  occur infrequently and are very small, it would be prudent to omit softDeletes and  timestamps. So, the entire table will probably fit into the memory and will be very  fast. To omit timestamps, it's necessary to add the following line of code:  public $timestamps = false;  [ 31 ]   Creating seeds To create our database seeder, we will modify the DatabaseSeeder class that  extends Seeder. The name of the file is database seeds DatabaseSeeder.php.   The contents of the file will be as follows:  <?php  use Illuminate\Database\Seeder; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class DatabaseSeeder extends Seeder {       **      * Run the database seeds.      *      * @return void      *      public function run       {         Model::unguard  ;            create a user         $user = new \MyCompany\User  ;         $user->id=1;         $user->email = "testing@tester.com";         $user->password = Hash::make 'p@ssw0rd' ;         $user->save  ;            create a country         $country = new \MyCompany\Accommodation\Location\State;         $country->name = "United States";         $country->id = 236;         $country->save  ;            create a state         $state = new \MyCompany\Accommodation\Location\State;         $state->name = "Pennsylvania";         $state->id = 1;         $state->save  ;  [ 32 ]             create a city         $city = new \MyCompany\Accommodation\Location\City;         $city->name = "Pittsburgh";         $city->save  ;            create a location         $location = new \MyCompany\Accommodation\Location;         $location->city_id = $city->id;         $location->state_id = $state->id;         $location->country_id = 236;         $location->latitude = 40.44;         $location->longitude = 80;         $location->code = '15212';         $location->address_1 = "100 Main Street";         $location->save  ;            create a new accommodation         $accommodation = new \MyCompany\Accommodation;         $accommodation->name = "Royal Plaza Hotel";         $accommodation->location_id = $location;         $accommodation->description = "A modern, 4-star hotel";         $accommodation->save  ;            create a room         $room1 = new \MyCompany\Accommodation\Room;         $room1->room_number= 'A01';         $room1->accommodation_id = $accommodation->id;         $room1->save  ;            create another room         $room2 = new \MyCompany\Accommodation\Room;         $room2->room_number= 'A02';         $room2->accommodation_id = $accommodation->id;         $room2->save  ;            create the room array         $rooms = [$room1,$room2];              }  }  [ 33 ]   The seeder file sets up the very basic possible scenario. For initial testing, we don't  need to even add every country, state, city, and location possible to the database; we  simply need to add the essential information to create various scenarios. To create a  new reservation; for example, we will create an instance of each of the user, country,  state, city, location, and accommodation models, and then create two rooms, which  are added to an array of rooms.  Let's create a repository for the reservation that will implement a very simple  repository interface:  <?php  <?php  namespace MyCompany\Accommodation;  interface RepositoryInterface {     public function create $attributes ; }  Now let's create ReservationRepository, which implements  RepositoryInterface:  namespace MyCompany\Accommodation;  class ReservationRepository implements RepositoryInterface {     private $reservation;      function __construct $reservation      {         $this->reservation = $reservation;     }      public function create $attributes      {         $this->reservation->create $attributes ;         return $this->reservation;     } }  [ 34 ]   Now, we will create the method that is needed to create the reservation and also to  populate the pivot table, reservation_room:  public function create $attributes  {      $modelAttributes= array_except $attributes, ['rooms'] ;      $reservation = $this->reservationModel->create $modelAttributes ;     if  isset $attributes['rooms']    {         $reservation->rooms  ->sync $attributes['rooms'] ;     }     return $reservation; }  The array_except   Laravel helper is used to return the  attributes array, except for the $rooms array, which will be  used for the sync   function.  Here, we set each attribute of the model to the attributes that are set in the method.  We will need to add the method that will establish the many-to-many relationship  between the reservations and rooms:  public function rooms  {     return $this->belongsToMany 'MyCompany\Accommodation\Room' - >withTimestamps  ; }  In this case, we need to add withTimestamps   to the relationship so that the  timestamps will be updated, indicating when the relationship was saved in the  reservation_room pivot table.  Database testing with PHPUnit PHPUnit is well integrated with Laravel 5 as it was with Laravel 4, so it is rather easy  to set up the testing environment. A good method for testing would be to use the  SQLite database and to set it up to reside in the memory, but you need to modify the  config database.php file, as follows:      'default' => 'sqlite',        'connections' => array          'sqlite' => array   [ 35 ]               'driver'   => 'sqlite',             'database' => ':memory:',             'prefix'   => '',          ,      ,  Then, we need to modify the phpunit.xml file to set a DB_DRIVER environment  variable:                                               Then, we need to modify the following line in the config database.php file:  'default' => 'mysql',  We modify the preceding line to match with the following line:  'default' => env 'DB_DRIVER', 'mysql' ,  Now, we will set up PHPUnit to run our migrations on the in-memory   sqlite database.  In the tests directory, there are two classes: a TestCase class that extends the  LaravelTestCase class and an ExampleTest class that extends the TestCase class.  We need to add two methods to TestCase to perform the migrations, run the seeder,  and then revert the database back to its original state:  <?php  class TestCase extends Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase {      public function setUp       {         parent::setUp  ;         Artisan::call 'migrate' ;         Artisan::call 'db:seed' ;     }       **  [ 36 ]   Now, we will create a PHPUnit test to verify that the data is being saved correctly in  the database. We need to modify tests ExampleTest.php to the following code:      * Creates the application.     *     * @return \Illuminate\Foundation\Application     *      public function createApplication       {         $app = require __DIR__.' .. bootstrap app.php';         $app->make 'Illuminate\Contracts\Console\            Kernel' ->bootstrap  ;         return $app;     }      public function tearDown       {         Artisan::call 'migrate:rollback' ;     } }  <?php  class ExampleTest extends TestCase {       **     * A basic functional test example.     *     * @return void     *       public function testReserveRoomExample       {          $reservationRepository = new             \MyCompany\Accommodation\ReservationRepository              new \MyCompany\Accommodation\Reservation   ;         $reservationValidator = new             \MyCompany\Accommodation\ReservationValidator  ;         $start_date = '2015-10-01';         $end_date = '2015-10-10';         $rooms = \MyCompany\Accommodation\            Room::take 2 ->lists 'id' ->toArray  ;  [ 37 ]           if  $reservationValidator->            validate $start_date,$end_date,$rooms   {             $reservation = $reservationRepository-                >create ['date_start'=>$start_date,                'date_end'=>$end_date,'rooms'=>$rooms,                'reservation_number'=>'0001'] ;         }          $this->assertInstanceOf '\MyCompany\            Accommodation\Reservation',$reservation ;         $this->assertEquals '2015-10-01',            $reservation->date_start ;         $this->assertEquals 2,count $reservation->rooms  ; }  Running PHPUnit To start PHPUnit, simply type the following command:  $ phpunit  The tests will be run. Since the create method of the Reservation class returns a  reservation, we may use the assertInstanceOf method of PHPUnit to determine  whether or not a reservation was created in the database. We can add any other  assertions to make sure that the values saved are exactly what we intended. For  example, we can assert that the start date is equal to '2015-10-01' and the size of the  room array is equal to two. Together with the testBasicExample   method, we can  ensure that a GET request to " " returns a 200. The PHPUnit results will look like this:  [ 38 ]   Notice that there were two dots to represent the tests. OK means that nothing  failed, and we are told again that there were two tests and four assertions;  one assertion in the example and the other three, which we have added to our  testReserveRoomExample test. Had we tested that there were three rooms instead  of two, PHPUnit would have produced the following output:  $ phpunit  PHPUnit 4.5.0 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.  Configuration read from  var www laravel.example phpunit.xml  .  F  Time: 1.59 seconds, Memory: 10.75Mb  There was 1 failure:  1  ExampleTest::testReserveRoomExample  Failed asserting that 2 matches expected 3.   var www laravel.example tests ExampleTest.php:24                                         FAILURES!                              Tests: 2, Assertions: 4, Failures: 1.  Notice that instead of the second dot, we have an F for failure, and instead of OK,  we're told that there was 1 failure. PHPUnit then lists which tests failed, and nicely  tells us the line that I deliberately modified to be incorrect, as follows:     $this->assertEquals 3,count $reservationResult->rooms  ;  The preceding line is indeed incorrect:  Failed asserting that 2 matches expected 3.  Remember that 2 is the value of the count  $reservationResult->rooms .  [ 39 ]   Functional testing with Behat While phpspec follows the BDD by specification and is useful for specification  and design in isolation, its complimentary tool Behat is used for integration and  functional tests. Since phpspec suggests to mock everything, database queries  wouldn't actually be executed, as the database is outside the context of that method.  Behat is a great tool to perform behavioral testing on a certain feature. While  phpspec is already included among Laravel 5's dependencies, Behat will be installed  as an external module.  The following command should be run to install and make Behat work with   Laravel 5:  $ composer require behat behat behat mink behat mink-extension     laracasts behat-laravel-extension --dev  After running the composer update, Behat's functionality is added to Laravel. Next,  a behat.yaml file should be added to the root of the Laravel project to specify which  extensions are to be used.  Next, run the following command:  $ behat --init  This will create a features directory with a bootstrap directory inside it. A  FeaturesContext class will also be created. Everything inside bootstrap will be run  every time behat is run. This is useful to automatically run migrations and seeding.  The features bootstrap FeaturesContext.php file looks like this:  <?php  use Behat\Behat\Context\Context; use Behat\Behat\Context\SnippetAcceptingContext; use Behat\Gherkin\Node\PyStringNode; use Behat\Gherkin\Node\TableNode;   **  * Defines application features from the specific context.  *  class FeatureContext implements Context, SnippetAcceptingContext {      **      * Initializes context.      *  [ 40 ]        * Every scenario gets its own context instance.      * You can also pass arbitrary arguments to the      * context constructor through behat.yml.      *      public function __construct       {     } }  Next, the FeatureContext class needs to extend the MinkContext class, so the class  definition line will need to be modified as follows:  class FeatureContext implements Context, SnippetAcceptingContext  Next, the prepare and cleanup methods will be added to the class in order  to perform the migrations. We will add the @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite  annotations to tell Behat to perform the migration and seeding before each suite  and migrate to rollback in order to restore the database to its original state after  each suite. Using annotations in the doc-block will be discussed in Chapter 6, Taming  Complexity with Annotations. Our class now is structured as follows:  <?php  use Behat\Behat\Context\Context; use Behat\Behat\Context\SnippetAcceptingContext; use Behat\Gherkin\Node\PyStringNode; use Behat\Gherkin\Node\TableNode;   **  * Defines application features from the specific context.  *  class FeatureContext implements Context, SnippetAcceptingContext {      **      * Initializes context.      *      * Every scenario gets its own context instance.      * You can also pass arbitrary arguments to the      * context constructor through behat.yml.      *      public function __construct       {     }  [ 41 ]         **      * @BeforeSuite      *       public static function prepare SuiteEvent $event       {         Artisan::call 'migrate' ;         Artisan::call 'db:seed' ;       }        **      * @AfterSuite       *       public function cleanup ScenarioEvent $event       {         Artisan::call 'migrate:rollback' ;      } }  Now, a feature file needs to be created. Create reservation.feature in the room  directory:  Feature: Reserve Room   In order to verify the reservation system   As an accommodation reservation user   I need to be able to create a reservation in the system   Scenario: Reserve a Room    When I create a reservation          Then I should have one reservation  When behat is run as follows:  $ behat  The following output is produced:  Feature: Reserve Room    In order to verify the reservation system    As an accommodation reservation user    I need to be able to create a reservation in the system    Scenario: List 2 files in a directory  features reservation.feature:5      When I create a reservation  [ 42 ]   --- FeatureContext has missing steps.

Notice that camel case is used instead of snake case. This  code should be copied in to the FeatureContext class. Notice that, by default, an  exception is thrown.  Here, the RESTful API will be called, so the guzzle HTTP package will need to be  added to the project:  $ composer require guzzlehttp guzzle  Next, add an attribute to the class to hold the guzzle object. We will add a POST  request to a RESTful resource controller to create a reservation and expect a 201 code.  Notice that the return code is a string and needs to be casted to an integer. Next, a  get is performed to return all of the reservations.   [ 43 ]   There should only be one reservation created, since the migration and seeding run  every time:  <?php  use Behat\Behat\Context\Context; use Behat\Behat\Context\SnippetAcceptingContext; use Behat\Gherkin\Node\PyStringNode; use Behat\Gherkin\Node\TableNode; use Behat\MinkExtension\Context\MinkContext; use Behat\Testwork\Hook\Scope\BeforeSuiteScope; use Behat\Testwork\Hook\Scope\AfterSuiteScope; use GuzzleHttp\Client;   **  * Defines application features from the specific context.  *  class FeatureContext extends MinkContext     implements Context, SnippetAcceptingContext {      **      * Initializes context.      *      * Every scenario gets its own context instance.      * You can also pass arbitrary arguments to the      * context constructor through behat.yml.      *      protected $httpClient;      public function __construct       {         $this->httpClient = new Client  ;     }      **      * @BeforeSuite      *      public static function prepare BeforeSuiteScope $scope      {         Artisan::call 'migrate' ;         Artisan::call 'db:seed' ;      }  [ 44 ]        **      * @When I create a reservation      *      public function iCreateAReservation       {         $request = $this->httpClient->post             'http:  laravel.example reservations',['body'=>             ['start_date'=>'2015-04-01','end_date'=>'            2015-04-04','rooms[]'=>'100']] ;         if   int $request->getStatusCode  !==201          {             throw new Exception 'A successfully created                 status code must be returned' ;         }     }       **      * @Then I should have one reservation      *      public function iShouldHaveOneReservation       {         $request = $this->httpClient->get             'http:  laravel.example reservations' ;         $arr = json_decode $request->getBody   ;         if  count $arr !==1          {             throw new Exception 'there must be                 exactly one reservation' ;         }     }       **      * @AfterSuite      *      public static function cleanup AfterSuiteScope $scope      {         Artisan::call 'migrate:rollback' ;     } }       **      * @When I create a reservation      *   [ 45 ]       public function iCreateAReservation       {         $request = $this->httpClient->post             'http:  laravel.example reservations',['body'=>             ['start_date'=>'2015-04-01','end_date'=>            '2015-04-04','rooms[]'=>'100']] ;         if   int $request->getStatusCode  !==201          {             throw new Exception 'A successfully created                 status code must be returned' ;         }     }  Now, to create ReservationController, use artisan from the command line:  $ php artisan make:controller ReservationsController  Here are the contents of the reservation controller:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;  use MyCompany\Http\Requests; use MyCompany\Http\Controllers\Controller; use Illuminate\Http\Request; use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response; use MyCompany\Accommodation\ReservationRepository; use MyCompany\Accommodation\ReservationValidator; use MyCompany\Accommodation\Reservation;  class ReservationsController extends Controller {       **     * Display a listing of the resource.     *     * @return Response     *      public function index       {         return Reservation::all  ;     }       **     * Store a newly created resource in storage.     *  [ 46 ]       * @return Response     *      public function store       {         $reservationRepository = new             ReservationRepository new Reservation   ;         $reservationValidator = new ReservationValidator  ;         if  $reservationValidator->validate             \Input::get 'start_date' ,         \Input::get 'end_date' ,\Input::get 'rooms'            {         $reservationRepository->create             ['date_start'=>\Input::get 'start_date' ,'date_end'=>            \Input::get 'end_date' ,'rooms'=>\Input::get 'rooms' ] ;         return response '', '201' ;         }     } }  Lastly, add ReservationController to the routes.php file, which is located in  app Http routes.php:  Route::resource 'reservations','ReservationController' ;  Now, when behat is run, the result is as follows:  Feature: Reserve Room    In order to verify the reservation system    As an accommodation reservation user    I need to be able to create a reservation in the system    Scenario: Reserve a Room      When I create a reservation          FeatureContext::iCreateAReserva tion        Then I should have one reservation   FeatureContext::iShouldHaveOneR eservation    1 scenario  1 passed   2 steps  2 passed   [ 47 ]   Summary Configuring Laravel to create migration files from the existing schemas is also a  useful framework for non-greenfield projects. By running both the migrations and  seeding in the testing environment, each test can benefit from a completely clean  version of the database, and the initial data that allows it to have "just enough" in  the database to minimally verify that the software performs as it needs to. When  legacy code needs to be ported to Laravel, PHPUnit can be used to test any existing  functions. Behat provides a behavioral-based alternative, which can skillfully  perform end-to-end testing.  We designed our classes using phpspec in an isolated environment, concentrating  only on the business rules and client's requests while mocking things, such as the  actual entities, such as rooms. We then verified that the actual queries were executed  and saved in the database correctly by the use of a functional testing testing tool,  PHPUnit. Finally, we used Behat to perform end-to-end testing.  In the next chapter, we'll see the creation of a RESTful API, the basic CRUD  operations  create, read, update, and delete , and discuss some best practices.  [ 48 ]   Building Services,  Commands, and Events  In the first two chapters, we set up the basic structure of our accommodation  reservation system. We designed our classes, created our database schema,   and learned how to test them. Now we need to translate the business requirements  into code.  In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:     Commands    Events    Command handlers    Event handlers    Queued event handlers    Queued commands    Console commands    The command scheduler  Request routing As mentioned earlier, Laravel 5 has adopted the command bus pattern. Laravel 4  viewed commands as something to be executed from the command line, whereas in  Laravel 5, a command can be used in any context, allowing excellent reuse of code.  [ 49 ]   The following is an example of the Laravel 4 HTTP request flow:  Here is an example of the Laravel 5 HTTP request flow:  The first image illustrates the Laravel 4 request flow. The request via HTTP was  handled by the router, and then sent to the controller, where generally, we could  then talk to either the repository or directory of the model. In Laravel 5, this is still  possible; however, as shown in the second image, we can see that the ability to  add additional blocks, layers, or modules allows us to separate the life cycle of the  request into individual isolated pieces. Laravel 4 allowed us to put all of our code  to handle the request inside the controller, while in Laravel 5, we are free to do the  same, although now we are also able to easily separate the request into various  pieces. Some of these concepts are derived from Domain-driven Design  DDD .   [ 50 ]   Inside the controller, the command is instantiated using the Data Transfer Object   DTO  paradigm. Then, the command is sent to the command bus, where it is  handled by a handler class, which has two methods: __construct   and handle  .  Inside the handler, we fire or instantiate an event. The event is likewise handled in  the same way by an event handler method with two methods: __construct     and handle  .  The directory structure is very clean and looks like this:   app Commands   app Events    app Handlers    app Handlers Commands   app Handlers Events   app HTTP Controllers  It's rather self-explanatory; the commands and events are in their respective  directories, while the handlers for each have their own directories.  Laravel 5.1 has changed the name of the app Commands directory to  app Jobs to ensure that programmers do not get the concepts of the  command bus and console commands mixed up.  User stories The idea for the command component can easily derive from a user story or a task  required by a user to achieve a goal. The most simple example would be to search   for a room:  As a hotel website user, I want to search for a room so that I can select from a list of results.  User stories, deriving from the agile methodology, guarantee that the code written  closely matches the business requirement. They often follow the pattern "As a… I  want to… so that...". This defines the actor, the intent, and the benefit. It helps us  plan how each task will be converted into code. In our example, the user stories can  transform into tasks.  [ 51 ]   As a hotel website user, I would create a list of the following tasks:  1.  As a hotel website user, I want to search for a room so that I can select    a room from a list of results.  2.  As a hotel website user, I want to reserve a room so that I can stay at    the hotel.  3.  As a hotel website user, I want to receive an e-mail with the reservation   details so that I can have a copy of the reservation.  4.  As a hotel website user, I want to be on a waiting list so that I can reserve    a room when one becomes available.  5.  As a hotel website user, I want to get notified of the room availability so    that I can reserve a room.  User stories to code The first task, searching for a room, would most likely be a RESTful call from a user  or from an external service, so this task would be exposed to our controllers and  thus, to our RESTful API.  The second task, reserving a room, is a similar action initiated by the user or the  other service. This task may require the user to be logged in.  The third task could depend on the second task. This task requires an interaction  with another process that sends the user a confirmation e-mail with the details of the  booking. We can also write this as: As a hotel website, I want to send an e-mail with the  reservation details, so that he or she may have a copy of the reservation.  The fourth task, getting placed on the waiting list, could be a command that is  executed after the request to reserve a room is launched; in the case of another  user reserving the room at the same time. It would most likely be called from the  application itself, not the user, since the user has no knowledge of the real-time  accommodation inventory. This could help us handle a race condition. Also, we  should assume that when the website user is deciding which room to reserve, there  is no locking mechanism on that room that would guarantee the availability. We  could also write this as: As a hotel website, I want to put a user on the waiting list so that  they can be notified when a room is available.  [ 52 ]   For the fifth task, as the user is put on a waiting list, the user could also be notified of  the room as it becomes available. This action checks for the availability of the rooms,  and then checks for any users on the waiting list. The user story can be rewritten as  follows: As a hotel website, I want to notify a waiting list user of the availability of the rooms  so that he or she may reserve a room. If a room becomes available, the first user on the  waiting list will be notified of the availability via an e-mail. This command would be  executed frequently, as if it is a cron job. Luckily, Laravel 5 has a new mechanism to  allow commands to be executed at a given frequency.  It becomes apparent that if the user story has to be written with both using the  website as the actor  "As a hotel website..."  or the website user as the actor  "As a  hotel website user..." , a command is useful and can be launched either from the  RESTful API  user side  or from within the Laravel application itself.  Since our first task most likely involves an external service, we will create a route and  also a controller to handle the request.  The controller The first step involves the creation of a route, and the second step involves the  creation of a controller.  Searching for the room First, let's create a route in the routes.php file and map it to the controller   method as follows:  Route::get 'search', 'RoomController@search' ;  The request parameters, such as the start end dates and location details will be   as follows:  {   "start_date": "2015-07-10"   "end_date": "2015-07-17"   "city": "London"   "country": "England" }  The search parameters will be sent as JSON-encoded objects. They will be sent   as follows:  http:  websiteurl.com search?query={%22start_date%22:    %222015-07-10%22,%22end_date%22:%222015-07-17%22,    %22city%22:%22London%22,%22country%22:%22England%22}  [ 53 ]   Now, let's add a search method to our room controller to handle the JSON input in  the case of a request that comes in as an object, as follows:   ** * Search for a room in an accommodation *  public function search   {       json_decode \Request::input 'query'  ; }  The request facade handles the input variable query, and then decodes its JSON  structure into an object. In Chapter 4, Creating RESTful APIs, we will complete the code for the search   method, but for now, we will simply create the architecture of this part of our  RESTful API system.  Controller to command For the second task, reserving the room, we'll create a command as we'll most likely  need a follow up action, which we will enable via the publisher subscriber pattern.  The publisher subscriber pattern is used to represent publishers that send messages  and subscribers that listen to these messages. Add the route to routes.php as follows:  Route::post 'reserve-room', 'RoomController@store' ;  We map the post to the room controller's store method; this will create the  reservation. Remember that we created the command like this:  $ php artisan make:commandReserveRoomCommand -–handler  Our ReserveRoomCommand class looks like this:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Commands;  use MyCompany\Commands\Command; use MyCompany\User;  class ReserveRoomCommand extends Command {      public $user;  [ 54 ]       public $rooms;     public $start_date;     public $end_date;       **     * Create a new command instance.     *     * @return void     *      public function __construct User $user,         $start_date, $end_date, $rooms      {         $this->rooms = $rooms;         $this->user = $user;         $this->start_date = $start_date;         $this->end_date = $end_date;      }  }  We need to add the following attributes to the constructor:      public $user;     public $rooms;     public $start_date;     public $end_date;  Also, add the following assignments to the constructor:          $this->rooms = $rooms;         $this->user = $user;         $this->start_date = $start_date;         $this->end_date = $end_date;  This allows us to carry the values through.  Command to event Now let's create an event. Use artisan to create an event, RoomWasReserved, which  is to be fired when the room gets created:  $ phpartisan make:eventRoomWasReserved  [ 55 ]   The RoomWasReserved event class looks like the following code snippet:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Events;  use MyCompany\Accommodation\Reservation; use MyCompany\Events\Event; use MyCompany\User;  use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels;  class RoomWasReserved extends Event {      use SerializesModels;          private $user;     private $reservation;           **     * Create a new event instance.     *     * @return void     *      public function __construct User $user,         Reservation $reservation      {         $this->user = $user;         $this->reservation = $reservation;     } }  We'll tell it to use the MyCompany\Accommodation\Reservation and MyCompany\ User entities so that we can pass them to the constructor. Inside the constructor, we  assign them to entities within the event object.  Now, let's fire the event from inside the command handler. Laravel provides you  with a simple event   method as a convenience helper method that will fire an  event. We'll inject the RoomWasReserved event with the instantiated reservation and  user as follows:  event new RoomWasReserved $user, $reservation  ;  [ 56 ]   The ReserveRoomCommandHandler class Our ReserveRoomCommandHandler class now instantiates a new reservation, uses  the createNew factory method to inject the dependencies, and finally, fires the  RoomWasReserved event as follows:  <?phpnamespace MyCompany\Handlers\Commands;  use MyCompany\Commands\ReserveRoomCommand;  use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;  class ReserveRoomCommandHandler {       **     * Create the command handler.     *     * @return void     *      public function __construct       {                }       **     * Handle the command.     *     * @paramReserveRoomCommand  $command     * @return void     *      public function handle ReserveRoomCommand $command      {                  $reservationValidator = new             \MyCompany\Accommodation\ReservationValidator  ;                  if  $reservationValidator->validate $command->            start_date,$command->end_date,$command->rooms   {               $reservation =                  $reservationRepository->create   [ 57 ]                   ['date_start'=>$command->$command→start_date,                 'date_end'=>$command->end_date,                 'rooms'=>$command->'rooms'] ;         }     $reservation = new        event new RoomWasReserved $command->user,$reservation  ;     } }  Event to handler Now, we need to create the event handler. As you would have expected, the   Artisan provides a convenient way of doing this, although the syntax is a bit  different. This time, strangely, the word make doesn't appear in the phrase:  $ php artisan handler:eventRoomReservedEmail --event=RoomWasReserved      <?php namespace MyCompany\Handlers\Events;      use MyCompany\Events\RoomWasReserved;      use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;      use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeQueued;      class RoomReservedEmail {           **          * Create the event handler.          * @return void          *           public function __construct            public function handle RoomWasReserved $event                 TODO: send email to $event->user                TODO: with details about $event->reservation;  [ 58 ]                                  {          }                {          }      }   Now we need to connect the event to its listener. We will edit the app Providers  EventServiceProvider.php file as follows:  protected $listen = [     'MyCompany\Events\RoomWasReserved' => [       'MyCompany\Handlers\Events\RoomReservedEmail',       ],     ];  As shown in the preceding code snippet, we will add the key-value pair to the  $listen array. The full path, as shown, is needed for the key, the event name, and  the array of handlers. In this case, we only have one handler.  Queued event handlers If we would like to not have the event handled immediately, but rather, put into the  queue, we can add –queued to the create command as follows:  $ php artisan handler:eventRoomReservedEmail     --event=RoomWasReserved --queued      <?php namespace MyCompany\Handlers\Events;      use MyCompany\Events\RoomWasReserved;      use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;      use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeQueued;      class RoomReservedEvent implements ShouldBeQueued {      use InteractsWithQueue;      public function __construct                                      {                  }            use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeQueued;  [ 59 ]   This interface tells Laravel that the event handler should be queued and not   executed synchronously:  use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;  This trait allows us to interact with the queue to be able to do tasks, such as   delete the job.  The waiting list command For the fourth task, being placed on a waiting list, we'll need to create another  command that would be called from inside the reservation controller. Once again,  using Artisan, we can easily create the command and its corresponding event as  follows:  $ php artisan make:commandPlaceOnWaitingListCommand  $ php artisan make:eventPlacedOnWaitinglist  Now, in our reservation controller, we would add the check for roomAvailability  and then dispatch the PlaceOnWaitinglist command as follows:  public function store       {     …     …         if  $roomAvailable  {             $this->dispatch                new ReserveRoomCommand  $start_date,                 $end_date, $rooms               ;         } else {             $this->dispatch                new PlaceOnWaitingListCommand $start_date,                 $end_date, $rooms               ;         }     …  [ 60 ]   The queued commands We can easily queue the commands by adding queued to the create command:  $ php artisan make:commandReserveRoomCommand -–handler --queued  This will use whichever queuing system is available, such as beanstalkd, and not  immediately run the command. Instead, it will be placed in the queue and run later.  We'll need to add an interface to the Command class:  Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeQueued  In this case, the ReserveRoomCommand class will look like this:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Commands;  use MyCompany\Commands\Command;  use Illuminate\Queue\SerializesModels; use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue; use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeQueued;  class MyCommand extends Command implements ShouldBeQueued {  use InteractsWithQueue, SerializesModels;                        }   **  * Create a new command instance.  *  * @return void  *  public function __construct   {   }      Here, we can see that the InteractsWithQueue and ShouldBeQueued classes  have been included, and the ReserveRoomCommand class extends the command  and implements the ShouldBeQueued class. Another interesting feature is  SerializesModels. This will serialize any models, which are passed in, to be  available later.  [ 61 ]   The console command For the fifth task, let's create a console command, which will be executed very often:  $ php artisan make:consoleManageWaitinglist  This will create a command that can be executed from the Artisan command-line  tool. If you have used Laravel 4, you may be familiar with this type of command.  These commands are stored in the Console Commands  directory.  To let Laravel know about it, we will need to add it to app Console Kernel.php in  the $commands array:  protected $commands = [     'MyCompany\Console\Commands\Inspire',     'MyCompany\Console\Commands\ManageWaitinglist',     ];  The contents will look like this:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Console\Commands;  use Illuminate\Console\Command; use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputOption; use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputArgument;  class ManageWaitinglist extends Command {       **     * The console command name.     *     * @var string     *      protected $name = 'command:name';       **     * The console command description.     *     * @var string     *      protected $description = 'Command description.';       **     * Create a new command instance.     *  [ 62 ]       * @return void     *      public function __construct       {         parent::__construct  ;     }       **     * Execute the console command.     *     * @return mixed     *      public function fire       {                }       **     * Get the console command arguments.     *     * @return array     *      protected function getArguments       {         return [           ['example', InputArgument::REQUIRED,               'An example argument.'],         ];     }       **     * Get the console command options.     *     * @return array     *      protected function getOptions       {         return [           ['example', null, InputOption::VALUE_OPTIONAL,               'An example option.', null],         ];     } }  [ 63 ]   The $name attribute is what will be called from Artisan. For example, if we set   the following:  protected $name = 'manage:waitinglist';  Then, by running the following command, we can manage the waiting list:  $ php artisan manage:waitinglist  The getArguments   and getOptions   methods are similar methods with the  same signature, but have different uses.  The getArguments   method specifies an array of arguments that must be used   to launch the command. The getOptions   methods are specified with – and can   be optional, repeated, and with the VALUE_NONE option, they can be simply   used as flags.  We will write the command's main code inside the fire   method. If we want to  dispatch a command from within this command, we'll add the DispatchesCommands  trait to the class as follows:      use DispatchesCommands;      <?php namespace MyCompany\Console\Commands;      use Illuminate\Console\Command;      use Illuminate\Foundation\Bus\DispatchesCommands;      use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputOption;      use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\InputArgument;      class ManageWaitinglist extends Command {                                  use DispatchesCommands;                     **          * The console command name.          * @var string           *           protected $name = 'manage:waitinglist';                     **  [ 64 ]           * The console command description.          * @var string          *           protected $description = 'Manage the accommodation             waiting list.';          * Create a new command instance.          * @return void          public function __construct                parent::__construct  ;          * Execute the console command.          * @return mixed          public function fire             **          *          *           {          }           **          *           {              }          }           **          *           {          * Get the console command arguments.          * @return array          protected function getArguments                return [];  [ 65 ]                 TODO: write business logic to manage waiting list              if  $roomIsAvailableFor $user   {                  $this->dispatch new ReserveRoomCommand   ;           * Get the console command options.          protected function getOptions            }           **          * @return array          *               return [];          {          }  }  The command scheduler Now, we will schedule this command to run every 10 minutes. Traditionally,   this was done by creating a cron job to execute the Laravel console's command.   Now, Laravel 5 provides a new mechanism to do this—the command scheduler.  The new artisan command is run as follows:  $ php artisan schedule:run  By simply adding this command to the cron, Laravel will automatically run all   of the commands that are in the Kernel.php file.  The commands need to be added to the Schedule function as follows:  protected function schedule Schedule $schedule      {         $schedule->command 'inspire'               ->hourly  ;         $schedule->command 'manage:waitinglist'              ->everyFiveMinutes  ;      }  The inspire command is a sample command provided by Laravel to   demonstrate the functionality. We will simply add our command. This will   call the manage:waitinglist command every 5 minutes—it couldn't be much   easier than that.  [ 66 ]   Now we need to modify the crontab file to have Artisan run the scheduler.  The crontab is a file that contains commands to be run at certain times. To modify  this file, type the following command:  $ sudo crontab -e  We will use vi or whichever the assigned editor is to modify the cron table. Adding  the following line will tell cron to run the scheduler every minute:  * * * * * php  path to artisan schedule:run 1>>  dev null 2>&1  Summary Laravel has evolved in just two short years, moving away from CodeIgniter's   Model-View-Controller paradigm to adopt modern Domain-driven design's  command bus and publisher subscriber event listener pattern. Whether or not to  use these patterns will depend on the amount of separation that is desired between  each layer. Certainly, even using a self-handling command is a start toward  creating completely independent blocks of code, which promotes the code into a  separate handler class, carrying the separation-of-concerns principle even further.  By reducing the amount of code that resides inside the controller, the command  becomes even more important.  We have not yet even written the code for each user story to interact with the  database, and we have only seeded and tested the database, but the structure is  beginning to become very well designed; each class having a very meaningful   name and being organized into a useful directory structure.  In the next chapter, we will fill in the details of how the RESTful controller will  accept input from another system or from the frontend of the website, and then   how the model's attributes will be returned to the user to create the interface.  [ 67 ]    Creating RESTful APIs  If there is one single core feature that demonstrates Laravel's superiority,   it would be the ability to quickly and easily create a RESTful API. With the arrival  of Laravel 5, several new features have been added; however, the ability to create  application models and controllers via the Artisan command-line tool remains the  most useful feature.  This feature is what initially encouraged me and so many others to abandon  frameworks such as CodeIgniter, which at the time that Laravel 4 was in beta,   did not natively have the same integrated functionality. Laravel provides the   basic CRUD methods: create, read, update, delete, and also lists all.  Requests that arrive via HTTP to a Laravel URL are managed through their verbs  and subsequently, the routes.php file, which is located at app Http routes.php.  There are two ways in which the requests are handled. One way is that the request is  handled directly via a closure, and the code is entirely inside the routes file. Another  way is that it routes the request to a controller, where a method will be executed.  Also, the basic paradigm used is convention-over-configuration, where the method  names are ready to handle the various requests, without too much extra effort.  RESTful APIs in Laravel The list of RESTful API requests handled by the RESTful API are as follows:  HTTP  VERB GET  GET  1  2  Function  URL  This lists all accommodations This shows  reads  a single  accommodation   accommodations   accommodations {id}  [ 69 ]   HTTP  VERB  POST  PUT  PATCH  3  4  5  6  Function  URL  This creates a new accommodation   accommodations  This entirely modifies  updates  an  accommodation This partially modifies  updates  an  accommodation   accommodations {id}   accommodations {id}  DELETE  This deletes an accommodation   accommodations {id}  Most RESTful API best practices suggest using the plural form of the model  name. Laravel's documentation uses the singular format. Most practices agree  that consistent plural naming, that is,  accommodations {id} refers to a single  accommodation and  accommodations refers to more than one accommodation,  both using the plural form are preferred over a mixed, but grammatically correct    accommodation {id}  singular form  and  accommodations  plural form .  Essential CRUD For simplicity, I have numbered each of the rows. The first and second items  represent the read part of CRUD. The first item, which is a GET call to the plural form of the model name, is rather  simple; it displays all of the items. Sometimes, this is called a list to differentiate it  from the read of a single record. Adding a list would thus expand the acronym to  CRUDL. They could be paginated or require authorization.  The second item, also a GET call, adds the ID of the model to the end of the URL,  displaying a single model with that corresponding ID. This could also require  authentication but not paging.  The third item represents the create part of CRUD. It uses the POST verb to create a  new model. Note that the URL format is the same as the first item; this demonstrates  the importance of the verb to distinguish between the actions.  The fourth, fifth, and sixth items use the new HTTP verbs that were not supported   by all browsers. Whether or not the verbs are supported, JavaScript libraries   and frameworks, such as jQuery, will send the verb in a way that Laravel can  properly handle.  [ 70 ]   The fourth item is the update part of CRUD and updates the model using the   PUT verb. Note that it has the same URL format as the second, as it needs to know  which model to update. It is also idempotent, which means that the entire model  must be updated.  The fifth item is similar to the fourth item; it updates the model, but uses the PATCH  verb. This is used to indicate that the model will be partially modified, which means  that one or more of the model's attributes have to be changed.  The sixth item deletes a single model and thus requires the model's ID, using the self- explanatory DELETE verb.  Bonus features Laravel adds two additional methods that are not usually part of a standard RESTful  API. A GET method on the model URL, adding create is used to display a form to  create the model. A GET method on the model URL with its ID, adding edit is used  to display a form to create the model. These two functions are useful for providing a  URL that will load a form, even though this type of usage is not a standard RESTful:  HTTP  VERB GET  GET  Function  URL  This displays an accommodation  creation form This displays an accommodation  modification update form   accommodations create   accommodations {id} edit  Controller creation To create a controller for the accommodations, the following Artisan command is  used:  $ php artisan make:controller AccommodationsController      <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;      use MyCompany\Http\Requests;      use MyCompany\Http\Controllers\Controller;      use Illuminate\Http\Request;              [ 71 ]       class AccommodationController extends Controller {          * Display a listing of the resource.          * @return Response          public function index            * Show the form for creating a new resource.          * @return Response          public function create            * Store a newly created resource in storage.          * @return Response          public function store                   **          *           {          }                     **          *           {          }                     **          *           {          }                 **          *           {          }                * Display the specified resource.          * @param  int  $id          * @return Response          public function show $id   [ 72 ]           * Show the form for editing the specified resource.          * @param  int  $id          * @return Response          public function edit $id           * Update the specified resource in storage.          * @param  int  $id          * @return Response          public function update $id           * Remove the specified resource from storage.          * @param  int  $id          * @return Response          public function destroy $id            **          *           {          }                 **          *          *           {          }                 **          *           {          }      }  CRUD L  by example We have seen this controller before, but here are a few examples. The single most  simple example of a RESTful call would be as shown in the following sections.  [ 73 ]   cRudl – read Create a GET call to http:  www.hotelwebsite.com accommmodations 1,   where 1 would be the ID of the room:   **  * Display the specified resource.  *  * @param  int  $id  * @return Response  *  public function show $id  {     return \MyCompany\Accommodation::findOrFail $id ; }  This would return a single model as a JSON-encoded object:  {     "id": 1,     "name": "Hotel On The Hill","description":"Lorem         ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",     "location_id": 1,     "created_at": "2015-02-08 20:13:10",     "updated_at": "2015-02-08 20:13:10",     "deleted_at": null }  crudL – list Create a GET call to http:  www.hotelwebsite.com accommmodations.  This is similar to the preceding code, yet slightly different:   ** Display a listing of the resource.     * @return Response  *  public function index   {     return Accommodation::all  ; }  [ 74 ]   This would return all of the models, automatically encoded as JSON objects; there is  nothing else that is required. Formatting has been added so that the JSON results are  more easily readable, but basically, the entire model is returned:  [{      "id": 1,     "name": "Hotel On The Hill","description":"Lorem ipsum         dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.",     "location_id": 1,     "created_at": "2015-02-08 20:13:10",     "updated_at": "2015-02-08 20:13:10",     "deleted_at": null }  {   "id": 2,     "name": "Patterson Place",     "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,         consectetur adipiscing elit.",     "location_id": 2,     "created_at": "2015-02-08 20:15:02",     "updated_at": "2015-02-08 20:15:02",     "deleted_at": null }, {     "id": 3,     "name": "Neat and Tidy Hotel",     "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,         consectetur adipiscing elit.",     "location_id": 3,     "created_at": "2015-02-08 20:17:34",     "updated_at": "2015-02-08 20:17:34",     "deleted_at": null } ]  The deleted_at field is a soft delete or the recycle bin mechanism.  It is either null for not deleted or a date time stamp for deleted.  [ 75 ]   Pagination To add pagination, simply substitute all   with paginate  :  public function index   {     return Accommodation::paginate  ; }  The results will now look like this. The eloquent collection array is now moved  inside a date attribute:  {"total":15, "per_page":15, "current_page":1, "last_page":1, "next_page_url":null, "prev_page_url":null, "from":1, "to":15, "data":[{"id":9, "name":"Lovely Hotel", "description":"Lovely Hotel Greater Pittsburgh", ….  Crudl – create Create a POST call to http:  www.hotelwebsite.com accommmodations.  To create a new model, a POST call will be sent to  accommodations.   A JSON would be sent from the frontend as follows:  {     "name": "Lovely Hotel",     "description": "Lovely Hotel Greater Pittsburgh",     "location_id":1 }  The store function might look something like this:  public function store   {     $input = \Input::json  ;     $accommodation = new Accommodation;     $accommodation->name = $input->get 'name' ;  [ 76 ]       $accommodation->description = $input->get 'description' ;     $accommodation->location_id = $input->get 'location_id' ;     $accommodation->save  ;     return response $accommodation, 201  ; }  201 is the HTTP status code  HTTP 1.1 201 created  for created.   In this example, we returned the model as a JSON-encoded object. The object will  include the ID that was inserted:  {     "name":"Lovely Hotel",     "description":"Lovely Hotel Greater Pittsburgh",     "location_id":1,     "updated_at":"2015-03-13 20:48:19",     "created_at":"2015-03-13 20:48:19",     "id":26 }  crUdl – update Create a PUT call to http:  www.hotelwebsite.com accommmodations 1,   where 1 is the ID to be updated:   **     * Update the specified resource in storage.     *     * @param  int  $id     * @return Response     *      public function update $id      {         $input = \Input::json  ;         $accommodation =             \MyCompany\Accommodation::findOrFail $id ;         $accommodation->name = $input->get 'name' ;         $accommodation->description = $input->get 'description' ;         $accommodation->location_id = $input->get 'location_id' ;         $accommodation->save  ;         return response $accommodation, 200              ->header 'Content-Type', 'application json' ;     }  [ 77 ]   To update an existing model, the code is exactly the same as we used earlier,   except that the following line is used to find the existing model:  $accommodation = Accommodation::find $id ;  The PUT verb would be sent to  accommodations {id}, where id would be the  numeric ID of the accommodations table.  cruDl – delete To delete a model, create a DELETE call to http:  www.hotelwebsite.com  accommmodation 1, where 1 is the ID to be deleted:   **  * Remove the specified resource from storage.  *  * @param  int  $id  * @return Response  *  public function destroy $id  {     $accommodation = Accommodation::find $id ;     $accommodation->delete  ;     return response 'Deleted.', 200  ; }  There seems to be some disagreement about what the proper status  code should be for a deleted model.  Model binding Now, we can use a technique called model binding to clean up the code even more:  public function boot Router $router  {     parent::boot $router ;     $router->model 'accommodations', '\MyCompany\Accommodation' ; }  [ 78 ]   In app Providers RouteServiceProvider.php, add the $router->model    method that accepts the route as the first argument and the model that will be   bound as the second argument.  Read revisited Now, our show controller method looks like this:  public function show Accommodation $accommodation  {     return $accommodation; }  When  accommodations 1 is called, for example, the model that corresponds to that  ID will be injected into the method, allowing us to substitute the find method.  List revisited Similarly, for the list method, we inject the type-hinted model as follows:  public function index Accommodation $accommodation  {     return $accommodation; }  Update revisited Likewise, the update method now looks like this:  public function update Accommodation $accommodation  {     $input = \Input::json  ;     $accommodation->name = $input->get 'name' ;     $accommodation->description = $input->get 'description' ;     $accommodation->location_id = $input->get 'location_id' ;     $accommodation->save  ;     return response $accommodation, 200      ->header 'Content-Type', 'application json' ; }  [ 79 ]   Delete revisited Also, the destroy method looks like this:  public function destroy Accommodation $accommodation  {     $accommodation->delete  ;     return response 'Deleted.', 200          ->header 'Content-Type', 'text html' ; }  Moving beyond CRUD If one of the requirements of the software application to be built is able to search for  an accommodation, then we can easily add a search function. The search function  will find accommodations by using a name string. One way to do this is to add a  route to the routes.php file. This will map a GET call to search for a new search    function contained within AccommodationsController:  Route::get 'search', 'AccommodationsController@search' ; Route::resource 'accommodations', 'AccommodationsController' ;  In this case, the GET method would be preferred instead of the POST  method, as it can be bookmarked and recalled later.  Now, we will write our search function:  public function search Request $request, Accommodation $accommodation  {     return $accommodation         ->where 'name',           'like',           '%'.$request->get 'name' .'%'          ->get  ;     }  There are several mechanisms here:     The Request object that contains the variables from the GET request is    type-hinted and then injected into the search function     The Accommodation model is type-hinted and then injected into the    search function  [ 80 ]      The where   method from the fluent query builder is called on the eloquent   model $accommodation     The name parameter is used from the request object    The get   method is used to actually perform the SQL query  Note that some of the query builder and eloquent methods return an  instance of the query builder, while the others execute the query and  return the result. The where   method returns an instance of the  query builder, while the get   method executes the query.     The resulting eloquent collection is returned and automatically encoded    into JSON  The GET request, therefore, is as follows:  http:  www.hotelwebsite.com search-accommodation?name=Lovely  The resultant JSON would look something like this:  [{"id":3, "name":"Lovely Hotel", "description":"Lovely Hotel Greater Pittsburgh", "location_id":1, "created_at":"2015-03-13 22:00:23", "updated_at":"2015-03-13 22:00:23", "deleted_at":null}, {"id":4, "name":"Lovely Hotel", "description":"Lovely Hotel Greater Philadelphia", "location_id":2, "created_at":"2015-03-11 21:43:31", "updated_at":"2015-03-11 21:43:31", "deleted_at":null}]  Nested controllers Nested controllers is a new feature in Laravel 5 and is used to handle all of the  RESTful actions that deal with relationships. For example, we can take advantage of  this feature for the relationship between accommodations and rooms.   [ 81 ]   The relationship between accommodation and room is as follows:     An accommodation may have one or more rooms  one-to-many     A room belongs to one and only one accommodation  one-to-one   In our models, we will now write the code to enable the one-to-one and one-to-many  relationships to be skillfully handled by Laravel.  Accommodation hasMany rooms First, we will add the code that is needed by the Accomodation.php file that  represents the accommodation model as follows:  class Accommodation extends Model {     public function rooms  {         return $this->hasMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Room' ;     } }  The rooms   method creates an easy way to access the relationship from inside  the accommodation model. The relation states that "the accommodation hasMany  rooms". The hasMany function, when residing inside the Accommodation class,  without any additional parameters, expects a column named accommodation_id to  exist in the Room model's table, which in this case is rooms.  Room belongsTo accommodation Now, we will add the code that is needed by the Room.php file that represents the  Room model:  class Room extends Model {     public function accommodation  {         return $this->belongsTo '\MyCompany\Accommodation' ;     } }  This code states that "a room belongsTo an accommodation". The belongsTo method  inside the Room class, without any additional parameters, expects a field in the room  model's table; in this case, rooms, named accommodation_id.  [ 82 ]   If the tables in the application database have followed the active record  conventions, then most of the eloquent relation functionalities will  automatically function. All of the parameters can be easily configured.  The command to create a nested controller is as follows:  $php artisan make:controller AccommodationsRoomsController  Then, the following line would be added to the app Http routes.php file:  Route::resource 'accommodations.rooms',     'AccommodationsRoomsController' ;  To display the routes created, the following command should be executed:  $php artisan route:list  The following table lists the HTTP verbs and their functions:  HTTP  verb GET  GET  POST  PUT  PATCH  DELETE  1  2  3  4  5  6  Function  URL  This shows the  accommodation and  room relations This shows an  accommodation and  room relation This creates a new  accommodation and  room relation This entirely  modifies  updates   an accommodation  and room relation This partially  modifies  updates   an accommodation  and room relation This deletes an  accommodation and  room relation   accommodations {accommodations}  rooms   accommodations {accommodations}  rooms {rooms}   accommodations {accommodations}  rooms   accommodations {accommodations}  rooms {rooms}   accommodations {accommodations}  rooms {rooms}   accommodations {accommodations}  rooms {rooms}  [ 83 ]   Eloquent relations A nice mechanism used to illustrate an Eloquent relation directly inside the  controller is performed through the use of a nested relation, where two models are  connected firstly through the route and secondly through their controller method's  parameters via model dependency injection.  Nested update Let's investigate the update modify PUT nested controller command. The URL  looks like this: http:  www.hotelwebsite.com accommodations 21 rooms 13.  Here, 21 would be the ID of the accommodation and 13 would be ID of the room.  The parameters are the type-hinted models. This allows us to easily update the  relationship as follows:  public function update Accommodation $accommodation, Room $room  {     $room->accommodation  ->associate $accommodation ;     $room->save  ; }  Nested create Similarly, it is easy to perform the nested create operation with a POST body to  http:  www.hotelwebsite.com accommodations 21 rooms. The POST body is a  JSON formatted object:  {"roomNumber":"123"}  Note that there is no ID needed for the room since we are creating it:  public function store Accommodation $accommodation  {     $input = \Input::json  ;     $room = new Room  ;     $room->room_number = $input->get 'roomNumber' ;     $room->save  ;     $accommodation->rooms  ->save $room ; }  [ 84 ]   Eloquent model casting Models are returned in the JSON format as they are represented in the database.  Often, model attributes, which are Boolean in nature, are represented by 0 and 1 for  true and false, respectively. It may be, in this case, more convenient to return a real  true and false to the RESTful call's return object. In Laravel 4, this was done using accessors. If the value was $status, the method  would be defined as follows:  public function getStatusAttribute $value {       do conversion; }  In Laravel 5, this process is much easier, thanks to a new feature called model  casting. To apply this technique, simply add a protected key and a value array   called $casts to the model as follows:  class Room extends Model {     protected $casts = ['room_number'        =>'integer','status'=>'boolean'];     public function accommodation  {         return $this->belongsTo '\MyCompany\Accommodation' ;     } }  In this example, room_number is a string, but we want to return an integer. Status is  a tiny integer, but we want to return a Boolean value. Casting these two values in the  model will modify the resultant JSON in the following manner:  {"id":1, "room_number": "101", "status": 1, "created_at":"2015-03-14 09:25:59", "updated_at":"2015-03-14 19:03:03", "deleted_at":null, "accommodation_id":2}  The preceding code will now change as follows:  {"id":1, "room_number": 101, "status": true, "created_at":"2015-03-14 09:25:59", "updated_at":"2015-03-14 19:03:03", "deleted_at":null, "accommodation_id":2}  [ 85 ]   Route caching Laravel 5 has a new mechanism for caching the routes as the routes.php file can  easily grow very large and will quickly slow down the request process. To enable the  caching mechanism, type the following artisan command:  $ php artisan route:cache  This creates another routes.php file in  storage framework routes.php. If this  file exists, then it is used instead of the routes.php file, which is located in app  Http routes.php. The structure of the file is as follows:  <?php   * -------------------------------------------------------------------- ------  Load The Cached Routes  … *   app 'router' ->setRoutes  unserialize base64_decode 'TzozNDoiSWxsdW1pbmF0ZV  xSb3V0aW5nXFJvdXRlQ29sbGVjdGlvbiI6NDp7czo5OiIAKgB  yb3V0ZXMiO2E6Njp7czozOiJHRVQiO2E6M … ... VyQGluZGV4IjtzOjk6Im5hbWVzcGFjZSI7czoyNj  oiTXlDb21wYWbXBhbnlcSHR0cFxDb250cm9sbGVyc1xIb3Rl  bENvbnRyb2xsZXJAZGVzdHJveSI7cjo4Mzg7fX0='    ;  Notice that an interesting technique is used here. The routes are serialized, then  base64 is encoded. Obviously, to read the routes, the reverse is used, base64_ decode  , and then unserialize  .  If the routes.php cached file exists, then every time a change is made to the   routes.php file, the route cache artisan command must be executed. This will   clear the file and then recreate it. If you later decide to no longer use this mechanism,   then the following artisan command can be used to eliminate the file:  $ php artisan route:clear  [ 86 ]   Laravel is useful for building several distinctly different types of applications.   When building traditional web applications, there is often a tight integration  between the controllers and the views. It is also useful when building an app that  can be used on a smartphone. In this case, the frontend will be created for the  smartphone's operating system using another programming language and or  framework. In this case, only the controllers and model will most likely be used.   In either case, however, having a well-documented RESTful API is an essential   part of a well-designed modern software.  Nested controllers helps developers right away to read the code—it is an easy way to  understand that the particular controller deals with the "nesting" or the concept that  one class is related another.  Type-hinting the models and objects into the controller also improves the readability  and, at the same time, reduces the amount of code necessary to perform the basic  operations on the objects.  Also, eloquent model casting creates an easy way to transform the attributes of a  model, without having to rely on external packages or tedious accessor functions, as  was the case in Laravel 4.  Now it is rather clear to us why Laravel is becoming the choice of many developers.  Learning and repeating some of the steps illustrated in this chapter will allow a  RESTful API to get created in under an hour for a small-to-medium size program.  Summary A RESTful API provides an easy way to expand the program in the future and also  integrates with third-party programs and software that exist within a company that  might need to communicate with the application. The RESTful API is the front-most  shell of the inner part of the program and provides the bridge between the outside  world and the application itself. The inner part of the program will be where all  of the business logic and database connections will reside, so fundamentally, the  controllers simply have the job of connecting the routes to the application.  Laravel follows the RESTful best practices, thus documenting the API should be easy  enough for other developers and third-party integrators to understand. Laravel 5 has  brought a few features in to the framework to enable the code to be more readable.  [ 87 ]   In future chapters, middleware will be discussed. Middleware adds various "middle"  layers between the route and the controller. Middleware can provide features such  as authentication. Middleware will enrich, protect, and help organize the routes into  logical and functional groups.  We will also discuss DocBlock annotations. Annotations, while not natively  supported in PHP, can be enabled via a Laravel community package. Then,  inside the DocBlock of the controller and controller functions, the routing for each  controller is automatically created, without having to actually modify the app Http  routes.php file. This is another great community concept that Laravel easily adapts  to, in the same manner as phpspec and Behat.  [ 88 ]   Using the Form Builder  In this chapter, you will learn how to use Laravel's form builder. The form builder  will be demonstrated to facilitate the building of the following elements:  Input  text, HTML5 password, HTML5 e-mail, and so on.      Form  open and close     Label       Checkbox    Submit    Anchor tags  href links   Finally, we'll see an example of how to use the form builder to create the month,  date, and year selection elements for the accommodations reservation software form,  and how to create a macro to reduce the code duplication.  History The form builder package in Laravel 4 is called HTML. This was used to help you  create HTML, particularly developers who also have to perform web designer duties  but prefer to use Laravel facades and helper methods. For example, the following  Laravel facade select   method, where the options for the language, British and  American English in this example, are passed as an array parameter:  Form::select 'language', ['en-us' =>     'English  US ','en-gb' => 'English  UK '] ;  [ 89 ]   This can be used as an alternative to the standard HTML, which requires much more  repetitious code, as shown in the following code:         English  US        English  UK      Since frameworks are constantly evolving, they need to adapt to fulfill the needs  of most of their users. Also, whenever possible, they should continue to be more  efficient. In some cases, this means rewriting or refactoring pieces of the framework,  adding features, or even removing them.  As strange as it may seem, there are several valid reasons for removing the features.  The following is a list of reasons for removing packages:     To ease the burden and quantity of packages and features that framework   core developers need to maintain.     To reduce the number of packages that are downloaded and autoloaded.    To remove a feature that is not essential.    The HTML package was removed from the core of Laravel 5 and is now an  external package. In this case, any of the previous reasons could be cited for  the reason that this package was removed.     HTML, which helps developers build forms, can be used if the frontend  developer is also a backend or full-stack developer and prefers Laravel's  way of doing things. In other situations, however, the web application  HTML interface can be built using a JavaScript framework or a library, such  as AngularJS or Backbone.js. In this case, the Laravel form package would  not be necessary. Alternatively, as previously stated, Laravel can be used  to create an application that is merely a RESTful API. In this case, including  the HTML package in the framework core would not be necessary and thus  remains auxiliary.  In this particular case, certain Laravel packages were removed to lighten up the  overall experience and to move toward a more component-based approach, which is  similar to that used in Symfony.  [ 90 ]   Installing the HTML package If you desire to use the HTML package in Laravel 5, installing it is a simple process.  A group of developers in the Laravel community formed a repository called the  Laravel collective, where the packages that have been removed from Laravel are  maintained. To install the HTML package, simple use the composer command to   add the package to the application as follows:  $ composer require laravelcollective html  Note that the illuminate HTML package has been deprecated.  This will install the HTML package and the composer.json will show you the  package added to the require section as follows:  "require": {     "laravel framework": "5.0.*",     "laravelcollective html": "~5.0",   },  At this point, the package is installed.  Now, we need to add the HTMLServiceProvider to the list of providers in the  config app.php file:    'providers' => [   ...     'Collective\Html\HtmlServiceProvider',   ...   ],  Lastly, the Form and Html aliases need to be added to the config app.php file,   as shown here:  'aliases' => [    ...         'Form' => 'Collective\Html\FormFacade',         'Html' => 'Collective\Html\HtmlFacade',    ...   ],  [ 91 ]   Building web pages with Laravel Laravel's approach to building web content is flexible. As much or as little of Laravel  can be used to create HTML. Laravel uses the filename.blade.php convention to  state that the file should be parsed by the blade parser, which actually converts the  file into plain PHP. The name blade was inspired by the .NET's razor templating  engine, so this may be familiar to someone who has used it. Laravel 5 provides a  working demonstration of a form in the  resources views  directory. This view  is shown when the  home route is requested and the user is not currently logged in.  This form is obviously not created using the Laravel form methods.  The route is defined in the routes file as follows:  Route::get 'home', 'HomeController@index' ;  An explanation of how this route uses middleware to check how to perform the user  authentication will be discussed in Chapter 7, Filtering Requests with Middleware.

The following line overrides the content:  @section 'content'   For this exercise, the form builder will be used instead of the static HTML.  The form tag We will convert a static form tag to a FormBuilder method. The HTML is as follows:  <form class="form-horizontal" role="form" method="POST"     action=" auth login">  The method facade that we will use is as follows:  Form::open  ;  In the FormBuilder.php class, the $reserved attribute is defined as follows:  protected $reserved = ['method', 'url', 'route',     'action', 'files'];  The attributes that we need to pass to an array to the open   method are class, role,  method, and action. Since method and action are reserved words, it is necessary to  pass the parameters in the following manner:  Laravel form facade method array element HTML Form tag attribute method  url role class  method action role class  Thus, the method call looks like this:  {!!    Form::open ['class'=>'form-horizontal',   'role =>'form',   'method'=>'POST',   'url'=>' auth login']   !!}  [ 97 ]   The {!! !!} tags are used to start and end parsing of the form builder methods.   The form method, POST, is placed first in the list of attributes in the HTML form tag.  The action attribute actually needs to be a url. If the  action parameter is used, then it refers to the controller  action. In this case, the url parameter produces the action  attribute of the form tag.  Other attributes will be passed to the array and added to the list of attributes.   The resultant HTML will be produced as follows:  <form method="POST" action="http:  laravel.example auth login"     accept-charset="UTF-8" class="form-horizontal" role="form">  <input name="_token" type="hidden"     value="wUY2hFSEWCzKHFfhywHvFbq9TXymUDiRUFreJD4h">  The CRSF token is automatically added, as the form method is POST.  The text input field To convert the input fields, a facade is used. The input field's HTML is as follows:  <input type="email" class="form-control" name="email"     value="{{ old 'email'  }}">  Converting the preceding input field using a façade looks like this:  {!! Form::input 'email','email',old 'email' ,    ['class'=>'form-control' ]  !!}  Similarly, the text field becomes:  {!! Form::input 'password','password',null,    ['class'=>'form-control']  !!}  The input fields have the same signature. Of course, this can be refactored as follows:   'form-control'] ?> {!! Form::input 'email','email',old 'email' ,    $inputAttributes   !!} ... {!! Form::input 'password','password',null,$inputAttributes   !!}  [ 98 ]   The label tag The label tags are as follows:   E-Mail Address   Password   To convert the label tags  E-Mail Address and Password , we will first create an  array to hold the attributes, and then pass this array to the labels, as follows:  $labelAttributes = ['class'=>'col-md-4 control-label'];  Here is the form label code:  {!! Form::label 'email', 'E-Mail Address', $labelAttributes  !!} {!! Form::label 'password', 'Password', $labelAttributes  !!}  Checkbox To convert the checkbox to a facade, we will convert this:    Remember Me  The preceding code is converted to the following code:  {!! Form::checkbox 'remember',''  !!} Remember Me  Remember that the PHP parameters should be sent in single  quotation marks if there are no variables or other special characters,  such as line breaks, inside the string to parse, while the HTML  produced will have double quotes.  The submit button Lastly, the submit button will be converted as follows:  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"     style="margin-right: 15px;">     Login    [ 99 ]   The preceding code after conversion is as follows:      {!!          Form::submit 'Login',         ['class'=>'btn btn-primary',          'style'=>'margin-right: 15px;']       !!}  Note that the array parameter provides an easy way to provide  any desired attributes, even those that are not among the list of  standard HTML form elements.  The anchor tag with links To convert the links, a helper method is used. Consider the following line of code:   Forgot Your Password?   The preceding line of code after conversion becomes:  {!! link_to ' password email', $title = 'Forgot Your     Password?', $attributes = array  , $secure = null  !!}  The link_to_route   method may be used to   link to a route. For similar helper functions, visit   http:  laravelcollective.com docs 5.0 html.  Closing the form To end the form, we'll convert the traditional HTML form tag   to a Laravel  {!! Form::close   !!} form method.  The resultant form By putting everything together, the page now looks like this:  @extends 'app'  @section 'content'                       [ 100 ]            Login                          @if  count $errors  > 0                                         Whoops!  There were some                         problems with your input.                                                 @foreach  $errors->all   as $error                               {{ $error }}                          @endforeach                                                     @endif              'form-control'];                 $labelAttributes = ['class'=>'col-md-4                     control-label']; ?>             {!! Form::open ['class'=>'form-horizontal','role'=>                'form','method'=>'POST','url'=>' auth login']  !!}                                       {!! Form::label 'email', 'E-Mail                         Address',$labelAttributes  !!}                                           {!! Form::input 'email','email',old 'email' ,                         $inputAttributes  !!}                                                                               {!! Form::label 'password',                         'Password',$labelAttributes  !!}                                               {!! Form::input 'password',                            'password',null,$inputAttributes  !!}                                                                                                                                                                    {!! Form::checkbox 'remember',''  !!}                                Remember Me                                                                                                                                        [ 101 ]                           {!!

Form::close   !!}                                 @endsection  Our example If we want to create a form to reserve a room in our accommodation, we can easily  call a route from our controller:   **  * Show the form for creating a new resource.  *  * @return Response  *  public function create   {     return view 'auth reserve' ; }  Now we need to create a new view that is located at resources views auth  reserve.blade.php.  In this view, we can create a form to reserve a room in an accommodation where the  user can select the start date, which comprises of the start day of the month and year,  and the end date, which also comprises of the start day of the month and year:  [ 102 ]   The form would begin as before, with a POST to reserve-room. Then, the form label  would be placed next to the select input fields. Finally, the day, the month, and the  year select form elements would be created as follows:   {!! Form::open ['class'=>'form-horizontal',         'role'=>'form',          'method'=>'POST',          'url'=>'reserve-room']  !!}         {!! Form::label null, 'Start Date',$labelAttributes  !!}                  {!! Form::selectMonth 'month',date 'm'   !!}         {!! Form::selectRange 'date',1,31,date 'd'   !!}         {!! Form::selectRange 'year',date 'Y' ,date 'Y' +3  !!}                  {!! Form::label null, 'End Date',$labelAttributes  !!}                  {!! Form::selectMonth 'month',date 'm'   !!}         {!! Form::selectRange 'date',1,31,date 'd'   !!}         {!! Form::selectRange 'year',date 'Y' ,            date 'Y' +3,date 'Y'   !!}                  {!! Form::submit 'Reserve',         ['class'=>'btn btn-primary',          'style'=>'margin-right: 15px;']  !!} {!! Form::close   !!}  Month select Firstly, in the selectMonth method, the first parameter is the name of the input  attribute, while the second attribute is the default value. Here, the PHP date method  is used to extract the numeric portion of the current month—March in this case:  {!! Form::selectMonth 'month',date 'm'   !!}  The output, shown here formatted, is as follows:         January       February       March       April       May       June       July   [ 103 ]        August       September       October       November       December     Date select A similar technique is applied for the selection of the date, but using the  selectRange method, the range of the days in the month are passed to the method.  Similarly, the PHP date function is used to send the current date to the method as   the fourth parameter:  {!! Form::selectRange 'date',1,31,date 'd'   !!}  Here is the formatted output:         1       2       3       4      ...      28       29       30       31     The date that should be selected is 30, since today is March 30, 2015.  For the months that do not have 31 days, usually a JavaScript method  would be used to modify the number of days based on the month  and or the year.  Year select The same technique that is used for the date range is applied for the selection of   the year; once again, using the selectRange method. The range of the years is  passed to the method. The PHP date function is used to send the current year   to the method as the fourth parameter:  {!! Form::selectRange 'year',date 'Y' ,date 'Y' +3,date 'Y'   !!}  [ 104 ]   Here is the formatted output:         2015       2016       2017       2018     Here, the current year that is selected is 2015.  Form macros We have the same code that generates our month, date, and year selection form block  two times: once for the start date and once for the end date. To refactor the code, we  can apply the DRY  don't repeat yourself  principle and create a form macro. This  will allow us to avoid calling the form element creation method twice, as follows:  <?php Form::macro 'monthDayYear',function $suffix=''  {     echo Form::selectMonth  $suffix!=='' ?'month-        '.$suffix:'month',date 'm'  ;     echo Form::selectRange  $suffix!=='' ?'date-        '.$suffix:'date',1,31,date 'd'  ;     echo Form::selectRange  $suffix!=='' ?'year-        '.$suffix:'year',date 'Y' ,date 'Y' +3,date 'Y'  ; } ;  ?>  Here, the month, date, and year generation code is placed into a macro, which is  inside the PHP tags, and it is necessary to add echo to print out the result. The  monthDayYear name is given to this macro method. Calling our macro two times:  once after each label; each time adding a different suffix via the $suffix variable.  Now, our form code looks like this:  <?php Form::macro 'monthDayYear',function $suffix=''  {     echo Form::selectMonth  $suffix!=='' ?'month-        '.$suffix:'month',date 'm'  ;     echo Form::selectRange  $suffix!=='' ?'date-        '.$suffix:'date',1,31,date 'd'  ;  [ 105 ]       echo Form::selectRange  $suffix!=='' ?'year-        '.$suffix:'year',date 'Y' ,date 'Y' +3,date 'Y'  ; } ; ?> {!! Form::open ['class'=>'form-horizontal',                 'role'=>'form',                 'method'=>'POST',                 'url'=>' reserve-room']  !!}     {!! Form::label null, 'Start Date',$labelAttributes  !!}     {!! Form::monthDayYear '-start'  !!}     {!! Form::label null, 'End Date',$labelAttributes  !!}     {!! Form::monthDayYear '-end'  !!}     {!! Form::submit 'Reserve',['class'=>'btn btn-primary',            'style'=>'margin-right: 15px;']  !!} {!! Form::close   !!}  Conclusion The choice to include the HTML form generation package in Laravel 5 can ease the  burden of having to create numerous HTML forms. This approach allows developers  to use methods, create reusable macros, and use a familiar Laravel approach to build  the frontend. Once the basic methods are learned, it is very easy to simply copy and  paste the previously created form elements, and then change their element's name  and or the array that is sent to them.  Depending on the size of the project, this approach may or may not be the right  choice. For a very small application, the difference in the amount of code that needs  to be written is not very evident, although, as is the case with the selectMonth and  selectRange methods, the amount of code necessary is drastic.  This technique, combined with the use of macros, makes it easy to reduce the  occurrence of copy duplication. Also, one of the major problems with the frontend  design is that the contents of the class of the various elements may need to change  throughout the entire application. This would mean performing a large find and  replace operation, where changes are required to be made to HTML, such as  changing class attributes. By creating an array of attributes, including class, for  similar elements, changes made to the entire form can be performed simply by  modifying the array that those elements use.  [ 106 ]   In a larger project, however, where parts of forms may be repeated throughout the  application, the wise use of macros can easily reduce the amount of code necessary  to be written. Not only this, but macros can isolate the code inside from changes  that would require more than one block of code to be changed throughout multiple  files. In the example, where the month, date, and year is to be selected, it is possible  that this could be used up to 20 times in a large application. Any changes made to  the desired block of HTML can be simply done to the macro and the result would be  reflected in all of the elements that use it.  Ultimately, the choice of whether or not to use this package will reside with the  developer and the designer. Since a designer who wants to use an alternative  frontend design tool may not prefer, nor be competent, to work with the methods in  the package, he or she may want to not use it.  Summary In this chapter, the history and the installation of the HTML Laravel composer  package was outlined. The construction of the master template was explained  and then the form components, such as the various form input types, were shown  through examples.  Finally, the construction of a form for the room reservation, as used in the book's  example software, was explained, as well as a "do not repeat yourself" form macro  creation technique.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at a way to use annotations to reduce the time  required to create routing for the application's controllers.  [ 107 ]    Taming Complexity with  Annotations  In the previous chapter, you learned how to create a RESTful API that involved  receiving a request from the Internet, routing it to the controllers, and processing  it. In this chapter, you will learn how to use annotations in the DocBlock, a way  of performing routing that requires even less code and can be a faster and more  organized way of doing collaborative programming with a team.  Annotations will be demonstrated for:     Routing of HTTP requests such as GET, POST, and PUT    Turning a controller into a fully enabled CRUDL resource    Listening to events that are fired from commands    Adding middleware to controllers to limit or filter requests  Annotations are great mechanisms used in programming. Annotations are metadata  that enhance other data. Since this may seem slightly confusing, so we need to first  understand what the meaning of metadata is. The word metadata is a word that  contains two parts:     meta: This is a Greek word that means transcending or encompassing.    data: This is a Latin word that means pieces of information.  Thus, metadata serves to enhance or extend the meaning of something.  [ 109 ]   Annotations in other programming  languages Next, we will discuss annotations that are used in computer programming.   We will take a look at several examples from Java, C, and PHP, and then finally,  take a look at how annotations are used in Laravel.  Annotations in Java Annotations were first proposed in Java Version 1.1 and added in Version 1.2.   The following is an example of an annotation that is used to override an animal's  speak method:  Java 1.2  **  * @author      Jon Doe    * @version     1.6                current version number   * @since       2010-03-31         version package...   *  public void speak   { }  public class Animal {     public void speak   {     } }  public class Cat extends Animal {     @Override     public void speak   {         System.out.println "Meow." ;     }  }  Note that the @ symbol is used to signal the compiler that this annotation, @ Override, is important.  [ 110 ]   Annotations in C In C, annotations are called attributes and use square brackets instead of the more  often used @ symbol:  [AttributeUsageAttribute AttributeTargets.Property    AttributeTargets.Field, AllowMultiple = false, Inherited = true ] public sealed class AssociationAttribute : Attribute  Annotations in PHP Other PHP frameworks use annotations. Symfony makes extensive use of  annotations. In Doctrine, which is Symfony's ORM and is similar to Laravel's   Eloquent, annotations are used to define relationships. Symfony also uses  annotations for routing. The Zend Framework  ZF  uses annotations as well.   Both the testing tools Behat and PHPUnit use annotations. In the following   example of Behat, an annotation is used to indicate that this method should   be executed before the test suite:   **  * @BeforeSuite  *  public static function prepare SuiteEvent $event  {    prepare system for test suite    before it runs }  DocBlock annotations The example of annotation usage shown in the previous Behat example is rather  interesting, as it places the annotation inside the DocBlock. The DocBlock begins  with a forward slash and two asterisks:  It contains n lines beginning with an asterisk.  The DocBlock ends with a single asterisk and forward slash:   **   *   This syntax tells the parser that something useful is inside the DocBlock in addition  to the normal comments.  [ 111 ]   DocBlock annotations in Laravel When Laravel 5 was being developed, support for routing and event listeners   via DocBlock annotations was originally added. Its syntax was similar to   Symfony and Zend.  Symfony The syntax for Symfony is as follows:   **  * @Route " accommodations search"   * @Method {"GET"}   *   public function searchAction $id  {  Zend The syntax for Zend is as follows:   **  * @Route route=" accommodations search"   *   public function searchAction   {  Laravel The syntax for Laravel is as follows:   **  * @Get " hotels search"   *   public function search   {  [ 112 ]  What type of problem does the DocBlock annotation try to solve though?   One use of doc-annotations would be to add them to controllers, thus moving  the control of the routing and middleware to the controller. This would make the  controller more portable and even framework-agnostic, since the routes.php file  would play a lesser role, if not be totally absent. As shown in the following example,  the routes.php file can grow quite large, and this would lead to complexity and  even cause the file to be unmanageable:  Route::patch 'hotel {hid} room {rid}',    'AccommodationsController@editRoom' ; Route::post 'hotel {hid} room {rid}',    'AccommodationsController@reserve' ; Route::get 'hotel stats,HotelController@Stats' ; Route::resource 'country', 'CountryController' ; Route::resource city', 'CityController' ; Route::resource 'state', 'StateController' ; Route::resource 'amenity', 'AmenitiyController' ; Route::resource 'country', 'CountryController' ; Route::resource city', 'CityController' ; Route::resource 'country', 'CountryController' ; Route::resource 'city', 'CityController' ; Route::resource 'horse', 'HorseController' ; Route::resource 'cow', 'CowController' ; Route::resource 'zebra', 'ZebraController' ; Route::get 'dragon {id}', 'DragonController@show' ; Route::resource 'giraffe', 'GiraffeController' ; Route::resource 'zebrafish', 'ZebrafishController' ;  The idea of DocBlock annotations would be to tame this complexity, as the routing  would be moved to the controllers.  Shortly before the release of Laravel 5.0, due to community disapproval, the feature  was removed. Also, since some developers may not want to use this approach, it  would be proper to move this package from the core of Laravel and into a package.  The method to install the package is similar to the way in which the HTML package  was added. This package is also supported by the Laravel Collective. It is easy to add  annotations by typing the following composer command:  $ composer require laravelcollective annotations  This will install the annotations package, while composer.json will show the  package added in the require section, as follows:  "require": {     "laravel framework": "5.0.*",     "laravelcollective annotations": "~5.0",   },  [ 113 ]   The next step would be to create a file named AnnotationsServiceProvider.php  and add the following code:  <?php namespace App\Providers;  use Collective\Annotations\AnnotationsServiceProvider     as ServiceProvider;  class AnnotationsServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {       **      * The classes to scan for event annotations.      *      * @var array      *      protected $scanEvents = [];       **      * The classes to scan for route annotations.      *      * @var array      *      protected $scanRoutes = [];       **      * The classes to scan for model annotations.      *      * @var array      *      protected $scanModels = [];       **      * Determines if we will auto-scan in the local environment.      *      * @var bool      *      protected $scanWhenLocal = false;       **      * Determines whether or not to automatically          scan the controllers      * directory  App\Http\Controllers  for routes      *  [ 114 ]        * @var bool      *      protected $scanControllers = false;       **      * Determines whether or not to automatically          scan all namespaced      * classes for event, route, and model annotations.      *      * @var bool      *      protected $scanEverything = false;  }  Next, the AnnotationsServiceProvider.php file will need to be added to the  config app.php file. The class, which needs to be added with the namespace,  should be added to the providers array as follows:  'providers' => [        ...     'App\Providers\AnnotationsServiceProvider'   ];  Resource controller using DocBlock  annotations Now, to illustrate the use of Laravel's DocBlock annotations, we will examine   the steps.  First, we will create the accommodations controller as usual:  $ php artisan make:controller AccommodationsController  Next, we will add the accommodations controller to the list of the annotation   service provider's routes to scan:  protected $scanRoutes = [     'App\Http\Controllers\HomeController',     'App\Http\Controllers\AccommodationsController' ];  [ 115 ]   Now, we will add the DocBlock annotation to the controller. In this case, we  will instruct the parser to use this controller as a resource controller for the  accommodations route. The code to be added is as follows:   ** * @Resource " accommodations"  *   Since the whole controller will be turned into a resource, the DocBlock annotation  should be inserted before the class definition. The AccommodationsController   class should now be as follows:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;  use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response; use MyCompany\Http\Requests; use MyCompany\Http\Controllers\Controller; use MyCompany\Accommodation; use Illuminate\Http\Request;   ** * @Resource " accommodations"  *  class AccommodationsController extends Controller {       **      * Display a listing of the resource.      *      * @return Response      *      public function index Accommodation $accommodation      {         return $accommodation->paginate  ;     }  Note that double quotes are required here:  @Resource " accommodations"   The following syntax, using single quotes, would not be correct and  will not function:  @Resource ' accommodations'   [ 116 ]   Single method routing If we desire to just add one route to a single method, such as "search for  accommodation", then an annotation would be added above the single method;  however, this time, inside the class. To handle the GET HTTP request verb, the   code would be as follows:   **  * Search for an accommodation  * @Get " search-accommodation"   *   The class would be as follows:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;  use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Response; use MyCompany\Http\Requests; use MyCompany\Http\Controllers\Controller; use MyCompany\Accommodation; use Illuminate\Http\Request;  class AccommodationsController extends Controller {       **     * Search for an accommodation     * @Get " search-accommodation"      *      public function index Accommodation $accommodation      {         return $accommodation->paginate  ;     }  Scanning routes The next step is extremely important. The Laravel application must process the  annotations. For this chore, Artisan is used to scan the routes.  The following command is used to scan the routes. The output will be Routes  scanned! as shown here:  $ php artisan route:scan  Routes scanned!  [ 117 ]   The results of this scan will produce a file named routes.scanned.php in the  storage framework directory.  The following code writes to storage framework routes.scanned.php file:  $router->get 'search-accommodation', [   'uses' => 'MyCompany\Http\Controllers\AccommodationsController@ search',   'as' => NULL,   'middleware' => [],   'where' => [],   'domain' => NULL, ] ;  Note that the storage framework routes.scanned.php file does  not need to be put into source code control as it is generated.  Automatic scanning If a developer has to execute the Artisan route scan command as the controllers   are being built, the effort to do this could become tedious. As a convenience to   the developer, there is way to have Laravel automatically scan the controllers   in the scanRoutes array on every request to the framework while in the  development mode.  In the AnnotationsServiceProvider.php file, set the scanWhenLocal attribute   to true.  The same is true for $scanControllers and $scanEverything; these two Boolean  flags allow the framework to automatically scan the App\Http\Controllers  directory, and any class that is namespaced, respectively. It is imperative to remember that this should only be used during development   and on a development machine, since it will add unnecessary overhead to the  request cycle. An example of how the attributes are set to true is shown in the  following code:  <?php namespace App\Providers;  use Collective\Annotations\AnnotationsServiceProvider as  ServiceProvider;  [ 118 ]   class AnnotationsServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {       **      * The classes to scan for event annotations.      *      * @var array      *      protected $scanEvents = [];          …       **      * Determines if we will auto-scan in the local environment.      *      * @var bool      *      protected $scanWhenLocal = true;       **      * Determines whether or not to automatically scan the controllers      * directory  App\Http\Controllers  for routes      *      * @var bool      *      protected $scanControllers = true;       **      * Determines whether or not to automatically scan all namespaced      * classes for event, route, and model annotations.      *      * @var bool      *      protected $scanEverything = true;  }  Enabling these options will slow down the framework, but allow flexibility in the  development phase.  [ 119 ]   Additional annotations To pass an ID to a route, as is common during the display of a single  accommodation, the code would be as follows:   ** * Display the specified resource. * @Get " accommodation {id}"  *   This DocBlock annotation would be placed above the function inside the class,   which is similar to the previous example.  To limit the ID to one or more digits, an @Where annotation can be used as follows:  @Where {"id": "\d+"}   Both the annotations are combined together as shown in the following code:  To add middleware to the example, which limits the request to only authenticated  users, the @Middleware annotation may be used:   **  * Display the specified resource.  * @Get " accommodation {id}"   * @Where {"id": "\d+"}   *    **  * Display the specified resource.  * @Get " accommodation {id}"   * @Where {"id": "\d+"}   * @Middleware "auth"   *   HTTP verbs The following is a list of the various HTTP verbs that can use annotations,   that mirror RESTful standards:     @Delete: This verb deletes a resource.    @Get: This verb displays a resource or resources.    @Options: This verb displays a list of options.  [ 120 ]      @Patch: This verb modifies an attribute or attributes of a resource.    @Post: This verb creates a new resource.    @Put: This verb modifies a resource.  Other annotations There are additional annotations that also may be used in controllers.   The annotations are as follows:     @Any: This responds to any HTTP request.    @Controller: This creates a controller for a resource.    @Middleware: This adds middleware to a resource.    @Route: This enables a route.    @Where: This limits requests based on certain criteria.    @Resource: This enables a resource.  Using annotations in Laravel 5 Let us recall the pathway that was implemented in Laravel, as illustrated here:     The HTTP request gets routed to a controller    The command is instantiated inside of the controller    An event is fired    The event is handled  Laravel's modern command-based pub-sub pathway.  [ 121 ]   Using annotations, this process can be rendered even easier. First, a reservations  controller will be created:  $ php artisan make:controller ReservationsController  To create a route to allow the user to create a new reservation, the POST HTTP   verb will be used. The @Post annotation will listen to requests with the POST   method attached to the  bookRoom url. This is used in place of the route that   would normally be found inside of the routes.php file:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;  If we want to limit requests to a valid URL, the domain parameter limits requests to  a certain URL. Additionally, the auth middleware requires the authentication of any  request that wishes to reserve a room:  use ...  class ReservationsController extends Controller {  ** * @Post " bookRoom"  *    public function reserve     {   }  <?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;  use …  ** * @Controller domain="booking.hotelwebsite.com"  *   class ReservationsController extends Controller {   ** * @Post " bookRoom"  * @Middleware "auth"  *    public function reserve     {  [ 122 ]   Next, the ReserveRoom command should be created. This command will be  instantiated inside the controller:  $ php artisan make:command ReserveRoom  Contents of the ReserveRoom Command are as follows:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Commands;  use MyCompany\Commands\Command; use MyCompany\User; use MyCompany\Accommodation\Room; use MyCompany\Events\RoomWasReserved;  use Illuminate\Contracts\Bus\SelfHandling;  class ReserveRoomCommand extends Command implements SelfHandling {      public function __construct     {   }    **    * Execute the command.    *    public function handle     {   } }  Next, we will need to instantiate the ReserveRoom command from inside the  reservation controller:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;  use MyCompany\Accommodation\Reservation; use MyCompany\Commands\PlaceOnWaitingListCommand; use MyCompany\Commands\ReserveRoomCommand; use MyCompany\Events\RoomWasReserved; use MyCompany\Http\Requests; use MyCompany\Http\Controllers\Controller; use MyCompany\User; use MyCompany\Accommodation\Room;  [ 123 ]   use Illuminate\Http\Request;  class ReservationsController extends Controller {   **  * @Post " bookRoom"   * @Middleware "auth"   *    public function reserve     {      $this->dispatch      new ReserveRoom \Auth::user  ,$start_date,$end_date,$rooms       ;   }  Now we will create the RoomWasReserved event:  $ php artisan make:event RoomWasReserved  To instantiate the RoomWasReserved event from the  ReserveRoom handler,   we may take advantage of the event   helper method. In this example, the  command is self-handling, thus it is simple to do this:  <?php namespace App\Commands;  use App\Commands\Command; use Illuminate\Contracts\Bus\SelfHandling;  class ReserveRoom extends Command implements SelfHandling {     public function __construct User $user,         $start_date, $end_date, $rooms      {     }     public function handle       {         $reservation = Reservation::createNew  ;         event new RoomWasReserved $reservation  ;     } }  Since the user needs to be sent the details of the room reservation email, the next  step is to create an e-mail sender handler for the RoomWasReserved event. To do this,  artisan is used again to create the handler:  $ php artisan handler:event RoomReservedEmail –event=RoomWasReserved  [ 124 ]   The methods of the SendEmail handler for the RoomWasReserved event are simply  constructor and handler. The job of sending the e-mail would be performed inside  the handler method. The @Hears annotation is added to its DocBlock to complete the  process:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Handlers\Events;  use MyCompany\Events\RoomWasReserved;  use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue; use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldBeQueued;  class RoomReservedEmail {   public function __construct     {   }     **    * Handle the event.    * @Hears "\App\Events\RoomWasReserved"     * @param  RoomWasReserved  $event    *    public function handle RoomWasReserved $event    {        TODO: send email to $event->user   } }  Simply add RoomReservedEmail to the scanEvents array to allow that event to be  scanned as follows:  protected $scanEvents = [    'App\Handlers\Events\RoomReservedEmail' ];  The last step is to import. Artisan is used to scan events for annotations and write to  the output file:  $ php artisan event:scan    Events scanned!  [ 125 ]   Here is the output of the storage framework events.scanned.php file, which  shows the event listener:   listen array 0 => 'App\\Events\\RoomWasReserved',  , App\Handlers\Events\RoomReservedEmail@handle' ;  The final view of the scanned annotation files inside the storage directory is as  follows. Note that they are parallel:  storage framework events.scanned.php  storage framework routes.scanned.php  Laravel uses artisan to cache routes, but not to scan events, so the  following command produces a cached file: $ php artisan route:cache Route cache cleared! Routes cached successfully! The route:scan command must be run before the route:cache is  run, so it is important to execute the two commands in this order: $ php artisan route:scan Routes scanned!  $ php artisan route:cache Route cache cleared! Routes cached successfully! This command writes to: storage framework routes.php.  <?php  app 'router' ->setRoutes    unserialize base64_decode       'TzozNDoiSWxsdW1pbmF0ZVxSb3V0aW5nXFd…'    ;  Both the files will be created, but only the compiled routes.php file is  used until php artisan route:scan is run again.  [ 126 ]   Advantages There are several principle advantages of using DocBlock annotations for routing   in Laravel:     Each controller remains independent. The controller is not "tied" to a separate   route and this makes sharing controllers, and moving them from project  to project, easier. The routes.php file may be viewed as unnecessary for a  simple project with only a few controllers.     Developers need not worry about routes.php. When working with other  developers, the routes file needs to be kept continually in synchronization.  With the DocBlock annotations approach, the routes.php file is cached  and not placed under source code control; each developer may simply  concentrate on his or her controllers.     The route annotation keeps the route together with the controller. When   controllers and routes are separate, and when a new programmer reads the  code for the first time, it may not be immediately clear to which routes each  controller method is attached. By placing the route directly in the DocBlock  above the function, it is immediately evident.     Developers that are familiar with, and are used to, using annotations in  frameworks, such as Symfony and Zend may find using annotations in  Laravel to be a very convenient way of developing software applications.  Also, Java and C developers using Laravel as their first PHP experience will  find annotations very convenient.  Conclusion The decision about whether or not to use annotations in a software lies with the  developer. The decision to remove it from the core of Laravel, as well as the HTML  forms packages, shows that the framework is becoming more and more flexible,  having as default only a minimum set of packages. This allows for stability and less  maintenance for the core developers as Laravel moves towards a long-term-support   LTS  release with Laravel 5.1. Since the annotations package is part of the Laravel Collective, support for this  package will be managed by the team, which guarantees that the feature's usefulness  will be extended and expanded with contributions through to the repository.  Also, the package could be extended to include a template that is automatically  created with the route annotation that has the same name as the controller. This  would save yet another step in the process of creating a controller and route—one of  the most essential yet monotonous tasks in the software development process.  [ 127 ]   Summary In this chapter, we have learned about annotations, how they are used in  programming in general, how they are used in other frameworks, and finally   how their use has been adopted into the Laravel annotation composer package.  We have learned how to speed up the development process through the use of  annotations and how to automate the scanning of annotations. In the next chapter we  will learn about middleware, which is a mechanism used in the middle between the  route and the application.  [ 128 ]   Filtering Requests with  Middleware  In this chapter, middleware will be discussed in detail and examples from the  accommodation software will be provided. Middleware is a great mechanism to  help separate a software application into separate layers. To illustrate this principle,  middleware provides layers of protection around the innermost part of the  application, which could be thought of as the kernel.  In Laravel 4, middleware was known as filters. These filters were used in routing   to perform actions that came before the controller like authentication, where   the user would be filtered based on certain criteria. Also, the filters could come   after the controller.  In Laravel 5, the concept of middleware, which was already present but not  prominent in Laravel 4, is now brought into the foreground into the actual request  workflow and can be used in various ways. Think of it as a Russian doll, where each  doll represents a layer in the application—having the correct credentials will allow  us to enter deeper into the application.  The HTTP kernel The file located at app Http Kernel.php is a file that manages the configuration   of the kernel of the program. The basic structure is as follows:  <?php namespace App\Http;  use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel as HttpKernel;  [ 129 ]   class Kernel extends HttpKernel {     **    * The application's global HTTP middleware stack.    *    * @var array    *    protected $middleware = [   'Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode',     'Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\EncryptCookies',     'Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse',     'Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession',     'Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession',     'Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\VerifyCsrfToken',   ];     **    * The application's route middleware.    *    * @var array    *    protected $routeMiddleware = [     'auth' => 'App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate',     'auth.basic' =>       'Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateWithBasicAuth',     'guest' => 'App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated',   ];  }  The $middleware array is a list of middleware classes and their namespace, and it is  executed at every request. The $routeMiddleware array is a key and value array that  is created as list of aliases that can be used together with routes to filter requests.  The basic middleware structure The routing middleware classes implement the Middleware interface:  <?php namespace Illuminate\Contracts\Routing;  use Closure;  [ 130 ]   interface Middleware {     **    * Handle an incoming request.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request    * @param  \Closure  $next    * @return mixed    *    public function handle $request, Closure $next ;  }  In any class that implements this base class, there must be a handle method that  accepts the $request as well as a Closure.  The basic structure of a middleware is as follows:  <?php namespace Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware;  use Closure; use Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\Middleware; use Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application; use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\HttpException;  class CheckForMaintenanceMode implements Middleware {     **    * The application implementation.    *    * @var \Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application    *    protected $app;     **    * Create a new filter instance.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Contracts\Foundation\Application  $app    * @return void    *    public function __construct Application $app    {  [ 131 ]       $this->app = $app;   }     **    * Handle an incoming request.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request    * @param  \Closure  $next    * @return mixed    *    public function handle $request, Closure $next    {     if  $this->app->isDownForMaintenance        {       throw new HttpException 503 ;     }     return $next $request ;   } }  Here, the CheckForMaintenanceMode middleware does exactly as its name   suggests: the handle method checks if the application is in application mode.   The isDownForMaintenance method of the app is called and if it returns true,   then a 503 HTTP exception will be returned and execution of the method will   stop. Otherwise, the $next closure with the $request parameter is returned   to the calling class.  Middleware such as CheckForMaintenanceMode could be  removed from the $middleware array and moved into the  $routeMiddleware array to not require it to be executed upon  every request, but only when desired from a certain route.  Route middleware unravelled Two route-based middleware classes are present in Laravel 5 in app Http  Middleware . One of these classes is named Authenticate. It provides basic  authentication and uses a contract.  [ 132 ]   In reference to routes, the middleware sits between the route and the controller:  Default middleware – the Authenticate class A class called Authenticate.php has the following code:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Middleware;  use Closure; use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Guard;  class Authenticate {    **    * The Guard implementation.    *    * @var Guard    *    protected $auth;     **    * Create a new filter instance.    *    * @param  Guard  $auth    * @return void    *    public function __construct Guard $auth    {  [ 133 ]       $this->auth = $auth;   }     **    * Handle an incoming request.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request    * @param  \Closure  $next    * @return mixed    *    public function handle $request, Closure $next    {     if  $this->auth->guest        {       if  $request->ajax          {         return response 'Unauthorized.', 401 ;       }       else       {         return redirect  ->guest 'auth login' ;       }     }     return $next $request ;   } }  The first thing to note is Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Guard, which handles the  logic to check whether or not a user is logged in. It is injected into the constructor.  Contracts Notice that the concept of a contract is a new way of using an interface to provide a  nonconcrete class to separate the actual class from the calling class. This provides a  nice layer of separation and allows the underlying class to be easily switched out if  needed, while maintaining the parameters and return types of the methods.  [ 134 ]   Handle The handle class is where the real work is done. The $request object is passed in  along with the $next closure. What happens next is really simple yet important. The  code asks if the current user is a guest, that is, not authenticated or logged in. If the  user is not logged in, then the method will not allow the user to access the next step.  If the request has arrived via Ajax, then a 401 message is returned to the browser.  If the request does not arrive via an Ajax request, the code assumes that the request  has arrived via a standard page request and the user is directed to the auth login  page which allows the user to log in to the application. Otherwise, if the user is  authenticated  guest   is not equal to true , then the $next closure is returned to  the software application with the $request object as its parameter. To summarize,  the execution of the application is stopped only if the user is not authenticated;  otherwise, the execution continues.  The important thing to remember is that, in this case, the $request object is returned  to the software.  Custom middleware – Log It is simple to create custom middleware using Artisan. The artisan command   is as follows:  $ php artisan make:middleware LogMiddleware  Our LogMiddleware class needs to be added to the $middleware array in the   Http Kernel.php file as shown here:  protected $middleware = [   'Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\CheckForMaintenanceMode',   'Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\EncryptCookies',   'Illuminate\Cookie\Middleware\AddQueuedCookiesToResponse',   'Illuminate\Session\Middleware\StartSession',   'Illuminate\View\Middleware\ShareErrorsFromSession',   'MyCompany\Http\Middleware\LogMiddleware' ];  [ 135 ]   The LogMiddleware class is the name given to a middleware class that will be used  to log users that use a website. The class produced has only one method, namely  handle. As the authentication middleware, it accepts the $request object as well as  the $next closure:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Middleware;  use Closure;  class LogMiddleware {     **    * Handle an incoming request.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request    * @param  \Closure  $next    * @return mixed    *    public function handle $request, Closure $next    {     return $next $request ;   } }  In this case, we want to simply log both the user ID and the date and time at which  some action was performed. The $request object is assigned to the $response object  and the $response object is returned instead of $next. The code is as follows:  public function handle $request, Closure $next  {   $response = $next $request ;   Log::create ['user_id'=>\Auth::user  ->id,'created_at'=>date "Y-     m-d H:i:s" ] ;   return $response; }  The Log model Create the Log model using the following command:  $php artisan make:model Log  [ 136 ]   Set the Log model to use a table named log instead of logs by using the protected  $table attribute. Next, set the model to not use a timestamp by setting the public  $timestamps attribute to false. Finally, allow both the user_id and created_at  fields to be populated at the same time by setting the protected $fillable attribute  to an array of the fields that are desired to be filled, allowing use of the create  function. The class will look like this after the preceding modifications:  <?php namespace MyCompany;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class Log extends Model {     protected $table = 'log';     public $timestamps = false;     protected $fillable = ['user_id','created_at']; }  We could also create the Log model as a polymorphic model, allowing it to be used  in more than one context by added the following code to the Log model:  public function loggable   {      return $this->morphTo  ; }  More information regarding this is available in the  Laravel documentation.  Log model migration It is necessary to adjust the database migrations [date_time]_create_logs_ table.php migration to use the log table and not logs. It is also necessary to create  two fields: user_id, an unsigned small integer, and created_at, a datetime field  that will mimic the Laravel timestamp format. The code is as follows:  <?php  use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint; use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;  [ 137 ]   class CreateLogsTable extends Migration {     **    * Run the migrations.    *    * @return void    *    public function up     {     Schema::create 'log', function Blueprint $table      {       $table->smallInteger 'user_id' ->unsigned  ;       $table->dateTime 'created_at' ;     } ;   }     **    * Reverse the migrations.    *    * @return void    *    public function down     {     Schema::drop 'log' ;   } }  Terminable middleware In addition to performing operations after the request arrives or after the response  arrives, it is possible to perform actions even after the response is sent to the browser.  The class adds the terminate method and implements TerminableMiddleware:  use Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\TerminableMiddleware;  class StartSession implements TerminableMiddleware {      public function handle $request, $next      {         return $next $request ;     }  [ 138 ]       public function terminate $request, $response      {            Store the session data...     } }  Logging as terminable We could easily perform the logging of the user inside the terminate function   as follows, since the logging could be the last action to occur in the lifecycle.   The code is as follows:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Middleware;  use Closure; use Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\TerminableMiddleware; use MyCompany\Log;  class LogMiddleware implements TerminableMiddleware {    **    * Handle an incoming request.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request    * @param  \Closure  $next    * @return mixed    *    public function handle $request, Closure $next    {     return  $next $request ;    }    **    * Terminate the request.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Response $response    *    public function terminate $request, $response    {     Log::create ['user_id'=>\Auth::user  -       >id,'created_at'=>date "Y-m-d H:i:s" ] ;    } }  The code has been placed into the terminate method, so it is outside the   request-response pathway, allowing the code to remain clean.  [ 139 ]   Using middleware If we want it that a user must be authenticated before being able to perform a  certain operation, we can pass an array as the second parameter with middleware  as the key to force the route to call the auth middleware on the search method of  AccommodationsController:  Route::get 'search-accommodation',   ['middleware' => 'auth','AccommodationsController@search'] ;  In this case, the user will be redirected to the login page if not authenticated.  Route groups Routes may be grouped together to share the same middleware. For example, if we  want to protect all of the routes in our application, we can create a route group and  just pass in the key-value pair middleware and auth. The code is as follows:  Route::group ['middleware' => 'auth'], function   {   Route::resource 'accommodations', 'AccommodationsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.amenities',     'AccommodationsAmenitiesController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.rooms',     'AccommodationsRoomsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.locations',     'AccommodationsLocationsController' ;   Route::resource 'amenities', 'AmenitiesController' ;   Route::resource 'rooms', 'RoomsController' ;   Route::resource 'locations', 'LocationsController' ; }   This protects every method of every route that lies inside the route group.  Multiple middleware in route groups If even more protection is desired against nonauthenticated users, we could   create a whitelist to only allow users within a certain range of IP addresses   to access the application.  The following command will create the middleware that is needed:  $ php artisan make:middleware WhitelistMiddleware  [ 140 ]   The WhitelistMiddleware class looks like this:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Middleware;  use Closure;  class WhitelistMiddleware {     private $whitelist = ['192.2.3.211'];    **    * Handle an incoming request.    *    * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request    * @param  \Closure  $next    * @return mixed    *    public function handle $request, Closure $next    {     if  in_array $request->getClientIp  ,$this->whitelist   {       return $next $request ;     } else {       return response 'Unauthorized.', 401 ;     }    } }  Here, a private $whitelist array was created with a list of the IP addresses that  are set up within a company. Then, the remote port of the request is compared to  the values in the array, and it is allowed to continue by returning the $next closure.  Otherwise, an unauthorized response is returned.  Now, the whitelist middleware needs to be combined with the auth middleware.  To use the whitelist middleware within the route group, an alias for the  middleware needs to be created and inserted into the app Http Kernel.php file in  the $routeMiddleware array. The code is as follows:  protected $routeMiddleware = [   'auth' => 'MyCompany\Http\Middleware\Authenticate',   'auth.basic' => 'Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\ AuthenticateWithBasicAuth',   'guest' => 'MyCompany\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated',   'log' => 'MyCompany\Http\Middleware\LogMiddleware',   'whitelist' => 'MyCompany\Http\Middleware\WhitelistMiddleware' ];  [ 141 ]   Next, to add this to the list of middlewares for this route group, it is necessary to  substitute the string auth with an array, having both auth and whitelist as its  contents. The code is as follows:  Route::group ['middleware' => ['auth','whitelist']], function   {   Route::resource 'accommodations', 'AccommodationsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.amenities',             'AccommodationsAmenitiesController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.rooms',     'AccommodationsRoomsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.locations',     'AccommodationsLocationsController' ;   Route::resource 'amenities', 'AmenitiesController' ;   Route::resource 'rooms', 'RoomsController' ;   Route::resource 'locations', 'LocationsController' ; } ;  Now, even if the user is logged in, it will not be possible to access the protected  content unless the IP address is in the whitelist.  Also, if only some of the routes are desired to be whitelisted, routes group may be  nested as follows:  Route::group ['middleware' => 'auth', function   {   Route::resource 'accommodations', 'AccommodationsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.amenities',             'AccommodationsAmenitiesController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.rooms',     'AccommodationsRoomsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.locations',     'AccommodationsLocationsController' ;   Route::resource 'amenities', 'AmenitiesController' ;   Route::group ['middleware' => 'whitelist'], function     {     Route::resource 'rooms', 'RoomsController' ;   } ;   Route::resource 'locations', 'LocationsController' ; } ;  This will require both authentication  auth  and whitelisting for the  RoomsController, while all of the other controllers inside the route group will  require only authentication.  [ 142 ]   Middleware exclusion and inclusion If it is desired to perform authentication or whitelisting only for certain routes,  then the constructor method should be added to the controller and the middleware  method of the class could be used as follows:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Http\Controllers;  use MyCompany\Http\Requests; use MyCompany\Http\Controllers\Controller; use Illuminate\Http\Request; use MyCompany\Accommodation\Room;  class RoomsController extends Controller {    public function __construct     {     $this->middleware 'auth',['except' => ['index','show'] ;   }  The first parameter is the key of the $routeMiddleware array in the Kernel.php  file. The second parameter is a key and value array. The options are either except  or only. The except option is obviously the exclusion, while the only option is the  inclusion. In the preceding example, the auth middleware will be applied to all  methods except for the index or show methods, which are the two read methods   they do not modify the data . Instead, if the log middleware should be applied on  index and show, then the following constructor would be used:    public function __construct     {     $this->middleware 'log',['only' => ['index','show'] ;   }  As expected, both approaches are applied as follows and the whitelist middleware  is added in as well:  public function __construct   {   $this->middleware 'whitelist',['except' => ['index','show'] ;   $this->middleware 'auth',['except' => ['index','show'] ;   $this->middleware 'log',['only' => ['index','show'] ; }  This code would require authentication and a whitelisted IP address for all non-read  operations, while it logs any requests to index and show.  [ 143 ]   Conclusion Middleware can skillfully filter requests and secure the application or RESTful API  from unwanted requests. It can also perform logging and redirect any requests that  fall within a certain criteria.  Middleware can also provide added functionality to the existing application. For  example, Laravel provides the EncryptCookies and AddQueuedCookiesToResponse  middleware to deal with cookies, while StartSession and  ShareErrorsFromSession deal with sessions.  The code inside AddQueuedCookiesToResponse does not filter the request, but rather  adds to it:  public function handle $request, Closure $next    {     $response = $next $request ;     foreach  $this->cookies->getQueuedCookies   as $cookie      {       $response->headers->setCookie $cookie ;     }     return $response;   }  Summary In this chapter, we looked at middleware, which is a useful mechanism for any  functionality that should either be executed for each and every request or attached  to certain routes. It is a flexible mechanism and allows the programmer to code to an  interface, since any middleware class that implements the Middleware interface must  include the handle method. Following good development principles is not only  encouraged, but rather required through this type of structure.  In the next chapter, we will discuss the Eloquent ORM.  [ 144 ]   Querying the Database with  the Eloquent ORM  In the previous chapters, you learned how build the basic components of an  application. In this chapter the Eloquent ORM, another one of the best features   that makes Laravel so popular, will be introduced.  In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:   	 Basic query statements  	 One-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relations  	 Polymorphic relations  	 Eager loading  An ORM, or object relational mapping, explained in the simplest sense, turns a table  into a class, its columns into attributes, and its rows into instances of that class. It  creates an abstraction layer between the developer and the database and allows for  easier programming, since it uses the familiar object-oriented paradigm.  We shall assume that we have a posts table with the following structure:  id  contents  author_id  [ 145 ]   To illustrate this example, the following would be the representation of a posts table:  To add in the id, contents, and author_id attributes, we will add the following  code to the class:  <?php namespace MyBlog;  class Post { }  class Post {     private $id;     private $contents;     private $author_id;      public function getId       {         return $this->id;     }      public function setId $id      {         $this->id = $id;     }      public function getContents       {         return $this->contents;     }      public function setContents $contents      {         $this->contents = $contents;     }      public function getAuthorId       {         return $this->author_id;     }      public function setAuthorId $author_id      {  [ 146 ]           $this->author_id = $author_id;     }  }  This gives us an overview of how a table may be represented by a class: the Post  class represents an entity that has a collection of posts. If the active record pattern was followed, then Eloquent can automatically manage  all of the class names, key names, and their related relations. The power of Eloquent  lies in its ability to give the programmer the ability to use object-oriented methods to  manage the relations between the classes.  Basic operations We will now discuss some of the basic operations. There are virtually hundreds of  ways to use Eloquent, and certainly every developer will use Eloquent in the best  way for their project. The following techniques are the basic building blocks upon  which more complex queries may be developed.  Finding one One of the most basic operations is to perform the following query:  select from rooms where id=1;  This is accomplished by using the find   method.  The Room facade is called with the find method, which accepts the ID as an  argument:  MyCompany\Accommodation\Room::find $id ;  Since Eloquent is based on the fluent query builder, any fluent method may   be mixed and matched. Some of the fluent methods are chainable and others   execute the query.  The find   method actually executes the query, so it always needs to be at the end  of the expression.  [ 147 ]   If the ID of the model is not found, then nothing is returned. To force a  ModelNotFoundException, which can then be trapped to perform some other  operation such as logging, add OrFail as follows:  MyCompany\Accommodation\Room::findOrFail $id ;  The where method To query an attribute  column  other than ID, use the following command:  select from accommodations where name='Lovely Hotel';  Use the where method followed by the get   method:  MyCompany\Accommodation::where 'name','Lovely Hotel' ->get  ;  The like comparator may be used as follows:  MyCompany\Accommodation::where 'name','like','%Lovely%' ->get  ;  Chaining functions Multiple where methods can be chained as follows:  MyCompany\Accommodation::where 'name','Lovely Hotel' -     >where 'city','like','%Pittsburgh%' ->get  ;  The preceding command produces the following query:  select * from accommodations where name ='Lovely Hotel' and     description like '%Pittsburgh%'  Notice that if the where comparator is =  equals , then the second parameter  the  comparator  is not needed, and the second part of the comparison is passed into the  function. Also, note that an and operation is added between the two where methods.  To achieve an or operation, the following change has to be made to the code:  MyCompany\Accommodation::where 'name','Lovely Hotel' -     >orWhere 'description','like','%Pittsburgh%' ->get  ;  Notice that or is added to the where creating orWhere  .  [ 148 ]   Finding all To find all of the rooms, the all   method is used in place of find. Notice that this  method actually executes the query:  MyCompany\Accommodation\Room::all  ;  To limit the number of rooms, the take method is used in place of find. Since take  is chainable, get is needed to execute the query:  MyCompany\Accommodation\Room::take 10 ->get  ;  To achieve pagination, the following query may be used:  MyCompany\Accommodation\Room::paginate  ;  By default, the preceding query will return a JSON object as follows:  {"total":15,        "per_page":15, "current_page":1,      "last_page":1, "next_page_url":null,   "prev_page_url":null, "from":1,        "to":15, "data":[ {"id":9,"name":"LovelyHotel","description":"Lovely Hotel Greater     Pittsburgh","location_id":1,"created_at":null,"updated_at":     "2015-03-13     22:00:23","deleted_at":null,"franchise_id":1},{"id":12,     "name":"Grand Hotel","description":"Grand Hotel Greater     Cleveland","location_id":2,"created_at":"2015-02-     0820:09:35","updated_at":"2015-02-     0820:09:35","deleted_at":null,"franchise_id":1} ...  Attributes such as total, per_page, current_page, and last_page are used to give  the developer an easy way to implement paging, while the array of data is returned  inside of an array called data.  [ 149 ]   Eloquent relations Relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many  or many-to-one , and many-to-many  are familiar to database programmers. Laravel's Eloquent has brought these concepts  into an object-oriented environment. Additionally, Eloquent has even more powerful  tools such as polymorphic relations, where entities can be related to more than  one other entity. In the following examples, we will see the relationship between  accommodations, rooms, and amenities.  [ 150 ]   One-to-one The first relation is one-to-one. In our example software, we can use the example  of a room in our accommodation. A room may only  at least easily  belong to  one accommodation, so the room belongs to the accommodation. Inside the Room  Eloquent model, the following code tells Eloquent that the room belongs to the  accommodation function:  class Room extends Eloquent {      public function accommodation        {          return $this->belongsTo 'MyCompany\Accommodation' ;      } }  Sometimes, the database tables do not follow the active record pattern, especially  if the programmer inherits a legacy database. If the database used a table called  bedroom instead of rooms, then the class would add an attribute to indicate the   table name:  class Room extends Eloquent {     protected $table = 'bedroom'; }  When the following route code is executed, then the accommodation object will be  returned as a JSON object:  Route::get 'test-relation',function  {     $room = MyCompany\Accommodation\Room::find 1 ;     return $room->accommodation; } ;  The response will be as follows:  {"id":9,"name":"LovelyHotel","description":"Lovely Hotel Greater     Pittsburgh","location_id":1,"created_at":null,"updated_at":     "2015-03-13 22:00:23","deleted_at":null}  [ 151 ]   One common mistake is to use the following command:  return $room->accommodation  ;  In this case, the programmer expects to return the model. This will  return the actual belongsTo relation and in the context of the  RESTful API, there will be an error thrown:  Object of class     Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo  could     not be converted to string  This is because Laravel can convert the JSON object to a string, but not  a relationship.  The SQL run is as follows:  select * from rooms where rooms.id = '1' limit 1 select * from accommodations where accommodations.id = '9' limit 1  Eloquent tends to favor multiple simpler queries as opposed to doing larger joins.  First the room is found. Then, limit 1 is added because find is only used to find a  single entity or row. Once the accommodation_id is found, the next query will find  the accommodation with that corresponding ID and return the object. If the active  record pattern was followed, the SQL that Eloquent produces is extremely readable.  One-to-many The second relation is one-to-many. In our example software, we can use the  example of an accommodation having many rooms. Since rooms may belong  to one accommodation, then the the accommodation has many rooms. Inside  the Accommodation Eloquent model, the following code tells Eloquent that the  accommodation has many rooms.  class Accommodation {     public function rooms  {         return $this->hasMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Room' ;     } }  [ 152 ]   In a similar route, the following code is run. This time, a collection of rooms objects  will be returned as JSON-formatted objects inside an array:  Route::get 'test-relation',function  {     $accommodation = MyCompany\Accommodation::find 9 ;     return $accommodation->rooms; } ;  The response will be the following array:  [{"id":1,"room_number":0,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,     "deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9},{"id":3,"room_number":     12,"created_at":"2015-03-14 08:52:25","updated_at":"2015-03-14      08:52:25","deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9},{"id":6,     "room_number":12,"created_at":"2015-03-14      09:03:36","updated_at":"2015-03-14      09:03:36","deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9},{"id":     14,"room_number":12,"created_at":"2015-03-14      09:26:36","updated_at":"2015-03-     1409:26:36","deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9}]  The SQL run is as follows:  select * from accommodations where accommodations.id = ? limit 1 select * from rooms where rooms.accommodation_id = '9' and      rooms.accommodation_id is not null  As before, the accommodation is found. The second query will find the rooms  that belong to that accommodation. A check is added to confirm that the  accommodation_id is not null.  Many-to-many In our example software application, the relationship between amenity and room  is many-to-many. Each room can have many amenities, such as Internet access  and a Jacuzzi, and each amenity is shared among many rooms: every room in an  accommodation could and should have internet access! The following code, which uses a  belongsToMany relationship, enables an amenity to belong to many rooms:  class Amenity {   public function rooms  {         return $this-           >belongsToMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Room' ;     } }  [ 153 ]   The test route, which tells us how each room has a certain amenity, is written   as follows:  Route::get 'test-relation',function  {     $amenity = MyCompany\Accommodation\Amenity::find 3 ;     return $amenity->rooms; } ;  A list of rooms is returned:  [{"id":1,"room_number":0,"created_at":2015-03-14     08:10:45,"updated_at":null,"deleted_at":null,     "accommodation_id":9},{"id":5,"room_number":12,     "created_at":"2015-03-14 09:00:38","updated_at":"2015-03-14",     09:00:38","deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":12}, ...]  The SQL executed is as follows:  select * from amenities where amenities.id = ? limit 1 select rooms.*, amenity_room.amenity_id as pivot_amenity_id,     amenity_room.room_id as pivot_room_id from rooms inner join     amenity_room on rooms.id = amenity_room.room_id where     amenity_room.amenity_id = 3  We recall the belongToMany relationship that returns the rooms that have a  particular amenity:  class Amenity {    public function rooms  {         return $this-           >belongsToMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Room' ;     } }  Eloquent skillfully gives us the corresponding belongsToMany relationship to  determine which amenities a particular room has. The syntax is exactly the same:  class Room {      public function amenities  {          return $this-            >belongsToMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Amenity' ;      }  }  [ 154 ]   The test route is virtually the same, just substituting amenities for rooms:  Route::get 'test-relation',function  {     $room = MyCompany\Accommodation\Room::find 1 ;     return $room->amenities; } ;  The result is a list of amenities for the room with ID 1:  [{"id":1,"name":"Wifi","description":"Wireless Internet     Access","created_at":"2015-03-1409:00:38","updated_at":    "2015-03-14 09:00:38","deleted_at":null},{"id":2,"name":     "Jacuzzi","description":"Hot tub","created_at":"2015-03-14     09:00:38","updated_at":null,"deleted_at":null},{"id":3,"name":     "Safe","description":"Safe deposit box for protecting     valuables","created_at":"2015-03-1409:00:38","updated_at":     "2015-03-1409:00:38","deleted_at":null}]  The query used is as follows:  select * from rooms where rooms.id = 1 limit 1 select amenities.*, amenity_room.room_id as pivot_room_id,     amenity_room.amenity_id as pivot_amenity_id from amenities inner     join amenity_room on amenities.id = amenity_room.amenity_id     where amenity_room.room_id = '1'  The query, substituting room_id for amenity_id and rooms for amenities,   is clearly parallel.  Has-many-through One great feature of Eloquent is "has-many-through". What if the requirements of the  software change and we are asked to group some of the accommodations together  into franchises? If an application user would like to search for a room, any of the  rooms in any of the accommodations that belong to that franchise could be found. A  franchises table will be added, and a nullable column to the accommodations table  called franchise_id will be added. This will optionally allow for an accommodation  to belong to a franchise. Rooms already belong to accommodations through the  accommodation_id column.  A room belongs to an accommodation through its accommodation_id key, while an  accommodation belongs to a franchise through its franchise_id key.  [ 155 ]   Eloquent allows us to retrieve the rooms associated to a franchise by using  hasManyThrough:  <?php namespace MyCompany;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class Franchise extends Model {      public function rooms       {         return $this-           >hasManyThrough '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Room',           '\MyCompany\Accommodation' ;     } }  The hasManyThrough relationship takes the target or the "has" as its first parameter   in this case, the room  and its "through" as the second parameter  in this case, the  accommodation . The logic stated as a phrase is: This franchise has many rooms through its  accommodations.  Using the previous test route, the code is written as follows:  Route::get 'test-relation',function  {     $franchise = MyCompany\Franchise::find 1 ;     return $franchise->rooms; } ;  The rooms are returned as an array as would be expected:  [{"id":1,"room_number":0,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,    "deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9,"franchise_id":1},     {"id":3,"room_number":12,"created_at":"2015-03-14     08:52:25","updated_at":"2015-03-14     08:52:25","deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9,     "franchise_id":1},{"id":6,"room_number":12,"created_at":    "2015-03-14 09:03:36","updated_at":"2015-03-14     09:03:36","deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9,     "franchise_id":1}, ]  [ 156 ]   The queries executed are as follows:  select * from franchises where franchises.id = ? limit 1 select rooms.*, accommodations.franchise_id from rooms inner join     accommodations on accommodations.id = rooms.accommodation_id     where accommodations.franchise_id = 1  Polymorphic relations One great feature of Eloquent is the possibility to have an entity whose relationship  is polymorphic. The two parts of the word, poly and morphic, are from the Greek  language. Since poly means many and morphic means shape, we can now easily  imagine a relationship having multiple forms.  Amenitiable relationships An amenity in our example software is something that is associated with a room,  such as a Jacuzzi. Certain amenities, such as covered parking or an airport shuttle  service, could also relate to an accommodation itself. We could create two pivot  tables for this, one called amenity_room and another called accommodation_ amenity. Another great way to do this is to combine the two into one table and use a  field to distinguish between the two types or relationship. To do this, we will need a field to distinguish between amenity and room and amenity  and room, something we could call a relationship type. Laravel's Eloquent skillfully  handles this automatically.  Eloquent uses the suffix -able to make this happen. In our example, we would  create a table that has the following fields:     id    name    description    amenitiable_id    amenitiable_type  The first three fields are familiar, but two new fields added. One of them will contain  the ID of either the accommodation or the room.  [ 157 ]   The Amenity table structure For example, given a room with ID 5, amenitiable_id will be 5 while  amenitiable_type will be Room. Given an accommodation with ID 5,   amenitiable_id will be 5 while amenitiable_type will be Accommodation:  id  name  description  amenitiable_id  amenitiable_type  2  1 Wireless  internet Covered  parking Sea view  3  Internet conn.  Parking in garage  Ocean view from  room  5  5  5  Room  Room  Accommodation  The Amenity model In terms of code, the Amenity model will now contain an "amenitiable" function:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Accommodation;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class Amenity extends Model {     public function rooms  {         return $this->belongsToMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Room' ;     }     public function amenitiable       {         return $this->morphTo  ;     }  The Accommodation model The Accommodation model will change the amenities method to use morphMany  instead of hasMany:  <?php namespace MyCompany;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  [ 158 ]   class Accommodation extends Model {     public function rooms  {         return $this->hasMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Room' ;     }      public function amenities       {         return $this-           >morphMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Amenity',           'amenitiable' ;     } }  The Room model The Room model will contain the same morphMany method:  <?php namespace MyCompany\Accommodation;  use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;  class Room extends Model {     protected $casts = ['room_number'=>'integer'];     public function accommodation  {         return $this->belongsTo '\MyCompany\Accommodation' ;     }     public function amenities   {         return $this-           >morphMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation\Amenity',           'amenitiable' ;     }  }  Now, when the amenities are requested for a room or an accommodation,   Eloquent will automatically distinguish between them:  $accommodation->amenities  ; $room->amenities  ;  Each of these functions returns the correct type of amenity for room and for  accommodation.  [ 159 ]   Many-to-many polymorphic relations It is possible, though, that some amenities could be shared between a room and   an accommodation. In this case, a many-to-many polymorphic relation is used.   The pivot table now adds several fields:  amenity_id 1 1 2 2  amenitiable_id 5 5 5 5  amenitiable_type Room Accommodation Room Accommodation  As illustrated, both the room with ID 5 and the accommodation with ID 5 have  amenities with IDs 1 and 2.  Has relationships If we would like to select all of the accommodations that are associated to a franchise,  the has   method is used, where the relation is passed as the parameter:  MyCompany\Accommodation::has 'franchise' ->get  ;  We will get the following JSON array:  [{"id":9,"name":"LovelyHotel","description":"Lovely Hotel Greater     Pittsburgh","location_id":1,"created_at":null,"updated_at":     "2015-03-13 22:00:23","deleted_at":null,"franchise_id":1},     {"id":12,"name": "Grand Hotel","description":"Grand Hotel     Greater Cleveland","location_id":2,"created_at":     "2015-02-0820:09:35","updated_at":     "2015-02-0820:09:35","deleted_at":null,"franchise_id":1}]  Notice that the franchise_id value is 1, which means the accommodations have  a franchise associated with them. Optionally, a where may be added to the has  creating a whereHas function. The code is as follows:  MyCompany\Accommodation::whereHas 'franchise',                   function $query {       $query->where 'description','like','%Pittsburgh%' ;        } ->get  ;  [ 160 ]   Notice that whereHas takes a closure as its second parameter.  This would return only the accommodations where the description contains  Pittsburgh, so the returned array would contain only results like this:  [{"id":9,"name":"LovelyHotel","description":"Lovely Hotel Greater     Pittsburgh","location_id":1,"created_at":null,"updated_at":     "2015-03-13 22:00:23","deleted_at":null,"franchise_id":1}]  Eager loading Another great mechanism that Eloquent provides is eager loading. If we want return  all of the franchises together with all of their accommodations, we simply need to  add an accommodations function to our Franchise model as follows:      public function accommodations       {         return $this->hasMany '\MyCompany\Accommodation' ;     }  Then, by adding a with clause to the statement, the accommodations are returned for  each franchise:  MyCompany\Franchise::with 'accommodations' ->get  ;  We can also list the rooms associated with each accommodation as follows:  MyCompany\Franchise::with 'accommodations','rooms' ->get  ;  If we want to return the rooms nested inside of the accommodation array, then the  following syntax should be used:  MyCompany\Franchise::with 'accommodations','accommodations.rooms'      ->get  ;  We will get the following output:  [{"id":1,"accommodations": [ {"id":9, "name":"Lovely Hotel", "description":"Lovely Hotel Greater Pittsburgh", "location_id":1, "created_at":null, "updated_at":"2015-03-13 22:00:23", "deleted_at":null,  [ 161 ]   "franchise_id":1, "rooms":[{"id":1,"room_number":0,"created_at":null,"updated_at":     null,"deleted_at":null,"accommodation_id":9}, ]}, {"id":12,"name":"GrandHotel","description":"Grand Hotel Greater     Cleveland","location_id":2,"created_at":"2015-02-08…  In this example, rooms is contained within accommodation.  Conclusion Laravel's ORM is powerful. In fact, there are too many types of operations to  list within a single book. The simplest queries can be accomplished with a few  keystrokes.  Laravel's Eloquent command gets converted into fluent commands, so if something  more complicated is desired, then the fluent syntax may be used. If a very  complicated query needs to be performed, then the DB::raw   function can even  be used. This will allow exact strings to be used inside the query builder. Here is an  example:  $users = DB::table 'accommodation'                       ->select DB::raw 'count *  as                        number_of_hotels'  ->get  ;  This returns just the number of hotels:  [{"number_of_hotels":15}]  Learning to design the software, starting with the domain and then thinking about  which entities are involved in that domain, will help a developer think in an object- oriented manner. Having a list of entities leads to the creation of the table, so the  actual creation of the schema will be performed last. This approach may take  some getting used to. Understanding Eloquent relationships is key to being able to  produce expressive, readable statements that query the database while hiding away  the complexity.  Another reason why Eloquent is extremely useful is in the case of a legacy database.  If the ORM is applied in a situation where the tables have nonstandard names,  the keys are not named by the same name, or the column names are simply not  easily understandable, Eloquent provides the developer with tools to actually help  homogenize the table names and field names, and perform the relations by providing  attribute getters and setters.  [ 162 ]   For example, if the field names are fname1 and fname2, we can use a get attribute  function inside our model, where the syntax is get followed by the desired name to  use in the application and the attribute. So, in the case of fname1, the function would  be added as follows:  public function getUsernameAttribute $value  {   return $this->attributes['fname1']; }  Functions such as these are Eloquent's real selling point. In this chapter, you  learned how to find data inside your database by using entity models, limiting the  results through the addition of where, relationships, powerful conventions such as  polymorphic relationships, and auxiliary helpers such as pagination.  Summary In this chapter, the Eloquent ORM was demonstrated in detail. Eloquent is an   object-oriented wrapper to what actually happens between the database and the  code. Since the Fluent query builder is easily accessible, it is important to be familiar  with how the queries are written. This will help in debugging and also cover  complex cases where Eloquent is not adequate. In this chapter, most of the concepts  of Eloquent have been discussed. However, there are many more methods available,  so further reading is encouraged.  In the next chapter, among other topics, you will learn how to scale the database to  perform better on a larger scale.  [ 163 ]    Scaling Laravel  A characteristic of frameworks built in any programming language is the use of  various components. As we saw in the previous chapters, frameworks provide a  software developer with many different prebuilt tools to accomplish tasks such as  authentication, database interaction, and RESTful API creation.  However, regarding frameworks, scalability issues are always the worst fears of  any manager in the information technology field. As with any library that uses  existing code, there will be always some amount of overhead, some amount of bloat,  something more than is actually needed.  Scalability issues There are many reasons why a framework could not easily scale. Let's look at a   short list of issues:     One issue is unnecessary code and packages that are not directly related to   the actual application being built. Not every project needs authentication, for  example, a database drivers per MySQL. Packages that are part of the core of  the framework must be monitored for compatibility issues.     Design patterns, opinions, and learning curves often prevent new team   members from getting familiar quickly. As the project expands, the day-to- day development needs to grow, and a software development group must  continually recruit members who are either already somewhat familiar with  a framework or at least understand its basic concepts.  [ 165 ]      Framework security issues require continual monitoring of the framework   community's website or repository to gather information regarding  emergency security updates that are required. Even the underlying web  server and operating system itself need to be monitored. At the time of  writing, Laravel 5.1 is nearing its release and it will require PHP 5.5, since  PHP 5.4 will be declared end-of-life later in 2015.     ORMs such as Eloquent always add a slight amount of overhead, since the  code needs to be converted first from Eloquent into the fluent query builder  and then into PDO code. Obviously, using an object-oriented approach to  query the database is a wise choice, but it has a cost.  Towards the enterprise Despite possible roadblocks, Laravel will continue to be a strong option in the  future of enterprise. PHP 7 is going to be very fast, and frameworks such as Zend  Framework 3 have already announced PHP 7 optimization in their road map. Also,  by using the FastCGI Process Manager  FPM , NGINX web server, and allowing  PHP's caching mechanisms to work properly, application scalability will continue to  become more accepted in the enterprise space as its renaissance continues and new  developers contribute to its core.  In this chapter, you will learn how to allow Laravel to perform better in the  enterprise setting where scalability issues are paramount. First, router caching  will be discussed. Then, you will learn about the many tools, techniques, and even  new microframeworks that are being developed with scalability at the forefront.  Specifically, we will discuss an official microframework derived from Laravel,  Lumen. Finally, you will learn how to use the database efficiently through a  technique called read and write.  In terms of the size of the code base, Laravel has one of the smallest code bases as  compared to Zend or Symfony, although it does use some Symfony components. As  mentioned in previous chapters, different packages were removed to lighten up the  footprint, taking cues from Symfony's component-based ideology. For example, the  HTML, SSH, and annotations packages are no longer included by default.  [ 166 ]   Route caching Route caching helps to speed things up. In Laravel 5, a caching mechanism was  introduced to speed up the execution.  The example routes.php is shown here:  Route::post 'reserve-room', 'ReservationController@store' ;  Route::controllers [   'auth' => 'Auth\AuthController',   'password' => 'Auth\PasswordController', ] ; Route::post ' bookRoom','ReservationsController@reserve',     ['middleware' => 'auth', 'domain'=>'booking.hotelwebsite.com'] ;  Route::resource 'rooms', 'RoomsController' ;  Route::group ['middleware' => ['auth','whitelist']], function   {    Route::resource 'accommodations', 'AccommodationsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.amenities',     'AccommodationsAmenitiesController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.rooms',     'AccommodationsRoomsController' ;   Route::resource 'accommodations.locations',     'AccommodationsLocationsController' ;   Route::resource 'amenities', 'AmenitiesController' ;   Route::resource 'locations', 'LocationsController' ; } ;  By running the following command, Laravel will cache the routes:  $ php artisan route:cache  Then, place them into the following directory:   vendor routes.php  [ 167 ]   Here is a small portion of the resultant file:  <?php   *   Load The Cached Routes -------------------------------------------------------------------- ------   Here we will decode and unserialize the RouteCollection instance     that  holds all of the route information for an application. This     allows  us to instantaneously load the entire route map into the router.  *   app 'router' ->setRoutes    unserialize base64_decode 'TzozNDoiSWxsdW1pbmF0ZVxSb3V0aW5nXF     JvdXRlQ29sbGVjdGlvbiI6NDp7czo5OiIAKgByb3V0ZXMiO2E6Njp7czozOiJH     RVQiO2E6NTA6e3M6MToiLyI7TzoyNDoiSWxsdW1pbmF0ZVxSb3V0aW5nXFJvdX     RlIjo3OntzOjY6IgAqAHVyaSI7czoxOiIvIjtzOjEwOiIAKgBtZXRob2RzIjth     OjI6e2k6MDtzOjM6IkdFVCI7aToxO3M6NDoiSEVBRCI7fX ... Db250cm9sbGVyc1xBbWVuaXRpZXNDb250cm9sbGVyQHVwZGF0ZSI7cjoxNDQx     O3M6NTQ6Ik15Q29tcGFueVxIyb2xsZXJzXEhvdGVsQ29udHJvbGxlckBkZXN0c     m95IjtyOjE2MzI7fX0='    ;  As the DocBlock states, the routes are encoded in base64 and then serialized:  unserialize base64_decode  …   ;  This performs some precompilation. If we base64 decode the contents of the file, we  obtain the serialized data. The following code is an extract of the file:  O:34:"Illuminate\Routing\RouteCollection":4:{s:9:"*routes";     a:6:{s:3:"GET";a:50:{s:1:" ";O:24:"Illuminate\Routing\Route":     7:{s:6:"*uri";s:1:" ";s:10:"*methods";a:2:{i:0;s:3:"GET";i:1;     s:4:"HEAD";}s:9:"*action";a:5:{s:4:"uses";s:50:"MyCompany     \Http\Controllers\WelcomeController@index";s:10:"controller";     s:50:"MyCompany\Http\Controllers\WelcomeController@index";     s:9:"namespace";s:26:"MyCompany\Http\Controllers";s:6:"prefix";     N;s:5:"where";a:0:{}}s:11:"*defaults";a:0:{}s:9:"*wheres";     a:0:{}s:13:"*parameters";N;s:17:"*parameterNames";N;     }s:4:"home";O:24:"Illumin…  "MyCompany\Http\Controllers\HotelController@destroy";r:1632;}}  [ 168 ]   If the  vendor routes.php file exists, it is used instead of the routes.php file that is  located at  app Http routes.php. If at some point using the route caching file is no  longer desired, use the following artisan command:  $ php artisan route:clear  This command will delete the cached routes file and Laravel will begin using the    app Http routes.php file again.  It is important to note that if there are any closures used in the  routes.php file, then caching will fail. Here is an example of a  closure in a route:  Route::get 'room {$id}', function  {   return Room::find $id ; } ;  It is inadvisable to use closure in the routes.php file for any  reason. To be able to use route caching, relocate the code used  within the closure into a controller.  Illuminate routing All of this work speeds up an important part of the request life cycle, the routing.   In Laravel, the routing class is located inside the illuminate routing namespace:  <?php namespace Illuminate\Routing; use Closure; use LogicException; use ReflectionFunction; use Illuminate\Http\Request; use Illuminate\Container\Container; use Illuminate\Routing\Matching\UriValidator; use Illuminate\Routing\Matching\HostValidator; use Illuminate\Routing\Matching\MethodValidator; use Illuminate\Routing\Matching\SchemeValidator; use Symfony\Component\Routing\Route as SymfonyRoute; use Illuminate\Http\Exception\HttpResponseException; use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException;   Examining the use operators, it is clear that the routing mechanism consists of quite  a few classes. The most important line is as follows:  use Symfony\Component\Routing\Route as SymfonyRoute;  [ 169 ]   Laravel uses Symfony's routing class. However, a new routing package written by  Nikita Popov has emerged. FastRoute is a fast request router that is faster than other  routing packages and addresses some of the issues of the existing routing packages.  This component is one of the major advantages of the of the Lumen microframework.  Lumen In soda marketing terms, Lumen could be considered Laravel Light or Laravel Zero.  In addition to using the FastRoute routing package, many packages have been  removed from Lumen, allowing it to be minimal and reduce its footprint.  Comparison between Laravel and Lumen The packages in Laravel and Lumen were compared and listed in the following table.  These packages are installed when the following command is run:  $ composer update –-no-dev  The preceding command is used when the development is completed and the  application is ready for deployment on the server. Tools such as PHPUnit and  PHPSpec are obviously excluded at this stage.   The package names are aligned to illustrate where the packages are present in both  Laravel and Lumen:  Laravel Packages - illuminate cache illuminate config illuminate console illuminate container illuminate contracts illuminate cookie illuminate database illuminate encryption illuminate events illuminate exception illuminate filesystem  Lumen Packages nikic fast-route - illuminate config illuminate console illuminate container illuminate contracts illuminate cookie illuminate database  illuminate encryption illuminate events - illuminate filesystem  [ 170 ]   Laravel Packages illuminate foundation illuminate hashing illuminate http illuminate log illuminate mail illuminate pagination illuminate pipeline illuminate queue illuminate redis illuminate routing illuminate session illuminate support illuminate translation illuminate validation illuminate view jeremeamia superclosure league flysystem monolog monolog mtdowling cron-expression  nesbot carbon psy psysh swiftmailer swiftmailer symfony console symfony css-selector symfony debug symfony dom-crawler symfony finder symfony http-foundation symfony http-kernel symfony process symfony routing symfony security-core symfony var-dumper  Lumen Packages - illuminate hashing illuminate http - - illuminate pagination - illuminate queue - - illuminate session illuminate support illuminate translation illuminate validation illuminate view - - monolog monolog mtdowling cron-expression - - - - - - - - symfony http-foundation symfony http-kernel - - symfony security-core symfony var-dumper  [ 171 ]   Laravel Packages vlucas phpdotenv classpreloader classpreloader danielstjules stringy doctrine inflector ext-mbstring ext-mcrypt  Lumen Packages - - - - - -  At the time of writing, there are 51 packages  shown in the left column  that are  installed in Laravel 5.0 using the nondevelopment configuration. Compare this  number of packages to the number of packages installed in Lumen  shown in the  right column —there are just 24.  The aforementioned nikic fast-route package is the only package that Lumen  has which Laravel does not. The symfony routing package is the complimentary  package found in Laravel.  Lean application development We will use an example, a simple public-facing RESTful API. This RESTful API  displays the names and addresses of a list of accommodations in JSON format to   any user via GET:                            If no passwords are to be used, then ext mcrypt is not needed. If no date calculations are to performed, then nesbot carbon is not needed.  Since there is no HTML interface, then the following libraries involved in  testing the HTML of an application, symfony css-selector and   symfony dom-crawler, will not be needed. If no e-mail is to be sent to the user, then neither illuminate mail nor  swiftmailer swiftmailer is needed. If no special interaction with the filesystem is needed, then there is no need  for league flysystem. If not commands that are to run from the command line, then the   symfony console is not needed. If Redis is not needed, then illuminate redis may be left out. If specific configuration values will not be needed for different environments,  then vlucas phpdotenv is not needed.  [ 172 ]   The vlucas phpdotenv package is a suggested package in the  composer.json file.  It is clear that the decision to remove certain packages has been done carefully so as  to lighten up Lumen as needed with the simplest of applications in mind.  Read write Laravel has another great mechanism for helping its performance in the enterprise:  read and write. This is related to database performance, but the functionality is so  easy to set up that any application can take advantage of its usefulness.  Regarding MySQL, the original MyISAM database engine required a lock on the  entire table during inserts, updates, and deletes. This caused massive bottlenecks  during large operations that modified the data and select queries waited to access  these tables. With the introduction of InnoDB, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE SQL  statements required a lock only at the row-level. This tremendously impacted  performance, since selects could read from various parts of a table where other  operations were taking place.  MariaDB, a MySQL fork, claims faster performance than the traditional MySQL.  Replacing the database engine with TokuDB will give even higher performance,  especially in a big data setting.  Another mechanism to speed up performance of the database is the use of a   master slave configuration. In the following diagram, all of the operations are  performed on a single table. The inserts and updates will lock down single rows   and the select statements will be performed as allocated.  Traditional database table actions  [ 173 ]   Master table The master slave configuration uses a master table that allows SELECT, UPDATE,  and DELETE statements. These statements modify the table or write to it. There may  also be multiple master tables. Each master table is kept continually synchronized:  changes made to any table needs to be communicated to the master table.  Slave table The slave table is a slave to the master. It depends on the master table for its changes.  SQL clients can only perform read operations  SELECT  from it. There may also be  multiple slaves that depend on one or more multiple master tables. The master table  communicates all of its changes to all the slaves. The following diagram shows the  basic architecture of a master slave setup:  Master and slave  read write setup   This continual synchronization adds slight overhead to the database structure;  however, it presents important advantages:  [ 174 ]   Since only SELECT statements can be performed on the slave table while INSERT,  UPDATE, and DELETE statements can be performed on the master table, the slave table  is free to accept many SELECT statements freely, without having to "wait" for any  operations involving the same rows to finish.  An example of this would be a currency exchange rate or stock price table. This  table would be continually updated in real time with the latest values, possibly even  many times per second. Obviously, a website that allows many users to access this  information could potentially have thousands of visitors. Also, the web page used to  display this data may make continual multiple requests per user.  Performing many SELECT statements would be slightly slower when there are  UPDATE statements that need to access the same data at the same time.  By using a master slave configuration, the SELECT statements would be performed  only on the slave table. This table receives only the data that has changed in an  extremely optimized way.  In plain PHP using a library such as mysqli, there could be two database  connections configured:  $master=mysqli_connect '127.0.0.1:3306','dbuser','dbpassword','mydata base' ; $slave=mysqli_connect '127.0.0.1:3307','dbuser','dbpassword','mydatab ase' ;  In this simplified example, the slave is set up on the same server machine. In a  real application, it would most likely be set up on another server machine to take  advantage of separate hardware. Then, all of the SQL statements which involve a write statement would be performed  on the slave and read would be performed on the master.  This would add some overhead to the programming efforts, as a different connection  would need to be passed into each SQL statement:  $result= mysqli_real_query $master,"UPDATE exchanges set rate='1.345'  where exchange_id=2" ; $result= mysqli_query $slave,"SELECT rate from exchanges where  exchange_id=2" ;  In the preceding code example, it would be prudent to remember which SQL  statements should be used for the master and which SQL statements should be   used for the slave.  [ 175 ]   Configuring read write As stated before, code written in Eloquent is converted into fluent query-builder  code. This code is then converted to PDO, which is a standard wrapper around the  various database drivers.  Laravel provides the ability to manage master slave configurations though its   read write configuration. This allows programmers to write Eloquent and fluent  query-builder code without having to worry about whether the queries will be  executed on the master or slave table. Also, a software project that starts out with a  non-master slave configuration and later needs to scale up to a master slave setup  will only need to change one aspect of the database configuration. The database  configuration file is located at config database.php.  As an element of the connections array, an entry with the key mysql will be created  with the following configuration:  'connections' => 'mysql' => [     'read' => [         'host' => '192.168.1.1',       'password'  => 'slave-Passw0rd',      ],     'write' => [         'host' => '196.168.1.2',      'username'  => 'dbhostusername'         ],     'driver'    => 'mysql',     'database'  => 'database',     'username'  => 'dbusername',     'password'  => 's0methingSecure',     'charset'   => 'utf8',     'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',     'prefix'    => '', ],  The read and write represent slave and master respectively. Since the parameters  cascade, if the username, password, and database name are the same, then only  the IP address of the host name needs to be listed. However, any values can be  overridden. In this example, the read has a password that is different from that   of the master and the write has a username that is different from the slave.  [ 176 ]   Creating a master slave database  configuration To set up a master slave database, perform the following steps from the   command line.  1.  The first step is to determine which address the MySQL server is bound to.  To do this, locate the line of the MySQL configuration file that contains the  bind-address parameter: bind-address            = 127.0.0.1  This IP address will be set to whichever IP address the master server uses.  2.  Next, uncomment the line of the MySQL configuration file that contains the  server-id, which is most probably located at  etc my.cn or  etc mysql  mysql.conf.d mysqld.cnf.  3.  The Unix sed command can perform this easily:  $ sed -i s server-id server-id g   etc mysql my.cnf  The  etc mysql my.cnf string will need to be substituted  with the correct filename.  4.  Uncomment the line of the MySQL configuration file that contains the   server-id: $ sed -i s log_bin log_bin g   etc mysql my.cnf  Again, the  etc mysql my.cnf string will need to be  substituted with the correct filename.  5.  Now, MySQL needs to be restarted. You can do this using the following   command: $ sudo service mysql restart  6.  The following placeholders should be substituted with the actual values:  MYSQLUSER  MYSQLPASSWORD  MASTERDATABASE  [ 177 ]   MASTERDATABASEUSER  MASTERDATABASEPASSWORD  SLAVEDATABASE  SLAVEDATABASEUSER  SLAVEDATABASEPASSWORD  Master server set up The following are the steps for setting up a master server:  1.  Grant permission to the slave database user:  $ echo  "GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'DATABASEUSER'@'%'  IDENTIFIED BY 'DATABASESLAVEPASSWORD';"  mysql -u MYSQLUSER  -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"   2.  Next, the permissions must be flushed using the following command:  $ echo  "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"  mysql -u MYSQLUSER -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"   3.  Next, switch to the master database using the following command:  $ echo  "USE MASTERDATABASE;"  mysql -u MYSQLUSER  -p"DATABASEPASSWORD"   4.  Next, flush the tables using the following command:  $ echo  "FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;"  mysql -u MYSQLUSER  -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"   5.  Display the master database status using the following command:  $ echo  "SHOW MASTER STATUS;"  mysql -u MYSQLUSER  -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"   Take note of the position and filename from the output:  POSITION FILENAME  6.  Dump the master database using the following command:  $ mysqldump -u root -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"  --opt "MASTERDATABASE" >  dumpfile.sql  7.  Unlock the tables using the following command:  $ echo  "UNLOCK TABLES;"  mysql -u MYSQLUSER -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"   [ 178 ]   Slave server set up The following are the steps for setting up a slave server:  1.  On the slave server, create the slave database using the following command:  $ echo  "CREATE DATABASE SLAVEDATABASE;"  mysql -u MYSQLUSER  -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"   2.   Import the dump file created from the master database using the   following command: $ mysql -u MYSQLUSER -p"MYSQLPASSWORD"  "MASTERDATABASE" <  dumpfile.sql  3.  Now, the MySQL configuration file uses server-id 2:  server-id            = 2  4.   In the MySQL configuration file, two lines should be uncommented,   as follows: log_bin   =  var log mysql mysql-bin.log        expire_logs_days   = 10  max_binlog_size   = 100M  binlog_do_db    = include_database_name  5.  You will get the following result:     log_bin  expire_logs_days  max_binlog_size    = 100M binlog_do_db       = 10  = include_database_name  =  var log mysql mysql-bin.log  6.  Additionally, the following line needs to be added below binglog_do_db:  relay-log                =  var log mysql mysql-relay-bin.log  7.  Now, MySQL needs to be restarted using the following command:  $ sudo service mysql restart  8.  Finally, the master password is set. The master log file and positions    are to be set to the filename and the position recorded in step 5. Run the  following command:  MASTER_PASSWORD='password', MASTER_LOG_FILE='FILENAME', MASTER_ LOG_POS= POSITION;  [ 179 ]   Summary In this chapter, you learned how to speed up the routing through route caching.  You also learned how to replace Laravel entirely with Lumen, the microframework  entirely derived from Laravel. Finally, we discussed how Laravel can use a read and  write configuration to take full advantage of a master and slave configuration.  Symfony 2.7 was released in May, 2015. It is a long-term support version. This  version will be supported for 36 months. Shortly after that, Taylor Otwell made the  decision to create the first LTS version of Laravel. This is the first sign that Laravel is  firmly positioned in the enterprise space. There is no formal company behind Laravel  yet, as there is in the case of Symfony and Zend. Yet there is a large ecosystem of  community packages and services such as Laracasts, run by Jeffrey Way who works  very closely with Taylor to provide official training videos.  Also, Taylor Otwell runs a service called Envoyer that removes any and all of the  initial barriers to Laravel deployment and provides zero downtime deployment for  Laravel as well as other types of modern PHP projects.  With the arrival of Laravel 5.1 LTS, many new and exciting things will be   happening for Laravel. The decision to use many community packages allows   Taylor and his community to focus on the most important aspects of the framework  without having to reinvent the wheel and maintain many redundant packages.  Also, Laravel Collective maintained the packages that have been deprecated—even  packages that are eventually removed from Laravel will continue to be supported for  many years to come.  In addition to convenient services, such as Envoyer, the next chapter will present a  great automation tool that has recently emerged: Elixir.  [ 180 ]   Building, Compiling, and  Testing with Elixir  In this chapter, the following topics will be covered:  Installing Node.js, Gulp, and Elixir        Running Elixir    Combining CSS and JavaScript files using Elixir    Setting up notifications    Running tests with Elixir    Extending Elixir  Automating Laravel Throughout the book, many parts of an example application have been built.   We discussed the steps involved in creating an application. However, there is   more information available about tools to help with scaffolding, boilerplate  templates, and building up a RESTful API for a CRUD application. Until recently,  not much was written about automating some parts of the development process   and deployment process.  A newer area that has emerged in the last few years in the PHP field is the concept  of continuous integration and build tools. The popularity of continuous integration  and continuous delivery enables teams of developers to constantly release many  small improvements to their application many times a day. In this chapter, you will  learn how Laravel has a new toolset to empower teams to rapidly and effortlessly  deploy versions of their software and build, and combine many of the software's  components automatically.  [ 181 ]   Continuous integration and continuous delivery has caused quite an evolution in  the development process, which has drastically changed the way in which software  is built. It was not too long ago, however, when the standard deployment process  involved simply placing the code on the server. A majority of the early adopters  of PHP were simply web designers with a need to add functionality such as a  forum or contact us form. Since most of them were not programmers, most of the  practices used in web design and graphic design in general made their way into PHP  deployment as well. These practices often involved using an application such as  FileZilla to drag-and-drop files from the left-hand side panel  the user's computer  to  the right  the server's directories . For the more experienced, performing what was  then cryptic UNIX commands using a terminal emulator such as PuTTY.  The insecure file transfer port 21 was used, and everything was sent uncompressed  and simply copied to the server. Usually, all of the files were overwritten and often  the deployment took almost an hour for a large site with many images and files.  Eventually, source code control systems became pervasive. In the most recent years,  SVN and Git have become the industry standard for most software projects. These  tools allowed for deployment directly from a code repository.  Most recently, the arrival of composer has created an easy way to simply include  entire software packages to add functionality to software applications. The ease   with which a developer simply needs to add a single line to the configuration   file is exhilarating!  Automating both the development and deployment processes may involve many  steps, some of which are listed next.  Deployment Here are some of the functions of the deployment process:     Copying certain configuration settings that are relevant to the    production environment     Processing or compiling any cascading style sheets  CSS  or JavaScript    files that were written using a shortcut syntax or preprocessor     Copying the various assets  source code or images  to mirrors, cluster   servers, or content delivery networks     Modifying the read write execute permissions and or ownership of certain   files or directories  [ 182 ]      Combining several files into one to reduce the overhead required to perform      Reducing useless white space and comments  minifying and or uglifying     multiple HTTP calls  in files to reduce their size     Comparing existing files on the server with the files from our local   environment to determine whether or not to overwrite them     Tagging and or versioning the source code to allow for possible    code rollbacks  Development or deployment Here are some of the functions of the development or deployment process:     Verifying that code passed all of the unit, functional, and acceptance tests   written to guarantee its quality     Running scripts that perform various operations    Performing any migrations, seeding, or other modifications to the       Obtaining source code control from a hosted source code control system    database tables  such as GitHub  It is clear that modern development is very complex. An even more difficult aspect of  software development is continually recreating the production or final environment  while developing.  Towards automation Tools such as file watchers can run scripts or perform operations every time a file  is modified. Additionally, IDEs such as PHPStorm will recognize file extensions  and offer to watch the file for changes and allow the developer to perform certain  operations. While this approach is acceptable, it is not very portable and each  developer would have to create and share a configuration file with the various  watchers within the IDE or text editor. This creates a dependency, relying on one  single IDE for the entire team.  Also, other approaches such as Bash-shell scripts could be created that run at certain  intervals. However, using these scripts requires UNIX-shell coding knowledge. As  has been previously demonstrated, tools like artisan help automate many manual  tasks. However, most of the default artisan commands were and are still designed to  be executed manually.  [ 183 ]   Luckily, two tools that use the Node.js JavaScript platform have emerged: Grunt  and gulp. Both Grunt and gulp have had a considerable amount of success, but gulp  has recently become more popular. However, learning to quickly write tasks using  gulp is not very easy, especially for a PHP developer who may not be familiar with  JavaScript syntax.  Consider the following example code taken from the documentation of gulp:  gulp.task 'scripts', ['clean'], function   {      Minify and copy all JavaScript  except vendor scripts       with sourcemaps all the way down   return gulp.src paths.scripts      .pipe sourcemaps.init          .pipe coffee          .pipe uglify          .pipe concat 'all.min.js'       .pipe sourcemaps.write        .pipe gulp.dest 'build js'  ; } ;  From Gulp to Elixir Luckily, the Laravel community is always forward thinking and focuses on   reducing complexity. An official community tool named Elixir has emerged to  facilitate the use of gulp. Gulp is built on top of Node.js, and Elixir is built on   top of gulp, creating a wrapper:  Laravel Elixir is not to be confused with the dynamic, functional  language with the same name. The other Elixir uses the Erlang  virtual machine, while Laravel Elixir uses gulp and Node.js  [ 184 ]   Getting started The first step is to install Node.js if it is not already installed on the development  computer.  Instructions can be found at the following URL: https:  nodejs.org  Installing Node.js With a Debian-based operative system such as Ubuntu, installing Node.js could   be as simple as using the apt package manager. From the command line, use the  following command:  $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs  Please refer to the installation instructions for the correct operating system from the  Node.js website  https:  nodejs.org .  Installing the Node.js package manager The next step involves installing gulp, which Elixir will use to run its tasks. For this  step, the Node.js package manager  npm  is required. If npm is not already installed,  then the apt package installer is to be use. The following command will be used to  install npm:  $ sudo apt-get install npm  The npm uses a json file to manage the project's dependencies: package.json. This  file is found in the root of the Laravel project directory and has the following format:  {   "devDependencies": {     "gulp": "^3.8.8",     "laravel-elixir": "*"   } }  Gulp and Laravel Elixir are installed as dependencies.  [ 185 ]   Installing Gulp The following command is used to install gulp:  $ sud onpm install --global gulp  Installing Elixir Once Node.js, npm, and gulp are installed, the next step is to install Laravel Elixir.   By running npm install without any arguments, npm will read its configuration file  and Laravel Elixir will be installed:  $ npm install  Running Elixir By default, Laravel contains a gulpfile.js file that is used by gulp to run its tasks.  The file contains a require method that includes everything needed for the tasks   to run:  var elixir = require 'laravel-elixir' ;   *  ----------------------------------------------------------------   Elixir Asset Management  ----------------------------------------------------------------     Elixir provides a clean, fluent API for defining some basic     gulp tasks   for your Laravel application. By default, we are compiling the     Sass   file for our application, as well as publishing vendor     resources.    *   elixir function mix  {     mix.less 'app.less' ; } ;  [ 186 ]   The first mix is shown as an example: app.less. To run gulp, simply type gulp at  the command line as follows:  $  gulp  The output is shown here:  [21:23:38] Using gulpfile  var www laravel.example gulpfile.js  [21:23:38] Starting 'default'...  [21:23:38] Starting 'less'...  [21:23:38] Running Less: resources assets less app.less  [21:23:41] Finished 'default' after 2.35 s  [21:23:43] gulp-notify: [Laravel Elixir] Less Compiled!  [21:23:43] Finished 'less' after 4.27 s  The first line indicates that the gulp file was loaded. The following lines show each  task running. The less job deals with the cascading style sheet preprocessor Less.  Setting up notifications If your development environment is a Vagrant Box, installing vagrant-notify will  allow Laravel Elixir to interact directly with the host and display native messages  directly in the operating system. To install it, the following command should be run  from the host operating system:  $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-notify  Here's the screenshot of a notification showing that PHPUnit tests have failed:  [ 187 ]   The installation instructions depend on each operating system.  For more information, visit https:  github.com fgrehm  vagrant-notify.  Combining CSS and JavaScript files with  Elixir Possibly, the single most important step of the deployment process is to combine  and minify CSS and JavaScript files. Minifying and combining five JavaScript files  and three CSS files means that instead of eight HTTP requests, there will be only one.  Also, by minifying the files by removing white space, line breaks, comments, and  other techniques, such as shortening variable names, the file size will be reduced to a  fraction of its original size. Despite the advantage, there are still many websites that  continue to use unminified and uncombined CSS and JavaScript files.  Elixir provides a simple means to easily combine and minify files. The following  code illustrates this example:  elixir function mix  {     mix.scripts  .styles  ; } ;  The two methods, scripts   and styles  , will combine all of the JavaScript and  CSS files into single files, all.js and all.css, respectively. By default, the two  functions expect the files to be located at  resources assets js and  resources  assets css.  When the gulp command has finished, the output will be like this:  [00:36:20] Using gulpfile  var www laravel.example gulpfile.js  [00:36:20] Starting 'default'...  [00:36:20] Starting 'scripts'...  [00:36:20] Merging: resources assets js ** *.js  [00:36:20] Finished 'default' after 246 ms  [00:36:20] Finished 'scripts' after 280 ms  [00:36:20] Starting 'styles'...  [00:36:20] Merging: resources assets css ** *.css  [00:36:21] Finished 'styles' after 191 ms  [ 188 ]   Notice how the output conveniently states which directories were scanned.   The contents are combined, referred to as merged in this context, but not minified.  This is because, during development, debugging is too difficult on minified files. If  only a certain file is to be merged, then the name of the file may be passed into the  function as the first parameter:  mix.scripts 'app.js' ;  If multiple files are to be merged, then an array of filenames may be passed into the  function as a first parameter:  mix.scripts ['app.js','lib.js'] ;  In a production environment, having minified files is desirable. To have Elixir minify  both the CSS and JavaScript, add the --production option to the gulp command   as follows:  This will produce the desired minified output. The default output directory is  located at:  $ gulp --production   public js  public css  Compiling with Laravel Elixir Laravel Elixir is great at performing routine tasks that would otherwise require  learning scripting languages. The following sections will demonstrate each of the  various types of compiling that Elixir can perform.  Compiling Sass and Less Cascading style sheet preprocessors Less and Sass emerged from the need to  enhance the capabilities of CSS. It does not contain any variables for example. Less  and Sass allow frontend developers take advantage of variables and other features  that are syntactically familiar. The following code is an example of standard CSS.  The DOM elements p and li  paragraph and list item respectively , and any element  with a post class will have a font-family Arial, with sans-serif as a fallback and  black as its color:  p, li, .post {   font-family: Arial, sans-serif;   color: 000; }  [ 189 ]   Next, using the Sass CSS pre-processor, both the font-family and text color will be  substituted with two variables: $text-font and $text-color. This allows easy  maintenance when changes are needed. Also, the variables may be shared. The code  is as follows:  The Less preprocessor uses @ instead of $; therefore, its syntax looks more like an  annotation than a php variable:  $text-font:    Arial, sans-serif; $text-color: 000;  p, li, .post {   font: 100% $text-font;   color: $text-color; } h2 {   font: 2em $text-font;   color: $text-color; }  @text-font:    Arial, sans-serif; @text-color: 000;  p, li, .post {   font: 100% @text-font;   color: @text-color; } h2 {   font: 2em @text-font;   color: @text-color; }  There is an extra step that needs to be performed, since it will not be interpreted   by a browser engine. The added step is to compile the Less or Sass code into real  CSS. This introduces extra time in the development phase; thus, Elixir helps by  automating the process.  In the previous Laravel Elixir example, the less function took only the filename,  app.less, as its sole argument. Now, the example should be a bit clearer. Also, less  may take an array of arguments that will be compiled.   [ 190 ]   The less method searches in  resources assets less and the output will be  placed in public css  by default:  Compiling CoffeeScript CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles into JavaScript. Like Less and  Sass, its goal is to simplify or extend the functionality of the language that it compiles  to. In the case of CoffeeScript, it simplifies Javascript by requiring less keystrokes. In  the following JavaScript code, two variables—an array and an object—are created:  elixir function mix  {     mix.less [         'style.less',         'style-rtl.less'     ] ; } ;  var available, list, room;  room = 14;  available = true;  list = [101,102,311,421];  room = {    id: 1,   number: 102,   status: "available" }  room = 14  available = true   list = [101,102,311,421]  room =    id: 1   number: 102   status: "available"  [ 191 ]  In the following CoffeeScript code, the syntax is very similar, but there is no  semicolon required and there is no need for var to create a variable. Also,  indentation is used to define the object's attributes. The code is as follows:   In this CoffeeScript example, there are only a few less characters; however,   for a programmer, less keystrokes can help increase speed and efficiency. To add   the coffee compiler to Elixir, simply use the coffee function, as shown in the  following code:  elixir function mix  {     mix.coffee [         'app.coffee'     ] ; } ;  A summary of compiler commands The following table shows the mapping between preprocessor, language, function,  and where each function expects the source to be. The last column on the right shows  the directory and or name of the resultant combined file.  processor  Language  function  Source directory  Less  Sass  N A  N A  CSS  CSS  CSS  less    sass    styles    JavaScript  scripts    CoffeeScript  JavaScript  coffee     resources assets  less file s .less  resources assets  sass file s .scss  resources assets  css   resources assets  js   resources assets  coffee   Saving with a different name  Default Output  Location  public css  file s .css  public css  file s .css  public css  all.css  public js  all.js  public js  app.js  Optionally, each method takes a second parameter that will override the default  location. To use a different directory,  in this case, a directory called app , simply   add the directory as a second parameter:  mix.scripts null,'public app js' .styles null,'public app css' ;  In this example, the files will be saved at public app jsand public app css.  [ 192 ]   Putting everything together Finally, let's put everything together to draw an interesting conclusion. Since  CoffeeScript scripts and less and sass files are not merged but copied into the  destination directly, we first save the CoffeeScript, less, and sass files into the  directories where Elixir expects the JavaScript and CSS files to be. Then, we instruct  Elixir to merge and minify all of the JavaScript and CSS files into two merged and  minified files. The code is as follows:  elixir function mix  {     mix.coffee null,'resources assets js'          .sass null,'resources assets css'          .less null,'resources assets css'          .scripts           .styles  ; } ;  It is extremely important to remember that Elixir overwrites files  without verifying that the file exists, so a unique name would need to  be chosen for each of the files. When the command is finished, all. js and all.css will be merged and minified in the public js and  public css directories.  Running tests with Elixir In addition to compiling and sending notifications, Elixir may also be used to  automate the launching of tests. The following sections will discuss how Elixir   can be used for both PHPSpec and PHPUnit.  PHPSpec The first step would be to run the PHPSpec tests to automate code testing. By adding  phpSpec   to our gulpfile.js as follows, PHPSpec tests will run:  elixir function mix  {     mix.less 'app.less' .phpSpec  ; } ;  [ 193 ]   The output is shown in the following screenshot. The PHPSpec output is maintained,  so the test output is very useful:  When the PHPSpec tests fail, the results are easily readable:  A screenshot of Laravel Elixir's output  [ 194 ]   In this example, phpspec encountered an error in the it creates a reservation test line  as shown in the preceding screenshot.  PHPUnit Similarly, we may add PHPUnit to our suite of tests by adding phpUnit to the list of  tasks as follows:  elixir function mix  {     mix.less 'app.less' .phpSpec  .phpUnit  ; } ;  Creating custom tasks Elixir gives us the ability to create custom tasks to do virtually anything.   One example of a custom task that we could write is to scan the controllers for  annotations. All custom tasks require gulp and laravel-elixir. It is important  to remember that the programming language used is JavaScript, so the syntax may  or may not be familiar, but it is easy enough to learn quickly. If commands will be  executed from the command-line interface, then we shall also import gulp-shell. The  code is as follows:  var gulp = require 'gulp' ; var elixir = require 'laravel-elixir' ; var shell = require 'gulp-shell' ;   *  ----------------------------------------------------------------   Route Annotation Scanner  ----------------------------------------------------------------     We'll run route:scan Artisan to scan for changed files.   Output is written to storage framework routes.scanned.php    *    elixir.extend 'routeScanning', function   {                  gulp.task 'routeScanning', function   {                          return gulp.src '' .       pipe shell 'php artisan route:scan'  ;                  } ;       return this.queueTask 'routeScanning' ;  } ;  [ 195 ]   In this code, we first extend Elixir and give the method a name, for example,  routeScanning. Then, a gulp task is defined and the first argument to the task  method is the name of the command. The second command is a closure containing  the code that will be executed and returned.  Finally, the task is queued for execution by passing the name of the command into  the queueTask method.  Add this script to our chain as follows:  elixir function mix  {     mix.routeScanning  ; } ;  The output will be like this:  $ gulp  [23:24:19] Using gulpfile  var www laravel.example gulpfile.js  [23:24:19] Starting 'default'...  [23:24:19] Starting 'routeScanning'...  [23:24:19] Finished 'default' after 12 ms  [23:24:20] Finished 'routeScanning' after 1 s  Since the pipe function allows chaining of commands, it is easy to add in a  notification that will alert the notification system, as follows:  var gulp = require 'gulp' ; var elixir = require 'laravel-elixir' ; var shell = require 'gulp-shell' ; var Notification = require '. commands Notification' ;   elixir.extend 'routeScanning', function   {                  gulp.task 'routeScanning', function   {                          return gulp.src '' .                              pipe shell 'php artisan                                route:scan'  .                              pipe new Notification  . message 'Annotations scanned.'  ;                  } ;      return this.queueTask 'routeScanning' ;   } ;  [ 196 ]   Here, the Notification class is pulled in and a new notification is created to send  the message Annotations scanned. to the notification system.  Running the code produces the following output. Notice that the gulp-notify has  been added:  $ gulp  [23:46:59] Using gulpfile  var www laravel.example gulpfile.js  [23:46:59] Starting 'default'...  [23:46:59] Starting 'routeScanning'...  [23:46:59] Finished 'default' after 38 ms  PHP Warning:  Module 'xdebug' already loaded in Unknown on line 0  Routes scanned!  [23:47:00] gulp-notify: [Laravel Elixir] Annotations scanned  [23:47:00] Finished 'routeScanning' after 1.36 s  Setting up a file watcher Obviously, running gulp every time we want to compile the cascading style sheets or  scan for annotations is tedious. Fortunately, a watcher mechanism is built into Elixir.  To invoke it, simply run the following command:  $ gulp watch  This will allow any tasks that have been placed into the gulpfile.js chain to  automatically run when certain changes occur. The code necessary to enable this in  the annotation task is as follows:   this.registerWatcher "routeScanning",     "app Http Controllers ** *.php" ;  The preceding code registers a watch. The first argument is the routeScanning task.  The second command is the directory pattern that will be watched for modifications.  Since we know that route annotations will be inside the controllers, we may set the  path to look only inside the app Http Controllers  directory. The regex style  syntax will match on any file with a php extension in any one of the directories that  are located under controllers.  Now, whenever a file matching the pattern is modified, the routeScanning task,   as well as any other tasks that are watching files that match the same pattern.  [ 197 ]   Additional Laravel Elixir tasks The npm website provides more than 75 tasks that deal with testing, JavaScript, CSS,  and more. The npm website is located at http:  npmjs.com.  A screenshot of the npm website containing many useful Laravel Elixir tasks  [ 198 ]   Summary In this chapter, you learned how Elixir's growing task list can help both the   full-stack developer as well as a team of developers. Some of the tasks are related  to frontend development, such as compiling, combining, and minifying CSS and  JavaScript. Other tasks are related to backend development, such as behavior-driven  development. Integrating these tasks into the daily development workflow will  make it easy for the entire team to understand the steps that are necessary in the  continuous integration server, where Elixir will execute its tasks, such as testing and  compiling, to prepare the files for development into production.  Since Elixir is built upon gulp, the future of the Elixir will continue to be enriched  as both the gulp and Elixir communities continue to grow and new contributors  continue contributing to Elixir.

Who This Book Is For
If you are an experienced or a capable PHP programmer who has a basic understanding of the concepts of modern PHP (at least version 5.4), this book is ideal for you.

Basic object-oriented programming and database knowledge is expected. You should already know your way around Laravel, or have at least experimented with the framework.
