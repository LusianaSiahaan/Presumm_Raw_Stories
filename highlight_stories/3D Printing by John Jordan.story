In the human history of making things, there have been  several  major  steps.  In  oversimplified  terms,  there  are  three  ways  to  fabricate:  subtraction   hammering  a  flint  arrowhead  or  whittling  a  stick ,  molding   pouring  gold  into  a  sand  mold  or  concrete  into  forms ,  and  addition   building a log cabin or a pyramid . In the nineteenth and  twentieth  centuries,  advances  in  machinery— including  hydraulics— increased the power for moving dirt, metal,  or concrete, while new steel alloys for cutting tools and  other innovations enhanced the precision of subtraction.  In the realm of metalworking, however, the precision of  subtraction far exceeded the precision of addition: even as  recently as the 1990s, computer numerical control  CNC   machine tools as well as laser and waterjet cutters could    remove material far more impressively and precisely than  anything could add it.  Beginning  in  the  1980s,  however,  computers  were  harnessed to the task of adding minute amounts of ma- terial  with  heretofore  impossible  precision.  Initially  the  machines  were  used  to  make  plastic  mock- ups  of  new  computer- aided  design   CAD   files  and  were  known  as  rapid  prototyping  tools.  By  the  early  1990s,  the  same  ap- proach  was  adapted  to  metal.  In  the  twenty- plus  years  since, the advantages of additive manufacturing, as it has  come to be called, continue to accumulate and move be- yond prototyping into production.  Meanwhile,  in  classrooms  and  home  workshops  in  many countries, low- cost machines for medium- precision  forming of plastic have sold in large numbers. An ethos  similar  to  the  homebrew  computer  clubs  of  the  1980s  motivates  a  “maker  culture”  of  people  who  are  familiar  with  computing,  eager  to  create  things,  and  share  tips  and designs through both physical and virtual networks.  In many cases, computer files used to create small plastic  items  whether a knob or a cartoon figure  are shared in  line  with  the  principles  of  open- source  software.  “Addi- tive manufacturing” feels too heavy- duty and industrial  for this branch of the technology, so we will refer to it as  3D printing. Overall, many in the industry use both terms  interchangeably, and we will follow that convention when  talking about commercial applications.  2     chapter 1   What Is 3D Printing?  A word about usage: 3D printing is an accessible term, and  can make the process sound simpler than it actually is. As  one observer notes, “rapid prototype that for me” is much  less intuitive or direct even though it would be more ac- curate for the first fifteen years of the technology’s exis- tence. In figure 1.1, we see from Google Trends data that  the term 3D printing is far more commonly used than ad- ditive manufacturing, at least in web searches since 2004.  Why is the technology so important now? There are  many reasons. First, ecological concerns, combined with  economic  logic,  favor  techniques  of  manufacturing  that  do not use expensive, time- consuming processes to mill  away large quantities of metal, titanium alloy in the case  of aerospace components.  The colloquial term here is the  “buy  to  fly”  ratio,  referring  to  how  much  of  the  original  metal ends up in the finished part.  Second, building up  a  work  in  process   to  be  subsequently  worked  via  some  other technology  allows for new geometries compared to  cutting  or  molding.  Examples  include  honeycomb  struc- tures that are extremely strong relative to their weight, or  internal cooling channels in an industrial stamping tool.  Third, the prospect of printing in mixed materials prom- ises lower cost, higher strength, and cleaner design: imag- ine a football helmet with a radio antenna integral to the  polycarbonate plastic body rather than being fabricated by      IntroductIon      3   120   100   80   60   40   20   0   4     chapter 1                                                                                         1 0 - 4 0 0 2  7 0 - 4 0 0 2  1 0 - 5 0 0 2  7 0 - 5 0 0 2  1 0 - 6 0 0 2  7 0 - 6 0 0 2  1 0 - 7 0 0 2  7 0 - 7 0 0 2  1 0 - 8 0 0 2  7 0 - 8 0 0 2  1 0 - 9 0 0 2  7 0 - 9 0 0 2  1 0 - 0 1 0 2  7 0 - 0 1 0 2  1 0 - 1 1 0 2  7 0 - 1 1 0 2  1 0 - 2 1 0 2  7 0 - 2 1 0 2  1 0 - 3 1 0 2  7 0 - 3 1 0 2  1 0 - 4 1 0 2  7 0 - 4 1 0 2  1 0 - 5 1 0 2  7 0 - 5 1 0 2  1 0 - 6 1 0 2  7 0 - 6 1 0 2  1 0 - 7 1 0 2  7 0 - 7 1 0 2  1 0 - 8 1 0 2  All categories additive  manufacturing  worldwide   All categories 3d printing   worldwide    Interest in additive manufacturing, as measured by Google   Figure 1.1  searches, has been growing steadily since about 2012, whereas 3D printing  exhibits a more unstable pattern of pubic attention.  Data source: Google  Trends    an  entirely  separate  supply  chain  and  then  glued  on  af- ter molding. Fourth, many industries ranging from aero- space to construction equipment are intent on building an  end- to- end “digital thread” to maintain the integrity of a  design from specification to end use, and the computer-  assisted fabrication of such parts maintains extreme fidel- ity between computer design and final product, reducing  variability.  On the 3D- printing front, the urge not only to create  but  to  personalize  some  aspects  of  one’s  material  envi- ronment is well served by this technology. As some key  patents  expired  in  the  United  States   particularly  in  re- gard to fused deposition modeling , home- market printer  prices dropped by a factor of ten, to less than $1,000, after  2009. As we will see in chapter 4, a broadly based maker  movement both was empowered by and created demand  for 3D printers. Finally, the ability to personalize plastic  output has merged with the use of smartphones for self-  portraiture in 3D- printed figurines of real people: wedding  cakes, to take just one example, can feature recognizable  likenesses of the featured couple.  Why Does It Matter?  Why do 3D printing and additive manufacturing matter?  It is crucial to begin by insisting that very few fabrication      IntroductIon      5   technologies  are  used  in  isolation:  hammers,  saws,  and  levels  are  all  essential  to  carpentry.  Similarly,  additive  technologies must be integrated with the rest of the man- ufacturing tool box, and this will take time as more people  unlearn  or perhaps never knew  the former limits of the  possible.  Here’s  one  example  of  how  that  can  happen:  several companies have introduced large industrial tools  that combine metal deposition and five- axis CNC machin- ing in one box. Thus, a raw section can be built up, then  moved  across  the  machine  to  be  more  precisely  shaped  and or polished. The hybrid process can be repeated back  and  forth,  with  additive  material  being  deposited  on  a  partially finished milled part. Many additive processes in  metal especially focus on a near- net shape as their objec- tive, with subtractive techniques generating the final pre- cise geometry.  Five broad usage scenarios have emerged for additive  manufacturing.  Two  of  these  are  currently  niche  mar- kets: on- site fabrication in remote locations like offshore  oil rigs, and printing materials that cannot be tradition- ally  worked.  Mass  customization   the  third  market   is  emerging as a major opportunity, as for hearing aids and  orthodontic applications. Two final markets relate to pro- duction parts, where additive manufacturing is best used  when  complex  shapes  and or  short  production  runs  of  manufactured goods are required.  6     chapter 1   One major category where 3D printing is excelling is  in making things that make things. Many assembly tech- niques involve the use of jigs and fixtures to hold work  in precise locations while other operations are performed,  or to protect a production piece from tools being used to  fasten it. Desktop plastic printers can excel in this domain,  and  factories  are  including  more  and  more  3D- printed  workplace  tools,  custom- made  for  the  job.  Volkswagen  used this approach to reduce jig and fixture development  costs— and time— by more than 90 percent. Unlike CNC-  milled metal fixtures, the plastic parts can be rapidly it- erated in response to operator feedback, often improving  ergonomics.1  Whether it is a steel insert used in mass production of  plastic items  such as a drinking cup , a silicone mold for  precision medical products, a solid pattern around which  sand is molded to receive molten metal, or a sand mold  printed  through  binder  jetting,  additive  techniques  are  well suited to low- volume, high- value operations. An ex- cellent example can be seen in a small one- hundred- year-  old company in Baltimore.  Case Study: Danko Arlington Industrial patternmaking is a behind- the- scenes activity  that produces industrial patterns for the foundry industry.  An industrial pattern, in turn, is a form used to create a      IntroductIon      7   precisely defined cavity in a sand mold used for casting  molten metal into shapes.  Danko Arlington is a manufacturing company located  in  Baltimore,  Maryland,  established  in  1920.  The  com- pany consists of a pattern shop, an aluminum casting sand  foundry, and a CNC machine shop to finish their castings  to  tighter  tolerances  and  dimensions.  According  to  the  firm’s president, there are probably fewer than three hun- dred pattern- making businesses in the United States. Ab- sent patternmaking and new patterns, a whole segment of  the foundry industry cannot grow.  In 2010, Danko Arlington invested in additive manu- facturing  technology  to  help  transform  a  business  that  was constrained by the lack of skilled patternmakers. Tra- ditionally, patterns for low- volume castings were carved  out of wood by skilled artisans, but the hand- crafted trade  is no longer being taught. Enter a fused deposition model- ing  FDM  3D printer using various grades of polymers:  Danko Arlington prints primarily in a polycarbonate ma- terial because it is durable, is strong enough to handle the  weight of compressed sand, and resists the petroleum sol- vents used in the sand molds.  The  3D- printed  patterns  have  many  advantages:  de- signers can specify corners, twisting surfaces, and reverse  angles  without  being  concerned  that  the  pattern  maker  can carve them in poplar wood. The tolerances of the sand  32′′  are far larger than the printer’s accuracy,  mold  + -   1  8     chapter 1   measured in thousands of an inch. One CAD designer can  do more work than several pattern makers, and can work  off- site on a laptop. Time savings are significant: a pattern  that an artisan would produce in weeks is now generated  in hours, including exact replicas when the initial pattern  wears out. That faster turnaround time is also extremely  predictable, improving project scheduling. Finally, the 3D-  printed pattern can be included in a proposal, impressing  the client with the model’s fidelity to the original request. Danko Arlington had many challenges in its transition  to the new technology. Industrial 3D printers are expen- sive. The polycarbonate filament is many times more ex- pensive than the poplar wood used in traditional patterns,  so  the  firm  experiments  with  multi- material  patterns,  using the high- cost polycarbonate only where necessary  rather than as a solid volume. Patterns for thin parts, in  particular, can deform as they cool, crack under the load  of heavy sand, or deform in hot sand. Finally, even precise  FDM  parts  require  post- processing   see  chapter  2 ,  and  given the tight tolerances, just a little too much sanding  can ruin a pattern.  In the end, the transformation in Danko Arlington’s  entire business process resulting from the shift to additive  methods has led to a revenue uptick, and the firm contin- ues to add staff across many functional areas, including  sales,  molding,  and  delivery  drivers.  Further,  Danko  Ar- lington announced in 2018 that it had purchased a third      IntroductIon      9   additive manufacturing machine, to join two FDM units:  a binder- jetting machine will 3D print in sand, making the  molds  directly.  A  new  five- thousand- square- foot  facility  is dedicated to additive fabrication, marking a significant  evolution in a nearly one- hundred- year- old company us- ing methods that date to the Bronze Age.2  Back to the question of why computer- guided additive  technologies matter: the limits of what is possible to cre- ate are being redrawn. New software tools will generate  CAD files from little more than a list of basic parameters  using a process called generative design. Getting new gen- erations of engineers and artisans into the workplace will  take time, but will exploit the new design flexibility com- ing into both the software and fabrication phases. At the  same time, economies of scale are also being challenged.  Whether for prototypes, spare parts, custom- fitted pieces   prosthetics are a prime example , or for other unique ap- plications,  it  is  now  possible  to  economically  make  one  or two of something. With plastics, the process of mold-  making and retooling of the production line made short  runs impractical. Those limits are now being transcended  dramatically.  With  metals,  the  economies  of  scale  are  more complex: while there are stamping operations that  rely on long runs just as plastics do, some fabrications are  intricate and done in very small batches. Here, additive  manufacturing offers the potential for higher fidelity to  the  electronic  blueprint,  closer  tolerances  than  human   10     chapter 1   welders  can  achieve,  and  design  features   such  as  inter- nal  cooling  fins   that  could  not  be  built  with  previous  technologies.  To take one example, Facebook bought a 3D- printing  company that embeds electronics in additively manufac- tured  modular  housings.  The  acquisition  is  expected  to  help accelerate Facebook’s hardware innovation, such as  virtual reality goggles, and was to be supported by a re- ported $6 million budget as of late 2016.3  Looking ahead a bit, 3D printing will increase people’s  ability to enhance aesthetics, durability, and or function- ality by varying the material composition within a part.  Consider an airplane wing: some sections might be made  of a composite for weight and radar stealth considerations.  Other parts might need to resist deterioration from expo- sure to fuel or hydraulic fluid. Still others might need to  accept precision threading for bolt- on components. Other  pieces  might  function  as  antennas.  Just  as  some  home  printers allow for plastic items to be printed in multiple  colors, in the future manufactured parts might be seam- lessly  built  up  from  a  collection  of  materials,  each  opti- mized for what it is doing in that particular application.   An MIT lab has demonstrated a technology for mixing ten  different materials in the same pass of the printer head. 4 The same idea has been applied to housing by a differ- ent lab at MIT: at a large scale, a nozzle can expel insula- tion as well as interior and exterior wall materials.5 As the      IntroductIon      11   US manufacturing economy shifts from mass production  of consumer items like shoes or bicycles to advanced prod- ucts such as MRI machines or jet engines, several emerg- ing  technologies— sensors,  big  data,  robotics,  advanced  materials, machine learning— are enabling new levels of  precision, productivity, and innovation. 3D printing fits  squarely in this cluster of technologies, situated as it is at  the intersection of materials science, robotics, cloud com- puting, sensing and imaging, crowdsourcing, data analyt- ics, and other areas.  The  notion  of  “mass  customization”  was  first  dis- cussed  in  the  1990s:  how  could  businesses  maintain  economies  of  scale  while  also  tailoring  offers  to  unique  customers?6 Software proved amenable to such variation,  but  until  recently,  physical  items  were  hard  to  manage  along competing parameters of speed and cost versus in- dividual tailoring. Now, many custom- fit items are being  produced using additive techniques. Dental implants and  braces are proven to work; some dentists have 3D printers  on site. In medicine, doctors will print a replica of an in- ternal organ for orientation before surgery: if the backside  of a child’s heart must be repaired without direct line of  sight, having navigated the life- size model beforehand will  facilitate better surgical planning and preparation. Hear- ing aids are a textbook example of mass customization:  3D  stereolithography  now  generates  almost  all  commer- cially available devices, improving fit and comfort while   12     chapter 1   reducing returns from bad fits. Drill guides for dentists are  a type of “tooling” much like that used in industry, but for  much more precise, and unique, orientation.  Prosthetics are an obvious area of opportunity, rang- ing from robotic exoskeletons to artificial limbs; Carolina  Panthers  linebacker  Thomas  Davis  wore  a  3D- printed  sleeve to protect a broken arm in Super Bowl 50. Wheel- chairs are another area ripe for improvement. Given that  exoskeletons that allow a paralyzed person to meet people  face- to- face and standing upright are still years away from  commercial  availability,  3D- printed  wheelchair  compo- nents  promise  better  comfort,  fewer  medical  complica- tions,  better  safety,  lighter  weight,  and  other  tangible  benefits  in  the  interim.  Less  tangible  but  similarly  im- portant are the possibilities for paraplegics to personalize  their equipment.  Speaking  of  sports,  athletic- shoe  manufacturers  are  providing  custom- fit  cleats  to  elite  athletes:  Cleveland  Indians pitcher Corey Kluber was the first major league  baseball player to use 3D- printed cleats on his shoes when  he wore a custom- made pair in 2017.7  His supplier, New  Balance,  launched  a  digital  sports  division  in  2016,  the  same year Under Armour announced 3D printing would  be a key technology in its new R&D center, and the same  year Nike partnered with HP to investigate 3D printing.   Olympic  sprinter  Alyson  Felix  wore  custom- made  3D-  printed spikes from Nike at the 2016 Rio games. Nike has      IntroductIon      13   Prosthetics are an  obvious area of  opportunity, ranging  from robotic  exoskeletons to   artificial limbs.   also adapted sock- knitting technology to create shoe up- pers  that  are  produced  without  the  waste  of  traditional  cut- and- sew processes.  According to the Wall Street Jour- nal, the Nike Flyknit shoe was the first mass- produced ad- ditively manufactured consumer product.8   Additive manufacturing and 3D printing  both indus- trial and consumer- grade technologies are included here   have  the  potential  to  reinvent  supply  chains:  instead  of  goods being made only in capital- intensive factories often  located far from the end user, production can be moved to  where the product will be used. The most extreme case of  this phenomenon was on the International Space Station,  where a 3D printer made a wrench in zero gravity.9 Closer  to earth, the same dynamic can allow navy ships at sea  to fabricate repair parts on board rather than warehouse  completed pieces in a highly constrained space, wait un- til they enter port, or request a complex resupply while  deployed.  Maintaining obsolete spare parts is an issue for many  businesses, whether the product is a bomber  the first B-  52 entered service in 1954 and the plane is expected to still  be flying after 2040  or a tractor  Caterpillar still supports  machines made one hundred years ago . Mass production,  followed by warehousing of an indefinite duration, is ex- pensive and inefficient; in contrast, additive methods fit  the  business  need  very  closely,  including  the  capability  to repair broken gear teeth, for example, that previously      IntroductIon      15   had to be replaced with a whole new part. Short runs of  metal parts, including those without CAD drawings and  or whose manufacturer no longer exists, can be facilitated  by reverse engineering using 3D- scanning techniques fol- lowed by additive manufacturing, often in a matter of days  rather than weeks.  3D Printing in the Context of Digital Fabrication  Neil Gershenfeld of MIT is a pioneer in the use of 3D print- ers as a component in a compact fabrication lab that decen- tralizes industrial making from big expensive factories to  small- scale but high- tech workspaces. In the early 2000s  he was studying how these labs changed peoples’ relation- ships to their made environment, their learning patterns,  and their expectations of the technology. Reflecting on his  experiences in 2012, Gershenfeld published a key article10  that identified many of the central issues.     3D printers, by themselves, are not nearly as  interesting as additive technologies combined with CNC  machine tools, drill presses, and other standard fixtures  of a workshop. Analogously, for all the projections in the  1950s that microwave ovens were the future of cooking,  “Microwaves are convenient, but they don’t replace the  rest of the kitchen”  p. 44 .  16     chapter 1      Just as the personal computer took enterprise  technology into the home, office, or classroom, so too  is additive manufacturing decentralizing the means of  industrial production. People with PCs, in turn, did not  drive assembly lines or calculate artillery projections;  they sent messages, looked up recipes, and listened to  music. What will happen to formerly industrial tools  when they become commoditized, then consumerized?     Rather than taking mass production into the home  or community space, digital fabrication brings the  ability to make the items that aren’t found in mass  market retailers: better- fitting, more expressive, or  custom- configured things— whether shoes, crutches, or  jewelry— represent whole new markets that factory- scale  production could not  and usually did not want to  reach.     Geography no longer limits who can have what, when.  At the extreme, being able to print nutrients and protein  at one’s desire rather than waiting for what’s in season  or being subject to the mass tastes implicit in mass  marketing will change what it means to feel at home.  At the same time, people working with the same tools  in different places, connected digitally, can create and  problem- solve in powerful ways. Changes in tools and  networks will change the nature of making.     This decentralized model of making is hard to regulate  or shape. Unlike color copiers, which announce their      IntroductIon      17   unique identifier with encoded dots and so cannot  anonymously counterfeit currency, 3D printers can in  some cases actually replicate themselves. There is no  central authority that can enforce copyright, patent, or  even good taste. In response, the maker community is  embracing many tenets of open- source software.     Gershenfeld concludes with a powerful insight: “The  real strength of a fab lab is not technical; it is social.  The innovative people that drive a knowledge economy  share a common trait: by definition, they are not good  at following rules. To be able to invent, people need to  question assumptions”  p. 57 . In the future, the barriers  between things and data, and between bits and atoms,  will grow even fuzzier than they are today, meaning   that 3D printing is but a step on a much longer journey  to redefine computation, fabrication, innovation,  disability, and many other limits that used to be taken   as given.  Questions  The  technical  capabilities  of  3D  printing  advance  every   year,  aided  not  only  by  new  science  and  engineering  knowledge but also by more field experience. That craft  knowledge, in turn, is sometimes instantiated in software,   18     chapter 1   giving more users the benefit of hard- won experience. So- cial networks of makers, both consumer-  and industrial-  grade, are key for spreading trade knowledge. Schools, too,  have a critical role to play in preparing students to work  with, on, and alongside these new machines. As we will see,  designing for additive manufacturing departs from many  past practices and assumptions.  Despite much good news from users of the technology,  the  industry  is  still  wrestling  with  how  to  make  money.  High margins on supplies such as metal powder or liquid  polymer  are  the  profit  engine  for  many  machine  manu- facturers;  initial  machine  sales  by  themselves  are  much  more competitive. High prices on materials can dissuade  users  from  experimenting  on  or  otherwise  running  the  machines, so adoption is slowed. The industry at large is  confronting this conundrum, with mixed success.  As of 2018, the stock prices of many additive manufac- turing suppliers are flat, having retreated from high valua- tions in 2013– 2014. MakerBot, a leading consumer brand  in the field, was bought by Stratasys, which in turn saw  sales slow and its share price slide; several rounds of mass  layoffs at MakerBot ensued, cutting the peak workforce  by 50 percent as of early 2017. GE has either purchased  or  invested  in  a  number  of  additive  companies,  includ- ing  acquisitions  of  Morris  Technologies,  Arcam   includ- ing its Canadian powdered metals subsidiary AP&C , and  Concept  Laser,  as  well  as  smaller  positions  in  Desktop      IntroductIon      19   Metal,  MatterFab,  and  others.  The  acquisitions  are  bun- dled into the GE Additive business unit, but GE at large is  in the midst of significant restructuring, so the additive  business  is  only  one  of  many  competing  priorities.  Fur- thermore, GE suffered a public setback as its GE Digital  business  failed  to  achieve  sufficient  market  uptake;  it’s  unclear whether the firm can understand and execute a  digital transformation, including in additive manufactur- ing.11 Elsewhere, HP jumped into the market late but with  a significant presence. In each of these instances, corpo- rate managers and startups alike are experimenting with  different business models.  Powdered  metals,  filament,  filters,  gases,  and  other  inputs  to  additive  processes  are  expensive,  especially  compared  to  the  same  material  sold  into  conventional  molding or milling applications. In some cases, this prac- tice reflects the razors- and- blades business model attrib- uted  somewhat loosely  to King Gillette12 in the 1920s:  sell  a  platform  at  a  competitive  price— even  a  loss— to  lock  in  customers  to  your  resupply,  which  you  then  sell  at extremely high margins. HP does this with printer ink,  but somewhat surprisingly is encouraging open markets  for supplies in its new 3D- printing business. Arcam GE  and  other  companies,  meanwhile,  limit  their  custom- ers’  choices  to  official  powder  and  other  consumables,  strongly influencing the total landed cost of a 3D- printed   part.  20     chapter 1   Other  companies  are  selling  printing  as  a  service,  functioning as job shops for multiple customers and free- ing  manufacturers  from  the  learning  curve  associated  with  the  new  technology.  According  to  Wohlers  Associ- ates, an industry analyst focused on 3D printing, services  revenue growth through 2017 has outpaced product rev- enue growth every year except one since 2010.13  “Services”  includes  printing  for  customers,  maintenance  contracts,  training, and the like.  As the two biggest pure- play com- panies in the field— Stratasys and 3D Systems— struggle  to scale in the face of the entry of giants including GE and  HP,  these  business  model  questions  will  intensify  in  im- portance. Balancing products and services, new sales vs  resupply vs maintenance, and global customer bases will  all be critical for success.  Some  companies  are  experimenting  with  the  lines  between  machine  sales,  printing,  and  resupply.  Online  marketplaces  are  connecting  people  who  design  objects,  owners of additive capacity  whether a desktop consumer  machine or a full- scale industrial unit , and customers who  want the objects. Shapeways was founded in 2007 then  spun  out  of  the  Dutch  Philips  corporation,  after  which  time  its  headquarters  moved  to  New  York.  Materialise,  a  Belgian  3D- printing  pioneer,  includes  an  i.materialise  subsidiary  designed  to  serve  as  a  printing  service,  on- line  community,  and  marketplace.  Sculpteo,  operating  out  of  France,  serves  both  commercial  and  household      IntroductIon      21   markets,  including  interior  decorators.  Maker Bot  Indus- tries  launched  Thingiverse  to  serve  as  an  open- source  repository  of  community  members’  designs.  Stratasys’s  GrabCAD  functions  similarly,  allowing  engineers  to  bring  designs  to  a  wider  market.  3D  Hubs,  yet  another  Dutch  startup,  is  an  ambitious  play  connecting  more  than 7,000 global 3D- printing services spanning desktop  printers  to  metal- capable  industrial  machines  and  CNC  tools.  Customers  can  currently  choose  from  eight  poly- mer  materials  as  well  as  stainless  steel,  aluminum,  and   titanium.  Because of the high growth rate in the services side of  the market, manufacturers of 3D printers are migrating  toward it, beginning with 3D Systems in 2009: the printer  manufacturer had acquired seventeen service providers as  of 2017. Similarly, Stratasys is a major provider of both  printers and 3D- printed parts. Voxeljet, Arcam, and ExOne  also play both roles. There is an inherent conflict, however,  in that such a model can put the capital- equipment manu- facturers in conflict with their customers.14  It should be clear that 3D printing represents an impor- tant step forward in the history of making things, whether  commercially  or  personally.  It  is,  however,  another  tool   Conclusion  22     chapter 1   in a very large toolbox: Neil Gershenfeld’s insight about  microwave ovens is on target. Determining how to make  these tools, how to sell them, how to integrate them with  the rest of the toolbox, and how to use them to their best  advantage remains an ongoing work in progress, and we  will turn to addressing those questions in the remainder  of this book.     IntroductIon      23    2  FROM CAD  OR REALITY    TO REALITY: THE DESIGN AND  BUILD PROCESS  The  process  whereby  an  idea,  or  a  scan  of  an  object,  is  transformed first to a 3D software model, then to a print- able  file   which  slices  the  planned  physical  object  into  printable layers , and finally to a finished object is com- plex: a blend of many skills and experience is necessary  for success. In addition, additive fabrication, particularly  in metal, requires integration with digital, shop floor, sup- ply chain, and customer- facing processes  particularly in  the case of mass customization . What follows is a cursory  overview of the processes that can be involved. At the high  level, initial choices include  1.  What to build.  2.  What it needs to do.  3.  What it could look like.   4.  What to build it from.  5.  How to model it digitally.  6.  How to build it.  7.  How to treat it after printing.  Basic Design Rules  Design  rules  for  the  primary  structure  itself  are  rapidly  evolving. For a given material in a given fabricating ma- chine,  a  number  of  considerations  must  be  addressed,  and numerous methodologies1 are emerging to do so in a  systematic fashion. The following questions are a sample  rather than a full methodology:     Is the final part designed to move or to stand still?  What loads is it expected to bear? What are the edge  cases of force that could be applied to it?     Similarly, what are the surface characteristics of the  completed assembly? Will surfaces be polished, heat-  treated, painted, powder- coated, or shot- peened after  printing?     What is the relationship of the built item to the  ultimately specified shape and size? Shrinkage, isostatic   26     chapter 2   pressing, milling, sandblasting, and other post-  production steps can affect the ratio of printed shape to  final product. What are the costs, benefits, and risks of  approach A  for example, print using finer powder and  thinner layers, requiring minimal effort after the build   versus approach B  print faster with thicker layers, then  shape and polish the part in post- processing ? How  can the part be built to minimize the cost and potential  damage of post- processing?     What are the minimum and maximum wall thicknesses  for both flat and curved parts? At joints, how do  supported walls behave as opposed to unsupported  walls? What about horizontal edges?     What axis can and should the part be built on?     How are overhangs addressed?     How will the finished part connect to adjacent  components? Will the wall thicknesses tolerate threading  and or are the inner walls of the hole smooth and precise  enough to support a specified tolerance with regard to a  bolt or other fastener?     How are transitions between materials, either in the  part or in a larger assembly, handled?     Can moving parts, for example a hinge, be printed  rather than assembled?     FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      27   Materials  Apart from specialized cases such as sand castings, ceram- ics, and now a growing list of composites, 3D- printed ma- terial is usually some type of plastic, in both home and  industrial  applications,  or  metal.  Those  accustomed  to  consumer- grade filament priced at roughly $45 kilogram  would  be  stunned  by  the  costs  and  capabilities  of  high-  end engineering polymers. To take but one example, poly- etheretherketone   PEEK   can  be  used  in  environments  reaching about 500 degrees Fahrenheit  250 centigrade ,  is  strong  enough  to  be  used  in  pumps  and  ultra- high  vacuum environments, and is durable enough to be used  in  aerospace,  semiconductor  fabrication,  and  medical  implantation applications. It was developed in the early  1980s and can cost roughly $1,200 for a 1′′ thick 12′′ × 12′′  slab. Powder is substantially more expensive: a violin 3D  printed out of PEEK in the Netherlands was said to cost  20,000 euros.2  The  two  classes  of  polymers  used  in  additive  tech- nologies  can  be  divided  into  thermoplastics  and  thermo- sets  which somewhat confusingly includes polymers that  cure under light rather than heat . Thermoplastics can be  melted  and  solidified,  repeatedly,  making  many  plastics  recyclable.  Traditional  injection  molding  and  the  most  common consumer 3D printers both heat up a solid ther- moplastic  in the latter case, often a filament much like   28     chapter 2   those used on string trimmers  to make it malleable, then  form it either in layers or molds. In contrast, thermosets  do not melt, but are cured with heat, light, and or a cata- lyst.  Once exposed to heat, however, thermosets can lose  structural  integrity.   These  polymers  are  used  in  every- thing from bowling balls to laminated countertops, and  are not recyclable.  Ceramics,  sand,  and  other  materials  can  be  printed  as  well.  Materials  can  enter  additive  manufacturing  as  wire filament, liquid slurry paste, or powder. Given the  higher temperatures involved, metal- capable 3D printers  are typically beyond the reach of home users given finan- cial,  power- supply,  and  workplace- safety  considerations.  New filaments are on the market, however, that mix a soft  metal such as copper or brass with 11.5 percent polymer,  making  some  desktop  printers  metal- capable  under  cer- tain circumstances. Other composites are emerging. Some  blend carbon fiber into a polymer filament, providing ad- ditional strength  see chapter 3 .  One  key  attribute  for  additive  materials  is  compat- ibility  with  human  health.  The  US  FDA  has  cleared  a  transparent resin for use in dental appliances such as re- tainers. PEEK  mentioned above for its high performance  and  high  cost   as  well  as  the  titanium  alloy  Ti- 6Al- 4V  have  been  approved  for  implantation.  Considerations  such as outgassing, toxicity, and the effects of oxidation  or photosensitivity are also being assessed for products       FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      29   that could be worn or otherwise used in close proximity  to people.  The  metallurgy  of  additive  manufacturing  is  a  com- plex and fascinating field largely beyond our consideration  here. It is rare for a metal to be formed of a pure element:  even  18  karat  gold  contains  25  percent  of  its  weight  in  other elements. Thus, most industrial processes are per- formed on alloys of multiple metals. For example, there  are more than 3,500 types of steel: in its simplest form,  iron and less than 1 percent carbon are heated and worked.  Titanium is commonly used in additive manufacturing of  aircraft parts in a family of alloys beginning with 6 per- cent aluminum and 4 percent vanadium. The point here  is  that  with  thousands  of  metallic  alloys  already  in  use,  choosing how, when, and why to convert them to use in  additive processes will take years of research, trial, and er- ror.  A case in point: aluminum and titanium powders are  pyrophoric, meaning they can be explosive when mishan- dled, including in post- processing.3 Aluminum and ferric  powders  trapped  in  a  filter  together  can  be  particularly  dangerous.4   To  date,  most  metals  used  in  additive  manufactur- ing  were  available  in  powder  form  for  other  purposes.  Also, most alloys that were used for conventional manu- facturing  have  not  been  successfully  3D  printed,  often  because they are not readily available in the appropriate  power form. It is expected that new alloys will be designed   30     chapter 2   Aluminum and   titanium powders are  pyrophoric, meaning  they can be explosive   when mishandled.   specifically  for  additive  manufacturing,  particularly  in  their resistance to cracking and lower tendency to develop   porosity.5  In  metal  printing,  grain  behavior  is  critically  impor- tant. Grains are multi- atom structures that are formed as  molten metal  which has no crystal structure  is cooled,  and  are  a  key  factor  in  a  metal’s  microstructure.  Micro- structure, in turn, determines most important properties  of the metal: thermal and electrical conductivity, strength,  elasticity, fatigue behavior, and so on. In traditional cast- ings, outer edges, which cool first, are microscopically dif- ferent  from  the  interior,  which  cools  last.  Thus  forging,  which  is  a  combination  of  sub- melting- point  heat  and  physical  forces,  generally  produces  stronger  steel  than  casting:  the  crystal  structures  that  formed  as  the  ingot  cooled are strengthened by the forces applied to them in  the reshaping process. A casting, in contrast, allows more  freedom of shape because, as we have seen, molten metal  lacks all structure so it can pour into many desired con- figurations.  Alloys behave differently from pure metals,  complicating the grain issue further.   The thermal history of a metal piece goes a long way  toward determining its crystal structure, and therefore its  physical properties. Because the intense point of heat in  metal 3D printing behaves very differently from an entire  vessel of molten metal, the crystal structures of additively  produced metals are different from castings  or forgings   32     chapter 2   for that matter .6 Exactly how, why, and when these dif- ferences emerge is still poorly understood.  Recent research suggests that taking advantage of the  precise control of the laser or electron beam heat source  can create many heretofore unobserved effects in a piece  of metal by manipulating these grain structures. For ex- ample, the properties of a build can be varied by the local  needs  of  the  piece   such  as  strength,  weight,  smooth- ness, porosity, and ductility  without introducing a multi-  material aspect to the build: merely managing the heating  and  cooling  processes  differently  at  different  points  in  the  build  can  affect  the  local  performance  of  the  mate- rial.7 Other researchers at Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory were able to double and sometimes triple the  strength of stainless steel, once again with innovations in  the laser heating and controlled cooling process.8 A third  team  found  that  doping  metal  powder  with  zirconium-  based nanoparticles made it possible to print  and prob- ably weld  in previously impossible grades of aluminum  alloys.9 The recency, variety, and impact of these develop- ments suggest that metal- based printing could get a lot  better very fast.  One  key  alloy  that  has  been  adapted  for  use  in  ad- ditive  manufacturing  is  Inconel.  This  class  of  twenty  metals, based on a blend of nickel and chromium, is tech- nically called a superalloy and was developed shortly after  World War II for use in jet- engine turbine blades. These      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      33   components must be light, precisely shaped, strong, and  heat- resistant given the intense temperatures and stresses  of  the  operating  environment.  Failure  is  expensive  and  dangerous given that blades from the early stages of the  engine can get pulled through the remaining stages; cata- strophic failure is common if a single blade breaks. Thus,  the  emerging  industry  needed  metals  that  maintained  their  strength  until  nearly  their  melting  point.  Roughly  fifty years later, Inconel was used relatively early in the  research phase of what was then called laser manufactur- ing  circa 1990s , in part because of its importance to the  aerospace and defense industries funding the research.  Going  forward,  it  is  expected  that  both  metals  and  polymers will be designed for additive applications rather  than  being  adapted  from  other,  older  fabrication  meth- ods. Experience with and further research into the many  available materials will also continue to improve both the  ability  of  additive  techniques  to  supersede  formative  or  subtractive  manufacturing  and  define  the  cost benefit  tradeoff frontier.  Many  physical  builds  have  been  discarded  as  software  glitches are discovered and fixed. A new class of build man- agement software that begins by checking and repairing   Data  34     chapter 2   the file that will drive the printer has emerged, exempli- fied  by  Netfabb  from  Autodesk  and  Magics  from  Mate- rialise.  These  packages,  along  with  other  programs,  can   also  generate  support  structure  sizing  and  placement.   See below.   Even  though  3D  modeling  tools  have  been  used  for  more than twenty years, 2D technical documents, often on  paper, are still common. On many of these, measurements  and  other  information  taken  off  the  3D  “master”  repre- sent  approximations.  Additive  manufacturing  is  emerg- ing in the workplace at the same time that new software  packages, file formats, and process definitions attempt to  break that 3D to 2D handoff with something called model-  based  engineering;  instead,  tolerances,  dimensions,  sur- face treatments, and other data all travel with the original  design through the production workflow, and indeed the  product  lifecycle.  As  of  2018,  technical  workshops,  new  product launches, and company startups in this vein are  widespread.  The  connections  to  additive  manufacturing  are obvious: if digital production of original 3D CAD files  helps maintain the “digital thread” from original design  all the way through spare parts replenishment, clerical er- rors should decline, process speeds accelerate, and quality  improve.10  In addition to creating a 3D model in software as a  natively digital design, it is also possible to scan a physical  object, sometimes as part of reverse- engineering a spare      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      35   part: the engineer may lack a CAD file, or even a blueprint,  and so must specify a build to match an existing, possibly  broken, component. Many tools can facilitate this process,  from contact scanners that physically probe the object to  be reproduced  at the risk of damaging fragile items such  as historical artifacts , to CT and MRI scanners for body  organs  and  structures,  to  many  uses  of  light  and  lasers,  some of them suitable for home use. Applications range  from  civil  engineering   site  modeling  and  analysis   and  architectural modeling to crime- scene analysis to reverse  engineering of existing parts to reproducing cultural arti- facts to dental fixtures. 3D scans often replace molds or  artisanal cut- and- try methods of production. These tech- nologies also figure in the post- processing phase as they  test the dimensionality of the build against the original  specifications.  The STL data format  standing for stereolithography   was created in 1989 by 3D Systems and thus is quite dated  relative  to  today’s  computing,  software,  and  imaging  benchmarks. For example, although STL is bulky it does  not include certain necessary information. Thus, different  software packages must interpolate  that is, guess  how  geometric  triangles  are  connected  rather  than  read  this  information from the file. This interpolation makes STL  slow to process, and the guesses can be wrong.11 STL also  does not support many new features of printers that are  more modern than those available thirty years ago, and   36     chapter 2   basic  information  relating  to  colors,  materials,  physical  orientation of the build, and so forth is often not captured.  OBJ  object  files, more commonly found in 3D graphics  workflows such as video games, are also sometimes used  in place of STL.  Two new additive manufacturing data standards have  emerged over the past decade.12 The additive manufactur- ing format  AMF  came out of an ASTM  American Society  for Testing and Materials  committee tasked with replac- ing the STL format. The first iteration of AMF was made  public in 2011 and an improved version was approved by  the International Organization for Standardization  ISO   in 2013.  More  recently,  Microsoft  included  support  for  3D  printing in Windows 8.1 and the then- upcoming Windows  10  in  yet  another  format;  the  3MF  consortium  was  an- nounced in 2015. Functionally, it is similar to AMF: both  are based on the XML standard and are human- readable  with regard to materials, tolerances, and other attributes.  Microsoft  started  with  a  model  of  a  paper  print  queue,  so  the  interface  design  is  similar:  choose  a  file,  select  a  printer from a list, choose from available options  high vs  low resolution, color vs black and white, material choices ,  and push “print.”  A  major  question  for  the  industry  going  forward  re- lates to digital rights management  DRM . Much as Hol- lywood has engineered copy protection into Blu- ray and 4K      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      37   video formats, holders of intellectual property rights for  physical items may seek to enforce those rights in software.  Just as a color copier cannot make super- accurate copies of  currency without identifying the device, will 3D printers  lock out certain classes of files, designs, or materials? Both  AMF  and  3MF  include  support  for  metadata  including  digital signatures; watermarking  to identify proprietary  content in both software and the build  is included in the  roadmap of future features to be added in AMF.  After the CAD file has been converted to STL, AMF,  or 3MF, the software representation of the desired part  to  be  built  is  often  converted  to  G- code,  or  a  machine-  specific variant of G- code, which derives from the world of  computer- controlled  machine  tools.   Some  technologies  use a different software translation to drive the printer  head.  This language tells the laser, build platform, and  other components how to operate to build the shape that  has been specified.  All  of  these  software  steps,  along  with  close  moni- toring  of  the  actual  build,  can  generate  significant  data  volumes. According to one research paper,13 data was gen- erated at eleven steps:  1.  CAD modeling.  2.  STL generation.  3.  STL fixing.  38     chapter 2   4.  Support structure generation.  5.  Toolpath generation.  6.  Numerical modeling.  7.  Additive manufacturing machine software.  8.  In- situ sensing.  9.  Nondestructive inspection.  10.  Post- processing.  11.  Data analysis.  The author later said it was easily possible to generate a  terabyte of data per additively manufactured part across  forty different file formats. Information management is  clearly an emerging area of concern as the technology goes  mainstream.  Art and Science  While  some  characterizations  of  the  technology  might  suggest  that  3D  printing  is  a  matter  of  designing  a  part,  choosing  a  material,  getting  access  to  a  machine,  and  pushing  a  button,  its  reality  is  more  complex.  Post-  processing, sometimes extensive, may be required, as we      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      39   will  see  below.  Primarily  in  metal- melting  scenarios  but  also in plastic, intense heat can cause unintended things  to happen to previously built layers, so care must be taken  in planning and executing the build.  In the design phase, engineers have many details to  attend to, many of them related to managing the effects  of  heat.  For  example,  anyone  familiar  with  welding  will  recognize the “potato chip” curling of sheet steel that is  overheated. Given how much the physics and chemistry  of  additive  manufacturing  in  metal  share  with  welding,  many  concerns  carry  over.  Getting  the  design  axis  and  build plan correct usually involves a steep learning curve,  particularly when a cluster of small and possibly unrelated  parts are pooled into a single build.  Because of the layer- by- layer process of building up a  shape, support structures are particularly important. In  regard to gravity, certain geometries must have a form of  scaffolding or other splinting to be able to “grow” without  sagging or becoming stressed before a joint is sufficiently  strong. The capital letter Y, if 3D printed in polymers, gen- erally does not require support for the two upper forks,  while a capital T and most capital Hs do require support  structures under the horizontal spans. These are removed  once the output is cured.14 In addition to gravity, support  structures help manage heat, often serving to alleviate re- sidual stress  sometimes by serving as a heat sink in metal  builds, for example .  40     chapter 2   The  use  of  support  structures  has  evolved  over  the  past  twenty  years  or  so,  leading  to  a  set  of  design  prin- ciples for practitioners to follow. How much production  time do the support structures require? How much pow- der or filament must be budgeted to build nonfunctional  aspects that will be milled or dissolved away? How will the  support structures be designed to be removed, minimizing  surface damage and possible structural weakening? Many  of these design rules are instantiated in software  such as  Magics and Netfabb mentioned above  but opportunities  remain for the engineer or machine operator to tweak the  generic parameters.15  In  the  build  plan,  designers  must  consider  that  ma- terial strength in the z axis  the height created through  adding layers of material  is generally weaker than in x or  y. Sometimes items are built at a 45- degree angle to reduce  the vulnerability to failure across this axis. At the same  time, the support structures needed to position the build  can be extensive, and removing them can leave surface de- formities. Also, the support structures that are discarded  will increase the cost of powder material consumed: with  some shapes, more support material might be used than  the  section  they  are  supporting.  Given  that  they  are  of- ten  algorithmically  generated,  support  structures  can  take  on  complex  and  aesthetically  pleasing  designs   see  figure 2.1 . Build orientation also affects surface quality  in  the  form  of  the  staircase  effect  resulting  from  layers      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      41   Figure 2.1  The Belgian design firm Unfold used support structures as an  aesthetic element in its Skafaldo Bowl, glass & bronze, in collaboration with  Materialise.

In the end, the build orientation  choice  must  balance  material  strength,  surface  quality,  cost, build time  more layers generally take longer , and  other considerations.  After  the  design  stage,  machine  operators,  sometimes  aided by cameras and other sensors in the build chamber,   Building  42     chapter 2   need to watch for several types of build failures. The tech- nology  for  these  sensors  is  rapidly  improving,  but  the  technical  demands  are  substantial:  build  chambers  can  get extremely hot, the energy levels at the point of metal  fusion can be intense, and the data must be captured at a  high frequency. Getting data- savvy talent to analyze these  sensor feeds is a further issue, given the vast shortage of  capable  people  to  handle  “big  data”  in  everything  from  biostatistics to advertising placement.  Build  errors  are  more  common  in  metal,  but  not  unique to that class of materials. Because knowledge of  how to avoid these errors is hard earned and a competi- tive advantage, little of it is being shared, which is slowing  the pace of overall progress.16 Many parameters must be  set and monitored during production. Some metal- based  additive  technologies  occur  in  an  environment  of  inert  gas  for  both  safety  and  quality  reasons.  Getting  all  the  settings right involves considerable trial and error: for ex- ample, according to Yang and colleagues, “The optimum  process parameters for an Inconel 718 turbine blade fab- ricated on an EOS M270 platform may not result in best  fabrication qualities in a newer EOS M290 platform due  to the improved inert gas flow control in the later system  even  though  both  are  developed  by  the  same  manufac- turer.”17 The angles of the printer head and or the laser  are sometimes adjustable, as is the tracing pattern of the  print head over the build.     FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      43   Specific design decisions and settings during the build   can affect many aspects of the final part.  Surface Finish Surface smoothness can come from several sources. In di- rected energy deposition  DED , parts are overbuilt and  then milled down to spec. In powder- bed methods, smaller  sizes of metal grains and the lower thickness of the indi- vidual build layers contribute to surface smoothness, but  both  increase  build  time  and  cost.  This  balancing  act  is  less critical than others because post- processing is gener- ally  required  and  can  smooth  most  3D  printed  surfaces  relatively easily.  Material Density Many variables affect the presence or lack of cavities in  the desired solid metal structure. Gas pockets in the pow- der feedstock can cause voids in the build, though this is  relatively rare. Metal powder also needs to be sufficiently  fine for the necessary precision of the feature being built  and packed to the proper density in the chamber. If the  laser is not sufficiently powerful, the metal may not fuse,  much like a cold solder joint. In the other direction, too  much power in the beam can spatter molten metal into  adjacent areas. Labs and production facilities are learning  a lot about maintaining adequate material density, includ- ing  the  use  of  hot  isostatic  pressing  in  post- processing,   44     chapter 2   shaping the laser, varying the powder grain size, and so  on. Especially in parts subject to fatigue from cyclic  rather  than  static   loads,  adequate  material  density  is  an  abso- lute necessity.18  Residual Stress As materials heat and cool, they expand and contract. The  stresses  of  these  cycles  can  exceed  the  tensile  strength  of the build, resulting in a variety of defects. Sometimes  support  structures  are  included  to  account  for  these  stresses,  but  those  then  need  to  be  removed  in  post-  processing,  and  the  removal  comes  with  its  own  risks  of  damaging  the  part.  Pre- processing  software  such  as  Magics  mentioned above  can help avoid some of these  stresses, as can various strategies for planning laser scans  during the fusing of each layer. Building a mirror image  of the shape being built on the opposite axis can equalize  stresses.  In  post- processing,  heat- treating  can  also  play   a role.  Absent these countermeasures, metal builds can crack   especially in the early stages of getting accustomed to a  new alloy , warp, and or delaminate. Another set of con- straints relates to strength versus surface smoothness: in  tests involving FDM, lower extruder temperatures mini- mized surface roughness but also lowered the interlayer  bond  strength  and  thus  the  overall  performance  of  the  completed part. The conclusions pointed to a complex set      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      45   of  trade- offs:  for  every  set  of  parameters  that  was  opti- mized for one property, other properties typically suffered.  Build  speed,  surface  quality,  material  cost,  overall  part  strength, particular feature strength  overhangs, curved  surfaces,  joints — none  of  these  comes  without  a  cost  somewhere else.19  Long- Term Performance The  long- term  behavior  of  additively  produced  metal  is  not  yet  well  documented  or  understood.  These  metals’  grain structure, material consistency  that is, lack of un- melted powder and impurities , and overall density  lack  of  pores  and  other  voids   cannot  always  be  determined  through  nondestructive  means.  Furthermore,  and  more  important,  it  is  not  yet  known  how  metal  fatigue  will  emerge after multiple cycles of mechanical loading. These  cycles could be measured in hundreds of revolutions per  minute  or  seasonally,  as  in  a  bridge  beam.  Given  that  what is known as high- cycle fatigue occurs after millions  or  possibly  hundreds  of  millions  of  cycles,  the  current  base  of  experience  is  limited.  Because  the  thermal  his- tory  of  an  additively  manufactured  part  is  so  different  from that of a conventionally machined item, attention  is now being paid to the build process  for instance, the  rate of cooling  with an eye toward improving long- term  durability and, more important, predictability with regard   to failure.20  46     chapter 2   Post- processing  Very rarely does a 3D- printed part come out of the printer  ready for installation. The entire field of post- processing  is  evolving  to  include  many  techniques,  ranging  from  compressed- air  removal  of  powder  to  heat- treatment,  such that the design of the part now potentially includes  many steps after the item leaves the printer. Such a messy  reality is at odds with the “printing” metaphor in which  few of us have to do anything to the paper after it gets ink  or toner applied to it in a home or office.  In fact, the practice of post- processing is very much in  keeping with the workings of a factory or machine shop.  Anything done to a printed part— curing, polishing, mill- ing— is done to conventionally manufactured parts. Plas- tics can get coated in metal, metals get coated in polymers.  Mounting holes are drilled, screw threads tapped, metals  strengthened  through  various  processes.  The  fact  that  post- processing is getting the same attention in additive  manufacturing  as  it  does  elsewhere  in  the  industrial  fa- cility is a signal that additive technologies are being fully  integrated into the workflow of designers and engineers. Machine makers are responding as well. Beginning in  2013,  a  generation  of  hybrid  additive  +  subtractive  ma- chine tools has come to market from various vendors in- cluding Germany’s Hamuel, Mazak from the United States,  and  Germany’s  ELB.  The  German- Japanese  DMG  Mori      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      47   sells  a  six- function  integrated  machine  for  high- speed  milling + 3D scanning + laser cladding [DED] + 3D inspec- tion + deburring polishing + laser marking. A key player is  Hybrid Manufacturing Technologies, based in the United  States, which partners with machine- tool manufacturers  to  implement  its  Ambit  system  of  additive,  subtractive,  and inspection tool heads on traditional CNC equipment.  The  integration  of  additive  and  subtractive  capabilities,  along with measurement and validation, in one physical  unit  opens  the  way  toward  more  complex  process  steps  and newly available properties and geometries of parts.  Greg Morris, now a key figure at GE Additive, points  out that because post- processing can be even more criti- cal to the performance of a 3D- printed part than the ac- tual build is, engineers are learning to design for an entire  production  path  in  which  the  additive  build  is  but  one  step. In regard to metal parts, he lists a whole sequence of  considerations.21  1.  What will the final surface finish require? If there  is milling, designers may need to add material in the  build so it can be removed with the part still within its  specified parameters.  2.  How will the support structures be implemented?  They might be moving heat, or supporting a horizontal  aspect from sagging, or anchoring a build to a build   48     chapter 2   platform, so their placement is critical. In addition,  support structures need to be removed with minimal  damage to the primary part and, to the extent possible,  minimal wasted material.  3.  Every metal alloy has its own idiosyncrasies, so  experience with builds in one metal does not guarantee  a successful recipe for dealing with a near neighbor,  chemically speaking. This applies particularly to  orientation, clearances, and spacing of multiple parts on  a single build.  4.  After the build, the part must be cleaned. One of the  advantages of additive manufacturing is the ability to  create interior channels or other voids, but doing so can  raise challenges in the cleaning phase: getting unmelted  or partially melted powder out of an interior void can be  complicated, and there are firms specializing in this one  problem. Also, unmelted powders can pose health and  safety issues for the personnel who dislodge them.  5.  Thermal treatment of metal parts is common. This  requires expertise in several domains, whether to relieve  stresses introduced in the build stage  see above , to  “cure” micro- cracks  typically via hot isostatic pressing ,  or to strengthen, harden, or increase homogeneity of  materials. As in conventional metalworking, thermal  processing will usually alter the grain structure of the      FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      49   metal and thus change some mechanical properties of  the part.  6.  Deciding when and how to remove support structures  requires expertise. Sophisticated techniques  including  electrical discharge machining  or everyday machine  tools  such as a band saw  may be involved, as may CNC  machines.  7.  Once support structures are removed and the part  is close to its final shape and size, surface treatment  of metal parts is common. Mechanical action via shot-  peening, media blasting, tumbling, and the like may be  combined with chemical treatments. Determining how  much of which tool to use requires experience with the  particular build technology as well as knowledge of the  end purpose of the part.  8.  The final step in metal additive manufacturing is  inspection. Because metal built up by layers differs from  cast or forged metal, the techniques of inspection often  vary. Nondestructive testing  NDT , for example, can  involve the use of fluorescent penetrant inspection  FPI ,  which is used on nonporous metals to check for defects  without affecting the mechanical integrity of the part  under inspection. FPI, however, can show additively  manufactured parts to be flawed when in fact the layers  are not cracks but simply artifacts of the production   50     chapter 2   process. Similarly, statistical process controls are being  adapted to account for the different measured qualities  characteristic of 3D printed parts. In addition to NDT,  different types of light may be used, for example, as  might CT scanning machines adapted from their more  common medical uses. Measuring the strength and  actual dimensions can involve sophisticated instruments,  or simple rulers and calipers. Challenges to inspection  can arise because of the design freedom afforded by  additive manufacturing engineers can specify complex  geometries beyond the capability of conventional  manufacturing, which means that test instrumentation  and quality monitoring of these geometries are often not  yet automated or standardized.  In  polymers,  post- processing  works  slightly  differ- ently.  Support  structures  are  more  typically  supporting  horizontal  elements  such  as  overhangs  than  providing  thermal relief as in metals. In both cases, removing sup- port structures usually damages cosmetic aspects of the  build. Joining two plastic pieces into a structure too large  for a build chamber is accomplished with a cold weld: ac- etone can fuse ABS plastic parts together. Abrasives and  fillers are used in metals as well as polymers, as are polish- ing, plating, and or painting. Polymers can be smoothed  in a chamber filled with acetone vapor: the resulting sur- face can look polished.     FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      51   Talent  All of these powders, filaments, and fabrication machines  will stand idle without an adequately trained workforce.  Although  efforts  are  underway,  there  are  shortfalls  all  though  the  product  life  cycle:  machine  manufacturers  need knowledgeable sales forces; production firms need  designers,  machine  operators,  and  inspectors;  service  bureaus  need  informed  clients  to  request  their  services.  The breadth and depth of knowledge required to make 3D  printing profitable is one reason for the sometimes slow  adoption. We will return to this issue in chapter 6.  Shop Floor Integration  As the discussion of post- processing illustrates, additive  techniques  rarely  stand  alone  in  a  modern  factory,  but  designing workflows around the design capabilities, cycle  times, and skill requirements of a 3D printer is still in its  early stages. One key component of this exercise is cost  optimization:  knowing  the  break- even  point  where  con- ventional manufacturing methods take over for additive  prototype- like  economics  is  often  deceptively  difficult.  New project software features and the growing base of ex- perience with 3D printing both help address this shortfall,  but it will be many years until additive manufacturing is   52     chapter 2   routinely  specified  and  utilized  with  clear  visibility  into  all of the associated constraints, costs, benefits, and risks.  Conclusion  We have seen how a variety of software applications, de- sign  and  manufacturing  expertise,  material  handling,  capital investment, and sometimes significant operating  expenses all come together to make an additively manu- factured build. Nearly all of these contributing elements  are in the early stages of the learning curve, with much  still to be discovered and optimized. It is now time to cata- log, at a high level, the basic types of 3D printing technolo- gies that have emerged over the past thirty- plus years.     FrOM caD  Or  reaLItY  t O reaLItY      53    3  THE EVOLUTION OF AN IDEA: A  BRIEF TYPOLOGY OF 3D PRINTING  Additive manufacturing can be construed quite broadly, but  the core elements include controlled fusing of material s   under computer control. Beginning in the 1980s, the field  has expanded into many materials, being fused with a va- riety of techniques, resulting in builds with many different  characteristics. From the earliest days, 3D printing as a  field has evolved in many directions:     Better materials  from an engineering standpoint :  tougher, stronger, lighter.     Scale, both smaller to nano- scale assembly and larger,  to include large airplanes and buildings.     Resolution, as the units of deposition get more precise.     Price performance.      Domains, from prototype parts to food, structures, and  living tissue.  Even  given  innovations  in  the  2014– 2018  period,  much  remains  constant.  Three  basic  technologies  domi- nate the general market: toothpaste- tube- like extrusion,  vat- based  solidification  of  light- sensitive  polymers,  and  powder- bed  methods  using  adhesive  binders,  heat,  and  light or electron beams to shape plastics and metals. La- sers can be involved, but are not necessarily required. Heat  is often a component of the process, either before fusing,  at the moment of melting or near- melting, and in ovens  after building for various types of heat- treating. Regard- less of the medium— powder, filament, wire, gel, liquids,  aerosols, cells, concrete— the constant factor is computer  control  of  the  deposition  process.  3D  printing  is  essen- tially a branch of robotics.  As of 2012, the ISO ASTM standard 52900 specified  the terminology for additive manufacturing. Even as this  apparent standardization was underway, however, printer  manufacturers continued to blur the lines between addi- tive and subtractive technologies  as a new generation of  hybrid  machines  came  to  market   and  between  the  cat- egories of addition. The most visible example of the latter  boundary- crossing  is  HP’s  Multi  Jet  Fusion  technology,  which  touches  on  as  many  as  four  of  the  canonical  cat- egories.1 The ISO ASTM model still has utility, however.   56     chapter 3   Seven  primary  additive  technologies  were  named,  some  of which have manufacturer- specific variants.2 They are  as follows:  Vat Photopolymerization  Variant 1: Stereolithography Apparatus  SLA  SLA  was  a  pioneering  technology,  patented  in  1986  by  Charles Hull and brought to market in 1988 by his com- pany, 3D Systems, which remains a leader in the field. It  was the first of a class of additive technologies to build  parts  in  a  liquid  medium  of  photo- curable  resin  using  light   often  in  the  UV  spectrum,  sometimes  from  a  la- ser , with successive thin layers of material being added  on  top  of  each  other.  The  primary  advantages  of  SLA   are 1  that it can be run unattended, 2  the wide range of  build  volumes,  3   the  accuracy  of  the  build   it  is  widely  used  in  dental  applications   combined  with  4   the  high  quality  of  surface  finish,  and  5   the  wide  range  of  avail- able materials. SLA has the downsides of requiring post-  curing  in  some  cases,  and  requiring  post- processing  that  adds  time  and  tediousness,  especially  when  such  work  has  the  potential  to  damage  the  build.  SLA  is  dif- ficult to adapt for use as a multi- material method. Photo-  curable  resins  can  also  be  expensive  compared  to  other   alternatives.     the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     57   Variant 2: Continuous Direct Light Processing  CDLP  While SLA is well established, it has recently been joined  by a new innovation using the same basic principles. CDLP   also known as CLIP: continuous liquid interface produc- tion at Carbon, a young company launched in 2014 that  pioneered the technology  behaves similarly to SLA: light  interacts with a liquid polymer layer by layer. As in some  SLA printers, direct light processing flashes an entire layer  at  once  rather  than  tracing  the  shape  path- wise  with  a   laser. CLIP enjoys a speed advantage related to its bottom-  up printing path combined with a proprietary light-  and  oxygen- permeable window at the bottom of the vat. This  innovation  removes  the  necessity  of  repeatedly  separat- ing  freshly  built  layers  from  the  bottom  window,  as  in  other SLA bottom- up printers.3 Many different kinds of  resins  can  be  used.  Advantages  include  high  speed  rela- tive to other additive methods, fine details, and a smooth  surface finish. Disadvantages include brittleness in some  produced builds, and uncertainty with regard to Carbon’s  business model of not transferring ownership of the print- ers to customers.  Another variation of light- cured polymers is used in  what  is  known  as  2  photon  polymerization.  It  can  gen- erate  nano- scale  features  with  layer  thickness  as  small   as  0.1  micron.  The  resulting  structures   including  cell  scaffolds, as we will see in chapter 7  are used in optical,  life- science, and other highly precise environments.

Material Extrusion  Fused Filament Fabrication  FFF   Generic  or Fused  Deposition Modeling  FDM , a Stratasys Trademark Introduced just after SLA, FDM was developed in the late  1980s and brought to market in 1992. A leading vendor of  these machines is Stratasys of the United States. It uses an  extrusion process fed by a filament of nylon, ABS, or other  plastics to build both prototypes to test for fit, feel, and      the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     59   other attributes, as well as production products. Certain  FFF machines use two print heads, one with the primary  structure’s material and another with a release material  that is used to build support structures that are removed  upon completion of the overall piece. Material flowing out  of the print head assumes an oval profile as gravity takes  hold, meaning that there are small but visible valleys be- tween layers of material.  Heat is applied to the filament at the print head, and  the  resulting  semiliquid  state  allows  the  material  to  be  deposited in thin layers. FFF is able to create production  parts  85  percent  as  strong  as  molded  pieces,  can  build  overhangs with integral but temporary support, supports  multi- material builds with simple filament changes, and  features relatively large build envelopes at the high end  of the available product range. Downsides include limita- tions on the accuracy and available precision  which are a  function of the fixed filament thickness , and shrinkage  in  the  final  work  product  that  is  both  common  and  un- predictable. It is important to recognize FFF is subject to  anisotropy  the varying properties of an item that are a  function of its orientation and direction : the strength of  a finished part is a function of the strength of the bonds  between  layers  rather  than  of  the  build  material  itself.4  Thermal  and often humidity  control of an FFF build is  also important to prevent warping from differential cool- ing rates across different axes of the build.  60     chapter 3   Often an FFF part will have an interior structure that  intentionally has voids. This infill reduces both consump- tion of filament and build time. Ten percent infill is used if  a part is being prototyped for fit, for example, 20 percent  is a common build tradeoff, and 80 percent infill is used to  maximize strength. Many infill patterns are available, and  control over their density and other parameters is often  left to the designer.5  Both industrial and most home 3D printers fall into  this category. Other variants of material extrusion deposit  liquids or slurries rather than melted thermoplastic.  An  example is robocasting, which uses a ceramic slurry that  does not usually require support structures because the  material sets up rapidly.6  Some of the often experimen- tal machines that layer ceramics, composites, metal- filled  clays, electronic circuits, concrete, food, and living cells in  a hydrogel suspension use the same basic technology but  will not be discussed here.7  Two major advancements on extrusion- based printing,  both at MIT spinouts, bear mention. First, MarkForged  initially focused on impregnating polymer filament with  chopped  carbon  fiber,  which  reduced  weight,  increased   stability,  and  improved  strength  of  the  printed  items.  More recently, the firm separated the sintering oven from  the  build  chamber  and  uses  polymer  filaments  infused  with metal to feed the extruder.  Sintering is a post-pro- cessing step in which heat bakes off impurities and in this      the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     61   case shrinks the built part to size; it refers to the heating  [sometimes with a laser] of particles to a jelly-like state  where  they  fuse  without  melting.   Workplace  safety  is  dramatically improved: material handling in powder- bed  systems can be dangerous and requires extensive precau- tions.8 Second, Desktop Metal is attempting to bring metal  3D printing to office spaces and other environments that  lack  safety  hoods,  advanced  fire  suppression,  and  other  industrial  features.  No  lasers  or  powders  are  involved;  rather, metal rods bound with a wax and polymer interface  material are extruded to build up the near- net shape. The  build is then moved to a second machine called a debinder,  where the proprietary interface material is removed. Then  the  build  moves  to  the  sintering  furnace  where  further  binder is removed and the metal consolidates to its final  density, in the 96 to 99.8 percent range.9  Both  companies’  metal  printers  are  just  coming  to  market in 2018 but bear watching as yet another blurring  of the ISO ASTM categorization.  Powder- Bed Fusion  Beginning in the early 1990s, 3D printing expanded from  thermoplastic and photosensitive resins to metal fabrica- tion. Early interest was shown by aerospace and defense  contractors.  Until  recently,  the  filament  model  did  not   62     chapter 3   Table 3.2  Extrusion  Fused Filament Fabrication   Method of binding  Selected materials  Layer thickness  Thermal heat  Thermoplastic filament  .127– .5 mm  Support structures required?  Yes  Selected vendors  MakerBot, Stratasys  Advantages  Limitations  Low cost, widely available  Build chamber size limit, low resolution  apply to metals. Instead, all powder- bed techniques begin  with a bin of powder  either thermoplastic or metal  that  is  heated  to  near  the  material’s  melting  point  then  sub- jected  to  a  beam  of  powerful  energy.  The  particles  fuse,  the  build  platform  is  lowered  precisely,  and  a  new  layer   fractions of a millimeter thick  of powder is spread over  the top of the bin, usually with a wiper. The process is then  repeated, with each layer representing a slice of the CAD  drawing that has been translated into software driving the  print head. The unsintered powder supports the build as  it takes shape and often can be recycled. Both during and  after the build, a carefully managed cooling process is criti- cal to help prevent warping and other thermal distortions.  Furthermore, careful handling of the powder feedstock is  essential for health and safety reasons.     the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     63   Variant 1: Selective Laser Sintering  SLS , Direct Metal  Laser Sintering  DMLS , Selective Laser Melting  SLM  SLS technology was developed in the late 1980s and the  first commercial machine was shipped in 1992. Both EOS   formally  Electro  Optical  Systems   of  Germany  and  3D  Systems in the US manufacture these machines. It uses  a  bed  of  powder  both  as  feedstock  and  support  for  the  build.  SLS refers to the fusing of plastics, glass, and ce- ramics.  DMLS  refers  to  metalworking  machines,  which  constitute the largest installed base of any metal- capable  additive technology. SLM is similar but works only with  pure  metals  with  a  single  melting  point.  The  latter  two  will  be  grouped  together  for  simplicity.   Both  polymer-    and metal- capable technologies build structures that are  self- supporting, opening the way to complex internal ge- ometries. Hollow ducting can be precisely engineered and  rendered,  for  example.  The  advantages  of  powder- bed   fusion systems include precision and strength of finished  parts  as with dental and orthopedic appliances , the flex- ibility  of  many  available  materials,  the  lack  of  support  pieces for overhangs and the like, and no need for post-  build  curing.  Powdered  metal  is  considerably  more  ex- pensive than solid stock: one stainless steel variant costs  up to $450 per kilogram, five to ten times the cost of bar  stock. Other downsides include high power consumption,  the need for measures to relieve thermal stress that might   64     chapter 3   Table 3.3  Method of binding  Powder bed?

The recommended  space required for the machine cited above, costing more  than $250,000, is 15′ × 15′ × 9′.  Variant 2: Electron Beam Melting  EBM  EBM  technology  was  developed  later  in  the  1990s,  was  commercialized in 2001, and uses electrons rather than  the photons to heat the powder. A leading vendor of these      the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     65   Powdered metal is  considerably more  expensive than solid  stock: one stainless steel  variant costs up to   $450 per kilogram.   systems is Arcam, out of Sweden, now part of GE. A large  build envelope is in the 10′′ × 10′′ × 15′′ range; it is housed  in a machine roughly 6.5′ × 3.5′ × 8′ weighing about 3,500  pounds. Successive layers of preheated metal powder, each  roughly 0.0004 inches  10 microns  thick, are melted in a  vacuum under the direction of a computer interpreting the  build file. After each layer is complete, the build platform  is lowered, a thin layer of new powder applied, and the  process repeated. As with DMLS and SLM, parts are built  up from a solid metal base plate and must be separated   after  the  build  cools,  typically  with  a  cutting  tool.  Ad- vantages of EBM include the absence of voids and high  strength of the finished product, high accuracy  including  limited shrinkage , medium levels of surface finish, and  relatively  rapid  build  speed.  The  downsides  include  the  need  to  work  only  with  conductive  materials,  relatively  large minimum feature size  typically 0.1 mm , the com- plexity  and  criticality  of  maintaining  the  vacuum  cham- ber— in  part  to  limit  gamma  ray  radiation— and  high   power consumption.  Sheet Lamination  Sheet lamination is exactly what the name suggests: suc- cessive layers of paper, plastic, foil, or other flat materi- als  are  cut  with  great  precision  either  with  a  blade  or  a      the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     67   Table 3.4  Powder bed?

For the most part, the process  produces  aesthetically  pleasing  builds  that  can  be  used  as  architectural  models,  for  example,  but  lack  strength  for use as functional parts. The company that pioneered  the technology  Helisys  has exited the market, but such  vendors as Cubic and Mcor are still active. Fabrisonic uses  sheet  lamination  to  join  metal  foils  via  ultrasonic  weld- ing; some systems include CNC machine tools built into  the overall unit, and the company claims build envelopes  up  to  six  feet  square.  Sheet  lamination  is  used  mainly  in  niche  applications  such  as  architectural  models  built   from paper.  68     chapter 3   Binder Jetting  Binder  jetting  technology  dates  to  the  early  1990s  and  was patented as “3D printing.” Leading vendors include  ExOne for metals, and 3D Systems and Voxeljet for sand,  gypsum,  and  other  materials.  The  process  joins  powder  with adhesive binders rather than heat; the potential com- binations of binders and materials  which can range from  chalk  to  metal   are  quite  extensive.  Further,  the  lack  of  a need for heat in the fabrication phase can open larger  build  volumes,  and  warping  and  shrinkage  are  minimal,  even  in  large  metal  parts,  except  when  post- production  infiltration or sintering are performed. Binder jetting has  also been used for sand molds  to receive molten steel  in  the 70′′ × 40′′ × 16′′ range. Direct printing of sand molds  with complex features is a key use of the technology, at  multiple size ranges.  After  layer- by- layer  fabrication,  which  can  include  secondary material such as color from an additional print  head, the part can be sintered in a furnace, which also burns  off the binder. Molten bronze or other infiltrants can fill  voids via capillary action, if necessary, to obtain full ma- terial density; isostatic pressure can also be employed to  increase densities in metal builds. The technology is often  used in aesthetic applications such as architectural models,  packaging, and ergonomic verification.

The  technol- ogy’s downsides include the large size of the fabrication  machinery,  and  the  limited  strength  and  other  mate- rial  properties  of  finished  parts  relative  to  powder- bed   methods.  70     chapter 3   Material Jetting  Material jetting, commercialized in Solidscape, Stratasys  PolyJet,  and  3D  Systems  MultiJet  machines,  uses  hun- dreds of tiny nozzles to spray layers of liquid photopoly- mer  in the case of Solidscape, wax for investment castings,  which is not cured  onto a build tray, where they are cured  and  solidified  with  ultraviolet  light.  Support  structures  are  fabricated  of  a  dissolvable  material  that  is  removed  during post- processing. A typical build size is 15′′ × 10′′  ×  8′′.  A  wide  range  of  materials  can  be  used,  and  multi-  material  fabrication  is  possible,  but  resin  cartridges  are  usually proprietary and expensive, costing up to $1,000  per kilogram. Because builds are solid rather than infilled  with lattice, material usage is higher than with FDM or  SLA, raising costs further. Medical models are one appli- cation of this capability: nerves, veins, arteries, and so on  can be rendered in different colors, or built of transparent   or selectively transparent  materials.  More  recently,  electrically  conductive  nanoparticles  have  been  embedded  in  the  polymers,  and  a  company  called Nano Dimension is commercializing the ability to  3D print electronic circuit boards for rapid prototyping.10  Optomec’s aerosol jetting allows circuit elements  such as  resistors, conductors, and semiconductors  to be printed  on  a  variety  of  substrates.11  Elsewhere,  the  Israeli  firm  XJet has taken material jetting to the nano scale  using      the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     71   heat rather than light for binding metal- impregnated liq- uid  for both ceramics and metals, opening new markets  for additively produced structures.12 As with MarkForged  and Desktop Metal, XJet’s treatment of metal feedstock  avoids  many  of  the  safety  considerations  required  in  powder- bed systems.  Advantages  of  material  jetting  include  extreme  de- sign  flexibility  given  multi- material  and  full  color  capa- bility, smooth surfaces comparable to those produced by  injection molding  the layer height can be as small as 16  microns , and thus very accurate visual and haptic proto- types.  Production  parts  are  not  commonly  produced  in  this  fashion.  Because  the  build  does  not  undergo  sharp  thermal transitions, warping and shrinkage immediately  after  the  build  are  minimal.  The  downsides  include  the  high cost of the technology, the fact that material jetted  parts are photosensitive and thus degrade over time, and  poor  mechanical  strength.  Post- processing  is  usually  fo- cused on dissolving the support structures, minimal sand- ing, and the application of various coatings.  Directed Energy Deposition  In the late 1990s, researchers at Sandia National Labora- tories were able to fuse metal with a laser outside a powder  bed, and the technique was commercialized in the United   72     chapter 3   Table 3.6  Method of binding  Selected materials  Layer thickness  Selected vendors  Advantages  Limitations  Support structures required?

The technique is  known  under  a  number  of  names  including  laser  engi- neered net shaping  Optomec’s LENS , direct metal depo- sition, and 3D laser cladding. Metal powder or wire is fed  onto a surface  either a piece being repaired or an irregu- larly shaped new build  and melted with a laser or electron  beam. The technology has the advantages of larger build  envelopes  than  powder  beds  can  accommodate  and  the  cost savings of creating or repairing expensive, complex  metal structures: the layers can be deposited freeform on  curved or irregular surfaces rather than only on a planar  build platform. Downsides include a limited installed base,  limited  number  of  available  materials   including  some  plastics and ceramics , and a rough surface texture that  typically requires post- processing.     the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     73   Method of binding  Laser or electron beam  Support structures required?

Selected metals  Layer thickness  Selected vendors  Advantages  Limitations  HP’s Big Move  A major change came to the 3D printing market after 2014,  when  HP  introduced  first  multi- material  and  then   in  2018  metal- based additive technology. Claimed to rely on  5,000 HP patents, the company’s Multi Jet polymer tech- nology  combines  elements  of  other  techniques:  binder  jetting, material jetting, and powder- bed fusion. Like SLS,  Multi Jet is a powder- based technique, but no lasers are in- volved. Instead  similar to binder jetting , a fusing agent is  jetted in combination with thermal heat to melt particles,  and a detailing agent is used at object contours to improve  part resolution through a similar melting process aimed at   74     chapter 3   surface quality rather than strength. The resulting parts  are claimed to be built up to ten times faster and 65 per- cent less expensive, per part, than FDM or SLS done in  industrial- grade machines.13 Furthermore, HP has taken a  systems perspective on additive manufacturing, address- ing the process from end to end. HP’s solution begins with  computer data formats, includes in- process quality moni- toring and control, establishes an open- source community  model  for  new  material  identification  and  commercial- ization, and integrates a cooling chamber on the printer  chassis to increase speed still further. In addition, HP has  instantiated an integrated model for packaging, workflow,  and reuse practices related to powder handling.  HP is a large firm in a small market: its market capi- talization of roughly $36 billion in 2018 dwarfed those of  Stratasys  barely $1 billion , EOS  privately held; revenues  in the 500 million euro range , or 3D Systems  roughly $1  billion . After its investments in Arcam and Concept La- ser, GE has become the other major player in the market.  HP’s scale and aggressively comprehensive approach will  bear watching, as will its ability to partner with similarly  large global players. A major announcement relative to an  expansion  into  metal- based  printing  in  2018  further  re- set the market. Now that additive manufacturing has the  backing of two multibillion- dollar firms, we should expect  major  new  product  introductions  and  possibly  further  mergers of existing players.     the eVOLUtION OF aN IDea     75   Conclusion  Heading  into  2020,  3D  printing  is  able  to  precisely  de- posit more materials, at more scales, and faster than ever  before.  Long- standing  problems  around  build  volume,  material- handling  safety,  build  planning,  and  limited  commercial markets appear to be seeing solutions. From  nano- structures to buildings, and from circuity through  biology, the horizons of commercial capability are expand- ing. Despite the relative youth of the field, additive manu- facturing has achieved many successes in both consumer  and industrial markets, and it is to those markets that we  now turn our attention.  76     chapter 3   4  3D PRINTING IN   CONSUMER MARKETS  The 3D printer has not become the household appliance its  most avid enthusiasts predicted in the early 2010s, but it  is making definite inroads into mass markets. While CAD  file  creation  primarily  remains  the  province  of  trained,  skilled technicians, consumer 3D printing has taken off  in schools. Finally, even though most people may not print  their own, 3D printed products are emerging in more mar- kets every year.  Maker Culture  In the past fifteen years or so, there has been a resurgence  of  interest  in  taking  things  apart   and  possibly  voiding  the warranty  as well as in creating things at home or in  school. At a time when shop classes declined in popularity    in US schools, in part because high schools emphasized  pre- college  educations  for  most  students,  a  bottom- up  “maker culture” has emerged. This culture has flourished  for many reasons:     Creating physical products  whether scarves, robots,   or decorative items  creates a sense of accomplishment  that abstract symbolic analysis and manipulation   do not.     PCs have declined in importance as smartphones,  tablets, and other tools have embedded computing in  daily life rather than isolate it in a box on a desktop.     The same impulse that gave rise to hot- rodding cars  in the 1960s and 1970s can find expression not in  automobiles  which are much less amenable to hardware  modification given the number of embedded computer-  controlled systems  but in tinkering with drones, home  brewing, and even life sciences  as at the DIY biosphere1 .     Crowdsourcing and crowdfunding both enable  toolmakers to get their creations to market, and allow  small- scale makers to find audiences for unique products,  as at Etsy.     The open- source software ethos has influenced many  makers to adopt a similar attitude toward hardware  designs and knowledge: readily available plans and advice,   78     chapter 4   often in video form, make it much easier for people to  learn new skills or to be inspired by clever thinking.     Physical instantiations of this culture, whether  in “maker spaces” or at Maker Faires  which can draw  hundreds of thousands of attendees , contribute to the  online vitality of ideas and resources.  Dale Dougherty cofounded O’Reilly Media  a leading  publisher of technical manuals for web and open- source  software ,  founded  Make  magazine,  and  launched  the  Maker Faires. He speaks of making as an essential human  trait:  everyone  who  cooks,  knits,  or  gardens  is  a  maker,  in his view, but there is a historically American variation  that emphasized tinkering. While the ability to construct  a house, fix a car, or sew your own clothes was once a ne- cessity,  he  finds  that  people  “are  finding  their  lives  en- riched by creating something new and learning new skills.”  While  his  magazine  has  helped  create  the  larger  move- ment, maker culture is also a creature of social media. The  internet, in turn, spurs people to connect in real life, to  see what each other has built and to learn how they did it.2 A milestone in desktop 3D printing was the RepRap  project. Launched in 2005 by Adrian Bowyer at the Uni- versity of Bath, RepRap  replicating rapid- prototyper  is  an  open- source  3D  printer  that  is  designed  to  replicate  itself,  that  is,  to  print  the  plastic  parts  of  another  3D      3D printing in consumer markets        79   printer.3 As of 2018, kits were available for $300 and up; a  particularly popular variant by Josef Průša of Prague runs  $599 and was shipping 6,000 units per month in 2018.4  Commercial entities also are free to use the design without  giving back to the community, since the open license does  not legally preclude this behavior.  RepRap  gained  commercial  momentum  in  2007,  and many consumers report that this machine provided  their first exposure to home 3D printers. The community  source  documentation  and  software  have  both  steadily  improved, so the RepRap has become, in its high- end in- carnations,  an  extremely  capable  3D  printer.  The  same  holds true for the entire category: machines costing less  than $1,500 can challenge “professional” machines selling  for two to four times that price, creating a dilemma for  machine manufacturers.  Another open- source project, based in Colorado, origi- nates with Aleph Objects, a company of more than two  hundred people. The LulzBot TAZ 6 is priced at $2,500  a  miniature version costs half as much  but is sophisticated  enough to be used in engineering applications. The full-  size LulzBot has a larger build envelope than most desktop  printers and includes other features aimed at improving  reliability  and  usability.  In  a  market  where  many  manu- facturers lock down software or require proprietary fila- ment powder, the LulzBot runs on open- source software  that can be modified by the user and will never be locked    80     chapter 4   down by the manufacturer; nearly fifty different filaments  from  multiple  sources  were  available  on  the  company’s  website.5  Against this broader backdrop, the emergence of low-  cost,  easy- to- operate  3D  printers  enables  makers  to  do  new things, and it captures sales from individuals, schools,  and other shared resources that seek to inspire STEM edu- cation and to empower individuals to create more of their  own environment. In addition, as people across the world  continue to migrate to cities, the lack of garages and base- ments in apartment and condominium buildings creates  the opportunity for shared spaces  such as TechShop  to  provide access to tools and resources much as a health club  sells  membership  by  the  month  or  by  the  drop- in  visit.  Science technology  museums  are  adopting  the  same  ap- proach for young visitors in some workshops, providing  tools, instruction, and open- ended encouragement rather  than featuring only tightly defined hands- on exhibits that  teach a prespecified lesson.  This infrastructure, both social and physical, is impor- tant. A 3D printer in the home shop or basement is likely  to sit idle after the novelty wears off in many households.  In  a  school  or  maker  space,  however,  that  same  printer  benefits from the community of makers and learners. In  a context of software, measurement instruments, cutting  tools, computers, and people with various needs and ideas,  the  printer  is  set  into  a  larger  creative  and  productive      3D printing in consumer markets        81   milieu where a variety of tools can be utilized in combina- tion to get things done.  O’Reilly  Media  began  publishing  Make  magazine  in  2005, and 3D printing has frequently been featured. The  most notable example was an “ultimate guide to 3D Print- ing” in 2012, and the magazine’s website is regularly up- dated  with  product  comparisons,  sample  projects,  and  other resources. As of early 2018, more than forty models  had been reviewed, at prices ranging from $350 to $4,000.6 What  are  people  actually  making?  No  systematic  answer  appears  to  emerge  from  the  academic  literature.  Make suggested more than one hundred household items  in 2015; many are of dubious usefulness. In part, this lack  of plans reflects the low cost and wide availability of com- mercial molded- plastic items. It will take time for imagina- tion  and, to some extent, design software  to catch up to  the capabilities of the fabrication technology. The Make  survey went room by room through the house: a lemon  squeezer  or  custom  cookie- cutter  for  the  kitchen,  soap  dishes or razor- holders for the bathroom, lots of plastic  game pieces for the rec room, and plastic desktop organiz- ers for the home office.  The  contrast  with  industrial  items  is  instructive.  Manufacturers of additive manufacturing machines were  asked, “How do your customers use the parts built on your  AM  [additive  manufacturing]  systems?”  The  main  an- swers, with percentage of responses:  82     chapter 4   Functional parts, 33.8 percent.  Prototypes for fit and assembly, 16 percent.  Education research, 10.7 percent.  Patterns for metal castings, 8.3 percent.  Patterns for prototype tooling, 7.4 percent.  Tooling components, 7.4 percent.  Visual aids  including designers and medical  professionals , 7.3 percent.  Presentation models  including architectural , 7.1  percent.7  Note  that  functional  parts,  where  many  household  items would fit, is a minority of the usage in engineering  and related settings. Few households need architectural  models, casting molds, or other tooling for mass produc- tion.  This  disconnect  might  help  explain  the  dramatic  slowdown in consumer adoption of 3D printers, and the  capital  markets’  disappointment  in  companies  like  Mak- erBot  now owned by Stratasys . These consumer- facing  companies helped create high expectations in 2014– 2015,  when  the  promise  of  mass  numbers  of  home  printers  drove  valuations  up  to  dizzying  levels.  Now,  things  are  more mundane. John Kawola is North American president      3D printing in consumer markets        83   for 3D printing company Ultimaker. Regarding the early  hype,  he  made  an  apt  comparison:  “Saying  there  would  be 3D printers in every home would be like saying every  home  has  a  sewing  machine.  Just  the  people  who  sew  have sewing machines.” As it turned out, home 3D print- ers have been purchased by savvy, capable enthusiasts, not  the mass market, because it’s still pretty complicated to  translate vision to reality. “There aren’t very many killer  apps for the regular guy to make stuff,” Kawola added.8  One class of home- printed items holds great promise:  broken plastic pieces, whether tent stakes, shower- curtain  hooks, or knobs. Generating prints of these things requires  either  a  good  3D  scanner   currently  costing  anywhere  from less than $100 to more than $50,000  or a digital  file from either the original manufacturer or some other  source.  Intellectual property issues emerge quickly; they  will be discussed in chapter 6 in more detail.  Teenage En- gineering, a Swedish company that sells inexpensive syn- thesizers, began offering replacement parts as CAD files in  2012. If the customer lacks a 3D printer, a company called  Shapeways will print the file, then mail the output.  A  survey  of  consumers  by  the  Get3DSmart  consul- tancy in 2014 produced some revealing sentiments. Over- all, consumer awareness seemed low, which is unsurprising.  The biggest group, 49 percent of those surveyed, replied to  the question “What about 3D printing seems most inter- esting?” by saying that “it helps make products available   84     chapter 4   that might not be otherwise.” This is the so- called “long  tail” at work: much as Netflix  in its DVD days , eBay, and  YouTube have a small number of hits and vast numbers  of  niche-    or  zero-    audience  items  available,  so  too  do  many fans of 3D printing see an escape from retail uni- formity that is necessitated by mass production and mass  marketing. Customization was listed by about a fifth of  respondents, then 16 percent noted “the ability to watch  products being made” as being most interesting. Fourteen  percent cited sustainability. Taken together, these results  fit  in  with  a  growing  resistance  to  mall- based  retail,  a  growing “green” sensibility, and a desire for uniqueness in  one’s personal possessions.9  It  will  be  important  to  differentiate  between  con- sumer demand for 3D printers and for 3D printed goods,  whether medical devices, footwear, decorative items, jew- elry, or whatever. As more production, including custom- ization, moves onto additive platforms, tastes will change  to create more demand for everything from customized  trophies   “Mom,  that’s  me!”   to  better- fitting  shoes  to  custom  car  seats   research  has  shown  that  people  can  be uniquely identified by the pattern of their sitting, so  everyone  theoretically  needs  a  unique  seat .  Predicting  consumer trends is impossible, so trying to guess if there  will be some “killer app,” as they used to be called, that will  drive wider demand for home printers beyond hobbyists  seems futile.     3D printing in consumer markets        85   Compared to the rhetoric of 2012, when some were  comparing 3D printing to the early days of the personal  computer movement,10 with the consumer growth rates  that implied, sales of desktop printers seem to be migrat- ing to enterprise users. These people have the software,  the knowledge, and the stream of work  things that need  to  be  printed  for  design  and  prototyping  purposes   to  sustain the investment. At Ford, engineers have come to  rely on the technology for new vehicle development, with  more  than  100,000  parts  printed  in  2017.11  Production  parts are expected to increase down the line, but the point  here is that desktop printers have a more natural home in  R&D facilities than in most Americans’ garages.  Consumer  products,  however,  seem  like  a  massive  market  waiting  for  production  to  catch  up  to  latent  de- mand. A quick survey around a household reveals multiple  opportunities to improve on mass production:     Handles for everything from toothbrushes to kitchen  knives could be customized for age, arthritis, physical  limitation  including loss of digits , handedness  left  vs right , precision, comfort, and other attributes. The  success of the Oxo GoodGrips franchise is one precedent  here.     Splints for broken fingers, sprained ankles, and the   like could be made from multiple materials  hard where   86     chapter 4   the body is soft, pliable where the body is bony , in  school or other colors, and recycled at the end of use.     Providing replacement knobs for kitchen appliances is  already a thriving niche industry, as at knockoutknobs. com.     Printing household items with built- in Tile12 or similar  tags could mean the end of lost keyrings, lost remote  controls, and lost eyeglasses.     Speaking of glasses, what happens to the worldwide  oligopoly of eyeglass frame manufacturers when lenses,  nosepieces, frames, hinges, and earpieces can be printed  in one integrated pass?     Cleated sport shoes have already been made for elite  athletes using 3D printing. What could happen if open-  source designs bring similar multi- material technology to  the everyday soccer player, with custom- fitting capability,  at lower prices?     Superfeet13 is already printing custom insoles and  Ultimate Ears14 produces custom earpieces for audio  earbuds. How much of everyday life will be improved  when such “invisible” items fit better and don’t produce  discomfort?     Protective equipment, whether a hard hat, bicycle  helmet, shin guard, or earmuff, works best when it fits      3D printing in consumer markets        87   well. Similarly, the entire field of workplace ergonomics  at desks, job sites, and factories could be reinvented.     Toys could be custom- fitted, personalized, and made  more appealing with a wider range of skin tones and  accessories for dolls, personalized game pieces, and fit  options for handheld devices like joysticks. Lego makes  custom Minifigures, but with a minimum order of fifty  pieces; many people want only one or two.  Children and Schools  3D printing is finding its way into many school curricula,  where it can help energize students to consider how the  worlds  of  computing  and  physical  fabrication   art,  man- ufacturing,  craft   intersect.  As  employers  look  ahead,  meanwhile,  they  see  the  need  for  a  digital  manufactur- ing workforce, and many companies have donated money,  expertise, and or materials to help encourage this set of  skills  and  attributes.  To  take  only  one  example,  GE  do- nated printers to more than four hundred schools as part  of a $10 million five- year investment. More than 180,000  students  are  estimated  to  be  affected.  The  donation  in- cludes  a  wind- turbine  simulation  software  package  so  students  can  learn  problem- solving,  team  collaboration,  written and verbal communications, and critical thinking   88     chapter 4   skills in the context of a manufacturing challenge. Seven  countries  are  included:  Canada,  China,  Germany,  India,  Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.15  There  are  many  potential  pedagogical  benefits.  A   number of educators16 have identified a cluster of these:  Art and Making Go Together  The fact that 3D printing  integrates shape, structure, color, and texture moves  it into the world of real- life design, where multiple  disciplines must interact to create a successful outcome.  Students who might not “like art” often enjoy expressing  themselves through a new medium.  Reaching Alternative Learning Styles  Many teachers  report that their most engaged 3D printer users  are students who were on the outside looking in to  traditional methods. In the United Kingdom, it was  reported that “a head teacher working in a challenging  school said that one pupil in particular, who refused not  to swear at teaching staff, became the model pupil when  given access to the Ultimaker2+ because he could see his  ideas coming to life.”17 At least one other school is using  3D printing as a tool to re- engage students who have  dropped out.  Every Subject Can Be Hands On  Biology? Print a heart  or a lung or an extinct species of animal. History? Print  a Roman amphora or Mayan temple. Geology? Mountain      3D printing in consumer markets        89   ranges and rock strata make more sense in three  dimensions. Folklore? What did the hollow look like  before it was flooded to make a lake? Mechanics? How   do motors and transmissions actually work? It’s hard to  find a subject where there isn’t an application.  Making Starts Early  Few families have the financial  and intellectual resources to buy 3D printers, but  many children take to the technology. As opposed to  many STEM curricula, 3D printers connect students  with maker culture, including broader discussions  of intellectual property, tips and techniques, and  collaboration: every maker has at some point been  bootstrapped by another person who provided a timely  tip, tool loan, or helping hand.  Identifying Talent  The technology of 3D printing  allows students who might not excel at traditional  reading, writing, and calculation to find a tool for both  expression  this is what I created  and analysis  this is  what I figured out . Put another way, students get to  create things rather than only consume other people’s  words or ideas.  Teamwork and Collaboration  distinctions between grade levels are minimized by  putting a younger and an older student together to  work on a 3D printing challenge. As science fairs and   In some schools,   90     chapter 4   robot competitions have done for decades, 3D printing  challenges can build school spirit and let a new group  of students who aren’t athletes or spelling champions  emerge and get positive attention.  Address Real World Problems  Scientists and engineers  are typically excited to help students learn about 3D  printing. Rather than making the same chess pieces  or desk organizers as everyone else, adult experts who  interact with students by bringing real challenges to  the classroom can benefit all parties concerned. Getting  adult 3D printing users into the classroom also makes  STEM real in ways that book learning cannot, enhancing  students’ career awareness of technical and engineering-  related fields.  In contrast to a 1960s car   Making Technology Visible  or an electric fan, many modern devices are technological  “black boxes” and thus difficult to understand. Digital  technologies in particular are opaque to many people,  including many computer science majors who have  never touched a CPU or memory. 3D printing is a great  antidote to this tendency, as students can see, layer by  layer, the transformation from mathematical equations  into physical shapes.  Teaching Kids to Fail  Joris Peels is a Dutch pioneer in  3D printing, having worked for many industry startups.      3D printing in consumer markets        91   He makes the excellent point that 3D printing teaches  students that failure is normal and even beneficial.  “When working with kids or even post- graduate young  designers,” he writes, “I’m often taken aback just how  afraid they are of failing, just how much they seek  approval or guidance.” In contrast, “When I work on  designing or making things I try to fail as hard as I can.  This is a key skill.” As with any engineering mindset   rarely able to be taught before college , iteration and  creative problem- solving are their own reward. Peels   puts it very succinctly: the goal is to “learn not to worry  but rather learn to improve.”18 Failing fast has become   a management buzzword, but the idea has merit, and   3D printing can teach students this essential attitude  and skill.  Outcomes  Even with proper curricula, 3D printers  have not been in enough schools for long enough to  do credible studies of effects and outcomes. Thus  far most of the scholarship is speculative, based on  extremely limited samples, or both. For example,  researchers find that students can learn through multiple  pathways  literally, their fingertips  in addition to rote  memorization, reducing students’ “cognitive load when  learning by alleviating working memory constraints.”19  A study of teacher education in Israel may be a harbinger  of changes in student classrooms. According to the   92     chapter 4   authors, “Our ongoing study indicates that the CDIO  [conceive- design- implement- operate] approach can be  applied to balance learning pedagogical fundamentals,  training technological skills, and teaching practice. The  study provides indications that learning activities in the  courses facilitate development of visual literacy skills.”20  It is important to note that those results came when 3D  printing was deployed alongside instruction in design  skills. More of these kinds of insights are needed before  broad classroom deployment can drive measurable  results.  Health and Medicine  Lots of attention is being paid to futuristic applications of  3D printing, such as human tissue, exoskeletons, or skin.  We will address those in chapter 7, but many people are  surprised by the degree to which additive manufacturing  is already well established. Surgical implants are discussed  elsewhere in this book, but two areas of medicine capital- ize on the fact that every human is unique, often across  the two lateral sides: few people’s feet are the same shoe  size, for example.  Dental clinics are using 3D printing to make implants,  whether as small as a single crown or as large as a section  of someone’s head bones. A key development in this trend      3D printing in consumer markets        93   is the development of cone beam computed tomography   CBCT , a new imaging technology invented in Italy and  commercialized  around  the  year  2000.  CBCT  facilitates  the creation of 3D volumetric models that can be passed to  a printer for fabrication. The change has been momentous  for dental labs, many of which have been moving to China.  A skilled artisan can produce about twelve dental crowns  in one day. According to EOS, a German manufacturer of  3D printers, their machines can produce up to 450 crowns  in  that  same  one- day  period.21  In  addition,  3D  printing  frees the skilled prosthetic- makers to do other, more in- volved tasks, such as working with enamel.  As  a  result,  many  dental  offices  have  installed  3D  printers on site, shortening turnaround from weeks  with  physical  molds  and  artisanal  manufacturing   to  a  few  hours.  Additive  technologies  that  create  complex  struc- tures with little waste are teamed with milling tools that  can create high precision connecting surfaces  because of  the higher strength obtainable from a solid pouring , com- bining the best of both worlds.22 In addition, some lower-  cost 3D printing technologies are useful for making guides,  prototypes, or splints  as with some forms of orthodon- tia . In these cases, the material might not be sufficiently  strong for implantation, or it may not be suitable for auto- claving and other sterilization techniques.  Another  major  use  of  additive  techniques  in  den- tistry  occurs  at  Invisalign,  which  is  a  newcomer  to  the   94     chapter 4   Many dental offices  have installed   3D printers on site,  shortening turn- around from weeks   to a few hours.   orthodontic field. The company uses 3D scanning of the  mouth to map out a treatment plan, then prints a new set  of personalized fixtures in which thin plastic is thermo- formed over an additively produced base pattern for each  patient to swap out about once a week. The clear fixtures  are also removable, and so represent an improvement over  manually adjusted wires and metal braces. The company  prints  an  average  seventeen  million  unique  aligners  an- nually and sales have been growing at a rate of 30 percent  a year as more dentists get familiar with and trained on   the system.  Metal- capable 3D printing methods are of great inter- est to dentists. In some cases, printing makes possible the  use  of  hard  metals  such  as  cobalt  chrome  that  are  hard  to work with in traditional dental methods but are desir- able for their mechanical and bonding properties. Not be- ing  limited  to  gold  gives  reconstructive  dentists  greater  design freedom and therefore more clinical flexibility. For  all of these advantages, details are still being worked out.  What are the practice economics  including insurance re- imbursement  of a scanner, a dedicated technician, or a  printer  or fleet of printers  in terms of break- even point  for return on investment? What are the health and safety  considerations  of  powdered  plastics  and  metals,  poten- tially noxious gases produced by heating those powders,  and hazardous and or biomedical waste? What are the key  customer service, financial, and regulatory considerations   96     chapter 4   of buying the service from a lab versus building capacity  internally? These answers will become clearer in the com- ing years, but dentists will remain in the vanguard of addi- tive technology for the foreseeable future.  The other area where 3D printing has been widely ad- opted is in hearing aids. Just as with dentistry, every fit is  a custom one, so the technology makes sense. As of 2013,  it was estimated that more than 10,000,000 hearing aids  worldwide had been 3D printed; as of 2017, 97 percent  of all hearing aids produced worldwide used 3D printing  in  their  manufacture.  Once  again,  economics  drove  the  transition. Cast molds used to be converted into patient  prostheses by skilled artisans in a nine- step process that  took more than a week. Compare that to the streamlined  path  from  laser  scanning   to  generate  ~100,000  data  points of each unique ear  to modeling to printing: a batch  of shells can be 3D printed in two to three hours, often  using vat polymerization. Both Phonak, a Swiss company,  and  US- based  Starkey  use  the  technology,  which  has  re- duced returns  resulting from poor fit  from 40 percent to   10 percent.23  As we have seen, the world of sport provides many op- portunities for short production runs of high- performance  materials to be subjected to extreme stresses. Few of us  drive Formula 1 racing cars or compete in the Olympics,  but additive technologies are still finding their way into  everyday life. The Robot Bike Co. was started in 2013 by      3D printing in consumer markets        97   college classmates from Bath University who had gradu- ated into serious engineering jobs but remained connected  by their love of mountain biking from fifteen years prior.  Robot  Bike  is  able  to  address  a  common  problem:  bike  riders  come  in  all  shapes,  sizes,  and  abilities,  but  mass-  production bike frames come in only three or four varia- tions. Their solution is to build custom bikes using varying  lengths of carbon- fiber tubes combined with 3D- printed  titanium lugs. Because different tube lengths dictate dif- ferent angles for the joints, and different riders generate  different loads on the frame, Robot Bike built a sophisti- cated software front end to optimize bicycle design for each  rider, turning measurements and preferences into a build  via topology optimization and parametric CAD fed into  the third- party additive fabricator’s build- preparation en- gine.24 While the resulting bike is expensive, reviews have  been ecstatic: this new tool in the engineer’s arsenal has  helped the innovators at Robot Bike develop an entirely  new type of machine, one impossible under former manu- facturing constraints.25  Looking Forward  It’s hard to envision a 3D printer in most households. That  said, it’s not hard to see 3D printing having an impact on  many households. The distinction lies in the complexity   98     chapter 4   of making: CAD software and the overall printing process  are too hard for casual consumers to pick up. One of my  students reported buying a 3D printer and not touching it  for more than a year after purchase. At the same time, the  number of printers in the Media Commons at Penn State  has soared from two to thirty- two over three years, and  there are times when use is limited to classwork because  the queues were so long  four days as of this writing .  Much of what will drive adoption is familiarity with  what is possible. Many millennials resist throwaway cul- ture, so being able to repair household items should drive  one strand of uptake. Customization of one’s phone case,  key chain, wedding cake, and knife handles can be a sec- ond growth area, once familiarity and awareness ramp up  along with ease of use. Finally, what might be called “body  appliances”— orthotics, joint braces, eyeglasses, earpieces,  and  so  on— combine  customization,  the  need  for  rapid  turnaround,  and  massive  market  size:  it’s  easy  to  imag- ine Amazon having measurement kiosks at Whole Foods  groceries for these kinds of products. The technologies of  scanning, design, and build preparation are getting good  enough, as are new printing methods, for such a scenario  to make sense. At this juncture, the biggest hurdle is mo- bilizing public awareness and developing a sustainable yet  defensible business model.     3D printing in consumer markets        99    5  INDUSTRIAL USES  Much like the consumer scenario, 3D printing in industry  is technically feasible in many more settings than it is cur- rently deployed in: the barriers to adoption often result  from organizational issues, process workflows, difficulties  in  cost  estimation,  and  the  like.  That  is,  the  challenges  now  more  often  lie  in  business  issues  than  in  technical  ones. Furthermore, the talent shortage represents a major  constraint, but there is some “chicken- and- egg” going on:  some  young  engineers  are  hesitant  to  commit  to  learn- ing  additive  technologies  because  they  are  still  outside  the mainstream, and because they are not widely taught.  Large corporations may hesitate to embrace 3D printing  because the costs are still high and somewhat unpredict- able, and because the necessary skills are scarce.   3D Printing across the Product Life Cycle  Any discussion of industrial 3D printing must address the  many roles it can play in a factory or engineering facility.  One way to do this is to look at a product life cycle view.  Creation As  its  roots  in  prototyping  proved,  3D  printing  allows  designers, potential customers, and manufacturing engi- neers to turn a life- size model over in their hands, test its  fit with adjoining structures and components, and assess  its aesthetic and functional potential. CAD drawings are  much more difficult to assess  though VR goggles help in  this regard , and the speed advantage of getting a mockup  in hours rather than months, in some cases, changes the  design process dramatically by tightening feedback loops,  expanding the number of people who can assess an idea,  and getting input from manufacturing and possibly even  service technicians early on.  Presentation  models  are  integral  to  architecture,  ur- ban planning, and related fields. In addition, large- scale  engineering  projects  such  as  rail  systems,  aircraft,  and  ships have a long history of scale models, many of which  now reside in museum collections. Given the high preci- sion, short production run, and potential need for adjust- ments  to  be  made  after  discussions  or  public  meetings,   102     chapter 5   3D printing is ideally suited for these applications. Multi-  material  printing  allows  transparent  walls  for  showing  internal  details.  Medical  and  surgical  models  perform  a  different function, but once again, the combination of in- tricate detail, fast turnaround time, multiple materials in- cluding transparent ones, and body- friendly materials fits  the market well. These models improve surgical planning,  create  accurate  drill  guides  for  dentists,  and  contribute  other necessary but often overlooked pieces of the treat- ment plan.  Hollywood movies that rely on special effects, futur- istic  worlds,  and  expensive  car  crashes  are  all  using  3D  printing. An early success story came in 2012 when the  iconic Aston Martin DB5 from the early James Bond films  was used in Skyfall. Given the multimillion- pound prices  now attached to collector cars, whose owners do not want  them  driven  in  action  scenes,  the  prop  makers  at  Prop- shop  Modelmakers  enlisted  voxeljet  from  Germany  to  build not models, but model parts: eighteen plastic parts  per  car  were  formed  for  three  1:3  scale  cars,  assembled  onto  steel  frames,  then  painted,  polished,  and  chromed  by the model- makers to a perfectionist degree. Moviego- ers  had  no  hint  they  were  not  seeing  life- size  steel  and  rubber explode on the screen. One of the remaining two  cars  not  blown  up  in  filming  sold  at  auction  for  nearly   $100,000.1     IndustrIal uses      103   Production In  the  production  process,  3D  printing  can  play  many  roles.  In  many  cases,  tooling  for  mass  production  is  a  limiting factor in launching a new product or component,  and 3D printing  whether in steel, wax, sand, silicone, or  other materials  is ideally suited to make small quantities  of highly precise jigs, molds, guides, and other things that  make things.  As we saw in chapter 1, 3D printing can make positive  models  patterns  that are encased in sand, or the printer  can make the molds or tooling inserts directly. In the lat- ter case, production steps are removed, saving both time   and thus schedule complexity  and money. It can be used  for wax  investment casting , silicone, sand, and metal in- serts molds. One major advantage is the ability to include  internal cooling channels to maintain the temperature of  the  insert  or  other  production  tooling.  In  one  instance,  those channels helped reduce cycle time from thirty- five  to  sixteen  seconds  per  injection  mold,  a  54  percent  im- provement.2 Jewelers are also learning the molding tech- nology,  making  their  designs  more  repeatable,  faster  to  produce, and impossible to distinguish from other casting  methods. As long ago as 2007, an estimated two million  jewelry patterns were 3D printed, resulting in more than  $500 million of final product.3  More  intuitively,  3D  printing  is  being  used  in  the  production of metal and plastic parts. These are common   104     chapter 5   in  aerospace:  Airbus  has  announced  that  it  would  print  thirty tons of metal parts each month in 2018.4 Medicine  is another industry with high adoption, for both custom  implants  in the head area, for instance  as well as stan- dard parts such as hip- socket cups. Fashion and apparel  are being led by footwear, though eyeglasses are also an  area of intense interest. In Formula 1 racing cars, additive  methods shrunk lead time from more than six weeks to six  days— and as a bonus the 3D printed parts weighed less.5  Regardless of the industry, the benefits and challenges will  be discussed in more detail below.  Repair Laser  manufacturing  has  been  used  for  roughly  twenty  years to help rebuild complex, expensive metal parts. One  example is a polished drive shaft that has tight tolerances.  Routine use eventually takes the diameter below the ac- ceptable minimum, but other aspects of the part perform  well. In repair, additive techniques  often directed energy  deposition, which does not require a flat build plate or vac- uum chamber  build the diameter up beyond the highest  acceptable level with a metal of proper hardness and other  characteristics, and it is then machined down to spec. A  second  category  of  repairs  is  made  possible  by  reverse-  engineering a part whose manufacturer no longer exists,  or that predates CAD. 3D scanning of the original part can  generate a printer file for the production of a replacement      IndustrIal uses      105   In Formula 1 racing   cars, additive methods  shrunk lead time from  more than six weeks   to six days.   in an extremely rapid turnaround, especially compared to  recreating the original tooling and manufacturing meth- ods for a part that could be many decades old.  Spare Parts In a mass- production model, spare parts must come out of  long production runs and then be warehoused; forecast- ing demand for spares is notoriously difficult, so carrying  costs for manufacturers of complex machines can be high  given high inventory levels for products that may never  be  sold.  In  theory,  once  additive  methods  are  validated  for strength and quality, printing one spare at a time will  become more feasible. In addition, the printing may hap- pen at or near the point of use rather than at the point of  original manufacture.  Constraints  Before  additive  manufacturing  can  become  mainstream,  several  challenges  must  be  addressed.  Among  them  are  the following:  Talent Because  it  combines  computer  science,  metallurgy,  ther- modynamics, and other technical disciplines, 3D printing  requires a skill set that is currently in short supply. One      IndustrIal uses      107   promising development is that centers of excellence are  emerging all over the globe: HP’s 3D printing efforts are  centered in Barcelona  where 1,700 employees come from  more than sixty nations . GE has centers of expertise in  Ohio  and  Pennsylvania,  a  manufacturing  facility  in  Ala- bama,  and  an  innovative  manufacturing  experiment  in  India. Leading hubs for bioprinting innovation are in Ja- pan, San Diego, and Winston- Salem, North Carolina. Car- bon3D  now Carbon  was launched out of the University  of  North  Carolina.  Several  innovative  business  models,  including  3D  Hubs,  originated  in  the  Netherlands.  The  global aspect of 3D printing will likely contribute to a new  generation  of  designers,  technicians,  and  engineers  to  support future growth.  Certification In aerospace especially, parts that find their way into use  must be rigorously certified: a bolt used on a plane and on a  land vehicle may be physically identical, but the aerospace-  certified one costs substantially more, in part because of  the extensive information requirements that it must meet.  3D printed parts are a good fit for aerospace because of  their need for high precision, light weight, and complex  shapes, but until additively produced parts can be tested  and found to be as strong and reliable as castings or other  conventionally produced components, metal parts remain  primarily in the experimental stage; polymer parts, such   108     chapter 5   as carrier- specific interior details, are often produced with  additive manufacturing at Airbus and Boeing. Biopharma  and other medical fields have similar requirements: artifi- cial hips or knees could, in theory, be custom- made from  CT or MRI scan models, but the US FDA lags behind its  Chinese counterpart, which approved certain 3D- printed  hip replacement parts in 2015.6 Noncustomized hip sock- ets  acetabular cups , however, have been 3D printed in  the United States for some time.  Build Size For  both  plastic  and  metal  3D  printing,  the  size  of  the  build chamber is a limitation. Airplane parts, automobile  components, and architectural elements often exceed the  available  dimensions   roughly  a  one- foot  cube   of  even  very expensive and powerful machines. Industrial robots  are being used to position print heads within much larger  build envelopes, as at M3XD in Amsterdam: the firm is  printing a stainless- steel pedestrian bridge. Cincinnati, a  custom  machine- tool  manufacturer,  is  commercializing  BAAM   Big  Area  Additive  Manufacturing ,  a  technique  that  began  as  a  multiparty  collaboration  including  Oak  Ridge National Labs. The firm teamed with Local Motors  and other partners to 3D print a car at a trade show in  2014.  In  the  near  future,  GE  will  commercialize  a  one-  meter cubic build volume for laser powder that was in de- velopment as of mid- 2018.     IndustrIal uses      109   Inspection Metal or plastic that is built up layer by layer will generally  fail differently than a piece that is molded or milled down  from a solid piece. Both theoretical research and engineer- ing trials are ongoing to understand more about these fail- ure modes, which depend heavily on the orientation of the  build  which in turn can be constrained by the build cham- ber dimensions . Furthermore, voids and other quality de- fects  often arising from glitches in temperature control  over the duration of the build  may be difficult to discern.  In  some  cases,  pieces  are  run  through  a  CT  scanner  or  other X- ray machine, but some of the testing techniques  that help maintain quality in traditionally formed parts  do not carry over. In one research paper, it was reported  that the CT scan revealed the presence of debris from post-  processing in internal hydraulic channels. Those shavings  could have caused catastrophic failure in associated equip- ment had the fitting been subjected to typical hydraulic  fluid volumes and pressures.7 Introducing these new test  instruments  and  processes  into  traditional  manufactur- ing increases cost, complexity, and hesitation to commit  to additive manufacturing.  Time Measuring  the  speed  of  3D  printing  relative  to  conven- tional  techniques  is  complex,  because  the  time  to  tool  up to produce a single injection molded plastic piece, for   110     chapter 5   example, often becomes irrelevant given that the produc- tion run could be in the hundreds or thousands. In other  cases, the time between design and prototype can be ac- celerated by a large multiple by having a 3D printer avail- able rather than sending the piece out to a vendor. Even  so, first- run success is not expected: GE Additive expects a  minimum of two practice builds to optimize support struc- tures, refine build orientation, and or address shrinkage  or  distortion.8  Once  the  build  specifications  are  dialed  in, often the time to build up a piece can be extreme, and  given the material, geometry, and other factors, additive  techniques may not make sense. Many machines include  video cameras and other sensors to monitor the build for  quality, allowing some of them to run overnight without  being attended by a human worker. Metal builds can run  longer than a week.  Cost Mass production is tough to beat for cost if the produc- tion run is sufficiently long and amenable to conventional  manufacturing techniques. Finding the optimal combina- tions of short runs and or complex builds to target for 3D  printing  is  still  an  ongoing  process.  Powdered  metal  or  plastic is often much more expensive than solid feedstock   often between ten and one hundred times the cost per  kilogram , electricity to power ovens and lasers is not free,  and technical expertise for additive manufacturing might      IndustrIal uses      111   require  a  highly  paid  engineer  rather  than  a  shop- floor  machine operator.  Workflow Integration Factory  layouts  traditionally  change  slowly  when  a  new  technology  is  introduced,  whether  it  is  electric  motors  or CAD. Additive manufacturing is still sufficiently new  that its place in the overall workflow is unclear. How do  designers optimize a part for cost- effective additive manu- facturing? Which parts are 3D printed? When does print- ing happen, relative to both the customer order and the  next  factory  process  step?  How  do  risks  and  dependen- cies  change?  What  are  the  quality,  flow,  and  other  met- rics to be benchmarked and managed? What are the skill  sets, workflows, and inspection points when parts need  to be cleaned, deburred, plated, sandblasted, or otherwise  worked on after they leave the printer?  Materials Ever since the first generation of stereolithography in the  1980s, progress in 3D printing has required the collabora- tion of machine manufacturers, manufacturing practition- ers,  and  materials  suppliers.  Ciba- Geigy  introduced  the  first acrylate photopolymer resins in conjunction with 3D  Systems in the late 1980s. More recently, Alcoa opened a  new powdered metals business specifically aimed at addi- tive manufacturing applications: prior to the early 1990s,   112     chapter 5   there  were  few  markets  for  powdered  aerospace  metals,  yet they are an important market twenty- five years later.  Further, the characteristics of metal powder for coating,  for example, may not be optimal for either powder- bed or  nozzle- blown  additive  manufacturing  processes.  Finally,  the high costs of titanium alloys, Inconel, and other prod- ucts give distributors a strong disincentive to stock them  without reasonable expectation of a quick sale.  Another factor involves certification. Powder suppliers  to the aerospace industry, for example, must obtain ISO or  other quality certifications. Once again, the “chicken and  egg” problem is in play: vendors won’t undertake the cost  and effort of certification without sufficient demand, but  demand from regulated industries requires certifications  across  the  supply  chain,  each  instance  of  which  freezes  certain aspects of the business process and imposes costs  for monitoring, reporting, and auditing.  Case Study: GE LEAP Jet Engine Nozzle  In many ways, the jet engine nozzle is a perfect illustration  of how 3D printing can change production manufacturing  rather than only prototyping or custom parts.9 Additive  manufacturing  reduced  defect  rates,  decreased  weight,  improved performance, and helped the engine deliver its  fuel  savings  target  to  customers:  the  value  produced  by      IndustrIal uses      113   additive  production  is  significant.  In  addition,  it  shows  how manufactured complexity can be close to free rather  than expensive. This mindset change may be the most sig- nificant contribution of all.  The story began in 1994 when Greg Morris cofounded  Morris  Technologies  to  commercialize  3D  printing.  His  team first worked with stereolithography and then with  metal- based laser technologies. His firm was located near  GE’s  jet  engine  operation  in  the  Cincinnati,  Ohio,  area,  and by 2003, Morris Technologies was known to GE as a  useful partner in prototyping and similar tasks.  In  2006,  GE  engineers  were  working  within  CFM  International,  a  joint  venture  between  GE  Aviation  and  France’s  Safran  Aircraft  Engines,  to  design  a  new,  fuel-  efficient  jet  engine  for  the  single- aisle  passenger  plane  segment. A key component designed by the GE engineers  was a radical new nozzle to spray fuel into the combustion  chamber: the new design reduced both fuel consumption  and emissions. It was also extremely complex, requiring  welds and brazes to assemble twenty parts. Casting was  impossible: eight attempts failed.  Mohammad Ehteshami was the head of engineering  at GE Aviation whose team had the idea for using additive  manufacturing to make the nozzle. GE engineers had been  using Morris Technologies to print prototypes of new en- gine parts and rapidly iterate new designs. The LEAP team   114     chapter 5   now wanted to know whether Morris could use 3D print- ing for mass production of a complex part.  The project was treated with the highest corporate se- crecy, given the stakes and the competitive environment  in the aerospace industry. Morris received the computer  file with the drawing of the intricate nozzle tip, printed  it in a nickel alloy, and showed it to the GE team.  The  production part is made from a cobalt- chromium alloy.   The  3D  printed  nozzle  was  an  engineering  break- through.  All  twenty  parts  were  now  a  single  solid  unit  weighing  25  percent  less  than  an  ordinary  nozzle;  later  tests  showed  it  was  at  least  five  times  as  durable   see   figure 5.1 . It also started a major shift in GE corporate  direction.  GE  Aviation  acquired  Morris  Technologies  in  2012, so Ehteshami, Morris, and their teams started a new  set of experiments on an old helicopter engine. Ehteshami  put six engineers on the task of reproducing the engine  with  additively  produced  parts.  Significantly,  he  had  to  hide the effort to prevent his finance officer from cutting  the nonproductive work from the overall budget.  Within eighteen months, the team was able to print  half of the helicopter engine. Nine hundred separate com- ponents were combined into only sixteen; one 3D piece  replicated an assembly of more than three hundred parts.  As with the fuel nozzle, the additively produced parts re- duced weight by 40 percent while costing 60 percent less.     IndustrIal uses      115   Figure 5.1  GE LEAP fuel nozzle  image courtesy of GE   In 2014 Ehteshami shared his findings with his supe- rior, the head of GE Aviation, who then told the CEO and  the board. As a result, 3D printing soon became a core GE  competency.  Additive  technology  research  and  develop- ment centers were launched in Cincinnati, Dayton, Pitts- burgh, and elsewhere. More acquisitions were completed:  in  2016  GE  bought  75  percent  of  Arcam,  the  Swedish   116     chapter 5   manufacturer of metal 3D printers using electron beams,  and 75 percent of the German firm Concept Laser, which  pioneered powder bed selective laser melting. GE opened  a 3D printing factory for the LEAP nozzles in Auburn, Ala- bama. The first pair of more than 12,000 engines ordered  was delivered and put into service in 2016. In Italy, mean- while, a GE additive facility is printing turbine blades out  of a titanium alloy for the GE9X, a jet engine used on the  Boeing 777.  GEs  engineers  also  worked  to  apply  additive  tech- niques to a new engine, this one a turboprop. This time  the team consolidated 855 individual parts into twelve 3D  printed assemblies. Once again, the advantages included  reduced weight, 20 percent better fuel efficiency, and 10  percent  more  power  output.  In  addition,  development  time was a third faster using additive techniques for rapid  prototyping. In 2016, GE’s engine design was chosen by  Textron Aviation for its initial run of Cessna Denalis.  Several aspects of the GE story are worth underlining.  First, 3D printing can change performance criteria by sig- nificant margins: fuel savings, power, development time,  cost, and durability all saw major improvements. Second,  rather  than  being  expensive  or  impossible,  complexity  gets inexpensive: in some sense, the bigger limit is the de- signer’s imagination and tools rather than the capability  of the fabrication technology. Third, conventional manu- facturing financial metrics had to be managed, in this case      IndustrIal uses      117   through  stealth,  as  GE  engineers  climbed  the  learning  curve. Finally, complex fuel nozzles proved the benefits  of additive manufacturing on a part that isn’t particularly  mechanically strong or stressed. Parts subject to physical  load   wheel  struts,  flight  control  surfaces,  door  hinges   are still problematic in that the long- term stress and fail- ure points of 3D printed parts are not fully understood.  Additive manufacturing appears to have two primary  industrial  uses  along  with  three  secondary  ones.  As  we  have just seen, the first relates to complex geometries. In  the second, it is worth considering the textbook definition  of economies of scale  see figure 5.2 .  In conventional mass production, investments in tool- ing, raw materials inventories, and labor skills do not pay  back instantly. Once the organization has learned how to  make an item and has a reasonably well known demand for  it, however, it can be produced for some duration in large  numbers at a low cost. Late in the life cycle, demand will  slow,  increasing  carrying  costs.  Machines  break,  people  retire or quit, and new priorities compete for production  equipment, investment, and labor. Late in the product’s  life, it often becomes more expensive to produce as obso- lescence also becomes a factor.  Various studies have identified the break- even point  where long- run mass production begins to exhibit a cost  advantage.  Dynetics  is  a  US  defense  contractor  that  de- veloped a control module to be housed in a plastic shell   118     chapter 5   Long-range average cost  Economies of  scale  Constant returns  to scale  Diseconomies of  scale  t i  n u    r e p    t s o C  Traditional manufacturing  Additive manufacturing  Cumulative output  Figure 5.2  Conceptual model illustrating how additive manufacturing pays  off in small production quantities and late in production  comprised of six parts that would need to be adapted for  aquatic, airborne, and land deployment. Jabil, a contract  electronics  manufacturer,  has  been  an  early  partner  de- ploying HP’s 3D printers. Jabil calculated that 3D printing  was cheaper per part until the 5,000th part, at which time  the estimated $300,000 tooling cost was justified. One of  the smaller parts in the assembly did not reach break- even  until 25,000 parts. Not surprisingly, additive production  was chosen to produce all variants of the controller hous- ing.10 A widely cited study out of the University of Turin  in Italy compared high- pressure die casting with a DMLS  3D metal printer to make wheel strut assemblies for a 1:5  scale model of a light aircraft. The break- even in this case      IndustrIal uses      119   was forty- two units, far more than would have been neces- sary to validate the proof of concept.11  In contrast to the familiar U- shaped curve of long- run  average  costs   see  figure  5.2 ,  additive  methods  should  theoretically cost the same to produce whether it is the  fifth item or the 500th. The flat line of long- run average  costs for additive manufacturing puts it at an advantage in  two time periods  assuming the product can be produced  via  mass  production  methods .  Early  in  the  production   cycle,  when  runs  are  too  short  to  trigger  economies  of  scale, and late in the cycle, when spare parts and custom  orders  are  more  common,  additive  methods  prove  their  worth, as they have since their origin as prototyping tools  in the 1980s. On the left- hand side of the curve lie short  runs of customized parts, for example.  Benefits of Additive Manufacturing  Changeover Time In  conventional  manufacturing  of  plastic  items,  tooling  changeover  can  be  extremely  complex  and  costly:  every  molding technique is different, but few are premised on  short  runs  of  customizable  items.  In  contrast,  once  the  software model has been validated and “sliced” for produc- tion in an additive fashion, production can begin as soon  as a machine is free.  120     chapter 5   Reduced Need for Tooling Whether  in  metal  or  polymer,  being  able  to  go  directly  from CAD to production bypasses the lead times, some- times prolonged, associated with the production of molds,  dies, and other tools. These are often expensive and many  eventually  break  or  wear  out,  sometimes  creating  unex- pected delays.  Part Consolidation Being able to additively print one part in place of up to  dozens  or  hundreds  of  individual  components  simpli- fies maintenance and reduces the chances of production  or repair being held up by a single part being late  or be- ing made by a now- bankrupt supplier . The weight of the  combined additive part is typically lighter as well, a major  advantage in aerospace applications.  Sustainability Additive  manufacturing  can  reduce  the  production  of  spare parts that are never used and end up as scrap. It can  also make existing parts lighter  for improved aircraft or  automotive fuel economy  and use less material in doing  so. Finally, making parts at or near the point of use rather  than at a central facility reduces freight costs as well as  the carbon footprint associated with transporting the part  from the factory or warehouse to the field.     IndustrIal uses      121   Supply- Chain Decisions  Additive  manufacturing  has  the  potential  to  remap  the  manufacturing  supply  chain.  Firms  are  rethinking  the  costs  of  centralized  manufacturing  in  low- cost  environ- ments far from end customers. As a result, many manu- facturers are establishing distributed production facilities  close to the ultimate customers: BMW manufactures cars  and SUVs in China, South Africa, South Carolina, and of  course Germany. Additive manufacturing has the poten- tial to decentralize some aspects of production even fur- ther: what if a hospital could print a titanium- alloy knee  joint,  custom- fit  and  on- demand,  a  day  before  surgery?  From a supply chain perspective, such a process addresses  three  main  considerations:  it  reduces  the  time  a  part  spends in inventory, thereby increasing turns; it reduces  risk of missed forecasts and subsequent stock- outs or ex- cessive inventory carrying costs; and it improves financial  health by freeing up working capital and accelerating the  order- to- cash  cycle.  Parts  consolidation  also  has  the  po- tential to reduce the number of suppliers, which counts as  an additional supply chain win.  Several challenges must be addressed for such a sce- nario to become practical. A big question revolves around  the intellectual property, not only the CAD files but also  the process knowledge required to guarantee that the hip  joint printed in humid Manila performs the same as those   122     chapter 5   printed in cold Calgary or desert Cairo. Rather than Stryker  certifying  one  or  two  metals  providers,  meanwhile,  will  every hospital be assured that the right powdered metals  will be delivered and subsequently handled properly? How  will the various national food and drug administrations  monitor  thousands  of  “factories”  rather  than  a  handful  per country? Will there be sufficient financial incentive  and protection to ensure that designers of useful devices  will not be dissuaded  or worse  by counterfeiters?  One Path to Adoption  Given  the  vast  amount  of  technical,  financial,  and  orga- nizational  learning  that  must  occur,  few  organizations  apart  from  specialized  startups  can  jump  to  exotic  met- als  in  complex  geometries  printed  for  custom  applica- tions. A much more common ramp- up might include the   following:  1.  Prototyping  Get the technology into the hands of  designers as they assess form, fit, and function.  2.  Tooling  Whether one- off jigs and fixtures or  production molds and dies, 3D printing has proved  to deliver countless wins on the shop floor outside of  producing parts.     IndustrIal uses      123   3.  Spare parts  Exploit the technology’s capacity to  produce short runs of potentially obsolete or otherwise  low- demand parts, especially in plastic rather than  metals.  4.  Adapt current production to additive  right scenarios, parts can be consolidated and other  business cases made for moving highly customized   and or short- run conventionally produced parts to  additive manufacturing.  In the    5.  Design for Additive Manufacturing  Having climbed  the learning curve, companies can then actively exploit  3D printing’s capacity to execute complex geometries in  heretofore impossible materials.  Note that the initial step involves working with low-  cost plastic filaments and the last step potentially requires  working with an exotic aerospace or medical metal. The  cost of failure rises with the level of expertise and the com- munity of interested employees.  124     chapter 5   6  IMPLICATIONS  The adoption of 3D printing has not occurred as rapidly as  its most enthusiastic supporters had predicted. Whether  in consumer or industrial markets, barriers to uptake are  slowing growth. Several factors appear to be at work:     The skills for design, production, marketing, and  process integration into existing workflows are scarce.     In a time when supply chains are becoming more  tightly coupled via shared information flows, new  organizational arrangements including outsourcing, and  regulatory mandates, plans to implement 3D printing are  no longer only a firm- level decision: multiple parties may  all need to buy in.     Other facets of advanced manufacturing, including  the use of “big data,” carbon fiber and other composites,    robotics, and the Internet of Things  networked sensors  and actuators , might be delivering more perceived value  and or lower barriers to entry.     3D printing is as much a craft as it is a science, and the  necessary knowledge base regarding everything from  laser shapes to powder granularity to build orientation is  neither deep nor widely distributed.  All  of  these  barriers  will  be  overcome  in  time,  espe- cially in industrial use cases. As we have seen with hearing  aids,  mass  markets  will  be  addressed  with  little  fanfare  when  the  technology  fits  and  delivers  tangible  benefits.  As this happens in more and more scenarios, there will be  many unintuitive consequences and implications. Let us  examine some of them here.  Decentralization  The digital era has witnessed many instances in which a  formerly complex, expensive, and centralized process was  pushed out to the edge of a network. In music production,  a garage can be a fully functioning recording studio with  professional  software  available  for  laptop  PCs  and  even  tablets; CD pressing plants are also being closed. In news  gathering,  many  networks  have  dispensed  with  staffers   126     chapter 6   and  stringers,  relying  more  heavily  on  citizen  smart- phone video; a New York Times photographer won a Pulit- zer Prize for iPhone photos.1 Regarding consumption of  news, meanwhile, newspapers are struggling to adapt to  digital economics as paper is generally read only by older  demographics: the notion of a millennial having a Wash- ington Post delivered to her doorstep is nearly impossible  to contemplate.  In some forms of manufacturing, processes that are  currently performed in capital- intensive factories, often  thousands of miles away from end customers, will migrate  to smaller facilities. The former logic of economies of scale  will still apply in some cases, but in others, the increase  in  responsiveness,  personalization,  and or  inventory  re- duction will favor decentralized productive capacity. This  decentralization already can be seen in book publishing:  rather than my university library purchasing a paper vol- ume from a journal, I print out the article I need on my  desktop  if I in fact want paper at all .  Navy  ships  already  print  some  parts  on  board.  Den- tists  already  print  some  fixtures  and  implants  on  site.  Downloadable 3D files are already helping repair broken  oven knobs in both restaurant and home kitchens. Hos- pitals could well print some medical implants rather than  ordering  them  from  a  central  warehouse.  Auto  manu- facturers  could  install  small  polymer  printers  at  dealers  to  save  on  inventory  costs  for  thousands  of  small  but      ImplIcatIons      127   important plastic parts; Mercedes was already 3D printing  spare plastic parts for its trucks as of 2016. Porsche went  a  step  further  and  is  using  additive  techniques  to  recre- ate obsolete parts— with “absolute fidelity to the original  specifications”— for  its  classic  models.2  FedEx Kinkos  and Staples have experimented with 3D printers in their  retail locations, and this trend is likely to continue.  What does decentralization bring with it? Monitoring  the  production  of  sensitive  items,  such  as  firearms,  be- comes much more difficult when there are thousands of  potential gunsmiths rather than dozens. Without central  “choke points” that can be monitored and audited, authori- ties  turn  instead  to  watching  strategic  inputs:  Sudafed    a  key  ingredient  in  meth  labs   and  certain  agricultural  fertilizers used in amateur explosives are no longer read- ily  available  in  the  United  States.  It  is  likely  that  some  metal  powders,  replacement  lasers,  or  alloy  ingredients  for  doping  could  become  harder  to  obtain  when  abuses  are discovered.  At  the  same  time,  putting  more  productive  capabil- ity closer to end users, without layers of intermediaries,  can  result  in  accelerated  innovation.  The  smartphone  app industry is a case in point: when enterprise software  took huge teams years to write in the 1960s and 1970s,  there  were  no  social  applications,  no  mass- market  com- puter games, and no integration with GPS  as in Waze  or  photography  as in Snapchat . Makers are likely to make   128     chapter 6   things  that  large  organizations  never  attempted  or  con- ceived of.  Decentralization can have the effect of decreasing the  market power of centralized resources. A look at the fate  of most newspaper, minicomputer, and photography com- panies illustrates the point vividly. Which manufacturing  companies might be at risk of having their value replicated,  albeit at lower but still acceptable quality, by smaller, more  nimble players at the edge of the network? New organiza- tional  forms  are  likely  to  emerge,  for  somewhat  compli- cated reasons.  When electric motors were invented in the late nine- teenth century, textile mills and other factories used equip- ment driven by central overhead line shafts connected to  individual  machines  by  pulleys.  The  line  shafts  in  turn  were driven by steam or water power. This technology had  the effect of orienting looms and other machines by their  proximity to the power source. It took roughly thirty years  for managers to discover that individual electric motors al- lowed machines to be arranged to support workflow, ma- terials flows, or other considerations: early electric motors  drove groups of machines, merely duplicating water power.  In contrast, the new layouts had many benefits: productiv- ity improved with more logical material handling and pro- cess design, overall power consumption declined because  individual machines could be turned on or off without re- gard to others located nearby, and workplace lighting and      ImplIcatIons      129   Putting more productive  capability closer to end  users, without layers   of intermediaries, can  result in accelerated  innovation.   safety improved. Without the drive belts all running to the  ceiling, room was created for electric overhead cranes. The  factory of 1930 bore little resemblance to a facility from  just fifty years prior.3  In many industrial settings, additive manufacturing  occupies a similar position to that of early electrification.  Initially,  3D  printing  is  considered  as  a  replacement  for  casting or injection molding, and often found wanting for  lack of economies of scale. In more advanced companies,  engineers  are  consolidating  many  smaller  components  into  additive  builds,  a  significant  improvement.  Produc- tion planning and project management are simplified by  having  far  fewer  dependencies,  overall  weight  is  often  reduced,  and  the  strength  of  the  single,  lighter  build  is  typically higher. Tolerances are tighter, scrap rates are fre- quently reduced, and overall costs drop as a result of better  fit and improved output.4  But what needs to happen next is for complex prod- ucts to be designed for additive manufacturing from the  outset, not having 3D printing applied to a conventional  design  after  the  fact.  This  state  of  native  rethinking  of  design is more likely to come in a small, nimble company  without  deeply  established  processes  and  mindsets:  the  Robot Bike example in chapter 4 provides a case in point.  While DLM and other machines are anything but cheap,  they do enable a small shop to compete on equal footing  with millions of dollars in traditional metal- casting and      ImplIcatIons      131   - working  machinery.  Furthermore,  a  company  designed  from the ground up to exploit the advantages of additive  manufacturing will likely employ new business models,5  organizational  shapes,6  marketing  channels,  and  other  practices.  Business Aspects  Focusing on the economic benefits of additive manufactur- ing, it is important to see improvement on both revenue  and cost sides of the ledger. Revenues can be increased in  two broad categories: reaching new markets, and getting  higher prices than are currently acceptable. Mass custom- ization can address both of these dimensions, and person- alized needs  whether for footwear or medical appliances,  to take two examples  that could not be met with mass-  produced products constitute one win. Secondly, meeting  specific needs of specific customers allows producers to  charge more: custom tailored suits are a familiar example. Further  wins  from  mass  customization  come  with  inventory reduction: in a pure demand- pull regime, there  is no excess inventory because demand is known before  production  is  completed.  At  the  same  time,  lot  sizes  of  one become possible without the traditional practices of  postponement— which is late- stage completion of a prod- uct  Ikea furniture is a classic example of postponement,   132     chapter 6   but not customization — or other modifications of stan- dard output.  Supply chains got very long in the early 2000s when  manufacturers  invested  heavily  in  production  in  cheap-  labor  regions  that  were  far  from  end  customers.  Unex- pected events of many sorts— from the Icelandic volcano  to  port  strikes  to  tsunamis— forced  a  rethinking  of  the  risks of interruption of these long and fragile connections.  Now, production of, say, a custom cardiac stent could oc- cur a day before its implantation only a few feet away from  its  manufacture.  Short  supply  chains  reduce  inventory,  improve planning accuracy  and thus reduce scrap rates  due  to  unsold  inventory ,  and  reduce  missed  deliveries  and other shortages, known in the field as stock- outs.  The use of working capital also improves. Expensive  tooling for a long production run does not have to be pro- cured and paid for before a single item is produced. This  reduction  of  sunk  costs  extends  to  raw  materials:  the  metal or polymer powder for a single build can easily be  expensed, while truckloads of raw metal or polymer com- pounds are potentially a much more costly proposition for  large batches that need to be run. Finally, the capital in- vestment in additive manufacturing equipment is highly  adaptable:  it  is  a  thing  that  can  make  many  different  things. In contrast, stampers, molds, and dies are tightly  constrained and difficult or impossible to adapt as market  conditions change.     ImplIcatIons      133   Research  at  the  Technical  University  of  Aachen  in   Germany has identified four areas where additive manu- facturing can drive a profitable business market:  1.  Short production runs such as prototypes or spare  parts for obsolete products.  2.  High production complexity such as race car parts,  aerospace components, or cooling chambers that are  impossible to mold or mill.  3.  Highly customized items such as dental or medical  implants or high- end sporting equipment.  4.  Spatially remote production such as offshore oil rigs  or at the extreme, the International Space Station.7  For  years,  research  in  3D  printing  was  focused  on  replicating the subtractive and formative manufacturing  processes  and  materials  of  the  past  150  years,  albeit  in  smaller lots. More recently, additive machines have come  into their own when entirely new materials become prac- tical. Adidas is teaming with Carbon to 3D print running-  shoe midsoles in a lattice framework that was previously  impossible to produce. The first run of 100,000 pairs of  the $300 shoes began shipping in 2018, shortly after Adi- das made an investment in the startup and took a seat on  Carbon’s board.8  134     chapter 6   Another example of a 3D- printer- centric material is  an  aluminum- ceramic  composite  pioneered  by  Elemen- tum  3D,  a  startup  focused  on  this  new  class  of  builds.9  One fascinating material the Elementum team has been  able  to  print  is  nickel  titanium,  also  known  as  Nitinol   named for its place of birth: NIckel TItanium Naval Ord- nance Laboratory . It is highly desirable for a narrow class  of  high- performance  applications,  but  exceedingly  diffi- cult to work.10 According to a PhD dissertation in surgical  medicine,  NiTi has unique properties that could be very  useful in surgical applications. . . . Using its thermal  shape memory property, a material sensing a  change in external temperature is able to convert  to a preprogrammed shape. While NiTi is soft and  easily deformable in its lower temperature form   martensite , it resumes its original shape and  rigidity when heated to its higher temperature form   austenite . . . . Within a given temperature range,  NiTi can also be strained several times more than  conventional metal alloys without being plastically  deformed. This superelastic property is also based on  martensic transformation.11  This  extraordinary  material  is  used  in  everything  from dental appliances to watch springs to cardiac stents      ImplIcatIons      135   to thermonuclear devices. Opening the alloy to new uses  through  additive  manufacturing  could  produce  break- through results.  In  sum,  additive  manufacturing  has  been  demon- strated to be a profitable investment both in reproducing  conventional manufacturing results in smaller lot sizes, in  mass customization, and in “extreme engineering” scenar- ios such as highly complex  possibly consolidated  parts,  exotic materials, or remote but critical locations. Most of  these are straightforward and have already been discussed.  Mass customization is a more modern concept, one previ- ously not applied to manufactured products outside com- puters and high- end consumer electronics, that deserves  a closer examination.  Potential for Mass Customization  One potential new business model could be based on mass  production  of  unique  items.  Hearing  aids  have  already  proved  the  concept,  and  several  startups  are  expanding  the model to additional markets. Tailored Fits is a Swiss  company  that  began  by  making  custom  orthotics  for  sports shoes and ski boots.  Orthotics have been success- fully 3D printed since at least 2010.12  In 2018 the com- pany expanded its market to include complete custom ski  boots. There are many advantages:  136     chapter 6      Traditional Alpine ski boots are rigid and create painful  pressure points in many wearers.     Boots that fit too tightly, even in spots, restrict  circulation, leading to cold feet.     The dynamic loads borne by the boot binding ski  system can be considerable, leading to the potential for  injury if one component does not fit the skier or the style  of skiing.     As baby boomers age, the skiing demographic is getting  older.     Most people’s feet are different sizes, making a bad  fitting boot nearly inevitable.  In contrast, Tailored Fits begins with a 3D scan of the  skier’s legs and feet. A major hurdle was developing scan- ning technology that could be deployed to outdoor retail- ers and operated by store personnel. Mapping the right  posture s  to scan was also important: standing at relaxed  vertical, or sitting down, does not mimic the pose of ac- tive downhill skiing. From the scans, Tailored Fits worked  with an additive manufacturing vendor to build models  for  both  soft  boot  liners  and— eventually— hard  outer  shells in various types and grades of polymers.  The  technology  was  just  coming  to  market  at  press  time. Expected benefits to the wearer were better comfort      ImplIcatIons      137   and superior performance. For the retailer, ski boots are  expensive  to  buy  and  inventory  because  they  are  physi- cally bulky, and every standard size represents a compro- mise for a given customer. Freeing up working capital and  store space, combined with higher customer satisfaction,  at a competitive price point, makes the technology attrac- tive. For the startup, all of the above benefits matter, with  the additional gain from parts consolidation and simpli- fied assembly in the prototype: the inner liner is mounted  in the external shell, a closure strap is added, and assembly  is complete.13  Medical prostheses and implants are a near neighbor  to  the  ski  boots:  recall  that  Tailored  Fits  began  with  or- thotics. Similarly, the millions of dental crowns being addi- tively fabricated all count as prostheses. But the potential  market, for both artificial limbs and surgical implants, is  vast, and when eyeglasses are added, even bigger. Many  elements are already in place: 3D scanning is improving  rapidly and coming down in cost, mapping software  to  move from medical scans to production files, for example   is improving, and food and drug administrations around  the world are approving more applications.  In many cases, polymer- based prosthetics work well:  they are water- resistant, relatively cheap to produce, light- weight, and biologically inert. In some cases, plastic or ce- ramic parts are being used as “scaffolding” for the body  to grow new tissue onto, sometimes using a specialized   138     chapter 6   technique called robocasting; we will explore bioprinting  actual tissue in chapter 7.14 Scanning removes the need  for  skilled  artisans  to  hand- make  prostheses,  which  tra- ditionally were extremely expensive and did not fit well  at the interface, in part because of the limitations of the  available materials. In the case of eyeglasses, frames are  already made of many polymers used in 3D printing, as are  lenses  which have been 3D printed since 2009 . A Dutch  company  printed  integrated  lenses  and  frames  for  the  country’s king in 2013,15 resulting in stronger designs as  well as new possible shapes and configurations given that  there is no need for a lens- attachment system to be built  at the factory prior to lens specification. Given that eye- glasses are about a $100 billion global industry and inti- mately connected both to personalization and to personal  identity, expect to see the industry continue to expand its  use of additive technologies.  For  mass  customization  to  take  deep  roots  in  the  industrial  landscape,  the  supply  chain  will  need  to  be  reconceived  and  reconfigured.  Much  as  3D  printers  are  often tested on builds traditionally performed by subtrac- tive and similar methods and found to be too slow and   expensive, the supply- chain model begins with raw mate- rials: the canonical order of operations is plan → source →  make → deliver → [handle returns].16 In both cases, the  defining capabilities of additive manufacturing are not be- ing utilized to maximum advantage.     ImplIcatIons      139   To design a mass customization process from scratch,  the key is to begin with unique units of demand: what is  it that is being customized, and to what parameters? The  hearing aid market is instructive in this regard: local au- diologists  measure  the  customer’s  hearing  loss  and  ear  dimensions, then feed these data into the process. Where  else can customizable goods find willing buyers who can be  served by fitters and configurators with access to printing  capacity in some shape or form? Absent a steady stream  of such customized orders, the “mass” in mass customiza- tion fails to materialize at economically attractive levels.  Forecasting  is  a  key  step  in  any  manufacturing  pro- cess, and in the case of hearing aids, demographics pro- vide a macro- level insight into how many people of what  hearing- compromised ages live in a given area. Long cor- porate history— the Danish hearing aid company Oticon  was founded in 1904— can also provide insight into fash- ion trends, seasonality, and other influences on demand.  Thus the audiologist channel, the unique and reasonably  predictable demographics of hearing loss  and the desire  for its remediation , and corporate institutional memory  all likely contributed to the success of hearing aids being  manufactured with additive technology.  Starting  from  closer  to  scratch  for,  say,  orthopedic  prostheses or custom athletic shoes would be considerably  more difficult.  Ski boots are much easier, sold as they are  at a small number of retail outlets, to a generally affluent,   140     chapter 6   price- insensitive market, and with acute physical discom- fort as a motivator.  Once the demand is recognized and  pooled, production capacity can be situated nearby, with  little regard for iron ore  as in steel mills , skilled program- mers  Silicon Valley , or nearby vineyards  wine presses . In  the longer term, these geographic impacts will likely come  from small rather than massive facilities, and will change  the economic geography of a number of industries.17  Additive  manufacturing  and  other  recent  develop- ments in advanced manufacturing are emerging against  the  backdrop  of  globalization  as  it  enters  its  own  new  phase.  One  can  argue  that  globalization  most  recently  dates to about 1989: the fall of the Berlin wall, the Tianan- men Square protests, the emergence of the affordable cell  phone,  and  the  World  Wide  Web  specification  all  hap- pened pretty much at the same time. In 2020, there will  be a different world order: China is no longer an emerging  power, the former Soviet Union has yet to coalesce into  a coherent economic force, India has entered into more  and more global discussions of trade and culture, and the  automobile is being rapidly electrified and computerized.  Africa remains mineral- rich and economically poor, OPEC  could lose much of its influence as cars are weaned off gas- oline, and most adults on the planet have or will soon have  access to a smartphone.  In short, these new demand- driven production proc- esses  made  possible  in  part  by  3D  printing   and  other      ImplIcatIons      141   technologies,  including  cloud  computing,  3D  scanning,  and  new  designer  materials   will  challenge  the  offshore  model of mass production, but that model is itself evolv- ing for other reasons having nothing to do with 3D print- ing,  as  the  changes  to  the  global  automobile  industry  suggest.  Mass  urbanization,  decreasing  global  poverty,  asymmetric  warfare   including  battles  fought  in  cyber  domains ,  and  improved  social  and  economic  status  for  woman in many countries  including Saudi Arabia — all of  these are reshaping economic life in gradual, subtle, but  undeniably profound ways, and for 3D printing to become  the economic force it has the potential to reach, its cham- pions will need to recognize and surf these other waves   of change.  Testing and Standards  For additive manufacturing to become a fully mature ele- ment of the productive infrastructure, it will need to move  out of the current state. Many processes are “black boxes,”  either because of proprietary tactics  such as being locked  in to a machine manufacturer’s supplies  or because fun- damental  science  and  engineering  questions  remain  un- answered. Production is still an art form, with frequent  variability of outcomes given apparently identical inputs.  Design  tools  do  not  reflect  all  the  information  needed   142     chapter 6   at  the  CAD  stage,  including  cost  estimation  as  one  ex- ample. The various modeling, production, and inspection  software  packages  have  gaps  and  limited  interoperabil- ity: many measurements of a build are not automatically  logged and analyzed, for example.  Efforts  around  the  world  are  attempting  to  remedy  this  state  of  affairs.  The  International  Organization  for  Standardization   ISO ,  ASTM   originally  the  American  Section of the International Association for Testing Mate- rials , and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,  to name a few organizations, all have published standards  relative to additive manufacturing, but much remains to  be codified. The US National Institute of Standards and  Technology held a workshop on additive manufacturing in  metals in 2012,18 followed by a similar session on polymer-  based methods in 2016.19 Many essential issues emerged  from these two meetings, which overlapped to a surpris- ing degree. Here is a brief sampling:  Materials     How can materials be developed for both metal and  polymer printing such that performance is predictable?  Many materials currently exhibit high variability across  batches. At the same time, the same powder can behave  very differently in different machines. What process  parameters can introduce or reduce this variability?     ImplIcatIons      143      How can materials be reliably classified on more axes  than only structural strength, such as bio- compatible,  autoclave- safe, electronic, magnetic, and fatigue tolerant   in both metals and elastomers ?     How can material properties be reflected in design  tools, allowing various parameters to be varied and  compared?     How can the price of materials be reduced, increasing  the total market? For example, quantities are often  so small for a given formulation that many powder or  filament manufacturers cannot economically justify  serving a niche. According to one unnamed company  representative, polymers for traditional manufacturing  were outselling additive manufacturing purchases about  100,000 to 1  by weight  as of 2016.20     How can materials be reengineered to support faster  builds? That will require knowing more of the physics  and chemistry of both inputs and the building process.  Machine Performance     How can machines become more efficient?     How can builds be more consistent, both across  printers and across builds on the same machine, perhaps  under different operators?  144     chapter 6      How can machines perform more self- monitoring, self-  diagnosis, and self- calibration?     How can the actual and usable build envelopes get  larger?     How can build performance be monitored in real time?  Many manufacturers forbid users from attaching thermal  cameras, spectrometers, or other in- process   data collectors.  Process Performance     How can additive design and manufacturing become  more predictable? That is, how can desired properties  of the final product such as strength or ductility be  translated backward into build parameters?     When can design models couple additive design,  materials selection, and manufacturing processes,  allowing the designer to trade off different aspects  in pursuit of weight, cost, strength, time, or other  constraints?     When will predictive models relate inputs  thermal  history of both the build chamber and the melting  sintering beam, tool path, speed, material particulars,  desired geometry  to build success and part  performance?     ImplIcatIons      145      When can manufacturing processes be qualified and or  certified to reduce the need for part- level testing?     Where are the metrics with which to evaluate and  verify models and simulation tools?  Boundary- Spanning Challenges     When will adequate, feasible sensor technology  support real- time process control?     How can designers learn to think about additive  methods natively, not as a translation from conventional  machining and manufacturing?     What are the protocols, the physical hyperlinks as  it were, between a 3D- printed part in the wild and its  design and build history? How readily will a report of a  failed part be connected to video, sensor, inspection, and  other files documenting its path from CAD to physical  completion?     When will there be standardized benchmark “torture  tests” for metal printers similar to the Benchy boat21   figure 6.1  for home 3D printers? That is, when can  industrial users standardize the performance of their  machines with open- source test files? The US NIST   has recently launched a promising candidate, so the   146     chapter 6   Figure 6.1  The Benchy boat is a publicly available design to test many  aspects of desktop 3D printer performance.

ImplIcatIons      147   Design Freedom  While it is not the imagine- sketch- print stereotype that  some  enthusiasts  portray,  additive  manufacturing  does  require a substantially new design perspective, language,  and skill set. The clumsy acronym DFAM— design for ad- ditive  manufacturing— is  an  emerging  extension  of  the  much  older  “design  for  manufacturability”  movement,  taking  into  account  the  broader  capabilities  of  additive  techniques.  Very  few  parts  and  even  fewer  processes  are designed around the new types of material strength,  geometric  possibilities,  and  multi- material  constructs  that  are  becoming  possible.  Rather,  much  of  the  exist- ing  work  has  re- platformed  subtractive  processes  and  designs onto additive tools. DFAM seeks to engineer new  approaches  and  concepts  into  the  design  language  and   toolset.  An early step in DFAM involves the recognition of each  technology’s limits, such as minimum feature size, mini- mum wall thickness, and maximum overhang. Second, the  effects of gravity on an additive build must be accounted  for. In certain materials, making a circular hole on the ver- tical axis means the top will “fall” slightly  especially with- out support structures  whereas building the piece on its  side ensures a more perfect roundness. Third, materials  will exhibit different combinations of cost, performance,  and build speed. The powder grain size of various metals   148     chapter 6   affects  both  overall  surface  smoothness  and  minimum  feature sizes, for example. Finally, build- preparation soft- ware does not always guarantee that the build- in- process  does not have features that can interfere with the powder  re- coater,  especially  if  each  powder  layer  is  particularly  thin  in  pursuit  of  a  smooth  surface  finish.  In  summary,  this process might be thought of as learning the “rules of  the road.”  The  most  important  “rule  of  the  road”  for  additive  manufacturing in metal is currently the optimal use and  design  of  support  structures.  One  research  team  esti- mates  that  80  percent  of  build  failures  in  powder- bed  metal manufacturing result from inadequate design sup- ports.23 The lack of experience with the concept in other  manufacturing  methods,  the  lack  of  accepted  principles  and design rules in engineering curricula, and the lack of  industry- wide communications of successful approaches  all contribute to the many failed builds in the course of a  designer’s education.  Currently, a primary component of DFAM is topology  optimization,  a  mathematical  technique  built  on  finite  element  analysis  that  generates  a  material  layout  given  predicted loads, size, and other constraints. The resulting  shapes  can  be  curvilinear  and  almost  biological  in  their  appearance, as is seen in a common example in which a  traditional bracket is subjected to multiple rounds of the  process  see figure 6.2 .     ImplIcatIons      149   Figure 6.2  Topology optimization helps in “lightweighting” a bracket,  reducing the structure to the minimum size and thicknesses necessary for  the loads it will carry. Note that extensive post- processing has also been  performed. Photo credit: Frustum  Topology optimization is itself one aspect of a larger  emerging concept called generative design. Generative de- sign is more free- ranging than topology optimization, ex- ploring a larger space of potential solutions. After initial  conditions are specified, algorithms explore a wide variety  of available possibilities, generating  or “growing”  a range  of forms often featuring unorthodox geometry. Autodesk  makes  software  tools  that  do  both.  As  Greg  Fallon,  the  vice president of Simulation stated, “While optimization   150     chapter 6   focuses on refining a known solution without any notion  of  manufacturability,  generative  design  helps  the  engi- neer explore a whole cadre of functional and manufactur- ing design options.”24 With many former constraints on  manufacturability now reset, these tools will likely play a  key role in greater expression of what 3D printing is truly  capable of.  Both  topology  optimization  and  generative  design  can drive the use of cellular, lattice, or mesh structures,  typically in the interior of a part. The benefits in strength,  weight, and aesthetics are appealing  see figure 6.3 . Ad- ditionally,  similar  interior  “cells”  or  fins  can  be  used  to  improve  the  fluid  dynamics  of  a  gas  or  liquid  through  an  aircraft  engine,  internal  combustion  engine,  or  even  a water faucet. These structures lower cost because less  material is consumed, and reduce build time as well. An  important constraint in the use of lattices and honeycomb  structures  is  the  computational  load  these  geometries  place on both design and structural analysis software. To  oversimplify, it might be that these geometric forms are  easier to build than to computationally model or analyze.25 Another  facet  of  DFAM  is  parts  consolidation,  in  which multiple components can be combined into larger  3D printed parts. This technique can speed assembly and  streamline supply chains, albeit at the cost of much more  expensive  repair  parts  when  the  larger  assemblage  fails.  Fewer joints also can reduce noise, leakage of fluids, and      ImplIcatIons      151   Figure 6.3  2x magnification of a 3D printed self- supporting lattice.

For  what  reasons?  If  multi- material  builds  and or  embedded  moving  parts  are  considered,  how  are  these  considerations  weighed,  given  that  they  fall outside of the tradition DFM methodology? If there  are  internal  channels  for  fluid  flow,  how  does  topology  optimization for the channels interact with topology op- timization of the overall structure? GE’s LEAP nozzle and  related research have helped prove the viability of parts  consolidation, but the implications— for design, for ven- dor management, for manufacturing process design, for  repair— will take years to fully parse. See figure 6.4 for an  example:  seventeen  components  were  combined  into  a  single additive build of a hydraulic manifold, with weight  savings of 60 percent.  Farther  in  the  future,  there  is  interest  in  function- ally graded materials, which combine different materials  to achieve a performance objective: to achieve new levels  of thermal performance, for example, the best properties  of  ceramics  and  metals  might  be  combined.  In  other  in- stances, metal circuit traces are included within polymer  parts. While a voxel is a standard unit of volume in additive  manufacturing, a maxel is a proposed term to describe a  structural unit of a functionally graded material. Because  of the precise nature of additive manufacturing, new ma- terials combinations with desired properties for aerospace      ImplIcatIons      153   Figure 6.4  Part consolidation in metal additive manufacturing.

Education and Jobs  The long- term relationship between 3D printing and the  US education system looks to be both complex and evolv- ing. The low  initial  cost and dramatic increase in student  engagement make printers very popular in K– 12 schools   154     chapter 6   in many countries. They are being used in both STEM and  design- centered  curricula,  emphasizing  the  connection  of math to production in the former and shortening the  plan- design- make- evaluate cycle  in essence, helping stu- dents fail faster while iterating  in the latter.  At the same time, just as when PCs were enthusiasti- cally introduced into elementary education in the 1990s,  the purchase price of the machines often turns out to be a  minor factor in predicting long- term pedagogical success.  Lesson plans, allocating classroom space, supplies and re- pairs, and a steady stream of doable yet relevant projects  all require more money, time, and access to expertise than  many initial estimates allowed.  More critically, it’s not clear that hardware purchases  alleviate the shortage of computer science- capable teach- ers  in  K– 12.  In  late  2017,  a  public- private  partnership  pledged $500 million to improving computer science in- struction. For example, only one state  Arkansas, home to  Walmart  requires K– 12 computer science education; Vir- ginia and Rhode Island were expected to follow suit. Only  thirty- three states count computer science credits toward  high school graduation. Thus between weak curricula and  a shortage of capable teachers, buying 3D printers without  the institutional scaffolding to support sustained, system- atic learning is likely to produce little significant effect.26  Later  in  the  education  pipeline,  high  schools  and  universities  are  doing  little  to  prepare  graduates  for  an      ImplIcatIons      155   additive manufacturing future. Curricular innovations are  extremely rare, in part because faculty lack the expertise  to run the machines and teach with them, in part because  many machines run as closed systems with proprietary in- puts, and because the cross- cutting skills “break” the de- partmental specialization model that is currently in place.  Computer  science,  materials  science,  supply- chain  man- agement, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering,  optics,  metallurgy,  polymer  chemistry,  and  solid- state  physics could originate in four or five different colleges  within a university, never mind a single major. Bridging  the  gap  between  faculty  research  and  vocational  prepa- ration  in  various  combinations  of  these  fields  remains  challenging.  To  meet  these  gaps,  several  initiatives  are  under- way. The European Union launched its ADMIRE project   knowledge Alliance for AdDitive Manufacturing between  Industry  and  univeRsitiEs   most  immediately  focused  on creating a masters degree program. Founding partner  universities  came  from  France,  Germany,  Portugal,  and  the  United  Kingdom.  Cincinnati  State   located  in  close  proximity  to  GE’s  aircraft  division  where  many  additive  efforts are underway  is launching a two- year certificate  program.27  For  more  advanced  learners,  Penn  State  an- nounced two new masters programs  one in science, one  in engineering  in additive manufacturing and design in  2017.28  156     chapter 6   Eight  universities  worldwide  are  getting  advanced   metal printers from GE:     Auburn University     Boston University     Iowa State University     North Carolina State University     Ohio State University     University of Cincinnati     US Naval Academy     University of New South Wales.  Before the winners were announced, interest in GE’s  announcement  was  strong:  more  than  250  universities  submitted  applications,  along  with  more  than  five  hun- dred primary and secondary schools. Four hundred of the  latter category will receive desktop polymer printers.29  Intellectual Property  The decentralizing tendencies of digital technologies gen- erally are also at work in 3D printing. As barriers to en- try are lowered in that a single machine can replicate the      ImplIcatIons      157   work of casting, molding, and machining operations, the  number of entities in a given market is likely to increase,  sometimes by a factor of ten: hundreds of thousands of  desktop  polymer  printers  can  do  some  of  the  work  of  thousands  of  injection  molding  and  related  firms.  With  greater  numbers  comes  both  anonymity  and  increased  supply- chain complexity: finding which printer generated  a given plastic figurine may be impossible. Counterfeiting  is likely to be a major issue, whether for antique- car parts  or expensive aerospace components.  If a company makes machines that can copy protected  property,  is  the  machine- maker  liable  for  illegal  copies?  In  1980  Universal  Studios  sued  Sony  over  the  Betamax  videorecorder. A US district court held for Sony, a circuit  court reversed the verdict in Universal’s favor, then the  US  Supreme  Court  issued  the  final  word:  “The  sale  of  copying equipment, like the sale of other articles of com- merce, does not constitute contributory infringement if  the product is widely used for legitimate, unobjectionable  purposes. Indeed, it need merely be capable of substantial  noninfringing uses.”30 While that sounds definitive  a 3D  printer need only be capable of noninfringing use to be le- gal , the courts and the US Congress took a far more favor- able view of rights- holders’ positions with regard to digital  copying and downloading of music and movies. When 3D  printing comes to its Napster moment, if that were to oc- cur, it’s possible yet another standard will emerge.  158     chapter 6   The  traditional  defense  against  such  copying  lies  in  patent  law.  3D  printing  raises  two  major  challenges  to  these  laws,  according  to  an  early  law  journal  article  on  the topic: first, IP rights holders are confronted by new  rights claims by 3D printer users, such as the right to re- pair an existing patent- protected item. Second, additive  methods provide the technology’s users with new means  of infringement that may not have been prohibited at the  time the statutes were drafted.31  One key factor in patent law relating to 3D printing in- volves the role of software— the build file— in the ultimate  item’s creation. Case law on software is far from coherent or  technically nuanced, and the notion of a build file as a “com- puter program” can be problematic.32 If party A is accused   of  stealing  party  B’s  ideas,  what  precisely  is  stolen?  Did   party A intend to steal a patented object? How can party B  prove that intent? Does making a picture  a 3D scan  of a  gear constitute theft? What about copying a “sliced” CAD   file? If the software is not the theft, what then is stolen,  exactly?33  If  3D  scanning  generates  a  reverse- engineered  replica  of  the  original  part,  what  computer  “program”  is  responsible: AutoCAD, Magics, the build file  not an execut- able, presumably , or the embedded software in the printer?  As of 2014, patent infringement litigation based on items  created in a 3D printer had not yet occurred.34  Intellectual- property holders do have several avenues  to consider. For example, a topology- optimized shape for      ImplIcatIons      159   a given part might qualify for a design patent, insofar as it  has novel aspects of appearance and unique features that  add value and functionality.35 More promising is the do- main of trade secret law, which does not require a filing   as with patents  and has a lower burden of proof. Given  that software’s ability to be patented is currently unclear,  build files can more definitively be protected as trade se- crets. That said, additive manufacturing is an extremely  dynamic  area,  with  many  good  ideas  being  discovered  independently, and trade secret protections do not apply  to reverse engineering. A final option is to copyright the  build file, at a minimum, and perhaps other aspects of the  process, but they must “qualify as an expression of an idea  rather than the idea itself.”36  All of the above applies to the US legal context, but  there  are  significantly  different  standards  in  play  else- where in the world. The World Intellectual Property Or- ganization  cites  both  Australian  and  European  Union  standards  in  its  guide  to  3D  printing.  After  Brexit,  the  United Kingdom, where some leading additive innovation  is occurring, occupies a legal limbo given both the strong  British  legal  tradition  and  the  more  recent  EU  member- ship.  “Trade  dress,”  referring  to  visual  trademarks  and  related signaling, is at once global and local, and how it  gets defined with relation to 3D printing will likely matter  significantly for the future of IP protection. Spare parts in   160     chapter 6   particular are predicted to be a battleground for the inter- pretation of trademark.37  Furthermore, theft of intellectual property is possible  without actually possessing the object or the file: research- ers have discovered the acoustic side channel— the noises  made by the 3D printer— can be recorded and used to re- construct the shape being printed. This same attack has  successfully been used on cryptography machines, ATMs,  CPUs, and computer keyboards, but there is no indication  the vulnerability in 3D printers has been exploited outside  a research lab.38  Other Legal Aspects  Although  the  public  curiosity  and  uproar  have  subsided,  many  people’s  main  awareness  of  3D  printing  was  fo- cused on the story that broke in 2013 of Cody Wilson, a  law student at the University of Texas who developed and  distributed  via  the  internet  plans  to  print  a  single- shot  plastic gun, which he named the Liberator. Wilson’s firm,  Defense  Distributed,  released  the  plans  on  May  6  and  more than 100,000 downloads were recorded. The United  States Department of State then demanded that Wilson  retract the plans, which he did, under the rationale that  the State Department regulates the flow of technical data      ImplIcatIons      161   related to arms, and is charged with enforcing the Arms  Control Act of 1976. Copies of the files are still available  at file sharing websites such as The Pirate Bay, however.39 The Liberator is much more useful as a discussion point  than as a weapon: at least one trial of the gun resulted in  its shattering, and in the United States, handguns with  safer designs, more capacity, and much greater reliability  are readily available. The Liberator does have the potential  to pass unnoticed through airport screening: even though  Wilson included a metal nailhead as a firing pin, the rest  of the product is both radiographically invisible and highly  ineffective. The barrel is not rifled, the energy of firing is  widely  dissipated,  and  reloading  takes  both  several  min- utes and some hand tools when the bullet’s cartridge gets  jammed  in  the  soft  plastic.  Furthermore,  many  home  makers have been stymied when trying to use the files on  a MakerBot-class device: most if not all successful firings  have  been  with  weapons  made  in  $100,000  commercial  machines.  All of that said, the Liberator and some other develop- ments point up substantial legal issues. It is possible to  print  the  lower  receiver   the  serial- number- bearing  trig- ger mechanism that both connects all parts of the weapon  together  and  regulates  whether  the  weapon  is  manual,  semiautomatic,  or  fully  automatic   of  an  AR- 15  rifle,  the  weapon  of  choice  for  school  shooters  in  the  United  States. The modification would dodge a proposed ban on   162     chapter 6   high- capacity  magazines  and  has  been  tested  manually  firing six hundred rounds without a jam.40 Furthermore,  Defense  Distributed  has  since  developed  and  circulated  plans for a “ghost gun,” an untraceable AR- 15  such weap- ons  have  unsurprisingly  been  used  in  mass  shootings .  Rather than 3D printing, the key digital fabrication tool  is a $1,500 CNC mill with a USB stick sold by Defense Dis- tributed that shapes a block of aluminum  cost: $80  and  essentially automates a weekend of work that a capable  home gunsmith could do with a drill press.41  The  availability  of  gun- making  and  gun- modifying  hardware  pushes  the  ideological  distinctions  applied  to  software and communications networks to a new extreme.  Richard Stallman, who founded the Free Software Foun- dation, famously argued that software should be free as  in freedom, not free as in beer. Later advocates including  Eric Raymond  who wrote the seminal essay “The Cathe- dral  and  the  Bazaar”   developed  the  more  user- friendly  “open- source  software”  offshoot  of  the  movement,  with  less  talk  of  either  constitutional  interpretation  or  kegs.  In communications as well, between “burner” cell phones,  tools like PGP, and the Tor network aimed at preserving  anonymous  internet  usage,  privacy  advocates  can  limit  their digital breadcrumbs, potentially for illegal purposes.  Digital  privacy  and  libertarianism  enters  a  new  phase  when the conversation involves not only virtual but phys- ical instantiations.     ImplIcatIons      163   A related controversy began brewing in late 2017 when  an Australian physician named Philip Nitschke announced  he was putting plans online for a 3D- printed suicide ma- chine called the Sarco. Rather than injectable chemicals,  the  machine  features  a  chamber  into  which  the  patient  climbs  entering a PIN after completing a pre- euthanasia  questionnaire  and which doubles as a casket after the ox- ygen is replaced by nitrogen. The base onto which the pod  is affixed can be reused. His reasoning for the invention  is to address the paradox of suicide being legal in many  locales, but assisting suicide being prohibited.42  Conclusion  Regardless of ideological interpretations or enthusiasms,  the fact is that decentralizing industrial production limits  the ability of governments or commercial entities to regu- late the uses of capital equipment that is now shrunk down  to  household  scale.   In  a  related  development,  Oxford  Nanopore has released a pocket DNA sequencer that sells  for $1,000 and plugs into a USB port. 43 The former tools  and mechanisms of regulating manufacturing and distri- bution of drugs, weapons, words, images, and sounds no  longer scale downward to potentially millions of locations.  How that regulation will occur going forward is likely to   164     chapter 6   be  fiercely  contested,  with  numerous  unexpected  conse- quences repeatedly resetting the debate.  As these contests occur at the edges of many cultures,  the mainstream issues concerning design practice, shop  floor  technique,  and  education  for  both  current  and  fu- ture additive manufacturers will continue to evolve. Curri- cula will be developed and shared, standards and practices  will evolve, and more success in mass customization will  continue to reshape both public perception of 3D printing  and the propensity for firms to invest in it.     ImplIcatIons      165    7  FRONTIERS  Additive manufacturing is farthest along in its evolution in  polymer scenarios, as the tens of millions of SLA- printed  hearing aids attest. Work in metal is slightly behind, be- cause the technology is newer, although the importance of  aerospace and defense applications is pushing the frontier  rapidly forward. While there remains much to learn about  metal and plastic, new materials are being explored in labs  and startups. Each of these— mammalian tissue, building  construction,  food,  clothing,  micromachines,  and  elec- tronic circuits— represents a set of solutions to a grand-  challenge- scale problem. In conjunction with mainstream  uses of additive manufacturing, in turn, the many new ap- plications challenge existing methods for education, pro- duction processes, and capital allocation.   Bioprinting  In  most  countries  and  in  the  world  at  large,  there  are  fewer organs for donation than there are people who need  them. The trend toward self- driving cars in particular and  greater usage of mass transit in an urbanizing world more  generally is projected to increase the shortfall of available  organs: motor vehicle accidents involving healthy young  people are a major source of donor organs.  Bioprinting  is  an  emerging  technique  within  the  field  of  tissue  engineering  to  use  3D  printing  technolo- gies to precisely place both living cells and biomaterials  into  constructs  designed  ultimately  to  replicate  human  organs.  The  technical  challenges  are  considerable,  but  early successes include the printing of a human skin sub- stitute  currently  used  for  cosmetics  testing  in  place  of  animals.1 L’Oréal is teaming up with the biotech firm Or- ganovo in the area of skin research, and the tech startup  has  also  brought  functioning  liver  tissue  to  market  for  pharmaceutical  companies  to  employ  in  the  new- drug  development process. Nevertheless, it is essential to dif- ferentiate between bioprinting tissue and organs, which  are  currently  too  complex  for  the  available  technology.  Three  major  approaches  are  being  used— biomimicry,  autonomous  self- assembly,  and  mini- tissue  building  blocks— but detailed discussions of these are beyond our   scope here.2  168     chapter 7   Bioprinting  begins  with  a  series  of  scans  of  the  af- fected  organ  and  surrounding  area,  much  as  with  me- chanical  reverse  engineering   see  chapter  2 .  A  crucial  distinction is important to note: the tissue scans focus not  only on what is where  structure , but also on what does  what  function . Consider that bioprinting aims to place  “cells, proteins, DNA, drug particles, growth factors, and  biologically active particles,”3 so the design must accom- modate not only all the biochemical processes to sustain  those tissue components, but also blood flow and mechan- ical properties: how strong must human skin, or a liver, or  a vertebra, be, not just in general but in its key structures?  Also, tissue must sustain multiple fluid and material flows,  including lymphatic and blood perfusion, not only in the  specific tissue but connected to adjoining structures. All  told, the variability and complexity of human tissue makes  mechanical replication especially difficult. After the scans,  a digital model is built in STM language  see chapter 2 ,  then printed using bioinks in a bioprinter, the first one of  which was commercialized in 2009.  Various techniques including 3D printing of inert or  biofriendly materials have been used to create “scaffolds”  upon which a body can grow replacement tissue. Eventu- ally the scaffold should degrade, and until that point, the  many  requirements  of  successful  tissue  regeneration—  including  specific  matches  to  each  individual  recipi- ent in size, material strength, blood flow, function, and      Frontiers      169   conformity  to  adjoining  structures— mean  that  few  scaffold- building materials and techniques have enjoyed  wide success.  To summarize, the design of artificial tissue must ad-  dress the following considerations:     Mechanical  for example, how strong, how stiff vs how  pliable  and where , how much structural integrity in  various states, such as standing vs lying down, in exercise  vs asleep, in a dehydrated state .     Biological  such as which cell types are where, how cells  are nourished, how the tissue forms .     Geometric  whether the tissue or organ fits where it  needs to, both at implantation and later . Significantly,  the replacement part cannot be markedly smaller than  the original: human bodies do not readily tolerate  internal voids.     Transport  growth factors, nutrients, drug delivery,  oxygen, and waste removal must all be managed .     Bioprinting  much as with traditional 3D printing, this  includes the amount of the material that is added, how  fast, under what conditions: resolution, build speed, layer  height .4  170     chapter 7   Divergence from Material Printing Several key differences between material printing and bio- printing are worth noting. First, control of porosity aims in  two opposite directions: with very few exceptions, in metal  especially, hot isostatic pressing and other techniques are  required to ensure uniform material distribution because  voids can contribute to cracking. In bioprinting, pore size  is a critical variable, yet current CAD technology does not  represent these microstructures, nor can STL  efficiently   transmit  such  data  to  a  toolpath  for  the  extruders.  Sec- ond, overhangs and other horizontal biological elements  may not be able to be built with support structures to be  removed  in  post- processing.  Third,  bioprinting  involves  many soft materials that are more difficult to control than  predictable polymers or metals in rigid geometries: heart  walls would be one example.  The most promising of these soft materials is the class  of hydrogels that combine hydrated scaffolds containing  cells that can migrate in 3D space. This is in contrast to tra- ditional scaffolding, in which cells can migrate only along  the surface of the scaffold, so tissue growth is enhanced by  better cell growth within the supportive  in several senses:  mechanical,  energy,  microclimate   medium.  Another  av- enue  in  early  trials  involves  a  building- block  approach,  using tissue spheroids that do not require scaffolding. At  this juncture, the science  both physics and biology , the      Frontiers      171   software  both design and machine toolpath generators ,  and the assembly hardware are all lacking.  Let us look at this problem in more detail. Bioprinters  are not a large segment of the tissue engineering market, so  there are few biomaterials optimized for the few 3D print- ers that are available. At the same time, the technology  issues related to bioprinting are still in the lab- experiment  phase, so material producers have little incentive to meet  such  limited  and  poorly  defined  demand.  Printers  need  materials, and materials producers need hardware designs  to stabilize.  What are the requirements for a good bioink? A stan- dard textbook in the field identifies thirteen parameters,  many of which trade off against others. Here is a sampling:     Which bioprinting technologies will the bioink  support? Currently, laser- based tools, droplet placement,  and extrusion methods dominate the young field.     How successfully can the biomaterial support the  bioprinting process? Cell degradation, nozzle clogging,  and customization of equipment  extrusion heads  are  some considerations here.     How closely does the bioink mimic the behavior of live  cells and tissue?     How practical is the bioink technology? Long  preparation times, limited compatibility with other   172     chapter 7   biomaterials, and the necessity for delicate hand labor  are causes for concern.     What are the time scales for incubation both during  and after bioprinting? Slower build times can result in  faster tissue formation, for example.     Does the bioink induce an autoimmune response from  the host, and if so, can it be successfully managed?     Bioink often contains components that need to  degrade as live tissue growth replaces scaffolding.  Managing this degradation is a complex process.5  What,  then,  are  the  requirements  for  a  bioprinter?   The same textbook identifies ten requirements:  1.  High resolution and accuracy  Bioink must simulate  cell placement in native tissue.  2.  High degree- of- freedom in motion  Printer heads  must be able to deposit bioink on curved and irregular  surfaces, as will be required when printers will deposit  cells onto live patients.  3.  High- speed motion  Bioprinters should  support rapid fabrication of human- scale tissue for  transplantation and other therapeutic applications, as  well as fitting into high- throughput assays for cancer  research and drug development.     Frontiers      173   4.  Ability to dispense multiple types of bioink   solutions simultaneously  Native tissue is comprised   of multiple types of cells, and laying down only one cell  type at a time severely limits the ability to mimic live  tissue.  5.  Ease of use  As bioprinting leaves the lab, the required  skill levels available will by necessity drop from PhDs and  post- doctoral fellows to the levels of the wider workforce.  6.  Compact size  Bioprinters must be treated with  regard for biohazard safety, so they need to fit under  standard protective lab equipment.  7.  Ease of sterilization  Similar to point 6, bioprinters  need to support standard sterilization procedures.  8.  Full- automation capability  Much like metal or  polymer printers that often run overnight, bioprinters  cannot be continuously attended, particularly given long  complex builds.  9.  Affordability  As with any technology, prices will  need to drop to a level that will allow labs and researchers  to afford the machines before experimentation and  communities of practice will drive wider adoption.  10.  Versatility  Especially until standards and practices  become normalized, researchers need to be able to adapt  bioprinting technology to evolving needs.  174     chapter 7   In addition to the macro- level chicken- and- egg prob- lem  of  bioprinters  and  bioinks  both  being  in  short  sup- ply, thus dissuading development of the complementary  technologies, there are several concrete limitations. First,  commercially  available  bioprinters  are  scarce,  especially  models that are not extrusion- based. Second, print- head  cartridge nozzle  assemblies  must  be  capable  of  a   han- dling a range of cell sizes without damaging any of them,  b  supporting precise, consistent placement of those cells,  and c  being easily and reliably loaded during a long, com- plex build. To date, all three of these conditions remain  challenging to achieve consistently. Third, bioprinters are  currently too big to fit into even a laboratory environment  much less being able to integrate into a patient- care work- flow, and they are also impractically slow. Fourth, today’s  bioprinters do not have enough flexibility in their motion  to be used in the creation of complex physical structures.6 The challenges continue. Bioprinters are insufficiently  automated,  requiring  substantial  skill  and  constant  at- tention on the part of the operator. They cost so much  that return- on- investment calculations still cannot justify  their purchase. Current bioprinters lack sufficient resolu- tion  both in their motion control and in the behavior of  hydrogels after application  to build capillary structures,  which are required for many long- term objectives in tissue  and organ printing. Experience with bioprinters has come  in experimental contexts so the shop craft and operator      Frontiers      175   knowledge for wider- scale application are not widely avail- able. Taken together, these obstacles pose significant bar- riers in any roadmap toward organ printing.7  Construction  Architects and civil engineers are helping lead the way to- ward developing additive methods for building construc- tion. The initial efforts are not yet twenty years old, so  many of the hurdles faced in polymers and metals  regard- ing stability and proof of durability in particular  are still  being addressed. Just as with any tool, no technology is  perfect for all applications, but there are several emerging  areas where 3D- printed construction could be extremely  attractive.  In the planning phase, architectural models are proven  to be useful for everything from assessing sight lines to  testing  various  weight- bearing  concepts.  Traditionally,  the final model was expensive and fragile, limiting its use  as an iterative design tool. More recently, plastics can be  economically printed at sufficient resolution for models to  become interactive conversation and collaboration tools  in the design process, and some architectural offices are  bringing their model- building capability in- house. Other  offices use binder jetting and other color- capable technol- ogies. Because architectural CAD often does not transfer   176     chapter 7   to part fabrication, however, several data translation steps  are required.  Several technologies are being employed beyond the  model phase for actual fabrication. Apis Cor is a startup  based in San Francisco and Russia. In December 2016 the  firm  built  a  four- hundred- square- foot  house  in  twenty-  four hours using a print head extruding concrete to form  hollow halls, through which ran plumbing and electrical  work. The cost was about $10,000, which is cheaper on a  per- square- foot basis than a typical Habitat for Human- ity frame house, some of which cost roughly $50,000 for  1,050 square feet.8  Enrico Dini is an Italian civil engineer and inventor of  the D- Shape building technology. Unlike the arc- shaped  walls  built  on- site  in  the  Apis  Cor  house,  D- Shape  uses  a  traveling  print  head  on  a  grid,  very  similar  to  bridge-  finishing  technology,  to  print  rectangular  building  ele- ments out of a variety of stone aggregate mixes including  marble and volcanic rock. The building elements are then  transported for modular construction at the job site.9  Behrokh  Khoshnevis  has  been  experimenting  with  3D- printed  building  technologies  since  1996.  His  com- pany, Contour Crafting, grew out of his work as an engi- neering professor at the University of Southern California.  Rather  than  building  components,  Contour  Crafting  works on site, laying down hollow concrete halls using a  computer- controlled  robotic  gantry.  While  some  other      Frontiers      177   Apis Cor built a four-  hundred- square- foot  house in twenty- four  hours using a print head  extruding concrete.   innovators stress the design freedom afforded by additive  methods,  Khoshnevis  stresses  the  safety  improvement  that an automated approach offers over a reported 60,000  construction- related deaths annually, worldwide.  Branch Technology is the firm founded by the archi- tect  Platt  Boyd  to  build  complex  geometric  shapes  that  are at once economical, visually dazzling, and extremely  strong for their weight. As with D- Shape, Branch Technol- ogy manufactures building components in its shop rather  than on site. Boyd left his architecture firm in 2015 after  experimenting with 3D- printed plastic shapes that were  terrifically  strong:  a  two- ounce  plastic  structure  held  160  pounds   Boyd’s  body  weight ,  then  a  carbon- fiber-  reinforced plastic matrix, reinforced with spray insulation,  weighed four pounds but successfully held three tons.10  Finally,  WinSun  is  a  Chinese  firm  concerned  with  economies of scale: as hundreds of millions of its citizens  move to cities, China needs a lot of housing, fast. Thus the  3D- printed construction modules, emerging from a mas- sive printer  490 feet long × 33 feet wide × 20 feet deep ,  are  a  step  toward  “dignified”   in  the  company’s  words   housing made in part from construction waste and mine  tailings. The houses are geometrically simple, sturdy, and  cost less than $5,000 apiece.11  The potential for these methods is vast, ranging from  rain-  and wind- proof housing for the masses in some set- tings, to extraordinarily complex architectural statements      Frontiers      179   of what is known as parametric design, a highly mathemati- cal approach to form.12 In addition, Khoshnevis’s Contour  Crafting proposes a radical approach to building pylons for  wind turbines. Currently these structures are expensive,  dangerous  to  build,  and  not  as  tall  as  conceptual  ideals  would suggest. Rather than having enormous cranes dan- gle massive steel structures from above for workers to me- chanically join hundreds of feet off the ground, imagine  three sets of parallel caterpillar tractor treads climbing up  a cylinder of gradually decreasing radius and supporting a  print head spraying successive layers of cement onto a cir- cular base. The pylon could be much taller, stronger, and  cheaper   not  to  mention  less  stressful  for  the  construc- tors   than  current  designs.  At  several  extremes— mass  housing,  innovative  shapes,  and  safer  construction  of  critical infrastructure— 3D printing will literally reshape  the construction landscape.  Several  challenges  need  to  be  addressed  before  this  can happen, however. First, building codes ensure public  safety, in part by learning from past failures. Efforts are  underway to create the room for experimentation, while  preserving  public  safety,  that  3D  printing  needs.  Once  codes  allow  3D  printing  into  construction,  banks  can  lend money, clients can get certificates of occupancy, and  these  structures  can  actually  get  built  and  lived  in.  Sec- ond,  just  as  failure  modes  for  additively  produced  plas- tics and metals must be learned, so too do designers and   180     chapter 7   engineers need to learn how these structures age. With- out thirty years of data, building inspectors are hesitant  to  assume  3D- printed  structures  will  not  fail  over  time.  Finally, while many materials are being investigated, find- ing the ones that combine aesthetic values, the necessary  engineering  properties,  and  successful  implementation   such as not clogging extruder nozzles  will take time and  experimentation.  Food  In contrast to bioprinting, food is an easy extension of ex- isting  extrusion  technologies— some  open- source  plans  even  show  how  certain  printers  can  be  modified.  In  ad- dition,  commercial  food  processing  already  uses  extrud- ers  and  other  additive  technologies  to  make  chips  and  cookies, among other things, so scaling these processing  lines down to a single machine is logically straightforward.  Most food printing uses some variation of a digitally con- trolled extrusion model; experiments using bioprinting of  cells to create a meat- like product are farther out on the  horizon  and  will  not  be  addressed  here.  Chocolate  pow- der and some sugars have also been successfully used in  powder- bed technologies.  The  future  of  3D  printed  food  can  be  viewed  along    six axes:     Frontiers      181   1.  Extreme conditions  Feeding passengers on a long  trip through space could be achieved by having a printer  as part of the galley, with large stores of vitamin-  and  protein- rich feedstock. Thus crew members’ appetites  could be sated with some degree of spontaneity and  consideration for flavor preference. NASA has 3D printed  a pizza in space.  2.  Food conservation  Food waste is a massive, global  problem. As the planet’s population rises toward the  projected 9+ billion in 2050, salvaging some of the 1.3  billion tons of wasted food will be essential. 3D printing  has the advantage of being able to take leftover meat  and fish trimmings, spoiled fruits, and other safe but  unattractive food and package it more palatably. In  addition, unconventional protein sources such as insects  and algae can be transformed into healthy and tasty  products.13  3.  High- end dining  3D printers can spread gels and  purees with perfect consistency and tightly detailed  precision. Some restaurants use the technology for  dessert courses, sometimes in sight of the diners, who  can watch their dish “grow” over the course of the  meal. Chocolatiers and confectioners can already make  intricate, captivating shapes, given how well sugar and  chocolate can be worked through a nozzle.  Hershey has   182     chapter 7   teamed with 3D Systems to make complex geometric  shapes in chocolate.14   4.  Addressing certain disabilities  Some individuals   about 4 percent of adults  have trouble chewing but   still enjoy the taste of real food as opposed to liquid  diets. 3D printing has been used to help some of these  individuals meet their dietary requirements safely,  without fear of choking, by reconstituting food powders  into gels and other semistructured dishes. At the same  time, individual dietary requirements such as low salt or  extra potassium can be addressed in the blending of the  powders.  5.  Providing variety at home  Some industry figures  foresee home food printers functioning much like  microwave ovens, delivering convenience and variety.15  Assuming traditional ingredients are used, printed  food can be tasty and nutritious while also requiring a  minimum of labor.  6.  Institutional cooking  3D printing for food is  currently not fast, but it is precise and repeatable. It  could lend itself to tedious tasks such as frosting  cupcakes or applying meringues, as the Focus printer  from ByFlow, a Dutch startup launched in 2009, already  has been used. Another startup, BeeHex in Silicon Valley,  envisions 3D- printed pizzas, perhaps in the shape of      Frontiers      183   the home team’s logo while fans are eating at the sports  stadium.  The  prospects  for  food  printing  appear  to  be  wide  open.  Many  existing  food  components  can  be  extruded  and then baked if necessary, such as pizza dough. Others  can be made into cereal shapes or larger custom prints  a  pancake maker already “prints” batter on the griddle to  copy an image fed into the device . Cleanliness and fresh- ness are critical, but they are easy to address if one has any  familiarity with commercial kitchens.  The  Foodini  is  a  tabletop- sized  3D  food  printer  launched in 2014 by the Natural Machines startup. It has  been used in both fine dining and hospital applications,  with  an  eye  toward  the  home  market  once  the  product  matures and the price point can drop. The choice of five  different  nozzle  sizes  means  that  stabilizers  like  malto- dextrin are not necessary, and the machine can hold five  different  ingredient  capsules.  The  company  focuses  on  healthy eating, so many fresh foods can be accommodated.  Precise pasta shapes and crackers, as thin as 0.5 mm, are  possible; the crackers are done in about twenty seconds,  while a pizza takes five minutes. The company’s founder  envisions a supermarket having a machine to create ravi- oli to order, for example.16 Much as with additive manu- facturing, customization is a major benefit of 3D printing,  so individual tastes and dietary needs should be easier to   184     chapter 7   satisfy than with the mass- production grocery model. Ex- amples include custom Christmas cookies, athlete- specific  nutrient bars, and attractive food shapes for picky young  eaters.  Clothing  There  are  many  facets  to  the  apparel  industry  and  3D  printing  is  poised  to  reinvent  several  of  them.  3D  body  scanning to determine either conformance with ready- to-  wear  clothing  or  to  generate  custom  fitted  shoes,  cloth- ing,  and  accessories  shows  great  promise.  3D  printing  of  plastic  mannequins   representing  actual  people  in  a  new  global  market,  for  example   facilitates  clothing  de- sign.  Additive  manufacturing  of  orthotics  and  footwear  insoles  has  the  potential  to  make  mass  produced  shoes  much more customizable: if the footbed fits precisely, the  base shoe model may feel comfortable. Adidas is launch- ing a mass- produced running shoe with an uncustomized  3D printed midsole  at $300 per pair  and will no doubt  be closely watched by its competitors in the multibillion-  dollar global athletic- wear industry. Buttons, zippers, and  belts could be made in a variety of designs out of a wide va- riety of materials. “Smart” clothing can be manufactured  with sensors and other circuitry embedded in the garment.  All of these developments are underway.     Frontiers      185   The most critical component in most garments, how- ever, is fabric, and it is not yet possible to additively fabri- cate comfortably draping cloth out of most polymers; one  observer described the current designs as looking and feel- ing “a lot like chain mail.”17 Once again, replicating an ex- isting fabrication technique with additive manufacturing  proves to be a poor fit: the textile industry’s move to au- tomation is hundreds of years old and has not materially  changed,  even  when  synthetic  threads  were  introduced  after World War II. The more relevant question is rather,  what can additive technologies, particularly of the multi-  material variety, do that could never be done with looms  and sewing machines?  We have already seen that protective equipment that  fits perfectly is an easy win. Whether for sports, the mili- tary,  or  civilian  first  responders,  helmets,  masks,  and  protective armor are a natural fit for the technology. The  architect Neri Oxman at the MIT Media Lab has used 3D  printing  for  everything  from  microfluidics  to  buildings;  her Anthozoa project brought a 3D- printed dress utilizing  new technology from Stratasys to Paris Fashion Week in  2013. In another of her experiments, when those multiple  materials include biofilms, the garment  made in conjunc- tion with New Balance and the Media Lab’s Tangible Media  Group  can respond to the wearer by, for example, open- ing vents to evaporate sweat.18 Finally, Ministry of Supply   186     chapter 7   is an MIT spinout exploring the frontiers of performance  fabrics, some of which utilize 3D printing techniques, in  professional attire rather than athletic wear.19  Machines, Macro and Micro  3D printing can be used, mostly in laboratory settings, at  an  extremely  small  scale  to  build  microelectronics,  mi- crofluidic devices for molecular biology research  includ- ing DNA analysis , and enzymes. Because of the need for  biomimetic materials to react to their surroundings and  evolve  over  time,  a  new  concept  is  gaining  traction:  4D  printing,  with  the  fourth  dimension  being  time.20  Ad- vances are being made in which biomaterials  hydrogels   are  programmed  to  change  shape  in  water,  for  example,  mimicking  the  behavior  of  cell  walls  in  plants.21  Such  microscopic- scale  manipulation  opens  many  new  path- ways for research and eventual commercialization in tis- sue engineering, life science research, and so- called soft  robotics.  A  related  set  of  innovations  relates  to  so- called  assembly- free parts, that is, 3D- printed parts with hinges  or  valves  built  during  additive  layering.  A  widely  cited  article  from  2004  explains  how  researchers  used  stereo- lithography  a 3D Systems SLA machine  to print a robotic      Frontiers      187   hand   palm  and  finger   with  voids  into  which  electrical  components  were  then  attached.  All  movement  in  the  device was achieved by joints that were printed without  any further assembly.22 Research continues into the vari- ous options for printing movable parts at both large and   small scales.  More  recently,  researchers  have  suspended  nanopar- ticles  of  iron  oxide   the  main  component  of  magnetic  computer  media   in  curable  polymer  “inks”  that  allow   for  the  printing  of  functional  materials  with  variable   electrical, magnetic, and mechanical properties. Such re- search aligns with other work to use 3D printing to cre- ate  circuit  elements  such  as  resistors,  capacitors,  and  inductors;23 these can often be printed on flexible media.  Nano  Dimension  has  recently  introduced  a  3D  printer   for  circuit  board  prototyping  that  should  also  be  able   to  evolve  to  certain  production  tasks.24  The  prospect  of  increasingly  “smart”  materials  that  also  embed  actua- tor  capability   either  biological  or  electromechanical   is   increasingly practical, leading to the development of new  types  of  robotic— sense– think– act— implementations.  Highly precise machines from nScrypt are being used in  a  variety  of  applications,  ranging  from  human  cells  to  electronic resistors and adhesives, suggesting that these  robots could emerge at the juncture of life science, com- puter  hardware,  materials  science,  and  other  disparate  disciplines.25  188     chapter 7   Design Technology and Skill  The range of research and innovation related to 3D print- ing  in  its  broadest  definition  is  vast.  From  the  atomic  level of both living and inorganic matter all the way up to  jumbo jets and architectural structures, the hows, whats,  and whens of making are being redefined. Inevitably, the  “who” matters a lot, too, at the skills level but also within  existing capital, legal, and organizational structures: mak- ers  of  almost  anything  can  be  located  almost  anywhere.  This changes the existing rules for everything from arms  regulation to building codes, and so far the technology’s  capabilities are outrunning ways to think about it.  As  the  shapes  and  configurations  that  can  be  made  help inform the products that should be made, designers  will discard one set of constraints for another. This transi- tion takes time and it places surprising stresses on many  other  parts  of  the  organization.  In  addition,  the  ability  to design around the limitations of additive manufactur- ing will emerge against the backdrop of experience, some  of it no doubt hard- won. Finally, much expertise will be  encoded in software, whether in generative design at the  front end of the life cycle or in machine control systems  that will take guesswork out of the management of even  complex metal builds.  As  good  as  that  software  can  become,  however,  ad- ditive  manufacturing  is  facing  a  massive  skills  shortage.      Frontiers      189   Crossing two disciplines is hard enough: to become expert  in metal printing within a factory environment requires  knowledge across a half- dozen academic disciplines plus  knowledge  of  accounting,  management,  regulation,  HR,  and  other  business- related  domains.  For  all  the  intellec- tual bootstrapping that tenacious engineers and machine  operators  have  achieved,  schools  and  universities  will  have to do better. Figure 7.1 shows one view of the skills  shortage as of 2018.  Scaling up the Technology  Regardless of domain, 3D printing needs to advance along  several vectors for the technology to see higher and better  uses:  1.  Materials science needs to generate new gels, powders,  and slurries. That is, the capabilities of 3D printing are  substantially limited by the previous generations of  building materials. This is as true of nutrient proteins as  it is of aircraft metals, and as true of mammalian cells as  it is of materials for clothing and footwear. Composites  are but one field that will improve.  2.  Multi- material printing must enter the mainstream,  whether for tissue, clothing, or food, to become practical.   190     chapter 7   The following skills are requested most frequently in  conjunction with "Additive Manufacturing" job postings    0   1,000   2,000   3,000   4,000   5,000   6,000   5,396   1,462   1,206  1,163   3D Printing   Additive Manufacturing  AM   Teamwork   Collaboration  Mechanical Engineering  Printers  SolidWorks  Prototyping  Product Development  Project Management  Machining  Teaching  Computer Numerical Control  CNC   Manufacturing Processes  3D Modeling   Design  Robotics  Budgeting  Scheduling  Repair  Materials Science  Rapid Prototyping  Mechanical Design  Computer Aided Drafting Design  CAD   Customer Service  Product Design  Experiments  C++   973  913  826  791  671  667  648  615  594  557  551  508  507  498  488  463  441  427  398  391  370   Figure 7.1  Skills shortages reported by Burning Glass Technologies as of  2018.     Frontiers      191   In industrial scenarios, expect to see many more  functionally graded materials.  3.  Capital investment is limited in some cases by mass  production business models and thus financial modeling  assumptions. As we saw at GE, even a massive success  had to be hidden from finance and accounting because it  didn’t fit existing expectations. For mass customization  at enterprise scale, everything from material  procurement to customer service must be redesigned.  The resulting period of upheaval, trial and error, and new  winners and losers  both inside the company and in an  existing industry  will be disorienting.  4.  Talent is scarce, both inside the educational pipeline  and inside the world’s factories: on shop floors, in  labs, in new- product development, and in production  engineering.  5.  3D printers have to improve in their build volume,  in their predictability, in their reliability, and in their  flexibility. For some manufacturers, this might require  altering the “black box” business model of closed  hardware and or resupply.  6.  Enterprise information systems are not premised on  mass customization, on production processes that can  generate gigabytes of data in a few hours, or on lot sizes  of one.  192     chapter 7   7.  Entire ecosystems will be reset. Parts consolidation  can mean a substantial reduction in the supplier base.  The location of final or intermediate production is  freed from many geographic and historical constraints.  Testing, validation, and regulation of this new class of  technologies may well be performed by new entities,  or old entities with dramatically new remits. The sales  channel for mass customization may be entirely new,  with all that implies.  All  of  these  developments  are  in  process,  some  hap- pening faster than others. With so many wild cards, pre- dicting anything with certainty is unwise  as the industry  learned through hard experience after 2014’s stock mar- ket  peaks .  In  addition,  because  3D  printing  is  in  its   essence  decentralized,  keeping  abreast  of  any  one  do- main gets more difficult every year. One thing is sure: the   demand for what additive manufacturing can create will  not be shrinking any time soon.     Frontiers      193    8  CONCLUSION  It should be clear that the combination of robotic preci- sion, computer graphics’ design freedom, algorithmic vet- ting, and expanded human experience is leading to many  new  possibilities  for  people  to  make  things.  Old  shapes  can be made with less lead time and or closer to the point  of use, new shapes become possible, and new materials   whether  metals,  plastics,  proteins,  or  concrete  formula- tions  can be used after being impossible or overlooked.  Much of the news is good.  The luxury eyewear market includes several vendors  selling 3D- printed frames; one such company is Monoqool,  headquartered  near  Copenhagen,  that  sells  super- light   10  gram   frames  with  screwless  hinges.1  In  pharmaceu- ticals,  Aprecia  received  FDA  approval  for  its  3D- printed  pill called Spritam, which is able to dissolve extremely fast  when patients take it for epilepsy and related conditions.    It is the first commercially available drug to be manufac- tured via 3D printing,2 but the prospect of printed medi- cine  raises  the  prospect  of  both  personalized  pills  and  easy counterfeiting. A restaurant in London called Food  Ink is 3D printing all menu items and features 3D- printed  cutlery and furniture.3 American Standard is selling high-  end bathroom fixtures that are produced using additive  manufacturing. The DVX line includes a subset devoted to  designs that could not be manufactured using traditional  techniques; prices are in the $17,000 range in 2018.4  The variety of these examples illustrates several key  concepts. First, innovation is occurring in many domains,  some  such as epilepsy medication  with great potential to  improve human welfare. The low price of desktop printers  that readily can be both obtained and modified lowers the  barrier to many forms of experimentation and connects a  wider variety of people with tools that can realize their vi- sions. Decentralizing the productive infrastructure helps  move manufacturing closer to particular markets. All of  this should accelerate innovation.  Second, there is room for improvement when it comes  to customer markets. A price of $17,000 is stunning for  a bathroom faucet, and Adidas runs a risk in pricing the  Futurecraft shoe at $300. Build speed is also slower than  desired in everything from aircraft part fabrication to the  food at experimental restaurants. Learning to print more  than one drug compound will take years.  196     chapter 8   Finally,  these  early  attempts  at  broad  markets  still  don’t address the true strengths of additive manufactur- ing. High- fashion eyeglasses or faucets are clever but don’t  solve a real problem  the way 3D- printed hearing aids do .  What is the path from fast- dissolving pills to custom for- mulations? Will 3D- printed food at a trendy restaurant re- duce food waste, help address malnutrition, or otherwise  feed the hungry?  There is much to learn, and much that is overhyped.  Optimal alloys and polymers have yet to be designed spe- cifically  for  additive  methods.  Design  skill  and  design  toolboxes   software,  hardware,  and  fabrication  exper- tise   are  still  in  scarce  supply:  many  successful  additive  manufacturing stories were not “born digital,” but were  carried  over  from  a  prior  design manufacturing  regime.  The  “printing”  metaphor  obscures  many  realities  of  digital fabrication: the roles of support structures, post-  processing,  and  complementary  technologies  such  as  CNC tooling do not figure into most of 3D- printing ste- reotypes. Changeover costs  between metals in particular   on the same machine can run into thousands of dollars,  whether  for  an  additional  sifter,  a  fresh  bed  of  powder,  new  filters,  different  gas  in  the  chamber,  or  just  a  thor- ough cleaning of the entire build chain. Inventory levels  can certainly drop, but metal or engineered plastic pow- der can cost 10× or 100× its solid equivalent. Mixed ma- terial printing may be fun with different color filaments      conclusion      197   on  a  toy- doll  head,  but  it  remains  rare  in  production   applications.  At the edges of research, printing human tissue and  printing human organs are very different things; only the  former is even remotely possible in 2018. For millions of  urban migrants to live in 3D- printed housing, many things  will need to happen: banks will lend money to support a  building technology only if it is aesthetically and mechani- cally durable for decades. Structural engineers will need  to  understand  how,  why,  and  when  these  new  kinds  of  structures will fail, emit harmful gases, or support para- sitic populations, whether insects, birds, or mammals. Not  least significantly, people will want to live in and personal- ize these mass- produced dwellings: how will these houses  become homes?  These examples illustrate a larger issue: 3D printing  only rarely can operate in isolation. Whether intentional  or not, it will take years of systems thinking to approach  all the ramifications, many of which are intertwined. Here  is a brief sampling:     Where will designers learn how to make products and  shapes that exploit the strengths of additive technologies  rather than replicate what is known about subtractive  or formative  mold- based  methods, often at higher cost  and possibly with material disadvantages?  198     chapter 8      How will machine- makers design machines without  knowing the state of available build materials, whether in  tissue, polymers, nutritive proteins, or metal alloys?     How will metal- powder companies, medical supply  houses, refineries, recyclers, and the rest of the materials  supply chain optimize for build platforms that are still  being tweaked and in some cases have not yet been  invented?     How will testing agencies and certification authorities  ranging from the FAA to the FDA to the International  Building Code authority to EPA decide to regulate what  goes into and comes out of these machines, whether  waste, gases, or parts intended for some particular use?     Much like color copies of paper currency, are there  some shapes that should not be printed? Or are there  conditions  such as crime scene recreation  under which  3D printing is accepted and others where it is repugnant  or illegal? If some governing body decides that some  objects should never be printed, how is that mandate  enforced?     Who is intellectually and professionally equipped to  integrate additive manufacturing into conventional  manufacturing work flows? Where will this integration  happen first, fastest, and most successfully?     conclusion      199      For consumer- grade printers to gain a wider audience,  design and validation tools will need to get better  and more accessible. As smartphones gain traction,  meanwhile, the place of the home PC is evolving. Where  will these trends converge?     Who ultimately stands behind the structural strength  of a 3D- printed piece? The machine manufacturer?  An engineer who signs off on a design? A testing  firm, maybe similar to Underwriters Laboratories? A  validation authority such as a building inspector or  NIST?     How will adoption of 3D printing in various  countries interact with the ebbs and flows of economic  globalization? Despite 3D printing having early roots  in the United States, current leadership appears to be  dispersed, with Dutch, Japanese, and German firms  the  latter building on a powerful machine- tool industry  in  the vanguard. HP’s 3D- printer business is headquartered  in Spain. How will Chinese firms affect the overall  market?     What will be the unintended consequences?     What business models will emerge? Can machine-  makers continue to compete with their customers by  operating profitable print- to- order subsidiaries? Will   200     chapter 8   the costs of printers, inputs, or both stabilize, drop, or  possibly increase further?     Whether for assembling buildings away from earth,  synthesizing food on the journey, or fabricating tools  to fix things on the spacecraft, 3D printing figures  prominently in the proposed expansion of humanity’s  extraterrestrial presence. Will any of these scenarios ever  come to pass?  However  these  questions  are  resolved,  one  thing  re- mains  clear:  making  things  is  a  consummately  human  pursuit. This sea change in our ability to create has the po- tential to affect many, many aspects of our existence, from  life expectancy to diet to how we learn. In the end, such a  transformation in how we make will ultimately make us  different.     conclusion      201    GLOSSARY  3D printing General  term  referring  to  computer- controlled  machines  that  precisely  de- posit minute qualities of matter, sequentially, to form recognizable shapes.  4D printing Term coined by MIT researcher Skylar Tibbits to refer to 3D printed matter  that, over time  the 4th D  reshapes itself in response to water, light, or other  stimuli.  Additive manufacturing Essentially the same as 3D printing but in an industrial milieu.  Binder jetting 3D printing variant that relies on binder  adhesive  rather than intense heat to  hold, for example, sand in precise shapes. Heat is frequently used in secondary  processes such as sintering or infiltration.  Bioprinting An emerging class of technologies looking to assemble components of tissue  with extruders and other 3D printing technologies, sometimes using live cells  suspended in a hydrogel.  Build The outcome of a set of layer- by- layer depositions of material as directed by  a computer file.  CAD Computer Assisted Design software, frequently the origin of a 3D printed part.  One alternative is to 3D scan an existing thing and replicate it.  Composite A material made up of different material, such as plastic filament infused with  carbon fibers.   DMLM Direct Metal Laser Melting is a 3D printing technology used for powder- bed  fabrication in which the metal is fully melted into a tiny liquid pool, distinct  from DMLS.  DMLS Direct Metal Laser Sintering only partially melts the metal powder particles  into more of a jelly than a fully liquid state. See DMLM.  Filament Strings of thermoplastic polymers fed into several varieties of 3D printers.  FDM Fused Deposition Modeling is a proprietary term owned by Stratasys to refer  to extrusion- based 3D printing, often in consumer- grade machines.  FFF Fused Filament Fabrication is a generic term referring to the same techniques  indicated by FDM.  Material jetting Hundreds of microscopic jets deposit photopolymers under computer control  in full color and with very high surface quality but relatively low structural  strength.  Powder Plastic, ceramic, or metal  both pure and alloys  that is laid down in precisely  thin layers by a wiper to provide both feedstock for fusing and support for  the build in process. Excess material is removed at the end of a build using  compressed air.  Reverse engineering The process whereby the design information for an existing part that lacks  digital documentation is recreated, often via some form of 3D scanning.  SLA Stereolithography  Apparatus  was  the  original  additive  manufacturing  tech- nique, developed and commercialized in the late 1980s. It uses light- sensitive  resins fused in thin layers by various forms of light.  204     GLOSSARY   SLM Selective Laser Melting is a variety of DMLM when applied to pure metals  rather than alloys.  SLS Selective Laser Sintering can be applied to metals as well as to glass, polymers,  and ceramics. As in DMLS, the powder is not fully melted.  Support structure In both polymer and metal builds, support structures are pieces extraneous to  the final shape that are necessary for either supporting a horizontal element  during the build and or to help conduct heat to the build platform to prevent  warping and other forms of thermal distortion.  Topology optimization A  software  process  whereby  an  existing  structure  is  given  new,  reduced  shape s  through the mathematic elimination of material that is not essential  to the part’s function and context.

The use of 3D printing—digitally controlled additive manufacturing—is growing rapidly. Consumer models of 3D printers allow people to fabricate small plastic objects, from cabinet knobs to wedding cake toppers. Industrial uses are becoming widespread, as businesses use the technology to fabricate prototypes, spare parts, custom-fitted prosthetics, and other plastic or metal items, often at lower cost and with greater efficiency than standard manufacturing. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, John Jordan offers an accessible introduction to 3D printing, describing the printing process, industrial and household markets, and emerging uses. Jordan outlines the stages of 3D printing, from idea to software model to a printable file that slices the planned object into printable layers to the finished object itself. He describes additive technologies, consumer 3D printing in homes and schools, mass customization (which can create tens of millions of unique items), and industrial uses. Jordan explains that although 3D printers have not become the ubiquitous home appliance once predicted, they are making inroads into mass markets; and he discusses the business factors that may hinder industry adoption of 3D printing technologies. He considers the possible unintended consequences of 3D printing on jobs, as companies scramble to find employees with an uncommon skill set; on business models and supply chains, as manufacturing is decentralized; and on patent law, as machines can be programmed to copy protected property. Finally, Jordan looks at new and emerging uses, including bioprinting, building construction, and micromachines
