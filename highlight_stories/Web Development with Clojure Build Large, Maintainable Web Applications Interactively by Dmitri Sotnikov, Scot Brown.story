ß  Under  Construction:    The  book  you’re  reading  is  still  under  development. As part of our Beta book program, we’re releasing this copy well before a normal book would be released. That way you’re able to get this content a couple of months before it’s available in finished form, and we’ll get feedback to make the book even better. The idea is that everyone wins!  Be warned:  The book has not had a full technical edit, so it will contain errors. It has not been copyedited, so it will be full of typos, spelling mistakes, and the occasional creative piece of grammar. And there’s been no effort spent doing layout, so you’ll find bad page breaks, over-long code lines, incorrect hyphen- ation, and all the other ugly things that you wouldn’t expect to see in a finished book. It also doesn't have an index. We can’t be held liable if you use this book to try to create a spiffy application and you somehow end up with a strangely shaped farm implement instead. Despite all this, we think you’ll enjoy it!  Download Updates:  Throughout this process you’ll be able to get updated ebooks from your account at pragprog.com my_account. When the book is com- plete, you’ll get the final version  and subsequent updates  from the same ad- dress.  Send us your feedback:  In the meantime, we’d appreciate you sending us your feedback on this book at pragprog.com titles dswdcloj3 errata, or by using the links at the bottom of each page.

We chose it to represent elegance and simplicity, because these qualities make Clojure such an attractive lan- guage. A good software project is like a bonsai. You have to meticulously craft it to take the shape you want, and the tool you use should make it a pleasant experience. We hope to convince you here that Clojure is that tool.  What You Need  This book is aimed at readers of all levels. While having some basic proficiency with  functional  programming  will  be  helpful,  it’s  by  no  means  required  to follow the material in this book. If you’re not a Clojure user already, this book is  a  good  starting  point  since  it  focuses  on  applying  the  language  to  solve concrete problems. This means we’ll focus on the small set of language features needed to build web applications.  Why Clojure?  Clojure is a small language whose primary goals are simplicity and correctness. As a functional language, it emphasizes immutability and declarative program- ming. As you’ll see in this book, these features make it easy and idiomatic to write clean and correct code.  Web development has many languages to choose from and as many opinions on what makes a language ‘good.’ Some languages are simple but verbose. You’ve probably heard people say that verbosity doesn’t matter — that if two languages are Turing complete, anything that can be written in one language can  also  be  written  in  the  other  with  a  bit  of  extra  code.  We  think  that’s missing the point.  The real question is not whether something can be expressed in principle; it’s how well the language maps to the problem being solved. One language lets you think in terms of your problem domain, while another forces you to translate the problem to its constructs.  report erratum     discuss   Introduction   xiv  The latter is often tedious and rarely enjoyable. You end up writing a lot of boilerplate code and constantly repeating yourself. There’s a certain irony in having to write repetitive code.  At the other extreme, some languages are concise because they provide many different  tools  for  solving  problems.  Unfortunately,  this  vast  array  of  tools brings different problems.  The more features a language has, the more things you have to keep in your head to work with the language effectively. Soon, we find ourselves constantly expending mental overhead thinking about all the different features and how they interact with one another.  What  really  matters  is  whether  you  can  use  a  language  without  thinking about it. When a language is lacking in expressiveness, you become acutely aware  that  you’re  writing  code  that  you  shouldn’t  be.  On  the  other  hand, when  a  language  has  too  many  features,  it  can  feel  overwhelming  and  it’s easy to get distracted playing with them.  To  make  an  analogy  with  mathematics,  understanding  a  few  fundamental theorems and their implications is far more useful than rote memorization of specific formulas.  This is where Clojure comes in. It allows us to easily derive a solution to a particular problem from a small set of general patterns. All you need to become productive is to learn a few simple concepts and a bit of syntax. These concepts can then be combined in myriad ways to solve all kinds of problems.  Why Make Web Apps in Clojure?  Clojure boasts tens of thousands of users across hundreds of companies; it’s used in a wide range of settings, including banks and hospitals. Clojure is likely the most popular Lisp dialect today for starting new development. It has proven itself in serious production systems, and the feedback from users has been overwhelmingly positive.  Because  web  development  is  one  of  the  major  domains  for  using  Clojure, several popular libraries and frameworks have sprouted and matured in this area. In this book we’ll primarily focus on the Luminus stack. The following chapters will teach you how to use Clojure and Luminus to build web appli- cations effectively.  Many platforms are available for doing web development, so why should you choose Clojure over other options?  report erratum     discuss   Why Make Web Apps in Clojure?   xv  Well, consider those options. Many popular platforms force you to make trade- offs. Some platforms lack performance, others require a lot of boilerplate, and others lack the infrastructure necessary for real-world applications.  Clojure addresses the questions of performance and infrastructure by being a hosted language. The Java Virtual Machine  JVM  is a mature and highly performant environment with great tooling and deployment options. Clojure brings  expressive  power  akin  to  that  of  Ruby  and  Python  to  this  excellent platform. When working with Clojure you won’t have to worry about being limited by your runtime when your application grows.  Additionally, Clojure isn’t limited to the server. It can be compiled into Java- Script that is on par with popular front-end frameworks. Most web platforms require to learn and write JavaScript as well. With Clojure, you have a common toolset for both client and server.  The  most  common  way  to  handle  the  boilerplate  in  web  applications  is  by using  a  framework.  Examples  include  Ruby  on  Rails,  Django,  and  Spring. The frameworks provide the canned functionality needed for building a modern site.  The  benefits  these  frameworks  offer  also  come  with  inherent  costs.  Since many operations are done implicitly, you have to memorize what effects any action might have. This opaqueness makes your code more difficult to reason about. When you need to do something that is at odds with the framework’s design, it can quickly become awkward and difficult. You might have to dive deep  into  the  internals  of  that  framework  and  hack  around  the  expected behaviors.  Instead of using frameworks, Clojure makes a number of powerful libraries available, and we can put these libraries together in a way that makes sense for our particular project. As you’ll see, we manage to avoid having to write boilerplate while retaining the code clarity we desire. As you read on, we think you’ll agree that this model has clear advantages over the framework-based approach.  Our goal is to give you both a solid understanding of the Clojure web stack and the expertise to quickly and easily build web applications using it. The following chapters will guide you all the way from setting up your development environment to creating a complete real-world application. We will show you what’s available and then guide you in structuring your application using the current best practices.  report erratum     discuss   Introduction   xvi  How to Read This Book  Before you get started, we should cover some conventions used in this book.  Throughout the book, we iteratively improve the applications we’re working on with instructiveness as our primary goal. You’ll see the top-level directory of files change periodically. This is intentional and is done to provide different stages of development for a single app. We recommend working along with your  own  version  of  the  application  and  trying  different  variations  of  the examples provided in the book. This will help you to get a feel for how things work,  and  what  alternatives  are  possible  to  what  we  present  here.  If  you encounter any issues you can compare your code against our version. The source code used throughout the book can be found on the Pragmatic Pro- gramming website.1  We strongly recommend experimentation in the REPL. This is by far the best way to develop your skill with Clojure.  1.  https:  pragprog.com titles dswdcloj3 web-development-with-clojure-third-edition   report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 1  Getting Your Feet Wet  In  the  Introduction,  on  page  xiii,  we  looked  at  some  of  the  benefits  of  the functional style when it comes to writing applications. Of course, you can’t learn a language by just reading about it. To really get a feel for it, you have to write some code yourself.  In  this  chapter  you’ll  dive  right  in  and  build  a  guestbook  application  that allows users to leave messages for one another. You’ll see the basic structure of a web application, set up necessary tools for effective Clojure development, and  get  a  feel  for  how  web  development  in  Clojure  works.  If  you’re  new  to Clojure,  we  recommend  you  read  through  Appendix  1,  Clojure  Primer,  on page 361 for a crash course on the basic concepts and syntax.  The material we’ll cover in this book is based on our experience and personal preferences. It’s worth noting that there are other equally valid approaches to structuring Clojure web applications. The libraries and methodologies that we’ll  cover  each  have  alternatives,  but  they  will  provide  you  with  a  solid starting  point.  As  your  familiarity  with  the  Clojure  ecosystem  grows  we encourage you to evaluate different libraries and choose the ones that best suit your needs.  Set Up Your Environment  Clojure is distributed as a JAR  Java Archive file  that you’ll need on your project’s classpath. Clojure requires the Java Virtual Machine  JVM  to run, and you’ll need a working Java Development Kit  JDK , version 1.9 or higher.1 You’ll  also  need  to  have  Leiningen  installed  in  order  to  work  with  clojure projects.2  1. 2.  https:  openjdk.java.net install index.html http:  leiningen.org   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   2  Managing Projects with Leiningen  Leiningen lets you create, build, test, package, and deploy your projects. In other words, it’s your one-stop shop for all your project-management needs.  Leiningen is the Clojure counterpart of Maven,3 a popular Java build tool. It uses a Maven-compatible dependency management system, so it has access to large and well-maintained repositories of Java libraries. In addition, Clojure libraries  are  commonly  found  in  the  Clojars  repository.4  This  repository  is enabled by default in Leiningen.  With Leiningen, you don’t need to worry about manually downloading all the libraries for your project. Specifying the top-level dependencies will cause any libraries that they depend on to be pulled in automatically.  Leiningen is available as a package for many Linux distributions as well via Homebrew on MacOS. If Leiningen is not packaged on your system then it can  be  installed  using  the  installation  script  found  on  the  official  project page:5  $ wget https:  raw.github.com technomancy leiningen stable bin lein ...

The default template is intended for library projects, not applications. To see other templates  app, plugin, etc , try `lein help new`.  --.-KB s  12.17K  in 0s  Note that the preceding code expects that ~ bin is available on the shell path. Since we’re running lein for the first time, it will install itself. If the installation was successful, we should now have a brand new project in the myapp folder. Let’s take a moment to look at what we’ve created inside myapp . Leiningen generated a skeleton application here based on the default template. The source code for the application can be found in the src folder. Here we have another  3. 4. 5.  http:  maven.apache.org  https:  clojars.org  http:  leiningen.org install  report erratum     discuss   folder called myapp containing a single source file named core.clj. This file has the following code inside:  Managing Projects with Leiningen   3  myapp src myapp core.clj  ns myapp.core   defn foo  "I don't do a whole lot." [x]  println x "Hello, World!"    Note that the namespace declaration matches the folder structure. Since the core namespace is inside the myapp folder, its name is myapp.core.  What’s in a Leiningen Project File? Inside the myapp project folder, we have a project.clj file. This file contains the description  of  our  application.  The  project  configuration  is  represented declaratively using regular Clojure data structures. It contains the application name, version, URL, license, and dependencies.  myapp project.clj  defproject myapp "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"  :description "FIXME: write description" :url "http:  example.com FIXME" :license {:name "EPL-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Classpath-exception-2.0"  :url "https:  www.eclipse.org legal epl-2.0 "}  :dependencies [[org.clojure clojure "1.10.1"]] :repl-options {:init-ns myapp.core}   The project.clj file allows us to manage many different aspects of our application. One thing we can try is adding :main. This option sets a function as the entry point for the application. Let’s try setting the :main key to the foo function from the myapp.core namespace:  myapp project.clj  defproject myapp "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"  :description "FIXME: write description" :url "http:  example.com FIXME" :license {:name "EPL-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Classpath-exception-2.0"  :url "https:  www.eclipse.org legal epl-2.0 "}  :dependencies [[org.clojure clojure "1.10.1"]] ;;this will set foo as the main function :main myapp.core foo :repl-options {:init-ns myapp.core}   Let’s run our application using lein run and see what happens. Remember that the foo function expects an argument, so we’ll have to give it one.  $ cd myapp  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   4  $ lein run Obligatory Obligatory Hello, World!  Our app runs! The :main key is just one of many configuration options in a leiningen project. You’ll encounter many more leiningen options throughout this book.  Build Your First Web App  In the preceding example we used the default Leiningen template to create a very simple application that has only one dependency: the Clojure runtime. If you used this as the base for a web application, then you’d have to write a lot of boilerplate to get it up and running. Let’s see how we can use a different Leiningen template to create a web-application project with all the boilerplate already set up.  Our  primary  goal  here  is  to  get  a  high-level  understanding  of  the  project structure and get something working. We’ll gloss over some of the finer details in order to maintain our momentum. Don’t worry if you don’t fully understand all the steps at this point. We’ll get into the details in subsequent chapters.  Creating an Application from the Luminus Template  A template is used to generate a skeleton project from certain parameters, such as the project name, or which database to use. Many different templates exist to quickly create different kinds of projects. Later on we’ll even see how we can create templates ourselves. The Luminus template6 provides a good base and we’ll use it this time.  We can specify a template by placing it after lein new  e.g. lein new my-template my- app .  Any  additional  parameters  will  be  passed  in  as  the  arguments  to  the selected template.  Let’s create a new application by specifying luminus as the template name and guestbook as the project name. We’ll add the +h2 parameter to indicate that we want to have an instance of the h27 embedded database initialized, and the +http-kit parameter to indicate that we want to use the http-kit8 web server. We’ll also specify the version of the template that we want to use explicitly to ensure that the projects you generate are exactly the same as the ones used in this book. Otherwise, Leiningen will default to the latest available version  6. 7. 8.  http:  www.luminusweb.net  http:  www.h2database.com html main.html http:  http-kit.github.io  report erratum     discuss   Build Your First Web App   5  of the luminus template. You can find the version of Luminus used to generate a project in the generated README.md.  $ lein new luminus guestbook Generating a Luminus project.  --template-version 3.91 -- +h2 +http-kit  To generate a new project using the latest version of the template, we would simply omit --template-version 3.91 -- from the arguments.  What’s in a Web App  This type of application needs to start up a web server in order to run. Since Clojure development is best done interactively, the first thing to do is open a terminal in our project’s root directory and start the REPL:  $ cd . guestbook $ lein repl Retrieving ...  The first run may take a little while because Leiningen first has to retrieve all of its dependencies. Once downloaded, the dependencies are cached locally in  the ~ .m2 repository  folder  and  will  be  available  on  subsequent  runs.  After the dependencies are downloaded, you should see the following output in the console:  nREPL server started on port XXX on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl:  127.0.0.1:XXX REPL-y 0.4.4, nREPL 0.8.3 Clojure 1.10.1 OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.8+10 Docs:  doc function-name-here    find-doc "part-of-name-here"   Source:  source function-name-here  Javadoc:  javadoc java-object-or-class-here   Exit: Control+D or  exit  or  quit   Results: Stored in vars *1, *2, *3, an exception in *e user=>  The REPL will put us in the user namespace by default. This namespace is located in env dev clj user.clj. This namespace, along with the rest of env dev  is reserved for any development code that we wouldn’t want to package in our application.

Before we do anything, we should start our application like so:  guestbook.env -  luminus.http-server - starting HTTP server on port 3000  ;;timestamp prefixes have been removed from log statements for brevity user=>  start  ;INFO ;-=[guestbook started successfully using the development profile]=- ;INFO ;{:started ["'guestbook.config env" ; ; ; ; user=>  "'guestbook.db.core *db*" "'guestbook.handler init-app" "'guestbook.handler app-routes" "'guestbook.core http-server"]}  You’ll  notice  that  the  output  from  running  the start  function  indicates  that various components such as the environment configuration, database, and the HTTP server have been started. We can open a new browser window and navigate to http:  localhost:3000 to see the home page of our application.  This is the default luminus homepage. It has some useful documentation on the structure of a luminus application.  Now that we’ve created our application and tested that it’s working, let’s take a look at the directory structure that’s been generated for us.  $ tree -d guestbook guestbook ├── env │ │ │ │ │ │ │  ├── dev │ │ │ ├── prod │ │  ├── clj │  ├── clj │ └── resources  └── guestbook  └── guestbook  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1.

We’ll learn what all the pieces are for as we build different applications throughout the book. For now, we’ll just take a quick overview of how the project is structured and what files go where.  The majority of our code lives under the src folder. This folder contains a clj folder that’s reserved for Clojure source files. Since our application is called guestbook, this is the root namespace for the project. The application is further broken down into different namespaces based on function. We’ll explore each of  these  in  detail  in  Chapter  3,  Luminus  Architecture,  on  page  55.  The namespace that will be of immediate interest to us is the routes namespace. The routes namespace is reserved for defining application routes. Each route is  bound  to  a  function  that  is  responsible  for  processing  the  request  and generating the response.  The db  namespace  houses  database-related  logic  and  serves  as  the  model layer  for  the  application.  The  guestbook.db.core  namespace  contains  logic  for defining queries and managing the database connection.  The other folder that will be relevant for our application is the resources folder. It contains all the static assets associated with the application. These include  report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   9  HTML templates, CSS styles, and so on. Since we created a database for the app, it also contains a migrations folder with the SQL migration files.  Refine Your App  OK, enough with the overview. Let’s write some code.  Managing Database Migrations  The first thing that we’ll need to do is to initialize the database. The template generates two example migration files in the resources migrations folder. Note that the date on your files will be different since it’s set to the date the application was instantiated. Let’s delete the files generated by the template before pro- ceeding.  $ rm resources migrations *  Next, let’s see how to add migrations that are appropriate for our application. New pairs of migration files can be generated from the REPL by running the create-migration function:  user=>  create-migration "guestbook"  nil user=>  A common beginner error that you may encounter is forgetting to start the database connection. If you do get this error, don’t worry, just run  start  and try again. In fact, any error that mentions mount.core.DerefableState is probably due to forgetting to run  start . The create-migration function creates a pair of migration files, one for updating the  database  and  another  for  rolling  back  the  changes.  These  files  should look something like the following:  resources migrations 20180903223633-guestbook.up.sql resources migrations 20180903223633-guestbook.down.sql  The generated migration files are prefixed with the timestamp, followed by the name we provided and suffixed with the type of migration that they repre- sent. Let’s place the following SQL statement in the  ‘up’ migration file. We want to store the messages along with the name of the author and a timestamp indicating when the message was written. Let’s also create an autogenerated ID column to keep track of the messages.  guestbook resources migrations 20180903223633-guestbook.up.sql CREATE TABLE guestbook  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR 30 ,  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   10  message VARCHAR 200 , timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ;  Put this statement to delete the guestbook table in the ‘down’ migration file.  guestbook resources migrations 20180903223633-guestbook.down.sql DROP TABLE guestbook;  Let’s create the guestbook database table using the migrate function:  migratus.core - Starting migrations migratus.database - creating migration table 'schema_migrations'  user=>  migrate  ;... INFO ;... INFO ;... DEBUG migratus.migrations - Looking for migrations in object[...] ;... INFO ;... INFO ;... DEBUG migratus.migration.sql - found 1 up migrations ;...

Our next step is to write the queries to create and read messages.  Querying the Database  Luminus defaults to using HugSQL9 to interact with the database. SQL tem- plate files are used by the HugSQL library to automatically create database access functions.  9.  https:  www.hugsql.org   report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   11  Our  project  contains  a  file  called  resources sql queries.sql.  This  file  is  already populated with some sample query templates. The function names are specified using the -- :name comment followed by hints indicating the type of query, and the parameters are prefixed with a :. The -- :doc comment is used to generate the documentation metadata for the function. HugSQL has some advanced features  not  shown  here,  but  otherwise,  queries  are  written  using  regular SQL syntax.10  The generated queries aren’t very useful to us, so let’s replace them with new ones that allow us to work with the tables we just created. We’d like to be able to save messages in our database, so let’s create a query called save-mes- sage!.  Note  that  the  name  ends  with !,  by  convention  this  indicates  that  it mutates data. We also need a query to retrieve stored messages. Let’s call it get-messages.  guestbook resources sql queries.sql -- :name save-message! :! :n -- :doc creates a new message using the name and message keys INSERT INTO guestbook  name, message  VALUES  :name, :message  -- :name get-messages :? :* -- :doc selects all available messages SELECT * from guestbook  Notice that the save-message! query name is followed by :! and :n flags. The first flag  indicates  the  query  is  destructive.  The  second  flag  indicates  that  the query returns the number of affected rows.  The get-messages query uses the :? flag to indicate that the query does a select, and the :* flag indicates that multiple rows are returned. The guestbook.db.core namespace contains a call to the conman.core bind-connection macro. This macro reads the SQL queries that we defined and creates Clojure functions that perform the queries on the bound database connection using the name specified in the -- :name comment.  guestbook src clj guestbook db core.clj  conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"   Now that we have our data layer set up, we can try querying it to make sure that everything works correctly. The entirety of the guestbook.db.core namespace looks as follows:  10. https:  www.hugsql.org detail  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   12  guestbook src clj guestbook db core.clj  ns guestbook.db.core   :require  [next.jdbc.date-time] [next.jdbc.result-set] [conman.core :as conman] [mount.core :refer [defstate]] [guestbook.config :refer [env]]     defstate ^:dynamic *db*  :start  conman connect! {:jdbc-url  env :database-url }  :stop  conman disconnect! *db*     conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"   extend-protocol next.jdbc.result-set ReadableColumn  java.sql.Timestamp  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Timestamp v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Timestamp v _2 _3]   .toLocalDateTime v     .toLocalDateTime v    java.sql.Date  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Date v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Date v _2 _3]   .toLocalDate v     .toLocalDate v    java.sql.Time  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Time v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Time v _2 _3]   .toLocalTime v     .toLocalTime v     The database connection is specified using a map that’s passed to the con- man connect! function. It is populated with the database connection specification. The :database-url environment variable is used to provide the connection URL for the database. This variable is populated in the dev-config.edn file found in the root of the project.  The dev-config.edn file contains information about the local environment that’s not meant to be checked into the shared code repository. Database connection parameters are an example of such environment variables. The contents of the file look as follows:  guestbook dev-config.edn {:dev true :port 3000 ;; when :nrepl-port is set the application starts the nREPL server on load :nrepl-port 7000 :database-url "jdbc:h2:. guestbook_dev.db"}  report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   13  The :database-url environment URL specifies that the database is stored in a file called guestbook_dev.db  in  the  path  where  the  application  is  run.  In  our  case this will be the root folder of the project.  Back in the guestbook.db.core namespace, the state of the database is stored in the *db* variable. The state of the database is managed by the Mount library.11 We’ll  take  a  closer  look  at  managing  the  life  cycle  of  stateful  resources  in Chapter 3, Luminus Architecture, on page 55.  The queries that we just wrote are bound to functions using the bind-connection macro when the namespace is loaded. The generated functions will automat- ically use the connection stored in the *db* variable.  The functions generated by the macro accept the parameter map representing the  dynamic  query  variables  as  their  arguments.  Since  the  queries  are parameterized, any variables we pass in are sanitized to prevent SQL injection.  As we learned earlier, the REPL starts in the user namespace. We’ll switch to the guestbook.db.core namespace where the query functions are defined:  user=>  in-ns 'guestbook.db.core  namespace[guestbook.db.core] guestbook.db.core=>  Next, we’ll reload the query functions by running the following command:  guestbook.db.core=>  conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"  {:snips {}, :fns {:save-message! {:meta {:doc "creates a new message using the name and message keys", :command :!, :result :n, :file "sql queries.sql", :line 1}, :fn function[conman.core try-query fn--14027 fn--14028]}, :get-messages {:meta {:doc "selects all available messages", :command :?, :result :*, :file "sql queries.sql", :line 6}, :fn function[conman.core try-query fn--14027 fn--14028]}}}  guestbook.db.core=>  11. https:  github.com tolitius mount  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   14  We can see that the output from running conman bind-connection is a map keyed on the names that we used to define the queries in the queries.sql file earlier. The database should now be ready to use, and we can try running the queries we just wrote:  ;;Let's check if we have any existing data: guestbook.db.core=>  get-messages     ;;We don't have any messages, so let's create one: guestbook.db.core=>  save-message! {:name "Bob" :message "Hello, World"}  1 ;;Finally, let's check that our message was created: guestbook.db.core=>  get-messages   {:id 1, :name "Bob", :message "Hello, World", :timestamp "..."}  guestbook.db.core=>  As you can see, it’s possible to do most tasks against the running instance of the application. While you used the REPL from the terminal in this instance, we  highly  recommended  that  you  use  a  Clojure  editor  that  allows  you  to connect to the REPL going forward. That way you’ll be able to evaluate any code as you’re writing it.  There are a few cases where you will need to restart the application. The most common reason is when you’re adding new dependencies to the project, as those  can’t  be  loaded  dynamically  by  the  JVM.  Restarting  may  be  slow sometimes, but it also gives you a clean slate. If you feel like you’ve gotten your REPL into a bad state and things are behaving unexpectedly, restarting is a good sanity check.  Creating Tests  Now that we’ve tested the database operations in the REPL, it’s a good idea to create some tests for them. The project already comes with some default test operations defined. These are found in the test folder of the application. The database tests are in the test clj guestbook db core_teset.clj file. The current tests are defined with the generated users table in mind. Since we’ve changed our table structure, let’s replace it with the following test:  guestbook test clj guestbook db core_test.clj  ns guestbook.db.core-test   :require [guestbook.db.core :refer [*db*] :as db] [java-time.pre-java8] [luminus-migrations.core :as migrations] [clojure.test :refer :all] [next.jdbc :as jdbc] [guestbook.config :refer [env]]  report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   15  [mount.core :as mount]     use-fixtures  :once  fn [f]   mount start 'guestbook.config env 'guestbook.db.core *db*   migrations migrate ["migrate"]  select-keys env [:database-url]    f      deftest test-messages   jdbc with-transaction [t-conn *db* {:rollback-only true}]   is  = 1  db save-message!  t-conn {:name "Bob" :message "Hello, World"} {:connection t-conn}      is  = {:name "Bob"  :message "Hello, World"}  ->  db get-messages t-conn {}    first   select-keys [:name :message]        Run this command in the project folder to ensure our tests are passing:  migratus.core - Starting migrations migratus.database - creating migration table 'schema_migrations'  migratus.core - Running up for [20180903223633] migratus.core - Up 20180903223633-guestbook  $ lein test lein test guestbook.db.core-test INFO INFO DEBUG migratus.migrations - Looking for migrations in object[...] INFO INFO DEBUG migratus.migration.sql - found 1 up migrations DEBUG migratus.database - marking 20180903223633 complete INFO lein test guestbook.handler-test Ran 2 tests containing 4 assertions. 0 failures, 0 errors. $  migratus.core - Ending migrations  You might have noticed that the project folder contains two configuration files called dev-config.edn and test-config.edn. As you may have guessed, the dev-config.edn file is used for the development configuration, while test-config.edn is used for testing. When Leiningen runs the tests, the program will use the test config- uration so that the development database will not be affected. Configuration is selected using the :jvm-opts flag found in :project dev and :project test profiles in the project.clj file. When deploying applications to a production environment,  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   16  a  similar  pattern  is  used  to  prevent  development  from  altering  production data.  Now that we have some tests, we can use a Leiningen plugin called lein-test- refresh12 to run them automatically any time we update the code in the project. This plugin is part of the Luminus template, so all we have to do is open a new terminal and run the following command:  $ lein test-refresh ********************************************* *************** Running tests *************** ... Ran 2 tests containing 4 assertions. 0 failures, 0 errors. Passed all tests Finished at HH:mm:ss.SSS  run time: 0.596s   We can now keep an eye on this terminal to make sure that all our tests are passing whenever we make changes to the code or add new tests. This provides us with an automated sanity check that we haven’t broken anything.  Developing functionality using the REPL and then generating tests is a com- mon workflow in Clojure. This approach provides a faster feedback loop than Test  Driven  Development   TDD   since  we  don’t  have  to  constantly  switch between tests and code while developing a feature. Instead, the development can be done interactively using the REPL. Once the feature works as intended, we can take the code from the REPL session and turn it into unit tests for this feature to ensure future changes do not break intended behavior.  Defining HTTP Routes  We’ve now confirmed that we’re able to store and retrieve the messages from the  database,  and  we’ve  written  tests  to  make  sure  we  don’t  have  any regressions. Next, we’ll need to write a user interface that calls these functions. We’ll create HTTP endpoints and have these call the function that corresponds to  the  user’s  intended  action.  The  endpoints  are  commonly  referred  to  as routes, and the route that renders the home page for our application is found in the guestbook.routes.home namespace.  guestbook-base src clj guestbook routes home.clj  ns guestbook.routes.home   :require [guestbook.layout :as layout] [guestbook.db.core :as db]  12. https:  github.com jakemcc lein-test-refresh  report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   17  [clojure.java.io :as io] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.response] [ring.util.http-response :as response]     defn home-page [request]   layout render request "home.html" {:docs  -> "docs docs.md"  io resource slurp }     defn about-page [request]   layout render request "about.html"     defn home-routes []  ["" {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf  middleware wrap-formats]}  [" " {:get home-page}] [" about" {:get about-page}]]   You can see that the   route calls the home-page function that in turn renders the home.html template. You can also see that we’re passing a map of parameters to the render function; currently the only parameter being passed is the :docs key.  These  parameters  indicate  dynamic  content  that  is  injected  into  our template before it’s sent to the client. Let’s take a quick look at the contents of the resources html home.html file:  guestbook-base resources html home.html {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}    {{docsmarkdown}}    {% endblock %}  You can see that this file extends a template called base.html and renders a block called content. The parent template provides a common layout for the pages in our application, and each individual page can render the portion of the page relevant to it. If you’re familiar with Rails or Django templates, then this syntax should look very familiar. You’ll also note that the templates are set up to use Bulma CSS13 as the default scaffolding for the page layout.  The templates use a context map to populate the dynamic content. The keys in the map are used as template variables. For example, the {{docsmarkdown}} statement corresponds to the :docs key in the map that was passed to the lay- out render function by the home-page function.  13. https:  bulma.io documentation   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   18  Let’s update our resources html home.html template to display our messages. First, let’s replace {{docsmarkdown}} with a wrapper that will center and format our page nicely:  guestbook resources html home.html {% block content %}                     {% endblock %}  Then let’s add some HTML inside our wrapper that displays a list of existing messages.  Just  like  with docs,  our  messages  are  supplied  using  a  variable called messages. Each item in messages is a map containing keys called timestamp, message, and name. We iterate over the messages and create an li tag for each message inside a ul tag, like so:  guestbook resources html home.html       Messages     {% for item in messages %}          {{item.message}}    - {{item.name}}     {% endfor %}           {{item.timestampdate:"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"}}  OK, let’s go back to the guestbook.routes.home namespace and add the code to render the existing messages. Note that we already have a reference to the guestbook.db.core namespace in the ns declaration at the top of the home names- pace.  We can now update the home-page function to associate the messages with the :messages key when rendering the template.  guestbook src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn home-page [request]  report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   19   layout render request "home.html" {:messages  db get-messages }    Since we’ve already populated a message in our database during earlier testing, we should see it when we reload the page. We can now take a look at adding a form to create new messages from the page.  Now we need to create another div that will contain a form for submitting new messages. Note that we need to provide a {% csrf-field %} in our form.14 Luminus enables anti-forgery protection by default, and any POST requests that do not contain the anti-forgery token are rejected by the server.  guestbook resources html home.html          {% csrf-field %}       Name   <input class="input"  type="text" name="name" value="{{name}}"  >       Message    <textarea     class="textarea" name="message">{{message}}     <input type="submit"  class="button is-primary" value="comment"  >           Our final template should look as follows:  guestbook resources html home.html {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}    14. http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cross-site_request_forgery  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   20                Messages     {% for item in messages %}          {{item.message}}    - {{item.name}}   {{item.timestampdate:"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"}}    {% endfor %}                   {% csrf-field %}       Name   <input class="input"  type="text" name="name" value="{{name}}"  >       Message    <textarea     class="textarea" name="message">{{message}}     <input type="submit"  class="button is-primary" value="comment"  >                    report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   21  {% endblock %}  We now need to create a new route on the server, called  message, to respond to the HTTP POST method. The route should call the function save-message! with the request to create a new message.  guestbook src clj guestbook routes home.clj [" message" {:post save-message!}]  The route handler calls the save-message! function below. This function grabs the params key from the request. This key contains a map of parameters that were sent by the client when the form was submitted to the server.  guestbook src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn save-message! [{:keys [params]}]  db save-message! params   response found " "    Since  we  named  our  fields  name  and  message,  they  match  the  fields  we defined in our table: to create a new record all we have to do is call the save- message! function from the db namespace with the params map. Once the mes- sage  is  saved,  we  redirect  back  to  the  home  page.  The  final  code  in  the namespace should look as follows:  guestbook src clj guestbook routes home.clj  ns guestbook.routes.home   :require [guestbook.layout :as layout] [guestbook.db.core :as db] [clojure.java.io :as io] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.response] [ring.util.http-response :as response]     defn home-page [request]   layout render request "home.html" {:messages  db get-messages }     defn save-message!

Getting Your Feet Wet   22  [" message" {:post save-message!}] [" about" {:get about-page}]]   At this point our guestbook should display existing messages as well as allow the users to post new messages. As a last touch, we’ll add some CSS to style our app. Static assets such as CSS, images, and JavaScript are found in the resources public folder and are served without the need to define routes for them. Let’s add the following CSS in the resources public css screen.css file:  guestbook resources public css screen.css ul.messages {  list-style: none;  } ul.messages li {  padding: 0.5em; border-bottom: 1px dotted ccc;  } ul.messages li:last-child {  border-bottom: none;  } li time {  }  font-size: 0.75em;  color: rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.5 ;  The guestbook page should now look like the following figure:  report erratum     discuss   Refine Your App   23  Validating Input  What else should we do? Currently, our guestbook doesn’t do any validation of user input. That’s weak. Let’s see how we can ensure that user messages contain the necessary information before trying to store them in the database.  Luminus defaults to using the Struct library15 to handle input validation. The library  provides  a  straightforward  way  to  check  that  our  parameter  map contains the required values.  Struct  uses struct.core validate  function  for  handling  validation.  This  function accepts a map containing the parameters followed by the validation schema. The schema is used to validate the input and return error messages for any invalid fields.  Many common validators such as required, email, matches, and so on are provided by Struct out of the box. These validators can be used individually or chained together to validate different aspects of the input value. Also, we can easily create custom validators for situations where the default ones won’t do.  Before  we  see  how  validation  works,  we  want  to  include  struct.core  in  our guestbook.routes.home namespace.   ns guestbook.routes.home   :require ... [struct.core :as st]    We can now use the st validate function to check that the input values are valid and to produce an error message when they are not. In our case, we need to ensure both that the username is not empty and that the message has at least ten characters before we persist them to the database. Our validation schema will look as follows:  guestbook-validation src clj guestbook routes home.clj  def message-schema  [[:name  st required st string] [:message st required st string {:message "message must contain at least 10 characters" :validate  fn [msg]  >=  count msg  10  }]]   15. http:  funcool.github.io struct latest  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   24  The validation schema specifies that both the :name and the :message keys are required,  that  they’re  strings,  and  that  the  message  must  be  more  than  9 characters in length. The validation function will then call the st validate function passing it the params along with the schema to validate the message.  guestbook-validation src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn validate-message [params]   first  st validate params message-schema     The result of the validate function is a vector where the first element is either nil when the validation passes or a map of errors. The keys in the map are the parameters that failed validation and the values are the error messages.  The next step is to hook up the validation function into our workflow. Cur- rently,  the  save-message!  function  attempts  to  store  the  message  and  then redirects back to the home page. We need to add the ability to pass back the error message along with the original parameters when validation fails.  A common approach for this is to use a flash session to track the errors. Flash sessions have a lifespan of a single request, making them ideal storage for this  purpose.  The save-message!  function  validates  the  input  and  checks  for errors. If it finds errors, it associates a :flash key with the response that contains the parameters along with the errors. If no errors are generated, it saves the message to the database and redirects as it did before.  guestbook-validation src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn save-message! [{:keys [params]}]   if-let [errors  validate-message params ]   ->  response found " "    assoc :flash  assoc params :errors errors      do   db save-message! params   response found " "      We  can  now  update  the home-page  function  to  check  for  the :flash  key.  Let’s select the name, message, and errors keys from the flash session and merge them with our parameter map.  guestbook-validation src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn home-page [{:keys [flash] :as request}]   layout render request "home.html"  merge {:messages  db get-messages }   select-keys flash [:name :message :errors]      Finally, let’s update our page to render the errors when they’re present.  report erratum     discuss   guestbook-validation resources html home.html          Refine Your App   25  {% csrf-field %}       Name   {% if errors.name %}    {{errors.namejoin}}    {% endif %} <input class="input"  type="text" name="name" value="{{name}}"  >          Message    {% if errors.message %}    {{errors.messagejoin}}    {% endif %} <textarea  class="textarea" name="message">{{message}}     <input type="submit"  class="button is-primary" value="comment"  >           report erratum     discuss   Chapter 1. Getting Your Feet Wet   26  Running Standalone Up to now, we’ve been running our app using the lein run command. This starts an embedded server in development mode so that it watches files for changes and reloads them as needed. In order to package our application for deploy- ment, we can package it into a runnable JAR as follows:  $ lein uberjar  The archive will be created in the  ‘target’ folder of our application, and we can run it using the java command.  Since we’re using a database, we also have to make sure that the connection is  specified  as  an  environment  variable.  When  we  ran  our  application  in development mode, the connection variable was provided in the dev-config.edn file.  However,  now  that  the  application  has  been  packaged  for  production, this  variable  is  no  longer  available.  Let’s  create  a  connection  variable  and then run our application as follows:  $ export DATABASE_URL="jdbc:h2:. guestbook_dev.db" $ java -jar target uberjar guestbook.jar  What You’ve Learned  OK, that’s the whirlwind tour. By this point you should be getting a feel for developing  web  applications  with  Clojure,  and  you  should  be  comfortable with some of the Clojure basics. You saw how to use Leiningen create and  report erratum     discuss   What You’ve Learned   27  manage applications. You learned about HTTP routing and some basic HTML templating. While we didn’t explore many aspects of the skeleton application that was generated for us, you saw how the basic request lifecycle is handled.  We’ll be diving deeper and writing more code in upcoming chapters. If you aren’t already, you should start using one of the popular Clojure-aware editor plugins, such as Cursive  IntelliJ , Calva  VSCode , Cider  Emacs , Fireplace  Vim ,  or  Counterclockwise   Eclipse .  We  can’t  overstate  the  value  of  these tools, and we strongly recommend taking the time to set one up. See Appendix 2, Editor Configuration, on page 385 for guides on setting up a few popular Clojure editors.  In  the  next  chapter  we’ll  delve  into  the  details  of  the  Clojure  web  stack  to understand some of the details of how our application works.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 2  Luminus Web Stack  Now that we’ve gone through the process of building a web application using Clojure, let’s take a look at what the Luminus template set up for us.  Many popular platforms, such as Rails or Django, take the approach of pro- viding  a  monolithic  framework  for  building  web  applications.  The  Clojure community has avoided this approach, using modular components instead. This  means  that  you  can  structure  your  projects  according  to  each  one’s needs.  Of course, in order to do that you have to know what libraries exist, what they are for, and how to put them together effectively. Even if you know the libraries that you wish to use, every project needs a certain amount of boiler- plate.  The Clojure community tackles this problem by using project templates. These generate the necessary boilerplate for specific types of projects in a way that is readable and explicit, so you can get started quickly and change any of the generated code if necessary. In this book we’re primarily using the Luminus template. The web application generated by Luminus is ready for deployment out of the box. The only missing part is your domain logic.  There  are  two  libraries  at  the  core  of  the  application  we  developed  in  the previous chapter. Ring provides a basic API for handling HTTP requests and responses, and Reitit provides routing on top of Ring.  Let’s take a look at how to handle HTTP requests and responses using Ring, and how to structure routes using Reitit, by building a web app from scratch.  Route Requests with Ring  Ring abstracts the details of HTTP into a concise and modular API that can be used as a base for any web application. If you’ve developed web applications  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   30  in Python or Ruby, you’ll find it similar to the WSGI and Rack libraries found in those languages.1,2 Ring has adapters for many popular HTTP servers. The most  common  choices  are  embedded  HTTP  servers  such  as  Jetty  or  HTTP Kit.3,4  Since Ring is the de facto standard HTTP library, there are many mature web development tools and libraries built on top of it. Even though you’ll rarely use Ring directly, it is the backbone of clojure web applications. Knowing how it works is crucial to understanding clojure web development.  1. 2. 3. 4.  http:  wsgi.readthedocs.org en latest  http:  rack.github.io  http:  www.eclipse.org jetty  http:  http-kit.github.io   report erratum     discuss   Route Requests with Ring   31  Ring applications consist of four basic components: the handler, the request, the response, and the middleware. When an HTTP request is received from the client via the HTTP Server, it is transformed into a Ring request by the adapter. This request is passed down the middleware stack, being modified as  necessary,  until  it  reaches  the  handler.  The  handler  generates  a  Ring response from the request. It is then passed back up the middleware stack, being modified as necessary, until it reaches the adapter. The adapter converts the response map into an HTTP response to be sent back to the client. Let’s see this in action.  Creating a Web Server  $ lein new ring-app  First, let’s create a new project called ring-app by running the following com- mand:  Next let’s open the project.clj file to add the dependency for Ring and specify the :main key that points to the namespace that has the -main function. This function is used as the entry point for starting the application.  ring-app-1 project.clj  defproject ring-app "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"  :description "FIXME: write description" :url "http:  example.com FIXME" :license {:name "EPL-2.0 OR GPL-2.0-or-later WITH Classpath-exception-2.0"  :url "https:  www.eclipse.org legal epl-2.0 "}  :dependencies [[org.clojure clojure "1.10.1"]  [ring "1.8.2"]]  :repl-options {:init-ns ring-app.core} :main ring-app.core   We’re now ready to update the ring-app.core namespace with the code to create a web server and handle HTTP requests.  Handling Requests  Ring uses standard Clojure maps to represent requests and responses. The handler is a function that processes incoming requests and generates corre- sponding responses. A very basic Ring handler might look like this:  ring-app-1 src ring_app core.clj  defn handler [request-map]  {:status 200 :headers {"Content-Type" "text html"} :body  str "   your IP is: "  :remote-addr request-map  "  " }   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   32  As you can see, the handler function accepts a map representing an HTTP request and returns a map representing an HTTP response. Ring takes care of generating the request map from the incoming HTTP request, and converting the map returned by the function into the corresponding HTTP response that will be sent to the client. Let’s open the ring-app.core and add the handler there.  Now we need to start a web server with our handler attached. We can use Ring’s jetty adapter to configure and start an instance of jetty. To do so, We’ll require it in the namespace declaration and then call run-jetty from our -main function. Our namespace should look like this:  ring-app-1 src ring_app core.clj  ns ring-app.core   :require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]     defn handler [request-map]  {:status 200 :headers {"Content-Type" "text html"} :body  str "   your IP is: "  :remote-addr request-map  "  " }    defn -main []   jetty run-jetty handler {:port 3000 :join? false}    The run-jetty function accepts the handler function we just created, along with a  map  containing  options  such  as  the  HTTP  port.  The  :join?  key  indicates whether the server thread should block. Let’s set it to false so that we’re able to work in the REPL while it’s running.  Now, we can open up the terminal and start our application using the lein run command.  $ cd ring-app $ lein run ...:main: Logging initialized @783ms ... ...oejs.Server:main: jetty-9.4.12.v20180830; ... ...oejs.AbstractConnector:main: Started ServerConnector ... {0.0.0.0:3000} ...oejs.Server:main: Started @833ms  At this point our server is ready to handle requests, and we can navigate to http:  localhost:3000 or use curl to see our app in action. You should see “your IP is: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1” since we’re accessing it from localhost and the server is listening on all of the available interfaces.  report erratum     discuss   Route Requests with Ring   33  The handler that we wrote serves an HTML string with the client’s IP address with a response status of 200. Since this is a common operation, the Ring API provides a helper function for generating such responses found in the ring.util.response namespace. Let’s reference it and update our handler as follows.  ring-app-2 src ring_app core.clj  ns ring-app.core   :require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]  [ring.util.response :as response]     defn handler [request-map]   response response  str "   your IP is: "  :remote-addr request-map  "  "     We should now be able to restart the app in the terminal and see the same page displayed as before. If you want to create a custom response, you’ll have to write a function that would accept a request map and return a response map  representing  your  custom  response.  Let’s  look  at  the  format  for  the request and response maps.  Request and Response Maps  The request and response maps will contain information such as the server port, URI, remote address, and content type, plus the body with the actual payload. The keys in these maps are based on the servlet API and the official HTTP RFC.5,6  What’s in the Request Map  The request defines the following standard keys. Note that not all of these keys, such as :ssl-client-cert, are guaranteed to be present in a request.   :server-port—The port on which the server is handling the request   :server-name—The server’s IP address or the name it resolves to   :remote-addr—The client’s IP address   :query-string —The request’s query string   :scheme—The specifier of the protocol, which can be either :http or :https   :request-method—The HTTP request method, such as :get, :head, :options, :put,  :post, or :delete  5. 6.  https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7230 https:  tools.ietf.org html rfc7231  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   34    :content-type—The request body’s MIME type   :content-length—The number of bytes in the request   :character-encoding—The name of the request’s character encoding   :headers—A map containing the request headers   :body—An input stream for the body of the request   :context—The  context  in  which  the  application  can  be  found  when  not  deployed as root    :uri—The request URI path on the server; this string will have the :context  prepended when available    :ssl-client-cert—The client’s SSL certificate  As  you  can  see,  the  standard  keys  from  the  Ring  specification  are  quite spartan, and are still very close to regular HTTP. Middleware functions are often used to extend the request map with other application-specific keys and to make the request map easier to work with. Later in this chapter we’ll cover how to accomplish this.  What’s in the Response Map  The response map contains three keys needed to describe the HTTP response:    :status—The response’s HTTP status   :headers—Any HTTP headers to be returned to the client   :body—The response’s body  The status is a number representing one of the status codes specified in the HTTP RFC. The lowest allowed number is 100.  The  :headers  key  is  a  map  containing  the  HTTP-header  key value  pairs. Header values may either be strings or a sequences of strings. When the value is a sequence, then a name value header will be sent for each string in the sequence.  The response body can contain a string, a sequence, a file, or an input stream. The body must correspond appropriately with the response’s status code.  When the response body is a string, it will be sent back to the client as is. If it is a sequence, then a string representing each element is sent to the client. Finally, if the response is a file or an input stream, then the server sends its contents to the client.  {:status :headers {"content-type" "text html"}  404  report erratum     discuss   Route Requests with Ring   35  "  NOT FOUND  "} 200  :body {:status :headers {"content-type" ["text plain" "text html"]} :body  "  OK  "}  Adding Functionality with Middleware  Middleware allows wrapping the handlers in functions that can modify the way the request is processed, modify the generated response, or both. Middle- ware functions are often used to extend the base functionality of Ring handlers to match your application’s needs.  A  middleware  handler  is  a  function  that  accepts  an  existing  handler  with some optional parameters and then returns a new handler with some added behavior. Here is an example of a middleware function:  ring-app-2 src ring_app core.clj  defn wrap-nocache [handler]   fn [request]  -> request handler  assoc-in [:headers "Pragma"] "no-cache"      The wrapper in our example accepts a handler and returns a function that in turn acts as a handler. When the returned handler function is invoked, it will call the original handler with the request and add Pragma: no-cache to the headers of the response map the original handler returns. Wrapper functions like this one are called closures because they close over their parameters and make them accessible to the function they return, even if the returned function is invoked much later.  Before we try wrapping our handler with our new middleware, let’s see what headers we get back:  Now, let’s wrap our handler with wrap-nocache, restart our app, and confirm that the headers change:  $ curl -I localhost:3000 HTTP 1.1 200 OK Date: ... Content-Length: 54 Server: Jetty 9.4.12.v20180830   ring-app-2 src ring_app core.clj  defn -main []   jetty run-jetty  -> handler  wrap-nocache   {:port 3000  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   36  :join? false}    $ curl -I localhost:3000 HTTP 1.1 200 OK Date: ... Pragma: no-cache Content-Length: 54 Server: Jetty 9.4.12.v20180830   We’ve updated our response without modifying our handler. Using middleware allows us to create small functions, each dealing with a particular aspect of our  application.  Because  middleware  functions  both  accept  and  return  a handler function we can easily chain together as many as we need to provide complex behaviors needed for real-world applications.  Many  libraries  provide  middleware  functions  for  modifying  request  and response maps. Ring itself comes with a number of such middleware helpers. For example, you may have noticed that we didn’t have to keep restarting the guestbook app to see the changes. Instead, the code on the server was auto- matically  reloaded  by  the  wrap-reload  middleware  function  found  in  the ring.middleware.reload namespace. Let’s add this piece of middleware to our app.  ring-app-3 src ring_app core.clj  ns ring-app.core   :require ;;... [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]     defn -main []   jetty run-jetty  -> handler  var wrap-nocache wrap-reload   {:port 3000 :join? false}    Note that we have to create a var from the handler in order for this middleware to work.7 This is necessary to ensure that the var object containing the current handler function is returned. If we used handler, then the first time this middle- ware is called it will resolve handler to the initial function and ignore any sub- sequent changes we might want to reload.8 A more common way to create a var would be to use the ' prefix as follows:   -> 'handler  7. 8.  https:  clojure.org reference vars https:  clojure.org reference evaluation  report erratum     discuss   Extend Ring   37  wrap-nocache wrap-reload   With the wrap-reload middleware in place, you’ll have to restart the server one more time for it to take effect. After the server is restarted you should be able to modify the handler function, save the file, and reload the page to see the changes.   defn handler [request-map]   response response  str "  Hello, your IP is: "   :remote-addr request-map  "  "     $ curl http:  localhost:3000   Hello, your IP is: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1    What Are the Adapters?  Adapters sit between the handlers and the underlying HTTP protocol. They provide any necessary configuration, such as port mappings, and they parse HTTP  requests  into  request  maps  and  construct  HTTP  responses  from  the handler response maps. The adapters allow Ring to run on a number of dif- ferent containers, such as Jetty and HTTP Kit. You will generally not need to interact with adapters directly in your application.  Extend Ring  Ring  provides  a  simple  base  for  handling  the  HTTP  request  and  response cycle. We’ll now look at several libraries that provide many additional utility functions that extend the functionality of Ring.  As we saw earlier, the Ring stack consists of a chain of middleware functions. Each function accepts the request map, modifies it in some way, and then passes it on to the next function in the chain. The middleware functions have to be wrapped in order of dependency. For example, session-based authenti- cation relies on the presence of a session, and the session middleware must run before it to make the session available.  A  library  called  ring-defaults  provides  a  standard  set  of  middleware  that’s useful for typical web applications. The middleware is split into API middleware and site middleware. The configuration api-defaults is meant to be used for web  service  APIs,  and  its  counterpart,  secure-api-defaults,  extends  it  with SSL redirects and enables HSTS. Conversely, site-defaults provide the middle- ware stack for a typical website, while secure-site-defaults provide security  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   38  extensions such as SSL and secure cookies. Luminus defaults to using the site-defaults middleware.  Ideally, the responses returned by the server should follow the HTTP status codes whenever appropriate. When an operation is successful, we return a status of 200, when we have an internal error we return a status of 500, and so on. The ring-http-response library provides a set of handler functions that map to HTTP codes.9  Using this library we can return meaningful responses that map to specific HTTP status codes, such as ok, found, internal-server-error, and so on.  Let’s add the library to the dependencies in project.clj and update the handler function in the project.  ring-app-3 project.clj :dependencies [[org.clojure clojure "1.10.1"]  [metosin ring-http-response "0.9.1"] [ring "1.8.2"]]  Note that if the project is currently running, then we’ll have to restart it for the  changes  to  take  effect.  While  Clojure  namespaces  can  be  reloaded dynamically, any changes on the classpath require the JVM to be restarted to take effect. Since adding a new libraries updates the classpath, the project needs to be reloaded for it to be found.  We can now replace the ring.util.response reference with a reference to ring.util.http- response and update the handler as follows.  ring-app-3 src ring_app core.clj  ns ring-app.core   :require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty] [ring.util.http-response :as response] [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]     defn handler [request-map]   response ok  str "   your IP is: "  :remote-addr request-map  "  "     You might encounter another common REPL problem here if you restarted before editing src ring-app core.clj. Since we were already using the response alias for ring.util.response, you’ll get an IllegalStateException. To remedy this, simply call ns-unalias from the REPL before reloading your file like so:  9.  https:  github.com metosin ring-http-response  report erratum     discuss   Extend Ring   39  ring-app.core=>  ns ring-app.core   :require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]  [ring.util.http-response :as response] [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]    IllegalStateException Alias response already exists in namespace... ring-app.core=>  ns-unalias *ns* 'response  nil ring-app.core=>  ns ring-app.core   :require [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty]  [ring.util.http-response :as response] [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]    _=> _=> _=>  _=> _=> _=>  nil  Now that we’ve got our namespace loaded, try out some different response types. Here are some examples:  ring-app.core=>  response continue  {:status 100, :headers {}, :body ""} ring-app.core=>  response ok " hello, world "  {:status 200, :headers {}, :body " hello, world "} ring-app.core=>  response found " messages"  {:status 302, :headers {"Location" " messages"}, :body ""} ring-app.core=>  response internal-server-error "failed to complete request"  {:status 500, :headers {}, :body "failed to complete request"}  When  exposing  a  service  API,  it’s  often  necessary  to  communicate  with external clients that use different encoding formats. Most of the time, Clojure web apps will use EDN or Transit.10  See Appendix 3, Working with EDN and Transit, on page 389 for details.  The muuntaja library provides middleware for automatically  serializing  and  deserializing  different  data  formats  based  on the Accept and Content-Type request headers. The library handles common for- mats, such as JSON and YAML, as well as Clojure-specific formats such as EDN and transit. Let’s add this library.  ring-app-4 project.clj :dependencies [[org.clojure clojure "1.10.1"]  [metosin muuntaja "0.6.7"] [metosin ring-http-response "0.9.1"] [ring "1.8.2"]]  10. https:  github.com cognitect transit-format  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   40  The library provides a middleware wrapper function called muuntaja.middle- ware wrap-format.  This  function  accepts  the  handler  and  an  optional muuntaja  instance.  Let’s  reference  the wrap-format  middleware  function  and change the handler to accept a request containing a JSON-encoded request body. We’ll rename our old handler, create a new one called json-handler that accepts and returns a map, and define handler to be json-handler.  ring-app-4 src ring_app core.clj  ns ring-app.core   :require [muuntaja.middleware :as muuntaja] [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty] [ring.util.http-response :as response] [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]     defn html-handler [request-map]   response ok  str "   your IP is: "  :remote-addr request-map  "  "     defn json-handler [request]   response ok {:result  get-in request [:body-params :id] }     def handler json-handler   defn wrap-nocache [handler]   fn [request]  -> request handler  assoc-in [:headers "Pragma"] "no-cache"       defn wrap-formats [handler]   -> handler   muuntaja wrap-format      defn -main []   jetty run-jetty  -> 'handler  wrap-nocache wrap-formats wrap-reload   {:port 3000 :join? false}    To  parse  our  request  body,  the  wrap-format  middleware  uses  the  Content- Type and Accept HTTP headers to determine how the request and response data  should  be  handled.  It  optionally  takes  a  second  argument  to  specify options such as default response format, custom parsing and encoding per format, etc. We’ll use Muuntaja’s defaults for now.  report erratum     discuss   Extend Ring   41  Let’s test it out using cURL:  $ curl -H "Content-Type: application json" \ -X POST -d '{"id":1}' localhost:3000 {"result":1}  It works! Since we specified that we’re supplying a JSON encoded request, and we accept JSON in the response the middleware deserializes the JSON into Clojure EDN data structure, and automatically serializes the response data  structure  as  a  JSON  string.  However,  we’re  not  limited  to  working strictly with JSON. We can just change the headers to use a different encoding:  $ curl -H "Content-Type: application edn" -H "Accept: application edn" \ -X POST -d '{:id 1}' localhost:3000 {:result 1}  This  time  around  we  passed  EDN  encoded  parameters  and  got  an  EDN encoded result back. You can mix and match request and response types as well. If you like, try turning an EDN request into a JSON response and vice- versa to see how muuntaja converts between the two formats.  Muuntaja supports JSON, EDN and Transit by default, and provides additional modules for YAML and Messagepack if you need them. This multitude of for- mats can become a problem, especially since they don’t all share the same features. As we saw earlier, in EDN we get the keyword :result but in JSON we get the string "result". This gets even more complex when you consider timestamps and other EDN extensions. To deal with this, Muuntaja provides an encoder decoder API with a default instance, and the ability to specify a custom  instance  to  be  used  by  your  middleware  stack.  We  won’t  get  into providing our own custom Muuntaja instance here, but we’ll see it later on.  Using middleware like this is a common pattern for capturing ordinary tasks, such as data encoding, in a centralized fashion. The alternative would be to have each handler function handle its own serialization and deserialization logic. The latter approach is both error-prone and repetitive; thus it should be avoided whenever possible. As a rule, patterns that are not specific to a particular request are good candidates for middleware functions.  It’s also worth noting that different sets of handlers can be wrapped with their own middleware. For example, CSRF protection makes sense for routes that are called by the pages generated within the same session, as you saw with the guestbook application. However, if you were creating a public service API, then you would not wish the routes to require a CSRF token.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   42  Define the Routes with Reitit  Reitit is a general purpose routing library that can be used to provide routing on top of Ring as well as for client-side routing as we’ll see later on. It provides a way to associate handler functions with a URL and an HTTP method.  We already saw some examples of routing using Reitit when we built our first application in Chapter 1, Getting Your Feet Wet, on page 1. Now let’s take a closer look at the functionality it provides. First, we’ll add it as a dependency in the ring-app project.  ring-app-5 project.clj :dependencies [[org.clojure clojure "1.10.1"]  [metosin muuntaja "0.6.7"] [metosin reitit "0.5.11"] [metosin ring-http-response "0.9.1"] [ring "1.8.2"]]  With the dependency in place, let’s update the namespace to reference reitit.ring and add a route for the   URI.  ring-app-5 src ring_app core.clj  ns ring-app.core   :require [reitit.ring :as reitit] [muuntaja.middleware :as muuntaja] [ring.adapter.jetty :as jetty] [ring.util.http-response :as response] [ring.middleware.reload :refer [wrap-reload]]    ;;...  def routes  [[" " {:get html-handler}]]    def handler   reitit ring-handler  reitit router routes      defn -main []   jetty run-jetty  -> 'handler  wrap-nocache wrap-formats wrap-reload   {:port 3000 :join? false}    We’re using our html-handler to generate responses, and it’s being called when the   route is called with the HTTP GET method. As you can see, Reitit uses  report erratum     discuss   Define the Routes with Reitit   43  plain Clojure data structures to declare routes. Each route is declared using a vector where the first item is a string representing the route path. The path is followed by a map describing the supported operations. In this case the map indicates that the route responds to the :get operation and the request will be handled by the html-handler function.  We can test that our routing works correctly by restarting the application and using cURL to send a request to it:  $ curl http:  localhost:3000    your IP is: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1    Currently, the route only responds to GET requests, if we try to send it a POST request, then we won’t get a response:  $ curl -X POST http:  localhost:3000  As you might have guessed, all we have to do to handle the POST method is to add the :post key in the route map:   def routes  [[" " {:get html-handler  :post html-handler}]]   The server will now handle the POST method for the route:  $ curl -X POST http:  localhost:3000    your IP is: 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1    Alternatively, you can simply provide a handler function instead of a map, and it will accept any HTTP method.   def routes  [[" " html-handler]]   Reitit  also  supports  dynamic  paths  with  embedded  parameters.  These parameters  are  specified  using  a :.  Let’s  add  another  route  to  our  handler that accepts an :id and displays its value on the page.   def routes  [[" " html-handler] [" echo :id" {:get  fn [{{:keys [id]} :path-params}]  Let’s try it out:  $ curl http:  localhost:3000 echo 5  the value is: 5    response ok  str " the value is: " id " "   }]]   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   44  Another useful Reitit feature is the ability to selectively apply middleware for specific routes. Currently, the wrap-formats middleware is being applied to all the routes since it’s wrapping the entire handler. Since this middleware intro- duces additional overhead, we would want to only apply it to the routes that actually  need  it.  Let’s  update  the  -main  function  to  remove  the  wrap-formats middleware.  ring-app-6 src ring_app core.clj  defn -main []   jetty run-jetty  -> 'handler  wrap-nocache wrap-reload   {:port 3000 :join? false}    Next, we’ll create a context path called  api that will declare the middleware using  the :middleware  key  in  its  configuration  map.  This  middleware  will  be applied to any routes under this context path. Finally, we’ll add a route called  multiply.  ring-app-6 src ring_app core.clj  def routes  [[" " html-handler] [" echo :id" {:get  fn [{{:keys [id]} :path-params}]   response ok  str " the value is: " id " "   }]  [" api" {:middleware [wrap-formats]} [" multiply" {:post  fn [{{:keys [a b]} :body-params}]   response ok {:result  * a b }  }]]]   We can test it out using cURL as follows:  $ curl -H "Content-Type: application json" -X POST \  http:  localhost:3000 api multiply  -d '{"a": 3, "b": 2}'  {"result":6}  Using Reitit routes, we can easily map functionality to each URL of our site to provide much of the core functionality needed in a web application. We can  then  group  these  routes  together  using  vectors  as  we  did  previously. Reitit, in turn, creates the Ring handler for us.  Reitit Defaults  Now that we know how the basics of Reitit work, let’s take a look at some other useful features that it provides. For example, we might wish to set some  report erratum     discuss   Define the Routes with Reitit   45  default  handlers.  We  can  accomplish  that  by  adding  a  default  handler  as follows:  ring-app-6 src ring_app core.clj  def handler   reitit ring-handler  reitit router routes   reitit create-default-handler {:not-found  constantly  response not-found "404 - Page not found"   :method-not-allowed  constantly  response method-not-allowed "405 - Not allowed"   :not-acceptable  constantly  response not-acceptable "406 - Not acceptable"  }     the reitit ring-handler function accepts an optional default handler as a second argument.  We’ve  passed  it  a  handler  generated  by  the  reitit.ring create-default- handler function. This function creates a default handler from a configuration map that specifies the handler functions for 404, 405, and 406 client errors. With this change in place, we should get an informative error when the client accesses a route incorrectly. For example, if we call a route that doesn’t exist then we’ll see the following response:  $ curl http:  localhost:3000 foo 404 - Page not found  Another useful handler would be one for serving static resources. Once again, Reitit provides a helper function for doing that called create-resource-handler. The function accepts a configuration map that can contain the following options:    :parameter—Optional name of the wildcard parameter, defaults to unnamed  keyword :.    :root—Optional resource root, defaults to public.   :path—Optional  path  to  mount  the  handler  to.  Works  only  if  mounted  outside of a router.    :loader—Optional class loader to resolve the resources.   :index-files—Optional vector of index-files to look in a resource directory,  defaults to ["index.html"].  We’ll update our default handler to try the resource handler first, then to fall back on our original default handler. To accomplish this, we’ll wrap our two handlers  in  the  reitit.ring routes  function.  This  will  evaluate  each  handler  in order, returning the first match. This means that the resource handler must be declared before the default handler in order not to be masked by it.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   46  ring-app-6 src ring_app core.clj  def handler   reitit ring-handler  reitit router routes   reitit routes  reitit create-resource-handler {:path " "}   reitit create-default-handler {:not-found  constantly  response not-found "404 - Page not found"   :method-not-allowed  constantly  response method-not-allowed "405 - Not allowed"   :not-acceptable  constantly  response not-acceptable "406 - Not acceptable"  }      Next, let’s create a resources public folder with a file called index.html with the fol- lowing contents:  ring-app-6 resources public index.html     Hello from Reitit            We can now check that the resource is being served:  $ curl http:  localhost:3000 index.html     Hello from Reitit            You  should  now  be  comfortable  accomplishing  basic  routing  tasks  using Reitit. In the next section, we’ll take a closer look at server-side HTML tem- plating using Selmer.  HTML Templating Using Selmer  Selmer is a general-purpose templating engine that’s content-agnostic. While it’s primarily geared toward working with HTML, it can be used to transform any kind of text. If you’re already familiar with Django or similar templating languages, you should feel right at home using Selmer.  When  applied  to  generating  HTML  templates,  Selmer  encourages  a  clean separation between the presentation and the business logic. On top of that, the templates can be maintained by someone who has no knowledge of Clojure. Let’s create a new project where we’ll learn to use different features of Selmer. Let’s use the default Leiningen template for this purpose.  report erratum     discuss   HTML Templating Using Selmer   47  Once the project is created, add the Selmer dependency in the project.clj file.  $ lein new html-templating  [selmer "1.12.31"]  We’re now ready to take a look at what Selmer has to offer using the REPL. Open up the html-templating.core namespace and add a reference to Selmer there.   ns html-templating.core   :require [selmer.parser :as selmer]    Once we’ve added the reference we should be able to load the namespace and test that everything is working by evaluating this command in the REPL:   selmer render "Hello, {{name}}" {:name "World"}   When the code runs we should see the “Hello, World” text printed. The render function accepts the template string followed by a context map containing the dynamic content. This map contains any variables that we’d like to render in our template. In our case we’re populating the name tag using the :name key in the map.  In most real-world applications we’ll want to keep the templates as separate files instead of using strings directly in code. Selmer is optimized for this use case and will memoize the file templates when it parses them. Let’s take a look at how Selmer works with files.  Creating Templates  The templates are expected to be found on the resource path. Let’s create a new template called hello.html and place it in the resources folder in our project. The template consists of HTML with additional template tags.     My First Template                     Hello {{name}}   With the file created, we can run the render-file function to render it.   selmer render-file "hello.html" {:name "World"}   The result once again has the {{name}} tag replaced with the string World.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   48  The render-file function accepts a string pointing to a resource that’s expected to be found relative to the resource path of the application. Since we placed our template file in the resources folder, the path consists of its name.  Selmer also provides us with the ability to set a custom resource path using the selmer.parser set-resource-path! function. For example, we could run the following code  to  specify  that  the  templates  should  be  found  in  the  var html templates folder.   selmer.parser set-resource-path! " var html templates "   In the preceding code we passed in a string as the value for the variable name. However, we’re not restricted to strings and can pass in any type we like. For example, if we pass in a collection we can iterate over it using the for tag. Let’s add the following content to our hello.html template.        {% for item in items %}    {{item}}    {% endfor %}  When we run the render-file function, we pass it a range of numbers keyed on the :items key.   selmer render-file "hello.html" {:items  range 10 }   Note  that  since  we  passed  no  value  for  the {{name}}  tag,  its  content  is  left blank. If an item happens to be a map, we can access the keys by name, as follows.   selmer render " Hello {{user.first}} {{user.last}} "  {:user {:first "John" :last "Doe"}}   When  no  special  processing  is  specified  in  the  template,  the  parameter’s default str representation will be used.  Using Filters  {{nameupper}}  Filters allow for postprocessing the variables before they are rendered. For example, you can use a filter to convert the variable to uppercase, compute a hash, or count its length. Filters are specified by using a pipe symbol    after the variable name, as seen here:  Selmer comes with a number of handy filters, such as upper, date, and pluralize, out  of  the  box.  On  top  of  that  we  can  easily  define  new  filters  using  the  report erratum     discuss   HTML Templating Using Selmer   49  selmer.filters add-filter!  function.  Try  this  in  the  REPL  by  adding  a  reference  to selmer.filters and creating a filter to check if a collection is empty.   ns html-templating.core   :require [selmer.parser :as selmer]  [selmer.filters :as filters]     filters add-filter! :empty? empty?   selmer render "{% if filesempty? %}no files{% else %}files{% endif %}"  {:files []}   By default the content of the filters is escaped; we can override this behavior as follows:   filters add-filter! :foo   fn [x] [:safe  .toUpperCase x ]     selmer render "{{xfoo}}" {:x " I'm safe "}   You should only unescape content that’s generated by the server and known to be safe. You should always escape any user input because it can contain malicious content.  Using Template Tags Selmer provides two types of tags. The first is inline tags such as extends and include. These tags are self-contained statements and do not require an end tag. The other type is the block tags. These tags have a start and an end tag, with the tag content inbetween. An example of this is the if ... endif block.  In addition to tags already provided, you can also define custom tags using the selmer.parser add-tag! macro. Let’s look at an example to see how it works:  Defining Custom Tags   selmer add-tag! :image  fn [args context-map]   str " "      selmer render "{% image \"http:  foo.com logo.jpg\" %}" {}   We can also define a block tag by using the overloaded add-tag! definition. In this case we provide the opening tag, followed by the handler function and any closing tags. The handler accepts an additional parameter that holds the content of each block. The content is keyed on the name of the block, as in the following example:   selmer add-tag! :uppercase  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   50   fn [args context-map block]   .toUpperCase  get-in block [:uppercase :content]     :enduppercase   selmer render  "{% uppercase %}foo {{bar}} baz{% enduppercase %}" {:bar "injected"}   Inheriting Templates  Selmer templates can refer to other templates. We have two ways to refer to a template. We can either extend templates using the extends tag or include templates with the include tag.  Extending Templates When we use the extends tag, the current template will use the template it’s extending as the base. Any block tags in the base template with the names matching the current template will be overwritten.  Let’s look at a concrete example. First, we define our base template, called base.html, and place it in the resources folder alongside the hello.html template we already have.     {% block title %}My amazing site{% endblock %}      {% block content %}default content{% endblock %}  We then update the hello.html to extend base.html as follows:                        {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}   Hello {{name}}     {% for item in items %}    {{item}}    {% endfor %}     {% endblock %}  report erratum     discuss   HTML Templating Using Selmer   51  When the hello.html is rendered, the content block displays the entries defined there. However, since we did not define a block for the title, the base template - base.html - is used.  Optionally, we can include the parent content in the child block by using the {{block.super}} tag. It is replaced by the content of the parent when the template is rendered.  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}  {{block.super}}  Hello {{name}}     {% for item in items %}    {{item}}    {% endfor %}     {% endblock %}  Note that you can chain extended templates together. In this case the latest occurrence of a block tag will be the one that’s rendered.  One caveat to be aware of is that the templates are memoized by default. This means that a final version of the template will be compiled once and kept in memory. This can be toggled with the selmer.parser cache-on! and selmer.parser cache- off! functions. You’d likely want to turn caching off during development.  Including Templates The include tag allows us to include content from other templates in the current template. Let’s look at an example. Say we want to include some additional content in our hello.html template. Let’s create another template called register.html with the following content:      user id            Then we update the hello.html template to include register.html.  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}  {% include "register.html" %}  Hello {{name}}   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   52     {% for item in items %}    {{item}}    {% endfor %}     {% endblock %}  Note that the hello.html template extends the base.html template. Any content in the template must be placed inside the block tags. When the template is com- piled, the parser looks for the matching blocks in the parent and injects the content from the child. Any content outside the blocks is therefore ignored.  When hello.html is rendered, it replaces the include tags with the content from the included template.  Error Handling  Selmer  attempts  to  provide  meaningful  errors  when  the  templates  contain syntax  errors.  For  example,  if  we  try  to  run  the  following  code,  we  get  an exception informing us that “safea” is not a valid tag.   selmer render "{{contentsafea}}" {}   Selmer  also  provides  a  middleware  function  called selmer.middleware wrap-error- page. This function captures errors and generates a page that can be rendered in the browser to notify you that a template compilation error has occurred.  You can try out this middleware in the REPL yourself. Let’s create a template file called error.html with the following content:  {{contentsafea}}  Middleware functions accept a handler function as a parameter and return a function that accepts the request map. Let’s create a renderer function that returns a handler that accepts the template name as its input and returns a 200 status response. We start by adding a reference for the selmer.middleware wrap-error-page function.   ns html-templating.core   :require [selmer.parser :as selmer]  report erratum     discuss   HTML Templating Using Selmer   53  [selmer.filters :as filters] [selmer.middleware :refer [wrap-error-page]]    Then we proceed to write a renderer function that looks like this:   defn renderer []  wrap-error-page  fn [template] {:status 200 :body  selmer render-file template {} }     We can now call it with different template files to see the result. First let’s call it with a proper template, such as hello.html. The result is the response from calling the handler.  However, if we call it with the error.html template, then we get a response of 500 with the body containing the error page.    renderer  "hello.html"     renderer  "error.html"   This middleware for development is set up by default in Luminus, providing feedback right in the browser when a template fails to compile.  Revisiting Guestbook Templates  Now  that  we’re  familiar  with  the  basics  of  HTML  templating  using  Selmer, let’s  see  how  it’s  used  in  our  guestbook  application.  As  we  saw,  Luminus places  HTML  templates  in  the  resources html  folder.  Here  we  have  four  files, about.html, base.html, home.html, and error.html. The error.html template is used for displaying general purpose error pages such as when the page isn’t found or a server error occurs. For example, guestbook.mid- dleware namespace defines a function called wrap-internal-error that will catch any unhandled errors and serve a 500 error page:  guestbook src clj guestbook middleware.clj  defn wrap-internal-error [handler]   fn [req]   try   handler req   catch Throwable t   log error t  .getMessage t    error-page {:status 500  :title "Something very bad has happened!" :message "We've dispatched a team of highly trained gnomes to take care of the problem."}       report erratum     discuss   The  wrap-internal-error  function  in  turn  calls  the  error-page  function  from  the guestbook.layout namespace to render the error page:  Chapter 2. Luminus Web Stack   54  guestbook src clj guestbook layout.clj  defn error-page  "error-details should be a map containing the following keys: :status - error status :title - error title  optional  :message - detailed error message  optional  returns a response map with the error page as the body and the status specified by the status key" [error-details] {:status :headers {"Content-Type" "text html; charset=utf-8"} :body   parser render-file "error.html" error-details }    :status error-details   As we saw earlier, home.html and about.html files are used to render the home and about pages, respectively. The base template is extended by both these templates  and  provides  all  the  common  elements  for  each  page.  The  base template is where we declare common assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, or ClojureScript,  as  well  as  common  UI  elements,  such  as  navbars,  headers, and footers. Both home and about page templates extend the base and override its content block.  When the browser requests a particular page, the route calls the handler for the page. It in turn handles any business logic and then calls guestbook.layout ren- der to generate the page. The render function accepts the name of the template along with an optional context map containing dynamic content to be rendered. This is then passed to Selmer and the rendered page is returned.  What You’ve Learned  In this chapter we saw how to handle requests using Ring, how to structure routes using Reitit, and how to template HTML using Selmer. In the following chapter we’ll take a deeper look at overall application structure and how all the pieces fit together.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 3  Luminus Architecture  At the start of the book we jumped right into building a simple application. This let us get comfortable with the development environment and provided a glimpse of what to expect in terms of project structure. We looked at the directory layout, as well as at the purpose of some of the files found in the project. However, we didn’t focus very closely on the code in these files. In this chapter, you’ll learn the background necessary to fully understand our guestbook application.  Manage the Project  As  we  already  saw  working  on  the  guestbook  application,  the  project  is managed using the configuration specified in the project.clj file.  Leiningen uses the concept of profiles to identify different build scenarios for the project. The dev and the test profiles are used for development and testing, respectively.  The UberJar profile is used to package the application for deployment. When the  production  build  happens,  the  compiled  bytecode  is  emitted  into  the resulting JAR. This results in a self-contained application that can be run using the standard Java Runtime Environment  JRE .  Profile-Specific Resources  Profiles can contain any configuration options that can be specified in the global scope. For example, we can add specific dependencies or plugins that are only necessary for development. Since we wouldn’t want to package those for production, we don’t specify them at the top level.  Each profile also specifies its own paths for source files and resources. The :dev  profile  has  the :resource-paths ["env dev resources"]  resource  path.  This  path  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   56  will be used in addition to the global resources. This allows us to provide envi- ronment-specific settings for the app.  The profiles are also responsible for deciding what additional source paths should be used the same way as the resources. The :uberjar profile sets the :source-paths  key  to  point  to  ["env prod clj"],  while  the  :dev  profile  points  to ["env dev clj"]. These paths become available in addition to the default src path, where the compiler looks for the application code.  Running Code Selectively  Commonly,  some  code  in  the  application  will  need  to  behave  differently between development and production modes. For example, we may want to disable HTML template caching while developing the application. Then once we put it in production, we’d like to default to settings optimized for perfor- mance.  One common approach to this problem is to use an environment variable to indicate the mode that the application runs in and use conditional logic to select what code should be executed at runtime. This approach has a number of drawbacks. The conditional logic is error prone, it can add runtime over- head, and we end up having to package all the libraries used for development in our production build.  A better approach is to decide what code should be included at build time. This way only the code that’s necessary ends up being packaged for produc- tion, and we don’t have to worry about checking what mode the application is in at runtime. This is the approach that Luminus takes.  The development code includes a guestbook.env namespace with the configuration optimized for development use.  guestbook env dev clj guestbook env.clj  ns guestbook.env   :require  [selmer.parser :as parser] [clojure.tools.logging :as log] [guestbook.dev-middleware :refer [wrap-dev]]     def defaults  {:init  fn []  :stop  fn []   parser cache-off!   log info "\n-=[guestbook started successfully using the development profile]=-"    report erratum     discuss   Think in Terms of Application Components   57   log info "\n-=[guestbook has shut down successfully]=-"    :middleware wrap-dev}   The namespace consists of the defaults map that contains keys called :init, :stop, and :middleware. The first key points to a function that should be run during startup. The second points to a function that’s called when the application shuts down. And the last one specifies some additional development middle- ware for live code reloading and error reporting. The middleware itself is found in the guestbook.dev-middleware namespace. Contrast this with the production version of guestbook.env, which contains the following code.  guestbook env prod clj guestbook env.clj  ns guestbook.env   :require [clojure.tools.logging :as log]     def defaults  {:init  fn []  :stop  fn []   log info "\n-=[guestbook started successfully]=-"     log info "\n-=[guestbook has shut down successfully]=-"    :middleware identity}   As you can see the version found in the prod source path doesn’t disable the HTML template caching or wrap any development middleware.  Think in Terms of Application Components  The approach that a typical Clojure web application takes is probably different from what you’re used to. Most frameworks favor using the model-view-con- troller  MVC  pattern for partitioning the application logic, with strong sepa- ration between the view, the controller, and the model.  Luminus  does  not  enforce  any  strict  separation  between  the  view  and  the controller portion of the application. Instead, Luminus encourages organizing the application to keep related code in the same namespace. The route handler functions  are  typically  responsible  for  processing  HTTP  requests  from  the client and dispatching actions based on them. This approach provides a clean separation  between  the  domain  logic  and  the  presentation  layer  of  your application without introducing any unnecessary indirection.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   58  However, since the Clojure web stack is designed to be flexible, it will let you build your applications any way you like. If you do feel strongly about using a traditional MVC architecture, nothing will stop you from doing that.  A  typical  application  would  be  broken  up  into  several  logical  components. Let’s look at these in some more detail. A Luminus application is typically composed of the following core namespaces:    core—The core manages the life cycle of the HTTP server.   config—The config manages the map containing the configuration variables  used by the application.    handler—The handler  namespace  is  the  root  handler  for  the  requests  and  responses that aggregates all the routes.    routes—The routes namespace contains the namespaces that are responsible  for handling different types of client requests.    db—The db namespace is reserved for the data model of the application  and the persistence layer.  application layout.    layout—The  layout  namespace  contains  common  logic  for  generating  the    middleware—The middleware namespace contains any custom middleware we  want to use in our application.  Application Core The core namespace is used to start the application. Most importantly, this is where the -main function is found. The -main function is the entry point for the application and the - in front of the function name indicates that it should be compiled to a Java method. This is necessary in order for the JVM to be able to start our application. The compilation of the namespace into a class is triggered by the :gen-class hint in its declaration. The two functions that control the life cycle of the application are start-app and stop-app. The start-app function is called by the -main function when the application is run, and it’s responsible for running any initialization tasks.  guestbook src clj guestbook core.clj  defn start-app [args]   doseq [component  -> args   parse-opts cli-options  mount start-with-args  report erratum     discuss   Think in Terms of Application Components   59  :started ]  log info component "started"     .addShutdownHook  Runtime getRuntime   Thread. stop-app     The life cycle of these resources is managed by the Mount library. It provides a defstate macro that allows us to declare something which can be started and stopped, such as a database connection, a thread-pool, or an HTTP server. These are sometimes referred to as resources or components. We provide :start and :stop  keys  that  specify  the  code  that  should  run  when  the  resource  is started and stopped, respectively. Once a resource is started, the return value of the :start function is bound to the symbol we used in our defstate. We can see an example of this by looking at how the HTTP and the nREPL servers are defined.1  guestbook src clj guestbook core.clj  mount defstate ^{:on-reload :noop} http-server  :start  http start   -> env  :handler  handler app     assoc  update :port  or  -> env :options :port  %    select-keys [:handler :host :port]     :stop  http stop http-server    :start  when  env :nrepl-port    mount defstate ^{:on-reload :noop} repl-server   nrepl start {:bind  env :nrepl-bind   :port  env :nrepl-port }    :stop  when repl-server   nrepl stop repl-server     The template defaults to using the Jetty HTTP server unless otherwise speci- fied.2  The  server  is  passed  the  guestbook.handler app  function  to  handle  the incoming  client  requests.  When  our  http-server  resource  is  started,  we  call http start  with  parameters  taken  from  our env  resource.  This  will  create  and start our HTTP server. Furthermore, when we call mount start or mount start-with- args,  mount  will  automatically  determine  the  order  in  which  our  resources need to be initialized. This saves us a lot of effort as our app grows. In the case of http-server, we’ve added some metadata for mount: {:on-reload :noop}. By default, mount will try to restart any resources, and any resources that depend on  them,  when  their  namespaces  are  reloaded.  This  metadata  tells  mount  1. 2.  https:  github.com tolitius mount http:  www.eclipse.org jetty   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   60  that it shouldn’t do this for http-server, since it would be incredibly disruptive if our server restarted unintentionally.  The  start-app  function  calls  the  mount start-with-args  function.  This  function  is responsible for starting stateful components defined using the defstate macro. It also sets the stop-app function as a shutdown hook so that it will be called when  the  JVM  runtime  is  shutting  down.  This  function  is  responsible  for handling  any  cleanup  that  needs  to  be  done  when  the  app  stops,  such  as gracefully shutting down the HTTP server.  guestbook src clj guestbook core.clj  defn stop-app []   doseq [component  :stopped  mount stop  ]   log info component "stopped"     shutdown-agents    That’s all there is to bootstrapping the application. Now let’s see how we can add some routes to provide the functionality specific to our application.  Application Configuration The configuration is managed by the guestbook.config namespace. This namespace contains a defstate definition for the env variable. This variable contains the configuration aggregated from the config.edn file found on the resources path, the optional EDN config file pointed to by the conf Java parameter, the Java parameters, and the environment variables. The entirety of the namespace looks like this:  guestbook src clj guestbook config.clj  ns guestbook.config   :require  [cprop.core :refer [load-config]] [cprop.source :as source] [mount.core :refer [args defstate]]     defstate env  :start  load-config  :merge [ args   source from-system-props   source from-env ]    The  configuration  management  is  handled  by  a  library  called  cprop.  This library provides intelligence for massaging the environment variables into a Clojure-friendly format.3  3.  https:  github.com tolitius cprop  report erratum     discuss   Think in Terms of Application Components   61  The guestbook.config namespace calls the load-config function to create the config- uration. Different configuration sources are merged explicitly to produce the final configuration using the :merge flag. Note that the cprop library does a deep merge of the configurations that it finds. This merge allows us to specify a base configuration and then overwrite specific parts of it later on.  As we’ve already seen, dev-config.edn and test-config.edn files are used to specify environment variables used during development and testing. The cprop library looks  for  a  configuration  file  specified  using  the  -Dconf  JVM  environment variable. This is how the dev-config.edn file is loaded at development time. If you look at the :dev profile in project.clj, you’ll notice the following flag there: :jvm-opts ["-Dconf=dev-config.edn"].  Application Handler The guestbook.handler  namespace  is  responsible  transforming  all  of  our  route declarations into a single ring handler and wrapping them with shared mid- dleware using the middleware wrap-base in the app definition. The base middleware provides common functionality such as session and cookie management.  The ring router function aggregates the routes for handling all the requests to our application into a reitit Router. Below ring router we define our default ring handler, which serves application resources, WebJars, and error pages. The ring ring-handler function creates the top level ring handler from our application router and our default handler.  guestbook src clj guestbook handler.clj  ns guestbook.handler   :require  [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [guestbook.layout :refer [error-page]] [guestbook.routes.home :refer [home-routes]] [reitit.ring :as ring] [ring.middleware.content-type :refer [wrap-content-type]] [ring.middleware.webjars :refer [wrap-webjars]] [guestbook.env :refer [defaults]] [mount.core :as mount]     mount defstate init-app  :start   or  :init defaults   fn []      or  :stop defaults   fn []     :stop   mount defstate app-routes  :start  ring ring-handler   ring router  [ home-routes ]    ring routes  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   62   ring create-resource-handler  {:path " "}    wrap-content-type   wrap-webjars  constantly nil      ring create-default-handler  {:not-found  constantly  error-page {:status 404, :title "404 - Page not found"}    :method-not-allowed  constantly  error-page {:status 405, :title "405 - Not allowed"}    :not-acceptable  constantly  error-page {:status 406, :title "406 - Not acceptable"}  }       defn app []   middleware wrap-base 'app-routes    The app state is the core of the routing logic in the application, and any new routes that you add to the application must be included inside its  Router.  Application Middleware The guestbook.middleware namespace is reserved for any wrapper functions that are  used  to  modify  the  requests  and  responses.  The  main  purpose  of  the middleware is to provide a central place for handling common tasks such as CSRF protection.  If you recall, we had to specify an anti-forgery token when submitting forms in our guestbook application. This token is checked by the wrap-csrf middleware function. It checks each request to see if it contains a valid token and returns an error page if it doesn’t. This way we don’t have to remember to check for a CSRF token in each handler function eliminating potential errors.  The wrap-base function is used to tie all the common middleware together in the order of dependency. It also adds the ring-defaults middleware that we dis- cussed earlier.  Routing Requests  As we discussed earlier, application routes represent URIs that a client can call to perform an action or retrieve some data. Each route has a corresponding map that defines handler functions for allowed request methods, and includes any route-specific configuration. When we identify a specific workflow in our application, it makes sense to group all routes related to this workflow in a  report erratum     discuss   Think in Terms of Application Components   63  single namespace. These namespaces are typically placed in the routes package. Our  guestbook  app  only  has  one  workflow,  which  is  defined  in  the  guest- book.routes.home namespace.  guestbook src clj guestbook routes home.clj  ns guestbook.routes.home   :require [guestbook.layout :as layout] [guestbook.db.core :as db] [clojure.java.io :as io] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.response] [ring.util.http-response :as response]     defn home-page [request]   layout render request "home.html" {:messages  db get-messages }     defn save-message! [{:keys [params]}]  db save-message! params   response found " "     defn about-page [request]   layout render request "about.html"     defn home-routes []  ["" {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf  middleware wrap-formats]}  [" " {:get home-page}] [" message" {:post save-message!}] [" about" {:get about-page}]]   In home-routes, we have three separate routes each performing a distinct action. The   route is responsible for displaying a list of messages, along with a form to  write  new  messages.  The   message  route  is  responsible  for  handling  the creation of new messages. The  about route displays an image included in the Luminus template by default.  When  we  add  a  new  workflow  to  our  app,  we’ll  create  a  corresponding namespace in the routes package to keep the code manageable and to bundle together any workflow-specific configuration. Then we’ll add these routes to our router in the guestbook.handler namespace.  Application Model  All but the most trivial applications need some sort of a model. The model describes the data stored by the application and the relationships between individual data elements.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   64  When we use a relational database, it can often become the model for our application. Unlike object-oriented languages, Clojure does not require us to define a separate model in code and map it to the one defined in the database. Instead, the query results are represented by sequences of maps, where the keys correspond to the column names in the tables being queried.  All namespaces dealing with the model and the persistence layer traditionally live under the application’s db package. This is a topic that warrants further discussion, and we’ll revisit it later.  The guestbook database connection resides in the *db* variable. Note that the connection URL is populated using an environment variable called :database-url. This ensures that we’re not hardcoding our connection in the application or checking it into our repository.  In development mode, the connection variable is populated in the dev-config.edn file that’s used to keep the local configuration.  guestbook dev-config.edn {:dev true :port 3000 ;; when :nrepl-port is set the application starts the nREPL server on load :nrepl-port 7000 :database-url "jdbc:h2:. guestbook_dev.db"}  When you run the application in production, the database connection URL should be provided either in a separate production configuration file, such as prod-config.edn, or as an environment variable, like so:  export DATABASE_URL="jdbc:h2:. guestbook.db"  Keeping  all  the  environment  configuration  outside  the  application  ensures that the application is environment-agnostic. The same UberJar artifact build using the :uberjar profile can be put in different environments  e.g. development, staging, production  without any changes.  Application Layout The layout  namespace  is  reserved  for  providing  the  visual  layout  as  well  as other common elements for our pages.  guestbook src clj guestbook layout.clj  ns guestbook.layout   :require  [clojure.java.io] [selmer.parser :as parser] [selmer.filters :as filters] [markdown.core :refer [md-to-html-string]]  report erratum     discuss   Think in Terms of Application Components   65  [ring.util.http-response :refer [content-type ok]] [ring.util.anti-forgery :refer [anti-forgery-field]] [ring.middleware.anti-forgery :refer [*anti-forgery-token*]] [ring.util.response]    parser set-resource-path!  parser add-tag! :csrf-field  fn [_ _]   clojure.java.io resource "html"     anti-forgery-field      filters add-filter! :markdown  fn [content]   defn render  [:safe  md-to-html-string content ]    "renders the HTML template located relative to resources html" [request template & [params]]  content-type   ok   parser render-file  template  assoc params  :page template :csrf-token *anti-forgery-token*     "text html; charset=utf-8"     defn error-page  "error-details should be a map containing the following keys: :status - error status :title - error title  optional  :message - detailed error message  optional  returns a response map with the error page as the body and the status specified by the status key" [error-details] {:status :headers {"Content-Type" "text html; charset=utf-8"} :body   parser render-file "error.html" error-details }    :status error-details   The resource path is set to the resources html  folder. This sets the base template directory for the Selmer HTML templating library. Without setting the variable, we’d have to prefix all template names with html . Following the parser set-resource-path! call, a custom tag is defined for the CSRF field. We already saw this tag in action when we submitted the form in the last chapter.  Next, a filter is added for processing Markdown content in the HTML templates. We’ll take a closer look at how tags and filters work shortly.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   66  The render function sets some default keys on the context map used to generate the HTML from the template. Since these keys are common to all pages, it makes sense to keep them centralized in one place. The result of the function is a regular response map with the rendered template string set as the body.  We call it when we render our page in the guestbook.routes.home home-page function. It accepts the name of the template file located under resources html  and an optional map of context variables that will be used to inject dynamic content in the template.  Finally,  we  have  the  error-page  function  that  provides  a  common  layout  for rendering error pages in our application. This function is used to generate the 404 page in the handler, the 500 page for server errors, and the 403 page by the anti-forgery middleware.  The function accepts a map that contains the :status, the :title, and the :message keys. These are passed to the resources html error.html template in order to generate the error page.  Defining Pages  The pages are defined by creating routes that accept the request parameters and generate the appropriate response. A route can return HTML markup, perform a server-side operation, redirect to a different page, or return a spe- cific type of data, such as a JSON string or a file.  In many cases a page will have multiple route components. One route responds to GET requests and returns HTML to be rendered by the browser. The rest handle events such as AJAX requests or form submissions generated by the client when the user interacts with the page.  The  page  body  can  be  generated  by  any  means  we  choose,  since  Clojure architecture is highly modular. This leaves us with the option of using any templating library we like. The most popular choices are Hiccup and Selmer.4,5  Hiccup uses Clojure data structures to define the markup and generates the corresponding HTML from it. Selmer is modeled on the Django template system from Python and uses template tags to inject dynamic content into the page.6  In  this  book  we’ll  start  off  with  server-side  templates  written  with  Selmer. Then, we’ll cover single-page applications  SPAs  where most of the markup  4. 5. 6.  https:  github.com weavejester hiccup https:  github.com yogthos Selmer https:  docs.djangoproject.com en dev ref templates   report erratum     discuss   Managing Stateful Components   67  is generated on the client.7 The SPA approach nicely separates your applica- tion’s client and server components. Keeping the UI logic out of the server simplifies  creating  additional  clients,  such  as  native  mobile  applications, without the need to update the server.  Regardless of your favorite templating strategy, it’s good practice not to mix domain logic with representation. In a properly designed application, it should be relatively easy to swap out one client for another.  Managing Stateful Components  Most applications will rely on stateful external resources such as database connections and queues. These resources often have a life cycle associated with them. Typically, we would like to start such resources when our applica- tion initializes and stop them when it shuts down.  In order to facilitate a REPL-driven workflow, Luminus uses the Mount library to manage the life cycle of stateful resources in the application. This library treats  resources  as  variables  bound  to  namespaces.  This  approach  allows Mount  to  automatically  infer  the  order  that  the  components  need  to  be started from the namespace hierarchy. Naturally, this means that we should be careful with how we access these variables.  Conceptually, Mount takes the approach of encapsulating stateful resources using namespaces. This leads to a natural separation between the code that deals with state from the pure core of the application business logic.  It helps to treat the core business logic as you would a library. It should be completely independent from where the data is coming from and where it’s going. As a rule, we should avoid passing resources directly to our business logic. Instead, we should create a thin layer that deals with external resources and calls the business logic to process the data.  Keeping the logic that deals with IO at the edges of our application allows us to keep most of our code pure. This is valuable because pure code can be tested without needing to access the external resources or create mocks in their place. Pure code is also much easier to factor out into libraries when you find yourself wanting to share it across applications or with other devel- opers.  Luminus encourages keeping related logic close together. Therefore, in cases where we have functions that must rely on an external resource, the manage-  7.  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Single-page_application  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   68  ment  of  the  state  for  that  resource  should  ideally  be  handled  in  the  same namespace where the functions using it are defined. A namespace that con- tains a stateful resource with the functions that operate on it is analogous to an instance of a class in object-oriented languages.  Mount  uses  the  defstate  declarations  to  identify  stateful  resources.  It  then leverages the Clojure compiler to infer the order for starting and stopping the resources based on the namespace hierarchy. This approach allows us to use the Clojure compiler itself as the dependency injection mechanism.  For example, if namespace A contains a resource and depends on namespace B, which contains another resource, then state B will be started before state A. Conversely, the resources are stopped in the reverse order of the one they’re started in. Let’s take a closer look at how the state of the HTTP server in the guestbook.core namespace is managed.  guestbook src clj guestbook core.clj  mount defstate ^{:on-reload :noop} http-server  :start  http start   -> env  :handler  handler app     assoc  update :port  or  -> env :options :port  %    select-keys [:handler :host :port]     :stop  http stop http-server    The server instance is defined as the http-server var that’s declared using the defstate macro. The :start key calls the http start function. This function returns an instance of the running server. The :stop key calls the http stop function and passes it the http-server. These two functions are called by Mount when the mount.core start and mount.core stop functions are called, respectively. Finally, note that the ^{:on-reload :noop} annotation is used to indicate that the component should not be restarted on reload. This allows the server to retain its state when namespaces are reloaded during development.  As you can see, the defstate macro provides an elegant way to manage resource life cycle. It doesn’t require us to manage the dependencies manually or to pass a dependency graph around by hand. However, it can be useful to see the generated graph visually. This can be accomplished by running the states- with-deps function found in the mount.tools.graph namespace.  user=>  require '[mount.tools.graph :as graph]  user=>  graph states-with-deps   {:name "'guestbook.config env",  :order 1,  report erratum     discuss   Managing Stateful Components   69  :status {:started}, :deps {}} {:name "'guestbook.db.core *db*", :order 2, :status {:started}, :deps {"'guestbook.config env"}} {:name "'guestbook.core http-server", :order 3, :status {:started}, :deps {"'guestbook.config env"}} {:name "'guestbook.core repl-server", :order 4, :status {:started}, :deps {"'guestbook.config env"}}   We can see that the env state is started first and has no dependencies, *db* is started second since it depends on env, and so on. Mount lets us start only the specified states, as seen in the guestbook.test.db.core namespace. Since we only need the env and the *db* resources for testing the database, we omit starting other resources, such as the HTTP server.  guestbook test clj guestbook db core_test.clj  use-fixtures  :once  fn [f]   mount start 'guestbook.config env 'guestbook.db.core *db*   migrations migrate ["migrate"]  select-keys env [:database-url]    f     Conversely, we can choose to start and stop Mount with specific states omitted, as seen in the user namespace.  guestbook env dev clj user.clj  defn start  "Starts application. You'll usually want to run this on startup." []  mount start-without 'guestbook.core repl-server     defn stop  "Stops application." []  mount stop-except 'guestbook.core repl-server     defn restart  "Restarts application." []  stop   start    report erratum     discuss   Chapter 3. Luminus Architecture   70   defn restart-db  "Restarts database." []  mount stop 'guestbook.db.core *db*   mount start 'guestbook.db.core *db*   binding [*ns*  the-ns 'guestbook.db.core ]   conman bind-connection guestbook.db.core *db* "sql queries.sql"     This covers all the basics of how Mount is used in Luminus, but we encourage you to explore its other features at a later time.  What You’ve Learned  In this chapter you learned about the general layout of a Luminus application and  how  different  pieces  interact  with  one  another.  Hopefully,  you’re  now comfortable reading and understanding the code in the guestbook project we created in Chapter 1, Getting Your Feet Wet, on page 1. If this isn’t the case, you should reread this chapter and try the examples yourself using the REPL. Using the REPL to explore and experiment is often the most effective way to learn, and is a valuable skill itself.  So far we’ve focused on building a traditional application, where all the logic lives on the server and the client simply renders the HTML generated by the back end. In the next chapter we’ll revisit our guestbook project and see how it could be implemented as a single-page application  SPA  using ClojureScript for client-side scripting.8  8.  https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Single-page_application  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 4  Introducing Clojurescript  In the preceding chapters we wrote a typical server-side web application and learned how its components interact with one another. In this chapter we’ll look at ClojureScript and see how to use it to improve the way we write web applications.  As you’ve probably noticed, the separation between the client and the server portions of the application is not enforced. If we’re not careful, we could eas- ily  end  up  with  tightly  coupled  client  and  server  components.  This  could become a problem if we want to add a different client later on—for example, if we decided to create a native mobile version of our application.  Up to now, we’ve only been using Clojure on the back end. In this chapter we’ll look at ClojureScript, a dialect of Clojure that compiles to JavaScript. ClojureScript will allow us to bring Clojure to the browser. Let’s look at reasons why you might want to use ClojureScript for front-end development.  Understand ClojureScript  If you’ve worked with JavaScript, you’ve probably noticed that it has a few shortcomings. Still, JavaScript does have the advantage of being a standard programmable environment for all of the modern browsers. JavaScript has become an essential part of front-end development as the demand for rich client-side applications continues to grow.  It would be nice to leverage this platform with a robust programming language like  Clojure,  wouldn’t  it?  This  is  precisely  where  ClojureScript  comes  into play. Much like its cousin Clojure, ClojureScript embraces its hosting platform and  allows  seamless  interoperability  with  JavaScript.  We  can  continue leveraging mature JavaScript libraries while enjoying the benefits of Clojure language semantics.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   72  Finally, if you’re using Clojure on the server, then it’s possible to share code between the server and the client. One example where this is useful is valida- tion logic that can now be written in a single place.  You should be aware of a few details when using ClojureScript. Since Clojure- Script runs in the browser, you can’t leverage any code that relies on interfac- ing with Java. The syntax for interop with JavaScript is also slightly different from that for interacting with Java. Keep those facts in mind, though, and you’ll be fine.  JavaScript Interop  Interacting  with  JavaScript  is  remarkably  straightforward.  You  can  access any standard JavaScript objects using the js namespace, and use  .method js obj ...  notation to invoke a method of an object just as in Java. For example, if you want to make a logger that logs in to the console, you can write something like the following:   defn log [& items]   .log js console  apply str items     One thing that’s less obvious is the interaction with JavaScript object proper- ties.  To  access  these,  we  use   .-property obj   notation,  where  the  hyphen   -  indicates  that  we’re  referencing  a  property  and  not  a  method.  We  update properties by using set!. Here’s an example:   defn init []   let [canvas  .createElement js document "canvas"   ctx   .getContext canvas "2d" ]  ;;set properties  set!  .-width canvas  500   set!  .-height canvas  500   set!  .-fillStyle ctx  "black"   .fillRect ctx 0 0  .-width canvas   .-height canvas      In the preceding example we call the createElement and the getContext methods the same way we would call Java methods in Clojure. However, we access the width and height properties using the ClojureScript-specific .- interop syntax. We set the .-fillStyle property to the "black" string by calling set!.  Google Closure  ClojureScript leverages the Google Closure compiler.1 The compiler can perform a  number  of  optimizations,  such  as  dead  code  pruning,  to  produce  lean JavaScript output.  1.  https:  github.com google closure-compiler  report erratum     discuss   Add ClojureScript Support   73  You can leverage the Google Closure library’s2 rich API for common tasks, such  as  handling  AJAX  requests,  managing  cookies,  currency  formatting, and so on. This means that you don’t need to include any additional JavaScript libraries such as jQuery in order to accomplish these tasks.  Macros  Another way ClojureScript differs from Clojure is that you can’t mix macros with  regular  ClojureScript  source  inside .cljs  files.  You  have  to  place  them inside .clj or .cljc files in order for them to be compiled by the Clojure compiler.  There are two ways to access macros in ClojureScript. If a macro is defined in a Clojure namespace with the same name as a ClojureScript namespace, you can require them just like in Clojure. However, if there isn’t a correspond- ing  ClojureScript  namespace  you  have  to  explicitly  specify  that  you  are requiring macros like so:   :require-macros [app.macros :refer [fancy-macro]     ns my.app  Concurrency  While ClojureScript supports atoms, it has no software transactional memory and therefore no refs or agents. The binding semantics are slightly different as well, because there are no vars or runtime reification.  Aside from these differences, development in ClojureScript is very similar to that in regular Clojure. However, if you’re new to Clojure and ClojureScript, then we recommend exploring the official ClojureScript documentation3 before moving on.  Add ClojureScript Support  Currently,  our  guestbook  application  uses  server-side  rendering  and  the browser simply displays a static page. Let’s modify our project from Chapter 1,  Getting  Your  Feet  Wet,  on  page  1  to  be  a  single-page  application   SPA  using ClojureScript.  2. 3.  https:  github.com google closure-library https:  clojurescript.org   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   74  Using lein-cljsbuild  The easiest way to add ClojureScript support to a Clojure project is by using the lein-cljsbuild plugin.4 The plugin will compile the ClojureScript sources and output the resulting JavaScript in the specified location.  The first thing we have to do is to add the ClojureScript runtime dependency to  our  project.  Note  that  it’s  scoped  as  “provided”.  Since  we  are  outputting compiled JavaScript, it only needs to be present for development.  :dependencies [... [org.clojure clojurescript "1.10.764" :scope "provided"]]  Next, let’s update our project.clj to add the plugin, provide a default configuration for it, and include the generated javascript in our :resource-paths.  guestbook-reagent project.clj :resource-paths ["resources" "target cljsbuild"] :target-path "target %s " :main ^:skip-aot guestbook.core :plugins [[lein-cljsbuild "1.1.8"]] :cljsbuild {:builds {:app {:source-paths ["src cljs"]  :compiler {:output-to "target cljsbuild public js app.js"  :output-dir "target cljsbuild public js out" :main "guestbook.core" :asset-path " js out" :optimizations :none :source-map true :pretty-print true}}}}  :clean-targets ^{:protect false} [:target-path [:cljsbuild :builds :app :compiler :output-dir] [:cljsbuild :builds :app :compiler :output-to]]  The compiler configuration has the following options and compiler hints:    :source-paths — Specifies where to find ClojureScript source files   :resource-paths — Specifies the paths to static assets, such as the generated  JavaScript files produced by the ClojureScript build    :main — Used by the compiler to find the entry point for the compiled app   :asset-path — Used to specify where to look for supporting JavaScript assets  4.  https:  github.com emezeske lein-cljsbuild  report erratum     discuss   Add ClojureScript Support   75    :output-to — Outputs the name of the resulting JavaScript file   :output-dir — Specifies where the temporary JavaScript files will be generated   :source-map — Used to map from the compiled JavaScript to the original  ClojureScript source  Also, we added a :clean-targets key below the :cljsbuild key. This tells Leiningen that we would like to delete any JavaScript that is generated in the target cljsbuild folder when lein clean is run.  Now we’re ready to create a new source folder and a ClojureScript namespace called  guestbook.core  in  src cljs guestbook core.cljs.  Note  that  the  ClojureScript extension is .cljs, as opposed to the .clj extension for Clojure files. If the file ends with .clj it will still compile, but it will not have access to the JavaScript runtime.  We’ll  start  with  the  obligatory  “Hello,  World!”  to  make  sure  everything  is working  correctly.  First,  let’s  add  the  following  code  to  our  guestbook.core namespace:   ns guestbook.core   ->  .getElementById js document "content"    .-innerHTML   set! "Hello, World!"    When the script runs it will find the tag with the ID content on the page and set its inner HTML to “Hello, World!”.  Then, let’s update our resources html home.html template as follows:  guestbook-reagent-start resources html home.html {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}      {% endblock %} {% block page-scripts %}  {% script " js app.js" %}  {% endblock %}  We added a div with the ID content, and included our compiled javascript.  We’re now ready to see if our setup works. Let’s run the ClojureScript compiler to generate the app.js file we’re referencing in the template, and then start the server:  $ lein cljsbuild once Compiling ClojureScript... ... Compiling ["target cljsbuild public js app.js"] from ["src cljs"]...  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   76  Successfully compiled ["target cljsbuild public js app.js"] in ... seconds $ lein run ...  If everything went well, you should now see the “Hello, World!” text displayed when the page loads.  Automatic Re-compilation  This is the simplest way to compile ClojureScript, but it requires us to compile everything any time we make a change. There are a few other ways to compile ClojureScript during development that give us some nice features. The simplest approach is to use the incremental compilation feature by running lein cljsbuild auto. Using this approach, the compiler will watch for changes in the source and recompile JavaScript as needed. However, we still need to refresh our browser in order to see the changes.  Let’s try this out. Open a new terminal and run the following command:  $ lein cljsbuild auto Watching for changes before compiling ClojureScript... ...  cljsbuild  now  waits  for  you  to  make  changes  before  recompiling  the  relevant source files. Note that the compiler uses incremental compilation. Once the compiler finishes the initial compilation, any further changes are recompiled nearly instantly.  Let’s confirm that our code is automatically compiling by changing our text.   ns guestbook.core   ->  .getElementById js document "content"    .-innerHTML   set! "Hello, Auto!"    Now, take a look at the terminal where cljsbuild is running. It should look like this:  $ lein cljsbuild auto ... Compiling "target cljsbuild public js app.js" from ["src cljs"]... Successfully compiled "target cljsbuild public js app.js" in ... seconds.  This indicates that a recompilation of ClojureScript was triggered, and when we reload the page we should see the “Hello, Auto!” text rendered.  Now that we’ve got our code compiling automatically, let’s take a look at how to  build  UIs.  ClojureScript  ecosystem  offers  a  number  of  libraries.  The  report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   77  majority of these libraries are built on top of React.5 The specific library we recommend is called Reagent.6 This library is both simple and widely used.  Build the UI with Reagent  Reagent is more opinionated than React regarding component lifecycle. While React  is  agnostic  about  the  strategy  used  to  trigger  component  updates, Reagent  makes  this  decision  for  us.  Reagent  uses  a  data-driven  approach where  components  observe  the  state  of  reactive  atoms.  Components  just specify the state they’re concerned with, and reagent handles the lifecycle for us. As a result, we typically only need to implement the render functions of our components.  Before we can build our UI we need to add the Reagent dependency to our project:  :dependencies [... [reagent "1.0.0"]]  Since our dependencies have changed, we’ll also need to restart cljsbuild.  ... Successfully compiled "target cljsbuild public js app.js" in ... seconds. ^C $ lein cljsbuild auto Watching for changes before compiling ClojureScript... ...  In order to use Reagent, we have to require it in your namespace just like in Clojure. Let’s open up the guestbook.core ClojureScript namespace. Recall that it is found in the src cljs source folder and not the src folder that contains the Clojure source files. Update the namespace declaration to include the following require form:  Reagent  bases  its  UI  component  syntax  on  the  popular  templating  library called Hiccup.7 Hiccup uses plain data structures to represent HTML, so you   ns guestbook.core   :require [reagent.core :as r]  [reagent.dom  :as dom]    Reagent Components  5. 6. 7.  https:  reactjs.org  http:  reagent-project.github.io  https:  github.com weavejester hiccup  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   78  don’t have to learn a separate domain-specific language. Let’s render a com- ponent by calling the reagent.dom render function, like so:   dom render  [:h1 "Hello, Reagent"]  .getElementById js document "content"    reagent.dom render  takes  two  arguments:  A  component,  and  the  target  DOM node.  At this point our namespace should look like this:   ns guestbook.core   :require [reagent.core :as r]  [reagent.dom :as dom]     dom render  [:h1 "Hello, Reagent"]  .getElementById js document "content"    The HTML nodes are represented using a vector with the structure correspond- ing to that of the resulting HTML tag, as shown in the following example:  [:tag-name {:attribute-key "attribute value"} tag body]   tag body   Let’s put our h1 inside a div with id hello and class content.  [:div {:id "hello", :class "content"} [:h1 "Hello, Auto!"]]    Hello, Auto!    Since  setting  the id  and  the class  attributes  for  elements  is  a  very  common operation, Reagent provides CSS-style shorthand for these actions. Instead of what we wrote earlier, we could simply write our div as follows:  [:divhello.content [:h1 "Hello, Auto!"]]  Reagent also provides shorthand for collapsing nested tags into a single tag. The preceding code could be rewritten this way:  [:divhello.content>h1 "Hello, Auto!"]  The > indicates that the h1 tag is nested inside the div tag. This notation is very helpful with CSS frameworks, such as Bulma and Bootstrap, that rely on deeply nested tags to style elements.  As you can see, creating Reagent components takes very little code and pro- duces markup that’s easy to correlate back to the template definitions.  report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   79  Reimplementing the Form  By this point you should have an understanding of how you can create differ- ent  kinds  of  HTML  elements  using  Reagent.  Now  let’s  take  a  look  at  what makes Reagent truly special, how you can connect elements to data. We’ll bind the form that allows the user to input their name and a message to a Reagent atom that will contain the entered values. Also, thanks to Reagent, this binding goes both ways - if the data changes, so will the UI.  So far we’ve only looked at components that directly represent HTML. However, Reagent allows you to treat any function as a component. The function simply has to return either a Reagent vector or a component that can be rendered by  React  directly.  The  latter  becomes  useful  when  you  want  to  use  React libraries or create your own custom components. Let’s not worry about that just yet, though.  In our case, let’s create a function called message-form. The function uses a let statement  to  create  a  binding  for  the  atom  that  contains  the  form  data.  It then returns a function that generates the form and references the previously defined atom in the input fields of the following component:  guestbook-reagent-start src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn message-form []   let [fields  r atom {} ]   fn [] [:div [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"] [:input.input {:type :text :name :name :on-change  swap! fields  :value  :name @fields }]]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"] [:textarea.textarea {:name :message :value  :message @fields  :on-change  swap! fields  [:input.button.is-primary {:type :submit :value "comment"}]]     assoc :name  -> % .-target .-value    assoc :message  -> % .-target .-value  }]]  Here, we’re using a closure to create a local state for the fields binding, and then  returning  a  function  that  references  it.  Reagent  first  calls  the  outer  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   80  function, then calls the returned function whenever it renders the component. This preserves our local state and protects it from any external code, for better or worse. Also note that any arguments referenced in the outer function will retain the value they had when it is first called. This is sometimes useful for initialization tasks, but more often than not, you should get the arguments from the inner function instead. This is the most common bug with reagent, so be careful with your component arguments.  Note  that  we’re  using  the r atom  from  Reagent  instead  of  using  the  regular ClojureScript atom. Reagent atoms behave the same way as regular atoms, with  one  important  difference:  any  UI  components  that  reference  Reagent atoms will be repainted whenever the value of the atom is changed. When we want to create state we create an atom to hold it.  This  approach  automates  the  process  of  keeping  the  UI  in  sync  with  the model. With Reagent we’re able to write our UI in a declarative fashion and have it automatically render the current state of our model. Let’s see exactly how all this works by implementing the form in our guestbook application using Reagent.  Aside from that, the content of the form should look very familiar, since it closely mimics the HTML we used previously. The changes to note are that we’ve changed the form element to a div, and in addition we’ve added the :on- change  key  to  bind  the  input  and  the  textarea  elements  to  functions  that  are responsible for updating the fields atom with the current values entered by the user. These functions accept the DOM event object as their input and grab the value from its target.  Now, let’s create a home function that uses our mesage-form component:   ns guestbook.core   defn message-form []  ...   ...    defn home []  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds  [:div.columns>div.column  [message-form]]]   Note that we place the message-form in a vector instead of calling it as a function. This  allows  Reagent  to  decide  when  the  function  needs  to  be  evaluated  in case the component has to be repainted. Components can now be recomputed and repainted as the state of their corresponding atoms changes. We’ll see how this becomes important shortly.  report erratum     discuss   Finally, let’s change our render call to use our home function:  Build the UI with Reagent   81   ns guestbook.core   defn message-form []  ...   ...   ...    defn home []   dom render  [home]  .getElementById js document "content"    We should now be able to reload the page and see the form rendered there looking very much like the form we had previously. We can even type text in the  fields,  but  we  obviously  can’t  see  if  it’s  being  stored  anywhere.  Let’s modify the form to convince ourselves that the inputs are actually writing the data to our fields atom by adding the following elements to it:  guestbook-reagent-start src cljs guestbook core.cljs [:p "Name: "  :name @fields ] [:p "Message: "  :message @fields ]  Now we can clearly see that whenever the value of the name or the message field changes, it is immediately reflected in the atom. Once the value of the atom changes, then the component will be repainted and we’ll see the new values displayed on the screen.  Talking to the Server  At this point we’d like to take the values of the fields and send them to the server when we click the comment button. We’ll use the cljs-ajax8 library to communicate  with  the  server.  The  first  thing  we  need  to  do  is  to  add  a dependency for it in our project.clj file.  guestbook-reagent project.clj [cljs-ajax "0.8.1"] [org.clojure clojurescript "1.10.764" :scope "provided"] [reagent "1.0.0"]  Now  that  we’ve  added  the cljs-ajax  library  we  have  to  clean  out  the  existing generated JavaScript and restart the ClojureScript compiler. Let’s do that by running the following commands:  $ lein clean $ lein cljsbuild auto  8.  https:  github.com JulianBirch cljs-ajax  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   82  Watching for changes before compiling ClojureScript...  Now, let’s add the following reference in our namespace declaration [ajax.core :refer [GET POST]]:   ns guestbook.core   :require [reagent.core :as r]  [reagent.dom [ajax.core :refer [GET POST]]    :as dom]  This provides GET and POST functions that we’ll use to talk to our server. Let’s write a function that submits our form and prints the response:   defn send-message! [fields]   POST " message"  {:params @fields :handler  .log js console  str "response:" %   :error-handler  .error js console  str "error:" %  }    This function will attempt to POST to the  message route using the value of the fields atom as the params. The function uses the :handler and the :error-handler keys to handle the success and the error responses, respectively. We’re just logging the response for now to see how it behaves. Let’s hook this function up to our submit comment button by using the :on-click key, so we can test it out:  [:input.button.is-primary  {:type :submit :on-click  send-message! fields  :value "comment"}]  Let’s check the terminal to see that our ClojureScript recompiled successfully and then reload the browser window. When the page reloads, open up the browser console and click on the comment button.  error:{:status 403,  :status-text "Forbidden", :failure :error, :response " Invalid anti-forgery token "}  We got an error response! This error indicates that we did not supply the anti- forgery token in our request. If you recall, the server has anti-forgery protection enabled and requires the client to submit the generated token along with any POST  request.  Previously,  we  used  the {% csrf-field %}  tag  in  our  template  to supply the token. Since we’re now using an AJAX call instead of a form sub- mission, we’ll have to provide this field another way.  First, let’s update our home.html template to create a hidden field with the value of the token:  report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   83  guestbook-reagent resources html home.html {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}      {% endblock %} {% block page-scripts %}  {% script " js app.js" %}  {% endblock %}  Now, let’s set the token as an x-csrf-token header on our request. While we’re at it, let’s also set the Accept header to application transit+json:   defn send-message! [fields]   POST " message"  {:format :json :headers {"Accept" "application transit+json" "x-csrf-token"  .-value  .getElementById js document "token"  } :params @fields :handler  .log js console  str "response:" %   :error-handler  .log js console  str "error:" %  }    We  set  the  Accept  header  to  tell  the  server  we’d  like  to  get  the  response encoded using Transit.9 With Transit, Clojure data structures are tagged when they’re encoded. This means that we can send data structures like keywords, sets,  and  dates  without  worrying  about  them  being  converted  to  strings, vectors, or numbers. We can also extend Transit with our own readers and writers,  but  we  won’t  get  into  that  here.  Let’s  reload  our  page  and  give  it another try.  We’re no longer getting an error, but we’re getting an HTML response instead of data. Our original code for the  message route used the redirect function to display the page after attempting to add the message. This means it’s sending us  the  HTML  for  the  redirect  page.  This  time  around  we  want  to  return  a Transit response indicating success or failure. Let’s update our save-message! function as follows:  guestbook-reagent src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn save-message! [{:keys [params]}]   if-let [errors  validate-message params ]  response bad-request {:errors errors}   try   db save-message! params   response ok {:status :ok}   catch Exception e  9.  https:  github.com cognitect transit-format  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   84   response internal-server-error {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to save message!"]}}       The updated function will return a 400 response when validation fails, a 200 response when it’s saved successfully, and a 500 response in case of errors.  Note that we do not have to manually deserialize the request nor serialize the response in our route. This is handled by the Muuntaja library.10 The library checks the Content-Type header in the request and deserializes the content based on that. The response is serialized to the format specified in the Accept header. The cljs-ajax library defaults to using the transit format. If you recall, we explicitly set the Accept header to transit as well. No additional work is needed on your part.  Let’s reload the page and try it out. When we try to POST invalid parameters, we should see a response in the console that looks similar to the following:  error:{:status 400,  :status-text "Bad Request", :failure :error, :response {:errors {:message  "message is less than the minimum" }}}  When we submit a valid request, we should see the following printed instead:  response:{:status :ok}  Notice that in the first case our error-handler was triggered, while in the second case our success handler function is triggered. The cljs-ajax library uses the status code in the response to select the appropriate handler.  Now that we’re communicating with the server, let’s update our code to display the errors on the page. We’ll use the clojure.string namespace’s join function, so let’s add it to our namespace’s require statement first:   ns guestbook.core   :require ...  [clojure.string :as string]    Then, let’s update our code like so:  guestbook-reagent-start src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn send-message! [fields errors]   POST " message"  {:format :json :headers {"Accept" "application transit+json" "x-csrf-token"  .-value  .getElementById js document "token"  } :params @fields  10. https:  github.com metosin muuntaja  report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   85  :handler  fn [r]   .log js console  str "response:" r    reset! errors nil    :error-handler  fn [e]   .log js console  str e    reset! errors  -> e :response :errors   }     defn errors-component [errors id]   when-let [error  id @errors ]  [:div.notification.is-danger  string join error ]     defn message-form []   let [fields  r atom {}   errors  r atom nil ]   fn [] [:div [:p "Name: "  :name @fields ] [:p "Message: "  :message @fields ] [errors-component errors :server-error] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"] [errors-component errors :name] [:input.input {:type :text :name :name :on-change  swap! fields  :value  :name @fields }]]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"] [errors-component errors :message] [:textarea.textarea {:name :message :value  :message @fields  :on-change  swap! fields  [:input.button.is-primary {:type :submit :on-click  send-message! fields errors  :value "comment"}]]     assoc :name  -> % .-target .-value    assoc :message  -> % .-target .-value  }]]  The updated code uses a second atom called errors to store any errors received from the server. We pass the errors to the send-message! function. The function now either clears the errors on success or sets the errors from the response.  We also created a new component called errors-component that accepts the errors and the field ID. It checks if any errors are associated with the ID and returns an alert with the message if that’s the case. This component requires the clo- jure.string library, so remember to require [clojure.string :as string] in your namespace declaration. If the component sees no errors, we simply return a nil. Reagent  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   86  will handle this intelligently and omit the component in that case. You can see that with the new approach the errors are showing up just as they did in the previous version.  Share Code With the Client  Using the same language on the client and the server allows us to share code between them. Doing so avoids duplication and reduces the chance for errors and  unexpected  behaviors.  Also,  we’ll  be  able  to  run  validation  client-side and avoid calling the server entirely if the input data is invalid.  Let’s update our project to extract validation into a namespace that will be cross-compiled  to  both  Clojure  and  ClojureScript.  The  first  step  will  be  to create a new source folder called src cljc, and update the source paths in project.clj to include it.  guestbook-cljc project.clj ;;Clojure Source Paths :source-paths ["src clj" "src cljc"] ;;... ;;ClojureScript Source Paths :cljsbuild {:builds  {:app {:source-paths ["src cljs" "src cljc"] :compiler «compiler options»}}}  With the new source folder in place, let’s create a new namespace called vali- dation in src cljc guestbook validation.cljc. Note that the file extension is cljc, this hints the compiler that this file will be cross-compiled to both Clojure and Clojure- Script.  Next, let’s move the validation code from the guestbook.routes.home namespace to the guestbook.validation namespace:  guestbook-cljc src cljc guestbook validation.cljc  ns guestbook.validation   :require [struct.core :as st]     def message-schema  [[:name  st required st string] [:message st required st string {:message "message must contain at least 10 characters" :validate  fn [msg]  >=  count msg  10  }]]    defn validate-message [params]  report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   87   first  st validate params message-schema     The updated guestbook.routes.home namespace will now require the validate-message function from the guestbook.validation namespace:  guestbook-cljc src clj guestbook routes home.clj  ns guestbook.routes.home   :require [guestbook.layout :as layout] [guestbook.db.core :as db] [clojure.java.io :as io] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.response] [ring.util.http-response :as response] [guestbook.validation :refer [validate-message]]    Let’s restart the application to confirm that server-side code still works cor- rectly. Now, we can turn our attention to the client where we can start using the validate-message function to ensure that the message content is valid before sending it to the server.  We’ll require the guestbook.validation namespace the same way we did earlier:  guestbook-cljc src cljs guestbook core.cljs  ns guestbook.core   :require [reagent.core :as r] [reagent.dom :as dom] [ajax.core :refer [GET POST]] [clojure.string :as string] [guestbook.validation :refer [validate-message]]    Then we’ll add the validation check in the send-message! function:  guestbook-cljc src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn send-message! [fields errors]   if-let [validation-errors  validate-message @fields ]   reset! errors validation-errors   POST " message"  ;;...      The updated code will attempt to validate the message before making the Ajax call. If any errors are returned by the validate-message function those will be set in the errors atom shortcutting the need for server-side validation.  The advantage of this approach is that we’re able to reduce server load by avoiding making Ajax calls with invalid data. Of course, the server will still have the final say since it’s using the same validation logic.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   88  Reimplementing the List  Now that our form is working as expected, let’s turn our attention to displaying the messages on the page. In order to do that, we’ll have to add a route on the server to return the list of messages, create a component to display the messages, and add a function on the client to fetch them.  Since we’re no longer baking the messages in our page, let’s update our home- page function to render the HTML on load without any parameters.  guestbook-reagent src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn home-page [request]   layout render request "home.html"    Next, let’s add a route that returns the message list:  guestbook-reagent src clj guestbook routes home.clj  defn message-list [_]   response ok {:messages  vec  db get-messages  }     defn home-routes []  ["" {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf  middleware wrap-formats]}  [" " {:get home-page}] [" messages" {:get message-list}] [" message" {:post save-message!}] [" about" {:get about-page}]]   Let’s write a function called get-messages that calls our route and retrieves the messages.  The  function  accepts  an  atom  as  a  parameter  and  populates  it with the retrieved messages in the handler.  guestbook-reagent src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn get-messages [messages]   GET " messages"  {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"} :handler  reset! messages  :messages %  }    Note  that  we  are  not  required  to  pass  the  anti-forgery  header  for  the  GET requests, and we can safely omit it when retrieving messages from the server.  Now let’s write a component that uses the messages atom to render the mes- sages in the same format we had in our server-side template:  guestbook-reagent src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn message-list [messages]   println messages  [:ul.messages  report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   89   for [{:keys [timestamp message name]} @messages]  ^{:key timestamp} [:li [:time  .toLocaleString timestamp ] [:p message] [:p " - " name]] ]   The only thing to note in this function is that we’re using the ^{:key timestamp} annotation for each element in the ul. This allows Reagent to efficiently check if  a  particular  element  needs  to  be  re-rendered.  We  could  safely  omit  the annotation in this case, but it could result in loss of performance for big lists.  The ^{} notation is used to supply metadata in Clojure.11 The metadata is a map that can contain annotations for a symbol or a collection. In our case the metadata is used to provide a unique identifier key for each item in the collection.  Finally, let’s update our home component function to use an atom called mes- sages to store the state of the message list.  guestbook-reagent-start src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn home []   let [messages  r atom nil ]   get-messages messages   fn []  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Messages"] [message-list messages]] [:div.columns>div.column [message-form]]]     We’ve  changed  home  to  be  a  closure  like  our  form  component,  but  there’s something extra. The component calls the get-messages function on the messages when it is first mounted, then returns it’s render function. Reagent will render home, including message-list, while the value of messages is still nil. When the get- messages function finishes, the messages atom is reset with the messages from the server and the message-list component is then repainted automatically.  This provides us with an extremely powerful mechanism for connecting pro- ducers  and  consumers  of  data  in  our  application.  The get-messages  and  the message-list functions have no direct coupling between them and are not aware of each other. The Reagent atoms provide a way for any component to observe the  current  value  in  the  model  without  having  the  knowledge  of  how  and when it’s populated.  11. http:  clojure.org reference metadata  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   90  One last thing we need to do is to add the message we submit to the server to the list of messages on the page. We can do that in the handler of the send- message! function. The function currently accepts the fields and the errors as its parameters. Let’s update it to also accept the messages atom and append our message to it if the server returns a success:  guestbook-reagent src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn send-message!

If  necessary,  we  could update our server to return the newly created message, but we’ll skip this for the sake of simplicity.  Finally, let’s update the form function to accept the messages and pass it to save-message!, and the home function to pass the messages to it as a parameter:  guestbook-reagent src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn message-form [messages]   let [fields  r atom {}   errors  r atom nil ]   fn [] [:div [errors-component errors :server-error] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"] [errors-component errors :name] [:input.input {:type :text :name :name :on-change  swap! fields  :value  :name @fields }]]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"]  assoc :name  -> % .-target .-value    report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   91  [errors-component errors :message] [:textarea.textarea {:name :message :value  :message @fields  :on-change  swap! fields  assoc :message  -> % .-target .-value  }]]  [:input.button.is-primary {:type :submit :on-click  send-message! fields errors messages  :value "comment"}]]      defn home []   let [messages  r atom nil ]   get-messages messages   fn []  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Messages"] [message-list messages]] [:div.columns>div.column [message-form messages]]]     Let’s refresh the browser and see what we’ve got.  It looks mostly correct, but we have this ugly [TaggedValue: LocalDateTime, ...]. This is  because  we’re  encoding  a java.time.LocalDateTime,  and  transit  doesn’t  know how to decode it by default. We could write an encoder and decoder for this type, but for the sake of simplicity we’ll just use java.util.Date objects since they are supported by default.  To do this, we’ll need to change how we extend the next.jdbc.result-set ReadableColumn protocol for java.sql.Timestamp to return a java.util.Date instead of a java.time.LocalDate- Time.  Currently,  we  just  have  the  default  implementation  provided  by  the luminus  template.  We’ll  leave  the  implementation  of  the  protocol  for  other classes unchanged, since we only need to worry about timestamps for now.  The first thing we need to do is write a function to convert a java.sql.Timestamp into  a  java.util.Date.  Luckily,  luminus  includes  the  clojure.java-time12  library  by default. This library has a bunch of helpers for working with java time classes.  First, let’s require java-time and refer the java-date helper:  guestbook-reagent src clj guestbook db core.clj  ns guestbook.db.core   :require [java-time :refer [java-date]] [next.jdbc.date-time]  12. https:  github.com dm3 clojure.java-time  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   92  [next.jdbc.result-set] [conman.core :as conman] [mount.core :refer [defstate]] [guestbook.config :refer [env]]    Next, let’s write a helper function to convert a java.sql.Timestamp into a java.util.Date like so:  guestbook-reagent src clj guestbook db core.clj  defn sql-timestamp->inst [t]   -> t   .toLocalDateTime   .atZone  java.time.ZoneId systemDefault    java-date     Finally,  let’s  update  our extend-protocol  form  for next.jdbc.result-set ReadableColumn to use our new function for its two methods like so:  guestbook-reagent src clj guestbook db core.clj  extend-protocol next.jdbc.result-set ReadableColumn  java.sql.Timestamp  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Timestamp v _]   sql-timestamp->inst v     read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Timestamp v _2 _3]   sql-timestamp->inst v    java.sql.Date  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Date v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Date v _2 _3]   .toLocalDate v     .toLocalDate v    java.sql.Time  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Time v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Time v _2 _3]   .toLocalTime v     .toLocalTime v     There  we  go.  Now  all  timestamps  returned  from  database  queries  will  be instances  of java.util.Date.  This  will  make  serialization  and  conversion  much more straightforward.  It is worth noting that use of java.util.Date instead of the java.time classes is not generally recommended. There is a lot of nuance to do with time which is not captured by java.util.Date, and that can lead to a lot of trouble in the long run. However, since these nuances aren’t relevant to the app in its current state, and since proper handling of java.time classes and their corresponding goog.date JavaScript classes is tedious and not very instructive, we will skip it for now. See Appendix 3, Working with EDN and Transit, on page 389 if you’d like to read about encoding and decoding java.time and goog.date classes.  report erratum     discuss   Build the UI with Reagent   93  Now that we’ve switched to Reagent, submitted messages will be appended to the list of displayed messages when the server confirms that it was saved successfully. Unlike with the previous version of the app, we do not have to reload the entire page or even the list of messages. We simply add the new message to the list, and Reagent takes care of repainting the component for us.  Reagent is built on UI components responding reactively to changes in some dereffable state. It provides many different tools, including atoms, to create and manage state effectively. As we continue with ClojureScript, we’ll discover many other tools reagent gives us to manage state.  State in Reagent  The fact that Reagent can automatically re-render the UI when necessary is powerful,  but  it  doesn’t  give  us  any  guidance  on  how  to  actually  organize state. Atoms can either be created as global variables or within closures for individual components, or we can choose to pass data from an atom that has already been dereferenced. All of these options have benefits and drawbacks, so it can be difficult to choose correctly. Moreover, an incorrect choice can make applications significantly harder to maintain.  State  is  where  most,  if  not  all,  of  your  application’s  complexity  lives.  Most components  will  care  about  very  specific  pieces  of  state.  This  means  any changes to application state can be complex and far-reaching. For example, consider a sortable, searchable, paged, message inbox. We are viewing the second page of messages that contain the word “foo”, sorted by most recent, with a page size of 20 and we clear the search. We should go back to page 1, refresh our message list, and display a loading icon until we get our refreshed message  list,  all  while  maintaining  our  page  size  of  20  and  sort  order.  We need to be careful not to bake our sorting choice into our message list, as it should be sorted when we reload it. We also need to be careful to make sure our paging accounts for changes in page size sensibly. This already sounds fairly complex, and it’s just a list of messages with some common features.  A good rule of thumb is to keep the application state in a global atom and to use local atoms with caution, only where performance or isolation demands it. Reagent provides some basic tools like cursors and tracks13 to preserve isolation or reusability even when everything shares a single global atom, but this is often not enough. Most large applications will use a framework built  13. http:  reagent-project.github.io docs master ManagingState.html  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   94  on top of Reagent that uses these tools to provide a nice API for managing state.  Managing State with Re-Frame  The most popular Reagent-based framework is Re-Frame. Re-Frame places all its state in one global atom which it calls the app-db. The only way to read from the app-db is using Re-Frame subscriptions, and the only way to write to the app-db is by dispatching Re-Frame events. Note that even though the app- db can only be accessed this way, we can still include regular Reagent atoms in a Re-Frame application and manage them ourselves.  Let’s get Re-Frame set up in our guestbook application so we can see how it works.  First,  just  like  we  did  with  cljs-ajax,  let’s  add  it  to  our  project’s dependencies:  guestbook-rf-intro project.clj [cljs-ajax "0.8.1"] [org.clojure clojurescript "1.10.764" :scope "provided"] [reagent "1.0.0"] [re-frame "1.1.2"] ;add re-frame  restart the ClojureScript compiler:  $ lein clean $ lein cljsbuild auto Watching for changes before compiling ClojureScript...  and require it in our namespace declaration:  guestbook-rf-intro src cljs guestbook core.cljs  ns guestbook.core   :require [reagent.core :as r] [reagent.dom :as dom] [re-frame.core :as rf] [ajax.core :refer [GET POST]] [clojure.string :as string] [guestbook.validation :refer [validate-message]]    Now we’re ready to get started with Re-Frame. Let’s upgrade our Reagent app into a Re-Frame app.  Introducing Re-Frame  One of the main goals of Re-Frame is to, wherever possible, remove state and logic from UI components. This has many benefits. Having all of your applica- tion logic operate independent of how it renders allows you to write front-end tests based on data, rather than UI. It allows you to more easily port your  report erratum     discuss   Managing State with Re-Frame   95  client to different platforms like React Native or Electron. And it makes writing and reusing UI components easier, as they are just pure functions from data to hiccup. We’ll see many more benefits as we continue on, so let’s get started.  Since the only way to write to the app-db is through events, the first thing we need to do is write an initialize event. Let’s add an initialize event to guest- book.core:  guestbook-rf-intro src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :app initialize  fn [_ _]  {:db {:messages loading? true}}    This is what a re-frame event looks like. An event is composed of a handler function and a keyword that identifies it  :app initialize . An event handler is a function  that  takes  two  arguments  and  returns  an  effects  map.  Here,  our event handler ignores its arguments and returns a map with one effect - :db. This  effect  tells  re-frame  to  set  the app-db  to  the  returned  value.  There  are many different effects, and you can even define your own, but for now we will only be using the :db effect. Note that with our initialize event, we have set :messages loading? to true. Let’s add a subscription that checks if our messages are loading and update our home component to trigger the initialize event and to only display our message list once it is fully loaded.  guestbook-rf-intro src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-sub :messages loading?  fn [db _]   :messages loading? db      defn home []   let [messages  r atom nil ]   rf dispatch [:app initialize]   get-messages messages   fn []   if @ rf subscribe [:messages loading?]   [:div>div.row>div.span12>h3 "Loading Messages..."] ;;...       We never set loading to false! let’s add an event to save our messages and clear the loading flag, and then add a dispatch to our get-messages callback.  report erratum     discuss   While we’re at it, let’s add a subscription to our message list and use it instead of an atom in home.  Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   96  guestbook-rf-intro src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-db :messages set  fn [db [_ messages]]   -> db   assoc :messages loading? false  :messages list messages       rf reg-sub :messages list  fn [db _]   :messages list db []      defn get-messages []   GET " messages"  {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"} :handler  rf dispatch [:messages set  :messages % ] }     let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]   defn home []  ;;...      Notice, we’ve used rf reg-event-db. This is a helper functions for events which only use the db effect. It unwraps the db from the co-effects map  the first argument , and wraps your return with {:db ...}. Now our messages are display- ing after they’re loaded, but we’ve missed a step. Loading isn’t the only way we modify our message list. If we try to add a new message, we’ll get an error like this in the web console:  Error: Assert failed: Reaction is read only; on-set is not allowed  fn?  .-on-set a   ratom.cljs:360:4  Why is this? We changed messages from an atom to a subscription, but we’re still trying to use swap! in send-message! to update it. Let’s register another event handler to address this and update our send-message! function.  guestbook-rf-intro src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-db :message add  fn [db [_ message]]   update db :messages list conj message      defn send-message! [fields errors]   if-let [validation-errors  validate-message @fields ]   reset! errors validation-errors   POST " message"  {:format :json  report erratum     discuss   Managing State with Re-Frame   97  :headers {"Accept" "application transit+json" "x-csrf-token"  .-value  .getElementById js document "token"  } :params @fields :handler  fn [_]   rf dispatch [:message add  assoc @fields :timestamp  js Date.  ]   reset! fields nil   reset! errors nil    :error-handler  fn [e]   .log js console  str e    reset! errors  -> e :response :errors   }     Since  our  form  doesn’t  read  messages,  let’s  also  remove  messages  from  its arguments and its call to send-message!.  guestbook-rf-intro src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn message-form []   let [fields  r atom {}   errors  r atom nil ]   fn [] [:div [errors-component errors :server-error] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"] [errors-component errors :name] [:input.input {:type :text :name :name :on-change  swap! fields  :value  :name @fields }]]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"] [errors-component errors :message] [:textarea.textarea {:name :message :value  :message @fields  :on-change  swap! fields  [:input.button.is-primary {:type :submit :on-click  send-message! fields errors  :value "comment"}]]     assoc :name  -> % .-target .-value    assoc :message  -> % .-target .-value  }]]   defn home []   let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]   rf dispatch [:app initialize]   get-messages   fn []  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 4. Introducing Clojurescript   98   if @ rf subscribe [:messages loading?]   [:h3 "Loading Messages..."] [:div [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Messages"] [message-list messages]] [:div.columns>div.column [message-form]]] ]     Now that we’ve finished moving our message list into re-frame, let’s take a look back at what we’ve done and why. We’ve replaced our messages atom with a :messages list subscription for reading, and two events, :messages set and :mes- sage add for modifying. Our components haven’t changed much. Our message- list is still parametrized, and just as reusable. Our message-form can now only save to one place, but this could easily be changed by passing the submit function as an argument.  Overall, re-frame has given us several benefits with no substantial drawbacks. Since any updates must pass through events, we have a single place to add validation and preprocessing. Since our view now uses subscriptions, we can easily change displayed messages without touching components or changing how data is stored. These are quite significant advantages, especially for the maintenance of large front-end applications.  This is just a small taste of what re-frame can do. In later chapters we’ll learn about interceptors, effects, subscription chaining, and much more.  What You’ve Learned  In this chapter you’ve learned how using ClojureScript can make your app cleaner and more feature-rich. You’ve learned about how reagent manages components via dereffables to allow views to be specified declaratively without sacrificing performance. And you’ve learned about re-frame’s event-subscrip- tion model for managing application state and seen how it makes apps more flexible, robust, and manageable.  In the next chapter, we’ll look at setting up professional ClojureScript devel- opment tools and how to use them to improve the architecture and features of our guestbook. We’ll set up a Swagger service API, a REPL connected to the browser, and a re-frame debugger. Then, we’ll connect to our server using WebSockets  to  facilitate  bidirectional  communication  and  live  message updates. In the process, we’ll explore more of the design philosophy behind Re-Frame and learn some of it’s more advanced features.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 5  Setting Up for Success  Our guestbook concept is working well, but we aren’t getting much value over our original server-rendered version. In fact, you could argue that we’ve added unnecessary complexity. Let’s talk about some of the reasons why the new design will provide a better foundation for growth and enhancement.  Users interact with the application via the interface rendered by the browser. Any time a user performs an action, such as clicking a button, or entering data in a field, they’re updating the state of the application. Web applications typically track this state via user sessions. The more features an application has, the more complicated this session state will be. There are three ways this state could be managed.  The first approach we could take is to manage sessions entirely on the server and reload the page on each request. This approach is only practical when our state rarely changes as the entire page has to be sent to the browser and rendered to reflect the outcome of a user action.  This problem can be addressed by the second approach: adding code that runs in the browser to dynamically update parts of the page based on user actions. Unfortunately, this approach introduces a new problem: client-side logic now also has to track its own version of the session state. Keeping the state in sync between the client and the server is an additional challenge that often leads to elusive bugs and user frustration.  The logical extension of the second approach is to handle session state man- agement  entirely  on  the  client  supported  by  a  lightweight  set  of  stateless services.  With  this  third  approach,  we’re  back  to  having  state  managed  in one place, but we don’t have to compromise on features or responsiveness. This is commonly referred to as the Single Page Application  SPA  style.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   100  In  addition  to  simplifying  state  management,  the  SPA  style  provides  some other significant benefits. Having a clear separation between client and server code  makes  it  easier  to  compartmentalize  work,  and  allows  for  alternative clients such as Android, iOS, or desktop. These clients will be able to leverage the same API that’s already being used by the existing web client.  Since the rendering and session state management are become the responsi- bility of the client, we end up freeing up the server directly leading to handling larger concurrent client loads.  Finally, keeping the server stateless provides a clear path to horizontal scaling as your application usage grows.  As you can see, the nature of web applications has evolved over the years towards the thick client model where the user interface and application state are managed on the client. Clojure is a relatively new language and its web ecosystem  evolved  to  embrace  the  SPA  approach  as  opposed  to  traditional server-side rendering. This may be the reason why server-side frameworks have not gained traction in Clojure ecosystem. Much of the complexity moved from the server to the client, and so did the frameworks.  Now that we’ve discussed some of the reasons for why it’s desirable to build our application using SPA style, let’s formalize this approach in our architec- ture.  We’ve  already  refactored  our  original  server-rendered  guestbook  to handle user-interface to the client with ClojureScript, and we have an informal AJAX  API  between  the  client  and  the  server.  The  next  step  is  to  create  an explicit service API on the server.  Services We’ll factor out the API endpoints from the guestbooks.routes.home into a separate guestbook.routes.services namespace. The endpoints in the home namespace will be responsible for serving HTML and related assets to be used by the web browser to render the page. Meanwhile, the services namespace will provide a data API  e.g. JSON, EDN…  to be used by the client over AJAX.  The key motivation for separating our page rendering code and the API end- points is to facilitate maintainability. Keeping all of our logic in one place has been manageable so far, but it will require discipline to keep things organized as our application grows. We should separate our model logic early so that it doesn’t become entangled with our routing going forward. We should also separate our API routes  i.e. endpoints responsible for querying and modifying data   from  our  application  routes   i.e.  our  webpages .  As  our  app  grows,  report erratum     discuss   Services   101  having a well documented, validated, and tested API to build against will be invaluable.  The ability to interact with our data independently of a heavyweight client allows us to tailor our views to the needs of our users as they evolve. This approach also makes it easier to work on tasks independently. New service endpoints  can  be  implemented  and  tested  independent  of  the  client  UI development. Conversely, we can mock out the data that we expect to receive on the client and develop the UI independent of the server.  Guestbook Messages Let’s  create  a  new  namespace  called  guestbook.messages  that  is  dedicated  to managing  guestbook  messages.  We  want  this  to  be  separate  from  guest- book.routes.home so that it can be used by any type of service we expose, not just HTTP.  guestbook-services-1 src clj guestbook messages.clj  ns guestbook.messages   :require [guestbook.db.core :as db] [guestbook.validation :refer [validate-message]]     defn message-list []  {:messages  vec  db get-messages  }    defn save-message! [message]   if-let [errors  validate-message message ]   throw  ex-info "Message is invalid"  {:guestbook error-id :validation :errors errors}     db save-message! message     We moved most of this code from guestbook.routes.home, but we’ve left behind anything that is related to HTTP. We changed validation to throw an error if it  fails.  Any  handling  of  errors  and  reporting  to  users  should  be  managed externally.  Now, let’s update our guestbook.routes.home namespace to use our new functions in guestbook.messages and handle validation errors:  guestbook-services-1 src clj guestbook routes home.clj  ns guestbook.routes.home   :require [guestbook.layout :as layout] [guestbook.messages :as msg] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.http-response :as response]    ;;...  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   102   defn save-message! [{:keys [params]}]   try   msg save-message! params   response ok {:status :ok}   catch Exception e   let [{id  :guestbook error-id  errors :errors}  ex-data e ]   case id  :validation  response bad-request {:errors errors}  ;;else  response internal-server-error {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to save message!"]}}        ;;...  defn message-list [_]   response ok  msg message-list     Finally, let’s check the browser and make sure we didn’t break anything.  Configuring a Service API  Now  that  we  have  our  model  separated  from  our  webserver,  we’ll  separate our web services from our web application.  Let’s move the GET  messages and POST  message endpoints to guestbook.routes.ser- vices under the  api  route:  guestbook-services-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj  ns guestbook.routes.services   :require [guestbook.messages :as msg]  report erratum     discuss   Services   103  [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.http-response :as response]     defn service-routes []  [" api" {:middleware [middleware wrap-formats]} [" messages" {:get  fn [_]   response ok  msg message-list   }]  [" message" {:post  fn [{:keys [params]}]   try   msg save-message! params   response ok {:status :ok}   catch Exception e   let [{id  :guestbook error-id  errors :errors}  ex-data e ]   case id  and remove them from guestbook.routes.home:  guestbook-services-2 src clj guestbook routes home.clj  ns guestbook.routes.home   :require [guestbook.layout :as layout] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware]     defn home-page [request]   layout render request "home.html"     defn about-page [request]   layout render request "about.html"     defn home-routes []  ["" {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf  middleware wrap-formats]}  [" " {:get home-page}] [" about" {:get about-page}]]   :validation  response bad-request {:errors errors}  ;;else  response internal-server-error {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to save message!"]}}      }]]   report erratum     discuss   In order for our service routes to show up, we need to connect them to our handler, like so:  Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   104  guestbook-services-2 src clj guestbook handler.clj  ns guestbook.handler   :require ;;... [guestbook.routes.services :refer [service-routes]] ;;...    ;;...  mount defstate app-routes  :start  ring ring-handler   ring router  [ home-routes   service-routes ]   ;;...     And finally, we need to update our URLs on the client to reflect our changes:  guestbook-services-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn get-messages []  GET " api messages"  {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"} :handler  rf dispatch [:messages set  :messages % ] }    ;;...  defn send-message! [fields errors]   if-let [validation-errors  validate-message @fields ]   reset! errors validation-errors   POST " api message"  ;;...       Swagger Tools  Now we have all of our services in one place. This allows us to use service specific tools, like Swagger, more easily.  Our routing library, Reitit, has first class support for a very popular Service API tool called Swagger. Swagger gives us plenty of benefits, like a generated JSON Schema, but the most tangible at the moment is Swagger UI. Swagger UI will give us the ability to visualize and interact with our services through an auto-generated web UI. Let’s get it set up and see what it can do for us:  guestbook-swagger-1 src clj guestbook routes services.clj  ns guestbook.routes.services   :require [reitit.swagger :as swagger]  report erratum     discuss   Services   105  [reitit.swagger-ui :as swagger-ui] [guestbook.messages :as msg] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.http-response :as response]     defn service-routes []  [" api" {:middleware [middleware wrap-formats] :swagger {:id ::api}} ["" {:no-doc true} [" swagger.json" {:get  swagger create-swagger-handler }] [" swagger-ui*" {:get  swagger-ui create-swagger-ui-handler  {:url " api swagger.json"} }]]  ;;... ]   As you can see, Swagger endpoints are regular routes that point to handler functions generated by calling swagger create-swagger-handler and swagger-ui create- swagger-ui-handler respectively. At this point we can navigate to the  api swagger- ui  route in the browser and see our service endpoints. But, we’re not quite ready to use it. Swagger needs some information about the type of data that each endpoint expects and returns in order to function properly.  Let’s see what we’ve got. First, let’s try out the GET  api messages endpoint by clicking to expand, pressing “Try it out”, and then pressing “Execute”.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   106  Great!  We  can  see  a  curl  command  that  this  request  corresponds  to,  the request URL, the response body we got back from the server, the response code, and the response headers. Our route is working as expected.  Next let’s try out our POST  api message route. When we expand it, all we see is “Try it out!” just like our other endpoint, but something isn’t right. We know that we have to specify a message to POST, but there is no way to input this information. If we try clicking the button, we see that we get an error back.  report erratum     discuss   Services   107  This is because our handlers are just functions. In order for swagger to know what the route expects we need some way to specify that information when the route is declared. Thankfully, Reitit provides a way to specify the shape of our requests and responses that can be used by Swagger, Muuntaja, and Spec Coercion.  Coercion and Validation with Reitit  Now that we have Swagger UI showing up, let’s get it configured properly.  When server and client communicate, data must be encoded somehow  e.g JSON . Since we’re working with full-stack Clojure, it would be nice to use Clojure data structures. However, what if we wanted to have other clients? This is what Muuntaja does. Muuntaja decodes the request body based on the Content Type header, and encodes the response body using the Accept headers.  Unfortunately, many data formats, such as JSON, represent only a subset of  EDN.  When  we’re  dealing  with  these  formats,  we’ll  often  need  to  coerce from one type to another. This is handled by coercion middleware that will try to coerce the value based on the type specified in the endpoint specs. Our handlers won’t need to be concerned with this, since all they’ll see is a clojure data structure, and their return value will be coerced into whatever response format was requested.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   108  As we discussed in Define the Routes with Reitit, on page 42 middleware can be specified for a specific context. Reitit provides a suite of ring middleware1 for accomplishing common tasks. This middleware also has richer features that leverage reitit itself. Let’s replace middleware wrap-formats with the middleware that  Reitit  provides.  Although  it’s  more  complex,  it  provides  functionality essential to real-world web services, such as declarative coercion and valida- tion of parameters.  First, let’s require the necessary Reitit namespaces:  guestbook-swagger-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj  ns guestbook.routes.services   :require [reitit.swagger :as swagger] [reitit.swagger-ui :as swagger-ui] [reitit.ring.coercion :as coercion] [reitit.coercion.spec :as spec-coercion] [reitit.ring.middleware.muuntaja :as muuntaja] [reitit.ring.middleware.exception :as exception] [reitit.ring.middleware.multipart :as multipart] [reitit.ring.middleware.parameters :as parameters] [guestbook.messages :as msg] [guestbook.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.http-response :as response] [guestbook.middleware.formats :as formats]    Then, let’s update the options map for our " api " context like so:  guestbook-swagger-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj {:middleware [;; query-params & form-params  parameters parameters-middleware ;; content-negotiation muuntaja format-negotiate-middleware ;; encoding response body muuntaja format-response-middleware ;; exception handling exception exception-middleware ;; decoding request body muuntaja format-request-middleware ;; coercing response bodys coercion coerce-response-middleware ;; coercing request parameters coercion coerce-request-middleware ;; multipart params multipart multipart-middleware]  :muuntaja formats instance :coercion spec-coercion coercion :swagger {:id ::api}}  1.  https:  metosin.github.io reitit ring ring.html  report erratum     discuss   Services   109  Notice that we added some additional attributes: :muuntaja and :coercion. This is how Reitit enriches middleware. As we mentioned in Extend Ring, on page 37, we can provide a custom muuntaja instance. Luminus actually provides an instance by default in  .middleware.formats. With Reitit’s version of the Muuntaja middleware stack, we can specify which instance to use with the :muuntaja key. The :coercion key is similar, but is used by Reitit’s coercion middleware.2  We’ve also added a :swagger attribute. This will be inherited by all child routes of   api   and  designate  them  as  part  of  the  swagger  API  with  id  ::api.  If  we wanted to, we could have as many apis as we like, or we could omit the id to include all routes on our ring-handler. We’ll use the single ::api id so that our home-routes aren’t included in our API.  Now  that  we  have  our  context  updated,  we  have  to  update  our  individual routes to make use of the middleware we just added. For coercion, we’ll use Clojure Spec3 along with the Spec Tools4 library. This allows us to provide a specification  for  each  route’s  parameters  and  responses.  Let’s  add  a  data- spec5 to our GET  api messages endpoint for our 200 OK response like so:  guestbook-swagger-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" messages" {:get {:responses {200 {:body ;; Data Spec for response body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst?}]}}}  :handler  fn [_]   response ok  msg message-list   }}]  Data-specs  are  maps  shaped  like  our  data,  but  with  predicates  instead  of values. Our response body must be a map where the :messages key contains a vector of maps that each have :id as a positive integer, :name and :message as strings, and a :timestamp as an instant. We declare the shape of our data as regular clojure data structures, and the types of the leaves as predicates.  2. 3. 4. 5.  https:  metosin.github.io reitit ring coercion.html https:  clojure.org guides spec https:  github.com metosin spec-tools https:  github.com metosin spec-tools blob master docs 02_data_specs.md  report erratum     discuss   Next, let’s add a data-spec for the parameters passed to POST  api message:  Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   110  guestbook-swagger-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" message" {:post {:parameters {:body ;; Data Spec for Request body parameters {:name string? :message string?}}  :responses {200 {:body map?} 400 {:body map?} 500 {:errors map?}} :handler  fn [{{params :body} :parameters}]   try   msg save-message! params   response ok {:status :ok}   catch Exception e   let [{id  :guestbook error-id  errors :errors}  ex-data e ]   case id  :validation  response bad-request {:errors errors}  ;;else  response internal-server-error {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to save message!"]}}      }}]  The :parameters map looks very similar to the :responses map we wrote before. One subtle change is the shape of the request map passed to our handler function.  Before,  the  guestbook.middleware wrap-formats  middleware  placed  our parameters  under  :body-params,  but  reitit-ring’s  parameter  middleware  stack places parameters based on where they originate. In this case, our parameters are under [:parameters :body], so we’ve changed how we destructure the request accordingly.  Debugging Reitit Middleware  We’ve added a bunch of middleware for incrementally transforming our request and response maps. This is a very powerful and effective way to add function- ality that cuts across our application, such as validation and coercion. How- ever, it does have a drawback. As your middleware stack gets larger, it can become very hard to debug due to the sheer number of separate functions  report erratum     discuss   Services   111  modifying every request map. Fortunately, reitit allows us to specify our mid- dleware as a vector so we can easily inspect between each step. Furthermore, it provides the :reitit.middleware transform option to allow endpoints to specify a transformation  function  to  apply  to  the  middleware  stack.  This  is  fairly advanced so we won’t go into advanced use cases, but we’ll highlight a useful transformation function provided by reitit: reitit.ring.middleware.dev print-request-diffs. To use the print-request-diffs tool, do the following inside the guestbook.handler namespace.   ns guestbook.handler   :require  ;;... [reitit.ring.middleware.dev :as dev]     mount defstate app-routes  :start  ring ring-handler   ring router [ home-routes   service-routes ] {:reitit.middleware transform dev print-request-diffs}   ;;...     We recommend doing this manually when debugging is neccessary, as it is quite noisy.  When an HTTP request is received by the ring router, it will log a diff for each middleware so that you can identify where each change to the request map is happening.  Try it out and see what is logged.  If you post a new message, you should get something like the following:  --- :request---  {:async-channel  , :body  , :character-encoding "utf8", :content-length 50, :content-type "application json", :cookies { }, :flash nil, :form-params {}, :headers { }, :multipart-params {}, :params {}, :path-params {}, :query-params {},  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5.

These are the maps received by, and returned from the router respectively. Since we have some middleware being applied outside of reitit, our :request map already has some parsed keys on it. Be aware that this tool will not help with debugging those middlewares.  In between, we have a :request printed for each middleware in order, and then a :response printed in reverse order. We can see annotations with + and or - to  denote  the  change,  addition,  or  removal  of  a  value  in  the  request  and response maps.  It isn’t often that you’ll have to use this tool, but it is invaluable when you need it.  Using Swagger UI  Now that we have Swagger properly configured, let’s open Swagger UI in the browser again and see what’s changed.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   114  Swagger has read our data-specs and now provides us with example requests and responses. We can now select “Try it out” and Swagger UI will provide us with a JSON Skeleton to fill in.  Then, if you click “Execute” to submit your request you should get something like this in the Responses section:  report erratum     discuss   Services   115  You might have noticed that we didn’t try to send an EDN request. This is because  there  is  a  bug  in  Swagger  UI  v3.44.0   the  latest  version  available when this book was published  that prevents sending an application edn request. Since we’ll be using EDN fairly extensively throughout this book, we’ll down- grade to Swagger UI v2.x. However, if this bug has since been resolved, feel free to continue on with the latest version of Swagger UI.  Luckily, the process for downgrading is straightforward. Simply add the fol- lowing dependency to your project.clj:  [metosin ring-swagger-ui "2.2.10"]  Now restart the application and take a look at Swagger UI:  It looks and behaves a bit differently, but it is more or less the same. Click on the POST  api message endpoint to expand it and switch the parameter and response content type dropdowns to application edn.  Now we should be able to fill in our request like so:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   116  When we click the “Try it out!” we should get a response like this:  We now have a way to organize our service endpoints in a structured way, and  an  interactive  API  documentation  page.  Let’s  move  on  to  tools  for  our front-end.  report erratum     discuss   ClojureScript Development Tools   117  ClojureScript Development Tools  We have a repl set up on the backend, but all we have on the frontend is re- compilation. We can do better. To this end we will introduce two tools: shadow- cljs and Re-Frame-10x.  Shadow-cljs There are several tools other than lein-cljsbuild available for adding ClojureScript support to a Clojure project. Let’s update our project to use shadow-cljs6 to compile ClojureScript. Note that you will need to have NPM7 installed before following  along  with  this  section.  By  switching  to  shadow-cljs,  we’ll  gain seamless  integration  with  NPM  modules  and  ClojureScript  hot  loading. Shadow-cljs watches your ClojureScript files and sends compiled changes to the browser through a Websocket without requiring the browser to refresh. It also provides us with a ClojureScript REPL connected to the browser. This is invaluable because it allows us to make incremental changes to our appli- cation without losing any built-up state.  There are other similar tools that don’t require NPM, such as Figwheel8 and Figwheel Main,9 but we’ll use shadow-cljs because we’ll be using NPM modules later on. While it’s posible to use NPM with other tools, shadow-cljs is by far the simplest in this regard.  Let’s get shadow-cljs configured and see what it can do. Shadow-cljs can be installed via NPM by running the following command:  $ npm install -g shadow-cljs  Next,  we’ll  need  to  create  a  configuration  file  for  shadow-cljs  called shadow- cljs.edn. This file will have the following content:  guestbook-shadow shadow-cljs.edn {:nrepl {:port 7002} :builds {:app {:target :browser  :output-dir "target cljsbuild public js" :asset-path " js" :modules {:app {:entries [guestbook.app]}} :devtools {:watch-dir "resources public"}}  :test {:target :node-test, :output-to "target test test.js"  :lein true}  :autorun true}}  6. 7. 8. 9.  https:  github.com thheller shadow-cljs https:  www.npmjs.com  https:  github.com bhauman lein-figwheel https:  figwheel.org   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   118  The configuration hints shadow-cljs that it’s being used within a Leiningen project with the :lein key being set to true. Using this flag hints shadow-cljs to  read  the  ClojureScript  source  path  information  from  project.clj.  The  :nrepl specifies  the  port  that  nREPL  will  be  started  on,  this  port  can  be  used  to connect the editor to the browser REPL. Take a look at Appendix 2, Editor Configuration, on page 385 for details if you wish to set this up. Finally, the :builds  key  specifies  different  build  configurations.  The :app  configuration  is used to compile the application for running in the browser, while the :test key specifies an alternative test configuration that compiles the tests and runs them using Node.js. We won’t get into configuring ClojureScript tests just yet, so  you  can  safely  ignore  it  for  now.  We’ll  come  back  to  it  in  ClojureScript Testing, on page 337.  Shadow-cljs uses NPM to manage Node.js modules, and so we’ll need to create a package.json file and declare NPM dependencies there:  guestbook-shadow package.json {  "devDependencies": {  "shadow-cljs": "^2.11.14"  }, "dependencies": {  "react": "17.0.1", "react-dom": "17.0.1", "xregexp": "^4.4.1"  }  }  The xregexp module has been added because they are required by the Struct validation library, while the React modules will be used by Reagent. Note that if  you  forget  to  include  these  dependencies  shadow-cljs  will  usually  tell  you exactly what you need to install.  At this point we no longer need the cljsbuild configuration in project.clj since we’ll be using shadow-cljs to build ClojureScript from this point on. We can now remove the following items from project.clj: 1. The plugin lein-cljsbuild 2. 3.  :cljsbuild key along with its configuration :clean-targets key along with the cljsbuild targets.  Next, we need to add shadow-cljs and Closure compiler dependencies in order for shadow-cljs to work. Also, we need to add "src cljs" to our top-level :source-paths, since cljsbuild is no longer configuring this for us.  report erratum     discuss   While we’re updating our project.clj, we’ll also add cljs-devtools,10 a library that enhances compatibility with Chrome DevTools.  ClojureScript Development Tools   119  ;; Add these dependencies [com.google.javascript closure-compiler-unshaded "v20200830" :scope "provided"] [org.clojure google-closure-library "0.0-20191016-6ae1f72f" :scope "provided"] [thheller shadow-cljs "2.11.14" :scope "provided"] ;; Update source paths :source-paths ["src clj" "src cljs" "src cljc"] ;; Add devtools dependency to dev profile :project dev { ;; ...  :dependencies [ ;; ...  [binaryage devtools "1.0.2"]]}  The first thing we have to do is separate our initialization logic from our ren- dering logic. If we call  rf dispatch [:app initialize]  from the home component, then our app-db will be reset whenever we try to re-mount our components. We’ll also need to annotate our mount-components function with :dev after-load so that it is called whenever our code is reloaded. Let’s write our initialization like so:  guestbook-shadow src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn home []   let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]   fn []  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds  if @ rf subscribe [:messages loading?]   [:h3 "Loading Messages..."] [:div [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Messages"] [message-list messages]] [:div.columns>div.column [message-form]]] ]      defn ^:dev after-load mount-components []   rf clear-subscription-cache!   .log js console "Mounting Components..."   dom render ['home]  .getElementById js document "content"    .log js console "Components Mounted!"     defn init!

Setting Up for Success   120   mount-components    We also need to make sure our init! function is called somewhere, and we may want to do some development specific initialization. We can accomplish this by using environment specific source paths just like we did in Running Code Selectively, on page 56. Let’s create a file at env dev cljs guestbook app.cljs with our development initialization logic:  guestbook-shadow env dev cljs guestbook app.cljs  ns ^:dev once guestbook.app   :require [devtools.core :as devtools] [guestbook.core :as core]     enable-console-print!   println "loading env dev cljs guestbook app.cljs..."   devtools install!   core init!   Then, lets update our :project dev leiningen profile in project.clj to include env dev cljc and env dev cljs in :source-paths:  :project dev {...  :source-paths ["env dev clj" "env dev cljc" "env dev cljs"]}  Since NPM modules are managed using NPM, we’ll need to install them by running the following command:  $ npm install  Now let’s restart our server and start shadow-cljs in the terminal:  cli version:...  $ npx shadow-cljs watch app shadow-cljs - config: guestbook shadow-cljs.edn node:... shadow-cljs - running: lein run -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli --npm watch app ...

Now, let’s get a REPL connected to the browser.  Connect your editor to the shadow-cljs nREPL on port 7002  See Appendix 2, Editor Configuration, on page 385 for details . If you need to connect from the terminal instead of your editor, you can do so by running the following command:  $ npx shadow-cljs cljs-repl app shadow-cljs - config: ... shadow-cljs.edn shadow-cljs - connected to server cljs.user=>  cli version: X.X.X  node: vX.X.X  Let’s run a command from the REPL to confirm that we’re connected:  cljs.user=>  js alert "Hello from shadow-cljs"   In the browser, we should see an alert like this:  The alert blocked the REPL process, but once we handle it in the browser by clicking “OK”, it returns. Once the alert is dismissed, you’ll see nil printed in the REPL, which is the result of running the js alert function, followed by the REPL prompt.  cljs.user=>  js alert "Hello from shadow-cljs"  nil cljs.user=>  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   122  Now we have a REPL connected to the browser which is pretty great, but let’s not forget about live code reloading. We have some logging in our mount-compo- nents function to make sure it is being called on reload. We also have some logging in our init! function and in the top-level of guestbook.app to confirm that they aren’t being re-run. Let’s add a log statement to the top-level of guest- book.core temporarily so we can see when the file is being evaluated.  guestbook-shadow-demo src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn ^:dev after-load mount-components []   rf clear-subscription-cache!   .log js console "Mounting Components..."   dom render ['home]  .getElementById js document "content"    .log js console "Components Mounted!"     defn init!

When we save the file, we should see a compilation notificaton in our shadow- cljs watch app terminal, and we should see our top level and mount-components log statements, but not our init! or our guestbook.app log statements.

Let’s call init! from the repl to make sure our changes were loaded:  cljs.user=>  guestbook.core init!  nil cljs.user=>  Now we should see the following in the browser console:  Initializing App... Mounting Components... Components Mounted!  Now  we’ve  confirmed  that  changes  to  functions  are  showing  up  live  in  the browser without refreshing the page, and that our mount-components function is called whenever shadow-cljs reloads code. Let’s try building up some state  report erratum     discuss   ClojureScript Development Tools   123  and see how shadow-cljs handles it. For the sake of demonstration, let’s mark any comments posted in this client by adding “[CLIENT]” to the username.  guestbook-shadow-demo src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn send-message! [fields errors]   if-let [validation-errors  validate-message @fields ]   reset! errors validation-errors   POST " api message"  {:format :json :headers {"Accept" "application transit+json" "x-csrf-token"  .-value  .getElementById js document "token"  } :params @fields :handler  fn [_]   rf dispatch [:message add  -> @fields   assoc :timestamp  js Date.    update :name str " [CLIENT]"  ]    reset! fields nil   reset! errors nil    :error-handler  fn [e]   .log js console  str e    reset! errors  -> e :response :errors   }     Without refreshing the browser, let’s post a comment and see if the change is reflected.  It’s updated. Now, if we refresh the browser the “[CLIENT]” annotations will disappear.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   124  This  is  because  the  success  callback  in send-message!  modifies  the  message after it is sent to the server. The message is saved without the annotation, but the client annotates it before adding it to the app-db.  However, if we update our message-list component, we will change the way all messages are displayed. Let’s add an @ before the author’s name to see this in action. While we’re at it, let’s also see how our form state behaves with shadow-cljs. First, let’s make a message that has the “[CLIENT]” annotation. Then, let’s write a message with no name filled in and try sending it so we have  a  validation  error  in  our errors  atom  and  a  message  draft  in  our fields atom. Now, without refreshing, let’s add our @ to our message-list component:  guestbook-shadow-demo src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn message-list [messages]  [:ul.messages  for [{:keys [timestamp message name]} @messages]  ^{:key timestamp} [:li [:time  .toLocaleString timestamp ] [:p message] [:p "@" name]] ]   Your messages should look like this:  report erratum     discuss   ClojureScript Development Tools   125  Our  message-list  has  updated  to  reflect  our  changes,  and  it  even  kept  our “[CLIENT]”  annotations,  but  our  message-form  input  and  errors  have  been cleared! Why could this be? It’s because our message-form state is stored in a closure.  When shadow-cljs reloads, we re-mount our root component home and this destroys and recreates all child components. That means a brand new message- form component with brand new fields and errors atoms. The message-list preserves the “[CLIENT]” annotations because they are stored in re-frame’s app-db, and the app-db is not touched when shadow-cljs reloads code.  Now that we have a feel for how state behaves with reagent, re-frame, and shadow-cljs, we can make informed decisions on whether to use closures or the  app-db.  Generally,  using  closures  to  store  state  locally  is  preferred  in libraries and general purpose components, and global state like re-frame’s app-db is preferred for application specific components.  Since our form is specific to our application, we’ll refactor it to use re-frame. But first, we should tidy up a bit, install re-frame-10x, and test our production build. Let’s remove our top-level log, our “[CLIENT]” annotation, and change our @ back into to a dash. Then, let’s also configure our :uberjar profile before we forget.  Remember, since our  “[CLIENT]” annotations are stored in our app-db, they won’t be cleared by hotloading. To get rid of them, we could refresh the page, but we can also clear them manually by calling get-messages from the REPL:  cljs.user=>  guestbook.core get-messages  object[Object [object Object]]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   126  Now that we’ve tidied up, let’s check out our next tool, re-frame-10x.  cljs.user=>  Re-Frame-10x  Our next development task is to refactor our app to make better use of re- frame. In fact, as our app grows, most of our client’s complexity will be in re- frame events and subscriptions. To manage this, we’ll use a re-frame aware debugging and inspection tool.  There are two popular tools for debugging re-frame: re-frisk11 and re-frame-10x.12 re-frame-10x is the more full-featured tool, but it can get slow in large applica- tions. We’ll use re-frame-10x here since it will be useful for learning about re- frame. It shouldn’t slow us down much, since our application is fairly small. Check out re-frisk’s documentation for instructions if you’d like to try it out. Re-frame-10x is a helpful and feature-rich re-frame dashboard that allows us to inspect our DB, see our event history, check subscriptions, profile perfor- mance, and more. Let’s get it set up and see what it can do.  Since it is a development tool, we’ll install it inside our :project dev profile. Add this entry to your :dependencies,  guestbook-10x project.clj [day8.re-frame re-frame-10x "0.7.0"]  and update the :app build’s :dev and :devtools in shadow-cljs.edn like so:  guestbook-10x shadow-cljs.edn {:target :browser :output-dir "target cljsbuild public js" :asset-path " js" :modules {:app {:entries [guestbook.app]}} :dev {:closure-defines {"re_frame.trace.trace_enabled_QMARK_" true}} :devtools {:preloads [day8.re-frame-10x.preload]  :watch-dir "resources public"}}  and re-frame-10x  is  installed.  Let’s  start  up  our  application  and  shadow-cljs servers, and see re-frame-10x in action. Open the app in the browser and press Ctrl-H  to toggle the dashoard.  11. https:  github.com flexsurfer re-frisk 12. https:  github.com Day8 re-frame-10x  report erratum     discuss   ClojureScript Development Tools   127  There’s a lot going on here, so let’s break it down. At the top, there is a textbox showing the most recent event. To its left is the previous epoch button, which reverts the state to before the displayed event. To its right is the next epoch button, which will move the state forward by one event, and the skip to latest epoch button, which will set the app state to after the latest event.  Let’s  try  out  the  time  travel  function.  Write  and  submit  a  message  in  our message-form. We can see that re-frame-10x has picked up the change, and there is a new event displayed. Click the previous epoch button. We’ve undone the event, and our app is as it was before the event happened. Remember that this is only in the browser, so our message is still on the server.  Below, we have the main panel of the dashboard. It has six tabs and a replay button.  The replay button will set the app state to immediately before the selected event and re-dispatch it. This is very useful for debugging event handlers. We  can  edit  and  reload  our  event  handler  with  shadow-cljs,  then  we  can replay it. It will be dispatched from the exact state where we discovered the bug, but it will be handled by our new handler. We don’t have to reproduce our buggy state for every edit, we can just click replay.  The features above are all actions, but the six tabs of our dashboard allow us to inspect different aspects of our current state. We’ll cover some of these tabs in greater detail as we refactor and extend our client. For now, here’s a brief description of each tab.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   128  Event  Fx  App-db  Subs  Trace  Timing  Shows how your handler computes its effect map. It is nifty, but it requires extra setup and is experimental. We’ll ignore it for now.  Shows us the Effects, Co-Effects, and Interceptors of this event. This tab is useful, but advanced. We’ll come back to it.  Allows us to inspect paths of our App-DB. This tab is especially useful.  Shows us which subscriptions were created, run, destroyed, or not run due to this event’s occurrence. Very useful for understanding an app’s behaviour.  Similar to the Subs tab, but more low-level. Tells us what occurred due to this event, and the time each action took. Allows us to look at reagent events, such as component re-rendering, as well.  Shows us the time it takes for the event to be handled and the UI to be updated.  Gives  us  a  high-level  look  at  our  performance  so  we  can  dig deeper with the Trace tab if necessary.  If you’d like to see re-frame-10x in action, the project’s README13 has a great interactive demo.  The importance of a tight feedback loop  Now that we’ve spent a good amount of time on setup, let’s reflect on why.  As we mentioned earlier when we introduced the Clojure REPL, one of the biggest advantages of using Clojure is the excellent development tooling. It is imperative to have as little friction as possible, and as much insight into your application as possible during development. If you are able to quickly experiment with your application and see first-hand what the results are, you are able to learn naturally and build a deep understanding of the problems you’re solving. This is a much better circumstance for building proficiency and insight than relying solely on documentation and reference implementa- tions.  13. https:  github.com Day8 re-frame-10x blob master README.md  report erratum     discuss   ClojureScript Development Tools   129  If it is a burden to tinker with a problem, developers are much more likely to accept something as “good enough” and move on. From our experience, being unable to easily explore leads to quicker accumulation of technical debt and reliance on “cargo-culting”. So, if you encounter pain points during develop- ment, we strongly advise that you research solutions thoroughly and imple- ment  your  own  if  they  don’t  exist.  You’ll  be  a  happier,  more  productive developer and your co-workers and community will thank you for it.  Production Build profile  Finally, let’s configure and test our production build so we can get back to actually building our application. Since we’ve changed the way we compile ClojureScript, we need our production build profile accordingly. We need to update our :source-paths to include env prod cljs, and we need to add the shadow- cljs release task to our :prep-tasks. Let’s update our :uberjar profile like so:  guestbook-10x project.clj :source-paths :prep-tasks ["compile"  ["env prod clj" "env prod cljc" "env prod cljs"]  ["run" "-m" "shadow.cljs.devtools.cli" "release" "app"]]  The change we made to :source-paths is straightforward, but :prep-tasks are new. By default, leiningen will run the compile task for us. However, if we specify our own :prep-tasks, we need to tell leiningen when to call compile explicitly. After "compile", we have a vector that starts with "run". This tells leiningen to invoke the run task, passing the rest of the vector as arguments. By calling run with the -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli flag, we’re calling shadow-cljs release through leinin- gen.14 This task will compile our ClojureScript with advanced optimization to improve performance and reduce bundle size.  $ lein run -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli release app'  Note that  and  $ npx shadow-cljs release app  are equivalent, but the former can be invoked from Leiningen. This is what allows  us  to  use  shadow-cljs  from :prep-tasks.  While  it  is  possible  to  do  this with any shadow-cljs task, we recommend using shadow-cljs directly in most cases.  14. https:  shadow-cljs.github.io docs UsersGuide.html_running_tasks_directly_from_leiningen  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   130  Now that our project.clj is updated, let’s write our production guestbook.app. Since we won’t be using any development tools, it will be very straightforward. We’ll just make *print-fn* do nothing so that any debugging won’t be printed and call  guestbook.core init! .  guestbook-10x env prod cljs guestbook app.cljs  ns guestbook.app   :require [guestbook.core :as core]    ;;ignore println statements in prod  set! *print-fn*  fn [& _]    core init!   Let’s make sure that everything works as intended by creating an UberJAR and running it  we’ll use our dev-config.edn instead of writing our prod-config.edn right now . First, let’s stop our application and shadow-cljs servers, and clean any stale files. Then, let’s build and run our UberJAR:  $ lein clean $ lein uberjar Compiling guestbook.env Compiling guestbook.core ... [:app] Compiling ... ... [:app] Build completed.  XXX files, XXX compiled, 0 warnings, XX.XXs  Created ...guestbook target uberjar guestbook-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar Created ...guestbook target uberjar guestbook.jar $ java -jar -Dconf=dev-config.edn target uberjar guestbook.jar  Now that our UberJAR is running, let’s open our app in the browser. In the web  console,  we  see  our  log  statements  from init!  and mount-components,  but since we’re using env prod cljs, we don’t see our guestbook.app log statement. We’ve confirmed that our app builds correctly for production, so let’s refactor our form.  Embracing Re-Frame  In Managing State with Re-Frame, on page 94 we introduced re-frame at a glance, but we didn’t really go into detail. Now that we have our environment set up, let’s take a closer look at re-frame and why we chose it.  At its core, re-frame only does two things. It defines our view using layers of pure  functions   i.e.  subscriptions ,  and  it  defines  state  transitions  as  data  i.e. events  to be handled using pure functions  i.e. event handlers . Re-frame  report erratum     discuss   Embracing Re-Frame   131  provides plenty of useful features on top of these two things, but fundamen- tally re-frame just queries and updates state.  Let’s take a look at how re-frame handles views first, then we’ll look at state transitions  afterwards.  We’ll  have  to  move  some  of  our  logic  into  re-frame events, but we won’t worry too much about correctness until later.  Views in Re-Frame  Every application has to get from its state to a rendered view in some manner. In fact, this is often the most complicated and volatile part of web applications. Reagent provides the foundation by conceiving of views as pure computations on  pieces  of  data,  but  re-frame  goes  a  step  further.  Re-frame  models  view computation as four layers in a signal graph: the app-db at the root, then direct subscriptions, then derived subscriptions, and finally view components  i.e. reagent  components   at  the  leaves.  When  a  node’s  input  signals  change  it recomputes its value from the new inputs. If its value has changed, it will send its new value as an input to downstream nodes. These will cascade until a layer has no changes or until a leaf node is changed. If a leaf changes, it triggers a component repaint via reagent and our user sees the change.  Layer 1 - The app-db  Re-frame insists on a single data store at the root of our app. Having a single  source  of  truth  greatly  simplifies  view  computation  and  ensures data consistency.  Layer 2 - Direct Subscriptions  Direct subscriptions pull data out of our app-db’s structure, they are pure functions of app-db. This layer loosens the coupling of complex logic  in  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   132  layer 3  to the structure of our app-db. It also provides some performance benefits by reducing how often derived subscriptions are recomputed.  Layer 3 - Derived Subscripions  Derived subscriptions don’t depend on our app-db directly, but instead are pure functions of one or more subscriptions  direct or derived . This is where complex application logic belongs. Since they listen to Layer 2 and not the app-db, they are only recomputed when necessary. This layer is optional in small apps, but can be quite significant in larger apps.  Layer 4 - View Components  View components connect our subscriptions to reagent. These are just reagent components that use subscriptions. To get the most leverage out of re-frame, we’ll try to make these view components as straightforward as possible. They should just be adapters between re-frame and the DOM. All interaction with app state should be via subscriptions and events.  By  separating  our  view  logic  into  layers,  we  can  make  sure  that  it  isn’t duplicated  across  our  application.  This  makes  computation  more  efficient and prevents us from accidentally missing components when we update our code.  Let’s refactor our view to use re-frame. We’ll move all of our state into the app- db, and access it via subscriptions. While we’re at it, we’ll also replace our function calls with event dispatches. We haven’t talked about state transitions in re-frame yet, so we’ll keep our handlers basic for now. We’ll come back and clean them up when we discuss state transitions in Events and Effects in Re- Frame, on page 151.  Updating our View Our home and message-list components can stay the same, but our message-form has local state and calls send-message!. Let’s update message-form to use re-frame. First, let’s add a :fields map to our app-db, write two subscriptions for accessing it: :form fields and form field, and write two events for modifying it: :form set-field and :form clear-fields.  guestbook-re-frame-1 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-db :form set-field [ rf path :form fields ]  fn [fields [_ id value]]   assoc fields id value      rf reg-event-db :form clear-fields  report erratum     discuss   Embracing Re-Frame   133  [ rf path :form fields ]  fn [_ _]  {}     rf reg-sub :form fields  fn [db _]   :form fields db      rf reg-sub :form field :<- [:form fields]  fn [fields [_ id]]  get fields id     Take a look at our reg-sub for :form field. This is an example of a derived subscrip- tion with one input, [:form fields]. It looks the same as the subscriptions we’ve written before, except for the :<- line. This line declares the subscription we are deriving from.  Also, look at how we registered our :form set-field event handler. There’s a vector between the event-id and the handler function. This is our interceptor vector and it contains one interceptor, path. Interceptors are similar to ring’s middle- ware. They allow us to transform the inputs and outputs of our event handlers. For example, the path interceptor makes it seem like the value at our path, in this case [:form fields], is the entire db. We’ll cover interceptors in more detail in Events and Effects in Re-Frame, on page 151.  Next, let’s re-think errors a bit. We have two types of errors so far: validation errors which we compute on the client, and server errors we get in our AJAX response. When using re-frame, we should look for opportunities to refactor imperative state changes into values derived from data. Validation is a simple computation on our fields map, so validation errors are a perfect candidate for a derived subscription. But, validation errors aren’t the whole picture. We also have server errors which must be imperative, since our server doesn’t support our reactive style.  Let’s register our error events and subscriptions with this in mind:  guestbook-re-frame-1 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-db :form set-server-errors [ rf path :form server-errors ]  fn [_ [_ errors]]  errors    rf reg-sub :form server-errors  fn [db _]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   134   :form server-errors db     ;;Validation errors are reactively computed  rf reg-sub :form validation-errors :<- [:form fields]  fn [fields _]   validate-message fields      rf reg-sub :form validation-errors? :<- [:form validation-errors]  fn [errors _]   not  empty? errors       rf reg-sub :form errors :<- [:form validation-errors] :<- [:form server-errors]  fn [[validation server] _]   merge validation server      rf reg-sub :form error :<- [:form errors]  fn [errors [_ id]]  get errors id     We have two data sources for errors: :form server-errors and :form validation-errors. One is managed by the :form set-server-errors event, and the other is derived from our :form fields subscription. The :form errors subscription is a derived subscription that combines all types of errors and presents them as a single map. This means the message-form component doesn’t have to worry about our different types of errors. We can change how we gather our errors as we please without needing to touch our UI. We’ve also added a boolean subscription :form validation- errors? that checks if there are any validation errors, we’ll see how this helps us soon.  Now let’s change our send-message! function into an event. As we said earlier, we’re  just  doing  this  to  get  our  data  into  re-frame.  There  are  a  few  things wrong with this version, but we’ll come back and fix them later.  guestbook-re-frame-1 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :message send!  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ fields]]   POST " api message" {:format :json :headers {"Accept" "application transit+json" "x-csrf-token"  .-value  .getElementById js document "token"  }  report erratum     discuss   Embracing Re-Frame   135  :params fields :handler  rf dispatch  [:message add  -> fields  :error-handler  rf dispatch   assoc :timestamp  js Date.   ]   [:form set-server-errors  get-in % [:response :errors] ] }   {:db  dissoc db :form server-errors }    Our event-handler isn’t all that different from our initial function, but at least it shows up in re-frame-10x. Note that we’re passing the fields in as a parameter rather  than  looking  it  up  from  the  database  since  it  is  more  flexible.  This could allow us to post messages different ways in the future.  Finally, let’s hook up our events and subscriptions to our form component.  guestbook-re-frame-1 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn errors-component [id]   when-let [error @ rf subscribe [:form error id] ]  [:div.notification.is-danger  string join error ]     defn message-form []  [:div [errors-component :server-error] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"] [errors-component :name] [:input.input {:type :text :name :name :on-change  rf dispatch  [:form set-field :name  .. % -target -value ]   :value @ rf subscribe [:form field :name] }]]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"] [errors-component :message] [:textarea.textarea {:name :message :value @ rf subscribe [:form field :message]  :on-change  rf dispatch  [:form set-field :message  .. % -target -value ] }]]  [:input.button.is-primary {:type :submit :disabled @ rf subscribe [:form validation-errors?]  :on-click  rf dispatch [:message send!  @ rf subscribe [:form fields] ]   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   136  :value "comment"}]]   Now  that  all  of  our  state  is  external,  this  component  is  much  simpler.  We don’t have to worry about shuffling around local atoms, and we could easily update this component to take actions and subscriptions as parameters to make it more reusable. Our actions are labeled semantically, and all of our querying logic is computed ahead of time and attached to a meaningful label. All our component has to do is render those pre-made pieces in a meaningful way.  Initializing our Re-Frame Application  Now that we have our form logic in re-frame, let’s take a quick look at our init! function.  It has to take care of bootstrapping our application, but we should make sure that  actions  involving  data  are  handled  inside  the :app initialize  event  rather than  the  init!  function.  We’re  currently  calling  get-messages  directly,  so  let’s convert it into an event, :messages load and use the :dispatch effect to trigger it from :app initialize.  guestbook-re-frame-1 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :app initialize  fn [_ _]  {:db {:messages loading? true} :dispatch [:messages load]}     rf reg-event-fx :messages load  fn [{:keys [db]} _]   GET " api messages"  {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"} :handler  rf dispatch [:messages set  :messages % ] }   {:db  assoc db :messages loading? true }    Let’s see what’s changed. In the browser, refresh the app and take a look at the re-frame-10x dashboard to see the events that occur on start.  It starts with [:app initialize]. We can see in the Effects section that it is setting our db and is dispatching [:messages load].  report erratum     discuss   Embracing Re-Frame   137  If we look at [:message load] we see that it is setting our db but we can’t quite see what else it’s doing. Then, from the function called in our handler, some time later [:messages set ...] is called.  Reloading Messages  Our event handlers may not be pure yet, but the reactive model already gives us  a  lot  of  power.  Now  that  we  have  an  independent :messages load  event,  it should be easy enough to add a reload button. We’ll add a button that dis- patches :messages load when clicked, and we’ll disable it and change the text if :messages loading? is true.  guestbook-websockets src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn reload-messages-button []   let [loading?  rf subscribe [:messages loading?] ]  [:button.button.is-info.is-fullwidth {:on-click  rf dispatch [:messages load]  :disabled @loading?}  if @loading?  "Loading Messages" "Refresh Messages" ]     defn home []   fn []   let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Messages"] [message-list messages]] [:div.columns>div.column [reload-messages-button]] [:div.columns>div.column [message-form]]]     Let’s take a look in the browser to see what’s changed.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   138  It’s not terribly interesting with just one session, since we get our own mes- sages immediately. Let’s open a second browser window and post a message:  As you can see, only the user that posted the message can see it in the list. Now let’s try out our reload button in the other window:  Aha! Now we have the message being shared between users. We’re reusing part of our application initialization logic to refresh only some parts of our app. This is better than refreshing the page, but not by much. Unfortunately, there is no way for our users to know when they need to refresh and they still need to trigger the refresh themselves.  Let’s take a look fixing this.  Multi-User With Websockets  Instead of just having a refresh messages button, let’s add a push notification for new messages using WebSockets.  report erratum     discuss   Multi-User With Websockets   139  Now let’s take a look at using WebSockets for client-server communication. In the traditional Ajax approach, the client first sends a message to the server and  then  handles  the  reply  using  an  asynchronous  callback.  WebSockets allow the web server to initiate the message exchange with the client.  Currently, our guestbook application does not provide a way to display mes- sages generated by other users without reloading the page. If we wanted to solve this problem using Ajax, our only option would be to poll the server and check if any new messages are available since the last poll. This is inefficient since the clients end up continuously polling the server regardless of whether any new messages are actually available.  Instead, we’ll have the clients open a WebSocket connection when the page loads,  and  then  the  server  will  notify  all  the  active  clients  any  time  a  new message  is  created.  This  way  the  clients  are  notified  in  real  time  and  the messages are only sent as needed.  Configuring the Server  WebSockets require support on both the server and the client side. While the browser API is standard, each server provides its own way of handling Web- Socket connections. In this section we’ll take a look at using the API for the HTTP Kit web server that Luminus defaults to.  Let’s start by updating the server-side code in the project to provide a Web- Socket  connection.  Once  the  server  is  updated  we’ll  look  at  the  updates required for the client.  The first thing we’ll add is a new namespace for our WebSocket connection handler.  Let’s  call  it guestbook.routes.websockets  and  add  the  following  require- ments:  guestbook-websockets src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  ns guestbook.routes.websockets   :require [clojure.tools.logging :as log]  [org.httpkit.server :as http-kit] [clojure.edn :as edn] [guestbook.messages :as msg]    We’ll need org.httpkit.server for managing our WebSocket connections. While we figure out the basics of websockets, we’ll just use pr-str and edn read- string to serialize and de-serialize our data.  If we want to communicate to clients, the first thing we’ll need to do is keep track of our connections. Let’s create an atom containing our open connec- tions, and write connect! and disconnect! functions to manage it.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5.

[channel]   log info "Channel opened"   swap! channels conj channel     defn disconnect! [channel status]   log info "Channel closed: " status   swap! channels disj channel    To keep it simple, let’s assume our WebSocket will only recieve save-message! messages.  Let’s  copy  our  logic  from guestbook.routes.services  but  replace  HTTP responses with maps, and add serialization and de-serialization where neces- sary.  guestbook-websockets src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defn handle-message! [channel ws-message]   let [message  edn read-string ws-message   response  try   msg save-message! message   assoc message :timestamp  java.util.Date.    catch Exception e   let [{id  :guestbook error-id  errors :errors}  ex-data e ]   case id  :validation {:errors errors} ;;else {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to save message!"]}}    ]   if  :errors response    http-kit send! channel  pr-str response    doseq [channel @channels]   http-kit send! channel  pr-str response        Finally, we need to write a connection handler:  guestbook-websockets src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defn handler [request]   http-kit with-channel request channel   connect! channel   http-kit on-close channel  partial disconnect! channel    http-kit on-receive channel  partial handle-message! channel       defn websocket-routes []  [" ws" {:get handler}]   and reference it from guestbook.handler, exposing a route in our app for accepting connections:  report erratum     discuss   Multi-User With Websockets   141   ns guestbook.handler   :require ;;...

Now, let’s connect from the client.  Connecting from ClojureScript To  connect  on  the  client  side,  we’ll  use  js WebSocket  to  create  a  WebSocket connection object, which we’ll use to communicate.  guestbook-websockets src cljs guestbook websockets.cljs  ns guestbook.websockets   :require [cljs.reader :as edn]     defonce channel  atom nil    defn connect!

The only things we need to do are: update our :message send event to use our WebSocket, add a handle-response! function that will deal with responses, and call ws connect! from our init! function.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5.

Let’s respond to our earlier message via web- sockets.  It automatically loads! Since re-frame is event driven, using websockets is actually a lot simpler! We just dispatch our events from our websocket message handler instead of from our reagent components. If we look at re-frame-10x’s history in the left browser, we can see that [:message add ...] was indeed triggered even though we didn’t submit anything.  From here, we could do a lot to improve our re-frame app, but let’s swap out our from-scratch websocket implementation for a much richer one - Sente.  report erratum     discuss   Upgrading to Sente   143  Upgrading to Sente  Now that we’ve done a scratch implementation of WebSockets, let’s look at a popular Clojure Script  WebSockets library: Sente.15  Sente is a little more complicated than our toy implementation, but it brings a lot of great features in exchange.

Setting Up for Success   144  We’ll  initialize  Sente  by  calling  the  sente make-channel-socket!  function.  This function accepts the server adapter and a map of initialization options. We pass in the HTTP Kit server adapter, since that’s the server we’re using, and we set the :user-id-fn option to use the :client-id key in the request parameters. The reason we have to specify our :user-id-fn is that sente defaults to using the :uid key from the session. Since we aren’t creating ring sessions for our clients, we’ll need to use something else. The :client-id is a uuid that’s automatically generated for each sente client so it’s a perfect fit for us.  guestbook-sente-setup src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defstate socket  :start  sente make-channel-socket!   get-sch-adapter  {:user-id-fn  fn [ring-req]   defn send!

In our first implementation, we sent our guestbook message as a map of fields with no metadata. This restricted us to only one type of message. We should change  this  so  that  we  can  accept  multiple  message  types.  We  also  must change this because Sente will call our handler function whenever an event occurs, passing it a map with a bunch of metadata describing the event.  Let’s do this with a multimethod:  report erratum     discuss   Upgrading to Sente   145  guestbook-sente-setup src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defmulti handle-message  fn [{:keys [id]}]  id     defmethod handle-message :default  [{:keys [id]}]  log debug "Received unrecognized websocket event type: " id     defmethod handle-message :message create!

Now that we’ve got the meat of it set up, let’s update how it connects to the rest of our application.  guestbook-sente-setup src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defstate channel-router  :start  sente start-chsk-router!  :stop  when-let [stop-fn channel-router]   :ch-recv socket  'receive-message!    stop-fn      defn websocket-routes []  [" ws" {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf  middleware wrap-formats]  :get  :ajax-get-or-ws-handshake-fn socket  :post  :ajax-post-fn socket }]   In  addition  to  managing  our  socket,  sente  provides  a  helper  for  creating  a message router that will pass incoming messages to our handler function. Since our router depends on the initialization of our socket, we have to define it as a defstate so that mount knows to start our socket first before starting our router. Once we have our router initialized, the last step is to connect the socket to our webserver. Unlike our from-scratch implementation Sente works well with ring middlewares, so we’ll use wrap-csrf and wrap-formats. It also has both :get and :post handler functions so that the client can use AJAX if it doesn’t support WebSockets.  Upgrading the Client  Now that we’ve changed our server to use sente, we need to update the client as well. Our client websocket connection will look very similar to our server,  report erratum     discuss   Upgrading to Sente   147  with a few key differences. We’ll use mount on the client as well, so we won’t have to manually connect in our init! function. We’ll have two defstate definitions: our socket and our router. We’ll have a receive-message! function wrapping a handle-message multimethod. And we’ll have a send! function for sending messages over our socket.  Let’s start by updating our namespace declaration and creating our socket and send! function:  guestbook-sente-setup src cljs guestbook websockets.cljs  ns guestbook.websockets   :require-macros [mount.core :refer [defstate]]   :require [re-frame.core :as rf]  [taoensso.sente :as sente] mount.core     defstate socket  :start  sente make-channel-socket!  " ws"  .-value  .getElementById js document "token"   {:type :auto :wrap-recv-evs? false}     defn send! [message]   if-let [send-fn  :send-fn @socket ]   send-fn message   throw  ex-info "Couldn't send message, channel isn't open!"  {:message message}      Our call to make-channel-socket! looks a bit different. As the first argument, the webserver  adapter  is  replaced  by  a  URL.  The  second  argument,  our  CSRF token, is new. Since we’re in the browser now, we need to send our CSRF token to ensure that our connection is secure. The last argument is an options map like we had on the server, but it has a different set of options available. The only ones we’re passing for now are :type and wrap-recv-evs?. The :type option determines whether we’ll use WebSockets or AJAX as the underlying connec- tion method. We’ll choose :auto to let Sente use whichever method it prefers. The wrap-recv-evs? option specifies whether we want to receive all application messages wrapped in an outer :chsk recv event. We’ll turn this off by passing false so that our client events are structured like our server events. Our send! function looks similar to the server, but not quite the same. We’re de-referencing our socket before using its :send-fn. This is a minor detail of how mount works when targeting JavaScript rather than Java. This isn’t for any interesting reason, so we’ll just have to remember that we need to de-reference any mount states before using them in cljs.  report erratum     discuss   Now that we have our socket set up, let’s write our handle-message and receive- message! functions and connect them to a channel-router.

The :chsk handshake and :chsk state events are related to the status of our connection. While they’re important for notifying users about lost or spotty connections, we’ll just log them in the console for now.  Now  that  we’ve  sorted  out  our  guestbook.websockets  namespace,  let’s  update guestbook.core to use it correctly so that we can get back to coding interactively.  guestbook-sente-setup src cljs guestbook core.cljs  ns guestbook.core   :require ;;... [mount.core :as mount]    ;;...  rf reg-event-fx :message send!  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ fields]]   ws send! [:message create! fields]  {:db  dissoc db :form server-errors }    ;;...  defn init! []   .log js console "Initializing App..."   mount start   rf dispatch [:app initialize]   mount-components    We required mount.core, called mount start from our init! function, and changed the value we sent from ws send! in our :message send! event. We finally have our app functionally migrated from our from-scratch websockets implementation over to Sente. Since we required a new library, we’ll need to restart our app to  load  the  new  dependency.  Once  that’s  done,  let’s  try  it  out  a  bit.  You might’ve noticed that our fields don’t clear when we submit our form. That was intentionally left out because it is well suited to the callback feature of Sente.  Leveraging Sente Callbacks  Sente is primarily a WebSockets library, but it allows you to get the best of both  the  AJAX  and  WebSocket  workflows.  Generally  speaking,  having  the server  push  the  results  of  an  action  to  all  concerned  parties  is  incredibly powerful as it separates the concerns of keeping state synchronized from the logistics of client-server communication. However, this starts to break down when  we  want  information  about  our  actions.  In  this  case,  the request response model of AJAX is a better fit. Sente allows you to mix the two by specifying a callback function when you send a message from a client.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   150  We have two behaviours that are related to the state of our actions: clearing fields after a message is successfully sent, and displaying server errors after a  message  is  rejected.  Let’s  update  our  code  to  use  a  reply  function  to accomplish these tasks.  First, we need to allow our client-side send! function to take multiple argu- ments:  guestbook-sente-cb src cljs guestbook websockets.cljs  defn send! [& args]   if-let [send-fn  :send-fn @socket ]   apply send-fn args   throw  ex-info "Couldn't send message, channel isn't open!"  {:message  first args }      Next, we need require [guestbook.websockets :as ws]  and pass our timeout and our callback function from :message send!:  guestbook-sente-cb src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :message send!  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ fields]]   ws send! [:message create! fields] 10000  fn [{:keys [success errors] :as response}]   .log js console "Called Back: "  pr-str response    if success   rf dispatch [:form clear-fields]   rf dispatch [:form set-server-errors errors]      {:db  dissoc db :form server-errors }    Finally, we need to update our server to invoke the :?reply-fn on the message:  guestbook-sente-cb src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defmulti handle-message  fn [{:keys [id]}]  id     defmethod handle-message :default  [{:keys [id]}]  log debug "Received unrecognized websocket event type: " id  {:error  str "Unrecognized websocket event type: "  pr-str id   :id  id}    defmethod handle-message :message create!  [{:keys [?data uid] :as message}]  let [response  try   msg save-message! ?data   assoc ?data :timestamp  java.util.Date.    catch Exception e   let [{id  :guestbook error-id  errors :errors}  ex-data e ]  report erratum     discuss   Events and Effects in Re-Frame   151   case id  :validation {:errors errors} ;;else {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to save message!"]}}    ]   if  :errors response    do   do   log debug "Failed to save message: " ?data  response    doseq [uid  :any @ :connected-uids socket  ]   send! uid [:message add response]    {:success true}       defn receive-message! [{:keys [id ?reply-fn]  message}]  log debug "Got message with id: " id   let [reply-fn  or ?reply-fn  fn [_]  ]  :as   when-some [response  handle-message message ]   reply-fn response      There we go, that’s much better. Our handle-message multimethod now returns a  map  that  gets  passed  to  the  connection’s  reply-fn  by  receive-message!  if  it exists.  Not  only  does  this  change  handle  the  clearing  of  our  fields,  but  it handles a bug we might’ve encountered later. We were sending the message errors to the :uid of the sender, which is correct as long as a :uid is exactly one connected client. This is currently the case, but when we add user accounts it won’t be. A connection’s :uid will correspond to all connections belonging to that  user.  This  means  that  if  a  user  were  to  submit  a  message  from  their desktop, errors would display in every one of their active connections  e.g. their phone, their five other browser tabs… . It would’ve been even worse if we’d implemented clearing fields on success in the same way, users could lose long drafted messages in other windows on other devices! Luckily, using the :?reply-fn an easy and elegant way to handle client specific concerns.  Events and Effects in Re-Frame  Now that we have our WebSockets layer all set up, let’s get the rest of our re- frame stuff in order. Earlier we accomplished the goal of making our applica- tion’s view a computation of our app-db. Now, we want to go a step further and make sure that we properly separate events from effects.  Until  now,  we’ve  been  writing  event  handlers  by  using  re-frame’s  built  in effects  e.g. :db, :dispatch…  and calling effectful functions where built in effects fall short. We’ve gotten pretty far with this approach, but we need to improve  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   152  this sooner or later. As we discussed earlier, re-frame’s distinction between events and effects is crucial.  The Value of Isolating Effects  Our ultimate goal in using re-frame is to express any necessary complexity as pure functions, and to make any necessary impurity as simple as possible. With our view, we separated the impure and fiddly rendering behaviour from any  and  all  application  logic.  We  connected  the  two  minimally,  they  only interact via dispatch and subscribe.  Actions are a bit trickier, but the goal is the same. We want to separate any impure and fiddly effects, such as AJAX, from our pure application logic  i.e. our events . This allows us to inspect, wrap, and test our logic easily, since it’ll just be a translation from a dispatched event vector to an event map. All our events should do is transform data.  Since we still need to do impure things  i.e. actually send AJAX requests , we should make sure to keep the implementation as straightforward as possible. Just like our UI components, we want our effect handlers to be easy to read and understand despite their impurity.  Effect Handlers  In order for us to purify our events, we’ll have to write some effect handlers. Let’s start with an effect called :ws send! that sends a WebSocket message, and handles the callback for us.  Let’s add the following to our guestbook.websockets namespace:  guestbook-re-frame-2 src cljs guestbook websockets.cljs  defn send! [& args]   if-let [send-fn  :send-fn @socket ]   apply send-fn args   throw  ex-info "Couldn't send message, channel isn't open!"  {:message  first args }       rf reg-fx :ws send!  fn [{:keys [message timeout callback-event]  :or {timeout 30000}}]   if callback-event   send! message timeout  rf dispatch  conj callback-event %     send! message      Then, let’s update our event handlers in guestbook.core:  guestbook-re-frame-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-fx  report erratum     discuss   Events and Effects in Re-Frame   153  :message send!-called-back  fn [_ [_ {:keys [success errors]}]]   if success  {:dispatch [:form clear-fields]} {:dispatch [:form set-server-errors errors]}      rf reg-event-fx :message send!  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ fields]]  {:db  dissoc db :form server-errors  :ws send! {:message [:message create! fields]  :timeout 10000 :callback-event [:message send!-called-back]}}    Now, instead of calling a function inside of our event handler, we simply add the :ws send! key to our returned map. Let’s try it out in the browser.  Great! We can now see our effect in the fx tab. This is nice, but we get much more than this. Since our effect is data, we can transform it with interceptors. Also, since effect handling is registered from event handling, we can change the way effects are handled across all of our events.  We’ve also changed our API a bit. The :ws send! effect takes a callback event instead of a callback function. This restricts what can be done on reply, but it means that we can see exactly what will be dispatched.  Now  that  we’ve  got  our :message send!  purified,  let’s  move  onto :messages load. We’ll need to write a separate effect to handle HTTP requests. There are some implementations available as libraries, such as re-frame-http-fx,16 but let’s write a spartan GET effect on our own:  guestbook-re-frame-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-fx :ajax get  fn [{:keys [url success-event error-event success-path]}]   GET url   cond-> {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"}}  success-event  assoc :handler   rf dispatch   conj success-event   if success-path  16. https:  github.com Day8 re-frame-http-fx  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   154  error-event   get-in % success-path  %      assoc :error-handler  rf dispatch   conj error-event %          rf reg-event-fx :messages load  fn [{:keys [db]} _]  {:db  assoc db :messages loading? true  :ajax get {:url " api messages"  :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}    This is fairly similar to our :ws send! effect. We have a URL instead of a message, and  we  have  two  types  of  callback  event: :success-event  and :error-event.  We’ve also added a small convenience in :success-path. It allows us to specify a path in the response we’d like to pass to our :success-event rather than just passing the  whole  thing.  This  means  we  can  keep  using :messages set  as  our  event, instead of adding an intermediate event to process our response.  The separation we’ve introduced is nice, but we won’t feel the benefits too much at this scale. This approach to managing actions will really start to pay off once our application grows, and adopting it this early is much easier than switching over later.  Using Reagent Atoms to Reduce Event Noise Now that our events are pure, let’s come back to our earlier :on-change dispatch. As we’ve been using re-frame-10x, you’ve probably noticed that as soon as we start typing our event history gets blown up unnecessarily. This is because our input is directly connected to our re-frame DB. This is okay with compo- nents like checkboxes or dropdowns since :on-change happens once per user change. However, text inputs call :on-change every time a character is entered. There’s a way to mitigate this using a local atom and a reagent track. A reagent track is pretty much like a re-frame derived subscription, but it works with any de-reffables, not just subscriptions. Let’s start with our text input.  guestbook-re-frame-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn text-input [{val  :value attrs :attrs :keys [on-save]}]   let [draft  r atom nil   value  r track  or @draft @val ""  ]   fn []  [:input.input  merge attrs  report erratum     discuss   Events and Effects in Re-Frame   155  {:type :text :on-focus  reset! draft  or @val ""   :on-blur  fn []   on-save  or @draft ""    reset! draft nil    :on-change  reset! draft  .. % -target -value   :value @value} ]     ;;...   defn message-form []  [:div ;;... [text-input {:attrs {:name :name}  ;;... ]   :value  rf subscribe [:form field :name]  :on-save  rf dispatch [:form set-field :name %] }]  We have a draft atom that contains nil until we focus it. value is a track that is either the draft, or the value from our re-frame subscription. Finally, when we un-focus our component, the draft is ‘saved’ by the on-save function.  Let’s see it in action.  As we edit the field, we can see that no events have been dispatched in our re-frame-10x panel. But, when we unfocus the field, we see a single [:form set- field] event fire. Since we only ‘save’ when we blur our input, it only happens once.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 5. Setting Up for Success   156  Next, let’s create a textarea version:  guestbook-re-frame-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn textarea-input [{val :value attrs :attrs :keys [on-save]}]   let [draft  r atom nil   value  r track  or @draft @val ""  ]   fn []  [:textarea.textarea  merge attrs  {:on-focus  reset! draft  or @val ""   :on-blur  fn []   on-save  or @draft ""    reset! draft nil    :on-change  reset! draft  .. % -target -value   :value @value} ]     ;;...   defn message-form []  [:div ;;... [textarea-input {:attrs {:name :message} :value  rf subscribe [:form field :message]  :on-save  rf dispatch [:form set-field :message %] }]  ;;... ]   This is the same as the text input, but it has some parts changed.  What You’ve Learned  We’ve got our project set up nicely now, and it’ll pay dividends. Having your Service API and front-end easily inspectable and testable will make you more  report erratum     discuss   What You’ve Learned   157  efficient, and improve your understanding. We also haven’t sacrificed anything because  we’ve  been  careful  about  keeping  it  separate  from  our  production profile.  We’ve also learned quite a bit about separating our application into layers. By modeling our application as a series of layers with data flowing through them, we can reason about them independently and enhance them easily. We  took  advantage  of  this  by  swapping  out  some  AJAX  requests  for  live WebSocket connections.  We  now  have  all  the  tools  we  need  to  build  a  robust  Clojure Script   web application. In the next chapter we’ll draft a plan for upgrading our guestbook application into our very own micro-blogging application.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 6  Planning Our Application  We’ve got a good foundation for our application, now let’s decide what our final application will be.  For the remainder of this book, we’ll take our guestbook application and grow it into our very own micro-blogging platform. We’ll add accounts, feeds, likes, tags, media, and all of the things you’d expect from a modern social media platform.  This is a lot to do, so we need to plan how to tackle this bit by bit. Let’s start by brainstorming features that we might want, then we’ll trim them down to core functionality so we have a place to start.  What’s in our MVP?  Since  we’re  building  a  micro-blogging  platform,  we  have  some  obvious requirements. We’ll have multiple users, each having an account. These users will create content and engage with other users’ content. Engagement could take  multiple  forms,  such  as  liking,  sharing,  or  commenting  on  posts,  or tagging users.  The core architecture of any social media platform is going to take the same shape.  Before  a  user  does  anything,  they  have  to  have  an  account.  Once registered, users create content that is consumed and shared by others across the network.  Regardless  of  the  direction  our  application  takes,  we’ll  need  to  implement these core features.  Core Features  Let’s break down the core of a social media platform into five categories.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   160  Users should be able to register, log in, and perform permitted actions.  Account Management  Content Creation  Passive Consumption  Sharing and Discovery  Personalization  Users should be able to compose posts and replies.  Users should be able to view a global and a personal feed.  Users should be able to share, tag, and search posts.  Users should be able to change their display name, profile picture, and other attributes.  Most  features  we  add  will  belong  to  one  or  more  of  these  categories.  Let’s make sure that we have a strong foundation for each so that we can safely build upon it.  Account Management  Until now, our application used a simplistic approach to account management. All we have are author names, supplied by users for each message. To provide the features we want, we need a more robust approach towards accounts. Moreover, this component is absolutely necessary before anyone can mean- ingfully engage with our app.  Accounts have several vital purposes, especially access control and ownership. Since  these  both  apply  to  most  aspects  of  our  application,  we  need  to  be especially thoughtful as we implement this functionality.  Our first concern is security. We want to ensure that we safeguard sensitive data,  such  as  personal  information.  We  also  want  to  restrict  access  in  a standard and uniform way so that it’s hard to mess up.  Our  second  concern  is  identity.  Any  data  generated  by  a  user  has  to  be associated with their identity. This includes post authorship, account prefer- ences, and so on.  Both of these are far reaching, and will see many changes as our application grows. We’ll need to keep this in mind as we flesh out our other features.  First and foremost, we need to separate users from messages. We’ll do this by  creating  a  separate  users  table,  and  replacing  the author  column  with  a reference to a user.  report erratum     discuss   What’s in our MVP?   161  Next,  we’ll  need  to  allow  users  to  create  and  manage  their  accounts.  This means adding login, registration, and profile pages.  Finally,  we’ll  need  to  restrict  page  access  to  authenticated  and  authorized users.  To  accomplish  this,  we’ll  add  middleware  to  manage  access  to restricted routes.  Content Creation  This is how applications become relevant. Without content, a social media platform is nothing.  Our current content creation options are very limited. Users can only post messages, and there isn’t even a concept of a user account.  At a minimum, we need to associate each post with its author. This allows us to do many things. We can allow authors to edit or delete their posts. We can view posts by author. Authors can track engagement with their posts.  We also want posts to be more interesting to create. This could include media embedding and custom formatting. To do this, we’ll switch from plain text posts to markdown. We can gradually implement parts of markdown’s spec as we add new features.  The core purpose of social media is user interaction. All we have so far is a single shared timeline. To support rich user interactions, we’ll add the ability to reply to posts.  Passive Consumption  Passive consumption starts on the home page. This is where users will see their feed if authenticated, or the global feed if not. This is the face of our application,  and  this  is  where  most  users  will  spend  most  of  their  time.  It should be pleasant to use, and serve as a gateway to the rest of our applica- tion.  To this end, we’ll be spending a great deal of our front-end work on this sec- tion, so it better be flexible and easy to work with.  A large part of usability is giving users quick access to the content they want to see. Content curation is an interesting UX problem, we want to streamline the process without restricting users too much. One obvious way of grouping posts is by user, but as our app evolves we’ll want to add new ways to catego- rize and consume content.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   162  Sharing and Discovery  Once we have users on the platform, we want to enable them to grow and refine their network. We’ll do so by allowing users to  ‘re-post’ content they like, thereby sharing it with their followers. We’ll also have tags and shared timelines so that users can actively seek out content. Also, we want to ensure that we take full advantage of the rest of the blogosphere; it should be easy to share and embed posts from our platform elsewhere.  The  possibilities  are  endless,  but  we’ll  start  with  re-posts  because  it’s  the simplest form of sharing.  Personalization  We also want to allow users to personalize their experience. This may include: Setting a profile picture, UI theme, and so on.  This  could  apply  to  many  different  parts  of  our  application,  so  we  should consider it upfront. We’ll start with a profile picture and display name, along with a profile settings page to change them. As we add personalization fea- tures, we’ll enhance our profile settings page accordingly.  The Elephant in the Room  Upon reviewing our core features, some core concerns jump out.  We  need  a  great  deal  of  flexibility  in  many  parts  of  our  app,  such  as  user profiles and posts. Additionally, we need a way of working with some complex relationships, such as posts written by or re-posted by users that are followed.  Our  next  objective  is  to  design  our  application’s  data  model,  but  first  we should address these concerns. The key shortfall of our current implementa- tion is h2. It has served us well so far, but it’s missing some key features we want. The most notable one being PostgreSQL’s JSONB type.  Before we get started, you’ll need running PostgreSQL instance. Take a look at Appendix 4, Database Access, on page 393 first if you need to set one up.  Let’s start by creating a role and a database for guestbook. Connect to the psql shell, and do the following:  CREATE USER guestbook WITH PASSWORD 'password'; CREATE DATABASE guestbook WITH OWNER guestbook;  Then let’s change our application config to contain our new database url:  guestbook-postgres dev-config.edn {:dev true :port 3000  report erratum     discuss   The Elephant in the Room   163  :nrepl-port 7000 :database-url "postgresql:  localhost:5432 guestbook?user=guestbook&password=password"}  and add the postgresql driver dependency to our project.clj:  guestbook-postgres project.clj [org.postgresql postgresql "42.2.18"]  Next, let’s restart our app and rewrite our migrations for Postgres. Let’s start up our application’s REPL and generate some new migration files. Since we’re going to have multiple tables, let’s rename our guestbook table to posts.  user>  create-migration "create-posts-table"  nil user>  Now, let’s write our migrations based on our old ones.  guestbook-postgres resources migrations 20190916013321-create-posts-table.up.sql CREATE TABLE posts  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name text not null, message text not null, timestamp TIMESTAMP not null DEFAULT now   ;  guestbook-postgres resources migrations 20190916013321-create-posts-table.down.sql DROP TABLE posts;  Looks pretty similar, but there are a couple syntactic differences. We used the serial type for our primary key instead of integer ... AUTO_INCREMENT, and we used now   instead of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP. These mean the same thing, but are just syntactic differences between H2 and Postgres. We also added some not null  constraints  to  our  columns  because  they  are  nice  to  have.  We’ll  make some  further  adjustments  as  our  data  model  becomes  more  concrete,  but we’ll stay as close as we can to our H2 version for now.  Then, make sure to delete the old migration files; they’re redundant and won’t work with postgres.  Now, we just have to change our table name in our queries.sql file:  guestbook-postgres resources sql queries.sql -- :name save-message! :! :n -- :doc creates a new message using the name and message keys INSERT INTO posts  name, message  VALUES  :name, :message  -- :name get-messages :? :* -- :doc selects all available messages  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   164  SELECT * from posts  That  should  be  all.  Let’s  start  up  our  application  from  the  REPL,  run  our migrations, reload our queries, and make sure they work:  user>  start  {:started [...]} user>  migrate  ... nil user>  in-ns 'guestbook.db.core  namespace[guestbook.db.core] guestbook.db.core>  conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"  {...} guestbook.db.core>  save-message! {:name "Postgres"  :message "An elephant never forgets."}   1 guestbook.db.core>  get-messages   {:id 1,  :name "Postgres", :message "An elephant never forgets.", :timestamp inst "..."}   guestbook.db.core>  Everything is working as expected. Congratulations! you successfully switched to Postgres.  As a final optional step, let’s look at how we can get the data from our H2 instance into Postgres. Since we removed our H2 URL from our config and changed our queries, we’ll have to manually use next.jdbc. We can specify a custom connection by calling next.jdbc get-datasource and passing is a connection specification map. We’ll call next.jdbc.sql query with our H2 connection to get all of our messages, then we’ll call next.jdbc.sql insert-multi! with our Postgres connec- tion to place them in the posts table.  guestbook.db.core>  require '[next.jdbc :as jdbc]  '[next.jdbc.sql :as sql] '[next.jdbc.result-set :as rs]   nil guestbook.db.core>  ->>   sql query   jdbc with-options   jdbc get-datasource  {:jdbcUrl "jdbc:h2:. guestbook_dev.db"}  {:builder-fn rs as-unqualified-lower-maps}   ["select name, message, timestamp from guestbook"]    mapv  juxt :name :message :timestamp    sql insert-multi! *db* :posts [:name :message :timestamp]     {:id 2,  report erratum     discuss   Data Modelling   165  :name "Alice", :message "Hello, Bob!", :timestamp inst "..."} {:id 3, :name "Bob", :message "Oh! Hi, Alice!", :timestamp inst "..."}   guestbook.db.core>  Note that we didn’t select the id column from guestbook, since that would conflict with the message we added earlier. We don’t need the message ids to stay the same, so we’ll let postgres generate new ones.  Now that we’re completely done with H2 we can remove our H2 driver depen- dency:  guestbook-postgres project.clj [com.h2database h2 "1.4.200"]  That’s it! We’re fully migrated to Postgres now. We haven’t covered it’s features yet, but we’ll discuss them as we need them. Now that we have a full-featured database, let’s build out our data model.  Data Modelling  Now that we have a database that properly supports our desired features, let’s create a data model that supports the commonalities and that can be extended to support all of them.  As we discussed in Account Management, on page 160 account management impacts many parts of our app and should be tackled first. We’ll have a users table, which will be referenced by posts, and by other users in multiple ways. Let’s think about which columns are essential, and which columns we might add later.  We’ll definitely need login and password columns, and we’ll want a created_at col- umn for auditing and metadata.  In  the  future,  we’ll  probably  want  to  add  a  bunch  of  user  data,  such  as username, avatar, last login, and so on, but we’ll address those later.  Let’s create a migration for our users table with login, password, and created_at.  guestbook.db.core>  in-ns 'user  namespace[user] user>  create-migration "add-users-table"  nil user>  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   166  guestbook-postgres-2 resources migrations 20190919232336-add-users-table.up.sql CREATE TABLE users  login text PRIMARY KEY, password text not null, created_at TIMESTAMP not null DEFAULT now   ;  guestbook-postgres-2 resources migrations 20190919232336-add-users-table.down.sql DROP TABLE users;  That’s all the migrations we’ll write for now, but let’s take a moment to think through how our data model will evolve as we grow our application.  First, let’s take a look at posts. We’ll eventually replace the name column with a reference to a user in the users table, add an optional parent post to facilitate replies, and update message to use richer encoding to support additional fea- tures, such as embedded media.  Then, let’s think through users. We’ll want to add a username or display-name, we’ll want to add an avatar, we’ll want a user profile, and we’ll want to store preferences.  Finally, we’ll have a number of rich relationships between our entities. We’ll want relationships between users such as follows and blocks. And we’ll want relationships beteen users and posts such as stars and boosts.  Adding User Management  Before we can move forward, we need to address the user management aspect of our application. We’ll start by implementing the service endpoints for user registration and authentication. From there, we’ll build the corresponding UI components.  Service Endpoints  Let’s start by running the migration we wrote in Data Modelling, on page 165 if you haven’t done so already:  user>  migrate  ... INFO ... ... INFO nil user>  migratus.core - Starting migrations  migratus.core - Ending migrations  Now, let’s update our queries.sql to create and look up users. Note, we’ll need to hash and salt our password before we pass it to our insert statement, so we’ll add an asterisk to the end of the name to denote that we shouldn’t call it directly.  report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   167  guestbook-postgres-2 resources sql queries.sql -- :name create-user!* :! :n -- :doc creates a new user with the provided login and hashed password INSERT INTO users  login, password  VALUES  :login, :password  -- :name get-user-for-auth* :? :1 -- :doc selects a user for authentication SELECT * FROM users WHERE login = :login  Next, let’s create a new namespace for managing accounts, authentication, and authorization called guestbook.auth. We’ll need to include a new dependency for managing our cryptography first.  guestbook-postgres-2 project.clj [buddy "2.0.0"]  The  encryption  library  we’ll  be  using, Buddy,1  has  many  useful  features  for working  with  passwords  and  authentication authorization.  Its  buddy.hash- ers derive  and  buddy.hashers check  functions  allow  us  to  work  with  passwords easily and securely. The derive function will generate a salt, hash the salted password, and join the chosen algorithm, salt, and hashed password into a single string. The check function will compare the supplied password against the hashed one, managing the details for us.  Since  we’ve  added  a  new  dependency,  we’ll  have  to  restart  our  app.  Once we’ve done so, let’s create our guestbook.auth namespace and write create-user! and authenticate-user functions using our new queries.  guestbook-postgres-2 src clj guestbook auth.clj  ns guestbook.auth   :require [buddy.hashers :as hashers] [next.jdbc :as jdbc] [guestbook.db.core :as db]     defn create-user! [login password]   jdbc with-transaction [t-conn db *db*]   if-not  empty?  db get-user-for-auth* t-conn {:login login}     throw  ex-info "User already exists!"  {:guestbook error-id ::duplicate-user :error "User already exists!"}     db create-user!* t-conn {:login :password  hashers derive password }      login  1.  https:  github.com funcool buddy  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   168   defn authenticate-user [login password]   let [{hashed :password :as user}  db get-user-for-auth* {:login login} ]   when  hashers check password hashed    dissoc user :password      Note that we’re using a db transaction in create-user! to ensure that our queries are performed atomically. We’re checking if a user exists explicitly so that we can throw a more informative error than the default. Now that we have our auth functions written, let’s try them out from the repl:   create-user! "testuser" "testpass"   user>  in-ns 'guestbook.auth  namespace[guestbook.auth] guestbook.auth> 1 guestbook.auth>  authenticate-user "testuser" "testpass"  {:login "testuser", :created_at inst "2019-09-20T02:22:53.217-00:00"} guestbook.auth>  authenticate-user "testuser" "wrongpass"  nil guestbook.auth>  Good! We’re able to create a user, and we authenticate only when our password is correct.  Next, let’s add a simple login route to our API.  Let’s start by requiring our guestbook.auth namespace from guestbook.routes.services:  guestbook-postgres-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj [guestbook.auth :as auth]  Then, let’s add the " api login" route to our API  inside service-routes :  guestbook-postgres-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" login" {:post {:parameters  {:body {:login string? :password string?}}  :responses {200 {:body {:identity {:login string? :created_at inst?}}}  401 {:body {:message string?}}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [login password]} :body} :parameters :session}]  session   if-some [user  auth authenticate-user login password ]  report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   169   ->  response ok {:identity user}   assoc :session  assoc session  :identity user      response unauthorized {:message "Incorrect login or password."}   }}]  We’ve written our handler which wraps our guestbook.auth authenticate-user function and provides informative HTTP status codes and error messages. Let’s try it out in Swagger UI:  First, we’ll try the credentials we created earlier:  We got a 200 OK response with our account info.  Now let’s try an incorrect password:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   170  We got a 401 Unauthorized response with a helpful error message.  Now, let’s add a user registration route:  guestbook-postgres-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" register" {:post {:parameters  {:body {:login string? :password string? :confirm string?}}  :responses {200 {:body {:message string?}} 400 {:body {:message string?}} 409 {:body {:message string?}}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [login password confirm]} :body} :parameters}]   if-not  = password confirm    response bad-request  report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   171  {:message "Password and Confirm do not match."}    try   auth create-user! login password   response ok {:message "User registration successful. Please log in."}    catch clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo e   if  =  :guestbook error-id  ex-data e    ::auth duplicate-user    response conflict {:message "Registration failed! User with login already exists!"}    throw e      }}]  We’ve wrapped guestbook.auth create-user! with logic that checks if our password and confirm are equal, attempts to create a new user, and catches our custom error. Let’s try it out in Swagger UI:  First, we’ll try creating a new account:  We got a 200 OK response with our success message.  report erratum     discuss   Now let’s try creating a user that already exists:  Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   172  We got a 409 Conflict response with our error message.  Finally, let’s see what happens when we provide an incorrect :confirm value:  report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   173  We got a 400 Bad Request response with a helpful error message.  Finally, let’s add a simple log out route:  guestbook-postgres-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" logout" {:post {:handler  fn [_]   ->  response ok   assoc :session nil   }}]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   174  Everything is working as expected. Now we can move on to building UI com- ponents that work with these endpoints.  Client  Now that we have our login and registration endpoints fully functional, let’s add login and registration to our SPA. Let’s start by adding the login and register buttons to the right side of our navbar. Clicking these buttons will display the relevant modal.  Currently  our  app  renders  our  navbar  on  the  server.  The  simplest  way  to modify the navbar using ClojureScript is to remove all server-side rendering and move any layout from HTML into our reagent component. We aren’t using the placeholder about page, so let’s delete about.html and then move our navbar and and container components into ClojureScript.  Let’s update our base.html as follows:  guestbook-postgres-2 resources html base.html              Welcome to guestbook    {% style " assets bulma css bulma.min.css" %} {% style " assets material-icons css material-icons.min.css" %} {% style " css screen.css" %}     report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   175  then, let’s create two reagent components, navbar and app. The navbar component will just be the exact same navbar for now, and the app component will contain navbar and wrap home in a section and a container:     {% block content %} {% endblock %}   {% block page-scripts %} {% endblock %}        guestbook-postgres-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn navbar []   let [burger-active  r atom false ]   fn []  [:nav.navbar.is-info [:div.container [:div.navbar-brand [:a.navbar-item {:href " " :style {:font-weight "bold"}} "guestbook"] [:span.navbar-burger.burger {:data-target "nav-menu" :on-click  swap! burger-active not  :class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:span] [:span] [:span]]]  [:divnav-menu.navbar-menu {:class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:div.navbar-start [:a.navbar-item {:href " "} "Home"]]]]]      defn app [] [:div.app [navbar] [:section.section [:div.container [home]]]]   and finally, let’s update our call to reagent.core render to use our app component instead of home:  guestbook-postgres-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn ^:dev after-load mount-components []  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   176   rf clear-subscription-cache!   .log js console "Mounting Components..."   dom render ['app]  .getElementById js document "content"    .log js console "Components Mounted!"    Adding Log In  Now that our navbar is rendering on the client, let’s add our login modal. The first  thing  we  need  to  do  is  create  a  modal  component  that  wraps  Bulma modals:   assoc-in db [:app active-modals modal-id] true      update db :app active-modals dissoc modal-id     guestbook-login src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-db :app show-modal  fn [db [_ modal-id]]   rf reg-event-db :app hide-modal  fn [db [_ modal-id]]   rf reg-sub :app active-modals  fn [db _]   :app active-modals db {}      rf reg-sub :app modal-showing? :<- [:app active-modals]  fn [modals [_ modal-id]]   get modals modal-id false      defn modal-card [id title body footer]  [:div.modal {:class  when @ rf subscribe [:app modal-showing? id]  "is-active" } [:div.modal-background {:on-click  rf dispatch [:app hide-modal id] }] [:div.modal-card [:header.modal-card-head [:p.modal-card-title title] [:button.delete {:on-click  rf dispatch [:app hide-modal id] }]]  [:section.modal-card-body body] [:footer.modal-card-foot footer]]]    defn modal-button [id title body footer]  [:div [:button.button.is-primary {:on-click  rf dispatch [:app show-modal id] } title]  report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   177  [modal-card id title body footer]]   We  have  two  modal  events,  show  and  hide.  These  events  add  and  remove entries  in  a  map  that  tracks  all  active  modals.  We’re  only  adding true  as  a value for now, but theoretically we could place arguments to our modal ren- dering function instead. We then have two subscriptions, one that gets our active modals map, and one that gets a specific modal if it’s active.  Our simplest modal component modal-card takes an id, along with some contents and  displays  if  the  modal  is  active.  Then,  since  our  login  and  registration modals will be spawned by clicking a button, we have a wrapper called modal- button. This component creates a button that will trigger :app show-modal and a modal-card component.  Note that the way we are managing modals is specific to Bulma CSS. Larger apps or apps that use different CSS frameworks may require having a multi- method  as  a  registry  of  modal  types,  along  with  a  subscription  used  by  a single global modal component to specify the modal type and contents to be displayed.  Now that we have a modal component, let’s create our login modal-button, along with a user nameplate, a logout button, and any required re-frame events or subscriptions:  guestbook-login src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-db :auth handle-login  fn [db [_ {:keys [identity]}]]   assoc db :auth user identity      rf reg-event-db :auth handle-logout  fn [db _]   dissoc db :auth user      rf reg-sub :auth user  fn [db _]   :auth user db     defn login-button []   r with-let   r atom nil   [fields  r atom {}  error do-login  fn [_]   reset! error nil   POST " api login"  {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"}  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6.

Our markup is straightforward, but we have some bundled logic and state. We’ve written  our  AJAX  logic  inside  of  our  login  and  logout  components.  This  is generally discouraged, but since login and logout are necessarily isolated it makes sense to keep it contained. Although we chose plain reagent to keep it simple, it would be just as valid to handle this workflow using re-frame.  Now, let’s add our buttons to the navbar so we can see what they look like:  guestbook-login src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn navbar []   let [burger-active  r atom false ]   fn []  [:nav.navbar.is-info [:div.container [:div.navbar-brand [:a.navbar-item {:href " " :style {:font-weight "bold"}} "guestbook"] [:span.navbar-burger.burger {:data-target "nav-menu" :on-click  swap! burger-active not  :class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:span] [:span] [:span]]]  [:divnav-menu.navbar-menu {:class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:div.navbar-start [:a.navbar-item {:href " "} "Home"]]  [:div.navbar-end [:div.navbar-item  if-some [user @ rf subscribe [:auth user] ]  [:div.buttons [nameplate user] [logout-button]] [:div.buttons [login-button]] ]]]]]     Now that we’ve done the login modal, registration should be quite straightfor- ward:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   180  guestbook-register src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn register-button []   r with-let   r atom nil   [fields  r atom {}  error do-register  fn [_]   reset! error nil   POST " api register"  {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"} :params @fields :handler  fn [response]   reset! fields {}   rf dispatch [:app hide-modal :user register]   rf dispatch [:app show-modal :user login]    :error-handler  fn [error-response]   reset! error   or  :message  :response error-response    :status-text error-response  "Unknown Error"   }  ]  [modal-button :user register ;; Title "Create Account" ;; Body [:div  when-not  string blank? @error   [:div.notification.is-danger @error]  [:div.field [:div.label "Login"] [:div.control [:input.input {:type "text" :value  :login @fields  :on-change  swap! fields assoc :login  .. % -target -value  }]]]  [:div.field [:div.label "Password"] [:div.control [:input.input {:type "password" :value  :password @fields  :on-change  swap! fields assoc :password  .. % -target -value  }]]]  [:div.field [:div.label "Confirm Password"] [:div.control [:input.input {:type "password" :value  :confirm @fields  :on-change  swap! fields assoc :confirm  .. % -target -value    report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   181  ;; Submit login form when `Enter` key is pressed :on-key-down  when  =  .-keyCode %  13    do-register  }]]]]  ;; Footer [:button.button.is-primary.is-fullwidth {:on-click do-register :disabled  or  string blank?  :login @fields     string blank?  :password @fields    string blank?  :confirm @fields   }  "Create Account"]]    Then, let’s add our registration button to our navbar like so:  guestbook-register src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn navbar []   let [burger-active  r atom false ]   fn []  [:nav.navbar.is-info [:div.container [:div.navbar-brand [:a.navbar-item {:href " " :style {:font-weight "bold"}} "guestbook"] [:span.navbar-burger.burger {:data-target "nav-menu" :on-click  swap! burger-active not  :class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:span] [:span] [:span]]]  [:divnav-menu.navbar-menu {:class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:div.navbar-start [:a.navbar-item {:href " "} "Home"]]  [:div.navbar-end [:div.navbar-item  if-some [user @ rf subscribe [:auth user] ]  [:div.buttons [nameplate user] [logout-button]] [:div.buttons [login-button] [register-button]] ]]]]]     Our registration modal is almost identical to our login modal, we’ve just added the :confirm field, changed the URL, and tweaked the success handler.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6. Planning Our Application   182  Finally, you might’ve noticed that we no longer display the logged in user if we refresh the page. Let’s fix that by loading our user from the session if we have one.  We’ll start by requiring spec-tools.data-spec in our guestbook.routes.services namespace. We’ll see how it comes in handy in a moment.  guestbook-session src clj guestbook routes services.clj [spec-tools.data-spec :as ds]  Then, let’s add an endpoint under  api session to fetch our current session if it exists:  guestbook-session src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" session" {:get {:responses {200 {:body {:session {:identity  ds maybe {:login string? :created_at inst?} }}}}  :handler  fn [{{:keys [identity]} :session}]   response ok {:session  {:identity  not-empty  select-keys identity [:login :created_at]  }}  }}]  We need to be careful about what we return to the client. We should explicitly specify what is sent so that we’re sure we’re not leaking any sensitive data. We used spec-tools.data-spec maybe in our response spec to indicate that we might not have an identity available.  Now, let’s load this information when we load our page:  guestbook-session src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :app initialize  fn [_ _]  {:db {:messages loading? true :session loading? true}  :dispatch-n [[:session load] [:messages load]]}    ;;...  rf reg-event-fx :session load  fn [{:keys [db]} _]  {:db  assoc db :session loading? true   report erratum     discuss   Adding User Management   183  Finally, let’s update our navbar to depend on whether our session is loading or not:  :ajax get {:url " api session"  :success-path [:session] :success-event [:session set]}}    ;;...  rf reg-event-db :session set  fn [db [_ {:keys [identity]}]]   assoc db  :auth user identity :session loading? false      rf reg-sub :session loading?  fn [db _]   :session loading? db     guestbook-session src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-sub :auth user-state :<-[:auth user] :<-[:session loading?]  fn [[user loading?]]   cond   true? loading?  :loading user :else  :authenticated :anonymous      defn navbar []   let [burger-active  r atom false ]   fn []  [:nav.navbar.is-info [:div.container [:div.navbar-brand [:a.navbar-item {:href " " :style {:font-weight "bold"}} "guestbook"] [:span.navbar-burger.burger {:data-target "nav-menu" :on-click  swap! burger-active not  :class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:span] [:span] [:span]]]  [:divnav-menu.navbar-menu {:class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:div.navbar-start [:a.navbar-item {:href " "}  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 6.

What you’ve learned  We’ve learned how to identify the core components of our application without restricting  future  enhancements.  We  covered  the  standard  approach  for account management in Clojure, including cryptographic best practices.  In  the  next  chapter,  we’ll  build  upon  the  foundation  we  laid  down.  We’ll deliver the core features we described in our MVP. We’ll leverage our users table by adding authors to posts and requiring users to be authenticated in order to compose posts. Once we do that, we’ll have all the scaffolding neces- sary to add interesting features on demand. Then we’ll incrementally grow our pet project into a fully fledged social media application.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 7  Account Management  We have users set up, but we aren’t doing much with them. In this chapter, we will associate posts with their authors, enrich the user model  e.g. avatar, display name , and add an account management page. Our goal is to imple- ment user accounts, and leverage user profiles across the application. This includes creating an author page that includes a bio and a banner image and an account management page for adding and modifying a user profile.  Authorship  Currently, posts have an author name associated with them, but there is no association  with  an  account.  Let’s  add  that  relationship  so  that  we  can enhance posts to include elements from the author’s profile.  Associate messages with accounts  Let’s  think  about  what  the  author  relationship  will  look  like.  Is  an  author always present? Not necessarily. What if an account is deleted? What if we want  to  allow  anonymous  posts?  All  these  concerns  can  be  addressed  by creating an optional foreign key and handling posts without it.  Also,  since  we’re  constructing  the  expected  message  rather  than  getting  it back from the save-message! function, we need to update this behaviour in two different places: AJAX and websockets. We can do better than this, especially now that we have postgresql. Let’s add a RETURNING clause to our SQL so that we get all of our data exactly as it is in the database. Then, we’ll be able to return the full message from our save-message! function, and any generation will be in one place.  Let’s start by creating a migration that will add the relevant column to our posts table:  report erratum     discuss   guestbook-author resources migrations 20200126004141-alter-posts-add-author-column.up.sql ALTER TABLE posts  Chapter 7. Account Management   186  ADD COLUMN author TEXT  REFERENCES users login  ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE;  Don’t forget the down migration:  guestbook-author resources migrations 20200126004141-alter-posts-add-author-column.down.sql ALTER TABLE posts  DROP COLUMN author;  Then,  let’s  update  our  save-message!  sql  to  accept  an  identity  and  add  our RETURNING clause:  guestbook-author resources sql queries.sql -- :name save-message! :<! :1 -- :doc creates a new message using the name and message keys INSERT INTO posts  author, name, message  VALUES  :author, :name, :message  RETURNING *;  Then, let’s update guestbook.messages save-message! to accept an identity:  guestbook-author src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn save-message! [{:keys [login]} message]  if-let [errors  validate-message message ]   throw  ex-info "Message is invalid"  {:guestbook error-id :validation :errors errors}     db save-message!  assoc message :author login      Then, let’s update routes services.clj to pass in the identity from the session and return our newly authored :post:  guestbook-author src clj guestbook routes services.clj  fn [{{params :body} :parameters  {:keys [identity]} :session}]   try   ->>  msg save-message! identity params    assoc {:status :ok} :post   response ok    catch Exception e   let [{id  :guestbook error-id  errors :errors}  ex-data e ]   case id  :validation  response bad-request {:errors errors}  ;;else  response internal-server-error  report erratum     discuss   Authorship   187  {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to save message!"]}}        Lastly, we need to update routes websockets.clj to pass the identity to save-message!, but we have a problem: the only session map we have is from when we first opened our connection! We need a way to access our session from our handle- message methods, but this is impossible with the default session middleware configuration. Luckily it’s easy to provide our own session store so it can be accessed where necessary.  guestbook-author src clj guestbook session.clj  ns guestbook.session   :require [ring-ttl-session.core :refer [ttl-memory-store]]     defonce store  ttl-memory-store  * 60 30     defn ring-req->session-key [req]   get-in req [:cookies "ring-session" :value]     defn read-session [req]   .read-session store  ring-req->session-key req      defn write-session [req v]   .write-session store  ring-req->session-key req  v    Now that we have an accessible session store, we need to pass it to wrap-defaults instead of the default ring-ttl-session generated by Luminus:  guestbook-author src clj guestbook middleware.clj  ns guestbook.middleware   :require  ;;... [guestbook.session :as session]    ;;...  defn wrap-base [handler]   ->   :middleware defaults  handler    wrap-defaults   -> site-defaults   assoc-in [:security :anti-forgery] false   assoc-in  [:session :store] session store     wrap-internal-error    Next, let’s update our guestbook.routes.websockets receive-message! function to read the session directly from the session store and associate it onto the message map that is passed to handle-message:  guestbook-author src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defn receive-message! [{:keys [id ?reply-fn ring-req]  message}]  log debug "Got message with id: " id   let [reply-fn  or ?reply-fn  fn [_]    :as  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   188  session  session read-session ring-req  response  -> message   assoc :session session  handle-message ]   when response   reply-fn response      Finally,  let’s  update  the :message create!  method  of handle-message  to  pass  the identity from the session to msg save-message!:  guestbook-author src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defmethod handle-message :message create! [{:keys [?data uid session] :as message}]  let [response  try   msg save-message!  :identity session  ?data  ;;...  There we go, we have accounts associated on the server side.  Next, let’s update our client to show the author’s handle next to the name.  guestbook-author src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn message-list [messages]  [:ul.messages  for [{:keys [timestamp message name author]} @messages]  ^{:key timestamp} [:li [:time  .toLocaleString timestamp ] [:p message] [:p " - " name ;; Add the author  e.g.    " <"  if author   str "@" author  [:span.is-italic "account not found"]   ">"]] ]   All done! Our posts should now look like this:  Next, let’s prevent anonymous users from posting.  report erratum     discuss   Authorship   189  Restrict posting to authenticated users  Currently, we are able to pass a null author. We decided this may be allowed later, but let’s disable it for now.  If we were just using AJAX through our ring handler, we’d use default mid- dleware provided by buddy,1 but we have to make sure that websocket mes- sages are properly restricted as well. Let’s deal with this by writing our own authorization functions.  Let’s  start  by  adding  some  authorization  functions  to  our  guestbook.auth namespace. We’ll keep as much logic as possible protocol agnostic.  guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook auth.clj  defn identity->roles [identity]   cond-> {:any}   some? identity   conj :authenticated      def roles  {:message create! {:authenticated} :auth login {:any} :auth logout {:any} :account register {:any} :session get {:any} :messages list {:any} :swagger swagger {:any}}   We need two things to decide if authorization checks out: the roles that belong to the user performing the request, and the roles authorized to perform the request. Our identity->roles function takes a user’s identity and returns a set of roles to which that user belongs. Our roles map defines the roles that can perform each action.  Next,  let’s  create  two  new  namespaces:  guestbook.auth.ring  for  ring  specific authorization, and guestbook.auth.ws for websocket specific authorization. First, guestbook.auth.ring:  guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook auth ring.clj  ns guestbook.auth.ring   :require [clojure.tools.logging :as log] [guestbook.auth :as auth] [reitit.ring :as ring]     defn authorized? [roles req]   if  seq roles    ->> req  1.  https:  github.com funcool buddy  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   190  :session :identity auth identity->roles  some roles  boolean    do   log error "roles: " roles " is empty for route: "  :uri req   false      defn get-roles-from-match [req]   -> req   ring get-match   get-in [:data ::auth roles] {}      defn wrap-authorized [handler unauthorized-handler]   fn [req]   if  authorized?  get-roles-from-match req  req    handler req   unauthorized-handler req      Then, guestbook.auth.ws:  guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook auth ws.clj  ns guestbook.auth.ws   :require [guestbook.auth :as auth]     defn authorized? [roles-by-id msg]   boolean  some  roles-by-id  :id msg  {}    -> msg  :session :identity  auth identity->roles       Let’s  start  by  applying  our  authorization  logic  to  our  websocket  message handler. First, we need to require guestbook.auth and guestbook.auth.ws:  guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj [guestbook.auth :as auth] [guestbook.auth.ws :refer [authorized?]]  Then, let’s update our receive-message! function to apply our authorization logic to all messages except system ones:  guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defn receive-message! [{:keys [id ?reply-fn ring-req]  :as  message}]   case id   log debug "Bad Package:\n" message  :chsk bad-package  log debug "Bad Event: \n" message  :chsk bad-event  log trace  :event message   :chsk uidport-open :chsk uidport-close  log trace  :event message    report erratum     discuss   Authorship   191  :chsk ws-ping ;; ELSE  let [reply-fn  or ?reply-fn  fn [_]    nil  session  session read-session ring-req  message  -> message   assoc :session session  ]   log debug "Got message with id: " id   if  authorized? auth roles message    when-some [response  handle-message message ]   reply-fn response     do   log info "Unauthorized message: " id   reply-fn {:message "You are not authorized to perform this action!"  :errors {:unauthorized true}}        We  have  a  case  statement  which  handles  our  system  messages,  and  any other  messages  get  checked  with  authorized?  and  handled  accordingly.  This means that we have to explicitly allow any new message types, which makes it difficult to accidentally break our authorization rules. Since our unautho- rized error is handled outside handle-message, we can’t provide a specific error message like we do with :message create!. Let’s just return :unauthorized true and let the client set the message text.  Finally, we can remove our handle-message method for :chsk ws-ping, since we are handling it directly from receive-message! now.  Now let’s add authorization to our API routes.  First, let’s require the necessary namespaces:  guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook routes services.clj [guestbook.auth.ring :refer [wrap-authorized get-roles-from-match]] [clojure.tools.logging :as log]  Then, let’s add our middleware function with an unauthorized handler pro- vided:  guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook routes services.clj  defn service-routes []  [" api" {:middleware [;;...   fn [handler]   wrap-authorized handler  fn handle-unauthorized [req]   let [route-roles  get-roles-from-match req ]   log debug "Roles for route: "  :uri req  route-roles   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   192   log debug "User is unauthorized!"   -> req  :session :identity :roles     response forbidden {:message  str "User must have one of the following roles: "  route-roles }     ]  Finally, let’s use our roles map to set :guestbook.auth roles on each endpoint:  :muuntaja formats instance :coercion spec-coercion coercion :swagger {:id ::api}} ;; API routes ... ]   guestbook-authorization src clj guestbook routes services.clj ["" {:no-doc true  ::auth roles  auth roles :swagger swagger }  [" swagger.json" {:get  swagger create-swagger-handler }] [" swagger-ui*" {:get  swagger-ui create-swagger-ui-handler  {:url " api swagger.json"} }]]  ;;... [" login" {::auth roles  auth roles :auth login  ;;...}] ;;...  [" logout" {::auth roles  auth roles :auth logout  ;;...}] ;;...  [" register" {::auth roles  auth roles :account register  ;;...}] ;;...  [" session" {::auth roles  auth roles :session get  ;;...}] ;;...  [" messages" {::auth roles  auth roles :messages list  ;;...}] ;;...  [" message" {::auth roles  auth roles :message create!  ;;...}] ;;...  report erratum     discuss   Authorship   193  Now, like we did in websockets, we are checking authorization on each API call and returning an unauthorized response if it fails. Also, we are returning unauthorized if there are no roles provided on :guestbook.auth roles. Again, this is to prevent accidentally breaking authorization rules by requiring that they be specified in order for the endpoint to be usable.  Now that we have our authorization set up, let’s make sure our client shows any errors to the user.  Let’s add an :unauthorized errors component, and let’s update errors-component to take an optional second parameter: message which will allow us to set a message explicitly.  guestbook-authorization src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn errors-component [id & [message]]   when-let [error @ rf subscribe [:form error id] ]  [:div.notification.is-danger  if message  message  string join error  ]    ;;...  defn message-form []  [:div [errors-component :server-error] [errors-component :unauthorized "Please log in before posting."] ;;...]   Now we have a generic error for message posting authorization, but ideally we shouldn’t even let users try if they aren’t logged in. Let’s wrap our message- form in case statement that will only display it if a user is logged in, and will display a prompt to login or register otherwise. We used this pattern in our navbar component, and we’ll use it again in home.  guestbook-authorization src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn home []   let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]   fn []  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Messages"] [message-list messages]] [:div.columns>div.column [reload-messages-button]] [:div.columns>div.column  case @ rf subscribe [:auth user-state]   :loading [:div {:style {:width "5em"}} [:progress.progress.is-dark.is-small {:max 100} "30%"]] :authenticated  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   194  [message-form] :anonymous [:div.notification.is-clearfix [:span "Log in or create an account to post a message!"] [:div.buttons.is-pulled-right [login-button] [register-button]]] ]]     There we go. Let’s check the browser to see how that looks:  Now users can’t post messages until they log in, and even if authorization becomes more complicated, a message will still show up.  Add API endpoint for posts by author  Any new messages we receive will now have an author associated with it. This is incredibly useful, and is the cornerstone of nearly every successful social media  platform.  Let’s  build  some  API  endpoints  to  make  use  of  this  new relationship.  We’ll start by adding a SQL query to get messages by author:  guestbook-author-2 resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-messages-by-author :? :* -- :doc selects all messages posted by a user SELECT * from posts WHERE author = :author  Then, we’ll write a wrapper function in guestbook.messages:  guestbook-author-2 src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn messages-by-author [author]  {:messages  vec  db get-messages-by-author {:author author}  }   Then, we’ll write an endpoint in guestbook.routes.services to fetch the messages:  guestbook-author-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" messages" {::auth roles  auth roles :messages list } ["" {:get  {:responses  report erratum     discuss   Authorship   195  {200 {:body ;; Data Spec for response body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst?}]}}}  :handler  fn [_]   response ok  msg message-list   }}]  [" by :author" {:get {:parameters {:path {:author string?}} :responses {200 {:body ;; Data Spec for response body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst?}]}}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [author]} :path} :parameters}]   response ok  msg messages-by-author author   }}]]  Notice that we’ve updated the  api messages route to have two children which share the same authorization. This means that as we add additional ways to search messages, we can place them all under the same parent route so that they can share configuration. Also notice that we haven’t updated our spec to include our :author key. It will still work because clojure.spec is open, meaning that additional keys are ignored.  Let’s try it out with swagger to make sure it works:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   196  Looks good.  Now that we have that sorted, let’s add an author page that displays all posts by a given author.  Add Author’s Posts Page  Now that we have posts associated with authors, it’d be nice to have a page for each author. Let’s add a new page to our client that shows all posts for a specific user. In order to accomplish this, we need to change the code that is run based on the URL we load. There are two parts to accomplishing this. First, we need to ensure that all of our frontend URLs return the same HTML, so that our clojurescript can control what happens. Second, we need some conditional logic to change behaviour based on the URL. Additionally, although it isn’t strictly necessary, we’d like to prevent our page from fully reloading  report erratum     discuss   Add Author’s Posts Page   197  any time we navigate. We’ll do this by leveraging the HTML5 history API to change what happens on page navigation.  To accomplish this, we’ll be using the frontend module of reitit,2 the routing library we’ve been using on the server.  Setting up front-end routing  The first thing we’ll need to do is get a trivial routing setup that simply wraps our main page.  Let’s start by requiring the namespaces we’ll be using:  guestbook-author-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  ns guestbook.core   :require ;;... [reitit.coercion.spec :as reitit-spec] [reitit.frontend :as rtf] [reitit.frontend.easy :as rtfe] ;;...    Then, let’s create our routes and our router:  guestbook-author-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  def routes  [" " ["" {:name ::home  :view home}]]    def router   rtf router routes {:data {:coercion reitit-spec coercion}}    Now, we’ll need a way to connect our router to our browser URL and to re- frame. Let’s write a :router navigated event to be fired after browser navigation, a :router current-route subscription to access our current route, and then connect our  event  and  our  router  to  the  HTML5  history  API  by  using  reitit.fron- tend.easy start!:  guestbook-author-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-db :router navigated  fn [db [_ new-match]]   assoc db :router current-route new-match      rf reg-sub :router current-route  2.  https:  metosin.github.io reitit frontend basics.html  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   198   fn [db]   :router current-route db      defn init-routes! []   rtfe start! router  fn [new-match]   when new-match   rf dispatch [:router navigated new-match]     {:use-fragment false}    ;;...  defn ^:dev after-load mount-components []   rf clear-subscription-cache!   .log js console "Mounting Components..."   init-routes!   dom render ['app]  .getElementById js document "content"    .log js console "Components Mounted!"    Finally, we need to modify our app component to reflect the state of the current route:  guestbook-author-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn page [{{:keys [view name]} :data  path  :path}]  [:section.section>div.container  if view [view] [:div "No view specified for route: " name "  " path " "] ]    defn app []   let [current-route @ rf subscribe [:router current-route] ]  [:div.app [navbar] [page current-route]]    Great!  We  now  have  our  router  initializing,  and  we’re  responding  to  the changes to the current route from our main reagent component via the re- frame db. As we add individual pages to routes, they’ll work seamlessly.  We actually haven’t changed our app’s behaviour in any noticable way. Let’s add a dummy page to stand in for our author page so we can see what’s going on.  guestbook-author-3 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn author []  [:div [:p "This page hasn't been implemented yet!"] [:a {:href " "} "Return home"]]    def routes  [" " [""  report erratum     discuss   Add Author’s Posts Page   199  {:name ::home :view home}] ["user :user" {:name ::author :view author}]]   Then, let’s add a link to this new page from our message-list component:  guestbook-author-3 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn message-list [messages]  [:ul.messages  for [{:keys [timestamp message name author]} @messages]  ^{:key timestamp} [:li [:time  .toLocaleString timestamp ] [:p message] [:p " - " name ;; Add the author  e.g.    " <"  if author  [:a {:href  str " user " author }  str "@" author ] [:span.is-italic "account not found"]   ">"]] ]   Now, if we click on one of these URLs, we should see a page like this:  Looks  like  everything  is  working,  but  we  missed  something.  If  you  try refreshing this page, you’ll get a 404 response! We forgot to update our server to respond to all of our valid frontend routes with our app page.  There  are  multiple  ways  to  accomplish  this.  The  most  thorough  way  is  to define your frontend routes in a CLJC file and have each match respond with our app. Alternatively, you could have a top-level path  e.g.  app   which will always respond with our app and prefix all front end routes with it. Or, you could have a default route that responds with our app if no other match is found.  Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, we’re gonna take a moment to move our front end routes to a cljc file. While we’re at it, we should organize our frontend code so that it doesn’t get out of hand as it grows.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   200  Sharing Routes Across Client and Server  We’re about to refactor our ClojureScript pretty substantially, so let’s map out what we want to put where. First, we’ll move our routes declaration into src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc  so  that  it  can  be  referenced  from  the  server  in addition to the client. Inside our routes, we’ll also define a top level :get handler for the clojure version based on the home-page we defined in guestbook.routes.home.  guestbook-cljc-routing src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc  ns guestbook.routes.app   :require ?@ :clj [[guestbook.layout :as layout]  [guestbook.middleware :as middleware]]  :cljs [[guestbook.views.home :as home]  [guestbook.views.author :as author]]     ? :clj   defn home-page [request]   layout render request "home.html"     defn app-routes []  ["" ? :clj {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf]  :get home-page}   [" "  merge {:name ::home} ? :cljs  {:view 'home home}  ]  [" user :user"  merge {:name ::author} ? :cljs {:view 'author author}  ]]   If you are unfamiliar with ? and ?@ reader conditionals, see Reader Condi- tionals, on page 382 for more details. Additionally, we’ve used ' in front of our views. This denotes a resolved var, so that if our view declarations change, these changes will be reloaded properly. Otherwise, routes will keep the stale definition of the views even if our code is reloaded.  Next, we’ll update guestbook.handler to reference guestbook.routes.app app-routes instead of guestbook.routes.home home-routes:  guestbook-cljc-routing src clj guestbook handler.clj  ns guestbook.handler   :require ;;... [guestbook.routes.app :refer [app-routes]]  report erratum     discuss   Add Author’s Posts Page   201  ;;...    ;;...  mount defstate routes  :start  ring ring-handler   ring router [ app-routes  ;;...]  ;;...    ;;...  defn app []  src cljs guestbook  ├── ajax.cljs ├── auth.cljs ├── core.cljs ├── messages.cljs ├── modals.cljs ├── views │ │ └── websockets.cljs  ├── author.cljs └── home.cljs   middleware wrap-base 'routes    Notice that we had to rename our app-routes state since it conflicts with the app-routes we just added. This is not a problem, since it isn’t referenced from outside this namespace. We’ll just have to remember to restart our app once we’re finished refactoring.  Now we can delete guestbook.routes.home since it’s been replaced.  That’s it for the server and the cljc, now let’s refactor our ClojureScript. We’ll structure our ClojureScript files like so:  Let’s start with the guestbook.views.* namespaces since they’re referenced from our cljc. The views  directory will have a file corresponding to each page we have in our application - just author and home for now.

Likewise, we moved our :ajax get effect to it’s own namespace, guestbook.ajax:  guestbook-cljc-routing src cljs guestbook ajax.cljs  ns guestbook.ajax   :require [ajax.core :refer [GET]] [re-frame.core :as rf]     rf reg-fx :ajax get  fn [{:keys [url success-event error-event success-path]}]   GET url   cond-> {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"}}  success-event  assoc :handler   rf dispatch   conj success-event   if success-path   get-in % success-path  %      assoc :error-handler  rf dispatch   conj error-event %         error-event  report erratum     discuss   And finally, we have our cleaned up guestbook.core namespace where it all comes together:  Chapter 7. Account Management   208  guestbook-cljc-routing src cljs guestbook core.cljs  ns guestbook.core   :require [reagent.core :as r] [reagent.dom :as dom] [re-frame.core :as rf] [reitit.coercion.spec :as reitit-spec] [reitit.frontend :as rtf] [reitit.frontend.easy :as rtfe] [clojure.string :as string] [guestbook.routes.app :refer [app-routes]] [guestbook.websockets :as ws] [guestbook.auth :as auth] [guestbook.messages :as messages] [guestbook.ajax :as ajax] [mount.core :as mount]     rf reg-event-fx :app initialize  fn [_ _]  {:db {:messages loading? true :session loading? true}  :dispatch-n [[:session load] [:messages load]]}     def router   rtf router  app-routes  {:data {:coercion reitit-spec coercion}}     assoc db :router current-route new-match      rf reg-event-db :router navigated  fn [db [_ new-match]]   rf reg-sub :router current-route  fn [db]   :router current-route db      defn init-routes!

[]   .log js console "Initializing App..."   mount start   rf dispatch [:app initialize]   mount-components    All  that  guestbook.core  does  now  is  initialize  our  re-frame  DB,  initialize  our router, connect our router to our re-frame DB, and define our navbar and page components. Also notice that to keep our server consistent, we changed routes to app-routes and we made it a function. We had to change that on the front end to match.  After all that refactoring, our code looks much nicer. Note that we haven’t really written any new code, we’ve just rearranged existing code into sensible namespaces. However, this is meaningless unless it still works as intended. Restart the application and make sure everything still works, and then we’re ready to move on.  Reitit has some additional frontend features we may eventually use, such as controllers and history manipulation, but we’ll discuss them as they come up. Let’s build out our client side pages, starting with our author page.  Implementing the client page  The first thing we’ll do is add an event to load our messages for a specific author and set :messages list from there.  guestbook-author-4 src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-fx  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   210  :messages load-by-author  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ author]]  {:db  assoc db :messages loading? true  :ajax get {:url  str " api messages by " author   :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}    Then, let’s update our author page to dispatch our :messages load-by-author event when it mounts, and have it display the messages list like so:  guestbook-author-4 src cljs guestbook views author.cljs  ns guestbook.views.author   :require [re-frame.core :as rf] [guestbook.messages :as messages]     defn author [{{{:keys [user]} :path} :parameters}]   rf dispatch [:messages load-by-author user]   let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]   fn [{{{:keys [user]} :path} :parameters}]  [:div.content>div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Messages By " user] [messages message-list messages]]]     Now if we go to the author page, everything looks correct. We have our list of messages  posted  by  the  author,  and  we  have  their  name  in  the  header. However, we’ve made a few oversights we should address.  First, if we navigate back to our homepage, we only see the messages by our author! This is because we’re only triggering :messages load once - from :app ini- tialize. If you click on the Refresh Messages button to reload them manually, we’ll see the correct list of messages. So, we’ll need to update our code to trigger :messages load any time we navigate to our homepage, not just when we first open our app.  Second, if you refresh the browser from the author page a few times you might see the full message list instead of the author’s messages. This is because we’ve introduced a race condition. In fact, we’ve introduced two!  Third, we forgot about our websocket’s :message add event broadcast. If we’re on an author’s page and someone submits a new post, it will be added to the page regardless of who the author is. Since the core functionality of our app is to display differently filtered lists of messages, this is a critical issue.  The first one we’ve introduced related to the way re-frame handles events. When dispatched, re-frame events are added to the back of an event queue. Asynchronously, events are taken from this queue and handled, which will  report erratum     discuss   Add Author’s Posts Page   211  resolve their effects. In the case of :app initialize we have a :dispatch-n effect, which will dispatch the specified events, adding them to the back of the event queue. This can introduce a race condition if there are other related events that may be dispatched shortly after. In our case, we are dispatching :messages load-by- author  almost  immediately  after  :app initialize.  Consider  what  happens  if  :mes- sages load-by-author is dispatched before :app initialize is handled. Once :app initialize is  handled,  it  will  add :messages load  to  the  back  of  the  event  queue,  behind :messages load-by-author. This means that our AJAX request to fetch the author’s messages will be sent before our AJAX request for the full list of messages, and so our author’s messages will likely come back first. If it does, then for a brief moment, :messages list will be our author’s messages, but it will quickly be overwritten by the result of our second request, and so it ends up being the full list of messages.  This alludes to our second race condition, but let’s solve this one first. We’ll change our init! function to use dispatch-sync instead of dispatch.  guestbook-author-4 src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn init! []   .log js console "Initializing App..."   mount start   rf dispatch-sync [:app initialize]   mount-components    This tells re-frame to handle the event immediately, don’t queue it, don’t do it asynchronously, handle it now. Usually, this should be avoided for many reasons. However, initialization is one of the few cases where it is often used. If we use dispatch-sync to initialize, we can guarantee that is handled before any components are rendered. This prevents a tonne of headaches and possible race conditions.  Now, let’s try our author page test a second time. It should work most of the time, but we still get a flash of the full messages list before we render the author’s messages. Also, even though it’s rare, there is still our second race condition we alluded to. To see this more clearly, let’s make our  api messages handler a bit slower. Temporarily update the handler in guestbook.routes.services like so:  [" messages"  {::auth roles  auth roles :messages list } ["" {:get  {:responses ;;... :handler  fn [_]   Thread sleep 500   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   212   response ok  msg message-list   }}]]  If this handler slows down a bit, our author page almost always breaks! This is no good. Even if it did work, we’d still be doing an entirely useless HTTP call. We’ll fix this by using controllers, but let’s resolve our critical websocket issue first.  Let’s add an add-message? predicate which takes a filter declaration from our db  and  the  message  to  be  added,  and  decides  whether  or  not  to  add  the message to our :messages list.  guestbook-author-5 src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn add-message? [filter-map msg]   every?  fn [[k matcher]]   let [v  get msg k ]   cond   set? matcher   matcher v   fn? matcher   matcher v  :else  = matcher v      filter-map    rf reg-event-db :message add  fn [db [_ message]]   if  add-message?  :messages filter db  message    update db :messages list conj message  db     Then, let’s set our filter when we fetch a new message list like so:  guestbook-author-5 src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :messages load  fn [{:keys [db]} _]  {:db  assoc db  :messages loading? true :messages filter nil  :ajax get {:url " api messages"  :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}     rf reg-event-fx :messages load-by-author  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ author]]  {:db  -> db   assoc :messages loading? true  :messages filter {:author author}    report erratum     discuss   Add Author’s Posts Page   213  :ajax get {:url  str " api messages by " author   :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}    Let’s test that in the UI to make sure we don’t render any messages that aren’t supposed to appear.  Great! Now that that’s taken care of, let’s return to our intermittent page ini- tialization bug.  Using Reitit Controllers  Right  now,  we  have  a  single  initialize  event  that  is  dispatched  when  our application loads. However, we also have some setup and teardown we need to perform for each individual page. Controllers3 provide a way to run start and stop functions based on our reitit route.  The simplest controller would be something like this:  [" foo :bar" {:controllers [{:start  fn [_]  println "Starting..."    :stop   fn [_]  println "Stopping..."  }]}]  This will run the :start function when we navigate to any URL that matches  foo :bar, and will run the :stop function when we navigate away from any route that  matches   foo :bar.  Since  we  haven’t  specified  anything  to  pass  in,  the argument will be nil. Also, if we navigate between two matches, for example  foo one and  foo two, we won’t run :start a second time.  If we wanted to “restart” a controller, we have to specify an identity. We can do this in two ways, either by specifying an :identity function which computes our identity from our reitit Match, or by specifying a :parameters declaration to compute our identity based on our Match’s parameters.  For example, we could do something like this:  [" foo :bar" {:controllers [{:parameters {:path [:bar]}  :start  fn [{{:keys [bar]} :path}]  println "Starting... " bar   :stop   fn [{{:keys [bar]} :path}]  println "Stopping... " bar  }]}]  This controller will call :start and :stop similarly to the previous one, but it will also call both of them if the :bar parameter is changed. So, if we go to  foo one we’ll see:  3.  https:  metosin.github.io reitit frontend controllers.html  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   214  Then, if we go to  foo two we’ll see:  Starting... one  Stopping... one Starting... two  Stopping... two  Then if we go to a route that doesn’t match we’ll see:  Note that it won’t restart if we go from  foo two?a=1 to  foo two?a=2 because we haven’t specified query parameters in our :parameters declaration.  Before we can start using controllers, we have to do a little bit of setup to call reitit.frontend.controllers apply-controllers when we navigate. So, let’s update our call to reitit.frontend.easy start! in guestbook.core init-routes! to do just that:  guestbook-controllers src cljs guestbook core.cljs  ns guestbook.core   :require ;;... [reitit.frontend.controllers :as rtfc] ;;...    ;;...  defn init-routes! []   rtfe start! router  fn [new-match]   when new-match   let [{controllers :controllers}  @ rf subscribe [:router current-route]  new-match-with-controllers  assoc new-match  :controllers  rtfc apply-controllers controllers new-match  ]   rf dispatch [:router navigated new-match-with-controllers]      {:use-fragment false}    There. Now we’re ready to write controllers for our home and author pages and fix our race condition.  Let’s start by writing a controller to load our full list of messages for the home page.  guestbook-controllers src cljs guestbook views home.cljs  def home-controllers  [{:start  fn [_]  rf dispatch [:messages load]  }]   report erratum     discuss   Add Author’s Posts Page   215  Then, let’s write our author page controller and remove the dispatch from inside the author component.  guestbook-controllers src cljs guestbook views author.cljs  def author-controllers  [{:parameters {:path [:user]}  :start  fn [{{:keys [user]} :path}]   rf dispatch [:messages load-by-author user]  }]   ;; Don't forget to remove  rf dispatch [:messages load-by-author user]  ;; from the author view!  Then, we need to add the controllers to our router.  guestbook-controllers src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc  defn app-routes []  ["" ? :clj {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf]  :get home-page}   [" "  merge {:name ::home} ? :cljs  {:controllers home home-controllers :view 'home home}  ]  [" user :user"  merge {:name ::author} ? :cljs {:controllers author author-controllers  :view 'author author}  ]]   guestbook-controllers src cljs guestbook core.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :app initialize  fn [_ _]  {:db {:session loading? true} :dispatch [:session load]}    Final Touches  And finally we need to remove our call to :messages load from :app initialize, and we can also remove the unnecessary :messages loading? from its :db effect.  Everything is working properly now, but we still have some leftover data for a split second, and even if we didn’t we have some unpleasant jumping on the home page. To solve this, let’s make sure that we clear :messages list before we send an AJAX request to fetch an updated version.  guestbook-controllers src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :messages load  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   216   fn [{:keys [db]} _]  {:db  assoc db  :messages loading? true :messages list nil :messages filter nil  :ajax get {:url " api messages"  :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}     rf reg-event-fx :messages load-by-author  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ author]]  {:db  assoc db  :messages loading? true :messages filter {:author author} :messages list nil   :ajax get {:url  str " api messages by " author   :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}    Also, let’s write a placeholder for message-list component to render instead if :messages loading? is true.  guestbook-controllers src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message-list-placeholder []  [:ul.messages [:li [:p "Loading Messages..."] [:div {:style {:width "10em"}} [:progress.progress.is-dark {:max 100} "30%"]]]]   Then,  we’ll  replace  our  uses  of  message-list  in  guestbook.views.home  and  guest- book.views.author with the following:   if @ rf subscribe [:messages loading?]   [messages message-list-placeholder] [messages message-list messages]   There we go!  Finally, let’s add a link to our own posts in the navbar if we’re logged in. Since we have reitit frontend set up, we can use reitit.frontend.easy href to do reverse routing.  guestbook-controllers src cljs guestbook core.cljs  defn navbar []  ;; Same as before, but with references to moved code  e.g. `auth nameplate`   let [burger-active  r atom false ]   fn []  [:nav.navbar.is-info [:div.container ;;...  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   217  [:divnav-menu.navbar-menu {:class  when @burger-active "is-active" } [:div.navbar-start [:a.navbar-item {:href " "} "Home"]  when  = @ rf subscribe [:auth user-state]  :authenticated   [:a.navbar-item {:href  rtfe href :guestbook.routes.app author  {:user  :login @ rf subscribe [:auth user]  } }  "My Posts"] ]  ;;... ]]]     We have the basics of our author page done, and we have laid the groundwork for adding future pages. Next, let’s add the ability for users to write a profile and customize their author page.  Account Customization  Now that we have a page for each author, it’d be nice for authors to be able to personalize it. Let’s add a user bio at the top of the page, along with a dis- play name, birth date, display picture, and a banner picture.  Let’s start by adding a profile column to the users table.  Create a new migration file from the repl like so:  user=>  create-migration "alter-users-add-profile"  nil  then, we’ll write the database migration to add our profile column.  guestbook-profile resources migrations 20200415001222-alter-users-add-profile.up.sql ALTER TABLE users  ADD COLUMN profile JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB;  Along with the rollback migration.  guestbook-profile resources migrations 20200415001222-alter-users-add-profile.down.sql ALTER TABLE users  DROP COLUMN profile;  Now, let’s run our migration from the REPL.  migratus.core - Starting migrations  user=>  migrate  ...

However,  we  need  to  add  extensions  to  the IResultSetReadColumn and ISQLValue protocols to support reading and writing clojure data structures as JSONB. Let’s add those to guestbook.db.core before we forget.  guestbook-profile src clj guestbook db core.clj  ns guestbook.db.core   :require ;;...

We’ve implemented IResultSetReadColumn for Array, returning a clojure vector, and for PGObjects of type JSON and JSONB, returning a clojure map.  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   219  Then, we’ve written a helper function to-pg-json to convert maps and vectors to PGObjects. We use this function in our implementations of ISQLValue for IPersis- tentMap and IPersistentVector to convert them into JSONB for use in queries. With that, we are all ready to work with our new JSONB column. Let’s add two SQL statements: one to edit our new profile column, and one to be used for selecting a user’s publicly available information.  :<! :1  guestbook-profile resources sql queries.sql -- :name set-profile-for-user* -- :doc sets a profile map for the specified user UPDATE users SET profile = :profile where :login = login RETURNING *; -- :name get-user* :? :1 -- :doc gets a user's publicly available information SELECT login, created_at, profile from users WHERE login = :login  Great! Let’s try using these new queries from the REPL:  user=>  in-ns 'guestbook.db.core  object[clojure.lang.Namespace ... "guestbook.db.core"] guestbook.db.core=>  conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"  {:snips {}, :fns {...}} guestbook.db.core=>  get-user* {:login "testuser"}  {:login "testuser", :created_at inst "...", :profile {}} guestbook.db.core=>  set-profile-for-user* {:login "testuser"  :profile {:bio "A test user"}}   {:login "testuser", :password "...", :created_at inst "...", :profile {:bio "A test user"}} guestbook.db.core=>  Success!  We’re  able  to  set  and  read  the  user’s  profile.  Next,  let’s  add  a namespace for dealing with author accounts, and add a couple endpoints for reading and writing profiles.  guestbook-profile src clj guestbook author.clj  ns guestbook.author   :require [guestbook.db.core :as db]     defn get-author [login]   db get-user* {:login login}     defn set-author-profile [login profile]  db set-profile-for-user* {:login login  :profile profile}    report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   220  Now, let’s add two endpoints for getting an author, and setting the currently logged in author’s profile. Also, when we set the currently logged in author’s profile, we need to remember to update the author on the session.  guestbook-profile src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" author :login" {::auth roles  auth roles :author get  :get {:parameters  {:path {:login string?}} :responses {200 {:body map?} 500 {:errors map?}} :handler  fn [{{{:keys [login]} :path} :parameters}]   response ok  author get-author login   }}]  [" my-account" [" set-profile" {::auth roles  auth roles :account set-profile!  :post {:parameters  {:body {:profile map?}} :responses {200 {:body map?} 500 {:errors map?}} :handler  fn [{{{:keys [profile]} :body}   try   let [identity  :parameters {:keys [identity] :as session} :session}]   author set-author-profile  :login identity  profile ]   update  response ok {:success true}   :session assoc :identity identity     catch Exception e   log error e   response internal-server-error {:errors {:server-error  ["Failed to set profile!"]}}    }}]]  We  also  need  to  add  two  entries  to  our roles  map  in guestbook.auth  for  these endpoints, or else they’ll always respond with 403 Forbidden.  guestbook-profile src clj guestbook auth.clj  def roles  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   221  {:message create! {:authenticated} :author get {:any} :account set-profile! {:authenticated} ;;...}   Alright, now let’s try our endpoints out from Swagger UI.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   222  Everything’s working as expected on the server side. Let’s put our new feature to use!  Creating a “My Profile” page  The first thing we need to do is allow users to create and edit their profiles. Let’s create a new page in our app to do just that.  Let’s create stubs for our profile page and controllers so that we can get our router set up correctly first.  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  ns guestbook.views.profile   :require [reagent.core :as r] [re-frame.core :as rf]    def profile-controllers  [{:start  fn [_]  println "Entering Profile Page"    :stop   fn [_]  println "Leaving Profile Page"  }]    defn profile [_]  [:div>h1 "My Profile"]   report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   223  Next, let’s add them to a new route in guestbook.routes.app app-routes:  guestbook-profile src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc  ns guestbook.routes.app   :require ?@ :clj [[guestbook.layout :as layout]  [guestbook.middleware :as middleware]]  :cljs [[guestbook.views.home :as home]  [guestbook.views.author :as author] [guestbook.views.profile :as profile]]     ;;... ;; defn app-routes [] ;;["" ;; ...  [" my-account edit-profile"  merge {:name ::profile} ? :cljs  {:controllers profile profile-controllers :view 'profile profile}  ]  ;;...]   Then,  let’s  update  our guestbook.auth nameplate  component  to  link  to  our  new profile page.  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook auth.cljs  defn nameplate [{:keys [login]}]  [:a.button.is-primary {:href  rtfe href :guestbook.routes.app profile } login]   Now if we log in and click on the nameplate button, we should see our profile page like so:  Great! We’re all ready to build our edit profile page. The first thing we need to  do  is  load  our  user’s  profile  from  the  server.  We’re  already  fetching  our session,  but  we’re  restricting  the  keys  on  the  identity.  Let’s  update  our  api session endpoint to include the user’s profile.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   224  guestbook-profile src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" session" {::auth roles  auth roles :session get  :get {:responses {200 {:body {:session {:identity  ds maybe {:login string? :created_at inst? :profile map?} }}}}  :handler  fn [{{:keys [identity]} :session}]   response ok {:session {:identity  not-empty  select-keys identity [:login :created_at :profile]  }}  }}]  Now that we have our :profile on our session, we can read it from [:auth user].  Let’s update our profile page to allow us to actually edit our profile. Let’s start by creating a textarea for our Bio. Remember, we already wrote some pretty general text and textarea inputs for our message form, so let’s use those. For the sake of cleanliness, let’s also move these two components into a general guestbook.components namespace.  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook components.cljs  ns guestbook.components  :require [reagent.core :as r]     defn text-input [{val  :value attrs :attrs :keys [on-save]}]   let [draft  r atom nil   value  r track  or @draft @val ""  ]   fn []  [:input.input  merge attrs  {:type :text :on-focus  reset! draft  or @val ""   :on-blur  fn []   on-save  or @draft ""    reset! draft nil    :on-change  reset! draft  .. % -target -value   :value @value} ]    :value   defn textarea-input [{val  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   225  attrs :attrs :keys [on-save]}]   let [draft  r atom nil   value  r track  or @draft @val ""  ]   fn []  [:textarea.textarea  merge attrs  {:on-focus  reset! draft  or @val ""   :on-blur  fn []   on-save  or @draft ""    reset! draft nil    :on-change  reset! draft  .. % -target -value   :value @value} ]     And  don’t  forget  to  update  the  guestbook.messages  namespace  declaration  to require the components we moved.  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  ns guestbook.messages   :require [clojure.string :as string] [reagent.core :as r] [re-frame.core :as rf] [guestbook.validation :refer [validate-message]] [guestbook.components :refer [text-input textarea-input]]    Now we’ll be able to use our standard components from our profile page.  Let’s start by creating some re-frame subscriptions for the edited state of our profile:  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  rf reg-sub :profile changes  fn [db _]   get db :profile changes      rf reg-sub :profile changed? :<- [:profile changes]  fn [changes _]   not  empty? changes       rf reg-sub :profile field-changed? :<- [:profile changes]  fn [changes [_ k]]   contains? changes k      rf reg-sub :profile field :<- [:profile changes] :<- [:auth user]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   226   fn [[changes {:keys [profile]}] [_ k default]]  or  get changes k   get profile k  default      rf reg-sub :profile profile :<- [:profile changes] :<- [:auth user]  fn [[changes {:keys [profile]}] _]   merge profile changes      rf reg-event-db :profile save-change  fn [db [_ k v]]   update db :profile changes   if  nil? v    dissoc % k   assoc % k v       We have a map, :profile changes, which contains the updated values of the :profile keys we’ve changed, some helper subscriptions for accessing individual fields.  Next, we’ll need to add some events to change our profile, but first we need to create a new effect to perform POST requests so that we can target our  api my- account set-profile endpoint.  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook ajax.cljs  rf reg-fx :ajax post  fn [{:keys [url success-event error-event success-path params]}]   POST url   cond-> {:headers {"Accept" "application transit+json"}}  params success-event  assoc :handler   assoc :params params    rf dispatch   conj success-event   if success-path   get-in % success-path  %      assoc :error-handler  rf dispatch   conj error-event %         error-event  Now, let’s write an event to POST our updated profile, and another to handle the response.  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :profile set-profile  fn [_ [_ profile]]  {:ajax post {:url " api my-account set-profile"  :params {:profile profile} :success-event [:profile handle-set-profile profile]}}    report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   227   rf reg-event-db :profile handle-set-profile  fn [db [_ profile]]   -> db   assoc-in [:auth user :profile] profile   dissoc :profile changes      Finally,  let’s  create  some  simple  components  for  editing  our  display  name and bio, and update our profile page view:  guestbook-profile src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  ns guestbook.views.profile   :require ;; require components [guestbook.components :refer [text-input textarea-input]] [reagent.core :as r] [re-frame.core :as rf]    ;; ...  defn display-name []   r with-let [k :display-name  value  rf subscribe [:profile field k ""] ]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for k} "Display Name"  when @ rf subscribe [:profile field-changed? k]   "  Changed " ]  [:div.field.has-addons [:div.control.is-expanded [text-input {:value value  :on-save  rf dispatch [:profile save-change k %] }]]  [:div.control>button.button.is-danger {:disabled  not @ rf subscribe [:profile field-changed? k]   :on-click  rf dispatch [:profile save-change k nil] } "Reset"]]]     defn bio []   r with-let [k :bio  value  rf subscribe [:profile field k ""] ]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for k} "Bio"  when @ rf subscribe [:profile field-changed? k]   "  Changed " ]  [:div.control {:style {:margin-bottom "0.5em"}} [textarea-input {:value value  :on-save  rf dispatch [:profile save-change k %] }]]  [:div.control>button.button.is-danger {:disabled  not @ rf subscribe [:profile field-changed? k]   :on-click  rf dispatch [:profile save-change k nil] } "Reset"]]     defn profile [_]  [:div.content   if-let [{:keys [login created_at profile]} @ rf subscribe [:auth user] ]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   228   " ]  [:h1 "My Account"  str " [:p  str "Joined: "  .toString created_at  ] [display-name] [bio] [:button.button.is-primary {:on-click   rf dispatch [:profile set-profile  @ rf subscribe [:profile profile] ]  :disabled  not @ rf subscribe [:profile changed?]  } "Update Profile"]]  [:div.content [:div {:style {:width "100%"}} [:progress.progress.is-dark {:max 100} "30%"]]]    We’ve written two components, display-name and bio, which allow us to change the value of our display name and bio locally along with a reset button. Then, we use them from our profile page, which also includes an updated header and an Update Profile button to send our changes to the server.  Next, we’ll need to support media uploading in order to select an avatar and a banner image.  Managing Media  The first step to managing media uploading is having a place to store it. In our case, we’ll store it in the database as a BLOB for simplicity, but you could just as easily store it on the filesystem or a CDN. Let’s write another migration to create a media table.  First the up migration:  guestbook-profile-2 resources migrations 20200507221422-create-media-table.up.sql CREATE TABLE media  name text PRIMARY KEY, owner text references users login  ON DELETE set null ON UPDATE CASCADE, type text NOT NULL, data bytea NOT NULL ;  and then the down migration:  guestbook-profile-2 resources migrations 20200507221422-create-media-table.down.sql DROP TABLE media;  and then run the migration:  migratus.core - Starting migrations  user=>  migrate  ...

DEBUG migratus.migration.sql - found 1 up migrations ... DEBUG migratus.database - marking 20200507221422 complete ... INFO nil user=>  migratus.core - Ending migrations  Now, we need a query to insert our files and a query to get our files:  guestbook-profile-2 resources sql queries.sql -- :name save-file! :! :n -- saves a file to the database INSERT INTO media  name, type, owner, data  VALUES  :name, :type, :owner, :data  ON CONFLICT  name  DO UPDATE SET type = :type, data = :data  WHERE media.owner = :owner -- :name get-file :? :1 -- Gets a file from the database select * from media where name = :name  Note the ON CONFLICT  name  logic. This is to ensure that files don’t get overwritten by other users.  Let’s reload our queries and test them out:  user=>  in-ns 'guestbook.db.core  object[clojure.lang.Namespace ... "guestbook.db.core"] guestbook.db.core=>  require '[clojure.java.io :as io]  nil guestbook.db.core=>  conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"  {:snips {}, :fns {...}} guestbook.db.core=>  with-open [in  io input-stream   io resource  "public img warning_clojure.png"    out  java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream. ]   io copy in out   .toByteArray out    object["[B" 0x1d42779f "[B@1d42779f"] guestbook.db.core=>  save-file! {:name "test.png"  1 guestbook.db.core=>  save-file! {:name "test.png"  :data *1 :owner "testuser" :type "image png"}   :data *2 :owner "foo" :type "image png"}   0  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   230  guestbook.db.core=>  get-file {:name "test.png"}  {:name "test.png", :owner "testuser", :type "image png", :data object["[B" 0x5586f180 "[B@5586f180"]} guestbook.db.core=>  Let’s start by adding some auth rules for media:  guestbook-profile-2 src clj guestbook auth.clj :media get {:any} :media upload {:authenticated}  Our queries are working as intended, so let’s get started on our upload and fetch endpoints.  Since we’ve just added a test image to our database, let’s create an endpoint and see if we can view it in the browser.  guestbook-profile-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj ;; require these namespaces [clojure.java.io :as io] [guestbook.db.core :as db] ;; ... [" media :name" {::auth roles  auth roles :media get  :get {:parameters  {:path {:name string?}} :handler  fn [{{{:keys [name]} :path} :parameters}]   if-let [{:keys [data type]}  db get-file {:name name} ]   ->  io input-stream data    response ok   response content-type type     response not-found   }}]  This endpoint is simply returning the data as a stream along with an appro- priate content-type header. With this, we should be able to see our test image at localhost:3000 api media test.png.  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   231  Now, we need to be able to upload images. This is done by using a POST with a content type of multipart form-data. We can instruct reitit to coerce this type of parameter with a :parameters spec that looks like this:   ns guestbook.routes.services   :require  ... [reitit.ring.middleware.multipart :as multipart]    ;;... {:multipart {:foo multipart temp-file-part  :bar multipart temp-file-part}}  This will tell the multipart-middleware to coerce our :foo and :bar form fields into maps containing their respective tempfiles. This results in a :parameters map on the request that looks like this:  {:multipart {:foo {:filename  "some-tempname.png"  :bar {:filename  :content-type "image png" :tempfile :size    778330} "bar-tempname.jpg"  :content-type "image jpg" :tempfile :size    1663227}}}  Let’s start by creating a new namespace called guestbook.media and writing a helper function that will take a single temp-file-part map and options, save the file to the database, and return its filename.   ns guestbook.media   :require  [guestbook.db.core :as db]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   232   defn insert-image-returning-name [{:keys [tempfile filename content-type]}  {:keys [owner]}]  [clojure.java.io :as io] [clojure.tools.logging :as log]    :import  [java.io ByteArrayOutputStream]     with-open [in  io input-stream tempfile  out  ByteArrayOutputStream. ]   io copy in out   if  = 0   db save-file! {:name filename  :data  .toByteArray out  :owner owner :type content-type}     do  filename      log error "Attempted to overwrite an image that you don't own!"   throw  ex-info "Attempted to overwrite an image that you don't own!"  {:name filename}     Then, let’s write an endpoint that accepts multipart params and returns a map of names to URLs where the uploaded files can be found.   ns guestbook.routes.services   :require  ;;... [guestbook.media :as media]    ;;...  defn service-routes []  [" api" ;;...  [" my-account"  [" set-profile" ;;... ] [" media upload" {::auth roles  auth roles :media upload  :post {:parameters {:multipart {:avatar multipart temp-file-part  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [avatar banner] :as mp} :multipart} :parameters  :banner multipart temp-file-part}}  {:keys [identity] :as session} :session :as req}]  response ok  {:avatar  str " api media "   media insert-image-returning-name  assoc avatar  :filename  str  :login identity   report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   233  "_avatar"    {:owner  :login identity }    :banner  str " api media "   media insert-image-returning-name  assoc banner  :filename  str  :login identity   "_banner"    {:owner  :login identity }  }  }}]]]   Now, let’s try this out from swagger:  It worked! Now we can access our avatar and banner like so:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   234  We’ve got the basics set up, but we’re just trusting the user to upload a sen- sible image, and we’re retaining the original size and format. Let’s update our insert-image-returning-name function to take more options, such as width, height, max-width, and max-height, and use them to scale our image and convert them to a standard format, image png.  guestbook-profile-2 src clj guestbook media.clj  ns guestbook.media   :require [guestbook.db.core :as db] [clojure.tools.logging :as log]   :import [java.awt.image AffineTransformOp BufferedImage]  [java.io ByteArrayOutputStream] java.awt.geom.AffineTransform javax.imageio.ImageIO     defn insert-image-returning-name [{:keys [tempfile filename]}  {:keys [width height  max-width max-height owner]}]   let [baos  ByteArrayOutputStream.   img  ImageIO read tempfile  img-width  .getWidth img  img-height  .getHeight img  ratio  cond   and  some? height   some? width    min    width img-width     height img-height    some? height     height img-height   some? width     width img-width   and  some? max-height   some? max-width    min 1    img-width max-width     img-height max-height    report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   235   some? max-height   min 1    img-height max-height    some? max-width   min 1    img-width max-width   :else 1   img-scaled  if  = 1 ratio   img  let [scale   AffineTransform getScaleInstance  double ratio   double ratio   transform-op  AffineTransformOp. scale  AffineTransformOp TYPE_BILINEAR ]   .filter transform-op  img  BufferedImage.  * ratio img-width   * ratio img-height   .getType img     ]   ImageIO write img-scaled "png" baos   if  = 0   db save-file! {:name filename  :data  .toByteArray baos  :owner owner :type "image png"}     do  filename      log error "Attempted to overwrite an image that you don't own!"   throw  ex-info "Attempted to overwrite an image that you don't own!"  {:name filename}     The code above is using java.awt.geom.AffineTransform class provided by the Java standard library to create a scale operation, and we use java.awt.image.AffineTrans- formOp to do the transformation. The filter method on the transform-op uses the original image to produce the scaled image we require.  Now, let’s update our endpoint. Let’s allow for as many files as neccessary to be uploaded in parallel, but let’s ensure that each one is under 5MiB and is indeed an image file. Additionally, let’s keep the behaviour where we generate a name for :avatar and :banner images.  guestbook-profile-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj ;;require these namespaces [guestbook.media :as media] [clojure.spec.alpha :as s] [clojure.string :as string] ;; ...

First, by using  s map-of keyword? multipart temp-file-part , we allow any number of files to be posted to this endpoint. Unfortunately, this doesn’t play well with swagger, but we’ll be able to test it from our application shortly.  Second, instead of explicitly handling :avatar and :banner, we’re using reduce-kv to  perform  our  image  saving  logic  for  each  file  in  our  multipart  parameter map.  Third, we’ve added a cond statement with several checks in place. We reject files  which  are  larger  than  5  MiB,  or  which  have  a Content-Type  that  doesn’t start with image . It is possible to add additional clauses to handle other media, such as video or audio, but we’ll leave that for now.  We are keeping our avatar and banner specific behaviour, and we’re specifying a specific size for each.  Now, let’s update our profile page to support uploading avatar and banner images.  Uploading Images From the Browser  The  first  thing  we  need  to  do  is  add  a  new  type  of  effect  to  handle  media uploads. We can’t reuse our :ajax post request, because we have to send a For- mData object in order to use multipart parameters.  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook ajax.cljs  rf reg-fx :ajax upload-media!  fn [{:keys [url success-event files handler]}]   let [form-data  js FormData. ]   doseq [[k v] files]   when  some? v    .append form-data  name k  v      POST url {:body form-data  :handler handler}      Since we’re not using an actual form submission, we have to construct a For- mData object to send. We’ll have a map, files, which will contain the files in our file re-frame components keyed by name. We then append each of these to our FormData and then finally POST it to our endpoint.  Now, let’s update our re-frame events and subscriptions.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   238  We’ll add a new top-level subscription called :profile media to track any files to be uploaded, and have :profile changed?, :profile field-changed?, and :profile field handle entries in :profile media in addition to their current behaviour. We’ll also add an event to change the :profile media map.  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  rf reg-sub :profile media  fn [db _]   get db :profile media      rf reg-sub :profile changed? :<- [:profile changes] :<- [:profile media]  fn [[changes media] _]   not  and  empty? changes   empty? media        rf reg-sub :profile field-changed? :<- [:profile changes] :<- [:profile media]  fn [[changes media] [_ k]]   or  contains? changes k   contains? media k       rf reg-sub :profile field :<- [:profile changes] :<- [:auth user] :<- [:profile media]  fn [[changes {:keys [profile]} media] [_ k default]]   or  when-let [file  get media k ]  js URL.createObjectURL file    get changes k   get profile k  default      rf reg-event-db :profile save-media  fn [db [_ k v]]   update db  :profile media  if  nil? v    dissoc % k   assoc % k v       report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   239  Note that in :profile field we’re creating a temporary URL based on the file on the client side. Since we plan on storing :avatar and :banner as image urls inside profile, this allows us to treat pending changes and existing values interchange- ably.  Next, we’ll update :profile set-profile event to optionally take a second argument with files to be uploaded, and have it upload any files specified before sending the POST request to  api my-account set-profile. We’ll keep the existing behaviour if no files need to be uploaded.  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :profile set-profile  fn [_ [_ profile files]]   if  some some?  vals files    {:ajax upload-media! {:url " api my-account media upload" :files files :handler  fn [response]  rf dispatch [:profile set-profile  merge profile   select-keys response  :files-uploaded response   ]  }}  {:ajax post {:url " api my-account set-profile" :params {:profile profile} :success-event [:profile handle-set-profile profile]}}      rf reg-event-db :profile handle-set-profile  fn [db [_ profile]]   -> db   assoc-in [:auth user :profile] profile   dissoc :profile media :profile changes      Note  that  we’re  adding  the  new  permanent  URLS  returned  in  our  AJAX response to our profile before we re-dispatch :profile set-profile.  Now that we have re-frame set up, let’s create some general components for working with images.  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook components.cljs  defn image [url width height] [:div {:style {:width width  :height height :display :flex :justify-content :center  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7.

First,  we’ve  updated  the  :on-click  function  to  pass  our :profile media map to our :profile set-profile event. Also, since our page is quite a bit longer,  we’ve  added  some  CSS  to  ensure  that  it’s  on  screen,  large,  and  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   242  prominent if there are any pending changes. This should prevent users from forgetting to save their profile changes.  Now our profile page should look something like this:  We’re able to edit our Display Name, Bio, Avatar, and Banner with ease.  However, there is a subtle bug we’ve missed with regards to our image-uploader components we need to address before we move on. To illustrate this, try the following:    Select an image to upload by clicking “Choose an Avatar…”   Click “Reset Avatar” to clear it   Select the same image to upload a second time   The image no longer shows up in our preview!  This bug comes from the fact that our [:input {:type "file"}] component can’t be controlled in the same way as display-name or bio  i.e. it is impossible to set :value . This  results  in  the  value  from  before  Reset  staying  on  our  input,  and  thus selecting the same file does not trigger our :on-change function, so the preview remains unchanged.  To fix this we need to do some extra work to ensure that our input stays in sync with our re-frame state. There are a couple ways to do this. You could have the :on-click function of the "Reset" buttons use JavaScript interop to set the value of the corresponding file inputs to "", or you could have the compo- nent re-mount when the value is cleared in various ways. We’re going to use  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   243  a simple trick with React keys to force our component to re-mount when our value is reset.  Adding a key to an element gives React an explicitly defined identifier for a component. It usually used with lists of items which may be rearranged so that React can manage changes more efficiently. However, we can use it to tell React when a component should be considered a brand new instance, and thus should be re-mounted from scratch. We can do this like so:  [:div.control  ^{:key @ rf subscribe [:profile field-changed? k] } [image-uploader  rf dispatch [:profile save-media k %]  "Choose a..."]]  Now, if our field goes into an unchanged state, it will remount, and thus have an empty value. We still have some inconsistent behaviour if the user selects the  same  image  twice  without  resetting.  However,  all  this  results  in  is  our save-fn being called a second time in this case.  We can do even better with a small trade-off. Since we are managing our file reference externally, we only need the value of our file input when save-fn is called. This means we don’t actually need to keep it synchronized and can just clear it after every change instead. Now we don’t have to change the way our image-uploader component is used across our app, we can just update it’s on-change function like so:   defn image-uploader [save-fn label-text]  [:div.file>label.file-label [:input.file-input {:type :file  :on-change  fn [e]   save-fn  -> e   -> e  .-target .-files  aget 0     .-target .-value  set! ""  }]  [:span.file-cta [:span.file-label label-text]]]   This may result in some very slight performance reduction due to repeated calls to save-fn, but in practice we don’t expect our users to repeatedly select the same image for uploading. Additionally, our first solution isn’t without  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   244  it’s  drawbacks.  Re-rendering  our  component  is  also  a  cost,  and  it  is  more likely to occur with regular use.  Now, we can go back and remove our :key from avatar and banner, and we can use image-uploader in a straightforward way in the future.  Next, let’s update our app to make use of the author profile.  Integrating the Profile Into the App  Now that we have a profile for our authors, let’s update a few things. Let’s update our posts to display an avatar image, use the current display name for new posts, and add the banner and bio to the top of the author page.  Adding Avatar to Posts  Let’s start by displaying our Avatar on posts. The first thing we’ll need to do is update our posts query and our posts by author query to do a SQL JOIN with the authors table so that we can get the avatar of the author:  guestbook-profile-2 resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-messages :? :* -- :doc selects all available messages SELECT as id, p.id as timestamp, p.timestamp as message, p.message as name, p.name as author, p.author a.profile->>'avatar' as avatar from posts as p join users as a on a.login = p.author  guestbook-profile-2 resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-messages-by-author :? :* -- :doc selects all messages posted by a user SELECT as id, p.id as timestamp, p.timestamp as message, p.message as name, p.name as author, p.author a.profile->>'avatar' as avatar from posts as p join users as a on a.login = p.author WHERE author = :author  Then,  we’ll  need  to  update  our  :responses  spec  on   api messages  and   api mes- sages by :author to account for avatar.  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   245  {200 {:body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst? :author  ds maybe string?  :avatar  ds maybe string? }]}}}  Now, we need to update our message-list. Let’s create a separate message compo- nent and use Bulma’s media component to render our post with an avatar.  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message [{:keys [timestamp message name author avatar] :as m}]  [:article.media [:figure.media-left [image  or avatar " img avatar-default.png"  128 128]] [:div.media-content>div.content [:time  .toLocaleString timestamp ] [:p message] [:p " - " name " <"  if author  [:a {:href  str " user " author }  str "@" author ] [:span.is-italic "account not found"]   ">"]]]    defn message-list [messages]  ;; Copied from guestbook.core... [:ul.messages  for [m @messages]  ^{:key  :timestamp m } [:li [message m]] ]   Since we may not always have an avatar set by the author, we’ll fall back on " img avatar-default.png".  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   246  Let’s  add  this  image   or  one  of  your  choosing   to  our  project  under resources public img avatar-default.png so that our message component will use it by default.  Now, our posts on the home page and  user :author should look like this:  Using Display Name For New Posts  Next, let’s use our author’s display name when posting messages. We could follow  the  same  approach  we  took  with  avatars,  but  instead  let’s  keep  the display name from when the post is written.  First, let’s update our guestbook.messages save-message! function like so:  guestbook-profile-2 src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn save-message! [{{:keys [display-name]} :profile  :keys [login]} message]   if-let [errors  validate-message message ]   throw  ex-info "Message is invalid"  {:guestbook error-id :validation :errors errors}     db save-message!  assoc message  :author login :name  or display-name login       Then, let’s update the spec for  api message to only accept a :message, since we’re going to get the display name from the current user:  [" message" ;;... :post {:parameters {:body {:message string?}} ;;... }]  Then, let’s update our message-schema to no longer require :name:  guestbook-profile-2 src cljc guestbook validation.cljc  ns guestbook.validation   :require  report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   247  [struct.core :as st]     def message-schema  [[:message  st required st string {:message "message must contain at least 10 characters" :validate  fn [msg]  >=  count msg  10  }]]    defn validate-message [params]   first  st validate params message-schema     Finally, let’s update our message-form component to display the current display name instead of prompting the user for one:  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message-form []  ;; Copied from guestbook.core... [:div [errors-component :server-error] [errors-component :unauthorized "Please log in before posting."] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"]  let [{:keys [login profile]} @ rf subscribe [:auth user] ]   :display-name profile login  ]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"] [errors-component :message] [textarea-input {:attrs {:name :message} :value  rf subscribe [:form field :message]  :on-save  rf dispatch [:form set-field :message %] }]]  [:input.button.is-primary {:type :submit :disabled @ rf subscribe [:form validation-errors?]  :on-click  rf dispatch [:message send!  @ rf subscribe [:form fields] ]   :value "comment"}]]   Now  we  should  be  able  to  post  messages  with  our  current  display  name seamlessly. Our homepage and  user :author pages’ message forms should look like this:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   248  Enhancing the Author Page  First, we need to fetch the author when we navigate to their page. Let’s add some re-frame events and subscriptions, and update our controllers to load our author:  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook views author.cljs  rf reg-event-fx ::fetch-author  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ login]]  {:db  assoc db  ::author nil ::loading? true   :ajax get {:url  str " api author " login   :success-event [::set-author]}}     rf reg-event-db ::set-author  fn [db [_ author]]   if author  assoc db  ::author author ::loading? false   dissoc db ::author       rf reg-sub ::author  fn [db _]   get db ::author      rf reg-sub ::is-current-author? :<- [:auth user] :<- [::author]  fn [[user author] _]   rf reg-sub ::loading?   =  :login user   :login author      report erratum     discuss   Account Customization   249   fn [db _]   ::loading? db      def author-controllers  [{:parameters {:path [:user]}  :start  fn [{{:keys [user]} :path}]   rf dispatch [:messages load-by-author user]  }  {:parameters {:path [:user]} :start  fn [{{:keys [user]} :path}]   rf dispatch [::fetch-author user]    :stop   fn [_]  rf dispatch [::set-author nil]  }]   Then, let’s update the author page like so:  guestbook-profile-2 src cljs guestbook views author.cljs  defn banner-component [url]  [:figure.image {:style {:width "100%" :height "10vw" :overflow "hidden" :margin-left 0 :margin-right 0}}  [:img {:src url}]]    defn title []   if @ rf subscribe [::is-current-author?]   [:div.level [:h2.level-left "My Author Page"] [:a.level-right {:href  rtfe href :guestbook.routes.app profile } "Edit Page"]]   let [{:keys [display-name login]} @ rf subscribe [::author] ]  [:h2 display-name "  's Page"]     defn author [{{{:keys [user]} :path} :parameters}]   let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list]   author  rf subscribe [::author] ]   fn [{{{:keys [user]} :path} :parameters}]   if @ rf subscribe [::loading?]   [:div.content [:div {:style {:width "100%"}} [:progress.progress.is-dark {:max 100} "30%"]]]   let [{{:keys [display-name banner bio]} :profile} @author]  [:div.content [banner-component  or banner " img banner-default.png" ] [title]  when bio  [:p bio]   [:div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds [:div.columns>div.column [:h3 "Posts by " display-name "  "]  if @ rf subscribe [:messages loading?]   [messages message-list-placeholder] [messages message-list messages] ]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   250   when @ rf subscribe [::is-current-author?]   [:div.columns>div.column [:h4 "New Post"] [messages message-form]] ]]       We’ve created banner-component to render our banner as a wide image at the top of our page, and title to render a title bar. Then, we’ve updated our author page in a few ways. Since we depend on ::author being loaded, we’ve added a loading bar if ::loading? is true. Then, we’ve added our banner-component, title, and a :p tag with our author bio if it exists. Finally, we’ve added a message-form to the bottom if the author is the logged in user.  Our author page should now look like this:  Great! We’ve got profiles leveraged across our app, so now users can customize their identity on our site.  Account Settings  Now that we’ve learned how to modify the profile, we should add some features for  managing  accounts.  Let’s  enable  users  to  change  their  passwords  and delete their accounts.  Change Password  The first thing we need to do is write a SQL query to change the password, along with a function to call it.  guestbook-account resources sql queries.sql -- :name set-password-for-user!* :! :n UPDATE users SET password = :password where login = :login  report erratum     discuss   Account Settings   251  guestbook-account src clj guestbook auth.clj  defn change-password! [login old-password new-password]   jdbc with-transaction [t-conn db *db*]   let [{hashed :password}  db get-user-for-auth* t-conn {:login login} ]   if  hashers check old-password hashed    db set-password-for-user!* t-conn {:login login :password  hashers derive new-password }   throw  ex-info "Old password must match!"  {:guestbook error-id ::authentication-failure :error "Passwords do not match!"}        Our change-password! function opens a database transaction, authenticates the old password, then hashes and sets the new password. It will throw an error if the password check fails.  Then, we need to create a service endpoint that calls our function. We’ll reuse our :account set-profile! role for now.  guestbook-account src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" change-password" {::auth roles  auth roles :account set-profile!  :post {:parameters  {:body {:old-password :new-password :confirm-password string?}}  string? string?  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [old-password new-password confirm-password]} :body} :parameters :session}]  {:keys [identity]}   if  not= new-password confirm-password   response bad-request {:error :mismatch :message "Password and Confirm fields must match!"}    try   auth change-password!  :login identity   old-password new-password    response ok {:success true}   catch clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo e   if  =  :guestbook error-id  ex-data e    ::auth authentication-failure    response unauthorized {:error :incorrect-password :message "Old Password is incorrect, please try again."}    throw e      }}]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   252  ;;... ]  This endpoint checks that the new password and confirmation match, then calls change-password!. If there is a mismatch or an authentication error, it will reply with an helpful 4xx response.  Now we’ll move to the client and write a component for our profile page to allow  users  to  change  their  passwords.  Since  we’re  dealing  with  sensitive information,  we’ll  keep  everything  in  a  local  atom  to  prevent  stale  data  or accidental  leaking.  This  means  our  component  will  be  quite  large,  so  we’ll use letfn to keep it readable.  Here’s the general structure of the component:  guestbook-account src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs ;; require [ajax.core :as ajax] ;; ...  defn change-password []   let [fields  r atom {}  errors  r atom {}  success  r atom {} ]   letfn [ password-field [id label]  ;;helper component     change-password! [] ;;helper function  ]   fn [] [:  [:h3 "Change Password"] [password-field :old-password "Current Password"] [password-field :new-password "New Password"] [password-field :confirm-password "New Password  confirm "] [:div.field  when-let [message  :server @errors ]  [:p.message.is-danger message]    when-let [message  :message @success ]  [:p.message.is-success message]   [:button.button {:on-click  fn [_]   change-password!  } "Change Password"]]]      Now,  we  have  to  fill  in  our  password-field  component  and  our  change-password! function.  First, let’s write our password-field:  report erratum     discuss   Account Settings   253  guestbook-account src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  password-field [id label]   r with-let [v  r cursor fields [id]  e  r cursor errors [id] ]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for id} label] [:input.input {:id id  :type :password :value @v :on-change  reset! v  .. % -target -value  }]   when-let [message @e]  [:p.help.is-danger message] ]    It’s fairly straightforward. It’s just a label, a password input which is bound to a key on our fields atom, and an error message from the same key on our errors atom. Next, let’s write our change-password! function:  guestbook-account src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  change-password! []   let [{:keys [new-password  confirm-password]  :as params} @fields]   if  not= new-password confirm-password    reset! errors  {:new-password :confirm-password "New Password and Confirm must match!"}   "New Password and Confirm must match!"   ajax POST " api my-account change-password"  {:params params :handler  fn [_]   swap! success   fn [{:keys  [timeout]}]   when timeout  ;; Display success message for 5 seconds   js clearTimeout timeout    {:message "Password change successful!" :timeout  js setTimeout   fn []  5000 }     reset! success {}     reset! fields {}   reset! errors {}    :error-handler  fn [{r :response}]   println r   reset! errors  case  :error r   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   254  :incorrect-password {:old-password  :message r } :mismatch {:new-password  :message r  :confirm-password  :message r }  ;; ELSE  {:server "Unknown Server Error. Please try again!"}   }      The change-password! function is a bit longer, but it’s fairly straightforward. It validates our fields atom, sends a POST request, and processes the response. If there’s an issue, it will set the errors atom accordingly. If the password is changed successfully, it will clear our fields and errors, and will set our success message for 5 seconds.  Now, we just have to add an account settings section to our profile page, and include our change-password component:  guestbook-account src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  defn account-settings []  [:  [:h2 "Account Settings"] [change-password]]    defn profile [_]   if-let [{:keys [login created_at]} @ rf subscribe [:auth user] ]   " ]  [:div.content [:h1 "My Account"  str " [:p  str "Joined: "  .toString created_at  ] [:h2 "My Profile"] [display-name] [bio] [avatar] [banner]  let [disabled?  not @ rf subscribe [:profile changed?]  ]  [:button.button.is-primary.is-large {:style {:width "100%"  :position :sticky :bottom 10 :visibility  if disabled?  :hidden :visible }  :on-click  rf dispatch [:profile set-profile  @ rf subscribe [:profile profile]  @ rf subscribe [:profile media] ]   :disabled disabled?} "Update Profile"]   report erratum     discuss   Account Settings   255  [account-settings]] [:div.content [:div {:style {:width "100%"}} [:progress.progress.is-dark {:max 100} "30%"]]]    Our profile page should now look like this:  Next, let’s add the option to delete the account.  Delete Account  Just like with changing passwords we’ll start with a query:  guestbook-account resources sql queries.sql -- :name delete-user!* :! :n DELETE FROM users where login = :login  and a wrapper function to handle authentication:  guestbook-account src clj guestbook auth.clj  defn delete-account! [login password]   jdbc with-transaction [t-conn db *db*]   if  hashers check password hashed    db delete-user!* t-conn {:login login}   throw  ex-info "Password is incorrect!"   let [{hashed :password}  db get-user-for-auth* t-conn {:login login} ]  {:guestbook error-id ::authentication-failure :error "Password is incorrect!"}        Then, we’ll write a service endpoint to call this function from the client:  guestbook-account src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" my-account" [" delete-account" {::auth roles  auth roles :account set-profile!  :post  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   256  {:parameters {:body {:login string?  :password string?}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [login password]} :body} :parameters  {{user :login} :identity} :session :as req}]   if  not= login user    response bad-request {:message "Login must match the current user!"}   try   auth delete-account! user password   ->  response ok    assoc :session   select-keys  :session req  [:ring.middleware.anti-forgery anti-forgery-token]      catch clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo e   if  =  :guestbook error-id  ex-data e    ::auth authentication-failure    response unauthorized {:error :incorrect-password :message "Password is incorrect, please try again!"}    throw e      }}]  ;;... ]  Now  we’re  ready  to  start  writing  our  client-side  code.  Let’s  use  a  modal  to handle account deletion. We can reuse our modal-button component, but let’s refactor it first to allow us to change the button styling. Let’s update our modal- button to accept an opts map so that we can add the is-danger class to our button for account deletion:  guestbook-account src cljs guestbook modals.cljs  defn modal-button   [id title body footer] [modal-button id {:button {:class ["is-primary"]}} title body footer]   [id opts title body footer] [:div [:button.button  merge  :button opts   {:on-click  rf dispatch [:app show-modal id] }   title] [modal-card id title body footer]]    We’ve kept the original 4-arity form so that our existing code still works, but we’ve added a 5-arity version that handles the optional opts map. The only key on our opts map that is used is :button, but we can easily add additional keys to this map in the future.  report erratum     discuss   Now let’s write our delete account component using our updated modal-button.

Our modal body has an error message at the top, and then our login and password fields bound to our fields atom. Our modal footer has a "Cancel" button, and a "Delete Account" button. The majority of our logic is inside the :on-click function of our "Delete Account" button. We start by ensuring that our login field is correct, then we set our :loading flag in our status atom and  send  our POST  request.  If  we  successfully  delete  the  account,  we  clear everything, close the modal, and redirect to the homepage. If we encounter an error, we clear our :loading flag and set our :error message. Finally, let’s add our delete-account component to our account-settings and see how it looks:  guestbook-account src cljs guestbook views profile.cljs  defn account-settings []  [:  [:h2 "Account Settings"] [change-password] [delete-account  :login @ rf subscribe [:auth user]  ]]   Now, our page should look like this:  report erratum     discuss   Account Settings   259  And our modal should look like this:  Now our users are able to effectively manage their accounts and preferences. In  the  future,  we  could  add  many  things  to  our  account  profiles,  such  as location,  birth  date,  theming  preferences,  account  visibilty,  privacy  etc.  It would follow the same pattern we’ve used here and it would just be a matter of updating the app to respond to these options.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 7. Account Management   260  What You’ve Learned  The primary goal of this chapter was to introduce all aspects of creating an SPA. We created multiple independent pages that share a common foundation and established a pattern for adding more as needed. This includes creating shared routing between client and server, front-end page management, and protocol-agnostic authorization.  Meanwhile, we’ve covered media management tasks such as image manipu- lation with Java interop, file uploads, and file storage as BLOBs. Additionally, we leveraged Postgres’s JSONB data type to create an easily extensible author profile. This allows us to iterate rapidly without having to repeatedly modify our  database  tables.  It  also  maps  very  well  onto  the  Clojure  philosophy  of additive enhancement via associative data structures.  Now that we have some real experience with the ins and outs of working with a Clojure Script  SPA, we’re ready to add some more sophisticated features. In the next chapter, we’ll add some richer pages including a user feed and we’ll add some features to posts.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 8  Social Interaction  Currently we have an app where users are able to generate content. However, there aren’t any meaningful ways to engage with eachother. In this chapter we’ll enhance posts to allow for richer content such as images. We’ll add tags and mentions to enrich post metadata. We’ll add the ability to boost posts and reply to posts. Finally, we’ll add the ability to follow users and subscribe to tags with a personalized feed.  Improving Posts  At this point our posts are pretty spartan, even though they are the reason people will use our app. Let’s add richer interactions and features to posts. To start, let’s create a new page for viewing an individual post. Once we have a dedicated page, we’ll be able to build on it. Also, we can start by adding features to the post page, and then adapt it to the smaller form factor of the post list.  First, we need a query.  guestbook-post-page resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-message :? :1 -- :doc selects a message SELECT as id, p.id as timestamp, p.timestamp as message, p.message as name, p.name as author, p.author a.profile->>'avatar' as avatar from posts as p join users as a on a.login = p.author where p.id = :id  Then, we need a wrapper to handle params.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   262  guestbook-post-page src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn get-message [post-id]   db get-message {:id post-id}    Then, before we can write a service endpoint, we need to add a new entry to guestbook.auth roles.   def roles {;; ... :message get {:any}}   Now we can write an endpoint to get our single messsage. Since we have a handler under POST " api message" already, we’ll have to move things around.  guestbook-post-page src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" message" [" :post-id" {::auth roles  auth roles :message get  :get {:parameters  {:path {:post-id pos-int?}} :responses {200 {:message map?} ;; e.g. author has blocked you or has private account 403 {:message string?} 404 {:message string?} 500 {:message string?}} :handler  fn [{{{:keys [post-id]} :path} :parameters}]   if-some [post  msg get-message post-id ]   response ok {:message post}   response not-found {:message "Post Not Found"}   }}]  ["" {::auth roles  auth roles :message create!  :post { ;; Move save-message! handler here }}]  Notice that we have moved the map that was under [" message" ] into another vector like so:  [" message" ["" {}]]  This way, we can add additional matchers under " api message" without affecting our initial POST " api message" handler.  Let’s try our new endpoint out in Swagger UI:  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   263  Looks good.  Now let’s write our post page.  guestbook-post-page src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  ns guestbook.views.post   :require [re-frame.core :as rf] [reagent.core :as r] [cljs.pprint :refer [pprint]] [guestbook.messages :as msg]     defn clear-post-keys [db]   dissoc db ::error ::post     rf reg-event-fx ::fetch-post  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ post-id]]  {:db  clear-post-keys db  :ajax get {:url  str " api message " post-id   :success-path [:message] :success-event [::set-post] :error-event [::set-post-error]}}     rf reg-event-db  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8.

Then we have our post component that renders the happy case, for now this is just a wrapper around guestbook.messages message. Finally, we have our post-page at the top level handling errors and loading.  Now, let’s add our post page to our app routes.  guestbook-post-page src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc ;; require [guestbook.views.post :as post] ;; inside ?& :cljs [...]  [" post :post"  merge {:name ::post} ? :cljs {:parameters {:path {:post pos-int?}}  :controllers post post-controllers :view 'post post-page}  ]  Now we can visit a post by id if we type it into the URL manually.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   266  Looks good.  Next, let’s update the messages in the message-list component to link to this page, along with a way to return to our place in the timeline.  Let’s just add a link to our message component:   defn message [{:keys [id timestamp message name author avatar] :as m}]  [:article.media  ;;... [:p>a {:href  str " post " id }] ;;... ]   and a back button to our post page:   defn post [{:keys [timestamp message name author avatar] :as m}]  [:div.content  [:button.button.is-info.is-outlined.is-fullwidth  {:on-click  .back js window.history } "Back to Feed"]  ;;... ]   This works for now, but could be very frustrating for users when there are a lot of posts since they’ll lose their place. Let’s add some functionality to ensure that we go back to the post we expanded if we go back in history.  The first thing we’ll need to do is add a way for any page that renders a message- list to scroll to a specific post:  guestbook-post-page src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn msg-li [m message-id]   r create-class {:component-did-mount  fn [this]   when  = message-id  :id m     .scrollIntoView  dom dom-node this      :reagent-render  fn [_] [:li [message m]] }     defn message-list   [messages] [message-list messages nil]   [messages message-id] [:ul.messages  for [m @messages]  ^{:key  :timestamp m } [msg-li m message-id] ]    report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   267  Now, if we pass a message-id to message-list, any message that matches the id will be scrolled into vision. Let’s update our author and home pages to pass this id in from their query parameters.  First adding the query parameter to our app-routes declaration:  guestbook-post-page src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc ;; require [spec-tools.data-spec :as ds] [" "  merge {:name ::home} ? :cljs  {:parameters {:query { ds opt :post  pos-int?}} :controllers home home-controllers :view 'home home}  ]  ;;... [" user :user"  merge {:name ::author} ? :cljs {:parameters {:query { ds opt :post  pos-int?}  :path {:user string?}}  :controllers author author-controllers :view 'author author}  ]  guestbook-post-page src cljs guestbook views home.cljs  defn home [{{{post :post} :query} :parameters}]  [messages message-list messages post] ;;...   guestbook-post-page src cljs guestbook views author.cljs  defn author [{{{:keys [user]} :path  {:keys [post]} :query} :parameters}]  ;;...  ;;...  [messages message-list messages post] ;;...   then passing it into message-list from their respective view components:  Now we can trigger this behaviour manually by adding a query parameter to the URL like so:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   268  We still have a problem though. We don’t have that id in our browser history, and there’s no easy way for the post page to know which page linked to it. Let’s solve  this  by  adding  some  logic  to  our  view post  link  that  will  modify  our browser history to include the :post query parameter in the URL.  guestbook-post-page src cljs guestbook messages.cljs ;; require [reitit.frontend.easy :as rtfe] [:p>a {:on-click  fn [_]   let [{{:keys [name]} :data  {:keys [path query]} :parameters} @ rf subscribe [:router current-route] ]   rtfe replace-state name path  assoc query :post id     rtfe push-state :guestbook.routes.app post {:post id}  }  "View Post"]  Instead of using an :href on our anchor tag, we’re using an :on-click that uses the history API functions provided by reitit.frontend.easy. This will change our current URL in the history to include the post-id in the query parameters. So, if we click the back button, we will scroll to the post we clicked on! We don’t even need to change our button on the post page, since the URL in his- tory is all we need.  Now we have the basic structure for working with posts in place. Let’s add some features.  Post Types  Right now, we can only post text. This is fine, but it would be nice if we were able to post different types of media, such as images, videos, audio, links, or articles. Let’s update our posts table to allow for multiple types of posts, and let’s implement three of them: text, articles  markdown , and images.  All of these can be special cases of markdown, so let’s do that first.  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   269  We’ll  use  the  markdown-clj  library1  to  parse  markdown  posts.  Let’s  start  by ensuring it is included in project.clj before we get started.  [markdown-clj "1.10.5"]  A very important consideration here is that this library will return raw HTML, so we’ll have to ensure that we properly sanitize user input. Also, we’ll have to use :dangerouslySetInnerHTML for these posts. This should be avoided in most cases, but it is an important escape hatch for cases where you need to render pre-defined markup.  Let’s start by writing a general purpose component for rendering markdown strings safely in guestbook.components:  guestbook-post-md src cljs guestbook components.cljs  defn escape-html  "Change special characters into HTML character entities." [text state]  if  or  :code state   :codeblock state    [text state] ;; Don't escape code blocks! [ string escape text {\& "&amp;" \< "&lt;" \> "&gt;" \" "&quot;" \' "&39;"}   state]     def transformers   into [escape-html] transformer-vector     defn parse-message [message]   md->html message :replacement-transformers transformers     defn md   [content] [md :p {} content]   [tag content] [md tag {} content]   [tag attrs content] [tag  -> attrs   assoc :dangerouslySetInnerHTML  {:__html  parse-message content }    update :class  fnil conj []  "markdown"  ]    Here, we’re adding an escape-html transformer to the front of our :replacement- transformers so that before markdown-clj does any parsing we’ve sanitized any user provided HTML.  1.  https:  github.com yogthos markdown-clj  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   270  Next, let’s update our message component to use our md component instead of just a :p tag:  guestbook-post-md src cljs guestbook messages.cljs ;; Update `:require` to include: ;; [guestbook.components :refer [text-input textarea-input image md]]  defn message   [m] [message m {}]   [{:keys [id timestamp message name author avatar] :as m}  {:keys [include-link?] :or {include-link? true}}]  [:article.media [:figure.media-left [image  or avatar " img avatar-default.png"  128 128]] [:div.media-content>div.content [:time  .toLocaleString timestamp ] [md message]  when include-link? [:p>a {:on-click   fn [_]   let [{{:keys [name]} :data  {:keys [path query]} :parameters} @ rf subscribe [:router current-route] ]   rtfe replace-state name path  assoc query :post id     rtfe push-state :guestbook.routes.app post {:post id}  }  "View Post"]   [:p " - " name " <"  if author  ">"]]]    [:a {:href  str " user " author }  str "@" author ] [:span.is-italic "account not found"]   Let’s try writing a simple markdown post:  Now  users  can  write  arbitrary  markdown  in  their  posts  and  it  will  render properly. They can even include images, links, and blockquotes.  Before we move on, let’s add transformers for mentions and tags as well. We’ll leave the server-side processing for later, but we can insert the links while we’re here.  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   271  guestbook-post-md src cljs guestbook components.cljs  defn linkify-tags  "Change tags into links" [text state]  if  or  :code state   :codeblock state    [text state] [ string replace  text _" ?<=\s^  [-\w]+  ?=\s$ " " \s^  [-\w]+  ?=\s$ " "$1<a href=\" tag $2\"  title=\"View posts tagged $2\" target=\"_blank\"> $2  "  state]     defn linkify-mentions  "Change mentions into links" [text state]  if  or  :code state   :codeblock state    [text state] [ string replace  text _"@ [-\w]+  ?=\s$ " " \s^ @ [-\w]+  ?=\s$ " "$1<a href=\" user $2\"  title=\"Homepage of @$2\" target=\"_blank\"> @$2  "  state]     def transformers   into [escape-html linkify-tags linkify-mentions] transformer-vector    These  transformers  are  doing  very  similar  things.  They’re  both  looking  for strings starting with a special character with whitespace on either side and replacing them with HTML anchors based on their capture group. Following common conventions, our tags begin with  and our mentions begin with @. Notice that we’re inserting them after the escape-html transformer so that our returned HTML isn’t getting escaped.  Great, now we’re able to have links to user pages, as well as not yet imple- mented tag pages. Next, let’s improve our message-form component so that users can leverage these new features.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   272  Post Composition  Markdown  can  represent  pretty  much  every  type  of  post,  but  we  need  to enhance how users compose this markdown to ensure that they are able to easily create rich posts leveraging markdown’s full feature set.  Post Preview  With most markdown editors online, users expect a preview before they submit a post, so let’s add that. Let’s create a post-preview component, and add it to our message form:  guestbook-post-md src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message-preview [m]   r with-let [expanded  r atom false ]  [:  [:button.button.is-secondary.is-fullwidth {:on-click  swap! expanded not }  if @expanded  "Hide Preview" "Show Preview" ]   when @expanded [:ul.messages {:style {:margin-left 0}} [:li [message m {:include-link? false}]]] ]     defn message-form []  [:div.card [:div.card-header>p.card-header-title "Post Something!"]  let [{:keys [login profile]} @ rf subscribe [:auth user]   display-name  :display-name profile login ]  [:div.card-content [message-preview {:message @ rf subscribe [:form field :message]   :id -1 :timestamp  js Date.  :name display-name :author login :avatar  :avatar profile }]  [errors-component :server-error] [errors-component :unauthorized "Please log in before posting."] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"] display-name] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"] [errors-component :message]  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   273  [textarea-input {:attrs {:name :message} :value  rf subscribe [:form field :message]  :on-save  rf dispatch [:form set-field :message %] }]]  [:input.button.is-primary.is-fullwidth {:type :submit :disabled @ rf subscribe [:form validation-errors?]  :on-click  rf dispatch [:message send!  @ rf subscribe [:form fields] ]   :value "comment"}]] ]   Now let’s try it out.  It’s showing up, but only when we blur the field  e.g. when we first click the “Show Preview” button . Ideally, we should have the preview update as we type if we have it expanded. To do this, we’ll add a call to on-save inside of our :on-change  event  handler.  However,  we  don’t  want  to  overload  our  re-frame event queue. Even though our current app could handle rapid-fire save events, it is unneccessary and could cause performance issues as our app gets larger. To mitigate this, we’ll debounce this call to on-save. Also, since different uses of  our textarea-input  may  require  more  or  less  frequent  saves,  we’ll  allow  the timeout to be parametrized.  First, let’s update our textarea-input component like so:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   274  guestbook-post-md src cljs guestbook components.cljs ;; require [goog.functions :as gf]  defn textarea-input [{val :value attrs :attrs ms :keys [on-save]}]  :save-timeout   let [draft  r atom nil   value  r track  or @draft @val ""   save-on-change  if ms   gf debounce on-save ms   fn [& _]  ]   fn []  [:textarea.textarea  merge attrs  {:on-focus  reset! draft  or @val ""   :on-blur  fn []   on-save  or @draft ""    reset! draft nil    :on-change  fn [e]   let [v  .. e -target -value ]   reset! draft v   save-on-change v     :value @value} ]     Then, let’s update our message-form’s textarea-input to provide a :save-timeout to use this new feature:  guestbook-post-md src cljs guestbook messages.cljs [textarea-input {:attrs {:name :message} ;; Add save-timeout to refresh preview after 1s without edits :save-timeout 1000 :value  rf subscribe [:form field :message]  :on-save  rf dispatch [:form set-field :message %] }]]  That should do it. Let’s test it out in the browser.  Great! If we’re actively typing it won’t try to save, but if we pause for a second it will render the preview for us while we contemplate what to write next.  Multimedia Uploads  At this point, users can manually type in image URLs and they’ll show up in their markdown posts. However, we’d like to allow users to upload media as they’re composing a post. Let’s add a button to insert an image our post’s markdown.  First, let’s add some events for inserting the image markdown at the end of the post’s message and keeping track of our files and URLs.  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   275  guestbook-post-media src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-db :message save-media  fn [db [_ img]]   let [url  js URL.createObjectURL img   name  keyword  str "msg-"  random-uuid   ]   -> db   update-in [:form fields :message] str "![] " url " "   update :message media  fnil assoc {}  name img   update :message urls  fnil assoc {}  url name       Then let’s add a form control to our message-form to dispatch our event:   dissoc db :message media :message urls      rf reg-event-db :message clear-media  fn [db _]   rf reg-sub :message media  fn [db [_]]   :message media db     guestbook-post-media src cljs guestbook messages.cljs ;;...

Try  uploading  a  few  images,  as  well  as manually including a link to an exernal image.  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   277  Great! It works as expected. Now users can post media, and they can arrange their posts however they see fit with standard markdown.  Now that we have rich posts, let’s improve our post interaction and aggregation features.  Boosting Posts  Let’s add the most basic form of interaction, a boost. This is equivalent to a re-post. It should push the post to the top of the global timeline, and it should add the post to the re-poster’s author page.  We’ll need to do a few things to accomplish this.  First, we need a table for boosts. Then, we need to update our posts queries to use this boosts table. Then we need to add a way for users to boost posts from the UI.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   278  Let’s start by adding a boosts table:  user=>  create-migration "add-boosts-table"   and add the follwing up migration:  guestbook-boosts resources migrations 20200822195958-add-boosts-table.up.sql CREATE TABLE boosts  user_id text not null references users login  ON DELETE cascade ON UPDATE cascade, post_id integer not null references posts id  ON DELETE cascade ON UPDATE cascade, ON DELETE set null ON UPDATE cascade,  text references users login   poster  timestamp TIMESTAMP not null DEFAULT now  , PRIMARY KEY user_id, post_id  ;  Don’t forget the down migration as well:  guestbook-boosts resources migrations 20200822195958-add-boosts-table.down.sql DROP TABLE IF EXISTS boosts;  In our boosts table, we have four columns: user_id, post_id, poster, and timestamp. The primary key  user_id, post_id  means that a user can only boost a post once. The  poster  column  is  the  person  who  the  user  got  the  post  from   i.e.  the nearest booster , not to be confused with the author. This column allows us to treat boosts as linked lists in one direction, and trees in the other. We can see the way in which a post was disseminated through a network by tracing the poster through the boosts back to the original post.  Now that we have this table, let’s write some SQL for interacting with it. Let’s start with inserting a boost, and selecting all boosts for a post:  guestbook-boosts resources sql queries.sql -- :name boost-post! :! :n -- Boosts a post, or moves a boost to the top of the user's timeline INSERT INTO boosts  user_id, post_id, poster  VALUES  :user, :post, nullif :poster, :user   ON CONFLICT  user_id, post_id  DO UPDATE SET timestamp = now   WHERE boosts.user_id = :user AND boosts.post_id = :post -- :name boosters-of-post :? :* -- Get all boosters of a post SELECT user_id as user from boosts where post_id = :post  For our INSERT statement, we have an ON CONFLICT clause that will refresh the boost if it already exists. This allows users to signal boost content at a later  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   279  date without flooding the timeline with duplicates. It also ensures that poster never  equals  user.  Our  select  is  fairly  straightforward,  but  we’ll  likely  use more sophisticated queries in most cases.  Next, let’s use the poster column in recursive queries to get our trees and linked lists described above:  guestbook-boosts resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-reboosts :? :* -- Gets all boosts descended from a given boost WITH RECURSIVE reboosts AS  WITH post_boosts AS  SELECT user_id, poster FROM boosts WHERE post_id = :post  SELECT user_id, poster FROM post_boosts where user_id = :user UNION SELECT b.user_id, b.poster FROM post_boosts b INNER JOIN reboosts r ON r.user_id = b.poster  select user_id as user, poster as source from reboosts -- :name get-boost-chain :? :* -- Gets all boosts above the original boost WITH RECURSIVE reboosts AS  WITH post_boosts AS  SELECT user_id, poster FROM boosts WHERE post_id = :post  SELECT user_id, poster FROM post_boosts where user_id = :user UNION SELECT b.user_id, b.poster FROM post_boosts b INNER JOIN reboosts r ON r.poster = b.user_id  select user_id as user, poster as source from reboosts  Our first query, get-reboosts, gets the subtree with root of  :user, :post . We first select  the  boost  with   :user, :post ,  then  we  recursively  select  boosts  where booster  is  in  the  set  of user_ids  from  our  current  selection  until  there  are  no additional boosts to select.  Our second query, get-boost-chain, does the inverse. It recursively walks up the tree, returning the path from  :user, :boost  up to the original post.  Now we have a boost table, but we haven’t connected it to any of our post queries. Since the usual pattern will be to select a bunch of data with the  report erratum     discuss   same  structure,  but  filtered  in  various  ways,  let’s  create  a  view  to  avoid unneccessary duplication of SQL, and complex nesting of SELECT statements.  Chapter 8. Social Interaction   280  We’ll write another migration to do so:  user=>  create-migration "add-posts-with-meta-view"   and add the follwing up migration:  as p as a on a.login = p.author  guestbook-boosts resources migrations 20200822203854-add-posts-with-meta-view.up.sql CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW posts_with_meta AS SELECT as id, p.id as timestamp, p.timestamp as message, p.message as name, p.name as author, p.author a.profile->>'avatar' as avatar, as boosts count b.user_id  from posts left join users left join boosts as b on p.id = b.post_id group by p.id, a.login --;; CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW posts_and_boosts AS select p.id p.timestamp p.message p.name p.author p.avatar p.boosts b.post_id is not null coalesce b.timestamp, p.timestamp  coalesce b.user_id, p.author  coalesce u.profile->>'avatar', p.avatar  as poster_avatar, coalesce b.poster, p.author  coalesce s.profile->>'avatar', p.avatar  as source_avatar from posts_with_meta as p left join boosts left join users left join users  as id, as timestamp, as message, as name, as author, as avatar, as boosts, as is_boost, as posted_at, as poster,  as b on b.post_id = p.id as u on b.user_id = u.login as s on b.poster = s.login  as source,  Don’t forget the down migration as well:  guestbook-boosts resources migrations 20200822203854-add-posts-with-meta-view.down.sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS posts_and_boosts --;; DROP VIEW IF EXISTS posts_with_meta  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   281  Note that we have two SQL statements in our migration, so we’ve added --;; to tell migratus to run them separately. Our first view, posts_with_meta is essentially the SELECT statement we were using from  our  get-messages,  get-message,  and  get-mesasges-by-author  queries  with  an additional  column boosts  added.  This  additional  column  simply  counts  the number of times the post has been boosted.  Our second view, posts_and_boosts, contains each post, and each boost with its post’s data joined on. This will allow us to get a timeline of posts and boosts.  Let’s update our existing queries to use posts_with_meta, and then let’s add some new timeline queries:  guestbook-boosts resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-messages :? :* -- :doc selects all available messages SELECT * from posts_with_meta -- :name get-message :? :1 -- :doc selects a message SELECT * from posts_with_meta where id = :id -- :name get-messages-by-author :? :* -- :doc selects all messages posted by a user SELECT * from posts_with_meta WHERE author = :author  That cut out a bunch of duplication. It’s much nicer now.  Now, let’s write our timeline queries:  guestbook-boosts resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-timeline :? :* -- Gets the latest post or boost for each post select * from  select distinct on  p.id  * from posts_and_boosts as p order by p.id, p.posted_at desc  as t order by t.posted_at asc  -- :name get-timeline-for-poster :? :* -- Gets the latest post or boost for each post select * from  select distinct on  p.id  * from posts_and_boosts as p where p.poster = :poster order by p.id, p.posted_at desc  as t order by t.posted_at asc -- :name get-timeline-post :? :1 -- Gets the boosted post for updating timelines select * from posts_and_boosts  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   282  where is_boost = :is_boost and poster = :user and id = :post order by posted_at asc limit 1  Our first query, get-timeline, is the most basic form for the timeline version of the queries above. Since we have posts and boosts in our view, we have to use select distinct in order to remove posts with duplicate ids. using order by p.id, p.posted_at  in  our select distinct  means  we’ll  get  the  latest  boost  for  each  post. Finally, our outer select returns the posts in descending chronological order based on the date of their latest boost.  Our second query, get-timeline-for-poster, does the same thing, but it filters our select distinct by :poster. This means that it’ll get the latest boost by our :poster even if it isn’t the most recent.  Our third query, get-boosted-post, gets an individual boosted post so that a user’s feed can broadcast changes.  Now that we have our neccessary tables and queries, let’s make them available from our API.  First, let’s wrap them from our guestbook.messages namespace:  guestbook-boosts src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn boost-message [{{:keys [display-name]} :profile :keys [login]} post-id poster]   conman with-transaction [db *db*]   db boost-post! db *db* {:post post-id :poster poster :user login}    db get-timeline-post db *db* {:post post-id  :user login :is_boost true}     guestbook-boosts src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn timeline []  {:messages  vec  db get-timeline  }    defn timeline-for-poster [poster]  {:messages  vec  db get-timeline-for-poster {:poster poster}  }   Then, let’s start by adding boost-message to our websocket. First, we have to add an event-id to our auth map:   ns guestbook.auth  ;;...  def roles  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   283  {:message boost! {:authenticated} ;;... }   Then we need to add an event handler to our websocket.  guestbook-boosts src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defmethod handle-message :message boost!  [{:keys [?data uid session] :as message}]  let [response  try   msg boost-message  :identity session    :id ?data   :poster ?data     catch Exception e  {:errors {:server-error ["Failed to boost message!"]}}  ]   if  :errors response    do   do   log debug "Failed to boost message: " ?data  response    doseq [uid  :any @ :connected-uids socket  ]   send! uid [:message add response]    {:success true}      Finally, for the sake of testing, let’s add an endpoint for boosting via AJAX as well.  guestbook-boosts src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" message" [" :post-id" {:parameters {:path {:post-id pos-int?}}}  ["" ;;... ] [" boost" {::auth roles  auth roles :message boost!  :post {:parameters {:body {:poster  ds maybe string? }}  :responses {200 {:body map?} 400 {:message string?}} :handler  fn [{{{:keys [post-id]} :path  {:keys [poster]} :body} :parameters {:keys [identity]} :session}]   try   let [post  msg boost-message identity post-id poster ]   response ok {:status :ok  :post post}    report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   284   catch Exception e   response bad-request {:message  str "Could not boost message: " post-id " as "  :login identity  }    }}]]  Note that we’ve pulled out our :parameters spec map from our get-message end- point   e.g.  GET " api message 11"   so  that  it  can  be  shared  by  boost   e.g.  POST " api message 11 boost"  as well. Next,  let’s  update  our  " api messages"  and  " api messages by :author"  to  use  our timeline queries, but also accept a query parameter in case we wish to only list original posts.  guestbook-boosts src clj guestbook routes services.clj [" messages" {::auth roles  auth roles :messages list  :parameters {:query { ds opt :boosts  boolean?}}} ["" {:get  {:responses {200 {:body ;; Data Spec for response body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst? :author  ds maybe string?  :avatar  ds maybe string? }]}}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [boosts]  :or {boosts true}} :query} :parameters}]   response ok  if boosts   msg timeline   msg message-list    }}]  [" by :author" {:get {:parameters {:path {:author string?}} :responses {200 {:body ;; Data Spec for response body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst? :author  ds maybe string?  :avatar  ds maybe string? }]}}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [author]} :path  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   285  {:keys [boosts] :or {boosts true}} :query} :parameters}]   response ok  if boosts   msg timeline-for-poster author   msg messages-by-author author    }}]]  Now that we have that all hooked up, let’s test it out in swagger.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   286  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   287  Great! we’re able to boost a post and have it moved to the top of the shared timeline, as well as adding other user’s posts to our own timeline.  Now let’s hook this up to the client.  Since we’re defaulting to including boosts, the timeline itself should be prop- erly reflected. However, we need to update our :messages filter  introduced  on page 212  to use :poster instead of :author.  guestbook-boosts src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :messages load-by-author  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ author]]  {:db  assoc db  :messages loading? true :messages filter {:poster author} :messages list nil   :ajax get {:url  str " api messages by " author   :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}    Now, we may end up with duplicates in the timeline if a user boosts a message over and over, but this is easy enough to resolve from our subscription. Since  report erratum     discuss   the feed is intended to be scrolled through, we’ll ignore any duplicate mes- sages, only rendering the first occurrance of each one.  Chapter 8. Social Interaction   288  guestbook-boosts src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-sub :messages list  fn [db _]   :list  reduce  fn [{:keys [ids list] :as acc} {:keys [id] :as msg}]   if  contains? ids id   acc {:list  conj list msg  :ids  conj ids id }    {:list [] :ids {}}  :messages list db []       Now let’s update our message component to include some of our new metadata along with a reblog button.  guestbook-boosts src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message   [m] [message m {}]   [{:keys [id timestamp message name author avatar boosts is_boost]  :or {boosts 0} :as m} {:keys [include-link?] :or {include-link? true}}]   let [{:keys [posted_at poster poster_avatar  source source_avatar] :as m}   if is_boost  m  assoc m  :poster author :poster_avatar avatar :posted_at timestamp  ]  [:article.media [:figure.media-left [image  or avatar " img avatar-default.png"  128 128]] [:div.media-content [:div.content  when is_boost  [:div.columns.is-vcentered.is-1.mb-0 [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [image  or poster_avatar " img avatar-default.png"  24 24]] [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [:a {:href  str " user " poster "?post=" id } poster]] [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 "♻"] [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [image  or source_avatar " img avatar-default.png"  24 24]]  report erratum     discuss   [:div.column.pb-0 _{:style {:text-align "left"}} [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [:a {:href  str " user " source "?post=" id } source]]]]   Improving Posts   289  [:a {:href  str " user " author }  str "@" author ] [:span.is-italic "account not found"]   [:div.mb-4>time  .toLocaleString posted_at ] [md message] [:p " - " name " <"  if author  ">"]]  [:nav.level [:div.level-left  when include-link?

We’ve also added a toolbar at the bottom with a boost button, and moved our View Post button here as well.  Great,  now  we  have  boosts.  Posts  are  living  things  now  instead  of  just ephemeral messages.  Replying to posts  Boosts  are  nice,  but  they  don’t  exactly  allow  for  a  dialogue.  Let’s  add  the ability to reply to a post.  First, let’s add a new column, parent to our posts table to allow a post to be a reply. Let’s create a migration from the REPL:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   290  user=>  create-migration "alter-posts-add-parent"   Add the following to the up migration:  guestbook-replies resources migrations 20200829234648-alter-posts-add-parent.up.sql ALTER TABLE posts  ADD COLUMN parent integer references posts id ;  And the down migration:  guestbook-replies resources migrations 20200829234648-alter-posts-add-parent.down.sql ALTER TABLE posts  DROP COLUMN parent;  Now, let’s update our save-message! query and function to allow a parent:  guestbook-replies resources sql queries.sql -- :name save-message! :<! :1 -- :doc creates a new message using the name and message keys INSERT INTO posts  author, name, message, parent  VALUES  :author, :name, :message, :parent  RETURNING *;  guestbook-replies src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn save-message!

Social Interaction   292  Next, let’s update our views and queries to return our replies with their parent messages so that they can be rendered as a message chain.  user=>  create-migration "replace-post-and-boosts-view-add-replies"   Our up migration:  guestbook-replies resources migrations 20200905 … -replace-post-and-boosts-view-add-replies.up.sql CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW reply_count as select p.id as id, count c.id  as reply_count from posts p left join posts c on c.parent = p.id group by p.id --;; CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW posts_with_replies as select * from  WITH RECURSIVE posts_with_replies AS  WITH replies AS  SELECT p.parent as parent,  p.id as id, to_jsonb pwm  as msg, p.id as post_id  from posts p left join posts_with_meta pwm on p.id = pwm.id  SELECT parent, id, msg, post_id FROM replies UNION SELECT r.parent, r.id, r.msg, p.post_id FROM replies r  INNER JOIN posts_with_replies p ON r.id = p.parent   SELECT post_id  AS id, AS messages, jsonb_agg msg   array_agg id  [count id ] AS root_id, AS is_reply count id    1  FROM posts_with_replies GROUP BY post_id  as pwr --;; ALTER VIEW posts_and_boosts RENAME TO posts_and_boosts_no_replies --;; CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW posts_and_boosts AS select * from posts_with_replies inner join reply_count using  id  inner join posts_and_boosts_no_replies using  id   and the corresponding down migration:  guestbook-replies resources migrations 20200905 … eplace-post-and-boosts-view-add-replies.down.sql DROP VIEW IF EXISTS posts_and_boosts  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   293  --;; ALTER VIEW posts_and_boosts_no_replies RENAME TO posts_and_boosts --;; DROP VIEW IF EXISTS posts_with_replies --;; DROP VIEW IF EXISTS reply_count  Before we run our migration, let’s walk through what we’re doing.  First, we’re creating a reply_count view to display the number of direct replies to a post.  Then, we’re creating our posts_with_replies view. This is a recursive select that is aggregating all parents of a post into a jsonb vector of post maps. It has four columns: id which is the post id, messages which is our vector of messages, root_id which is the id of the top-level post, and is_reply which indicates whether this message is a reply.  Then, we’re renaming our old posts_and_boosts view to posts_and_boosts_no_replies so that we can incrementally change our view instead of completely rewriting it.  Finally,  we  update  our posts_and_boosts  view  by  joining  it  with posts_and_replies and reply_count. Our down migration is simply dropping our modified posts_and_boosts, replacing it with our old version, and then dropping posts_and_replies.  Now that we understand our migration, let’s run it:  user=>  migrate   Since our old columns are unmodified, everything should still work fine. Let’s check  quickly  in  the  browser,  then  let’s  update  our  message  component  to make use of the columns we added.  We’ll be adding some significant features, and we already have a great deal of  complexity  from  our  boost  button.  Let’s  take  a  moment  to  refactor  our message component first.  Let’s  start  by  rendering  message  content,  including  replies,  in  a  dedicated component.  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message-content [{:keys [messages name author]  [:   if  seq messages   :as m}]   doall  for [{:keys [message id] :as msg}  reverse messages ]  ^{:key id}  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   294  [md :p.reply-chain-item message]    [md  :message m ]   [:p " - " name " <"  if author  [:a {:href  str " user " author }  str "@" author ] [:span.is-italic "account not found"]   ">"]]   Note that our messages column on posts_and_boosts is in order of newest to oldest, so  we  have  to  reverse  it.  Also,  we’ve  added  an  HTML  class reply-chain-item  to handle proper styling of our replies. We’ll add the required CSS once our full refactor is complete.  Next, let’s factor out the part at the top that shows the post metadata  boost data and timestamp  into its own component.  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn post-meta [{:keys [id is_boost timestamp posted_at poster poster_avatar   let [posted_at  or posted_at timestamp ]  [:   when is_boost  source source_avatar] :as m}]  [:div.columns.is-vcentered.is-1.mb-0 [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [image  or poster_avatar " img avatar-default.png"  24 24]] [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [:a {:href  str " user " poster "?post=" id } poster]] [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 "♻"] [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [image  or source_avatar " img avatar-default.png"  24 24]] [:div.column.pb-0 [:div.column.is-narrow.pb-0 [:a {:href  str " user " source "?post=" id } source]]]]   [:div.mb-4>time  if posted_at   .toLocaleString posted_at  "NULL POSTED_AT" ]]    This is taken directly from our old message component. We’ve separated it so that we can omit it when we render our post page and our reply tree.  Next, let’s pull out our buttons into expand-post-button and boost-button components:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn expand-post-button [{:keys [id root_id] :as m}]  [:button.button.is-rounded.is-small.is-secondary.is-outlined.level-item {:on-click  fn [_]   let [{{:keys [name]} :data  {:keys [path query]} :parameters} @ rf subscribe [:router current-route] ]  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   295   rtfe replace-state name path  assoc query :post id      rtfe push-state :guestbook.routes.app post {:post root_id}  }  [:i.material-icons "open_in_new"]]    defn boost-button [{:keys [boosts] :as m}]  [:button.button.is-rounded.is-small.is-info.is-outlined.level-item {:on-click  rf dispatch [:message boost! m]  :disabled  nil? @ rf subscribe [:auth user]  } "♻ " boosts]   We’ve updated our expand-post-button to account for replies. We’ll be updating our post page to display all replies, so we’ll always want to link to the root_id instead of the id. Once we update our reitit route for the post page to accept query params, we’ll make sure that this reply is focused on the root post’s post page. Now, we have to add a reply-button component. We’ll have to do some work with our message-form to get it fully working. Let’s implement a placeholder for now so that we can get everything working and make sure we refactored our message component correctly.  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn reply-button [{:keys [reply_count] :as m}]  [:button.button.is-rounded.is-small.is-outlined.level-item {:on-click  js alert "TODO" } [:span.material-icons {:style {:font-size "inherit"}} "chat"] [:span.ml-1 reply_count]]   Finally,  let’s  update  our  message  component  to  use  the  components  we’ve added:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message   [m] [message m {}]   [{:keys [id timestamp messages name author  avatar boosts is_boost reply_count]  :or {boosts 0} :as m} {:keys [include-link? include-bar?] :or {include-link? true  include-bar? true}}]  [:article.media [:figure.media-left [image  or avatar " img avatar-default.png"  128 128]] [:div.media-content [:div.content  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   296  [post-meta m] [message-content m]]  when include-bar?  [:nav.level [:div.level-left  when include-link?  [expand-post-button m]   [boost-button m] [reply-button m]]] ]]    Now, let’s go back and add some CSS for our replies:  guestbook-replies resources public css screen.css .reply-chain-item +.reply-chain-item {  padding-top: 1em; border-top: 1px dashed caa;  }  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   297  Great, looks good.  Next,  we  have  to  implement  our  reply  functionality.  We’d  like  to  place  our message form in a modal, and pop it up when we click our reply-button. However, we don’t have the pieces of our form separated enough to use from a modal. Let’s break it up and add a reply-modal component. First, let’s take a look at our message-preview. Our change to message has actually broken it! Our message-form doesn’t provide a :messages list, so it just renders an empty message. Let’s add a wrapper component that takes a parent message and creates our :messages list so that it renders properly:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message-form-preview [parent]   let [{:keys [login profile]} @ rf subscribe [:auth user]   display-name  :display-name profile login  msg {:message @ rf subscribe [:form field :message]   :id -1 :timestamp  js Date.  :name display-name :author login :avatar  :avatar profile }]  [message-preview  assoc msg :messages   cons msg  :messages parent   ]    There, now we have a correctly constructed :messages list to render.  Next, let’s add the content of the message form:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message-form-content []   let [{:keys [login profile]} @ rf subscribe [:auth user]   display-name  :display-name profile login ]  [:  [errors-component :server-error] [errors-component :unauthorized "Please log in before posting."] [:div.field [:label.label {:for :name} "Name"] display-name] [:div.field [:div.control [image-uploader  rf dispatch [:message save-media %]  "Insert an Image"]]]  [:div.field [:label.label {:for :message} "Message"] [errors-component :message] [textarea-input {:attrs {:name :message}  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   298  :save-timeout 1000 :value  rf subscribe [:form field :message]  :on-save  rf dispatch [:form set-field :message %] }]]]    Since  this  just  modifies  our  fields,  it  doesn’t  yet  require  the  parent  to  be passed.  Finally, let’s update message-form and make sure everything still works:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn message-form []  [:div.card [:div.card-header>p.card-header-title "Post Something!"] [:div.card-content [message-form-preview {}] [message-form-content] [:input.button.is-primary.is-fullwidth {:type :submit :disabled @ rf subscribe [:form validation-errors?]  :on-click  rf dispatch [:message send!  @ rf subscribe [:form fields]  @ rf subscribe [:message media] ]   :value "comment"}]]]   Now, let’s make sure everything looks correct.  Great!  Now  that  we  have  that  updated,  let’s  create  a reply-modal  component and update our reply-button to submit it.  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   299  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn reply-modal [parent]  [modals modal-card [:reply-modal  :id parent ]  str "Reply to post by user: "  :author parent   [:  [message-form-preview parent] [message-form-content]] [:input.button.is-primary.is-fullwidth {:type :submit :disabled @ rf subscribe [:form validation-errors?]  :on-click  rf dispatch [:message send!   assoc @ rf subscribe [:form fields]  :parent  :id parent   @ rf subscribe [:message media] ]   :value  str "Reply to "  :author parent  }]]   Since we’re going to be creating a more complex button, we’re using modal-card directly instead of modal-button. We’ve used a different header than message-form, we’re adding a :parent to the message args we pass to :message send!, and we’re using a different label for our submit button.  Now, let’s update our reply-button to use this modal:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  declare reply-modal    defn reply-button [{:keys [reply_count] :as m}]  [:  [reply-modal m] [:button.button.is-rounded.is-small.is-outlined.level-item {:on-click  rf dispatch [:app show-modal  [:reply-modal  :id m ]]   :disabled  not= @ rf subscribe [:auth user-state]  :authenticated } [:span.material-icons {:style {:font-size "inherit"}} "chat"] [:span.ml-1 reply_count]]]   Since reply-modal depends on reply-button via message-preview, we need to use declare in order to reference reply-modal from our reply-button component. The reply-button component itself is a fairly straightforward button based on the modal-button component.  Let’s try it out!  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   300  Our form is appearing correctly in the modal, but we have two issues. First, our modal isn’t closing after we successfully submit a reply. Let’s update our :message send!-called-back event to hide our modals:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-db :app hide-reply-modals  fn [db _]   update db :app active-modals  into  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   301  {}  remove  fn [[k v]]  %       = :reply-modal  first k       rf reg-event-fx :message send!-called-back  fn [_ [_ {:keys [success errors]}]]   if success  {:dispatch-n [[:form clear-fields]  [:message clear-media] [:app hide-reply-modals]]}  {:dispatch [:form set-server-errors errors]}     That should resolve that.  Second, all of our message forms share the same field state. If we wanted to preserve drafts, we could tweak how our :form field subscriptions work. However, we don’t need to support this so we’ll take the simple approach of clearing our fields when needed.  Let’s start by clearing whenever we open our reply modal:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :form clear  fn [_ _]  {:dispatch-n [[:form clear-fields]  [:message clear-media]]}     defn reply-button [{:keys [reply_count] :as m}]  [:  [reply-modal m] [:button.button.is-rounded.is-small.is-outlined.level-item {:on-click  fn []   rf dispatch [:form clear]   rf dispatch [:app show-modal  [:reply-modal  :id m ]]    :disabled  not= @ rf subscribe [:auth user-state]  :authenticated } [:span.material-icons {:style {:font-size "inherit"}} "chat"] [:span.ml-1 reply_count]]]   This covers most of it, but there’s still the issue of cancelling our reply when we close the modal. To account for this we need to enrich our modal-card com- ponent to accept an on-close function. Let’s  update  our  modal-card  to  optionally  take  a  opts  map  containing  an  :id instead of just id as its first argument.  report erratum     discuss   guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook modals.cljs  defn modal-card [opts-or-id title body footer]  let [{:keys [id on-close] :as opts}  if  and  Chapter 8.

Our problems are resolved. If you open a reply with the message-form component still visible in the background, you’ll still notice it updating. This is not perfect, but it’s acceptable.  Refactoring our message form re-frame events to allow separation by parent ID would be a good exercise for you to do on your own.  With that done, we have a fairly complete home page and global feed! Our next tasks will be updating the  post :id page to render the replies as a tree.  Updating the Post page  The first thing we need to is change what we fetch when the page first loads so that we have all the replies neccessary to render, along with any neccessary metadata.  Let’s start by updating our get-message query and adding a get-replies query:  guestbook-replies resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-message :? :1 -- :doc selects a message SELECT * from posts_with_meta  where id = :id -- :name get-replies :? :* select * from posts_with_meta  inner join  select id, parent from posts  as p using  id  inner join reply_count using  id   inner join  select id, parent from posts  as p using  id  inner join reply_count using  id   where id IN  select id from posts where parent = :id   We’ve updated our get-message query to include the parent and reply_count columns. This will be important for knowing if we need to render a reply tree, and how many posts we’ll need to render.  Our new query, get-replies, simply gets all the direct replies to a post. We’ll use this to expand the reply tree.  Let’s add a function to messages.clj to wrap our get-replies query:  guestbook-replies src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn get-replies [id]   db get-replies {:id id}    and then let’s add a service endpoint to fetch our replies:  guestbook-replies src clj guestbook routes services.clj ;; Inside ` api message :post-id` [" replies"  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   304  {::auth roles  auth roles :message get  :get {  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [post-id]} :path} :parameters}]   let [replies  msg get-replies post-id ]   response ok {:replies replies}   }}]  Now, before we move forward, let’s test out our updated get-message from our  api message :post-id  endpoint  and  our  new  api message :post-id replies  endpoint  in Swagger UI:  Great! Our server is all set up. Now, let’s update the front-end.  The first thing we’ll add is re-frame events for managing reply posts: ::fetch- replies, ::add-replies, ::set-replies-error, and ::clear-replies. Note, we’ll be calling ::fetch- replies for any reply that has replies itself, not just the main post. This means that we need to track status by id, since we may have more than one parallel request. Additionally, we have two separate views of our data that are relevant, the  loaded  reply  ids  for  the  parent  post,  and  the  post  bodies  of  all  of  our  report erratum     discuss   loaded messages. For the sake of ease, we’ll track status, reply-ids, and posts in three separate top-level maps.  Improving Posts   305  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  rf reg-event-fx ::fetch-replies  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ post-id]]  {:db  assoc-in db [::replies-status post-id] :loading  :ajax get {:url  str " api message " post-id " replies"   :success-path [:replies] :success-event [::add-replies post-id] :error-event [::set-replies-error post-id]}}     rf reg-event-db ::add-replies  fn [db [_ post-id replies]]   -> db   rf reg-event-db ::set-replies-error  fn [db [_ post-id response]]   -> db   rf reg-event-db ::clear-replies  fn [db _]   update ::posts  fnil into {}   map  juxt :id identity   replies   assoc-in [::replies post-id]  map :id replies    assoc-in [::replies-status post-id] :success       assoc-in [::replies-status post-id] response       dissoc db ::posts ::replies ::replies-status     Our ::fetch-replies, ::set-replies-error, and ::clear-replies events are fairly straightforward. Respectively, they send the AJAX request, store the error response, and clean up the re-frame DB. The meat of our logic lies in ::add-replies. We’re managing three maps with post-id as the keys. The ::posts map is for getting a post’s content and metadata, the ::replies map is for getting the list of child post-ids, and the ::replies-status map is for getting the status of the post’s ::fetch-replies AJAX request.  Let’s write our subscriptions for working with these maps.  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  rf reg-sub ::posts  fn [db _]   assoc  ::posts db   :id  ::post db    ::post db       rf reg-sub ::reply  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   306  :<- [::posts]  fn [posts [_ id]]  get posts id      rf reg-sub ::replies-map  fn [db _]   ::replies db      rf reg-sub ::replies-for-post :<- [::replies-map]  fn [replies [_ id]]  get replies id      rf reg-sub ::replies-status-map  fn [db _]   ::replies-status db      rf reg-sub ::replies-status :<- [::replies-status-map]  fn [statuses [_ id]]  get statuses id     We have three pairs of subscriptions. Each pair has a layer 2 subscription for the top-level maps, and a layer 3 subscription for getting the value for the specific post.  Now, let’s add our first call to ::fetch-replies to our post-controllers.  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  def post-controllers  [{:parameters {:path [:post]}  :start  fn [{{:keys [post]} :path}]  :stop  fn [_]   rf dispatch [::fetch-post post]   rf dispatch [::fetch-replies post]     rf dispatch [::clear-post]   rf dispatch [::clear-replies]  }]   We’re finally ready to add some new UI components.  Let’s add a reply-tree component to render all of the children of our root post and include it in our post component:  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  defn reply-tree [post-id]   let [reply-ids @ rf subscribe [::replies-for-post post-id]  @ rf subscribe [::replies-status post-id] ]  status   case status  nil nil  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   307  :success [:   doall  for [id reply-ids]   let [post @ rf subscribe [::reply id]   has-replies?  not= 0  :reply_count post  ]   if has-replies?  ^{:key id} [:  [msg message post {:include-link? false}] [:button.button {:on-click  rf dispatch [::fetch-replies id] } "Load Replies"] [reply-tree id]] ^{:key id} [msg message post {:include-link? false}]    ]  :loading [loading-bar] ;; ELSE [:div [:h3 "Error"] [:pre  with-out-str  pprint status  ]]      defn post [{:keys [name author message timestamp avatar id]  :as post-content}]  [:div.content [:button.button.is-info.is-outlined.is-fullwidth {:on-click  .back js window.history } "Back to Feed"] [:h3.title.is-3 "Post by " name " "] [:h4.subtitle.is-4 "Posted at "  .toLocaleString timestamp ] [msg message post-content {:include-link? false}] [reply-tree id]]   We have a recursive component which will render all replies for a post, along with  a  button  to  load  more  replies  and  a  nested reply-tree  if  a  post  has  any replies.  Ideally, we’d like to separate the inner component so that we can refactor the rendering  of  individual  posts  independently  of  the  tree  structure.  Also,  we should add the ability to expand and collapse the sub-trees.  guestbook-replies src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  rf reg-sub ::reply-count  fn [[_ id] _]   rf subscribe [::reply id]     fn [post _]   :reply_count post      rf reg-sub ::has-replies?  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8.

We’ve  also  separated  our reply-tree  into  three  components,  each  responsible  for  a  distinct  part  of  the rendering logic. The reply-tree itself is responsible for the recursive rendering, expand-control is responsible for managing the loading and expanding collapsing of  replies,  and  reply  is  responsible  for  rendering  the  message  itself.  This  report erratum     discuss   structure  allows  us  to  modify  each  behaviour  indepentently  without  them impacting each other.  Chapter 8. Social Interaction   310  Now that we have our tree looking good, let’s add some reloading functionality. We can’t really reuse our client-side logic for the home and author pages, because they have a different structure, and they are currently tied directly into the :message add event.  Let’s tweak our websocket message handler so that we can override the event we wish to dispatch with new messages.  guestbook-replies-2 src cljs guestbook websockets.cljs  rf reg-event-db :ws set-message-add-handler  fn [db [_ ev]]   if ev   assoc db :ws message-add-handler ev   dissoc db :ws message-add-handler       rf reg-sub :ws message-add-handler  fn [db _]   :ws message-add-handler db      defmethod handle-message :message add  [_ [_ msg :as msg-add-event]]  if-some [ev @ rf subscribe [:ws message-add-handler] ]   rf dispatch  conj ev msg    rf dispatch msg-add-event     Now, we can set the :ws message-add-handler from our controller to be dispatched instead of :message add when we receive a new message from the server. Let’s add a custom handler for our post page:  report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   311  guestbook-replies-2 src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  rf reg-event-db ::add-message  fn [db [_ post-id {:keys [root_id messages]}]]   if  = post-id root_id    let [parent-id  :id  second messages  ]   if  = parent-id post-id    update-in db [::post :reply_count] inc   update db ::posts   if  contains? % parent-id   db      def post-controllers  [{:parameters {:path [:post]}  :start  fn [{{:keys [post]} :path}]   update-in % [parent-id :reply_count] inc  %       rf dispatch [:ws set-message-add-handler [::add-message post]]   rf dispatch [::fetch-post post]   rf dispatch [::fetch-replies post]    :stop  fn [_]  ]    rf dispatch [:ws set-message-add-handler nil]   rf dispatch [::collapse-all]   rf dispatch [::clear-post]   rf dispatch [::clear-replies]  }  We don’t want to shift content around, so we’ll only update the reply_count field on the parent post if we have it loaded.  The last thing we’ll add is the ability to focus a post in the tree. Let’s add an endpoint for getting all of our focused message’s parents, and then we’ll scroll to it when they load.  Let’s start by adding a query parameter declaration to our post page:  guestbook-replies-2 src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc [" post :post"  merge {:name ::post} ? :cljs {:parameters {:query { ds opt :reply  pos-int?}  :path {:post pos-int?}}  :controllers post post-controllers :view 'post post-page}  ]  Then, let’s add a query, function, and API endpoint to get the parents of a reply:  guestbook-replies-2 resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-parents SELECT * from posts_with_meta  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   312  inner join  select id, parent from posts  as p using  id  inner join reply_count using  id   where id in  with recursive parents as   select id, parent from posts  where id = :id UNION select p.id, p.parent from posts p  inner join parents pp  on p.id = pp.parent   select id from parents   This query gets the desired post, then iteratively includes parents of selected posts with a recursive union.  Then we just need to wrap our query with a function:  guestbook-replies-2 src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn get-parents [id]   db get-parents {:id id}    And expose it as an endpoint:  guestbook-replies-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj ;; Inside ` api message :post-id` [" parents" {::auth roles  auth roles :message get  :get {  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [post-id]} :path} :parameters}]   let [parents  msg get-parents post-id ]   response ok {:parents parents}   }}]  Now, let’s add some events to fetch and set the parents of our post. We don’t need to be as thorough as before, because the disruption to the user if it fails is minimal, and it only gets called when our controller runs.  guestbook-replies-2 src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  rf reg-event-fx ::fetch-parents  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ post-id]]  {:ajax get {:url  str " api message " post-id " parents"   :success-path [:parents] :success-event [::add-parents post-id]}}     defn add-post-to-db [db {:keys [id parent] :as post}]   -> db   assoc-in [::posts id] post   update-in [::replies parent]   if  some  partial = id  %   %  conj % id     report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   313   assoc-in [::replies-status id] :success   update ::expanded-posts  fnil conj {}  id      rf reg-event-db ::add-parents  fn [db [_ post-id parents]]   reduce add-post-to-db db parents      def post-controllers  [{:parameters {:path [:post]}  :start  fn [{{:keys [post]} :path}]   rf dispatch [:ws set-message-add-handler [::add-message post]]   rf dispatch [::fetch-post post]   rf dispatch [::fetch-replies post]    :stop  fn [_]   rf dispatch [:ws set-message-add-handler nil]   rf dispatch [::collapse-all]   rf dispatch [::clear-post]   rf dispatch [::clear-replies]  }  {:parameters {:query [:reply]} :start  fn [{{:keys [reply]} :query}]   when reply   rf dispatch [::fetch-parents reply]     } ]   Since our parent posts aren’t grouped as nicely, we’ll add a helper function to add an individual post, and then use reduce to add each of our parent posts to our db.  Now,  let’s  update  our  expand-post-button  to  pass  in  the  :reply  id  as  a  query parameter like so:  guestbook-replies-2 src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  defn expand-post-button [{:keys [id root_id] :as m}]  [:button.button.is-rounded.is-small.is-secondary.is-outlined.level-item {:on-click  fn [_]   let [{{:keys [name]} :data  {:keys [path query]} :parameters} @ rf subscribe [:router current-route] ]   rtfe replace-state name path  assoc query :post id      rtfe push-state :guestbook.routes.app post {:post root_id}   when  not= root_id id   {:reply id}   }  [:i.material-icons "open_in_new"]]   Now let’s try it out.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   314  Okay,  we’ve  got  our  parent  posts  loading  and  expanding,  but  we  aren’t focusing our chosen post. Let’s try adding the same logic we had for our mes- sage-list by turning our reply component into a React class with a :component-did- mount function:   defn reply [post-id]   r create-class  {:component-did-mount  fn [this]   let [message-id  -> @ rf subscribe [:router current-route]   :parameters :query :reply ]   when  = message-id post-id    .scrollIntoView  dom dom-node this       :reagent-render  fn [_]  [msg message @ rf subscribe [::reply post-id]  {:include-link? false}] }    This seems to work, but try collapsing and expanding one of our post’s parents. Oh no! We’re scrolling to the post every time! Our msg-li component was never being  remounted,  so  we  never  encountered  this  problem.  Let’s  fix  this  by adding a flag to ensure that our :component-did-mount only ever gets called once.  guestbook-replies-2 src cljs guestbook views post.cljs  rf reg-event-db ::set-scroll-to  fn [db [_ id]]  if  nil? id   report erratum     discuss   Improving Posts   315   dissoc db ::scroll-to-post   assoc db ::scroll-to-post id       rf reg-sub ::scroll?  fn [db [_ id]]   = id  ::scroll-to-post db     ;; In `post-controllers` {:parameters {:query [:reply]} :start  fn [{{:keys [reply]} :query}]   when reply   rf dispatch [::set-scroll-to reply]   rf dispatch [::fetch-parents reply]      rf dispatch [::set-scroll-to nil]    :stop  fn [_]  }   defn reply [post-id]   r create-class  {:component-did-mount  fn [this]   when @ rf subscribe [::scroll? post-id]    rf dispatch [::set-scroll-to nil]   .scrollIntoView  dom dom-node this      :reagent-render  fn [_]  [msg message @ rf subscribe [::reply post-id]  {:include-link? false}] }    Instead of checking against the route directly, we’re using our ::scroll? subscrip- tion to decide if we should scroll. We’re also clearing the ::scroll-to value in the db once we do scroll, so that we don’t scroll every time.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   316  Alright, our post page is looking pretty good! We have a way to look at the full discussion around a post. Next, let’s build some richer feeds.  Curating Posts  Posts are looking pretty snazzy now, but we still don’t have a way of easily finding  posts  a  user  might  want  to  see.  Discoverability  of  new  content  is integral to social media platforms, so we should really add this.  The  first  discoverability  feature  we’ll  address  is  tags.  We  implemented  the markdown for tags earlier, now let’s add the queries and page to browse posts by tag.  Tags  We’re going to use a PostgreSQL regex condition on our query, but we don’t want  to  require  knowledge  of  PostgreSQL  specifics  in  our guestbook.messages namespace. So, we’ll use clojure expressions in HugSQL to generate our regex inside our query.  First, let’s create a namespace guestbook.db.util and write a helper function there:  guestbook-feeds src clj guestbook db util.clj  ns guestbook.db.util   :require [clojure.string :as string]     defn tag-regex [tag]   when-not  re-matches "[-\w]+" tag    str "'.* \\s^ "  {:tag tag}      throw  ex-info "Tag must only contain alphanumeric characters!"  report erratum     discuss   Curating Posts   317  tag " \\s$ .*'"    Note that it is sanitizing our input. This is very important when using clojure expressions to inject generated strings. This is because HugSQL has no way of knowing which parts of our returned SQL are meant to be escaped.  Now, let’s write a simple query using this helper function:  guestbook-feeds resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-feed-for-tag :? :* -- :require [guestbook.db.util :refer [tag-regex]] -- Given a tag, return its feed select * from  select distinct on  p.id  * from posts_and_boosts as p  where  *~  if  :tag params  *   p.message ~*  *~*  false  *~   ~*  --~  when  :tag params   tag-regex  :tag params     order by p.id, posted_at desc  as t order by t.posted_at asc  In order to use our helper function, we need to require the new guestbook.db.util namespace from guestbook.db.core.   ns guestbook.db.core   :require  ;;... [guestbook.db.util]   ;;...     Great, now let’s try it out from the repl:  guestbook.db.core>  conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"  ;;... guestbook.db.core>  get-feed-for-tag {:tag "bar"}   {:message "This is a tagged post foo bar baz" ;;... } {:message "This is another tagged post bar" ;;... }  guestbook.db.core>  Perfect, we’re getting tagged posts correctly!  report erratum     discuss   Now, let’s add a wrapper function and a service API endpoint to get our posts by tag:  Chapter 8. Social Interaction   318  guestbook-feeds src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn get-feed-for-tag [tag]  {:messages  db get-feed-for-tag {:tag tag} }   guestbook-feeds src clj guestbook routes services.clj ;; in " api messages" [" tagged :tag" {:get {:parameters {:path {:tag string?}} :responses {200 {:body ;; Data Spec for response body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst? :author  ds maybe string?  :avatar  ds maybe string? }]}}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [tag]} :path  {:keys [boosts] :or {boosts true}} :query} :parameters}]   if boosts   response ok  msg get-feed-for-tag tag    response not-implemented {:message "Tags only support boosts."}   }}]  Then let’s test it out in Swagger:  report erratum     discuss   Curating Posts   319  Looks good.  Now, let’s write our tag page based on our author page:  guestbook-feeds src cljs guestbook views tag.cljs  ns guestbook.views.tag   :require [re-frame.core :as rf] [guestbook.messages :as messages]     def tag-controllers  [{:parameters {:path [:tag]}  :start  fn [{{:keys [tag]} :path}]   rf dispatch [:messages load-by-tag tag]  }]    defn tag [_]   let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]   fn [{{{:keys [tag]} :path  {:keys [post]} :query} :parameters}]  [:div.content [:div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds [:div.columns>div.column [:h3  str "Posts tagged " tag ]  if @ rf subscribe [:messages loading?]   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   320  [messages message-list-placeholder] [messages message-list messages post] ]]]     We have the same core component as the author page, but without the author- specific pieces. Now, let’s write the supporting code for this page and then connect it to our routes.   re-pattern  str " ?<=\\s^ " tag " ?=\\s$ "   % }  guestbook-feeds src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :messages load-by-tag  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ tag]]  {:db  assoc db  :messages loading? true :messages filter {:message  re-find  :messages list nil   :ajax get {:url  str " api messages tagged " tag   :success-path [:messages] :success-event [:messages set]}}    guestbook-feeds src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc ;; require [guestbook.views.tag :as tag] in :cljs [" tag :tag"  merge {:name ::tag} ? :cljs {:parameters {:query { ds opt :post  pos-int?}  :path {:tag string?}}  :controllers tag tag-controllers :view 'tag tag}  ]  Our :messages load-by-tag is very similar to our :messages load-by-author, we’ve just changed two things. We’ve switched the :url in the :ajax get effect to the one we just created, and we’ve changed the :messages filter map to filter messages with a regular expression.  Let’s try it out by clicking on one of our tag links:  report erratum     discuss   Curating Posts   321  Great! Now we can view all posts with a specific tag.  We have the ability to view posts for a single tag and a single author. Next, let’s add the ability for users to subscribe to authors or tags.  Personalized Feed  One of the core features of most social media is a personal curated feed, with posts relevant to them. Let’s add the ability for users to Subscribe unsubscribe to users and or tags and view a personalized feed based on their subscriptions.  First, let’s write a query that takes a vector of users and a vector of tags and returns a feed.  guestbook-feeds-2 resources sql queries.sql -- :name get-feed :? :* -- :require [guestbook.db.util :refer [tags-regex]] -- Given a vector of follows and a vector of tags, return a feed select * from  select distinct on  p.id  * from posts_and_boosts as p  where  *~  if  seq  :follows params   *   p.poster in  :v*:follows   *~*  false  *~   ~*  or  *~  if  seq  :tags params   *  p.message ~*  *~*  false  *~   ~*  --~  when  seq  :tags params    tags-regex  :tags params     order by p.id, posted_at desc  as t  order by t.posted_at asc  report erratum     discuss   We need to write another helper function similar to tag-regex that takes a vector of tags instead of just one.  Chapter 8. Social Interaction   322  guestbook-feeds-2 src clj guestbook db util.clj  defn tags-regex [tags-raw]   let [tags  filter  re-matches "[-\w]+" %  tags-raw ]   when  not-empty tags   str "'.* \\s^  "   string join "" tags  "  \\s$ .*'"      Now we’re able to get a feed based on a map of :follows and :tags, and we can leave one or the other empty.  Next, we need to get this subscriptions map from somewhere. Let’s add sub- scriptions  to  a  user’s  :profile  JSONB.  We’ll  reuse  our   api my-account set-profile endpoint, so we just need to add some utilities for working with the :subscriptions field on the :profile map. Let’s create a new clojurescript namespace called guestbook.subscriptions and add a subscribe-button component:  guestbook-feeds-2 src cljs guestbook subscriptions.cljs  ns guestbook.subscriptions   :require [re-frame.core :as rf]     rf reg-event-fx :subscription set  fn [{:keys [db]} [_ subs-type sub subscribe?]]   let [profile  update-in   get-in db [:auth user :profile]  [:subscriptions subs-type]  fnil  if subscribe?  conj % sub   partial filterv  partial not= sub     []  ]  {:db  assoc db ::loading? true  :ajax post {:url " api my-account set-profile" :params {:profile profile} :success-event [:subscription handle profile]}}      rf reg-event-db :subscription handle  fn [db [_ profile]]   -> db   assoc-in [:auth user :profile] profile   dissoc ::loading?       rf reg-sub  report erratum     discuss   Curating Posts   323  :subscription subscribed? :<-[:auth user]  fn [{:keys [profile]} [_ subs-type sub]]   boolean  some  partial = sub   get-in profile [:subscriptions subs-type] []        rf reg-sub :subscription loading?  fn [db _]   ::loading? db      defn subscribe-button [subs-type sub]   let [subscribed? @ rf subscribe [:subscription subscribed? subs-type sub]   loading? @ rf subscribe [:subscription loading?] ]  [:subscription set subs-type sub  not subscribed? ]    case @ rf subscribe [:auth user-state]   :authenticated [:button.button.is-primary.is-rounded {:class  when subscribed? "is-outlined"  :on-click  rf dispatch  :disabled loading?}  if subscribed?  "Unfollow " "Follow "    str  case subs-type :follows "@" :tags "" ""  sub ] ;;ELSE [:p "Log in to personalize your feed."]     Our :subscription set event is the core of our logic. Unlike our profile page where we have a bunch of local changes, we’re doing a single change at a time. The subs-type parameter specifies whether we’re working with a tag or a user, sub is the value itself, and subscribe? is whether we’re adding or removing the sub- scription.  Based  on  these  parameters,  we  modify  the  profile  we  have  and immediately send it to set-profile, and set a ::loading? flag to ensure that we don’t send conflicting updates simultaneously. The rest of the namespace is fairly straightforward.  Now, let’s include the subscribe-button in our tag page and our author page:  guestbook-feeds-2 src cljs guestbook views tag.cljs [:h3  str "Posts tagged " tag ] [sub subscribe-button :tags tag]  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   324  guestbook-feeds-2 src cljs guestbook views author.cljs [:h3 "Posts by " display-name "  "] [sub subscribe-button :follows user]  Great! Now we have the ability to manage subscriptions for our feed.  Now we just need to add a page to render it.  Let’s start with a new namespace called guestbook.views.feed:  guestbook-feeds-2 src cljs guestbook views feed.cljs  ns guestbook.views.feed   :require [guestbook.auth :as auth] [guestbook.messages :as messages] [re-frame.core :as rf]     def feed-controllers  [{:identity  js Date.   :start  fn [_]   defn feed [_]   rf dispatch [:messages load-feed]  }]    let [messages  rf subscribe [:messages list] ]   fn [{{{:keys [post]} :query} :parameters}]  [:div.content [:div.columns.is-centered>div.column.is-two-thirds  case @ rf subscribe [:auth user-state]   :loading  report erratum     discuss   Curating Posts   325  [:div.columns>div.column {:style {:width "5em"}} [:progress.progress.is-dark.is-small {:max 100} "30%"]] :authenticated [:  [:div.columns>div.column [:h3  str "My Feed" ]  if @ rf subscribe [:messages loading?]   [messages message-list-placeholder] [messages message-list messages post] ]  [:div.columns>div.column [messages message-form]]]  :anonymous [:div.columns>div.column [:div.notification.is-clearfix [:span "Log in or create an account to curate a personalized feed!"] [:div.buttons.is-pulled-right [auth login-button] [auth register-button]]]] ]]     This is similar to our other message-list based pages, but we have the added concern that the feed is dependent on the current user’s session rather than parameters. To manage this, we’ve expanded the scope of our :auth user-state case  statement,  and  we’ve  added  an :identity  function  to  our  controller  that changes with every reload. This ensures that we never get stuck with an old list of messages.  Before this page will work, we need to connect a service endpoint to the query we wrote earlier, and we need to write the :messages load-feed event to call it.  Let’s start with our endpoint:  guestbook-feeds-2 src clj guestbook messages.clj  defn get-feed [feed-map]   when-not  every?  re-matches "[-\w]+" %   :tags feed-map     throw  ex-info "Tags must only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores!" feed-map     {:messages  db get-feed  merge {:follows []  :tags []} feed-map  }   guestbook-feeds-2 src clj guestbook routes services.clj ;; in " api messages" [" feed" {::auth roles  auth roles :messages feed  :get  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 8. Social Interaction   326  {:responses {200 {:body ;; Data Spec for response body {:messages [{:id pos-int? :name string? :message string? :timestamp inst? :author  ds maybe string?  :avatar  ds maybe string? }]}}}  :handler  fn [{{{:keys [boosts]  :or {boosts true}} :query} :parameters  {{{:keys [subscriptions]} :profile} :identity} :session}]   if boosts   response ok  msg get-feed subscriptions    response not-implemented {:message "Feed only supports boosts."}   }}]  Note  that  we  require  an  identity  to  be  present  on  the  request  map,  so  we should add a new auth entry as well:  guestbook-feeds-2 src clj guestbook auth.clj ;; Inside `roles` :messages feed {:authenticated}  Now, let’s write our re-frame event:  guestbook-feeds-2 src cljs guestbook messages.cljs  rf reg-event-fx :messages load-feed  fn [{:keys [db]} _]   let [{:keys [follows tags]}   get-in db [:auth user :profile :subscriptions] ]  {:db  assoc db  :messages loading? true :messages list nil :messages filter [{:message   some   fn [tag]  re-find  re-pattern  str " ?<=\\s^ " tag " ?=\\s$ "   %   tags } {:poster  some   partial = %  follows }]   :ajax get {:url " api messages feed" :success-path [:messages]  report erratum     discuss    defn add-message? [filter-map msg]  :success-event [:messages set]}}     Curating Posts   327   every?  fn [[k matcher]]   let [v  get msg k ]   cond   set? matcher   matcher v   fn? matcher   matcher v  :else  = matcher v      filter-map    rf reg-event-db :message add  fn [db [_ message]]   let [msg-filter  :messages filter db   filters  if  map? msg-filter   [msg-filter] msg-filter ]   if  some  add-message? % message  filters   update db :messages list conj message  db      Notice that we have to update our :message filter logic to account for multiple ways  of  matching.  We’ve  simply  allowed  for  a  vector  of  maps  in  place  of  a single map. This allows us to accomodate the feed filter without having to change our older, simpler filters.  Finally, let’s add our feed page to our routes and our navbar:  guestbook-feeds-2 src cljc guestbook routes app.cljc ;; require [guestbook.views.feed :as feed] in :cljs [" feed"  merge {:name ::feed} ? :cljs {:parameters {:query { ds opt :post  pos-int?}}  :controllers feed feed-controllers :view 'feed feed}  ]  guestbook-feeds-2 src cljs guestbook core.cljs ;; In navbar  when  = @ rf subscribe [:auth user-state]  :authenticated   [:  [:a.navbar-item {:href  rtfe href :guestbook.routes.app author  {:user  :login @ rf subscribe [:auth user]  } }  "My Posts"] [:a.navbar-item {:href  rtfe href :guestbook.routes.app feed }  report erratum     discuss   "My Feed"]]   Let’s try it out.  Chapter 8. Social Interaction   328  Great! We have a personalized feed. Aside from enriching some features and tweaking style, we have a fully functional and feature complete social media application! Congratulations!  What you’ve learned  In  this  chapter  we’ve  added  several  different  features  that  enhance  our application in various ways. Note that we were able to do this without exten- sively modify our existing codebase. While we did enhance some functionality, we did so in an additive way. This is the desired flow: we incrementally built our data model and once it solidified we were able to rapidly build new fea- tures.  You might have noticed that a lot of the feed pages are variations on a theme. Some  of  the  code  we’ve  written  is  a  tad  repetitive,  especially  our  SQL.  We won’t cover refactoring our SQL in gritty detail, but it would be a good exercise to update the functions in guestbook.messages to reuse our general query rather than a bunch of individual ones. As long as the data we return is the same shape, we can optimize our SQL layer as much as we like. This has the added benefit  of  providing  flexibility  to  enhance  our  current  pages  and  add  new ones.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 9  Deployment  In this chapter we’ll take a look at adding tests and packaging the application for deployment.  Unit Tests  There are many schools of thought on how, what, and when to test. This is a  very  sensitive  subject  for  many  people.  As  such,  We  will  simply  give  an overview of the basic tools available for testing and leave it up to you to decide how and when to use them.  The Test API Clojure  provides  built-in  support  for  testing  via  the  clojure.test  namespace. When a new project is created, a test package is generated along with it.  Let’s take a quick look at what the clojure.test API looks like and how to work with  it.  The  simplest  way  to  write  tests  is  to  create  assertions  using  the is macro. The following are a few examples of how it works:  user>  require '[clojure.test :refer [is]]  nil user>  is  = 4  + 2 2    true user>  is  = 5  + 2 2    FAIL in     form-init8422778450785897308.clj:50  expected: 5 actual: 4  diff: - 5 + 4  false user>  is  even? 2   true user>  is  instance? String 123    report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9. Deployment   330  FAIL in     form-init8422778450785897308.clj:60  expected:  instance? String 123   actual: java.lang.Long  false user>  is  instance? String 123  "Not a string!"  FAIL in     form-init8422778450785897308.clj:66  Not a string! expected:  instance? String 123   actual: java.lang.Long  false user>  As you can see, the is macro can take any expression as the first argument, and a message string as an optional second argument. If the expression fails, the macro prints the expression along with the actual result and the message if provided and then returns false; otherwise it returns true. We can also group our tests together by using the testing macro. This macro accepts a string name for the group of tests followed by the assertions.  user>  require '[clojure.test :refer [is testing]]  nil user>  testing "Collections"   is  coll? {}    is  coll? {}    is  coll? []    is  coll? '       true user>  testing "Collections"   is  coll? {}    is  coll? 123     FAIL in     form-init8422778450785897308.clj:83  Collections expected:  coll? 123   actual:  not  coll? 123    false user>  Finally, we can define tests by using the deftest macro:  user>  require '[clojure.test :refer [is testing deftest run-tests]]  nil user>  deftest collections-test  testing "Collections"   is  coll? {}    is  coll? {}    is  coll? []    is  coll?

You can also run all the tests in the read-evaluate-print loop by calling run-tests. All tests in the application’s test folder can be run via Leiningen by calling lein test. The API contains a number of other helpers as well, but I hope that the pre- ceding examples will prove sufficient for you to get started.  Finally, you may wish to explore Peridot1 and Kaocha2 libraries that provide additional support for testing Ring based web applications. These frameworks provide many features not found in the core testing API. If your testing needs go beyond the basics we explored here, these will make excellent tools in your Clojure toolbox.  Testing the Application  Our app has two types of routes. Some routes serve the user-interface  UI  portion of the application to be rendered by the browser, and others expose service end points accessed via Ajax by the client part of the application. We’ll look at writing tests for both types of routes in our application.  Before we proceed, we’ll need to make a couple of updates to our application. First thing we’ll need to do will be to create a test database instance. Having a separate database for testing is always a good idea because it allows us to separate our test data from any development data we might have in flight.  1. 2.  https:  github.com xeqi peridot https:  github.com lambdaisland kaocha  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9. Deployment   332  This allows us to ensure that we always have a clean database for testing and that the test data is consistent. Let’s create a new database instance called gb_test with the same owner as our development database. Next, we’ll have to add this database’s URL to test-config.edn:  guestbook-tests test-config.edn {:port 3000 :database-url "postgresql:  localhost:5432 gb_test?user=guestbook&password=password"}  With that done, let’s start on testing our routes. Luminus includes a library called ring-mock3 by default. The library provides a number of helper functions for generating mock requests.  We already have a test harness defined for our application. You can find it under the test clj guestbook test  directory. The tests for our ring handler are in handler.clj. If we open it up, we can see that it defines a test called test-app.  guestbook test clj guestbook handler_test.clj  ns guestbook.handler-test   :require  [clojure.test :refer :all] [ring.mock.request :refer :all] [guestbook.handler :refer :all] [guestbook.middleware.formats :as formats] [muuntaja.core :as m] [mount.core :as mount]     defn parse-json [body]   m decode formats instance "application json" body     use-fixtures  :once  fn [f]   f      deftest test-app   testing "main route"   mount start 'guestbook.config env  'guestbook.handler app-routes    let [response   app   request :get " "  ]   is  = 200  :status response        testing "not-found route"   let [response   app   request :get " invalid"  ]   is  = 404  :status response        3.  https:  github.com ring-clojure ring-mock  report erratum     discuss   There’s  a  pretty  glaring  problem  here.  In  Setting  up  front-end  routing,  on page 197 we changed guestbook.handler app-routes to guestbook.handler routes, but never updated it here. Let’s address that and try it out.  Unit Tests   333  $ lein test guestbook.test.handler lein test guestbook.test.handler lein test :only guestbook.test.handler guestbook.test.handler ERROR in  guestbook.test.handler   core.cljc:80  Uncaught exception in test fixture expected: nil  actual: java.lang.RuntimeException:  could not start ['guestbook.handler routes] due to  at ... Caused by: clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo:  path " ws" doesn't have a :handler defined for :get  ... Ran 0 tests containing 1 assertions. 0 failures, 1 errors. Tests failed. $  We have an error in our fixture, specifically when we try to start our routes state. Let’s investigate where " ws" is defined to see why it’s breaking here:  guestbook-tests src clj guestbook routes websockets.clj  defn websocket-routes []  [" ws" {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf  middleware wrap-formats]  :get  :ajax-get-or-ws-handshake-fn socket  :post  :ajax-post-fn socket }]   It’s subtle, but you might notice what our issue is. Our :get and :post handlers depend on our socket state, and we haven’t started it in our use-fixtures! Let’s update our fixture like so:  guestbook-tests test clj guestbook handler_test.clj  use-fixtures  :once  fn [f]   f      mount start 'guestbook.config env  'guestbook.routes.websockets socket 'guestbook.handler routes   With that fixed, let’s take a closer look at our default test-app test.   deftest test-app   testing "main route"  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9. Deployment   334   let [response   app   request :get " "  ]   is  = 200  :status response        testing "not-found route"   let [response   app   request :get " invalid"  ]   is  = 404  :status response        The ring.mock.request request function is used to generate the request. It accepts a keyword indicating the request method, followed by the target URI and an optional parameter map that isn’t used in the example.   request         The request is then passed to the guestbook.handler app function that is the main entry point for our application. The result of calling app with the mock request is a Ring-style response discussed in Chapter 2, Luminus Web Stack, on page 29.  The  first  test  checks  that  the  app  responds  with  the  status  200  when  we request the   URI. The second test checks that status 404 is returned for a nonexistent URI.  Now let’s see what’s involved in creating a test for the login service operation. We’d  like  to  call  the  login  URL  and  pass  it  the  user  ID  and  the  password. However, the login credentials must be passed in as a JSON body.  Let’s write a login-request function that generates the request and sets the body using the ring.mock.request json-body function.  guestbook-tests test clj guestbook handler_test.clj  defn login-request [login pass]   ->  request :post " api login"  login   json-body {:login  :password pass}     That leaves us with one last problem. The guestbook.auth authenticate-user function calls guestbook.db.core get-user-for-auth* to fetch user credentials from the database. However, we wish to test the request handler in isolation, not the model. In some  languages  it’s  possible  to  use  monkey  patching  to  get  around  this problem. This approach allows you to simply redefine the offending function at runtime with your own version. The downside of this approach is that the change is global and therefore might interact poorly with code that expects the original version. Clojure provides a with-redefs macro that redefines vars within the scope of its body. This approach gives us the ability to make run- time modifications in asafer fashion, where we know precisely the scope of the  code  that  is  affected.  Let’s  look  at  how  this  works  in  action.  Let’s  first define a mock function that returns a test user.  report erratum     discuss   Unit Tests   335  guestbook-tests test clj guestbook handler_test.clj ;; require [buddy.hashers :as hashers] in namespace declaration  defn mock-user [{:keys [login]}]   when  = login "foo"   {:login "foo" :password  hashers encrypt "password"  :created_at now :profile {}}    We can now redefine the guestbook.db.core get-user-for-auth* with the mock function before running our test:   with-redefs [guestbook.db.core get-user-for-auth* mock-user]    app   login-request "foo" "bar"     We can see that the response contains the status of 200. The response body is an input stream, and we’ll want to get data out of it. The luminus template helpfully includes a parse-json function for us.  guestbook-tests test clj guestbook handler_test.clj  defn parse-json [body]   m decode formats instance "application json" body    We can now check that the response has reasonable data:   with-redefs [guestbook.db.core get-user-for-auth* mock-user]  ->  login-request "foo" "bar"    app   :body parse-json    ;;{:identity {...}}  If we provide incorrect credentials, we’ll see a different response instead:   with-redefs [guestbook.db.core get-user-for-auth* mock-user]  ->  login-request "foo" "xxx"    app   :body parse-json    ;;{:message "Incorrect login or password."}  Now,  let’s  wrap  this  up  in  an  actual  test  that  checks  that  our  application responds correctly in both scenarios:  guestbook-tests test clj guestbook handler_test.clj ;; require [clojure.instant :refer [read-instant-date]]  deftest test-login   with-redefs [guestbook.db.core get-user-for-auth* mock-user]   let [handler  app ]   testing "login success"   let [{:keys [body status] :as r}  handler   login-request "foo" "password"    json  parse-json body ]   println  assoc r :body json    is  = 200 status    is  =  ->   :identity json   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9. Deployment   336   update :created_at read-instant-date    -> {:login "foo"}  mock-user  dissoc :password         testing "password mismatch"   is  = 401 status          let [{:keys [status]}  handler  login-request "foo" "hacker"  ]  We needed to add some additional parsing on top of parse-json because JSON doesn’t have native support for dates. Our coercion middleware is handling this for us usually, but since we are parsing our response manually we have to account for JSON’s shortcomings ourselves. The with-redefs macro proved pretty useful here. It’s handy that we didn’t have to plan for testing or mocking when writing our application’s business logic.  Database Testing  Now that we’ve seen some basics of testing, let’s take a look at how we can test our app against a database. We have some default boilerplate in guest- book.test.db.core, let’s take a look:  guestbook test clj guestbook db core_test.clj  ns guestbook.db.core-test   :require [guestbook.db.core :refer [*db*] :as db] [java-time.pre-java8] [luminus-migrations.core :as migrations] [clojure.test :refer :all] [next.jdbc :as jdbc] [guestbook.config :refer [env]] [mount.core :as mount]     use-fixtures  :once  fn [f]   mount start 'guestbook.config env 'guestbook.db.core *db*   migrations migrate ["migrate"]  select-keys env [:database-url]    f      deftest test-messages   jdbc with-transaction [t-conn *db* {:rollback-only true}]   is  = 1  db save-message!  t-conn {:name "Bob" :message "Hello, World"} {:connection t-conn}      is  = {:name "Bob"  :message "Hello, World"}  report erratum     discuss   Unit Tests   337   ->  db get-messages t-conn {}    first   select-keys [:name :message]        The fixtures are used to initialize the database connection and run any out- standing migrations before the tests are run. The test-users test is out of date, so let’s start from scratch:  guestbook-tests test clj guestbook db core_test.clj  deftest test-users   jdbc with-transaction [t-conn *db* {:rollback-only true}]   is  = 1  db create-user!* t-conn  {:login "foo" :password "password"}      is  = {:login "foo" :profile {}}  dissoc  db get-user* t-conn  {:login "foo"}  :created_at       We’ve covered the same functionality as the default test.  Using a test schema allows us to test our application end-to-end. I recom- mended this approach for any integration and validation testing.  ClojureScript Testing  We’ve already added the boilerplate necessary to run ClojureScript tests back in chapter todo. Now, all we need to do is to add the actual tests and include ClojureScript source path in our project.clj. First, let’s create a new folder for the tests by running the following command in the root of the project:  $ mkdir -p test cljs guestbook   Now that we’ve created an additional source path for the frontend tests, we’ll also need to update our project.clj to reference this path in the test profile under the :test-paths key:  { ;;...  }  :test-paths ["test clj" "test cljs"] ;;...  Since our shadow-cljs.edn configuration contains the directive :lein true, it will infer the test paths from our project.clj file. We can now create a file called core_test.cljs in the test cljs guestbook folder. This file will contain the namespace that we’ll be using for our tests. Let’s add the following code in the namespace declaration:  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9. Deployment   338  guestbook-tests test cljs guestbook core_test.cljs  ns guestbook.core-test   :require [cljs.test :refer-macros [is are deftest testing use-fixtures]]  [pjstadig.humane-test-output] [reagent.dom.server :as dom] [guestbook.components :as gc]    The namespace requires some boilerplate for running the tests, along with a reference to reagent.dom.server, and the guestbook.components namespace from our app. We can now try testing the components that we built for rendering the frontend of our application. Let’s add a test for the md function that renders Markdown to HTML and check that it produces the intended output:  guestbook-tests test cljs guestbook core_test.cljs  deftest test-md   is  = "  Hello  "   dom render-to-string  gc md " Hello"       With  the  code  in  place,  we  can  execute  the  following  command  to  run  the tests:  $ npx shadow-cljs compile test shadow-cljs - config: ... shadow-cljs.edn shadow-cljs - running: lein run -m shadow.cljs.devtools.cli --npm compile test [:test] Compiling ... ========= Running Tests ======================= Testing guestbook.core-test Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions. 0 failures, 0 errors. =============================================== [:test] Build completed.  81 files, 2 compiled, 0 warnings, 3.20s   This is all that’s needed for running tests using shdow-cljs using the Node.js runtime. For further documentation and examples on testing please refer to the official shadow-cljs documentation.4  Package the Application  Our application is now ready to be packaged and deployed. Let’s see how to accomplish this using Leiningen and go over some of the things to be aware of, depending on how you wish to run the application in production.  Up to this point we’ve been running our application by calling lein run to start up the HTTP server in development mode. In this mode the server watches the files for changes and reloads them as needed. This obviously causes a  4.  https:  shadow-cljs.github.io docs UsersGuide.html_testing  report erratum     discuss   Package the Application   339  significant  performance  hit.  Since  we  should  optimize  our  application  for performance when we deploy in production, we’ll need to package it differently. Let’s look at what’s involved in packaging and running a Clojure web applica- tions in production.  Clojure applications are idiomatically packaged as standalone uberjar con- taining  all  the  assets  for  a  given  application.  An  uberjar  has  no  external dependencies, aside from having the Java Runtime Environment installed on the target system.  Any environment specific configuration such as database connections, SSL configuration, and so on are typically managed using an EDN configuration file provided by the target environment.  Standalone Deployment  Here we’ll take a closer look at what’s involved in deployment as a standalone application.  When  we  wish  to  package  the  application  for  standalone  deployment,  we simply run the following from the application’s root:  Running as an UberJar  $ lein uberjar  The resulting artifact will be created in the target folder. The artifact can now be run using java command, but we do need to provide the production config- uration. Luminus uses a library called cprop5 for configuration management. The  library  provides  a  number  of  options  for  specifying  the  configuration settings.  The first option is to include the configuration directly in the JAR. The library will look for a config.edn file on the classpath and read the configuration from there. Alternatively, we can specify the location of the EDN configuration file using an environment variable called conf. When multiple configurations are found, they will be merged into a single configuration map when the applica- tion starts. The keys found in the external configuration will overwrite the keys in the one packaged in the JAR. Finally, we can specify the configuration keys as environment variables.  We already have a dev-config.edn configuration file that we’ve been using during development, so let’s use it to test that our app works standalone by passing  5.  https:  github.com tolitius cprop  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9. Deployment   340  it using the conf environment variable. Once the server starts, should be able to confirm that the app is running by browsing to localhost:3000.  $ java -Dconf=dev-config.edn -jar target uberjar guestbook.jar  In order to actually run the app in production, all you need to do is replace dev-config.edn  with  the  appropriate  filename.  By  convention,  prod-config.edn  is usually used.  Heroku Deployment  Heroku is a cloud service with a free hosting option. Before we start using Heroku, we need to make sure we have Git6 and Heroku Toolbelt7 installed.  Heroku  uses  the  command  specified  in  a  file  called  Procfile  to  start  up  the application. This file must be placed in the project’s root directory.  In order to run a Clojure application on Heroku, we need a Procfile that specifies the command that starts the application. Luminus generates this file for us by default:  web: java $JVM_OPTS -cp target guestbook.jar \  clojure.main -m guestbook.core  Next you need to initialize a Git repository for the application  if you haven’t already  by running the following commands:  $ git init $ git add . $ git commit -m "init"  $ heroku create  Once the repository is created, we can test the application by running foreman start in the project’s root directory. If the application starts up fine, then we’re ready to deploy it to the cloud by running the following command:  To add PostgreSQL support for the application, run this command:  $ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql  Now you can find the connection settings for the database on your Heroku dashboard. Heroku will provide configuration via environment variables. It provides PORT  and DATABASE_URL  by  default,  and  you  can  add  any  additional configuration to the environment via the Heroku dashboard. We’re now ready to push our application to Heroku.  6. 7.  http:  git-scm.com  https:  toolbelt.heroku.com   report erratum     discuss   Package the Application   341  $ git push heroku master  Once  the  upload  completes,  Heroku  will  attempt  to  build  and  deploy  your application.  If  this  process  completes  successfully,  you  should  be  able  to browse to the application URL specified in your administration console.  Docker  The final way you may want to deploy your application is by using a Docker container.8 This an industry standard for cloud deployment, and is supported by many cloud providers.  Your configuration strategy could vary dramatically based on your particular infrastructure, but the basic structure of a Dockerfile for a Clojure project is a straightforward starting point.  guestbook-tests Dockerfile FROM openjdk:11-buster COPY target uberjar guestbook.jar  guestbook app.jar COPY prod-config.edn  guestbook config.edn EXPOSE 3000 CMD ["java", "-jar", "-Dconf= guestbook config.edn", " guestbook app.jar"]  This example bundles in a configuration file, but you could set environment variables or use whatever process you wish.  guestbook-tests prod-config.edn {:port 3000 :database-url "postgresql:  localhost:5432 guestbook?user=guestbook&password=password"}  Also, you should add a STDOUT appender to the env prod resources logback.xml file so that logs are visible from docker logs.  guestbook-tests env prod resources logback.xml           <!-- encoders are assigned the type  ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder by default -->      UTF-8    %date{ISO8601} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg %n  8.  https:  docs.docker.com   report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9.

We covered many aspects of creating a real-world application during our journey, such as handling static resources, database access, Ajax, and WebSockets.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 9. Deployment   344  Although our site is functional, it clearly could use some improvements. We recommend  that  you  experiment  with  adding  new  features  or  improving existing ones to build your confidence and expand your knowledge. We also included Chapter 10, Exercises, on page 345 to help you get started.  The skills you’ve learned by building applications throughout the book should allow you to create a wide variety of web applications using Clojure. It is our hope that you’ll be able to apply these skills in building real-world applications going forward.  report erratum     discuss   CHAPTER 10  Exercises  Now that you have a complete Clojure web application under your belt, the next step is honing your ability to maintain and improve a Clojure codebase. One of the most important skills for any programmer is independent learning. New tools and libraries are constantly emerging, and users always want new and exciting features. By learning new libraries and building new features on your own, you’ll validate what you’ve learned throughout this book and build your confidence and fluency with Clojure.  How to Read this Chapter  This chapter is a collection of tasks and exerises for you to do on your own. These challenges are here for you to validate and strengthen the skills you’ve learned throughout this book. Each will be an enhancement or new feature to be added to the Guestbook application we’ve built. In addition to the exer- cises included, we encourage you to implement features that you come up with on your own.  We’ve  divided  the  exercises  into  two  categories:  Code  Quality  and  Feature Enhancements.  The Code Quality section deals with improvements to the implementation of the application with little to no change in the functionality. They are tasks that will make the application more robust, more performant, and or easier to work with.  The Feature Enhancements section is a collection of potential enhancements to  the  functionality  of  the  application.  Some  are  variations  on  features  we covered  throughout  the  book,  and  some  are  intended  as  an  independent learning  challenge.  We  will  point  you  towards  sections  of  the  book  and or external resources that may be useful in completing each task. While some  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   346  of the features may be related, you should be able to most in any order you wish. Pick a feature that appeals to you and give it a go.  We placed the Code Quality section first because they will likely make subse- quent  tasks  easier  to  complete.  However,  it  is  not  neccessary  to  complete them first. It may be more intuitive to skim the section so that you’re aware of what might be improved and then come back to them as you like.  Code Quality  This section will provide some tips on keeping the code in a good shape as you continue developing the application. We’ll cover important aspects that ensure that the application will be maintainable and extensible going forward.  Flesh out API Specification  One of the most important parts of maintaining a web application is ensuring that the API is stable and robust. There is a natural split between the client and the server across the HTTP API boundary. The front end can be seen as a separate application that communicates with the server using this API. In fact, you may wish to add other clients, such as a mobile app, in the future.  Since the front end relies on the functionality provided via the API, it acts as a contract between the client and the server. Providing a detailed schema for each  endpoint  will  help  ensure  that  the  API  is  stable  reducing  the  risk  of breaking changes as new features are added.  Throughout the development process we were very loose with our schemas because it allowed us to easily enhance and augment our application across the network boundary. We should still aim to retain this flexibility in areas we may change in the future, but fleshing out our schemas in areas we’re confident won’t change will allow us to develop new features while knowing we won’t break existing ones.  To improve the API Specification, consider the following:    Declare specs for post and user outside of guestbook.routes.services service-routes  to be shared across routes that use them    Make use of ds opt to enforce structure for optional keys   Since data-specs are just plain maps, you can leverage dissoc, assoc, select- keys,  rename-keys,  and  merge  for  cases  where  you  need  a  variation  on  a standard specification.  report erratum     discuss   Code Quality   347  Increase Test Coverage  Different types of applications have different testing requirements. There are many different test strategies out there such as unit testing, property testing, integration testing, and regression testing among others. You will typically use a combination of these strategies based on the type of the application you’re developing.  Regression testing is one of the more valuable testing strategies because it acts as a contract for the features of the application. This type of testing can be used as a contract to ensure that the application is working as intended. Having a regression test suite will make sure that new features you’re adding are not negatively impacting the existing features of the application.  Expand the test harness to include all of the API endpoints. This will help ensure that you are not introducing regressions as you add new functionality to your application.  Front-end Testing  The  client  side  of  the  application  is  the  part  that’s  visible  to  the  users. Unfortunately,  this  is  also  the  part  that’s  difficult  to  test  sinc  traditional testing of UI components is often brittle. However, there is not much value in testing the visual aspect of the UI. What we are really interested in testing is the behavior of the components. Luckily for us, re-frame provides excellent separation between the presentation and behavior of the UI. As you’ve probably noticed the behaviors present in UI components are generally restricted to observing subscriptions and disptaching events with all the business logic living behind the event API.  Therefore,  client  side  testing  should  be  focused  on  ensuring  that  re-frame events and subscriptions conform to their intended behavior. This is a similar situation that we’ve discussed with the separation between the client and the server.  As part of the exercise consider adding tests for each of the subscriptions and dispatches in the application. This will provide you with a reasonable guaran- tee that the frontend continues working as intended as you continue to extend it.  Standardize Feed Queries  The guestbook app has a lot of SQL queries with similar functionality, and the feature exercises will add even more. While we tend to favour simple SQL over  more  advanced  approaches,  it  can  be  worthwhile  to  restructure  our  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   348  database interaction layer as our model becomes more sophisticated. There are two types of approaches you can take to address this. You can leverage more advanced HugSQL features, such as snippets,1 as well as expanding your use of clojure expressions2 to make your SQL more configurable and templated. Or, you can use a declarative SQL DSL such as HoneySQL.3  Regardless of your choice, the objectives are the same:    Currently, Guestbook makes use of views to reuse query logic. This is a decent solution, but it can be inconvenient to extend. We’d like to limit the use of views, and move this generalization logic into sub-queries.    One of the core features of Guestbook is the feed. We’d like to optimize our query structure for configurable feeds, and ensure that the returned resultset’s structure is uniform. Think about the different predicates or attributes that might be used, and account for predicates you might not think of right now. You could even consider creating a small DSL for a feed that could be encoded as a JSON array or map. Check out Designing Data-Driven DSLs4 by Rafal Dittwald & James Cash for some guidance on creating your own DSL.    A  major  set  of  features  involves  universal  control  of  who  can  see  your posts and which authors you’d like to see  e.g. blocking and muting . By generalizing our queries, we should be able to effectively apply rules like these to all of our queries for posts.  Lazy Loading & Pagination  During development we never had to worry about the size of our AJAX results, but as more posts are written this could become a very important concern. We should update all of our feed queries to support pagination so that we can load only what we need. If you’ve already done {sec.feed-queries} this should be a bit easier to accomplish.  Here are some steps you can use as a guide:    Update  SQL  queries  to  accept  LIMIT  and  OFFSET.  Ensure  that  there  is  a  sensible ORDER BY for each feed.  1. 2. 3. 4.  https:  www.hugsql.org using-snippets https:  www.hugsql.org using-expressions https:  github.com seancorfield honeysql https:  www.youtube.com watch?v=j382BLptxCc  report erratum     discuss   Code Quality   349  – If  you’re  feeling  keen,  consider  what  happens  when  there  are  new posts added before the user fetches the next set of posts. How might you ensure that you don’t get any stale posts?    Accept LIMIT and OFFSET parameters from API endpoints and include ORDER  BY in each feed’s configuration.    Update re-frame events to pass appropriate LIMIT and OFFSET options, and trigger events from either navigation via a Next button, or a scroll event.  Make sure to consider how the WebSocket connection factors into this. Con- sider  updating  the  WebSocket  functionality  to  align  more  closely  with  this use pattern.  Reduce WebSocket Noise  As we alluded to in the Lazy Loading & Pagination, on page 348 exercise, our WebSocket’s live loading of new posts is pretty cumbersome. If we have a lot of  activity,  we  could  overload  our  clients  with  a  lot  of  network  traffic.  We should be more conservative about what messages we send, and to which users we send them. There are a few different aspects that could be tweaked to greatly reduce network load.  Send Messages to Users Based on Their Selected Feed  The first thing we can change to reduce noise is move our filtering logic to the  server.  We’re  unneccessarily  sending  new  messages  to  all  users  and allowing  them  to  selectively  ignore  them  if  they  aren’t  relevant.  We  should capture which feed a user is viewing, and store it along with their client ID so that we can filter messages before sending them.  Send Notifications Instead of Full Messages  Additionally, if users aren’t on the first page, new messages aren’t relevant at all. For these cases, we should just send a notification that a new message exists so that they can go back to the top of their feed if they wish.  Make Message Updates a Configurable Feature  Even  if  a  user  is  on  the  first  page,  they  may  not  want  live  loading  of  new messages. This is especially true for users on metered connections, such as cellular data. Consider adding a user setting for whether they want live mes- sages, only notifications, or no messages at all. You could even add support for no WebSocket connection at all by providing the same functionality via AJAX.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   350  Feature Enhancements  This section contains a selection of features you may wish to implement. The skills they will build are varied, and most have several valid approaches. You can tackle them in any order, but some exercises build on work done in others.  We encourage you to be creative and independent in how you choose to do these exercises, and to take our recommendations as a starting point.  Saved Posts  This  feature  would  allow  the  users  to  keep  a  list  of  saved  posts  for  quick access. This is is a common feature on many social media platforms such as Twitter  likes  and Mastodon Social  stars . Once the feature is implemented the users will see a button that will toggle whether the post appears in the list of saved posts that’s maintained for each user.  We’ve already added a more sophisticated feature of Boosting Posts, on page 277, and this feature will be very similar in terms of implementation tasks. The tasks that are required to implement this feature as follows:    Create a table to track saved posts.  – At the very minimum the table will need to contain the user id and  the id of the post that was liked.  – Write  SQL  statements  for  insertion  and  deletion  of  posts  from  the  saved posts table.    Create a route for toggling post membership in the saved list.  – This route should accept the id of the post that’s being saved, and  the user id should be read from the session on the server.    Create the route for loading the list of saved posts.  – The route will take no arguments and return the currently saved posts  for the user in the session.  – Alternatively, you could consider adding pagination where the client  will specify the offset and the number of posts to be loaded.    Create a button that toggles whether the post is saved.  – This button will appear as part of the HTML element that renders the  post and it will call the new route you’ve added to the API. – Reference guestbook.messages boost-button for a similar example.   Create a UI element that allows the users to navigate to the list.  report erratum     discuss   Feature Enhancements   351  – This could either be a button or a link in the navbar. When the user clicks this element they will be navigated to the page displaying their saved posts.    Leverage the existing component that renders the timeline to render the  – This feature can leverage the guestbook.messages message-list component.  saved posts.  Blocking Users  Sometimes users may wish to limit their interactions with others. Blocking users  is  a  common  way  to  accomplish  that.  When  a  user  decides  to  block another  user  on  the  platform  then  neither  user  should  be  able  to  view  or interact with each others posts in any way.  To accomplish this, we need to consider each side of a block. We can easily filter out posts that a user has blocked based on the user id associated with each post. On the reverse, we need to get a list of all of the users that have blocked the account and filter based on that. This should be done in the SQL query itself, as it may interfere with pagination and other features. Addition- ally, this is a security concern, so it is imperative that we filter on the server to ensure that blocked users never get access to posts they aren’t allowed to see.  This feature will require the following steps to implement:    Create a table that contains two columns that are the user id and the id  of the user they blocked.    Write SQL queries to insert and delete blocked users.   Update timeline queries to filter out any posts that contain ids from the  table of blocked users.    Update timeline queries to filter out posts by users who blocked you.   Update queries for replying, boosting, and saving to ensure that the user  is not blocked by the post author.    Create a route to list blocked users.   Create a route to toggle membership of the user in the block list.   Create a UI to list blocked users that will allow the user to unblock users  if they change their mind later.  You could also consider the option to simply mute a user or tag in which case the  content  is  simply  filtered  from  the  timeline  of  the  user  who  decides  to mute another user or a topic.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   352  Private Accounts  If a user is blocking people, we should also allow them to restrict viewing their account posts to authenticated users. In some cases, this may not be desired by the user.  e.g. if the block is simply for the purpose of preventing engage- ment.   The user will be able to toggle the status of their account as being set to private in  their  profile  settings.  Once  the  account  is  flagged  as  private  then  only accounts that already follow the account or that the account follows will be able to interact with it.  This  feature  will  have  similar  functionality  to  the  block  feature  we  just implemented. The main difference will be that it will use an inclusion instead of an exclusion list where only the users on the list are able to interact with the content.    Update user profile table to add a private boolean that will indicate whether  the account is marked as private.    Modify SQL queries for loading and interacting with posts to filter posts based on whether the account associated with the post is marked as pri- vate and the user is either following it or is followed by it.

Batch management of Follows Blocks Mutes  It is inconvenient for users to manage their follows from individual pages, so we  should  provide  a  management  section  to  remove  follows  and or  block users.  We’ve  already  discussed  the  need  to  manage  blocked  users,  and  it would make sense to expand this to a general user management page. This will list all the users that the account interacts with and will allow unfollowing, blocking, or unblocking other users in one place.    Create a new section in the account management page that will contain  three lists.    List of the users following the account.   List of the users that the account follows.   List of the users the account has blocked.  The user will be able to easily toggle their relationship with other accounts using this feature.  report erratum     discuss   Feature Enhancements   353  Queued Scheduled Posts  Allow users to write posts and schedule a specific time when they will become visible to other users. A simple approach would be to use an explicitly set created_at timestamp and update timeline queries to drop any posts where the timestamp is in the future.    Update  the  insert  statement  that  creates  posts  to  accept  an  optional timestamp. When the timestamp is provided, it will override the default.   Add a datepicker on the post creation UI that will allow the user to select  the time when the post will become visible.    Update the Ajax call to contain the timestamp when provided by the user.   Update  the  code  that  creates  the  post  to  account  for  the  timestamp  specifying the creation time.  Note that you would also want to make sure you’re handling timezones cor- rectly. The easiest solution would be to update the created_at column to be a timestamptz type. Then to make sure that you’re passing the timestamp along with the local timezone of the client.  Pinned Posts Allow User to toggle pinned status of posts on their homepage. Update query to always include them in the first page  by sorting or some other means .    Create a table that tracks pinned posts for the user. The table will contain  the user id and the post id columns.    Write a statement to insert the post id and the user id in the pinned posts  table.    Create a route that will accept the id of the post and to select the id of the user from the session, then insert them the table using the statement you defined.    Update the author posts query to select the pinned posts and prepend  them to the result.    Add a UI element on the posts that allow marking them as pinned. This  element should only be visible to the author of the post.    Add an Ajax call to toggle the membership of the post in the pinned posts  table.  DMs  Allow users to send Direct Messages to each other.    Create a direct_messages table with author, recipient, message, and created_at.   Create a statement to write a new DM.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   354    Create a query to get the message history for two users.

These are DMs after all.  Moderation  Moderation is an important feature that is integral to any social media plat- form. It involves multiple intertwined features.  Before you get started, you’ll need a roles field on the users table.    Write a migration to add the roles field, it can be either JSONB or a text  array field.  Mod Authorization Role  The  first  thing  you  need  to  do  is  create  a  moderator  auth  level  to  restrict moderation actions to moderators.

Deletion of Posts  To delete posts without ruining replies and boosts, we’ll remove the content of the post with a standard “this post was deleted” body. Additionally, we’ll remove the author reference by setting the author column to NULL. Since we permit NULL author references, this shouldn’t cause any issues.  report erratum     discuss   Feature Enhancements   355  There are a couple ways to replace the message body. The simplest would be to write a standard body into the message column. This has the downside of being easily mimicked by users, as well as being difficult to update. We could improve this by using a custom markdown transformer and prohibiting the inclusion of it in any way other than deletion.  The  more  involved  approach  would  be  to  migrate  our  posts  table  to  add  a deleted? boolean column, or a metadata JSONB column with a deleted? field. When deleting a post, the message column would still need to be cleared  e.g. replaced with an empty string , but it wouldn’t be responsible for the rendering logic itself.  Next, you have to write the post deletion SQL statement, and expose it via an API endpoint. Ensure that posts can only be deleted by their authors or by moderators. If desired, you could render the deleted post’s body differently depending on why it was deleted.  Finally, if the current user is the author of a post or a moderator, it should render a delete button.  Deletion Banning of Accounts  Similar  to  posts,  we  want  to  make  sure  that  we  scrub  all  content  without breaking anything. First and foremost we’ll delete all of their posts, then we’ll replace their account content with standard “deleted” content.  Note that the author column of the posts table has ON DELETE SET NULL. This could be a very big problem if we have a GDPR request, since the deletion of a user will make it nearly impossible to track down their posts. You should update this constraint to ON DELETE CASCADE with a migration. This will ensure that all posts with a given author will be deleted by default. If we wish to deactivate an account instead, we could do so by other means than deletion in order to preserve posts.  To build on this problem, consider implementing temporary bans, suspensions, or other disciplinary features as you see fit. This should be accomplished by updating  a  JSONB  column  on  the  user  row  with  the  details,  and  using authorization rules to prevent certain actions.  Reporting Process  Now, similar to DMs, we want a reporting process for users and or posts. These should go to a shared inbox for moderators.    Create a table for content_reports with a similar structure to DMs.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   356    It should likely contain the following:  – Offending post – Reason – Comments – Reporting User    These reports should be visible to the reporting user and all moderators   unless the offending post is authored by a moderator     Should  implement  a  DM-like  feature  with  a  distinct  conversation  per  incident.  Consider adding moderator management features, such as assigning reports to a specific moderator.  Verifying Accounts  While  we  haven’t  gone  over  email  integration,  there  are  several  libraries available for this purpose. Our preferred email library is postal.5 Refer to the documentation for the various options for setup.  E-mail can be finnicky, so try sending yourself an email from the REPL before getting bogged down with the particulars of integrating it into your app.  To associate an e-mail with an account, you can send an email with a magic link to the address provided. The magic link should contain a generated UUID that is associated with the specific account and last for a limited duration. If the user navigates to this link and successfully authenticates, then we can be sure that they do indeed own the e-mail address. Since these UUIDs are ephemeral,  they  can  be  stored  in  memory   e.g.  in  an  atom   for  simplicity. Whenever doing something in memory, be aware of the trade-offs related to application  scaling,  and  the  potential  future  need  to  move  to  a  different implementation such as creating a database table.    Generate UUID and associate it with the account  e.g. in a map of UUID    Validate e-mail setup  to userid and expiry in an atom     Create “Magic Link” route that will:  – check the UUID’s associated user and expiry, – authenticate the user, – update the user row with the verified email if they match,  5.  https:  github.com drewr postal  report erratum     discuss   Feature Enhancements   357  – and finally will clean out the UUID from the atom    Update the user account page with a field for setting & verifying an email  address    Update the user account to display verified status     Optional  - Set up a scheduled process to clean up expired UUIDs using  Java Interop  example provided below    ns guestbook.auth.verify   :require  [clojure.tools.logging :as log] [mount.core :refer [defstate]]    def registrations  atom {}    defn cleanup-stale-registrations []   :import [java.util.concurrent Executors TimeUnit ScheduledExecutorService]    ;; using a try catch is important in order not to crash the whole scheduler ;; while this won't fail with an atom, you maybe end up with failures in ;; more complex cases that interact with IO, such as if you use a table ;; with a database connection  try   swap! registrations   fn [registrations] ;; your cleanup fn      catch Exception e   log error e "error removing stale registrations"   throw e       defn schedule-reminders [scheduler]  .scheduleWithFixedDelay scheduler  cleanup-stale-registrations 0 120 TimeUnit SECONDS     defstate scheduler  :start  when  site-config :notifications?    let [scheduler   schedule-reminders scheduler  scheduler    :stop  when scheduler  .shutdown scheduler     ^ScheduledExecutorService  Executors newScheduledThreadPool 1 ]  With e-mail verification, you can reduce fake accounts and prevent people from easily circumventing moderator actions and or blocks.  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   358  For  even  stronger  protection,  you  can  try  SMS  verification  if  you’re  feeling brave.  The  principle  of  using  a  code  with  an  expiry  is  the  same,  but  it’s somewhat  harder  to  send  an  SMS  than  it  is  to  send  an  e-mail.  There  are several SMS providers with Java libraries. Select one you’d like and practice your Interop skills.  Trigger Warnings  As a special case of tags, we may want to add trigger warnings. If you did the Deletion of Accounts exercise, we will have a similar replacement of the UI, but retain the content on the server side so that it can displayed when a button is clicked. Think of different criteria a user may want to specify for placing posts behind a trigger warning. Additionally, allow authors to explicitly use the sensitive content UI component from their posts.  Consider  adding  a  custom  markdown  transformer  for  the  Sensitive Content component.  Similar to Blocking, allow users to specify a list of tags they wish to be placed behind Sensitive Content wrappers automatically.  Preventing Replies  Allow  users  to  prevent  replies  either  per-post  or  globally.  Also  consider applying auth granularity here if desired. Leverage functionality added in the Private Accounts, on page 352 and Verifying Accounts, on page 356 exercises.  There may be several options you wish to add to posts that change the way it is rendered or used. Consider adding a JSONB column for post options, and update the various endpoints and UI components to respect these options.  Consider using the same JSONB column as the Deletion of Posts, on page 354 exercise in order to keep all post visibility authorization options in one place.  Custom Feeds  Build on the functionality implemented in exercise Standardize Feed Queries, on page 347 by allowing users to create their own custom feeds. Allow feeds to be specified as JSON, and allow users to specify them with a GUI.  Some example feeds you can test against could be:    All posts tagged cats or dogs, but not sad.   All  posts  written  by  users @newsSite, @cableNews,  and @satireVegetable,  and  posts and boosts from @influencer.  report erratum     discuss   Feature Enhancements   359    All posts written by accounts I follow, but no boosts or replies, and any  posts mentioning my account.  Render feeds as a list of tabs named by the user  e.g. Cute Animals, News, About Me .  Allow users to share their feeds, and allow feeds to subscribe to other feeds.  When clicking follow on a user or tag, allow the user to specify which feeds to modify.  Postgres supports full-text search.6 You can either add this functionality, or use LIKE with a regex on post content. Add a front-end for searches. At the very least allow users to be searched by account name username.  Consider allowing specific searches for the following: - Posts - Users - Posts by user - Saved posts  Search  Metrics  Write various metrics queries for different entities in the guestbook application and render them in an appealing way.  Consider the following metrics to query:    Boosts saves of a post over time   User activity  posts boosts replies per day    New followers over time   Posts in a tag over time  Connect these metrics queries to UI elements and consider how public you wish to make them.  Trending Posts  Similar to metrics, but across all posts. Display the top performing posts and tags for the current day week.  Similarly to the example in Verifying Accounts, on page 356 have a scheduled job  that  runs  the  trending  query  each  interval   e.g.  hour,  day,  week   and updates the in-memory cached version to be returned to users.  Add a trending tab to the home page.  6.  https:  www.postgresql.org docs 12 functions-textsearch.html  report erratum     discuss   Chapter 10. Exercises   360  What You’ve Learned  Programming is a journey and we hope that we’ve helped along the way by providing a solid foundation for real world projects. The ability to learn inde- pendently  is  the  most  important  skill,  and  hopefully  the  exercises  in  this chapter helped you develop comfort using Clojure on your own. The best way to  keep  building  your  skills  going  forward  is  through  continued  practice. Perhaps the book has given you ideas for a project of your own, alternatively you could consider contributing to an existing open sources project, or perhaps to  even  start  writing  Clojure  professionally.  Whatever  path  you  choose  we hope that you’ll continue using the language in the future.  report erratum     discuss   APPENDIX 1  Clojure Primer  Since numerous books for learning Clojure are already available, I’ll keep this overview short. Even if you’re not familiar with Clojure, I hope you’ll find that most of the code in this book is easy to follow. Instead of looking at syntax in depth, I’d like to briefly go over the way Clojure programs are structured and some of the unique aspects of the language.  All the mainstream languages belong to the same family. Once you learn one of these languages, very little effort is involved in learning another. Generally, all you have to do is learn some syntax sugar and the useful functions in the standard library to become productive. You may find a new concept here and there, but most of your existing skills are easily transferable.  This is not the case with Clojure. Being a Lisp dialect, it comes from a different family  of  languages  and  requires  learning  new  concepts  in  order  to  use  it effectively. However, I assure you that Clojure is not inherently more difficult to understand, and with a bit of practice you might even feel it’s quite the opposite.  A Functional Perspective  Clojure is a functional language. This makes it extremely well positioned for writing modern applications. As the application grows, it’s imperative to be able to reason about parts of the application in isolation. It’s equally important to have code that is testable and reusable. Let’s take a look at the aspects of functional programming that facilitate these qualities.  Managing State  Functional  languages  are  ideal  for  writing  large  applications  because  they eschew global state and favor immutability as the default. When the data is  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   362  predominantly immutable, we can safely reason about parts of the application in isolation.  “Immutable data structures” might sound like a strange idea at first. However, many of the benefits associated with functional languages are directly facili- tated by them. Let’s look at what makes these data structures such a powerful tool.  In most languages, data can be passed around either by value or by reference. Passing data by value is safe since we know that any changes we make to the data will not have any effect outside the function. However, it’s also pro- hibitively  expensive  in  many  cases,  so  any  substantial  amount  of  data  is passed around by reference. This makes code more difficult to reason about, as  you  have  to  know  all  the  places  where  a  piece  of  data  is  referenced  to update it safely.  Immutable data structures provide us with a third option. Every time a change is made to a data structure, a new revision is created. The price we pay when altering the data is proportional to the size of the change. When a piece of data is no longer referenced, it simply gets garbage-collected.  Instead of having to manually track every reference to a piece of data, we can offload this work to the language runtime. This allows us to effectively “copy” data  any  time  we  make  a  change  without  having  to  worry  about  where  it comes from or what the scope of our change will be.  Having such data structures facilitates writing pure functions. A pure function is  simply  a  function  that  has  no  side  effects.  Since  such  functions  can  be reasoned  about  in  isolation,  the  applications  written  using  such  functions are composed of individual self-contained components. This type of code is referred to as being referentially transparent.  Achieving Code Reuse  Object-oriented languages tend to have strong coupling between the data and the functions that operate on it. In this scenario we can’t easily reuse methods written in one class when we have a similar problem that we need to solve in another.  This problem does not exist in a functional language because the logic and the  data  are  kept  separate.  The  language  provides  a  small  set  of  common data structures, such as lists, maps, and sets. All the functions operate on these data structures; and when we come to a new problem, we can easily reuse any function we write.  report erratum     discuss   Data Types   363  Each function represents a certain transformation that we wish to apply to our data. When we need to solve a problem, we simply have to understand the sequence of transformations and map those to the appropriate functions. This style of code is referred to as declarative.  Declarative  code  separates  what  is  being  done  from  how  it  is  done.  For example, when we wish to iterate over a collection, we use an iterator function. The logic that we want to execute on each step of the iteration is passed in as a parameter.  One  important  advantage  of  this  style  is  that  we  benefit  from  having  code reuse at the function level. An iterator function can be written once to handle the edge cases and boundary checks. We can now reuse this logic without having to worry about remembering to do these checks time and again.  Leveraging Multiprocessing  Functional code also makes it easier to tackle the difficult problems of paral- lelism and concurrency. While there is no silver bullet for addressing either problem, the language can certainly make it easier to reason about them.  Since pure functions depend solely on their arguments, they do not rely on any shared state and can be safely computed in parallel. This means we can easily parallelize many algorithms to take advantage of the extra cores. An example of this is mapping a function over the items in a collection. We can start  by  writing  a  version  using  the map  function.  Should  we  discover  that each operation takes a significant amount of time, then we can simply switch to using pmap to run the operations in parallel.  Meanwhile,  the  immutable  data  structures  provide  an  excellent  tool  for managing shared state. Clojure provides a Software Transactional Memory  STM  API based on these data structures. With transactional memory we no longer have to worry about manual locking when dealing with threads. Addi- tionally, the data only needs to be locked for writing. Since the existing data is immutable, it can be read safely even while an update is happening.  Data Types  Clojure provides a number of data types, most of which are unsurprising:    Vars provide mutable storage locations. These can be bound and rebound  on a per-thread basis.    Booleans can have a value of true or false; nil values are also treated as false.   Numbers can be integers, doubles, floats, or fractions.  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   364    Symbols are used as identifiers for variables.   Keywords are symbols that reference themselves and are denoted by a colon;  these are often used as keys in maps.    Strings are denoted by double quotes and can span multiple lines.   Characters are denoted by a preceding backslash.   Regular expressions are strings prefixed with a hash symbol.  In addition to the data types, Clojure provides a rich set of standard collec- tions. These include lists, vectors, maps, and sets.    List:  1 2 3    Vector: [1 2 3]   Map: {:foo "a" :bar "b"}   Set: {"a" "b" "c"}  Interestingly, Clojure logic is written using its data structures. Using the same syntax for both data and logic allows for powerful metaprogramming features. We can manipulate any piece of Clojure code just like we would any other data structure. This feature makes it trivial to template the code for recurring patterns in your problem domain. In Clojure, code is data and data is code.  Using Functions  Function calls in Clojure work the same as any mainstream languages such as  Python.  The  main  difference  is  that  the  function  name  comes  after  the parenthesis in the Clojure version.  functionName param1, param2   function-name param1 param2   This difference can be explained very simply. The function call is just a list containing the function name and its parameters. In Clojure, a list is a special type of data structure reserved for creating callable expressions. To create a list data structure, we have to call the list function:   list 1 2 3   Anonymous Functions  As the name implies, anonymous functions are simply functions that aren’t bound to a name. Let’s take a look at the following function that accepts a single argument and prints it.   fn [arg]  println arg    report erratum     discuss   Named Functions   365  The function is defined by using the fn form followed by the vector containing its argument and the body. We could call the preceding function by setting it as the first item in a list and its argument as the second.    fn [arg]  println arg   "hello"  =>"hello"  Clojure provides syntactic sugar for defining anonymous functions using the  notation. With it we can rewrite our function more concisely:  Here, the % symbol indicates an unnamed argument. If the function accepted multiple arguments, then each one would be followed by a number indicating its position. This can be seen in the next example:   println %    println %1 %2 %3   The preceding anonymous function accepts three arguments and prints them out in order. This type of function is useful when you need to perform a one- off operation that doesn’t warrant defining a named function. These functions are often used in conjunction with the higher-order functions that we’ll look at in a moment.  Named Functions  Named functions are simply anonymous functions bound to a symbol used as an identifier. Clojure provides a special form called def that’s used for cre- ating global variables. It accepts a name and the body to be assigned to it. We can create a named function by using def as follows:   def square  fn  [x]  * x x      Since creating these variables is such a common operation, Clojure provides a special form called defn that does this for us:   defn square [x]   * x x    The first argument to defn is the name of the function being defined. It is fol- lowed by a vector containing the arguments and the body of the function. In the preceding code, we passed in a single item for the body; however, we could pass as many items as we like.   defn bmi [height weight]   println "height:" height   println "weight:" weight     weight  * height height     report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   366  Here we define a function to calculate BMI using the height and weight parameters. The body consists of two print statements and a call to divide the weight by the square of the height. All the expressions are evaluated from the inside out. In the last statement,  * height height  is evaluated, then the weight is divided by the result and returned. In Clojure, mathematical operators  such as   and *  are regular functions, so we call them using the prefix notation as we would with any other function.  Note that only the result from the last expression is returned from the function; the results of all the other expressions are discarded. Therefore, any interme- diate expressions should strictly be used for side effects, as is the case with the preceding println calls.  Clojure uses a single-pass compiler. For this reason, the functions must be declared before they are used. In the case where we need to refer to a function before it’s been defined, we must use the declare macro to provide a forward declaration.   declare down   defn up [n]   if  < n 10    down  + 2 n   n     defn down [n]  up  dec n     As you might have noticed, the code structure is a tree. This tree is called the abstract syntax tree, or AST for short. This is the same AST that the compiler sees when compiling the code. By being able to see the AST directly, we can visualize the relationships between pieces of logic.  Since we write our code in terms of data, we have fewer syntactic hints than in  most  languages.  For  example,  we  have  no  explicit  return  statements. Instead, the last expression of the function body is returned implicitly. This might  take  a  little  getting  used  to  if  you’re  accustomed  to  seeing  a  lot  of annotations in your code. To aid readability, functions are often kept short  five lines or less is a good rule of thumb , while indentation and spacing are used for grouping code visually.  Clojure makes no distinction between functions and variables. You can assign a function  to  a  label,  pass  it  as  a  parameter,  or  return  a  function  from  another function. Functions that can be treated as data are referred to as being first-class because they don’t have any additional restrictions attached to them.  report erratum     discuss   Higher-Order Functions   367  Higher-Order Functions  Functions  that  take  other  functions  as  parameters  are  called  higher-order functions. One example of such a function is map:   map  * % %  [1 2 3 4 5]  => 1 4 9 16 25   Here we pass in two parameters to the map function. The first parameter is an anonymous function that squares its argument and the second is a collec- tion  of  numbers.  The  map  function  visits  each  item  in  the  collection  and squares it. One advantage of using higher-order functions is that we don’t have  to  worry  about  boundary  conditions,  such  as nil  checks.  The  iterator function handles these for us.  Another example of a higher-order function is filter  . This function goes through a collection and keeps only the items matching the condition specified.  You can, of course, chain these functions together to solve problems:   filter even? [1 2 3 4 5]  => 2 4    filter even?   map  * 3 %  [1 2 3 4 5]    => 6 12   Here we multiply each item by 3 and then we use filter   to keep only the even items from the resulting sequence.  Thanks to higher-order functions, you should practically never have to write loops or explicit recursion. When you need to iterate over a collection, use a function such as map or filter instead. Since Clojure has a rich standard library, practically  any  data  transformation  can  be  achieved  by  a  combination  of several higher-order functions.  Instead of having to learn a lot of different language features and syntax, you simply have to learn the functions in the standard library. Once you learn to associate data transformations with specific functions, many problems can be solved by simply putting them together in the right order.  Here is a real-world example of this idea. The problem is to display a formatted address  given  the  fields  representing  it.  Commonly  an  address  has  a  unit number, a street, a city, a postal code, and a country. We’ll have to examine each of these pieces, remove the nil and empty ones, then insert a separator between them.  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   368  Let’s say we have a table in our database that contains the following fields:  unit ""   street  "1 Main Street"  Toronto  nil   postal_code  country  Canada   city  Given the preceding data as strings, we would like to output the following formatted string:  1 Main Street, Toronto, Canada  All we have to do is find the functions for the tasks of removing empty fields, interposing the separator, and concatenating the result into a string:   defn concat-fields [& fields]   clojure.string join ", "  remove empty? fields      concat-fields "" "1 Main Street" "Toronto" nil "Canada"  => "1 Main Street, Toronto, Canada"  The & notation in the preceding parameter definition states that the function accepts a variable number of arguments. The arguments are represented by a list inside the function body.  Notice that we didn’t have to specify how to do any of the tasks when writing our code. Most of the time we simply say what we’re doing by composing the functions  representing  the  operations  we  wish  to  carry  out.  The  resulting code also handles all the common edge cases:   concat-fields  => ""  concat-fields nil  => ""  concat-fields ""  => ""  Closures  We’ve now seen how we can declare functions, name them, and pass them as parameters to other functions. One last thing we can do is write functions that return other functions as their result. One use for this is to provide the functionality facilitated by constructors in object-oriented languages.  Let’s say we wish to greet our guests warmly. We can write a function that accepts the greeting string as its parameter and returns a function that takes the name of the guest and prints a customized greeting for that guest:   defn greeting [greeting-string]   fn [guest]   println greeting-string guest      greet "Jane"   greet "John"     let [greet  greeting "Welcome to the wonderful world of Clojure" ]  report erratum     discuss   Threading Expressions   369  The inner function in the greeting has access to the greeting-string value since the value is defined in its outer scope. The greeting function is called a closure because it closes over its parameters—in our case the greeting-string—and makes them available to the function that it returns.  You’ll also notice that we’re using a form called let to bind the greet symbol and  make  it  available  to  any  expressions  inside  it.  The let  form  serves  the same purpose as declaring variables in imperative languages.  Threading Expressions  By this point you’ve probably noticed that nested expressions can be difficult to read. Fortunately, Clojure provides a couple of helper forms to deal with this problem. Let’s say we have a range of numbers, and we want to increment each number, interpose the number 5 between them, and then sum the result. We could write the following code to do that:   reduce +  interpose 5  map inc  range 10      It’s  a  little  difficult  to  tell  what’s  happening  in  the  preceding  example  at  a glance. With a few more steps in the chain, we’d be really lost. On top of that, if  we  wanted  to  rearrange  any  of  the  steps,  such  as  interposing  5  before incrementing, then we’d have to re-nest all our expressions. An alternative way to write this expression is to use the ->> form:   ->>  range 10   map inc   interpose 5   reduce +    Here, we use ->> to thread the operations from one to the next. This means that we implicitly pass the result of each expression as the last argument of the next one. To pass it as the first argument, we’d use the -> form instead.  Being Lazy  Many  Clojure  algorithms  use  lazy  evaluation,  where  the  operations  aren’t performed  unless  their  result  actually  needs  to  be  evaluated.  Laziness  is crucial for making many algorithms work efficiently. For example, you might think the preceding example is very inefficient since we have to iterate over the  sequence  each  time  to  create  the  range,  map  across  it,  interpose  the numbers, and reduce the result.  However,  this  is  not  actually  the  case.  The  evaluation  of  each  expression happens on demand. The first value in the range is generated and passed to the function, then the next, and so on, until the sequence is exhausted. This is similar to the approach that languages like Python take with their iterator mechanics.  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   370  Structuring the Code  One  nontrivial  difference  between  Clojure  and  imperative  languages  is  the way  the  code  is  structured.  In  imperative  style,  it’s  a  common  pattern  to declare a shared mutable variable and modify it by passing it different func- tions. Each time we access the memory location, we see the result of the code that previously worked with it. For example, if we have a list of integers and we wish to square each one and then print the even ones, the following Python code would be perfectly valid:  l = list range 1, 6   for i, val in enumerate l  :  l[i] = val * val  for i in l :  if i % 2 == 0 :  print i    run! println   filter  =  mod % 2  0    map  * % %   range 1 6       ->>  range 1 6    map  * % %    filter  =  mod % 2  0    run! println    In Clojure this interaction has to be made explicit. Instead of creating a shared memory location and then having different functions access it sequentially, we chain functions together and pipe the input through them:  Or, as we’ve covered, we could use the ->> macro to flatten the operations:  Each function returns a new value instead of modifying the existing data in place. You may think that this can get expensive, and it would be with a naïve implementation, where the entirety of the data is copied with every change.  In  reality,  Clojure  is  backed  by  persistent  data  structures  that  create  in- memory revisions of the data.1 Each time a change is made, a new revision is created proportional to the size of the change. With this approach we only pay the price of the difference between the old and the new data structures while ensuring that any changes are inherently localized.  1.  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Persistent_data_structure  report erratum     discuss   Destructuring Data   371  Destructuring Data  Clojure  has  a  powerful  mechanism  called  destructuring  for  declaratively accessing values in data structures. If you know the data structure’s type, you can describe it using a literal notation in the binding. Let’s look at some examples of what this means.   let [[small big]  split-with  < % 5   range 10  ]   println small big    => 0 1 2 3 4   5 6 7 8 9   Here  we  use  the  split-with  function  to  split  a  range  of  ten  numbers  into  a sequence containing two elements: numbers less than 5 and numbers greater than or equal to 5. The split-with function returns a sequence containing two elements: the first is the sequence of items that are less than 5, and the other is the sequence that is greater than or equal to 5. Since we know the result’s format, we can write it in a literal form as [small big] and then use these named elements within the let binding.  We can use this type of destructuring in function definitions as well. Let’s say we have a function called print-user that accepts a vector with three items. It names the items name, address, and phone, respectively.   defn print-user [[name address phone]]   println name address phone     print-user ["Bob" "12 Jarvis street, Toronto" "416-987-3417"]   We can also specify variable arguments as a sequence in cases where a vari- able  number  of  arguments  can  be  supplied.  This  is  done  by  using  the ampersand followed by the name for the argument list.  Since the variable arguments are stored in a sequence, it can be destructured like any other.   defn foo [& args]  println args    foo "a" "b" "c"  => a b c    defn foo [first-arg & [second-arg]]   println  if second-arg  "two arguments were passed in" "one argument was passed in"      foo "bar"  =>"one argument was passed in"  foo "bar" "baz"  =>"two arguments were passed in"  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   372  Destructuring can also be applied to maps. When destructuring a map, we create a new map where we supply the names for the local bindings pointing to the keys from the original map:   let [{foo :foo bar :bar} {:foo "foo" :bar "bar"}]   println foo bar   It’s possible to destructure a nested data structure as well. As long as you know the data’s structure, you can simply write it out.   let [{[a b c] :items id :id} {:id "foo" :items [1 2 3]}]   println id " has the following items " a b c    Finally, since extracting keys from maps is a very common operation, Clojure provides syntactic sugar for this task.   defn login [{:keys [user pass]}]  and  = user "bob"   = pass "secret"     login {:user "bob" :pass "secret"}   Another  useful  destructuring  option  allows  us  to  extract  some  keys  while preserving the original map.   defn register [{:keys [id pass repeat-pass] :as user}]   cond   nil? id  "user id is required"  not= pass repeat-pass  "re-entered password doesn't match" :else user    Namespaces  When writing real-world applications, we need tools to organize our code into separate  components.  Object-oriented  languages  provide  classes  for  this purpose. The related methods are all defined in the same class. In Clojure, we group our functions into namespaces instead. Let’s look at how a names- pace is defined.   ns colors   defn hex->rgb [[_ & rgb]]   map  ->> %  apply str "0x"   Long decode     partition 2 rgb      defn hex-str [n]   ->  format "%2s"  Integer toString n 16     clojure.string replace " " "0"      defn rgb->hex [color]   apply str ""  map hex-str color     report erratum     discuss   Namespaces   373  Preceding, we have a namespace called colors containing three functions called hex->rgb, hex-str, and rgb->hex. The functions in the same namespace can call each other directly. However, if we wanted to call these functions from a dif- ferent namespace we would have to reference the colors namespace there first. Clojure provides two ways to do this: we can use either the :use or the :require keyword.  The :use Keyword When we reference a namespace with :use, all its vars become implicitly avail- able, as if they were defined in the namespace that references it.   ns myns   :use colors     hex->rgb "33d24f"   This approach has two downsides. We don’t know where the function was originally defined, making it difficult to navigate the code, and if we reference two namespaces that use the same name for a function, we’ll get an error.  We can address the first problem by selecting the functions we wish to use explicitly using the :only keyword in our :use declaration.   ns myns   :use [colors :only [rgb->hex]]     defn hex-str [c]   println "I don't do much yet"    This way we document where rgb->hex comes from and we’re able to declare our own hex-str function in the myns namespace without conflicts. Note that rgb->hex still uses the hex-str function defined in the colors namespace.  The :require Keyword The approach of using the :require keyword to reference the namespace provides us with more flexible options. Let’s look at each of these.  We can require a namespace without providing any further directives. In this case, any calls to vars inside it must be prefixed with the namespace declara- tion indicating their origin.   ns myns   :require colors     colors hex->rgb "324a9b"   report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   374  This  approach  is  explicit  about  the  origin  of  the vars  being  referenced  and ensures that we won’t have conflicts when referencing multiple namespaces. One problem is that when our namespace declaration is long, it gets tedious to have to type it out any time we wish to use a function declared inside it. To  address  this  problem,  the  :require  statement  provides  the  :as  directive, allowing us to create an alias for the namespace.   ns myotherns   :require [colors :as c]     c hex->rgb "324a9b"   We can also require functions from a namespace by using the :refer keyword. This is synonymous with the :use notation we saw earlier. To require all the functions from another namespace, we can write the following:   ns myns   :require [colors :refer :all]    If we wish to select what functions to require by name, we can instead write this:   ns myns   :require [colors :refer [rgb->hex]    As you can see, a number of options are available for referencing vars declared in other namespaces. If you’re not sure what option to pick, then requiring the namespace by name or alias is the safest route.  Clojure provides support for declaring dynamic variables that can have their value changed within a particular scope. Let’s look at how this works.  Dynamic Variables   declare ^:dynamic *foo*   println *foo*  =>    binding [*foo* "I exist!"]   println *foo*    =>"I exist!"  Here we declare *foo* as a dynamic var and don’t provide any value for it. When we try to print *foo*, we get an error indicating that this var has not been bound to any value. Let’s look at how we can assign a value to *foo* using a binding.  We set *foo* to a string with value “I exist!” inside the binding. When the println function is called within the binding, we no longer get an error when trying to print its value.  report erratum     discuss   Polymorphism   375  This technique can be useful when dealing with resources such as file streams, database  connections,  or  scoped  variables.  In  general,  the  use  of  dynamic variables is discouraged since they make code more opaque and difficult to reason  about.  However,  they  have  legitimate  uses,  and  it’s  worth  knowing how they work.  Polymorphism  One useful aspect of object orientation is polymorphism; while polymorphism happens to be associated with that style, it’s in no way exclusive to object- oriented programming. Clojure provides two common ways to achieve runtime polymorphism. Let’s look at each of these in turn.  Multimethods  Multimethods provide an extremely flexible dispatching mechanism using a selector function associated with one or more methods. The multimethod is defined using defmulti, and each method is defined using defmethod. For example, if we had different shapes and we wanted to write a multimethod to calculate the area, we could do the following:   defmulti area :shape   defmethod area :circle [{:keys [r]}]   * Math PI r r     defmethod area :rectangle [{:keys [l w]}]   * l w     defmethod area :default [shape]   throw  Exception.  str "unrecognized shape: " shape       area {:shape :circle :r 10}  => 314.1592653589793  area {:shape :rectangle :l 5 :w 10}  => 50  Preceding,  the  dispatch  function  uses  a  keyword  to  select  the  appropriate method  to  handle  each  type  of  map.  This  works  because  keywords  act  as functions  and  when  passed  a  map  return  the  value  associated  with  them. The dispatch function can be as sophisticated as we like, however.   defmulti encounter   fn [x y] [ :role x   :role y ]     defmethod encounter [:manager :boss] [x y]  :promise-unrealistic-deadlines    defmethod encounter [:manager :developer] [x y]  :demand-overtime   report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   376   defmethod encounter [:developer :developer] [x y]  :complain-about-poor-management    encounter {:role :manager} {:role :boss}  => :promise-unrealistic-deadlines  Protocols allow defining an abstract set of functions that can be implemented by a concrete type. Let’s look at an example protocol:   defprotocol Foo  "Foo doc string"  bar [this b] "bar doc string"   baz [this] [this b] "baz doc string"    As you can see, the Foo protocol specifies two methods, bar and baz. The first argument to the method is the object instance followed by its parameters. Note that the baz method has multiple arity. We can now create a type that implements the Foo protocol using the deftype macro:  Here we create type Bar that implements protocol Foo. Each method prints out some of its parameters. Let’s see what it looks like when we create an instance of Bar and call its methods:   deftype Bar [data]  Foo  bar [this param]   println data param     baz [this]   println  class this      baz [this param]   println param      let [b  Bar. "some data" ]   .bar b "param"   .baz b   .baz b "baz with param"    some data param Bar baz with param  The  first  method  call  prints  out  the  data  Bar  was  initialized  with  and  the parameter that was passed in. The second method call prints out the object’s class, while the last method call demonstrates the other arity of baz.  We  can  also  use  protocols  to  extend  the  functionality  of  existing  types, including  existing  Java  classes.  For  example,  we  can  use  extend-protocol  to extend the java.lang.String class with the Foo protocol:  report erratum     discuss   What About Global State?   377   extend-protocol Foo String  bar [this param]  println this param     bar "hello" "there"  =>"hello there"  The preceding examples illustrate the basic principles of how protocols can be used to write polymorphic code. However, protocols have many other uses as well, and I encourage you to discover these on your own.  What About Global State?  While predominantly immutable, Clojure provides support for shared mutable data as well via its STM library.2 The STM ensures that all updates to mutable variables are done atomically. There are two major kinds of mutable types: the atom and the ref. The atom is used in cases where we need to do uncoordi- nated updates, and the ref is used when we might need to do multiple updates as a transaction.  Let’s look at an example of defining an atom and using it.   def global-val  atom nil    We’ve defined an atom called global-val, and its current value is nil. We can now read its value by using the deref function, which returns the current value.   println  deref global-val   =>nil  Since this is a common operation, there is a shorthand for deref: the @ symbol. So writing  println @global-val  is equivalent to the preceding example. Let’s look at two ways of setting a new value for our atom. We can either use reset! and pass in the new value, or we can use swap! and pass in a function that accepts the current value and updates it.   reset! global-val 10   println @global-val  =>10  swap! global-val inc   println @global-val  =>11  2.  http:  clojure.org concurrent_programming  Note that both swap! and reset! end in exclamation points  ! ; this convention indicates that these functions operate on mutable data.  report erratum     discuss   We define a ref the same way we define an atom, but the two are used rather differently. Let’s take a quick look at a concrete example of how a ref is used.  Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   378   def names  ref []    dosync   ref-set names ["John"]   alter names  if  not-empty %    conj % "Jane"  %     The preceding code defines a ref called names and then opens a transaction using a dosync statement. Inside the transaction, the names are set to a vector with the value “John”. Next, the alter function is called to check if names is not empty and to add “Jane” to the vector of names when that’s the case.  Note that since this is happening inside a transaction, the check for emptiness depends on the existing state along with any state built up within the same transaction. If we tried to add or remove a name in a different transaction, it would have no visible effect on ours. In case of a collision, one of the transac- tions would end up being retried.  Writing Code That Writes Code for You  Because  Clojure  is  a  dialect  of  Lisp,  it  provides  a  powerful  macro  system. Macros  allow  for  templating  of  repetitive  blocks  of  code  and  for  deferring evaluation, among numerous other uses. A macro works by treating code as data instead of evaluating it. This allows us to manipulate the code tree just like any other data structure.  Macros execute before compile time, and the compiler sees the result of macro execution. Because of this level of indirection, macros can be difficult to reason about, and thus it’s best not to use them when a function will do the job.  However,  macros  have  legitimate  uses,  and  it’s  worth  understanding  how they work. In this book we use very few macros, so we’ll only touch on their syntax superficially.  Let’s look at a concrete example of a macro and see how it differs from the regular code we saw previously. Imagine that we have a web application with a  session  atom  that  might  contain  a  user.  We  might  want  to  load  certain content only if a user is present in the session and not otherwise.   def session  atom {:user "Bob"}    defn load-content []  if  :user @session   "Welcome back!" "please log in"    report erratum     discuss   Writing Code That Writes Code for You   379  This works, but it’s tedious and error-prone to write our if statement every single time. Since our condition’s logic stays the same, we can template this function as follows:   defmacro defprivate [name args & body]  ` defn ~ symbol name  ~args   if  :user @session    do ~@body  "please log in"     The macros are defined using the defmacro special form. The major difference between defn  and defmacro  is  that  the  parameters  passed  to defmacro  are  not evaluated by default.  To evaluate the parameter, we use the tilde, as we’re doing with ~ symbol name . Using the ~ notation indicates that we’d like to replace the name with the value it refers to. This is called unquoting.  The ~@ notation used in  do ~@body  is called unquote splicing. This notation is used when we’re dealing with a sequence. The contents of the sequence are merged into the outer form during the splicing. In this case body consists of a list representing the function’s body. The body must be wrapped in a do block because the if statement requires having no more than two arguments. The backtick  `  sign means that we wish to treat the following list as data instead of executing it. This is the opposite of unquoting, and it’s referred to as syntax-quoting.  As I mentioned earlier, the macros are executed before evaluation time. To see what the macro will be rewritten as when the evaluator sees it, we can call macroexpand-1.   macroexpand-1 ' defprivate foo [greeting]  println greeting     clojure.core defn foo [greeting]   if  :user  clojure.core deref session     do  println greeting   "please log in"    You can see that  defprivate foo  println "bar"   gets rewritten with a function defini- tion that has the if statement inside. This resulting code is what the evaluator sees, and it’s equivalent to what we would have to write by hand otherwise. Now  we  can  simply  define  a  private  function  using  our  macro,  and  it  will check for us automatically.   defprivate foo [message]  println message    foo "this message is private"   report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   380  The preceding example might seem a little contrived, but it demonstrates the power of being able to easily template repetitions in code. This allows you to create  a  notation  that  expresses  your  problem  domain  using  the  language natural to it.  The Read-Evaluate-Print Loop  Another big aspect of working in Clojure is the read-evaluate-print loop  REPL . In many languages you write the code, and then you run the entire program to see what it does. In Clojure, most development is done interactively using the REPL. In this mode we can see each piece of code we write in action as soon as it’s written.  In nontrivial applications it’s often necessary to build up a particular state before you can add more functionality. For example, a user has to log in and query some data from the database, and then you need to write functions to format and display this data. With a REPL you can get the application to the state where the data is loaded and then write the display logic interactively without having to reload the application and build up the state every time you make a change.  This  method  of  development  is  particularly  satisfying  because  you  see immediate feedback when making changes. You can easily try things out and see  what  approach  works  best  for  the  problem  you’re  trying  to  solve.  This encourages experimentation and refactoring of the code as you go, which in turn helps you to write better and cleaner code.  Calling Out to Java  One last thing that we’ll cover is how Clojure embraces its host platform to benefit from the rich ecosystem of existing Java libraries. In some cases we may wish to call a Java library to accomplish a particular task that doesn’t have a native Clojure implementation. Calling Java classes is very simple and follows the standard Clojure syntax fairly closely.  Importing Classes When we wish to use a Clojure library, we employ :use and :require statements. However,  when  we  wish  to  import  a  Java  class,  we  have  to  use  the :import statement.   ns myns  :import java.io.File    report erratum     discuss   Calling Methods   381  We can also group multiple classes from the same package in a single import, as follows:   ns myns  :import [java.io File FileInputStream FileOutputStream]    Instantiating Classes To create an instance of a class, we can call new just as we would in Java.  We could also use a common shorthand for creating new objects:   new File "."    File. "."   Calling Methods  Once we have an instance of a class, we can call methods on it. The notation is similar to making a regular function call. When we call a method, we pass the  object  its  first  parameter,  followed  by  any  other  parameters  that  the method accepts.   let [f  File. "." ]  println  .getAbsolutePath f     Here  we’ve  created  a  new  file  object f  and  we’ve  called .getAbsolutePath  on  it. Notice that methods have a period  .  in front of them to differentiate them from  regular  Clojure  functions.  If  we  wanted  to  call  a  static  function  or  a variable in a class, we would use the   notation, as follows:   str File separator "foo" File separator "bar"   Math sqrt 256   We can also chain multiple method calls together using the double period  ..  notation as our shorthand. Say we wanted to get the string indicating the file path and then get its bytes; we could write the code for that in two ways:   .getBytes  .getAbsolutePath  File. "."     ..  File. "."  getAbsolutePath getBytes   The second notation looks more natural and is easier to read. Although there is other syntactic sugar for working with Java, the preceding is sufficient for following the material we cover in this book.  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 1. Clojure Primer   382  Reader Conditionals  The last feature of Clojure that we’ll cover are reader conditionals. Clojure has three official dialects, with Clojure JVM, ClojureScript, and Clojure CLR. While  core  Clojure  functions  work  largely  the  same  across  these  dialects, some platform-specific code can vary. Reader conditionals were introduced in Clojure 1.7 to allow mixing code that targets multiple platforms in the same source file.  The  only  rule  is  that  source  files  using  reader  conditionals  must  use  cljc extension. Let’s say we have a util.cljc file that contains some utility functions that use platform-specific interop. For example, let’s write a function to return the current time in milliseconds that can be cross-compiled to Clojure and ClojureScript.   defn current-time []  ? :clj  .getTime  java.util.Date.    :cljs  .getTime  js Date.      The current-time function uses ? syntax to declare a reader conditional, and specifies the code that should be emitted for Clojure and ClojureScript using :clj  and :cljs  keywords  respectively.  When  the  namespace  is  compiled,  code using java.util.Date will be used for Clojure and code using js Date will be used for ClojureScript.  ;; Clojure  defn current-time []   .getTime  java.util.Date.     ;; ClojureScript  defn current-time []   .getTime  js Date.     Another useful conditional flag is ?@, which allows splicing a collection into the outer form when compiling. For example, if we wanted to conditionally require specific namespaces based on whether we were compiling Clojure or ClojureScript, then we could do the following.   :require [clojure.string :as string] ?@ :clj  [[clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]] [clojure.java.io :as io]]  :cljs [[cljs.pprint :refer [pprint]]  [cljs.reader :as reader]]    report erratum     discuss   The  code  inside  the  vectors  specified  under  the  :clj  and  :cljs  keys  will  be expanded  into  the  outer  :require  form  resulting  in  the  following  code  being compiled for each dialect.  Summary   383  ;; Clojure  :require [clojure.string :as string] [clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]] [clojure.java.io :as io]  ;; ClojureScript  :require [clojure.string :as string] [cljs.pprint :refer [pprint]] [cljs.reader :as reader]]   That’s all there is to it. You may also wish to refer to the official documenta- tion3 regarding more advanced uses of reader conditionals.  Summary  This concludes our tour of Clojure basics. Altogether we touched on only a small portion of the overall language. But if you understand the preceding examples, then you should have no trouble following any of the code in the rest of the book. Once you have your development environment up and run- ning, don’t hesitate to try out the examples shown here in the REPL and play around with them until you feel comfortable moving on.  3.  https:  clojure.org guides reader_conditionals  report erratum     discuss   APPENDIX 2  Editor Configuration  In this appendix, we’ll cover the most popular code editors for working with clojure. We’ll also discuss why you should configure editor integration and structural editing, along with some tips for best using them.  While you may see recommendations for a specific editor, such as Emacs, there  are  a  number  of  excellent  Clojure  environments  avaiable.  If  you’re already familiar with one of the editors listed here, we recommend sticking with it to avoid the distraction of switching editors while also learning Clojure. If you aren’t familiar with any of these, it is possible that your favourite editor has some Clojure support. However, if you experience difficulty configuring your  favourite  editor,  we  recommend  going  with  either  VS  Code  or  IntelliJ IDEA.  Why is Editor Integration So Important?  In other  non-lisp  languages, it is common to work with any text editor of choice,  or  with  a  language-specific  IDE.  However,  with  Clojure  and  most other lisps having an editor integrated REPL along with structural editing is invaluable.  The Clojure REPL  You may be familiar with the concept of a REPL if you’ve used languages such as Ruby or Python. However, REPL environments in these languages function very different from the Clojure REPL. Typically, the REPL will be used as a standalone toy as opposed to an integral part of the development process. The REPL in such languages does not connect to the runtime of the application you’re developing or provide any meaningful integration with your editor.  By contrast, the REPL is a central tool for developing Clojure applications. The REPL is typically used by connecting your editor to the application runtime  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 2. Editor Configuration   386  and sending code for evaluation directly from the editor. This approach allows developing applications interactively and creates a tight feedback loop where you can see the changes that you make in code immediately reflected in your application.  Structural Editing  Another lisp trait that shines through in Clojure is the S-Expression. Code written in S-Expressions is relatively free of syntax, and maps well onto units of  computation.  Rather  than  working  with  lines  of  code  as  text,  we  can manipulate  programs  more  semantically.  As  a  side  benefit,  since  we  are manipulating s-expressions themselves, our parentheses will never become imbalanced through structural edits.  If you’ve never worked with a lisp before, structural editing can take a bit of adjustment. Still, we promise it will be worth it many times over.  Some  commands  you  should  be  familiar  with  are  listed  below  in  order  of importance. You can find some pretty cool animations of them online here.1  Structural Navigation & Selection  Move to sibling, parent, and child forms  Shrink and expand selection for parenthesis-aware cutting and pasting  Slurp & Barf  Wrap & Unwrap  Join & Split  Raise & Splice  Unfortunate naming aside, slurp and barf are the most basic operations.  They will add or remove a form to the current s-expression respectively.  They can each be performed forwards or backwards.  Adds removes parentheses from the current S-expression.  They  do  exactly  what  their  names  imply,  with  the  added  feature  of respecting types in Clojure.  Raise replaces the outer S-expression with the current one.  Splice merges the current S-expression into the outer one.  1.  http:  danmidwood.com content 2014 11 21 animated-paredit.html  report erratum     discuss   General Configuration Tips   387  General Configuration Tips  Regardless of the editor you choose, you should ensure that you are able to do the following operations, and should probably add a keybinding for each:    Connect to a running application’s nREPL   Evaluate expressions in the connected REPL from the editor   Load a file namespace in the REPL   Each of the Structural Editing Commands listed above  VSCode + Calva  Calva2 is a great choice for developers who user VS Code as their editor of choice.

If you don’t currently have a preference we would suggest trying Calva as your first editor. Follow the instructions in the official documentation in order to get up and running.  IntelliJ IDEA + Cursive  Cursive,3 a popular Clojure IDE based on the IntelliJ platform, and it’s an excellent  choice  for  anybody  who’s  already  using  IntelliJ.

We recommend only using emacs if you are either a current emacs user, or are a vim user unsatisfied with the vim ecosystem’s support of Clojure. If you do choose to use Emacs, be warned that there is a lot of power in configuration that comes at the cost of some serious complexity.  If you’re coming from Vim, you should start with either Spacemacs or Doom Emacs. They both have great support for vim emulation, or what is affection- ately  called evil-mode  in  the  emacs  community.

This  appendix  will  provide  a  brief  introduction  to  these  two  data  formats, along with some common usage examples.  EDN  EDN, or Extensible Data Notation, is a data format based on Clojure’s data structure  literal  syntax.  It  includes  keywords,  symbols,  strings,  numbers, lists, sets, vectors, and maps as covered in Appendix 1, Clojure Primer, on page 361, along with tags.  Tags are the core differentiator for EDN and are why it is called Extensible Data Notation.  Tagged Literals EDN uses the  character as a dispatch, allowing the subsequent form to be parsed in a special way. For example _ is discard, this tells the parser to ignore the form that follows. Any  dispatch that has one or more alphabetic char- acters after it  e.g. uuid  is a tag. This tells the parser to transform the subse- quent form based on the tag’s implementation. The built-in uuid tag converts a string representation of a UUID into the environment’s underlying UUID  1. 2. 3. 4.  https:  github.com edn-format edn https:  github.com cognitect transit-format https:  www.json.org json-en.html https:  msgpack.org index.html  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 3. Working with EDN and Transit    390  implementation  e.g. java.util.UUID . The inst tag similarly parses string repre- sentations of instants in time.  In addition to the built-in tags, users can specify their own. Any consumers of EDN that contains these custom tags must have the implementation defined in order to parse correctly, but there is a default TaggedLiteral type that simply contains the tag name along with the form itself.  Adding your own tags  To specify a custom EDN reader you simply pass a map of tag symbols to reader functions like so:   require '[clojure.edn :as edn]   defn parse-my-ratio [{:keys [numerator denominator]}]     numerator denominator     edn read-string  {:readers {'my ratio parse-my-ratio}} "{:foo \"bar\" :ratio my ratio {:numerator 1 :denominator 2}}"   ;; => {:foo "bar" :ratio 1 2}  You can include as many custom readers as you like, but keep in mind that only namespaced tag symbols are officially supported.  Transit  Transit has feature parity with EDN, but has some slight quirks because it is more optimized and it is more commonly used across different environments. Most notably, the default tags are different from EDN.  Here’s an example of a reader writer pair for a  “LocalDate” type in Clojure taken from luminus-transit.5  ;; In Clojure  require '[cognitect.transit :as transit]   import '[java.time LocalDate]  '[java.io ByteArrayInputStream ByteArrayOutputStream] '[java.time.format DateTimeFormatter]    def read-handlers {"LocalDate"   transit read-handler  java.time.LocalDate parse %   DateTimeFormatter ofPattern "yyyy-MM-dd"   }    def write-handlers  {java.time.LocalDate  transit write-handler  5.  https:  github.com luminus-framework luminus-transit  report erratum     discuss   Transit   391   constantly "LocalDate"   .format %  DateTimeFormatter ofPattern "yyyy-MM-dd"   }    def out  ByteArrayOutputStream. 4096    transit write  transit writer out :json {:handlers write-handlers}    LocalDate of 2020 12 31     println  .toString out   ;; => ["~LocalDate", "2020-12-31"]  println   transit read   transit reader  ByteArrayInputStream.  .toByteArray out    :json {:handlers read-handlers}     ;; object[java.time.LocalDate 0x56198302 2020-12-31]  By passing our read-handlers to transit reader and our write-handlers to transit writer, we can now read and write our custom LocalDate tag. We’d do the exact same thing in ClojureScript, only with implementations for goog.date.Date instead of java.time.LocalDate. By following this process with whatever types you need to support, you can easily serialize and transport them over the network and between environments. Check out luminus-transit’s full implementation of transit readers and writers here.6  6.  https:  github.com luminus-framework luminus-transit blob master src luminus_transit time.cljc  report erratum     discuss   APPENDIX 4  Database Access  In  this  appendix,  we’ll  cover  how  to  work  with  the  PostgreSQL  relational databases using the next.jdbc library. We’ll then discuss how to write a simple application to generate a PDF report from database records that will teach you about serving binary content in your web application.  Work with Relational Databases  By virtue of running on the Java Virtual Machine, Clojure works with any database that can be accessed via Java Database Connectivity  JDBC .1 With it, we can easily access a large number of RDBMS databases, such as MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and Oracle. The core library for dealing with rela- tional databases is next.jdbc. When using this library we have to write custom SQL for each type of database we intend to use.  There are several libraries available for working with next.jdbc. One such library that  we’ll  cover  in  this  chapter  is  called  HugSQL.2  This  library  takes  the approach of keeping the SQL separate from the Clojure source files.  Another  popular  library  is  called  Honey  SQL.3  This  library  represents  SQL queries using Clojure data structures. The advantage of this approach is that we can manipulate and compose the queries directly in Clojure.  We’ll start by seeing how to use the clojure.java.jdbc library, since it provides all the functionality we need without any additional complexity. If you choose to use a different database engine, be aware that there might be slight syntac- tic  differences  in  our  SQL  queries.  Before  we  start  working  through  the  1. 2. 3.  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Java_Database_Connectivity http:  www.hugsql.org  https:  github.com seancorfield honeysql  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   394  examples in this chapter, make sure you have an instance of the PostgreSQL database available in order to follow along.  Setting Up the PostgreSQL Database  Installing PostgreSQL is quite straightforward. If you’re using OS X, then you can simply run Postgres.app.4 On Linux, you can install PostgreSQL from your package manager. For example, if you’re using Ubuntu, you can run sudo apt- get install postgresql. You may also need to modify the pg_hba.conf file to enable password-based authentication.5  Once PostgreSQL is installed, we set the password for the user postgres using the psql shell. The shell can be invoked by running the psql command from the console.  sudo -u postgres psql postgres \password postgres  With the default user set up, let’s create an admin user with the password set to admin.  CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'admin';  Then we can create a schema called REPORTING to store our reports by running the following command:  CREATE DATABASE REPORTING OWNER admin;  Note  that  we’re  using  the admin  user  here  to  save  time.  You  should  always create  a  dedicated  user  and  grant  only  the  necessary  privileges  for  any database you wish to run in production.  Accessing the Database  $ lein new db-examples  We’ll start by creating a new project called db-examples by running Leiningen.  To  access  the  database,  we  need  to  include  the  necessary  libraries  in  our project.clj file. We need to reference the seancorfield next.jdbc library as well as the driver for the database we’re accessing. Because we are using PostgreSQL, we require the following dependencies:  db-examples project.clj  defproject db-examples "0.1.0"  :description "examples of using next.jdbc"  4. 5.  http:  postgresapp.com  https:  fedoraproject.org wiki PostgreSQLpg_hba.conf  report erratum     discuss   Work with Relational Databases   395  :dependencies [[org.clojure clojure "1.10.1"]  [seancorfield next.jdbc "1.1.613"] [org.postgresql postgresql "42.2.8"]]   With that in place, we’ll navigate to the db-examples.core namespace and reference the  next.jdbc  library  the  same  way  we  did  in  the  examples  in  Chapter  1, Getting Your Feet Wet, on page 1.  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  ns db-examples.core   :require  [next.jdbc :as jdbc] [next.jdbc.sql :as sql] [next.jdbc.result-set :as rs]    Next, we need to define our database connection. We can do this in several ways. Let’s look at the pros and cons of the different options.  Defining a Parameter Map  The simplest way to define a connection is to provide a map of connection parameters.  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  def ds  jdbc get-datasource  {:subprotocol "postgresql" :subname "  localhost reporting" :user "admin" :password "admin"}    In the preceding example, we’ve defined a connection for an instance of the PostgreSQL database by specifying the database type suing :dbtype key and a name using the :dbname key.  This  method  is  the  most  common  approach  for  declaring  the  connection information.  In  a  real-world  application,  the  values  should  be  read  from  a configuration file or from the environment instead of being hard-coded.  The map with the connection specification is passed to the next.jdbc get-datasource function in order to create an instance of the JDBC datasource.  Specifying the Driver Directly  Another option is to provide a JDBC data source and configure it manually. This option is useful if we wish to specify any driver-specific parameters not accessible through the idiomatic parameter map configuration.   def db  {:datasource   doto  PGPoolingDataSource.   report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   396   .setServerName "localhost"   .setDatabaseName "my_website"   .setUser "admin"   .setPassword "admin"   .setMaxConnections 10  }   Creating Tables We can create tables programmatically by calling the create-table-ddl function and  providing  it  the  table  name,  followed  by  the  columns  and  their  types. Let’s write a function to create a table to store user records, where each record has an ID and a password.  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  defn create-users-table! [ds]   jdbc execute! ds  ["create table users    id varchar 32  primary key, pass varchar 100   "]    db-examples.core=>  create-users-table! ds  [:next.jdbc{:update-count 0}]  Here, next.jdbc execute! function is called to create a users table. The function takes a datasource followed by a keyword specifying the table name, and a vector with strings containing SQL statements.  Selecting Records To select records from our database, we use the query function. It accepts the connection and a vector containing the SQL string followed by its arguments, and it returns a result as a lazy sequence. This function allows us to work with  the  returned  data  without  having  to  load  the  entire  result  set  into memory.  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  defn get-user [ds id]   first  sql query ds ["select * from users where id = ?" id]     db-examples.core=>  get-user "foo"  nil  In the preceding code, we’ve created a function that accepts the user ID as its argument and returns the first item from the result set. Note that we’re using a parameterized query by specifying a vector containing the prepared statement string followed by its parameters. This approach should always be used in order to prevent SQL injection attacks.  report erratum     discuss   Work with Relational Databases   397  Inserting Records  A number of options are available for inserting records into the database. If we have a map whose keys match the names of the columns in the table, then we can simply use the insert! function.  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  defn add-user! [ds user]   sql insert! ds :users user    db-examples.core=>  add-user! ds {:id "foo" :pass "bar"}  nil  Now that we’ve created a user with :id foo, get-user will return it:  db-examples.core=>  get-user ds "foo"  :USERS{:ID "foo", :PASS "bar"}  Notice that the result is a map qualified with the name of the table that the records were selected from, and the column names are upper cased. This can be toggled by wrapping the datasource with additional options. In case we didn’t wish to qualifiy the result or upper case the column names we could provide a hint as follows:  db-examples.core=>  get-user   jdbc with-options ds  _=> _=> _=>  "foo"   {:builder-fn rs as-unqualified-lower-maps}   {:id "foo", :pass "bar"}  If we wish to insert multiple records simultaneously, we can pass a vector of maps to the insert-multi! function instead. This function accepts a datasource followed by the table name, a vector containing the column IDs that we wish to insert, and a vector of vectors representing the column values.  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  defn add-users! [ds users]   sql insert-multi! ds :users [:id :pass] users    db-examples.core=>  add-users! ds  _=> _=>  [["bar" "secret"] ["baz" "secret"]]   []  Updating Existing Records To update an existing record, use the update! function. The function expects to be passed the connection, followed by the table name, the map representing the updated rows, and the WHERE clause represented by a vector.  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   398  Deleting Records Records can be deleted from the database using the delete! function.  We use transactions when we want to run multiple statements and ensure that the statements are executed only if all of them can be run successfully. If any statement fails, then the transaction is rolled back to the state prior to running any of the statements.  db-examples.core=>  jdbc with-transaction [t-conn ds]  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  defn set-pass! [ds id pass]   sql update!  ds :users {:pass pass} ["id=?" id]    db-examples.core=>  set-pass! ds "bar" "baz"  :next.jdbc{:update-count 1} db-examples.core=>  get-user ds "bar"  :USERS{:ID "bar", :PASS "baz"}  db-examples src db_examples core.clj  defn remove-user! [ds id]   sql delete! ds :users ["id=?" id]    db-examples.core=>  remove-user! ds "foo"  :next.jdbc{:update-count 1} db-examples.core=>  get-user ds "foo"  nil  Transactions  _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=>   sql update! t-conn :users {:pass "foo"} ["id=?" "bar"]    sql update!  t-conn :users {:pass "foo"} ["id=?" "baz"]    db-examples.core=>  get-user "bar"  :USERS{:ID "bar", :PASS "fooz"} db-examples.core=>  get-user "baz"  :USERS{:ID "baz", :PASS "fooz"}  report erratum     discuss   db-examples.core=>  jdbc with-transaction [t-conn ds]  Use HugSQL   399  _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=>   sql update!  t-conn :users {:pass "ROLLBACK"} ["id=?" "bar"]    sql insert!  t-conn :users {:id "bar"}    Execution error  JdbcSQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException  at ... Unique index or primary key violation:  "PUBLIC.PRIMARY_KEY_4 ON PUBLIC.USERS ID  VALUES 2";  SQL statement: INSERT INTO users  id  VALUES  ?  [23505-199] db-examples.core=>  get-user "bar"  :USERS{:ID "bar", :PASS "fooz"}  As can be seen in the preceding code, we use the with-transaction macro to create a transactional connection that is used inside the transaction. The [t-conn db] part of the macro creates a binding the same way a let statement does. All the statements wrapped by with-transaction must use the t-conn connection to execute the  queries.  Should  all  the  statements  complete  successfully,  then  the transaction is committed.  Use HugSQL  The major advantage of using HugSQL is that it allows us to write the SQL queries in separate files instead of having to embed strings in our code. This has a number of advantages, such as allowing us to use SQL tools to edit the queries.  Getting Things Done with HugSQL  HugSQL provides a flexible DSL for generating the functions for running SQL queries. We’ll start by seeing how we can define a single query in a file and then create a function from it using the def-db-fns macro. Let’s place the query in the resources find_user.sql file in our project.  db-examples resources users.sql -- :name add-user! :! :n -- :doc adds a new user INSERT INTO users  id, pass  VALUES  :id, :pass   report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   400  HugSQL  uses  specially  formatted  SQL  comments  as  metadata  for  defining functions that interact with the database. The name of the function that runs the query is defined using the -- :name comment.  The name of the function is followed by flags indicating the SQL command and the result. The preceding query uses the :! flag to indicate that the function modifies the data, and the :n key to indicate that it returns the number of rows that were affected.  HugSQL supports the following command flags and defaults to :? when none is specified.    :query or :?—Indicates a query with a result set   :execute or :!—Can be used for any statement   :returning-execute or :<!—Is used to indicate an INSERT ... RETURNING query   :insert or :i!—Will attempt to return the generated keys  The result flag is used to indicate the type of result that is returned by the query. The result defaults to :raw when none is specified.    :one or :1—A result with a single row   :many or :*—A result with multiple rows   :affected or :n—The number of affected rows   :raw—The result generated by the underlying database adapter  The only things to note about the SQL statement itself are the placeholder keys for the VALUES. HugSQL uses these keys to look up the parameters in the input map when the generated function is called.  Now that we’ve defined a query, let’s create a new namespace called db-exam- ples.hugsql with the following content:  db-examples src db_examples hugsql.clj  ns db-examples.hugsql   :require [db-examples.core :refer [db]]  [next.jdbc :as jdbc] [hugsql.core :as hugsql]     hugsql def-db-fns "users.sql"   We can now call add-user! just like any other function, and the comment iden- tified by the -- :doc flag is available as its doc string.  db-examples.hugsql=>  add-user! db {:id "hug" :pass "sql"}  1  report erratum     discuss   Use HugSQL   401  The function accepts the database connection as its first parameter, followed by the query map. Note that the keys in the map have the same names as those we defined earlier in the users.sql file. The connection we’re using is the one that we defined earlier for our clojure.java.jdbc examples.  In case we wanted to return the fields from the record that was created, we could write the following query:  adds a new user returning the id  db-examples resources users.sql -- :name add-user-returning! :i :1 -- :doc INSERT INTO users  id, pass  VALUES  :id, :pass  returning id  We have to rerun the def-db-fns macro to load the new query. Then we can run the generated function as follows:  db-examples.hugsql=>  add-user-returning! db {:id "hug2" :pass "return"}  {:id "hug2"}  Note that support for the returning queries is database-driver dependent: some drivers do not facilitate returning the result of the insert query.  A tuple list can be used to do a multirecord insert. Let’s update the users.sql file by adding the following query there:  db-examples resources users.sql -- :name add-users! :! :n -- :doc add multiple users INSERT INTO users  id, pass  VALUES :t*:users  The :t* flag indicates that the users key is a vector of records to insert. Each record is described by a vector where the value matches the position of the parameter in the INSERT statement. We can now insert multiple users using the function we defined, as follows:  db-examples.hugsql=>  add-users! db {:users  _=> _=>  [["bob" "Bob"] ["alice" "Alice"]]}   2  We can now query the users by adding the following query:  db-examples resources users.sql -- :name find-user :? :1 -- find the user with a matching ID  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   402  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = :id  When we call the function, it should return a single map that represents the record when it’s found and a nil result when it’s not.  db-examples.hugsql=>  find-user db {:id "bob"}  {:id "bob", :pass "Bob"} db-examples.hugsql=>  find-user db {:id "nobody"}  nil  HugSQL supports in-list queries, where we can provide a vector of values as the  parameter.  The  SQL  query  uses  the  :v*  flag  to  indicate  the  value  list parameter. Let’s add a new file called resources find_user.sql and place the following query there:  db-examples resources users.sql -- :name find-users :? :* -- find users with a matching ID SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN  :v*:ids   The function parameters now consist of a map with the key :ids that points to a vector of IDs that we want to match.  db-examples.hugsql=>  find-users db {:ids ["alice" "bob" "nobody"]}   {:id "bob", :pass "Bob"} {:id "alice", :pass "Alice"}   It’s also worth noting that we can easily mix it with clojure.java.jdbc. For example, if we wanted to run queries in a transaction, then we’d use the with-db-transaction macro to wrap the calls to HugSQL-generated functions, as seen here:  db-examples src db_examples hugsql.clj  defn add-user-transaction [user]   jdbc with-transaction [t-conn db]   if-not  find-user t-conn {:id  :id user }    add-user! t-conn user      db-examples.hugsql=>  add-user-transaction {:id "cheryl"  :pass "Cheryl"}   1 db-examples.hugsql=>  add-user-transaction {:id "alice"  _=>  _=>  :pass "I already exist"}   nil  As we’ve seen, HugSQL is a very flexible library that allows us to define queries in a clean and intuitive way, without having to mix the SQL sources with our Clojure code. We’ve covered the core features of HugSQL, but it’s worth noting  report erratum     discuss   Generate Reports   403  that it provides many features that can facilitate for advanced use cases. I urge you to explore the official documentation to see what they are.  Generate Reports  In this section we’ll cover how to generate reports from the data we collect in our database using the clj-pdf library.6 Then we’ll discuss how to serve the generated PDF to the browser using the appropriate response type.  Our application will have an employee table that will be populated with some sample data. We’ll use this data to create a couple of different PDF reports, and we’ll allow the users to select the type of report they wish to view. Let’s create a new application called reporting-example using the Luminus template.  $ lein new luminus reporting-example +postgres  Now we open the project.clj file to add the clj-pdf dependency.  :dependencies [...  [clj-pdf "2.5.5"]]  We also have to remember to update the database URL with the dev-config.edn file as follows:  reporting-example dev-config.edn {:dev true :port 3000 ;; when :nrepl-port is set the application starts the nREPL server on load :nrepl-port 7000 ; set your dev database connection URL here :database-url "jdbc:postgresql:  localhost reporting?user=admin&password=admin"}  Now  let’s  update  our  migrations  files,  found  in  the resources migrations  folder. The “up” file creates the employee table, while the “down” file removes it.  CREATE TABLE employee  name VARCHAR 50 , occupation VARCHAR 50 , place VARCHAR 50 , country VARCHAR 50  ;  DROP TABLE employee;  lein run migrate  6.  https:  github.com yogthos clj-pdf  With our migrations set up, run this command to initialize the database:  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   404  Let’s navigate to the namespace called reporting-example.db.core and see what we have there.  Luminus uses the conman library to handle external database connections. The library takes care of connection pooling and provides the connect! and dis- connect! functions for managing the life cycle of the connection.7  When we generated our guestbook project, we used an embedded H2 database. In that case we created the data source that was passed to the conman connect! function explicitly. Now that we’re using an external database, the data source is specified declaratively using a map. The library knows how to create an instance of the PostgreSQL data source given this map.  Serializing and Deserializing Data Based on Its Type You’ll note that the namespace comes with a couple of extend-protocol definitions. Extending the next.jdbc.result-set ReadableColumn protocol allows us to deserialize the column types returned by the database while extending the next.jdbc.pre- pare SettableParameter protocol allows us to serialize custom column types.  reporting-example src clj reporting_example db core.clj  defn pgobj->clj [^org.postgresql.util.PGobject pgobj]   let [type  .getType pgobj   value  .getValue pgobj ]   case type  "json"  parse-string value true  "jsonb"  parse-string value true  "citext"  str value  value      extend-protocol next.jdbc.result-set ReadableColumn  java.sql.Timestamp  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Timestamp v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Timestamp v _2 _3]   .toLocalDateTime v     .toLocalDateTime v    java.sql.Date  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Date v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Date v _2 _3]   .toLocalDate v     .toLocalDate v    java.sql.Time  read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Time v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Time v _2 _3]   .toLocalTime v     .toLocalTime v    java.sql.Array  7.  https:  github.com luminus-framework conman  report erratum     discuss   Generate Reports   405   read-column-by-label [^java.sql.Array v _]   read-column-by-index [^java.sql.Array v _2 _3]   vec  .getArray v      vec  .getArray v     org.postgresql.util.PGobject  read-column-by-label [^org.postgresql.util.PGobject pgobj _]   read-column-by-index [^org.postgresql.util.PGobject pgobj _2 _3]   pgobj->clj pgobj     pgobj->clj pgobj     The  java.sql.Timestamp,  java.sql.Date,  and  java.sql.Time  types  are  converted  to  the java.time.LocalDateTime, java.time.LocalDate, and java.time.LocalTime types respectively. The java.sql.Array is deserialized into a vector. Finally, org.postgresql.util.PGobject is de-serialized as either JSON or text based on its type.  Conversely,  the next.jdbc.prepare SettableParameter  protocol  allows  us  to  serialize Clojure maps and vectors into PostgreSQL JSON types.  reporting-example src clj reporting_example db core.clj  defn clj->jsonb-pgobj [value]   doto  PGobject.    .setType "jsonb"   .setValue  generate-string value       extend-protocol next.jdbc.prepare SettableParameter  clojure.lang.IPersistentMap  set-parameter [^clojure.lang.IPersistentMap v  ^java.sql.PreparedStatement stmt ^long idx]   .setObject stmt idx  clj->jsonb-pgobj v     clojure.lang.IPersistentVector  set-parameter [^clojure.lang.IPersistentVector v ^java.sql.PreparedStatement stmt ^long idx]   let [conn meta type-name  .getParameterTypeName meta idx ]   .getConnection stmt   .getParameterMetaData stmt    if-let [elem-type  when  =  first type-name  \_    apply str  rest type-name   ]   .setObject stmt idx  .createArrayOf conn elem-type  to-array v     .setObject stmt idx  clj->jsonb-pgobj v        This use of the IResultSetReadColumn and ISQLValue protocols allows us to keep all the type coercions in one place, instead of having to remember to do them each time we need to store or retrieve a value.  Now that we’ve looked at all the database code that’s been generated, let’s start the REPL in this namespace and create the table that we’ll be working with by running the following commands in it.  user=>  in-ns 'reporting-example.db.core   report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   406  object[clojure.lang.Namespace 0x6233bca8 "reporting-example.db.core"] reporting-example.db.core=>  mount.core start 'env '*db*  {:started ["'reporting-example.config env"  "'reporting-example.db.core *db*"]} reporting-example.db.core=>  sql insert-multi!  _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=>  *db* :employee [:name :occupation :place :country] [["Albert Einstein", "Engineer",  "Ulm", "Germany"] ["Alfred Hitchcock", "Movie Director", "London", "UK"] ["Wernher von Braun", "Rocket Scientist", "Wyrzysk", "Poland"] ["Sigmund Freud", "Neurologist", "Pribor", "Czech Republic"] ["Mahatma Gandhi", "Lawyer", "Gujarat", "India"] ["Sachin Tendulkar", "Cricket Player", "Mumbai", "India"] ["Michael Schumacher", "F1 Racer", "Cologne", "Germany"]]   Note we’re passing the *db* and env vars to mount.core start in the example. This ensures that mount only starts the specified state.  Finally, we write the query to read the records from the table.  reporting-example resources sql queries.sql -- :name read-employees :? :* -- reads the list of employees select * from employee  Let’s run the conman bind-connection statement to reinitialize the query functions and call the read-employees function it generates. We should see the following in the REPL console:  reporting-example.db.core=>  conman bind-connection *db* "sql queries.sql"  {:snips {}, :fns {:read-employees {:meta {...}, :fn object[...]}}} reporting-example.db.core=>  read-employees   {:name "Albert Einstein", :occupation "Engineer", :place "Ulm", :country "Germany"} {:name "Alfred Hitchcock", :occupation "Movie Director", :place "London", :country "UK"} ...   report erratum     discuss   Generate Reports   407  Notice that the result of calling read-employees is simply a list of maps where the keys are the names of the columns in the table. Let’s see how we can use this to create a PDF with a table listing the employees in our database.  Generating the Reports  The clj-pdf library uses syntax similar to Hiccup’s to define the elements in the document. The document itself is represented by a vector. The document vector must contain a map representing the metadata as its first element. The metadata is followed by one or more elements representing the document’s content.  Let’s  create  a  namespace  called  reporting-example.reports  and  look  at  a  few examples of creating PDF documents. We’ll use the pdf function to create the reports and the template macro to format the input data. We’ll also reference the  reporting-example.db.core  namespace  so  that  we  can  call  the  read-employees function later on.  reporting-example src clj reporting_example reports.clj  ns reporting-example.reports   :require [reporting-example.db.core :as db]  [clj-pdf.core :refer [pdf template]]    The pdf function accepts two arguments. The first can be either a vector rep- resenting the document or an input stream from which the elements are read. The second can either be a string representing the output file name or an output stream.  Let’s  generate  our  first  PDF  by  running  the  following  code  in  the  reporting- example.reports namespace:  reporting-example.reports=>  pdf  _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=>  [{:header "Wow, that was easy"} [:list [:chunk {:style :bold} "a bold item"] "another item" "yet another item"] [:paragraph "I'm a paragraph!"]] "doc.pdf"   nil  As you can see, the report consists of vectors, each starting with a keyword identifying the type of element, followed by the metadata and the content. In the preceding report we have a list that contains three rows, followed by a paragraph. The PDF will be written to a file called doc.pdf in our project’s root. The contents of the file should look like the following figure:  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   408  Next, let’s see how we can use the template macro to format the employee data into a nice table. This macro uses $ to create anchors to be populated from the data using keys of the same name.  The template returns a function that accepts a sequence of maps and applies the  supplied  template  to  each  element  in  the  sequence.  In  our  case,  since we’re building a table, the template is simply a vector with the names of the keys for each cell in the row. Let’s add the following template to the reporting- example.reports namespace:  reporting-example src clj reporting_example reports.clj  def employee-template   template [$name $occupation $place $country]    Let’s try it out in the REPL:  reporting-example.reports=>  employee-template  take 2  db read-employees     ["Albert Einstein" "Engineer" "Ulm" "Germany"] ["Alfred Hitchcock" "Movie Director" "London" "UK"]   It looks like our template works as expected. Let’s use it to generate a report containing the full list of our employees:  reporting-example.reports=>  pdf  [{:header "Employee List"}  into [:table  _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=>  {:border false :cell-border false :header [{:backdrop-color [0 150 150]} "Name" "Occupation" "Place" "Country"]}]   employee-template  db read-employees   ]  nil  "report.pdf"   The resulting report should look like the following figure:  report erratum     discuss   Generate Reports   409  Of course, the template we used for this report is boring. Let’s look at another example. Here we output the data in a list and style each element:  reporting-example src clj reporting_example reports.clj  def employee-template-paragraph   template [:paragraph [:heading {:style {:size 15}} $name] [:chunk {:style :bold} "occupation: "] $occupation "\n" [:chunk {:style :bold} "place: "] $place "\n" [:chunk {:style :bold} "country: "] $country [:spacer]]    Let’s create a report using employee-template-paragraph by running the following:  reporting-example.reports=>  pdf [{} [:heading {:size 10} "Employees"] [:line] [:spacer]  employee-template-paragraph   db read-employees  ]  "report.pdf"   _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=> _=>  nil  Our new report should look like the following figure:  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   410  Displaying the Reports  Now that we’ve created a couple of reports on our data, let’s see how we can serve them from our application. Let’s write the functions to create the list and the table reports using the preceding examples:  reporting-example src clj reporting_example reports.clj  defn table-report [out]   let [data  db read-employees ]   pdf [{:header "Employee List"}  when-not  empty? data    into [:table  {:border false :cell-border false :header [{:backdrop-color [0 150 150]}  "Name" "Occupation" "Place" "Country"]}]   employee-template  db read-employees    ]  out      defn list-report [out]   pdf [{} [:heading {:size 10} "Employees"] [:line] [:spacer]  employee-template-paragraph  db read-employees  ] out    report erratum     discuss   We update our page to provide links to both types of reports.  Generate Reports   411  reporting-example resources html home.html {% extends "base.html" %} {% block content %}        Select report type:         List reports         Table reports        {% if error %}  An error has occurred while generating the report:   {{error}}  {% endif %}       {% endblock %}  Next,  we  navigate  to  reporting-example.routes.home  and  add  some  references needed to create the report route.  reporting-example src clj reporting_example routes home.clj  ns reporting-example.routes.home   :require [reporting-example.layout :as layout] [reporting-example.db.core :as db] [clojure.java.io :as io] [clojure.tools.logging :as log] [reporting-example.middleware :as middleware] [ring.util.http-response :as response] [reporting-example.reports :as reports]    We also update the home function to serve the page without passing it any parameters.  reporting-example src clj reporting_example routes home.clj  defn home-page [request]   layout render request "home.html"    Now we write a function to generate the response. We create an input stream using  a  supplied  byte  array  and  set  it  as  the  response.  We  also  set  the appropriate  headers  for  the  content  type,  the  content  disposition,  and  the length of the content.  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 4. Database Access   412  reporting-example src clj reporting_example routes home.clj  defn write-response [report-bytes]   with-open [in  java.io.ByteArrayInputStream. report-bytes ]   ->  response ok in    response header "Content-Disposition" "filename=document.pdf"   response header "Content-Length"  count report-bytes    response content-type "application pdf"      Next we write another function to generate the report. This function creates a ByteArrayOutputStream that is used to store the report. Then it calls one of our report-generation functions with it. Once the report is generated, we call write- response with the contents of the output stream.  reporting-example src clj reporting_example routes home.clj  defn generate-report [{:keys [path-params] :as request}]   try   let [report-type  :report-type path-params  out  java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream. ]   condp =  keyword report-type   :table  reports table-report out   reports list-report out   :list  write-response  .toByteArray out      catch Exception ex   log error ex "failed to render report!"   layout render request "home.html" {:error  .getMessage ex }      Last but not least, we create a new route to serve our reports.  reporting-example src clj reporting_example routes home.clj  defn home-routes []  ["" {:middleware [middleware wrap-csrf  middleware wrap-formats]}  [" " {:get home-page}] [" about" {:get about-page}] [" report :report-type" {:get generate-report}]]   You should now be able to navigate to http:  localhost:3000 and select a link to one of the reports. When you click on the link, the corresponding report is served.  What You’ve Learned  This covers the basics of working with relational databases. You’ve now learned how to do the basic database queries and manage the connection life cycle, and you’ve written a reporting application that serves binary content in action. As we’ve covered in this chapter, database records are easily mapped to Clojure data structures. Therefore, the Clojure community largely sees object-relational mapping libraries as unnecessary.  report erratum     discuss   APPENDIX 5  Writing RESTful Web Services with Liberator  In this appendix we’ll cover how to use the Liberator library to generate our application end points.1  Using Liberator  Liberator is a Clojure library for writing RESTful services modeled after web- machine,2 a popular service framework for Erlang. Its primary feature is that it puts a strong emphasis on decoupling the front end from the back end of your application.  Conceptually,  Liberator  provides  a  clean  way  to  reason  about  your  service operations. Each request passes through a series of conditions and handlers defined  in  the  resource.  These  map  to  the  codes  specified  by  the  HTTP RFC 2616, such as 200-OK, 201-created, 404-not found, and so on.  This approach makes it very easy to write standards-compliant services and to group the operations logically. It also means that your services will auto- matically  use  the  appropriate  HTTP  codes  associated  with  a  particular response.  Due to its focus on the separation of the front-end and back-end logic, Liber- ator  is  a  natural  choice  for  writing  many  types  of  web  applications.  These include general-purpose services, single-page applications, and applications that might have nonweb clients, such as mobile applications.  1. 2.  http:  clojure-liberator.github.io liberator  https:  github.com basho webmachine  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 5. Writing RESTful Web Services with Liberator   414  In  this  section  we’ll  cover  how  to  create  a  simple  application  that  serves static  resources,  provides  basic  session  management,  and  handles  service operations.  We’ll create a new application called liberator-service using a Leiningen tem- plate  called  reagent-template.  This  template  is  less  opinionated  than  the Luminus template and therefore it provides a better starting point for Libera- tor-based applications.  lein new reagent liberator-service  Once the application is created, we need to add Liberator, Cheshire, and cljs- ajax dependencies to our project.clj dependencies vector:3  :dependencies [ ...  [cheshire "5.10.0"] [liberator "0.15.3"] [cljs-ajax "0.8.0"]]  Cheshire  is  a  fast  and  easy-to-use  JSON  parsing  library.  We’ll  use  it  for parsing the requests from the client and generating the responses.  The application generated by the template contains a file called src clj liberator_ser- vice handler.clj that contains the routes for the application. The home-page function generates the HTML using the Hiccup HTML templating library. The syntax is the same as the Reagent HTML templating syntax we covered previously.  Defining Resources  Liberator uses the concept of resources to interact with the client. The resources are simply Ring-compliant handlers that can be used inside your Reitit routes. These resources are defined using the resource and the defresource macros. We need to reference these functions in the liberator-service.handler namespace in order to start working with Liberator.   ns liberator-service.handler   :require ... [liberator.core :refer [defresource resource]]    Now we can update our route handler to use a liberator resource to serve the HTML page:  liberator-snippets home.clj  defn loading-page [request]   html5   head   3.  https:  github.com dakrone cheshire  report erratum     discuss   Defining Resources   415  [:body {:class "body-container"} mount-target  include-js " js app.js" ]     def app   reitit-ring ring-handler   reitit-ring router  [[" " {:get  resource  :handle-ok loading-page :etag "fixed-etag" :available-media-types ["text html"] }]]    reitit-ring routes   reitit-ring create-resource-handler {:path " " :root " public"}   reitit-ring create-default-handler    {:middleware middleware}    This allows the Liberator resource to handle the request type. Let’s start the app by running the following command and navigating to http:  localhost:3000  in the browser. We should see the home page displayed, advising us to start Figwheel in order to compile ClojureScript.  Say we want to name the resource handler; we can use defresource instead:  lein run  liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource home   def app   reitit-ring ring-handler   reitit-ring router  [[" " {:get home}]]    reitit-ring routes  :handle-ok loading-page :etag "fixed-etag" :available-media-types ["text html"]    reitit-ring create-resource-handler {:path " " :root " public"}   reitit-ring create-default-handler    {:middleware middleware}    The request in the preceding route is simply a map that’s described in What’s in the Request Map, on page 33.  A set of keys defined by the Liberator API represents each resource type for different types of actions that follow. A key can fall into one of four categories:    Decision   Handler   Action   Declaration  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 5. Writing RESTful Web Services with Liberator   416  Each key can be associated with either constants or functions. The functions should  accept  a  single  parameter  that  is  the  current  context  and  return  a variety of responses.  The context parameter contains a map with keys for the request, the resource, and optionally the representation. The request key points to the Ring request. The resource represents the current state of the resource, and the represen- tation contains the results of content negotiation.  Let’s take a close look at each category and its purpose.  Making Decisions  Decisions are used to figure out how to handle the client request. The decision keys  end  with  a  question  mark   ?   and  their  handler  must  evaluate  to  a Boolean value.  A decision function can return a Boolean value indicating the result of the decision,  or  it  can  return  a  map  or  a  vector.  In  the  case  where  a  map  is returned,  the  decision  is  assumed  to  have  been  evaluated  to true,  and  the contents of the map are merged with the response map. If a vector is returned, it must contain a Boolean indicating the outcome, followed by a map to be merged with the response.  When any decision has a negative outcome, its corresponding HTTP code is returned to the client. For example, if we wanted to mark as unavailable the route  we  defined  earlier,  we  could  add  a  decision  key  called service-available? and associate it with a false value.  liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource home  :service-available? false :handle-ok loading-page :etag "fixed-etag" :available-media-types ["text html"]   If  we  reload  the  page,  we’ll  see  the  503  response  type  associated  with  the “Service not available” response.  Alternatively,  we  could  restrict  access  to  the  resource  by  using  the method- allowed? decision key along with a decision function.  liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource home :method-allowed?  fn [context]   = :get  get-in context [:request :request-method]     :handle-ok loading-page  report erratum     discuss   Defining Resources   417  :etag "fixed-etag" :available-media-types ["text html"]   Since checking the request method is a common operation, Liberator provides a  key  called :allowed-methods.  This  key  should  point  to  a  vector  of  keywords representing the HTTP methods.  We can also combine multiple decision functions in the same resource:  liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource home  :allowed-methods [:get] :handle-ok loading-page :etag "fixed-etag" :available-media-types ["text html"]   liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource home  :service-available? true :method-allowed?  request-method-in :get  :handle-method-not-allowed  fn [context]  :handle-ok loading-page :etag "fixed-etag" :available-media-types ["text html"]   Creating Handlers   str  get-in context [:request :request-method]  " is not allowed"    A handler function should return a standard Ring response. Handler keys start  with  the handle-  prefix.  We  saw  a  handler  function  when  we  used  the handle-ok key to return the response in our resource. There are other handlers, such as handle-method-not-allowed and handle-not-found. The full list of handlers can be found on the official documentation page.4 These  handlers  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the  decisions  to  return  a specific response for a particular decision outcome.  For example, if we want to return a specific response when the service is not available, we do the following:  liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource home  :service-available? false :handle-service-not-available "service is currently unavailable..."  4.  http:  clojure-liberator.github.io liberator doc handlers.html  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 5. Writing RESTful Web Services with Liberator   418   str  get-in context [:request :request-method]  " is not allowed"    :method-allowed?  request-method-in :get  :handle-method-not-allowed  fn [context]  :handle-ok loading-page :etag "fixed-etag" :available-media-types ["text html"]   Our resource now has custom handlers for each decision outcome.  Taking Actions  An action represents an update of the current state by the client, such as a PUT, POST, or DELETE request. The action keys end with an exclamation point  !  to  indicate  that  they’re  mutating  the  application’s  internal  state.  Once  an action occurs, we can return the result to the client using the handle-created handler.  Writing Declarations  Declarations  are  used  to  indicate  the  resource’s  capabilities.  For  example, our resource uses the available-media-types declaration to specify that it returns a response of type text html. Another declaration we saw is etag, which allows the client to cache the resource.  Putting It All Together  Let’s look at an example of a service that has a couple of resources that allow the client to read and write some data. The application will display a list of to-do items and allow the user to add additional items to the list.  The client will be implemented in ClojureScript and use Ajax to communicate with the service. The client code will consist of a few functions to retrieve, render, and save to-do items. Let’s look at each of these in turn.  The first function renders the items in our list.  liberator-service src cljs liberator_service core.cljs  defn item-list [items]   when  not-empty items   [:ul  for [item items]  ^{:key item} [:li item] ]    Next we add a function called get-items to grab the items from the server as a string  and  a  function  called parse-items  to  parse  it  into  a  list.  The parse-items  report erratum     discuss   function expects to receive data as a newline-separated string, generating a vector from nonempty items.  Putting It All Together   419  liberator-service src cljs liberator_service core.cljs  defn parse-items [items]   ->> items  clojure.string split-lines  remove empty?  vec     defn get-items []   GET " items"  {:error-handler  session put! :error  :response %   :handler  session put! :items  parse-items %  }    Note the function is calling session update-in! to store the result. This function is  provided  by  the  reagent-utils  library.  The  session  namespace  contains  a Reagent atom and provides several utility functions for managing its state.  The session provides a way to represent the global state for the application, such as the user information. It should not be used for any component-spe- cific data, however. Since our application is extremely simple, it’s a convenient way to track the to-do items.  If we receive an error, the :error-handler is invoked and populates the :error key in the session.  We also need to add a function for adding new items to the list. Let’s call this function add-item!; its code looks as follows:  liberator-service src cljs liberator_service core.cljs  defn add-item! [item]   session remove! :error   POST " items"  {:headers {"x-csrf-token"   .-value  .getElementById js document "__anti-forgery-token"  }  :format :raw :params {:item  str @item } :error-handler  session put! :error  :response %   :handler  do   println "updating"   session update-in! [:items] conj @item   reset! item nil  }    This function looks for the anti-forgery token on the page and sets it as the header,  as  we’ve  done  before.  It  also  sets  the  :format  key  to  the  :raw  value, indicating that we do not wish to do any processing on the data we send and receive. The success handler updates the session to conj the value to the list  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 5. Writing RESTful Web Services with Liberator   420  and resets the item atom to nil. Errors are handled the same way as for the previous component.  In order to use the add-item! function, we have to create a UI component; let’s call it item-input-component and put the following code in it:  liberator-service src cljs liberator_service core.cljs  defn item-input-component []   let [item  atom nil ]   fn [] [:div [:input {:type :text :value @item :on-change  reset! item  -> % .-target .-value   :placeholder "To-Do item"}]  [:button {:on-click  add-item! item } "Add To-Do"]]     The component creates a local state to hold the value of the item as it is being typed  in  by  the  user  and  then  calls  the add-item!  function  to  send  it  to  the server.  Finally, we create the error-component that displays itself whenever the :error key is present in the session.  liberator-service src cljs liberator_service core.cljs  defn error-component []   when-let [error  session get :error ]  [:p error]    Let’s update the home-page component to display the components that we just created.  liberator-service src cljs liberator_service core.cljs  defn home-page []  [:div [:h2 "To-Do Items"] [error-component] [item-list  session get :items ] [item-input-component]]   liberator-service src cljs liberator_service core.cljs  defn init! []   clerk initialize!   accountant configure-navigation! {:nav-handler  Now let’s update the init! function to fetch the initial list of to-do items from the server when the page loads.  report erratum     discuss   Putting It All Together   421   fn [path]   let [match  reitit match-by-path router path   current-page  :name  :data match   route-params  :path-params match ]   reagent after-render clerk after-render!   session put! :route {:current-page  page-for current-page   :route-params route-params}    clerk navigate-page! path      :path-exists?  fn [path]   boolean  reitit match-by-path router path   }    accountant dispatch-current!   mount-root    Now we’ll create corresponding resources to handle each of the operations. Let’s start by adding a reference to clojure.java.io in order to read and write the to-do file and to ring.util.anti-forgery for handling CSRF.   ns liberator-service.routes.home   :require ...

This is necessary to ensure that a fresh anti-forgery value is generated for each session. We also have to update the home resource accordingly.  liberator-service src clj liberator_service handler.clj  def mount-target  [:divapp [:h2 "Welcome to liberator-service"] [:p "please wait while Figwheel is waking up ..."] [:p " Check the js console for hints if nothing exciting happens.

Note that when we’re working with mutable resources such as files we do not wish to place them in the resources folder. Once the application is packaged as a JAR, then the resources become read-only. Therefore, we need to reference these from an external location.  liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource items  :allowed-methods [:get] :handle-ok  fn [_]  io file "items"   :available-media-types ["text plain"]   In the resource, we use the :allowed-methods key to restrict it to only serve GET requests. We use the available-media-types declaration to specify that the response is of type text plain. The resource then reads the items file from disk and returns its contents to the client.  Next, we’ll update the resource to support POST requests that will allow adding an item contained in params to the list of items on disk.  liberator-snippets home.clj  defresource items  :allowed-methods [:get :post] :handle-ok  fn [_]  io file "items"   :available-media-types ["text plain"] :post!  fn [context]   let [item  -> context :request :params :item ]   spit  io file "items"   str item "\n"  :append true     :handle-created  io file "items"    The updated resource will check that the method is either GET or POST and use the post! action to update the existing list of items. We then use the handle-cre- ated handler to return ok upon success.  report erratum     discuss   You’ll notice that nothing is preventing us from adding a blank item. Let’s add a check in our service to validate the request to add a new item:  Putting It All Together   423  liberator-service src clj liberator_service handler.clj  defresource items  :allowed-methods [:get :post] :handle-ok  fn [_]  io file "items"   :available-media-types ["text plain"] :post!  fn [context]   let [item  -> context :request :params :item ]   spit  io file "items"   str item "\n"  :append true     :handle-created "ok" :malformed?  fn [context]  :handle-malformed "item value cannot be empty!"    -> context :request :params :item empty?    Now if the value of the item parameter is empty, we’ll be routed to handle-malformed to inform the client that the item name cannot be empty. Next time we try to add an empty user, we’ll see a 400 error in the browser:  POST http:  localhost:3000 add-user 400  Bad Request   If you click the Add To-Do button without filling in the item field, you’ll see the following error:  As you can see, Liberator ensures separation of concerns by design. With the Liberator model, you will have small, self-contained functions, each of which handles a specific task.  report erratum     discuss   APPENDIX 6  Leiningen Templates  Once we create a particular type of application, such as our guestbook app, we may want to write other applications that use the same structure. It would be nice to be able to create a skeleton app template that could be used for this task. This is precisely what we can do with Leiningen templates.  Throughout  this  book  we’ve  been  primarily  using  the  Luminus  template  for starting  new  projects.1  Here  we’ll  cover  how  a  template  works  and  how  to make templates of our own.  What’s in a Template  A  Leiningen  template  is  a  collection  of  assets  that  are  used  to  generate  a particular  project.  The  templates  use  the  Stencil  library  to  inject  dynamic content, such as the name of the project, into the asset files when they’re rendered.2  We’ll take a look at a template project called compojure-template to see how it works.3  Since templates are Leiningen projects, they each contain a project.clj file.  compojure-template project.clj  defproject compojure lein-template "0.4.7"  :description "Compojure project template for Leiningen" :url "https:  github.com weavejester compojure-template" :eval-in-leiningen true :license {:name "Eclipse Public License"  :url "http:  www.eclipse.org legal epl-v10.html"}   1. 2. 3.  https:  github.com luminus-framework luminus-template https:  github.com davidsantiago stencil https:  github.com weavejester compojure-template  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 6. Leiningen Templates   426  It looks like a regular project file, except for the eval-in-leiningen key that prevents Leiningen from launching a separate process for the given project during the build time.  The template itself is found at src leiningen new compojure.clj, and it looks like this:  compojure-template src leiningen new compojure.clj  ns leiningen.new.compojure   :require [leiningen.core.main :as main]  [leiningen.new.templates :refer [renderer year project-name  ->files sanitize-ns name-to-path multi-segment]]     def render  renderer "compojure"    defn compojure  data  "Create a new Compojure project" [name]  let [main-ns  sanitize-ns name  name  project-name name  main-ns  name-to-path main-ns   year }]  {:raw-name :name :namespace :dirs :year   ->files data   render "gitignore" ]  [".gitignore" ["project.clj"  render "project.clj" data ] ["README.md" ["src {{dirs}} handler.clj" ["test {{dirs}} handler_test.clj"  render "handler_test.clj" data ] "resources public"      render "handler.clj" data ]   render "README.md" data ]  The compojure function is where all the fun happens, and it’s what gets called when we run lein new compojure myapp to create an application using this template. The function declares a map called data with some useful variables, such as the sanitized project name, that is used to render the assets.  The leiningen.new.templates render function is used to generate the resulting files at the specified path. Each resource is represented by a vector where the first element is the name of the file to be generated and the second is a call to the render function with the name of the template file. The {{dirs}} tag is replaced by the value of the :dirs key from the data map. We find the template files at the resources leiningen new compojure path. These files don’t need to have the same folder structure as the resulting project. As you can see in the preceding code, we specify the target path explicitly when we render each asset.  report erratum     discuss   What’s in a Template   427  The template files use tags that match the keys in the data map, such as the {{namespace}} anchor, whenever dynamic content needs to be injected. This anchor is replaced with the value specified at that key when the resource is generated. Let’s look at the handler.clj template file as an example:  compojure-template resources leiningen new compojure handler.clj  ns {{namespace}}.handler   :require [compojure.core :refer :all] [compojure.route :as route] [ring.middleware.defaults :refer [wrap-defaults site-defaults]]     defroutes app-routes   GET " " [] "Hello World"   route not-found "Not Found"     def app   wrap-defaults app-routes site-defaults    Note that since Stencil uses {{ and }} delimiters, it can end up interpreting the contents of the template as tags. To avoid this, it’s possible to temporarily change the delimiters as follows:  {{= =}}  let [{{:keys [foo bar]} :baz} m]   println foo bar       Now that we’ve seen what a Leiningen template looks like, let’s create a fresh template project by running the following command:  lein new template my-template  The  resulting  project  contains  the  following  files.  Note  that  the  package structure matches the name of the template that we supplied.  ____.gitignore ____.hgignore ____CHANGELOG.md ____LICENSE ____project.clj ____README.md ____resources  ____leiningen    ____src  ____new  ____leiningen  ____new  ____my_template  ____foo.clj  ____my_template.clj  report erratum     discuss   Appendix 6. Leiningen Templates   428  Once we’ve created our template, we can install it locally by running lein install. Then we can start using it instead of having to write the boilerplate for this kind of project. If we wish to make our template available to others, we can publish it to Clojars by running lein deploy clojars.4  4.  https:  clojars.org   report erratum     discuss   Thank you!
