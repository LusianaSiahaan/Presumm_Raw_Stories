Starting by showing how to set up a development environment for OpenCms  work, this book moves you through various tasks of increasing complexity. Some  of the common tasks covered are building OpenCms, XML asset type development,  templating, module development, user and role setup, and search integration. In  addition to these common tasks some more advanced topics are covered such as  self-registering users, RSS support, developing custom widgets, and extending the  administrative interface. All the topics include examples and are presented while  building a sample blog site.   This book is a clear, practical tutorial to OpenCms development. It will take you  through the development of an example site, illustrating the key concepts of  OpenCms development with examples at every stage.  What This Book Covers Chapter 1 starts out by describing a sample site that will be created to demonstrate  OpenCms development concepts. It also provides a description of the developer  skills required for OpenCms development, followed by a basic overview  of OpenCms architecture. We also provide a basic description of OpenCms  configuration files and their file locations. Chapter 2 sets the stage for coding by providing details on how to set up various  OpenCms development environments. The chapter includes a step-by-step  procedure for using Eclipse to check out and build OpenCms from the CVS  repository. The chapter describes how to build OpenCms using Ant and also how to  debug OpenCms itself.   Preface  Chapter 3 begins with an explanation of OpenCms modules, including a guide for  creating a new module. The module is used to define a new content type, which is  another concept covered in the chapter. Included in the content type discussion is a  complete, step-by-step guide for designing and creating a new content type used to  contain blog entries. All aspects of content type schema files are covered, including  schema design, widget usage, field selectors, field validations, nested definitions, and  registration. At the end of the chapter, the content type may be used to create new  blog entries. Chapter 4 continues developing the sample site by covering JSP template coding.  A set of templates is created to display the blog content, including a complete run  through of how they are put together. The example illustrates the use of custom  template coding beyond the standard OpenCms tag library by sub-classing Java  template classes. Included in the chapter is an overview of the resource and template  loading mechanism. Also relating to templates is a description of using expressions  and JSTL within template code. Lastly in the chapter is a guide to using WebDAV for  template editing in Eclipse.  Chapter 5 covers the usage of Lucene within OpenCms, beginning with an overview  of basic Lucene concepts. This is followed by an in-depth guide to creating a search  index in OpenCms. The guide provides an example of building a new search index  for the blog site example and describes a developer tool, which may be used to  perform test queries against the index. The chapter includes a walkthrough of  implementing a search form in OpenCms for simple cases and for more   advanced situations. Chapter 6 continues the build out of the sample site by adding support for users  and commenting. It starts with an explanation of OpenCms security, including a  discussion on Roles, Groups, Users, and Organizational Units. It then proceeds with  the set up of the group and role structure for the sample, and shows how they are  used within the code.  Chapter 7 shows how easy it is to support user customizations of site pages. It then  show an example of this by adding RSS feed support to the sample site, allowing  users to specify a custom feed. Included in the chapter is a discussion of integrating  third-party libraries into OpenCms. Chapter 8 describes the custom widget interface, and then shows how to design and  create a widget. The widget provides a pluggable data interface that is used to obtain  a list of selection values for a select list. The chapter then illustrates how to read XML  content fields by creating a list source that gets its values from any content field.  Finally, the chapter shows how to localize message strings and how to register and  use the custom widget.  [ 2 ]   Preface  Chapter 9 shows how RSS feeds can be generated from OpenCms content. It also  shows how wrapper classes can be used around structured content items to make  them easier to work with, and then walks through creation of an RSS feed generation  module using these concepts. Chapter 10 discusses how administration points are created in OpenCms, and also  how to use OpenCms dialog classes. The chapter also discusses how widgets can   be used programmatically. An example administration point is created that ties  together topics from previous chapters, showing how to use widgets, dialogs, and  multiple screens.

[ 5 ]    Overview  This book is a guide for developers interested in building websites using the  OpenCms content management system. The book is intended for developers   who are familiar with Java, JSP, and building web applications based on the   Java J2EE framework.  In this book, we will develop a website designed for a blog writer. In the course of  building our site, we will go over these topics:                   The site design Overview of OpenCms Setting up an OpenCms development environment Creating structured content types Creating templates Utilizing search Extending OpenCms Allowing online users to contribute site content  We will go over all the steps involved in building a blog website using OpenCms.  We will start by describing the features and requirements of our website and will  then provide an overview of OpenCms. Next, we will discuss how to create a  development environment. We then will go over the steps involved in creating  structured content types, to hold our site content. After that, we will cover creation  of templates and Java code, to display the content. The site also supports search and  user comments;, so we will cover the Lucene search engine as well to show how to  provide login support. As the site additionally supports RSS clients and feeds, we  will discuss how to add new features to OpenCms.  Before we get into the development details, we will first discuss some of the skills  required to develop sites with OpenCms. This will provide us with a basis   for understanding the environment and tools, which we will need to do our  development work.   Overview  The Site Design Before the development of any site can begin, there should be an understanding of  the site's feature requirements. The feature requirements will often be driven by the  actual layout and design of the site. We will design and build a blog website named  'Deep Thoughts'. The design of the site homepage layout looks like this:  [ 8 ]   The blog site is designed to support the following features:  Chapter 1  Blogs are listed in descending order of date, with the most recent blog  appearing at the top. Each blog entry is listed in teaser style, with a link to the full blog appearing  at the end. Blog entries support a list of topics attached to them. Archives of previous blogs appear on the righthand side, in   descending order. Past blog archives can be browsed. The site supports contents search with paginated results. Ads may be placed on the righthand side. Users may self register for the site. Registered users may add comments and create a customized RSS feed on  their homepage. Blogs may be viewed in various RSS formats.  In addition to the features seen in the mockup, we will also support:  Direct editing of content in preview mode. User submitted comments.                                [ 9 ]   Overview  There are two additional mockups for the site. The first one shows a detailed view of  a blog. This view is shown when a user clicks on a blog from the homepage:  [ 10 ]   The last mockup shows what the search result screen looks like. Search results are  shown in decreasing order of relevance to the search term. The pagination controls at  the bottom of the page allow for the results to be scrolled, if necessary:  Chapter 1  [ 11 ]   Overview  Required Developer Skills  The level of technology and coding skills required to do site development will  vary depending upon the requirements and features of the site. Designing and  architecting a site that properly utilizes and leverages OpenCms is an exercise  in itself, which we will not discuss in this book. However, we will discuss the  development tasks that are involved, once the architecture has been designed. In  general, we can think of four different developer levels and skills.  Basic Site Development OpenCms may be used to manage content right after installation. One way of using  it is to import static files into the Virtual File System  VFS  and utilize the publishing  and version control features to manage them. In this scenario, files from an existing  non-content managed website may easily be content managed. Files in the VFS  may be created, edited, and previewed in the offline staging area, before they are  published to the online file system. When published, versions can be taken to allow  for roll back, if necessary. Files in the VFS may also be exported to the Real File System  RFS  and served  statically or by a web server. In this way, the website can operate in exactly the same  way it did, prior to being placed into OpenCms, except for the fact that it is now  version controlled. The following illustration shows how OpenCms can be used in  this fashion:  Utilizing OpenCms this way is straightforward, needs little, if any development  effort, and probably doesn't require use of this book! However, it is worth  mentioning here that there are a number of sites that can take advantage of this.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  For this developer audience, the skill levels will include the following:         Operational understanding of the use of OpenCms Operational knowledge of Application, Web, and Database servers HTML coding capabilities  OpenCms also provides a sample site called TemplateOne, packaged as a module.  This module contains structured content types and templates. Although somewhat  complex and confusing, content types and templates provided with TemplateOne  may be used to construct sites without requiring development work. The  documentation for these templates may be downloaded from the OpenCms website  and installed into OpenCms.  Sites Requiring Custom Content Types After looking at the TemplateOne samples, we may soon realize that it does not quite  address our site requirements. Perhaps, the template layouts are not what we desire  or the structured content types do not contain the fields necessary to hold our data.  In this case, we will want to develop our own JSP code and extend or create our own  custom content types. This level of development will require some understanding of  Java, JSPs and XML.  This type of development involves working within the framework provided by  OpenCms, to define the templates, content types, and JSPs, and also perhaps java  classes that we need. Developing, at this level, does not require us to utilize a  development environment such as Eclipse or Netbeans. But we will probably want to  use a nice editor for our JSP and XML code.  Before undertaking this task, we will want to understand the feature and content  requirements of our site in detail. This will allow us to properly design the templates  and custom content types, which our site will need. This is a design exercise which  will not be touched upon in this book. However, we will discuss the specific tasks  required in implementing templates and the custom content types once they have  been designed.  For this type of development, the developer requires first level skills plus:           Understanding of OpenCms modules Basic Java and JSP coding skills Understanding of OpenCms configuration Understanding of OpenCms content types  [ 13 ]   Overview Sites Requiring Custom Features There are different types of projects that require integration of features which are not  provided with OpenCms. For example, we may need a feature that automatically  imports data from a back office application into a structured content type. Or  perhaps we need to create a content type that we can easily use to define RSS feeds  from articles in our site. For these types of projects, we will want to code in Java,  using a development environment. We will also probably want to build OpenCms  for ourselves, so that we can step through the source and gain a better understanding  of how our own code will need to work. We will discuss how to do these, in the later  chapters of this book.  Developing custom features in OpenCms will require the second level skills, plus:       Advanced Java coding skills Understanding of OpenCms Java interfaces  Bespoke Site Development The last type of development level is custom development, where OpenCms is used  as a base framework or platform, and a custom site interface is built on top of it. This  type of development might be suitable where the Workplace Explorer is too general,  and a more task‑specific user interface is required.  Developing, at this level, requires the third level skills, plus:       Knowledge of OpenCms architecture and Familiarity with OpenCms code  This type of development is not covered in this book.  OpenCms Application Overview Before undertaking development, it will be helpful to understand the basic design of  OpenCms. OpenCms is structured as a typical J2EE web application conforming to a  3-tier web application architecture:  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  A web server on the front-end tier services incoming requests. The requests are  passed through to an application server in the middle tier, where the OpenCms  application runs. The OpenCms application utilizes the database on the third tier to  read and store its content.  For production, using an array of web servers will typically distribute load to the  application server tier. A common choice is to use the Apache web server, utilizing  the mod_jk plug-in to distribute load. For development purposes, using a web server  is optional, and instead the application server container may be accessed directly.  OpenCms supports a wide variety of application servers, including commercial  servers such as IBM Websphere and BEA WebLogic. It also supports open source  servers such as Tomcat and JBoss. A popular choice among developers is the Apache  Tomcat server. We will be using the Apache server for our development environment.  On the back end, OpenCms supports a variety of databases, including Oracle,  Postgreas, and the popular open source database, MySQL. The OpenCms installation  setup procedure provides a wizard interface guiding the user through the creation  of the database schema. Optionally, it allows for manual creation of the database  schema through provided scripts.   This wide variety of choices makes it easy to install and run OpenCms in many  mixed environments. It also allows for easy integration with other technologies, such  as portals, CRM systems, and document management systems. Next, let's take a look  at the file structure of an installed environment.  The OpenCms Directory Structure OpenCms must be installed into the application server as an exploded Web  Application Resource  WAR  file, due to the way OpenCms JSP files are handled.   We will discuss more of this, in the later chapters. After extracting the WAR file and  completing the setup process, the file directory structure should look something   like this:  The Real File System Layout The web application directory structure should be familiar to anyone who has looked  at or developed a web application.  OPENCMS_WEBAPP_NAME              WEB-INF META-INF export setup resources  [ 15 ]   Overview  These directories are explained in detail here:     WEB-INF: This path contains the web.xml deployment descriptor, and   other files used by the application. There are a number of sub‑directories  located here:         classes: This should also be a familiar directory. It contains  all class files and property files used by the application that  are not packaged into JAR files. config: This directory contains configuration files. Some  settings in these files are exposed through the Workplace  Administrator and may be changed there. There are many  other settings which must be managed manually. However, we  will cover some of the settings in the later chapters but many of  them are for advanced customizations and are not covered in  this book. Here is a summary of the configuration files:   opencms.xml  opencms-system.xml  opencms.properties  This file contains the configuration information for  connecting to the database. The setup program will  automatically populate this file, based on the input  selections. This is a master configuration file containing the names  of classes used to configure a system area. Each class  implements the I_CmsXmlConfiguration interface  and is called upon, at startup, to parse its configuration  and initialize its area. This file will rarely need alterations. This file contains core system settings such as locales,  cache and site definitions. Most of the settings must be  changed manually. This file contains settings related to the virtual file  system. This file needs to be edited when adding a new  resource type, and this is covered in a later chapter. This file contains settings related to the Workplace  Explorer interface. This file also needs to be edited when  adding a new resource type. This file contains settings related to searching and  search indexes. Most of the settings in this file can be  managed though the Workplace Administrator. opencms-importexport.xml This file controls the behavior of importing and   opencms-workplace.xml  opencms-search.xml  opencms-vfs.xml  opencms-modules.xml  exporting files from the VFS. This file contains a registry of modules and is managed  by the Module Manager within the Workplace  Administrator. Settings in this file should not be  modified manually.  [ 16 ]   Chapter 1                 imageCache: This directory contains a cache of images that  have been served from the VFS. All content including images  is saved in the database. As images may take a long time to  read and retrieve, they are cached here upon first retrieval.  index: This directory is where search indexes are built   and maintained. jsp: This directory contains JSP files that originate in the  VFS. In order to run a JSP file from the VFS, it must first  be exported to the disk and made accessible to the web  application. This is the default location for these files. As JSPs  must be written to the file system, the application must be  deployed as an exploded WAR file. packages: This directory contains files that have been  exported by OpenCms with the intention of importing to  another system. Exported files may include VFS database  extraction files as well as exported modules. setupdata: This directory contains a script file used by the  installer. It may be deleted after the setup process is complete.  Note also that this script may be altered, before a setup is run  to customize an installation.              META-INF: This is a standard web application directory. export: This directory contains files and resources that have been exported  from the VFS to the real file system. If a file in the VFS has been marked  for export, then it will be exported to this location. The actual time it gets  exported is dependent upon the export configuration. URLs within the VFS  that reference this file will be updated accordingly. setup: This directory contains the setup application. After OpenCms has  been successfully installed, this directory may be removed. resources: This directory contains resources, such as images, that are used  frequently by the application. OpenCms will export frequently accessed  items from the VFS into this directory. Items should not be placed here  manually, but should rather be managed within a module. This is covered in  more detail, in later chapters.   [ 17 ]   Overview The Virtual File System Layout Now let's look at the layout of the files in the virtual file system, where the bulk of  the application structure exists. To view the entire virtual file system, we must be  logged in as Admin and have the root site     selected. Underneath the root, there are  two main branches:        sites: Each directory located underneath this branch represents a site in  OpenCms, and is the mechanism used to segregate site content. The title  property of each folder appears in the 'Site' pull-down of the Workplace  Explorer. Adding a site entry is a two-part manual process. First a new folder  must be created in the VFS. Then a site entry must be added to the opencms- system.xml configuration file. Each added site entry must have a unique  domain name or IP address. When a request is made originating from the  assigned domain or IP address, OpenCms will set the site context so that a  request for a file appears to be relative to the site root. For example, if the site  http:  www.mysite.com is mapped to  sites mysite  then a request for  index.html coming from that domain will appear to be located at  . system: This directory contains files that comprise the bulk of the OpenCms  Workplace Explorer application. There are a number of sub-folders under  this directory, which are used by the application. Here is a summary of   the folders:                       categories: This folder is used to define categories that may  be applied to a resource. The hierarchy of folder items in  this location determines the available categories that may be  applied. New categories may be added by creating folders in  this location. galleries: This folder is used as a shared repository for  content galleries. Galleries created here can be made available  to all sites. handler: This folder contains templates used as the handlers  for 404 and 500 site error messages. login: This contains the default OpenCms login   page template. lost-found: This folder is used to place resources that have  conflicts during import or export operations. modules: This folder contains sub-folders with modules and  corresponding module resources. orgunits: This folder contains folders used to maintain  Organizational Unit structures.  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1        shared: This folder contains resources that may be shared. workplace: This folder contains resources that are used by the  Workplace Explorer interface.   The level of development required will determine if any resources within these  locations need modifications.  OpenCms Architecture OpenCms has a modular architecture centered on a VFS. The file system is  considered virtual as it resides inside a database and not on a hard disk. The VFS is  similar to a real file system that supports folders, file types, and permissions. Access  permission masks on the files and folders, and controls access that users and groups  have to the files. The OpenCms VFS also provides a feature very similar to symbolic  links in a Unix file system. A link is a directory entry that contains meta‑information  which is kept separate from the file contents.   The core also provides support for basic features such as publishing, access  control, and revisions. Layered above this are application level features such as  configuration, the user interface, and module support. Module support is a key  feature of OpenCms, providing the ability to extend and modify it. Module support  is layered on top of OpenCms. A logical view looks like this:   It is interesting to note that although OpenCms is a web application, it comes with  a shell application that provides an interpretive interface to the API from a Java  command line interface! Furthermore, it is possible to script this interface to install  content into the VFS.   [ 19 ]   Overview  Most of our development will center around using, or extending these core features.  While working on our project, we will strive to work within the framework that  OpenCms provides, rather than modify any OpenCms source code.  Extensibility through Modules Modules are a key aspect of the OpenCms design. They provide a way to package  together necessary components that may be easily plugged into OpenCms. Modules  are the way that new content types, templates, or web capabilities are added to  OpenCms. Later in this book, we will go into the details of creating an administration  module for OpenCms.  The OpenCms Web Request Process It would be useful to understand how a request made to OpenCms results in the  display of content. The structure of a typical OpenCms URL looks like:  http:  [server]:[port] [context] [servlet] [parameters]  For example:  http:  mydevserver:8080 opencms opencms system logon index.html  Server: mydevserver Port: 8080 Context: opencms Servlet: opencms Parameters:  system logon index.html The request will invoke the opencms servlet with the parameter  system logon  index.html. When the servlet runs, it goes through the following sequence:  1.  Uses the passed in parameter to locate the item in the virtual file system 2.  Determines its access permissions, and see if it can be accessed by the   requestor  3.  Determines its file type 4.  Based on its file type, locates a resource loader for that type 5.   Invokes the resource loader to load the file  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1  There is a bit more going on; but for our discussion we will consider only the  previous steps. It can be seen that after permission has been established, a resource  loader is utilized to load the file. Resource loaders are responsible for encapsulating  the knowledge required to load and execute items requested from the VFS. There are  several types of resource loaders provided by OpenCms, and there is a one-to-one  mapping between an OpenCms file type and a resource loader.   Most site content is structured XML, and the assigned loader for this type is the  CmsXmlContentLoader. When this resource loader is invoked, it examines the  properties assigned to the resource, specifically looking for the template-elements  property. This property must contain the full path to a template used to render   the XML content. The resource loader passes control to the template. When the  template runs, it takes the responsibility of parsing the original XML resource, and  displaying it. Most templates will be JSP files, but they are not restricted to this   type. In fact, when a template is invoked, it follows the same loading process,  resulting in its corresponding resource loader being invoked. This allows for new  template languages to be plugged into OpenCms, by writing and adding new  resource loaders.  As resource loaders act on file types, the extension of a file in the VFS is not  significant. This means that a file with an HTML extension in the VFS may, in fact, be  run as a JSP file, or vice versa. A useful way to leverage this, is to create a file with a  .CSS extension that is in fact a JSP file. The JSP could then dynamically generate the  CSS based on browser type. We will discuss resource loaders in more detail in a   later chapter.  OpenCms Web Application Packaging Although OpenCms is distributed in a standard WAR file it must be exploded when  it is deployed into the application server. This is because, in order to execute a JSP  stored in the OpenCms virtual file system, the JSP must be written to the real file  system first. As the web application writes to the file system, it cannot be run as   a WAR file.  Building a Complete Site with OpenCms In this book, we will build a sample blog site using OpenCms. The site will have the  following features:         We will be able to create blog entries easily. The site will have search capabilities. The site will provide an archive view of our blogs.  [ 21 ]   Overview       The site will provide the ability to import RSS feeds from another news site. The site will be able to serve our blog entries as an RSS feed.  Summary We now have a basic understanding of the architecture of OpenCms and how the  various pieces fit together. The following chapters will delve into the details of  developing with OpenCms.   [ 22 ]   Developing in OpenCms  In this chapter, we will discuss how to set up different types of environments for  OpenCms development. The topics we cover will be useful, as we progress later  through the development of the Deep Thoughts site. We also will go over the various  techniques we can use to be more productive in these environments. We'll start with  a very basic approach to editing the JSP files. We will then go over the techniques to  use more advanced editing tools in OpenCms. We will cover how to check out and  build OpenCms from the source repository. Finally, we will discuss how to debug  OpenCms application code and JSP code.  Developing Basic Site Content As described in the first chapter, it is not necessary to create a development  environment for basic OpenCms sites that consist of static HTML pages. For a site  such as this one, we can use the Extended HTML Import feature to import our site  into the OpenCms VFS. After we have imported our site, we will be able to edit it  in the VFS, and then publish it. OpenCms will manage the different versions of our  content, as we publish it. An additional advantage of using the Extended HTML  Import utility for static content is that it separates our content neatly into Image,  Link, and Document galleries. The Import utility creates references, automatically,  inside the imported HTML, to these content items.  Once imported, we can edit our site pages with an in-site editing feature. The feature  is accessible by clicking on the icon in the upper right of a content-editable region  of the page we are previewing. Alternatively, we may navigate to the HTML page,  using the Workplace Explorer. Once we locate it, we can use the 'Edit page' action to  make our changes.    Developing in OpenCms  Setting Up an Environment for Creating  JSP Code Moving beyond this very basic type of editing, we will want to create an  environment for developing JSP code. Although we can always use the Workplace  Explorer to edit JSP files in the VFS, it is not well suited for development tasks. While  there are many excellent code editors available that are better suited, there is no way  to link any of these editors into the Workplace Explorer. Before we do this, lets create  a JSP file in the VFS, first. From the Workplace Explorer, select the Offline project  and ensure that the default site is selected. The default site appears in the Site pull- down menu as  sites default. Then use the New button to create the JSP file:  [ 24 ]   Name the file Hello.jsp and uncheck the Edit properties of the new file option:  Chapter 2  After clicking on Finish, the new file will exist in the VFS. To add code to the file  after it has been created, the Edit sourcecode command is used.   As mentioned already, the source editor is sufficient for quick and dirty changes.  But for full development, a more productive editor is preferred. There are three  approaches that we can take, to use an external editor.          Cut and paste from an external editor Editing via file synchronization Editing directly via WebDAV  The first approach is simple, and allows the use of any editor that we may be familiar  with. However, this approach can be cumbersome and difficult when making  changes to many files. While the second approach is a little better, it requires the  server machine to be locally accessible. The last approach is the most useful, as it  allows any editor and many files to be edited, and may also be accessed remotely.  Let's take a look at the last two approaches.  [ 25 ]   Developing in OpenCms Editing Files Using File Synchronization  The first approach is to utilize the OpenCms File Synchronization feature. This  feature allows a location on a disk to be chosen, where files in the VFS will  be mirrored to. Once the files have been mirrored, they can be edited directly  from within a developer IDE. Synchronizing the changes causes the VFS to be  updated with the disk file changes. To configure file synchronization, select the  Synchronization Settings icon from the within Administration view, located under  the Workplace Tools icon.  Enable this feature by selecting the Enabled checkbox. The Target Folder field  contains the folder location in the real file system, where the files from the VFS  should be mirrored to. The Resource option allows for multiple VFS source file  locations to be selected. Each Resource or path added will have a corresponding   sub-folder located underneath the Target folder path. Let's walk through an example:  For the target folder, first create a folder on the hard drive and then enter the path:  hard drive and then enter the path: hard drive and then enter the path:  C:\MySite. For the resource, click the plus icon and enter the path: Click OK to save the entries. to save the entries.. After selecting OK, use the Reload icon in the upper right of the Workplace  Explorer. This will refresh the Workplace Explorer and cause the 'Synchronize  folder' icon to appear in the toolbar area. Select the icon, and then press OK to begin  the synchronization process.  icon and enter the path::  sites default   [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  The synchronize action will always take the most recent file from each location and  update the other location with it. Any files recently updated on disk will get put into  the VFS, and any files updated more recently in the VFS will get updated on disk.  Any new files created on disk will get created in the VFS during the next synchronize  action. However, this will only work after an initial synchronization has been done.  While doing this, don't forget that OpenCms file extensions do not necessarily reflect  their OpenCms file types. When OpenCms writes a file from the VFS to disk, it  writes the file on the disk to match the extension it has in the VFS. However, when  going the other way round, OpenCms determines the VFS file type, based on the file  extension on the disk. This means that a new JSP file created on disk with an HTML  extension will get created in OpenCms with a type, 'plain'. plain'..  The Workplace Explorer may always be used to change the file type using the  'Change type' command. But it would be better to create the correct type, to begin  with.  This is possible by changing the file extension mappings. The mappings  of file extensions to OpenCms file types are controlled in the opencms-vfs.xml  configuration file. This file is located at:   \WEB-INF\config  To configure file mappings, locate the resource type to map a file extension to, and  then add mappings to that resource type. Keep in mind that there may be only one  file extension per resource type. For our example, if we wanted to ensure that files  with the .html extension get set to JSP in the OpenCms VFS, we would make the  following changes:  <type class="org.opencms.file.types.CmsResourceTypePlain"         name="plain" id="1">                                       remove this line                remove this line               <type class="org.opencms.file.types.CmsResourceTypeJsp" name="jsp"         id="4">                                       add this line                add this line             [ 27 ]   Developing in OpenCms  The .html and .htm mappings have been removed from the plain file type and  have been moved to the jsp file type. A restart of OpenCms is required for these  changes to take effect. The next time OpenCms imports a file from disk with a .html  or .htm extension, it will appear as a jsp file type in the VFS. While making this  type in the VFS. While making this  change, we should also keep in mind that if we want to import an actual HTML file,  we may have to revert our changes.  Using WebDAV for Editing The previous approach works, but involves two steps and requires local access to the  disk that the server is installed upon. Another approach to editing files is to access  them directly, using the newly provided WebDAV support in OpenCms 7. WebDAV  is an extension to the HTTP protocol that allows users to edit and manage files  remotely. OpenCms provides access to its VFS, using WebDAV, by pointing a web  browser at the URL:  http:  servername:8080 opencms webdav  The OpenCms login credentials may be used in the authentication dialog. The  browser may be used to navigate and view the files in the VFS. However, in order  to edit and create files, a WebDAV client is needed. Most current operating systems  provide a built-in WebDAV browser. Windows XP has one built into the Explorer,  which can be accessed through the browser. To access it from the browser, select  File->Open… and enter the previous URL. Ensure that the Open as web folder  option is checked. After supplying the login credentials, the Windows Explorer will  open up into the VFS:  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  Although Windows Explorer supports WebDAV, the file editor will also need to  support it, to be able to edit and write files. Let's open Windows Notepad and place  this code into it:          Hello World – My First JSP      <%           CmsJspActionElement jsp = new           CmsJspActionElement pageContext, request, response ;           String strRoot = jsp.getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .           getSiteRoot  ;           out.write “The site root is:" + strRoot ;     %>  This code should be saved into the Hello.jsp file that was just created. Unfortunately,  Windows Notepad does not support WebDAV and thus the file cannot be saved  directly to the VFS. To get around this save the file locally, open the WebDAV  location using Explorer, and then drag and drop the local file into it.  A workaround for editors that do not support WebDAV, is to use a free utility  created by Novell that allows mounting a WebDAV location as a local drive.  Information from Novell about this utility may be found here:  http:  www.novell.com coolsolutions qna 999.html  After installing NetDrive, any editor may be used to edit files directly in the VFS.  As soon as the file is saved from the editor, it can be clicked on in the Workplace  Explorer to view the changes.  We now have two methods to create and edit application code that resides in the  OpenCms VFS. Any JSPs that we create will have full access to the OpenCms Java  API. To fully leverage the features of OpenCms, templates can be created to control  the layout and functionality of the site. The template code is kept separate from the  site content, to allow non-technical personnel to update the site.  Creating a template in OpenCms is simply a matter of creating a JSP file in the right  location in the VFS. OpenCms requires that templates be placed into modules, and  that the JSP code be placed into the templates directory of a module. Later on in this  book, we will go into more details on templates.   [ 29 ]   Developing in OpenCms Debugging JSP Code in OpenCms Developer tools such as Eclipse and NetBeans have rich environments that provide  support for creating and debugging web application and JSP code. It is possible to  use these environments to debug JSP code. But this requires that the project be set  up in a specific way. We will show how this is done, using the Eclipse developer  environment. But before doing this, it is first helpful to understand how OpenCms  handles the execution of JSP files from the VFS.  The first time a JSP file in the OpenCms VFS is served, it is written to the real file  system, so that it can run as a normal JSP file would be run by the application server  container. The location of the JSP file is configurable, and by default will appear  underneath the WEB-INF directory of the OpenCms application, in a folder named  jsp. Once the JSP is on the real file system, the OpenCms servlet will dispatch to it  as a normal JSP file. If a breakpoint is set in the JSP file, the debugger must be able to  match up the source with the compiled java class. The debugger will be able to locate  the JSP source only if the project has been setup, with this in mind.  Now let's go through how to do this in Eclipse. We must first create the JSP within  the OpenCms VFS. The JSP may be created anywhere, but for this example, we will  use the Hello.jsp file we have just created. We first have to ensure that the JSP gets  written to disk, by clicking on it within the Workplace Explorer. Remember that  OpenCms will write the JSP to disk and then execute it, displaying its output in   the browser.  We now can set up the project in Eclipse. Using the New Project Wizard, expand the  Java node and select Tomcat Project:  [ 30 ]   Provide a name for the project and click Next. On the next screen, provide a  context name and web application root that matches the OpenCms web application  installation. The default is  opencms, as shown in the following screenshot:  Chapter 2  Click Finish to create the project. Once the project has been created, the JSP files may be added to it. We want to add  the JSP files that were written to disk by OpenCms. To do this, open the project,  navigate to the web application directory, and then select the WEB-INF folder.  [ 31 ]   Developing in OpenCms  The JSP files under this node may be added by right‑clicking on it and selecting New  > Folder. In the New Folder dialog box, open the Advanced option and check Link  to folder in the file system.  The Browse action can then be used to navigate to the existing folder. The folder to  add is the location where OpenCms has placed the JSP files. The default location is:   \WEB-INF\jsp  Navigate to this location, and click OK. On returning to the project, the jsp subfolder  can be expanded to locate the Hello.jsp file. The file can be found at:   \opencms\WEB-INF\jsp\sites\default\offline\Hello.jsp  After locating the JSP file, open it in Eclipse and double‑click on the left gutter to set  a breakpoint:  Now open your browser and run Hello.jsp by clicking on the Offline project from  the Workplace Explorer. Eclipse will switch to debug view and will stop at the   file source.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 2   cannot locate the source of the file, the Edit Source Lookup Path button   If Eclipse cannot locate the source of the file, the can be used to add the project path. In the Edit Source Lookup Path dialog box, click  the Add button and select File System Directory. Then browse to the location where  OpenCms is installed and click OK. For Tomcat, the default location is:   \webapps\opencms  After doing this, breakpoints can be set within the JSP code, and it may be   walked through!  It is important to remember that although this method allows JSP code to be  debugged, it is a one way trip, meaning that JSP files opened in Eclipse cannot be  edited. Recall how the JSPs get written from the VFS to the disk. To make changes to  the JSP file, one of the previously mentioned methods will need to be used.  It is also worth mentioning that best practices should be followed while writing  JSP code. Although it is possible to write application logic in JSP code, it is better to  encapsulate that code into Java beans or objects that the JSP uses. The majority of JSP  code that makes up the OpenCms user interface, is written in this fashion. Following  this convention will allow breakpoints to be set within Java classes, instead of  debugging JSP code. It also allows for changes to be made directly to the loaded   Java files.  Setting Up an Eclipse Environment to  Build OpenCms Moving ahead, JSP editing usually requires creating new Java classes that extend  OpenCms. Although it is not necessary to build OpenCms in order to develop new  code, it is often extremely useful to step through the OpenCms web application.  In this section, we will cover the steps necessary to build OpenCms using Eclipse.  Before starting, we will need to install some tools.   Tools Needed to Build OpenCms in Eclipse Sun Java JDK 1.5: The JDK is needed for us to build the OpenCms application.  Although the older 1.4 JDK is supported, the default version and the one we are  going to use, is the 1.5 JDK.  Download from: http:  java.sun.com Apache Ant 1.70: For building outside of an Eclipse environment, OpenCms  provides ant build.xml scripts. Ant build scripts allow us to automate the process of  building our Java projects. As Eclipse provides support for Ant build scripts, this tool  only needs to be installed, if builds are to be done outside of Eclipse.  [ 33 ]   Developing in OpenCms  Download from: http:  ant.apache.org  Eclipse WTP 1.5.4: We may want to download and install the Web Tools Platform   WTP  version of Eclipse as it provides support for J2EE based web applications.  After installing Eclipse, it should be configured to use the JDK that was installed.  Download from: http:  download.eclipse.org webtools downloads  Sysdeo Eclipse Tomcat Launcher plug-in: This is an Eclipse plug-in which provides  us the ability to start and stop our Tomcat application server.  Download from: http:  www.eclipsetotale.com tomcatPlugin.html Oracle JDBC Driver: The Oracle driver is optional, but is recommended. It may be  needed if you intend to build OpenCms for an Oracle distribution, or if you want to  eliminate all errors from your build. The ojdbc14.jar file needs to be downloaded  and placed into a directory.  Download from: http:  www.oracle.com technology software tech java  sqlj_jdbc index.html  Step 1: Checkout the Project Source from CVS We start by creating a new project in Eclipse using the New Project Wizard. In the  Wizard, locate the CVS option, select Projects from CVS and press the Next button.  [ 34 ]   In the Checkout from CVS dialog, provide the following information:  Chapter 2               Host: cvs.opencms.org Repository Path:  usr local cvs User: anon Password: anon Connection Type: pserver Save password: you may enable this, if desired  Pressing the Next button will bring us to the Select Module screen. Here, we have to  check the Use specified module name option, and provide the value opencms.  [ 35 ]   Developing in OpenCms  After pressing the next button, we are asked how we would like the project to be  checked out. We will take the default to use the New Project Wizard, and ensure that  the Checkout subfolders option is checked.  Pressing the Next button will allow us to specify which version we would like to  check out. At the Check Out As dialog box, we can use the Refresh Tags action to  retrieve the list of available versions, we may check out.  [ 36 ]   Expanding the Versions tree will reveal the list of available versions we may  check out. To find out which version label to use for a particular OpenCms release  is as easy as visiting the OpenCms website and looking at the associated release  information. The version label is specified in the release notes. At the time of   writing this book, the most recent release is OpenCms 7 RC2, with a version label  of build_7rc_2. Select the version you wish to check out and click Finish. This will  bring us to the New Project wizard, as we had previously specified.  Chapter 2  [ 37 ]   Developing in OpenCms  We now have to select Java Project and click Next. The New Java Project dialog box  will appear next.  [ 38 ]   The project name will contain the name of the Eclipse project that we will create. It  is good practice to use a project name that indicates the version of OpenCms, rather  than just the generic name of OpenCms. This will allow other versions of OpenCms  to be built, if necessary. For the Project Name, fill in: OpenCms_7RC2. For the JRE,  we should use the JDK that was installed previously. For our project, we can use  separate folders for our source and our output. To do this, select the Configure  default… option.  Chapter 2  Ensure that the Folders option is selected, accept the default values of src and bin,  and click OK. Clicking the Finish button will begin the process of checking out the  project from the OpenCms source code repository.   [ 39 ]   Developing in OpenCms Step 2: Setting the Classpath for Compilation The checkout operation may take a while to complete. But when it is finished,  Eclipse will attempt to compile the project immediately. OpenCms utilizes several  other open source class libraries, which we must specify on the build path, in order  to build successfully. We do this by right-clicking our newly checked out Eclipse  project and selecting Properties.  In the project properties dialog box, select Java Build Path on the left, and then the  Libraries tab. We then select the Add JARs… button and add all the jars in, from the  following locations:       OpenCms_7RC2 webapp WEB-INF lib OpenCms_7_RC2 modules org.opencms.frontend.templateone.form  resources system modules org.opencms.frontend.templateone.form lib   [ 40 ]   Chapter 2  After specifying these libraries, Eclipse will once again compile the project. All errors  will be removed except for the Oracle Database support. To remove these errors  from the project we use the Add External JARs… button to locate the ojdbc14.jar  file and add it to our project build path.   Step 3: Using Ant to Build a Distribution Package We have now successfully checked out and built OpenCms within the Eclipse  Development Environment. The project settings will compile the java files in the  project for us, and will allow us to debug the OpenCms web application. This will  be discussed in more detail, later on. However, if we want to build a distribution of  OpenCms we will need to create jar files, zip files, and documentation. OpenCms  provides an Ant build script to handle all this for us, and Eclipse provides support  for executing an Ant build file.  The OpenCms build file uses some custom Ant build tasks, which are defined in jar  files included in the source download. We must first configure the Ant environment  to pick these jar files up as well as other jar files needed by the build file. From  within Eclipse, select Windows > Preferences, expand the Ant option and select the  Runtime node.   [ 41 ]   Developing in OpenCms  In the Classpath tab, select the Global Entries item and click the Add JARs… button:  In the dialog box, expand the OpenCms_7RC2 webapp WEB-INF lib node and  select the following jar files.               ant-contrib-1.0b1.jar ant-opencms-1.1.jar commons-beanutils-1.7.0.jar commong-collections-3.2.jar commons-digester-1.8.jar commons-logging-1.1.jar  Click OK to add the jar files. The Ant build environment allows for property files to contain settings that are  specific to each build platform. OpenCms takes advantage of this, by referencing the  property values in its build script. We must set these property values within Eclipse  according to our particular environment.  [ 42 ]   Chapter 2  The Properties tab is where we will add these values. Select this tab and click the  Add Property… button. We will need to add the following properties:                    tomcat.home: This property value sets the location of our Tomcat  installation. The OpenCms build script also supports JBoss, in which case,  you must set the jboss.home value. jboss.home: The OpenCms build script also supports the JBoss application  server. If you are using JBoss, you may set this property value to the JBoss  installation location. app.name: This property value contains the context name of the web  application. The default value is 'opencms' but you may change this, if you  decide to use a different context name. opencms.output: This property value contains the location that the compiled  class and jar files will be placed into. opencms.input.externlibs: This property value contains the location of  any external libraries that may be required . It is used by the build file to  specify the location of the Oracle ojdbc14.jar file. modules.common.selection: When the build script creates a distribution,  it allows for control over which optional modules get included. How the  modules to be included get specified, is controlled by this property value.  The possible settings are::           interactive: If set to this value, then the build script will  present a dialog box, where the user may select the modules  to include in the build. This is the default setting. selection: If set to this value, then the modules to be  included are specified by another property value: modules. common.selection all: If set to this value, then the modules to be included are  specified by the all-modules.properties file. This file is  located in the 'modules' subdirectory of the project   source code..  We now can enable the Ant Window within Eclipse, by going to the menu and  selecting Window > Show View > Ant. When the Ant build window appears, select  the Add Buildfiles icon:  [ 43 ]   Developing in OpenCms  In the dialog box, expand the project OpenCms_7RC2 and select the build.xml file.  The Ant window will show the build file with the target tasks inside it. If we plan on  working on more than one version of OpenCms, we should edit the build.xml file to  change the project name from OpenCms to OpenCms_7RC2. This will prevent our  multiple OpenCms build scripts from having the same name of OpenCms in the Ant  build window.  There is also a separate Ant build file for the OpenCms modules contained in the  distribution. This build file is called from the main build file, but is provided to   allow individual module builds, if necessary. To add this build file, select the   Add Buildfiles icon again, and this time add the build.xml file located in  OpenCms_7RC2 modules . We now can use the Ant build utility to build OpenCms from within Eclipse. There  are several Ant tasks available, out of which, here are the most useful:                   bindist: This build target creates a complete OpenCms distribution along  with all the modules. It is the same distribution that would be downloaded  from the OpenCms web site. clean: This build target is used to clean up the build. All compiled classes  and jars from a previous build are removed. jar: This target creates the opencms.jar file tomcat.copy: This target copies the newly built opencms.jar file into the  Tomcat application server directory. jboss.copy: This target copies the newly built opencms.jar file into the Jboss  application directory. war: This target builds a opencms.war file that contains all the components  selected for the distribution.  Building OpenCms outside of Eclipse Using Ant If we want to build OpenCms from a command line, outside of the Eclipse  environment, we just have to provide the property values for the build. To do this,  we can create a text file containing the build properties and specify it on the Ant  command line. For example, the opencms.properties file might look like:  app.name = opencms tomcat.home = D: apache-tomcat-5.5.20 opencms.output = D: AntBuild opencms.input.externlibs = D: libs modules.common.selection = all  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2  The build can then be run with the Ant command:  >ant –propertyfile opencms.properties [target]  Debugging OpenCms in Eclipse Now that we can build OpenCms from source, we will be able to run it in a  debugging environment. Although we do not want to modify the OpenCms source  code, running through a debugger is a great way of getting a better understanding  of how OpenCms works. This will help us when we create our own java classes that  extend OpenCms. In order to debug, we may want to control our application server,  from within Eclipse.  There are a number of Eclipse plug-ins available, that allow us to control the Tomcat  application server. We will use the Sysdeo plug-in, which can be downloaded from  the following location:  http:  www.eclipsetotale.com tomcatPlugin.html  The installation is very straightforward and the instructions are found on the web  site. Now that we have everything we need, the steps to debug OpenCms are simple:  1.   Install OpenCms according to the OpenCms distribution instructions. After it  has successfully installed, stop the application server.   2.  Use the jar Ant build target to build a debug version of the opencms.jar file. 3.  Use the tomcat.copy Ant build target to copy the jar into our OpenCms   installation directory.  4.  Start the Tomcat server using the Sysdeo plug-in. 5.  Set a breakpoint in the OpenCms code and step through it.  OpenCms code and step through it.  We now will be able to peek into the inner workings of OpenCms using the Eclipse  development environment.  [ 45 ]   Developing in OpenCms  Setting Up an Eclipse Environment  without Building OpenCms As mentioned earlier, it is not necessary for us to build OpenCms if we just want  to develop code. In this case however, we want to create a library that allows us  to easily reference the OpenCms java files. To do this within Eclipse, we must first  go to the Window > Preferences screen and expand the Java > Build Path > User  Libraries node:  Click the New… button and enter the name of our new library, OpenCms_7RC2, and  then click OK. We now specify the jar files we want to put into our library, by using  the Add JARs… button. In the dialog window, navigate to the OpenCms installation  and select the opencms.jar file. Any new project we create will be able to add this  Library to the build path and use the OpenCms API.  [ 46 ]   Summary We have discussed different types of development environments that are suitable  for different levels of development. We have now understood how WebDAV can be  utilized to improve the way we interact with the OpenCms VFS. We now have the  basics we will need to develop our site. Later on, we will utilize these development  environments while building our site code.  Chapter 2  [ 47 ]    Our First Module  Now that we have set up a development environment we can begin the process of  developing the site. However, before we can actually start coding, there are some  tasks that we need to complete. The first task is to design and create our content  types. While doing this, we have to make sure we can easily package up our efforts.  This will make it easier for us to manage and distribute the code to other systems. As  we have already touched upon, support for this is provided through modules. In this  chapter, we will create a module and discuss the following:                       Understanding OpenCms modules Creating an OpenCms module Creating a structured content type for a blog entry A close look at rules for creating OpenCms schema files Registering a content type with OpenCms A tour of the User Interface Widgets and their options Nesting Content Definitions Using Validating XML editors for editing configuration files Organizing content for the blog site Using Eclipse for module development  At the end of the chapter, we will have a content type that will be used to contain  the site data. We will build on this in the following chapter, by developing site  templates. We will also have a module to contain the content types and templates.   Our First Module Understanding OpenCms Modules  The module framework is a flexible mechanism both for packaging resources together  and extending OpenCms. Resources placed within a module package may be easily  managed and distributed to other OpenCms installations. There is no restriction on the  types of resources that may be part of a module. They usually consist of things such as  JSP code, java libraries, class files, property files, and images.  Apart from being used as a container to hold things, a module may be used to  extend OpenCms. OpenCms provides support for this by looking for certain module  attributes and sending event notifications that may be acted upon. A module may  use or ignore these things, based on what it is intended to do. Let's look at some of  the types of modules that may be created and at how they must be constructed.  Common Module Types Due to the flexibility of the module mechanism, there is no specific attribute that  is used to determine a modules type. However, here are some examples of typical  module types one might find:                    Content Type Module: This type of module contains XML data type  definitions and resources that allow for new resource types to be introduced  to OpenCms. Template Module: This module type contains templates for a site. The  templates are based upon the requirements of a given site and are tied  to specific content types. Thus, the module is usually dependant upon a  Content Type Module. Content Module: This module type may contain site content. Although  the database export feature may also be used to manage site content, it is  sometimes advantageous to use a module for this. Extension Module: This type of module contains class files and jar files that  add new features or change existing features. Integration Module: This type of module contains JSP, class files, and jar files  that integrate a third party technology. For example, a struts module may be  used to add struts support to OpenCms. Admin Module: This type of module contains class files and JSP files that  add an administrative interface.  These module types are based on how they are structured and what they contain.  There is no hard and fast rule that governs what is in a module, or how it is structured.  Often, a single module may be used to contain all these things. However, higher reuse  can be achieved by using a granular module structure as described above.  [ 50 ]   Chapter 3  Module Events Modules may take advantage of advanced OpenCms features through module  events. Module events are sent from OpenCms during the lifecycle of a module and  can be acted upon with a Java class. The Java class is usually contained within the  module and is thus installed along with it. To receive the module events, the class  must implement the org.opencms.modules.I_CmsModuleAction interface, and  must be specified as the Action class in the module definition. This can be done via  the Module Management interface.  Module events allow for a setup or termination procedure to be performed, as well  as any actions that should take place during publish. A module may also register  itself as an event listener, if it needs to act upon any resource-change-events that  occur. These types of events are sent using the I_CmsEventListener interface,  from which module events are derived. Though we will not cover module events  in more detail, we may inspect the I_CmsModuleAction and I_CmsEventListener  interfaces, if a better understanding is needed.  Exporting and Importing Modules After a module has been created, it can be exported using the Workplace  Administration Module Management interface. When a module is exported, all the  resources contained directly within its folder and any external resources it references  are extracted and placed into a .zip file. The file is written to disk in the WEB- INF\packages\modules directory on the server that OpenCms is running on. This  zip file may be transported to another system and then imported using the same  administrative interface.  When a module is imported the following things will occur:  1.  The module directory structure is created. 2.  Resources in the module directory are imported. 3.  Resources outside the module directory are imported. 4.  The module is published. 5.  Any resources marked as export points  described a little later on  are written   to disk in the appropriate location.  The important things to take note of are that resources outside of the module  directory are retained in their original locations, and that any export points are  written to disk. By retaining resources outside of the module directory, a module  may be used to manage any resources in the VFS. We will make use of this in the  later chapters when we create other module types. Also, the fact that marked   [ 51 ]   Our First Module  resources are written to the disk allows us to place properties, jar files, web  configuration files, and classes in the module. We will also take advantage of this,   later on.  Now that we have a better understanding of modules, we'll go through the process  of creating one.   Creating a Module The first JSP we created in Chapter 2 was a standard JSP page. While it is possible to  build a site using just JSP pages and Java Beans, such a design would require content  authors to understand JSP code. To get around this, we will instead use a design  that uses site templates to separate content from presentation. The template code is  responsible for controlling the presentation and features of the site, while the content  resides elsewhere and may be edited by non-technical people. OpenCms requires  that templates be placed inside modules. Let's create a module by clicking the Module Management icon in the  Administrative View of the Workplace Explorer. When we click on the New Module  icon, we are presented with these entry fields:                        Package Name: This field contains the name of the module. Modules within This field contains the name of the module. Modules within  the name of the module. Modules within  OpenCms should follow the Java naming convention used for packages. Module Name: This is a human readable name for the module. It is for  documentation purposes. Module Description: This may contain a description of the module. It is for  documentation purposes. Module Version: This contains a version number for the module. The  version number is a serial number that gets incremented at the time of  editing or exporting the module. As such, care should be taken while using  the version number for serious tracking purposes. Module Group: Module group names are used to collate modules together  in the Administrative view. Action class: This field is provided to allow our module to hook into  OpenCms events. If used, the field must contain the name of a java class  implementing the I_CmsModuleAction interface. The interface is called  during certain module actions, allowing the module to initialize or register as  an event listener. We will go over this in more detail, later in this book. Author name: This field provides for the module author's name and is for  the purpose of documentation only.  [ 52 ]   Author email: This field provides for the module author's email and is for  the purpose of documentation only.  The next group of fields control whether or not folder locations will be created for  the module:  Chapter 3  Create Module folder: If checked, OpenCms will create a folder in the VFS  to hold our module. The folder name will match the Package Name field and  will reside underneath the  system modules  folder. Create templates subfolder: If checked, a subfolder within our module will  be created with the name of templates. This folder is used by OpenCms to  contain templates. Create elements subfolder: This subfolder is used to contain additional code  that may be utilized by templates, or our module. Create resources subfolder: This folder can contain resources that the  module may use, such as images. Create classes subfolder: The classes folder may contain java classes or  property files. We will go over this folder in more detail, in a later chapter. Create lib subfolder: This folder may contain any Java Library  .jar  files that  are to be included with our module.                       Let's create a new module using the following values:  [ 53 ]   Our First Module  Make sure all the options are selected in the Module folders section and click OK  to create the module. A location will get created for us in the VFS for our module.  Switch to the Explorer view and make sure the root     site is selected, and then  navigate to the  system modules location. We should see the newly created folders  for our module:  Now we can proceed with creating a content type definition and  then building a  template for it.  Structured Content Types Support for structured content is a key feature of OpenCms. Structured content types  allow different templates to be used to re-skin a site, or to share content with other  sites that have a different look. Structured content types are defined by creating  XSD schemas and placing them into modules. Once a new content type has been  defined, the Workplace Explorer provides a user interface to create new instances  of the content and allows it to be edited. There are some sample content types and  templates that come with the Template One group of modules. These content types  are very flexible and allow a site to be built using them right away. However, they  may not fit our site requirements. In general, site requirements and features will  determine the design of the structured content types and templates that need to   be developed.  For example, the Deep Thoughts site design requires a content type to contain blog  entries. The BlogEntry type will require these fields:               Blog Title: Text String containing the title of the blog Date: Date field with the creation date of the blog entry Image: Optional image to be used with our blog Alignment: Alignment control for our image Blog Text: HTML editable text of the blog Categories: Selection of categories that we can assign to the blog  [ 54 ]   Creating a BlogEntry Content Type Once we understand the data requirements, we can go ahead and define the XML  schema. Our first task is to map the data fields to data types that OpenCms supports  in structured content. The data types are summarized here:   Chapter 3  Datatype OpenCmsString  OpenCmsHtml  OpenCmsLocale OpenCmsVfsFile OpenCmsVarLink  OpenCmsColor  OpenCmsDateTime OpenCmsBoolean  Description This is suitable for containing string data that is not  meant to contain formatting. This type is meant to contain user editable HTML  markup. The locale type stores Locale information. This data type contains the path to a resource in the VFS. This is a new data type for version 7 that allows storage  of either an internal or external URL. This data type contains a hexadecimal color value stored  in HTML format. This data type contains a date time value. The data type contains either true or false. The default  value of the field, if empty, is false.  Using these data types we can create an XSD schema file for the content type.  Although the XSD follows the standard rules for XML stylesheets, there are certain  rules that must be followed for use within OpenCms.  Required Code for Creating XSD Schema Files To be recognized by OpenCms, the XSD file must follow certain naming conventions  and ordering rules. These rules are listed here:  1.  The first line must define the namespace declaration. This line of code is the   same for all OpenCms XSD files, and is required!  This is how the first line  will look:         <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"           elementFormDefault="qualified">  2.  The next line defines the location of other schema files used by this schema   file. At the very least, it must include a reference to the OpenCms data types.  More complicated XSD schemas may include other schema references, but a  typical reference would look like this:        <xsd:include schemaLocation=                            "opencms:  opencms-xmlcontent.xsd" >  [ 55 ]   Our First Module  The location of the file is prefixed with opencms: and not http: as one  might normally expect. This is because the type is resolved internally  rather than by using an actual file. We'll talk more about this later.  3.  The next line must define a name that will be used as the root element for the   content type. The root element is the containing element name that is used  when an instance of this content is created. The format looks like this:              where NAME is the element name of the content item. Most importantly, note  that the type attribute is prefixed with OpenCms and suffixed with s.  4.  After this is a section that defines the complex type that was declared as the   root element. The format is always the same:                                 <xsd:element name="[NAME]" type="OpenCms[NAME]"                            minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" >                     Again NAME must be the element name of the content item being defined.  5.  Following this is a complex type definition section, which contains the actual   field definitions of the content type. The type attribute of each defined field  may be chosen from the previous table, or may be a reference to another  XSD schema type. By referencing another schema type, it is possible to create  nested type definitions. This will be covered a little later on.  6.  Within the complex type definition, a locale attribute definition is required   even if other locales are not to be used within the content type. This line  always looks like this:         <xsd:attribute name="language" type="OpenCmsLocale"                  use="required" >  7.  Finally there is an optional annotations section, which can contain additional   information used by OpenCms while editing or pre-populating the content  type. We will also cover this section in more detail later on..  [ 56 ]   Putting all this together, we will create a schema file for the BlogEntry content type,  which looks like the following::   Chapter 3  <!-- ========================================================     Content definition schema for the BlogEntry type ========================================================== -->       <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"            elementFormDefault="qualified">                                            <xsd:element name="BlogEntry" type="OpenCmsBlogEntry"                  minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" >                                           <xsd:element name="Title" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="Date" type="OpenCmsDateTime"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="Image" type="OpenCmsVfsFile"                          minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="Alignment" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="BlogText" type="OpenCmsHtml"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="Category" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="10"  >                   <xsd:attribute name="language" type="OpenCmsLocale"               use="required" >                           <!-- Mappings allow data fields to be mapped to content        properties -->  [ 57 ]   Our First Module                                                                      <rule element="BlogText" regex="!.*[Bl]og.*" type=                   "warning" message="${key.editor.warning.BlogEntry.                    dontallowblog${validation.path}}" >                                                                                                     <layout element="Alignment" widget="SelectorWidget"                    configuration="leftrightcenter"  >           <layout element="Category" widget="SelectorWidget"                   configuration="sillyprudenthopefulfearful                                   worrisomeawesome"  >                                                                         <modelfolder uri=" system modules com.deepthoughts.templates                              defaults "  >                   We can now use this definition file although it must be registered with OpenCms,  first. OpenCms does not require the file to reside in any particular location; in fact  it may be placed anywhere in the VFS. However, as we want to create a reusable  content type, we will place it into a module, where it is managed. To do this, we'll  create a new folder in the module named schemas and place the schema file in there.  We will name the file: blogentry.xsd.  [ 58 ]   Chapter 3  Now we need just to register the schema file with OpenCms..  Registering the Content Type To register the schema file with OpenCms, we need to add an entry into the module  database. Modules are defined in an XML configuration database maintained by  OpenCms. For most items, we want to let OpenCms manage the contents of this file  by using the Administrative interface, as no interface has been provided for adding  new content types. We thus have to edit the OpenCms module database file directly.  The module database file can be found at:    WEB-INF config opencms-modules.xml Let's edit this file and add the resource type corresponding to the structured content  type we've defined. It is possible to register resource type definitions in either the  opencms-vfs.xml or the opencms-modules.xml configuration file. However, by  defining resource types in a module, we can ensure that the definition is easily  transported. As our content type will be placed into our module, we have to search  the opencms-modules.xml file for our module name: com.deepthoughts.template We should find the following:    module>      com.deepthoughts.templates               DeepThoughts             <![CDATA[This module contains the definitions for our  content types and the templates for the deepthoughts.com site]]><  description>      0.1                                     [ 59 ]   Our First Module                    <exportpoint uri=" system modules com.deepthoughts.templates                           lib " destination="WEB-INF lib " >         <exportpoint uri=" system modules com.deepthoughts.templates                             classes " destination="WEB-INF classes " >                                      Note that the elements in the module definition coincide with the data provided  earlier in the Administrative interface. We will not go over the format of this file  in detail, as the OpenCms DTD file for this XML file is documented. The DTD file  may be consulted if more information is needed on the elements. To define the  new content type, we need to add two new entries. The first entry defines the new  resource type and goes into the resourcetypes element:         <type class="org.opencms.file.types.CmsResourceTypeXmlContent"           name="blogentry" id="3000">           system modules                     com.deepthoughts.templates schemas blogentry.xsd                    This entry should be inserted right after the   element, and has the  following fields:     type: This element defines a new resource type           class: The attribute specifies a Java class that must  implement the I_CmsResourceType interface. For  structured XML content types, we should always use the  CmsResourceTypeXmlContent class. name: The name attribute refers to the name of our new  resource type. id: This attribute refers to a unique id that is used to identify  the type of our resource. The value should be carefully chosen  as it should not conflict with other resource ids. Resource ids  should never be changed once instances have been created.   [ 60 ]   The second entry we need to create is a menu definition. This allows users to create  a new instance of the resource from the Workplace Explorer. This entry goes within  the explorertypes element:  Chapter 3        <explorertype name="blogentry" key="fileicon.blogentry"                     icon="xmlcontent.gif" reference="xmlcontent">         <newresource uri="newresource_xmlcontent.jsp?                 newresourcetype=blogentry" order="25"                info="desc.blogentry" >                       <accessentry principal="ROLE.WORKPLACE_USER"                                       permissions="+r+v+w+c" >                    The fields for this entry are:     explorertype: This element defines how the Workplace Explorer presents a  user interface for our resource                name: This is the name of our resource type. key: This attribute refers to an entry in a properties file   described later  that contains label text for the UI. Placing   the text into a properties file allows the user interface to   be localized. icon: This attribute refers to the name of an image resource  used by the Workplace Explorer for our resource type. For  now, we will use an existing image: xmlcontent.gif. reference: This attribute is used for content types that are  derived from other content types. All XML structured content  types should refer to the base XMLContent type and should  thus use the value xmlcontent.     newresource: This element defines how the Workplace Explorer will create  instances of our resource.  uri: This refers to the URI that is called to instantiate a new  instance of our resource. For most resource types, we can  use one of the default JSP files in the  system workplace  commons folder. For all XML structured content types, we  can use the newresource_xmlcontent.jsp file and set the  newresourcetype parameter to our resource name.  [ 61 ]   Our First Module              order: This attribute sets the order in which the item will  appear in the Workplace Explorer. Items with lower numbers  will appear before the ones with higher numbers. info: This attribute refers to an entry in a properties file that  contains a description of the content type for the UI.     accesscontrol accessentry: These elements allow access control to be  applied to the resource type  principal: This is the principal to which we want to apply   a permission. permission: This is the permission mask that the given  principal will have.  After adding the code and saving the file, the application server must be restarted.  We can then go into the Workplace Explorer and create a new instance of the data  type. However, when we do this, we will see the following error:  The error occurs when OpenCms cannot find the definition of the property  surrounded by the ??? characters. The Workplace Explorer looks for property  definitions in a workplace.properties file stored under the  \ WEB-INF\classes directory. Each module, containing a content type definition, may  have its own properties file. Placing the string definitions in the properties file allows  for the user interface to be localized.   The properties file must be stored in a subdirectory, with a name that matches the  module name. The entries in the property file consist of name‑value pairs. The  Workplace Explorer retrieves a string value from the properties file, using the key,  and displays the corresponding string. The explorertype.key and newresource. info elements described previously are examples of references to this property file.   [ 62 ]   Chapter 3  The properties file may also contain text labels and help text for each field appearing  on the editing form of the content type. The editing form is automatically built by  OpenCms when an instance of the content type is edited. Normally, each form field  has a label that corresponds to data field name. However, it is possible to change   the label and  also have a help bubble displayed next to it with some information   text to aid data entry. These are added by creating property file entries with the  following format:  label.[CONTENT_TYPE].[FIELD]=FIELD_LABEL  CONTENT_TYPE is the name of the structured content type, FIELD is the particular  field name, and FIELD_LABEL is the label for the field. The help text has a   similar format:  label.[ [CONTENT_TYPE].[FIELD].help=FIELD_HELP_TEXT  Adding this entry will cause a help bubble icon to appear next to the entry field.  Hovering over the icon will cause the text to appear in a tooltip.  Localizing messages strings in properties files Property values in message strings are easily localized in OpenCms.  When a property file is loaded, OpenCms attempts to locate a   locale‑specific version of it by combining the locale in the filename. For  example, the German locale name is de. In this case, OpenCms will look  for a file named workplace_de.properties to contain the localized strings.  If a locale specific version cannot be found then the default filename  without a locale suffix will be used. A common practice is to have several  locale files present: workplace_de.properties – German strings workplace_en.properties – English strings A sibling is then created for the one to be used as the default: workplace.properties à workplace_en.properties - sibling This way the default locale can be easily set and changed if necessary.  This is what the file looks like for the BlogEntry content type:    This property file contains the localized strings for    the BlogEntry XML type    text used to display the type of content being created fileicon.blogentry = Blog Entry  [ 63 ]   Our First Module   description of the content type desc.blogentry=A Blog Entry is our daily blog content   User Interface Labels per field label.BlogEntry.Title = Title label.BlogEntry.Date = Blog Date label.BlogEntry.Image = Image  optional  label.BlogEntry.Alignment = Image Alignment label.BlogEntry.BlogText = Blog label.BlogEntry.Category = Category label.BlogEntry.Comment = User Comment   Help Icon text per field label.BlogEntry.Title.help = Enter a Title for the Blog Entry label.BlogEntry.Date.help = This contains the creation date for the  blog.

However,  the problem with this is that we would need to remember to do this again when the  module is distributed to another machine. Fortunately, OpenCms provides a solution  to this through module export points.  A module export point is a module setting that allows a resource in the VFS to have a  corresponding export location on the real file system. When the module is published,  all defined export points will get copied to the real file system. This feature allows  resources to be managed from within a module, but allows them to be placed onto  the real file system upon import. Note that because OpenCms is a web application,  exported files may only be placed underneath the installed location of the OpenCms  web application.  Now let's create the properties file. From the Workplace Explorer, select the root  folder and then navigate to the module. Expand the classes com deepthoughts  templates subfolder, and create a new text file named workplace.properties. Place  the property definition code into the file, and save it. To support localization, we   [ 64 ]   Chapter 3  would just need to create additional properties files with localized definitions. One  file would have to be created per locale, and would be named according to the locale  it supports. For example, in German, a file named workplace_de.properties would  have to be created.  Next we have to ensure that the file gets exported. Adding it as an export point is  done through the Module Management panel of the Administrative interface. Locate  the module, click on it to edit it, and then use the Module exportpoints icon to add  the export point. Notice that the classes folder is already specified as an export point.  This is because the option to create the classes folder was clicked when the module  was created. OpenCms automatically recognizes this folder as an export point and  adds it for us. This means that, in fact, there is nothing for us to do; the resource will  automatically get exported. The only thing left to do is to Publish the module. This will cause the new content  types to become available to the Online project. It will also cause the properties file to  get exported to the WEB-INF classes folder. After publishing, remember to restart  OpenCms. After this, new instances of the Blog Entry data type can be created  by  using the New button in the Workplace Explorer:  The new resource dialog will appear and will contain the new content type as a  choice. Remember that if the order needs to be changed, it can be done by modifying  the order attribute in the explorertype section of the XML configuration file.  [ 65 ]   Our First Module Additional Schema Features  As mentioned earlier, there are a rich variety of options available when designing a  structured content type. OpenCms provides support for these features through use  of the xsd:annotation section of the schema file. The following sections provide  detailed information about additional features that may be used, when designing  content types.  Field Mappings Mappings allow for data fields to be mapped to a property  or attribute.                    This is a useful feature to collate content based on fields contained inside the XML.  OpenCms provides API support for filtering items based on values of properties,  but not for values of XML fields. This is because doing something like that would  require opening each XML resource, and parsing it. However, by mapping a data  field to a property value, this is easily accomplished. If a data field is mapped, then  the corresponding property value is updated whenever the XML content is saved.  Data field values only get copied to property values, and this occurs only if the XML  content editor is used to make the content change. If an XML content field is updated  programmatically, then no update will be made to the property file. Moreover, if the  corresponding property value is changed, there will be no update made to the XML  data field. In other words, the change is unidirectional. The syntax for creating a  mapping value is:          FIELD: This is the name of the data field we are mapping. TYPE: There are three types of mappings:           attribute: There are only two available attributes:  datereleased and dateexpired property: This maps the field to a property value. If the  specified property value does not exist it will get created. propertyList: This allows for multiple instances of the same  field to get mapped to a single property value. It should be  used for data fields that repeat, such as the Category field in  our BlogEntry schema. Multiple values will get placed into  the property field separated by a vertical bar character.  [ 66 ]   Chapter 3     SCOPE: This is an optional scope field which allows individual or global  property values to be mapped. The possible option values are: individual: Map to an individual property  Default if   not present . global: Map to a global property.        For the BlogEntry content type, we have mapped the Title field to the Title  property and the Date field to the datereleased attribute.  Field Validations OpenCms supports basic validation rules for data fields. The validationrules  element allows these rules to be defined through regular expression syntax checking:     <rule element="BlogText" regex="!.*[Bl]og.*" type="warning"  rule element="BlogText" regex="!.*[Bl]og.*" type="warning"             message="${key.editor.warning.BlogEntry.dontallowblog                     ${validation.path}}" >    If a match is found on the syntax rule, then the message is displayed. The message  text is defined in a properties file. There are two levels of error checking: warning  and error. The warning level will present a warning message to the user if the save  action is pressed, but will allow the content to be saved. The error level will present  an error message, and will not allow the content to be saved. For our BlogEntry  content type, we have included a validation rule that provides a warning message if  the word 'Blog' is used in our blog.  If more complex validation is required it is possible to create a custom validation  handler by adding a Java class that implements the I_CmsXmlContentHandler  interface.  Default Field Values Data fields may have a default value assigned to them by setting the defaults  element. Each entry contains the field name along with the default value. For  example, the blog entry date field is populated by default with the current time. This  is done by using the ${currenttime} macro, another feature of OpenCms. There are  several macros that may be used both from within schema files and templates. For a  complete listing of the available macros the org.opencms.util.CmsMacroResolver  java file should be examined.                   [ 67 ]   Our First Module Localization OpenCms provides localization support for the content editor form. As described  earlier, the field labels may be placed in a properties file. The location of the  properties file may be specified in a resourcebundle element:     The name attribute contains the name of the folder containing the properties file. For  the blog content type the properties file is located at:    \classes\com\deepthoughts\templates\workplace.properties The format of the properties file is as described earlier.  Content Relationships OpenCms Version 7 introduces a new content relationship engine that maintains  relationships formed between content items. There are two general classes of  relationships that may be formed: strong links and weak links. A strong link is  formed when the existence of the linked child item is crucial to the function or  display of the containing parent. An example of a strong link is a stylesheet, where  the page does not display properly if the stylesheet is missing.  A weak link occurs when the child item is not crucial to the parent. An example of  this might be a contained link that is displayed on the page. The page can still be  displayed, but the link will not appear.  Content relationships may be formed either implicitly or explicitly. A content  relationship is formed implicitly whenever a content item is inserted into an  unstructured field using an OpenCms editing form. For example, consider an image  that has been selected from an image gallery and inserted into an HTML field of a  content item. In this case, a relationship will automatically be added from the content  item to the image. If a user attempts to later delete the image in the Workplace  Explorer, then a warning message appears informing the user where it is used, and  that broken links will occur. At the time the relationship is formed, OpenCms will  parse the child item and decide whether it should be a weak or a strong link.  Explicit content relationships may only be formed programmatically or may be  declared from within a content type definition. When links are formed this way, it is  up to the programmer to decide the type of link and how it should be handled. To  support link declaration in structured types the relation element may be used in  the XSD file:  [ 68 ]   Chapter 3    relations>     <relation element="[ELEMENT]" type="[TYPE]"                 invalidate="[INVALIDATE]"  >    The options for the tag are:                      ELEMENT: This is the name of the data field the relation applies to. TYPE: This is the type of relationship.  weak: Relationship is a weak link. strong: Relationship is a strong link.  INVALIDATE: Determines how validations are handled.   false: Disable link checking. true node: Invalidate just this node if broken. parent: Invalidate the entire parent node in nested content.  The INVALIDATE attribute may only be used for elements that are optional, and is  used to control the link checking behavior of that element. If set to false, then link  checking will be disabled. If set to true, then link checking will be enabled. A third  option of parent may be used to cause a parent node to become invalid if the link  is broken. This feature is useful for a compound content type where a broken child  item should cause the entire included type to become invalid. For example, consider  the following content structure:                                                       Here, the BlogComment element is an optional item that may appear multiple times.  It is a nested content type which consists of an Image and a Description. In this  case, we might define a relationship and set the invalidate type to parent so that if  the Image is missing, the entire BlogComment will get ignored.  Content Previewing The structured content editor has a preview action allowing editors to preview  content before saving. By default, this action is not enabled for structured content  types, but may be turned on by adding the preview element:     [ 69 ]   Our First Module  Although the blog entry schema file is using the   element, an  error will occur if we try to use it. This is because a template is necessary  to preview the content. In the next chapter, we will perform that step.  When content is edited, a temporary copy of the file is created and the changes are  made to it, instead of the original. The temporary file has the same name as the  original file but is prefixed with the '~' character. When the content is saved, the  original is overwritten with the temporary copy. A macro is provided to resolve the  name of the temporary file in the schema definition.  Creating Content Using a Model It is often useful to be able to create a new content item from an existing model. This  is easily supported with the modelfolder element:     The specified folder contains the location of content types that may be used as a  model. Each instance may have the data fields pre‑filled, as desired. When a new  instance of the content type is created, one of the models can be chosen:  Choosing one of the items will copy it to the new instance, having pre‑filled the field.  User Interface Widgets The editing form for content types is built automatically by OpenCms. By default,  each data field has an entry field for entering the field data. Each entry field may be  customized by specifying a user interface widget to be used.  [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  There are several default widgets available to choose from. If the default widgets  are not suitable, then custom ones may be built. Widget definitions are provided  through Java classes that implement the I_CmsWidget interface, and are registered in  the opencms-vfs.xml configuration file. In a later chapter, we show how to create a  custom widget class. The default widgets available are detailed next. DateTimeWidget  This widget provides a popup date time picker allowing the user to select a date  and a time.  The resulting value is stored as a string in the format: 07 19 2007 05:05 PM. The  syntax for using this widget is:     BooleanWidget  The Boolean widget provides a simple checkbox.   The resulting value is stored in the data field as a string and is either true or  false. This is the default widget for the OpenCmsBoolean data type. There are no  configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     [ 71 ]   Our First Module ColorPickerWidget  This widget provides a popup window allowing the user to select a color or to enter  a hexadecimal value directly.  The resulting value is stored as a string in HTML hexadecimal format. This is the  default widget used for the OpenCmsColor data type and has no configuration  options. Its syntax is:     DownloadGalleryWidget   This widget provides an interface allowing a user to enter a filename, or to browse to  a download gallery, and select a resource from it.   This widget may be used for either the OpenCmsString or the OpenCmsVfsFile  data types. If used for the OpenCmsString data type, then the value returned is  a string containing the path to the selected resource. If the widget is used for an  OpenCmsVfsFile data type then the returned value is added as a reference. By  adding the item as a reference, the content relationship engine will ensure the  integrity of the link if it is moved later. There are no configuration options for this  widget, and its syntax is:     HtmlGalleryWidget  This widget is similar to the DownloadGalleryWidget except in that it allows the  user to select a snippet of HTML from a gallery.  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  HTML galleries are useful for creating boilerplate HTML that is used often. Items  selected from an HTML gallery are always inserted by value, and never by reference.  The returned value is a literally inserted copy of the selected HTML gallery item.  There are no configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     ImageGalleryWidget  This widget is similar to the DownloadGalleryWidget, except in that it browses  image galleries for images.  It returns data in the same manner depending on which OpenCms data type it is  used for. There are no configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     LinkGalleryWidget This widget provides an interface for the user to enter a link, or to browse to a link  gallery and select a link.   It behaves the same way as other gallery widgets do in that it returns a string or a  reference, depending on which data type it is used for. There are no configuration  options for this widget, and its syntax is:    layout element="FIELD_NAME" widget="StringWidgetPlaintext" >  TableGalleryWidget This widget provides an interface for the user to browse to a table gallery and select  a table.   The widget always inserts a literal copy of the selected table item. There are no  configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     [ 73 ]   Our First Module VfsFileWidget This widget provides the user with a means of browsing for files in the VFS, and  selecting them.   The returned value is a string containing the path to the selected file. The widget  may be used for both the OpenCmsString and OpenCmsVfsFile data types. If used  for the OpenCmsVfsFile data type, then a reference is kept to the selected resource.  The configuration for this widget allows specification of the starting location and  whether to enable the site selector:  <layout element="Element" widget="VfsFileWidget"           configuration="startsite= sites default           somepathhidesiteselector"  >  HtmlWidget  This widget provides a mini WYSIWYG HTML editor. This is the default widget  used for the OpenCmsHtml data type, and is implemented using the open source  FCKeditor  www.fckeditor.net . The widget may be configured by setting the  configuration attribute to a list of configuration options separated by a comma. The  available options are:              anchor: This option adds the anchor button allowing a user to enter a link. css: vfs path to cssfile.css: This allows CSS styles to be rendered in the  WYSIWYG editor. The path should contain the absolute path in the VFS   to a CSS stylesheet. Content within the editor is displayed according to   the stylesheet. formatselect: This presents a selector for using common formatting options. fullpage: This causes the editor to be displayed as a full page. imagegallery, downloadgallery, htmlgallery, tablegallery, linkgallery:  Provides a button to bring up the specified gallery to allow a user to select   an item.  [ 74 ]   Chapter 3               height:${editorheight}: This allows the height to be specified in pixels or %,  for example, 400px. image: This option shows the image dialog button. link: This option shows the link dialog button. source: This option shows a button allowing editors to toggle between source  and WYSIWYG mode. stylesxml: vfs path to stylefile.xml: This option allows a set of custom  styles to be used in the editor. The path must be the absolute path to a file  containing style definitions. The style definitions must be an XML file that is  formatted like:                                                                                                                          More details on options for configuring styles can be found by consulting the  FCKeditor site.  table: This option presents a button that brings up a dialog for creating   a table.     Although it is certainly possible and also tempting to use this widget for editing  an entire page, using it in this fashion should be avoided. This is because it limits  content reuse and also encourages non-uniformity of pages. This widget may be  used for either the OpenCmsString or the OpenCmsHtml data type.  Inserted links and content items will be maintained only as references  when used for the OpenCmsHtml data type.  [ 75 ]   Our First Module ComboWidget   The ComboWidget is an interesting user interface widget presenting the user with a  choice of items and a corresponding help text for each item. The help text appears  as an item is hovered over with the mouse. This widget is configured by setting the  configuration attribute to a delimited string of option values and help text. Each  option value and help text pair is delimited with a vertical bar:  <layout element="FIELD_NAME" widget="ComboWidget"   configuration="value='Value 1' help='Value 1 Help'value='Value 2'  help='Value 2 help'"  >  The list of options for this widget is specified using the configuration attribute.  This attribute is commonly used by all multi-option select type widgets to specify  the value settings. The CmsSelectWidgetOptions class located in the org.opencms. widgets package can be consulted to obtain details of the syntax used for the  configuration settings. All multi‑value select widgets are limited, and so the list  options are static and must be defined within each individual XSD file. In a later  chapter, we will develop a custom widget to show how to get around this limitation. SelectorWidget  This widget presents a list of choices in a drop-down select box.   The selected value is returned as a string. The configuration options for this widget  must contain a list of options, delimited by a vertical bar,  to display:  <layout element="Selector" widget="SelectorWidget"           configuration="Option 1Option 2Option 3Option 4"  >  [ 76 ]   MultiSelectWidget  This widget presents a list of choices as a multi-select list box.   Chapter 3  The selected values are returned as a string delimited by commas. The configuration  options for this widget must contain list of options, delimited by a vertical bar ,   to display:  <layout element="Selector" widget="MultiSelectorWidget"           configuration="Option 1Option 2Option 3Option 4"   >  StringWidget This widget provides a basic text input box for entering string data.   The content is not checked or filtered before it is saved, allowing it to contain   HTML mark‑up or code. There are no configuration options for this widget, and its  syntax is:     StringWidgetPlaintext This widget is similar to the StringWidget except in that the content is filtered before  it is saved. Any HTML code is stripped out to leave only the plain text behind. It is  useful for data entry fields where one is required to be sure that no HTML mark‑up is  present. There are no configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     TextareaWidget This widget is similar to the StringWidget except in that it uses a text area field   for input.   [ 77 ]   Our First Module  Content may be entered unfiltered as in the StringWidget. The number of rows may  be specified in the configuration field:  <layout element="FIELD_NAME" widget="TextareaWidget"           configuration="ROWS" >  TextareaWidgetPlaintext  This widget is similar to TextareaWidget except in that it strips out any HTML  mark‑up before saving, leaving only plain text. The number of rows may be specified  in the configuration field:  <layout element="FIELD_NAME" widget="TextareaWidgetPlaintext"           configuration="ROWS" >  DisplayWidget The display widget is a read‑only output widget that displays a field value on the  entry form.   Since the field is read‑only for editors, it must be populated by using the default  attribute, as shown in the following XSD code listing. It is possible to use HTML as  long as XML entity values are used instead of angle brackets. For example, using this  default setting will populate the data field when a new instance is created:  <default element="FIELD_NAME" value="This is read only, &lt;b&gt;non- editable&lt; b&gt;text with HTML.&lt;br&gt;This is another line of  text." >  There are no configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     GroupWidget  This widget presents an interface for selecting a group name defined in the  OpenCms Group Administration screens.   The returned value is the name of the selected group. There are no configuration  options for this widget, and its syntax is:     [ 78 ]   UserWidget  This widget presents an interface for selecting a user name defined in the OpenCms  User Administration screens.   Chapter 3  The returned value is the name of the selected user. There are no configuration  options for this widget, and its syntax is:     Additional Widgets  There are a few other available widgets which are not enabled by default. They are  easily enabled, by editing the WEB-INF config opencms-vfs.xml file and adding  these lines of code to the   section:  <widget class="org.opencms.widgets.CmsRadioSelectorWidget"           alias="RadioSelectWidget" > <widget class="org.opencms.widgets.CmsPasswordWidget"           alias="PasswordWidget" > <widget class="org.opencms.widgets.CmsPrincipalWidget"           alias="PrincipalWidget" > <widget class="org.opencms.widgets.CmsOrgUnitWidget"           alias="OrgUnitWidget" >  After restarting OpenCms, we will have a few additional widgets available to   choose from: RadioSelectWidget  This widget provides a selection of options using a radio button interface.  The selected value is returned as a string. The configuration options for this widget  must contain list of options to display, delimited by a vertical bar:  <layout element="Selector" widget="RadioSelectWidget"           configuration="Option 1Option 2Option 3Option 4"  >  [ 79 ]   Our First Module PasswordWidget  This widget presents a text input area that will contain asterisks when data is input.  It is useful for password entry fields.   There are no configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     PrincipalWidget  This widget is similar to the CmsGroupWidget except in that it allows for selection of  a Principal.   There are no configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     OrgUnitWidget This widget is also similar to the CmsGroupWidget except in that it allows for  selection of an OrgUnit.   There are no configuration options for this widget, and its syntax is:     Nested Content Definitions Sometimes it is necessary to create a content definition that includes another  definition. For example, let's say we want to support the ability for users to add  comments to blog entries. For each comment, we'd want to capture the   following fields:          User name: This would contain the name of the user making the comment.  We would want to only allow registered users to add comments Date: The date and time of the comment Comment: The comment  [ 80 ]      Approved: This would provide us some control over the comment appearing  on the site  The resulting schema file might then look like this:  Chapter 3  <!-- =======================================================     XSD content definition file for the BlogComment type  ======================================================== --> <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"        elementFormDefault="qualified">                                                <xsd:element name="BlogComment" type="OpenCmsBlogComment"                            minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" >                                                         <xsd:element name="User" type="OpenCmsString"                             minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >              <xsd:element name="Date" type="OpenCmsDateTime"                             minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >              <xsd:element name="Comment" type="OpenCmsString"                             minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >              <xsd:element name="Approved" type="OpenCmsBoolean"                             minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >                     <xsd:attribute name="language" type="OpenCmsLocale"                          use="optional" >              This content type defines a blog comment. As each blog would need to have multiple  comments attached to it, the blog content type needs a new field allowing multiple  instances of the comment.

The total number of comments has been  arbitrarily limited to ten. After making these changes, the user interface form will  have the additional comment fields in them:  Site visitors would not use the content editor that blog editors would use, as this is  available only in the Offline project. To support comment additions, we will also  need to create a series of screens for user registration and comment posting. To  support comment posting, we will need to write some code that populates the fields.  Later on in this book, we will go over how to accomplish this.  [ 83 ]   Our First Module  Editing Configuration Files with Validating  Editors As mentioned earlier, both OpenCms XML configuration files and XSD structured  content schema files use internal URI references:  XML File DTD  Schema File XSD  <!DOCTYPE opencms SYSTEM "http:  www.opencms.org dtd 6.0 opencms-vfs. dtd">     When these files are parsed, the references are resolved internally with memory  based resolvers. This makes it difficult to edit the files using external validating XML  editors such as XML Spy, Oxygen XML, or Stylus Studio. However, we can easily get  around this by creating local files with the type definitions. For XSD files, we can use  this schema file:  <!— this schema file defines the OpenCms Data types available     for use with content definition XSD files -->   <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema" elementFormDe fault="qualified">                                                                                                                                  <xsd:attribute name="enabled" type="xsd:boolean"                         use="optional"  >                       [ 84 ]   Chapter 3                              <xsd:attribute name="enabled" type="xsd:string"                                use="optional"  >                                                       <xsd:element name="link" type="OpenCmsLink" minOccurs="0"                          maxOccurs="unbounded"  >                            <xsd:sequence                                                       <xsd:attribute name="type" type="OpenCmsLinkType"                        use="required"  >        <xsd:attribute name="internal" type="xsd:boolean"                        use="required"  >                                                                                       <xsd:pattern             value="[a-z]{2,3} _[A-Z]{2} _[a-zA-Z0-9]  {0,1} {0,1}"  >                                                          <xsd:pattern          value=" [a-f][A-F][0-9] {3}  [a-f][A-F][0-9] {3} ?"  >                  [ 85 ]   Our First Module  We can then temporarily change the reference in the XSD schema file we need to edit  so that it references the local schema file. This allows the validating editor to resolve  the reference. After editing the file, remember to change the line back to reference the  internal definition.  OpenCms XML configuration files can be edited in a similar fashion. While these  files are easily editable with a text editor, it is sometimes useful to use a validating  XML editor. In this case, we don't need to create our own definition file as all the  DTD files for OpenCms configuration files can be found in the source code at   this location:    src org opencms configuration *.dtd  To use a validating editor for configuration files, this procedure can be used:  1.  Copy the DTD files from the source directory to the WEB‑INF\config   directory  2.  Edit the copied DTD files, changing all internal DTD references to local ones.   For example: Change this:  <!ENTITY % opencms-explorertypes SYSTEM "http:  www.opencms. org dtd 6.0 opencms-explorertypes.dtd"> To this: <!ENTITY % opencms-explorertypes SYSTEM "opencms-explorertypes. dtd">  3.  To edit an XML configuration file, temporarily change the DTD reference to   the local DTD. For example: Change this:  <!DOCTYPE opencms SYSTEM "http:  www.opencms.org dtd 6.0  opencms-modules.dtd">  To this:    4.  The file can be edited with most XML editors. After finishing with editing,  don't forget to revert the change performed in step 3, or OpenCms will fail   to start.  [ 86 ]   Chapter 3  Organizing the Content Now that we have a content type to hold the site content, we can start creating new  blog entries. However, before getting too far into this we should give some thought  as to how the content should be organized. We will want to do this in a way that  makes it easy for the content editors to locate the blog entries, as the volume of  content keeps increasing with time. We also want to ensure that it is organized in  a way that lends itself to how it should be displayed. We also want to take into  consideration any special requirements of the site for displaying the content. For  example, the blog site design features an archive listing on the right hand side used  for browsing past blogs:  It is easy to support all these requirements in the case of the blog site, by using a  folder structure that is organized according to date:  We will use the Title property of each folder as the display text. By organizing blog  entries into subfolders, we also limit the number of blog entries that will appear in  one location. Now we are ready to start creating some blog entries. Let's go ahead  and create a few sample entries  so that they are available for use in our Chapter 4.  Summary In this chapter, we've discussed the concept and structure of modules, and shown  how a module is created. We then covered structured content types and created one  using the BlogEntry content type for the example website. We went over the rules for  creating a structured type, and discussed how it is best to place it within a module.  The steps necessary to register a content type were also covered, and we looked at  options for using widgets. We also talked about ways to use external editors for  schema and configuration files. Finally, we talked about designing folder structures  for our content, to support our site design. In the next chapter, we will go over  templates and will create a template to display our blog entries.  [ 87 ]    Developing Templates  In this chapter, we will create templates to display the blog content for which we  have just finished creating a content type. During the template development, we will  also go over these topics:                   A review of the site design page layout Understanding how templates get loaded Using the template API Extending and using OpenCms beans in template code Using JSTL tag library Template caching Understanding resource collectors Discussion of the Template One module and template  We will not implement all the site features in our template in this chapter, as some of  them will be completed in the later chapters. However, at the end of this chapter, we  will be able to use the templates to display the homepage and individual blog pages.  Review of the Page Layout We'll start off by going back  and looking again at the site requirements. From the  design we see that we need a homepage template, a blog template, and a search  template. We also see that we need to support the direct editing feature, which  allows previewed content in Offline mode to be edited directly. On each mockup,  we can see where the data fields from the BlogEntry content type will need to go. To  make the site easier to update, we will also make these common page areas editable:         The page header The page footer The text advertisements on the right panel   Developing Templates  Although these content items are part of each page, they are not blog entries; so we  will need to use some other content type to store them in. These items also appear on  every page of the site, so they need to be shared somewhere. A good place to put the  content is  the index.html file of the site. This file will represent the homepage and  can be easily found by other pages needing to reuse its content. But we still need a  content type to store the pieces into.  Rather than designing a new content type just for a single instance of content, we  can use the xmlpage content type. The xmlpage content type is designed to be used  with the TemplateOne sample code that comes with OpenCms, but is also suitable  for other uses. It appears as the Page with free text choice while creating a new piece  of content from the Workplace Explorer. This content type is a good choice, because  its design accommodates an arbitrary number of ad hoc content fields which are  of CmsXmlHtmlValue type. This works out perfectly for our site as we need to have  three user editable HTML fields: Header, Footer, and Ads. Let's go ahead and create the content. Select Page with free text from the Workplace  Explorer to create a new xmlpage resource:  As we intend to use this content for the homepage, it will be named index.html. The  BlogHomepage.jsp template has not yet been created. So, for now, we can choose  the default template –OpenCms Template one. Note that the Copy body from drop  down presents a list of options that can be used to create the content. Each item in  the list comes from an xmlpage instance that is used as a model. Remember that we  had mentioned this in the previous chapter. As there is no model for the homepage  content let's choose the 1 column, 1 row model, and then click Continue.  [ 90 ]   Chapter 4  Since we are not using the xmlpage content type as it was designed for TemplateOne  use, we can ignore most of the property fields. However, we do want to make use of  the Title, which we will use as the page title. Make sure the Title field contains Deep  Thoughts, and click Finish.  [ 91 ]   Developing Templates  Now, we need to manually edit the XML content, to put in the fields we want,  rather than the ones that came from the model we have selected. Remember that  the xmlpage content type allows for ad hoc fields. So, we are able to add our own  field names. This is unlike most other content types, which have strict requirements  for field names according to their schema design. To edit the XML, click on the  resource in the Workplace Explorer, and select the Edit controlcode option from the  Advanced menu:  This will bring us to the text editor, where the raw XML content of the file   is displayed.    <pages xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNam espaceSchemaLocation="http:  www.opencms.org dtd 6.0 xmlpage.xsd">                                                                                                    [ 92 ]   The model we selected for the content has a single data field named text1, and  defines it for two locales. For our use, we will replace this with our own definitions.  This is easily done by replacing the text1 field with our field name. We then add the  additional fields that are needed, ending up with this:  Chapter 4    <pages xmlns:xsi="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNam espaceSchemaLocation="http:  www.opencms.org dtd 6.0 xmlpage.xsd">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Notice the three elements that have been added: Header, Footer, and Ads. These  elements have been added for the German  de  and English  en  locales after saving  the file, we can use the edit page command to bring up the HTML WYSIWYG  editor. Go ahead and do this, and add some content for each of the three page areas:  Header, Ads, and Footer.  [ 93 ]   Developing Templates  Now we should have an index.html page for the homepage and some blog entries  for the site. This should be enough content for us to create some templates, so let's  move on to that step.  Templates in OpenCms We've gone over how to create instances of structured content in OpenCms and are  now ready to start creating templates. In general, a template is written in JSP, and  contains code to take a structured content type and display its data onto a page.  When the JSP file runs, it needs to access the content item being viewed and may  also need to access other content in the VFS. Several JSP tag libraries are available  for doing this. The use of the tag libraries is straightforward and is well documented  in the OpenCms documentation set. So, we will not cover that topic in this book.  Instead, we will take a step further by looking at how to access the template API  from JSP code and custom Java beans.  Creating the Templates We probably want to ensure that content editors are not able to access the template  code, and also that the templates are easily installed on other machines. This is easily  accomplished by placing the template code into our com.deepthoughts.templates  module. In fact, it is necessary for templates to reside inside a module, as the  Workplace Explorer dialog box used to create new content populates the template  field by scanning the templates folder of all modules.  We start out with two templates, one for the homepage and the other for individual  blog entries. To do this, first navigate to the module's templates folder in the  Workplace Explorer and then create the new JSP resource there. The value of the   title field is how the template will appear in the drop‑down list. So let's use the  following names:  After adding these entries, the two templates will appear in the templates   drop-down whenever a new xml resource is created. Next, we have to add the  template code.  [ 94 ]   The Homepage Template We'll start by adding the code for the homepage template, which is in the  BlogHomepage.jsp file. At the top of the JSP file are some declarations and import  classes that are needed:  Chapter 4  <%@page session="true"         import="com.deepthoughts.templates.*"%> <%@taglib prefix="cms"         uri="http:  www.opencms.org taglib cms"%>  Notice that the com.deepthoughts.templates package is imported. Later, we'll  create a Java package that contains custom code to support the template. By putting  support code into Java classes, we reduce the amount of scriptlet code in the JSP file  and isolate functionality to the Java code. The OpenCms tag library is also included,  as we want to take advantage of its features. The OpenCms documentation should be  consulted to get a more detailed understanding of the tag library. Next, we declare  and instantiate a Java bean in the template:  <%    create the bean BlogJspTemplate blog=new BlogJspTemplate                 pageContext, request, response ;    get all the blogs in the specified folder     blog.getBlogsInFolder  ;    allow edit mode for offline previewing     blog.editable  ; %>  The BlogJspTemplate class is a custom Java bean, which we will cover in more  detail, a little later on. For now, we should note that after being instantiated, a call is  made to the getBlogsInFolder method. This method exists in a custom Java class  and is responsible for gathering a list of blogs in the current folder. In a little while,  we will go over the Java class in detail.  Another thing to note here is the call to the editable method, which provides  support for the direct edit feature. Normally, we would just use the <cms: editable > tag for this. However, the tag library generates HTML code for the  direct edit buttons, which disturbs the layout of the page. Fortunately, OpenCms  once again provides an easy way to change this behavior by allowing us to specify  our own HTML for the direct edit buttons. This is done in the custom Java code and  is also covered later on.  [ 95 ]   Developing Templates  After the initial code comes the HTML for the head content:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">         <meta http-equiv="Content-Type"            content="text html; charset=utf-8"  >             <link rel="stylesheet"            href="  styles global.css "            type="text css"  >     <script language="JavaScript"              src="  script today.js ">          Here the   tag from the tag library is used to retrieve the title  property value from the content.   The   tag is used around all linked resources. This ensures  that the application context and site context are accounted for correctly.  It also ensures that the links get resolved correctly, if later the page is  statically exported.  Following the head section is the HTML body:                          <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"            width="100%">  It begins by using the   tag to include the Header data field from  the index.html content file we have created earlier. This tag is very flexible and  is used to dynamically include other files from the VFS. The OpenCms tag library  documentation provides full details. One nice aspect of this tag is that it provides for  inclusion of only a section  or element  of a file rather than the entire file. This can be  used for structured XML content files, and even for JSP template files. In the next line  of code, we take advantage of this to include the header element of the common.jsp  file. The common.jsp file is shared between templates and more will be covered on  this later on.   [ 96 ]   The Blog Content Loop After this, comes the section used to display the blog content. It uses a loop to iterate  through all the blogs it finds in the current folder:  Chapter 4                                                                                              <img                 src="  images spacer.gif " alt=""                 eight="1" border="0"  >                <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"                       width="100%">                                      <td width="100%"                  class="blogHeadline">                                                                      <%=BlogJspTemplate.formatDate                   blog.getField "Date" , "dd.MM.yyyy" %>                                                                                                                                            &nbsp;                                                                                                                       TOPICS:&nbsp;                                      [ 97 ]   Developing Templates                                                             &nbsp;                                                                                                                       images spacer.gif "                   alt="" width="10" height="1" border="0"  >   Recall that at the beginning of the template, the getBlogsInFolder method was  used to get a list of blog entries. This list is now iterated over to display each item.  Within the loop, the getField method is used for displaying each blog title. This  method improves upon the   tag by returning a null string if the field  has no value entered. This is also supported in the tag library by using the <cms: contentcheck> tag.  Next to the code displaying the title, there is a call to the   tag.  This tag generates HTML code for a direct edit button to appear during Offline  previewing. Recall that we want to override the default behavior of this tag. To do  this, we just need to ensure that our override takes place using the mode="manual"  attribute on the tag.  Next, we get the date field from the content and format it using the formateDate  bean method. This method takes the date field, which is stored as a long integer, and  uses a format string to return a human readable date.  Recall from the data design that each blog had an optional image associated with  it. To make it easier to display the image, we've added a getBlogImage method to  our bean. The method determines if an image exists, and also takes care of sizing it  properly. Following the image is the text of the blog:       &nbsp;        The trim method trims text to an arbitrary size on the nearest word boundary. We  use it to provide a teaser type display of the blog entries. A link to the full blog entry  is generated with the linkToCurrentItem method.  The content display loop ends with a call to the showTopics method. This method  returns a list of topics that have been assigned to each blog entry. The next section of  the template deals with the displays on the righthand side and bottom of the page.  [ 98 ]   The Sidebar and Footer The code sidebar and footer page areas are common to the homepage and the blog  pages. Code for these common areas has been placed into a single JSP file named  common.jsp. This JSP file is placed into the elements folder of the module, and  included in the template where needed. The sidebar section of the template does this:  Chapter 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &nbsp;                                        &nbsp;                            <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"                              element="footer"  >                        &nbsp;                      We finish up the template by including another common code section for the footer  area. This completes the code for the homepage template. Next, we'll take a look at  the common code elements.  [ 99 ]   Developing Templates  Common Code Elements Anytime HTML or JSP code logic is repeated, it is a good idea to factor it into  common code fragments which can be reused.  This makes it easy to manage, and  allows changes to be made in one place. We've identified common code in the  homepage and blog pages, and placed it into a common code element in our module.  The common JSP file we've created for the blog site contains these template sections:  Header: Contains the header HTML.  Search Form: Contains the search form.  Advertisements: Contains the advertisement inclusions.  Archives: Displays the blog archives.  RSS Client: Contains logic for the RSS client feeds.  RSS Feed: Contains links to the RSS feeds.  Footer: Contains the footer HTML.  Each includable JSP section is demarcated using the   tag. The  template code starts out with some declarations: .  <%-- This template contains common JSP code.  The element is divided into sections that can individually be included into a parent JSP via the OpenCms ‘include' API. --%>                <%@ page import="java.util.*,         org.opencms.file.*,        com.deepthoughts.templates.*" %>              <%@ taglib prefix="cms"        uri="http:  www.opencms.org taglib cms" %> <%        create the bean     BlogJspTemplate blog =         new BlogJspTemplate pageContext, request, response ; %>  [ 100 ]   Chapter 4  As in the homepage template, some java imports and the tag library are included.  After the declaration, an instance of the Java bean is created, as it will be needed  later, in the code sections. The code sections appear next.  Header Code The first section of the common template declares an element named header, which  is declared using the   tag:                <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"              align="center" border="0">                                                      &nbsp;&nbsp;           <script language="JavaScript"                     type="text javascript">document.write TODAY ;            &nbsp;                                                                                          <img height="1"                      alt="spacer.gif" width="1" border="0"                      src="  images spacer.gif "  >                                                   This section is used by all page templates, and contains common HTML in the  header. First, there is some JavaScript code used to write the current date. The  JavaScript is assumed to be included in the calling template.  [ 101 ]   Developing Templates  After the JavaScript code, there is a call to the getCurrentFolderName method of the  Java bean. This method returns nothing if the current folder is the most recent blog  folder. Otherwise, it returns the folder name. It is used to indicate that an archive  folder is being browsed against a current list of blogs. When a current blog list is  being browsed, the header area appears like this:  But when an archive has been selected for browsing, the header area is modified to  contain the archive name to provide additional context feedback:  As we want this feature on all the pages, it is encapsulated into the header logic.  Search Form Next in the template, is a section for the search form code:                     system modules                com.deepthoughts.templates elements Search.jsp                " method="post" id="searchform">                                                                           The action of the form is targeted towards the Search.jsp file which is located in  the elements folder of the module. We will cover this in a later chapter. So, searching  will not work yet, but the required framework will be in place.  Advertisements Recall that we created an element in the index.html named Ads. This element is  used to contain user-editable HTML for advertisements that can be put onto the  page. The ads section contains the code responsible for inserting the element onto  the page:  [ 102 ]   Chapter 4                                         <cms:include file=" index.html" element="Ads"                          editable="true"  >                   The feature is easily supported by using the   tag and referencing the  element name Ads. Content editors can then edit the content and the template takes  care of inserting it onto the page.  Blog Archives Archives of past blogs are accessed from the homepage and the blog pages on the  righthand panel. The panel contains a list sorted in descending order with a count of  entries for each month:  The archives code section takes care of generating the HTML for this:                    Archives                     <%               get the list of blog folders, in descending date order              List lstBlogs = blog.getBlogFolders  ;              Iterator i = lstBlogs.iterator  ;                 for each folder...              while  i.hasNext    {                 CmsResource res =  CmsResource  i.next  ;                    count blogs in it                 String strCount =                             Integer.toString blog.getBlogCount res  ;                    get the title  [ 103 ]   Developing Templates          String strTitle =                blog.getCmsObject  .readPropertyObject res,                CmsPropertyDefinition.PROPERTY_TITLE, false .getValue  ;                    build a uri parameter to it              String strLink = blog.getCmsObject  .getSitePath res ;                 link to the home page with a folder switch         String strI =               blog.link " index.html" .concat "?uri=" .concat strLink ;           %>            "                 href=" ">  &nbsp;                                                The code starts by retrieving a list of blog folders by calling the getBlogFolders  method on the Java bean. This returns blog folders in the descending order of date.  The code then iterates over the list, using the getBlogCount method to obtain the  number of blog entries in each folder. The Title property on each folder is used for  the displayed name.  Next, a link is constructed for each archive folder. Archives are displayed using the  same template as the homepage. To display the blogs in an archive folder, the code  just needs to know to retrieve blogs from a past archive folder rather than the one  with the most recent date. This is accomplished by using a parameter containing the  archive folder to be viewed. Whenever the homepage template code retrieves a list of  blogs, it looks for this parameter. Recall that the Java bean on the homepage template  makes a call to the getBlogsInFolder method. This is the method that takes the  parameter into account. So in this code, we need to ensure that the parameter   gets created.  The link for the homepage is  index.html. We just have to add the additional  parameter to this URL. The resulting link will look like this:  opencms opencms index.html?uri= Blogs 2007-06   When generating this URL, the link method is used with the path to the index file.  This ensures that the web application and servlet context are accounted for in   the URL.  [ 104 ]   RSS Client and RSS Feeds These sections will be developed in the later chapters. But for now, stub code is used  in their place. In the RSS client section, a dummy link placeholder is used:  Chapter 4                    Feeds                    Feed goes                                here   16:50                                      Subscribe                                             <a type="application rss+xml"                  rel="alternate"                  title="Subscribe to my feed"                  href=" RSS?type=RSS0.91">                  <img style="border: 0pt none ;"                  alt="RSS" src="  images xml.gif                       ">&nbsp;RSS 0.91 Feed                                                     <a type="application rss+xml"                  rel="alternate" title="Subscribe to my feed"                  href=" RSS?type=RSS1.0">                 <img style="border: 0pt none ;" alt="RSS"                        src="  images xml.gif  ">                      &nbsp;RSS 1.0 Feed                                                     <a type="application rss+xml"                  rel="alternate" title="Subscribe to my feed"                   href=" RSS?type=RSS2.0">                <img style="border: 0pt none ;"                  alt="RSS" src="  images xml.gif ">  [ 105 ]   Developing Templates                  &nbsp;RSS 2.0 Feed                                                     <a type="application rss+xml"                  rel="alternate" title="Subscribe to my feed"                  href=" RSS?type=atom">                <img style="border: 0pt none ;"                  alt="RSS" src="  images xml.gif ">                 &nbsp;ATOM 0.3 Feed                                              Likewise, for the RSS feed area, we use stub links. Anticipating that the RSS feeds  will support multiple formats, URL parameters have been used to specify a feed  type. Later, we will discuss developing RSS feeds for the site content.  Footer Section To complete the common template, there is an element used to include the footer  element from the index.html content:                 That completes the common element. We can see how placing the elements into the  common.jsp file makes it easier to make central changes that affect all the pages of  the site.  The Supporting Java Bean Class The bulk of the work done in the template is accomplished by a Java  bean. The BlogJspTemplate Java bean subclasses the OpenCms provided  CmsJspXmlContentBean class. The OpenCms class provides a Java analogue to the  features provided by the XML content tag library. This bean has been subclassed in  order to provide methods specific to our template, and also to override some of the  base bean behavior. The usage pattern for the bean is similar to that of the tag library  and its base class:  [ 106 ]          Load content from some VFS location into a collection. Iterate the content items in the collection. Display each content item with the ability to edit it using direct edit.  The beginning of the custom class file looks like this:  Chapter 4  public class BlogJspTemplate extends CmsJspXmlContentBean {        useful constant     protected final static String NULLSTR = "";        path to our blog respository, blogs are arranged by month and          year     protected final static String CONTENT_PATH = " Blogs ";        fieldnames in our blogentry content type     protected final static String FIELD_IMAGE = "Image";     protected final static String FIELD_ALIGNMENT = "Alignment";     protected final static String FIELD_TOPIC = "Category";        the resource type id for our BlogEntry resource     protected final static int BLOG_RESOURCE_TYPEID = 3000;        container for the currently loaded list of blogs     I_CmsXmlContentContainer m_iContent;      **      * Empty constructor, required for every JavaBean.      *         public BlogJspTemplate          {           super  ;        }      **      * Constructor, with parameters.      *       * @param context the JSP page context object      * @param req the JSP request       * @param res the JSP response       *      public BlogJspTemplate PageContext context, HttpServletRequest                                          req, HttpServletResponse res        {         super context, req, res ;     }  The file starts out declaring some useful constants that will be used later on,  including the location of the blog repository and the resource type id for the  BlogEntry data type. Constructors are provided to use the class either as a bean or  with parameters. The next method overrides the direct editing feature.  [ 107 ]   Developing Templates  As mentioned earlier, OpenCms provides direct editing support for in-site content  editing. The   tag is used for this and utilizes what is called a  direct edit provider. This is a Java class responsible for generating the HTML and  JavaScript code required for the edit button to appear in the Offline preview mode.  For our page templates however, the default direct edit provider causes alignment  problems. OpenCms allows for custom direct edit providers to be registered  and created, and also provides alternate direct edit providers that may be used.  Fortunately, one of the available alternatives does not cause the problem. The  alternate class is specified in our override of the editable method:  public void editable   throws JspException  {     CmsJspTagEditable.editableTagAction getJspContext  , "org.opencms.workplace.editors.directedit. CmsDirectEditTextButtonProvider", CmsDirectEditMode.AUTO, null ; }  Here, the method simply uses the tag library implementation, passing the name of  the alternate direct edit provider class. The alternate provider generates HTML that  works better in our template code.  Next in the bean, there is a method used to gather all the blogs together in a folder:  public I_CmsXmlContentContainer getBlogsInFolder   {     try {        String strPath = null;        String URI = getRequest  .getParameter "uri" ;        if  null == URI  {           strPath = getMostRecentBlogFolder  ;        }         else {           strPath = URI;        }           we retrieve everything in the folder with           the resource id of the BlogEntry type          m_iContent = contentloadManualEdit              "allInFolderDateReleasedDesc",              strPath.concat "" .              concat Integer.toString BLOG_RESOURCE_TYPEID   ;         } catch  JspException e  {            e.printStackTrace  ;         }    return m_iContent; }  [ 108 ]   Chapter 4  Aside from returning the list of current blogs, the method also supports the  requirement for browsing past blog archives. As discussed in the last chapter, to  make this easier to implement, the content has been arranged date wise into folders.  This is leveraged by the method. When the getBlogsInFolder method is called,  it looks for a parameter named uri. If the parameter is present, then a list of blogs  from the folder that uri refers to, is used. Otherwise, the list is obtained from the  current blog folder, which is the folder having the most recent date. Recall that in the  common template code, the uri parameter is generated in the archives section. The method makes use of two utility methods. The first one determines the most  current blog folder:  public String getMostRecentBlogFolder   {     String strLatestPath = CONTENT_PATH;        get the list of blog folders     List collectorResult = getBlogFolders  ;     if  null != collectorResult &&        collectorResult.iterator  .hasNext    {           the first one in the list is the most recent        CmsResource res =  CmsResource            collectorResult.iterator  .next  ;        strLatestPath = CONTENT_PATH + res.getName   + " ";      }     return strLatestPath; }  The utility method in turn relies on another method to get a list of all the blog folders  in the descending date order. It takes advantage of the list order to return only the  first item, which is always the most recent and hence, the current folder.  The second utility method is a JSP analogue to the   tag:  protected I_CmsXmlContentContainer contentloadManualEdit      String collectorName,     String collectorParam      throws JspException {     return new CmsJspTagContentLoad null,          getJspContext  , collectorName, collectorParam,          null, null, getRequestContext  .getLocale  ,          CmsDirectEditMode.MANUAL ;      }  [ 109 ]   Developing Templates  We override this method in order to set the editing mode to MANUAL. This is  necessary to ensure that the default direct edit buttons are overridden with our own.  The method utilizes the tag constructor directly. This utility method is also used by  the getBlog method:  public boolean getBlog String URI { try {         m_iContent = contentloadManualEdit "singleFile", URI ;         return true;     } catch  JspException e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;     }     return false;     }  This provides support for the BlogEntry.jsp template to retrieve the blog that was  clicked on from the home page.  Moving on, the getBlogFolders method provides a list of blog archive folders:  public List getBlogFolders   {        Use the collector to obtain a list of resources     String collectorName = "allInFolderDateReleasedDesc";     try {           now collect the resources        I_CmsResourceCollector collector =            OpenCms.getResourceManager  .            getContentCollector collectorName ;        if  null == collector  {         throw new CmsException Messages.get  .container          Messages.ERR_COLLECTOR_NOT_FOUND_1, collectorName  ;        }           get list of folders underneath the ‘ Blogs' folder        List collectorResult = collector.getResults            getCmsObject  , collectorName,            CONTENT_PATH + "" + Integer.toString            CmsResourceTypeFolder.RESOURCE_TYPE_ID  ;        return collectorResult;     } catch  CmsException e  {           e.printStackTrace  ;     }     return null; }  [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  To build the folder list, a resource collector is used. This is an OpenCms class that  returns a list of resources, given a filter pattern. Use of the class is well documented,  and more details can be found in the tag library online documentation. To get the  list of blog folders, the parameters specify that only folder resources located in the   Blogs path should be returned. The parameters also specify that the returned list is  to be ordered by date.   On both the homepage and the blog pages, optional support is available for  displaying an image. To simplify template coding , the Java class provides the  getBlogImage method for retrieving the image:  public String getBlogImage int Height  { if  fieldExists FIELD_IMAGE   {        CmsImageScaler scaler = new CmsImageScaler  ;        scaler.setHeight Height ;        HashMap  attributes = new HashMap<String,                 String>  ;        String strAlign = getField FIELD_ALIGNMENT ;        attributes.put "align", strAlign ;        attributes.put "height", Integer.toString Height  ;        return img getField FIELD_IMAGE , scaler, attributes ; } Return NULLSTR; }  As blog images are optional, it first checks to see if the image exists in the data field.  If an image is available, the CmsImageScaler class is utilized to size it properly. Only  the height parameter is used, as the scaler will automatically compute the width and  maintains the aspect ratio.  Finally in the Java class, there is a method that returns the list of topics assigned to  each blog:  public String showTopics   {    StringBuffer to hold the response StringBuffer sbCategories = new StringBuffer NULLSTR ;    get list of categories I_CmsXmlContentContainer iCategories = contentloop m_iContent,   FIELD_TOPIC ; boolean bFirst = true; try {        while  iCategories.hasMoreContent    {           if  false == bFirst  {                 after first on we can append a comma              sbCategories.append ",&nbsp;" ;  [ 111 ]   Developing Templates            } else {                 no longer the first one              bFirst = false;           }              add the category           sbCategories.append this.contentshow iCategories  ;        }     } catch  JspException e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;     }     return sbCategories.toString  ; }  The method calls contentloop to get a list of field values from the content item. The  contentloop method is implemented in the base class and is documented in the tag  library. The method loops over the content values and returns a String for display.  The Blog Template The second code template we need to write is for the BlogEntry.jsp file. This  template supports the display of individual blog entries. The template starts out with  declarations and imports, and looks a lot like the home page template:  <%@page session="true"         import="com.deepthoughts.templates.*"%> <%@taglib prefix="cms"         uri="http:  www.opencms.org taglib cms"%> <%        create the bean     BlogJspTemplate blog=new BlogJspTemplate          pageContext, request, response ;        get the blog entry that was clicked on     blog.getBlog blog.getCmsObject  .         getRequestContext  .getUri   ;        allow edit mode for offline previewing     blog.editable  ; t%>  The difference is that instead of getting a list of blogs, it gets just one blog by calling  getBlog. As we have already seen in the Java code, the getBlog method uses a  collector to locate a single file with a given URI. The remainder of the template   code is similar to the homepage template, including the calls to the common   code elements.  [ 112 ]   That completes the code for the two content templates. We can now use them to  view the blog content. To do this, we will need to first understand how templates are  applied and loaded for content items. The next section discusses how this is done.  Chapter 4  The Content and Template Loading  Process OpenCms uses Java classes called resource loaders for handling the delivery of  resources from the VFS. When a request is made for a resource, the OpenCms  servlet first locates it in the VFS. After ensuring that the user has access permissions,  the servlet determines the type of the requested resource. It then locates a suitable  resource loader for that type and passes control to the loader. The resource loader is  responsible for handling the details of how a resource is rendered and returned. The  following diagram illustrates this process:  Resource loaders are associated with resource types through unique resource ids,  and are registered with OpenCms in the opencms-vfs.xml configuration file. Inside  the configuration file, we can find the following resource loaders:               CmsDumpLoader: Loads plain text files. CmsImageLoader: Loads image resources. CmsPointerLoader: Loads pointers to other content or links. CmsJspLoader: Loads JSP files. CmsXmlPageLoader: Loads the xmlpage resource type. CmsXmlContentLoader: Loads XML structured resource types.  [ 113 ]   Developing Templates  The last two loaders are responsible for loading XML content types. When they  are called, rather than rendering the requested content themselves, they utilize a  template to do this. A property value on the original resource identifies the location  of the template. When control is passed to the template it uses the original URI to  load and render the originating resource, as illustrated here:  Although both XML loaders use templates to display their content, each loader uses  a different property value. The CmsXmlPageLoader uses the template property,  while the CmsXmlContentLoader uses the template-elements property. As for  all properties, the value may be set on a parent folder instead of each resource.  This allows a default template property to be set for a group of content, and to be  individually overridden, if so desired.   The only thing left to do is to set the appropriate property so the loader will invoke  our template. For the index.html file, we need to set the template value to point to  the full path of the template. As the template is in the module, the value should be  set to:    system modules com.deepthoughts.templates templates BlogHomepage.jsp  [ 114 ]   Chapter 4  For the blogs we need to set the template-elements property instead of the template  property. As just mentioned, instead of setting this property on each individual  blog entry we can just set it on the Blogs parent folder.  Any time later a special blog  template can be set to an individual blog by setting the value for that blog entry. On  the Blogs parent folder, the property should be set to:  system modules com.deepthoughts.templates templates BlogEntry.jsp After setting the property values, we can view the content through the templates by  clicking on the index.html file in the Explorer View. Remember to switch back to  the default site in the Workplace Explorer before doing this.  Expressions in JSP Templates The code we've covered shows how to use custom beans in templates. For many  sites however, this is not necessary, as the base tag library can be combined with  expressions to achieve many things that don't require custom beans. Support for  the use of expressions has been present in OpenCms for a while. However, since  the release of 7.0.2, it has become possible to combine these with the JSP tag library.  This is a powerful feature that provides access to the XML tag libraries and is an  alternative to sub classing.  Using the Tag Library from JSP Support for using expressions to access the tag library has been added via the   org.opencms.jsp.CmsJspVfsAccessBean class. This class provides expression  access to the tag library from JSP code. To use it, the JSP may just access the methods  using expression syntax:     <%@taglib prefix="cms"     uri="http:  www.opencms.org taglib cms" %>      Context Path: ${pageContext.request.contextPath}      URI: ${cms:vfs pageContext .requestContext.uri}          ${cms:vfs pageContext .property[cms:vfs pageContext .      requestContext.uri]["Title"]}          <cms:contentload collector="allInFolderDateReleasedDesc"      param=" Blogs 2007-07 *.htmlblogentry3" editable="true">                       [ 115 ]   Developing Templates         ${cms:vfs pageContext .property[blog.filename]["Title"]}                             ${cms:vfs pageContext .readXml[blog.filename].        value[‘BlogText']}           Note the inclusion of the tag library using the cms prefix. The same namespace prefix  is used in the expressions to access the API. Here are some examples that we see in  the previous code:           ${cms:vfs pagecontext .requestContext.uri}: Returns the URI of the  item that was clicked on, causing control to pass to the template. ${cms:vfs pageContext .property[filename][propertyname]: Returns  the given property on the given filename. In the previous code, it is combined  with the requested URI to obtain the Title property. ${cms:vfs pageContext .readXml[filename].value[element]: Returns  the value of the element within the XML content of the specified filename.   In the example, it is used to obtain the BlogText field of the currently   iterated blog.  Documentation for all the methods that are available can be found by looking at the  org.opencms.jsp.CmsJspVfsAccessBean class.  Combining Expressions with JSTL It is easy to add JSTL support to JSP by including the necessary tag libraries. Of  course, the relevant .jar files will need to be added to the web project as well. It then  becomes easy to add the tag library code to do things like date formatting:     <%@taglib prefix="cms"     uri="http:  www.opencms.org taglib cms" %>  <%@ taglib prefix="fmt"     uri="http:  java.sun.com jsp jstl fmt" %> <%@ taglib prefix="c"     uri="http:  java.sun.com jsp jstl core" %>        Context Path: <c:out                 value="${pageContext.request.contextPath}"  >      URI: ${cms:vfs pageContext .requestContext.uri}               ${cms:vfs pageContext .property[cms:vfs pageContext .  [ 116 ]   Chapter 4         requestContext.uri]["Title"]}          <cms:contentload collector="allInFolderDateReleasedDesc"      param=" Blogs 2007-07 *.htmlblogentry3" editable="true">                             ${cms:vfs pageContext .property[blog.filename]["Title"]}                             <fmt:formatDate               value="${cms:convertDate blog.file.dateCreated }"              type="date" dateStyle="LONG" >                    ${cms:vfs pageContext .readXml[blog.filename].               value[‘BlogText']}           In the previous example the   tag is used to convert the blog  created date to a human readable format. The Date object required by the tag is  obtained using the blog.file.dateCreated expression.   The template example uses the 1.2 version of the JSTL tag library, rather  than the 1.1 version. This is because the 1.2 version accepts the use of  expressions while version 1.1 does not.  Accelerating Template Development  Using WebDAV We've previously gone over how to setup a development environment for building  OpenCms. With the introduction of WebDAV support in Version 7, an IDE such as  Eclipse can be used to create and edit templates and other module resources. Let's go  over the steps necessary to do this.  [ 117 ]   Developing Templates  Install the Eclipse WebDAV Plug-in The WebDAV plug‑in must first be installed into Eclipse. This is done through  the Eclipse update manager by selecting Help -> Software Updates -> Find and  Install…. When the dialog appears, select the option, Search for new features   to install:  After pressing Next, check off the site named The Eclipse Project Updates and   press Finish:  [ 118 ]   Chapter 4  Next, select a nearby mirror site and press OK. In the next dialog box, the feature for  FTP and WebDAV support will appear in the list, and should be checked. Pressing  the Next button and agreeing to the terms will install the feature. If the feature does not appear, then it probably means that a newer version of Eclipse  is being used. Since the WebDAV plug-in is no longer in active development, it is not  included in the feature update list, and will thus have to be added manually. In this  case, click the Cancel button and repeat the process. But at the Update sites to visit  dialog box, select the New Remote Site… button, and enter the following:  The URL contains the update site for the location of the feature we need. After  adding the site, selecting it, and choosing another mirror location, several items will  appear in the list. Only the FTP and WebDAV items are needed.  After installing the feature, Eclipse will need to be restarted.  [ 119 ]   Developing Templates  Create a Site Within Eclipse for the Server The next step is to add the WebDAV location representing the OpenCms site into  Eclipse. The location is added through the Site Explorer view, which can be added  to the default Java perspective. Select Window -> Show View -> Other to locate the  view, and expand the Target Management node:  Selecting the Site Explorer item will add the view to Eclipse:   [ 120 ]   Right-click in the previous window and select New -> Target Site to add the  location. Since we want to access the repository via WebDav, select that option and  click Next. In the next dialog box, the URL and credentials for the site can be entered.   Chapter 4  The server must first be running before we can enter the URL and the  credentials information.  The Server URL uses the webdav servlet rather than the opencms servlet.  The user credentials can be of any user for whom an OpenCms login  account has been created.  [ 121 ]   Developing Templates  Import Content into the Project Once the plug-in has been installed and the site has been added, the last thing to do  is to import the content from the VFS into our project. This is done by selecting the  folder in the project where the content should go, and right-clicking on it. Select the  Import option and in the dialog box expand the Other node. Select the WebDAV  option and press Next to specify where the files should be imported into the project.  After pressing Next again, the site we have just added will appear:  Press Next again, and a list of resources at that location will appear. The list can be  navigated to locate the resources we want to mirror into our project. For templates,  we may want to locate the resources located in our module:    system modules com.deepthoughts.templates  [ 122 ]   Select that node, and press Next. We can then select the resources to be imported into  our project:  Chapter 4  [ 123 ]   Developing Templates  The selected files will then be copied into the local project directory for editing.  We then will be able to edit the JSP files in Eclipse. Any local changes made can be  synchronized with the VFS repository at any time, using the Synchronize view. This  view can be added the same way the Site Explorer view was added, but appears  under the Team node. After adding this view, it will track any changes made to the  files that were imported.  The view contains buttons for uploading any changes to the VFS and for  downloading any VFS changes to the local project. Using this feature can speeden  up the development time for a JSP template, as the IDE can be used to make changes  which are then quickly synchronized with the VFS for viewing.  Summary In this chapter, we started with a review of the template code for the Deep Thoughts  site. We then showed how to create templates that utilize a custom Java class, which  subclasses a base OpenCms class. The custom class we created shows how to change  some of the default template behavior. It also shows how to provide added features  or logic, which is specific to the template requirements. We also discussed resource  loaders and the template loading mechanism.  The chapter also included a section on  using expressions in JSP and how they can be utilized in many cases to avoid custom  bean development. We finished up by showing how to utilize the WebDAV feature  in OpenCms to accelerate template development.  [ 124 ]   Adding Site Search  In this chapter, we will add search capabilities to our site. We will start with a  discussion of the Lucene search engine, and will then discuss how to create a search  index for our blog content. After that, we will go over some advanced search engine  configurations and introduce a useful Lucene development tool. We will then   discuss the code to use the index and provide site search support. Let's first take a  look at Lucene.  A Quick Overview of Lucene Included with OpenCms is a distribution of the Lucene search engine. Lucene is an  open source, high-performance text search engine that is both easy to use and full- featured. Lucene is not a product. It is a Java library providing data indexing, and  search and retrieval support. OpenCms integrates with Lucene to provide these  features for its VFS content.  Though Lucene is simple to use, it is highly flexible and has many options. We will  not go into the full details of all the options here, but will provide a basic overview,  which will help us in developing our search code. A full understanding of Lucene  is not required for completing this chapter, but interested readers can find more  information at the Lucene website: http:  jakarta.apache.org lucene. There are  also several excellent books available, which can easily be found with a web search.  Search Indexes For any data to be searched, it must first be indexed. Lucene supports both disk and  memory based indexes, but OpenCms uses the more suitable disk based indexes.  There are three basic concepts to understand regarding Lucene search indexes:  Documents, Analyzers, and Fields.   Adding Site Search           Document: A document is a collection of Lucene fields. A search index is  made up of documents. Although each document is built from some actual  source content, there is no need for the document to exactly resemble it. The  fields stored in the document are indexed and stored and used to locate   the document. Analyzer: An analyzer is responsible for breaking down source content into  words  or terms  for indexing. An analyzer may take a very simple approach  of only parsing content at whitespace breaks or a more complex approach  by removing common words, identifying email and web addresses, and  understanding abbreviations or other languages. Though Lucene provides  many optional analyzers, the default one used by OpenCms is usually the  best choice. For more advanced search applications, the other analyzers  should be looked at in more depth.  Field: A field consists of data that can be stored, indexed, or queried. Field  values are searched when a query is made to the index. There are two  characteristics of a field that determine how it gets treated when indexed:        Field Storage: The storage characteristic of a field determines  whether or not the field data value gets stored into the  index. It is not necessary to store field data if the value is  unimportant and is used only to help locate a document. On  the other hand, field data should be stored if the value needs  to be returned with the search result. Field Indexing: This characteristic determines whether a  field will get indexed, and if so, how. There is no need to  index fields that will not be used as search terms, and the  value should not be indexed. This is useful if we need to  return a field value but will never search for the document  using that field in a search term. However, for fields that are  searchable, the field may be indexed in either a tokenized or  an un‑tokenized fashion. If a field is tokenized, then it will  first be run through an analyzer. Each term generated by the  analyzer will be indexed for the field. If it is un‑tokenized,  then the field's value is indexed, verbatim. In this case, the  term must be searched for using an exact match of its value,  including the case. The two field types may be combined to form four combinations.  While choosing a field type, consideration should thus be given to  how the item will need to be located, as well as what data will need  to be returned from the index.   [ 126 ]   Chapter 5  Lucene also provides the ability to define a boost value for a field. This affects the  relevance of the field when it is used in a search. A value other than the default value  of 1.0 may be used to raise or lower the relevance.    These are the important concepts to be understood while creating a Lucene search  index. After an index has been created, documents may be searched through queries.  Search Queries Querying Lucene search indexes is supported through a Java API and a search  querying language. Search queries are made up of terms and operators. A term can  be a simple word such as "hello" or a phrase such as "hello world". Operators are  used to form logical expressions with terms, such as AND or NOT. With the Java  API, terms can be built and aggregated together along with operators to form a  query. When using the query language, a Java class is provided to parse the query  and convert it into a format suitable for passing to the engine. In addition to these  search features, there are more advanced operations that may be performed such as  fuzzy searches, range searches, and proximity searches.  All these options and flexibility allow Lucene to be used in an application in many  ways. OpenCms does a good job of using these options to provide search capabilities  for a wide range of content types. Next, we will look at how OpenCms interfaces  with Lucene to provide this support.  Configuring OpenCms Search OpenCms maintains search settings in the opencms-search.xml configuration file  located in the WEB-INF config directory. Prior to OpenCms 7, most of the settings  in this configuration file needed to be made by hand. With OpenCms 7, the Search  Management tool in the Administration View has been improved to cover most of  the settings. We will first go over the settings that are controlled through the Search  Management view, and will then visit the settings that must still be changed by  hand. The first thing we'll do is define our own search index for the blog content.  [ 127 ]   Adding Site Search  Creating a new search index is simple with the Administration tool. We access it  by clicking on the Search Management icon of the Administrative View, and then  clicking on the New Index icon:  The Name field contains the name of the index file. This is the actual name that  will be passed along to the Java API, as we will see later on. As the content differs  between the online and offline areas, we will create an index for each one. For now,  we will start with the offline index. We'll name it: Blogs – Offline. The other   fields are:             Rebuild mode: This determines if the index is to be built manually or  automatically as content changes. We want automatic updating and will  hence choose auto. Locale: We must select a locale for the content. OpenCms will extract the  content for the given locale when it builds our index. If we were supporting  more than one locale, then it would be a good idea to include the locale in the  index name. Project: This selects content from either the Online or Offline project. Field configuration: This selects a field configuration to be used for   the index.  We do not have our own field configuration yet; so for now press OK to save the  index. Next, we will define a field configuration for the blog content.  Field Configurations Once the index has been created, we may define the fields we want it to contain by  creating a field configuration. The View field configuration icon shows existing   field configurations and allows creation of new ones. The fields in the configuration  relate to the fields that will get created in the search index. Each field has the  following settings:  [ 128 ]                                Chapter 5  Name: The name of the field. Index: True to index the field, untokenized to index the field without  running it through an analyzer, and false to not index the field. Store: Checked to have the value of the field stored. Excerpt: This is an OpenCms setting, which will truncate the field value  before storing it. This allows a search to present a synopsis view of the  results, without having to actually retrieve the content from the original  resource. While the UI allows this option to be selected and disallows the  Store option, this combination does not make much sense. Display: This is the display name used for the field. Boost: This is an optional value that can be provided to adjust the boost. Default: This is a default value that may be provided for a field value, in case  the source field value does not exist.  In addition to these settings, each field also contains one or more mapping  definitions which map the data value to a content field in a VFS resource. The  mapping definition includes a mapping type, an optional parameter, and an optional  default value. There are four types of mappings to choose from:  content: This maps the field data value to the value of the VFS resource  content. The value that is retrieved is based upon the resource type. Each  resource type has a content extractor responsible for converting the resource  content into a string value. For XML resource types, the content extractor  concatenates all the data fields of the resource into a single string value. For  this mapping, the Parameter field is not used. property: This maps the field data value to a VFS resource property value. If  the property value is not found, then the value will be empty. The Parameter  field must contain the name of the property value to be used. property-search: This is the same as the property mapping except when the  property value is missing on the original resource. It then searches for the  value on all the parent folders of the resource. The Parameter field must  contain the name of the property value to be used. item: This selection is useful only for XML content. It maps the value to  an individual field in the XML content. The XML field is specified in the  Parameter field using the XPath notation format. For example, for an  XML field element with the name of Abstract, the notation used would be  Abstract[1]. For a repeating element, multiple mappings may be added  per field. For example, for the blog comments, we could map the first three  comments using three mappings entries with the values: Comment[1],  Comment[2], and Comment[3].  [ 129 ]   Adding Site Search  OpenCms provides a general purpose default field configuration named standard.  It defines fields that are generally suitable for indexing any OpenCms VFS resource.  The standard configuration is defined as follows:                   Content: This field is both indexed and stored and contains the extracted  text of a VFS resource. The actual extracted text contained in this field  depends upon the resource type. For a Word or text document for example,  the Content field will contain all the text contained within the resource. For  OpenCms XML content, all the data fields in the resource are concatenated  into this field as a single value. This has a nice effect of allowing all data  fields of the XML content to be searched, using just this field, such as  "content: 90124". However, querying XML content fields using operators,  such as "address:main street" NOT "zip: 90124", is not possible. Description: This field is stored and indexed and contains the description of  the resource obtained via the description property.  Keywords: This field is stored and indexed, and contains the keywords of the  resource obtained via the keywords property. Meta: This field is not stored, but is indexed. It indexes the value of the three  content properties: Title, Keywords, and Description. Title: This field contains the title field value, and is indexed but not stored. Title-key: This contains the title field value, and is stored as it is, or  untokenized by an analyzer.  We could use the standard field configuration for our search index. But we will  design our own instead. This is simple to do and will provide us with more flexibility  in the future, if necessary.  Creating a Field Configuration Field configurations are created from within the Search Management view by first  clicking on the View field configurations icon, and then clicking on the New field  configuration icon:  [ 130 ]   After saving the entry and returning to the list of field configurations, click on the  field configuration to get to the overview screen:  Chapter 5  From here fields may be added. Our search index will contain four fields:               blogtext: This field contains our blog text. Unlike the content field in the  standard mapping, this field contains only the blog text, and none of the  other XML field data. The field is indexed so that we can search for text in it.  We will also store the field value, but in an excerpted format, so that we can  quickly display a synopsis of the blog in the search result.  category: This field contains the data from the category fields of our content.  We create a separate search field so that we can provide the ability to search  on category alone. If the category value were to be included within the  content field as is the case with the standard field mapping, then we would  have no assurance that a search for a category term would find matching text  in the blog text. title: This field contains the indexed value of the title field. The field is  indexed to allow it to be searched on. As indexed fields are analyzed, we can  choose not to store the resulting value in the data field. title-key: This field is the inverse of the title field. It is not indexed, but is  instead stored verbatim in the field to allow the field to be sorted properly in  the search result.  [ 131 ]   Adding Site Search  After adding these fields the display should look like this:  Now we'll add the field mappings by clicking on the name column of the field, and  using the Add new mapping action. Add the following mappings:              blogtext: This field is mapped to the BlogText field and the type is item. The  parameter field contains the XML field name for the blog content, which is  BlogText[1]. category: This field maps to the blog Category field and the type is item. The  category field of our Blog XML content can have more than one value. We  will therefore need to have multiple mappings for this field. Unfortunately,  this is a problem because we don't know how many category fields there  are going to be. For now, we will support searching for only the first five  category field values. For this, we add five mappings of the type item. The  parameter values of each item should reflect the corresponding XML field  names. For example: Category[1], Category[2], Category[3], Category[4],   and Category[5]. title: This field is mapped to a content property and is of the type property.  The parameter field contains the name of the property, which is Title. title-key: This field is the same as the title field and should match its settings.   We can now go back to our index and apply this field configuration to it. Before we  do that however, we will do one more thing, create an index source.  [ 132 ]   Creating an Index Source An index source defines the locations of content within the VFS that are to be  indexed. The first step in doing this is to click on the View index sources icon:  Chapter 5  From here, we see that OpenCms has provided two search indexes already:        source1: This source includes all document types contained in the default  site, which is located under  sites default. source2: This source includes only the content located under  system  workplace locales , which is used to build the online help system.  Neither of these is suitable for our use as it includes content outside of the Blog  content repository. Let's add a new source for the blog content, by clicking on the  New index source icon and naming it BlogContent:  [ 133 ]   Adding Site Search  The indexer field contains the name of a Java class file that implements the   I_CmsIndexer interface. This class interfaces with Lucene and is responsible for  managing the search index. For most cases, the default provided class is sufficient.  However, if more complex content indexing requirements are needed, the flexibility  of OpenCms allows a custom indexing interface to be used. We can use the default  provided class for the blog content. Click OK to save the index, and then use the  Assign resources action to assign the blog repository path:  We've now defined the new source only to contain the resources within the Blog  repository. Next, we need to define the types of documents that we want to include  in the index source.   When the content is indexed, OpenCms iterates over the resources it finds in the  given VFS path. Each resource type has a corresponding document type class  responsible for converting the given resource into a Lucene document for indexing.  OpenCms provides document type classes for all the default resource types. Since  Blog content is XML, we will use the document type already available for XML  content types. The document type class is org.opencms.search.documents. CmsDocumentXmlContent. No other document types are needed for the blog content  source. To add the document type class, click on the plus icon of the Document types  available in the Assign document types area:  [ 134 ]   Chapter 5  After adding the document type, return to the Search Management screen where we  will continue with the final step.  Now we can finally complete the search index. Go back to the Search Management  screen and click on the Edit icon to set the field configuration. Select blogcontent  for the Field configuration setting and save it. Then use the Assign index sources  icon to remove the source1 source from the list and add the BlogContent source to  complete the index definition.  That completes the creation of the Offline index, and we can build the index by  clicking on the rebuild icon. We will also want to create an index for the Online  project. The index should be named Blogs – Online and will be left as a   reader exercise.  [ 135 ]   Adding Site Search  Additional Search Settings There are a few additional search index settings which are not accessible via the  Search Management interface. In most cases, it is not necessary to change these  settings. But it is still useful to understand them. The additional settings may only  be changed by editing the opencms-search.xml configuration file manually. Within  this file are the following settings:                          directory: This setting controls the directory location of the index files. It  is relative to the WEB-INF path of the OpenCms application. Each defined  search index will have a subdirectory appearing under this location which  matches the index name. timeout: During indexing, a thread is created for each resource to convert  it into a Lucene document. This value specifies the amount of time, in  milliseconds, that the indexer will wait for the thread to complete its task. forceunlock: This setting controls how indexing threads access the search  index. The possible values are:          always: Always attempts to unlock the index. never: Never unlocks the index; instead, waits for it to  become unlocked. onlyfull  default : This setting behaves the same as always,  and attempts to unlock the index, if it is locked.  excerpt: This setting controls the size that the value of a field will be  truncated to, if the excerpt setting in the field configuration is set to true. extractCacheMaxAge: When a resource is indexed, the document class  responsible for converting it into a Lucene document must convert the  content into plain text. As this is often time consuming, OpenCms caches  the resulting extracted text on disk. This setting controls the lifetime of the  extraction cache. For development purposes, if rebuilding indexes is done  frequently, then it may be helpful to set this to a low value, so that the index  is rebuilt with recent document content. highlighter: This specifies a class file that is used to provide support for  highlighting the search terms found in the search result. documenttype: This is where the various Document type classes are  configured. Each document type must specify a single resource type and can  have one or more mime-types associated with it. analyzer: This setting defines the analyzer that is used when the text is  indexed. The setting allows specification of a single analyzer per locale.  [ 136 ]   Chapter 5  As with all OpenCms configuration file settings, making a change will require a  server restart. It should also be noted that even though settings changed via the  Search Administration view will appear immediately, they also will often require a  server restart before taking effect.  Introducing Luke – a Visual Index Tool We finally have a search index suitable for searching the Blog content. Before we  write any search code, we can use a developer tool to browse the index and perform  queries. This will let us test some queries before writing any code. There is a great  open-source developer tool for Lucene called Luke. Unfortunately, there is not  much documentation on how to use it. But for simple tasks, it is straightforward  to use. Luke is available for downloading at http:  www.getopt.org luke. After  downloading and extracting the jar file, it can be started using:   > java –jar lukeall-0.7.1.jar  After starting up Luke, the first thing to do is to open the search index. It is located in  the following location:   \WEB-INF\index\Blogs - Offline  After opening the index it should look something like this:  [ 137 ]   Adding Site Search  The Overview tab is opened by default and shows the available fields in the index  on the left side. Notice that the field list includes the fields defined in the field  configuration as well as a few others, such as created, lastmodified, and type. The  additional fields are added by OpenCms to help locate the resource. On the right  hand side is a list of top ranking terms that have been indexed from the content.  Clicking on the Documents tab will show a list of the documents that are contained  in the index. Recall that each document corresponds to an instance of a resource in  the VFS. The arrow keys in the upper left are used to browse through the documents  in the index. We can see the fields of each document, along with some flags  indicating field status, and the field values:  The relevant field status flags are:         I: This field is indexed T: This field has been tokenized  run through an analyzer  S: The field value is stored  The field value is stored  [ 138 ]   Chapter 5  The additional flags are for more advanced Lucene features not utilized by  OpenCms. Notice that there are two category fields in the document. The first one corresponds  to the category field we defined in the blogfields field configuration. It contains  the collated values from the Category field within the content. But where did the  second one come from? As mentioned earlier, OpenCms adds additional index  fields to support locating the resource, and category is one of the fields added.  OpenCms attempts to obtain the value of this field from the category property.  However, this field appears to be a relic, as the category field is not a default content  property. Furthermore, OpenCms 7 provides a new Category management feature  for resources. For now, we will ignore the extra field but will keep it in mind, in case  additional support is provided in the future.  Now let's try a sample query by clicking on the Search tab:  [ 139 ]   Adding Site Search  On the left side, a search expression can be entered. Before we do this, we want to  make sure that we have selected the correct analyzer for parsing our query. Recall  that when field values are indexed, they get analyzed first. Any queries made in  Luke will get parsed with the same analyzer. We can observe the difference that  analyzers make with the following experiment.   1.  Enter the query: It rains in Paris in the spring 2.  Select the Whitespace analyzer: org.apache.lucene.analysis.  WhitespaceAnalyzer  3.  Press the Update button 4.  Note the parsed result: blogtext:It blogtext:rains blogtext:in blogtext:Paris   blogtext:in blogtext:the blogtext:spring  5.  Now repeat these steps using the standard analyzer: org.apache.lucene.  analysis.StandardAnalyzer  6.  Note the parsed result: blogtext:rains blogtext:paris blogtext:spring  Notice how the first analyzer simply parses the terms on whitespace boundaries  while the second one filters out common terms like 'it', 'in', and 'the'. This is the  effect that the analyzer has on indexed text. It is worth spending some additional  time looking at the Lucene documentation to understand the query syntax and  performing some additional search queries. Also note that Luke can be used to open  any Lucene search index. If there is not a lot of content in the Blog repository then  the Offline index can always be used for experimentation.  Writing the Search Code Now that we understand Lucene, have created a search index, and have tested a few  queries, we are ready to write the search code. As always when writing our code, we  want to leverage the existing OpenCms code as much as possible. OpenCms provides  the CmsSearch Java class to provide searching support. It is suitable for use as a Bean  on a JSP page, and can be driven off  the parameters passed to it via an HTML form.  We'll start out with a simple example showing how to use the search bean directly,  and then we'll progress to subclassing the bean for our own needs.  A Simple Search Example To implement a search, we only need to create two JSP files: SearchForm.html and  Results.html. These files could be combined together into one, and often are. But  to make the example easy to follow, we will use two separate files. The two files  should be of JSP type, and should be placed into the site root. Let's take a look at the  SearchForm.html JSP:  [ 140 ]   Chapter 5                                                   Search Form               <input name="query" type="text" value="Search..."                       onfocus="this.value=''" title="Search"  >              <input class="searchsubmit" type="submit" value="Go"                       title="Go"  >              <input type="hidden" name="index" value="Offline project                        VFS " >                                     The JSP file contains a simple FORM containing field values used for the search. The  action will be posted to the Results.html file. Note that the form contains the  following fields:       query: This contains the search query. index: This contains the name of the search index to be used.  These field values will be passed to the second JSP file, which uses the CmsSearch  bean to do the bulk of the work. The search bean is easy to use and has the following  general usage pattern:  Instantiate the bean  1.  2.  Set the bean's field values with the search parameters 3.  Call the init method 4.  Call the getSearchResult method to obtain the search results  Let's take a look at how the bean is used in the Results.html file. The first step is the  usual imports and the creation of the familiar JSP action element object:            <%       Create a JSP action element     CmsJspActionElement cms = new CmsJspActionElement pageContext,                                                    request, response ; %>  [ 141 ]   Adding Site Search  The next step is the declaration of the search bean. This is declared using the  standard jsp:useBean tag:  <jsp:useBean id="search" scope="request"                class="org.opencms.search.CmsSearch">              >  There are two things to notice in the bean declaration. First, the jsp:setProperty  tag is used to ensure that all available properties of the bean are set. Since this file  is accessed from an HTTP POST, any existing variable that matches a field in the  CmsSearch bean fields will be set. This means the bean fields may be set by just  declaring the fields in the form. In our minimal example, we have set only two   fields, which are sufficient for obtaining simple search results. The additional fields  that may be used can be found by examining the source code comments in the  CmsSearch bean.  The second thing to note is the call to the init method, which must be done before  the bean can be used. The next step in the file is the display of the search results:    Search Again       Search Results  <%     List result = search.getSearchResult  ;     if  result == null       {       if  search.getLastException   != null         {       %> Error:   <%       }  Calling the getSearchResult method returns the search results as a list in  CmsSearchResultList type. If an error has occurred, then the exception is reported  using the getLastException method. Otherwise, the search results are displayed by  iterating over the list and displaying the returned results:      }else      {        %>           Results found for query &lt;<%=           search.getQuery   %>&gt; in fields:                    <%             ListIterator iterator = result.listIterator  ;  [ 142 ]   Chapter 5              int i = 0;             while  iterator.hasNext    {                 i++;                 CmsSearchResult entry =                           CmsSearchResult iterator.next  ;        %>           .&nbsp; "><%=               entry.getTitle   %> &nbsp;  %                          Keywords:                  Excerpt:                  Description:                  Last modified:                                     This search code can be used in many cases for simple search operations and  illustrates how easy it is to support content searching.  Subclassing the CmsSearch Bean Next, we will make a more complex use of the search bean to support blog searching.  We could use form variables to drive the behavior of the base CmsSearch bean class.  Instead, we will show how to subclass the CmsSearch bean to perform more custom  search operations. We will do this by creating a class file named BlogSearch. It starts  out with the usual imports and some constant declarations:  package com.deepthoughts.search; import java.util.Arrays; import org.opencms.file.CmsObject; import org.opencms.search.CmsSearch; import org.opencms.search.CmsSearchParameters;  **  * This bean overrides the base CmsSearch implementation to provide  search support for  * Blog Content.  *  public class BlogSearch extends CmsSearch {      ** Constant for the fields we will search *      static final String[] DOC_QRY_FIELDS = new String[] {"blogtext",                                                   "category", "title"};      ** The names of our search index files *      static final String OFFLINE_INDEX = "Blogs - Offline";     static final String ONLINE_INDEX = "Blogs - Online";  [ 143 ]   Adding Site Search  Recall that the blog search form is very simple, and provides only a single field for  searching. As users should not need to know how to form a search query, we will  build it for them. In the query, we need to specify which fields we want to search  the given term for. For the blog site, we support searching the title, blogtext, and  category fields. Our class file has a constant for this list of fields. We also define a set  of constants that contain the names of the two search indexes that are used.  Next in the class is the constructor:       **      * Empty constructor for bean usage. We override the base class          and initialize with parameters      * needed for Blog searching.       *      public BlogSearch   {        super  ;        m_parameters.setSort CmsSearchParameters.SORT_DEFAULT ;        m_parameters.setFields Arrays.asList                                      BlogSearch.DOC_QRY_FIELDS  ;        m_parameters.setIndex OFFLINE_INDEX ;        m_parameters.setMatchesPerPage 4 ; }  Here is where all the parameters necessary for search are provided. The parameters  are passed within a CmsSearchParameters class. To see how the initial parameter  values are set, the base class should be consulted. In our class, we let the base  class set its initial parameters and then we add or overwrite our own values. The  first parameter specifies how the results will be sorted. We use the default sorting  method, which orders by document scoring.   The next field contains the list of fields that we want to search for. Here, we pass our  pre‑defined array of search fields.  Next, we specify the name of the search index to be used. We use the Offline index  by default in the constructor. The index will be changed later, if specified, when the  init method is called.   Finally, we set the number of results to display per page. For development, we set  this to a low number so that we can test without requiring many content results.  Later, this value should be changed to a more reasonable number or removed to  accept the default.       **     * Override the init method in order to set the proper search       * index. We automatically select     * the proper index based on the current project in use.     *   [ 144 ]   Chapter 5      public void init CmsObject cms  {        super.init cms ;            set search index to offline or online based on current             user project         if            cms.getRequestContext  .currentProject  .isOnlineProject              {           m_parameters.setIndex ONLINE_INDEX ;         } else {           m_parameters.setIndex OFFLINE_INDEX ;          }     } }  In the init method, the only thing needed is to ensure that the correct index is  selected. We cannot do this in the constructor because we do not have access to the  CmsObject, which is used to determine if the Offline or Online project is active.  That does it for our custom search bean! The bean shows how easy it is to create a  custom bean that encapsulates special search rules. It is not covered here, but it is  suggested that the reader inspect the CmsSearch class to understand how it operates.  Next, we will take a look at the JSP code that uses the bean.  The Search.jsp Template The search results are displayed from a JSP file that is specified as the target of the  search. Recall from the last chapter that the common.jsp file generated a form with  an action target of  system modules com.deepthoughts.templates elements Search. jsp. This file will use our bean to perform the search and display the results. It starts  out like our other JSP files:                    <%        create the bean     BlogJspTemplate blog = new BlogJspTemplate pageContext, request,                                                              response ; %>  [ 145 ]   Adding Site Search  <jsp:useBean id="search" scope="request"                class="com.deepthoughts.search.BlogSearch">           <%           search.init blog.getCmsObject   ;     %>    Following the usual JSP declarations and imports, we instantiate an instance of the  BlogJspTemplate class. This class is used only to access the CmsObject needed by  the init method of the search bean. Next is the instantiation of the search bean.  This is similar to the simple example, using the * value to instruct the bean to collect  and set all available property values. One of the important field values that the  CmsSearch bean looks for is the search query value. This value is passed in a variable  named query, which we have set as the form field name in our search form.  After calling the init method with the CmsObject, there is some more code for  initializing the search result:  <%    int resultno = 1;    int pageno = 0;    if  request.getParameter "searchPage" !=null  {       pageno = Integer.parseInt request.getParameter "searchPage"  -1;    }    int resultno = resultno =  pageno*search.getMatchesPerPage   +1;    String fields = search.getFields  ;    List result = search.getSearchResult  ; %>     The pageno variable contains the current page number in support of pagination. If  not on the first page of the result, the searchPage query variable will contain the  page number that should be shown. Later, in the JSP code, this will be used.  The resultno variable contains the index number of each result, as it is iterated.  When calculating the value, the current page number is taken into consideration so  that the display accurately shows which search hit is shown.  The list of search fields is obtained by using the getFields method. This is done to  propagate the fields when pagination is supported. We'll discuss more of this later.  Finally a call is made to the getSearchResult method to get the results. This  method takes into account any other form field variables which were passed. The  result is returned in a list of CmsSearchResult items. The next part of the template  looks a lot like the other templates from Chapter 4 in order to make the search results  page look consistent:  [ 146 ]   Chapter 5  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">                 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text html; charset=utf-                                                                  8"  >    <link rel="stylesheet"       href="  styles global.css " type="text css"  >     <script language="JavaScript"               src="  script today.js ">                          <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center"              width="100%">                                                        <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"                     element="left_rail"  >                                                             <img                 src="  images spacer.gif "                alt="" height="1" border="0"  >&nbsp;               <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"                       width="100%">  The next interesting code portion is where the results of the search are displayed.  Each result is iterated and formatted like the rest of the site. The getQuery method  is used to indicate what was searched for. Also displayed is the total number of hits,  obtained via the getSearchResultCount method. After that, we display each search  item, with its location in the result list and other details of our search.     <% if  result != null  {        ListIterator iterator = result.listIterator  ;     %>  [ 147 ]   Adding Site Search                           Search For:   found              items                              &nbsp;            <%        while  iterator.hasNext    {            CmsSearchResult entry =               CmsSearchResult iterator.next  ;     %>                                                      -                     <a href="<%=                       blog.link blog.getRequestContext  .                         removeSiteRoot entry.getPath     %>">                            <%=                           entry.getScore   %> %                                                                                                                                          <%            resultno++;         }           %>                           images spacer.gif "               alt="" width="680" height="1" border="0"  >          <%    } else {        if  search.getLastException   != null  {  %>                 [ 148 ]   Chapter 5             Error                            <%     } } %>  After the code displaying the results comes the code supporting result pagination.  The CmsSearch class nicely encapsulates this feature by generating the URLs  necessary to page through the results. The URLs contain all the parameters necessary  to maintain the state of the search result window, and are obtained by calling the  getPreviousUrl and the getNextUrl methods. The only other thing needed is  to propagate the fields to include in the search. The fields are obtained earlier and  saved into the fields variable, so this just needs to be appended to the URL.                           <%        if  search.getPreviousUrl   != null  {           %>           <a href="javascript:void 0 ;"             onclick="location.href='                               &fields= ';"><< Previous                       <%        }        Map pageLinks = search.getPageLinks  ;        Iterator iter =  pageLinks.keySet  .iterator  ;        while  iter.hasNext    {           int pageNumber =   Integer iter.next   .intValue  ;           String pageLink = blog.link  String               pageLinks.get new Integer pageNumber   ;           out.print "&nbsp; &nbsp;" ;           if  pageNumber != search.getSearchPage    {           %>                                &fields= ">                           <%           } else {           %>  [ 149 ]   Adding Site Search                                <%                }               }                 if  search.getNextUrl   != null  {               %>           &nbsp; &nbsp;           <a href="javascript:void 0 ;"              onclick="location.href='                                   &fields= ';">Next >>                    <%          }        %>                         The result page also indicates each result page numerically, allowing the user  to navigate directly to a page by clicking on the number. To support this, the  getPageLinks method returns a list of the other result pages. The list is iterated to  generate each link with its corresponding page index.  The remainder of the search template looks very similar to the other templates that  we had developed in Chapter 4.      images mm_spacer.gif "      alt="" width="10" height="1" border="0"  >                                    <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"             element="search_form"  >              <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"             element="ads" >        [ 150 ]   Chapter 5         <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"             element="archives"  >              <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"             element="rss_client"  >              <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"             element="rss_feed"  >                &nbsp;                        &nbsp;               <cms:include file=".. elements common.jsp"             element="footer"  >            &nbsp;           Summary In this chapter, we discussed some concepts on how search indexes are structured  and queried in Lucene. We also discussed how to configure and create an OpenCms  search index, including some settings that are made by hand. We introduced a useful  developer tool for looking at search indexes and finally we went over the code for  supporting the search feature of our blog site.   [ 151 ]    Adding User Registration and  Comment Support  The next step in developing our site is to provide readers with the ability to submit  comments. Recall that our site design requires readers to create a user account in  order to post comments. We will leverage OpenCms to manage the user accounts  and will discuss the OpenCms security model along the way. We will then go over  the code for registering users and adding the comments to our XML documents.   Also in our code discussions, we will go over how to manipulate and publish   content programmatically.  Understanding OpenCms Security OpenCms has a security model built around Users, Groups, and Roles. It is essential  to understand this security model in order to create an effective management  environment as well as to support registered web users. The content management  environment often needs to restrict content editing or access to certain groups. This  is also true for web users where it may be desirable to provide premium content or  features to different user tiers. In this section, we will provide an overview of the  OpenCms security model.  OpenCms has a rich and mature security model that can sometimes be confusing   to understand and configure. In this section, we will describe the various facets   of the security system in order to configure our site the way we want. We will   start by describing Users, Groups, and Roles, and will then discuss Organizational  Units, which have been introduced with OpenCms Version 7.   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  User, Groups, Roles, and Permissions An OpenCms user account or User contains logon credentials and roles required to  access VFS resources and functions in OpenCms. A User is always required to access  content in OpenCms. By default, OpenCms provides three user accounts: Admin,  Guest, and Export. The Admin account is a special account that has access to all  resources and functions in OpenCms. The Guest account is provided as a default  account. It is automatically assigned to users who have not logged in, or do not have  an account. The Guest account cannot access the Workplace or Offline content. It  does however have read access to online content that has been given public access.  Finally, there is the Export account which is a special account used by OpenCms  when content is exported from the VFS to the real file system. This account has the  same access as the Guest account. It exists so that it is possible for exported content  to be treated differently as compared with dynamic content, if necessary.  Roles are used in OpenCms to govern access to certain functions or features. When  a protected function is accessed, OpenCms checks the roles of the accessing user to  ensure that they match those needed to execute the function. The function will be  allowed to be executed only if the user has the required roles. OpenCms uses the  following role definitions:  Role Root Administrator  Parent Role None  Workplace Manager  Root Administrator  Description Users with this role have access to the  entire system. Users with this role may access  Workplace functions, including   the following:                  Cache management Workplace Tools features Resource history access Job scheduling Property definition  management Search index management Downloading of files via the  log file viewer  This role allows the user to be able to  add, delete, import, export and edit  modules. It also allows the user to  import and export data from the VFS.  Database Manager  Root Administrator  [ 154 ]   Role Administrator  Parent Role Root Administrator  Project Manager  Administrator  Account Manager  Administrator  VFS manager  Administrator  Developer  VFS Manager  Workplace User  Administrator  Chapter 6  Description Users with this role have access to  the entire organization unit they are  assigned to. This role allows a user to manage  projects. This role allows a user to manage  users and groups. This role allows a user to manage  any resource within the assigned  organizational unit, superseding  any other permission applied to a  resource. This role provides the ability to  manage JSP files. Users with this role have the ability to  login to the workplace.  Roles may be applied to users, either through the Workplace Explorer or  programmatically. Role management can be confusing at first, because OpenCms  creates some default Groups that implicitly contain Roles, possibly for   compatibility with previous versions. Upon installation, the following default  Groups are available:              Administrators: This group is for users who will have the Root  Administrator role. Guests: This group is for users who have no special roles. Projectmanagers: This group is for users who may manage Projects,  including publishing actions on those projects. By default, this group  contains the Roles of the Workplace User and the Project Manager. Users: This group is for users who will have access to the Workplace. By  default, this group contains the Role of the Workplace User.  The default Groups are special in that they implicitly contain Roles. It is not possible  to remove the Roles from the default Groups, nor is it possible to add Roles to other  Groups. If a User is added to one of these Groups, the User will be granted the Roles.  However, it is important to understand that Group membership does not imply  Role permissions, as the added Roles can be removed independent of the Group  membership. In previous OpenCms versions, Group membership may have had  implied Role permissions, but this is no longer true.  [ 155 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  Role definitions are hierarchical such that adding membership to a parent Role  always adds membership to any child Roles of the parent. Graphically, the Role  hierarchy looks like this:  So, for example, if a user account is granted the VFS Manager Role, it will also be  granted the Developer Role. Also, although the Workplace User Role is not a child of  the Project Manager, Account Manager, or VFS Manager Roles, it will automatically  be added, if any of those Roles are added. This is because the Workplace User role is  implicitly required to be present to use any of those other Roles.  Finally, it is important to understand that it is not possible to assign Roles to a  Group. This is despite the fact that OpenCms implicitly attaches Roles to the default  Groups, and that Roles are actually internally maintained using Groups. Instead,  Roles are applied directly to Users. The fact that Roles are internally maintained as  Groups is an implementation detail which can be confusing. Conceptually, it should  be understood that Roles are only applicable to Users. In general, Group membership  does not denote Role privileges.   While Roles are used to govern function access, resources in the VFS are protected  by permissions. Permissions in OpenCms can be likened to those found in a typical  UNIX file system. The available file permissions are:  [ 156 ]   Chapter 6  Permission Read Write Control  View  Direct Publish  Description Controls the ability of a user to read the content. Controls the ability of a user to write the content. Controls the ability of a user to be able to set the permissions of  the content. Controls the visibility of the content to the user in the   Workplace Explorer. Controls the ability to publish the content without requiring  'publish project' permissions.  In OpenCms, permissions are placed on resources according to both Users and  Groups. Thus, to perform an action on a resource in the VFS, a User must have both  the proper permissions to access the resource, and the proper role to perform the  action. We will apply permissions to our Blog content later on, so that our registered  web users will be able to add their comments.  Organizational Units Anyone familiar with LDAP will understand the concept of an Organizational Unit  or OrgUnit. This is simply a container that is used to collect Users, Groups, or other  OrgUnits together for organization. OpenCms ships with the Root Organization  Unit enabled at the top of the hierarchy. All other OrgUnits that get created will exist  underneath the root.  User, Groups, and Roles are all defined in the context of an OrgUnit. A User account  logging into OpenCms may provide an OrgUnit along with it. The OrgUnit is used  in conjunction with the user name to provide the complete user account name. This  makes it possible to have multiple user accounts with the same login name, residing  in different OrgUnits.  There are many ways that OrgUnits may be used to organize users. Typically an  OrgUnit is created to segment groups of users who have similar site access or  responsibility. For example, an OrgUnit named ContentEditors may be used to  contain all users who have content editing privileges. In this case, the ContentEditors  OrgUnit would appear directly underneath the root:  Root Organizational Unit            ContentEditors  [ 157 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support   However, consider the situation where multiple sites are to be managed in  OpenCms and each site is to have its own distinct editors. In this case, it might be  more desirable to create an OrgUnit for each site, and then to create a ContentEditors  OrgUnit under each site:  Root Organizational Unit            Site A              ContentEditors           Site B              ContentEditors In this way, each site can have its own group of Editors. In fact, with OpenCms, it  is possible to maintain both structures. This might be done for a situation where we  want to have editors who have access to all sites as well as editors that only have  individual access.  As we can see, a properly designed Organizational Unit structure is an essential  consideration in configuring accounts. In the case of our blog site, we will create  an OrgUnit for our site content managers, and will create a sub-OrgUnit for our  registered web users:  Root Organizational Unit            DeepThoughts               SubscribedUser With this strategy, any account that is used to manage site content will appear  under the OrgUnit: OU=\DeepThoughts. These accounts will include content  editors who are responsible for writing the blogs. Users who register online and  want to add comments will be placed into the sub-OrgUnit: OU=\DeepThoughts\ SubscribedUser. This will allow us to segregate reader accounts from management  accounts. In addition to this, we will create a Group named WebUsers which will  contain all users who register online. We can apply resource permissions using this  group so that we can ensure that it has access only to Blog Repository content.  Setting up Security for Our Site We are now ready to setup security settings for our Deep Thoughts site. This will  involve creating the necessary Organizational Units, Groups, and file permissions.  We want our site users to have read-only content access, but for the things we need  to do such as adding accounts and blog comments, those permissions will not   [ 158 ]   Chapter 6  be sufficient. To handle this, we will create two accounts that have the necessary  permissions and then temporarily switch to those accounts while performing the  privileged operations. The two accounts we create are:        BlogAdmin: This account will reside in the DeepThoughts OrgUnit and will  have Administrator privileges. The account will be used by an administrator  to manage user accounts in our site. We will also use this account  programmatically to add new user accounts. CommentPublisher: This account will reside in the DeepThoughts  SubscribeUser OrgUnit. It will be used programmatically to publish content.  Before creating the account, we must create the necessary Organizational Units,  which we will discuss next.  Organization Unit and Group Setup We can setup our OrgUnits and Groups using the Account Management tools in  the Workplace Administrator. We start  with creating the Organization Units by  clicking on the Organizational Unit Management link, and clicking on the New sub  organizational unit link:  [ 159 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  Our Organizational Unit for DeepThoughts will be created underneath the root,   and we will assign all the resources in our site to it. After clicking Ok, will see the  new OrgUnit:  We then add the SubscribedUsers sub organizational unit by clicking on the  DeepThoughts OrgUnit, then on the Organizational Unit Management, and finally  on the New sub organizational unit:  This OrgUnit is slightly different. Here, we want to make sure that the parent  OrgUnit is DeepThoughts, and that the resources are constrained to the Blog  Repository, located at  Blogs :  [ 160 ]   Chapter 6  Next, we create the WebUsers group in our SubscribedUsers OrgUnit by clicking on  the Group Management and the New Group icons:  [ 161 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  We will set the Parent Group to DeepThoughts SubscribedUsers Users. This group  was created for us by OpenCms when the OrgUnit was created. It is based on the  default Users group mentioned previously and contains the Workplace User roles  which are necessary for our users to access Blog content. When we are finished, we can see the following structure by clicking on the Account  Management icon and enabling the Groups option:  [ 162 ]   The next step is to add the users that we mentioned at the beginning of this section.   Adding the Users The users are added into the groups that were just created. First, we will add the  BlogAdmin user. From the Account Management screen, select the DeepThoughts  Site Users org unit:  Chapter 6  [ 163 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  Use the User Management icon, and click on New User to get to the New   User screen:  [ 164 ]   Ensure that  sites default is selected as the site and that the Group is set to  DeepThoughts Users. Next, we want to ensure that the user is part of the  Administrator group. This is done by selecting the Edit Groups of the User icon and  adding the Administrators group:  Chapter 6  Adding the Administrators group will automatically add the  Projectmanagers group, and will also add all roles to the user. This  follows the the earlier discussion on how roles are transferred from   group membership.  Next, we need to add the second user account. The second user account is created in the DeepThoughts SubscribedUser org unit.  This can be selected by going back to the top of the Account Management screen and  clicking on that org unit. The user should be added in the same manner, ensuring  again that the Site is set to  sites default. However, the group for this user is different  and should be set to: Deepthoughts SubscribedUser Users. As we will cover a little later on, the code will need to switch to this user to publish  comments. The code uses the password blogadmin, which is set into a constant. In  a live environment the password would be stored some place where it can be easily  configured, such as a property file. This is an exercise left to the reader.  [ 165 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  The CommentPublisher requires slightly different privileges as compared to the  BlogAdmin user. These are set using the Edit User Roles icon:     Ensure that the user has the Account Manager, Project Manager, and Workplace  user roles. Now that we've got our Groups and Users setup, we can setup file permissions using  the Groups.  Resource Permissions We've created the DeepThoughts SubscribedUser Organizational Unit to contain  all our new web users. We only want to provide web users with the ability to modify  the content in the Blog repository, located at the  Blogs  path in the VFS. To enforce  this, we need to apply resource permissions to the folder.  [ 166 ]   Chapter 6  OpenCms resource permissions work slightly differently from those applied to a  typical file system. In order to restrict access to only a single Group, file permissions  first need to be removed  denied  for all groups, and then added  allowed  for the  desired Group. In our case, we want to allow the Users and WebUsers Groups access  to the  Blogs  path. We want to include the Users group, as it contains all our Web  Management users who are maintaining our Blogs. The Users group has access by  default. So we only have to add access for our WebUsers group. Permissions are set  by clicking on the  Blogs  path and selecting the permissions option:  This brings us to the Change permissions dialog box:  [ 167 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  In the Group selector, type in the group name DeepThoughts SubscribedUser  WebUsers group or enter it directly and then click on the green plus sign:  Enable the Direct Publish, Read, and Write permissions and use the Set button to  add the privileges. This will provide the permissions needed for our web users to  interact with the content in the folder.  We now can move onto the coding, registration, and commenting features of our site.  [ 168 ]   Chapter 6  User Login and Registration Code Our site requires users to register before they can add comments. This will be  supported via an 'Add a Comment' link at the end of each blog. Logged-in users will  be able to add their comments immediately. All others will be taken to a registration  signup page. Registered users may be able to log on at any time through a login  button available at the top of the screen.  To enable this feature, we need to add a new JSP for the user registration page. The  JSP will reside in the elements folder of our module and will be named Register. jsp. The JSP page looks similar to our other JSP templates. At the top, we include the  imports and tag libraries, and then declare and instantiate the bean class:      <%        create the bean     BlogJspTemplate blog = new BlogJspTemplate pageContext,                                           request, response ; %>  The rest of the JSP is like the others, except for the center portion of the page, which  contains the registration form and logic:            images spacer.gif " alt=""            height="40" border="0"  >     <%        int nAction = blog.registerUserAction  ;        if  nAction == BlogJspTemplate.FORMACTION_SHOWFORM   {              display the registration and login forms           blog.include "common.jsp", "register_form" ;        } else {              make the appropriate response           switch nAction  {              case BlogJspTemplate.FORMACTION_OK:                    output a nice message                 out.write " Thank you for registering! " ;                 String strBlog =                           blog.getRequest  .getParameter "blog" ;                 if  null != strBlog && strBlog.length   > 0  {                       allow the user to add the comment now                    blog.include "common.jsp", "comment_form" ;                    out.write " blog: " +                      blog.getRequest  .getParameter "blog"  + " " ;  [ 169 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support                     } else {                       redirect to the home page     blog.getResponse  .sendRedirect blog.link " index.html"  ;                 }                 break;              case BlogJspTemplate.FORMACTION_ERROR:                 %>                 Registration Error:                                                                                    Please try again                  <%                 break;           }        }     %>          The logic starts out by calling a new method in the bean called  registerUserAction. This method performs the registration action and returns  an action code. We will look at that method in a moment. But when the registration  page is shown the first time, it returns the FORMACTION_SHOWFORM code. This causes  the JSP to display the registration form, which is a new template element we've  added to the common.jsp file:          <%        String strBlog = blog.getRequest  .getParameter "blog" ;        if  null == strBlog  {           strBlog = "";        }     %>     <form name="register" method="post"     action="  system modules com.deepthoughts.templates                                   elements Register.jsp ">            "  >                           Please Register or Login to add a comment                       [ 170 ]   Chapter 6                      Username:             <input name="username" type="text"                                         size="20" >                                          Password:             <input name="password" type="password"                                         size="15"  >                                          Re-type password:             <input name="passconfirm"                                         type="password" size="15"  >                                          First Name:             <input name="firstname" type="text"                                         size="15"  >                                          Last Name:             <input name="lastname" type="text"                                         size="15"  >                                           eMail:             <input name="email" type="text"                                         size="15"  >                                                          images spacer.gif "                     alt="" height="1" width="80" border="0"  >               &nbsp;                                                    [ 171 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  We can see that the element has a form code that contains the user input fields  necessary for registration and posting the action back to the Register.jsp file.  When the action is posted back to the JSP, the registerUserAction method   will perform the registration action. If successful, the method returns the  FORMACTION_OK code and the JSP file displays a success message. As it is possible  to reach the registration page from different areas, the code may behave differently.  If the registration page was reached from the context of viewing a blog, then a user  will be able to add a comment directly. However, if the page was reached from the  homepage link where there was no blog clicked upon, the user will be returned back  to homepage.  Now let's take a look at the underlying Java method that performs the   actual registration:  public int registerUserAction   {    get the requested action String strAction = getRequest  .getParameter "action" ;  if  null != strAction  {     String strUser = getRequest  .getParameter "username" ;     String strPass = getRequest  .getParameter "password" ;           attempt to register the user        try {           see if the username already exists       CmsPrincipal.readPrincipal getCmsObject  ,                                CmsPrincipal.PRINCIPAL_USER, strUser ;        setRegisterActionMessage "The user '" + strUser + "' already                          exists. Please select a different username." ;           return FORMACTION_ERROR;        } catch  CmsException e1  {              this is good, it means the username is available        }           get the rest of the account parameters     String strPass2 = getRequest  .getParameter "passconfirm" ;     if  false == strPass2.equals strPass   {        setRegisterActionMessage "Password mis-match, please re-enter                                                    the password. " ;           return FORMACTION_ERROR;     }     String strFirst = getRequest  .getParameter "firstname" ;     String strLast = getRequest  .getParameter "lastname" ;     String strEMail = getRequest  .getParameter "email" ;     try {          to add the user we must first login using the          administrative user we created        getCmsObject  .loginUser USR_DEEPTHOUGHTS_BLOG_ADMIN,  [ 172 ]   Chapter 6                                   USR_DEEPTHOUGHTS_BLOG_ADMIN_PW ;              make sure we have a new session after login for security                reasons           HttpSession session = getRequest  .getSession false ;              if  session != null  {                  session.invalidate  ;         }            session = getRequest  .getSession true ;              switch to the offline project           getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .setCurrentProject                              getCmsObject  .readProject "Offline"  ;              add additional user information      CmsUser newUser =                  getCmsObject  .createUser OU_DEEPTHOUGHTS_REGUSERS                  + strUser, strPass, "Web User", new Hashtable   ;           newUser.setEmail strEMail ;           newUser.setFirstname strFirst ;           newUser.setLastname strLast ;              add the user to the WebUsers group           getCmsObject  .addUserToGroup newUser.getName  ,               OU_DEEPTHOUGHTS_REGUSERS + GRP_DEEPTHOUGHTS_WEBUSERS ;              add the role to the user           OpenCms.getRoleManager  .addUserToRole getCmsObject  ,               CmsRole.WORKPLACE_USER, newUser.getName   ;              save changes           getCmsObject  .writeUser newUser ;              switch back to online project           getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .           setCurrentProject getCmsObject  .readProject                                        CmsProject.ONLINE_PROJECT_ID  ;              now login the newly added user           return loginUser strUser, strPass ;        } catch  CmsException e  {           e.printStackTrace  ;           setRegisterActionMessage e.getLocalizedMessage   ;              make sure to logout the admin user, and revert to Guest           logout  ;           return FORMACTION_ERROR;        } }           no registration action to take return FORMACTION_SHOWFORM; }  [ 173 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  As mentioned previously, this method returns an action code to the caller. We see  that the code starts out by looking for a CGI variable named action. This variable  is present when the user provides registration information and presses the Submit  button. If the variable is not present, then the method returns the code instructing the  JSP to display the registration form.  When the form is posted, the method retrieves the variables and then does some  basic checking. First, it verifies whether the username is available by using the  CmsPrincipal.readPrincipal method. If the method returns an exception, then it  means the username does not exist and can be used. Otherwise, an error message is  set and an error action code is returned.  After performing another basic check to ensure that both passwords match, we  are ready to create the new user account. Creating new accounts requires the  Account Manager's privilege. So we must first switch to an account that has this  privilege. Rather than use the Admin account which has access to the entire VFS,  we use the BlogAdmin account mentioned earlier. This account resides within  the DeepThoughts Organizational Unit and has Administrator privilege only to  that OrgUnit. The code temporarily logs in to this user account in order to obtain  the access needed to add the new account. To ensure that we remove any session  information, the session is also invalidated.  The new user account may now be added. But, we are currently in the Online  project. It is not possible to create a user account in the Online project. So we switch  to the Offline project, and then call createUser to add the account. After creating the  account, the user's name and email are added to the CmsUser object.  The username is prefixed with our OrgUnit path:    DeepThoughts SubscribedUser .  Next, we add the user to the WebUsers group of our OrgUnit. As the registered user  will be allowed to add comments, we have to grant the Workplace User role, which  is done by calling the addUserToRole method.  To preserve the changes made to the CmsUser object, we must save the object, which  is done by calling writeUser. Finally, we switch back to the Online project, and then  log in the user.  Any errors at the end of the method are handled by setting an error return message  and printing a diagnostic stack trace. We can also ensure that the user is logged out,  in case an error occurs while using the BlogAdmin account. This ensures that the  user session is lowered back to Guest privilege. A more sophisticated error handling  mechanism should be used for a production level application.  [ 174 ]   That takes care of the registration process. Next we will look at the code that handles  the login. At the end of the registerUserAction method, a call is made to the  loginUser method, which handles the login action:  Chapter 6  protected int loginUser String User, String Password  {        now login as the newly added user     CmsProject curProj = getRequestContext  .currentProject  ;     try {           attempt to login the user        String OU = OU_DEEPTHOUGHTS_REGUSERS + User;        getCmsObject  .loginUser OU, Password ;           make sure we have a new session after login for security             reasons        HttpSession session = getRequest  .getSession false ;     if  session != null  {        session.invalidate  ;     }     session = getRequest  .getSession true ;     } catch  CmsException e  {           return error code        setRegisterActionMessage e.getLocalizedMessage   ;        return FORMACTION_ERROR;     } finally {           switch back to original project        getRequestContext  .setCurrentProject curProj ;     }          return FORMACTION_OK; }  The method starts out by retrieving the project context so that we may restore it after  login. It then logs in the user again, first prefixing the OrgUnit name to the username.  We once again ensure that any session information is destroyed. Finally, before  returning, we ensure that the original project is restored. This login method has been  separated from the registerUserAction code so that it may be re-used. After a  user has registered, he or she may log in by filling in the username and password in  the upper righthand side of the site where we have modified the template code to  present a login form. We've done this by making some slight changes to the header  element in the common.jsp file:              <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%"              align="center" border="0">           [ 175 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support                                                                      &nbsp;&nbsp;         <script language="JavaScript"                   type="text javascript">document.write TODAY ;          &nbsp;                                                        <%                    if  blog.getRequestContext  .currentUser  .                                                  isGuestUser    {                 %>             <form class="login" action="                                   index.html ">                           <input name="blog"                      value=" "                      type="hidden">             Username: <input class="input" name="username" value=""                                type="text" size="10">             Password: <input class="input" name="password" value=""                                type="password" size="10">                       <input class="submit" type="submit"                                name="Submit" value="Login"  >                          system modules com.deepthoughts.templates                         elements Register.jsp ">Register                     <%               } else {           %>               Welcome:  &nbsp;              <form class="login" name="login"                      action="  index.html ">                                 <input class="submit" type="submit" name="Submit"                         value="Logout"  >                                                                     [ 176 ]   Chapter 6             <img height="1"                 alt="spacer.gif" width="1" border="0"                 src="  images spacer.gif "  >                                       The new code checks if the current user is a Guest user and if so, displays a login  form. If the user is not a Guest user, then it displays the user name and a logout  button instead. Note that the login form is submitted back to the index.html file. In  order to handle the login request, we need to place our action code somewhere. An  easy way to handle this is to place the login handler right inside the constructor of  the BlogJspTemplate bean:  public BlogJspTemplate PageContext context, HttpServletRequest req,                                             HttpServletResponse res  {     super context, req, res ;     String strAction = req.getParameter "action" ;      if  null != strAction  {        if  strAction.equals "logout"   {           logout  ;        } else if  strAction.equals "login"   {           loginUser req.getParameter "username" ,                       req.getParameter "password"  ;        }     } }  The changes to the constructor causes it to look for the action parameter. If present,  it indicates that a submit action was performed. Both the login and logout actions  are handled. If the user logs in, it fields the username and password and calls the  loginUser method. Otherwise, while logging out, the logout method is called:   public void logout   {     HttpSession session = getRequest  .getSession false ;     if  session != null  {        session.invalidate  ;     }        logout was successful     try {        getResponse  .sendRedirect link " index.html"  ;     } catch  IOException e  {           TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace  ;     } }  [ 177 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  The method simply invalidates the session and then redirects the user to the   index page.  Adding Comment Support Now that we've provided a way for users to register and login, we can add code for  them to add comments. Although there are many ways to support this feature, we  will take an approach that serves to illustrate the capability of programmatically  editing content and publishing it. Recall that our Blog content type structure contains  nested comment content types. As users post comments, we will append them to  the parent Blog content item using nested comments. Readers view content from  the online project where it is not possible to make content changes. Our approach  then will be to switch the user temporarily to the Offline project, add the comment,  publish the blog, and then revert to the Online project.  Before doing this, lets modify the template to display the blog comment   information. First, we must add some comments, which can be done easily through  the Workplace Explorer. Go ahead and add some comments so that we have  some testing data. To display the comment information, we add some code to the  BlogHomepage.jsp template:                             Comments                       <%              blog.getBlogComments  ;              while  blog.hasMoreComments    { %>                                                                                             "                    type="date" dateStyle="LONG"                     pattern="MM dd yyyy hh:mm a" >                              <%=                                     blog.getCommentField "Comment"  %>                              &nbsp;                  [ 178 ]   Chapter 6                                                          ">Add your                                                 comment                    The new JSP code starts by calling the getBlogComments method. This method  gathers all the comments for the current Blog so that we can iterate over and display  them. This method simply uses the inherited contentloop method for collecting the  comments for later iterations:  public void getBlogComments   {     m_iComments = contentloop m_iContent, FIELD_COMMENT ; }  Next, we use a loop to iterate over each comment, and call some methods to display  the comment data, including some meta-information such as who submitted it and  when it was submitted. Outside the loop at the end of the comments, we provide an Add Comment link.  We use the getAddCommentUrl method to retrieve the proper link destination. If  the current user is logged in, then the link will go to a JSP for adding a comment,  otherwise, the user will be directed to the Register.jsp page:  public String getAddCommentUrl   {     CmsUser user = getRequestContext  .currentUser  ;     String OU = getRequestContext  .getOuFqn  ;     if  user.isGuestUser    {        return link URL_REGISTER + "?blog=" +                      m_iContent.getResourceName   ;     } else {        return link URL_ADD_COMMENT + "?blog=" +                      m_iContent.getResourceName   ;     } }  The method appends the blog parameter to the end of the URL so that we may  propagate that value through.  [ 179 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support  Now let's take a look at the JSP for adding the comments. We create a new JSP file  named AddComment.jsp located in our module elements directory. This template  is also similar to the others except for the middle portion, where we add a form and  logic for posting the comment. The JSP is similar to the registration JSP, except that it  calls the addCommentAction method:                  <%        int nAction = blog.addCommentAction  ;        if  nAction == BlogJspTemplate.FORMACTION_SHOWFORM  {              display user form for adding a comment           blog.include "common.jsp", "comment_form" ;        } else {                blog.getResponse  .sendRedirect blog.link                            blog.getRequest  .getParameter "blog"   ;        }        %>          Here, the first time the JSP is called, it displays the comment form, which is another  new element added to the common.jsp file. Otherwise, the JSP will redirect back  to the blog contained in the blog parameter. This happens after a comment has  been added to re-display the blog with the newly added comment at the end. The  addCommentAction method does all the work:  public int addCommentAction   {    was anything posted?     String strComment = getRequest  .getParameter "comment" ;     if  null != strComment  {           yes, now load the blog and add the comment        try {           m_iContent.hasMoreContent  ;              add the comment           addCommentToBlog m_iContent.getResourceName  , strComment ;              publish the blog           publishBlog m_iContent.getResourceName   ;           return FORMACTION_OK;        } catch  JspException e  {           e.printStackTrace  ;        }     }    show the action form return FORMACTION_SHOWFORM; }  [ 180 ]   Chapter 6  The method first looks for the comment parameter to indicate that a comment  is being added. If not, it returns FORMACTION_SHOWFORM code to cause the JSP to  display the comment form. If a comment is being added, it makes a call to the  hasMoreContent method. This is necessary because of the way the collection  mechanism, inherited from the CmsJspCmlContentBean, works. The usage model  for this bean is to first call the contentload method to collect the content to the  m_iContent collection, and then to display it. However, the implementation is such  that content is loaded when the hasMoreContent method is called. After calling this  method, the remaining method is split into two parts, one for adding the comment  and another for publishing it online.  Adding the Comments to the XML Content To add a new comment, we must locate the Blog XML content and add a new XML  comment element to it. The addCommentToBlog method does this:  protected void addCommentToBlog String Blog, String strComment  {     try {           adding content must be done in the Offline project            getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .setCurrentProject                               getCmsObject  .readProject "Offline"  ;    first we read the blog to count the number of existing comments in     it. We need to know in order to be able to add another comment to     the end        CmsFile docFile = m_iContent.getXmlDocument  .getFile  ;        CmsXmlContent content =               CmsXmlContentFactory.unmarshal getCmsObject  , docFile ;        int nComments = 1;        List l = content.getValues "Comment",                                      getRequestContext  .getLocale   ;     nComments = l.size  ;    Now we can add the nested Comment at the end of the list     I_CmsXmlContentValue val = content.addValue getCmsObject  ,                         FIELD_COMMENT,getRequestContext  .getLocale  ,                                                             nComments ;        once the comment is added we can set the individual fields         into it     nComments++;     String strCommentNdx = "[" + Integer.toString nComments  + "]";     val = content.getValue FIELD_COMMENT + strCommentNdx +                         " User[1]", getRequestContext  .getLocale   ;     val.setStringValue getCmsObject  ,                          getRequestContext  .currentUser  .getName   ;         set date time        val = content.getValue FIELD_COMMENT + strCommentNdx +   [ 181 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support                        " Date[1]", getRequestContext  .getLocale   ;        val.setStringValue getCmsObject  ,                             Long.toString System.currentTimeMillis    ;         set comment        val = content.getValue FIELD_COMMENT + strCommentNdx +                        " Comment[1]", getRequestContext  .getLocale   ;        val.setStringValue getCmsObject  , strComment ;         now we save the changes to the VFS        String decodedContent = content.toString  ;           try {                    docFile.setContents decodedContent.getBytes                        CmsEncoder.lookupEncoding "UTF-8", "UTF-8"   ;         } catch  UnsupportedEncodingException e  {         e.printStackTrace  ;         }         String strFile = m_iContent.getResourceName  ;         getCmsObject  .lockResource strFile ;         getCmsObject  .writeFile docFile ;         getCmsObject  .unlockResource strFile ;     } catch  CmsXmlException e  {           TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace  ;     } catch  CmsException e  {           TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace  ;     }        switch back to online project try {        getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .     setCurrentProject getCmsObject  .readProject                                      CmsProject.ONLINE_PROJECT_ID  ;     } catch  CmsException e  {           TODO Auto-generated catch block        e.printStackTrace  ;     } }  As content cannot be modified in the Online project, the routine starts out by  switching to the Offline project. To work with the content, a CmsXmlContent object is  obtained by unmarshalling, or parsing the XML. Next, a count of the current number  of comments is obtained, as the new comment needs to be added to the end using its  new index number.  [ 182 ]   The new comment is easily added by using the addValue method with the name  of the field being added. This call adds an empty nested Comment content type at  the desired index. The fields in the Comment need to be filled in with the submitted  values. The fields are addressed using the XPath syntax, which requires the  Comment index number. The resulting field paths look something like:  Chapter 6      Comment[3] User[1]     Comment[3] Date[1]     Comment[3] Comment[1]  We calculate the date and username values and the Comment field comes from the  user submission. The new comment is then put back into the document using the  setContents method.  The last thing left to do is write the changes back to the VFS. We first need to lock  the resource so that it can be written to. After doing this, the resource is written and  then unlocked. Note that this routine is only illustrative and it is not suggested that  this routine be used in production environments. This is because it does not account  for scenarios such as the file already being locked by an editor. For production level  code, considerations such as this would need to be handled.  Before returning, the routine switches the user back to the online project so that they  have read-only content access once again.  Publishing the Comments Once the comment has been added to the Offline blog, it must be published for  viewers to see the new comment. This is implemented in the publishBlog method:  protected void publishBlog String Blog  {        remember the current user     CmsUser user = getRequestContext  .currentUser  ;     try {           login publish user we created for publishing comments        getCmsObject.loginUser           USR_DEEPTHOUGHTS_COMMENT_PUBLISHER,          USR_DEEPTHOUGHTS_COMMENT_PUBLISHER_PW ;           switch to the offline project     getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .          setCurrentProject getCmsObject  .             readProject "Offline"  ;           publish the Blog resource        CmsPublishManager pm = OpenCms.getPublishManager  ;        pm.publishResource getCmsObject  , Blog ;     } catch  CmsException e  {           print out stack trace in case of error  [ 183 ]   Adding User Registration and Comment Support         e.printStackTrace  ;     } catch  Exception e  {           print out stack trace in case of error        e.printStackTrace  ;     } finally {        try {           restore original user and switch to online           OpenCms.getSessionManager  .               switchUser getCmsObject  ,getRequest  , user ;           getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .setCurrentProject                            getCmsObject  .readProject                            CmsProject.ONLINE_PROJECT_ID  ;        } catch  CmsException e  {              something went wrong           e.printStackTrace  ;              if this fails fall back to logging out              and reverting to guest           logout  ;        }     } }  Online readers do not have any ability to publish content, content may only be  published from the Offline project. The publish method uses another account for  performing this action, just like the registerUser method. The CommentPublisher  user is used for this purpose.  First, the logged in user is saved into a local variable so it may be restored  afterwards. After logging in as the privileged user, the Offline project is switched  to. Publishing the content is simple by using the CmsPublishManager class.  The publishResource method required only the resource being published as a  parameter. The entire operation is contained within a try block so that cleanup can  be performed in case any errors occur. The cleanup handler reverses the action by  restoring the original user. If a failure occurs during cleanup, then the guest user is  fallen back to by logging out.  Summary That wraps up the addition of comment support. In this chapter, we learned about  user accounts, OpenCms security, and the purpose of Organizational Units. We  discussed how to set up groups and file permissions. We also discussed the code  necessary to manipulate structured content programmatically. Finally, we illustrated  the code for publishing content.  [ 184 ]      Providing Site   Customization Features  In this chapter, we will add basic customization capabilities to our site, giving  registered users the ability to specify a custom RSS feed to be displayed in the  righthand side column. During the course of the chapter, we will show how simple   it can be to allow for user customizations. We also will show how to integrate   third-party features such as RSS support into OpenCms. In a later chapter, we will  extend the RSS support to provide an outgoing RSS feed from our blog content.  What is RSS? RSS is generally known as a content syndication format, but the actual definition of  the RSS acronym and its corresponding format has evolved over the years. Its most  current definition refers to the following formats:         RSS 2.0: Really Simple Syndication RSS 1.0 RSS 0.90: RDF Site Summary RSS 0.91: Rich Site Summary  All these formats specify different XML schemas that are used for content  syndication. While the idea of RSS has been around for a while, each format is  different and incompatible and there is currently no de-facto standard RSS format.  With all these differences, it would be risky to support only a single format as an  RSS client. Fortunately, there is a third-party Java library available that attempts  to address this problem. The ROME Project is an Open Source Java library that  provides a universal programmatic interface to these all popular RSS formats.  Documentation and downloads for ROME can be found at: for ROME can be found at: http:  rome.dev.  for ROME can be found at: java.net. We will integrate the ROME library into our site to provide RSS client  support for a wide variety of formats.   Providing Site Customization Features  Creating the Module Rather than placing the RSS support into the template module, we will create a new  module for it. This will allow us to later provide RSS support to other sites we may  develop. Let's create the new module and name it: com.deepthoughts.rss.  When you create the module, remember to check all the subfolder options as we will  use these later on.  When the Create lib subfolder option is checked, the lib folder will automatically  be defined as an export point to the WEB-INF lib folder. This means that to include  the required ROME jar files we only need to upload them into the lib folder. After  uploading the jar files, the lib folder should look like this:  [ 186 ]   Chapter 7  Now, when we publish the module, or if it is exported and imported into another  site, the necessary jar files will get deployed for us.  Integrating Jar Files into OpenCms While integrating jar files from third party libraries, each new jar file  must be checked against an existing OpenCms jar file. If a version already  exists, then the latest version should always be used. This may require  a procedure which involves removing older jar files manually. Also,  OpenCms jar file names include version numbers, while third party  applications or libraries using the same jar files often do not. For example,  a third party library may utilize Apache Commons Logging by including  commons-logging.jar, which is from the 1.0.2 release. OpenCms also  uses this library, named commons-logging-1.1.jar. In this case, it is not  obvious which version is the most recent. So some work will need to be  done to determine this. Failure to resolve conflicts of this type may often  cause random errors, so care should be taken to ensure that only one  version exists and that it is the latest version.  Next, we will create a bean class and a jar file that our template may use to easily  read and display an RSS feed.  The RSS Client Code The ROME library makes it extremely simple to parse and read RSS feeds. Thorough  documentation on the ROME library can be found at its website. So we will only  cover its usage briefly. Rather than use ROME directly in our JSP, we wrap up access  to the RSS feed through a Java bean. The Java bean code is very straightforward:   public class RSSReader {      ** The URL of the RSS Feed *      protected String m_strFeed;      ** SyndFeedInput instance *      protected SyndFeedInput m_input;      ** SyndFeed instance *      protected SyndFeed m_feed;      ** This contains the list of RSS Items *      protected List m_lstItems;      ** This is an iterator for the items *      protected Iterator m_iItems;      ** Error message *      protected String m_strError = "";  [ 187 ]   Providing Site Customization Features  The RSSReader class starts out with some instance variable declarations. In the  constructor, the variables are initialized and the RSS feed URL is captured:      public RSSReader String Feed  {        m_strFeed = Feed;        m_input = new SyndFeedInput  ;        m_feed = null;        m_lstItems = null;        m_iItems = null;     }  An instance of the ROME SyndFeedInput class, which will do most of the RSS work,  is also created. The readAll method is where the actual RSS feed is parsed and read:  public boolean readAll   {     try {           Create the URL connection        URLConnection conn = new URL m_strFeed .openConnection  ;           some feeds require User-Agent identification        conn.setRequestProperty "User-Agent", "DeepThoughts RSS                                                            Reader" ;           build the feed and read all the entries        m_feed = m_input.build new XmlReader conn  ;        m_lstItems = m_feed.getEntries  ;        return true;     } catch  IllegalArgumentException e  {        m_strError = e.getMessage  ;     } catch  MalformedURLException e  {        m_strError = e.getMessage  ;     } catch  FeedException e  {        m_strError = e.getMessage  ;     } catch  IOException e  {        m_strError = e.getMessage  ;     }     return false; }  One important thing to note about this method is that it sets the User-Agent request  property, which is required by some RSS feeds to work properly. In the event of an  error, the simple bean class sets an error string to the returned exception message. A  Boolean is returned to indicate success or failure.    [ 188 ]   The bean has been designed to be used in a loop by the caller and provides the  hasMore and getNext methods to support this pattern:  Chapter 7  public boolean hasMore   {     if  null != m_lstItems  {        if  null == m_iItems  {           m_iItems = m_lstItems.iterator  ;        }        return m_iItems.hasNext  ;     }     return false; }  public SyndEntry getNext   {     if  hasMore    {        return  SyndEntry  m_iItems.next  ;     }     return null; }  The hasMore method will seed the iterator the first time it is called and will check it  to see if there are any items left to iterate. Finally, the getNext method just returns  the next item from the iterator:  The RSSReader bean class will be put into a jar file and placed into the module lib  directory, where it will get deployed along with the rest of the module.  Displaying the RSS Feed in the Template Now that there is a bean to access an RSS feed, it may be used directly in the  template code. For the blog site it will be displayed in the righthand column for all  pages. Recall that a placeholder exists for the RSS feeds in the common.jsp template  file. We just need to fill in the code now to use the RSSReader bean:                    Feeds                  <%              get feed from user preference           String feedURL = "http:  news.google.com ?output=rss";           RSSReader r = new RSSReader feedURL ;           if  r.readAll    {              for  SyndEntry e = r.getNext  ; e != null; e =   [ 189 ]   Providing Site Customization Features                                                    r.getNext    {                 %>                  <a title=""                          href=" ">                                                          <%              }           } else {              %>  <%           }        %>                   Notice that a hard-coded RSS feed URL is used as the feed source. Later on, we will  retrieve the URL from a user account settings field. Next, an instance of the bean  is created with the feed URL and the readAll method is called to read the entries.  After we read in all the RSS entries they are displayed in a loop and formatted  using a List Item tag. The feed data fields are then displayed in the template. If an  error occurs while reading the feed, then its corresponding error message will be  displayed in place of the feed item list.  Caching RSS Feed Content Since RSS feeds can take time to parse and may change infrequently,  they are good candidates for caching. In fact, all page templates should  be considered for caching. OpenCms provides page caching through a  feature called Flexcache. Examples and use of this feature can be found in  the OpenCms documentation set.  As we can see, the use of the ROME library makes it simple to read RSS feeds. The  last task is to change the hard-coded feed URL to one that users may change in their  account settings.  Adding User Preferences to Accounts We would like to give registered users the ability to specify a custom RSS feed in  their account settings. OpenCms makes this trivial by providing a generic means of  setting additional attributes on account information. Account settings may be added  in the Workplace Administration user interface via the User  Edit Additional   Info icon:  [ 190 ]   Chapter 7  Additional user account information can be added using simple name-value pairs.  To allow for custom feeds, we will use a key of RSS_FEED and set its value to the feed  URL. Programmatically, the value is accessed by calling the getAdditionalInfo  method of the CmsUser object:  CmsUser user =  obtain user object ; String strFeed = user.getAdditionalInfo "RSS_FEED" ;  Setting account information is just as easy by first placing name‑value pairs into a  Map object and then using the setAdditionalInfo method:  String strFeed = "http:  news.google.com ?output=rss"; Map additionalInfo = new HashMap 1 ; additionalInfo.put "RSS_FEED", strFeed ; newUser.setAdditionalInfo additionalInfo ;  This provides the framework necessary to allow users to customize their accounts.  All this gets tied together with account management code and the JSP template.  Updating the Java Code Let's start with looking at the changes to the registerUserAction method of the  BlogJsptemplate class. We'll alter this method so that it can manage updates to the  account information. First, there is some additional code to tie the RSS feed to the  user account settings. The RSS feed will be provided by a new form field, which will  be added to the registration form:  CmsUser newUser = getCmsObject  .createUser OU_DEEPTHOUGHTS_REGUSERS                      + strUser, strPass, "Web User", new Hashtable   ;     newUser.setEmail strEMail ;     newUser.setFirstname strFirst ;     newUser.setLastname strLast ;        add the RSS Feed     String strFeed = getRequest  .getParameter RSS_FEED_URL ;     Map additionalInfo = new HashMap 1 ;     additionalInfo.put "RSS_FEED", strFeed ;     newUser.setAdditionalInfo additionalInfo ;    add the user to the WebUsers group  [ 191 ]   Providing Site Customization Features      getCmsObject  .addUserToGroup newUser.getName  ,                 OU_DEEPTHOUGHTS_REGUSERS + GRP_DEEPTHOUGHTS_WEBUSERS ;    add the role to the user     OpenCms.getRoleManager  .addUserToRole           getCmsObject  , CmsRole.WORKPLACE_USER, newUser.getName   ;  The RSS_FEED_URL value is a string constant with a value of 'RSS_FEED'. It is used  both as a key value for the users' additional info, and for the name of the form field  to be filled in by the user.  That takes care of new registrations. For updating account information, a new  condition is added to handle the update action. The end of the method checks for the  action and handles it by updating the account information:         } else if  strAction.equals "update"   {              update the user           CmsUser user =                  getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .currentUser  ;              get the account parameters           String strPass = getRequest  .getParameter "password" ;           String strPass2 =                    getRequest  .getParameter "passconfirm" ;           if  false == strPass2.equals strPass   {              setRegisterActionMessage "Password mis-match, please                                       re-enter the password. " ;              return FORMACTION_ERROR;           }              update the settings           if  strPass.length  > 0  {           user.setPassword strPass ;           }           user.setFirstname getRequest  .getParameter "firstname"  ;           user.setLastname getRequest  .getParameter "lastname"  ;           user.setEmail getRequest  .getParameter "email"  ;           String strFeed = getRequest  .getParameter "rss" ;           Map additionalInfo = new HashMap 1 ;           additionalInfo.put RSS_FEED_URL, strFeed ;           user.setAdditionalInfo additionalInfo ;              save the user object           try {              getCmsObject  .writeUser user ;           } catch  CmsException e  {              e.printStackTrace  ;              setRegisterActionMessage e.getLocalizedMessage   ;              return FORMACTION_ERROR;           }  [ 192 ]          }     }        no registration action to take     return FORMACTION_SHOWFORM;  }  Chapter 7  It is not necessary to switch to the Admin user, as was done for  registration, because the user has the necessary privileges for updating  his account. This is unlike the registration case, where a new account was  being added, requiring a higher privilege.  Now let's move on to the JSP template.  Updating the JSP Templates To tie all the pieces together, the JSP pages need to be updated to use the new classes  just created. First, we add the form field for the users' RSS feed URL. Since this form  is also used to update existing accounts, it will be changed to display any existing  field values. The registration code is in the common.jsp template element. The code  updates are highlighted below:          <%        String strBlog = blog.getRequest  .getParameter "blog" ;        if  null == strBlog  {           strBlog = "";        }           this form is used for both a new registration and for             updating           user account settings. When updating, the 'forupdate'             variable           will be present        String strUpdate =                        blog.getRequest  .getParameter "forupdate" ;        boolean bUpdate = strUpdate!=null && strUpdate.equals "true" ;        String strMsg = bUpdate?            "Update Account Settings" : "Please Register or Login to              add comments";           get the user        CmsUser user =               blog.getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .currentUser  ;        String strUsername = user.getSimpleName  ;  [ 193 ]   Providing Site Customization Features         if  user.isGuestUser              strUsername = "";           get any RSS feed        String strFeed =  String  user.getAdditionalInfo  .get                           BlogJspTemplate.RSS_FEED_PARAM ;        if  null == strFeed            strFeed = "";     %>     <form name="register" method="post"     action="  system modules         com.deepthoughts.templates elements Register.jsp ">     <input type="hidden" name="action"                       value=" "  >      "  >                                                           Username:             <input name="username" type="text"                                   size="20"                                 value=" " >                                          Password:             <input name="password" type="password"                 size="20"  >                                          Re-type password:             <input name="passconfirm"                                          type="password" size="20"  >                                          First Name:             <input name="firstname" type="text"                          size="20" value=" " >                                [ 194 ]   Chapter 7             Last Name:             <input name="lastname" type="text"                           size="20" value=" " >                                          eMail:             <input name="email" type="text"                              size="20" value=" " >                                          RSS Feed:             <input name="rss" type="text"                                       size="20" value=" " >                                                          images spacer.gif "                     alt="" height="1" width="80" border="0"  >               &nbsp;              <input type="submit"                       value=" " >                                     In order to handle changes made from both the Registration and Account Update  actions, the forupdate parameter is used. This parameter is passed by the Account  Update page only. While updating, the current user account information is retrieved  and the existing values are displayed. The form is submitted back to the Registration  page with the action code, update, to ensure that the update action occurs.  Next, the common template element needs to be updated to display the users'  custom RSS feed. To facilitate this, a new method is added to the BlogJspTemplate  class to retrieve the feed URL:      public String getUserRSSFeedURL   {           get feed from user preference        String feedURL =  String                   getRequestContext  .currentUser  .getAdditionalInfo                  RSS_FEED_PARAM ;           if nothing is set and its not the guest user, then try to   [ 195 ]   Providing Site Customization Features            read the value           from the guest user account        if  null == feedURL && false ==                     getRequestContext  .currentUser  .isGuestUser    {           try {              return  String  getCmsObject  .readUser                            OpenCms.getDefaultUsers  .getUserGuest   .                            getAdditionalInfo RSS_FEED_PARAM ;           } catch  CmsException e  {              e.printStackTrace  ;           }        }        return DEFAULT_RSS_URL;     }  The method first attempts to retrieve the settings from the account of the currently  logged in user. If no value is found, it then checks to see if the current user is the  Guest user. If the user is a Guest user, but no feed is found, then it falls back to a  default feed URL. Otherwise, the method uses the Guest account to obtain the   RSS_FEED value. This logic allows the Guest account to contain the default RSS  fallback URL, rather than having to update any code. The resulting changes are  highlighted next:            Feeds                  <%              get the feed from the user account           RSSReader r = new RSSReader blog.getUserRSSFeedURL   ;           if  r.readAll    {              for  SyndEntry e = r.getNext  ; e != null; e =                                                  r.getNext    {  Hooking up the Account Management Page The existing registration page allows new accounts to be created, but a page is   also needed to allow existing users to manage their account information. For this,  a new JSP page named Manage.jsp will be added. This page looks just like the  Register.jsp page except that it passes some parameters to control the   common.jsp form element:                 images spacer.gif " alt=""               height="40" border="0"  >        <%  [ 196 ]   Chapter 7            int nAction = blog.registerUserAction  ;           if  nAction == BlogJspTemplate.FORMACTION_SHOWFORM  {                  pass some parameters to the form                  display element             Map params = new HashMap 1 ;             params.put "forupdate", "true" ;             params.put "action", "manage" ;              blog.include "common.jsp","register_form", params ;           } else {                 make the appropriate response              switch nAction  {                 case BlogJspTemplate.FORMACTION_OK:                    output a nice message                 out.write "Account Settings Updated. " ;              break;  Notice that the only difference is that the forupdate parameter is passed to the  common.jsp element. This allows the element to set the action and output for  updating an account, rather than creating one. With a little more work, the   Manage.jsp and Register.jsp files can be merged together, but that exercise will  be left to the reader.  Lastly, there needs to be a way for logged in users to get to the Account Management  page. This is managed by updating the header element in the common.jsp template:  } else {     %>     Welcome:  &nbsp;       <form class="login" name="login"              action="  index.html ">                 <input class="submit" type="submit"                 name="Submit" value="Logout"  >             system modules           com.deepthoughts.templates elements           Manage.jsp ">My Account     The additional link to the Account Management page will be displayed for logged   in users.  [ 197 ]   Providing Site Customization Features  Summary That wraps up the support for reading custom RSS feeds. In this chapter, we learned  how to tie custom settings to user accounts, how to integrate a third party library  into OpenCms, and how to use ROME to read RSS feeds. We built upon our existing  registration page to allow for account management and updated our common  template file to display the Feeds.  We also created a new module to contain our support classes and the ROME library.  Placing the libraries into a module allows OpenCms to manage the deployment of  the necessary jar files into the OpenCms installation when the module is imported  into a new system. In a later chapter, we will expand on this module to also provide  support for outgoing RSS Feeds from the blog content.  [ 198 ]      Extending OpenCms:  Developing a Custom Widget  As we saw in Chapter 4, when designing a structured content type, there are a  variety of user interface widgets available. The default widgets cover most   user interface needs. But sometimes, a data field may need to be populated in   some other way. OpenCms allows for custom widgets to be created and plugged  into its architecture. In this chapter, we will design and create our own widget to  illustrate this.  Designing a Custom Widget Going back to the blog content type created in Chapter 3, we see that the category  field is populated from a drop‑down list provided by a SelectorWidget. The  SelectorWidget obtains its values from the static configuration string defined  within the blog schema file. This design is problematic as we would like category  values to be easily changed or added. Ideally, the list of category values should  be able to be updated by site content editors. Fortunately, we can create our own  custom widget to handle this requirement.  An OpenCms widget is a Java class that implements the I_CmsWidget interface,  located in the org.opencms.widgets package. The interface contains a number  of methods that must be implemented. First there are some methods dealing with  instantiation and configuration of the widget:       newInstance: This returns a new instance of the widget. setConfiguration: This method is called after the widget has been  initialized to configure it. The configuration information is passed as a string  value coming from the declaration of the widget within the schema file of the  content type using it.                                 Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget  getConfiguration: This is called to retrieve the configuration information  for the widget.  Next, there are some methods used to handle the rendering. These methods are  called by widget enabled dialogs that might be used in a structured content editor  or an administration screen. The methods provide any Javascript, CSS, or HTML  needed by the widget dialogs:  getDialogIncludes: This method is called to retrieve any Javascript or CSS  includes that may be used by the widget. getDialogInitCall: This method may return Javascript code that performs  initialization or makes calls to other Javascript initialization methods needed  by the widget. getDialogInitMethod: This method may return Javascript code containing  any functions needed by the widget. getDialogHtmlEnd: This method is called at the end of the dialog and may  be used to return an HTML or Javascript needed by the widget. getDialogWidget: This method returns the actual HTML and Javascript  used to render the widget along with its values. getHelpBubble: This method returns the HTML for displaying the help icon  relating to this widget. getHelpText: This method returns the HTML for displaying the help text  relating to this widget.  Lastly, there are some methods used to get and set the widget value:  getWidgetStringValue: This method returns the value selected from   the widget. setEditorValue: This method sets the value into the widget.  All these methods have base implementations in the A_CmsWidget class. In most  cases, the base methods do not need to be overridden. As such, we will not cover all  the methods in detail. If it is necessary to override the methods, the best way to get  an idea of how to implement them is to look at the code using them.  All widgets are used in dialog boxes which have been enabled for widgets, by  implementing the I_CmsWidgetDialog interface. There are two general instances of  these dialogs, one is used for editing structured XML content, the other is found in  any dialog appearing in the Administration View. The two classes implementing this  interface are:  org.opencms.workplace.CmsWidgetDialog org.opencms.workplace.editors.CmsXmlContentEditor  [ 200 ]   Chapter 8  The CmsWidgetDialog class is itself a base class, which is used by all dialogs found  in the Administrative View.  Before designing a new widget, it is useful to examine the existing widget code. The  default OpenCms widgets can be found in the org.opencms.widgets package. All  the widgets in this package subclass the A_CmsWidget class mentioned earlier. Often,  a new widget design may be subclassed from an existing widget.  Designing the Widget As mentioned earlier, we would like to have a widget that obtains its option data  values dynamically rather than from a fixed configuration string value. Rather than  create a widget very specific to our needs, we will use a flexible design where the  data source location can be specified in the configuration parameter. The design will  allow for other data sources to be plugged into the widget. This way, we can use a  single widget to obtain dynamic data from a variety of sources.  To support this design, we will use the configuration parameter to contain the name  of a Java class used as a data source. The design will specify a pluggable data source  through a Java interface that a data source must implement. Furthermore, a data  source can accept parameters via the widget configuration string.  With this design, an example declaration for a widget named  CustomSourceSelectWidget would look like this:  <layout element="Category"    widget="CustomSourceSelectWidget"    configuration="source='com.widgets.sources.MySource'       option1='some config param'       option2='another param'"  >  This declaration would appear in the schema of a content type, using the widget as  covered earlier. The configuration parameter consists of name value pairs, delimited  by the vertical bar character. Each name value pair is separated by the equal to sign  and the value is always enclosed in single quotes. The design requires that at least  the source parameter be specified. Additional parameters will depend upon the  specific data source being used.  The example declaration specifies that the data field named Category will use the  CustomSourceSelectWidget widget for its layout. The configuration parameter  contains the name of the Java class to be used to obtain the data source. The data  source will receive the two parameters named option1 and option2 along with their  values. Next, lets move on to the code to see how this all gets implemented.  [ 201 ]   Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget  The Widget Code By examining the existing OpenCms widget code base, we see that the widget can  be based on the SELECT widget, which is implemented by the CmsSelectWidget  class. Recall that the SELECT widget obtains its option values statically from the  configuration parameter. We will subclass the widget to modify its behavior, so  that it will get the data using the Java data source instead. This turns out to be quite  straightforward, requiring only a few method overrides:  public class CmsCustomSourceSelectWidget extends CmsSelectWidget {      ** The log object for this class. *      private static final Log LOG =                     CmsLog.getLog CmsCustomSourceSelectWidget.class ;      ** The list of select values *      private List m_selectOptions = null;      ** The widget data source *      I_WidgetSelectSource m_iDataSource = null;      ** The configuration options *      CustomSourceConfiguration m_config;     public CmsCustomSourceSelectWidget   {         super  ;     }     public I_CmsWidget newInstance   {           create a new widget using the config parameters        return new CmsCustomSourceSelectWidget  ;     }  The class starts with the default constructor and some member variables which we'll  discuss later on. The newInstance method is overridden to return an instance of the  widget. To manage the configuration information, the setConfiguration method  is overridden. This method gets called right after a widget has been constructed to  allow it to initialize. The method uses the data source to read the option data:  public void setConfiguration String configuration  {     super.setConfiguration configuration ;     if  m_iDataSource == null  {        m_config = new            CustomSourceConfiguration configuration ;        String strClassName =             options.getConfigValue "source" ;           read the class name for the data source            and instantiate it        Class sourceClazz;        try {            sourceClazz = Class.forName strClassName ;  [ 202 ]   Chapter 8             m_iDataSource =                 I_WidgetSelectSource sourceClazz.                      newInstance  ;        } catch  Exception e  {               Log the error            LOG.error Messages.get  .                getBundle  .key                    Messages.LOG_DATASOURCE_INIT_ERROR_2,                      strClassName , e ;                                since it failed use the                default source provider to be nice            m_iDataSource = new DefaultDS  ;        }           set the configuration        m_iDataSource.setConfiguration m_config ;    } }  After calling the base class, an instance of the CustomSourceConfiguration class  is created with the configuration data. The class is used to encapsulate the parsing  and formatting of configuration options. It also provides an easy way to retrieve the  configuration values:  public class CustomSourceConfiguration {    private static final Log LOG =                    CmsLog.getLog CustomSourceConfiguration.class ;     protected final static String OPTION_DELIMITER = "";     protected final static String OPTION_VALUE_BEGIN="='";     protected final static String OPTION_VALUE_END="'";      ** List of option values *      private Hashtable  m_htOptions;     public CustomSourceConfiguration String configuration  {        parseOptions configuration ;     }     private void parseOptions String config  {        m_htOptions = new Hashtable   ;        String [] aParms = CmsStringUtil.splitAsArray config,                                                OPTION_DELIMITER ;        for  int i=0; i<aParms.length; i++  {           boolean bBadParamFormat = false;              read the parameter name           String strParm = aParms[i];           int nParmNameBegin = 0;           int nParmNameEnd = strParm.indexOf OPTION_VALUE_BEGIN ;  [ 203 ]   Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget            if  -1 != nParmNameEnd  {                 parameter name              String strParmName = strParm.substring nParmNameBegin,                                                          nParmNameEnd ;                 parameter value              int nParmValueStart = nParmNameEnd +                                      OPTION_VALUE_BEGIN.length  ;              int nParmValueEnd = strParm.indexOf OPTION_VALUE_END,                                                      nParmValueStart ;              if  -1 != nParmValueEnd  {                 String strParmVal =                    strParm.substring nParmValueStart, nParmValueEnd ;                    add the param name-value pair                 m_htOptions.put strParmName, strParmVal ;              } else {              bBadParamFormat = true;              }           } else {              bBadParamFormat = true;           }           if  bBadParamFormat && LOG.isInfoEnabled    {              LOG.info Messages.get  .getBundle  .key                  Messages.ERR_MALFORMED_SELECT_OPTIONS_1, strParm  ;           }        }     }     public String getConfigValue String ConfigName  {        return  String  m_htOptions.get ConfigName ;     } }  Back in the setConfiguration method, the source parameter is obtained from the  configuration data. This value is then used to construct an instance of the data source  using Java reflection. In case of an error, it is logged to the console and a fallback  source is used. The fallback source returns the error message in the option value  to indicate that there was a configuration problem. After the data source has been  instantiated, the configuration information is passed to it. Note that the data source  must adhere to the I_WidgetSelectSource interface. We will describe that interface  later on.  [ 204 ]   The next method in the class is the getDialogWidget method. This method returns  the actual HTML for the widget:  Chapter 8  public String getDialogWidget CmsObject cms, I_CmsWidgetDialog                       widgetDialog, I_CmsWidgetParameter param  {        String id = param.getId  ;           build the SELECT HTML        StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer 16 ;        result.append "<td class=\"xmlTd\" style=\"height:                                25px;\"><select class=\"xmlInput" ;        if  param.hasError    {           result.append " xmlInputError" ;        }        result.append "\" name=\"" ;        result.append id ;        result.append "\" id=\"" ;        result.append id ;        result.append "\">" ;           read the option data values        getSelectOptionData cms ;           finish the HTML        if  null != m_selectOptions  {           String selected = getSelectedValue cms, param ;           Iterator i = m_selectOptions.iterator  ;           while  i.hasNext    {               SelectOptionValue option =  SelectOptionValue                                                          i.next  ;                  create the option               result.append "<option value=\"" ;               result.append option.getValue   ;               result.append "\"" ;               if   selected != null  &&                                selected.equals option.getValue     {                   result.append " selected=\"selected\"" ;               }               result.append ">" ;               result.append option.getName   ;               result.append " " ;           }         }         result.append " " ;         result.append " " ;         return result.toString  ;     }  [ 205 ]   Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget  The code was copied from the base CmsSelectWidget implementation as it is very  similar. After building the SELECT tag, the option values are read from the data  source. This is encapsulated in the getSelectOptionData method which places the  data list into a member variable. The option tags are then built from the data list.  The getSelectedValue method is used to retrieve the value of any previously  selected option value. This method is implemented by the base class, and does not  need to be changed.  While building the Option tags, the code looks for a current value and sets the  SELECTED attribute, if a match is found. This ensures the state of any previously  selected value. At the end of the class is the method used to obtain the option values  from the data source:  protected List getSelectOptionData CmsObject cms  {        set the configuration in the data source     m_iDataSource.setConfiguration m_config ;        read the option values        data values are not cached by default, but can be        cached by setting the configuration option         "cacheData='true'"     String strCache = m_config.getConfigValue "cacheData" ;     if  null!=strCache && strCache.equalsIgnoreCase "true"   {         if  m_selectOptions == null  {             m_selectOptions = m_iDataSource.getValues cms ;         }         return m_selectOptions;     } else {         return m_iDataSource.getValues cms ;     } }  The method first passes the configuration information to the data source to give it  a chance to initialize itself. It then reads the data from the data source. By default,  the data is read each time the method is called. But in some cases, this may be  time consuming. To speed this up, the method supports caching the result if the  cacheData option parameter is set.  That's it for the widget class. Next we'll go over the data source interface, which is  very straightforward.  [ 206 ]   Chapter 8  Custom Source Interface and Implementations The interface designed for data sources is quite simple, consisting of only   two methods:  public interface I_WidgetSelectSource {      **      * This method is called after the data source is     * constructed and before the option values are       * retrieved. It passes the configuration string to      * the widget.      *       * @param config String value of the configuration string      *      public void setConfiguration CustomSourceConfiguration config ;      **      * Returns a List of SelectOptionValue objects to be      * displayed in the SELECT list.     *      public List getValues CmsObject cms ; }  As seen in the widget code, the setConfiguration method is first called to give the  data source a chance to initialize and capture any configuration data. The getValues  method is then called to retrieve the option data. The option data must be returned  in a List of SelectOptionValue objects, which is a simple bean class containing  name value pairs used for the option tag.  Let's have a look at couple of data sources that implement this interface. First, there  is the DefaultDS class. This data source is used as a fallback in case the configured  one can not be instantiated:  public class DefaultDS implements I_WidgetSelectSource {     public DefaultDS   {     }     public List getValues CmsObject cms  {        ArrayList  aVals = new            ArrayList   ;        aVals.add new SelectOptionValue            Messages.get  .getBundle  .key            Messages.DEFAULT_DS_ERROR_MSG_0 , "null"  ;        return aVals;     }     public void setConfiguration CustomSourceConfiguration config  {           don't care     } }  [ 207 ]   Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget  The getValues method constructs an ArrayList and adds a single value to it. The  value is an error string indicating that the configuration has failed. The string is  retrieved using the OpenCms Messages class, which is discussed later on. The data  source doesn't use the configuration data. So, the setConfiguration method   is empty.  Now let's look at a more interesting data source. Recall that we would like the select  widget to retrieve values from some list that content editors can edit. A structured  content type is a perfect candidate for such a list. The valuelist content type will  allow many instances of data lists to be created:  <!-- ============================================================     XSD content definition file for the ValueList type  =============================================================== --> <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"        elementFormDefault="qualified">                                         <xsd:element name="ValueList" type="OpenCmsValueList"                            minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" >                                             <xsd:element name="Value" type="OpenCmsString"                            minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1000"  >                   <xsd:attribute name="language" type="OpenCmsLocale"                          use="optional" >          The content type has a single field named Value, and has an arbitrary upper limit of  1000 items. Recall from Chapter 3 that to install a content type the resourcetype and  explorertype entries need to be added to the opencms-modules.xml configuration  file. First is the resource type entry:        <type class="org.opencms.file.types.CmsResourceTypeXmlContent"           name="valuelist" id="3002">                             system modules com.deepthoughts.templates                 schemas valuelist.xsd                      [ 208 ]   Chapter 8  And then the explorer type entry:  <explorertype name="valuelist" key="fileicon.valuelist"       icon="xmlcontent.gif" reference="xmlcontent">     <newresource          uri="newresource_xmlcontent.jsp?              newresourcetype=valuelist" order="25"              autosetnavigation="false" autosettitle="false"              info="desc.valuelist" >           <accessentry principal="ROLE.WORKPLACE_USER"         permissions="+r+v+w+c" >          After adding the new content type, a new list can be created within the Workplace  Explorer. The list will maintain the Category values assigned to Blog entries and will  be placed somewhere that the content editors can access it.  The last thing needed is a data source that gets its option values from an instance of  this content type. Again, we will use a design that is more general in purpose rather  than specific. The data source class will be able to read values from any content type  that has repeating fields. This way it will not be limited to reading list values from  the ValueList content type. This will be done by using the configuration parameter  to instruct the data source how to get the values. The configuration string will need  to have these options:             source: This parameter is required for the widget. In this case it will contain  the name of the generic data source class. contenttype: This will contain the type of the structured content that data will  be obtained from. location: This will specify the location of the resource in the VFS. fieldname: This will contain the name of the field within the resource that  holds the data values. The data source will read all occurrences of this field  and return them as INPUT option values.  Now lets look at the code which implements this. The data source class is named  ContentFieldListDS:  public class ContentFieldListDS implements I_WidgetSelectSource {      ** The content type containing the list of values *      String m_strContentType;      ** VFS path to the instance of the resource *      String m_strLocation;  [ 209 ]   Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget       ** Name of the field within the resource *      String m_strFieldname;      **     * Public constructor needed     *      public ContentFieldListDS   {        m_strContentType = null;        m_strLocation = null;        m_strFieldname = null;     }  The member variables will contain the configuration data. They are initialized in the  constructor, and then set in the setConfiguration method:  public void setConfiguration CustomSourceConfiguration config  {        get the configuration options     m_strContentType = config.getConfigValue "contenttype" ;     m_strLocation = config.getConfigValue "location" ;     m_strFieldname = config.getConfigValue "fieldname" ; } private boolean isConfigValid   {     return m_strContentType != null &&         m_strLocation != null &&         m_strFieldname != null; }  A utility method is used to check the configuration parameters. Last is the  getValues method, where the content values are actually read from the data source:  public List getValues CmsObject cms  {     ArrayList  lstVals = new        ArrayList   ;     if  false == isConfigValid    {        lstVals.add new SelectOptionValue "Missing or invalid  configuration options!", "null"  ;     } else {           read the resource containing the values, in the specified             location        try {           CmsResource res = cms.readResource m_strLocation ;                 check it against the desired type              if  m_strContentType.equalsIgnoreCase                   OpenCms.getResourceManager  .                   getResourceType res .getTypeName     {                    retrieve the values  [ 210 ]   Chapter 8                  CmsXmlContent content =CmsXmlContentFactory.unmarshal                                              cms, cms.readFile res  ;                    using the specified fieldname                 List lVals = content.getValues m_strFieldname,                              cms.getRequestContext  .getLocale   ;             Iterator j = lVals.iterator  ;             while  j.hasNext    {                 I_CmsXmlContentValue iVal =                                    I_CmsXmlContentValue j.next  ;                    add the value                 lstVals.add new SelectOptionValue                   iVal.getStringValue cms  iVal.getStringValue cms   ;             }             } else {                 lstVals.add new SelectOptionValue "Specified resource                               " + m_strLocation + "  is not of type:" +                             m_strContentType, "null"  ;             }         } catch  CmsException e  {                return the error in the list to be nice             lstVals.add new SelectOptionValue "Error reading " +                       m_strLocation + ": " + e.getMessage  , "null"  ;         }     }     return lstVals; }  The method begins by allocating a list to contain the returned values. If the  configuration values cannot be set properly, then an error return message is returned  in the list. Otherwise, the routine reads the configured CmsResource. Another  validation check is done to insure that the content type of the resource matches the  configured one. Again, an error message is returned if this is not the case.  After the validation check, the resource is read and unmarshalled. This converts  its XML representation into a CmsXmlContent instance. After this is done,  the configured content fields are read into an array and then converted into  SelectOptionValue instances. For safety, the entire effort is surrounded with a  catch block which returns any caught errors. The error messages have not been  externalized as done in the earlier class. This exercise will be left to the reader. But  first we will cover the Messages class used for doing this.  [ 211 ]   Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget Using OpenCms Message Strings for Localization OpenCms provides full support for localization. In the earlier chapters, we discussed  the use of the messages.properties file to contain user interface strings. The  property values can also be used to localize message strings in Java classes. The   I_CmsMessageBundle interface provides the support for this. The interface can be a  bit confusing at first, but fortunately, most of the methods are already implemented  in the A_CmsMessageBundle class. To support localized strings in our own classes,  we just need to provide a subclass of the A_CmsMessageBundle class. Each Java  package can have its own messages.properties file with a corresponding Java  class. The convention is to name the class Messages. Let's take a look at the one used  by the widgets:  public final class Messages extends A_CmsMessageBundle {      ** Name of the used resource bundle. *      private static final String BUNDLE_NAME =         "com.deepthoughts.widgets.messages";      ** Static instance member. *      private static final I_CmsMessageBundle INSTANCE = new                                                      Messages  ;      **     * Hides the public constructor for this utility class.      *      private Messages   {           hide the constructor     }      **     * Returns an instance of this localized message accessor.      *      * @return an instance of this localized message accessor     *      public static I_CmsMessageBundle get   {        return INSTANCE;     }      **     * Returns the bundle name for this OpenCms package.      *      * @return the bundle name for this OpenCms package     *      public String getBundleName   {        return BUNDLE_NAME;     }      ** Message constants for key in the resource bundle. *      public static final String LOG_DATASOURCE_INIT_ERROR_2 =         "LOG_DATASOURCE_INIT_ERROR_2";     public static String DEFAULT_DS_ERROR_MSG_0 =        "DEFAULT_DS_ERROR_MSG_0"; }  [ 212 ]   Chapter 8  A static declaration containing the name of the bundle appears first. The name will  always match the package that the Java class is in. Next, is the static declaration  and instantiation of the class. There needs to be only one instance of the class, as  messages are a read-only resource. To further ensure that only one instance of the  class is created, the default constructor is declared private. The next two methods  return the class instance and the name of the bundle respectively.   Last in the class is the list of localized messages. The convention used to format  the messages is to declare the message name as a string constant and to have the  message value match the constant name. A localized message can then be retrieved  through its message constant value, for example:  String msg = Messages.get  .getBundle  .                           key Messages.DEFAULT_DS_ERROR_MSG_0   Looking at the variations of the key method on the I_CmsMessageBundle interface,  we see that it supports the ability to parameterize the message string with up to three  values. The convention used to format message keys is to append a numeral at the  end, indicating the number of parameters in the message. This was done in the error  handling of the widget's setConfiguration method to return the name of the class  and the exception message:  Messages.get  .getBundle  . key Messages.LOG_DATASOURCE_INIT_ERROR_2, strClassName , e ;  Relating message constant values to the message strings in the messages. properties file is easy. Each entry in the properties file is named according to the  string value of the message constant:   messages.properties for widget DEFAULT_DS_ERROR_MSG_0          =   Missing or incorrectly configured option value - please fix LOG_DATASOURCE_INIT_ERROR_2     =   Error instantiating DataSource object of class "{0}" - "{1}"  Parameterized messages are formatted using numbered macro placeholders, as  shown previously.  Registering the Widget with OpenCms The last step in creating the widget is to register it with OpenCms. Widgets are  registered in the XML file located in the configuration directory:   \WEB-INF\config\opencms-vfs.xml  [ 213 ]   Extending OpenCms: Developing a Custom Widget  To add the widget, locate the   section and add the widget definition:    <widget   class="com.deepthoughts.widgets.CmsCustomSourceSelectWidget"   alias="CustomSourceSelectWidget"  >  The class parameter contains the fully qualified class name of the widget. The alias is  the name that will be used in the layout declaration of a schema file using the widget.  Any changes made to the file will require a restart of OpenCms to take effect.  After compiling the code, deploying the class files and registering the widget it can  finally be used. Here is an example of what a schema file using the widget will   look like:  <layout     element="Category"    widget="CustomSourceSelectWidget"    configuration=     "source='com.deepthoughts.widgets.sources.ContentListDS'      contenttype='ValueList'      location=' Blogs BlogCategories'      fieldname='Category'"  >  The layout goes into the blogentry.xsd file we had created in Chapter 3. The  declaration specifies that the Category field uses the CustomSourceSelectWidget  widget. The ContentListDS class is specified as the data source and it uses a content  type of ValueList. The resource instance of the ValueList content type is located at   Blogs BlogCategories and the field within the content type containing the values  is named Category. After making these changes to the schema file, the content editor  will have a pull-down that obtains the values dynamically.  Summary In this chapter, we talked about how to create a custom widget. We first covered  the interfaces necessary to implement a widget and then went through the design  of a widget for the blog content. After that, we went over the widget code and how  to register a widget with OpenCms. Although the widget we developed is used to  retrieve category values from a list, we've designed it to have broader use. It's an  easy matter to configure the widget to read from a different resource containing  different values or a different resource type altogether. The widget design allows for  other data sources to be configured. In the next chapter, we will do this very thing  and add another data source for the widget.  [ 214 ]        Extending OpenCms:   Adding RSS Feed Support  In Chapter 7, we showed how to support incoming RSS feeds by integrating ROME.  In this chapter, we will continue to extend the base OpenCms feature set by adding  support for RSS feeds. To accomplish this, we will build upon our previous work,  doing the following things:           Create a new module to contain the RSS feed support. Create a new structured content type for feeds. Add a new data source for the custom widget built in Chapter 8. Create some templates to deliver the RSS content.  At the end of the chapter, we will have a new module that will contain the ability  to create an RSS feed from any content type within OpenCms. We will then use the  module to deliver the RSS feeds for our blog content.  RSS Feed Design Let's start out by discussing the approach we will take to support RSS feeds.  Although our immediate need is to create RSS feeds for the blog content, there  are lots of other content types we may want to create RSS feeds for in the future.  Rather than build a one‑time solution specific to the blog site, we will take a generic  approach to allow feeds to be defined by any structured content type. The new  content type will contain metadata that defines the RSS feed. The required fields for  an RSS channel can be found by looking at the RSS specification, which is located  at: http:  www.rss-specifications.com . To support the RSS feeds, we expand  upon the use of the ROME library introduced in Chapter 7. After looking at the  specification and the ROME library, the design for the RSS Channel Definition  content type looks like this:   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support  RSS Channel Definition Feed Title Feed Description Copyright  optional  Author  optional  Publication Date  optional  Image  optional  Image Title  optional  Nested RSS Channel Source s   RSS Channel Source Source Content Type Source Location Max Feed Items RSS Title Field Mapping RSS Description Field Mapping RSS Author Field Mapping  It includes the required RSS feed fields and some optional feed fields that we've  opted to support. At the end of the content type there is a nested content definition  which will define the VFS resources to be used as RSS feed items. The channel  definition will allow for multiple VFS sources to be included in the RSS channel.  Each nested RSS channel source definition has these fields:  The first three fields are straightforward and describe the content type, its location  in the VFS, and the maximum number of items to include. The remaining fields map  the source content to each RSS field.   To allow any structured content type to be used as a feed source, there needs to be  a way to map the source content item to a RSS field. The source content data fields  can generally be lumped into three categories: metadata fields, property values,  and content fields. Meta fields are accessible through the Java API and are partially  exposed in the Workplace Explorer. These fields include:            User Created: Name of the user that created the content item. User Last Modified: Name of the user who last modified the content item. Date Content: Contains the last modification date for the content item.  This date applies to changes made to the content of the item, rather than its  properties. If only properties are modified, then this value is not updated. Date Created: Contains the creation date for the content item.  [ 216 ]   Chapter 9          Date Expired: Contains the expiration date for the content item. Date Last Modified: Contains the last modification date for the content item.  This value is updated when any change is made to the content, including just  property value changes. Date Released: Contains the release date for the content item.  Property values come directly from global property definitions and are also available  for inspection through the Workplace Explorer. The final category is the content  fields, which only apply to structured content.  To allow the field values to be mapped, we will use a prefix to define the field source.  For example, to map to a metadata field, the meta prefix will be used:  meta.UserCreated meta.UserLastModified meta.DateContent meta.DateCreated meta.DateExpired meta.DateLastModified meta.DateReleased  property.NavText  Property.NavText+  field.BlogText  field.BlogText[200]  Likewise, the property value is mapped using the property prefix, followed by the  name of the property:  Since properties values may be inherited from a parent folder, the + sign may be  added to search for the property value on the parent:  Finally, the content fields are mapped using the field prefix. This is also followed  by the name of the content field to be retrieved. For example:  As RSS items are usually displayed as teasers, we will allow the field length to be  limited by adding an additional size qualifier:  Additionally, the method used to trim the size may be controlled by adding a + or  – to the end of the size qualifier. The indicator is used to prevent trimming in the  middle of text by seeking the next logical break, in a forward or backward direction.  This example would trim the field to 200 characters moving upward to the next   word break:  field.BlogText[200+]  [ 217 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support  And this example would trim to 150 characters, trimming downward to the previous  word break:  field.BlogText[150-]  Now that the design is all worked out, lets move on to writing the code.  The RSS Feed Content Type The RssChannelDef structured content type will be used to contain the feed  definition. The new type will be added to the com.deepthoughts.rss module that  we had created in Chapter 7. When creating the file, remember that the XSD schema  file for the content type must go into the schemas folder:  XSD file to define an RSS channel -->  <!--  <xsd:schema xmlns:xsd="http:  www.w3.org 2001 XMLSchema"               elementFormDefault="qualified">           <xsd:include schemaLocation="opencms:  system modules                    com.deepthoughts.rss schemas rsschannelsrc.xsd" >                             <xsd:element name="RSSChannelDef" type="OpenCmsRSSChannelDef"                        minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" >                                                          <xsd:element name="Title" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="Description" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >                       <xsd:element name="Copyright" type="OpenCmsString"                         minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="Author" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="PublishDate" type="OpenCmsDateTime"                         minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="Image" type="OpenCmsVfsFile"                          minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="ImageTitle" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1"  >  [ 218 ]   Chapter 9            <xsd:element name="divider" type="OpenCmsString"                         minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >                       <xsd:element name="ChannelSource"                          type="OpenCmsRssChannelSrc".minOccurs="1"                          maxOccurs="25"  >                 <xsd:attribute name="language" type="OpenCmsLocale"                         use="optional" >        By now, the XSD schema file should look familiar. So let's skip down to the data  fields in the top half of the file, which map directly to the design. The last data field  contains the nested RssChannelSrc content type. This is used to define the RSS item  sources, which we'll go over next. But first, let's look at the annotations section:                           <!-- Mappings allow data fields to be mapped to content               properties -->                                                        <mapping element="PublishDate"                         mapto="attribute:datereleased"  >                                                                 <default element="divider" value="&lt;div                         style='background:f0f0f0; border:solid 1px                         grey; border-radius: 1em; padding: 2px; font-                        family:Segoe UI,trebuchet ms,arial,sans-                        serif,tahoma,verdana; '&gt;                &lt;b&gt;For RSS Title and Description Field Mappings,                  use this syntax:&lt; b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt;              To map to meta-value use:                &lt;b&gt;meta.metaname&lt; b&gt;&lt;br&gt;                 where metaname is one of the following: UserCreated,                   UserLastModified,&lt;br&gt;                 DateContent, DateCreated, DateExpired,                   DateLastModified, DateReleased&lt;br&gt;                 To map to a property value use:                   &lt;b&gt;property.propertyname+&lt; b&gt;&lt;br&gt;                 where propertyname is any valid property&lt;br&gt;                  adding the optional plus sign at the end will search                    the parent &lt;br&gt;  [ 219 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support               To map to content field use:                &lt;b&gt;field.fieldname[size+-]&lt; b&gt;&lt;br&gt;                 where fieldname is the name of the content                   field&lt;br&gt;                 adding the optional size will truncate the size in                   the feed listing &lt;br&gt;                 use + to truncate up to the next period or                   end&lt;br&gt;                 or use - to truncate down&lt; pre&gt;&lt; div&gt;" >                                                                                                                                            <layout element="SourceContentType"                        widget="CustomSourceSelectWidget"                configuration="source='com.deepthoughts.widgets.                   sources.ContentTypesDS'exclude='rsschanneldef'" >                          <layout element="SourceAuthorField"                        widget="SelectorWidget"                configuration="meta.UserCreated:Use Created By                    Fieldmeta.UserLastModified:Use Updated By Field" >                                                                               Here we see that the Title and the Description fields are mapped to their  respective resource properties, and the PublishDate field is mapped to the  datereleased attribute.  Next is the defaults section, containing initial values for some of the fields. First  is the PublishDate, which is populated with the current time. Following this is a  default value for the divider field. In the content editing form, this field can be used  as a visual divider between the channel definition and channel source fields. Because  the mapping syntax is difficult to remember, we will use a read‑only field to contain   [ 220 ]   the instructional text for the mapping fields. It is possible to use HTML in this field  as long as valid XML is used. This means that XML entities must be used for any  HTML brackets, as shown.  Finally, contained in the layouts section are the widgets used for editing the   content fields.   Chapter 9  The read-only DisplayWidget is used to display the divider field.  Now let's return to the nested RssChannelSrc content field. The data field  definitions for that content type look like:                                                     <xsd:element name="SourceContentType"                     type="OpenCmsString".minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >                       <xsd:element name="SourceLocation" type="OpenCmsVfsFile"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >                       <xsd:element name="FeedLimit".type="OpenCmsString"                         minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >                       <xsd:element name="SourceTitleField" type="OpenCmsString"                          minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="SourceDescField" type="OpenCmsString"                         minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >           <xsd:element name="SourceAuthorField".type="OpenCmsString"                         minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"  >                 <xsd:attribute name="language" type="OpenCmsLocale"                         use="optional" >        [ 221 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support  Like its parent type, each field is mapped directly from the design. After creating the  schema files and registering the new content type, as we had done in Chapter 3 for  the Blog type, we can create new RSS Channel Definitions:  In the middle of the form is the clear instructional text followed by the content source  definition instances. However, the form is not so good because the user needs to  know the OpenCms name of the content type. We can improve the form by adding a  widget which makes the content type selection easier.  One way to do this is to use a vanilla CmsSelect widget with a list of content  types in the configuration string. The drawback to this approach is that if a new  content type is introduced, the configuration string needs to be updated. A better  approach is to build the list dynamically, which we can do by leveraging the  CustomSourceSelectWidget from Chapter 8.  [ 222 ]   Creating a Supporting Widget The new widget will use the framework created in Chapter 8 by defining a new data  source. The data source will read the content types registered with OpenCms for  presentation into a selection box. Recall that the framework allows new data sources  to be added through implementing the I_WidgetSelectSource interface:  Chapter 9  public class ContentTypesDS implements I_WidgetSelectSource {      ** xmlpage content type *      protected static final String XMLPAGE = "xmlpage";      ** List of exclusions *      Hashtable  m_htExclusions;     public ContentTypesDS   {        m_htExclusions = new Hashtable   ;     }  The class constructor allocates a list, which will be used for exclusions. The list of  exclusions is obtained from the configuration string in the widget declaration, and  contains content types that should not be included. This provides better control over  the selection of content types.  The class file also has a constant for the xmlpage content type. The constant contains  the name of the XML Page resource type and is used to handle a special case when  obtaining the list of content types within the getValues method:  public List getValues CmsObject cms  {        list of return values     ArrayList  aVals = new                                    ArrayList   ;        get the message bundle for the workplace manager    CmsMessages wpMessages = OpenCms.getWorkplaceManager  .getMessages                                 CmsLocaleManager.getDefaultLocale   ;        The XML Page is structured content, but is not 'derived' from          xmlcontent, so we special case it     if  null == m_htExclusions.get XMLPAGE   {        Only add it if it hasn't been excluded     aVals.add new SelectOptionValue wpMessages.key                                   "fileicon.xmlpage" , XMLPAGE  ; }        get a list of all configured resource types from the explorer          config file     Iterator i = OpenCms.getWorkplaceManager  .                               getExplorerTypeSettings  .iterator  ; while  i.hasNext    {     CmsExplorerTypeSettings settings =                                  CmsExplorerTypeSettings i.next  ;  [ 223 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support         look for structured content types     String strRef = settings.getReference  ;     if  CmsStringUtil.isNotEmpty strRef   {                we only care about structured content types  types                  that have a reference to 'xmlcontent'              if  strRef.equals "xmlcontent"   {                and that can be created in the UI               if  CmsStringUtil.isEmpty                                 settings.getNewResourceUri     {                  no 'new resource' URI specified, don't allow it                continue;               }                  don't add if it is excluded               if  null == m_htExclusions.get settings.getName     {                  add found setting to list               aVals.add new SelectOptionValue wpMessages.key                             settings.getKey   , settings.getName    ;               }             }     }   } return aVals; }  The method starts by using the OpenCmsWorkplaceManager class to retrieve its  message bundle. Recall from Chapter 8 how a message bundle was created for the  widget module. In this case, however, a message bundle from another package is  being used. The bundle is later used to obtain the human readable names of the  structured content types.  Next, the method adds the XML Page type to the return list if it has not been  excluded. This type is used to handle a special case and is described in more  detail in a bit. The remaining structured content types are obtained by using the  CmsWorkplaceManager class to retrieve a list of resource types. This class manages  the settings pertaining to the OpenCms Workplace Explorer. The settings include the  resource type definitions contained in the opencms-vfs.xml and opencms-modules. xml configuration files.  From here, it is a simple matter of finding all types that reference the xmlcontent  type. Recall from Chapter 3 that all structured content types are derived from  this base type. The one exception to this is the XML Page content type which is a  structured type not derived from xmlcontent. This type is included as it is very  likely that RSS feeds will come from instances of this content type. Finally in the  code, we see how the message bundle is used to convert the content type name to its  human readable counterpart.  [ 224 ]   Chapter 9  The setConfiguration method completes the data source definition:  public void setConfiguration CustomSourceConfiguration config  {        read the list of exclusions     String strExclusions = config.getConfigValue "exclude" ;     if  null != strExclusions  {        String[] parts = CmsStringUtil.splitAsArray strExclusions,                                                                 "," ;        for  int i = 0; i < parts.length; i++  {           String part = parts[i].trim  ;           if  part.length   == 0  {                 skip empty parts              continue;           }                 add the type to the list              m_htExclusions.put part, part ;         }     } }  Here, the configuration string is parsed, and any content type that should be  excluded is determined.  Going back to the content type definition, we see how the widget is declared in the  layouts section.              <layout element="SourceContentType"             widget="CustomSourceSelectWidget"             configuration= "source='com.deepthoughts.widgets.                   sources.ContentTypesDS'exclude='rsschanneldef'" >           <layout element="SourceAuthorField"              widget="SelectorWidget"              configuration="meta.UserCreated:Use Created By                   Fieldmeta.UserLastModified:Use Updated By Field" >    [ 225 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support  To make the form friendlier, a layout is also used for the SourceAuthorfield. The  resulting dialog is now easier to use:  The source content type field automatically contains a list of available structured  resource types, and will be updated whenever a new type is added to the system.  The RSS Feed Template and Java Classes Now that RSS Channel Definitions can be created, the next step is to generate the  RSS. A template is used for this, and the template-elements property of RSS  content instances is used to specify it. As usual, the template goes into the templates  folder of a module. Here is what the template code looks like:     <%        instantiate the RSS bean and get the feed     RssFeedBean rss = new RssFeedBean pageContext, request,                                                       response ;      rss.getFeed  ; %>  [ 226 ]   Chapter 9  There is not much to it as all the work is done in the RssFeedBean Java class:   public class RssFeedBean extends CmsJspActionElement {      ** URL parameter to specify the RSS feed format *      public static final String PARAM_FEED_FORMAT = "fmt";      ** the VFS path to the RssChannelDef instance *      protected String m_strChannel;      ** POJO to represent the channel definition *      protected RssChannelDef m_rssChannelDef;      ** Current feed format  defaults to RSS 2.0  *      protected String m_strFormat = "rss_2.0";      **     * Empty constructor, required for every JavaBean.     *      public RssFeedBean   {        super  ;     }     public RssFeedBean PageContext context,            HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res  {        super context, req, res ;        m_strChannel =                     getCmsObject  .getRequestContext  .getUri  ;         String strFormat = req.getParameter PARAM_FEED_FORMAT ;         if  !StringUtils.isNull strFormat   {           m_strFormat = strFormat;         }     }  The bean subclasses the familiar CmsJspActionElement bean used in the template  code. After some constants and a default constructor there is a constructor for the  servlet parameters. Since the bean is used in a template, the request URI will contain  the path to the RSS Channel Definition content item that was clicked on. This path is  saved into a class variable in the constructor. Since ROME supports a wide variety of  feed formats, each one is supported through the use of a URL parameter. If present,  the fmt parameter may be used to override the default 2.0 RSS feed format. The  formats currently supported by ROME are:                   rss_0.9 rss_0.92 rss_0.93 rss_0.94 rss_1.0 rss_2.0 atom_0.3 atom_1.0   [ 227 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support  Changing the feed format is a simple matter of setting the URL parameter. After the  bean is constructed, the template calls a single method to return the RSS feed:   public void getFeed   throws JspException {     try {        m_rssChannelDef = new RssChannelDef getCmsObject  ,                                                 m_strChannel ;           build the feed header     SyndFeed rssFeed = new SyndFeedImpl  ;     rssFeed.setFeedType m_strFormat ;        Title     rssFeed.setTitle m_rssChannelDef.getFeedTitle   ;        Link URL     String strLink = m_strChannel + "?" + PARAM_FEED_FORMAT + "=" +                                                           m_strFormat;     rssFeed.setLink link strLink  ;        Description     rssFeed.setDescription m_rssChannelDef.getFeedDescription   ;        Channel Published Date     rssFeed.setPublishedDate new Date                           m_rssChannelDef.getPublishedDate    ;        locale     rssFeed.setLanguage getLocale  .toString   ;        Handle optional Fields        Image     String strVal = m_rssChannelDef.getFeedImage  ;     if  !StringUtils.isNull strVal   {               SyndImage img = new SyndImageImpl  ;               img.setUrl link strVal  ;               img.setLink link strLink  ;               strVal = m_rssChannelDef.getFeedImageTitle  ;               if  !StringUtils.isNull strVal   {                  img.setTitle strVal ;               }               rssFeed.setImage img ;     }        Copyright     strVal = m_rssChannelDef.getFeedCopyright  ;     if  !StringUtils.isNull strVal   {        rssFeed.setCopyright strVal ;     }        Author     strVal = m_rssChannelDef.getAuthor  ;     if  !StringUtils.isNull strVal   {        rssFeed.setAuthor strVal ;  [ 228 ]   Chapter 9      }        get the entries for the feed     rssFeed.setEntries getFeedEntries   ;        write the output        try {              SyndFeedOutput feedOutput = new SyndFeedOutput  ;              feedOutput.output rssFeed, getResponse  .getWriter   ;        } catch  IOException e  {           throw new JspException e ;        } catch  FeedException e  {           throw new JspException e ;        }     } catch  CmsException e  {        throw new JspException e ;     } }  The bulk of the method deals with the ROME library, which is well documented, and  hence is not covered here. The key components of the class lie in the construction  of the RssChannelDef object, and the population of the feed entries by using the  getFeedEntries method. The RssChannelDef object is a Java class, which wraps  the corresponding structured content instance. Though it is not necessary to create  a corresponding Java class for new content types, it can make them easier to work  with. We'll see the wrapper class later on, but for now, let's look at the method that  retrieves the feed entries:  protected List getFeedEntries   throws CmsLoaderException {    now build the feed items List  entries = new ArrayList   ;    get the list of content sources RssChannelSrc[] sources = m_rssChannelDef.getFeedSources  ;    build items from each source for  int i=0; i<sources.length; i++  {     String strType = sources[i].getSourceContentType  ;     int nResType = OpenCms.getResourceManager  .getResourceType                                               strType .getTypeId  ;        this is the filter to use when reading the resource from the         specified source        a future enhancement would be to allow the filter to be a         parameter     CmsResourceFilter filter = CmsResourceFilter.DEFAULT.     addRequireType nResType .addExcludeFlags                                CmsResource.FLAG_TEMPFILE ;     String strPath = sources[i].getRssItemSource  ;        in each location, read all the resources of the given type  [ 229 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support         try {              see if there is a limit specified for this channel               source           int nLimit = sources[i].getSourceItemLimit  ;              read all the resources on the given path using the               filter           List lstRssItems = getCmsObject  .readResources strPath,                                                               filter ;           Iterator iterRss = lstRssItems.iterator  ;           int nItem = 0;           while  iterRss.hasNext    {                if  nLimit > 0 && ++nItem > nLimit  {                   limit reached                break;                }              CmsResource res =  CmsResource  iterRss.next  ;                 convert the resource to the RSS item entry              entries.add getEntryFromResource sources[i], res  ;           }        } catch  CmsException e  {              TODO Auto-generated catch block           e.printStackTrace  ;        } }    return the RSS items return entries; }  After allocating an array to contain the returned items, the method gets a list of  sources from the RssChannelDef object instance. Like the RssChannelDef, there is  an RssChannelSrc wrapper class used to contain the RSS channel sources. The list of  sources is then iterated over and converted to an RSS item.  Within the loop, each channel source is used to determine the location and the  resource type to read the content from. The CmsResourceFilter class is used to  specify how resources are read within each location. An improvement on the design  would allow for each channel source to specify a filter. This is an exercise left to   the reader.  Next, the resources are read and converted to RSS feed items, honoring any size  limits that may have been set for the channel source. The last part of converting the  resource to an RSS feed item is handled by the getEntryFromResource method:  protected SyndEntry getEntryFromResource RssChannelSrc src,  CmsResource res  {        create the new entry  [ 230 ]   Chapter 9      SyndEntry entry = new SyndEntryImpl  ;           Entry Title        entry.setTitle src.getRssItemTitle res  ;           Entry Link        entry.setLink link getCmsObject  .getSitePath res   ;           Entry Published Date        entry.setPublishedDate new Date                             m_rssChannelDef.getPublishedDate    ;           Entry Updated Date        entry.setUpdatedDate new Date res.getDateContent    ;           Entry Description     SyndContent description = new SyndContentImpl  ;        description.setType "text plain" ;        description.setValue src.getRssItemDescription res  ;     entry.setDescription description ;           Entry Author        entry.setAuthor src.getRssItemAuthor res  ; return entry; }  The code is very straightforward, again using the ROME library to set the RSS  item attributes. We can see how using the RssChannelSrc wrapper object to access  content fields has made the method simple. Now, we can take a look at the two  content wrapper classes.  Content Wrapper Java Classes We've already seen how OpenCms makes it easy to create new structured content  types and also provides a Java API to access the XML data in those content types.  Sometimes, it is easier to create a Java wrapper class for the data types rather than  use the XML API everywhere. The RssChannelDef class has been created to make it  simpler to access the content within the RSS content type :  public class RssChannelDef {      ** The resource type id for the RSSChannelDef type *      public static final int RSSCHANNELDEF_TYPEID = 3001;     public static final String FIELD_CHANNELSOURCE = "ChannelSource";       ** CmsObject *      protected CmsObject m_cms;      ** The CmsResource containing the rsschanneldef *      protected CmsResource m_res;      ** The un-marshalled rsschanneldef instance *      protected I_CmsXmlDocument m_iDoc;      ** contains the Rss Channel Sources *   [ 231 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support      private RssChannelSrc[] m_contentSources;   ** data fields *   private String m_title;  private String m_Description;  private String m_Copyright;  private String m_Author;  private String m_Image;  private String m_ImageTitle;  private long m_PublishedDate;     public RssChannelDef CmsObject cms  {        m_cms = cms;     }     public RssChannelDef CmsObject cms, CmsResource res  throws                                                     CmsException {        initFromResource cms, res ;     }     public RssChannelDef CmsObject cms, String Path  throws                                                  CmsException {        initFromResource cms, cms.readResource Path  ;     }     private void initFromResource CmsObject cms, CmsResource res                                                  throws CmsException {        m_cms = cms;        m_res = res;           sanity check - make sure it is an rss channel definition        if  m_res.getTypeId   != RSSCHANNELDEF_TYPEID  {             throw new CmsException Messages.get  .container                   Messages.ERR_RESOURCE_NOT_RSS_1, res.getName    ;        }           populate the fields        m_title = getField "Title" ;        m_Description = getField "Description" ;        m_Copyright = getField "Copyright" ;        m_Author = getField "Author" ;        m_Image = getField "Image" ;        m_ImageTitle = getField "ImageTitle" ;        m_PublishedDate = m_res.getDateReleased  ;           read the definition and parse it        CmsFile rssDef = getCmsObject  .readFile m_res ;        m_iDoc = CmsXmlContentFactory.unmarshal                                  getCmsObject  , rssDef ;           read the list of sources        int nSources = m_iDoc.getValues                   FIELD_CHANNELSOURCE, getLocale   .size  ;        m_contentSources = new RssChannelSrc[nSources];  [ 232 ]   Chapter 9         for  int i = 0; i < nSources; i++  {             String basePath = CmsXmlUtils.createXpath                                 FIELD_CHANNELSOURCE, i+1 ;           m_contentSources[i] = new RssChannelSrc                            getCmsObject  , m_iDoc, basePath ;          }     }  The interesting part of the class starts with the initFromResource method. The  method first ensures that the resource this class is constructed from, is indeed the  correct content type. It then un-marshals, or parses, the resource content and saves  it to a member variable. Later on, the member variable will be used to retrieve the  content data fields. The method ends by creating an array of RssChannelSrc objects  from the nested content.  The remainder of the class code consists of getter and setter methods, which  is typical of a Java bean. The data field values are initially populated using the  getField method:  private String getField String FieldName  {     I_CmsXmlContentValue xml = m_iDoc.getValue FieldName,                                                 getLocale   ;     if  xml!= null  {        return xml.getStringValue getCmsObject   ;     }     return null; }  Creating a bean wrapper class for XML content types can be useful in other  situations as well. In the next chapter, we'll show how using a wrapper class makes it  easier to access XML content types in an administration dialog screen.  The RssChannelSrc wrapper class is similar but slightly different because it is a  nested content type. The class also provides support for handling the field mapping  syntax defined earlier:  public class RssChannelSrc {      ** Date Format String *      private static final DateFormat DATE_PARSER = new                               SimpleDateFormat "yyyy-MM-dd" ;      ** CmsObject *      CmsObject m_cms;      ** un-marshalled document *      I_CmsXmlDocument m_iDoc;      ** XML path to this nested content *      String m_basePath;      ** data fields *   [ 233 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support      private String m_sourceContentType;     private String m_sourceLocation;     private String m_sourceTitleField;     private String m_sourceDescField;     private String m_sourceAuthorField;     private String m_feedLimit;     public final static String META_META = "meta.";     public final static String META_PROPERTY = "property.";     public final static String META_FIELD = "field.";     public static final int DEFAULT_FEED_LIMIT = -1;     public RssChannelSrc CmsObject cms, I_CmsXmlDocument                                            Doc, String Path  {        m_cms = cms;        m_iDoc = Doc;        m_basePath = Path;        m_sourceContentType = getField "SourceContentType" ;        m_sourceLocation = getField "SourceLocation" ;        m_sourceTitleField = getField "SourceTitleField" ;        m_sourceDescField = getField "SourceDescField" ;        m_sourceAuthorField = getField "SourceAuthorField" ;        m_feedLimit = getField "FeedLimit" ; }  The constructor for the wrapper just saves the passed parameters for use later on and  then initializes the data fields. The getField method implementation for this class  differs slightly from the RssChannelDef method:  private String getField String FieldName  { try {        return m_iDoc.getStringValue m_cms, CmsXmlUtils.concatXpath                                 m_basePath, FieldName , getLocale   ;     } catch  CmsXmlException e  {        return StringUtils.NULLSTR;     } }  Since this class represents a nested content item, the path to each field must  contain the path from the parent content item. The parent name defined on the  RssChannelDef content type is ChannelSource, so the path looks something   like this:  ChannelSource[1] SourceContentType  [ 234 ]   The index value indicates the positional instance of the channel source within the  parent. Each instance will have its own index.  Finally, to handle the mapped content fields like the RSS item title, the  getMappedfieldValue method is used:  Chapter 9  public String getRssItemTitle CmsResource res  {     return getMappedFieldValue res,                                 getField "SourceTitleField"  ; } protected String getMappedFieldValue CmsResource res, String  FieldName  { String strField;     try {        if  0 == FieldName.indexOf META_META   {           strField = FieldName.substring META_META.length   ;           return getMetaField res, strField ;        } else if  0 == FieldName.indexOf META_PROPERTY   {              mapped to a property, values are read as specified           strField =              FieldName.substring META_PROPERTY.length   ;           CmsProperty prop =               getCmsObject  .readPropertyObject res, strField, false ;           return prop.getValue  ;        } else if  0 == FieldName.indexOf META_FIELD   {              mapped to a field, values are read as specified           strField = FieldName.substring META_FIELD.length   ;           return getContentField res, strField ;        }     } catch  CmsException e  {        return e.getMessage  ;     } return StringUtils.NULLSTR; }  This method parses the field specifier according to the input syntax and then  retrieves its value accordingly.  The remaining class methods are related to string parsing of meta‑field values and  are hence not discussed in detail. The source code can be examined to get a better  understanding of the remaining methods.  [ 235 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support  Wrapping It Up At last we are done! The site blog content can now be easily served up as an RSS  feed by creating an instance of an RSS Channel Definition somewhere. The RSS feed  support we added is generic, supporting many content types.To create a feed from  the blog content, the channel definition entry fields looks like this:  The channel definition can go into the  Blogs  folder:  [ 236 ]   To complete the site template, we just need to add a link to the channel definition file  in the template code. For each RSS format we want to support, we just need to add  a URL parameter with the format.  The rss_feed element in the common.jsp file is  where the change is made:  Chapter 9                    Subscribe                                             <a type="application rss+xml"                  rel="alternate"                  title="Subscribe to my feed"                  href="  Blogs DeepThoughts.rss?fmt=rss_0.9                         "><img style="border: 0pt none ;"                  alt="RSS 0.9"                  src="  images xml.gif ">                  &nbsp;RSS 0.9 Feed                                       <a type="application rss+xml"                  rel="alternate"                  title="Subscribe to my feed"                  href="  Blogs DeepThoughts.rss?fmt=rss_1.0                         "><img style="border: 0pt none ;"                  alt="RSS 1.0"                  src="  images xml.gif ">                  &nbsp;RSS 1.0 Feed                                       <a type="application rss+xml"                  rel="alternate"                  title="Subscribe to my feed"                  href="  Blogs DeepThoughts.rss ">                        <img style="border: 0pt none ;"                  alt="RSS 2.0"                  src="  images xml.gif ">                  &nbsp;RSS 2.0 Feed                                       <a type="application rss+xml"   [ 237 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding RSS Feed Support                  rel="alternate"                  title="Subscribe to my feed"                  href="  Blogs DeepThoughts.rss?fmt=atom_1.0                         "><img style="border: 0pt none ;"                  alt="Atom 1.0"                  src="  images xml.gif ">                  &nbsp;Atom 1.0. Feed                                After adding the feed links and clicking on a feed, the resulting page looks like this:  Site visitors can now subscribe to an RSS feed by clicking the RSS link or pasting it  into their favorite RSS reader.  Summary In this chapter, we've now shown how OpenCms can be extended to add new  features. We created an example of this with an RSS feed module. The module  introduced a new content type and added the capability to build an RSS feed from  any OpenCms content type. We also built upon our last chapter by introducing  a new widget. The widget leveraged the data source framework from Chapter  7, thereby adding a new data source type. The new data source returns a list of  structured content types for use in editing forms. We wrapped up the chapter by  showing how the module is used by the site template to support RSS content feeds  for our site.  [ 238 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding  an Administration Point  In this final chapter, we will cover adding an Administration Point in the Workplace  Explorer Administration View. The Administration Point will provide a way to  manage the RSS feeds, for which we provided support in the previous chapter.  Rather than create a new module for this, we will add the administration support  into the existing RSS module. In this chapter, we will go over the following:         How to create an Administration Point in OpenCms. Using OpenCms Dialogs to achieve a consistent look. How to programmatically use OpenCms widgets.  When we are done, the RSS module will have an administrative interface that has a  native OpenCms look and feel.  Administrative Points Administrative Points appear as icons in the Workplace Explorer Administration  View. Several of these are provided with the default installation of OpenCms.  Adding a new administrative point is a programming task, but is relatively  straightforward. All Administration Points are read from folders located in the VFS  under the  system workplace admin  location:   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point  OpenCms constructs an icon in the Administration View for each folder in this  location based on the property values present on the folder. It is important to note  that the folders and properties are read from the Online project only. This means  that any changes made to the Offline project must first be published, before they are  visible. Also, the information is read only once and then cached. So, a server restart is  also necessary.  The properties are used to control the text, icons, groups, and layout of the icons in  the Administration view. The usage of the property values will vary slightly, based  on where the administrative item is placed. The following table details the properties  and their usage.  Property Name Description  NavImage  Usage This property contains the help text that appears in the upper  left of the administration view, when the administrative item is  hovered over. This property contains paths to image icons for the  administrative item. It may contain two icon paths separated  by a colon. The first icon is used in the main view area on the  right, and must be a 32x32 PNG or GIF image file. The second  icon appears in the column area on the left, for top level  administrative items only. Top level items are resources located  directly in the  system workplace admin  folder. The specified  icon must be a 20x20 PNG or GIF image. All icon images must  reside underneath the resources folder in the OpenCms web  application directory.  [ 240 ]   Property Name NavInfo  NavPos  NavText  Title  admintoolhandler-args  admintoolhandler-class  default‑file  Chapter 10  Usage This property contains the name of the administration  icon group that the Administrative item is to be contained  within. All items with the same group name will be grouped  together according to the position specified in the NavPos  property. OpenCms items are contained with a group named  Administration. This property contains a numeric value that is used to order  the icon within its group. Lower numbered items appear first,  wrapping left to right, top to bottom. Groups of icons will also  be ordered according to this numeric value. This property contains the text that appears under the icon for  the item in the main area. It may also contain text displayed as  a subheading within the icons related administrative area. The  subheading text within this property must be appended to the  icon text and separated with a colon. If no subheading text is  present, then the icon text is also used for the subheading. The title property is not used within the administration area,  but it is a good practice to provide a useful title to make it  easier to identify. This property provides optional arguments that are passed to  the admintoolhandler-class  described below . This property contains the name of a class used to control  the visibility and access of the administration tool. The class  must implement the I_CmsToolHandler interface. There  are several tool handlers located in the org.opencms. workplace.tools package, which may be used. This property applies to folder items only. It may be used  to provide the name of the default file, used for the given  administration area. When the icon for the folder item is  clicked on, OpenCms will run the specified file in addition to  building any navigation groups. The output of the file will be  displayed in the administration area, along with any groups  that were found. If the property is empty, then the index.jsp  will be used as the default file.   Since the Workplace interface is meant to support multiple locales, it is a good  idea to localize the string values. This is easily done by placing the strings into the  workplace.properties file within the module. After creating the folder and applying the properties, the Administration Point   can be implemented with a JSP file inside the folder. The simplest way is to write   the JSP file to contain any forms or information necessary to administer the item.   An example of this can be found by looking at the index.jsp in the flexcache   admin folder.  [ 241 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point  Within an administration point, it is also possible to create further sub-groups,  or administration items. A sub-group is created for each unique instance of the  NavGroup property, found on all files or folders within the parent administration  folder. A good example of this may be found by looking at the contenttools  administration folder:  The properties on the resources in this folder are used to form the administration  screen for the Content Tools area. Each resource containing the appropriate  properties will be represented in a group, with an associated icon. The resulting  administration area looks like this:  [ 242 ]   Chapter 10  The administration area contains three icon groups. Since the parent contenttools  folder does not have the default-file property set, OpenCms would normally  use index.jsp to render the administration area. However, in this case, as the  administration point does not contain the file, only the groups appear. If an   index.jsp file were present, then its output would appear on the screen and it  would be ordered with each group based on the NavPos property. Now that we  have an understanding of how to structure Administration points, let's create one   for the RSS feeds.  The Administration View To make the RSS Feed Administration point look as if it were a part of OpenCms,  it will have to be placed into the Administration icon group. The resulting  Administration View would appear like this:  First, using the Workplace Explorer, create a new folder to contain the  Administration Point:   system workplace admin rss  [ 243 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point  Then, set the following properties on the folder:  Here are the properties in detail:                   Description: This contains the text to appear in the help bubble. NavImage: This contains the path to two icons that have been created for  the Administrative item. The two images are separated with a colon. As  mentioned earlier, the images must be located on the physical file system  under the resources directory. Later on, we'll go over how to include the  images in the module. NavInfo: This contains the icon group for the administration point. To place  the administration point in with the rest of the OpenCms items, the icon  group named Administration is used. NavPos: This specifies the index of the item within the group. To ensure that  the RSS item gets placed at the end of the group, we examine the value for  the last icon and set a value that is higher. As the workplace icon, which is  last, has a value 120.0, we will use a higher value of 150.0. NavText: Two text items are entered, again separated by a colon. The first is  for the icon text and the second is for the subheading in the actual dialog. admintoolhandler-class: The specified handler ensures that the  administration point is only available to users with the Administrator role.  Some of the properties accept macro notation. This allows the values to  be localized in the workplace.properties file. The workplace. properties file should be located under the classes folder of the   RSS module:  system modules com.deepthoughts.rss classes com  deepthoughts rss  [ 244 ]   Chapter 10  The relevant keys appear at the end of the property file:    These properties are for the RSS Administration Point  GUI_RSS_ADMIN_TOOL_HELP_0 = Manage RSS Feeds GUI_RSS_ADMIN_TOOL_NAVTEXT_0 = RSS Management GUI_RSS_ADMIN_TOOL_SUBTEXT_0 = RSS Feed Management  Before we create the files needed to implement the administration point, we will  create an index.jsp file, and put some text into it as a placeholder:  This is the JSP for the RSS Administration  After saving the JSP and publishing the folder, the server needs to be restarted. The  new administration point should appear in the Administration View. As the initial  index file is simple, clicking the icon will just display the text we created. Before  going on to implementing the Administration point, we'll finish hooking it up to the  RSS module.  Hooking the Administration Point Up to the  Module So far, the changes made have been to the VFS in the  system folder. To make the  administration point portable, it will need to be placed into a module. This way it  can be exported and later installed on other systems.  The first thing to take care of is the images used for the icons. This is done by  just adding references to the necessary images from within the module. When  the module is imported into another system, OpenCms conveniently exports the  resources to the real file system. The images are referenced in the Module Resources section of the RSS module. Note  that there are also other VFS areas which are referenced:  [ 245 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point  One of the referenced areas is the administration point folder, added earlier. Also  note that there is a reference to the  system shared rssfeeds  folder. This is the folder  where RSS feeds that have to be managed by the RSS Administration point will  reside. As the RSS capability has been added as a new system feature, the feeds are  placed in a central location, rather than a site‑specific location.  After adding the changes, exporting the module will cause the required  administration point resources to get included along with it. Conversely, importing  the module into another system will create the resources in the proper locations.  Now that the basics are done, let's move on to implementing the administration  point for the RSS module.  The RSS Administration Module A quick and dirty administration handler can be easily created by adding a form and  a handler to the index.jsp created earlier. But instead, we will create something that  looks more integrated in order to maintain the OpenCms look and feel. Let's start  with reviewing the features, which the administration panel will support.  The RSS administration panel will support the following tasks:             Create new RSS feed containers  channels must be added manually . View details of existing RSS feeds. Edit existing RSS feed containers  no channel editing . Delete RSS feeds. Publish RSS Feeds.  [ 246 ]   To support these actions, the administration panel has to look like this:  Chapter 10  [ 247 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point  At the top of the panel is an icon used to create new RSS channels. Underneath that  there is a listing of the existing RSS feeds being managed. Each feed appearing in the  list may be edited, deleted, or published. The list also supports searching and has the  ability to show more details about each entry:  To support the screen layout, the administration point consists of two JSP files:  index.jsp and new_rsschannel.jsp. The top icon group is created by the presence  of the new_rsschannel.jsp file, as it contains the necessary navigation properties  for an icon group. The bottom area of the screen including the RSS Feeds outlined  area is created from the output of the index.jsp file.     [ 248 ]   The new_rsschannel.jsp file contains the following properties:  Chapter 10                 Description: This appears in the navigation help area on the left. NavImage: This is the icon for the item. Since this item is not in the top level  group, a small icon is not necessary. NavInfo: This contains the group name, 'RSS actions'. NavPos: If more than one item is present, then this would control the   icon order. NavText: This is the text that appears under the icon. admintoolhandler-class: The CmsOnlyAdminToolHandler is used to ensure  that only Administrators have access to the feature.  Let's look at the contents of each JSP file, starting with index.jsp:    <%      RSSFeedsList admin =            new RSSFeedsList pageContext, request, response ;     admin.displayDialog  ; %>  There's not much to it; it is a simple wrapper around the RSSFeedsList class. This  class is responsible for creating the entire user interface and does all the work. Let's  take a closer look at it.  [ 249 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point Leveraging the OpenCms Dialog Classes OpenCms provides a number of dialog classes that are used by the administration  screens. These classes provide a consistent look and feel and can be used by other  administration points that want to have a more finished look. We'll use these classes  in the RSS administration screens to make the screens look like OpenCms. Declaring the Dialog All dialog screens in OpenCms are based on the CmsDialog base class, which can  be found in the org.opencms.workplace package. The A_CmsListDialog class is a  more specific derivation of this class, which is designed to support list‑style dialogs.  We will subclass it with our own RSSFeedsList class to display the list of feeds:  public class RSSFeedsList extends A_CmsListDialog {      ** list id constant. *      public static final String LIST_ID = "rssfi";      ** list column name id constants *      public static final String LIST_COLUMN_NAME = "cn";     private static final String LIST_COLUMN_TYPE = "ct";     private static final String LIST_COLUMN_PATH = "cp";     public static final String LIST_COLUMN_EDIT = "ce";     public static final String LIST_COLUMN_DELETE = "cd";     public static final String LIST_COLUMN_PUBLISH = "cb";      ** list column action id constants *      public static final String LIST_ACTION_REFRESH = "rf";     public static final String LIST_ACTION_DETAILS= "de";     public static final String LIST_ACTION_EDIT = "ae";     public static final String LIST_ACTION_DELETE = "ad";     public static final String LIST_ACTION_PUBLISH = "ap";      **      * Public constructor with JSP variables.       *       * @param context the JSP page context      * @param req the JSP request      * @param res the JSP response      *      public RSSFeedsList PageContext context, HttpServletRequest req,                                             HttpServletResponse res  {     super new CmsJspActionElement context, req, res ,         LIST_ID,         Messages.get  .container                   Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_DIALOG_GROUP_NAME_0 ,         LIST_COLUMN_NAME,         CmsListOrderEnum.ORDER_ASCENDING, null ;     }  [ 250 ]   Chapter 10  Once again, the top of the class contains a few string constants. The first is an  identifier for the list dialog. The value of this identifier must be unique across all  dialog instances and is used in the constructor. Following the identifier are some  more constants used for column names and column action codes. The names and  action codes must also be unique, but only within the dialog instance.  After the constant declarations comes the class constructor. This passes along some  parameters to the super class constructor. The first parameter contains an instance  of a CmsJspActionElement, which the dialog will attach to. This is followed by the  unique dialog identifier and then the name of the dialog. The dialog name text has  been localized and is thus first retrieved from the Message bundle.  The next two parameters are used for sorting. To support sorting, the name of the  sort column and the initial support order is specified. The last parameter is null, but  may be used to specify a column name for searching. Later in the code, we will do  this differently to support searching within all columns.  After the constructor is an override of the initMessages method, which is called  upon to set any message strings.  protected void initMessages   {       add specific dialog resource bundle    addMessages Messages.get  .getBundleName   ;    super.initMessages  ; }  To support localization, all user interface strings have been placed into a Messages  class file. The messages are registered by calling the addMessage method.  Subsequent user interface references to message strings will then be resolved from  the message bundle. Defining Dialog Columns The next method contains a lengthy bit of code that defines the columns for the   list dialog:  protected void setColumns CmsListMetadata metadata  {        Create a column for deletion action     CmsListColumnDefinition deleteCol = new CmsListColumnDefinition                                                 LIST_COLUMN_DELETE ;     deleteCol.setName Messages.get  .container                         Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_COL_DELETE_0  ;     deleteCol.setHelpText Messages.get  .container                         Messages.GUI_LIST_COLS_RSSDELETE_HELP_0  ;     deleteCol.setWidth "20" ;     deleteCol.setAlign CmsListColumnAlignEnum.ALIGN_CENTER ;  [ 251 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point      deleteCol.setSorteable false ;        add delete action     CmsListDirectAction deleteAction = new CmsListDirectAction                                               LIST_ACTION_DELETE ;     deleteAction.setName Messages.get  .container                   Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_ACTION_DELETE_NAME_0  ;     deleteAction.setHelpText Messages.get  .container                 Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_ACTION_DELETE_HELP_0  ;     deleteAction.setConfirmationMessage                 new CmsMessageContainer null, "Are you sure you want                                to delete the selected RSS Channel?"  ;     deleteAction.setIconPath ICON_DELETE ;     deleteCol.addDirectAction deleteAction ;     metadata.addColumn deleteCol ;        Create a column for publish action     CmsListColumnDefinition publishCol = new CmsListColumnDefinition                                                 LIST_COLUMN_PUBLISH ;     publishCol.setName Messages.get  .container                           Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_COL_PUBLISH_0  ;     publishCol.setHelpText Messages.get  .container                            Messages.GUI_LIST_COLS_RSSPUBLISH_HELP_0  ;     publishCol.setWidth "20" ;     publishCol.setAlign CmsListColumnAlignEnum.ALIGN_CENTER ;     publishCol.setSorteable false ;        add publish action     CmsListDirectAction publishAction = new CmsListDirectAction                                                 LIST_ACTION_PUBLISH ;     publishAction.setName Messages.get  .container                   Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_ACTION_PUBLISH_NAME_0  ;     publishAction.setHelpText Messages.get  .container                   Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_ACTION_PUBLISH_HELP_0  ;     publishAction.setConfirmationMessage new CmsMessageContainer                          null, "Are you sure you want                            to publish the selected RSS Channel?"  ;     publishAction.setIconPath "list rightarrow.png" ;     publishCol.addDirectAction publishAction ;     metadata.addColumn publishCol ;        add column for name     CmsListColumnDefinition nameCol = new CmsListColumnDefinition                                                  LIST_COLUMN_NAME ;     nameCol.setName Messages.get  .container                            Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_COL_NAME_0  ;     nameCol.setWidth "33%" ;     nameCol.setSorteable true ;     nameCol.setHelpText Messages.get  .container                              Messages.GUI_LIST_COL_RSSEDIT_HELP_0  ;  [ 252 ]   Chapter 10         Add edit action by clicking on it     CmsListDefaultAction defEditAction = new CmsListDefaultAction                                                   LIST_ACTION_EDIT ;     nameCol.addDefaultAction defEditAction ;     metadata.addColumn nameCol ;        add edit action     CmsListDirectAction editAction = new CmsListDirectAction                                               LIST_ACTION_EDIT ;     editAction.setName Messages.get  .container                  Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_ACTION_EDIT_NAME_0  ;     editAction.setHelpText Messages.get  .container                       Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_ACTION_EDIT_HELP_0  ;     editAction.setIconPath ICON_ADD ;        Add column for content paths     CmsListColumnDefinition pathCol = new CmsListColumnDefinition                                                     LIST_COLUMN_PATH ;     pathCol.setName Messages.get  .container                               Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_COL_PATH_0  ;     pathCol.setWidth "33%" ;     pathCol.setSorteable true ;     metadata.addColumn pathCol ;        Add column for content types      CmsListColumnDefinition typeCol = new CmsListColumnDefinition                                                     LIST_COLUMN_TYPE ;     typeCol.setName Messages.get  .container                              Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_COL_TYPE_0  ;     typeCol.setWidth "33%" ;     typeCol.setSorteable true ;     metadata.addColumn typeCol ; }  The method receives a CmsListMetadata instance, which is to be populated with the  column information. Each column is constructed from a CmsListColumnDefinition  object, using the unique column id. Desired attributes are then set on the column  object, such as a name, help text, alignment, or size.  A column may be set up only for display, or it may also have an action associated  with it. An action is associated by constructing a CmsListDirectAction object  with a column action code. The action is applied to the column by calling the  addDirectAction method of the column object. The completed column definition  is then added to the CmsListMetadata instance. When the action is fired, the  associated action code can be used to differentiate between columns.  [ 253 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point Returning the Column Data The list dialog class retrieves column information through the getListItems  method. This method is called whenever the list data needs to be refreshed:  protected List getListItems   throws CmsException {     List lstItems = new ArrayList  ;        get the list of RSS Feeds     List lstFeeds = RSSFeedManager.getFeedManager                                  getCms   .getChannels  ;        if  null != lstFeeds  {        Iterator iFeeds = lstFeeds.iterator  ;           while  iFeeds.hasNext    {              CmsResource feed =  CmsResource iFeeds.next  ;              RssChannelDef channel = new RssChannelDef                                              getCms  , feed ;                name              CmsListItem item = getList  .newItem channel.getName   ;              item.set LIST_COLUMN_NAME, channel.getName   ;                 paths              RssChannelSrc[] aSources = channel.getChannelSources  ;              StringBuffer sbPath = new StringBuffer  ;              StringBuffer sbType = new StringBuffer  ;              for  int i=0; i<aSources.length; i++  {                 sbPath.append aSources[i].getSourceLocation   ;                 sbPath.append " " ;                 item.set LIST_COLUMN_PATH, sbPath.toString   ;                    type                 sbType.append aSources[i].getSourceContentType   ;                 sbType.append " " ;                 item.set LIST_COLUMN_TYPE, sbType.toString   ;              }           lstItems.add item ;        }     }     return lstItems; }  The method must return a List of CmsListItem instances, each representing a  row of data. The data for each column in the returned row is set by calling the set  method with the column id and value. The RSS dialog uses the RSSFeedManager  class to retrieve a list of all RSS feeds, which are then populated into the table. We'll  go over the RSSFeedManager class a little later on.  [ 254 ]   Chapter 10  Adding Column Actions Dialogs derived from the A_CmsListDialog class can support single, multiple and  independent actions on their list items. Single Actions: These are performed on individual list items and are  defined when the columns are defined in the setColumns method. The  executeListSingleActions method is called when the action should be executed  for the item. Multiple Actions: These are actions that may be performed on more than one item at  a time. Multiple actions may be defined with the setMultiActions method. When  an action is performed for multiple items, the executeListMultiactions method  will be called to perform the action. Independent Actions: These are actions that may be performed without selecting  any list items. These types of actions include things such as Refresh and Print and  usually appear at the top of the list. Independent actions may be defined by using the  setIndependentActions method. The executeListIndepActions method is called  when an independent action needs to be executed.  Now that we know the rules, lets look at the code. We've already seen how to define  single actions. So, look at how those actions get implemented:  public void executeListSingleActions   throws IOException,                      ServletException, CmsRuntimeException {        get the selected item row     CmsListItem item = getSelectedItem  ;        get the name of the feed  VFS path      String strFeed = item.get LIST_COLUMN_NAME .toString  ;     if  getParamListAction  .equals LIST_ACTION_EDIT   {           go to the 'new rss' page        Map params = new HashMap  ;        params.put "feed", strFeed ;           set action parameter to initial dialog call        params.put CmsDialog.PARAM_ACTION, CmsDialog.DIALOG_INITIAL ;        getToolManager  .jspForwardTool this, getCurrentToolPath   +                                             " new_rsschannel", params ;     } else if  LIST_ACTION_DELETE.equals getParamListAction     {           delete the feed        RSSFeedManager.getFeedManager getCms   .deleteChannel                                                     strFeed ;     } else if  LIST_ACTION_PUBLISH.equals getParamListAction     {           publish the feed        RSSFeedManager.getFeedManager getCms   .publishChannel                                                       strFeed ;  [ 255 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point         refreshList  ;     } else {        throwListUnsupportedActionException  ;     }        save any changes     listSave  ; }  This method is called when an action needs to be performed on a single item.  Upon being called, the method obtains the item to take action on by calling  getSelectedItem, which returns an instance of CmsListItem. The column values  may be retrieved from the returned item.  The method determines which action to execute by looking at the return value of  the getParamListAction method. The returned value may be compared with the  constant action codes to determine the appropriate action. In our case, the actions for  delete and publish are passed to the RSSFeedManager class.  The edit action is however different and forwards to the new_rsschannel.jsp item.  This is explained later on. But note that a URL parameter, with the path to the item,  is passed to the JSP. This will be used to differentiate between editing an existing  item as against creating a new one.  For now, let's move on to the method handling the independent actions.  protected void setIndependentActions CmsListMetadata metadata  {        makes the list searchable by several columns     CmsListSearchAction searchAction = new CmsListSearchAction                   metadata.getColumnDefinition LIST_COLUMN_NAME  ;     searchAction.addColumn metadata.getColumnDefinition                                                LIST_COLUMN_PATH  ;     searchAction.addColumn metadata.getColumnDefinition                                               LIST_COLUMN_TYPE  ;     metadata.setSearchAction searchAction ;        add feed details action     CmsListItemDetails rssItemsDetails = new CmsListItemDetails                                                LIST_ACTION_DETAILS ;     rssItemsDetails.setAtColumn LIST_COLUMN_NAME ;     rssItemsDetails.setVisible false ;     rssItemsDetails.setShowActionName Messages.get  .container                           Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_SHOW_DETAIL_NAME_0  ;     rssItemsDetails.setShowActionHelpText Messages.get  .container                           Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_SHOW_DETAIL_HELP_0  ;     rssItemsDetails.setHideActionName Messages.get  .container                           Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_HIDE_DETAIL_NAME_0  ;     rssItemsDetails.setHideActionHelpText Messages.get  .container  [ 256 ]   Chapter 10                           Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_HIDE_DETAIL_HELP_0  ;     rssItemsDetails.setName Messages.get  .container                                Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_DETAIL_NAME_0  ;     rssItemsDetails.setFormatter new CmsListItemDetailsFormatter                               Messages.get  .container                               Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_DETAIL_NAME_0   ;     metadata.addItemDetails rssItemsDetails ;        add refresh action     CmsListIndependentAction refreshAction = new                          CmsListIndependentAction LIST_ACTION_REFRESH ;     refreshAction.setName Messages.get  .container                               Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_REFRESH_NAME_0  ;     refreshAction.setHelpText Messages.get  .container                               Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_REFRESH_HELP_0  ;     refreshAction.setIconPath ICON_MULTI_ADD ;     metadata.addIndependentAction refreshAction ; }  This method is similar to the setColumns method, in that the information gets set  into the CmsListMetadata object. Recall that in the constructor a search column for  the list was not used. Doing so would have limited searching to just one column.  Instead, multiple columns are supported by instantiating a CmsListSearchAction  object with an initial column name and then adding the additional columns to it. The  metadata is then updated with the definition.  The remaining code in the method adds an action to display a detailed view of the  list, and another to perform a list refresh.  The next method handles the execution of the independent actions:  public void executeListIndepActions   {     if  getParamListAction  .equals LIST_ACTION_REFRESH  {        refreshList  ;     }     super.executeListIndepActions  ; }  There's not much to it because it is handled elsewhere. Support for searching   is handled by the base class, and the detailed view is handled by the   fillDetails method:  protected void fillDetails String detailId  {        get content     List users = getList  .getAllContent  ;     Iterator itUsers = users.iterator  ;     while  itUsers.hasNext    {  [ 257 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point         CmsListItem item =  CmsListItem itUsers.next  ;        String feedName = item.get LIST_COLUMN_NAME .toString  ;        CmsResource feed;        try {          feed = getCms  .readResource                RSSFeedManager.getFeedRepositoryPath   + feedName ;          StringBuffer html = new StringBuffer 512 ;          if  detailId.equals LIST_ACTION_DETAILS   {             SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat                                                    "MMM-dd-yyyy" ;              html.append "Last Updated On: " ;              html.append sdf.format feed.getDateLastModified    ;              html.append " " ;                 has it changed since last publish?              if  feed.getState  .isChanged   &&                                           !feed.getState  .isNew    {                 html.append "  needs publishing                                 " ;              } else if  feed.getState  .isNew    {                 html.append "  never published                                 " ;              }           } else {              continue;           }           item.set detailId, html.toString   ;        } catch  CmsException e1  {           e1.printStackTrace  ;        }     } }  This method is called iteratively by the super class for each item in the list. It then  provides additional details on the item. The detail information is formatted as  desired and appears in the row of the dialog.   Last is the implementation of multiple actions. Since our list dialog does not have  any multiple actions, the code is very straightforward:  protected void setMultiActions CmsListMetadata metadata  {        not supported – do nothing } public void executeListMultiActions   throws IOException,                                                 ServletException,        CmsRuntimeException {            we don't support any            throwListUnsupportedActionException  ;     }  [ 258 ]   Chapter 10  There are additional methods in the base class that may be overridden, if necessary.  But, for most cases, these are the ones that must be implemented.  We've made the admin dialog a little fancier by including an informational bar at   the top. This is supported through some custom HTML, another feature of the   dialog classes. Custom Rendering To make the layout of the administration dialog a little better, the top of the  dialog contains some informational text. This is added through the use of the  customHtmlStart method. HTML can also be added to the end of the dialog by  using the customHtmlEnd method. Both methods simply return a string containing  the custom HTML:  protected String customHtmlStart   {     StringBuffer result = new StringBuffer 512 ;     result.append dialogBlockStart this.getMessages  .key         Messages.GUI_RSSFEEDS_LIST_DIALOG_TITLE_NAME_0   ;     result.append "  The RSS feeds listed          below are located in the VFS at  system shared rssfeeds                          " ;     result.append dialogBlockEnd   ;     return result.toString  ;     } }  Although any HTML can be used, a more consistent look is achieved by using the  dialogBlockStart and dialogBlockEnd methods. These cause the output to be  framed in a box, consistent with the rest of OpenCms.  This completes the code for the RSS feed listing dialog. Before we move on to the  other dialog areas, we'll take a look at the helper class referenced in the code.  The Feed Manager Class To support the various actions that are performed in the administration screens, the  RSSFeedManager class is used. The class makes it easier for the RSS administration  dialogs to interact with the feeds and also abstracts the location of the feeds:  public class RSSFeedManager {      ** VFS path to the rss feed repository *      protected static final String FEED_REPOSITORY_PATH =                                      " system shared rssfeeds ";      ** Resource type ID for RSS Feeds *      protected static final int RSS_RESOURCE_TYPE_ID = 3001;  [ 259 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point       ** Schema location *      protected static final String RSS_SCHEMA =                     " system modules com.deepthoughts.rss                                   schemas rsschanneldef.xsd";      ** Reference to the CmsObject *      protected CmsObject m_cms;  First are a few constants that define the RSS schema file, repository location, and  resource type identifier. The RSS channels are managed in a shared folder location  specified by the FEED_REPOSITORY_PATH constant.  Next is the constructor, along with some property access methods:  public static RSSFeedManager getFeedManager CmsObject cms  {     return new RSSFeedManager cms ; } public RSSFeedManager CmsObject cms  {     m_cms = cms; } public static String getFeedRepositoryPath   {     return RSSFeedManager.FEED_REPOSITORY_PATH; }  public static String getFullName String Feed  {     return getFeedRepositoryPath   + Feed; }  The CmsObject passed to the constructor is used to initialize the returned instance. It  is required to allow the class to interact with the VFS later on. Supporting the Feed Operations The remaining methods of the class support the various actions that may be  performed on a feed channel. The first one returns a list of channels in the repository:  public List getChannels    {        Use the collector to obtain a list of resources     String collectorName = "allInFolderDateReleasedDesc";     try {           now collect the resources        I_CmsResourceCollector collector =                                OpenCms.getResourceManager  .           getContentCollector collectorName ;           if  null == collector  {           throw new CmsException Messages.get  .container                   Messages.ERR_COLLECTOR_NOT_FOUND_1,collectorName  ;  [ 260 ]   Chapter 10         }           get list of feeds in the repository        List collectorResult = collector.getResults m_cms,             collectorName, FEED_REPOSITORY_PATH + "" +             Integer.toString RSSFeedManager.RSS_RESOURCE_TYPE_ID  ;        return collectorResult;     } catch  CmsException e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;     }     return null; }  The OpenCms collector interface is used to retrieve the resources, returning them on  a list. This interface is used in a fashion similar to that used for retrieving the blog  content in the template code.  Next is the support for deleting a channel:  public void deleteChannel String Channel  {     try {        String resName = RSSFeedManager.getFullName Channel ;        getLock resName ;           ensure resource is locked           delete it        m_cms.deleteResource RSSFeedManager.getFullName Channel ,                                 CmsResource.DELETE_PRESERVE_SIBLINGS ;     } catch  CmsException e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;     } }  The code simply uses the deleteResource method to remove the specified resource.  Note that the code ensures that the resource is first locked by calling the getLock  method. This method checks to see if the file is locked by someone else, and if so,  steals the lock:  protected void getLock String Channel  throws CmsException {     CmsLock lock = m_cms.getLock Channel ;     if  !m_cms.getLock Channel .isUnlocked    {           steal lock        m_cms.changeLock Channel ;     } else {           lock resource to current user        m_cms.lockResource Channel ;     } }  [ 261 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point  Ensuring that the resource is locked is required for successful deletion.  Next is a method used to save or update changes made to a channel. This method  accepts an instance of the RssChannelDef and writes it to the VFS as an XML content  item. If the resource exists, then it is updated; otherwise it is created.  public void saveOrUpdateChannel PageContext ctx,     RssChannelDef Channel  { try {     String resName =        RSSFeedManager.getFullName Channel.getFilename   ;           if it exists then read the content           otherwise create a new one        CmsXmlContent xmlContent;        boolean bExists;        try {           CmsResource res = m_cms.readFile resName ;           bExists = true;           xmlContent = CmsXmlContentFactory.unmarshal m_cms,                                            res, ctx.getRequest   ;        } catch  CmsException e  {           bExists = false;              get the schema definition           CmsXmlContentDefinition contentDefinition =                   CmsXmlContentDefinition.unmarshal m_cms, RSS_SCHEMA ;              create and instance of the XML content           xmlContent =                     CmsXmlContentFactory.createDocument m_cms,                     m_cms.getRequestContext  .getLocale  ,                     OpenCms.getSystemInfo  .getDefaultEncoding  ,                      contentDefinition ;        }..           set the field values into the content        addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull xmlContent, "Title",                                             Channel.getTitle   ;        addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull xmlContent, "Description",                                       Channel.getDescription   ;        addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull xmlContent, "Copyright",                                         Channel.getCopyright   ;        addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull xmlContent, "Author",                                            Channel.getAuthor   ;        addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull xmlContent, "PublishDate",                      Long.toString Channel.getPublishedDate    ;        addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull xmlContent, "Image",                                             Channel.getImage   ;        addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull xmlContent, "ImageTitle",                                       Channel.getImageTitle   ;  [ 262 ]   Chapter 10            set the title and description properties                    List properties = new ArrayList 2 ;        CmsProperty prop = new CmsProperty  ;        prop.setName CmsPropertyDefinition.PROPERTY_TITLE ;        prop.setValue Channel.getTitle  ,                                CmsProperty.TYPE_INDIVIDUAL ;        properties.add prop ;        prop = new CmsProperty  ;        prop.setName CmsPropertyDefinition.PROPERTY_DESCRIPTION ;        prop.setValue Channel.getDescription  ,                                      CmsProperty.TYPE_INDIVIDUAL ;        properties.add prop ;           now we save the changes to the content        String decodedContent = xmlContent.toString  ;        try {           if  bExists  {              CmsFile docFile = xmlContent.getFile  ;              docFile.setContents decodedContent.getBytes                        CmsEncoder.lookupEncoding "UTF-8", "UTF-8"   ;              getLock resName ;              m_cms.writeFile docFile ;              m_cms.unlockResource resName ;           } else {              m_cms.createResource resName,                        RSS_RESOURCE_TYPE_ID, decodedContent.getBytes                         CmsEncoder.lookupEncoding "UTF-8", "UTF-8"  ,                                                          properties ;           }.        } catch  UnsupportedEncodingException e  {           e.printStackTrace  ;        }     } catch  CmsIllegalArgumentException e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;     } catch  CmsException e  {        e.printStackTrace  ;     } }  The top of the method obtains an instance of a CmsXmlContent item. It first tries to  read the existing item based on the resource name. If this fails, then it assumes that  the resource does not exist and creates a new instance of the resource. Note that in  the case of reading the resource, the CmsXmlContent item is obtained directly from  calling the unmarshal method. This differs from the creation case, where the content  definition needs to be obtained first before a new instance of the document can be  created. In both cases, we end up with the content instance.  [ 263 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point  Next, the method populates the CmsXmlContent item instance with the data from the  RssChannelDef. To handle the situation where it is overwriting an existing field or  adding a new field, it uses the addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull method:  protected void addOrUpdateFieldIfNonNull      CmsXmlContent iContent, String Fieldname, String newVal  {        first try to read back the value     I_CmsXmlContentValue curVal = iContent.getValue Fieldname,     m_cms.getRequestContext  .getLocale   ;     if  null != curVal  {           field is already there so update it        curVal.setStringValue m_cms, newVal ;     } else {           no existing field, only set one if a value is           provided        if  null != newVal  {           curVal = iContent.addValue m_cms, Fieldname,           m_cms.getRequestContext  .getLocale  , 0 ;           curVal.setStringValue m_cms, newVal ;        }     } }  This is a small but useful method that sets the value into the given field of the XML  content, but only if it is not null.  Going back to the method, we see that it sets the property values and ends by saving  the resource to the VFS. Note that here it also saves the contents differently, based on  whether an existing resource is updated or a new one is created. More robust error  handling is left as an exercise for the reader.  The last method in the class supports publishing the channel. This method utilizes  the CmsPublishManager class to do the work:  public void publishChannel String Channel  {     try {           publish the Channel        CmsPublishManager pm = OpenCms.getPublishManager  ;        pm.publishResource m_cms,                             RSSFeedManager.getFullName Channel  ;     } catch  Exception e  {           print out stack trace in case of error        e.printStackTrace  ;     } }  In case of an error, a stack trace is printed out. More sophisticated error handling can  be added if desired.  [ 264 ]   The New Channel Action Now let's move on to the other area of the RSS Administration screen, which handles  the creation of new feeds. Invoking this action creates two successive dialog pages.  The first page contains a form that looks similar to the RSS Channel editor:  Chapter 10  Clicking on the Continue button will invoke a second dialog page, which contains a  single field for specifying the RSS feed filename:  The Back button may be used to return to the previous page to make changes. The  code for this dialog is contained in the new_rsschannel.jsp file.    <%      RSSNewChannelDialog admin =        new RSSNewChannelDialog pageContext, request, response ;     admin.displayDialog  ; %>  As in the index.jsp file seen earlier, this file is also a thin wrapper around a   Java class.  [ 265 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point Declaring the Dialog As in the list dialog, the RSSNewChannelDialog is derived from the CmsDialog base  class. The class is a subclass of the CmsWidgetDialog class, which gives it the ability  to programmatically use widgets. It also has the ability to contain multiple pages.  Let's take a look:  public class RSSNewChannelDialog extends CmsWidgetDialog {     public static final String KEY_PREFIX = "rssadmin";     public static final String[] PAGE_ARRAY =                          {"channel_info", "channel_name"};     public static final List PAGE_LIST =                                 Arrays.asList PAGE_ARRAY ;     RssChannelDef m_channel;     String infoText;      public String getInfoText   {     return infoText; } public void setInfoText String infoText  {     this.infoText = infoText; }  Again, we start with the constants. The first constant is used to define a key prefix  for localized messages. This will prevent duplicate keys in other modules from being  used, while retrieving strings for this dialog. For this reason, it is important for this  key to be unique among all the dialog instances. Following this is an array and a  list defining the pages making up the dialog. Each page must have a unique name  within this dialog.  Last are some data members, including an instance of the RSSChannelDef class, and  some informational text. The text has associated getter and setter methods, allowing  it to be accessed as a property. The constructor comes next:  public RSSNewChannelDialog PageContext context,           HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res  {     super new CmsJspActionElement context, req, res  ; } protected String[] getPageArray   {     return PAGE_ARRAY; } protected void initMessages   {        add default resource bundles     addMessages Messages.get  .getBundleName   ;     super.initMessages  ; }  [ 266 ]   Chapter 10  The required getPageArray method must return an array of the dialog pages  declared earlier. This is followed by the initMessages method, which is the same   as the one for the list dialog covered earlier. Remember that messages are contained  in the messages.properties file, and that message keys are prefixed with the   KEY_PREFIX value. Here is a sample of what the message file looks like:  label.rssadmin.title = Feed Title label.rssadmin.desription = Feed Description label.rssadmin.copyright = Feed Copyright Label.rssadmin.title.help = Enter the title for this RSS feed Label.rssadmin.desription.help = Enter a description for this RSS                                                                 feed  The message strings used are the same as they are for structured content covered  earlier. Like a structured content type, widgets can also be used in Java-based  dialogs. Let's take a look at how to declare them for use in a Java dialog. Declaring the Widgets We've used the the CmsWidgetDialog class because it supports the same  widgets that are used by the structured content editors. Defining the widgets is  straightforward and is done through subclassing the defineWidgets method:  protected void defineWidgets   {     getDialogData  ;        Page 1     addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,                      "title", PAGE_ARRAY[0], new CmsInputWidget    ;     addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,                "description", PAGE_ARRAY[0], new CmsInputWidget    ;     addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,                                    "copyright", null, PAGE_ARRAY[0],                                       new CmsInputWidget  , 0, 1   ;     addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,                                       "author", null, PAGE_ARRAY[0],                                       new CmsInputWidget  , 0, 1   ;     addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,                                "publishedDate", null, PAGE_ARRAY[0],                                     new CmsCalendarWidget  , 0, 1  ;     addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,                                        "image", null, PAGE_ARRAY[0],                                      new CmsVfsFileWidget  , 0, 1  ;     addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,                                   "imageTitle", null, PAGE_ARRAY[0],                                        new CmsInputWidget  , 0, 1  ;        Page 2     infoText = "Please enter a file name for this channel";  [ 267 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point      addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter this,           "infoText", null, PAGE_ARRAY[1], new CmsDisplayWidget    ;   addWidget new CmsWidgetDialogParameter m_channel,             "filename", null, PAGE_ARRAY[1], new CmsInputWidget    ; }  The method starts by making a call to the local getDialogData method, which we  will skip for the moment. Next, it calls the addWidget method for each field being  edited. This method utilizes Java reflection to access the data field and accepts a  widget class to be used for editing that field. The method also accepts a dialog page  name where the widget will appear. Next, we'll take a look at how data is handled  within the dialog. Persisting Data Across Pages We've seen in the screens and the code that the dialog supports multiple pages. To  handle this, the state from a previous screen needs to be saved and then restored  when going to the next page.  Fortunately, this is made easy with the initWorkplaceRequestValues method.  This method is implemented in the base class and is called each time the dialog is  instantiated. Each new screen causes a new instantiation of the dialog, and hence a  call to this method:  protected void initWorkplaceRequestValues           CmsWorkplaceSettings settings, HttpServletRequest request  {        set the dialog message prefix        setKeyPrefix KEY_PREFIX ;        super.initWorkplaceRequestValues settings, request ;           save the current state of the job         setDialogObject m_channel ; }  First, the message key prefix is established to ensure that subsequent widget  instantiations get the correct message strings. The base class implementation is then  called, as no changes to its behavior are needed. It may be useful to take a look at  the code to see the base class implementation. By calling the base class, a call to the  defineWidgets method, which we looked at in the above section, will get called.  This is where the widgets will get added to the screen.  The method ends by calling the setDialogObject method. This method is used to  save the state of the dialog data between screen changes. CmsWidgetDialog-based  classes may use the getDialogObject and setDialogObject methods for managing  state information. The methods manage the state information in a Map that is stored  in the user session. Data placed into the Map is keyed and may be retrieved using the  class name of the dialog.  [ 268 ]   In the case of the RSS administration dialog, there are several cases that need to  be handled to manage the m_channel data. This is because the dialog supports  the creation of new channels, as well as editing existing ones. Recall that the list  dialog uses the JSP new_rsschannel.jsp as an action, when a channel is clicked  on. In addition to this, the dialog has to handle multiple screens. All these cases are  handled by the getDialogData method that was skipped over earlier:  Chapter 10  private void getDialogData   {     Object o = getSettings  .getDialogObject  ;     if  null == o  {           first time, handle edit or new           either a new channel or invoked from 'edit'        if  ! editChannelClicked    {           m_channel = new RssChannelDef getCms   ;       }     } else {           non-null dialog object, retrieve bean from state        Object existingChannel =                      Hashtable o .get this.getClass  .getName   ;         if  null != existingChannel  {           m_channel =  RssChannelDef  existingChannel;         } else {           if  ! editChannelClicked    {              m_channel = new RssChannelDef getCms   ;           }        }     } }  The method first checks to see if the dialog data has been set. If not present, then  another helper method is used to determine if the edit channel action was invoked. If  not, then it must mean that a new channel action was invoked, and thus a new data  member is instantiated.  If data has been set, then it is returned as an Object instance. The object instance is  a Map containing the persisted data for all dialog classes. Each dialog class obtains  its persisted data using a key matching the dialog's class name. The returned data is  then cast to the proper type, and the data field is updated. The final case handled is  when there is a previous state, but the user has clicked on the edit action.  Both cases use a helper method to deal with the edit channel action:  private boolean editChannelClicked   {     String strFeed =                  getJsp  .getRequest  .getParameter "feed" ;     if  null != strFeed  {        try {              load the channel into the bean  [ 269 ]   Extending OpenCms: Adding an Administration Point            m_channel = new RssChannelDef getCms  ,                    RSSFeedManager.getFeedRepositoryPath   + strFeed ;           return true;        } catch  CmsException e  {           e.printStackTrace  ;          }     }     return false; }  Recall that each item in the list was constructed with a URL parameter named feed.  This method simply detects the parameter, and instantiates the data field using the  path to the corresponding channel.  Handling the Dialog Actions The last action to handle is the dialog OK action, which is taken care of with the  actionCommit method:  public void actionCommit   throws IOException,     ServletException {        Save the channel     RSSFeedManager.getFeedManager getCms   .             saveOrUpdateChannel getJsp  .getJspContext  ,                                                m_channel ;        clear the object     getSettings  .setDialogObject null ;     m_channel = null; }  The RSSFeedManager class is used to save or update the changes. Since the action  returns to the main RSS administration area, the dialog state and channel data is also  cleaned up here.  Summary We've now seen how to extend OpenCms by adding an administration point. We've  shown how to define a new administration point and the various parameters used to  control the user interface. We also went over how to tie the administration point to a  module, to obtain portability. In implementing the administration point, we've gone  over how OpenCms dialog classes can be leveraged to get a more integrated look.  The administration dialog we covered also illustrated how to create multiple screens,  and how to manage state information across the screens. Finally, we covered how to  localize the dialogs, and how widgets can be used.

OpenCms is a professional-level open-source Website Content Management System, based on Java and XML. Many companies or organizations have requirements that go beyond what is available in the standard OpenCms application. Thankfully, OpenCms can be used by Java developers to create sophisticated add-ons and customizations that extend the power of OpenCms in virtually unlimited directions. Targeting version 7 of OpenCms, this book is for Java developers interested in extending and further customizing OpenCms through its Java API. Starting by showing how to set up a development environment for OpenCms work, the book moves you through various tasks of increasing complexity. Some of the common tasks covered are building OpenCms, XML asset type development, templating, module development, user and role setup, and search integration. In addition to these common tasks some more advanced topics are covered such as self-registering users, RSS support, developing custom widgets and extending the administrative interface. All the topics include examples and are presented while building a sample blog site
