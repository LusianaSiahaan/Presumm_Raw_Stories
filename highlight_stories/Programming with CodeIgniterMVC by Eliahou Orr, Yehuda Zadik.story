The CodeIgniter platform is an object-oriented   Model-View-Controller development platform. For more on MVC, please refer to  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Model-view-controller. The reader of this book  is expected to be familiar with at least the PHP programming language, specifically  with PHP OOP  object-oriented programming  and its usage, as well as with MySQL.   CodeIgniter  referred to as CI in this book  is an Application Development  Framework, a toolkit for people who build websites and web applications using  PHP. CodeIgniter is a smart application development skeleton framework, with  flexible and expandable core powered high performance and low footprint. The  CodeIgniter framework  OSL 3.0 open source license , developed and maintained   by Ellis Labs, powers an echo system of developers across the globe. The first   public version of CodeIgniter was released on February 28, 2006. It got very good  feedback from web application professional developers. During November 2010,   the CodeIgniter development project was added to the well-known GitHub  community projects, and got increasing interest and usage by developers worldwide,  as well as more and more third parties providing more add-ons with a better  maturity and functionality set. There is a rising trend of web applications based on OOP  object-oriented  programming  frameworks using MVC  Model-View-Controller  development  patterns, described in the next section, for developing advanced web applications.  CodeIgniter is such a framework. It seems that CodeIgniter is continuously increasing  its popularity as it has a simple yet high quality OOP core that enables great creativity,  reusability, and code clarity naming conventions, which are easy to expand  user  class extends CI class , while more third-party application plugins  including views  controllers models libraries helpers providing application-oriented solutions such  as CMS, shopping carts, or table grid navigators  and add-ons of libraries helpers are  becoming available.   Preface  The MVC concept is a development pattern or an application framework for a  computer user interface that separates the representation of information from the  user interacting with it. MVC has been adopted as a successful architecture for web  application developments. The model consists of application data and provides  services to manipulate them. The controller handles business rules and executes  requests to the models and views. The controller mediates between the input, mostly  received from a user interacting with a web browser that executed the rendered  view. The browser runs a received rendered view by the controller through an HTTP  protocol. The controller is the heart of the application. It performs model database  updates, business logic calculations, renders views to the user, and responds to an  asynchronous AJAX  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  request sent from the client  side. The view code defines the presentation and user input logic to be rendered by the  controller as HTML and JavaScript to the browser. The browser receives the rendered  view via the HTTP response to be executed locally. The browser executing that content  can present data, such as a mix of text, charts, diagrams, and images. There are legacy CMS  Content Management System  web development platforms  focused on CMS functionality and maintenance, such as a mature platform named  DRUPAL. It might be very useful for content-oriented projects, but less appealing  if the project aims to develop a new rich set of functionality, that is, web apps with  many inputs and customized UI operations. If the project's requirements involve  a low footprint and fast response high performance, CodeIgniter is found to have  excellent results.  To sum up in terms of flexibility, code reusability, light infrastructure, enabling  developer creativity, code clarity, highest performance, minimal footprint, and   fast learning curve, CodeIgniter seems to be the best choice. Furthermore, it is   part of a proactive improvement process thanks to the growing developer's  community worldwide.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Getting Started, introduces the CodeIgniter framework, while initially  getting started with web-based applications. Chapter 2, Configurations  and Naming Conventions, reviews the CI naming convention  rules, style guide, and spirit as well as the mandatory and optional configurations  and usage within a CI project, with several examples. The practice of user-defined  configurations will be reviewed as well. Chapter 3, Controllers, reviews the CI controller and the user-defined controllers  extending the CI controller. The CI controller class services, role, definition, usage,  and scope will be reviewed with several examples to clarify.  [ 2 ]   Preface  Chapter 4, Libraries, reviews the user-defined libraries in a CI framework. Their services,  role, definition, usage, and scope will be reviewed with several examples to clarify.  Several examples for defining libraries and using them will be provided. Chapter 5, Helpers, introduces you to the CI helpers and user-defined helpers'  reusability value, definition rules, scope, and usage. Several examples for defining  helpers and using them will be provided. Chapter 6, Models, covers CI models and user-defined models' reusability value,  definition rules, scope, and usage. Several examples for defining the models,  extending the CI model, and using them will be provided. Chapter 7, Views, explains the CI views concept as the generators for the client-side  visualization and user interaction provided via HTTP. The view of the PHP part and  scope, visual content  HTML CSS , and program  JavaScript AJAX jQuery  for the  client browser will be reviewed. The view's scope, definition, and controller rendering  guidelines with practical practice and tips and tricks will be covered in this chapter. Appendix, Appendix References, refers to recommended external resources   related to CodeIgniter's formal resources as well as the ECHO system of   the developer's community.

[ 6 ]   Getting Started  This chapter covers the basics of the CI development framework and its usage   by reviewing some fundamental web application examples. We will start with   a basic hello world example and move to an interactive contact-form integration  with a database. We will construct the CI applications by following a step-by-step  method. Throughout this chapter, we need to remember that the CI development  framework is an MVC-based development architecture  for more information, refer  to the Wikipedia definition at http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Model-view- controller .  This chapter will primarily focus on the following topics:     The CI project directory tree framework    Configurations  routing and autoloading are covered in this chapter,    while the other issues are covered in Chapter 2, Configurations and   Naming Conventions      Example 1: hello world     Example 2: passing parameters to a view    Example 3: the database query by a model rendering results to a view    Example 4: interactive contact forms  By reviewing these examples, we will get the basics of using CI resources.   We will begin by briefly reviewing the CI resources used. Then we will review   a web application code that loads a static view page. Next we will use the model   to retrieve data from a database and show it in a view. Finally, we'll add a view   with a contact form to enter input and save it by calling a controller method into   the database.   Getting Started  Installing CodeIgniter First of all, we need to have a hosted PHP server  Version 5.3 or later  and a MySQL   one of the latest versions  server, where we know the database credentials. Local  database access from the PHP is recommended for simplicity. Note that the server will operate in a CGI  Common Gateway Interface  fashion in  order to let CI operate. We can have a local web development environment on our  PC or a remote server hosted and dedicated.  Once we've set up a local web development environment, we'll need to download  the latest version of CI, which is Version 2.1.2 at the time of writing this book.   The link to download the latest version is http:  codeigniter.com downloads .  Now, if we look inside the CI folder, we should see the following directory tree:  codeigniter    index.php   application    cache    config    controllers    core    errors    helpers    hooks    language    libraries    logs    models    third_party    views    system    core    database    fonts    helpers    language    libraries   [ 8 ]   Chapter 1  Folders overview The root folder contains the index.php file, which handles all the URI requests.  The index.php file will process them with the CI core, and apply our application  controllers using the models, libraries, and helpers loaded by the controllers and  rendered views, license.txt, which is the CI's license file. .htaccess is used for  configuring the CI routing and removing index.php from the URL. JavaScript,   CSS, and HTML is incorporated into the rendered PHP output and their usage   is elaborated in Chapter 7, Views.  Let's review the folders and their content application.  The application directory folder is the root directory of our main activity project  coding zone. This is the heart of the CI-developed application project.  Mandatory components Let's take a look at the mandatory components.     application config: This folder contains all the CI application  configuration files, which are covered in Chapter 2, Configurations   and Naming Conventions.     application controllers: This folder contains all the application   controllers in the CI application project. A controller, as mentioned in the  Preface, is a component in the MVC-design architecture that handles the  request by the user and presents the data shown to the user. A controller in  CI is a class extending a base class of the CI controller. The class methods can  be executed or called with a proper URI. The naming conventions related to  the controller definition and usage will be covered in Chapter 2, Configurations  and Naming Conventions.     application views: This folder contains all the view files. A view is the  HTML content executed by the user browser that presents and interacts   with the user. A view can be a webpage or an RSS page.  The following components are not mandatory but are highly recommended:     application models: This folder contains all the project model files. A model   is the component of the MVC design architecture, which handles the data  stored in the database. A model in CI is a PHP class that is designed to work  with the information in the database. Chapter 6, Models, will elaborate on the   CI models concept, definition, and usage with several usage examples.  [ 9 ]   Getting Started     application helpers: This folder contains all the additional helper files to  the CI helpers. They can be third-party or created by the developer. A helper  file is a collection of independent procedural functions in a particular category.  Each helper function performs one specific task, with no dependence on  other functions. Chapter 5, Helpers, will elaborate on the CI helpers concept,  definition, and usage with several usage examples.     application libraries: This folder contains all the libraries of the CI   application project created by the developer. A CI library is technically a PHP  class. The scope of the library can be any project resource, such as helpers,  models, controllers, and views. For example, a library can provide Facebook  library API services to simplify the application code for Facebook integration.  Chapter 4, Libraries, will elaborate on the CI libraries concept, definition, and  usage with several usage examples.     system: This is the root of the CodeIgniter core directory. The system    folder contains important system components in the subfolders, such as   core, database, helpers  built-in system helpers , and libraries  built-in   system libraries .  Do not edit any of these files! Upgrading is much  easier if we don't.  Example 1 – hello world Initially, we will start with a simple example that displays Hello World on the  rendered web page. This is an example that doesn't use a database. The URI will be http:  ourdomain.com index.php hello. We can eliminate the index.php file from the path to enable a shorter URI;   that is, http:  ourdomain.com index.php hello.  In order to enable these shorter URIs, we will make configuration changes as  described in Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming Conventions, regarding the   config.php index_page setting in config.php.  We will build the following two scripts:     Controller class: application controllers hello.php    View script: application views helloview.php  [ 10 ]   In this example, we use the default configuration. For more information about  configurations, refer to Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming Conventions. The  controller in this example passes the parameters that are displayed in the view.  Chapter 1  Passing the parameters from the controller to the view  is optional.  The controller file Here's the code sample of the controller. The controller is responsible for rendering  the view with the parameters, such as mega title and message. For naming the  controller classes, refer to Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming Conventions.  <?php  class Hello extends CI_Controller {   * Index Page for this controller.   * Maps to the following URL      http:  example.com index.php hello   - or -       http:  example.com index.php hello index    - or -    * since this controller is set as the default controller in       config routes.php, it's displayed at http:  example.com    * So any other public methods not prefixed with an underscore      will map to  index.php welcome     @see http:  codeigniter.com user_guide general urls.html   public function index      {             Note that $view_params is optional         we can use $this->load->view 'helloview' ;as well.         if the view doesn't use php variables         The $view_params is extracted in the view script to php         variables $key = $value        In this example three variables will be generated by CI in the          view page        helloview.php variable: $mega_title        value: 'Codeigniter - Hello World'           variable: $title      value: 'Welcome to          Codegniter'         variable: $message    value: 'Hello World'     $view_params = array      'mega_title' => 'Codeigniter - Hello World',       'title'      =>  'Welcome to Codegniter',      'message'    =>  'Hello World'                                     ;       $this->load->view 'helloview', $view_params ;       }          [ 11 ]   Getting Started           }    closing the class definition   * End of file welcome.php *    * Location: . application controllers welcome.php *   You can download the example code files for all Packt books you  have purchased from your account at http:  www.packtpub.com.

The view file The following is the corresponding rendered view that uses the parameters provided  by the controller to render the view to the web page and return it to the user:                                                  Example 2 – passing the complex  parameters to a view In this example, we will show you how to pass and use complex parameters, such as  arrays and object arrays, from the CI controller to the rendered CI view to be used in  the view. You can pass any number of arrays as parameters to a view; you can also  pass objects, such as rows of a query result.  A standard GET parameters URI looks like this: http:  ourdomain.com index. php example2 more ?a=1&b=2&c=3.  However, let's remember that in CI the URI is passed in this manner: http:   ourdomain.com index.php example2 more 1 2 3. For more information, see  Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming Conventions.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1  Looking at the URI, we will build the controller example2.php with the function  named more with the three parameters passed to it.  We will build the following two scripts:     The controller class: application controllers example2.php    The view script : application views  example2more.php  The controller file The controller is responsible for rendering the view with parameters such as mega  title and message.  The following is the code sample of the controller:  <?php  class Example2 extends CI_Controller {     This function gets parameters and passes them to the view      example2more     The example url      http:  ourdomain.com index.php example2 more 1 2 3   so $a = 1, $b = 2, $c = 3   public function more $a, $b, $c    {        The parameters in $view_params are extracted in the view        example2more.php        In this example 2 variables will be generated by CI in the        view page example2more.php       variable: $mega_title, value: Codeigniter, Passing        url parameters to view     variable: $rows, value: array 'a' => $a, 'b' => $b, 'c' => $c ;     $rows = array 'a' => $a, 'b' => $b, 'c' => $c ;     $view_params = array 'mega_title' => 'Codeigniter -          Passing url parameters to view 'rows' => $rows ;     $this->load->view 'example2more', $view_params ;     }    }   closing the class definition   * End of file welcome.php     [ 13 ]   Getting Started  The view file The following is the corresponding rendered view:                             Key     Value      $value : ?>                           Example 3 – the database query by   a model rendering results to a view In this example, we will show you how the CI controller uses the CI model   to retrieve data from the database and render it to a CI view. The URL will be http:  ourdomain.com index.php user. First, we will have to configure the database settings in the configuration file  application config database.php.  We should keep the default database settings unchanged, and only change the  following configuration parameters:  $db['default']['hostname'] = '127.0.0.1';   In many cases when the hostname's value is 'localhost' the  connection to the database fails.   Setting the hostname to 127.0.0.1 solves the problem.  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  $db['default']['username'] = 'dbUser; $db['default']['password'] = 'dbPassword'; $db['default']['database'] = 'dbDataAbse'; $db['default']['port']     = 'dbPort';  The model class will retrieve all the user details from the table users. For more information on configurations, refer to Chapter 2, Configuration   and Naming Conventions.  We will build the following three scripts:     The controller class: application controllers user.php    The model file: application model usermodel.php    The view script: application views userview.php  The controller file The controller retrieves the users list from the database via the model and renders  the view with it.  The following is the code sample of the controller:  <?php class User extends CI_Controller {   function users     {       Manually loading the database     $this->load->database  ;       Loading the model class     $this->load->model 'Usermodel' ;     $view_params['mega_title'] = 'Model Example';       Calling the model to retrieve the users from the database     $view_params['users']= $this->Usermodel->get_users  ;     $this->load->view 'userview', $view_params ;   } }  * End of file welcome.php *   * Location:  application controllers welcome.php *   [ 15 ]   Getting Started  The model file The following is the code sample of the model.  parent::__construct  ;  <?php class Usermodel extends CI_Model {   function __construct     {        Call the Model constructor    }     This method retrieves the users list and returns an array of       objects each containing user details   function get_users     {       Calling CI's database object's method for generating SQL        queries.     $query = $this->db->get 'users' ;       returns an array of users objects     return $query->result  ;   } }  In this example, the CI object database's method is called for generating   and executing the SQL query.  Please refer to the CI database's library at http:  ellislab.com codeigniter  user-guide database index.html. For more information about models, refer to Chapter 6, Models.  The view file The view in this example shows the table content received from the controller  containing the users list as defined in the database.  The following is the corresponding rendered view:                           [ 16 ]   Chapter 1     ID     Name     Email            user_id ?>      user_fname." ".$user->user_lname; ?>      user_email ; ?>           Example 4 – interactive contact forms This example shows how to write a contact form using the CI form helper and the  form_validation library. For more information about libraries, refer to Chapter 4, Libraries, and for information  about helpers, refer to Chapter 5, Helpers. The CI controller defines a form validation setup using the form_validation library  and renders a form view that uses the form_validation library setup to apply a  desired validation on the submitted data by the user. If it's a success, the CI controller  will render a view page displaying a success message, otherwise it will render the view  page with the form and the error messages will be displayed. The URI for this example is http:  ourdomain.com index.php contact. In order to perform this example, we shall build the following three scripts:     The contact form controller class: application controllers contact.php    The view form script: application views contactview.php     The view success page script: application views contactsuccess.php  [ 17 ]   Getting Started  The controller file The controller creates a form for adding and editing a product. For more information, refer to Chapter 7, Views.  The following is the code sample of the controller:  <?php class Contact extends CI_Controller {   public function index     {       Loading the form helper     $this->load->helper 'form' ;       Loading the form_validation library     $this->load->library 'form_validation' ;     $view_params['form']['attributes'] = array 'id' =>'myform' ;       contact name details     $view_params['form']['contact_name']['label'] = array         'text' => 'Your name:', 'for' => 'name' ;     $view_params['form']['contact_name']['field']= array         'name' => 'contact_name', 'id' => 'contact_name',          'value'=>isset $_POST['contact_name']  ?     $_POST['contact_name'] : '',     'maxlength' => '100', 'size' => '30', 'class' => 'input' ;       contact name details     $view_params['form']['contact_email']['label'] = array         'text' => 'Your email:', 'for' => 'email' ;     $view_params['form']['contact_email']['field'] = array         'name' => 'contact_email', 'id' => 'contact_email',          'value'=> isset $_POST['contact_email']  ?     $_POST['contact_email'] : '',     'maxlength'   => '100', 'size' => '30', 'class' => 'input' ;       contact message details     $view_params['form']['contact_message']['label'] = array         'text' => 'Your message:', 'for' => 'message' ;     $view_params['form']['contact_message']['field'] = array         'name' => 'contact_message', 'id' => 'contact_message',          'value' => isset $_POST['contact_message']  ?     $_POST['contact_message'] : '',     'rows' => '10',  'cols' => '100', 'class' => 'input' ;        Setting validation rules     $config_rules = array array 'field' => 'contact_name',        'label' => 'Contact Name', 'rules' => 'trimrequired' ,     array 'field' => 'contact_email', 'label' => 'Contact Email',        'rules' => 'trimrequiredvalid_email'  ;     $this->form_validation->set_rules $config_rules ;     $this->form_validation->set_rules 'contact_message',        'Contact Message', 'trimrequired' ;        Validating the form  [ 18 ]   Chapter 1      if  $this->form_validation->run   == FALSE         failed      {       for  $index = 0; $index < count $a_fields  $index++ ;       {         $s_field = $a_fields[$index];         if  form_error $s_field           {           $view_params['form'][$s_field]['field']['class'] .= '              error';           }         }       $this->load->view 'contactview', $view_params ;       }       else    Validation succeeded       {       $success_params = array 'message'=> 'Success' ;       $this->load->view 'contactsuccess', $success_params ;       }     }   }  * End of file welcome.php *   * Location: . application controllers welcome.php *   The view file The view file displays the contact form for receiving data from the user.

In the next chapter, we will  review the configurations, such as database and naming conventions that are  essential for the CI project.  [ 20 ]   Configurations and Naming  Conventions  This chapter initially introduces the CI naming conventions. These conventions  include the rules, style guide, and CodeIgniter naming spirit. The second part of   this chapter will review CI project configurations for built-in resources as well as  user-defined or third-party add-on libraries. Note that we will actually build our  own project code in the subdirectory application described in Chapter 1, Getting  Started, with optionally relative resource directories for our project's self-made  resources, such as CSS   Media   jQuery libraries' resources or third-party   add-ons, extending the base CI downloaded from the Ellis Labs site or GitHub.  We should remember that developing a CI project is done by replacing expanding  the default provided controllers, views, models, and other resources in a well-defined  OOP fashion. We should extend controllers, models, and add additional views as well  as use defined helpers or libraries. We can add these from third-party libraries   or helpers, or develop new ones for our special project business logic and needs.  The initial step after installing the CI is making the proper configurations for   our project requirements, such as database, session, auto-loaded helpers, and   the libraries we want.  The CI has a set of configuration files defined in the project directory located at  application config. These configurations are loaded initially whenever we  execute any of our project's CI controllers via a URI call using a browser or issuing  an HTTP request via code. The major configuration files are: config.php, database. php, autoload.php, and routes.php.  We should review each of the major configuration files with its configuration value,  which includes recommended value, and possible values.   Configurations and Naming Conventions  CI directory tree The following is the classic directory tree structure of CodeIgniter:  Note that when we add new plugins and other resources such as bootstrap, new  directories of resources may be added with a name of your choice so that you can  refer to them from the specific resource you are developing using the CI BASEPATH  defined parameter as the directory path to the CI_PROJECT_ROOT directory. If we add a new directory under the project root, let's say bootstrap, the path for  including resources such as CSS, JavaScript, or images  for example, hello.png    will be $path = BASEPATH."bootstrap hello.png".  config.php The CI main configuration files have the following major configurations:  $config['base_url'] = '';  The default is an empty string so that CI can calculate the base URL of our project  root directory. We shall refer to the base URL in many places in our code, mostly   to execute controllers. To get the base URL, we should call:  $base_url = base_url  ;    defined in the URL    helper mentioned before.  [ 22 ]   The base_url   function in the URL helper function returns the URI string to the  CI project base. For example, if the CI project is developed on a domain named  example.com under a public_html directory named mydev, and we have a  controller named find, a method named stock, and a directory named myprod,  we can call the find or stock method in both the myprod and mydev projects using  base_url  :  Chapter 2  $url = base_url  ."index.php  find stock";  In the mydev project, we will get:  $url = "http:  example.com mydev index.php find stock"  In the myprod project, we will get:  $url = "http:  example.com myprod index.php find stock"  Hence, in order to call a controller class named my_class, we use:  $URL = base_url  ."index.php my_class mymethod";  This will define $url as http:  example.com mydev index.php my_class.  To set the index page as a part of the URI path to CI controllers methods, we use:  $config['index_page'] = 'index.php';  The index.php file is the CI root PHP service that handles all the URI requests. It is  used as part of a path URI to a resource, such as http:  mysite.com fci index. php tables_management show. However, we can hide the index.php file by setting  CI to hide the index.php file in the URI path for calling the CI resources such as  http:  mysite.com fci tables_management show. To do so, we need to perform  the following configuration steps:  1.   In the project root directory where the CI index.php file resides, an  HTACCESS type file named .htaccess is added with the following  configuration lines, which reroutes a none index.php URI referring   to the CI project controllers path without index.php: RewriteEngine On RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d  RewriteRule ^ .* $ index.php $1 [L]    AcceptPathInfo On    [ 23 ]   Configurations and Naming Conventions  For more on this, refer to http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Htaccess.  2.  We should make the change to the  config config.php file so that    index_page will be empty in the URI path string instead of the default  index.php. $config['index_page'] = '';  The .htaccess file does the trick here by adding the index.php file to the URI after  receiving the URI request from the browser and before executing it. The result is that  the user who is browsing will not see it, but it will call the desired resource properly,  in a similar way to how we used index.php:  The language setting is done as follows:  $config['language'] = 'english';  It is recommended that you leave this as default. Note that even if we use other  languages, such as Arabic or Hebrew, it will be fine. We just make sure that our  PHP files are saved as UTF-8 without BOM  byte order mark is a unicode character  that marks the file-encoding method supporting multilanguage schemes; for more  information, refer to http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Byte_order_mark to inform  the browser that receives the rendered HTML page to process it as a UTF-8 file.  The exact meaning of this tag is out of the scope of this book and can be learned from  HTML standard.  $config['charset'] = 'UTF-8';  Additionally, it is highly recommended for multi-language support to add the  following line in our view file's HTML header:  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text html; charset=utf-8"  >  These settings inform the browser to process the rendered HTML page whose  characters are encoded as UTF-8, which is the most common multilanguage   standard for non-English languages such as Hebrew, Arabic, and Chinese.  Do not touch these settings; it is very useful to support multiple languages.  $config['enable_hooks'] = FALSE;  The preceding configuration, if set to TRUE, will enable us to define hooks into CI  events, where the hooks are defined in the application hooks directory. Do not  touch these settings unless you have a specific plan for CI event hooks. Note that   the concept of adding hooks to the CI core activity is out of this book's scope.  $config['subclass_prefix'] = 'MY_';  [ 24 ]   Chapter 2  The preceding configuration will enable us to define naming roles to our library class  name's prefix, in order to distinguish with other default libraries.  $config['permitted_uri_chars'] = 'a-z 0-9~%.:_\-';  The preceding code defines the allowed chars within a URI calling CI resources,  mainly controllers. It is recommended to not touch this setting.  $config['allow_get_array'] = TRUE;  This will enable us to call the controller class methods with parameters, such as in  the example provided earlier.   index.php my_handler calc 5 7  The preceding code will provide the same results as the class method within the   my_handler class itself in the following format:  $Val= $this->calc 5,7 ;  The following configuration defines if a GET URL query string will be used:  $config['enable_query_strings'] = FALSE;  This configuration, if set to TRUE, will enable us to call controller class methods   with parameters in the GET URL query form:   index.php my_handler calc.php?a=5&b=7  It is highly recommended to leave this as FALSE, as CI provides a solution to pass  parameters within URI, as shown in the calc example at the beginning of this chapter.  The log threshold for the severity level is such that any event that is of the same or  higher severity level will be logged to CI. The supported threshold levels and their  meanings are as follows:     0: Disables logging  error logging turned off     1: Error messages  including PHP errors     2: Debug messages    3: Informational messages    4: All messages  $config['log_threshold'] = 4;    4 is the highest level for all CI events from notice level     events and worse  [ 25 ]   Configurations and Naming Conventions  The preceding configuration will generate error logs according to the   log_threshold    level at  application logs if the error log was enabled.  Note that enabling the errors log will cause performance reduction in our web  application. Use it only if you must for debugging needs. Otherwise set it to 0.  $config['log_path'] = '';  The default log file path in the CI project is application logs. Do not touch this  configuration unless you have a clear reason.  The date time format:  $config['log_date_format'] = 'Y-m-d H:i:s';  The default date time format setting is 2012-06-18 14:54:11. It is recommended   to not touch this configuration.  The cache file path:  $config['cache_path'] = '';  The default is application cache. It is recommended not to touch this  configuration. The session key:  $config['encryption_key'] = '';  This encryption_key must be set with a key in order to use the session class  services. For example:  $config['encryption_key'] =  'cMGy4DSwGUvxYSar4279626HgOn2342efrwerr2TE2RF4G3reg4tF3etf';  An example of the session library usage within a controller and setting a session  variable is as follows:  $uid = 119;    where uid is the id of the loggeing user $this->session->set_userdata  'this_user_id', $uid  ;  Getting the session variable in another controller is as follows:  $uid = $this->session->userdata 'this_user_id' ;  The session data storage mechanism is as follows:  $config['sess_use_database'] = FALSE;  If the recommended configuration is set to TRUE, we would use many session  parameters of a large size stored in the associated default database.  [ 26 ]   Chapter 2  Session expiration timeout in seconds:  $config['sess_expiration'] = 7200;    The number of seconds the session will be kept  Additional session configuration parameters can be found in the CI user manual.   Cross-site scripting  XSS  filtering activation deactivation:  $config['global_xss_filtering'] = FALSE;  This will enable XSS filtering on URI requests sent to the application. Note that  all URI requests are processed initially by the root index.php to analyze the URI  request and issue the proper CI calls. If set to TRUE it will protect URI requests from  XSS type malicious attackers. It is recommended to set it to TRUE even if we reduce   a bit of our application performance.  $config['csrf_protection'] = FALSE;  If set to TRUE the CI will prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery  CSRF XSRF  attacks.  The risk is when the fraud form is submitted. If we are accepting user data, it is  strongly recommended that CSRF protection should be enabled. Note that when  using AJAX, additional code may be required to enable CSRF protection with AJAX.  database.php The database configuration enables to define one or more database connections that  can be used by the application. The database configuration is a two-dimensional  array in the following form:  $db['db_entry']['db_connection_param']  By setting the parameters for database default entry, we shall define the   following parameters:  $db['default']['hostname'] = 'localhost';    note: in some cases '127.0.0.1' must be used instead     localhost if the database server is in another server use    URI such as: 'domain.db.NNNNNNN.hostedresource.com' or     similar – advise our system admin service provider    Optional configuration of DB server connection port  $db['default']['port'] = '4009';    In case our DB server operates on another port    otherwise we may drop the port config line!  $db['default']['username'] = 'mydefaultdb';  [ 27 ]   By setting the parameters for another database entry named dbentry2, we shall  define the following parameters:  Configurations and Naming Conventions  $db['default']['password'] = 'mypass1'; $db['default']['database'] = 'mydatabase1'; $db['default']['dbdriver'] = "mysql"; $db['default']['dbprefix'] = ""; $db['default']['pconnect'] = TRUE; $db['default']['db_debug'] = TRUE; $db['default']['cache_on'] = TRUE; $db['default']['cachedir'] = ""; $db['default']['char_set'] = "utf8"; $db['default']['dbcollat'] = "utf8_general_ci";  $db['dbentry2']['hostname'] = 'localhost'; $db['dbentry2']['username'] = 'mySecondDB'; $db['dbentry2']['password'] = 'mypass2'; $db['dbentry2']['database'] = 'mySecondDB'; $db['dbentry2']['dbdriver'] = "mysql"; $db['dbentry2']['dbprefix'] = ""; $db['dbentry2']['pconnect'] = TRUE; $db['dbentry2']['db_debug'] = TRUE; $db['dbentry2']['cache_on'] = TRUE; $db['dbentry2']['cachedir'] = ""; $db['dbentry2']['char_set'] = "utf8"; $db['dbentry2']['dbcollat'] = "utf8_general_ci";  There is no need to connect and load the default database as it is done automatically  when loading the database class—however, the call is:  $this->load->database  ;  Or, for referring to a specific database entry name, it is:  $this->load->database 'default' ;  In order to connect and load the dbentry2 database settings stated earlier, use the  following code:  $this->dbentry2= $this->load->database dbentry2', TRUE ;   To use the default database with the database class library, db, use:  $q1 = $this->db->query  "select * from mytable" ;  To use the dbentry2 database, use:  $q2 = $this->dbentry2->db->query  "select * from DB2table" ;  [ 28 ]   Chapter 2  routes.php Define the default controller that will be executed when referred via the URI to the  base_url of the project—let's say http:  mydomain.com myapp so that myapp is a  subdirectory of public_html in the sever and we have home_page_controller.  $route['default_controller'] = "home_page_controller";  When the user issues http:  mydomain.com myapp, due to the route configuration  for the home controller, the URI that CI will issue will be as if the user is referring to  http:  mydomain.com myapp home_page_controller.  $route['404_override'] = '';  In the preceding example, the default application errors error_404.php page  will be executed, in case the user refers to a non-existing project controller, such as  http:  mydomain.com myapp sadfasdfsdfsdi.  We may decide, for example, to pop-up a message for the non-existing page   and route to the default URI to minimize user inconvenience.  Defining and using your own  configurations CI enables us to define our own configurations and easily access them via the   config class. For example, with application config my_config.php, let's say   we define a parameter in that config file as follows:  $param1 = "value1";  We can easily access our configuration file parameters to load all the parameters   into the array:  $array = $this->config->load 'my_config', TRUE ;  The second parameter, TRUE, assures us that our configuration parameters will be  defined in an array prefixed with the configuration file name.  Consider: $param1 = $array['my_config']['param1']; or: $param1 = $this->config->item 'param1', 'my_config' ;. $param1 will have the value value1 that we have set in the configuration file   that we built.  [ 29 ]   Configurations and Naming Conventions  Understanding and using CI naming  conventions The CI naming conventions are essential to understand and use, in order to properly  develop with CI. They enable you to write minimal code using a strict and concise  set of rules.  The full CI naming conventions and style guide can be found at   http:  codeigniter.com user_guide general styleguide.html.  The naming conventions refer to the naming of parameters, functions methods,  class-related PHP file name storing code, project resource paths, and so on. Here   are the specific issues we will review:     Extending CI resources such as the CI controller or model in our project   resources  class extends class fashion—for example, extending CI_ controller or CI_model; see the examples discussed in the Controller  definition naming rules section      Defining views and rendering them by a controller with or without  providing parameters that the view code may use for its operation     Using existing general reusable resources  can be loaded from any controller  or model and reused by rendered views as well  of CI helpers and libraries,  and defining new CI helpers and libraries     How-tos, dos, and don'ts for locating files and naming are categorized based   on the defined controllers, models, libraries, and helpers     Relations between the defined class resource name, containing file name,   loading a defined class a helper or a model, instantiating and calling a calls  method via the URI and calling a class method with parameters  The main resource type naming rules CI defines "one class one file standard" so that every class of a CI controller extension  and CI model extension of a library class resides in one file. This also applies to  helpers that are a set of functions. Each resource category  controller, library,   model, and view  will be located in a specific directory or its subdirectory.   The most commonly used resource categories are as follows:     Controllers: These get the client side  for example, browser        Views: These are rendered by the controller and returned to the browser    to operate  via HTTP  [ 30 ]      Libraries: These are called by project resources such as controllers, views,      Models: These are called by project resources such as controllers, views,      Helpers: These are called by project resources such as controllers, views,   models, and helpers  libraries, and helpers  libraries, and models  Chapter 2  Controller definition naming rules Let's define the initial project controller to handle some basic services. Note that the  controller class name is My_handler, and must reside in a file named my_handler. php  all lower case  at  application controllers in our CI project directory.  Here's the code sample with which to review the naming conventions:  class My_handler extends CI_Controller {  function __construct  {    Must Call Patent to get all its services inherited parent::__construct  ; }   function index    {    executed when referring to My_handlercontroller via URLecho "Hello  World"; }  function calc   $a = 2, $b=2  {     executed when referring to My_handler calc via URL echo   " $a * $b  = ".$a*$b; }  functionAJAX_calc    {    If the request is not an AJAX we shall abort!   This is done by the  [ 31 ]   Configurations and Naming Conventions  if  !$this->input->is_AJAX_request      exit  'none AJAX calls rejected!' ;      see http:  codeigniter.com user_guide libraries input.html  $a = $this->input->post 'a' ;   get the posted a parameter  $b = $this->input->post 'b' ;   get the posted b parameter   $result =  int  $a *  int  $b;  $data = array 'result'=> $result ;     to add more array parameters: ,'p2' => $p2, 'p3'=>$p3,.. echojson_encode $data ;   return the JSON encoded array return; }  }    closing the class definition  We call this controller via an HTTP request URL, as an HTTP or HTTPS request.   For example: http:  mydomain.com index.php my_handler.  Let us review several usage scenarios with this controller class definition. Note that  you can enable CodeIgniter to operate without the index.php file in the path; for  more information, refer to the index.php file issue discussed later in this chapter.  In this section we will review different use cases for the CI controller as well as the  naming rules associated with the controller. The following are the cases that are  mainly used for calling a controller:     Directly from a browser    From a view HTML page script using a CI PHP anchor helper embedded       From a view HTML page using a JavaScript jQuery AJAX call embedded    in the page  in the page     From a crontab PHP script using cURL to call a controller  The controller has its own naming rules and usage guidelines that we will review  now. The controller is most commonly called from the view using an anchor tag.  However, it may also be called using AJAX or even a crontab PHP script using a  PHP function file or cURL-based request.  [ 32 ]   Chapter 2  Example 1 – calling the controller index method Controllers are mostly called via a user interaction session on a rendered view  processed by a client browser. The controller method is called to issue another  process, such as and AJAX request or processing the request and rendering it back to  the client browser additional view or web page. To define the controller call within  a view definition  application views , we define an anchor to be executed by the  browser per user request. Note that in these examples we use another URL helper  named anchor  .  anchor  $uri, $text, $html_attributes ;  Note that in order to use the CI anchor helper function, we will initially load the  helper URL via config autoload.php.  $autoload['helper'] = array 'url' ;  Another way to do this is to load the anchor helper in the controller rendering the  view, where we want to use an anchor:  $this->load->helper 'url' ;     $URI: The URI path to call a controller or any URI we want to execute    $text: The anchor label shown to the user to click on    $html_attributes: Any HTML attributes that can be defined for an HTML   anchor element  An example of the resulting HTML that will be executed by the client-side browser   is as follows:    Press Me    <!-- where   $text = 'Press Me'; $html_attributes = "class='mybutton'";-->  $uri = 'myapps.com myciapp showme';  Back to our example—the view code part that enables the user to call the defined  controller will look like the following  the PHP portions are with other HTML tags   in a view file :  <?PHP  echo anchor ase_url  .' index.php my_handler ','Press Me A' ; ?>  [ 33 ]   Configurations and Naming Conventions  Since we only referred to the class name, its constructor and index  method, if defined, will be executed. In case we did not define an  index method for this my_handler controller, the preceding calls  will only instantiate the class using its constructor definition, and if  the index method was defined it will be called as well. In our case, the  index method was defined so it will be called as well.  Example 2 – calling the controller and calc method  without arguments In this example, we enable the end user to call a specific class method but without  parameters, so that the default method parameters must be used via the browser.  Note that in order to use any CI helper function we need to make sure that it is either  autoloaded or specifically loaded in the controller  for the controller method's usage  or rendered views , library, or model.  <?PHP  echo anchor base_url  .' index.php my_handler calc ' ,'Press Me B' ; ?>  Note that in order to refer to a specific My_handler class method named calc, we  concatenated  calc after the class name. Issuing this view from a browser we will  get a result as follows: 2 * 2 = 4. Why?. This is simply because we define default values in the receiving controller method.  So that if no parameters are sent as in this example the default ones will be used,  which are both set to 2 and hence the class calc method will output 4.  Example 3 – calling the controller and calc method  with arguments In this example we enable the end user to call a specific class method with its  parameters via the browser.  <?PHP echo anchor base_url  .' index.php my_handler calc 5 7', 'Press Me  C', ; ?>  Issuing this from a browser, we will get: 5 * 7 = 35. Why?.  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  Since we provided 5 as the first parameter and 7 as the second, using the CI URI  naming convention of spectated   to pass parameter values to a called controller  class method. Since we use the parameters as integers for multiplication, PHP casts  them as integers, so we have 5 * 7 which is 35.  Note that in order to call a specific controller method with parameters, we add   the   separator after the method name followed by the parameters, and each  parameter is also separated by  .  To understand this better see the following use cases and their meanings, CI uses   the URI as follows:  When issuing the URI:    controller_name method_name param1 param2 ..  paramN  The controller named controller_name will be instanced by CI with the controller  constructor, and then the method method_name will be called with the first  parameter param1, second parameter param2, and so on. On the PHP controller side, the controller_name method prototype will look   like the following example:  Publicfunction method_name $user, $name, $email, $phone  {  So that $user = param1, $name = param2, and so on.  This is one possible way to get the parameters through a URL or get an array.   In CodeIgniter we don't have to get an array, so we can use the URI class to get the  parameters. For reference, see http:  ellislab.com codeigniter user-guide  libraries uri.html.  If we provide:    controller_name  The CI will execute only the controller constructor and the index   method,   if the controller has such a method.  If we provide:    controller_name method_name  [ 35 ]   Configurations and Naming Conventions  The preceding code will be executed without calling the index   method, following  the call of the specific method, method_name. Remember that we shall not use   in  our parameters for such a call and may wish to provide them using URL encode or  other reversible encoding methods. We can also call our controller method using  POST GET so that we can retrieve the parameter value posted in the class method   in the following way:  $param1_val = $this->input->post 'param1' ;  For example, within the class code we issue an AJAX call to a function as shown   in the next example.  Example 4 – calling AJAX to an AJAX-oriented  method with arguments In this example we enable the end user to issue an AJAX call to a specific class  method with its parameters enabled via HTTP POST.  <script src="https:  AJAX.googleapis.com AJAX libs jquery 1.8.1  jquery.min.js">       function AJAX_call    {   a_val  = $ '[name="a"]' .val  ; b_val  = $ '[name="b"]' .val  ; AJAX_url =   ' '; $.AJAX { type: "POST",  url : AJAX_url,  data:  {a : a_val,  b : b_val },  dataType: "json",  success: function data    {$ 'result' .html  data.result ; } } ;    AJAX Call end }         Enter A       Enter B      Result: The Result Will Be Shown Here           [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  Enter two numeric values for A and B and click on the Calculate button. We will get  the integer casted as A and multiply it by the integer casted as B in the div section  with id='result'.  Loading libraries, models, and helpers To reuse other libraries, models, and helper capabilities in our controller, we may  also want to load libraries and helpers to our controller or model class to reuse them  for our needs. In case we decide that certain helpers, libraries, or models are useful,  we will have them loaded automatically. We can do so in the autoload configuration  file named autoload.php located at application config autoload.php in   our project.  The following is an autoload configuration example:  $autoload['libraries'] = array 'template','database','session' ;  $autoload['helper'] =  array 'url', 'utilities' ;     Note: url helper provide base_url   service  Remember that if we want to load our helpers or libraries within a certain controller  or model, we can enable it as per the following example:  classMy_handler extends CI_Controller {  function __construct  {    see previous explanation on this parent call  parent::__construct  ;     Loadingspecific helperto enable calling     its functions in all this     controller class methods as well as in all     rendered views.    Note how the full name and path is abbreviated:  $this->load->helper 'ssl_helper' ;    Loading and instantiatinga library s    application librarues smart_handler.php to     enable calling all its class methods as from      this controller as well from all the rendered     by this controller. $this->load->library 'smart_handler'  ; } function enforce_ssl    {  [ 37 ]   Configurations and Naming Conventions  force_ssl  ;    A function in the ssl_helper for more see     helpers chapter } function smarty    {   call a method smart_service in the loaded   smart_handler library   for more see Libraries chapter $this->smart_handler->smart_service $param1, $param2 ;  }  }  End Controller My_handler  We shall call the method that uses the helper as follows:   index.php my_handler enforce_ssl  For smarty method calls in the loaded library, we use the following code:   index.php my_handler smarty  Passing parameters within a controller into a view, application controllers  my_controller.php as follows:  $array = array  'a' =>100,'b' =>200 ; $view_params = array   'param1' => 'hello world',   'param2' =>$array  ; $this->load_view 'my_view', $view_params ;  In the view file at application views: my_view.php, the view can use the provided  parameters in the following method:  <?PHP  echo $param1;   will echo hello world  Note that within the controller it is defined as the param1 key array element, where  the array is sent to the view.     To get the param2 values we shall perform :  foreach   $params2 as param  { echo param;      will echo 100 and 200 as $params2['a'] and     $params2['b'] values } ?>  [ 38 ]   Chapter 2  Miscellaneous naming conventions CI guidelines have some general naming conventions, such as the following:     Your classes, functions, and parameters should have short names, and if   constructed from several words they should use the underscore separator   as follows:    several lowercase words naming with under score get_file_properties  ;     When defining a string value, in case the string does not have a parameter    to evaluate, we shall use a single comma as follows: $my_string   = 'the string';      In case we want our string to have a parameter such as $name, we write   our string using double quotes: $name = 'big string parameter'; $my_string = "This is a $name ";     The Boolean and contacts all should be in upper case:  $this_vale = FALSE;    While in javascript we shall use true   false     to distinguish  For more general CI PHP style guide refer to http:  codeigniter.com user_ guide general styleguide.html.  Summary In this chapter we have reviewed and practiced CI naming conventions, rules, and  usage with a set of examples for parameters, classes, controllers, models, helpers,  libraries, and views.  Following the naming conventions we have reviewed CI configurations. We reviewed  the major configuration files, such as config.php, database.php, autoload.php, and  routes.php in depth. We also reviewed how we can use the configuration parameters  while configuring several databases to be used in our project. In addition to it we also  saw how we can add more project-specific configurations.  [ 39 ]    Controller Usage and Scope  This chapter covers the CI controller scope and the various controller usage  categories with several code examples of web applications. The controllers are the  front-line decision makers of how to process or route a request and how to respond  to actions, such as a rendered view sending back to the browser as an HTML page,  an AJAX response to let the current requesting page update certain selector areas   by the response, or even just to update the database seamlessly. The controllers   use the available models, helpers, libraries, and views to respond to the caller,   be it  a web browser URL or a cron process issuing the cURL types POST GET  requests automatically.  The CI built-in controller behaves like an abstract class in the project scope so any of  our project controllers must be extensions of a built-in CI controller. Our developed  controller will inherit the CI built-in controller capabilities and built-in resources,  such as auto-loaded helpers, libraries, and models, and let us code any specific  services as controller methods to address our project requirements, and rendering  the needs of the view.  As mentioned before, the controller is part of the MVC development framework   that operates with models, and applies business logic, which most commonly  renders a view back to the client web browser to proceed with user interaction.  The web user refers, via a browser, to a URL. In CI, the view is implemented as a call  to a CI controller method. The CI controller method processes the browser request and  sends back a rendered view that becomes a visualized web page to the browsing user.   Controller Usage and Scope  The web page received from the CI controller is referred to as the rendered controller  view; it may include anchors and buttons for the user to continue the interaction  with the controller. When the user clicks on an anchor in the browser, a call to a  controller is made  the anchor makes an HTTP request to activate a controller call .  In case the user issue a event such as Button clicking, operate scroll bars, and so on  so that this user event will trigger an action using jQuery to activate, for example a  jQuery callback function. The jQuery callback function may issue a call to another  rendering controller, such as :  $ location .attr 'href',controller_url_to_call ;  Another option is to activate an asynchronous AJAX calls to an AJAX controller.  Such a controller function handles the AJAX request that we will discuss later on.  When AJAX calls returned from the server , their returned data may be used by  client-side JavaScript to, update certain page regions   HTML selector s  of the   web page, for example, when typing a search string and issuing a search button,   the AJAX response will provide the search results to be visualized in the same   web page or will move to another page.  More on controllers in general can be found at http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Model-view-controller.  The following are the chapter topics and subtopics we will cover:     Scope of the CI controller    Usage categories:     Rendering views    Controllers serving browser AJAX requests    Controllers serving Linux scheduled cron execution requests     CI controller expansion and usage    Refer to Chapter 2, Configurations    and Naming Conventions, for more   Loading resources of models, helpers, and libraries        Using loaded resources    Calling CI controller methods     Example 1: the default home page controller    Example 2: sending e-mails with attachments    Example 3: admin and regular user log in  We will begin by briefly reviewing the scope and use cases of the application controller  in the CI framework and how we can use them for our project requirement needs.  [ 42 ]   Scope of the CI controller The CI controller is the hub and brain of the CI MVC that handles the HTTP requests,  such as those from the browser, and operates with other CI resources to respond.   The CI controller scope is described in the following figure and operates with other  CI resources to respond to the requests:  Chapter 3  The general flow with the CI controller is shown in the preceding figure. The user's  browser sends the HTTP request to the URL of the CI project. Initially, the requested  URL is processed via the routes based on the routes configuration  conf routes.php.  For more information, refer to Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming Conventions. The  specific CI controller is instantiated and the specific method is called. The CI method  may be assisted by any of the project resources, such as models, libraries, and helpers  for operations  business logic, and database queries . The CI controller generally uses   a view that defines a web page to be responded to via an HTTP response.  [ 43 ]   Controller Usage and Scope  The user-defined CI controller Each CI project must have one or more user-defined controllers in order to operate.  The user-defined controllers are the starting point of any CI user interaction. Calling  the controller and its methods can be done in several ways. The controller can be  called via project root URI submission to a browser  the project default controller  will be called , by issuing the user anchor from a rendered view, by a client-side  AJAX request for actions  updating page selectors , or even by a crontab  Linux  known scheduler service  scheduled action executed repeatedly as a URI of a certain  controller method.  We can see that the controller scope is a general manager of all the other project  resources, such as models, views, helpers, and libraries, governing all to address  execution requests from the user or a scheduled request.  Any application controller will be located under application controller  in the  project directory.  The controller can load other CI project code resources of libraries, models, and  helpers so that they can be accessed directly by the rendered views. This means  that, if a controller loaded a library, the rendered view PHP file can call the library  function in the exact same way as the controller does. The following is the code  resources that the controller can load:     application helpers: The helper s are built-in CI third-party,    or user-defined.     application models: The models are most commonly user-defined for the   specific database s and tables of the specific project, extending the built-in CI  model. Wrapping with CRUD service for specific defined database s table s,   but also can be third-party  for example, data mapper extensions that can be  used generically with any database .     application libraries: The library can be built-in, third-party,    or user-defined. The library is an Object Oriented PHP class-based service   that can provide some reusable services related to a specific project, or across  many projects. For example, as Flickr, Facebook, or LinkedIn wrapper API  libraries. A good practice is to define in addition to the third-party libraries  we may decide to use, our project oriented libraries to enhance our project  simplicity, and maintainability.  [ 44 ]   Extending the CI controller As we said, our application controller extends the built-in CI controller that is  something like an abstract class in the development scope, so that in order to use   the controller for our needs, we must build our controller extending the base class.  We can extend the CI controller in several ways.     Loading resources of helpers, models, and libraries:  Chapter 3          Those can be from the CI built-in repository, third-party developed,  or self-developed. For more information on how to self-develop  models, refer to Chapter 6, Models, on how to self-develop libraries,  refer to Chapter 4, Libraries, and on how to self-develop helpers, refer  to Chapter 5, Helpers. The controller can load any of the external resources in the following  fashion in any of its methods, commonly at the contractor and in  case the resource is required in all the controllers via the autoload. php configuration file      refer to Chapter 3, Configurations and Naming  Conventions for more information . However, for the best resource  optimization to minimize the footprint and overhead even better, the  resources will be loaded only on those controller methods that need  their services to operate.  The following are a few examples of how to load the mentioned resources: $this->load->model 'some_model' ; $this->load->library 'some_library', $keyed_array ; $this->load->helper 'some_helper' ;     Adding public and private methods:      This approach is the common guideline of PHP OOP that you are  expected to be familiar with  although elaboration on this can be  found at http:  php.net . The following is a simple example of  how a public method calls a private method to get some data:  public function get_something    {   $some_data= $this->_get_it   ;   } private function _get_it    {   return= 'hello';   }  [ 45 ]   Controller Usage and Scope     Using loaded resources:  The loaded resources can be used after loading as follows:     Using loaded model methods:  $status= $this->some_model->save_data $table, $row ;  $rows= $this->some_model->get_table $table_name ;     Using loaded library methods:  $another_data = $this->some_library->method $some_data ;     Using loaded helpers:  $your_ip =get_your_ip  ;     myhtml_helper function    NOTE: a helper defines regular functions!     Calling a controller:      The controller is automatically instantiated by the CI core, and its  methods are called via HTTP URIs. For more information, refer to  Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming Conventions.     Ways to call a controller:  Calling only the contractor and later calling the index method,   if defined as follows: $URI = "base_url  .' mycontroller';  mycontroller'; Calling the method of the mycontroller class without parameters:  $URI = "base_url.' mycontroller mymethod'; Calling the method of the mycontroller class with two parameters,  a and b: $URI = "base_url.' mycontroller mymethod a b';  CI controller use cases There are several different use cases for a CI user-defined controller. Commonly, the  CI controller will handle initiating rendering HTML pages, enable us to let the user  navigate and view the different web application pages we defined. However, the  controller may also provide other services, such as AJAX server-side controller, serving  asynchronously the client-side browser requests, and commonly return back the JSON  formatted data instead of a rendered view. The exact scope and usage of AJAX is   not part of the CI framework, but it is very useful standard de-facto technology.   To learn more about AJAX, please refer to AJAX  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML   on Wikipedia http:  en.wikipedia.org.  [ 46 ]   Chapter 3  The main usage categories for our controller in a CI framework are as follows:     Rendering views: These type of controllers mostly performs some   preparations for data and render the requested view, along with the  prepared data, to be displayed to the user for the next user session state   with web application.      A special case is the home page view rendering. So that the user refers    to the Project root directory via URI such as:  http:  mydomain.com my_ci_project.      Where the CI routes will define maincontroller as the home page or default   controller as follows under the project root:application config routes. php. So that the default controller will be defined as follows: $route ['default_controller'] = "maincontroller";     Then the call to   http:  mydomain.com my_ci_project will be routed by the CI routes  to   http:  mydomain.com my_ci_project maincontroller For user navigation request to another page, we shall have in the rendered  view, HTML anchors for navigating into another pages something like the  following view code:  <?PHP echo anchor      site_url  .' pages_controller page_b',       'Navigate me to page B' ; ?>     Controller serving the browser AJAX requests. These controllers respond to   the AJAX client requests. and most commonly return the JSON data to the  calling jQuery script as follows:   function autocomplete clue_val  {   varurl = '<?php echo site_url  ;       ?> AJAX_controller autocomplete_name';   $AJAX  {type: "POST", url: url, data: {clue: clue_val},     dataType: "json", success: function data  {          show the data of matching names       }     return;     } ;  [ 47 ]   Controller Usage and Scope     Controller serving Linux scheduled cron requests: A very powerful CI usage  we found is serving Linux cron schedule requests defined in the Linux cron   for more information about Linux cron scheduling, please refer to   http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cron . We can find, within the DirectAdmin apache admin tool, a UI editor   to define the scheduled crontab repeatable actions we want the server   to perform. For each request, we will define the PHP processor path; for example,  user  local bin php, as well as the PHP script to be executed; for example,   home mysite.com public_html crontabs ci_crontab.php. ci_crontab.php can execute the CI controller method. http:  myCIproject mycontroller mymethod will, for example, scan the  database and update a table named sums_table, which contains the number  of rows in all the tables added together after every execution. Let us see an  example of how to make that CI controller call from the PHP script. In order to call a CI controller via an HTTP request, ci_crontab.php will use  the cURL service that will call the CI controller, similar to the way we issue  it from a browser  cURL  Client URLs , http:  php.net manual en ref. curl.php . Let's build  home mysite.com public_html crontabs ci_crontab.php. Linux crontab will call every defined action repeatedly. The code of ci_crontab.php will be something like the following code: <?PHP function file_get_contents_curl $url  {   $ch = curl_init  ;   curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0 ;   curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1 ;   curl_setopt $ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url ;   $data = curl_exec $ch ;   curl_close $ch ;   return $data;   } $http_to_execut='http:  myCIproject mycontroller mymethod'; $result = file_get_contents_curl  $http_to_execute ;  The $result will be the rendered output from the controller, mostly simple  echoed messages such as Processed 127 entries. Sure, we can log the  result every time and append it to a log file of the action logs performed. We just saw how we can use the CI controller to serve Linux cron services,  which has a very powerful capability in many business cases.  [ 48 ]   Chapter 3  Example 1 – default homepage controller Initially, we will start with a simple controller example that opens a home page with  the navigation option back and forth to another page B, and similarly to the home  page. We will do so while rendering some controller calculated data at the view.  This example doesn't use the database. This example will be built from the following  CI framework component configuration, controller, and view files.  Let us define the default controller filename as controller home_page.php and the  home page view as views home_page_view.php. Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject.  The controller file The controller file  home_page.php will prepare some data to be shown in the view  and will let the user navigate to page B and similarly back to the home page.   The helpers used are provided with the sample source code provided with this book.  The following is the code:  <?php class Home_page extends CI_Controller {   function __construct   {     parent::__construct  ;     $this->load->helper  'validators_helper' ;     $this->load->helper  'dates_time_helper' ;     }   public function index   {     $data = array   ;     $data ['email'] = $email = "the@email.com";        validators_helpercalls     $data ['email_valid'] = isValidEmail $email ;     $data ['url'] = $url = "http:  cnn.com";     $data ['url_valid'] = isValidURL $url ;     $data ['url_exist'] = isURLExists $url ;     $this->load->view 'home_page_view', $data ;     }   publicfunction page_b    {     $data = array   ;     $myqsl_date = "1970-01-01";        dates_time_helper calls  [ 49 ]   Controller Usage and Scope      $data ['since'] = ui_date  $myqsl_date ;     $data ['past'] = getAgeAccurate          $myqsl_date, $percision = 2 ;     $this->load->view  'page_b_view', $data ;     }   }    End controller  The view file The controller file will prepare the current date and time to be shown in the home  page views home_page_view.php view.      <?PHP  * data from controller $email, $email_valid, $url, $url_valid , $url_exist *  $validation_text =  $email_valid  ? "Is Valid ": "Is Not Valid!"; $validation_url =  $url_valid  ? "Is Valid ": "Is Not Valid!"; $exist_url =  $url_exist  ? "Exist ": "Not exist!"; ?>    Main Page       The Email:              The url:    and         "_blank",     "title" => "opens a new Tab"  ; ?>                [ 50 ]   The controller has a page_b   method to render the following view file. It will  prepare the parameters $since and $past for this page to be used inline in the  rendered view page_b_view, as follows: The view file is views page_b_view.php.  Chapter 3      <?PHP  * data from controller $since, $past *  ?>    Page B         Since:   past  years               The configuration file Initially, we shall define at application config routes.php the default controller   to be called.  For example, $route['default_controller'] = "home_page";.  So that in case, you will issue URI of the project root in the browser, lets say:   http:  mydomain.com myproject  http:  mydomain.com myproject home_page will be called.  Optionally we can configure CI to eliminate the need to use index.php as part of  the URI path to call our CI project controller s   Refer for information, to Chapter 2,  Configurations and Naming Conventions .  [ 51 ]   Controller Usage and Scope  Example 2 – sending e-mails with  attachments In this example, we will see how the controller can load a mail service library and  use it to send mail attachments.  The CI mail library is not an auto-loaded library, and hence, will be loaded by the  controller we are building for sending e-mail.  The CI mail library makes it easy to send subject messages of non-English languages  supporting UTF-8 both for the subject and the mail body. Adding attachments to an  e-mail becomes a piece of cake using the CI mail library. We only need to have the files  on a known directory path in our server and refer to them to attach them to the mail.  We can attach one or more files to create the mail body. HTML TEXT is defined via  a simple configuration setting to the CI mail library.  This example will be constructed from the mail controller only; you may add a  rendered view later on to add to the example report on the mailing list, sending   a report of a list of e-mail destinations instead of just one or two destinations.  Let us specify the default controller filename as controller mail. Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject.  Hence, the URI to execute the controller for sending the mail will be http:   mydomain.com myproject mail.  We shall remember that in CodeIgniter, if you refer only to the controller URI path,  the CI will operate the function controller class index  function, if any. In case the  controller class does have index  function. And actually in any case, the controller  constructor will be called to create the class instance.  The controller file The controller file, controller email.php, will initially load the CI mail library,  then it will configure the mail service properties, such as from to e-mail address,  subject, HTML body, and the attachment files. Finally, the controller will issue the  e-mail send service of the library, getting back the operation completion status to  report to the web user. In case of a failure, the controller will render a report for the  reason of the failure with debugging information provided by the CI mail library.  The helpers used are provided with the sample  source code provided with this book.  [ 52 ]   Chapter 3  Since this controller example has several functions, we shall review their usage  initially, before we review the code as follows:     __construct  : This contractor loads the CI e-mail library to be used    by other functions     index  : This builds the e-mail message and sends it to its destination    doc_root_path  : This provides the directory path to find the e-mail   attachments to send  Regarding the need to load resources such as libraries, helpers, and models, the  best practice is the amount of usage in our controller. Let's say, for example, that we  have 40 controllers and 39 of them need the same library. We shall add that library  into the auto-load list,  config autoload.php. If we did add a resource, such as a  library, model, or helper into the project auto-load, we can eliminate loading it in the  class that needs the resource services as follows:  class Email extends CI_Controller    The controller email.php file will contain this class {   function __construct     {        call the parent constructor to inherit all its services     parent::__construct  ;        Loads the CI e-mail library, so that it will be instantiated          and its methods will be accessed, as $this->mail->METHOD_NAME.     $this->load->library 'email' ;     }      Define the controller methodindex  the default method , so that  referring to the URI mydomain.com myproject email will execute the  index method call   function index   {        Configure the library to work with UTF-8 strings          multi-language support, as well as enable HTML content body.     $config['charset'] = 'utf-8';     $config['mailtype'] = 'html';             Loads the configuration settings by initialize method     $this->email->initialize $config ;        Since the mail body is HTML, define CR LF to be          replaced with HTML       $this->email->set_newline " " ;        Define the 'From' Email address     $this->email->from 'eliorr@phpmyqsl.com', 'Eli Orr' ;       [ 53 ]   Controller Usage and Scope         Define the 'To' Email s     $this->email->to  array '"Name 1"  ',         '"Name 2"  '  ;        Set the e-mail subject     $this->email->subject          "This is the Subject – can be ANY UTF-8 chars" ;        Define the e-mail body in HTML format, as we set the message       to be HTML typed     $this->email->message      ' Hello there!            This Email is sent from CI via its cool e-mail library         See Attached Files        Attachedfiles:               1 - File One.        2 - Second File              ;             Load the attachments     $path = $this->doc_root_path   ;        Doc root For example,  home yourdomain.com public_html        Let say attachment under public_html as  attachments     $attachment_path1 = $path." attachments file1.jpg";     $attachment_path2 = $path." attachments file2.php";             Set the two attachment file paths     $this->email->attach $attachment_path1 ;     $this->email->attach $attachment_path2 ;             We have the e-mail object ready! Let us send it!        execute send and check the result status     if  $this->email->send        {          The e-mail was sent successfully.       echo 'Your email was sent!';       }     else {          We had some problems, let's show what was wrong       echo $this->email->print_debugger  ;       }     }   functiondoc_root_path    {  [ 54 ]          An auxiliary method for calculating attachment          file path in our server      return $doc_root = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"];     }   }  Chapter 3  Example 3 – admin and regular user   log in In this example we will see how the controller can coordinate using models and  views a login session for a regular user, as well as an admin super user, so that each  will have a distinct menu. In order to use the provided database file and successfully  log in, use the following steps:    For regular user login:    User: reg_user     Password: 111111111  9 x 1 s      For admin user login:     User: admin_user     Password: 111111111  9 x 1 s   This example will be constructed from the following controller, models, and views:     application controller auth.php: This controller is used to control   authentication checkup and redirect each user category to its view or notify  of a login failure. Regular users and admin users will have different view  menu, message, and logout options.     application models users_model.php: This is the model to validate the   submitted user name and password  stored in the database via MD5  against  the predefined database table of users.     application views login_view.php: This is the view shown to users that   are not logged in, in order to log in.     application views logged_in_view.php: This is the view shown to users   that were successfully logged in and performed their roles as reg_user  admin users.     MySQL database- USERS_DB.sql: This is a database table that we will   upload to our database.  [ 55 ]   Controller Usage and Scope  Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject.  Hence the URI to execute the auth controller for login will be http:  mydomain. com myproject auth.  The controller file The controller file, controller auth.php, will initially load the CI form helper;  this helper will be used to construct and operate the login form. For more on helper  usage and scope, refer to Chapter 5, Helpers. users_model, written especially to serve the controller for authenticating users  credentials against the user table, will be loaded. The controller auth index will   be called from both the initial stage as well as after a login_view submission.  The session is a well known issue in PHP and is out of the scope of this book.  However, CI enables the storing of operated sessions with served clients via the  database in a table named ci_sessions. This way the sessions are much more organized for the project to manipulate with  search session and load session parameter. In order to use a database stored session,  we shall edit  config config.php.  $config['sess_use_database'] = TRUE;  * Enforce storing sessions data in the database *   Also, we will add a session library as we want to use it for this example along   with other commonly used  config autoload.php libraries.  $autoload['libraries'] = array     'database', 'session', 'xmlrpc' ;  In case of a submission, the input post for the password will not be null and the  controller will proceed with the credentials checkup using the users_model model.  If successful, the user record fields will be kept in the session and the controller  methods auth admin_main_menu or auth user_main_menu will be called as per  the model returned user role. If the logged in user issues the logout anchor, auth  logout will be called to destroy the session and redirect the user to the login form.  The following is the code:  class Auth extends CI_Controller {   function __construct   {     parent::__construct     $this->load->helper  'form' ;     $this->load->model  'users_model' ;  [ 56 ]   Chapter 3      }      called with auth is called with no specific method and        simply calls the login method   function index   {     $this->login  ;     }   functionlogin     {        The message to user in case of login failure     $msg = "";     if  $this->input->post 'password'       {          The caller is from the form submission           we will check credentials validity using the local method            check_login.       $stat = $this->check_login  ;          Extract failure message to user if any       $msg = $stat ['msg' ];       if $stat['result'] == 'ok'        {            Successful login!            See what We have            admin_user or regular user?         if  $this->session->userdata  'role'  == 'admin_user'             Issue the controller for admin user main menu         redirect 'auth admin_main_menu' ;         else            Issue regular user main menu controller         redirect 'auth user_main_menu' ;         return;         }       }     else {          rendered with no submission           let's destroy any previous session and challenge again            the user       $this->session->sess_destroy  ;       }        We can get here due to login failure or referring to auth          controller without any active submission.        Keep the msg return from the model into view view_setup     ['msg'] = $msg;         render the login view to challenge the user     $this->load->view 'login_view.php', $view_setup ;     }  [ 57 ]   Controller Usage and Scope    functioncheck_login   {        Extract the credentials from the submitted login_viewform     $user_name = $this->input->post 'user_name' ;     $password = $this->input->post 'password' ;        init an array to return     $ret = array   ;        Check if login is ok and get the $row using the loaded          users_model model.     $user_record = $this->users_model->check_login          $user_name, $password ;     if  $user_record  {          User passed credentials checkup successfully          We have the user record. Let's use it to extract info            for the logged session buildup       $this->session->set_userdata  'user_id', $user_record->id ;       $this->session->set_userdata  'user_name',           $user_record->user_name ;       $this->session->set_userdata  'role', $user_record->role ;       $ret ['result'] = 'ok'; $ret ['msg' ] = 'Logged-in!';       }     else {        login failed!     $ret ['result'] = 'notok';        inform the login form to alert user for the failure     $ret ['msg' ] = 'Invalid User Pass - Try Again!';     }   return $ret;   }    logout method called auth logout function logout   {      destroy the current session   $this->session->sess_destroy  ;   redirect 'auth' ;   } functionadmin_main_menu   {      Shall render an admin main menu page   $view_setup ['uid'] = $this->session->userdata  'user_id' ;   $view_setup ['user_name'] = $this->session->userdata        'user_name' ;   $view_setup ['role'] = $this->session->userdata  'role' ;   $view_setup ['menu'] = "Add User Modify User Delete User";   $this->load->view  'logged_in_view.php', $view_setup ;   }  functionuser_main_menu   {      Shall render a regular user   $view_setup ['uid'] = $this->session->userdata  'user_id' ;  [ 58 ]   Chapter 3    $view_setup ['user_name']= $this->session->userdata        'user_name' ;   $view_setup ['role']= $this->session->userdata  'role' ;   $view_setup ['menu']= "View Content Modify Your Account Logout";   $this->load->view  'logged_in_view.php', $view_setup ;   } }  The model file The model file application models users_model.php will serve the controller   for authenticating user credentials against the user table. If successful, the model   will return the user database row to the caller.  auth admin_main_menu or auth user_main_menu will be called as per the model  returned user role. If the logged in user issues the logout anchor, auth logout will  be called to destroy the session and redirect the user to the login form.  The following is the code:  class Users_model extends CI_Model {   function __construct     {     parent::__construct  ;     }   functioncheck_login  $user, $pass    {      Important notice.      Since the model extends the base CI model, it already got the        instance. However, we can use the $ci = &get_instance  ; instead        $this-> anywhere in helpers, libraries, and so on.      convert the typed password in the login form to md5, same as        we do, when opening a user account.   $md5_pass = md5 $pass ;      build up the query    $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_name = '$user'     AND password = '$md5_pass' ";   $q = $this->db->query $sql ;   if  $q->num_rows    {     foreach  $q->result   as $row      return $row;     }      In case no num_rows: return NULL;   } }  [ 59 ]   Controller Usage and Scope  The database file to upload for this example We shall upload this database file, provided as part of the book resources, into our  database connected to CI. The user table includes two users, namely reg_user and admin_user. Their  passwords are stored as the md5 of the text passwords, where 111111111 and  222222222 are the passwords of the reg_user and admin_user users.  The following is the code:  -- phpMyAdmin SQL Dump -- http:  www.phpmyadmin.net SET SQL_MODE="NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO"; SET time_zone = "+00:00"; -- -- Table structure for table `users` -- CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `users`     `id` int 11  NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,   `user_name` varchar 128  NOT NULL,   `password` varchar 128  NOT NULL,   `role` varchar 128  NOT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY  `id`      ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT = 3; -- -- Dumping data for table users -- INSERT INTO `users`  `id`, `user_name`, `password`, `role`  VALUES  1, 'reg_user', 'bbb8aae57c104cda40c93843ad5e6db8',     'regular_user' ,  2, 'admin_user',     '0d777e9e30b918e9034ab610712c90cf', 'admin_user' ;  The login_view view file The login_view view is rendered by the application auth index index method  in order to show non-logged in web visitors to a login page, to enable to challenge  them with a login stage.  Following a user entering the user name and password and submitting the   login_view view form the application auth login will be called and will   check the credentials using the users model. In case of a successful login, and   based on the logged in user category fetch from the users model, one of the   auth methods will be called as follows:  [ 60 ]   Chapter 3     auth admin_main_menu: In case the user has the admin role to render the   successful login view for the admin user     auth user_main_menu: In case the user has the admin role to render the   successful login view for the regular user  The view is located at application views login_view.php. This view uses   many of the CI form helper functions loaded by the auth controller. When a user  issues a submission, the input is initially checked at the client side before issuing   a submission call to application auth.  The following is the code:    <meta http-equiv = "Content-type" content = "text html;     charset=utf-8" >     <script src = http:  code.jquery.com jquery-latest.js     type = 'text javascript'>       Login Here    <?php    Define the form attributes    We will use the 'form' helper 'auth' will      be called on submission only, if check_if_valid       will return true! $submit_attributes = array     'onsubmit' =>"return check_if_valid  ;", 'id' => 'auth' ; echoform_open 'auth', $submit_attributes ; echo "   ";    The attributes of the   echoform_label "User Name" ; echo "  "; echoform_input array 'name' => 'user_name', 'value' => ''  ; echo "  ";     The error message holders – hidden by default echo      name is too short  "; echo "    '; echoform_label "Password" ; echo "  "; echoform_password "password","" ; echo "  ";    The error message holders – hidden by default echo       password is too short  ";  [ 61 ]   Controller Usage and Scope  echo "  "; echo " ";    The submit button echo form_input array 'type' => 'submit', 'value' =>'Login'  ; echoform_close  ; ?>                functioncheck_if_valid   {   var submit = true;   varuser_name = $ '[name="user_name"]' .val  ;   var password = $ '[name="password"]' .val  ;   if  user_name.length< 2  {     $ 'user_name_err' .show  ;     submit = false;     }   else $ 'user_name_err' .hide  ;   if  password.length< 6  {     $ 'password_err' .show  ;     submit = false;     }   else $ 'password_err' .hide  ;   return submit;   }      The login_in_view view file The login_in_view view is rendered following a successful login by either  application auth admin_main_menu controller method or application auth  user_main_menu method base on the user category with the info of the logged   in user. Both the controllers uses the users_model model to validate the login attempt   and fetch the  logged in user. The view shows the logged in user some information  about its account, such as the user name and role as well as the menu available for   its user category.  The view is located at application views login_in_view.php. This view is using  parameters provided by the $user_nam, $uid, $role, and $menu controller to be  shown to the logged in user. From this view, the user may issue a logout anchor   that calls auth logout to destroy the session and redirect the logged in user to the  login view.  [ 62 ]   Many of the CI form helper functions are loaded by the auth controller. When   user issues are submitted, the input is initially checked at the client side before  issuing a submission call to application auth.  The following is the code:  Chapter 3    <meta http-equiv = "Content-type" content = "text html;     charset  <meta http-equiv = "Content-type" content = "text html;     charset=utf-8" >      Welcome  !

We have reviewed the various resources  that the controller can be assisted with, such as the helpers, libraries, and models.  Eventually, we have made several usage examples as follows:     Example 1: default home page controller    Example 2: sending e-mails with attachments    Example 3: admin and regular user log in  [ 63 ]    Libraries  This chapter covers the CI libraries topic, and the different types of libraries and their  different usage categories, with several code examples of web applications. The CI  development platform provides us with the built-in libraries, enables us with an easy  procedure to integrate third-party libraries, and also allows us to develop our new  libraries and share them with the community, if we wish to.  The CI libraries are powering efficiency, code reusability, separation, and simplicity.  The benefits achieved are as follows:     Efficiency: In means of minimal loaded resources. This feature achieved   by the fact that the CI library, may be loaded only by the specific CI project  controller s , or even only in specific method s , where the library's services  are required. Hence, the overhead  memory  of the library resources during  execution time is minimized in each controller operation state.     Reusability: Reusability means writing once a function code and reusing  it across the project resources. The libraries can be loaded by any project  controller, model, or helper  in a helper, we shall use the &get_instance    method discussed several times before  to reuse their code anywhere in  the CI project. More than that, the controller-rendered views can call those  loaded library methods. Hence, great code reusability is achieved.     Separation: Separation prevents, accidental overlapping with same name  to the parameters or functions elsewhere in the project. The Library class  methods and parameters have their own name space so that they can't be  overridden by a mistake outside the library in case the developer is using   the same parameters in the served module such as controllers views.     Simplicity: This make the code text as minimal as possible and easy to  understand and maintain. The libraries' methods called from the served  resources, such as controllers, models, and helpers, make the code look   much simpler, and make it easy to maintain and navigate. Hence, this  simplifies extending the code and maintaining it.   Libraries  The libraries give us development power and efficiency with rich-focused functionality  on certain project aspects, and also enable us to have simple and concise fashion code  in the served controllers by calling the library method, instead of having the service  code locally in the controller. The libraries should be initially instantiated by the code  using them, such as the controller, model, or helper, or if used by almost all controllers,  models can be loaded using the autoload mechanism. Chapter 2, Configurations and  Naming Conventions, discusses how to autoload the libraries.  Once instantiated by the autoload or controller constructor, the libraries can be   used by the controller methods or by rendered views. In addition, any model, helper,  or another library may use our project installed libraries using &get_instance  ,   as described in the previous chapters.  The libraries power the code of the CI model-view-controller instantiated  components  for more information, visit the website http:  en.wikipedia.org  wiki Model-view-controller , regarding the functionality expansion   and reusability across the project controllers, models, helpers, and views.  This chapter will primarily focus on the following topics:     The CI libraries' scope and usage:     Usage categories    Using a library     Adding a library to the project       Using library method s   Instantiating a library     Available CI libraries     Examples:                Example 1: using the built-in libraries Example 2: using third-party libraries such as the Google Maps CI  library wrapper Example 3: building our own library such as the Flickr API wrapper Example 4: building our own library such as the LinkedIn   API wrapper  We will begin by briefly reviewing what a library in a CI framework is, and how   we can use it for our needs across the project code resources.  [ 66 ]   Chapter 4  The CI libraries' scope and usage The CI library does not have access to the controller resources by default unless   the CI $ci = &get_instance   is called and $ci is used instead of $this to access  the CI resources, for example, instead of $this->db->query  $sql , we shall  use $ci->db->query  $sql , and so on. We can extend the CI library using the  third-party libraries from where CI echo system  the CI community of developers  worldwide share knowledge, sources, and solutions for code and open issues ,   or develop our own libraries from scratch or extending other libraries. Any application library will be located under application libraries  in the  project's directory. In addition, optional resources such as the library configuration  file that is required for library configurations can be placed under the project root  or elsewhere. A good practice is to place them under the project root for enhanced  security provided by CI. For example,  application config <LIB_ NAME>_config.php, or even additional resources such as the images CSS HTML  additional class libraries may be required under another application <LIB_ ADDITIONAL_RESOURCES>, such as application assets.  The library integration and the usage within the CI project are as follows:     Adding the library code resources to application libraries my_lib.php,   optionally adding related resources, if any, such as a library configuration  file, and or other library assets to their locations as mentioned before. Instantiating the library class via config autoload, or instantiating it via   the controller.         Automatically load a library my_lib for the entire CI project:  $autoload['libraries'] = array 'database','my_lib' ;      Specifically in certain controller s , constructor s , or method s :  $this->load->library 'my_lib' ;     Using the library methods:  $result=$this->my_lib->called_method  $param1, $param2 ;     We can see the library scope as the ultimate OOP reusability enabler for   the entire project code resources' models, views, helpers, and libraries,   which govern all to address the execution requests from the user, or a  scheduled request.  [ 67 ]   Libraries  As mentioned, the CI libraries enables us with great Separation and Simplicity.   For example, the following code:     Library class class my_handler {   private $my_lib_param;      Can't be accessed outside the class directly      but we can provide the read only service as follows:    public function get_my_lib_param    {     return $this->my_lib_param;}      The following is a library function that can't       be called from outside the class!      private function my_private_function    { }   }  Available CI libraries CI and the CI echo system of developers provide many libraries covering a rich   set of topics. We will review the CI libraries as well as known resources for the   third-party CI libraries.  We are also encouraged to build our own libraries that can be used by others,   and share them with the community, such as:     The Git community at https:  github.com    CI Sparks at http:  getsparks.org    CI Forums at http:  codeigniter.com forums    Packagist at https:  packagist.org  To call a built-in library, we shall call for example, the built-in library named   CI_Xxxx as follows: $this->load->library  xxxx ;. So that CI_ prefix is not   used and instead of the capitalized library name Xxxx, we use the lowercase library  name xxxx. For calling a library function yyyy within the library CI_Xxxx, we shall  write $this->xxxx->yyyy  ;.  The following is a list of built-in and commonly useful CI libraries    As of version 2.1.4 :  [ 68 ]   CI_Benchmark CI_Cache CI_Cache_apc CI_Cache_dummy  CI_Encrypt CI_Exceptions CI_Form_validation CI_FTP  CI_Migration CI_Model CI_Output CI_Pagination CI_User_  CI_Unit_test CI_Upload CI_URI  CI_Cache_file CI_Cache_memcached CI_Calendar CI_Cart CI_Config CI_Controller CI_Driver  CI_Hooks CI_Image_lib CI_Input CI_Javascript CI_Jquery CI_Lang CI_Loader  CI_Parser CI_Profiler CI_Router CI_Security CI_Session CI_SHA1 CI_Table  CI_Driver_Library  CI_Log  CI_Trackback  Chapter 4  agent CI_Utf8 CI_Xmlrpc CI_Xmlrpcs CI_Zip  In this chapter, we will provide a usage example for Google Maps' third-party   library wrapper, available at https:  github.com ianckc CodeIgniter-Google- Maps-Library.  Many more third-party libraries can be found following the CI forums at   http:  codeigniter.com forums.  Example 1 – using the built-in libraries In this initial example, we will see how to use the CI built-in library. Here we will  use the CI library CI_Table as well as the CI_db library, which, for a given database  table view and some optional CSS settings, will enable us to render the table nicely  with all the HTML table tags and CSS settings in just a single line of code. In this  example, we will use the same user's table that we used for the controller example   in Chapter 3, Usage and Scope of Controllers.  This example will be constructed from the following controller and view:     application controllers builtins.php: This controller loads the   built-in CI library table as well as the db library, which is autoloaded    for more information, refer to Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming  Conventions  to get the user's table content, and set up the table to   render using the table library. $this->load->library 'table' ;  [ 69 ]   Libraries  The controllers prepare vectors of map settings and the list of places   and possible controllers to zoom into each of the places, and render   a view named  google_map_view.     application views users_view.php: This view will use the table library  service to render a nicely formatted table as loaded from db, and configured  by the controller.  Let us assume that the URL to the project root is http:  mydomain. com myproject, http:  mydomain.com myproject builtins.  The source code is provided with this book via URLs.   The controller file The following is a step-by-step example of the controller code for each operation:  <?php   ** Use CI built In libraries class Builtins extends CI_Controller{   function __construct  {     parent::__construct  ;        Load the table library that generates the HTML tags for         showing the table structure within a view     $this->load->library 'table' ;     }   public function index  {        Load the users list from DB into the view      $data['users'] = $this->db->get 'users' ;        Create custom header for the table      $header = array      'id', 'User Name', 'Hashed Password', 'Position'  ;        Set the headings     $this->table->set_heading $header ;        Set table formatting      $table_format = array   'table_open'  => '<table border="1"        cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" class="mytable">'  ;     $this->table->set_template $table_format ;        Load the view and send the results     $this->load->view 'users_view', $data ;     }   }  [ 70 ]   Chapter 4  The view file To complete the operation, we will finish working on the view file.    <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text html;    charset=utf-8" >         Showing Users Table Using CI Build-In table Library             <!—All The Formatted Table is rendered by the table library      instance using the controller defined settings and the table        of users we have fetched from the DB >    table->generate $users ; ?>          Example 2 – using third-party libraries  such as the Google Maps CI library  wrapper In this example, we will see how to install and use the Google Maps CI library   with some cool services. First, we need to download the library files from   http:  biostall.com codeigniter-google-maps-v3-api-library.  In the downloaded TAR file, we shall find the following libraries:     Googlemaps.php: This is the Google Maps API library for CI. We shall place   it at application libraries .     Jsmin.php: This is an auxiliary code for the library to generate the JavaScript  generated code for enabling the smart Google Maps UI interaction. We shall  also place it at application libraries .     Google Maps V3 API: This is a PDF file for in-depth, possible library settings   and usage.  [ 71 ]   Libraries  In this example, we will provide an initial page showing several marked places  together on the Google Map window that we will create in our application. In that  visualized view, we will enable the user to zoom into predefined selected places we  have marked on the map using the CI anchor URL helper.  This example will be constructed from the following library, controller, and view:     application libraries : This is the CI wrapper library for Google   Maps that we downloaded. Refer to the CI library contributor website   at http:  biostall.com.     application controllers gmaps.php: This controller loads the   googlemaps library and builds up several views for several places shown  together on the Google Map, and zooms in to each of the places. $this->load->library 'googlemaps' ;  The controllers prepare vectors of map settings and the list of places and  possible controllers to zoom into each of the places, and render a view named   google_map_view.     application views google_map_view.php: This is the rendered view that   initially shows all the places on the Google Map, and lets the user zoom in  using a menu option to a listed zoom-in location, or go back to the view of   all the places together on a zoom-out map.  Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject.  http:  mydomain.com myproject gmaps.  The source code is provided with this book via URLs.  The controller file The controller file controllers gmaps.php will initially load the CI Google Maps  library, then set up the maps' settings and the places to be marked and shown in  different views  the same view file is rendered with different $data settings each  time . The controller will have the __construct   and index   methods,   in addition to set the zoom in on the defined places.  <?php  ** Use The Google Maps CI Library Wrapper for several    marked places altogether and zoom-in*  class Gmaps extends CI_Controller {   function __construct    [ 72 ]   Chapter 4  = "1000px";    {  parent::__construct  ;     $this->load->library 'googlemaps' ;        Set the map window sizes:     $config['map_width']         map window width     $config['map_height'] = "1000px";        map window height     $this->googlemaps->initialize $config ;   }   function index   {      * Initialize and setup Google Maps for our App starting        with 3 marked places     London, UK, Bombai, India, Rehovot, Israel     *         Initialize our map for this use case of show 3         places altogether.        let the zoom be automatically decided by Google for showing         the several places on one view.     $config['zoom'] = "auto";     $this->googlemaps->initialize $config ;       Define the places we want to see marked on Google Map!     $this->add_visual_flag  'London, UK' ;     $this->add_visual_flag  'Bombai, India' ;     $this->add_visual_flag  'Rehovot, Israel' ;     $data = $this->load_map_setting   ;        Load our view, passing the map data that has just been        created.     $this->load->view 'google_map_view', $data ;   }     The class Gmaps continued with several more functions as      follows:   function london   {        Initialize our map       Here you can also pass in additional parameters for         customizing the map  see the following code:         Define the address we want to be on the map center     $config['center'] = 'London, UK'; to be on the map center        Set Zoom Level - Zoom 0: World – 18 Street Level     $config['zoom'] = "16";     $this->googlemaps->initialize $config ;        Add visual flag     $this->add_visual_flag  $config['center'] ;     $data = $this->load_map_setting   ;        Load our view passing the map data that has just been        created  [ 73 ]   Libraries      $this->load->view 'google_map_view', $data ;   }   functionBombay   {     Initialize our map.

The API is extremely rich, and its  documentation is available at http:  www.flickr.com services api , and is  called App Garden. The API is enabled for various programming languages and access methods.   We will build a solution of a wrapper that can be expanded to get any Flickr   API service, using the PHP REST access method.  This example will be constructed from the following library, controller, and view:    application libraries flickr_wrapper.php: The is the CI wrapper  library that enables smooth Flickr API access via CI. This basic services  library can be expanded to support the entire Flickr App Garden.     application controllers flickr_recent.php: This is the controller    that uses the flickr_wrapper library that we wrote and pulls the   recent public photos uploaded with the EXIF photo info and the  photographer-related information.     application views flickr_recent_view.php: This is the view that    shows the collected information of recent photos and photographers.  [ 76 ]   Chapter 4  Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject.  Hence, the URI to execute the auto controller for logging in will be http:   mydomain.com myproject flickr_recent.  The flickr_wrapper.php library file The application libraries flickr_wrapper.php library file contains the library  flickr_wrapper class library that we are building and using to access the Flickr  App Garden API. It is mandatory to load this library with a valid Flickr api_key that  you can get by following the Flickr App Garden documentation. The library will use  the PHP REST API access, so that we can later expand any of the Flickr API services  to be supported with our library. Each of the library methods returns   a multidimensional keyed array of the resultant data.

This unique  API key is required to identify our application in order to grant access from  LinkedIn for responding to our API calls to their API. Once we've registered  our LinkedIn app, we will be provided with an API key and a secret key.  For the safety of our application, we do not share our secret key. For more  information, please refer to http:  developer.linkedin.com .  Authentication flowchart The following steps are required to authenticate our LinkedIn application to grant  access. We will refer to this project as LinkedIn app.  1.  The LinkedIn API client sends a request to LinkedIn. The client sends the   request to the LinkedIn request token URL at https:  api.linkedin.com  uas oauth requestToken via the oauth object with a callback URL as a  parameter to the LinkedIn API. The callback URL parameter is the URL to  return to from the LinkedIn Authorization URL, where the LinkedIn user  shall confirm the LinkedIn app's required permission. The LinkedIn server  responds and returns the oauth token  public key  and the ouath token  secret key. Client > Server request token URL parameter: callback URL < Server returns oauth token, ouath token  secret  2.  The client sends the request to the LinkedIn server auth URL using the  oauth_token token received from https:  api.linkedin.com uas  oauth authorize ?oauth_token = oauth_token, where oauth_token   is the oauth token returned from the server at phase 1. Client > Server auth URL $_GET parameter: oauth token  [ 86 ]   Chapter 4  3.  The LinkedIn server returns the oauth token, the oauth token secret,    and the oauth_verifier to the client. Client < Server oauth token, oauth token secret, oauth_verifier  4.  The client sends the request to the LinkedIn Server access token path    at https:  api.linkedin.com uas oauth accessToken. Client > Server access token path parameter: oauth_verifier  from phase 2  < Server returns     oauth token, ouath token secret  This example will be constructed from the following controller, library, and view:     application controllers linkedinfo.php: The controller that uses the  LinkedIn library for authentication and displaying the output returned by  the library     application libraries linkedin_handeler.php: The linkedin_handler   library, which enables access to the LinkedIn resources, such as the LinkedIn  user's details and connections, and the companies' details     application views linkedin-me.php: The view, which displays the   LinkedIn user's details     application views linked-connections.php: The view, which displays   the LinkedIn user's connections     application views linked-company.php: The view, which displays the   company's details     application views linked-company-updates.php: The view, which   displays a company's updates  Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject. Hence, the URI to execute the auth controller for login will be http:  mydomain. com myproject linkedinfo.  [ 87 ]   Libraries  The linkedin_handler.php library file The library file application libraries linkedin_handler.php contains the class  library linkedin_handler.

We also reviewed the steps to load and use the library resources in our project.  Eventually, we created several usage examples.  [ 105 ]    Helpers  This chapter covers the CI helpers topic, the different types of helpers, and their  different usage categories, with several code examples of web applications. CI  provides us with built-in helpers, enables us to integrate third-party helpers, and  enables us to develop new helpers and share them with the community if we wish  to. The CI helpers are powering CI efficiency and code reusability by enabling all  other CI controllers using the same code instead of defining a helper function locally.  A helper file is a collection of independent procedural functions in a particular  category. Each helper function performs one specific task, with no dependence on  other functions. The chapter will elaborate on the CI helper's concept, definition,   and usage with several examples.  The folder system helpers contains the CI system's built-in helpers. The folder  application helpers contains all the additional helper files of CI helpers. They   can be third-party helpers or created by the developer.  This chapter will primarily focus on:     CI helpers' scope and usage     Usage categories    Using a helper    Adding a helper to the project       Using helper methods  Loading a helper     The available CI helpers   Helpers     Examples            Example 1: using a built-in helper Example 2: using third-party helpers—SSL helper Example 3: building our own helper—the my_download helper  We will begin by briefly reviewing what a helper is in a CI framework, and how   we can use it for our needs across the project code resources.  CI helpers' scope and usage The CI helper does not have access to the controller resources by default unless CI  and get_instance   are called and used to access CI resources.  We can extend the CI helper using third-party helpers from the CI system' or we can  develop our own helper.  Any application helper should be located under application helpers  in the  project directory.  The helper file must be in the following format:    application helpers  _helper.php  For example, the SSL helper file should appear as application helpers ssl_ helper.php.  The helper integration and usage within the CI project is as follows:     Add the helper code resources to application helpers myhelper_  helper.php     Load the helper automatically or via the controller     Automatically load a helper myhelper for all CI projects as follows:  $autoload['helper'] = array 'url','myhelper' ;      For loading in certain specific controllers, constructors, or methods,  use the following:  $this->load->helper 'myhelper' ;      Use the following helper methods:  $result = $this->myhelper->called_method $param1, aram2 ;  [ 108 ]   Chapter 5  Available CI helpers CI and the CI developers community network provide many helpers, covering   a rich set of topics. We will review CI helpers as well as popular resources for   third-party CI helpers.  We are also encouraged to build our own helpers, which can be used by others,   and share them with the following communities:     The Git community: https:  github.com    CI forums http:  codeigniter.com forums   CI system helpers The list of CI built-in helpers is as follows  they can be found in the CI Directory  Tree by going to system helpers  :     Array Helper    CAPTCHA Helper    Cookie Helper    Date Helper    Directory Helper    Download Helper    Email Helper    File Helper    Form Helper    HTML Helper    Inflector Helper    Language Helper    Number Helper    Path Helper    Security Helper    Smiley Helper    String Helper    Text Helper    Typography Helper    URL Helper    XML Helper  [ 109 ]   Helpers CI third-party helpers     ssl_helper.php    html_manipulator_helper.php  Example 1 – using built-in helpers In this example, we will see how to use CI build-in helpers. For this example, we  will use the URL helper for generating links. The URL helper file contains functions  that assist in working with URLs. We will use the URL helper function site_url  ,  which returns the site URL as specified in the config file.  This example will be constructed from either of the following controllers:     application controllers  helperexample1.php  This controller loads the built-in CI helper URL.  $this->load->helper 'url' ;   The controller renders a view named helper-example1-view     application views  helper-example1-view.php  This view will use the URL helper to generate links in the view file  Let us assume the URLs to the project root are as follows: http:  mydomain. com myproject. http:  mydomain.com myproject helperexample1  The source code is provided with this book via URLs.  The controller file Now we will see how the controller loads the built-in CI URL helper so the view   file will be able to use the URL helper function site_url, which generates the links.    class Helperexample1 extends CI_Controller {    **    * Index Page for this controller.     *     * Maps to the following URL     *     http:  example.com index.php welcome     *  - or -      *     http:  example.com index.php welcome index   [ 110 ]   Chapter 5     *  - or -    * Since this controller is set as the default controller in      * config routes.php, it's displayed at http:  example.com      *     * So any other public methods not prefixed with an underscore         *  will     * map to  index.php welcome       * @see http:  codeigniter.com user_guide general urls.html     *      public function index        {                 Loading the url helper               $this->load->helper 'url' ;          $this->load->view 'helper-example1-view' ;     }   }  * End of file helperexample1.php *    * Location: . application controllers helperexample1 *   The view file The view file calls the URL helper function site_url. Since the controller loaded   the URL helper, it's recognized by the view.

This example will   be constructed from the following helpers:     application helpers ssl_helper.php: The CI helper for SSL that   implements SSL on the links.     application controllers helpersslexample.php: This controller   loads the helper and implements SSL on the links. The helper is loaded   in the constructor. $this->load->helper 'ssl' ;         application views helper-ssl-view.php: This is the rendered view    that SSL is implemented on.  Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject.  http:  mydomain.com myproject helpersslexample.  The source code is provided with this book via URLs.  The helper file This CI helper file implements the services described in the preceding section.   This helper uses the built-in CI URL library and URL helper using the redirect   CI URL helper function.    <?php if   ! defined 'BASEPATH'   exit 'No direct script access                     allowed' ;   if  !function_exists 'force_ssl'   {          function force_ssl            {    get the CI instance to access the CI resources                $CI =& get_instance  ;                 Change the base_url to have https prefix         $CI->config->config['base_url'] =                       str_replace 'http:  ', 'https:  ',                       $CI->config->config['base_url'] ;             if  $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] != 443               {        redirect CI to use https URI            so that  $CI->uri->uri_string   return             the current URI with https prefix                                   redirect $CI->uri->uri_string   ;              }   [ 112 ]   Chapter 5          }    }   if  !function_exists 'remove_ssl'   {      function remove_ssl        {        $CI =& get_instance  ;                  Change the base_url to have http prefix         $CI->config->config['base_url'] =          str_replace 'https:  ', 'http:  ',          $CI->config->config['base_url'] ;       if  $_SERVER['SERVER_PORT'] != 80         {             redirect CI to use http URI            so that  $CI->uri->uri_string   return             the current URI with http prefix                         redirect $CI->uri->uri_string   ;       }      }    }  The controller file Now we will see how the controller loads the SSL helper and calls its function  force_ssl to enforce the HTTPS URI request and response with the browser.       class Helpersslexample extends CI_Controller {     public function __construct   {        parent::__construct  ;          Loading the ssl helper        $this->load->helper 'ssl' ;           Enforce URI request of https         force_ssl  ;      }        **        * Index Page for this controller.        *        *      public function index        {       $this->load->helper 'url' ;       $this->load->view 'helper-ssl-view' ;      }   }  * End of file helpersslexample.php *    * Location: . application controllers helpersslexample *   [ 113 ]   Helpers  The view file The view file code is as follows:                           Menu                                 ">     Welcome - You are using https                           <a href="<?php echo site_url 'example2 more 1 2 3' ;              ?>">Example2                             Example 3 – building your own helper This example uses a helper to download a very large file, of 200 MB, which can't be  downloaded in one file reading.  This example will be constructed from the following helpers:     application helpers my_download_helper.php: This is the CI helper    that is used to download a very large file     application controllers classg2.php: This is the controller that uses      application views classg2view.php: This is the view that has a link    the my_download helper  for the file download  Let us assume that the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject.

We also  reviewed the steps to load and use helpers in our project. Finally, we saw several  relevant usage examples, as follows:     Example 1: using build-in helpers    Example 2: using third-party helpers— SSL helper    Example 3: building our own helper—my_download helper  [ 118 ]   Models  This chapter covers the CI models, their role, and their usage with several code  examples of web applications. The model is responsible for handling the database  it stores and retrieves database objects used by the application from a database and  contains the logic implemented by the application.  Much of the data that is part of the persistent state of the application  whether that  persistent state is stored in files or databases  should reside in the model objects after  the data is loaded into the application. Because the model objects represent knowledge  and expertise related to a specific topic, they can be reused in the application.  The model represents the application data services and can serve the application  logic  commonly referred to as business logic , as well. Usually, the model is  responsible for the following operations:     Adding, modifying, deleting, and searching the application database   objects: Generally, this includes the database operations, but implementing  the same operations and invoking external web services or APIs is not  unusual at all.     Encapsulating the application logic: For example, the model can make data  validations before storing a data object and can alert the calling application  module about the problem.  The most common misuse of the CI database class is using it directly from the  controller, view, or helper. A good practice is to develop the model classes to   handle all the application database services.  Hence, all the other application modules can benefit, and reuse those models. The CI models are special classes designed to handle databases or external information  resources, such as Facebook  we will see an example of this in this chapter .  The CI models are the PHP classes that are designed to work with information   in the database.   Models  This chapter will primarily focus on the following topics:     The CI model scope:  The model resource path Loading a model           Using model methods    Connecting to a database     Business logic     Object Relational Mapping  ORM     Example 1: a CRUD example    Example 2: a business logic example    Example 3: retrieving data from Facebook  We will begin by briefly reviewing the CI model scope and will proceed with several  usage examples, covering different use cases that are combined in a real project.  Scope of the CI model The CI model provides services for all the application modules to access the  application database s  or external information resources in an OOP fashion.  Typically, the model classes will contain functions that help us retrieve, insert,   and update information in the database.  This section will focus on the CI model syntax and usage guidelines, as a preface   to the following usage code examples.  The model resource path The model files are located in the folder application models , in the pattern  application models  .php.  Loading a model Loading a model can be done automatically or via the controller. More specifically,   it can be done in a certain controller's constructor or any controller's method.      If the model is used in a few of the controller's methods, it's recommended  that you load the model in those methods. The scope of the model in that  case is only in those methods project and will refer to application models  mymodel.php.  [ 120 ]   Chapter 6          If the model is used in most of the controller's methods, it's recommended  that you load the model in the controller's constructor. In that case the   scope of the model is in all the controller's methods project and will refer   to application models mymodel.php. $this->load->model 'mymodel' ;  It automatically loads a model mymodel for all the CI projects. If the model is used in most of CI's project controllers, it is recommended  that you autoload it in application config autoload.php. In that case  the scope of the model is in all the CI project and will refer to application  models mymodel.php. $autoload['model'] = array 'users', 'mymodel' ;  Using model methods Once the CI model is loaded, we will access the model functions using an object with  the model name as our class. The model's method is called for performing database  operations, such as retrieving, inserting, and updating data from the database.     Loading the model mymodel in the controller's method $this->load->model 'mymodel' ;    Calling the model's method my_function  $this->mymodel->my_function  ;  For example, let's load the model users and access its function get_users.     Loading the model class $this->load->model 'usermodel' ;    Calling the model to retrieve the users from the database $view_params['users'] = $this->usermodel->get_users  ;  Connecting to a database For more information, refer to Chapter 2, Configurations and Naming Conventions.  In this example, we will connect manually to a database. The following settings   are done in application config database.php:  $config['hostname'] = '127.0.0.1'; $config['username'] = 'db_username'; $config['password'] = 'db_password'; $config['database'] = 'db_database'; $config['port'] = 'db_port'; $config['dbdriver'] = 'mysql';  [ 121 ]   Models  $config['dbprefix'] = ''; $config['pconnect'] = TRUE; $config['db_debug'] = TRUE; $config['cache_on'] = FALSE; $config['cachedir'] = ''; $config['char_set'] = 'utf8'; $config['dbcollat'] = 'utf8_general_ci'; $config['swap_pre'] = ''; $config['autoinit'] = TRUE; $config['stricton'] = FALSE;    Loading the database with the configuration manually this->load->database $config ;  Business logic Business logic is a set of validation rules and decision criteria defined for a certain  information object topic or database object.  The model can apply business logic to the database and information objects   that it handles.  In the case of a social network, the model layer would take care of tasks, such as  saving user data, saving friend associations, storing and retrieving user photos,  finding new friends for suggestions, and so on.  Object Relational Mapping  ORM  While CI provides the model class for the developer to expand for object-oriented  database CRUD  Create, Read, Update, and Delete  validation, and business logic  for the defined project database, there's another option that enables automatic model  services. In this section, we will discuss Object Relational Mapping  ORM . ORM is  a new concept of converting the database scheme definition into an object-oriented  database class API. It provides database CRUD services on a given database, so that  the minimal code is required, instead of the full model development. More than that,  the customized validation on the CRUD operation is enabled as well. Using an ORM  plugin may reduce the need to self-develop our own CI models so that only special  business logic activities are left to be implemented.  Today, ORM plugins provide predefined validation services, as well as user-defined  services to enforce validations on CRUD requests from the application controllers,  libraries, or helpers requesting the database CRUD services.  [ 122 ]   Chapter 6  There are pros and cons of using ORM. On one hand, it simplifies a lot of the  database model development for the database. On there other hand, it dictates  various rules on the database scheme definition, such as defining user tables for an  ORM object user, or defining the auto-increment primary key field name, such as ID,  and so on.  There are several ORM plugins for CI; the most well-known and well-documented  ones, with a large network of community developers, are the following:     Doctrine ORM  docs.doctrine-project.org : This ORM plugin with   the well-documented CI integration guidelines is available at http:   docs.doctrine-project.org en 2.0.x cookbook integrating-with- codeigniter.html.     DataMapper CodeIgniter ORM library  datamapper.wanwizard.eu :    It provides the CI library, such as user guide web navigator.     Both ORM libraries provide more than just the table-based CRUD services,  but can be configured to handle the cross-table relationships of the foreign  key fields. They can support one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many  relationships, or even more complex relationships between multiple   database tables.  The ORM plugins also provide validation and manipulation services on the handled  database fields, such as performing trimming on a string field before it is saved to   the database.  Validation services include built-in validations such as valid e-mail fields, or a  field that must have the same value as another field, such as fields with an account  creation password retype requirement. The full scope and usage of ORM is beyond  the scope of this CI book. However, it is highly recommended that you learn more  about ORM and try using the referred ORM plugins and consider using them in your  CI projects.  Of course, we do provide a simple usage example of adding a record to the database,  and retrieving the database records using ORM in the following section:  [ 123 ]   Models  ORM simple operations example For example, let's say we have a user database table with the ID as the primary key   auto-increment. User name, e-mail, and password are the other fields, and if we  want to add a new user record to the database, we could do so with the help of the  following code:  <?PHP    We shall define the database table named users     with ID as auto-increment, username, password, and e-mail as      the other fields.    ORM will create an user objet based on the users      table scheme. We can set the variable to this object, and use      the operational services provided by ORM for actions, such      as save, delete, update, and add. $u = new User  ; $u->username = 'A new User'; $u->password = 'shhnew1'; $u->email = 'user@mail.com';    To add a new user record if  $u->save    {      if saved we have a new echo 'New User Id Opened having'    $u->id. 'User Id  ';   } else {   Show why we failed to save echo   $u->error->string;   }    Getting the first three users from the database $u = new User  ; $u->limit 3 ->get  ;    Showing the fetched users foreach  $u as $user_rec  {   echo 'User Id: '. $user_rec->id . ' ';   echo 'User Name: '. $user_rec->username . ' ';   echo 'User Email: '. $user_rec->email. ' ';   }    Get the user with Uid = 10 if any $u = new user  ; $seek_uid = 10;  $u->where 'id', $seek_uid ->get  ;    Check if found if  exist  $u  {   echo 'User Id:'.$u->id.' Name is'.$u->username. ' ';   } else echo 'No user found for user ID'. $seek_uid. ' ';  [ 124 ]   This is only a very simple usage example, while ORM today provides a rich set   of CRUD and validation services. Please refer to the provided links to the featured  ORM plugins for more information.  Chapter 6  Example 1 – a CRUD example In this example, we will see how to use a CI model. For this example, we will use a  model that performs these operations on the database: SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE. The example displays, all the products that are retrieved by the model productmodel  at the main page in the database. Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject   and http:  mydomain.com myproject product.  The source code is provided with this book via URLs.  The main page has links for adding and editing a product. These links generate   a form for editing and adding a product. Let us assume the URI to the project root is http:  mydomain.com myproject   and http:  mydomain.com myproject product add. Suppose we want to edit and update the product with product_id 1, the link will  be http:  mydomain.com myproject product edit 1. This example will be  constructed from the following controller, model, and views:     application controllers product.php: This controller loads the    model product. $this->load->model 'productmodel' ;  This controller renders the following views:          productsview: This view displays all the products with links   to editing and adding a product productform: This view contains the form for adding and editing   a product     application models productmodel.php: This model contains functions  that perform these operations on the database: SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE.  [ 125 ]   Models     application views productsview.php: The view that displays    the products.     application views productform.php: The view that contains the form.  The controller file The controller PHP file is located at application controllers product.php.   The controller handles the product's operations, such as adding, editing, updating,  and displaying the product's table.  The controller creates a form for adding and editing a product.

We have made the following examples in this chapter:     Example 1: a CRUD example    Example 2: a business logic example    Example 3: retrieving data from Facebook  [ 141 ]    Views  This chapter covers the process flow to render views, the process flow within  the view file, different type of views, and their role and usage with several code  examples of web applications.  The views are programmatic portions that provide content to the browser to be  executed on the client side  that is, the user PC  to make the user-interface session   on the local computer.  The PHP view file rendered output returns from the server as an HTTP response  content to the requesting browser application  that is, requesting via submitting   a URI in the browser navigation area .  Initially, the browser sends a URI request that the user types in, to a default or  specific controller method, such as http:  mysite.com myapp helloworld. The called controller method processes the request, performs its decision making,  and may use the other CI resources, such as helpers, libraries, models, and  eventually renders a view back as an HTTP response to the browser HTTP request  that initiates the controller operation. The HTML file returned to the browser  includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The browser executes the received rendered  view from the server, and uses it to perform the user-interface session  visual  elements, and UI elements, such as buttons, scrollbars, and navigation elements ;  we see and operate via the browser to navigate to other page views or get specific  information or media by issuing a page anchor, button, clicking on the icon, and   so on. The described action causes another HTTP request s , either synchronous   mostly anchor  or asynchronous AJAX request s  handled by JavaScript embedded  in the web page.   Views  The CI view is a PHP file that may contain part or all of the following: PHP statements,  HTML tags, CSS, JavaScript program, Flash, images, and media sources. In CI, a view  file may contain the PHP code that uses the controller-provided parameters, or even  call the CI helpers, libraries, or model directly to generate the output that is part of the  generated HTML file response. The generated PHP output can be strings or numeric  values incorporated in the HTML tags, or even a whole HTML page.  This chapter will primarily focus on the following topics:     The CI view scope:  The CI view resources path The rendering flow           Client-side flexibility    Accessing libraries helpers within a view       Using AJAX    View parser configuration issues     Forms  Integrating jQuery or other client-side libraries     View rendering plugins  view template plugin example     Example 1: HTML5 location powered by Google Maps    Example 2: user feedback powered by AJAX and the jQuery UI  We will begin by briefly reviewing the CI view scope, and will proceed with several  usage examples covering different use cases that can be combined in a real project.  Scope of the CI view The CI view is enabled with great flexibility to integrate the client-side third-party  resources, as well as accessing the CI resources of the CI libraries, helpers, and models.  This section will focus on the CI view syntax and usage guidelines, as a preface to the  coming usage code examples.  We can extend the CI library using the third-party libraries from the CI echo system  or develop our own libraries.  [ 144 ]   The CI view resources path In a CI project, the view files are located under the application views  directory  or any subdirectory to this path. For example, we can build under application  views  subdirectories, for let's say, two different view categories to improve the  clarity of the file structure in our project. The following screenshot shows the views  location in a CI project directory tree:  Chapter 7  [ 145 ]   Views  For example, to render a template file located at Application views templates   named home.php, we shall write the following code:  $this->load->view 'templates home' ;   The following load view call, render a view using all its optional  parameters $this->load->view 'view_file',    PHP view file to render $view_params,     parameters array for view FALSE      FALSE - default. to output      TRUE – back as string    ;  In this example, view_file is referring to the CI resource PHP view file  application views view_file.php.  $view_params is the array of parameters  scalar array in each entry  for the view  file, as we have demonstrated at several places earlier, so that each array key, let's  say, name, becomes the $name PHP variable in the view to use.  In case we wish to get the processed view into a buffer, for, special processing, caching,  or any other processing purpose, for example you may call the following example:  $view_buffer=$this->load->view   'sectionA view_file', $params, TRUE ;  Note that the third parameter's value is set to TRUE  the default value is set to FALSE,  and echoes the view to the standard output; in the case of the controller rendering,  this means it will be returned as an HTTP response to the browser, issuing the  request from the controller .  The preceding example refers to the following view file: application views  sectionA view_file.php.  The rendering flow The view is rendered by the controller. The controller provides the parameters to   the rendered PHP view file to use them.  The controller uses the following built-in CI load library: $this->load->view 'my_ view',$data ;  [ 146 ]   Chapter 7  Otherwise, the controller uses the third-party rendering service library. In this  chapter we will use such a library. The CI controller rendering is done by the CI   load view library, and that optionally accepts the $data of parameters and objects  that the rendered PHP view file can use. See the following code for example:  $data['myval'] = 'Hello'; $this->load->view 'my_view',$data ;  The rendered PHP view file application views my_view.php uses the $data  parameters provided via the load library as follows:       Note that the controller defines the data as follows:  $data['myval'] = 'Hello';  While the usage at the PHP view file rendered will be as follows:       Later, the PHP view file will be executed, so that the HTML generated code will   be as follows:   Hello   The entire PHP view file that is rendered, including the PHP executions, will  generate the view HTML file that will be returned to the browser via HTTP   to be executed locally.  View flexibility CI provides the flexibility for the PHP view file code to use any client-side  JavaScript CSS HTML, or other JavaScript libraries in the view files, without   any requirement to declare them at the server-side controller, as it occurs in   some other platforms.  Furthermore, the CI view can access any other CI resources, such as the CI libraries,  the CI models, or the CI helpers, as if it were the rendering controller of the view;   for example, accessing a session parameter directly.  $param = $this->session->userdata 'param1'  ;  [ 147 ]   Views  Also, the CI view can call a CI library method directly in the same fashion as the  rendering controller does  assuming the rendering controller loads this library .  $calc = $this->my_lib->my_lib_calc  $param ;      Accessing the libraries helpers As mentioned earlier, the CI PHP view file can access any of the CI resources, such   as calling the CI helpers, libraries, or models in the same way the controller does.  The following is a more elaborated and complete example of a PHP CI view file,  accessing CI resources, such as libraries models helpers:    <?PHP    URI is a built-in CI library    if the rendering controller for this view was     http:  mysite myproject mycontroller test3    the segment 1  = mycontroller – the controller name    the segment 2  = test3 - the controller method $the_controller = $this->uri->segment 1 ; $the_method = $this->uri->segment 2 ; ?>  This View Rendered by Controller      Using its method named     Forms The CI PHP view file can contain any number of HTML data entry forms to accept  the input data from the browsing user. We can use the CI form helper service to  simplify the data entry buildup powered validation services.  The CI form helper provides a useful and comprehensive set of PHP functions for  many data entry and input fashions. Among them we can find the data entry of the  text field, the area text field, the radio button, checkbox, combo box, and menu option.  The following is a list of the most common CI form helper functions:     form_open      form_input      form_dropdown    [ 148 ]   Chapter 7     form_password      form_upload      form_textarea      form_multiselect      form_checkbox      form_radio      form_close    The CI form helper generates an HTML portion that is rendered as part of the HTML  file that is returned to the browser.  For example, let's take a look at a drop-down selection example of a color pickup.    <?PHP $attr = ' class="nice_field" '; $options = array  ; $options[0] = 'Blue'; $options[1] = 'Green'; $options[2] = 'Yellow'; $default    = 1; echo form_dropdown "color", $options, $default, $attr ; ?>  The form_dropdown helper will generate the following code:     Blue   Green   Yellow     For more information, refer to the CI form help user manual.  AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML services  AJAX   http:  en.wikipedia.org  wiki Ajax  of JavaScript jQuery integration within a view is critical today in  almost any web application. It provides an advanced user experience by operating  asynchronously in parallel to the user operations, and updates only certain HTML  selector portions and not the entire page as anon AJAX updates operate.   [ 149 ]   Views  AJAX has many use case examples to enhance the user experience. The following are  few common usage examples:     Autocomplete while the user typing into a field all the matches found shown   in a pop-up list for the user to choose. Without AJAX autocomplete the UI  service is almost impossible.     When submitting a form data entry  using AJAX enables to issue the server  submission to store or process the date and show the result only in a specific  selector  notification massage , instead of refreshing the whole page as form  with the action, submission requires.  Format: Bullet      When browsing many information pages  called pagination  and clicking on  a certain page number to view. AJAX enables rendering the selected page to  view within a selection DIV in the whole HTML page without refreshing the  whole page.  Format: Bullet End   Currently, AJAX is becoming an essential view component, mostly enabled via the  popular jQuery library, which makes it easy to use. AJAX is an extremely valuable  UI asset for building smart and interactive views. For example, the following is  an example of the AJAX service that, for a given SSN  Social Security Number ,  provides the person's name and phone number in the defined selectors, if found,  or alerts, if else. Whenever the user is clicking on the Get Info button, an AJAX call  is triggered, and an asynchronous AJAX call to an AJAX controller is sent with the  SSN to get the person's record. When the response is returned, if the SSN was found,  the phone and name of the person will be updated. Otherwise, a notification will be  provided that the SSN person's record was not found.  The following is the code implementing the process described previously, where the  AJAX call is the heart of the operation:    function get_person_info      SSN_val, name_sel, phone_sel, err_sel  {    *     SSN_val –the value of the SSN user typed in to search      name_sel–the name input that the Ajax will update if SSN found ..  phone_sel-the phone selector to be update if SSN found as well     err_sel-the error message area, to explain error such as SSN       not found or some other error occurred.   *    varajax_url = ' ajax get_person_info';   $.ajax {     type: "POST",      Very important POST is the best     url: ajax_url,        the URI of the AJAX server side controller method that will   [ 150 ]   Chapter 7  processes this request     data: {SSN: SSN_val},        SSN is the parameter name        SSN_val is the value     dataType: "json",       the retuned data expected to be JSON     success: function data  {           the data is the array conversion of the JSON data           retuned to ease our usage in the JavaScript!       if data.result=='found'  {            Let's show the name and phone of the person with the            given SSN         $ name_sel .val data.name ;         $ phone_sel .val data.phone ;       } else{            SSN Not found in the database!            Let's notify SSN has no person match         $ err_sel .css  'color', 'red' ;         $ err_sel .text 'No person found with SSN' + SSN_val  ;       }     },     error :   Ajax error occurred such as Ajax server not found        and so on     function   msg   { alert  'Error:' + msg       $ err_sel .css  'color', 'red' ;     $ err_sel .text  'Error:' + msg ;   } } ;    Wait for the document to be ready and bind the user click     on the get id selector to call the AJAX search service     with the user typed SSN $ function  {   $ 'get' .click  function  {      get_person_info  $ 'SSN' .val  ,     'name',     'Phone',     'err_sel'    ;   } ; } ;    [ 151 ]   Views  The following is the portion of the HTML form itself:     Enter SSN     Get Info     Name      phone          Parser configuration issues The view is parsed by the CI parser before it is rendered back to the requesting  browser. The default syntax to echo a PHP parameter   calculated expression value  within the HTML tags is  .  However, CI provides automatic PHP short tag parsing support configuration  at application config config.php and at the configuration parameter  $config['rewrite_short_tags'] = TRUE;. If rewrite_short_tags is set to TRUE, we can use the short tag of   .  An important note on this is that in terms of debugging, the non-short regular PHP  echo format is preferred, as the short form errors might be more difficult to trace in  this fashion. However, since this fashion is used in many code projects we've seen,  we are mentioning it as well.  Integrating jQuery or other client-side  libraries CI provides the freedom to integrate any client-side libraries, so that CI does   not have to be specially configured to, or we do not need to perform any special   CI declarations.  The client-side integration is performed in the same fashion, as if no platform is  being used; they are completely transparent. However, CI provides client-side  jQuery code generation services via PHP, such as building the JavaScript library   to create jQuery code, as part of the controller coding.  $this->load->library 'javascript' ;  [ 152 ]   Chapter 7  However, for the latest jQuery and many other JavaScript-based solutions today,  there's no need to use this fashion of rendered JavaScript portions, but we can use  the JavaScript A-Z in the view itself instead. A great resource for the  wow level   JavaScript libraries can be found in the largest resource for the JavaScript libraries  we've found so far at http:  www.jsdb.io.  Many more cool links for client-side platforms can be found at https:  delicious. com eliorr1961.  Note that the directory path for the sources in the CI views is calculated, as if the  view file is in the project root.  For example, let's say the JavaScript library is located at    javascript myjs.js.  And the view is located either at the   application views view1. php or   application views topicB view2.php view path   under views.  After we provide the root path via the base tag using the built-in CI URL helper   " >, both will load myjs.js as follows:      They load as if they were located at the project root. This is due to the fact that CI  processes the requests and rendering views as part of the root directory index.php.  Hence, all the directory paths for SRC or INCLUDE from view PHP portions are  considered, as if they occurred from the project root directory. This is due to the fact  that all URIs to the project are executed by index.php. So for all the project code, the  directory path is as though your code was in the same directory of index.php or at  the CI project root directory.  Plugins for rendering view As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, we can use third-party libraries to  enable us to create more advanced rendering services in a template layout fashion. For example, the CodeIgniter template class by Colin Williams available at   http:  www.williamsconcepts.com ci libraries template index.html. This plugin enables us to define the rendered page as a Lego fashioned layout   with predefined page regions, so that we can have a different PHP CI view to   render each of them.  [ 153 ]   Views  This way we can have great reusability and a unified look, and fill in the entire  application page, which in many cases is a good UX  User Experience  practice. In  this case, the user, let's say, will know that on the top they will have a certain main  navigation area, on the right certain status info and operational shortcuts, and so on. We can define one or more layouts, so that each page layout template will have its  region's organization. Each region is commonly defined within a DIV. Having several template layouts, we can initially choose the proper layout we want  to use, and then we will load its region content using the CI views defined for each  region. For example, let's say we want to have a certain layout named default. The default template's main layout will be named, template, for example, using  the view file main_template.php, so that main_template.php will include the  following regions:     header    upper_navigation    content    footer  We shall perform the following configurations at application config template. php.  This is not the CI built-in plugin, but an additional plugin with the  library and configuration file, and other assets we have installed to  our CI project.    The default template shall be defined as follow:   Note, more templates can be defined in the same fashion $template['default']['template'] = 'main_template'; $template['default']['regions'] = array      'header', 'upper_navigation', 'content', 'footer' ;  The main_template refers to application views main_template.php. The content of main_template.php will include rendering of all the defined  template regions as follows:                      [ 154 ]   Chapter 7           In order to use the preceding template plugin, we will do the following:  First, load the template library in the CI controller constructor s where we want to  use the template. Remember that the template library is located at    application libraries Template.php.  We shall load the template library as follows:  $this->load->library 'template' ;    application libraries Template.php   $this->load->library 'template' ;  Then, we will load the specific template file we have configured  we can define many  to choose from , let's say, in the controller constructor, we will also assume that all  the controller methods use the same template.    set the selected template from the template config we want    to use $this->template->set_template 'default' ;  Now, for rendering the template regions into a rendered view using the   predefined view . We will do as follows:  For each template region at, let's say,   application views ,   we shall load it to the corresponding region as follows:  $this->template->write_view  'header', 'header_view', $data ;. $this->template->write_view   'upper_navigation', 'upper_navigation_view', $data  ; $this->template->write_view  'content', 'content_view', $data ; $this->template->write_view  'footer', 'footer_view', $data ;  Now the template regions are rendered with their region view files. We can render  the whole template with all its regions as follows:     Now, we have all the regions rendered into the      template instance buffer, we can render them all to     the desired template base page. $this->template->render  ;  [ 155 ]   Views  The point to remember is that templates have great pros, but also some cons.   The template dictates a very strict way of rendering a template base page that   does not always have the desired flexibility, so that we may find ourselves writing  several templates and switch between them, according to the UI situation.  Example 1 – HTML5 location powered   by Google Maps In this example, we will expand the Google Maps integration example from Chapter  4, Libraries, so that there will be a new option of showing the user where they are  located on the Google Map. For doing so, we will use the HTML5 navigator. geolocation service to request the browsing user to share its location with the  application. If the user agrees, and is using an advanced browser, such as the latest  Firefox, Chrome builds that support to this service. Once we get the values, we will  collect the geolocation, and call a controller method to prepare the Google Map of  that area to render a Google Map view with the option navigator. We will use the  HTML5 navigator.geolocation service as follows:  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition getLocation,  locationFail ;  Here, getLocation is called, if the location was successfully fetched, and  locationFail, if it was failed.  We will start with the controller first.  The controller file The controller PHP file is located at application controllers gmaps.php.

We will reuse and expand the login example from Chapter 3, Usage and Scope of  Controllers, so if a user is logged in, we will log the feedback with the user ID   kept in the session, while if not, we will log it as anonymous user feedback.  Remember the following things:     Username: reg_user,    Password: 111111111  9 by 1s  for regular user login  The reused and extended resources are as follows:     auth.php: No change here    ajax_handler.php: This is the new AJAX handler controller    users_model.php: This is the extended user model    logged_in_view.php: This is the extended view for regular user login  We expand the code to include the new Ajax_handler to keep the jQuery UI dialog  submission of the browsing user feedback, as well as get the user logged message  via the AJAX asynchronous interface. Note that we check in Ajax_handler to see  whether the request is AJAX or not. And if it's not, we issue the following URL   in the browser: http:  photographersnav.com ci_utils index.php ajax_handler.  We will get a notification in the browser that this is a bad request.  [ 161 ]   Views  The users_model resource is expanded to provide a few more services, which are   as follows:     get_logged_in_user  : This function is used to return the logged in   user record if logged in or NULL otherwise. get_user_rec   $uid   to   get a specific user record based on his her ID.     keep_user_feedback  $feedback : This function is used to keep the user   feedback in the database with its user ID, if logged in.     get_user_feedbacks  $uid : This function get all the user feedback   messages save till now in the database as an array of the database objects.  Each feedback database row returned have the feedback message and its  timestamp formatted as HTML and returned via the JSON format back to the  AJAX caller to be shown to the end user via the jQuery selector based HTML  rendering  for example, $ selector .html  The_html_item_returned_ from_server  .   The logged_in_view resource is expanded to provide the user with the new services  as follows:     Add a new feedback button, which when clicked pops-up a jQuery UI dialog      Show the feedback log button, which when clicked shows a scrollable list of   for this purpose  the user feedback  Now let us review the source code itself.

In addition, we showed how to  integrate our CodeIgniter code with the third-party template plugin  the CI library,  configuration, and additional code assets  for providing the view template services   to the application controllers.  We have also learned the examples of integrating the jQuery UI and AJAX in the CI  view with the CI controllers models.
