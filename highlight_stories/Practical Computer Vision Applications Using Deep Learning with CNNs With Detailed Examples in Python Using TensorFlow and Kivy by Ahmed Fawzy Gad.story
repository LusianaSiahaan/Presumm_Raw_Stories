Printed on acid-free paper   I dedicate this book to those looking to cause peace to prevail all over  the world and laboring to stop further killing of children and innocent  people just because of religious racism. For every human should want  to restore rights to their proper owners, do good for others seeking the   pleasure of Allah, and leave the world better after death.

Whatever the human can do intelligently is now required to be moved  into machines. First-generation AI focuses on problems that can be formally described  by humans. Using AI, steps for doing something intelligent are described in a form of  instructions that machines follow. Machines follow the human without changes. These  features are characteristic of the first era of AI.  Humans can fully describe only simple problems such as Tic-Tac-Toe or even   chess and fail to describe the more complicated problems. In chess, the problem can  be simply explained by representing the board as a matrix of size 8×8, describing each  piece and how it moves, and describing the goals. Machines will be restricted to those  tasks formally described by humans. By programming such instructions, machines can  play chess intelligently. Machine intelligence is now artificial. The machine itself is not  intelligent, but humans have transferred their intelligence to the machine in the form of  several static lines of code. By static, it is meant that the behavior is the same in all cases. The machine, in this case, is tied to the human and can’t work on its own. This is like  a master-slave relationship. The human is the master and the machine is the slave, which  just follows the human’s orders and no more.  Embedding intelligent behavior inside chunks of code can’t handle all intelligent   behaviors of humans. Some simple tasks, such as sorting numbers or playing some  games, can be described by humans and then handled by the machine with 100%  of human intelligence. However, some complex tasks, such as speech-to-text, image  recognition, sentiment analysis, and others, can’t be solved by just code. Such problems  could not be described by the human as done with chess. It is impossible to write code  to recognize image objects such as cats. Such intelligent behavior of recognizing objects  simply can’t be solved using a static code because there is no single rule for classifying  objects. There is no rule to recognize cats, for instance. Even if a rule is successfully  created to recognize cats in one environment, it will definitely fail when applied in  another. So how can we make machines intelligent in such tasks? This is machine  learning  ML , in which rules are learned by machines.  xvii   InTroduCTIon  To make the machine able to recognize objects, we can give it previous knowledge   from experts in a way the machine can understand. Such knowledge-based systems  form the second era of AI. One of the challenges in such systems is how to handle  uncertainty and unknowns. Humans can recognize objects even in different and  complex environments and are able to handle uncertainty and unknowns intelligently,  but machines can’t.  In ML, the human is responsible to do the complex task of investigating the data  to find what types of features are able to categorize objects accurately. Unfortunately,  it is a challenging task to find the best types of features to use. This is the question that  researchers are trying to answer for different applications. For example, to diagnose a  disease, the expert human starts by collecting data for both affected and nonaffected  persons, labels such data well, and finds some types of features that are robust in  discriminating between people with the disease and those without it. Such features may  be age, gender, blood sugar, and blood pressure. This is a very challenging task because  the larger the dataset, the more complex for humans to find features working across all  samples.  These days, however, ML models can be trained to identify how to discriminate   between the different classes. The ML algorithm is what finds the suitable mathematical  function that creates the most robust relationship between the inputs and their outputs.  ML algorithms are not doing everything; the key intelligence is still found in the   human expert, not in the machine. The human collects and labels the data, extracts the  most suitable features, and selects the best ML algorithm. After that, the ML algorithm  just learns what the human has told it. Still, the machine plays an important role in  finding the rule by which the inputs are mapped to the outputs.  Usually, ML algorithms trained with data from a certain environment s  can’t  work with other environments. This is a key limitation. There are huge amounts of  data existing all over the world. Day after day, the data increases and traditional ML  techniques are not suitable for its manipulation. For instance, images are complex to  describe using a set of engineered features due to the variations even within the same  environment. The work  i.e., feature engineering  should be repeated to make the ML  algorithm suited to work with other environments.  If the human ability to find good discriminating features decreases as the number   of classes increases, we can avoid depending on humans and leave that task for the  machine. The machine itself will try to explore the data and find suitable features to  discriminate the classes. Just give the machine the data and it will find what features to   xviii   InTroduCTIon  use in order to make a classifier. This is deep learning  DL . The convolutional neural  network  CNN  DL model is the trend for working with large amounts of images.  The field of DL focuses on learning how to draw conclusions from raw data without  the need of the in-between step of feature engineering. This is why DL can be practically  called “automated feature engineering.” It is tiresome in its processing and memory  requirements and may take weeks to discriminate between different classes.  This book targets those of tomorrow’s data scientists who would like to start   understanding the basic concepts of DL for computer vision. Readers should have  a basic understanding of image processing and Python. Here is an overview of the  chapters.  Chapter 1 selects the most suitable set of features for classifying the Fruits 360   dataset based on a review of some commonly used feature descriptors in computer  vision. Such features are implemented in Python. By filtering such features in the  preprocessing step, the minimum number of elements are used for classification. This  chapter concludes that traditional handcrafted features are not suitable for complex  problems. DL is the alternative for working with millions of samples and thousands of  classes.  Chapter 2 discusses the artificial neural network  ANN , which is the base of DL   models. It starts by explaining how the ANN is just a combination of linear models. ANN  architecture is designed for some simple examples by specifying the best number of  layers and neurons. Based on both numerical and Python examples, it will be clear how  ANN works for both forward and backward passes.  Chapter 3 uses the feature set from Chapter 2 to implement the ANN for classifying  a subset of the Fruits 360 dataset. Because no optimization technique is used within the  implementation, the classification accuracy is low.  Chapter 4 gives an introduction to single- and multiobjective optimization   techniques. It uses the genetic algorithm random-based technique for optimizing the  ANN weights. This increases the classification accuracy to more than 97%.  Chapter 5 discusses CNNs for recognizing multidimensional signals. The chapter   starts by highlighting the differences between fully connected neural networks  FCNNs   and CNNs and how CNN is derived from FCNN. Based on numerical examples, the two  basic operations in CNN, namely, convolution and pooling, will be clear. CNN layers are  implemented in NumPy for understanding how things work in detail.  Chapter 6 introduces the TensorFlow DL library, which is used to build DL   models for parallel and distributed processing of large amounts of data. TensorFlow   xix   InTroduCTIon  placeholders, variables, dataflow graphs, and TensorBoard are discussed based on some  examples building a simple linear model and an ANN for simulating the XOR gate. By  the end of this chapter, a CNN is created using tensorflow.nn module for classifying the  CIFAR10 dataset.  Chapter 7 deploys the trained models into a web server for being accessed by   Internet users using a web browser. A web application is created using the Flask  microframework. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to build the front pages for  accessing the web server. The HTML pages send HTTP requests to the server with an  image, and the server responds to such requests with the predicted class.  Chapter 8 builds cross-platform applications using the Kivy open source library.  By linking Kivy to NumPy, it is possible to build data science applications that work  unchanged on different platforms. This removes the overhead of customizing the code  for a specific platform. An Android application is created to read an image and execute  the CNN layers implemented using NumPy in Chapter 5.  To benefit from the projects created, it is preferred to push them online for other   people to use and benefit from. An appendix discusses how to package Python projects  and distribute them into the Python package index  PyPI  repository.  Before starting, let’s take a brief overview of the Python environment used in the   book.  All code in the book is implemented using Python. Because native Python is   complex for handling images, multiple libraries are used to help to produce an efficient  implementation for applications across the chapters.  At first, native Python could be downloaded from this link  www.python.org   downloads . The book uses Python 3. Just install the version of Python that is suitable  for your system. The next step is to prepare all libraries required across the entire book.  Rather than installing individual libraries, it is recommended to use Anaconda Python  distribution. It is available for download from this link  www.anaconda.com download .  It supports Windows, Mac, and Linux and packages more than 1,400 data science  libraries. A list of all supported packages can be accessed from this page  https:  repo. anaconda.com pkgs . By just installing Anaconda on your machine, all of the supported  libraries will be ready for use. This is helpful to avoid the challenges of preparing the  Python environment.  The required libraries in this book are NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-image,   scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Flask, Werkzeug, Jinja, Pickle, Pillow, and Kivy. All of these  libraries, except for Kivy, are supported by Anaconda. Later in this chapter, we will   xx   InTroduCTIon  see the function of each of them. Note that such libraries can be installed easily. After  installing the native Python, we can use the pip installer to download and install a library  based on this command: “pip install  ”. Just type the name of the library. Some  installations are not straightforward and might change if the system changes. Thus,  we can’t cover the different installations. For such reasons, Anaconda is better than  installing each library individually. Let’s discuss the libraries needed.  Python supports a number of built-in data structures: list, tuple, dictionary, set, and  string. Unfortunately, no data structure provides flexibility in data science applications.  These data structures support working with different data types at the same time.  The same data structure might contain numbers, characters, objects, and more. String  is an exception, in which only characters are supported. Moreover, string and tuple are  immutable, which means it is impossible to change their values after they are created.  Dictionary adds a key to each item. Saving image pixels using a dictionary requires  adding a key to each pixel which enlarges the amount of data saved. Set is restricted to  just set operations and images are not restricted to just such operations.  Talking about images, which are the main concern of the book, list is the suitable   data structure. It is a mutable data type that is able to hold matrices. Unfortunately,  working with lists makes the process complex. We have to make sure everything is  numeric, of a certain specific type because different numeric data types can be saved  in the same list. To apply a simple operation such as adding a number to the image, we  have to write loops for visiting each element and apply such operations individually.  In data science applications, it is recommended to use the tools that make applying  the operations easier. There are some challenging tasks to conquer when building an  application, and we do not need to add another challenge in programming such tasks. For such reasons, the NumPy  Numeric Python  library is used. Its basic role is to  support a new data structure in Python, which is array. Working with NumPy arrays is  simpler than working with lists. For example, using just the addition operator  + , we  can add a number to each element in the image after it is converted into a NumPy array.  Many other libraries have their functions accept and return a NumPy array.  Some operations are supported inside the NumPy array, but it is not meant to apply   operations. The SciPy  Scientific Python  library supports the same operations in the  NumPy arrays and more. It also supports working with the n-dimensional NumPy arrays   e.g., images  using the scipy.ndimage submodule. For more advanced operations on  images, the scikit-image library is used. For example, image features can be extracted  using this library.  xxi   InTroduCTIon  After reading the image and applying some operations, Matplotlib is used for   displaying the images. It is mainly used for 2D visualization, but it also supports some 3D  features.  After reading the images, extracting features, and making visualizations, we can start   building ML models using the scikit-learn library. It supports different types of models  that are ready for use. Just feed it with inputs, outputs, and their parameters to have a  trained model.  After training a ML model, we can save it for later use using the pickle library, which   serializes and deserializes the objects. Up to this point, we can build and save an ML  model. We then move to building and saving a DL model using TensorFlow. It is the  most commonly used DL library, as it supports different APIs that match the needs  of professionals and beginners alike. TensorFlow has its own ways to save the trained  models.  In order to deploy the trained models, Flask is used. It is a microframework for   building web applications. By deploying the trained models to the web server, clients can  access such applications using a web browser. They can upload test images to the server  and receive the classification label. Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine and WSGI for  building the applications. For such reasons, the libraries Jinja and werkzeug must be  installed.  In order to build a data science mobile application that runs on-device, Kivy is used.  It is a Python library that allows the Python code to run cross-platform. In this book, Kivy  is used to build rich data science applications running for Android. The APK generated  by Kivy can be used in the market exactly as if it were created normally using Android  Studio.  Kivy uses the python-for-android packager, which allows adding the required   dependencies in the Android application. Because scikit-image is not supported by  python-for-android, images are read using Pillow, which is supported to run on Android  devices.  Implementations of the projects are available at this GitHub account:  github.com   AhmedFGad  xxii   CHAPTER 1  Recognition in Computer  Vision  Most computer science research tries to build a human-like robot that is able to function  exactly as humans. Even emotional properties are not impossible for such robots. Using  a sensor, the robot feels the temperature in the surrounding environment. Using facial  expressions, it is possible to know whether a person is sad or happy. Even things that  seem impossible might eventually only be challenging.  At the current time, a very challenging application is object recognition. Recognition   can be based on different types of data such as audio, image, and text. But image  recognition is a very efficient way due to the plenitude of information that can be helpful  in the task. Thus, it is regarded as the most popular application in computer vision.  There is a massive number of objects existing in the world, and differentiating them    is a complex task. Different objects might have similar visual appearance except for subtle  details. Moreover, the same object appears differently based on its surrounding environment.  For example, based on the light, viewing angle, distortion, and occlusion, the same object  appears differently in the image. Depending on the native image, pixels may not be a good  option for image recognition. This is because a minor change in each pixel leads to a major  change in the image, and thus the system is unable to recognize the objects correctly. The  target is to find a set of unique properties or features that do not change even with changing  pixel locations or values, as long as the structure of the object appears somewhere in the  image. Manually extracting features from images is a big challenge in image recognition.  This is why automatic approaches to feature extraction are becoming the alternative.  Because recognition of any object in any environment is complex at the current time,   the alternative way is to restrict the environment or the objects targeted. For example,  rather than recognizing all types of animals, we can just target a group of them. Rather than  working indoors and outdoors, we might restrict the environment to just indoor images.     Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7_1  1   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Rather than recognizing objects in different views, we might only work with some views.  Generally, creating a narrow artificial intelligence application, while challenging, is easier  and has fewer difficulties than general artificial intelligence application.  This chapter discusses how to build a recognition application to classify fruit   images. It starts by presenting some types of features that are useful generally with  different types of applications and then finds the best of such features for use with our  target application. By the end of this chapter, we will find why manually extracting  features is challenging and why automatic feature mining using convolutional neural  networks  CNNs  is preferred.   Image Recognition Pipeline Similar to most traditional recognition applications, image recognition is likely to follow  some predefined steps, from accepting an input to returning the desired results. A  summary of such steps is presented in Figure 1-1.  Figure 1-1.  General recognition pipeline  2   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Sometimes the input image is not suitable in its current form for processing. For   example, if we are to build a face recognition application that captures images in a  complex environment to recognize the people inside it, then it is preferred to remove  the background before starting to recognize the target object. Background removal, in  this case, is a type of preprocessing. Generally, any step preceding the actual work is  called preprocessing. Preprocessing is a step that maximizes the probability of successful  recognition.  After preparing the inputs, we come to the actual work, which starts with feature   extraction or mining. This is the critical step in most recognition applications. The target  is to find a set of representative features that accurately describes each input. Such a set  of features should maximize the probability of mapping each input to its correct output  and also minimize the probability of assigning each input a wrong label. As a result,  there should be an analysis of the types of features to be used.  The application and the set of features used are related. The features are selected   based on the application. By understanding the nature of the application, the type  of features required will be easily detected. For an application such as human face  detection, what are the features to be extracted? Human faces have skin of various colors,  and thus we can determine that skin color is the feature to be used. Knowing that the  application is to detect human faces in grayscale outdoor images, low lighting, and in a  moving environment helps to select the appropriate features. If you are asked to build  an application to recognize oranges and bananas, you can benefit from the fact that  oranges and bananas have different colors and thus decide that only color features are  enough. But they are not enough to recognize different types of skin cancer, for instance.  More work must be done to find the most suitable set of features. The next section titled  Feature Extraction discusses some features helpful in image recognition applications. After creating a feature vector holding the features that are likely to be useful in the  recognition application, we come to other steps that add further enhancement, namely,  feature selection and reduction. The primary goal of feature selection and reduction can  be defined as obtaining an optimal feature subset from a set of features that enhances  the learning algorithm performance or accuracy by reducing the number of irrelevant,  correlated, and noise features. The section titled Feature Selection & Reduction  discusses the approaches for reducing the feature vector length by removing such  features.  3   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision   Feature Extraction It is unusual to apply the image in its native form as input to the training model.  There are different reasons why extracting features is a better way. One reason is  that images, even small ones, have a very large number of pixels, where each pixel is  applied as an input to the model. For a grayscale image of size 100×100 pixels, there are  100×100 = 10,000 input variables to be applied to the model. For a small dataset of 100  samples, there will be a total of 100×10,000 = 1,000,000 inputs across the entire dataset. If  the image is Red-Green-Blue  RGB , the total number is multiplied by 3. This requires a  large memory in addition to being computationally intensive.  Another reason why feature extraction is preferred before training is that the input   image has different types of objects with different properties, and we just want to target a  single object. For example, Figure 1-2 a  shows an image of a dog from the “Dogs Vs. Cats  Kaggle” competition. Our goal is to detect the dog, and we do not care about either the  wood or the grass. If the complete image is used as the input to the model, the wood and  the grass will affect the results. It is better to just use features exclusive to the dog. It is clear  that the dog color is different from other colors in the image, according to Figure 1-2 b .  Figure 1-2.  Targeting a specific object inside the image is easier when using features  Generally, successful modeling of the problem is tied to the selection of the best   features. The data scientist should select the most representative set of features for the  problem being solved. There are different types of features to be used to describe the  images. These features can be categorized in different ways. One way is to examine  whether they are extracted globally or locally from specific regions in the image. Local   4   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  features are those such as edge and keypoints. Global features are those such as color  histogram and pixel count. By global, it is meant that the feature describes the entire  image. Saying that the color histogram is centered at the left region means that the entire  image is dark. The description is not just for a specific region of the image. Local features  are focused on a specific something within the image such as the edges.  Subsequent subsections discuss the following features:     Color Histogram     Edge     HOG     Texture     GLCM     GLGCM     LBP   Color Histogram The color histogram represents the distribution of the colors across the image. It is  usually used with gray images, but there are modifications to use it with color images.  For simplicity, let’s calculate the color histogram for the 5×5 2-bit image in Figure 1-3.  The image has just 4 grayscale levels.

Based on the histogram, it is obvious that the high-frequency bins are located  to the right and thus the image is bright because most of its pixels are high.  Figure 1-4.  Histogram of a 2-bit 5×5 grayscale image  Listing 1-1 gives the Python code used to randomly generate the previous tiny image   in addition to calculating and displaying the histogram.  Listing 1-1.  Histogram for a Tiny Randomly Generated Image  import matplotlib.pyplot import numpy  rand_img = numpy.random.uniform low=0, high=3, size= 5,5   rand_img = numpy.uint8 rand_img  hist = numpy.histogram rand_img, bins=4  matplotlib.pyplot.bar left=[0,1,2,3], height=hist[0], align="center",  width=0.3  matplotlib.pyplot.xticks [0,1,2,3], fontsize=20  matplotlib.pyplot.yticks numpy.arange 0, 15, 2 , fontsize=20   6   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  The numpy.random.uniform   accepts the size of the array to be returned in addition   to the lower and higher bounds of the range from which image pixels will be assigned  values. The lower bound is 0 and the higher bound is 3 because we are looking to create  a 2-bit image. numpy.uint8   is used to convert the values from floating-point to integer.  Then, the histogram is calculated using numpy.histogram  , which accepts the image and  number of bins and returns the frequency of each level. Finally, matplotlib.pyplot.bar    is used to return a bar graph showing each level on the x axis and its frequency on the y  axis. matplotlib.pyplot.xticks   and matplotlib.pyplot.yticks   are used to change  the range of the x axis and y axis in addition to the display font size.   Histogram of a Real-World Image  Let’s calculate the histogram on a real-world image as in Figure 1-2 a  after converting it  to black-and-white. Both the grayscale image and the histogram are shown in Figure 1-5.   It seems that the histogram is mostly concentrated in the left part, which means the  image is generally dark. Because the dog’s body is white, part of the histogram is located  at the rightmost part of the histogram distribution.  Figure 1-5.  Grayscale image histogram  7   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Listing 1-2 gives the Python code for reading the color image, converting it to   grayscale, calculating its histogram, and finally plotting the histogram as a bar graph.  Listing 1-2.  Histogram for a Real-World Image  import matplotlib.pyplot import numpy import skimage.io  im = skimage.io.imread "69.jpg", as_grey=True  im = numpy.uint8 im*255   hist = numpy.histogram im, bins=256  matplotlib.pyplot.bar left=numpy.arange 256 , height= hist[0],  align="center", width=0.1   Using the skimage.io.imread   function, the image is both read and converted  to grayscale using the as_grey attribute. When set to True, the image is returned as  grayscale. The returned image data type is float64. To convert it to an unsigned integer  that ranges from 0 to 255, the numpy.uint8   is used. The image is firstly multiplied by  255 before conversion because numpy.uint8   does not rescale the inputs. It just makes  sure the numbers are integers represented by 8 bits. For example, applying a number  equal to 0.7 to this function, the result is 0. We want to rescale 0.4 from the 0–1 range to  the 0–255 range and then convert it into uint8. Without multiplying the inputs by 255, all  values will be just 0 or 1. Note that the number of histogram bins is set to 256 rather than  4 in the previous example because the image is represented as 8-bit.   HSV Color Space  Color histogram means that the image pixels are represented in one of the color  spaces, and then the frequency of the levels existing in such color spaces are counted.  Previously, the image was represented in the RGB color space, which ranges from 0 to  255 to each channel. But this is not the only existing color space.  Another color space that we will cover is HSV  Hue-Saturation-Value . The   advantage of this color space is the separation of color and illumination information.  The hue channel holds the color information and the other channels  saturaiton and  value  specifies the lightness of the color. It is useful to target the color rather than the  illumination and creating illumination-invariant features. We will not cover the HSV   8   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  color space in this book, but it is fine to read more about how colors are generated using  HSV. What is worth mentioning is that the hue channel represents a circle with its values  ranging from 0 to 360, where a degree of 0 represents red, 120 for green, 240 for blue, and  back to red at degree 360. So, it starts and ends at a red color.  For the image in Figure 1-2 a , the hue channel and its histogram are shown   in Figure 1-6. When the hue channel gets represented as the grayscale image as in  Figure 1-6 a , the red color will be given a high value  white , as shown in the dog collar.  Because the blue is given a high hue value of 240, it is lighter in the grayscale image.   The green color with a hue value of 140 is nearer to 0 than to 360; thus, it has a dark color.  Note that the dog’s body, which is white in RGB color space, looks black in the HSV.  The reason is that HSV is not responsible for the intensity but just the color. It will be  white in the value channel.  Figure 1-6.  Hue channel of a color image represented in HSV and its histogram  According to Listing 1-3, the RGB image is converted into HSV color space and its   hue channel histogram is displayed.  Listing 1-3.  Displaying the Image Histogram Using Matplotlib  import matplotlib.pyplot import numpy import skimage.io import skimage.color  9   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  im = skimage.io.imread "69.jpg", as_grey=False   im_HSV = skimage.color.rgb2hsv im  Hue = im_HSV[:, :, 0]  hist = numpy.histogram Hue, bins=360  matplotlib.pyplot.bar left=numpy.arange 360 , height=hist[0],  align="center", width=0.1   Because the hue channel is the first channel in the HSV color space, it is given the   index 0 to get returned.  Features are expected to be unique for different images. If different images have the   same features, the results will not be accurate. The color histogram has such a drawback,  as it could be identical for different images. The reason is that the color histogram just  counts the frequency of colors, whatever their arrangement in the image. Figure 1-7 a   transposed the image in Figure 1-3. Based on Figure 1-7 b , the histograms of the image  before and after transposition are identical despite the pixel locations being different.   cid:1007    cid:1005    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1004    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1006    cid:1006    cid:1004    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1007    cid:1004    cid:1006    cid:1006    cid:1006    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1007    cid:1006    cid:258  cid:3  cid:894  cid:100  cid:396  cid:258  cid:374  cid:400  cid:393  cid:381  cid:400  cid:286  cid:282  cid:3  cid:47  cid:373  cid:258  cid:336  cid:286  cid:895    cid:271  cid:3  cid:894  cid:44  cid:349  cid:400  cid:410  cid:381  cid:336  cid:396  cid:258  cid:373  cid:895   Figure 1-7.  Changing pixel locations does not change the color histogram  One may think that this is not a problem, as a good feature descriptor should   remain persistent even with changes to the image such as rotation and scale. The color  histogram is not able to meet this property, as it returns the same histogram even if  the images are completely different. To solve this problem, both the pixel intensity and  location should be considered to return a more representative feature. Examples of such  features are texture features such as GLCM.  10   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision   GLCM One of the popular statistical texture analysis methods depends on the second-order  statistics extracted from the spatial relationship between pairs of pixels. The most  popular of such features are ones extracted from the co-occurrence matrix  CM . One of  the CMs is the gray-level co-occurrence matrix  GLCM . Based on its name, it accepts a  grayscale image as input and returns GLCM matrix as output.  GLCM can be described as a two-dimensional histogram that counts the number of  co-occurrences between each pair of grayscale levels according to the distance between  them. What makes GLCM different from the first-order histogram is that GLCM depends  not just on the intensity but also on the spatial relationship of the pixels. For every two  pixels, one is called reference and the other is called neighbor. GLCM finds how many  times two intensity levels co-occur when the distance between them is D and the angle  is θ. GLCM 1, 3 ,D = 1,θ = 0  refers to how many times the reference pixel with the intensity  value of 1 co-occurs with its neighbor with intensity 3 when they are separated by  distance D = 1 and angle θ = 0 . When θ = 0, this means they are on the same horizontal  line. θ specifies the direction and D specifies the distance in that direction. Note that the  reference exists to the left side of the neighbor.  The steps to calculate the GLCM are as follows:    1.   If the input image was grayscale or binary, use it directly. If it was  a color image, convert it into the grayscale image or use just one of  its channels if appropriate.    2.  Find the total number of intensity levels in the image. If the   number is L, then number these levels from 0 to L − 1.    3.  Create an LxL matrix, where both rows and columns are   numbered from 0 to L − 1.    4.  Select the appropriate parameters of the GLCM  D, θ .   5.  Find the co-occurrence between every two pairs of intensity   levels.  11   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision   D Values  Research studies showed that the best values for D are ones ranging from 1 to 10. Larger  values will yield GLCMs that don’t capture the detailed textural information. So, the  results are accurate for D=1, 2, 4, 8, with D=1, 2 being the best. Normally, a pixel is likely  to be more correlated with pixels near to it. Decreasing the distance yields better results  than higher distances.   θ Values For a 3×3 matrix, the center pixel has 8 neighboring pixels. Between such center pixel  and all other 8 pixels, there are 8 possible values for θ as described in Figure 1-8.   cid:1005  cid:1007  cid:1009  cid:931   cid:1013  cid:1004  cid:931   cid:1008  cid:1009  cid:931   cid:1004  cid:931    cid:1005  cid:1012  cid:1004  cid:931   cid:87  cid:121  cid:62   cid:1006  cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:931   cid:1006  cid:1011  cid:1004  cid:931   cid:1007  cid:1005  cid:1009  cid:931   Figure 1-8.  Values of θ between the center pixel and its eight neighboring pixels  Because the co-occurring pairs obtained by choosing θ set to 0  and 180  are equal    i.e., GLCM 1, 3 ,θ = 0  = GLCM 3, 1 ,θ = 180  , only one angle is sufficient. Generally, angles  separated by 180  return the same results. This applies to angles  45 , 225  ,  135 , 315  ,  and  90 , 270  .  Let’s start to calculate the GLCM for the previous matrix in Figure 1-3, repeated  again in the matrix below, when D=1 and θ=0. Because that image has four intensity  levels, then the available pairs when the reference intensity is 0 are  0,0 ,  0,1 ,  0,2 , and   0,3 . When the reference intensity is 1, then the pairs are  1,0 ,  1,1 ,  1,2 , and  1,3 .  This continues for 2 and 3.  3  1  2  3  0  2  3  2  3  2  2  0  2  3  3  0  2  2  2  2  3  2  3  3  2  12   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Calculating GLCM 0, 0 ,D = 1,θ = 0 , the value will be 0. This is because there is no pixel with  intensity 0 that is 1 pixel away horizontally from another pixel with intensity 0. The result  is also 0 for pairs  0,1 ,  1,0 ,  1,1 ,  1,2 ,  2,1 , and  3,1 .  For GLCM 0, 2 ,D = 1,θ = 0 , the result is 2 because there are three times when the intensity   3 is located 1 pixel away from intensity 0 horizontally  i.e., θ = 0  . The result is also  2 for GLCM 3, 3 ,D = 1,θ = 0 . For GLCM 0, 3 ,D = 1,θ = 0 , the result is 1 because there is only one  occurrence of the intensity 3 with distance 1 and angle 0 from intensity 0. This is located  in the top right of the original matrix.  The complete GLCM is available in Figure 1-9. The matrix is of size 4×4 because it  has 4 intensity levels numbered from 0 to 3. The row and column labels are added to  make it easier to know which intensity level co-occurs with another.   cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1006    cid:1004    cid:1010    cid:1007    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1007    cid:1006   Figure 1-9.  GLCM of the matrix in Figure 1-3 where distance is 1 and angle is 0  The Python code used to return the preceding GLCM is given in Listing 1-4.  Listing 1-4.  GLCM Matrix Calculation  import numpy import skimage.feature  arr = numpy.array [[3, 2, 2, 0, 3],                    [1, 3, 0, 2, 2],                    [2, 2, 2, 2, 3],                    [3, 3, 3, 2, 3],                    [0, 2, 3, 2, 2]]   co_mat = skimage.feature.greycomatrix image=arr, distances=[1], angles=[0],  levels=4   13   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  The skimage.feature.greycomatrix   is used to calculate the GLCM. It accepts   the input image, distances, angles at which the matrix will be calculated, and finally, the  number of levels used. The number of levels is important, as the default is 256.  Note that there is a matrix for each unique pair of angles and distances. There is just  a single angle and distance used and thus a single GLCM matrix returned. The shape of  the returned output has four numbers as follows:  co_mat.shape =  4, 4, 1, 1   The first two numbers represent the number of rows and columns, respectively. The   third number represents the number of used distances. The last one is the number of  angles. If the matrix is to be calculated for more distances and angles, then specify them  in skimage.feature.greycomatrix  . The next line calculates the GLCM using two  distances and three angles.  co_mat = skimage.feature.greycomatrix image=arr, distances=[1, 4],  angles=[0, 45, 90], levels=4   The shape of the returned matrix is  co_mat.shape =  4, 4, 2, 3   Because there are two distances and three angles, the total number of returned   GLCMs is 2×3 = 6. To return the GLCM at distance 1 and angle 0 , the indexing will be as  follows:  co_mat[:, :, 0, 0]  This returns the complete 4×4 GLCM, but only for the first distance  1  and first angle   0  according to their order in the skimage.feature.greycomatrix   function. To return  the GLCM corresponding to distance 4 and angle 90 , the indexing will be as follows:  co_mat[:, :, 1, 2]   GLCM Normalization  The previously calculated GLCMs are useful for learning how many times each intensity  level co-occurs with each other. We can benefit from such information to predict   the probability of co-occurrence between each two intensity levels. The GLCM can   be converted into a probability matrix, and thus we can know the probability of   co- occurrence between each of two intensity levels l1 and l2 when separated by distance   14   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  D and angle θ. This is done by dividing each element in the matrix by the sum of matrix  elements. The resulting matrix is called the normalized or probability matrix. Based  on Figure 1-9, the sum of all elements is 20. After dividing each element by that, the  normalized matrix is shown in Figure 1-10.   cid:1004    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004    cid:1006    cid:1007    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1005    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004  cid:1009    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004  cid:1009    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004  cid:1009    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1007    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1005  cid:1009    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004  cid:1009    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1004    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1005  cid:1009    cid:1004  cid:856  cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1006    cid:1007   Figure 1-10.  Normalized GLCM matrix with distance 1 and angle 0  One benefit from normalizing the GLCM is that all elements in the output matrix   are in the same scale from 0.0 to 1.0. Moreover, the results are independent of the image  size. For example, the highest frequency according to Figure 1-9 of size 5×5 is 6 for the  pair  2,2 . If a new image is larger  e.g., 100×100 , the highest frequency will not be 6  but a larger value such as 2,000. We can’t compare 6 by 2,000 because such numbers  are relevant to the image size. By normalizing the matrix, the elements of the GLCM are  independent of the image size and thus we can compare them correctly. In Figure 1-10,  the pair  2,2  is given a probability of 0.3, which is comparable with the probability of co- occurrence from any image of any size.  Normalizing the GLCM in Python is very simple. Based on a boolean parameter   called “normed”, if set to True the result will be normalized. It is set to False by default.  The normalized matrix is calculated according to this line:  co_mat_normed = skimage.feature.greycomatrix image=arr, distances=[1],  angles=[0], levels=4, normed=True   The GLCM is of size 4×4 because we are using a 2-bit image with just 4 levels. For  the 8-bit grayscale image in Figure 1-2 a , there are 256 levels and thus the matrix size  is 256×256. The normalized GLCM is shown in Figure 1-11. The probabilities are large  for two regions. The first one is at the top left  low intensity  as the background has dark  colors. The other region is at the bottom right  high intensity  for the dog’s body, because  its color is white.  15   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Figure 1-11.  GLCM matrix of a grayscale image with 256 levels with distance 6  and angle 0  As the number of levels increases, the size of the matrix will increase. The GLCM  in Figure 1-11 has 256×256 = 65,536 elements. Using all elements in the matrix in the  feature vector will increase its length greatly. We can reduce this number by extracting  some features from the matrix, including dissimilarity, correlation, homogeneity, energy,  contrast, and ASM  angular second moment . Listing 1-5 gives the Python code required  to extract such features.  Listing 1-5.  Extracting GLCM Features  import skimage.io, skimage.feature import numpy  img = skimage.io.imread 'im.jpg', as_grey=True ;  img = numpy.uint8 img*255   16   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  glcm = skimage.feature.greycomatrix img, distances=[6], angles=[0],  levels=256, normed=True   dissimilarity = skimage.feature.greycoprops P=glcm, prop='dissimilarity'  correlation = skimage.feature.greycoprops P=glcm, prop='correlation'  homogeneity = skimage.feature.greycoprops P=glcm, prop='homogeneity'  energy = skimage.feature.greycoprops P=glcm, prop='energy'  contrast = skimage.feature.greycoprops P=glcm, prop='contrast'  ASM = skimage.feature.greycoprops P=glcm, prop='ASM'   glcm_props = [dissimilarity, correlation, homogeneity, energy, contrast, ASM]  print 'Dissimilarity',dissimilarity,'\nCorrelation',correlation,  '\nHomogeneity',homogeneity,'\nEnergy',energy,'\nContrast',contrast,  '\nASM',ASM   One drawback of GLCM is being dependent on the grayscale values. Just a small   change in the illumination affects the resulting GLCM. One solution is to build the  CM using gradients rather than intensities. Such a matrix is called gray-level gradient-  based co-occurrence matrix  GLGCM  . By using gradients, GLGCM is invariant to the  illumination changes.  Both GLCM and GLGCM are variant to image transformations. That is, if the same   grayscale image is affected by a transformation such as rotation, the descriptor will yield  different features. A good feature descriptor should be invariant to such effects.   HOG GLCM is used to describe the image texture but it can’t describe the abrupt changes in  image intensities  i.e., edges . Sometimes texture is not the suitable feature to use in a  problem, and we have to look for another feature. One category of feature descriptors is  used to describe the image edges. Such features describe different aspects of the edges  such as edge direction or orientation, edge position, and edge strength or magnitude.  This subsection discusses a descriptor called histogram of oriented gradients  HOG    that describes the edge orientations. Sometimes, the target objects have a unique  direction of movement, and thus HOG is a suitable feature. HOG creates a histogram  of a number of bins representing the frequency of the edge orientations. Let’s see how  HOG works.  17   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision   Image Gradients  There are changes in intensities between every pair of neighboring pixels within the image.  To measure that change, the gradient vector for every pixel is calculated to measure how  the intensity changes from this pixel to its neighboring pixels. That vector’s magnitude is  the difference in intensities between two pixels. The vector also reflects the direction of  change in terms of X direction and Y direction. For the grayscale image in Figure 1-12, let’s  calculate the change in the intensity in both X and Y directions for pixel 21 in the third row  and the fourth column.   cid:1009  cid:1012   cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1008   cid:1008  cid:1007   cid:1006  cid:1006  cid:1006   cid:1006  cid:1006   cid:1005  cid:1006   cid:1013  cid:1011   cid:1009  cid:1007   cid:1006  cid:1005   cid:1013  cid:1005   cid:1013  cid:1012   cid:1010  cid:1007   cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1006   cid:1004   cid:1005  cid:1005   cid:1006  cid:1007   cid:1013  cid:1006    cid:1010  cid:1012   cid:1006  cid:1007   cid:1012  cid:1012   cid:1008  cid:1006    cid:1009  cid:1004   cid:1012  cid:1007   cid:1004   cid:1007  cid:1006   Figure 1-12.  Grayscale image to calculate its gradients  Masks to use to find the gradient magnitude in X and Y directions are in Figure 1-13.   Let’s start calculating the gradients.  Figure 1-13.  Masks to calculate the horizontal and vertical gradients  By centering the horizontal mask on the target pixel, we can calculate the gradient   in the X direction. In this case, the neighboring pixels are 83 and 98. By subtracting these  values, either subtract the left pixel from the pixel to the right or right from left but be  consistent across the entire image: the amount of change at this pixel is 98 − 83 = 15. The  angle used in this case is 0 .  18   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  To get the amount of change at that pixel in the Y direction, the vertical mask is   centered at the target pixel. Then, the top and left pixels for that pixel are subtracted to  return 63 − 53 = 10. The angle used in this case is 90 .  After calculating the change in both X and Y directions, next is to calculate the final   gradient magnitude according to Equation 1-1 and also the gradient direction according  to Equation 1-2.        Z  =  X  +2  Y  2    Angle  =  - tan 1     Y X   Equation 1-1    Equation 1-2   The gradient magnitude is equal to  15  2  +  10  2  =  18 03  .  .   Gradient Direction  Regarding the gradient direction, one might say that the direction of change for that pixel  is at 0  because the magnitude at the 0  is higher than the vector at 90 . Others might  say, however, that the pixel doesn’t change at either 0  or 90  but at an in-between angle.  Such an angle is calculated by taking both X and Y directions into regard. The direction   of that vector is  tan  56 31 . As a result, that pixel direction of change is at 56.31 .  .     1 15 - 10  =  After calculating the angles for all images, the next step is to create a histogram for   such angles. To make the histogram smaller, not all angles are used but just a set of  predefined angles. The most common angles to use are horizontal  0  , vertical  90  ,  and diagonal  45  and 135  . Each angle contributes by a value equal to its gradient  magnitude calculated according to Equation 1-3. For example, if the current pixel  contributes to the Z bin, it adds a value of 18.03 to it.   Contributing to Histogram Bins  The angle we previously calculated is 56.31 . It is not one of the previously selected  angles. The solution is to assign that angle to the nearest histogram bin. 56.31  is located  between bins 45  and 90 . Because 56.31  is nearer to 45  than 90 , it will be assigned to  the bin 45 . A better way is to split the contribution of that pixel to both of these angles   45  and 90  .  19   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  The distance between the angles 45  and 90  is 45 . The distance between the angle   56.31  and 45  is just ∣56.31  − 45  ∣  = 11.31. That means the angle of 56.31  is far away  from 45  by a percentage equal to  Similarly, the distance between the angle 56.31  and 95  is just ∣56.31  − 90  ∣  = 33.69.  That means the angle of 56.31  is far away from 90  by a percentage equal to  . 33 69   45  . The value by which the angle adds to a bin is calculated according to   . 11 32   45  . In other words, 56.31  is 75% near to 45 .    25  75  %  %  %  %  =  =  Equation 1-3.     contribution  value     =  abs pixel bin  spacing  -  bin  angle  angle        pixel  g rradientMagnitude        Equation 1-3   Where pixelangle is the direction of the current pixel, pixelgradientMagnitude is the current   pixel gradient magnitude, binangle is the histogram bin value, and binspacing is the amount  of space between every two bins.  As a result, the angle of 56.31  adds to 45  a percentage of 75% of its gradient   magnitude, which is equal to   . It adds just 25% of its gradient   magnitude to 45  to 90 , which is equal to   x  .= 18 03 4 5  .  .  75 100  x  =  .  18 03 13 5 . 25 100  A more practical histogram contains nine angles starting from 0  and ending at 180 .   The difference between every pair of angles will be 180 9=20. Thus the angles used are  0 , 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 , 120 , 140 , 160 , and 180 . The bins are not these angles but the  center of each range. For the 0 –20  range, the bin used is 10 . For 20 –40 , the bin is 30 ,  and so on. The final histogram bins are 10 , 30 , 50 , 70 , 90 , 110 , 130 , 150 , and 170 .   If an angle is 25 , it adds to the bins it is located between. That is, it adds to bins 10     by 0.25  and 30   by 0.75 .  By repeating the preceding steps on pixel 68 located at the second row and the  second column, the result of applying the horizontal mask is 97 − 50 = 47, which is  the gradient change in the X direction. After applying the vertical mask, the result is  43 − 23 = 20. The direction of change is calculated as follows based on Equation 1-2:  Angle =  tan  - 1  =  tan  =     23  Y X  1 20 - 47  20   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Again, the resultant angle is not equal to any of the histogram bins. Thus the   contribution of this angle is split across the bins it falls in between, which are 15  and 45 .  It adds 0.27 to 45  and 0.73 to 45 .  For the pixel located at the fourth row and the second column with intensity value   88, the change in in the X direction is 0. Applying Equation 1-2, the result will be  divided by 0. To avoid dividing by zeros, add a very small value such as 0.0000001 to the  denominator.   HOG Steps  By this point, we have learned how to calculate the gradient magnitude and direction  for any pixel. But there is still some work to be done before and after calculating these  values. A summary of HOG steps is as follows:    1.  Split the input image into patches with aspect ratio 1:2. For   example, the patch size might be 64×128, 100×200, and so on.    2.  Divide patches into blocks  e.g., four blocks .    3.  Divide each block into cells. Cell size within the block is not fixed.     For example, if the block size is 16×16 and we determined to  divide it into four cells, the size of each cell is 8×8. Note also  that blocks might overlap with each other and one cell might be  available in multiple blocks.    4.  For each cell within each block, calculate the gradient magnitude   and direction for all pixels.     Gradients are calculated based on the masks in Figure 1-13.     Gradient magnitude and direction are calculated according to   Equations 1-1 and 1-2, respectively.    5.  Based on the gradient magnitudes and directions, build the   histogram for each cell. If the number of angles used to constitute  the histogram is nine, then a 9×1 feature vector is returned by  each cell. The histogram is calculated according to our previous  discussion.  21   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision    6.  Concatenate all histograms of all cells within the same block and   return just a single histogram for the entire block. If each cell  histogram is represented by nine bins and each block has four  cells, then the concatenated histogram length is 4×9=36. This 36×1  is vector is the result of each block.    7.  The vector is normalized to make it robust against illumination   changes.    8.  Concatenate the normalized vectors for all blocks within the   image patch to return the final feature vector.  Figure 1-14 shows a patch from the image in Figure 1-5 a  of size 64×128.  Figure 1-14.  Image patch to calculate its HOG  Before creating the histogram, the vertical and horizontal gradients are calculated  according to the vertical and horizontal masks. The gradients are shown in Figure 1-15.  22   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Figure 1-15.

Gradient magnitude and direction of the top-left 8×8 cell   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  The histogram will be created based on the simple examples we previously   discussed. There are 9 histogram bins covering the range of angles from 0 to 180.  Representing such range using just a limited number of bins makes each bin cover more  than one angle. Using just 9 bins, then each one will cover 20 angles. The first bin covers  angles from 0  inclusive  to 20  exclusive . The second one from 20  inclusive  to 40   exclusive , until the last bin that covers angles from 160  inclusive  to 180  inclusive .  The bin for each range will be given a number equal to the center of each range. That is  the first bin is given 10, second bin 20, and so on until the last bin which is given 170. We  can say that the bins starts from 10 to 170 with step 20. For each angle in Figure 1-18 a ,  the two histogram bins it falls within are found. Starting with the top-left element with  value 44.41, it falls between bins 30 and 50. That value contributes to both of these bins  according to Equation 1-3. The contribution value for bin 30 is calculated as follows:  contribution  value =  abs     44 41 30  -      207 19  .    =  . 20  0 72 207 19 149 .  .  .228  ´  =  Regarding bin 50, the contribution value is calculated as follows:  contribution  value =  abs     44 41 50  -      207 19  .    =  . 20  0 28 207 19 57 9 . . 11  .  ´  =  The process continues for all 8×8 pixels in the current cell. The histogram for the   top-left cell is shown in Figure 1-19 a . Assuming that each block contains 2×2 cells, the  9-bin histograms of the three remaining cells in the top-left block marked in bright color  in Figure 1-17 are also shown in Figure 1-19. By calculating all histograms for a given  block, its feature vector is the concatenation of these four 9-bin histograms. The length of  the feature vector is 9×4 = 36.  28   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  Figure 1-19.

The motivation to feature normalization is that the feature vector is dependent on  the image intensity levels, and it is better to make it robust against illumination changes.  Normalization takes place by dividing each element in the vector by the vector length  calculated according to Equation 1-4.     vector  length  =  X  1  +  X  2  +¼+  X  n      Equation 1-4   Where Xi represents the vector element number i. The normalized vector is the result   of the first block. The process continues until returning all 36×1 feature vectors for all  blocks. These vectors are then concatenated for the entire image patch being processed.  Based on the preceding discussion, HOG has the following parameters to be   specified before its calculation:    1.  Number of orientations.    2.  Number of pixels per cell.    3.  Number of cells per block.  HOG is already implemented in Python in the skimage.feature module and could   be easily used according to the skimage.feature.hog   function. The preceding  three parameters have default values that could be changed to meet your goals. If the  normalized parameter is set to True then the normalized HOG is returned.  skimage.feature.hog image, orientations=9, pixels_per_cell= 8, 8 ,  cells_per_block= 3, 3 , visualise=False, transform_sqrt=False, feature_ vector=True, normalise=None    LBP LBP stands for local binary patterns, which is another second-order texture descriptor.  The steps to extract the LBP features are as follows:    1.  Divide the image into blocks  e.g., 16×16 blocks .    2.  For each block, a 3×3 window gets centered over each pixel.  36   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  The selected central pixel Pcentral is compared to each of its surrounding 8 neighbors   Pneighbor according to Equation 1-5. From the eight comparisons, there will be eight binary  digits.     P neighbor  =  ì , 1 í 0 , î  > P P central neighbor otherwise      Equation 1-5     3.  The 8-bit binary code is converted into an integer. The integer   ranges from 0 to 28 = 255.    4.  Replace the Pcentral value with the calculated integer.    5.  After calculating the new values for all pixels within the same   block, the histogram is calculated.    6.  After calculating the histograms across all blocks, they get   concatenated.  Assuming that the block we are currently working on is in Figure 1-12, we can start   calculating the basic LBP based on it.  By working on the pixel at the third row and the fourth column, the center pixel is   compared to each of the eight neighbors. Figure 1-22 shows the results of the comparison.   cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005   Figure 1-22.  The result of comparing the central pixel to its eight neighbors  Next is to return the binary code. You can start from any position in the 3×3 matrix  but you must be consistent across the entire image. For example, starting from the top-  left position and moving clockwise, the code is 11011101. You can either move clockwise  or counterclockwise, but be consistent.  After that, the binary code is converted into a decimal by summing the   multiplications of each binary by a weight corresponding to its position in the binary  code. The result is 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 221.  After calculating the binary code for each pixel in the block and returning its   decimal, the histogram is created. The process is repeated for all image blocks, and  histograms from all blocks are concatenated as in the case of HOG.  37   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  This is the basic implementation of LBP, but such a feature descriptor has multiple   variations that make it robust against illumination changes, scale, and rotation.  It could be implemented easily in Python using the skimage.feature.local_  binary_pattern   function that accepts three parameters:      Input image.     Number of neighboring points in a circle  P . This parameter helps to   achieve rotation invariance.     Radius of the circle  R . Such parameter helps to achieve scale   invariance.  Here is an example of LBP applied to the grayscale image in Figure 1-2 a .  import skimage.feature import skimage.io import matplotlib.pyplot  im = skimage.io.imread "69.jpg", as_grey=True  lbp = skimage.feature.local_binary_pattern image=im, P=9, R=3  matplotlib.pyplot.imshow lbp, cmap="gray"  matplotlib.pyplot.xticks []  matplotlib.pyplot.yticks []   The output image is given in Figure 1-23.

These features are just selected initially, and there is a  probability that some of these features might not be helpful. You decide whether each  feature is good or bad based on some experimentation. After training a model based on  these three features, the recognition rate is low and something must be changed in the  feature vector. To know the reason, you conducted some experiments by training the  model for each individual feature. You found that the correlation between feature Z and  the target is low and thus decided not to use this feature. Eliminating certain features  completely from the feature vector and keeping others is called feature selection.  Selection techniques classify the feature as either bad or good. Bad features are  eliminated completely while the good features are used exclusively.  In fact, some elements inside each feature might not be suitable for the type of   application being analyzed. Assume that a feature X is used within the feature vector  and that this feature has a set of 10 elements. One or more of these elements might not  be helpful in the task. For example, some features are redundant. That is some features  may be optimally correlated with each other, and thus only one feature is sufficient in  describing the data and there is no need to use multiple features that work the same.  Due to correlated features, there might not exist a unique optimal feature subset. This is  because there may be more than one perfectly correlated feature, so one can replace the  other and create a new feature subset.  Another type is the irrelevant features. Some features have no correlation with the  predictions required and they are regarded as noise. Such features won’t enhance but  rather degrade the results. So, it is preferred to detect such features and remove them so  they don’t affect the learning process. Removing just a subset of elements and keeping  the others is called feature reduction.  Another motivation behind reducing the length of the feature vector by removing  bad features as much as possible is that the longer the feature vector length the more  computational time is consumed in training and testing the models.  To classify features as relevant or irrelevant, some metrics are required to show the  relevance of each feature with the output classes or how well each feature predicts the  desired outputs. Feature relevance is the ability of a feature to discriminate the different  classes. After the selection of the metrics, they will be used to create good feature  subsets by eliminating bad features. The feature elimination methods are classified into  supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods include filter and wrapper,  and unsupervised methods include embedded.  39    reCognition in Computer Vision  Chapter 1   Filter The filter approach adds an additional preprocessing step to apply variable ranking  techniques for ranking features based on different criteria calculated for each feature to  measure the feature’s relevance. These criteria include standard deviation  STD , energy,  entropy, correlation, and mutual information  MI . Based on a threshold, the highly  ranked features are selected to train the model. The filter methods are very fast and not  time-consuming compared to other selection approaches. They are also simple in their  calculations, scalable, able to avoid overfitting, and independent of the learning model.  For training different models, the selection is done just once and then the training   models can use the selected features. But filter methods have a number of critical drawbacks  that affect their performance heavily compared to other approaches to feature selection. The  filter ranking approach doesn’t model feature dependencies. It selects each variable feature  independently from the other features variables in the same subset. A feature is selected  when being highly ranked according to the selected criterion. The criterion used for ranking  doesn’t take into consideration the relationship among multiple features. Ignoring feature  dependencies can damage the entire selected subset because features that are significant by  themselves in increasing the learning rate are not guaranteed to be so when combined with  other features. There are some cases in which useful variables by themselves are still useful  when combined together, but this is not always the case.  If the usefulness of two features f1 and f2 are x1 and x2 respectively, this doesn’t  mean that their usefulness will be x1 + x2 when combined together. Also, ignoring  feature dependencies makes it prone to redundant and correlated features. This is  because there may be two or more features that perfectly satisfy the criterion but each  of them is a perfect reflection of all the others doing the same task. So it is not required  to use multiples of the same thing; just one is sufficient. Correlation is another form  of redundancy in which features may not be identical but are dependent and always  work the same  can be represented as two parallel lines . Perfectly correlated variables  are truly redundant as they add no additional information. The use of redundant  and correlated features leads to a large feature vector, and thus the benefits of feature  selection to reduce the feature vector length is not achieved. Filter methods don’t  interact with the learning model, as they are not relying on the learning algorithm  performance due to decoupling the feature selection from the performance. Instead,  these just consider a single criterion between the feature and the class label but not  information to indicate how well the feature is working with the learning algorithm.   A good feature selector should take into account how both the learning algorithm and   40   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  the training data set interact. Finally, it is not an easy task to calculate the threshold used  to classify features as selected or not. All of these reasons lead to the use of other feature  selection approaches that overcome these problems.   Wrapper The wrapper approach is the second approach that solves some of the problems with the  filter methods. The wrapper methods try to interact with the learning model by creating  a subset of selected features that maximize the performance. The wrapper approach  creates all possible subsets of features to find the best subset. The wrapper approach is  called so because it is wrapping around the learning algorithm. It uses the induction or  learning algorithm as a black box to measure how well the selected feature subset works  by training the algorithm with the selected subsets and then to use the one that maximizes  its performance. When talking about the wrapper approach, multiple points should be  covered well, including selecting feature subset length, creating the feature subset space,  searching the feature subset space, assessing the performance of the learning algorithms,  stopping search criteria, and determining which learning algorithms to use. The goal of  any feature reduction selection algorithm is to create all possible feature combinations  of length L features from an original complete feature vector of length N that maximizes  the performance where <N. For a normal feature vector length of =30, there is a large  number of combinations to create subsets of length L = 10. For this reason, a search  strategy is applied to search for the best subsets with an evaluation function penalizing bad  subsets. The objective function, in this case, is the model performance. So, the problem is  transformed from a learning problem to a search problem. The exhaustive search is not  applicable for such problem, because it visits and train a learning model with all subsets,  which is intensive in terms of calculations. So, evolutionary algorithms  EAs  are used  to avoid exploring all subsets, and these can be categorized into two classes: sequential  selection algorithms  deterministic  and heuristic search algorithms  random .  The deterministic search algorithms are further classified into two categories that   are actually pretty similar, namely, forward selection and backward selection. In forward  selection, the algorithm starts from a root representing an empty set of features and then  adds feature by feature while training the learning model for each change. In backward  selection, the root of the search is the complete set of features, and the algorithm then  removes features one by one while training the learning model for each change. Examples  of such algorithms include sequential feature selection  SFS , sequential backward  selection  SBS , sequential forward floating selection  SFFS , adaptive SFFS  ASFFS ,    41   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  and beam search. To prevent the search from being exhaustive, a stopping criterion is  added to prevent exploring all possible combinations. The criterion can be a maximum  feature vector length for forward selection or minimum length for backward selection.  It can also be a maximum performance, so after reaching the selected performance, the  search stops.  The second category of search algorithms, random algorithms, are informed   searches that use a heuristic evaluation function, generating a heuristic value telling   how close each subset is to the maximum performance. Examples of such search  algorithms include genetic algorithm  GA , particle swarm optimization  PSO ,  simulated annealing  SA , and randomized hill climbing. GA will be discussed in   detail in Chapter 5.  A question that must be answered is what is the optimal value for L  number of   features ? Wrapper methods have different approaches to answer that question. One  way is to select a fixed number of features to create the feature vector, and by using  combinations, it is possible to get all possibilities to select just L features from N features.  But unfortunately, the selected fixed value for L may not be the optimal one and there  is no guarantee that the L selected features are the ones that give the best performance  for the learning model. So, another way is to make the number of features to be selected  variable and dynamically changing. This is by trying a different number of features and  selecting the best number of features that maximize the performance as in the sequential  selection algorithms. The drawback of making the number of features dynamically  changing is adding more and more computational time by creating different features  combinations of different lengths and training the model with them. To reduce this  time, a criterion can be added to make the learning stop earlier after reaching a target  performance or after the number of selected features reaches a maximum length. Comparing the wrapper approach to the filter approach, there are a number of   advantages. The wrapper approach interacts with the learning model as it uses the learning  algorithm performance as a metric to select the best feature subsets. It also models feature  dependencies, as features are not selected individually or independently from each other,  and monitors how combining features together affects the performance. Finally, it is robust  against redundant and correlated features. But there are a number of drawbacks to the  various wrapper methods. They are time- consuming, as each model has to be trained  multiple times. Some models are very time- consuming and may take hours to be trained  once. As a result, wrapper methods are not the option for such models. Moreover, wrapper  methods are affected by overfitting as the selection is dependent on the learning model and  thus can’t generalize selected features across different models.  42   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision   Embedded Both filter and wrapper approaches to feature selection have their own advantages and  disadvantages. The embedded methods try to combine the advantages of both filter  and wrapper approaches. Such methods are not time-consuming, as they avoid the  retraining of the learning algorithm that is seen in the filter and wrapper approaches.  They maximize the performance by interacting with the learning model, as in the  wrapper approach. The feature is selected only if it is correlated with the output class  labels m. It is called embedded because it works by embedding feature selection within  the training step.  Categories of the embedded approach are as follows: pruning, built-in, and   regularization  penalization . Pruning methods start by training the learning model with  the complete set of features and then calculate a correlation coefficient for each feature.  Such coefficients are used to rank the importance of the features according to the model  used. High values for coefficients reflect strong correlation. The built-in approach  for embedded feature selection calculates an information gain for each feature as in  decision tree learning  ID3 .  In machine learning  ML , some models are trained very well and can make the  correct predictions for any sample in the training data but unfortunately can’t make  correct predictions for other samples outside the training samples. This problem  is called overfitting. Regularization is a technique used to avoid this problem.  Regularization is to tune or select the best model complexity to fit the training data  while being able to predict unseen samples. Without regularization, the model may be  very simple and underfit  can’t make correct predictions for both training and testing  samples  or be very complex and overfit  correct predictions for training samples but  wrong for testing samples . Both underfit and overfit make the model too weak and  unable to be generalized to any sample. So, regularization is a way of generalizing the  model to predict any sample, whether training or testing.   Regularization In order to find the best model, the common method in ML is to define a loss or cost  function that describes how well the model fits the data. The goal is to find the model  that minimizes this loss function. Normally, the objective function in any learning model  has only a single criterion, which is maximizing the performance. The regularization   43   Chapter 1    reCognition in Computer Vision  approach adds another criterion to the objective function to control the level of  complexity, as shown in Equation 1-6.  L =  min error Ypredict, Ycorrect  + λ penalty Wi     Equation 1-6   Where Ypredict is the predicted class label, Ycorrect is the correct class label, error .    calculates the prediction error, Wi is the weight for the feature element Xi, and λ is the  regularization parameter controlling the model complexity. This parameter is used to  control the trade-off between the objective function and the penalty. The penalty is  defined according to Equation 1-7.       penalty w    =  å  = 1  i  W i      Equation 1-7   By changing λ values, the model complexity changes. This is by penalizing some   features by setting their weights close or equal to zero. The magnitude of coefficients is  a significant factor in determining the model complexity. Feature selection is indirectly  achieved by selecting features with high weight magnitudes. The higher the weights, the  more relevant is the feature in predicting the correct class. This is why the regularization  approach is called penalization.  The goal of the regularization parameter λ is to minimize the loss L and keep it to  a minimum. For a very large value for λ approaching ∞, the coefficients must be small  and approach zero to make the total value as small as possible. This makes most of  the coefficient zero and thus remove them. For a value of 0 < ʎ < ∞, there will be some  coefficients equal to zero, which will be removed, but not many of them equal to zero.  What is the best value for λ? There is no fixed value for λ and its value can be efficiently  calculated using cross-validation  CV .  Combining the advantages of filter and wrapper approaches makes the embedded   approach the most recent research trend for feature selection. It interacts with the  learning model because it uses the training model performance as a metric like the  wrapper methods, is not time-consuming like the filter methods because it doesn’t  require retraining the model, and also models feature dependencies to avoid redundant  and correlated features. Selecting features while training is efficient in terms of data use,  as it is not required to split the data into training and validation sets. However, while  features selected by embedded methods do well for the learning model used to select the  features, the selected features may be dependent on such model and won’t work as well  across different models as what is produced with the filter approach.  44   CHAPTER 2  Artificial Neural Networks  Machine learning  ML  problems can be divided into three categories: supervised,  unsupervised, and reinforcement. In supervised learning, a human expert conducts  some experiments in a restricted environment and notices their results. The supervised  learning algorithm explores the data collected from experiments to map inputs to  outputs. For example, a restricted environment might have a robot that wants to go  from one side of a small room to another. There are some obstacles in the room that  may make the robot fall. The supervisor provides guidance about how to reach the wall  without falling. This is done by giving the robot knowledge in the form of examples  to help it learn how to pass obstacles. The robot uses this knowledge to increase the  probability of passing the obstacle without falling. In such a case, the knowledge of the  robot is completely dependent on the human.  In reinforcement learning, the human gives the robot a metric to evaluate its   performance. The robot has to maximize this metric to reach its goal. It does not know  when to move to the right. Based on the metric, the robot will try different locations  to move and calculates the metric. If the robot fell at a given location, then it has to  avoid it next time. In this way, the robot will find the way that makes it reach the goal  without falling.  Compared to supervised and semisupervised learning, unsupervised learning will   not be given the results of the experiments nor a metric. There is no human to guide it at  all. This is very challenging.  An artificial neural network  ANN for short  is a kind of algorithm that works in all   of these problems. This book only discusses supervised learning using ANN. ANN is  a biologically inspired ML model that mimics the operation of the human brain. It is  one of the most important topics to be covered when talking about deep learning  DL .  Understanding the operation of simple ANNs with few layers and neurons makes it  easier to understand how complex models work.    Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7_2  45   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  In this chapter, prerequests to learn how CNNs work will be presented. It starts by  exploring ANN at a beginner level. Starting by knowing that it is a collection of linear  models, you will find that it is not a strange concept at all; in fact, you already know  about it. The chapter discusses some concepts related to ANN, such as learning rate,  backpropagation, and overfitting. This chapter will help you understand why we need  the learning rate in ANNs and whether it is useful or not for training. Using a very simple  Python code for a single-layer perceptron, the learning rate value will get changed  to catch its idea and notice how changing the learning rate affects the results. It also  discusses how the backpropagation algorithm is useful in updating the ANN weights.  This chapter also explains overfitting, which is one of the reasons for poor predictions  for unseen samples. A regularization technique based on regression is presented by  simple steps to make it clear how to avoid overfitting. ANN has a special graph to make  interpretation of its results easier. This chapter maps the mathematical representation  and its graph and explores one of the points that make beginners struggle, which is  how to determine the best number of neurons and hidden layers. Finally, a Python  classification example using ANN is given.   Introduction to ANNs Supervised learning problems are divided into two main categories: classification  and regression. Regression outputs are continuous numbers, while classification  outputs are categorical labels. Each type of these problems can use either a linear or a  nonlinear model. Classification problems can also be divided into binary or multiclass  classification problems. All of these types of problems can be solved using neural  networks. That is, a neural network can be made to produce continuous or discrete  outputs. It can work with binary or multiclass problems and model linear and nonlinear  functions. ANN is a general function approximator  i.e., ANN can simulate the operation  of any linear and nonlinear functions . ANN is a parametric model that has a set of  parameters that are learned from the problem, such as weights and bias. It also has a  number of hyperparameters that can be tuned by the engineer, such as learning rate and  the number of hidden layers.  ANNs actually consist of linear models that are grouped together to solve complex   problems. The next subsection discusses how the basic building block of ANN is actually  a linear model.  46   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks   Linear Models Are the Base of ANNs The simplest types of models for beginners to start with are the linear models. Of course,  everyone knows about linear models, and this makes the next explanation easier. We can  start with a simple regression problem in which we are looking to create a linear model  for the sample shown in Table 2-1. What is the best linear model to fit such data? Let’s see.  Table 2-1.  Simple Regression Problem  Input  X   2  Output  Y   6  “Linear model” means a line that maps each input to its corresponding output. We   will start with the simplest linear model, as in Equation 2-1. The model equalizes the  input and the output together without having any other parameters in the equation.  After doing that, then we create our first model. One may wonder, where is the   training part of building any model? The answer is that this model is a nonparametric  model. “Nonparametric” means that the model has no parameters to learn from the  data. Thus, no training is required to do the job. Later in this chapter, some parameters  will be added.     Y = X    Equation 2-1   In a regular ML pipeline, after building a model we have to test it. In traditional  problems, there will be more samples and the data will be divided into training and  testing sets. After training the model, testing starts based on the training data. If it did  well on the training data, then we can step through testing it over the unseen test data.  This is because if a model is not working well on the data it is trained by, then it will likely  to be worse for the unseen data. At all, our example takes us off such work, as it just has  one sample and no training required. But the lack of training phase does not mean that  there is no testing phase. Let’s test our model based on such a sample.  The testing phase checks how accurate the model for predicting the outputs for  unseen samples rather than ones using in training. Based on our sample with X=2,  when applied to the model it will also return 2. This is because the input always equals  the output. The linear model, in addition to the positions of the predicted and desired  outputs, is shown in Figure 2-1.  47   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-1.  The nonparametric linear model’s predicted and desired outputs  We can simply take the difference between the desired and the predicted outputs as   in Equation 2-2. The difference will be 2 − 6 =  − 4.  error = predicted − desired    Equation 2-2   The existence of an error means we have to change something in the model in   order to reduce it. Looking back at the model in Equation 2-1, we see that there is no  parameter that we could change. The equation just has the input and the output that we  could not change. As a result, we could add a parameter a to this equation, which helps  in the mapping between the input and the output. Equation 2-3 shows the modified  model equation.  Y = aX    Equation 2-3   Let’s say that a has an initial value of 1.5. The equation is given in Equation 2-3ʹ.   Such a linear model is shown in Figure 2-2.  Y = 1.5X    Equation 2-3′            48   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-2.  Parametric linear model  Note that after adding the parameter, the model is now a parametric model. This is  because there is at least one parameter to be learned from the data. Now, after building  the new model, we could predict the output of our sample. The predicted output is  Ypredicted = 1.5 2  = 3. Then we can measure the error. According to Equation 2-2, the  error is 3 − 6 =  − 3. Compared to the previous error, it seems that the new model  with parameter a = 1.5 enhances the results compared to the previous model with no  parameter. But there still error in the prediction that we need to reduce.  We can imagine that the first model in Equation 2-1 is actually represented by   Equation 2-3, but the parameter a is always set to 1. Comparing the error produced  when a = 1 to the error when a = 1.5, which is −4, it seems that the error reduced when  a = 1.5 to be −3. One might wonder how the value −3 is less than −4. The answer is that  the negative sign in the error just says the predicted output is lower than the desired  output. The amount of difference is the absolute value of the error. That is, an error of −4  means that there is a difference of 4 between the desired and the predicted outputs and  that the desired output is lower than the predicted output because the error is negative.  Note that changing the positions of the predicted and desired outputs in Equation 2-2  will change the sign of the error. Let’s now return to our problem.  49   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  When a = 1.5, the results are better compared to a = 1.0, and that means increasing   the value of this parameter will reduce the error. Thus, we know the direction of change.  Let’s try using a = 2.0. The predicted output will beYpredicted = 2.0 2  = 4. The error in this  case will be equal to 4 − 6 =  − 2. The error reduced more than before.  Based on the previous results, we might deduce a relationship between the  parameter and the error. Using a = 1, the error is −4. Adding 0.5 to the parameter   a = 1.5 , the error got reduced by 1.0 to be −3. Adding another 0.5 to the parameter   a = 2.0 , the error got reduced by 1.0 to be −2. So, adding 0.5 to the parameter reduces  the error by 1.0. Thus, we could add 1.0 to the parameter to eliminate it completely, and  the parameter will be a = 3.0. The predicted output in this case is Ypredicted = 3.0 2  = 6. The  error will be 6 − 6 = 0. The error is now 0 and we reached the best results when a = 3.0.  Let’s make a change to the sample in Table 2-1 by changing the output of the    output to be 6.5 rather than 6 in addition to using a new sample. Based on Equation 2-3   with a = 3.0, the predicted output is Ypredicted =  3.0 2 = 6.0 for the first sample  and Ypredicted =  3.0 3 = 9.0 for the second one. Thus, there is a total error equal to   6.0 − 6.5  +  9.0 − 9.5  =  − 1.0  Table 2-2 . How can this type of error be reduced?  Table 2-2.  Regression Problem with Two Samples Input  X   Output  Y   2  3  6.5  9.5  The procedure we are following is to change the value of the parameter until   reducing the error to 0. Table 2-3 shows the total error for the two values of the  parameter. It seems that neither 3.0 nor a value greater than or equal to it eliminates the  error. The models corresponding to a = 2.5, a = 3.0, and a = 3.5 are shown in Figure 2-3  along with the desired outputs.  Table 2-3.  Regression Problem with Two Samples  Parameter  Output  Y   Predicted  Error  Total Error  6.5  9.5  6.5  9.5  7.0  10.5  5.0  7.5  7.0−6.5=1.0  10.5−9.5=1.0  5.0−6.5=−1.5  7.5−9.5=−2.5  2.0  −4.0  3.5  2.5  50   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-3.  Multiple parametric linear models. The dotted line corresponds to  model with a=2.5, starred line to a=3.5, and solid line to a=3.0.  The truth is that there is no value for the parameter that makes the error equal 0 for  our example. We want a value that when multiplied by 2 gives 6.5 and when multiplied  by 3 gives 9.5. It is impossible to find such a value. The value of the parameter that  satisfies the first sample is a = 3.25, while it is a = 3.17 for the second sample. Thus,  reaching an error of 0 is not possible on the current form of the model. For this reason,  the bias plays an important role in solving such situations.  We can add a bias b to Equation 2-3 as in Equation 2-4. This bias is able to fix our   problem.     Y = aX + b    Equation 2-4   But the problem’s complexity now increases. We are trying to find the values for two  parameters  a, b . Based on the previous results when a = 3.0, the predicted outputs for  the two samples are 6.0 and 9.0, respectively. The predicted outputs are less than the  correct outputs by 0.5. As a result, the value of b = 0.5 is what we are looking for. As a  result, a = 3.0 and b = 0.5 will give an error of 0. This is why the bias is important.  51   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Bias allows us to freely move the linear model on the y axis while increasing the   likelihood of fitting the data more than just moving it only on the x axis. Note that it is  very useful in our example because there are fewer parameters. When the model has  more parameters, bias might be omitted.  Extending the example in Table 2-2, there is a new input Z added to the problem and   the new data is in Table 2-4. Because there are two inputs and one output, the previous  model in Equation 2-4 will not work and we have to add the new input and its associated  parameter. Equation 2-5 represents the new model.  Table 2-4.  Regression Problem with Two Inputs  and One Output  Input  X   Input  Z   Output  Y   2  3  1.1  0.8  6.5  9.5     Y = aX + cZ + b    Equation 2-5   Now, we have to find the best values for the two parameters a and c in addition to the   bias b. The same procedure used before will be applied to this problem to find the best  values for these variables.  By creating simple linear models, we have successfully learned how the building   blocks of ANNs work. ANNs consist of multiple of such linear models that are connected  together in order to fit a problem. The following sections will explain how to design a  network by connecting linear models together. The next subsection discusses how to  draw an ANN for the previously created models.   Graphing ANNs ANNs are built by connecting multiple linear models together. As the number of  parameters required in each model increases, the complete equation of the network  becomes too complex. Thus, it is difficult to represent the problem as an equation, but  a more simple way is to visualize the network as a graph. The network graph is simpler  to understand and design. Here we are going to learn how to build the network graph,  starting with a linear model.  52   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  ANN is an artificial representation of biological neural networks. We can start by  saying that the basic building block in an ANN is the artificial neuron. Previously in  this chapter, we said also that the basic block of ANN is the linear model. Thus, we  can deduce that the neuron is actually a linear model. As in linear models, the neuron  accepts inputs, makes some types of processing such as multiplication and summation,  and finally returns an output. Figure 2-4 shows the mapping between the linear model in  Equation 2-4 and the artificial neuron. It is noted that all variables existing in the linear  model also exist in the ANN graph. This kind of ANN is called a single-layer perceptron.  Figure 2-4.  Mapping from a linear model with one input to ANN graph  We can start from the core of the graph, which is the circle with text “Math”. This  circle represents the neuron of the neural networks. The neuron is a computational  unit, and the type of computation it does is to multiply each input by its corresponding  parameter, sum all results, and then return the output that represents the sum of  products  SOP . For this reason, the input X is connected to that neuron.  Because each parameter must be associated with its input to calculate the SOP,   the parameter a for the input X is written above the arrow connecting it to the neuron.  Making each parameter near to its input helps in finding the parameter associated with   53   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  each input. This is for the inputs and their parameters. The idea might not be clear based  on the current example because there is just one input, but it will be clearer later. Let’s  move to the bias.  A new block is used after the neuron to add the bias b to the SOP. After adding b to  the SOP, the output Y is produced. Up to this point, everything works well, but we can  still make the graph simpler.  In our previous discussion, we treated the bias differently from the inputs. Each   parameter is multiplied by its input, but the bias does not have an input to get multiplied  by. We can assume that the bias has an input that is always equal to +1. This eases the  process too much, as we could eliminate the bias block added after the neuron as in  Figure 2-5. The neuron will multiply each parameter by its associated input and treat  the bias the same. It will be regarded as a parameter that has an input of +1. To make  the bias different from the regular parameters, it could be added vertically while other  parameters are added horizontally in the graph.  Figure 2-5.  Mapping from a linear model with one input to the ANN graph with  bias treated the same as regular parameters by associating it to an input of +1  54   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Based on the previous example, we know how to graph a linear equation from the  neural network perspective. Now, we can work with Equation 2-5, in which there are  two inputs. The only change is to add the new input Z and its associated parameter c to  the graph, similar to what we did with the input X and its parameter a. The new graph is  shown in Figure 2-6. The process repeats itself for each new input.  Figure 2-6.  Mapping from a linear model with two inputs to the ANN graph  In summary, a neuron in an ANN accepts a set of inputs, multiplies each of them  by their associated parameters, adds the results of multiplication together, and finally  returns the output. In ANNs, neurons are arranged into three types of layers: input,  hidden, and output. Such arrangement doesn’t exist in biological neural networks but  it helps us organize the network. Figure 2-7 shows the architecture of a general fully  connected  FC  ANN with such three layers. The network is organized according to the  three layers. The network only has a single input and output layer, but it could have  more than one hidden layer. Note that neurons within each layer are named according  to it. That is, a neuron within the input layer is said to be an input neuron, and a hidden  neuron is a neuron within a hidden layer.  55   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-7.  General FC artificial network architecture  For simplicity, all inputs are given the symbol X and all outputs are given the symbol   O with a subscript that defines the index of either the input or the output. The network  has n inputs, where X1 is the first input, X5 is the fifth input, and so on up to Xn. It also  has m inputs, where O1 is the first input, O5 is the fifth input, and so on up to Om.  The neurons in the hidden layers are given symbols with two indices to reflect its   layer index and also the location within its layer. For example, the first hidden layer has  k neurons, where  h1 hidden neuron in the second hidden layer, and so on up to  X p neuron in the rth hidden layer.  1  is the first hidden neuron in the first hidden layer,  h5  r , which is the pth hidden   2  is the fifth   Between every two layers, there are a number of parameters that are equal to the   multiplication of the number of neurons within the two layers. For example, if the  input layer has n neurons and the first hidden layer has k neurons, then the number of  1   parameters required for connecting them is equal to n × k, where the parameter Wnk refers to the parameter between the nth neuron in the input layer and the kth neuron  in the first hidden layer. This parameter could also be called weights, because each  parameter reflects the importance of its associated input. The larger the value of a  parameter, the more important its associated input will be.  Up to this point, a basic understanding of ANN is expected, but there is more to know  about it. The next sections cover some important concepts about ANN that are critical in  the successful building of ANN.  56   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks   Adjusting Learning Rate for Training ANN An obstacle for newbies to ANNs is the learning rate. I have been asked many times  about the effect of the learning rate on the training of ANNs. Why do we use learning  rate? What is the best value for the learning rate? In this section, I will try to make things  simpler using an example that shows how learning rate is useful in order to train an  ANN. Let’s start by explaining the used example.   Filter Example A very simple example is used to get us out of complexity to just focus on our goal, which  is the learning rate. The example is represented by Equation 2-6.       Y activation X  =    =  ,  250 X  ,  ì í î  X X  ³³ <<  250 250      Equation 2-6   If the input is 250 or smaller, then the output will be identical to the input. If the   input is larger than 250, then it will be clipped and the output will be 250. It works like  a filter that only passes inputs below 250 and cuts others to 250. Its graph is available in  Figure 2-8.  Figure 2-8.  The activation function of the filter example  57   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  The data with six samples is shown in Table 2-5.  Table 2-5.  Data to Train a Network to Filter Inputs to   See How Learning Rate Affects the Training Process  Input  X   Output  Y   60  40  400  300  -50  -10  60  40  250  250  -50  -10   ANN Architecture  The architecture of the ANN used is shown in Figure 2-9. There are just input and output  layers. The input layer has just a single neuron for our single input. The output layer has  just a single neuron for generating the output. The output layer neuron is responsible for  mapping the input to the correct output. There is also a bias applied to the output layer  neuron with value b and input +1. There is also a weight W for the input.  Figure 2-9.  ANN architecture used with the filter example  58   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks   Activation Function  Based on the previously discussed networks, we can only approximate linear functions,  as in Figure 2-1. But our problem uses a nonlinear function, as in Figure 2-8. How can  we use an ANN to represent this type of network? The solution in this example is to use a  function such as an activation function in ANN.  ANNs can approximate both linear and nonlinear functions. The way that ANN   incorporates nonlinearity in its calculations is via the activation functions. The location of the  activation function within the graph of an ANN is after the calculating of the SOP. The output  of the neuron in this case will be the activation function output, not just the SOP. This is why  the network output is set equal to the activation function output in Equation 2-6.   Python Implementation  The Python code implementing the entire network is given in Listing 2-1. After  discussing each of its parts and making it as easy as possible, we will focus on how  changing the learning rate affects the network training.  Listing 2-1.

Expected = ', new_outputs[i], ' ,   Predicted = ', activation_function new_weights[0]*1+new_ weights[1]*new_inputs[i]    Lines 17 and 18 are responsible for creating two arrays  inputs and desired_output    holding the training input and output data of our example. Line 16 creates an array of the  network parameters, which are the input parameter and the bias. They were randomly  initialized to 0.05 for the bias and 0.1 for the input. The activation function itself is  implemented using the activation_function inpt  method from line 3 to line 7. It accepts  a single argument, which is the input, and returns a single value, which is the predicted  output of the network.  60   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Because there may be an error in the prediction, we need to measure it to know how   far we are from the correct prediction. For that reason, there is a method implemented  in lines 9 and 10 called prediction_error desired, expected , which accepts two inputs:  the desired and predicted outputs. That method just calculates the absolute difference  between each desired and predicted output. The best value for any error is for sure 0.  This is the optimal value.  What if there is a prediction error? In this case, we must make a change to the network.   But what exactly to change? It is the network parameters that must be changed. For updating  the network parameters, there is a method called update_weights weights, predicted, idx   defined in lines 13 and 14. It accepts three inputs: old weights, predicted output, and the  index of the input that has a false prediction. Equation 2-7 is used to update the weights.  +  W n    =    W n    +  1  h éë    d n    -      Y n X n           ùû   Equation 2-7      Where      η – learning rate     d – desired output     Y – predicted output     X – input     W n – current weights     W n + 1 – updated weights  The equation uses the weights of the current step n to generate the weights of the  next step  n + 1 . This equation helps us understand how the learning rate affects the  learning process.  Finally, we need to concatenate all of these together to make the network learn. This   is done using the training_loop inpt, weights  method defined from line 20 to line 31.  It goes into a training loop. The loop is used to map the inputs to their outputs with the  least possible prediction error. The loop does three operations:    1.  Output Prediction.    2.  Error Calculation.    3.  Updating Weights.  Since we’ve gotten an idea about the example and its Python code, let us now see   how the learning rate is useful in order to get the best results.  61    artifiCial Neural Networks  Chapter 2   Learning Rate In the previously discussed example in Listing 2-1, line 13 has the weights update  equation, in which the learning rate is used. Let’s remove the learning rate from that  equation. It will be as follows:      weights = weights +  desired_output[idx] - predicted *inputs[idx]  Let’s see the effect of removing the learning rate. In the first iteration of the training   loop, the network has initial values for bias and weight of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively.  The input is 60 and the desired output is 60. The expected output of line 25, namely,  the result of the activation function, will be activation_function 0.05 +1 +0.1 60  .  The predicted output is be 6.05. In line 26, the prediction error is calculated by  getting the difference between the desired and the predicted output. The error is  abs 60 −  6.05 =53.95. Then in line 27, the weights will get updated according to the  preceding equation. The new weights are [0.05, 0.1] +  53.95 *60 = [0.05, 0.1] + 3237  = [3237.05, 3237.1]. It seems that the new weights are too different from the previous  weights. Each weight got increased by 3,237, which is too large. But let us continue  making the next prediction.  In the next iteration, the network will have this data  b=3237.05 and W=3237.1,   Input = 40, and desired output=40 . The expected output will be activation_function    3237.05 + 3237.1 40  = 250. The prediction error will be abs 40 − 250  = 210. The error  is very large. It is larger than the previous error, which was just 53.95. Thus, we have to  update the weights again. According to the preceding equation, the new weights will be  [3237.05, 3237.1] +  −210 *40 = [3237.05, 3237.1] + −8400 = [−5162.95,−5162.9]. Table 2-6  summarizes the results of the first three iterations.  Table 2-6.  Results of the First Three Iterations of Training the Filter Network  Update Value  New Weights  Prediction  6.05  250  Error  53.95  210  3237.0  −8400  −521452.95  521552.95  52155295.0  −2555356472.95  2555356422.95  −127767821147.0  [3237.05, 3237.1]  [–5162.95, –5162.9 ]  [52150132.04999999,  52150132.09999999]  [–1.27715671e+11, –1.27715671e+11]  62   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  As we go into more iterations, the results get worse. The magnitudes of the weights  are changing rapidly, sometimes even changing their signs. They are moving from very  large positive values to very large negative values. How can we stop these large and  abrupt changes in the weights? How to scale down the value by which the weights are  updated?  If we looked at the value by which the weights are changing from Table 2-6, it seems   that the value is very large. This means that the network changes its weights at high  speed. We just need to make it slower. If we are able to scale down this value, then  everything will be alright. But how? Getting back to the code, it looks like the update  equation is what generates such large values, specifically this part:   desired_output[idx] - predicted *inputs[idx]  We can scale this part by multiplying it by a small value such as 0.1. So, rather than   generating 3237.0 as the update value in the first iteration, it will be reduced to just 323.7.  We can even reduce this value to 0.001. Using 0.001, the update value is just 3.327.  We can catch it now. This value is the learning rate. Choosing small values for the   learning rate makes the rate of weights update smaller and avoids abrupt changes. As the  value gets larger, the changes become faster, and this creates bad results.  But what is the best value for the learning rate? There is no particular value that we can say is the best value for the learning rate.  The learning rate is a hyperparameter. A hyperparameter has its value determined by  experiments. We try different values and use the value that gives the best results.   Testing the Network For our problem, using a value of .00001 works fine. After training the network with  that learning rate, we can make a test. Table 2-7 shows the results of the prediction  of four new testing samples. It seems that results are now much better after using the  learning rate.  63   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Table 2-7.  Test Sample Prediction Results  Input  Desired Output  Predicted Output  10  240  550  10  240  250  –160  –160  10.87  239.13  250  –157.85  Now we are able to understand that learning rate determines the steps by which we   move. The larger the step, the more abrupt the changes. We might be near to the best  solution and just need to change our parameters a bit to reach it, but omitting or using a  bad value for the learning rate gets us away from the solution.   Weight Optimization Using Backpropagation In the previous section, we used the learning rate to update the weights of the ANN. In  this section, we will use the backpropagation algorithm to do that job and deduce  how it is better than just using the learning rate. Two examples are used to explain the  algorithm numerically.  This section won’t dive directly into the details of the backpropagation algorithm but  starts by training a very simple network. This is because the backpropagation algorithm  is meant to be applied over a network after training. As a result, we should train the  network before applying it to catch the benefits of the backpropagation algorithm and  how to use it. Readers should have a basic understanding of how ANNs work, partial  derivatives, and multivariate chain rule.   Backpropagation for NN Without Hidden Layer Starting with a simple example, Figure 2-10 shows its network structure, which we  will use to explain how the backpropagation algorithm works. It has just two inputs,  symbolized as X1 and X2. The output layer has just a single neuron, and there are no  hidden layers. Each input has a corresponding weight where W1 and W2 are the weights  for X1 and X2, respectively. There is a bias for the output layer neuron with a value of b  and a fixed input value of +1.  64   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-10.  Network structure to train and apply backpropagation  The output layer neuron uses the sigmoid activation function defined by Equation 2-8:      = f s     1 + - e s  1   Equation 2-8   Where s is the SOP between each input and its corresponding weight. s is the input to   the activation function, which in this example, is defined as in Equation 2-9.  s = X1 ∗ W1 + X2 ∗ W2 + b    Equation 2-9         Table 2-8 shows a single input and its corresponding desired output used   as the training data. The basic target of this example is not training the network  but understanding how the weights are updated using backpropagation. Now, to  concentrate on backpropagation, we will analyze a single record of data.  Table 2-8.  Training Data for the  First Backpropagation Example  X1  0.1  Desired Output  0.03  X2  0.3  W2  0.2  Assume the initial values for both weights and bias are as in Table 2-9.  Table 2-9.  Initial Parameters of the Network  W1  0.5  b  1.83  65   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  For simplicity, the values for all inputs, weights, and bias will be added to the   network diagram to look as in Figure 2-11.  Figure 2-11.  The network of the first backpropagation example with inputs and  parameters added  Now, let us train the network and see whether the desired output will be returned   based on the current weights and bias. The input of the activation function will be the SOP  between each input and its weight. Then, the bias will be added to the total as follows:  The output of the activation function will be calculated by applying the previously   calculated SOP to the used function  sigmoid  as follows:  s X W X W b  +  =  +  *  *  1  1  2  2  s =  0 1 0 5 0 3 0 2 1 83 .  .  .  .  .  +  +  *  *  s =1 94.      = f s  1 + - e s  1      = f s  1 + - e  1  1 94.  1  1  f s    =  1 0 143703949  .  +  f s    =  1 143703949 . f s    = 0 874352143  .  66   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  The output of the activation function reflects the predicted output for the current   inputs. It is obvious that there is a difference between the desired and the expected  output. But what are the sources for that difference? How should the predicted output be  changed to get closer to the desired result? These questions will be answered later. But at  least, let us see the error of our neural network based on an error function.  The error functions tell how close the predicted outputs are to the desired outputs.  The optimal value for the error is zero, meaning that there is no error at all and that the  desired and predicted results are identical. One of the error functions is the squared  error function, as in Equation 2-10. 1 2  desired predicted  2    E  -  =   Equation 2-10            Note that the    added to the equation is for simplifying derivatives later. We can   1 2  measure the error of our network as follows:  E =       0 03 0 874352143 2 .  -  .  1 2  1 2  E =  -     0 844352143 2 .  1 E =   2  0 712930542 .     E = 0 356465271  .  The result ensures the existence of a large error  ~0.357 . This is what the error tells.  It just gives us an indication of how far the predicted results are from the desired results.  Now that we know how to measure the error, we need to find a way to minimize it. The  only playable parameter we have is the weight. We can try different weights and then test  our network.   Weights Update Equation The weights can be changed according to Equation 2-7  used in the previous section  where     n: training step  0, 1, 2, … .     W n : weights in the current training step.  W n  = [b n , W1 n ,  W2 n , W3 n ,..., Wm n ]      η: network learning rate.  67   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks     d n : desired output.     Y n : predicted output.     X n : current input at which the network made the false prediction.  For our network, these parameters have the following values:      η: hyperparameter. We can choose 0.01, for example.     n: 0     W n : [1.83, 0.5, 0.2]     d n : [0.03].     Y n : [0.874352143].     X n : [+1, 0.1, 0.3]. First value  +1  is for the bias.  We can update our neural network weights based on the previous equation:    W n  ++     1  ==    W n     ++  hh éë    d n     --    Y n X n           ùû  [ = 1.83,0.5,0.2 +0.01 0.03 0.874352143 +1,0.1,0.3  ][  --  ]  [  ]  ==  [ 1 83 0 5 0 2 . .  .  ,  ,  ]  ++  [ 0.01  -- 0 844352143 .  ++ 1 0 1 0 3 . ,  .  ,  ==  [ 1 83 0 5 0 2 . .  .  ,  ,  ]  ++ --  0 00844352143 1 0 1 0 3 . .  ,  ,  .  ][  [  ++  ]  ]  ==  [ 1 83 0 5 0 2 . .  .  ,  ,  ]  [ ++ --  0 008443521 0 000844352 .  .  ,  ,  --  --  0 002533056 .  ]  [ == 1 821556479 0 499155648 0 197466943  .  ,  .  ,  .  ]  The new weights are given in Table 2-10.  Table 2-10.  Updated Weights for the Network  of the First Backpropagation Example  W1new  W2new  bnew  0.197466943  0.499155648  1.821556479  Based on the new weights, we will recalculate the predicted output and continue  updating weights and calculating the predicted output until reaching an acceptable  value for the error for the problem at hand.  68   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Here we successfully updated the weights without using the backpropagation   algorithm. Are we still in need of that algorithm? Yes. The reasons will be explained next.   Why Is the Backpropagation Algorithm Important? Suppose, for the optimal case, that the weight update equation generated the best  weights; it is still unclear what this function actually did. It is like a black box in that  we don’t understand its internal operations. All we know is that we should apply  this equation in case there is a classification error. Then the function will generate  new weights to be used in the next training steps. But why are new weights better  at prediction? What is the effect of each weight on the prediction error? How does  increasing or decreasing one or more weights affect the prediction error?  It is required to have a better understanding of how the best weights are calculated.  To do that, we should use the backpropagation algorithm. It helps us to understand how  each weight affects the NN total error and tells us how to minimize the error to a value  very close to zero.   Forward vs. Backward Passes When training a neural network, there are two passes, namely, forward and backward, as  in Figure 2-12. The first pass is always the forward pass, in which the inputs are applied  to the input layer and move toward the output layer, calculating the SOP between inputs  and weights, applying activation functions to generate outputs, and finally calculating  the prediction error to know how accurate the current network is.  Figure 2-12.  Forward and backward passes of training an ANN  69   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  But what if there is a prediction error? We should modify the network to reduce that   error. This is done in the backward pass. In the forward pass, we start from the inputs,  until calculating the prediction errors. But in the backward pass, we start from the errors  until reaching the inputs. The goal of this pass is to learn how each weight affects the  total error. Knowing the relationship between the weight and the error allows us to  modify network weights to decrease the error. For example, in the backward pass, we can  get useful information, such as that increasing the current value of W1 by 1.0 will increase  the prediction error by 0.07. This helps us understand how to select the new value of W1  in order to minimize the error  W1 should not be increased .   Partial Derivative  One important operation used in the backward pass is to calculate derivatives. Before  getting into the calculations of derivatives in the backward pass, we can start with a  simple example to make things easier.  For a multivariate function such as Y = X 2Z + H, what is the effect on the output Y   given a change in variable X? This question is answered using the partial derivative. It is  written as follows:  ¶¶ Y ¶¶ X  =  ¶¶ ¶¶ X     2  X Z H  +     ¶¶ Y ¶¶ X  =  2  XZ  +  0  ¶¶ Y ¶¶ X  = 2  XZ  Note that everything except X is regarded as a constant. This is why H is replaced by  0 after calculating the partial derivative. Here, ∂X means a tiny change of variable X and  ∂Y means a tiny change of Y. The change of Y is the result of changing X. By making a  very small change in X, what is the effect on Y? The small change can be an increase or  decrease by a tiny value such as 0.01. By substituting different values of X, we can find  how Y changes with respect to X.  The same procedure will be followed in order to learn how the NN prediction error  changes with respect to  wrt  changes in network weights. So, our target is to calculate  ¶ E ¶ W1  , as we have just two weights: W1 and W2. Let’s calculate them.  ¶ E ¶ W2   and   70   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Change in Prediction Error wrt Weights  Looking at this equation, Y = X 2Z + H, it seems straightforward to calculate the partial   derivate    because there is an equation relating both Y and X. But there is no direct   ¶ Y ¶ X  equation between the prediction error and the weights. This is why we are going to use  the multivariate chain rule to find the partial derivative of Y wrt X.  Prediction Error to Weights Chain  Let us try to find the chain relating the prediction error to the weights. The prediction  error is calculated based on Equation 2-10.  But this equation doesn’t have any weights. No problem: we can follow the   calculations for each input of the previous equation until we reach the weights. The  desired output is a constant, and thus there is no chance of reaching the weights through  it. The predicted output is calculated based on the sigmoid function, as in Equation 2-8.  Again, the equation for calculating the predicted output doesn’t have any weight.  But there is still variable s  SOP , which already depends on weights for its calculation  according to Equation 2-11.     s = X1 ∗ W1 + X2 ∗ W2 + b    Equation 2-11   Figure 2-13 presents the chain of calculations to be followed to reach the weights.  Figure 2-13.  Chain of calculations to reach the weights starting from the error of  prediction  71   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  As a result, to know how the prediction error changes wrt changes in the weights,   we should do some intermediate operations, including finding how the prediction error  changes wrt changes in the predicted output. Then, we need to find the relation between  the predicted output and the SOP. Finally, we will find how the SOP change by changing  the weights. There are four intermediate partial derivatives as follows:  ¶¶ E  ¶¶  Predicted  Predicted  ,  ¶¶  ¶¶ s  ,  ¶¶ s ¶¶ W1  , and   ¶¶ s ¶¶ W2  This chain will finally tell how the prediction error changes wrt changes in each  weight, which is our goal, by multiplying all individual partial derivatives as follows:  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W 1  =  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W 2  =  ¶¶ E  ¶¶  Predicted  ¶¶  Predicted  ¶¶ E  ¶¶  Predicted  ¶¶  Predicted  ¶¶ s  ¶¶ s  *  *  *  ¶¶ s ¶¶ W 1  *  ¶¶ s ¶¶ W 2  Important note  Currently, there is no equation directly relating prediction error  to network weights, but we can create one relating them and apply a partial  derivative directly to it. here it is in equation 2-12.

But what does that mean?  The results need interpretation.  75   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks   Interpreting Results of Backpropagation  There are two useful conclusions from each of the last two derivatives obtained from the  following:     Derivative sign     Derivative magnitude  DM   If the derivative is positive, that means increasing the weight will increase the error,  and likewise, decreasing the weight will decrease the error. If the derivative is negative,  then increasing the weight will decrease the error, and correspondingly, decreasing the  weight will increase the error.  But by how much will the error increase or decrease? The DM can tell us. For a   positive derivative, increasing the weight by p will increase the error by DM ∗ p. For a  negative derivative, increasing the weight by p will decrease the error by DM ∗ p.  Because the result of the    derivative is positive, this means that if W1 increased   ¶¶ E ¶¶ W1  by 1 then the total error will increase by 0.009276093. Also, because the result of the  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W2 increase by 0.027828278.   derivative is positive, this means that if W2 increases by 1 then the total error will    Updating Weights  After successfully calculating the derivatives of the error with respect to each individual  weight, we can update the weights in order to enhance the prediction. Each weight will  be updated based on its derivative as follows:  W  new1  =  W 1  - *hh  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W 1  =  0 5 .  -  0.01  *  0 009276093 .  W new1  = .  0 49990723907  76   For the second weight,  Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  W  new2  =  W 2  - *hh  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W 2  =  0 2 .  -  0.01  *  0 027828278 .  W new2  = .  0 1997217172  Note that the derivative is subtracted rather than added to the weight because it is   positive.  Then, continue the process of prediction and updating the weights until the desired   outputs are generated with an acceptable error.   Backpropagation for NN with Hidden Layer To make the ideas more clear, we can apply the backpropagation algorithm over the  following NN after adding one hidden layer with two neurons. The new network is  shown in Figure 2-14.  Figure 2-14.  The network architecture of the second backpropagation  example  77   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  The same inputs, output, activation function, and learning rate used previously will   also be applied in this example. Here are the complete weights of the network:  W1  0.5  W2  0.1  W3  0.62  W4  0.2  W5  −0.2  W6  0.3  b1  0.4  b2  −0.1  b3  1.83  Figure 2-15 shows the previous network with all inputs and weights added.  Figure 2-15.  The network architecture of the second backpropagation example  after adding the values of the inputs and the parameters  At first, we should go through the forward pass to get the predicted output. If there  was an error in prediction, then we should go through the backward pass to update the  weights according to the backpropagation algorithm. Let us calculate the inputs to the  first neuron in the hidden layer  h1 : =  X W X W b 1  h in1  +  +  *  *     2  2  1  1  =  0 1 0 5 0 3 0 1 0 4 . .  .  .  .  +  +  *  *     h in1  = .  0 48              78   The input to the second neuron in the hidden layer  h2 :  Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  h in2  =  X W X W b 2  4  2  3  1  +  +  *  *     =  0 1 0 62 0 3 0 2 0 1 . .  .  .  .  +  -  *  *     = 0 022  .     The output of the first neuron of the hidden layer:  And the output of the second neuron of the hidden layer:  h ou 1  =  1 + - e  1  h in 1     0 48     =  1  =  1 + - e . 1 .  1 0 619  +     1  =  1 619 .     h out 1  = .  0 618     h 2  out  =  1 + - e  1  h in 2     =  1 + - e .  1  0 022  =  1 0 978  +        1 .  1  =  1 978 .     h out 2  = .  0 506     The next step is to calculate the input of the output neuron:  out  in  =  h out 1  *  W h 2  +  5  out  *  W b  +  6  3    =  0 618 .  *-  0 2 0 506 0 3 1 83 .  .  .  .  +  +  *     outin =1 858  .     79                                                   Thus, the expected output of our NN based on the current weights is 0.865. We can   then calculate the prediction error according to the following equation:  Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  And the output of the output neuron:  out  out  =  1 + - e  1  outin     =  1 + - e .  1  1 858  =  1 0 156.  +        1  1  =  1 156 .     outout = 0 865  .

E = 0 349  .                                   80  The error seems very high, and thus we should update the network weights using the   backpropagation algorithm.   Partial Derivatives  Our goal is to get how the total error E changes wrt each of the six weights  W1 : W6 :  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W1  ,  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W2  ,  ¶¶ E ¶¶ W3  ,   ¶¶ E ¶¶ W4  ,   ¶¶ E ¶¶ W5  ,   ¶¶ E ¶¶ W6   Let us start by calculating the partial derivative of the output wrt the hidden-output   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  layers weights  W5 and W6 .

Did you ever wonder why this happens?  The reason might be due to overfitting. A model with the problem of overfitting  makes great predictions for training samples but poor ones for validation data. This is  because the model adapted itself to every piece of information in the training data until  collecting some properties that could be found only within the training data. Let’s try to  understand this problem.  The focus of ML is to train an algorithm with training data in order to create a   model that is able to make the correct predictions for unseen data  test data . To create  a classifier, for example, a human expert will start by collecting the data required to  train the ML algorithm. The human is responsible for finding the best types of features  which are the things capable of discriminating between the different classes in order to  represent each class. These features will be used to train the ML algorithm. Suppose we  are to build a ML model that classifies the images in Figure 2-16 as containing cats or not.  Figure 2-16.  Images of cats to train a model  The first question we have to answer is “what are the best features to use?” This  is a critical question in ML, as the better the features used, the better the predictions  the trained ML model makes, and vice versa. Let us try to visualize these images and  extract some features that are representative of cats. Some of the representative features  may be the existence of two dark eye pupils and two ears with a diagonal direction.  Let’s assume that we have extracted the features somehow from the preceding training  images and that a trained ML model has been created. This model can work with a wide  range of cat images because the features used exist in most cats. We can test the model  using some unseen data as in Figure 2-17. Assume that the classification accuracy of  the test data is x%.  89   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-17.  Test images of cats  One may want to increase the classification accuracy. The first thing to think  of is using more features than the two used previously. This is because the more  discriminative features used, the better the accuracy. By inspecting the training data  again, we can find more features, such as the overall image color, as all training cat  samples are white, and the iris color in the training data is yellow. The feature vector will  have these four features:    1.  Dark Eye Pupils    2.  Diagonal Ears    3.  White Fur    4.  Yellow Irises  They will be used to retrain the ML model. After creating the trained model, the next step is to test it. The expected result after  using the new feature vector is that the classification accuracy will decrease to be less  than x%. But why? The cause of the drop in accuracy is the use of some features that  already exist in the training data but not generally in all cat images. The features are not  general across all cat images. In the testing data, some cats have black or yellow fur, not  the white fur used in training.  Our case, in which the features used are powerful for the training samples but very  poor for the testing samples, can be described as overfitting. The model is trained with  some features that are exclusive to the training data but do not exist in the testing data. The goal of the previous discussion is to make the idea of overfitting simple by use   of a high-level example. To get into the details, it is preferable to work with a simpler  example. That is why the rest of the discussion will be based on a regression example.  90   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks   Understand Regularization Based on a Regression  Example Assume we want to create a regression model that fits the data shown in Figure 2-18. We  can use polynomial regression.  Figure 2-18.  Data to fit a regression model  The simplest model that we can start with is the linear model with a first-degree   polynomial equation, as in Equation 2-13.     y1 = f1 x  = Θ1x + Θ0      Equation 2-13   Where Θ0 and Θ1 are the model parameters and x is the only feature used. The plot of the previous model is shown in Figure 2-19.  Figure 2-19.  An initial model to fit the data using a model of the first degree  91   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Based on a loss function such as the one in Equation 2-14, we can conclude that the   model is not fitting the data well.  L  =  N  =åi    f x 0 1 N    -  d  i  i      Equation 2-14   Where fi xi  is the expected output for sample i and di is the desired output for the   same sample.  The model is too simple and there are many predictions that are not accurate. For  this reason, we should create a more complex model that can fit the data well, and we  can increase the degree of the equation from one to two, as in Equation 2-15.  y2 = f1 x  = Θ2x2 + Θ1x + Θ0      Equation 2-15   By using the same feature x after being raised to power 2  x2 , we created a new  feature and we will capture not only the linear properties of the data, but also some  nonlinear properties. The graph of the new model will be as in Figure 2-20.  Figure 2-20.  Using more features to create a model of the second degree  The graph shows that the second-degree polynomial fits the data better than the first   degree. But the quadratic equation also does not fit some of the data samples well. This  is why we can create a more complex model of the third degree with Equation 2-16. The  graph is in Figure 2-21.    y3 = f3 x  = Θ3x3 + Θ2x2 + Θ1x + Θ0   Equation 2-16            92   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-21.  Model of the third degree  It may be noted that the model fits the data better after a new feature that captures   the data properties of the third degree is added. To fit the data better than before, we can  increase the degree of the equation to be of the fourth degree, as in Equation 2-17. The  graph is in Figure 2-22.       y4 = f4 x  = Θ4x4 + Θ3x3 + Θ2x2 + Θ1x + Θ0   Equation 2-17   Figure 2-22.  Model of the fourth degree  It seems that the higher the degree of the polynomial equation, the better it fits  the data. But there are some important questions to be answered. If increasing the  degree of the polynomial equation by adding new features enhances the results, why  shouldn’t a very high degree, such as 100th degree, be used? What is the best degree to  use for a problem?  93    artifiCial Neural Networks  Chapter 2   Model Capacity Complexity The term “model capacity complexity” refers to the level of variation that the model can  work with. The higher the capacity, the more variation the model can cope with. The  first model y1 is said to be of a small capacity compared to y4. In our case, the capacity  increases by increasing the polynomial degree.  For sure, the higher the degree of the polynomial equation, the better fit it will be for  the data. But remember that increasing the polynomial degree increases the complexity  of the model. Using a model with a capacity higher than required may lead to overfitting.  The model becomes very complex and fits the training data very well but unfortunately  is very weak for unseen data. The goal of ML is creating a model that is robust not only  with the training data but also with unseen data samples.  The model of the fourth degree  y4  is very complex. Yes, it fits the seen data well   but it will not do so for unseen data. For this case, the newly used feature in y4, namely  x4, captures more details than required. Because that new feature makes the model too  complex, we should get rid of it.  In this example, we actually know which features to remove. So, we can remove them  and return back to the previous model of the third degree  Θ4x4 + Θ3x3 + Θ2x2 + Θ1x + Θ0 .  But in actual work, we do not know which features to remove. Moreover, assume that the  new feature is not too bad and we do not want to completely remove it and just want to  penalize it. What should we do?  Looking back at the loss function, the only goal is to minimize penalize the   prediction error. We can set a new objective to minimize penalize the effect of the new  feature x4 as much as possible. After modifying the loss function to penalize x3, the new  one is in Equation 2-18.  L  new  =  N  =åi    f x 0 4  i  é ë  d  i  +  4Q x  4  ù û       - N   Equation 2-18   Our objective now is to minimize the loss function. We are now just interested in   minimizing this term Θ4x4. It is obvious that to minimize Θ4x4 we should minimize Θ4, as it  is the only free parameter we can change. We can set its value to a value equal to zero if we  want to remove that feature completely in case it is a very bad one, as in Equation 2-19.  L  new  =  N  =åi    f x 0 4  i  é ë  d  i  + * 0  x  4  ù û       - N   Equation 2-19         94   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  By removing it, we go back to the third-degree polynomial equation  y3 . y3 does   not fit the seen data perfectly as in y4, but generally, it will give better performance for  unseen data than y4 would.  But in case x4 is a relatively good feature and we just want to penalize it rather than   removing it completely, we can set it to a value close to but not zero  say 0.1 , as in  Equation 2-20. By doing that, we limit the effect of x4. As a result, the new model will not  be as complex as before.  N  =åi    f x 0 4  i  é ë  d  i  +  0 1.  *  x  4  ù û     L  new  =   Equation 2-20   Going back to y2, it seems that it is simpler than y3. It can work well with both seen  and unseen data samples. So, we should remove the new feature used in y3, which is x3,  or just penalize it if it does relatively well. We can modify the loss function to do that, as  in Equation 2-21.  N  =åi    f x 0 4  i    -  d  é ë  +  0 1.  *  x  4  +  Q  3  x  3  ù û  L  new  =  L  new  =  N  =åi    f x 0 4  i    -  d  i  é ë  +  0 1 .  *  x  4  +  0 04 .  3  *  x   Equation 2-21      ù û                - N  i N  N   L1 Regularization Note that we actually knew that y2 is the best model to fit the data because the data  graph is available for us. It is a very simple task that we can solve manually. But if such  information is not available to us and as the number of samples and data complexity  increase, we will not be able to reach such conclusions easily. There must be something  automatic to tell us which degree will fit the data and tell us which features to penalize to  get the best predictions for unseen data. This is regularization.  Regularization helps us to select the model complexity to fit the data. It is useful   to automatically penalize features that make the model too complex. Remember  that regularization is useful if the features are not bad and will help us to get good  predictions in a relative sense; we just need to penalize but not remove them completely.  Regularization penalizes all used features, not a selected subset. Previously, we  penalized just two features, x4 and x3, not all features. But this is not the case with  regularization.  95   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Using regularization, a new term is added to the loss function to penalize the   features, so the loss function will be as in Equation 2-22. å    f x 0 4  å  N =  +  d  i  i  i  N lQ = 1  j  j  ù û     é ë  L  new  =   Equation 2-22   It can also be written as in Equation 2-23 after moving Λ outside the summation.  å  N =  i    f x 0 4  i  é ë  +  l  å  N Q = 1  j  j  ù û     L  new  =   Equation 2-23     - N  i  d    - N  å The newly added term  l Q  j  N  = 1  j   is used to penalize the features to control the level   of model complexity. Our previous goal before adding the regularization term is to  minimize the prediction error as much as possible. Now our goal is to minimize the error  but to be careful of making the model too complex and to avoid overfitting.  There is a regularization parameter called lambda  λ  that controls how to penalize   the features. It is a hyperparameter with no fixed value. Its value is variable based on  the task at hand. As its value increases, there will be higher penalization for the features.  As a result, the model becomes simpler. When its value decreases, there will be lower  penalization of the features and thus the model complexity increases. A value of zero  means no removal of features at all.  When λ is zero, then the values of Θj will not be penalized at all, as shown in the   next equation. This is because setting λ to zero means the removal of the regularization  term and just leaving the error term. So, our objective will return back to just minimize  the error to be close to zero. When error minimization is the objective, the model may  overfit.  å  N =  i    f x 0 4  i    -  é ë  + * 0  å  N Q = 1  j  j  ù û  L  new  =  d  i N  i N   f x 0 4 N  N  =åi    f x 0 4  é ë    -  d  i  +  0  ù û  L  new  =  N  =åi  L  new  =    -  d  i  i        96   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  But when the value of the penalization parameter λ is very high  say 109 , then there   must be a very high penalization for the parameters Θj in order to keep the loss at its  minimum value. As a result, the parameters Θj will be zeros. As a result, the model  y4   will have its Θi pruned as shown in the following.  y4  =   f x 4    =  Q  4  4  x  +  Q  3  x  3  +  Q  2  x  2  +  Q 1  x  +  Q  0  y4  = * 0  x  4  + * 0  x  3  + * 0  x  2  + * +  x Q  0  0  y4  0= Q  Please note that the regularization term starts its index j from 1 not zero. Actually,  we use the regularization term to penalize features  xi . Because Θ0 has no associated  feature, there is no reason to penalize it. In this case, the model will be y4 = Θ0 with the  graph shown in Figure 2-23.  Figure 2-23.  Model parallel to the x axis after penalizing all features   Designing ANN Beginners in ANNs are likely to ask some questions, including the following: What is the  correct number of hidden layers to use? How many hidden neurons are in each hidden  layer? What is the purpose of using hidden layers neurons? Does increasing the number  of hidden layers neurons always give better results? I am pleased to say that we can  answer these questions. To be clear, answering such questions might be too complex if  the problem being solved is complicated. By the end of this section, you might at least  get an idea of how these questions can be answered and be able to test yourself based on  simple examples. Let’s start.  97   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  ANN is inspired by the biological neural network. For simplicity, in computer   science, it is represented as a set of layers. These layers are categorized into three classes:  input, hidden, and output.  Knowing the number of input and output layers and the number of their neurons   is the easiest part. Every network has single input and output layers. The number  of neurons in the input layer equals the number of input variables in the data being  processed. The number of neurons in the output layer equals the number of outputs  associated with each input. But the challenge is knowing the number of hidden layers  and their neurons.  Here are some guidelines to learning the number of hidden layers and neurons in   each hidden layer in a classification problem:     Based on the data, draw an expected decision boundary to separate   the classes.     Express the decision boundary as a set of lines. Note that the   combination of these lines must yield to the decision boundary.     The number of selected lines represents the number of hidden   neurons in the first hidden layer.     To connect the lines created by the previous layer, a new hidden layer   is added. Note that a new hidden layer is added each time you need  to create connections among the lines in the previous hidden layer.     The number of hidden neurons in each new hidden layer equals the   number of connections to be made.  To make things clearer, let’s apply the previous guidelines to a couple of examples.   Example 1: ANN Without Hidden Layer Let’s start with a simple example of a classification problem with two classes, as shown  in Figure 2-24. Each sample has two inputs and one output that represents the class  label. It is quite similar to the XOR problem.  98   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-24.  Two-class classification problem  The first question to answer is whether hidden layers are required or not. A rule to   follow in order to determine this is as follows:  In ANNs, hidden layers are required if and only if the data must  be separated nonlinearly.  Looking at Figure 2-25, it seems that the classes must be nonlinearly separated. A  single line will not work. As a result, we must use hidden layers in order to get the best  decision boundary. In this case, we may still not use hidden layers, but this will affect the  classification accuracy. So, it is better to use hidden layers.  Knowing that we need hidden layers then requires us to answer two important   questions. These questions are as follows:    1.  What is the required number of hidden layers?    2.  What is the number of the hidden neurons across each hidden   layer?  Following the previous procedure, the first step is to draw a decision boundary that  splits the two classes. There is more than one possible decision boundary that splits the  data correctly, as shown in Figure 2-25. The one we will use for further discussion is in  Figure 2-25 a .  99   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  a  b  Figure 2-25.  Nonlinear classification problem cannot be solved using a single line  Following the guidelines, the next step is to express the decision boundary by a set of   lines.     The idea of representing the decision boundary using a set of lines comes from   the fact that any ANN is built using the single layer perceptron as a building block. The  single layer perceptron is a linear classifier that separates the classes using a line created  according to Equation 2-24.  y = w1x1 + w2x2 + … + wixi + b    Equation 2-24   Where xi is the ith input, wi is its weight, b is the bias, and y is the output. Because  each hidden neuron added will increase the number of weights, it is recommended  to use the lowest number of hidden neurons that accomplishes the task. Using more  hidden neurons than required will add more complexity.  Returning back to our example, saying that the ANN is built using multiple   perceptron networks is identical to saying that the network is built using multiple lines. In this example, the decision boundary is replaced by a set of lines. The lines start   from the points at which the boundary curve changes direction. At this point, two lines  are placed, each in a different direction.  Because there is just one point at which the boundary curve changes direction, as   shown in Figure 2-26 by a gray circle, then there will be just two lines required. In other  words, there are two single layer perceptron networks. Each perceptron produces a line.  100   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-26.  Two lines required to classify the problem  Knowing that there are just two lines required to represent the decision boundary   tells us that the first hidden layer will have two hidden neurons.  Up to this point, we have a single hidden layer with two hidden neurons. Each   hidden neuron could be regarded as a linear classifier that is represented as a line, as  in Figure 2-26. There will be two outputs, one from each classifier  i.e., hidden neuron .  But we are to build a single classifier with one output representing the class label, not  two classifiers. As a result, the outputs of the two hidden neurons are to be merged into a  single output. In other words, the two lines are to be connected by another neuron. The  result is shown in Figure 2-27.  Figure 2-27.  Two lines connected to each other using a hidden neuron  101   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Fortunately, we do not need to add another hidden layer with a single neuron to do  that job. The output layer neuron will do the task. This neuron will merge the two lines  generated previously so that there is only one output from the network.  After learning the number of hidden layers and their neurons, the network   architecture is now complete, as shown in Figure 2-28.  Input Layer  Hidden Layer  Output Layer out  Figure 2-28.  Network structure for a classification problem with a curve created  by connecting two lines, each one created using a hidden layer neuron   Example 2: ANN with a Single Hidden Layer Another classification example is shown in Figure 2-29. It is similar to the previous  example, in which there are two classes where each sample has two inputs and one  output. The difference is in the decision boundary. The boundary in this example is  more complex than the one in the previous example.  X1  X2  102   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-29.  A more complex classification problem to find the best network  architecture  According to the guidelines, the first step is to draw the decision boundary. The   decision boundary to be used in our discussion is shown in Figure 2-30 a .  The next step is to split the decision boundary into a set of lines; each line will be   modeled as a perceptron in the ANN. Before drawing lines, the points at which the  boundary change direction should be marked as shown in Figure 2-30 b .  a  b  Figure 2-30.  Decision boundary to classify the second example  103   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  The question is how many lines are required. Each of the top and bottom points   will have two lines associated with them, for a total of four lines. The in-between point  will have its two lines shared from the other points. The lines to be created are shown in  Figure 2-31.  Figure 2-31.  Lines required to create the decision boundary of the second example  Because the first hidden layer will have hidden layer neurons equal to the number   of lines, the first hidden layer will have four neurons. In other words, there are four  classifiers each created by a single layer perceptron. At the current time, the network  will generate four outputs, one from each classifier. The next step is to connect these  classifiers together in order to make the network generating just a single output. In other  words, the lines are to be connected together by other hidden layers to generate just a  single curve.  It is up to the model designer to choose the layout of the network. One feasible   network architecture is to build a second hidden layer with two hidden neurons. The first  hidden neuron will connect the first two lines, and the last hidden neuron will connect  the last two lines. The result of the second hidden layer is shown in Figure 2-32.  104   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  Figure 2-32.  Connecting lines to create a single decision boundary  Up to this point, there have been two separated curves. Thus, there are two outputs  from the network. The next step is to connect these curves together in order to have just  a single output from the entire network. In this case, the output layer neuron could be  used to do the final connection rather than adding a new hidden layer. The final result is  shown in Figure 2-33.  Figure 2-33.  Connecting the outputs of the hidden layer using the output layer  105   Chapter 2    artifiCial Neural Networks  The network design is now complete, and the complete network architecture is   shown in Figure 2-34.

The network architecture to classify the second example  X1  X2  106   CHAPTER 3  Recognition Using ANN  with Engineered Features  The three pillars for a successful ML application are the data, features, and model.  They should cope with each other. The most relevant features that differentiate among  the different cases existing in the data are used. Representative features are critical in  building an accurate ML application. They should be accurate enough to work well  under different conditions such as a change in scale and rotation. Such features should  work well with the selected ML model. You shouldn’t use more features than needed,  because this adds more complexity to the model. Feature selection and reduction  techniques are used to find the minimum set of features to build an accurate model.  This chapter explores the feature categories presented in Chapter 2 to find the   suitable set of hand-engineered features for the Fruits 360 dataset. Feature reduction is  applied to minimize the feature vector length and just use the most relevant features.  ANN is implemented to map the image features to their output labels. By the end of  the chapter, we will recognize how it is complex to manually find features for complex  problems with multiple variations among samples even within the same class.   Fruits 360 Dataset Feature Mining The Fruits 360 dataset is used to find a suitable set of features to train the ANN in order to  achieve high classification performance. It is a high-quality dataset of images collected  from 60 fruits including apple, guava, avocado, banana, cherry, date, kiwi, peach, and  more. On average, each fruit has around 491 training and 162 test images for a total  of 28,736 for training and 9,673 for testing. The size of each image is 100×100 pixels.  Working with a dataset in which all images are of equal size saves one preprocessing step  of resizing them.    Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7_3  107    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Chapter 3   Feature Mining For making things simple at the beginning, just four classes are selected: Braeburn  apple, Meyer lemon, mango, and raspberry. Based on the feature categories presented in  Chapter 2  color, texture, and edge , we need to find the most suitable set of features to  differentiate these classes.  Based on our knowledge about these four fruits, we know that they have different  colors. Apple is red, lemon is orange, mango is green, and raspberry is magenta. As a  result, the color category is the first one that comes to our minds.  We can start by using each pixel as input to the ANN. Each image size is 100×100   pixels. Because the image is color, then there are three existing channels based on the  RGB color space: red, green, and blue. Thus, the total number of inputs to the ANN is  100×100×3=30,000. Based on these inputs, an ANN is to be created.  Also, these inputs will make the ANN huge, with a large number of parameters.   The network will have 30,000 inputs and 4 outputs. Assuming there is a single hidden  layer of 10,000 neurons, then the total number of parameters in the network is  30,000×10,000+10,000×4, which is more than 300 million parameters. Optimizing such  a network is complex. We should find a way to reduce this number of input features in  order to reduce the number of parameters.  One way is by using a single channel rather than using all three RGB channels. The  selected channel should be able to capture the color changes among the used classes.  The three channels for each image in addition to their histograms are available in  Figure 3-1. A histogram helps us to visualize the intensity values easier than looking at  the image would.  108   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Figure 3-1.  Red, green, and blue channels in addition to their histograms for a  single sample from the four classes of the Fruits 360 dataset used  109   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  The Python code used to read the images, along with creating and visualizing their   histogram, is available in Listing 3-1.  Listing 3-1.  RGB Channel Histogram  import numpy import skimage.io import matplotlib.pyplot  raspberry = skimage.io.imread fname="raspberry.jpg", as_grey=False  apple = skimage.io.imread fname="apple.jpg", as_grey=False  mango = skimage.io.imread fname="mango.jpg", as_grey=False  lemon = skimage.io.imread fname="lemon.jpg", as_grey=False   fruits_data = [apple, raspberry, mango, lemon] fruits = ["apple", "raspberry", "mango", "lemon"] idx = 0 for fruit_data in fruits_data:     fruit = fruits[idx]     for ch_num in range 3 :         hist = numpy.histogram a=fruit_data[:, :, ch_num], bins=256          matplotlib.pyplot.bar left=numpy.arange 256 , height=hist[0]           matplotlib.pyplot.savefig fruit+"-histogram-channel-"+   str ch_num +".jpg", bbox_inches="tight"           matplotlib.pyplot.close "all"      idx = idx + 1  It seems that it is difficult to find the best channel to use. According to the histogram   for any channel, there is overlap in some regions across the images. The only metric  to differentiate the different images in such a case is the intensity values. For example,  Braeburn apple and Meyer lemon have values for all bins according to the blue channel  histogram, but their values differ. Apple has small values compared to lemon in the  rightmost part. According to illumination changes, the intensity values will change and  we might have a case in which both apple and lemon have close values to each other in  the histogram. We should add a margin between the different classes. Even with little  changes, there is no ambiguity in making the decision.  110   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  We can benefit from the fact that the four fruits used have different colors. A color   space that decouples illumination channels from color channels is a good option.  Figure 3-2 shows the hue channel from the HSV color space from the four samples used  previously in addition to their histograms.  Figure 3-2.  Hue channel from the HSV color space with its histograms  The Python code used to return the histogram of the hue channel of all samples is in   Listing 3-2.  Listing 3-2.  Hue Channel Histograms  import numpy import skimage.io, skimage.color import matplotlib.pyplot  raspberry = skimage.io.imread fname="raspberry.jpg", as_grey=False  apple = skimage.io.imread fname="apple.jpg", as_grey=False  mango = skimage.io.imread fname="mango.jpg", as_grey=False  lemon = skimage.io.imread fname="lemon.jpg", as_grey=False   apple_hsv = skimage.color.rgb2hsv rgb=apple  mango_hsv = skimage.color.rgb2hsv rgb=mango  raspberry_hsv = skimage.color.rgb2hsv rgb=raspberry  lemon_hsv = skimage.color.rgb2hsv rgb=lemon   111   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  fruits = ["apple", "raspberry", "mango", "lemon"] hsv_fruits_data = [apple_hsv, raspberry_hsv, mango_hsv, lemon_hsv] idx = 0 for hsv_fruit_data in hsv_fruits_data:     fruit = fruits[idx]     hist = numpy.histogram a=hsv_fruit_data[:, :, 0], bins=360      matplotlib.pyplot.bar left=numpy.arange 360 , height=hist[0]       matplotlib.pyplot.savefig fruit+"-hue-histogram.jpg", bbox_  inches="tight"       matplotlib.pyplot.close "all"      idx = idx + 1  Using a 360-bin histogram for the hue channel, it seems that each different type of  fruit votes specific bins within the histogram. There is little overlap among the different  classes compared to using any of the RGB channels. For example, the highest bins in the  apple histogram range from 0 to 10 compared to mango, whose bins range from 90 to  110. The margin between each of the classes makes it easier to reduce the ambiguity in  classification and thus increases the prediction accuracy.  Based on the previous simple experiments on the four classes selected, the hue   channel histogram can classify the data correctly. The umber of features, in this case,  is just 360 rather than 30,000. This helps very much to reduce the number of ANN  parameters.  A feature vector of 360 elements is small compared to the previous one, but we   can also minimize it. However, some elements in the feature vector might not be  representative enough to separate between the different classes. They might reduce the  accuracy of the classification model. Thus, it is better to remove them to keep the best set  of features.  This is not the end. If we are to add more classes, is the hue channel histogram   enough for accurate classification? Let’s see how things work after using an additional  two fruits  strawberry and mandarin .  Based on our knowledge about these two fruits, strawberry is red, which is similar to  apple, while mandarin is orange, which is similar to Meyer lemon. Figure 3-3 shows the  hue channel of the selected samples from these classes in addition to their histogram.  112   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Figure 3-3.  Samples from new two classes that share some similarities among the  previously used samples  The histograms of both strawberry and apple are similar as they share the same   bins ranging from 1 to 10. Also, both mandarin and lemon histograms are similar. How  to differentiate among the different classes that share the same color? The answer is to  search for another type of feature.  Fruits that are similar in color likely have different textures. Using a texture   descriptor such as GLCM or LBP, we can capture these differences. The previous process  is repeated until the best set of features that can increase the classification accuracy as  much as possible is selected.  LBP produces a matrix with a size equal to that of the input image. To avoid   increasing the feature vector length, a 10-bin histogram is created based on the LBP  matrix as in Figure 3-4. It seems that there is a difference in the bin values.  113   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Figure 3-4.  LBP histogram of apple and strawberry  Listing 3-3 lists the Python code that generates the LBP histogram.  Listing 3-3.  LBP Histogram  import numpy import skimage.io, skimage.color, skimage.feature import matplotlib.pyplot  apple = skimage.io.imread fname="apple.jpg", as_grey=True  strawberry = skimage.io.imread fname="strawberry.jpg", as_grey=True   fig, ax = matplotlib.pyplot.subplots nrows=1, ncols=2  apple_lbp = skimage.feature.local_binary_pattern image=apple, P=7, R=1  hist1 = numpy.histogram a=apple_lbp, bins=10  ax[0].bar left=numpy.arange 10 , height=hist1[0]   strawberry_lbp = skimage.feature.local_binary_pattern image=strawberry,  P=7, R=1  hist = numpy.histogram a=strawberry_lbp, bins=10  ax[1].bar left=numpy.arange 10 , height=hist[0]   The data scientist has to search for the best type of discriminating feature, which   is not easily accomplished when the complexity increases due to the number of  overlapping classes. Even with the simple high-quality Fruits 360 dataset, there is the  challenge of discriminating between different classes. Working with a dataset such   114   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  as ImageNet, with thousands of classes with a difference between samples within the  same class, finding the best features is a complex task to be done manually. Automatic  approaches are preferred for cases in which there is plenty of data.   Feature Reduction This subsection will work on the feature vector consisting of the hue channel  histogram based on the first four fruits. Looking at the histograms in Figure 3-2, it  is obvious that there are too many bins with almost zero value. This means they are  not used by any class. It is better to remove such elements, as this helps to reduce the  feature vector length.  According to the feature reduction techniques presented in Chapter 2, wrapper and  embedded categories are used when it is difficult to know what element to remove. For  example, some elements might be doing well with some classes but very badly with  others. Thus, we have to remove them. Wrapper and embedded approaches depend on a  model to train with multiple feature sets in order to know what elements help to increase  the classification accuracy. In our case, we do not have to use them. The reason is that  some elements are bad across all classes, and thus it is obvious what we should remove.  Thus, the filter approach is a good option.  In turn, STD is a good option for filtering elements. The good elements are those that  have high values for STD. A sigh STD value means that the element is discriminative for  the different classes. An element with a low STD value has almost identical values across  all different classes. This means it is unable to differentiate between the different classes.  STD is calculated for a given element according to Equation 3-1.      Equation 3-1   STD  =  ˆ X X n 1  - -     Where X is the element value for a given sample, X ̂ is the mean of the element across   all samples in the dataset, and n is the number of samples.  Before deciding which element to remove, we have to extract the feature vector from   all samples within the dataset. Listing 3-4 extracts the feature vector from each sample  across the four fruits used.  115   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Listing 3-4.

It is given a size of 1,962×360,   where 360 is the number of histogram bins and 1,962 refers to the number of samples   492 apple + 490 for the other three fruits . The class labels are saved into the “outputs”  array, where apple is given label 0, 1 for raspberry, 2 for mango, and 3 for lemon. At the  end of the code, the features and the output labels are saved in order to reuse them later.  116   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  This code assumes that there are four folders named according to each fruit. It loops   through these folders, reads all of their images, calculates the histogram, and returns it  into the “dataset_features” variable. After that, we are ready to calculate the STD. The  STD for all features is calculated according to this line:  features_STDs = numpy.std a=dataset_features, axis=0   This returns a vector of length 360, where an element in a given position refers to the  STD of the element of the feature vector at that position. The distribution of the 360 STDs  is in Figure 3-5.  Figure 3-5.  Distribution of the STDs for all elements of the feature vector across all  samples  Based on this distribution, the minimum, maximum, and mean values for the STD   are 0.53, 549.13, and 44.22, respectively. Features with small STD values should be  removed because they cannot differentiate between the different classes. We have to  select a threshold that splits the features into bad  below-threshold  and good  above-  threshold  ones.  117    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Chapter 3   Filtering Using ANN One way to select the threshold is trial and error. Try different values for the threshold.  By the reduced feature vector returned by each threshold, train a classification model  and notice the accuracy. Use the reduced feature vector that maximizes the accuracy. Listing 3-5 gives the Python code to create and train an ANN using the scikit- learn   library with a set of features generated by using a threshold.  Listing 3-5.

A multilayer perceptron classifier is created  with two hidden layers, where the first hidden layer has 150 neurons and the second one  has 60 neurons. Some properties of this classifier are specified: the activation function   118   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  is set to the rectified linear unit  ReLU  function, the stochastic gradient descent  GD  is  the learning algorithm, the learning rate is selected automatically by the learner, there  are 300 maximum iterations to train the network, and finally the network is set to True in  order to select different training samples in each iteration.  With a threshold of 50, the remaining features have the distribution in Figure 3-6. All  low-quality elements are removed and thus the best set of elements is used. This reduces  the amount of data used to train the network; thus, faster training. It also prevents bad  feature elements from reducing the accuracy. When using all the elements in the feature  vector, there are 490 false predictions. After thresholding, with the feature elements using  an STD threshold of 50, the number of false predictions dropped to zero.  Figure 3-6.  Distribution of STDs after removing elements with STD lower  than 50  Reduction of the classification errors is not the only benefit; the ANN parameters are   also reduced. After using only the feature elements with an STD of greater than 50, the  number of remaining elements is just 102. According to the ANN structure in Listing 3-5,  the number of parameters in the input layer and the first hidden layer will be 102×150=  15,300 compared to 54,000 parameters when the complete feature vector of length 360 is  used. There is a reduction of 38,700 parameters.  119   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres   ANN Implementation This section implements an ANN in Python. The ANN is made to accept the network  structure in terms of the number of neurons in each layer  input, hidden, and output ,  and then it trains the network in a number of iterations. For getting familiar with the  steps of implementation, Figure 3-7 visualizes the ANN structure. There is an input layer  with 102 inputs, two hidden layers with 150 and 60 neurons, and an output layer with 4  outputs  one for each fruit class .  Figure 3-7.  The architecture of the ANN to be implemented  The input vector at any layer is multiplied  matrix multiplication  by the weights   matrix connecting it to the next layer to produce an output vector. The output vector is  again multiplied by the weights matrix connecting its layer to the next layer. The process  continues until reaching the output layer. A summary of the matrix multiplications is in  Figure 3-8.  120   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Figure 3-8.  Matrix multiplications between inputs and weights  The input vector of size 1×102 is to be multiplied by the weights matrix of the first   hidden layer of size 102×150. This is matrix multiplication. Thus, the output size is 1×150.  The output is then used as the input to the second hidden layer, where it is multiplied by  a weights matrix of size 150×60. The result size is 1×60. Finally, the output is multiplied  by the weights between the second hidden layer and the output layer of size 60×4. The  result has a final size of 1×4. Every element in the resulting vector refers to an output  class. The input sample is labeled according to the class with the highest score.  The Python code for implementing such multiplications is in Listing 3-6.  121   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Listing 3-6.

They are randomly given values from –0.1 to 0.1. For example, the variable  “input_HL1_weights” holds the weights matrix between the input layer and the first  hidden layer. The size of this matrix is defined according to the number of feature  elements and the number of neurons in the hidden layer.  After creating the weights matrices, the next step is to apply matrix multiplications.   For example, the variable “H1_outputs” holds the output of multiplying the feature  vector of a given sample to the weights matrix between the input layer and the first  hidden layer.  Usually, an activation function is applied to the outputs of each hidden layer to   create a nonlinear relationship between the inputs and the outputs. For example,  outputs of the matrix multiplications are applied to the sigmoid activation function as in  Equation 3-2.       sigmoid x    =  1 + -  e x     1      Equation 3-2   After generating the output layer outputs, prediction takes place. The predicted class   label is saved into the “predicted_label” variable.  These steps are repeated for each input sample. The complete code that works across   all samples is in Listing 3-7.

Based on the size   of each weight matrix, the network structure is dynamically specified. For example, if  the size of the “input_HL1_weights” variable is 102×80, then we can deduce that the first  hidden layer has 80 neurons.  The “train_network” is the core function, as it trains the network by looping through   all samples. For each sample, the steps discussed in Listing 3-6 are applied. It accepts  the number of training iterations, features, output labels, weights, the learning rate, and  the activation function. There are two options for the activation functions: either ReLU  or sigmoid. ReLU is a thresholding function that returns the same input as long as it is  greater than zero. Otherwise, it returns zero.  If the network made a false prediction for a given sample, then weights are updated  using the “update_weights” function. No optimization algorithm is used to update the  weights; they are simply updated according to the learning rate. The accuracy does not  exceed 45%. The next chapter discusses using the GA optimization technique for this  task, which increases the classification accuracy.  After the specified number of training iterations, the network is tested according   to the training data to see if the network is working well on the training samples. If the  accuracy is acceptable based on the training data, then we can test the model based on  new unseen data.   Engineered Feature Limitations Fruits 360 dataset images are captured in a restricted environment with many details  available about each fruit. This makes mining the data for finding the best features much  easier. Unfortunately, real-world applications are not easy that way. There are many  variations among the samples within the same class, such as different viewing angles,  perspective distortion, illumination changes, occlusion, and more. Creating a feature  vector for such data is a complex task.  Figure 3-9 gives some samples from the MNIST  Modified National Institute of   Standards and Technology  dataset for handwritten number recognition. It consists of  70,000 samples. The images are binary and thus color feature category is not applicable.  Looking for another feature, it seems that there is no single feature able to work across  the entire dataset. Thus, we have to use multiple features to cover all variations existing  in the dataset. This will definitely create a huge feature vector.  126   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Figure 3-9.  Samples from the CIFAR10  Canadian Institute for Advanced  Research  dataset  Assuming that we are able to find a good feature, there is also another problem. A   single-layer ANN resulted in a 12.0% error rate. Thus, we could increase the depth of the  ANN. Unfortunately, large feature vectors used with deep ANN architectures are very  tiresome to compute, but this is the way to work with complex problems.  The alternative approach is to avoid manual feature mining approaches. Start   looking for an automatic feature mining that searches for the best set of features in terms  of maximizing accuracy.   Not the End of Engineered Features Engineered features are not legacy and can still do great with some problems. It is not a  good option when working with some complex datasets.  Every data scientist would have used a calculator for doing mathematical   calculations. After the invention and evolution of the mobile phone, smartphones with  different applications for operations previously done on the calculator came out. Here  is the question: does the appearance of a new technology  smartphones  mean that the  previous technology  calculator  gets destroyed and will not be used anymore?  127   Chapter 3    reCognition Using ann with engineered FeatUres  Calculators were dedicated just to mathematical operations, but smartphones are   not. Smartphones have many features not existing in the calculator. Is the availability of  many features rather than limited ones a disadvantage? In some cases, the fewer features  in the tool, the better its performance; also, the more features, the more overhead. It is  simple to do an operation using a calculator but there is overhead when doing the same  operation with a smartphone.  The phone might ring for an incoming call, which breaks into whatever you were   doing. It might be connected to the Internet and thus may also beep for an e-mail. This  might take you away from doing the operations. As a result, one using a smartphone  should care about all such effects in order to do the math operations nicely. Using  calculators with limited features compared to smartphones has the advantage of being  simple and focused on the task, even if it is an old technology. Indeed, the newest is not  always the best. According to your needs, the old technology may be better or worse than  a newer technology. The same holds from a data science perspective.  There are different types of learning algorithms and features to be used for different   tasks, such as classification and regression. Some of them may go back to 1950 while  others are recent. But we can’t say that the old models are always worse than the recent  ones. We can’t absolutely conclude that DL models such as CNN are better than previous  models. This depends on your needs.  Many researchers tend to use DL blindly just because it is the state-of-the-art  method. Some problems are simple, and using DL may add more complexity. For  example, using DL with just 100 images divided across 10 classes is not a good option.  Shallow learning is sufficient in this case. If a classifier is to be created to discriminate  among the four types of fruits used previously, DL is not mandatory and previous  handcrafted engineered features are sufficient.  If CNN is to be used in this case, some overhead is added that makes the task   complex. There are different parameters to be specified, such as the types of layers, the  number of layers, activation function, learning rate, and others. In comparison, using a  hue channel histogram is sufficient for achieving a very high accuracy. It is like getting  to the top of a wall using a ladder. If you reached the top of the wall after climbing five  stairs, you do not need to go up another stair in the ladder. Similarly, if you can get the  best results using hand-engineered features, you do not have to use automatic feature  learning.  128   CHAPTER 4  ANN Optimization  Before the innovation of automatic feature learning approaches, a data scientist was  asked to know what features to use, which model to use, how to optimize the result,  and more. With the existence of huge amounts of data and high-speed devices, DL  is available to automatically deduce the best features. Two of the core tasks of a data  scientist are model design and optimization.  Model optimization is as important as building the model itself if not more. The  previously created DL models that proved their accuracy could be reused and thus  model design is solved. The remaining task is optimization. We are in the era of  optimization, in which operation research  OR  scientists play a critical role. The field of  optimization is closely related to artificial intelligence.  Selection of the optimal parameters for ML tasks is challenging. Some results may  be bad not because the data is noisy or the used learning algorithm is weak, but due to  the bad selection of the parameter values. Ideally, optimization guarantees returning  the best solution by looking at different solutions and selecting the best. The more  metrics defining the solution goodness, the harder it is to find the best solution. This  chapter gives an introduction to optimization and discusses a simple optimization  technique called GA. Based on the examples given, it will become clear how to use it in  both single- and multiobjective optimization problems  MOOPs  based on the concept  of dominance. This algorithm is used with ANN to produce better weights, helping to  increase the classification accuracy.    Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7_4  129   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON   Introduction to Optimization Suppose that a data scientist has an image dataset divided into a number of classes and  an image classifier is to be created. After the data scientist investigated the dataset, the  K-nearest neighbor  KNN  seems to be a good option. To use the KNN algorithm, there  is an important parameter to use, which is K, referring to the number of neighbors.  Suppose that an initial value of 3 is selected.  The scientist starts the learning process of the KNN algorithm with the selected  K=3. The trained model reached a classification accuracy of 85%. Is that percentage  acceptable? In another way, can we get a better classification accuracy than what  we currently reached? We cannot say that 85% is the best possible accuracy before  conducting different experiments. But to do another experiment, we definitely must  change something in the experiment, such as changing the K value used in the KNN  algorithm. We cannot definitely say 3 is the best value to use in this experiment  unless we try different values for K and notice how the classification accuracy varies.  The question is how to find the best value for K that maximizes the classification  performance. This is called hyperparameter optimization.  In optimization, we start with some kind of initial values for the variables used in   the experiment. Because these values may not be the best ones, we have to change  them until getting the best ones. In some cases, these values are generated by  complex functions that we cannot solve manually easily. But it is very important to  do optimization because a classifier may produce a bad classification accuracy. The  reason might not be that the data is noisy or the used learning algorithm is weak, but  that the selection of the parameters is bad. As a result, there are different optimization  techniques suggested by OR researchers to do such work.   Single- vs. Multiobjective Optimization One way to categorize optimization problems is based on whether it is a single- or  multiobjective problem. Let’s differentiate between them in this subsection.  Assume there is a book publisher that would like to maximize its profit from selling  books. They are using Equation 4-1 to calculate their profit per day, where X represents  the number of books and Y represents the profit. The question to ask yourself when  optimizing something is what to change in order to make the results better.  Y =  −  X − 2 3 + 3    Equation 4-1      130   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  We could backtrack to the preceding problem. In order to optimize the preceding   problem, we want to reach the best values for the output variables. Here, we have just a  single output variable, which is Y.  To get the best value for the output variable Y, what could we change in the problem  in order to change the variable Y? In other words, what are the variables that Y depends  on? Looking at Equation 4-1, there is only a single variable that Y depends on, which is  the input variable X. By changing X we could change Y to a better value. As a result, the  previous question could be adapted to this specific problem to be as follows: what is the  best value for the input variable X that returns the best value for the output variable Y? Assume that the range of the input variable X is 1 to 3, inclusive. Which value gives   the highest profit? If there is no information to direct us toward the best solution,  we have to try all possible solutions  i.e., all possible values of the input variable X   and select the one that maximizes the profit  i.e., the solution corresponding to the  largest value for the output variable Y . Table 4-1 shows all possible X values and their  corresponding Y values. Based on it, the best solution is Y=4, which corresponds to X=1.  Table 4-1.  All Possible Solutions to  a Single-Variable Problem  X  1  2  3  Y  4  3  2  Let us make the problem a bit complex. Assume that the problem has another   factor to use in profit calculation, which is the number of visitors to its online site. It  is represented as the variable Z, with a range of values from 1 to 2. The modification  is in Equation 4-2. Following the previous procedure, we need to try all possible  combinations of the inputs X and Z as in Table 4-2. The best solution corresponds to X=2  and Z=2.     Y = Z3 −  X − 2 3 + 3    Equation 4-2   131   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Table 4-2.  All Possible Solutions  to the Problem with Two Input  Variables  X  1  1  2  2  3  3  Z  1  2  1  2  1  2  Y  5  6  4  11  3  10  Sometimes the range of the input variable is unbounded and we cannot try all of its   values. For example, the range of the inputs X and Z might be all real numbers. Following  the previous procedure of trying all possible values, we will fail in that case. There must  be something to guide us toward the best solution without trying all possible values for  the inputs.  The previous optimization problem has only one objective, which is maximizing   the profit. Another objective might be minimizing the wastepaper represented by  Equation 4-3, where W represents the amount of wastepaper, with a range from 2 to 4  tons. As a result, the problem becomes a MOOP, as shown in Equation 4-4.     K =  X − 2 2 + 1    Equation 4-3   Max Y Min K  ü ý þ  Where  Subject to  Y = Z 3 −  X − 2 2 + 3 K =  X − 2 2 + 1  1 ≤ X ≤ 3    &    1 ≤ Z ≤ 2   Equation 4-4   132   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Our goal is not only maximizing the profit but also minimizing the amounts of   wastepaper. This makes the problem more complex, because we have to keep in mind  that the selected value for X should meet two objectives rather than one, especially  when the two objectives are conflicting. This is because a value reducing the amounts of  wastepaper might decrease the profit. There must be a trade-off between the objectives,  as one solution might be better in one objective while worse in another. Note that for  simplicity, maximization objectives are translated into minimization ones.  As the number of objectives and variables increases, the complexity also increases,   and the problem becomes difficult to solve manually. That is why we are in need of  automatic optimization techniques to solve such problems for us.  This chapter discusses the GA, which is a simple technique for solving single- and   multiobjective optimization problems. Nondominated sorting GA-II  NSGA-II  is a  multiobjective EA  MOEA  based on GA that finds feasible solutions satisfying multiple  objectives. Because MOOPs might have multiple solutions, NSGA-II could return the  possible feasible solutions for all objectives. Based on user preference, the best single  solution could then be filtered.  Looking at various natural species, we can note how they evolve and adapt to their   environments. We can benefit from these already existing natural systems and their  natural evolution to create our artificial systems doing the same job. This is called  bionics. For example, the plane is based on how birds fly, radar comes from bats, the  submarine was invented based on fish, and so on. As a result, the principles of some  optimization algorithms come from nature. For example, GA has its core idea from  Charles Darwin’s theory of natural evolution: “survival of the fittest.”  We can say that optimization is performed using EAs. The difference between   traditional algorithms and EAs is that EAs are not static but dynamic, as they can evolve  over time.  EAs have three main characteristics:    1.  Population-Based: EAs are to optimize a process in which current  solutions are bad to generate new and better solutions. The set of  current solutions from which new solutions are to be generated is  called the population.    2.  Fitness-Oriented: If there are several solutions, how can we say  that one solution is better than another? There is a fitness value  associated with each individual solution calculated from a fitness  function. Such a fitness value reflects how good the solution is.  133   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON    3.  Variation-Driven: If there is no acceptable solution in the current  population according to the fitness function calculated from each  individual, we should make something to generate new better  solutions. As a result, individual solutions will undergo a number  of variations to generate new solutions.  We will now start discussing GA to apply these concepts.   GA GA is a randomly based optimization technique. By “random,” it is meant that in order  to find a solution using GA, random changes are applied to the current solutions to  generate new ones. GA is based on Darwin’s theory of evolution. It is a slow, gradual  process that works by making slight changes to its solutions until better ones are found.  By evolving the solutions across a number of generations, it is expected that the new  solutions will be better than the old ones.  GA works on a population consisting of multiple solutions. The population size is the   number of solutions. Each solution is called individual. Each individual is represented  as a chromosome. The chromosome is represented as a set of genes that defines the  features or parameters of the individual. There are different ways to represent the  genes, such as binary or decimal. Figure 4-1 gives an example of a population with four  individuals  chromosomes  where each chromosome has four genes and each gene is  represented as a binary digit.  Figure 4-1.  Population, chromosome, and gene for the GA  134   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  After building the population of the first generation  generation 0 , next is to select   the best solutions for mating and producing new better solutions. To select the best  solutions, a fitness function is used. The result of the fitness function is the fitness value  representing the quality of the solution. The higher the fitness value, the higher the  quality of the solution. Solutions with the highest fitness values are selected within the  mating pool. Such solutions will mate to produce new solutions.  Solutions inside the mating pool are called parents. Parents mate together for   generating offspring  children . Just by mating high-quality individuals, it is expected to  get offspring of better quality than its parents. This stops bad individuals from generating  more bad individuals. Keeping selecting and mating high-quality individuals, there  is a higher chance to enhance the quality of the solutions by just keeping the good  properties and removing the bad ones. Finally, this will end up with the desired optimal  or acceptable solution.  When the parents are simply mated, the offspring have only the characteristics of the   parents; no new property is added. Assuming that all parents suffer from a limitation,  mating them together will definitely produce offspring with the same limitation.  To overcome this problem, some changes are applied to each offspring to create  new individuals with new properties. The new offspring will be the solutions in the  population of the next generation.  Because changes applied to the offspring are random, we are not sure that the new   offspring will be better than the parents. There is a chance that the solutions within  the current generation are worse than those of their parents. For this reason, the new  population will consist of both the parents and the offspring. Half of it is the parents  and the other half is the new offspring. If the population size is eight, then the new  population will consist of the previous four parents and four offspring. In the worst case,  when all offspring are worse than the parents, the quality will not decrease, as we have  kept the parents. Figure 4-1 summarizes the steps of GA.  There are two questions to be answered to get the full idea about GA:    1.  How are the two offspring generated from the two parents?    2.  How does each offspring get slightly changed?  We will answer these questions later. There are different representations available for the chromosome, and the selection   of the proper representation is problem specific. A good representation is one that makes  the search space smaller and thus easier to search.  135   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  The representations available for the chromosome include the following:     Binary: Each chromosome is represented as a string of zeros and   ones.  salesman problem.     Permutation: Useful for ordering problems such as the traveling      Value: The actual value is encoded as it is.  For example, if we are to encode the number 5 in binary, it might look like the first   chromosome in Figure 4-2.  Figure 4-2.  GA steps  Each part of the preceding chromosome is called a gene. Each gene has two   properties. The first one is its value  allele  and the second one is the location  locus   within the chromosome. The rightmost location of each chromosome in Figure 4-1  represents location 0 and the leftmost location represents location 3.  136   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Each chromosome has two representations:    1.  Genotype: The set of genes representing the chromosome.    2.  Phenotype: The actual physical representation of the   chromosome.  The binary number 01012 is the genotype and 510 is the phenotype representation.   Binary representation might not be the best way to represent solutions for a given  problem, especially when the number of bits to represent the genes is not fixed.  After representing each chromosome the right way, next is to calculate the fitness   value of each individual.   Best-Parents Selection Assume that Equation 4-5 is the fitness function used in our example in Figure 4-1,  where x is the chromosome decimal value.  f   x  = 2x − 2    Equation 4-5   The fitness value of the first solution is with decimal value 5 and is calculated as follows:      =     - =   f 5 2 8  2 5        The process of calculating the fitness value of a chromosome is called evaluation.   The fitness values of all solutions are given in Table 4-3.  Table 4-3.  Fitness Value of Each Solution  Solution Number Decimal Value  Fitness Value  1  2  3  4  5  11  12  2  8  20  22  2  The best individuals from the current population are selected in the mating pool.  After that step, we will end up selecting a subset of the population in the mating pool.  But what is the number of parents to choose? It depends on the problem being solved.   137   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  In our example, we can select just two parents. These two parents will mate to produce  two offspring. The combination of the parents and the offspring will create a new  population of four parents. According to Table 4-3, the best two solutions are solutions  with numbers 2 and 3.   Variation Operators The two parents selected are applied to variation operators to produce the offspring. The  operators are crossover and mutation.   Crossover  Using the crossover operation, genes from both parents are selected to create the new  child. As a result, the child will carry properties from both parents. The amount of genes  carried by each parent is not fixed. Sometimes the offspring takes half of its genes from  one parent and the other half from the other parent, and sometimes these percentages  change.  For every two parents, crossover takes place by selecting a random point in the   chromosome and exchanging genes before and after this point from the two parents.  The resulting chromosomes are offspring. Because we used a single point to split the  chromosome, this operator is called single-point crossover. There are different types of  operators, such as blend, two points, and uniform. Figure 4-3 shows how crossover is  applied between the two parents to produce the two offspring.  Figure 4-3.  Single-point crossover between two parents to produce two offspring  138   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON   Mutation  Based on the crossover operation, there is no new property added to the gene other  than ones existing in the parents. This is because all genes are taken from the parents.  Mutation is applied by selecting a percentage of genes from each chromosome  and changing their values randomly. Mutation varies based on the chromosome  representation. If binary encoding is used  i.e., the value spaces of each gene are just 0  and 1 , then flip the bit value of each gene participating in the mutation operation. Other  types of mutation include swap, inverse, uniform, nonuniform, Gaussian, and shrink.  The percentage of genes to which mutation is applied should be small because   changes are random. We shouldn’t take the risk of losing much of the existing  information due to random changes that do not guarantee better results. For our  problem, we can just select one gene for random flipping of its value. Figure 4-4 shows  the result when the leftmost gene at location 0 is selected for mutation. Note that  mutation is applied over the crossover result.  Figure 4-4.  Bit-flip mutation over the crossover result  By applying crossover and mutation, the new offspring are completely prepared.   We can measure whether they are better or worse than the parents based on the fitness  value. The fitness values for the two offspring are 16 for the first offspring and 26 for the  second one. Compared to the fitness values of the parents  20 and 22 , one of the second  offspring is better than all parents, and GA is able to evolve the solutions to produce a  better one. But the first offspring with fitness value 16 is worse than all parents. Keeping  the parents selected within the new populations ensures that such a bad solution will   139   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  not be selected as a parent in the next generation. Thus, we are sure that the quality  of solutions in the next generations will not be worse than the quality in the previous  generations.  In some problems, the gene is not represented in binary, and thus mutation differs.  If the gene value comes from a space of more than two values such as  1, 2, 3, 4, 5 , then  the bit-flip mutation is not applicable. One way is by randomly selecting a value from  this set. Figure 4-5 gives an example of a solution represented by limited values for its  genes  more than two values . The gene selected for mutation has its value changed to  one of the other values randomly.  Figure 4-5.  Uniform mutation for a solution with more than two values for its  genes  Sometimes the solution is represented by an unlimited set of values. For example,  if the range of values is between –1.0 and 1.0, we can select any value in that range to  replace the old value.   Python Implementation of an Example Now that we’ve looked at the concepts of GA, let’s implement it in Python in order  to optimize a simple example, in which we are going to maximize the output of  Equation 4-6. This is the fitness function. Decimal representation, one-point  crossover, and uniform mutation are used in the implementation.    Y = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + w4x4 + w5x5 + w6x6   Equation 4-6   The equation has six inputs  x1 to x6  and six weights  w _ 1 to w6  as shown, and   input values are  x1,x2,x3,x4,x5,x6 = 4,–2,7,5,11,1 . We are looking to find the parameters   weights  that maximize this equation. The idea of maximizing this equation seems  simple. The positive input is to be multiplied by the largest possible positive number and  the negative number is to be multiplied by the smallest possible negative number. But      140   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  the idea we are looking to implement is how to make GA do that on its own. GA should  know itself that it is better to use positive weights with positive inputs and negative  weights with negative inputs. Let’s start implementing GA.  According to Listing 4-1, a list is created that holds the six inputs in addition to a   variable that holds the number of weights.  Listing 4-1.  Inputs of the Function to Optimize   Inputs of the equation. equation_inputs = [4,-2,3.5,5,-11,-4.7]  Number of the weights we are looking to optimize. num_weights = 6  The next step is to define the initial population. Based on the number of weights,   each chromosome  solution or individual  in the population will definitely have six  genes, one gene for each weight. But the question is, how many solutions are there per  population? There is no fixed value for that, and we can select the value that fits well  with our problem. But we could leave it generic so that it can be changed in the code.  In Listing 4-2, a variable is created to hold the number of solutions per population,  another to hold the size of the population, and finally, a variable to hold the actual initial  population.  Listing 4-2.  Creating the Initial Population  import numpy sol_per_pop = 8  Defining the population size. pop_size =  sol_per_pop,num_weights   The population will have sol_per_pop  chromosome where each chromosome has num_weights genes. Creating the initial population. new_population = numpy.random.uniform low=-4.0, high=4.0, size=pop_size   After importing the numpy library, we are able to create the initial population  randomly using the numpy.random.uniform function. According to the selected  parameters, its shape is  8, 6 . That is, there are eight chromosomes and each one has  six genes, one for each weight. Table 4-4 presents the solutions of the population after  running the previous code. Note that it is generated randomly by the code and thus it  will definitely change when you run it.  141   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Table 4-4.  Initial Population  Solution 1  Solution 2  Solution 3  Solution 4  Solution 5  Solution 6  Solution 7  Solution 8  W1  –2.19  2.13  1.81  –0.64  –1.49  1.14  1.97  3.01  W2  –2.89  2.97  0.35  –2.86  –1.54  2.88  0.51  –2.75  W3  2.02  3.6  1.03  2.93  1.12  1.75  0.53  3.27  W4  –3.97  3.79  –0.33  –1.4  –3.68  –3.46  –1.57  –0.72  W5  3.45  0.29  3.53  –1.2  1.33  0.96  –2.36  0.75  W6  2.06  3.52  2.54  0.31  2.86  2.99  2.3  0.01  After preparing the population, next is to follow the steps of GA as in Figure 4-2.  Based on the fitness function, we are going to select the best individuals within the  current population as parents for mating. Next is to apply the GA variants  crossover and  mutation  to produce the offspring of the next generation, creating the new population  by appending both parents and offspring, and repeating these steps for a number of  iterations generations. Listing 4-3 applies these steps.  Listing 4-3.  Iterating Through GA Steps  import GA num_generations = 10,000 num_parents_mating = 4 for generation in range num_generations :      Measuring the fitness of each chromosome in the population.     fitness = GA.cal_pop_fitness equation_inputs, new_population        Selecting the best parents in the population for mating.     parents = GA.select_mating_pool new_population, fitness,                                       num_parents_mating        Generating next generation using crossover.     offspring_crossover = GA.crossover parents,                                         offspring_size= pop_size[0]-parents.  shape[0], num_weights    142   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON       Adding some variations to the offspring using mutation.     offspring_mutation = GA.mutation offspring_crossover        Creating the new population based on the parents and offspring.     new_population[0:parents.shape[0], :] = parents     new_population[parents.shape[0]:, :] = offspring_mutation  A module named “GA” holds the implementation of the functions used in   Listing 4-3. The first function called, GA.cal_pop_fitness, finds the fitness value of  each solution within the population. This function is defined inside the GA module  according to Listing 4-4.  Listing 4-4.  GA Fitness Function  def cal_pop_fitness equation_inputs, pop :       Calculating the fitness value of each solution in the current         The fitness function calculates the SOP between each input and its   population.  corresponding weight.      fitness = numpy.sum pop*equation_inputs, axis=1      return fitness  The fitness function accepts the equation input values  x_1 to x_6  in addition to   the population. The fitness value is calculated as the SOP between each input and  its corresponding gene  weight  according to Equation 4-6. Based on the number of  solutions per population, there will be an equal number of SOPs as in Table 4-5. Note  that the higher the fitness value, the better the solution.  Table 4-5.  Fitness Values of the Initial Population Solutions  Solution1 Solution2 Solution3 Solution4 Solution5 Solution6 Solution7 Solution8  Fitness 63.41  14.40  –42.23  18.24  –45.44  –37.0  16.0  17.07  After calculating the fitness values for all solutions, the next step is to select the best of  them as parents in the mating pool according to the GA.select_mating_pool function. This  function accepts the population, fitness values, and the number of parents needed, and it  returns the parents selected. Its implementation inside the GA module is in Listing 4-5.  143   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Listing 4-5.  Selecting the Best Parents According to Fitness Values  def select_mating_pool pop, fitness, num_parents :  Selecting the best individuals in the current generation as parents for  producing the offspring of the next generation.     parents = numpy.empty  num_parents, pop.shape[1]       for parent_num in range num_parents :         max_fitness_idx = numpy.where fitness == numpy.max fitness           max_fitness_idx = max_fitness_idx[0][0]         parents[parent_num, :] = pop[max_fitness_idx, :]         fitness[max_fitness_idx] = -99999999999     return parents  Based on the number of parents required as defined in the variable num_parents_  mating, the “parents” empty array is created to hold them. Inside the loop, the function  iterates through the solutions in the current population to get the index of the solution  with highest fitness value because it is the best solution to be selected. The index  is stored into the “max_fitness_idx” variable. Based on this index, the solution that  corresponds to it is returned to the “parents” array. To avoid selecting this solution again,  its fitness value is set to –99999999999, which is a very small value. This value makes the  solution unlikely to be selected again. After selecting the number of parents needed,  the parents array is returned as in Table 4-6. Note that these three parents are the best  individuals within the current population based on their fitness values, which are 63.41,  18.24, 17.07, and 16.0, respectively.  Table 4-6.  Selected Parents from the First Population  W1  –0.64  3.01  1.97  2.13  W2  –2.86  –2.75  0.51  2.97  W3  2.93  3.27  0.53  3.6  W4  –1.4  –0.72  –1.57  3.79  W5  –1.2  0.75  –2.36  0.29  W6  0.31  0.01  2.3  3.52  parent 1  parent 2  parent 3  parent 4  144   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  The next step is to use the selected parents for mating in order to generate the   offspring. The mating starts with the crossover operation according to the GA.crossover  function. This function accepts the parents and the offspring size. It uses the offspring  size to learn the number of offspring to produce from the parents. This function is  implemented according to Listing 4-6 inside the GA module.  Listing 4-6.  Crossover  def crossover parents, offspring_size :     offspring = numpy.empty offspring_size        The point at which crossover takes place between two parents.   Usually, it is at the center.      crossover_point = numpy.uint8 offspring_size[1] 2       for k in range offspring_size[0] :          Index of the first parent to mate.         parent1_idx = k%parents.shape[0]          Index of the second parent to mate.         parent2_idx =  k+1 %parents.shape[0]           The new offspring will have its first half of its genes taken            offspring[k, 0:crossover_point] = parents[parent1_idx, 0:crossover_            The new offspring will have its second half of its genes taken            offspring[k, crossover_point:] = parents[parent2_idx, crossover_  from the first parent.  point]  from the second parent.  point:]      return offspring  Because we are using single-point crossover, we need to specify the point at which  crossover takes place. The point is selected to divide the solution into two equal halves.  Then we need to select the two parents to cross over. The indices of these parents are  stored into parent1_idx and parent2_idx. The parents are selected in a way similar to a  ring. Indices 0 and 1 are selected at first to produce two offspring. If there still remaining  offspring to produce, then we select parents 1 and 2 to produce the other two offspring.  If we are in need of more offspring, then we select the next two parents with indices 2  and 3. By index 3, we reach the last parent. If we need to produce more offspring, then   145   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  we select the parent with index 3 and go back to the parent with index 0, and so on. The  offspring after applying crossover are stored into the offspring variable. Table 4-7 shows  the contents of this variable.  Table 4-7.  Offspring After Crossover  Offspring 1  Offspring 2  Offspring 3  Offspring 4  W1  –0.64  3.01  1.97  2.13  W2  –2.86  –2.75  0.51  2.97  W3  2.93  3.27  0.53  3.6  W4  –0.72  –1.57  3.79  –1.4  W5  0.75  –2.36  0.29  –1.2  W6  0.01  2.3  3.52  0.31  Next is to apply the second GA variant, mutation, to the results of the crossover using   the mutation function inside the GA module implemented in Listing 4-7. This function  accepts the crossover offspring and returns them after applying uniform mutation.  Listing 4-7.  Mutation  def mutation offspring_crossover :  Mutation changes a single gene in each offspring randomly.     for idx in range offspring_crossover.shape[0] :          The random value to be added to the gene.         random_value = numpy.random.uniform -1.0, 1.0, 1           offspring_crossover[idx, 4] = offspring_crossover[idx, 4] + random_  value      return offspring_crossover  It loops through each offspring and adds a uniformly generated random number,  say in the range from –1.0 to 1.0. This random number is then added to the gene with  one randomly chosen index  e.g., index 4  of the offspring. Note that the index could be  changed to any other index. Results are stored into the variable “offspring_crossover”  and get returned by the function as in Table 4-8. At this point, we have successfully  produced four offspring from the four selected parents and are ready to create the new  population of the next generation.  146   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Table 4-8.  The Results of Mutation  Offspring 1  Offspring 2  Offspring 3  Offspring 4  W1  –0.64  3.01  1.97  2.13  W2  –2.86  –2.75  0.51  2.97  W3  2.93  3.27  0.53  3.6  W4  –0.72  –1.57  3.79  –1.4  W5  1.66  –1.95  0.45  –1.58  W6  0.01  2.3  3.52  0.31  Note that GA is a randomly based optimization technique. It tries to enhance the  current solutions by applying some random changes to them. Because these changes  are random, we are not sure that they will produce better solutions. For this reason, it  is preferred to keep the previous best solutions  parents  in the new population. In the  worst case, when all the new offspring are worse than the parents, we will continue using  these parents. As a result, we guarantee that the new generation will at least preserve  the previous good results and will not get worse. The new population will have its first  four solutions from the previous parents. The last four solutions come from the offspring  created after applying crossover and mutation.  Table 4-9 presents the fitness of all solutions  parents and offspring  of the first   generation. The highest fitness previously was 18.24112489 but now it is 31.7328971158.  That means that the random changes moved toward a better solution. This is great. But  these results could be enhanced by going through more generations. After going through  10,000 iterations, the result reached a value of more than 40,000 as in Figure 4-6.  Table 4-9.

In GA, a single value is  used for selecting the best individuals. This is the fitness value generated from a fitness  function. The higher the fitness value is, the better the solution individual. For NSGA-II,  there is no single value but multiple values generated from multiple objective functions.  How do we make the selection based on these multiple values, keeping in mind that all  of these objectives have equal importance? There must be a different way than the one  used in regular GA for selecting the best individuals. NSGA-II selects its parents or best  individuals based on two metrics:    1.  Dominance.    2.  Crowding Distance.  151   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  The example we will use in the discussion is about a person that would like to buy a   shirt. That person has two objectives that are to be satisfied in the shirt:    1.  Low cost  between $0 and $85 .    2.  Bad feedback from previous buyers  between 0 and 5 .  Cost is measured in USD and feedback is measured as a real number between 0 and  5 inclusive, where 0 is the best feedback and 5 is the worst feedback. This means that the  two objective functions are minimization. Assume that there are just eight samples of  data as in Table 4-10; we will use them to start.  Table 4-10.  Data Samples  ID  Cost $  Bad Feedback  a  B  C  D  e  F  G  h  20  60  65  15  55  50  80  25  2.2  4.4  3.5  4.4  4.5  1.8  4.0  4.6   NSGA-II Steps NSGA-II follows the general steps in the traditional GA. The change is not using a  fitness value to select the best solutions  parents  for the next generation; rather, it uses  dominance and crowding distance. Here are the general stops of NSGA-II:    1.  Select the initial population solutions of generation 0 from the data.    2.  Split the solutions into levels using nondominant sorting.    3.  Select the best solutions at the level 1 nondominated front  as parents for mating and producing offspring for the next  generation.  If all solutions inside the last-used level are selected  completely without remainders, then go directly to step 5.   152   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON    4.   If a subset of solutions is selected as parents from the last- used level, then you have to calculate the crowding distance  for solutions in this level, sort these solutions in worse order  according to the crowding distance, and select the number of  remaining solutions from the top.    5.  Use the selected parents to produce the offspring.    a.  Tournament selection on the selected parents.    b.  GA variants  i.e., crossover and mutation  on the results of the   tournament. This will produce the new offspring of the next  generation.    6.  Repeat steps 2 to 5 until reaching a maximum number of   iterations.  Note that you shouldn’t expect to understand all of these steps at the current time.   But don’t worry: when you go through the details of each step, things will become easier  and clearer. These steps are summarized in Figure 4-7.  Figure 4-7.  NSGA-II steps  153   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  NSGA is not different from GA but adds some operations to make it suitable   for multiobjective problems. Figure 4-8 highlights the difference between GA and  NSGA. The step of calculating the fitness values in GA is extended to multiple steps in  NSGA starting from nondominated sorting until tournament selection. After determining  what solutions will be used in the mating pool, the two algorithms are similar.  Figure 4-8.  GA vs. NSGA  The first step generally in the GA is to select the solutions individuals of the initial   population. Assume that the size of the population is eight, meaning there are eight  samples to be used in the population. This means that all samples in Table 4-10 will  be used inside the initial population. The next step is to select the best solutions in  this population as parents for generating the offspring of the next generation using the  concept of dominance.   Dominance Dominance in NSGA-II helps us to select the best set of solutions as parents. These  solutions are said to dominate the other solutions. That is, they are better than all other  solutions.  154   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Realistically, the solutions are not always bad or worse than other solutions across all  objectives. How do we find the best set of solutions in the data? Here is the rule to use in  order to say that one solution dominates another solution: Solution X is said to dominate solution Y if and only if    1.  Solution X is no worse than solution Y in all objective functions     2.  Solution X is better than solution Y in at least one objective   and  function.  Besides saying solution X dominates solution Y, we could say the following:     Solution X is nondominated by solution Y.     Solution Y is dominated by solution X.     Solution Y nondominates solution X.  Note that if any of the preceding conditions are not met, then solution X does not   dominate solution Y. That means no solution is better than another, and there is a trade-  off between them. Note also that when solution X dominates solution Y, it means that  solution X is better than solution Y.  The set of all solutions not satisfying at least one of the preceding two conditions is   called the nondominant set. It is called so because no solution in that set dominates  i.e.,  is better than  another. The steps to find the nondominated set are as follows:    1.  Select a solution with index i, where i starts from 1 corresponding     2.  Check the dominance of that solution against all other solutions   to the first solution.  in the data.    3.     4.   If a solution is found to dominate that solution, then stop, as it is  impossible to be in the nondominant set. Go to step 5 directly.  If no solution dominates that solution, then add it to the  nondominant set.    5.   Increment i by 1 and repeat steps 2 to 4.  155   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Using nondominated sorting, the solutions are split into multiple sets. Each   set is called a nondominated front. These fronts are sorted in levels, where the first  nondominated front is at level 1, the second nondominated front is at level 2, and so on.  Let us apply these steps in order to find the nondominant front at level 1 based on our  example in Table 4-10.    1.  Starting with solution A and comparing it to solution B, we find   that A is better than B in the first objective  cost , as A’s cost is $20,  which is less  i.e., better  than B’s cost of $60. Also, A is better than  B in the second objective  feedback , as A’s feedback is 2.2, which  is less  i.e., better  than B’s feedback of 4.4. As a result, A is better  than B across all objectives. The conditions that make solution A  dominate solution B are met. But we cannot conclude that A is a  member of the nondominant set, and we still have to wait until  checking A against all other solutions.    2.  Comparing A to C, it is clear that A is better than C in all   objectives, as A’s cost and feedback are smaller than C’s. As a  result, C does not dominate A  i.e., A dominates C . We still have  to explore the next solutions to decide whether A is a member of  the nondominant set or not.    3.  Comparing A to D, we find A’s feedback of 2.2 is better than D’s  feedback of 4.4. But A’s cost of $20 is worse than D’s cost of $15.  Thus, each solution is better than the other in just one objective.  As a result, the two conditions of dominance are not met for  solution D. As a result, we can conclude that D does not dominate  A and also that A does not dominate D. We again have to check A  against the remaining solutions to learn its decision.    4.  Comparing A and E, it is obvious that A is better than E in all  objectives. Thus, A dominates E. Let’s compare A to the next  solution, F.    5.  Comparing A and F, neither solution is better than the other.   This is identical to the case of comparing A to D. Thus, F does not  dominate A and we have to compare A to the other solutions.  156   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON    6.  Comparing A to G, A is better than G in all objectives, as A’s cost    $20  is less than G’s cost  $80 , and also A’s feedback  2.2  is better  than G’s feedback  4.0 . Let’s move to the final solution.    7.  Comparing A to H, A is better than H across all solutions. As a   result, H does not dominate A. After checking the dominance of  A across all solutions, it seems that no solution dominates A. So,  A is regarded as a member of the nondominant set. The current  nondominant set is P={A}. Let us move to the next solution.    8.  Regarding solutions B and C, it is clear that solution A dominates  them. As a result, we can go directly into checking dominance for  solution D.    9.  Comparing D by A, we find that D is better than D in the first   objective  cost  because D’s cost is $15, which is smaller than A’s  cost, which is $20. Regarding the second objective, D is worse  than A because D’s feedback of 4.4 is larger than A’s feedback of  2.2. Because solution A does not dominate solution D, we have to  compare D to the next solution.    10.  Comparing D to B, we find that D is better than B in the first   objective and they are equal in the second objective. As a result,  B does not dominate D and we have to check D against the  remaining solutions to learn its decision.    11.  Comparing D to C, D is better than C in the first objective but D  is worse than C in the second objective. Conditions that make C  dominate D are not met. As a result, C does not dominate D and  we have to check D against the next solution.    12.  Comparing D to E, we find that D is better than E across   all objectives. We can conclude that E does not dominate  D. Continue comparing D to the next solution.    13.  Comparing D to F, D’s cost of $15 is smaller  better  than F’s cost   of $50. Because solution F is worse than D in at least one objective,  we can stop and conclude that F does not dominate D. Let us  compare D to the next solution.  157   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON    14.  Comparing D to G, the same scenario with F repeats itself. D’s cost   of 15$ is smaller  better  than G’s cost of 80$. Because solution G  is worse than D in at least one objective, we can conclude that G  does not dominate D. Let us compare D to the next solution.    15.  Comparing D to H, H is worse than D across all objectives and   thus H does not dominate D. At this point, we can conclude  that no solution dominates solution D and it is included in the  nondominant set. The current nondominant set is P={A, D}. Let us  move to the next solution.    16.  Working with E, comparing it to A we find that A is better than E   across all objectives because A’s cost of $20 is smaller than E’s cost  of $55, and also A’s feedback of 2.2 is better than E’s feedback of  4.5. Thus, we can stop and conclude that A dominates E; E cannot  be included in the nondominant set.    17.  Working with F, comparing it to A we find that A is better than  F in just the first objective and F is better than A in the second  objective. Thus, no solution dominates the other. We still need to  compare F with the remaining solutions to make the decision.    18.  After comparing F with all solutions, there is no solution   dominating solution F. Thus, F is included in the nondominant  set. The current nondominant set is P={A, D, F}. Let us move to the  next solution.    19.  Working with G and comparing it to all solutions, we find that  solutions A, C, and F dominate it. Thus, G cannot be included  within the nondominant set. Let us move to the final solution.    20.  Working with the final solution H, by comparing it to all solutions   we find that solutions A and D dominate it. Thus, H cannot be  included within the nondominant set. At this point, we have  checked the dominance of all solutions.  After comparing each pair of solutions together, the final nondominant set is    P={A, D, F}. This is the level 1 nondominated front. No solution in the same front is better  than any other solution within the same front across all objectives. This is why it is called  the nondominant set as no solution dominates another.  158   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  The Python code for checking dominance of a given solution is in Listing 4-10.   Given an index of a solution, it returns the IDs of solutions dominating it. It uses pandas  DataFrame  DF  for sorting the objective values for each solution in addition to their  IDs. This helps to refer back to the solution ID. A simple way to create this DF is to insert  the data into a Python dictionary and then convert it into a pandas DF.  Listing 4-10.  Returning Dominating Solutions  import numpy import pandas  d = {'A': [20, 2.2],      'B': [60, 4.4],      'C': [65, 3.5],      'D': [15, 4.4],      'E': [55, 4.5],      'F': [50, 1.8],      'G': [80, 4.0],      'H': [25, 4.6]}  df = pandas.DataFrame data=d .T data_labels = list df.index   data_array = numpy.array df .T   ****Specify the index of the solution here**** sol_idx = 1 sol = data_array[:, sol_idx]  obj1_not_worse = numpy.where sol[0] >= data_array[0, :] [0] obj2_not_worse = numpy.where sol[1] >= data_array[1, :] [0] not_worse_candidates = set.intersection set obj1_not_worse ,   set obj2_not_worse    obj1_better = numpy.where sol[0] > data_array[0, :] [0] obj2_better = numpy.where sol[1] > data_array[1, :] [0] better_candidates = set.union set obj1_better , set obj2_better    dominating_solutions = list set.intersection not_worse_candidates,                                              better_candidates    159   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  if len dominating_solutions  == 0:     print "No solution dominates solution", data_labels[sol_idx], "."  else:      print "Labels of one or more solutions dominating this solution : ",   end=""       for k in dominating_solutions:         print data_labels[k], end=","   For a given solution, the conditions of dominance are checked. For the first condition,   the indices of solutions not worse than the current solutions across all objectives are  returned in the “not_worse_candidates” variable. The second condition searches for  solutions that are better than the current solution in at least one objective. Solutions  satisfying the second condition are returned in the “better_candidates” solutions. For a  given solution to dominate another, both conditions must be met. For this reason, the  “dominating_solutions” variable just returns solutions meeting both conditions.  The previous three solutions are better than all five remaining solutions. In other  words, solutions at the level 1 nondominated front are better than any solution on all  remaining fronts. What about the other five solutions that are not selected in the first  nondominated front at level 1? We will continue using the remaining samples from the  population to further find the next nondominance levels.  The steps to find the nondominant set will be repeated to find the nondominated   front at level 2 but after removing the three solutions selected previously in level 1  of the population. The set of remaining solutions is {B, C, E, G, H}. Let’s find the next  nondominated front:    1.  Starting with solution B and checking its dominance to C, B’s   feedback of 4.4 is worse than C’s feedback of 3.5. According to the  first objective, B’s cost of $60 is better than C’s cost of $65. As a  result, solution C nondominates solution B. We still have to wait  until we compare B to the remaining solutions.    2.  Comparing B to E, B is better than E in the second objective, as  B’s feedback is 4.4 and E’s feedback is 4.5. As a result, solution E  nondominates solution B. Let us check the next solution.    3.  Comparing B to G, we find that B is better than G in the first   objective, as B’s cost is $60 and G’s cost is $80. As a result, solution  G nondominates solution B. Let us check the next solution.  160   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON    4.  Comparing B to H, we find that B is better than H in the second   objective, as B’s feedback is 4.4 and H’s feedback is 4.6. As a  result, solution H nondominates solution B. After comparing B  to all solutions and finding that no solution dominates it, we can  conclude that B is included in the nondominated front at level 2.  The level 2 set is now P’={B}. Let us move to check the dominance  of the second solution in the remaining set of solutions.    5.  Comparing the next solution C to B, C is better than B in the   second objective, as C’s feedback is 3.5 and B’s feedback is 4.4. As  a result, solution B nondominates solution C.    6.  Comparing C with the remaining solutions, there is no solution   dominating C and it will be included in the nondominated front at  level 2, which will be P’={B, C}. Let us move to the next solution.    7.  Comparing the next solution E to all the remaining solutions   from the population, we find that no solution dominates solution  E. Thus, E will be included in the nondominated front at level 2,  which is P’={B, C, E}. Let us move to the next solution.    8.  Comparing the next solution G to all the remaining solutions   from the population, we find that solution C dominates solution  G because C is better than G across all objectives. As a result,  solution G is not included in the level 2 nondominated front. Let  us move to the next solution.    9.  Comparing the last solution H to all the remaining solutions from  the population, we find that no solution dominates solution H. As  a result, it will be included in the nondominated front at level 2,  which will be P’={B, C, E, H}.  This is the end of the nondominated front at level 2. The set of remaining solutions  is {G}. This set will be used to find the level 3 nondominated front. Because there is just  one remaining solution, it will be added alone into the nondominated front at level 3 to  be P“={G}. At this point, we successfully split the data into three nondominance levels, as  shown in Table 4-11.  161   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Table 4-11.  Results of Splitting the Data  into Three Nondominance Levels  Level  1  2  3  Solutions  {a, D, F}  {B, C, e, h}  {G}  Note that the solutions in level i are better than the solutions in level i + 1. That is,  the solutions in level 1 are better than the solutions in level 2, the level 2 solutions are  better than the level 3 solutions, and so on. As a result, when selecting the best solutions  for being parents, we will start selection from the first level. If the number of available  solutions in the first level is less than the number of required parents, then we select the  remaining parents from the second level, and so on.  In our problem, the population size is eight. For producing a new generation of the  same size, we need to select half of its population as parents; the remaining half is the  offspring produced by mating the parents. At first, we need to select the best four parents.  The first nondominance level has just three solutions. Because we are in need of four   parents, then we will select all of these three solutions. As a result, the current parents  are {A, D, F}. There is a remaining parent that we should select from level 2.  Level 2 has four solutions, and we need to select just one. The important question  is, which solution should we select from level 2? The metric used to evaluate solutions  inside the same nondominated front is the crowding distance. Next, we will learn how to  calculate the crowding distance to solutions inside the level 2 front.   Crowding Distance Crowding distance is the metric used to prioritize solutions within the same  nondominated front. Here are the steps for calculating and using the crowding distance:    1.  For each objective function, sort the set of solutions within the   level in worse order.    2.  For the two solutions at outliers  i.e., rightmost and leftmost   solutions , set their crowding distance to infinity.    3.  For the in-between solutions, the crowding distance is calculated   according to Equation 4-7.  162   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON    4.  For each solution, take the summation of the crowding distances   across all objectives.    5.  Sort solutions in descending order to select the solutions from   highest to lowest crowding distance.      Equation 4-7   n d m  =  1  + n S m max O m  - -  - n 1 S min   m O m  After sorting the solutions according to one objective function, n refers to its   position. m refers to the number of the objective function being used for calculating the  n  is the crowding distance of solution n according to objective m,  crowding distance.  dm max  is the maximum value for  n  refers to the value of the objective m for solution n, Om Sm objective m, and Om  min  is the minimum value for objective m.  For a minimization objective, sorting solutions in worse order refers to sorting in   descending order in which the smallest  i.e., best  solution, according to the objective, is  in the leftmost position and the largest  i.e., worst  is on the rightmost.  Because the two solutions at outliers will be given crowding distance equal to   infinity, then we can start calculating the crowding distance for in-between solutions.  The data of the problem in Table 4-10 is available in the following for making it easier   to calculate the crowding distance.

First objective crowding distance for level 2 solutions  In the same way, Figure 4-10 shows how the crowding distance is calculated for   solutions B and E according to the feedback objective.  Figure 4-10.  First objective crowding distance for level 2 solutions  164   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  By summing the crowding distances of the two objectives and sorting the result in   descending order, the result is shown in Table 4-12. If we are in need of just one solution  from level 2 as a parent, then it will be the first solution in Table 4-12 after sorting the  summation of the crowding distances in descending order. That solution is solution C.   As a result, the set of selected solutions will be {A, D, F, C}. Note that not all of these  solutions will be used for generating the new offspring because they might be filtered  by tournament selection. But all of these solutions will be used to form the first half of  the solutions in the new generation. The second half will come from mating the parents  selected from the tournament.  Table 4-12.  Summation of the Crowding  Distances of Level 2 Solutions from the  Two Objective Functions  ID  C  h  e  B  Summation  infinity  infinity  0.44  0.3   Tournament Selection In the tournament selection, we create pairs of solutions from the selected parents. From  each pair, a tournament made between them and the winner will be used further in  crossover and mutation. All possible pairs are  A, D ,  A, F ,  A, C ,  D, C , and  F, C .  Here is how the winners of the tournament are selected:          If the two solutions are from different nondominance levels, then the  solution coming from the high-priority level will be the winner.  If the two solutions are from the same nondominance level, then the  winner will be the one corresponding to higher crowding distance.  Let’s consider the first pair  A, D . Because they are coming from the same level, we  will use their crowding distance to learn the winner. Because we have not calculated the  crowding distance of the first level, we need to first calculate it.  165   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Figure 4-11 shows the final crowding distance for solutions in level 1 according to  both objectives. Regarding the first pair  A, D , the winner is D because it has higher  crowding distance than A. For the remaining tournaments, the winners are F, A, D, and F.  These three unique solutions, A, D, and F, are used to generate four offspring.  Figure 4-11.  Summation of the crowding distances of level 1 solutions from the  two objective functions   Crossover Assume we choose four new solutions from the pairs  A, D ,  A, F ,  D, F , and  F, A ,  where the first and last half of the genes of the offspring are taken from the first and last  solution in each pair, respectively. The result of the crossover is in Table 4-13.  Table 4-13.

Assume we applied mutation by  randomly adding a number between –10 and 10 to the first half of each solution. The  result of the mutation operation is as shown in Table 4-14.  Table 4-14.

The first four solutions are those produced by nondominated sorting and crowding  distance. The remaining four solutions are what we just produced by tournament  selection, crossover, and mutation as in Table 4-14. Solutions of the new population in  generation 1 are in Table 4-15.  Table 4-15.

Next is to repeat steps 2 to 5 of NSGA-II until a number of predefined generations  iterations. After the first generation, the algorithm found solution M, which is better  than all solutions in the previous population. Going through multiple generations, the  algorithm is likely to find a better solution.   Optimizing ANN Using GA In Chapter 4, the ANN is trained using four classes of the Fruits 360 dataset without using  a learning algorithm. Thus, the accuracy is low, not exceeding 45%. After understanding  how GA works based on numerical examples in addition to implementation using  Python, this section uses GA to optimize the ANN by updating its weights  parameters .  GA creates multiple solutions to a given problem and evolves them through a   number of generations. Each solution holds all parameters that might help to enhance  the results. For ANN, weights in all layers help achieve high accuracy. Thus, a single  solution in GA will contain all weights in the ANN. According to Figure 4-7, the ANN  has four layers  one input, two hidden, and one output . Any weight in any layer will be  part of the same solution. A single solution to this network will contain a total number  of weights equal to 102×150+150×60+60×4=24,540. If the population has eight solutions  with 24,540 parameters per solution, then the total number of parameters in the entire  population is 24,540×8=196,320.  Looking at Figure 4-8, the parameters of the network are in matrix form, because this   makes calculations of ANN much easier. For each layer, there is an associated weights  matrix. Just multiply the inputs matrix by the parameters matrix of a given layer to  return the outputs in this layer. Chromosomes in GA are 1D vectors, and thus we have to  convert the weights matrices into 1D vectors.  Because matrix multiplication is a good option to work with ANN, we will still   represent the ANN parameters in the matrix form when using the ANN. Figure 4-12  summarizes the steps of using GA with ANN.  168   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Figure 4-12.  Using GA to optimize ANN parameters  Each solution in the population will have two representations. First is a 1D vector  for working with GA and second is a matrix to work with ANN. Because there are three  weights matrices for the three layers  two hidden + one output , there will be three  vectors, one for each matrix. Because a solution in GA is represented as a single 1D  vector, these three individual 1D vectors will be concatenated into a single 1D vector.  Each solution will be represented as a vector of length 24,540. Listing 4-11 holds the  Python code of the “mat_to_vector” function, which converts the parameters of all  solutions within the population from matrix to vector.  169   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  An empty list variable named “pop_weights_vector” is created to hold the vectors   of all solutions. The function accepts a population of solutions and loops through them.  For each solution, there is an inner loop that loops through its three matrices. For each  matrix, it is converted into a vector using the “numpy.reshape” function, which accepts  the input matrix and the output size to which the matrix will be reshaped. The variable  “curr_vector” accepts all vectors for a single solution. After all vectors are generated, they  get appended into the “pop_weights_vector” variable.  Note that we used the “numpy.extend” function for vectors belonging to the same   solution and “numpy.append” for vectors belonging to different solutions. The reason is  that “numpy.extend” takes the numbers within the three vectors belonging to the same  solution and concatenate them together. In other words, calling this function for two lists  returns a new single list with numbers from both lists. This is suitable in order to create  just a 1D chromosome for each solution. But “numpy.append” will return three lists for  each solution. Calling it for two lists, it returns a new list, which is split into two sublists.  This is not our objective. Finally, the function “mat_to_vector” returns the population  solutions as a NumPy array for easy manipulation later.  Listing 4-11.  Parameters Matrix Conversion into Vector  def mat_to_vector mat_pop_weights :     pop_weights_vector = []     for sol_idx in range mat_pop_weights.shape[0] :         curr_vector = []         for layer_idx in range mat_pop_weights.shape[1] :              vector_weights = numpy.reshape mat_pop_weights[sol_idx,   layer_idx], newshape= mat_pop_weights[sol_idx, layer_idx]. size                curr_vector.extend vector_weights          pop_weights_vector.append curr_vector      return numpy.array pop_weights_vector   After converting all solutions from matrices to vectors and concatenating them   together, we are ready to go through the GA steps according to Figure 4-2. All steps in  Figure 4-2 except for the fitness values calculation are similar to the previously discussed  GA implementation.  170   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  One of the common fitness functions for a classifier such as ANN is the accuracy. It  is the ratio between the correctly classified samples and the total number of samples. It  is calculated according to Equation 4-8. The classification accuracy of each solution is  calculated according to the steps in Figure 4-12.     Accuracy  =  NumCorrectClassify TotalNumSamples      Equation 4-8   The single 1D vector of each solution is converted back into three matrices, one  matrix for each layer  two hidden and one output . Conversion takes place using the  “vector_to_mat” function defined in Listing 4-12. It reverses the work done previously.  But there is an important question: if the vector of a given solution is just one piece, how  we can split it into three different parts, each part representing a matrix? The size of the  first parameters matrix between the input layer and the hidden layer is 102×150. When  being converted into a vector, its length will be 15,300. Because it is the first vector to be  inserted in the “curr_vector” variable according to Listing 4-11, then it will start from  index 0 and end at index 15,299. The “mat_pop_weights” is used as an argument for the  “vector_to_mat” function in order to learn the size of each matrix. It is not required to  contain the recent weights; just the sizes of the matrices are used from it.  Listing 4-12.  Solution Vector Conversion into Matrices  def vector_to_mat vector_pop_weights, mat_pop_weights :     mat_weights = []     for sol_idx in range mat_pop_weights.shape[0] :         start = 0         end = 0         for layer_idx in range mat_pop_weights.shape[1] :             end = end + mat_pop_weights[sol_idx, layer_idx].size             curr_vector = vector_pop_weights[sol_idx, start:end]              mat_layer_weights = numpy.reshape curr_vector, newshape=    mat_pop_weights[sol_idx, layer_idx].shape                mat_weights.append mat_layer_weights              start = end     return numpy.reshape mat_weights, newshape=mat_pop_weights.shape   171   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  For the second vector in the same solution, it’s the result of converting a matrix of   size 150×60. Thus, the vector length is 9,000. This vector is inserted into the “curr_vector”  variable just before the previous vector of length 15,300. As a result, it will start from  index 15,300 and ends at index 15,300+9,000–1=24,299. The –1 is used because Python  starts indexing at 0. For the last vector created from the parameters matrix of size 60×4,  its length is 240. Because it is added into the “curr_vector” variable exactly after the  previous vector of length 9,000, then its index will start after it. That is, its start index  is 24,300 and its end index is 24,300+240–1=24,539. So, we can successfully restore the  vector into the original three matrices.  The matrices returned for each solution are used to predict the class label for each   of the 1,962 samples in the used dataset to calculate the accuracy. This is done using two  functions  “predict_outputs” and “fitness”  according to Listing 4-13.  Listing 4-13.  Predicting Class Labels for Calculating Accuracy  def predict_outputs weights_mat, data_inputs, data_outputs,  activation="relu" :     predictions = numpy.zeros shape= data_inputs.shape[0]       for sample_idx in range data_inputs.shape[0] :         r1 = data_inputs[sample_idx, :]         for curr_weights in weights_mat:             r1 = numpy.matmul a=r1, b=curr_weights              if activation == "relu":                 r1 = relu r1              elif activation == "sigmoid":                 r1 = sigmoid r1          predicted_label = numpy.where r1 == numpy.max r1  [0][0]         predictions[sample_idx] = predicted_label     correct_predictions = numpy.where predictions == data_outputs [0].size     accuracy =  correct_predictions data_outputs.size *100     return accuracy, predictions  def fitness weights_mat, data_inputs, data_outputs, activation="relu" :     accuracy = numpy.empty shape= weights_mat.shape[0]       for sol_idx in range weights_mat.shape[0] :         curr_sol_mat = weights_mat[sol_idx, :]  172   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON           accuracy[sol_idx], _ = predict_outputs curr_sol_mat, data_inputs,   data_outputs, activation=activation       return accuracy  The “predict_outputs” function accepts the weights of a single solution, inputs and  outputs of the training data, and an optional parameter that specifies which activation  function to use. It is similar to the previous function created in Listing 4-7, but the  difference is being adapted to return the accuracy of the solution. But it returns the  accuracy of just one solution, not all solutions within the population. This is the role  of the “fitness” function to loop through each solution, pass it to the “predict_outputs”  function, store the accuracy of all solutions into the “accuracy” array, and finally return  the array.  After calculating the fitness value  i.e., accuracy  for each solution, the remaining   steps of GA in Figure 4-12 are applied the same way as done previously. The best  parents are selected, based on their accuracy, into the mating pool. Then mutation and  crossover variants are applied in order to produce the offspring. The population of the  new generation is created using both offspring and parents. These steps are repeated for  a number of generations.   Complete Python Implementation The Python implementation for this project has three Python files:    1.  GA.py for implementing GA functions.    2.  ANN.py for implementing ANN functions.    3.  Third file for calling such functions through a number of   generations.  The third file is the main file because it connects all functions. It reads the features and   the class label files, filters features based on STD value 50, creates the ANN architecture,  generates the initial solutions, loops through a number of generations by calculating the  fitness values for all solutions, selects the best parents, applies crossover and mutation,  and finally creates the new population. Its implementation is in Listing 4-14. This file  defines the GA parameters, such as the number of solutions per population, number of  selected parents, mutation percentage, and number of generations. You can try different  values for them.  173   Listing 4-14.

It is shown in Figure 4-13. After 1,000 iterations, the accuracy is more than 97%. This is  compared to 45% without using an optimization technique. This is an evidence about  why results might be bad, not because there is something wrong in the model or the data  but because no optimization technique is used. Of course, using different values for the  parameters such as 10,000 generations might increase the accuracy. At the end of this  file, it saves the parameters in matrix form to the disk for use later.  Figure 4-13.  Classification accuracy evolution according to 1,000 iterations  The GA.py file implementation is in Listing 4-15. Note that the “mutation” function   accepts the “mutation_percent” parameter, which defines the number of genes to  change their values randomly. It is set to 10% in the main file in Listing 4-14. This file  holds the two new functions “mat_to_vector” and “vector_to_mat”.  177   Chapter 4    aNN OptimizatiON  Listing 4-15.

The reason is that each neuron in a layer i is connected to all neurons in layers i-1  and i+1. Each connection between two neurons has two parameters: the weight and  the bias. Adding more layers and neurons increases the number of parameters. As a  result, it is very time-consuming to train such networks even on devices on multiple  graphics processing units  GPUs  and multiple central processing units  CPUs . It  becomes impossible to train such networks on PCs with limited processing and memory  capabilities.  In the analysis of multidimensional data such as images, CNNs  also known as   ConvNets  are more time and memory efficient than FC networks. But why? What are the  advantages of ConvNets over FC networks in image analysis? How is ConvNet derived  from FC networks? Where does the term convolution in CNNs come from? These  questions are to be answered in this chapter. To have a better understanding of how  everything works, this chapter implements the CNN using the NumPy library by working  through all steps required to build the different layers in these networks, including  convolution, pooling, activation, and FC. Finally, a project called NumPyCNN will be  created to help create a CNN easily and then learn how to deploy it in Appendix A.   From ANN to CNN ANN is the base of the CNN, with some changes added to make it suitable for analyzing  large amounts of data. Connecting all neurons together increases the number of  parameters even when analyzing very small images  e.g., one of 150×150 pixels . The  input layer in this case will have 22,500 neurons. Connecting it to another hidden     Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7_5  183   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  layer with 500 neurons, the number of parameters required is 22,500×500=11,250,000.  Real-world applications might work with high-dimensionality images where the least  dimension might have 1,000 pixels and more. For an input image of size 1,000×1,000 and  a hidden layer of 2,000 neurons, the number of parameters equals 2 billion. Note that the  input image is gray.  The next subsections cover the following questions: What is the intuition behind   using CNN over ANN? Do we really need all of the parameters used in traditional ANN?  How is CNN different from ANN, and how is it derived from ANN? Finally, what is the  source of the term convolution used in CNN? Let’s start answering these questions.   The Intuition Behind DL In Chapter 1, we handled the task of feature extraction. This is the traditional approach  to perform image analysis tasks, which involve using a set of features that are  representative for the problem being solved. This might require the help of experts in the  field being studied, because one feature might be robust for a given problem but weak  for another. Selecting the best features to a given problem is the challenge. Starting from  a very large number of features, how can they be reduced to the best minimum set?  We might be able to find a set of features when working with a small amount of data   in which there is a slight variation. The more variations existing in the data, the more  difficult it is to find a set of features covering all of them.  In a traditional classification problem, the goal is to find the best set of features   that separate the classes used. After calculating feature 1 based on the f1   function, the  samples from each class are given in Figure 5-1. The function did well for the left part of  the first class, but it is very bad for the part to the right of the same class. There is overlap  between the two classes in this part, and thus classification accuracy is very bad. Even  the most complex ML models cannot fit this data. This is because many samples almost  have the same value as f1  . The function f1   needs some changes in order to enhance  the classification performance.  184   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Figure 5-1.  Two-class data distribution using f1  . Class 1 samples are represented  as filled circles and class 2 samples as empty circles.  To solve that problem, the result of f1   will be used as inputs for another function f2  .    As a result, for an input sample s1, the final features for it will be the result of a chain  of functions f2 f1 s1  . The data distribution is as shown in Figure 5-2. It seems that the  results enhanced more than the previous one. The percentage of overlap compared to  the first case is reduced as some samples in the second class are clearly away from the  first class. Still, there is overlap between the two classes. We aim to split the data so that  each sample is near from the samples within its class and also far away from the samples  in the other class.  185   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Figure 5-2.  Data distribution using f2  f1     To enhance the results of classification, we can use the outputs of the f2   as input to  another function f3   so that the chain of functions is f3 f2 f1    . According to Figure 5-3,  the results are better than the previous two cases.  Figure 5-3.  Data distribution using f3  f2  f1      186   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  By working the same way and using a fourth function f4  , we can find an acceptable  result as in Figure 5-4. At that point, we can build a very simple linear classifier that splits  the data. We might note that after building a robust feature function, the classification  becomes very easy. This is compared to a bad feature function, as in Figure 5-1, which  requires the use of a very complex classifier.  Figure 5-4.  Linear classification after separating the data correctly  The previous discussion summarizes the target of DL models, which is automatic   feature transformation. The goal is to create a feature transformation function that  transforms the data samples from a bad state in which performing the ML task is  complex to another state in which the task is simpler.  CNNs, which are the focus of this book, accept the pure image pixels and find by   themselves the best set of features that classify the data correctly. Each layer within the  CNN transforms the data from one state to another for enhancing the performance. The  beauty of the ANN is that it is a universal function approximator that can approximate any  type of function. Each function will have a set of parameters, which are the weights and  bias. The output of one function  i.e., layer  is the input to another function  i.e., layer .  The ANN architecture is extended until the classification performance is the best. For  example, we can associate each step discussed previously with a hidden layer, and thus  the network will have the architecture shown in Figure 5-5. This gives an understanding  of the usefulness of hidden layers, which is a trouble for newbies in ANN.  187   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Figure 5-5.  ANN required to transform the data for separation of the class by  using a linear classifier  The next section discusses how CNN is derived from ANN and how it is more   efficient in image analysis than traditional ANN.   Derivation of Convolution Image analysis has a number of challenges, such as classification, object detection,  recognition, description, and so forth. If an image classifier, for example, is to be created,  it should be able to work with a high accuracy even with variations such as occlusion,  illumination changes, viewing angles, and others. The traditional pipeline of image  classification with its main step of feature engineering is not suitable for working in  rich environments. Even experts in the field won’t be able to give a single or a group  of features that are able to reach high accuracy under different variations. From this  problem, the idea of feature learning came out. The suitable features to work with images  are learned automatically. This is why ANN is one of the most robust ways of performing  image analysis. Based on a learning algorithm such as GD, ANN learns the image  features automatically. The raw image is applied to the ANN and ANN is responsible for  generating the features describing it.  188   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   Image Analysis Using FC Network  Let’s see how ANN works with images and why CNN is efficient in its time and memory  requirements with respect to the 3×3 gray image in Figure 5-6. The example given uses a  small image size and a lower number of neurons for simplicity.  Figure 5-6.  Tiny image as input to an FCNN  The inputs of the ANN input layer are the image pixels. Each pixel represents an   input. Because the ANN works with 1D vectors, not 2D matrices, it is better to convert  the preceding 2D image into a 1D vector, as in Figure 5-7.  Input image  3  8 17 150  9 22 30  3  15 100 200  Input image  Input layer  3  8 17 150  9 22 30  3  15 100 200  9 Pixels  15 8 9 100 17 22 200 150 30  Figure 5-7.  2D image to 1D vector  Each pixel is mapped to an element in the vector. Each element in the vector   represented a neuron in ANN. Because the image has 3×3=9 pixels, then there will  be nine neurons in the input layer. Representing the vector as row or column doesn’t  matter, but ANN usually extends horizontally, and each of its layers is represented as a  column vector.  189   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  After preparing the input of the ANN, next is to add the hidden layer s  that learns   how to convert the image pixels into representative features. Assume that there is a single  hidden layer with 16 neurons, as in Figure 5-8.  Hidden layer with 16 neurons  Each pixel is connected to all neurons. There are 16 connection for each input. Each connection has a weight parameter.  There are 16 parameters for each input.  For all 9 inputs, there are a total of 9 x 16 = 144 parameters.

Connections from a single input neuron to all hidden layer neurons  Because the network is FC, this means that each neuron in layer i is connected to   all neurons in layer i-1. As a result, each neuron in the hidden layer is connected to all 9  pixels in the input layer. In other words, each input pixel is connected to the 16 neurons  in the hidden layer, where each connection has a corresponding unique parameter.  By connecting each pixel to all neurons in the hidden layer, there will be 9×16=144  parameters or weights for a tiny network such as that shown in Figure 5-9.  190   Input image  Input layer  3  15  100  200  3  8  17  150  9  22  30  9 Pixels  15  8  9  100  17  22  200  150  30  Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Hidden layer 16 Neurons  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11 12 13 14 15  Figure 5-9.  Connecting all input neurons to all hidden layer neurons   Large Number of Parameters  The number of parameters in this FC network seems acceptable. But this number greatly  increases as the number of image pixels and hidden layers increases.  For example, if this network has two hidden layers with 90 and 50 neurons,   respectively, then the number of parameters between the input layer and the first  hidden layer is 9×90=810. The number of parameters between the two hidden layers is  90×50=4,500. The total number of parameters in this network is 810+4,500=5,310. This  is a large number for such a network. Another case of a very small image of size 32×32   1,024 pixels . If the network operates with a single hidden layer of 500 neurons, there are  a total of 1,024*500=512,000 parameters  weight . This is a huge number for a network  with just a single hidden layer working with a small image. There must be a solution to  decrease this number of parameters. This is where CNN has a critical role. It creates a  very large network but with fewer parameters than FC networks.  191   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   Neuron Grouping  The problem that makes the number of parameters get very large even for small  networks is that FC networks add a parameter between every two neurons in the  successive layers. Rather than assigning a single parameter between every two neurons,  a single parameter may be given to a block or group of neurons as in Figure 5-10. The  pixel with index 0 in Figure 5-8 is connected to the first four neurons with indices  0, 1,  2, and 3  with four different weights. If the neurons are grouped in groups of four as in  Figure 5-10, then all neurons inside the same group will be assigned a single parameter.  Hidden layer 16 neurons  Input image  Input layer  3  15 100 200  3  8 17 150  9 22 30  9 Pixels  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  15 8 9 100 17 22 200 150 30  W  0 0  W  1 0  W  2 0  W  3 0  W  y x  Group index Input  pixel  index  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  11 12 13 14 15  Figure 5-10.  Grouping every four hidden neurons to use the same weight  As a result, the pixel with index 0 in Figure 5-10 will be connected to the first four   neurons with the same weight as in Figure 5-11. The same parameter is assigned to  every four successive neurons. As a result, the number of parameters is reduced by a  factor of 4. Each input neuron will have 16 4=4 parameters. The entire network will have  144 4=36 parameters. It is a 75% reduction of the parameters. This is fine, but it is still  possible to reduce more parameters.  192   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Input image  Input layer  3  8 17 150  9 22 30  3  15 100 200  9 Pixels  W  0 0  W  1 0  W  2 0  W  3 0  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  15 8 9 100 17 22 200 150 30  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  W  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0  2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0  3 0 3 0 3 0 3 0  0 1 2 3  4 5 6 7  8 9 10  11  12 13 14 15  Figure 5-11.  All neurons in the same group are using the same weight  Because there are four groups of neurons, that means there are four filters in this   layer. As a result, the output of this layer will have its third dimension equal to 3, which  means three filtered images will be returned. The goal of CNN is to find the best values  for such filters that make each input image associated with its class label.  Figure 5-12 shows the unique connections from each pixel to the first neuron of  each group. That is, all missing connections are just duplicates of the existing ones.  Hypothetically, there is a connection from each pixel to each neuron in each group, as in  Figure 5-9, because the network is still FC.  193   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Input image  Input layer  3  8  17  150  9  22  30  3  15  100  200  9 Pixels  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7 8  15 8  9 100  17 22 200  150 30  Each pixel is connected to all groups of neurons. In other words, each group of neurons is connected to all pixels. As a result, each group will have 16 parameters. Total number of parameters will be  9 x 4 = 36.  Figure 5-12.  Fewer unique connections between the input layer and the hidden  layer after hidden neurons grouping  To make it simple, all connections are omitted except for the connections between   all pixels to just the first neuron in the first group, as shown in Figure 5-13. It seems  that each group is still connected to all 9 pixels, and thus it will have 9 parameters. It is  possible to reduce the number of pixels that this neuron is connected to.  Input image  Input layer  3  8  17  150  9  22  30  3  15  100  200  9 Pixels  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7 8  15 8  9 100  17 22 200  150 30  Each neuron in each group works on all pixels. This assumes there are same types of correlation among all image pixels. But in fact, as the pixels become spatially away from each other as there will be less correlation among them.  Rather than working with all pixels, each neuron will accept just same pixels that are spatially correlated.  Figure 5-13.  Connections between all neurons in the input layer to the first group  of neurons within the hidden layer 194  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7  8 9  10 11  12  13 14 15  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7  8 9  10 11  12  13 14 15   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   Pixel Spatial Correlation  Current configuration makes each neuron accepts all pixels. If there is a function  f x1, x2, x3, x4  that accepts four inputs, that means the decision is to be taken based on  all four of these inputs. If the function with just two inputs gives the same results as using  all four inputs, then we do not have to use all of these four inputs. The two inputs giving  the required results are sufficient. This is similar to the preceding case. Each neuron  accepts all 9 pixels as inputs. If the same or better results will be returned by using fewer  pixels, then we should go through it.  Usually, in image analysis, each pixel is highly correlated to pixels surrounding   it  i.e., neighbors . The higher the distance between two pixels, the more they will be  uncorrelated. For example, in the cameraman image shown in Figure 5-14, a pixel inside  the face is correlated to the surrounding face pixels around it. But it is less correlated to  far pixels such as sky or ground.  Figure 5-14.  Cameraman image  Based on this assumption, each neuron in the preceding example will accept just   pixels that are spatially correlated to each other, because working on all of them is  reasonable. Rather than applying all 9 pixels to each neuron as input, it is possible to  just select 4 spatially correlated pixels as in Figure 5-15. The first pixel of index 0 in the  column vector located at  0,0  in the image will be applied as an input to the first neuron   195   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  with its 3 most spatially correlated pixels. Based on the input image, the 3 most spatially  correlated pixels to that pixel are pixels with indices  0,1 ,  1,0 , and  1,1 . As a result,  the neuron will accept just 4 pixels rather than 9. Because all neurons in the same group  share the same parameters, then the 4 neurons in each group will have just 4 parameters  rather than 9. As a result, the total number of parameters will be 4×4=16. Compared to  the FC network in Figure 5-9, there is a reduction of a 144–16=128 parameter  i.e., 88.89%  reduction .  Input image  Input layer  3  8  17  150  9  22  30  3  15  100  200  9 Pixels  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7 8  15 8  9 100  17 22 200  150 30  Each neuron in each group can work with just 4 pixels rather than all 9 pixels.  The pixels are selected to be neighbour of each others.  Doing that reduces the number of parameter required for each group of neuron.  Now there are 4 parameters for each group rather than 9.  Total number of parameter is reduced from 9 x 4 = 36 to just 4 x 4 = 16.  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7  8 9  10 11  12  13 14 15  Figure 5-15.  Connecting the first group of correlated pixels to the first group   Convolution in CNN  At this point, the question of why CNN is more time and memory efficient than the FC  network is answered. Using fewer parameters allows the increase of a deep CNN with a  huge number of layers and neurons, which is not possible in the FC network. Next is to  get the idea of convolution in CNN.  Now there are just four weights assigned to all neurons in the same block. How will   these four weights cover all 9 pixels? Let’s see how this works.  Figure 5-16 shows the previous network in Figure 5-15 but after adding the weight  labels to the connections. Inside the neuron, each of the 4 input pixels is multiplied by   196   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  its corresponding weight. The equation is shown in Figure 5-16. The four pixels and  weights would be better visualized as matrices as in Figure 5-16. The previous result will  be achieved by multiplying the weights matrix to the current set of 4 pixels element by  element. In practice, the size of the convolution mask should be odd, such as 3×3. For  easier presentation, a 2×2 mask is used in this example.  Input image  Input layer  3  8  17  150  9  22  30  3  15  100  200  9 Pixels  W0  W2  W1  W3  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7 8  15 8  9 100  17 22 200  150 30  This can be visualized as follows  15  100  200  8  17  150  9  22  30  *  W0 W2  W1 W3  It is a convolution between the image and the weights of the block.  15 x W0 + 8 x W1 + 100 x W2 + 17 x W3  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7  8 9  10 11  12  13 14 15  Figure 5-16.  Adding weights of each connection and visualizing them as a matrix  Moving to the next neuron of index 1, it will work with another set of spatially   correlated pixels with the same weights used by the neuron with index 0. Also, neurons  with indices 2 and 3 will work with other two sets of spatially correlated pixels. This is  shown in Figure 5-17. It seems that the first neuron in the group starts from the top-  left pixel and chooses a number of pixels surrounding it. The last neuron in the group  works on the bottom-right pixel and its surrounding pixels. The in-between neurons are  adjusted to select in-between pixels. Such behavior is identical to convolution between  the set of weights of the group and the image. This is why CNN has the term convolution.  197   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Input image  Input layer  This can be visualized as follows  3  8  17  150  9  22  30  3  15  100  200  9 Pixels  0 1  2 3  4 5 6  7 8  15 8  9 100  17 22 200  150 30  0 1  2 3 4 5 6  7 8 9  10 11 12  13 14 15  15  100  200  15  100  200  15  100  200  15  100  200  8  17  150  8  17  150  8  17  150  8  17  150  9  22  30  9  22  30  9  22  30  9  22  30  *  *  *  *  W0 W2  W0 W2  W0 W2  W0 W2  W1 W3  W1 W3  W1 W3  W1 W3  Figure 5-17.  Highlighting each set of correlated pixels along with their weights as  a matrix  The same procedure happens for the remaining groups of neurons. The first neuron  of each group starts from the top-left corner and its surrounding pixels. The last neuron  of each group works with the bottom-right corner and its surrounding pixels. The in-  between neurons work on the in-between pixels.  After understanding how CNN is derived from ANN, we can take an example that  performs convolution between an input image and a filter  i.e., a set of weights  and  produces its result.   Designing a CNN In the example we are going to design using CNN, there are three shapes: rectangle,  triangle, and circle. Each one of them is represented by a 4×4 matrix as in Figure 5-18,  where 1 represents white and 0 represents black. The goal is to build a CNN to return 1  when there is a rectangle and 0 otherwise. How can we do that?  198   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:90  cid:286  cid:272  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:100  cid:396  cid:349  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:18  cid:349  cid:396  cid:272  cid:367  cid:286   Figure 5-18.  Rectangle, triangle, and circle represented by 4×4 matrices. Pixel of 1  is white and pixel of 0 is black.  When starting to design a CNN, the first step is to determine the number of layers   and number of filters within each layer. Usually, CNN has more than just a convolution   conv for short  layer, but we will start only using this layer. You can test yourself to solve  such a problem.  First, the convolution layer investigates the building blocks of the shape structure we   are looking for. So, the first question to ask yourself is what is special about a rectangle  compared to a triangle and a circle. The rectangular shape has four edges, two vertical  and two horizontal. We can benefit from such information. But also note that properties  existing in the rectangle should not exist in the other shapes. Other shapes already have  different properties. Neither of the two other shapes have two horizontal edges and two  vertical edges. This is great.  The next question is how to make the convolution layer recognize the existence of   the edges. Remember that CNN starts by recognizing the individual elements of the  shape and then connects these elements together. So, we are not looking to find the four  edges nor looking to find two parallel vertical edges and two parallel horizontal edges,  but instead to recognize any vertical or horizontal edge. So, the question becomes more  specific. How can we to recognize vertical or horizontal edges? This can be simply done  using gradients.  The first layer will have a filter that looks for horizontal edges and another filter for  vertical edges. These filters are shown in Figure 5-19 as 3×3 matrices. So, we know how  many filters to use in the first conv layer and also what these filters are. The size of 3×3 is  chosen for the filters because it is a good size at which the structure of the horizontal and  vertical edges is clear.  199   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:882  cid:1005    cid:882  cid:1005    cid:882  cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:882  cid:1005    cid:882  cid:1005    cid:882  cid:1005    cid:44  cid:381  cid:396  cid:349  cid:460  cid:381  cid:374  cid:410  cid:258  cid:367    cid:115  cid:286  cid:396  cid:415  cid:272  cid:258  cid:367   Figure 5-19.  Filters for recognizing horizontal and vertical edges of size 3×3  After applying these filters over the matrices in Figure 5-19, the conv layer will be able   to recognize the vertical edges in Figure 5-20 and the horizontal edges in Figure 5- 21.  The layer is able to recognize the horizontal and vertical edges in the rectangle. It also  recognized the horizontal edge at the triangle base. But there is no edge in the circle. At the  current time, the CNN has two candidates to be a rectangle, which are the shapes having at  least one edge. Despite being sure that the third shape could not be a rectangle, the CNN  has to propagate it to the other layers until making its decision at the final layer. Because of  using two filters in the first conv layer, it results in two outputs, one for each filter.   cid:90  cid:286  cid:272  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:100  cid:396  cid:349  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:18  cid:349  cid:396  cid:272  cid:367  cid:286   Figure 5-20.

Recognized horizontal edges in black  200   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  The next convolution layer will accept the results of the first convolution layer and   continue based on it. Let’s repeat the same questions asked in the first layer. What is the  number of filters to use and what is their structure? Based on the rectangle structure,  we find that each horizontal edge is connected to a vertical edge. Because there are two  horizontal edges, this requires the use of the two filters in Figure 5-22 of size 3×3.   cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1004    cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:44  cid:381  cid:396  cid:349  cid:460  cid:381  cid:374  cid:410  cid:258  cid:367    cid:115  cid:286  cid:396  cid:415  cid:272  cid:258  cid:367   Figure 5-22.  Filters for recognizing connected horizontal and vertical   edges of size 3×3  After applying those filters to the results of conv layer 1, the results of the filters   used in the second conv layer are shown in Figure 5-23 and Figure 5-24, respectively.  Regarding the rectangle, the filters are able to find the two required edges and connect  them together. In the triangle, there is just a single horizontal edge with no vertical edge  connected to it. As a result, there are no positive outputs for the triangle.   cid:90  cid:286  cid:272  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:100  cid:396  cid:349  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:18  cid:349  cid:396  cid:272  cid:367  cid:286   Figure 5-23.

We connected the individual edges to more  meaningful structures. Now, there is just a single step toward recognizing the complete  shape, which is connecting the recognized edges in Figures 5-23 and 5-24. The result is  in Figure 5-25. This is great.   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1005    cid:1005   cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1005    cid:1005   cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:90  cid:286  cid:272  cid:410  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1005    cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:1005    cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:100  cid:396  cid:349  cid:258  cid:374  cid:336  cid:367  cid:286    cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:1005    cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1004    cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1004    cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1004   cid:1005   cid:1005   cid:18  cid:349  cid:396  cid:272  cid:367  cid:286   Figure 5-25.  Results of connecting recognized shapes by the second conv layer  But we did the work manually, not automatically. We guided the CNN by telling it   the filters to use. But this is not the case in regular problems. The CNN will find the filters  itself. We just tried to simplify things by using the correct filters. Remember that these  filters and the weights of connections between the different layers are automatically  adjusted by the CNN. So, finding the correct filters means finding the correct weights.  This links what we have learned now to what we got before.   Pooling Operation for Parameter Reduction The convolution operation just finds the dot product between a mask and an image  portion of the same size as the filter. If the filter matches a portion of the image, then the  SOP will be high. Assume that the output of applying the convolution operation is as  shown in Figure 5-26.   cid:1006  cid:1004    cid:1007    cid:1007    cid:1007  cid:1009    cid:1010    cid:1005    cid:1007    cid:1009    cid:1007    cid:1011  cid:1004    cid:1005    cid:1005    cid:1008    cid:1009    cid:1007    cid:1006  cid:1013   Figure 5-26.  Results of a convolution operation  202   The shaded regions are the ones at which there is a high match between the image   portions and the used filter. Note that there are two pieces of information here:  Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks    1.  The existence of high scores means that the region of interest    ROI  exists in the image.    2.  The location of the high scores tells the location in the image at   which match occurs between the filter and the image portion.  But are we interested in both these pieces of information? The answer is no. We are   just interested in the second piece. This is because the only goal of CNN is to tell whether  the target object exists in the image or not. We are not interested in localizing it.  As a result, if the exact location is not of concern for us, we can avoid storing such  spatial information. For example, we can say that the ROI exists in the image but avoid  storing its exact location. The previous matrix size will be reduced if we do so, as shown  in Figure 5-27.   cid:1006  cid:1004    cid:1007  cid:1009    cid:1011  cid:1004    cid:1006  cid:1013   Figure 5-27.  Results of a convolution operation  We can get rid of the extra information that tells the exact location of the image   portion with a match because it is not important for us. We just kept the information that  tells that a match occurred. This is by keeping the maximum values of the convolution  output matrix. Finding high scores tells us that there is a match.  But how did we reduce the matrix size? This is by just keeping the maximum value of   each 2×2 region for example. This operation is called max pooling.  By applying the max pooling operation, there is a very important improvement over  the computational time and memory requirements. Rather than keeping a matrix of size  4×4 in the memory, it is reduced to half size  2×2 . This saves memory by just keeping  4 values compared to 16. Moreover, the time is reduced because the output of that max  pooling operation will be the input of another convolution operation. This convolution  operation will work on a matrix of size 2×2 rather than 4×4.  Finally, applying the max pooling operation helps us reduce the computational time  and memory requirements by removing the spurious features that have no importance  for us in CNN  this is the exact location at which match occurred . This operation makes  the CNN translation invariance.  203    Convolutional neural networks  Chapter 5   Convolution Operation Example This subsection gives an example of how to apply the convolution operation over a  sample of size 8×8 from a 2D image shown in Figure 5-28. A single filter will be used in  the convolution, which is the horizontal gradient detector in Figure 5-19. Convolution is  applied by centering the filter over each pixel, multiplying each element in the filter by  its corresponding pixel in the image, returning the sum of these multiplications within a  new image.   cid:1010  cid:1009   cid:1012  cid:1008   cid:1006  cid:1005  cid:1009   cid:1005  cid:1011  cid:1009   cid:1011  cid:1006   cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1007   cid:1005  cid:1013   cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1004    cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1006   cid:1005  cid:1004  cid:1007   cid:1011  cid:1004    cid:1013  cid:1011   cid:1010  cid:1010   cid:1013  cid:1008    cid:1013  cid:1004   cid:1007  cid:1013    cid:1005  cid:1009  cid:1004   cid:1008  cid:1004   cid:1005  cid:1004  cid:1010   cid:1008  cid:1011   cid:1006  cid:1008  cid:1011   cid:1012  cid:1010    cid:1013  cid:1006   cid:1011  cid:1009    cid:1005  cid:1013  cid:1011   cid:1005  cid:1008   cid:1006  cid:1007  cid:1013   cid:1006  cid:1007   cid:1006  cid:1006  cid:1004   cid:1005  cid:1007  cid:1013   cid:1009  cid:1012   cid:1005  cid:1008  cid:1012    cid:1009    cid:1006    cid:1010  cid:1012   cid:1005  cid:1004  cid:1012   cid:1006  cid:1004  cid:1005   cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1009   cid:1006  cid:1007  cid:1011   cid:1005  cid:1010  cid:1005    cid:1013  cid:1004   cid:1006  cid:1008  cid:1010   cid:1006  cid:1007  cid:1009   cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1007   cid:1007  cid:1010   cid:1005  cid:1012  cid:1004   cid:1005  cid:1004  cid:1011   cid:1005  cid:1007  cid:1010    cid:1005   cid:1006  cid:1007  cid:1013   cid:1005  cid:1005  cid:1004   cid:1006  cid:1004  cid:1012   cid:1006  cid:1004  cid:1004   cid:1006  cid:1013   cid:1005  cid:1011  cid:1010   cid:1005  cid:1009  cid:1005    cid:1005  cid:1006  cid:1007   cid:1005  cid:1011  cid:1011   cid:1005  cid:1006  cid:1013   cid:1005  cid:1011  cid:1005   cid:1006  cid:1006  cid:1008   cid:1011  cid:1011    cid:1012  cid:1008   cid:1011  cid:1004   Figure 5-28.  Image sample of size 8×8 to apply the convolution operation  Because the filter size is 3×3 and each of its elements is multiplied by an element   within the image, then after centering the filter over any pixel there must be an element  corresponding to each element in the filter. It is obvious that this does not work for the  border of the image  i.e., leftmost and rightmost columns in addition to top and bottom  rows , as marked by gray in Figure 5-28. There are two solutions in such a case. The first  is to keep working with the pixels by padding extra rows and columns with zeros, or in  other words, multiplying any element if the filter doesn’t have a corresponding image  pixel by zero. This will produce an output image of equal size to the original image.  In this case, the number of rows required for padding at the top and bottom borders  is calculated according to Equation 5-1. The number of padded columns to the left and  right is calculated according to Equation 5-2. For our example with a filter size of 3×3,  there are two rows and two columns to be padded.  204               Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Equation 5-1   Paddingrows = floor Filterrows 2   Paddingcols = floor Filtercols 2     Equation 5-2   In most cases, the number of rows and columns in the filter is an odd number. This   helps localize a center pixel at which the SOP will be inserted.  The second solution is to avoid working with the image borders. In this case, the   resulting image will have a size less than that of the original image. The number of rows  and columns in the output image is calculated according to Equations 5.3 and 5.4,  respectively. For our input image of size 8×8, the size of the resultant image is 6×6.  NewSizerows = OldSizerows − 2xPaddingrows   NewSizecols = OldSizecols − 2xPaddingcols      Equation 5-3    Equation 5-4   Assuming that no padding is used, then the first pixel to work with is the pixel   located in the second row and second column with value 103. Centering the filter at this  pixel and multiplying each element by its corresponding pixels, the SOP is as follows:    sop =  65 1      +  84 0      +  215  -  1    +  162 1      +  103 0      +  70  -  1    +  150 1      +  40 0      +  1106  -  1    = -  14     This result is inserted in a new image at the pixel located at the top-left row and top-   left column. After calculating the output for one pixel, the next step is to shift the filter  to get another pixel. The number of shifts required is called stride. A stride of 1 shifts  the filter one column row at a time. In the current step, it will move the filter to the right  just one column and center the filter over the pixel in the second row and third column  with a value of 70. A stride of 2 shifts the filter two columns rows at a time, and thus the  current pixel will be 97.  Using a stride of 1, we will continue calculating the SOP for all pixels in the first row  starting from column 2 to column 7, each time calculating the SOP. After that, the filter  is shifted one row down, and thus the current pixel will be 40 located at the third row  and second column. The final result without padding and using a stride of 1 is shown in  Figure 5-29.  205   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1008    cid:1013  cid:1008    cid:882  cid:1010  cid:1005    cid:882  cid:1013  cid:1006    cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1004    cid:1010    cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1005  cid:1008    cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1005  cid:1012    cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1009  cid:1006    cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1006  cid:1006    cid:882  cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1009    cid:882  cid:1006  cid:1005  cid:1006    cid:882  cid:1006  cid:1009  cid:1004    cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1006  cid:1006    cid:882  cid:1007  cid:1005  cid:1011    cid:882  cid:1006  cid:1010  cid:1004    cid:882  cid:1012  cid:1006    cid:1007  cid:1004    cid:1012  cid:1009    cid:882  cid:1006  cid:1008    cid:1005  cid:1008    cid:882  cid:1005  cid:1004  cid:1004    cid:1005  cid:1013  cid:1009    cid:1007  cid:1008  cid:1010    cid:1005  cid:1012  cid:1008    cid:1006  cid:1013  cid:1007    cid:1006  cid:1012  cid:1005    cid:1009  cid:1009    cid:882  cid:1012  cid:1007    cid:1013  cid:1007    cid:1010  cid:1013    cid:1009  cid:1011    cid:1010    cid:1007  cid:1013    cid:882  cid:1011  cid:1008    cid:882  cid:1011  cid:1005   Figure 5-29.  Convolution output between an image of size 8×8 and a 3×3 filter   Max Pooling Operation Example Assuming that there is a conv layer that produced the previous result in Figure 5-29 and  that this layer is connected with a max pooling layer, let’s work on calculating its output.  The max pooling layer selects a group of pixels to summarize into a single pixel by   just keeping their maximum value. If a mask of size 2×2 is used, it will start from the  top-left 4 pixels marked in gray in Figure 5-29. Their maximum value is 94, which is the  output. Similar to convolution, max pooling will shift the mask to work on another 4  pixels, and thus it needs a stride. The stride value for the pooling layer is equal to 2 at the  minimum. The reason is that a stride of 1 will duplicate values without the output, which  is not helpful. In the highlighted pixels in black in Figure 5-29, the result of the max  pooling operation for the first two columns will be 30. Using a stride of 1 and shifting the  mask to the right by one column, the result of this operation for the last two columns  highlighted in black is also 30. As a result, a value of 30 appeared twice. Is it helpful to  return the same value more than once? A value of 30 returned the first time means that  there is a match between the convolution filter and the image that equals 30. So, we got  that information. There is no need to repeat it again. Working with a stride of 1 will use  more parameters to return repeated results we are not interested in. As a result, a stride  of 2 will be helpful.  The result of applying the max pooling operation over the convolution result in   Figure 5-29 is shown in Figure 5-30.  206   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   cid:1013  cid:1008    cid:882  cid:1010  cid:1005    cid:1007  cid:1004    cid:1010    cid:1012  cid:1009    cid:1006  cid:1013  cid:1007    cid:1006  cid:1012  cid:1005    cid:1007  cid:1010  cid:1008    cid:1013  cid:1007   Figure 5-30.  Max pooling output using a mask of size 2×2   Building a CNN Using NumPy from Scratch CNN is the state-of-the-art technique for analyzing multidimensional signals such as  images. There are different libraries that already implement CNN such as TensorFlow   TF  and Keras. These libraries isolate the developer from some details and just give an  abstract application program interface  API  to make life easier and avoid complexity in  the implementation. But in practice, such details might make a difference. Sometimes,  the data scientist has to go through such details to enhance the performance. The  solution in this situation is to build every piece of the model yourself. This gives the  highest possible level of control over the network.  It is recommended to implement such models to have a better understanding   of them. Some ideas seem to be clear, but that may not actually be the case until  programming. It will be easy to do that after learning how CNNs work. This section  shows how a CNN is implemented from scratch just using NumPy. So, let’s implement it  and compare its outputs with TF to validate the implementation.  In this section, a CNN is created using only the NumPy library. Three layers are   created: convolution  conv for short , ReLU, and max average pooling. The major steps  involved are as follows:    1.  Reading the input image.    2.  Preparing the filters.    3.  Conv layer: Convolving each filter with the input image.    4.  ReLU layer: Applying the ReLU activation function on the feature   maps  output of conv layer .    5.  Max pooling layer: Applying the pooling operation on the output   of ReLU layer.    6.  Stacking conv, ReLU, and max pooling layers.  207    Convolutional neural networks  Chapter 5   Reading the Input Image Listing 5-1 reads an already existing image from the skimage Python library and converts  it into gray.  Listing 5-1.  Reading an Image  import skimage.data  Reading the image img = skimage.data.chelsea    Converting the image into gray. img = skimage.color.rgb2gray img   This example uses an already existing image within the skimage Python library. The   image is called using skimage.data.chelsea  . Note that this call implicitly reads an  image file named “chelsea.png” within the skimage library installation directory. The  image could also be read by passing its path to the skimage.data.imread fname . For  example, if the library is located in “Lib\site-packages\skimage\data\”, then we could  read it as follows:  img =  skimage.data.chelsea "\AhmedGad\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\skimage\ data\chelsea.png"   Reading image is the first step because the next steps depend on the input size. The   image after being converted into gray is in Figure 5-31.  Figure 5-31.  Original gray image read using skimage.data.chelsea    208   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   Preparing Filters The following line prepares the filter bank for the first conv layer  l1 for short :  l1_filter = numpy.zeros  2,3,3    A zero array is created according to the number of filters and the size of each filter.  Two filters of size 3×3 are created; that is why the zero array is of size  2=num_filters,  3=num_rows_filter, 3=num_columns_filter . The size of the filter is selected to be a 2D  array without depth because the input image is gray and has no depth  i.e., 2D . If the  image is RGB with three channels, the filter size must be  3, 3, 3=depth .  The size of the filter bank is specified by the preceding zero array but not the actual  values of the filters. It is possible to override the values as follows to detect vertical and  horizontal edges.  l1_filter[0, :, :] = numpy.array [[[-1, 0, 1],                                    [-1, 0, 1],                                    [-1, 0, 1]]]  l1_filter[1, :, :] = numpy.array [[[1,   1,  1],                                    [0,   0,  0],                                    [-1, -1, -1]]]    Conv Layer After preparing the filters, the next step is to convolve the input image by them. The next  line convolves the image with the filter bank using a function called conv:  l1_feature_map = conv img, l1_filter   This function accepts just two arguments, the image and the filter bank, as   implemented in Listing 5-2.  Listing 5-2.  Convolving the Image by a Single Filter  def conv img, conv_filter :      if len img.shape  > 2 or len conv_filter.shape  > 3:  Check if number   of image channels matches the filter depth.  209   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks          if img.shape[-1] != conv_filter.shape[-1]:              print "Error: Number of channels in both image and filter must   match."               sys.exit       if conv_filter.shape[1] != conv_filter.shape[2]:          print 'Error: Filter must be a square matrix, i.e., number of rows   and columns must match.'           sys.exit       if conv_filter.shape[1]%2==0:  Check if filter dimensions are odd.          print 'Error: Filter must have an odd size, i.e., number of rows   and columns must be odd.'           sys.exit          An empty feature map to hold the output of convolving the filter s    with the image.      feature_maps = numpy.zeros  img.shape[0]-conv_filter.shape[1]+1,                                 img.shape[1]-conv_filter.shape[1]+1,                                 conv_filter.shape[0]         Convolving the image by the filter s .     for filter_num in range conv_filter.shape[0] :         print "Filter ", filter_num + 1           curr_filter = conv_filter[filter_num, :]  getting a filter from            Checking if there are multiple channels for the single filter.

The function starts by ensuring that the depth of each filter is equal to the number of   image channels. In the following code, the outer if checks if the channel and the filter  have a depth. If a depth already exists, then the inner if checks their inequality. If there  is no match, then the script will exit.  if len img.shape  > 2 or len conv_filter.shape  > 3:  Check if number of  image channels matches the filter depth.         if img.shape[-1] != conv_filter.shape[-1]:              print "Error: Number of channels in both image and filter must   match."               sys.exit    Moreover, the size of the filter should be odd and filter dimensions should be equal   i.e., number of rows and columns are odd and equal . This is checked according to the  following two if blocks. If these conditions don’t meet, the script will exit.  if conv_filter.shape[1] != conv_filter.shape[2]:  Check if filter  dimensions are equal.      print 'Error: Filter must be a square matrix, i.e., number of rows and   columns must match.'       sys.exit   if conv_filter.shape[1]%2==0:      print 'Error: Filter must have an odd size, i.e., number of rows and   columns must be odd.'       sys.exit    Not satisfying any of the conditions in the preceding is a proof that the filter depth is   suitable with the image, and convolution is ready to be applied. Convolving the image  by the filter starts by initializing an array to hold the outputs of convolution  i.e., feature  maps  by specifying its size according to the following code:  211   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks   An empty feature map to hold the output of convolving the filter s  with  the image. feature_maps = numpy.zeros  img.shape[0]-conv_filter.shape[1]+1,                             img.shape[1]-conv_filter.shape[1]+1,                             conv_filter.shape[0]    Because there is no stride or padding, the feature map size will be equal to  img_  rows-filter_rows+1, image_columns-filter_columns+1, num_filters  as in the preceding  code. Note that there is an output feature map for every filter in the bank. That is why the  number of filters in the filter bank  conv_filter.shape[0]  is used to specify the size as a  third argument. After preparing the inputs and outputs of the convolution operation, the  next step is to apply it according to Listing 5-3.  Listing 5-3.  Convolving the Image by Filters       Convolving the image by the filter s .     for filter_num in range conv_filter.shape[0] :         print "Filter ", filter_num + 1           curr_filter = conv_filter[filter_num, :]  getting a filter from            Checking if there are multiple channels for the single filter.          If so, then each channel will convolve the image.           The result of all convolutions is summed to return a single   the bank.  feature map.          if len curr_filter.shape  > 2:              conv_map = conv_ img[:, :, 0], curr_filter[:, :, 0]   Array   holding the sum of all feature maps.               for ch_num in range 1, curr_filter.shape[-1] :  Convolving   each channel with the image and summing the results.                  conv_map = conv_map + conv_ img[:, :, ch_num],                                   curr_filter[:, :, ch_num]          else:  There is just a single channel in the filter.             conv_map = conv_ img, curr_filter           feature_maps[:, :, filter_num] = conv_map  Holding feature map   with the current filter.      return feature_maps  Returning all feature maps.  212   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  The outer loop iterates over each filter in the filter bank and returns it for further   steps according to this line:  curr_filter = conv_filter[filter_num, :]  getting a filter from the bank.  If the image to be convolved has more than one channel, then the filter must have a  depth equal to this number of channels. Convolution, in this case, is done by convolving  each image channel with its corresponding channel in the filter. Finally, the sum of  the results will be the output feature map. If the image has just a single channel, then  convolution will be straightforward. Determining this behavior is done in an if-else block:  if len curr_filter.shape  > 2:       conv_map = conv_ img[:, :, 0], curr_filter[:, :, 0]   Array holding   the sum of all feature map        for ch_num in range 1, curr_filter.shape[-1] :  Convolving each   channel with the image and summing the results.          conv_map = conv_map + conv_ img[:, :, ch_num],                                    curr_filter[:, :, ch_num]  else:  There is just a single channel in the filter.     conv_map = conv_ img, curr_filter   You might notice that the convolution is applied by a function called conv_, which  is different from the conv function. The function conv just accepts the input image and  the filter bank but doesn’t apply convolution its own. It just passes each set of input-filter  pairs to be convolved to the conv_ function. This is just for making the code simpler to  investigate. Listing 5-4 gives the implementation of the conv_ function.  Listing 5-4.  Convolving the Image by All Filters  def conv_ img, conv_filter :     filter_size = conv_filter.shape[1]     result = numpy.zeros  img.shape       Looping through the image to apply the convolution operation.     for r in numpy.uint16 numpy.arange filter_size 2.0,                           img.shape[0]-filter_size 2.0+1  :         for c in numpy.uint16 numpy.arange filter_size 2.0,                                             img.shape[1]-filter_  size 2.0+1  :  213   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks               Getting the current region to get multiplied with the filter.

Figure 5-32 shows the feature maps returned by this conv layer. At the end of  this chapter, Listing 5-9 shows the results of all layers discussed in the code.  Figure 5-32.  Output feature maps of the first conv layer  The output of such a layer will be applied to the ReLU layer.   ReLU Layer The ReLU layer applies the ReLU activation function over each feature map returned by  the conv layer. It is called using the relu function according to the following line of code:  l1_feature_map_relu = relu l1_feature_map   The relu function is implemented in Listing 5-5.  Listing 5-5.  ReLU Implementation  def relu feature_map :     Preparing the output of the ReLU activation function.     relu_out = numpy.zeros feature_map.shape      for map_num in range feature_map.shape[-1] :  215   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks          for r in numpy.arange 0,feature_map.shape[0] :             for c in numpy.arange 0, feature_map.shape[1] :                  relu_out[r, c, map_num] = numpy.max [feature_map[r, c, map_  num], 0]       return relu_out  It is very simple. Just loop through each element in the feature map and return the   original value in the feature map if it is larger than 0. Otherwise, return 0. The outputs of  the ReLU layer are shown in Figure 5-33.  Figure 5-33.  ReLU layer output applied to the output of the first conv layer  The output of the ReLU layer is applied to the max pooling layer.   Max Pooling Layer The max pooling layer accepts the output of the ReLU layer and applies the max pooling  operation according to the following line:  l1_feature_map_relu_pool = pooling l1_feature_map_relu, 2, 2   It is implemented using the pooling function according to Listing 5-6.  Listing 5-6.  Max Pooling Implementation  def pooling feature_map, size=2, stride=2 :     Preparing the output of the pooling operation.      pool_out = numpy.zeros  numpy.uint16  feature_map.shape[0]-size+1    stride+1 , numpy.uint16  feature_map.shape[1]-size+1  stride+1 ,  feature_map.shape[-1]    216   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks      for map_num in range feature_map.shape[-1] :         r2 = 0         for r in numpy.arange 0,feature_map.shape[0]-size+1, stride :             c2 = 0             for c in numpy.arange 0, feature_map.shape[1]-size+1, stride :                  pool_out[r2, c2, map_num] = numpy.max [feature_  map[r:r+size,  c:c+size]]                   c2 = c2 + 1             r2 = r2 +1     return pool_out  The function accepts three inputs: the output of the ReLU layer, pooling mask size,  and stride. It simply creates an empty array, as previously, that holds the output of the  layer. The size of the array is specified according to the size and stride arguments, as in  the following line:  pool_out = numpy.zeros  numpy.uint16  feature_map.shape[0]-size+1   stride+1 ,                          numpy.uint16  feature_map.shape[1]-size+1                            feature_map.shape[-1]    stride+1 ,  Then it loops through the input channel by channel according to the outer loop,   which uses the looping variable map_num. For each channel in the input, max pooling  operation is applied. According to the stride and size used, the region is clipped and the  max of it is returned in the output array according to this line:  pool_out[r2, c2, map_num] = numpy.max feature_map[r:r+size,  c:c+size]   The outputs of the pooling layer are shown in Figure 5-34. Note that the size of the  pooling layer output is smaller than its input even if they seem identical in their graphs.  217   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Figure 5-34.  Pooling layer output applied to the output of the first ReLU layer   Stacking Layers Up to this point, the CNN architecture with conv, ReLU, and max pooling layers is  complete. There might be some other layers to be stacked in addition to the previous  ones, as given in Listing 5-7.  Listing 5-7.

That is why there will be three feature maps resulting from the conv layer. This is also  the same for the successive ReLU and pooling layers. Outputs of the layers are shown in  Figure 5-35.  218   Chapter 5    Convolutional neural networks  Figure 5-35.  The output of the second conv-ReLU-pooling layers  The CNN architecture is extended by adding extra conv, ReLU, and pooling layers  according to Listing 5-8. Figure 5-36 shows the outputs of these layers. The conv layer  accepts just a single filter. That is why there is only one feature map as output.  Figure 5-36.

 There are more layers available in CNN, and it is easy to add them to the preceding  layers. For example, a dropout layer could be implemented by dropping a percentage of  the neurons in the last layer. An FC layer is just converting the results of the last layer into  a 1D vector.  Now that the chapter is complete, it is expected that you have good background   information about CNN.  227   CHAPTER 6  TensorFlow Recognition  Application  Building a DL model such as CNN from scratch using NumPy as we did helps us have a  better understanding of how each layer works in detail. For practical applications, it is  not recommended to use such implementation. One reason is that it is computationally  intensive in its calculations and needs efforts to optimize the code. Another is that it does  not support distributed processing, GPUs, and many more features. On the other hand,  there are different already existing libraries that support these features in a time-efficient  manner. These libraries include TF, Keras, Theano, PyTorch, Caffe, and more.  This chapter starts with introducing the TF DL library from scratch by building and  visualizing the computational graph for a simple linear model and a two-class classifier  using ANN. The computational graph is visualized using TensorBoard  TB . Using  TF-Layers API, a CNN model is created to apply the concepts previously discussed for  recognizing images from the CIFAR10 dataset.   Introduction to TF There are different programming paradigms or styles for building software programs.  They include sequential, which builds the programs as a set of sequential lines that  the program follows from the beginning until the end; functional, which organizes the  code into a set of functions that can be called multiple times; imperative, which tells  the computer about every detailed step about how the program works; and more. One  programming language might support different paradigms. But these paradigms have  the disadvantage of being dependent on the language being written in.    Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7_6  229   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Another paradigm is dataflow. Dataflow languages represent their programs as text  instructions that describe computational steps from receiving the data until returning  the results. A dataflow program could be visualized as a graph that shows the operations  in addition to their inputs and outputs. Dataflow languages support parallel processing  because it is much easier to deduce the independent operations that could be executed  at the same time.  The name “TensorFlow” consists of two words. The first is “tensor,” which is the data   unit that TF uses in its computations. The second word is “flow,” reflecting that it uses  the dataflow paradigm. As a result, TF builds a computational graph that consists of  data represented as tensors and the operations applied to them. To make things easier  to understand, just remember that rather than using variables and methods, TF uses  tensors and operations.  Here are some advantages of using dataflow with TF:     Parallelism: It is easier to identify the operations that can be   executed in parallel.     Distributed Execution: The TF program can be partitioned across   multiple devices  CPUs, GPUs, and TF Processing Units [TPUs] .  TF itself handles the necessary work for communication and  cooperation between the devices.     Portability: The dataflow graph is a language-independent   representation of the code of the model. The dataflow graph can be  created using Python, get saved, and then be restored in the C++  program.  TF provides multiple APIs; each supports a different level of control. The lowest-level   API is called TF Core, which gives the programmer the ability to control every piece of  code and have much better control over the created models.  But there are also a number of higher-level APIs in TF that make things easier by just  providing a simple interface for frequently used tasks, such as Estimators, TF-Layers, and  TF-Learn. All higher-level APIs are built on top of TF Core. For example, TF Estimators is  a high-level API in TF that creates models much easier than TF Core.  230   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation   Tensor Tensor is the basic data unit in TF; it is similar to arrays in NumPy. Tensor consists of a  set of primitive data types, such as integer, floating point, character, and string, which are  shaped into an array.  A tensor has both rank and shape. Table 6-1 gives some tensor examples showing   their ranks and shapes.  Table 6-1.  Ranks and Shapes of TF Tensors  Rank  Shape  Tensor  5  [4, 8]  [[3, 1, 7], [1, 5, 2]]  [[[8, 3]], [[11, 9]]]]  0  1  2  2       2    2,2    2,1,2   The rank of a tensor is the number of dimensions. The tensor shape is similar to  NumPy array shape. The NumPy array shape returns the number of elements within  each dimension, and this is how tensor shape works. But tensor rank returns just the  number of dimensions, which is similar to the ndim property of a NumPy array. Tensor  rank is just a scalar value representing the number of dimensions in the tensor, while the  shape is a tuple such as  4, 3  representing an array with two dimensions, where the sizes  of these dimensions are 4 and 3, respectively.  Let’s get started in TF Core.   TF Core In order to create TF Core programs, there are two steps:    1.  Building the computational graph.    2.  Running the computational graph.  TF uses a dataflow graph to represent the computations in the program. After   specifying the sequence of computations, it gets executed within a TF session on local or  remote machines. Assume that Figure 6-1 represents a graph that has four operations, A,  B, C, and D, where the inputs are fed into operation A and then propagated to operation D.    231   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  It is possible for the graph to just execute a selected part of it, and it is not required to  run the complete graph. For example, by specifying that the target of session execution  is operation C, then the program will run until reaching the operation C result only. That  way will not execute operation D. Also, if operation B is the target, then operations C and  D will not get executed.  Figure 6-1.  A graph with four operations  Working with TF Core API requires understanding of how dataflow graphs and  sessions work. Working with high-level APIs such as Estimators hides some of the  overhead from the user. But understanding how graphs and sessions work is useful for  understanding in turn how such high-level APIs are implemented.   Dataflow Graph A dataflow graph consists of nodes and edges. Nodes represent units of operation. Edges  represent inputs to and outputs from an operation node. For example, the method  tensorflow.matmul   accepts two input tensors, multiples them, and returns an output  tensor. The operation itself is represented with a single node connected to two edges,  one for each input tensor. There is also an edge that represents the output tensor. Later,  we will see how to build the computational graph using TB.  A special kind of node is the constant, which accepts zero tensors as input. The   output that the constant node returns is a value stored internally. Listing 6-1 creates a  single constant node of type float32 and prints it.  Listing 6-1.  Constant Node  import tensorflow tensor1 = tensorflow.constant 3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32  print tensor1   232   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  When printing the constant node, the result is  Tensor "Const:0", shape=  , dtype=float32   Based on the output of the print statement, there are three things to note:     The shape is   , which means that the tensor is of rank 0.     The output tensor has a string equal to “Const:0”. This string is the   name of the tensor. The tensor name is an important property because  it is used to retrieve the tensor value from the graph. It is also the  label printed in the TF graph. The default name for constant tensors  is “Const”. The 0 appended to this string defines it as the first output  returned. There are some operations that return more than one  output. The first output is given 0, the second one is given 1, and so on.     The print statement does not print the value 3.7 but prints the node   itself. The value will get printed only after evaluating the nodes.   Tensor Names  There might be multiple constant tensors within the graph. For this reason, TF appends  the string “Const” with a number that identifies the constant among all constants in the  graph. Listing 6-2 gives an example of three constants and prints them.  Listing 6-2.  Creating Three Constants  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32  tensor2 = tensorflow.constant value=[[0.5], [7]], dtype=tensorflow.float32  tensor3 = tensorflow.constant value=[[12, 9]], dtype=tensorflow.float32  print tensor1  print tensor2  print tensor3   Here is the result of the three print statements:  Tensor "Const:0", shape=  , dtype=float32  Tensor "Const_1:0", shape= 2, 1 , dtype=float32  Tensor "Const_2:0", shape= 1, 2 , dtype=float32   233   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  The first tensor name is “Const:0”. To differentiate it from other tensors, the string  “Const” is appended by an underscore and a number. For example, the second tensor  name is “Const_1:0”. The number “1” is the identifier to that constant in the graph. But  we can change the name of a tensor by using the name attribute as in Listing 6-3.  Listing 6-3.  Setting Names of the Tensors Using the Name Attribute  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name"firstConstant"  tensor2 = tensorflow.constant value=[[0.5], [7]], dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name"secondConstant"  tensor3 = tensorflow.constant value=[[12, 9]], dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name"thirdConstant"  print tensor1  print tensor2  print tensor3   The results of the three print statements are as follows:  Tensor "firstConstant:0", shape=  , dtype=float32  Tensor "secondConstant:0", shape= 2, 1 , dtype=float32  Tensor "thirdConstant:0", shape= 1, 2 , dtype=float32   Because each tensor is given a unique name, there are no appended numbers to   the string. If the same value of the name attribute is used for more than one tensor,  the number will be used as in Listing 6-4. The first two tensors are given the value  myConstant and thus the second tensor is appended by a number “1”.  Listing 6-4.  Two Tensors with the Same Value for the Name Attribute  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name”myConstant”  tensor2 = tensorflow.constant value=[[0.5], [7]], dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name”myConstant”   234   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  tensor3 = tensorflow.constant value=[[12, 9]], dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name"thirdConstant"  print tensor1  print tensor2  print tensor3   The results of Listing 6-4 are as follows:  Tensor "myConstant:0", shape=  , dtype=float32  Tensor "myConstant_1:0", shape= 2, 1 , dtype=float32  Tensor "thirdConstant:0", shape= 1, 2 , dtype=float32   In Listing 6-5, the operation tensorflow.nn.top_k is used to return the largest K  values for a vector. In other words, this operation returns multiple values as outputs.  Based on the output string, the two outputs are given the string “TopKV2” but with a  different number after the colon. The first output is given number “0” and the second  output is given “1”.  Listing 6-5.  Operation Returning Multiple Outputs  import tensorflow aa = tensorflow.nn.top_k [1, 2, 3, 4], 2  print aa   The print output is  TopKV2 values= , indices=<tf. Tensor 'TopKV2:1' shape= 2,  dtype=int32>   Up to this point, we have been able to print the tensor but not evaluate its result. Let’s   create a TF session for evaluating the operations.   Creating a TF Session  TF uses the tensorflow.Session class to represent a connection between the client  program  typically a Python program  and the runtime environment. A  tensorflow. Session object provides access to devices in the local machine and to remote devices  using the distributed TF runtime environment. It also caches information about the  tensorflow.Graph so that we can efficiently rerun the same graph. Listing 6-6 creates   235   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  a TF session for evaluating the results of a single constant tensor. The tensor to be  evaluated is assigned to the fetches attribute.  The session is created and returned into a variable named sess. After running the  session using the tensorflow.Session.run   method to evaluate the tensor tensor1,  the result will be 3.7, which is the constant value. This method runs the tensorflow. Operation and evaluates the tensorflow.Tensor. This method could accept more than  one tensor for evaluation by typing them in a list and assigning this list to the fetches  attribute.  Listing 6-6.  Evaluating a Single Constant Tensor  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32  sess = tensorflow.Session   print sess.run fetches=tensor1   sess.close    As the tensorflow.Session owns physical resources such as CPUs, GPUs, and   network connections, it must free these resources after finishing execution. According  to Listing 6-6, we have to manually exit the session using the tensorflow.Session. close   to free resources. There is also another way to create a session, in which it gets  closed automatically. This is by creating it using the with block as in Listing 6-7. When  the session is created within the with block, it will get closed automatically after getting  outside the block.  Listing 6-7.  Creating a Session Using the With Block  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     print sess.run fetches=tensor1    We can also specify more than one tensor in the tensorflow.Session.run   method   to get their outputs, as in Listing 6-8.  236   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Listing 6-8.  Evaluating More Than One Tensor  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32  tensor2 = tensorflow.constant value=[[0.5], [7]], dtype=tensorflow.float32  tensor3 = tensorflow.constant value=[[12, 9]], dtype=tensorflow.float32   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     print sess.run fetches=[tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]    Here are the outputs of the three evaluated tensors.  3.7 array [[ 0.5], [7.]], dtype=float32  array [[ 12.,   9.]], dtype=float32   The previous examples just print the evaluated results for tensors. It is possible to   store such values and reuse them in the program. Listing 6-9 returns the evaluation  results in the results tensor.  Listing 6-9.  Evaluating More Than One Tensor  import tensorflow  node1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32  node2 = tensorflow.constant value=7.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32  node3 = tensorflow.constant value=9.1, dtype=tensorflow.float32   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     results = sess.run fetches=[node1, node2, node3]   vIDX = 0 for value in results:     print "Value ", vIDX, " : ", value      vIDX = vIDX + 1  237   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Because there are three tensors to be evaluated, all three outputs will be stored into  the results tensor, which is a list. Using for loop, we can iterate and print each output  separately. The outputs are as follows:  Value  0  :  3.7 Value  1  :  7.7 Value  2  :  9.1  The previous examples just evaluated the value of constant tensors without applying  any operation. We can apply some operations over such tensors. Listing 6-10 creates two  tensors and adds them together using the tensorflow.add operation. This operation  accepts two tensors and adds them together. Both tensors must have the same data type   i.e., dtype attribute . It returns a new tensor of the same type as the input tensors. Using  the + operator is identical to using the tensorflow.add   method.  Listing 6-10.  Adding Two Tensors Using the tensorflow.add Operation  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.constant value=3.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32  tensor2 = tensorflow.constant value=7.7, dtype=tensorflow.float32   add_op = tensorflow.add tensor1, tensor2   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     add_result = sess.run fetches=[add_op]   print "Result of addition : ", add_result   The output of the print statement is  Result of addition :  [11.4]  In Figure 6-2, the graph of the program in Listing 6-10 is visualized using TB. Note   that all nodes and edges are given labels. These labels are the name of each tensor  and operation. The default values are used. Later in this chapter, we will learn how to  visualize graphs in TB.  238   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Figure 6-2.  Visualization of the graph using TB  The name of the operation is descriptive and reflects its job, but the names of the   tensors are not. We can change them to num1 and num2 and visualize the graph as in  Figure 6-3.  Figure 6-3.  Changing the name of the tensors   Parameterized Graph Using Placeholder  The previous graph is static because it uses constant tensors. It always accepts the same  inputs and generates the same output each time it gets evaluated. To be able to modify  the inputs each time the program runs, we can use tensorflow.placeholder. In other  words, for evaluating the same operation but using different inputs, you should use  tensorflow.placeholder. Note that placeholder can get its value changed only by  rerunning the graph.  The tensorflow.placeholderaccepts three arguments as follows:          dtype: Data type of elements the tensor will accept.  shape  Optional – default None : Shape of the array within the tensor.  If not specified, then you can feed the tensor with any shape.      name  Optional – default None : Name for the operation.  It returns a tensor with these specifications. We can modify the previous example in Listing 6-10 to use tensorflow.placeholder  as in Listing 6-11. When running the session previously, the tensorflow.Session.run    accepts only the operations to be evaluated. When using placeholders, this method  will also accept the initial values of the placeholders in the feed_dict argument. The  feed_dict argument accepts the values as a dictionary that maps the name of each  placeholder to its value.  239   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Listing 6-11.  Parameterized Graph Using a Placeholder  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32, shape=  ,  name="num1"  tensor2 = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32, shape=  ,  name="num2"   add_op = tensorflow.add tensor1, tensor2, name="Add_Op"   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:      add_result = sess.run fetches=[add_op], feed_dict={tensor1: 3.7,   tensor2: 7.7}   print "Result of addition : ", add_result   Assigning the placeholders the same values used by the constants in Listing 6-10, the  same result will be returned. The benefit of using placeholders is that their values can be  changed even within the program, but constants cannot be changed once created. After using a third placeholder and a multiply operation, Listing 6-12 runs the   session multiple times with different values for placeholders. It uses a for loop iterating  through a list of five numbers returned by the range   native Python function. Values of  all tensors are set equal to the list values, one value at each iteration. Values of the first  two tensors are added using the tensorflow.add operation. The result of the addition  is returned into the add_op tensor. Its value is then multiplied by the third tensor using  the tensorflow.multiply operation. The multiplication result is returned in the mul_op  tensor. Using the * operator is identical to using the tensorflow.add   method. The  fetches argument in Listing 6-11 is a set of add_op compared to mul_op in Listing 6-12.  Listing 6-12.  Running the Session for Different Values for the Placeholders  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32, shape=  ,  name="num1"  tensor2 = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32, shape=  ,  name="num2"  tensor3 = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32, shape=  ,  name="num3"   240   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  add_op = tensorflow.add tensor1, tensor2, name="Add_Op"  mul_op = tensorflow.multiply add_op, tensor3, name="Add_Op"   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     for num in range 5 : result = sess.run fetches=[mul_op], feed_dict={tensor1: num, tensor2: num,  tensor3: num}          print "Result at iteration ", num, " : ", result   The output of the print statement is as follows:  Result at iteration  0  :  [0.0] Result at iteration  1  :  [2.0] Result at iteration  2  :  [8.0] Result at iteration  3  :  [18.0] Result at iteration  4  :  [32.0]  A visualization of the previous graph is given in Figure 6-4. Note that all operations   and tensors are renamed. The first two tensors num1 and num2 are connected with the  first operation Add_Op. The result of this operation is used as input, with the third tensor  num3 as input to the second operation Mul_Op.  Figure 6-4.  Visualization of the graph in Listing 6-12 using TB  241   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  The mul_op tensor is selected to be a member of the fetches list in Listing 6-12.   Why not just select just add_op? The answer is that the last tensor in the graph chain is  selected for evaluation. Evaluating mul_op will implicitly evaluate all other tensors in the  graph. If “add_op” is selected for evaluation, then mul_op will not be evaluated because  add_op doesn’t depend on mul_op, and we have nothing to do for evaluating it. But  mul_op is what depends on add_mul and all other tensors. Thus, mul_op is selected for  evaluation. Remember that it is possible to use more than one tensor for evaluation.   TF Variables  Placeholders are used to allocate memory for future use. Their main use is for feeding  input data for a model to get trained with. If the same operation is to be applied for  different input data, then place the input data into a placeholder and run the session by  assigning different values to the placeholder.  Placeholders are not initialized and their value is assigned only during runtime;  in other words, only after calling the tensorflow.Session.run   are the placeholders  assigned values. A placeholder allows the creation of an unconstrained shape tensor,  which makes it suitable for use to hold the training data.  Suppose that you want to assign the training data to the placeholder and you just   know that each sample gets described by 35 features. We have not decided yet how many  samples to use for training. We can create a placeholder that accepts a tensor with an  unspecified number of samples but a specific number of features  columns  per sample  as follows:  data_tensor = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float16,   shape=[None, 35]   The placeholder just accepts the value and cannot get changed after being assigned.   Remember that in Listing 6-12 we changed the value of the placeholders only by  rebuilding the graph with the new values. In the same graph, it is not possible to change  the placeholder value.  ML models have a number of trainable parameters that are changed multiple times  until reaching their best values. How do we allow a tensor to change its values multiple  times? This is not provided by constants and placeholders, but by variables  tensorflow. Variable   .  TF variables are identical to the normal variables used in other languages. They  are assigned initial values, and such a value can be updated during the execution of   242   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  the program based on the operations applied to it. A placeholder doesn’t allow data  modifications once assigned during execution time.  Constant tensors have their values initialized once the tensorflow.constant   is called,   but variables won’t be initialized after calling tensorflow.Variable  . There is an easy way  to initialize all global variables within the program by running the tensorflow.global_ variables_initializer   operation within the session. Note that initializing the variable  does not mean it is evaluated. The variable needs to be evaluated after being initialized.  Listing 6-13 gives an example of creating a single variable named “Var1” where its value  is initialized, then the variable is evaluated, and finally, its value is printed.  Listing 6-13.  Creating, Initializing, and Evaluating the Variable  import tensorflow  var1 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=5.8, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="Var1"   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     init = tensorflow.global_variables_initializer       sess.run fetches=init      var_value = sess.run fetches=var1      print "Variable value : ", var_value   The print statement will return:  Variable value :5.8  Note that there are two runs to the session: the first for initializing all variables and   the second for evaluating the variable. Remember that placeholder is a function but  variable is a class, and thus its name starts with uppercase.  Variables can be initialized by a tensor of any type and shape. The type and shape of  this tensor will define the type and shape of the variable, which cannot be changed. The  variable value can be changed. Working with a distributed environment, variables can be  stored once and get shared across all devices. They have a state that helps in debugging.  Moreover, the variable value can be saved and restored when required.  243   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation   Variable Initialization  There are different ways to initialize a variable. All variable initialization methods have  can set both the shape and data type of the variable. One way is by using the initial value  of a previously initialized variable. For example, the variable named “Var1” in Listing 6-13   is initialized by a rank 0 tensor of value 5.8. This initialized variable can be used to  initialize other variables. Note that the initial value of a variable can be returned using  the initialized_value   method of the tensorflow.Variable class. The initial value can  be assigned to another variable as in the following. The variable “var3” is initialized by  multiplying the initial value of “var1” by 5.  var2 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=var1.initialized_value  ,  dtype=tensorflow.float32  var3 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=var1.initialized_value  *5,  dtype=tensorflow.float32   A variable can be initialized based on another tensor created by one of the build-  in operations in TF. There are different operations to generate tensors, including the  following:  tensorflow.lin_space start, stop, num, name=None   tensorflow.range start, limit=None, delta=1, dtype=None,  name='range'   tensorflow.zeros shape, dtype=tf.float32, name=None   tensorflow.ones shape, dtype=tf.float32, name=None                       tensorflow.constant value, dtype=None, shape=None, name='Const',  verify_shape=False   They have the same meaning as their corresponding methods in NumPy. All of   these operations return the tensor of the specified data type and shape. For example, we  can create a tensorflow.Variable   whose values are initialized using tensorflow.zeros  ,  which returns a 1D row vector with 12 elements as follows:  var1 = tensorflow.Variable tensorflow.zeros [12]    244   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation   Graph Visualization Using TB TF is designed to work with deep models trained with large amounts of data. TF supports  a suite of visualization tools called TB to help to optimize and to debug TF programs  easier. The computational dataflow graph is visualized as a set of nodes representing the  operations, which are connected together with edges representing the input and output  tensors.  Here are the summarized steps for visualizing a simple graph using TB:    1.  Build the dataflow graph.    2.  Write the graph in a directory using tensorflow.summary.  FileWriter.    3.  Launch TB within the directory of the saved graph.    4.  Access TB from a web browser.    5.  Visualize the graph.  Let’s use the code in Listing 6-14 for visualization. This code creates six variables that  are fed into nine operations. After writing the instructions for building the graph, next is  to save it using FileWriter. The tensorflow.summary.FileWriter   constructor accepts two  important arguments: “graph” and “logdir”. The “graph” argument accepts the session  graph, which is returned by “sess.graph” assuming that the session variable is named  “sess”. The graph is exported into the directory specified using the “logdir” argument.  Change the “logdir” to match your system. Note that we do not have to initialize the  variables nor run the session because our target is not to execute the graph but just to  visualize it.  Listing 6-14.  Saving Dataflow Graph for Visualization Using TB  import tensorflow  tensor1 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=4, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="Var1"  tensor2 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=15, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="Var2"  tensor3 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=-2, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="Var3"   245   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  tensor4 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=1.8, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="Var4"  tensor5 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=14, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="Var5"  tensor6 = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=8, dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="Var6"   op1 = tensorflow.add x=tensor1, y=tensor2, name="Add_Op1"  op2 = tensorflow.subtract x=op1, y=tensor1, name="Subt_Op1"  op3 = tensorflow.divide x=op2, y=tensor3, name="Divide_Op1"  op4 = tensorflow.multiply x=op3, y=tensor4, name="Mul_Op1"  op5 = tensorflow.multiply x=op4, y=op1, name="Mul_Op2"  op6 = tensorflow.add x=op5, y=2, name="Add_Op2"  op7 = tensorflow.subtract x=op6, y=op2, name="Subt_Op2"  op8 = tensorflow.multiply x=op7, y=tensor6, name="Mul_Op3"  op9 = tensorflow.multiply x=op8, y=tensor5, name="Mul_Op4"   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     writer = tensorflow.summary.FileWriter logdir="\\AhmedGad\\ TensorBoard\\", graph=sess.graph      writer.close    After exporting the graph, the next step is to launch TB to access the graph.  Launching TB differs a bit based on whether TF is installed in a separate virtual  environment  venv  or as a regular library within the site-packages directory.  If it is installed into a venv, then TF must be activated using the activate.bat file   located under the Scripts directory of the Python installation. Assuming that the Scripts  directory is added to either the user or system PATH variable environment and the  venv folder is named “tensorflow”, then TF will be activated according to the following  command:  After activating TF, next is to launch TB into the directory at which the graph is saved   activate tensorflow  according to this command:  tensorBoard --logdir=\\AhmedGad\\TensorBoard\\  246   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  In case the TF is installed within the site-packages directory, then it can be activated   by issuing this command:  python -m tensorboard.main --logdir="\\AhmedGad\\TensorBoard\\"  This will activate TB, and we will then be ready to visualize the graph by navigating to  “http:  localhost:6006” from a web browser. The graph is shown in Figure 6-5. It is easier  to debug the graph in this case. For example, an isolated node that is not connected to  any other node of the graph is easily detected in the graph than the code.  Figure 6-5.  Visualization of a dataflow graph using TB  247    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Chapter 6   Linear Model A linear model has the general form in Equation 6-1. There are n input variables xn, and  each variable is assigned a weight wn for a total of n weights. A bias b is added to the SOP  of each input and its corresponding bias.     y = w1x1+w2x2+…+wnxn+b    Equation 6-1   For a simple linear model, there are input data, weights, and biases. Which is   the most suitable option between placeholders and variables to hold each of these?  Generally, the placeholder is used when applying the same operation multiple times  over different inputs. The inputs will be assigned for the placeholder one by one and  the operation will get applied to each one. Variables are used for storing trainable  parameters. As a result, the input data is to be assigned to a placeholder, but weights and  biases are stored in variables. Remember to use tensorflow.global_variables_initializer    for initializing the variables.  The code that prepares the placeholder and the two variables is given in Listing 6-15.  The input samples have just one input x1 and one output y. The placeholder “data_input_ placeholder” represents the input, and the placeholder “data_output_placeholder”  represents the output.  Because there is only one input variable per sample, there will be a single weight w1.  The weight is represented as the “weight_variable” variable and assigned an initial value  of 0.2. The bias, represented as the “bias_variable” variable, is assigned an initial value  of 0.1. Note that the placeholder is assigned a value inside the tensorflow.Session.run    method using the “feed_dict” argument. The input placeholder is assigned 2.0 and the  output placeholder is assigned 5.0. The visualization of the graph is in Figure 6-6.  Note that the “fetches” argument of the run   method is set to a list of three elements:   “loss”, “error”, and “output”. The “loss” tensor representing the loss function is fetched  because it is the target tensor in the graph. All other tensors will be evaluated once it is  evaluated. The “error” and “output” tensors are fetched just to print the prediction error  in addition to the predicted output as in the print statement at the end of the code. Note the difference between the tensors “error” and “loss”. The “error” tensor   calculates the square error between the predicted and desired outputs for each sample.  To just summarize all errors in a single value, the tensor “loss” is used. It calculates the  summation of all square errors.  248   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Listing 6-15.  Preparing Inputs, Weight, and Bias for a Linear Model  import tensorflow  data_input_placeholder = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="DataInput"  data_output_placeholder = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="DataOutput"  weight_variable = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=0.1, dtype=tensorflow. float32, name="Weight"  bias_variable = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=0.2, dtype=tensorflow. float32, name="Bias"   output = tensorflow.multiply x=data_input_placeholder, y=weight_variable  output = tensorflow.add x=output, y=bias_variable   diff = tensorflow.subtract x=output, y=data_output_placeholder,  name="Diff"  error = tensorflow.square x=diff, name="PredictError"  loss = tensorflow.reduce_sum input_tensor=error, name="Loss"   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:      writer = tensorflow.summary.FileWriter logdir="\\AhmedGad\\  TensorBoard\\", graph=sess.graph       init = tensorflow.global_variables_initializer        sess.run fetches=init  loss, predict_error, predicted_output = sess.run fetches=[loss, error,  output], feed_dict={data_input_placeholder: 2.0,data_output_placeholder:  5.0}       print "Loss : ", loss, "\nPredicted output : ", predicted_output,"\  nPrediction error : ", predict_error       writer.close    Based on the values assigned to the placeholders and the variables, the output of the   print message is as follows:  Loss :  21.16 Predicted output :  0.4 Prediction error :  21.16  249   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  The predicted output is 0.4 and the desired output is 5.0. There is an error equal to  21.16. There is only one value returned in the fetched tensors because the program is  working with just one sample. Also, the loss value is equal to the error value because  there is just one sample. We can run the program for multiple samples.  Figure 6-6.  Visualization of a dataflow graph of a linear model with one input  Rather than assigning just a single value to the placeholder “data_input_placeholder”,   we can assign multiple values enclosed in a list. This also applies to the “data_output_ placeholder” placeholder. Note that they must have identical shapes. The modified  program after using two samples is in Listing 6-16. The print message is as follows:  Loss :  51.41 Predicted output :  [ 0.4  0.5] Prediction error :  [21.16  30.25]  250   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  This means the prediction errors are 21.16 and 30.25 for the first and second   samples, respectively. The sum of all square errors is 51.41. Because there is a high value  for the loss function, we have to update the parameters  weights and bias  in order to  minimize the prediction error.  Listing 6-16.  Running the TF Program for Multiple Samples  import tensorflow  data_input_placeholder = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="DataInput"  data_output_placeholder = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="DataOutput"  weight_variable = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=0.1, dtype=tensorflow. float32, name="Weight"  bias_variable = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=0.2, dtype=tensorflow. float32, name="Bias"   output = tensorflow.multiply x=data_input_placeholder, y=weight_variable  output = tensorflow.add x=output, y=bias_variable   diff = tensorflow.subtract x=output, y=data_output_placeholder,  name="Diff"  error = tensorflow.square x=diff, name="PredictError"  loss = tensorflow.reduce_sum input_tensor=error, name="Loss"   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:     init = tensorflow.global_variables_initializer       sess.run fetches=init  loss, predict_error, predicted_output = sess.run fetches=[loss, error,  output], feed_dict={data_input_placeholder: [2.0, 3.0],data_output_ placeholder: [5.0, 6.0]}       print "Loss : ", loss, "\nPredicted output : ", predicted_output,   "\nPrediction error : ", predict_error   Currently, there is no way to update the parameters. A number of optimizers already   exist in TF for doing that job.  251   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation   GD Optimizer from TF Train API  There are a number of optimizers that TF provides for optimizing model parameters  automatically. GD is an example that changes the values of each parameter slowly until  reaching the value that minimizes the loss. GD modifies each variable according to the  magnitude of the derivative of loss with respect to the variable. This is identical to what is  discussed in Chapter 3 in the backward pass of training ANN. The “tensorflow.train” API  has a class called “GradientDescentOptimizer” that can both calculate the derivatives  and optimize the parameters. The program after using “GradientDescentOptimizer” is in  Listing 6-17.  Listing 6-17.  Using GD for Optimizing the Model Parameters  import tensorflow  data_input_placeholder = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="DataInput"  data_output_placeholder = tensorflow.placeholder dtype=tensorflow.float32,  name="DataOutput"  weight_variable = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=0.1, dtype=tensorflow. float32, name="Weight"  bias_variable = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=0.2, dtype=tensorflow. float32, name="Bias"   output = tensorflow.multiply x=data_input_placeholder, y=weight_variable,  name="Multiply"  output = tensorflow.add x=output, y=bias_variable, name="Add"   diff = tensorflow.subtract x=output, y=data_output_placeholder,  name="Diff"  error = tensorflow.square x=diff, name="PredictError"  loss = tensorflow.reduce_sum input_tensor=error, name="Loss"  train_optim = tensorflow.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate=0.01,  name="Optimizer"  minimizer = train_optim.minimize loss=loss, name="Minimizer"   with tensorflow.Session   as sess:  252   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation       writer = tensorflow.summary.FileWriter graph=sess.graph, logdir=   "\\AhmedGad\\TensorBoard\\"       init = tensorflow.global_variables_initializer       sess.run fetches=init      for k in range 1000 :          _, data_loss, predict_error, predicted_output = sess.  run fetches=[minimizer,loss, error, output], feed_dict={data_input_ placeholder: [1.0, 2.0],data_output_placeholder: [5.0, 6.0]}        print "Loss : ", data_loss,"\nPredicted output : ", predicted_output,   "\nPrediction error : ", predict_error       writer.close    The program uses a loop that iterates through 1,000 iterations. For each iteration, the   current parameters are used for predicting the outputs, the loss is calculated, and the  GD optimizer updates the parameters to minimize the loss. Note that the “minimize  ”  operation returns an operation that minimizes the loss.  After the end of the iterations, the print statement is executed. Here are its outputs:  Loss :  0.00323573 Predicted output :  [ 4.951612    6.02990532] Prediction error :  [ 0.0023414   0.00089433]  Thanks to GD, the loss is reduced from 51.41 to just 0.0032. The graph of the previous   program in Listing 6-17 is available in Figure 6-7.  253   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Figure 6-7.  Dataflow graph of a linear model optimized using GD   Locating Parameters to Optimize  An important question now arises: How does the optimizer know the parameters to  change their values? Let’s see how it knows that.  After running the session, the “minimizer” operation will be executed. TF will follow   the chain of graph nodes to evaluate such an operation. TF found that the “minimizer”  operation depends on a single argument, which is the “loss” tensor. Thus, our goal is   254   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  to minimize the value of such a tensor. How can we minimize that tensor? We have to  follow the graph back.  The “loss” tensor is evaluated using the “tensorflow.reduce_sum  ” operation. As a   result, our goal is to minimize the result of the “tensorflow.reduce_sum  ” operation.  Stepping back, this operation is evaluated using the “error” tensor. As a result,   our goal now is to minimize the “error” tensor. Stepping back again, we find that the  “error” tensor depends on the “tensorflow.square  ” operation. As a result, we have to  minimize “tensorflow.square  ” the operation. The input tensor to this operation is the  “diff” tensor. Thus, our goal is to minimize the “diff” tensor. Because the “diff” tensor  is the result of the “tensorflow.subtract  ” operation, then our goal is to minimize this  operation.  Minimizing the “tensorflow.subtract  ” asks us to minimize its input tensors, which   are “output” and “data_output_placeholder”. Looking at these two tensors, which one  can be modified? Only the variable tensors can be modified. Because “data_output_ placeholder” is not a variable but a placeholder, we can’t modify it. Thus, we have only  the “output” tensor to minimize in order to minimize the result.  The “output” tensor is calculated according to Equation 6-1. It has three inputs:   input, weight, and bias, which are represented by the tensors “data_input_placeholder”,  “weight_variable”, and “bias_variable”, respectively. Looking for these three tensors,  only “weight_variable” and “bias_variable” can be changed because they are variables.  Thus, finally we know that our goal is to minimize “weight_variable” and “bias_variable”  tensors.  In order to minimize the “tensorflow.train.GradientDescentOptimizer.minimize  ”   operation, we have to change the values of the “weight_variable” and “bias_variable”  tensors. This is how TF deduced that to minimize the loss it should minimize the weight  and bias parameters.   Building FFNN In this section, two basic feed-forward ANNs  FFNNs  will be created for classification  using TF Core API. We will follow the same steps used previously to build an ANN using  NumPy but with changes.  255   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  The summarized steps are as follows:    1.  Reading the training data  inputs and outputs .    2.  Building the neural network layers and preparing their parameters    weights, biases, and activation functions .    3.  Building a loss function to assess the prediction error.    4.  Create a training loop for training the network and updating its     5.  Assessing the accuracy of the trained ANN using new unseen test   parameters.  data.  We will start by building a single-layer FFANN.   Linear Classification Table 6-2 gives the data of the first classification problem. It is a binary classification  problem to classify the RGB colors into either red or blue based on the color channels  red, green, and blue.  Table 6-2.  RGB Color Classification Problem  Class  Red  Blue  Red  255  248  0  67  Green  0  80  9  15  Blue  0  68  255  210  According to Listing 6-18, two placeholders  “training_inputs” and “training_  outputs”  are created for holding the training data inputs and outputs. Their data type is  set to “float32” but they do not have a specific shape. The shape of the “training_inputs”  placeholder is N×3. What does that mean?  Regularly, placeholders are used to hold the training data of the model. The size of   the training data is not always fixed. There might be a change in the number of samples,  the number of features, or both. For example, we might train a model with 100 samples,   256   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  where each sample is represented by 15 features. The shape of the placeholder, in this  case, is 100×15. Assume that we later decided to change the number of training samples  to be 50. The shape of the placeholder must get changed to be 50×15.  Listing 6-18.  Placeholders for the Training Data Inputs and Outputs  import tensorflow training_inputs = tensorflow.placeholder shape=[None, 3], dtype=tensorflow. float32  training_outputs = tensorflow.placeholder shape=[None, 1],  dtype=tensorflow.float32   To make life easier, TF supports creating placeholders of variable shape. The   placeholder shape is determined based on the data assigned to it. The shape might be  variable across all dimensions or for just some dimensions. If we decided to use 30 features  but had not decided on the number of training samples, then the shape is N×15, where N  is the number of samples. Feeding 20 samples to the placeholder, N will be set to 20. This  is the case for the two placeholders in Listing 6-18. To leave the placeholder generic for  holding any number of training samples, its shape is set to  None, 3 . None means that this  dimension  representing the number of samples  does not have a static size.  After preparing the inputs and the outputs, the next step is to decide the network   architecture for preparing their parameters  weights and bias . Because the data is  simple, we could plot it. Listing 6-19 gives the code used to plot the data. Note that the  data has three dimensions, and thus the plot is 3D as in Figure 6-8.  Listing 6-19.  3D Scatter Plot of the Training Data  import matplotlib.pyplot import mpl_toolkits.mplot3d  figure3D = matplotlib.pyplot.figure   axis3D = mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.Axes3D figure3D   red = [255, 248, 0, 67] green = [0, 80, 9, 15] blue = [0, 68, 255, 210]  axis3D.scatter red, green, blue, color="black"  axis3D.set_xlabel xlabel="Red"   257   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  axis3D.set_ylabel ylabel="Green"  axis3D.set_zlabel zlabel="Blue"  matplotlib.pyplot.show    Figure 6-8.  3D scatter plot of the training data  Based on Figure 6-8, it is obvious that the two classes can be separated linearly. The  two samples of the class red are located on the right of the plot, and the blue samples are  on the left. Knowing it is a linear problem guides us to not use any hidden layer. Thus,  the network architecture will just have input and output layers. Because each sample is  represented using three features, then the input layer will have just three inputs, one for  each feature. The network architecture is in Figure 6-9, where X0 = 1.0 is the bias input  and W0 is the bias. W1, W2, and W3 are the weights for the three inputs R  Red , G  Green ,  and B  Blue .  258   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Figure 6-9.  ANN architecture for classifying RGB colors linearly  Listing 6-20 prepares the variables holding these parameters. Because there are   three inputs and each input has a weight, the shape of the weights is 3×1 according to the  “weights” variable. The shape is 3×1 to make matrix multiplication between the inputs  and the weights valid. The input data of shape N×3 could be multiplied by the weights  of shape 3×1, and the result will be N×1. There is just one bias according to the “bias”  variable.  Listing 6-20.  Preparing ANN Parameter Variables  import tensorflow weights = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=[[0.003], [0.001], [0.008]],  dtype=tensorflow.float32  bias = tensorflow.Variable initial_value=[0.001], dtype=tensorflow.float32   After preparing the data, network architecture, and the parameters, next is to feed   the training input data into the network, predict their outputs, and calculate the loss  according to Listing 6-21. The input data matrix is multiplied by the weights vector  using the “matmul  ” operation and the result is stored in the “sop” tensor. According  to Equation 6-1, the result of the multiplication is added to the bias. The result of the  addition is stored in the “sop_bias” tensor. The result is then applied to the sigmoid  function defined by the “tensorflow.nn.sigmoid  ” operation and returned into the  “predictions” tensor.  259   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Listing 6-21.  Using the Network Parameters to Predict the Outputs of the  Training Data  import tensorflow sop = tensorflow.matmul a=training_inputs, b=weights, name="SOPs"  sop_bias = tensorflow.add x=sop, y=bias  predictions = tensorflow.nn.sigmoid x=sop_bias, name="Sigmoid"   error = tensorflow.subtract x=training_outputs, y=predictions,  name="Error"  square_error = tensorflow.square x=error, name="SquareError"  loss = tensorflow.reduce_sum square_error, name="Loss"   train_optim = tensorflow.train.GradientDescentOptimizer learning_rate=0.05,  name="GradientDescent"  minimizer = train_op.minimize loss, name="Minimizer"   After predicting the outputs, next is to measure the loss. At first, the difference   between the predicted and the correct outputs are calculated using the “subtract  ”  operation, and the result is stored in the “error” tensor. The square of that error is then  calculated using the “square” tensor and the result is stored into the “square_error”  tensor. Finally, the squared errors are reduced into a single value by summing them all.  The result is stored into the “loss” tensor.  The loss is calculated to learn how we far we currently are from the optimal results   where the loss is 0. Based on the loss, the GD optimizer is initialized in the “train_optim”  tensor to update the network parameters in order to minimize the loss. The update  operation is returned into the “minimizer” tensor.  Up to this point, the network architecture is complete and ready for training using   the input and output data. Two Python lists are created in Listing 6-22 to hold the  training data inputs and outputs. Note that the red class label is “1.0” and the blue one is  “0.0”. The lists are assigned to the placeholders “training_inputs” and “training_outputs”  using the “feed_dict” argument inside the “tensorflow.Session.run  ” operation. Note  that the target of execution is the “minimizer” operation. The session goes through a  number of iterations to update the ANN parameters.  260   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Listing 6-22.

Figure 6-10 visualizes the graph created in Listing 6-23.  Figure 6-10.  Graph of ANN with a single layer  264   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation   Nonlinear Classification Now we are going to build an ANN that simulates the operation of an XOR gate with two  inputs. The truth table for the problem is in Table 6-3. Because the problem is simple,  we can plot it as in Figure 6-11 to know whether the classes are linearly or nonlinearly  separable.  Table 6-3.  The Truth Table of Two-Input XOR Gate  Output  1  0  A  1  0  0  1  B  0  1  0  1  Based on the graph, it is obvious that the classes are nonlinearly separable. Thus, we   have to use hidden layers. According to the first example in section Designing ANN of  Chapter 3, we know that just a single hidden layer with two neurons is sufficient.  Figure 6-11.  Graph of two-input XOR gate  265   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  The network architecture is in Figure 6-12. That hidden layer accepts the inputs from  the input layer. Based on its weights and biases, its two activation functions will produce  two outputs. The outputs of the hidden layer will be regarded as the inputs to the output  layer. Using its activation function, the output layer produces the final expected class of  the input sample.  Figure 6-12.  Network architecture for XOR gate with two inputs  The complete code is in Listing 6-24. There are some changes compared to the   previous example. The initial parameters are randomly generated using “tensorflow. truncated_normal  ” operation. The output tensor of the hidden layer “hidden_sigmoid”  is used as input to the output layer. The output tensor of the output layer is the predicted  outputs. The remaining code is similar to the previous example.  Listing 6-24.

Graph of ANN simulating XOR gate with two inputs   CIFAR10 Recognition Using CNN The previous examples we discussed help us learn the basics of TF and build good  knowledge. This section extends this knowledge by using TF to build a CNN to recognize  images from the CIFAR10 dataset.  270   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation   Preparing Training Data The binary data of the CIFAR10 dataset is available for download for Python from this  page: www.cs.toronto.edu ~kriz cifar.html. The dataset has 60,000 images split  into training and testing sets. There are five binary files containing the training data,  where each file has 10,000 images. The images are RGB of size 32×32×3. The training  files are named “data_batch_1”, “data_batch_2”, and so on. There is a single file for the  test data named “test_batch” with 10,000 images. A metadata file named “batches.meta”  is available, giving details about the dataset such as the class labels, which are airplane,  automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  Because each file in the dataset is binary, we have to decode it in order to retrieve  the actual image data. To do this job, a function called “unpickle_patch” is created, as  defined in Listing 6-25.  Listing 6-25.  Decoding the CIFAR10 Binary Data  def unpickle_patch file :     patch_bin_file = open file, 'rb' Reading the binary file.      patch_dict = pickle.load patch_bin_file, encoding='bytes' Loading the   details of the binary file into a dictionary.      return patch_dictReturning the dictionary.  The method accepts the binary file path and returns the details about this file into  the “patch_dict” dictionary. The dictionary has the image data for all 10,000 samples  within the file in addition to their class labels.  There are five training data files. In order to decode the entire training data, a new   function called “get_dataset_images” is created as in Listing 6-26. That function accepts  the dataset path and decodes the data of just the five training files. Firstly, it lists all files  under the dataset directory using the “os.listdir  ” function. All file names are returned  into the “files_names” list.  Because all train and test files are located within the same directory, this function  filters the files under this path to just return the training files. The function uses an “if”  statement to just return files starting with “data_batch_” as it is discriminative to the train  file names. Note that the test data is prepared later after building and training the CNN.  271   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Listing 6-26.  Decoding All Training Files  def get_dataset_images dataset_path, im_dim=32, num_channels=3 :     num_files = 5Number of training binary files in the CIFAR10 dataset.     images_per_file = 10000Number of samples within each binary file.      files_names = os.listdir patches_dir Listing the binary files in the   dataset path.  im_dim, num_channels    dtype=numpy.uint8   processed.       dataset_array = numpy.zeros shape= num_files * images_per_file, im_dim,        dataset_labels = numpy.zeros shape= num_files * images_per_file ,        index = 0Index variable to count number of training binary files being       for file_name in files_names:         if file_name[0:len file_name  - 1] == "data_batch_":             print "Working on : ", file_name              data_dict = unpickle_patch dataset_path+file_name               images_data = data_dict[b"data"]              Reshaping all samples in the current binary file to be of   32x32x3 shape.               images_data_reshaped = numpy.reshape images_data,   newshape= len images_data , im_dim, im_dim, num_channels                Appending the data of the current file after being reshaped.              dataset_array[index * images_per_file: index + 1  * images_per_  file, :, :, :] = images_data_reshaped              Appending the labels of the current file.              dataset_labels[index * images_per_file: index + 1  * images_  per_file] = data_dict[b"labels"]               index = index + 1Incrementing the counter of the processed   training files by 1 to accept new file.       return dataset_array, dataset_labelsReturning the training input data   and output labels.  272   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Each training file is decoded by calling the “unpickle_patch” function, and its   image data and their labels are returned into the “data_dict” dictionary. There are five  training files, and thus there are five classes to such a function, where each call returns a  dictionary.  Based on the dictionary returned by this function, the “get_dataset_images” function  concatenates the details  image data and class labels  of all files into a NumPy array. The  image data could be retrieved from that dictionary using the “data” key and stored into  the “dataset_array” NumPy array, which stores all decoded images across all training  files. Class labels are retrieved using the “labels” key and returned into the “dataset_ labels” NumPy array, which stores all labels across all images in the training data. The  “dataset_array” and “dataset_labels” are returned by the function.  When decoded, the data of each image returns as a 1D vector of length   32×32×3=3,072 pixels. This vector should be reshaped of the original shape with three  dimensions. This is because CNN layers created in TF accepts the images of this shape.  For this reason, the “get_dataset_images” function has arguments for accepting the  size of each dimension for the dataset images. The first one is “im_dim” representing  the number of rows columns  they are equal  in addition to the “num_channels”  representing the number of channels.  After preparing the training data, we can build and train the CNN model using TF.   Building the CNN The dataflow graph of the CNN is created inside a function called “create_CNN” as in  Listing 6-27. It creates a stack of convolution  conv , ReLU, max pooling, dropout, and FC  layers. The architecture of the CNN is illustrated in Figure 6-14. It has three conv-relu-  pool groups followed by a dropout layer and finally two FC layers.  Figure 6-14.  CNN architecture  273   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  The function returns the results of the last FC layer. As regularly, the output of   each layer is the input to the next layer. This requires consistency between the sizes of  the outputs and inputs of neighboring layers. Note that for each conv, ReLU, and max  pooling layer, there are some parameters to get specified, such as strides across each  dimension and padding.  Listing 6-27.

The first layer in the CNN works directly on the input data. Thus, the “create_CNN”   function accepts the input data as an input argument called “input_data”. This data is  what returned by the “get_dataset_images” function. The first layer is a convolution layer,  which is created using the “create_conv_layer” function according to Listing 6-28.  The “create_conv_layer” function accepts the input data, filter size, and the number   of filters. It returns the result of convolving the input data with the set of filters. The filters  in the set have their depth set according to the number of channels of the input data.  Because the number of channels is the last element in a NumPy array, index –1 is used to  return the number of channels. The set of filters are returned into the “filters” variable.  Listing 6-28.  Building Convolution Layer  def create_conv_layer input_data, filter_size, num_filters :      filters = tensorflow.Variable tensorflow.truncated_  normal shape= filter_size, filter_size, tensorflow.cast input_data. shape[-1], dtype=tensorflow.int32 , num_filters , stddev=0.05        conv_layer = tensorflow.nn.conv2d input=input_data,                                       filter=filters,                                       strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],                                       padding="VALID"       return filters, conv_layerReturning the filters and the convolution   layer result.  The convolution layer is built by specifying the input data, filters, and strides along   each of the four dimensions, and the padding to the “tensorflow.nn.conv2D” operation.  A padding value of “VALID” means that some borders of the input image will be lost in  the result, based on the filter size.  275   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  The result of any conv layer is fed into a ReLU layer created using the “tensorflow. nn.relu” operation. It accepts the conv layer output and returns a tensor of the same  number of features after applying the ReLU activation function. Remember that  activation functions help to create a nonlinear relationship between the inputs and the  outputs. The result of the ReLU layer is then fed to a max pooling layer created using  the “tensorflow.nn.max_pool” operation. Remember that the goal of pooling layers is to  make the recognition translation invariant.  The “create_CNN” function accepts an argument named “keep_prop” representing  the probability of keeping neurons in the dropout layer, which helps to avoid overfitting.  The dropout layer is implemented using the “dropout_flatten_layer” function, as in Listing  6-29. This function returns a flattened array that is used as the input to the FC layers.  Listing 6-29.  Building Dropout Layer  def dropout_flatten_layer previous_layer, keep_prop :     dropout = tensorflow.nn.dropout x=previous_layer, keep_prob=keep_prop      num_features = dropout.get_shape  [1:].num_elements        layer = tensorflow.reshape previous_layer, shape= -1, num_  features  Flattening the results.      return layer  Because the last FC layer should have a number of output neurons equal to the   number of dataset classes, the number of dataset classes is used as another input  argument named “num_classes” to the “create_CNN” function. The FC layer is created  using the “fc_layer” function, defined according to Listing 6-30. This function accepts  the flattened result of the dropout layer, the number of features in the flattened result,  and the number of output neurons from the FC layer. Based on the number of inputs  and outputs, a tensor named “fc_weights” represents the weights for the FC layer that is  created. It gets multiplied by the flattened layer to get the returned result of the FC layer.  Listing 6-30.  Building FC Layer  def fc_layer flattened_layer, num_inputs, num_outputs :      fc_weights = tensorflow.Variable tensorflow.truncated_ normal shape= num_inputs, num_outputs , stddev=0.05    276   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation      fc_result1 = tensorflow.matmul flattened_layer, fc_weights       return fc_result1Output of the FC layer  result of matrix   multiplication .  The computational graph after being visualized using TB is shown in Figure 6-15.  Part a gives the architecture of the CNN until the final max pooling layer, while part b  shows the remaining steps.

Graph of the CNN used to classify the CIFAR10 dataset  277    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Chapter 6   Training CNN After building the computational graph of the CNN, next is to train it against the  previously prepared training data. The training is done according to Listing 6-31. The  code starts by preparing the path of the dataset and the data placeholders. Note that  the path should be changed to be suitable for your system. Then it calls the previously  discussed functions. The predictions of the trained CNN are used to measure the cost of  the network, which is to be minimized using the GD optimizer. Some of the tensors have  descriptive names to make it easier to retrieve them later when testing the CNN.  Listing 6-31.  Training CNN  Number of classes in the dataset.

Test data preparation is similar to what happened with the  training data except that there is just a single binary file to be decoded. The test file is  decoded according to the modified “get_dataset_images” function according to Listing  6-35. Note that it has the same name as the function used to decode the training data  because it is assumed that there are two separate scripts, one for training and another  for testing. This function calls the “unpickle_patch” function exactly as done before with  training data.  292   Chapter 6    tensorFlow reCognition appliCation  Listing 6-35.

After preparing the test data and restoring the trained model, we can start testing  the model according to Listing 6-36. It’s worth mentioning that when training the CNN,  the session runs to minimize the cost. In testing, we are not interested in minimizing  the cost anymore and just we would like to return the predictions for the data samples.  This is why the TF session runs to return just the predictions by fetching the “softmax_ propabilities” and “softmax_predictions” tensors.  When the graph is restored, the tensor named “data_tensor” in the training phase   will be assigned the testing data, while the tensor named “label_tensor” will be assigned  the sample labels.  Another interesting point is that the keep probability “keep_prop” of the dropout  layer is now set to 1.0. That means do not drop any neuron  i.e., use all neurons . This  is because we are just using the pretrained model after settling on what neurons to  drop. Now we just use what the model did before and are not interested in making any  modifications.

In order to benefit from the created models, users should remotely access them.  Users’ feedback will help improve the model performance.  This chapter discusses how to deploy pretrained models online to be accessed by  Internet users. Using Flask micro web framework, a web application is created using  Python. Using HTML  HyperText Markup Language , CSS  Cascading Style Sheet ,  and JavaScript, simple web pages are built to allow the user to send and receive HTTP   HyperText Transfer Protocol  requests to the server. Using a web browser, the user  accesses the application and is able to upload an image to the server. Based on the  deployed model, the image is classified and its class label is returned back to the user.  Moreover, an Android application is created to access the web server. This chapter  assumes the reader has a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Android.  Readers can follow the instructions in this link for installing Flask  http:  flask.pocoo. org docs 1.0 installation  .   Application Overview The target application of this chapter is summarized in Figure 7-1 which extends the  steps in Chapter 6: the dataflow graph of a CNN using TF is built and then trained using  the CIFAR10 dataset; finally, the trained model is saved to be ready for deployment.  Using Flask, a web application that listens to HTTP requests from clients is created.  Clients access the web application from web pages created using HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript.    Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7_7  295   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Figure 7-1.  Overview of the application  The server loads the saved model, opens a session, and waits for incoming requests   from the clients. The client uses a web browser to open a web page that allows uploading  an image to the server for classification. The server ensures that the image belongs to  the CIFAR10 dataset based on the size. After that, the image is fed into the model for  classification. The predicted label by the model is returned in a response to the client.  Finally, the client displays the label on the web page. For being customized to Android  devices, an Android application to send HTTP requests to the server and receive the  classification label is created.  In this chapter, each of the steps involved in the application will be covered until   successful completion.   Introduction to Flask Flask is a microframework for building web applications. Despite being micro, it does  not support some functionalities that other frameworks do. It is called “micro” because  it comes with the core requirements required to build an application. Later using  extensions, you can add the functionalities needed. Flask gives the user the decision  about what to use. For example, it does not come with a specific database and gives the  user the freedom about which database to use.  296   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Flask uses the WSGI  Web Server Gateway Interface . WSGI is how the server   handles requests from the Python web applications. It is regarded as the communication  channel between the server and the application. After the server receives a request, the  WSGI processes the request and sends it to the application written in Python. WSGI  receives the response of the application and returns it to the server. The server then  responds to the client. Flask uses Werkzeug, which is an SWGI utility for implementing  the requests and responses. Flask also uses jinja2, which is the template engine used to  build template web pages that are later filled dynamically with data.  In order to get started in Flask, let’s discusses the minimal Flask application   according to Listing 7-1. The first thing to do in order to build a Flask application is  to create an instance from the Flask class. The app instance is created using the class  constructor. The mandatory import_name parameter of the constructor is very important.  It is used to locate application resources. If the application is found in FlaskApp\ firstApp.py, then set this argument to FlaskApp. For example, if there is a CSS file to be  located under the application directory, this parameter is used to locate the file.  Listing 7-1.  Minimal Flask Application  import flask  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   @app.route rule=" "  def testFunc  :     return "Hello"  app.run    The Flask application consists of a set of functions, each associated with a URL    Universal Resource Locator . When the client navigates to a URL, the server sends a  request to the applications to respond to the client. The application uses a view function  associated with that URL to respond. The return of the view function is the response  rendered on the web page. This leaves a question: How do we associate a function with a  URL? Fortunately, the answer is simple.  297    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Chapter 7   route   Decorator At first, the function is a regular Python function that can accept arguments. In Listing  7-1, the function is called testFunc   but is not accepting any arguments yet. It returns  the string Hello. This means that when the client visits the URL associated with that  function, the string Hello will be rendered on the screen. The URL is associated with the  function using the route   decorator. It is called “route” because it works like a router.   A router receives an input message and decides which output interface to follow. Also,  the decorator receives an input URL and decides which function to call.  The route   decorator accepts an argument named rule representing the URL   associated with the view function exactly below the decorator. According to Listing 7-1,  the route   decorator associates the URL   representing the homepage to the view  function named testFunc  .  After completing this simple application, the next step is to make it active by    running the script using the run   method of the Flask class. The result of running the  application is in Figure 7-2. According to the output, the server by default listens to   the IP  Internet Protocol  address 127.0.0.1, which is a loopback address. This means  the server is just listening to requests from the local host on port 5000.  Figure 7-2.  Console output after running the first Flask app  When visiting the server at the 127.0.0.1:5000  address using a web browser, the   testFunc   function will be called. Its output is rendered on the web browser according  to Figure 7-3.  298   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Figure 7-3.  Visiting the URL associated with the testFunc   function  We can override the default values of the IP and port using the host and port   arguments of the run   method. The run   method is as follows after overriding the  default values of these arguments:  app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6500   Figure 7-4 shows the result after setting the host to 127.0.0.5 and the port number   to 6500. Just make sure no application is using the port selected.  Figure 7-4.  Listening to a different host and port by overriding the default values  of the run   method  For each request received by the server, the method of the HTTP request, URL, and   the response code are printed on the console. For example, when visiting the homepage,  the request returned 200, which means the page was successfully located. Visiting a  page that does not exist such as 127.0.0.5:6500 abc returns 404 as the response code,  meaning that the page was not found. This helps in debugging the application.  299   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Figure 7-5.  Requests received by the server  Another useful argument to the run   method is named debug. It is a boolean   argument used to decide whether to print debugging information or not. It defaults to  False. When such an argument is set to True, then we do not have to restart the server  for each change in the code. This is useful in the development of the application. Just  save the Python file of the application after each change and the server will reload itself  automatically. According to Figure 7-6, the server started using port number 6500. After  it is changed to 6300, the server reloaded itself automatically to listen for the new port.  Figure 7-6.  Automatic reload of the server after each change when debugging is  active  300   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels   add_rule_url Method Previously, the URL has been bound to the function using the route   decorator.   The decorator internally calls the add_url_rule   method inside the Flask class.   This method does the same job as any other decorator. We can directly use this method  according to Listing 7-2. It accepts the rule argument as before but in addition to the  view_func argument. It specifies which view function is associated with that rule. It is   set to the function name, which is testFunc. When we used the route   decorator,   the function is implicitly known. The function is exactly below the decorator. Note that  the call to this method does not have to be exactly below the function. Running this code  returns the same results as before.  Listing 7-2.  Using the add_url_rule   Method  import flask  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc  :     return "Hello" app.add_url_rule rule=" ", view_func=testFunc   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True    Variable Rules The previous rules are static. It is possible to add a variable part to the rule. It is regarded  as a parameter. The variable part is added after the static part of the rule between two  angle brackets  . We can modify the previous code to accept a variable parameter  representing the name according to Listing 7-3. The rule for the homepage is now     rather than just  . If the client navigates to the URL 127.0.0.5:6300 Gad, then  the name is set to Gad.  301   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Listing 7-3.  Adding Variable Part to the Rule  import flask  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc name :     return "Hello : " + name app.add_url_rule rule="  ", view_func=testFunc, endpoint="home"   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   Note that there must be an argument in the view function to accept the variable part   of the URL. For this reason, the testFunc   is modified to accept an argument named  the same as defined in the rule. The return of the function is modified to also return the  value of the name argument. Figure 7-7 shows the result after using the variable rule.  Changing the variable part and visiting the homepage will change the output.  Figure 7-7.  Using variable part in the rule  It is possible to use multiple variable parts in the rule. According to Listing 7-4, the   rule accepts two parameters representing the first and last names separated by -.  Listing 7-4.  Using More Than One Variable Part  import flask  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc fname, lname :     return "Hello : " + fname + " " + lname  302   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  app.add_url_rule rule="  - ", view_func=testFunc,  endpoint="home"   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   Visiting the URL 127.0.0.5:6300 Ahmed-Gad sets the fname to Ahmed and lname to   Gad. The result is shown in Figure 7-8.  Figure 7-8.  More than one variable part in the rule   Endpoint The add_url_rule   method accepts a third argument named endpoint. It is an  identifier to the rule and helps reuse the same rule multiple times. Note that this  argument also exists in the route   decorator. The value of the endpoint is set to the  view function by default. Here is a scenario in which the endpoint is important.  Assume that the website has two pages with one rule assigned to each page. The  first rule is   and the second rule is  addNums  - . The second page has  two parameters representing two numbers. These numbers are added together, and the  result is returned to the homepage for rendering it. Listing 7-5 gives the code for creating  these rules and their view functions. The testFunc   view function is given an endpoint  value equal to home.  The add_func   view function accepts two arguments, which are the variable   parts of the rule it is associated with. Because the values of these arguments come as  strings, their values are converted into integers using the int   function. Then they get  added together into the num3 variable. The return of this function is not the number but  redirection to another page using the redirect   method. Such a method accepts the  redirect location.  303   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Listing 7-5.  Using Endpoint to Redirect Between Pages  import flask  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc result :     return "Result is : " + result app.add_url_rule rule="  ", view_func=testFunc, endpoint="home"   def add_func num1, num2 :     num3 = int num1  + int num2      return flask.redirect location=flask.url_for "home", result=num3   app.add_url_rule rule=" addNums  - ", view_func=add_func   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   Rather than hard-coding the URL, we can simply use the endpoint to return it.   The URL is returned from the endpoint using the from_url   method. It accepts the  endpoint of a rule in addition to any variables accepted by that rule. Because the  homepage rule accepts a variable named result, then we have to add an argument  named result inside the from_url   method and assign a value to it. The value assigned  to such a variable is num3. By navigating to the URL 127.0.0.5:6300 addNums 1-2,  the numbers 1 and 2 are added, and the result is 3. The function then redirects to the  homepage, where the result variable of the rule is set equal to 3.  Using endpoints makes life easier than hard-coding the URLs. We can simply   assign the location argument of the redirect   method to the rule   but this is not  recommended. Assume that the URL of the homepage changed from   to  home, then we  have to apply that change in every reference to the homepage. Moreover, assume that the  URL is long, such as 127.0.0.5:6300 home page1. Typing this URL each time we need to  reference it is tiresome. The endpoints are regarded as an abstraction to the URL.  Another case that proves the importance of using endpoints it that the site   administrator might decide to change the address of a page. If the page is referenced  multiple times by copying and pasting its URL, then we have to change the URL  everywhere. Using endpoints avoids that problem. The endpoint is not as frequently  changed as the URLs are, and thus the site will remain active even with changes to the  pages’ URLs. Note that redirecting without using the endpoint makes it difficult to pass  the variable parts to the rule.  304   The code in Listing 7-5 accepts the input numbers to be added from the URL. We can   create a simple HTML form allowing the user to enter these numbers.  Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels   HTML Form The add_url_rule   method  and of course route   decorator  accepts another  argument called methods. It accepts a list specifying the HTTP methods the rule  responds to. The rule can respond to multiple types of methods.  There are two common HTTP methods: GET and POST. The GET method is the   default method and sends the data unencrypted. The POST method is used to send the  HTML form data to the server. Let’s create a simple form that accepts two numbers and  send them to the Flask application for addition and rendering.  Listing 7-6 gives the HTML code that creates a form with two inputs of type number   in addition to an input of type submit. The form method is set to post. Its action is the  URL http:  127.0.0.5:6300 form. The action represents the page to which the form  data will be sent. There is a rule that associates that URL with a view function that fetches  the numbers from the form, adds them, and renders the result. The names of the form  elements are very important because only elements with name attribute are sent to  the server after the form gets submitted. The element names are used as identifiers to  retrieve the element data within the Flask application.  Listing 7-6.  HTML Form       HTML Form          Num1       Num2       305   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels            The HTML form is shown in Figure 7-9.  Figure 7-9.  HTML form with two numeric inputs  After submitting the form, the Flask application in Listing 7-7 retrieves the form data.   The rule  form is associated with the handle_form   function. The rule just responds  to HTTP messages of type POST. Inside the function, the form elements are returned  using the flask.request.form dictionary. The name of each HTML form element is  used as an index to that object in order to return their values. For example, the value  of the first form element of the name num1 is returned using by using flask.request. form["num1"].  Listing 7-7.  Flask Application to Retrieve the HTML Form Data  import flask  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def handle_form  :     num1 = flask.request.form["num1"]     num1 = int num1      num2 = flask.request.form["num2"]     num2 = int num2       result = num1 + num2     result = str result   306   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels      return "Result is : " + result app.add_url_rule rule=" form", view_func=handle_form, methods=["POST"]   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   Because the value returned by indexing the flask.request.form object is a string,   it must get converted into an integer using the int   function. After adding the two  numbers, their result is stored in the result variable. This variable is converted into a  string in order to concatenate its value with a string. The concatenated string is returned  by the handle_form view function. The rendered result is shown in Figure 7-10.  Figure 7-10.  The result of adding the two numeric HTML form elements   File Upload Uploading files in Flask is very simple and similar to the previous example except  with some changes. An input of type file is created in the HTML form. Also, the form  encryption type attribute enctype is set to multipart form-data. The code of the  HTML form for uploading a file is in Listing 7-8. A screenshot of the form is available in  Figure 7-11.  Listing 7-8.  HTML Form for Uploading a File       HTML Form       <form method="post" enctype="multipart form-data"  action="http:  127.0.0.5:6300 form">  Select File to Upload    307   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels               Figure 7-11.  HTML form for uploading a file  After selecting the image to be uploaded, it is sent to the Flask application created   according to Listing 7-9. The rule is again set to respond only to HTTP messages of type  POST. Previously, we used the flask.request.form object to retrieve the data fields.  Now, we use the flask.request.files to return the details of the files to be uploaded.  The name of the form input fileUpload is used as an index to that object to return the  file to be uploaded. Note that the flask.request is a global object that receives the data  from the client web page.  In order to save the file, its name is retrieved using the filename property. It is   not recommended to save the file according to its name submitted by the user. Some  file names are set to hurt the server. To secure saving the file, the werkzeug.secure_ filename   function is used. Remember to import the werkzeug module.  Listing 7-9.  Flask Application to Upload Files to the Server  import flask, werkzeug  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def handle_form  :     file = flask.request.files["fileUpload"]     file_name = file.filename     secure_file_name = werkzeug.secure_filename file_name      file.save dst=secure_file_name   308   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels      return "File uploaded successfully." app.add_url_rule rule=" form", view_func=handle_form, methods=["POST"]   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   The secure file name is returned to the secure_file_name variable. Finally, the file is  saved permanently by calling the save   method. Such a method accepts the destination  at which the file will be saved. Because just the file name is used, it will be saved in the  current directory of the Flask application Python file.   HTML Inside Flask Application The return output from the previous view function is just a text that appears on the  web page without any formatting. Flask supports generating HTML content within the  Python code, which helps to render the results better. Listing 7-10 gives an example in  which the return result of the tesFunc   view function is HTML code in which the    element renders the result. Figure 7-12 shows the result.  Listing 7-10.  Generating HTML Inside Python  import flask, werkzeug  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc  :     return "   Hello   " app.add_url_rule rule=" ", view_func=testFunc   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   Figure 7-12.  Formatting the output of the view function using HTML code  309   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Generating HTML within the Python code makes it difficult to debug the code. It is  better to separate Python from HTML. This is why Flask supports templates using the  Jinja2 template engine.   Flask Templates  Rather than typing the HTML code within the Python file, a separate HTML file  i.e.,  template  is created. Such a template is rendered within Python using the  render_ template   method. The HTML file is called template because it is not a static file.   The template can be used multiple times with different data inputs.  In order to locate the Flask templates within the Python code, a folder named  templates is created holding all HTML files. Assuming that the Flask Python file is  named firstApp.py and the HTML file is named hello.html, the project structure is  illustrated in Figure 7-13. In Listing 7-11, the hello.html file is created to print the Hello  message exactly the same as in Listing 7-10.  Figure 7-13.  Project structure after using templates  Listing 7-11.  Template to Print Hello Message       HTML Template        Hello        310   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  The Python code rendering this template is given in Listing 7-12. The return result of  the view function associated with the homepage is the output of the render_template    method. This method accepts an argument named template_name_or_list specifying  the template file name. Note that the argument may accept a single name or a list of  names. When a list is specified with multiple names, the first template existing will be  rendered. The rendered result of this example is identical to Figure 7-12.  Listing 7-12.  Python Code to Render an HTML Template  import flask, werkzeug  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc  :     return flask.render_template template_name_or_list="hello.html"  app.add_url_rule rule=" ", view_func=testFunc   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True    Dynamic Templates  The templates are currently static, as they get rendered the same each time. We can  make them dynamic by using variable data. Jinja2 supports adding placeholders inside  the template. When rendering the template, these placeholders are replaced by the  output of evaluating a Python expression. At the place at which the expression output is  to be printed, enclose the expression by {{...}}. Listing 7-13 gives the HTML code in  which the variable name is used.  Listing 7-13.  HTML Code with an Expression       HTML Template with an Expression        Hello {{name}}        311   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Next is to render that template after passing the value for the variable name according  to Listing 7-14. The variables inside the template to be rendered are passed as arguments  inside the render_template along with their values. The result of visiting the homepage  is in Figure 7-14.  Listing 7-14.  Rendering Flask Template with an Expression  import flask, werkzeug  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc  :      return flask.render_template template_name_or_list="hello.html",   name="Ahmed"   app.add_url_rule rule=" ", view_func=testFunc   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   Figure 7-14.  The result of rendering a template with an expression  The value of the variable name is statically typed, but it could be generated   dynamically using either a variable rule or an HTML form. Listing 7-15 gives the code  used to create a variable rule accepting a name. The view function must have an  argument named according to the variable part of the rule. The value of this argument  is then assigned to the name argument of the  render_template   method. The value is  then passed to the template to be rendered according to Figure 7-15.  312   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Listing 7-15.  Variable Rule to Pass Value to Flask Template  import flask, werkzeug  app = flask.Flask import_name="FlaskApp"   def testFunc name :      return flask.render_template template_name_or_list="hello.html",   name=name   app.add_url_rule rule="  ", view_func=testFunc   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   Figure 7-15.  Passing the value received from a variable rule to Flask template  We can also insert Python statements, comments, and line statements inside the HTML   code, each with a different placeholder. Statements are enclosed between {% ... %},   comments are enclosed by { ... }, and line statements are enclosed by  ... .  Listing 7-16 gives an example in which a Python for loop is inserted to print five numbers  from 0 to 4, each inside   HTML element. Each statement within the loop is enclosed  by {%...%}.  Python uses indentation to define blocks. Because there is no indentation inside   HTML, the end of the for loop is marked with endfor. The result of rendering this file is  given in Figure 7-16.  Listing 7-16.  Embedding a Python Loop Inside Flask Template       HTML Template with Expression       313   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  {%for k in range 5 :%}  {%print k %}  {%endfor%}       Figure 7-16.  Rendering a template with a Python loop  Static Files Static files such as CSS and JavaScript files are used to style web pages and make them  dynamic. Similar to the templates, there is a folder created to store the static files. The  folder name is static. If we are to create a CSS file named style.css and a JavaScript  file named simpeJS.js, the project structure will be as given in Figure 7-17.  314   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Figure 7-17.  Project structure with both templates and static files  The Python code is identical to the code in Listing 7-15 without using the variable   part of the rule. Listing 7-17 shows the content of the hello.html file. It’s worth  mentioning how the HTML file is linked to the JavaScript and CSS files. As regularly,  the JavaScript file is added using the   tag, where the type attribute is text  javascript. Also, the CSS file is added using the   tag, where the rel attribute is set  to stylesheet. What is new is how these files are located.  Listing 7-17.  HTML File Linked with CSS and JavaScript Files       HTML Template with Expression  <script type="text javascript" src="{{url_for endpoint='static',  filename='simpleJS.js' }}">  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{url_for endpoint='static', filename='style. css' }}">      {%for k in range 5 :%}  {%print k %}  {%endfor%}      315   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Within the   and   tags, the url_for   method is used within an   expression to locate the files. The endpoint attribute of the method is set to static, which  means that you should look at the folder named static under the project structure.   The method accepts another argument named filename, which refers to the file name of  the static file.  The content of the CSS file is given in Listing 7-18. It just targets any   elements   and decorates their text by adding a dotted line under and over it.  Listing 7-18.  Content of the CSS File  h1 { text-decoration: underline overline; }  Listing 7-19 gives the content of the JavaScript file. It has a single function named  showAlert, which accepts an argument that is concatenated to a string and printed in  an alert. When any of the   elements representing the five numbers inside the HTML  template are clicked, this function is called. The number associated with the element is  passed as an argument to the function in order to get printed.  Listing 7-19.  Content of the JavaScript File  function showAlert num { alert "Number is " + num  }  Figure 7-18.  When the number   element with the text 1 is clicked, the output is as given in   316   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Figure 7-18.  The result of clicking on the second   element with the text 1  At this point, we have had an introduction to Flask, which is good enough to enable   us to start deploying pretrained models. In the next sections, the pretrained models  against the Fruits 360 and CIFAR10 datasets will be deployed to the web server to enable  accessing them by Flask applications for classifying uploaded images by clients.   Deploying Trained Model Using Fruits 360 Dataset The first model we are going to deploy is the trained model in Chapter 5 using the Fruits  360 dataset and optimized using the GA. The Flask application consists of two main  pages.  The first page is the homepage. It has an HTML form that allows the user to select an  image file. That file is uploaded to the server. The second page accomplishes most of the  work. It follows the same steps in Chapter 5. It reads the image after being uploaded to  the server, extracts its features, filters features using STD, predicts the image class label  using the pretrained ANN, and finally allows the user to return back to the homepage  to select another image for classification. The application has the structure defined in  Figure 7-19. Let’s discuss the application in detail.  317   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Figure 7-19.  Fruits 360 recognition application structure  Listing 7-20 starts the first step toward building the application. All required modules   for the entire application are imported. An instance of the Flask class is created with  the import_name argument of the constructor set to the name of the parent directory,  which is FruitsApp. A single rule is created up to the current time. That rule binds the  URL of the homepage   to the view function homepage. The application runs using host  127.0.0.5, port number 6302, and active debug mode.  Listing 7-20.  Basic Structure of the Fruits 360 Recognition Application  import flask, werkzeug, skimage.io, skimage.color, numpy, pickle  app = flask.Flask import_name="FruitsApp"   def homepage  :     return flask.render_template template_name_or_list="home.html"  app.add_url_rule rule=" ", view_func=homepage, endpoint="homepage"   app.run host="127.0.0.5", port=6300, debug=True   When the user visits the home page http:  127.0.0.5:6302, the view function  homepage   renders the home.html template using the render_template   method.  The associated endpoint used is homepage, which is identical to the name of the view  function. Note that omitting this endpoint will not change anything because the default  endpoint actually equals to the view function name. The content of the home.html page  is given in Listing 7-21.  318   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Listing 7-21.  Implementation of the home.html Page       Select Image  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{url_for endpoint='static', filename='style. css' }}">       Select an Image from the Fruits 360 Dataset  <form enctype="multipart form-data" action="{{url_ for endpoint='extract' }}" method="post">              That page creates an HTML form with an input named img representing the file to   be uploaded. Remember that the encryption type attribute enctype of the form is set to  multipart form-data and the method is post. The action represents the page to which  the form data will be submitted. After submitting the form, its data are sent to another  page to classify the image file uploaded. To avoid hard-coding the URLs, the endpoint  of the target rule, which is set to extract, is used to fetch its URL using the url_for    method. To enable running this expression from within the HTML page, it is enclosed  between {{...}}.  In the page header, the stylesheet static file style.css is linked to the page by  using an expression that accepts the endpoint and the filename arguments for the  url_for   method. Remember that the endpoint for static files is set to static. The  filename argument is set to the target static file name. The content of the CSS file is  discussed later. Figure 7-20 presents the screen of the homepage after selecting an image  file. After submitting the form, the selected file details are sent to the view function  extractFeatures, which is associated with the endpoint extract for further processing.  319   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  Figure 7-20.  Screenshot of the homepage for uploading an image from the Fruits  360 dataset  Listing 7-22 gives the code for the extractFeatures view function associated with   the  extract rule. Note that this rule is made to listen only to POST HTTP methods. The  extractFeatures view function responds to the form submitted previously. It returns  the uploaded image file using the dictionary flask.request.files. The file name is  returned using the filename property of the image file. To make saving the file more  secure, the secure file name is returned using the secure_filename   function, which  accepts the original file name and returns a secure name. The image is saved according  to this secure name.  Listing 7-22.  Python Code for the extractFeatures View Function  def extractFeatures  :     img = flask.request.files["img"]     img_name = img.filename     img_secure_name = werkzeug.secure_filename img_name      img.save img_secure_name      print "Image Uploaded successfully."   img_features = extract_features image_path=img_secure_name      print "Features extracted successfully."       f = open "weights_1000_iterations_10%_mutation.pkl", "rb"      weights_mat = pickle.load f      f.close       weights_mat = weights_mat[0, :]       predicted_label = predict_outputs weights_mat, img_features,   activation="sigmoid"   320   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels      class_labels = ["Apple", "Raspberry", "Mango", "Lemon"]     predicted_class = class_labels[predicted_label]      return flask.render_template template_name_or_list="result.html",   predicted_class=predicted_class   app.add_url_rule rule=" extract", view_func=extractFeatures,  methods=["POST"], endpoint="extract"   After uploading the image to the server, its features are extracted using the extract_  features function defined in Listing 7-23. It accepts the image path and follows the  steps in section Fruits 360 Dataset Feature Mining of Chapter 3 from reading the image  file, extracting the hue channel histogram, filtering features using STD, and finally to  returning the filtered set of features. The features are filtered according to the indices of  the selected elements based on the experiment done on the training data. The number  of these elements is 102. The feature vector is then returned into a row NumPy vector of  shape 1×102. This makes it ready for matrix multiplication. After returning the feature  vector, we can continue executing the extractFeatures view function.  Listing 7-23.  Extracting Features from the Uploaded Image  def extract_features image_path :     f = open "select_indices.pkl", "rb"      indices = pickle.load f      f.close        fruit_data = skimage.io.imread fname=image_path      fruit_data_hsv = skimage.color.rgb2hsv rgb=fruit_data      hist = numpy.histogram a=fruit_data_hsv[:, :, 0], bins=360      im_features = hist[0][indices]     img_features = numpy.zeros shape= 1, im_features.size       img_features[0, :] = im_features [:im_features.size]     return img_features  According to Listing 7-23, the next step in receiving the feature vector into the   img_features variable is to restore the set of weights learned by the ANN trained   using GA. The weights are returned to the weights_mat variable. Note that these weights  represent all solutions of the population returned after the last generation. We just need  to find the first solution in the population. This is why the index 0 is just returned from  the weights_mat variable.  321   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels  After preparing the image features and the learned weights, the next step is to apply   them on the ANN for producing the prediction label using the predict_outputs    function according to Listing 7-24. It accepts the weights, features, and activation  functions. The activation functions are identical to what we implemented before. The  predict_outputs   function goes through a loop that performs matrix multiplication  between the inputs and the weights of each layer in the ANN. After reaching the result of  the output layer, the predicted class index is returned. It corresponds to the class with the  maximum score. This index is returned by this function.  Listing 7-24.  Predicting the Class Label for the Uploaded Image  def predict_outputs weights_mat, data_inputs, activation="relu" :     r1 = data_inputs     for curr_weights in weights_mat:         r1 = numpy.matmul a=r1, b=curr_weights          if activation == "relu":             r1 = relu r1          elif activation == "sigmoid":             r1 = sigmoid r1      r1 = r1[0, :]     predicted_label = numpy.where r1 == numpy.max r1  [0][0]     return predicted_label  After returning the predicted class index, we come back to Listing 7-22. The returned   index is then converted into the string label of the corresponding class. All labels are  saved into the class_labels list. The predicted class label is returned to the predicted_ class variable. The extractFeatures view function finally renders the result.html  template using the render_template   method. It passes the predicted class label to  such a template. The code of this template is available in Listing 7-25.  Listing 7-25.  Content of the result.html Template       Predicted Class  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{url_for endpoint='static', filename='style. css' }}">  322   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels        Predicted Label   {{predicted_class}}   Classify Another Image       The template creates an expression to be able to render the predicted class   label within the   element. An anchor is created to let the user return back to the  homepage to classify another image. The URL of the homepage is returned based on its  endpoint. The screen of the result.html file after printing the class label is shown in  Figure 7-21.  Figure 7-21.  The result of classifying an uploaded image  Note that the application just has a single static file named style.css implemented   according to Listing 7-26. It simply change the font size of both the   and    elements. It also adds decorations to the text of   elements by adding a line over and  under the text.  Listing 7-26.

There are some enhancements compared to the previous application. The structure of  the application is given in Figure 7-22.  Figure 7-22.  Application structure for deploying the pretrained model using  CIFAR10 dataset  We will discuss each part of the application later. Let’s start with the code in    Listing 7-28. The libraries required across the entire application are imported. It is   preferred to make the prediction step in a separate module. This is why the  CIFAR10Predict module is used. It has all required functions to predict the class label of  an image from the CIFAR10 dataset. This makes the Python file of the Flask application  focused on the view functions.  Listing 7-28.  Preparing a Flask Application for Deploying the Pretrained Model  Using CIFAR10 Dataset  import flask, werkzeug, os, scipy.misc, tensorflow import CIFAR10Predict  app = flask.Flask "CIFARTF"   def redirect_upload  :  326   Chapter 7    Deploying pretraineD MoDels      return flask.render_template template_name_or_list="upload_image.html"  app.add_url_rule rule=" ", endpoint="homepage", view_func=redirect_upload   if __name__ == "__main__":     prepare_TF_session saved_model_path='\\AhmedGad\\model\\'      app.run host="localhost", port=7777, debug=True   Before running the application, it is good practice to ensure it is the main file   executed and not referenced from another file. If the file is running as the main file, the  __name__ variable inside it will be equal to __main__. Otherwise, the __name__ variable  is set to the module from which the file is called. The file should run only if it is the main  file. This is why the if statement is used.  A TF session is created in order to restore the pretrained model using the prepare_  TF_session function implemented according to Listing 7-29. This function receives  the path of the saved model in order to restore the graph and prepare the session by  initializing the variables in the graph before making predictions.  Listing 7-29.

There is a rule created that binds the homepage URL   to the view function   redirect_upload  . This rule has the endpoint homepage.

Some other tensors  are restored to override their values, which are the keep_prop to avoid dropping any  neuron in the testing phase and data_tensor tensors to provide the data of the image file  uploaded. The session then runs to return the predicted label. The label is just a number  that is an identifier to the class. The dataset provides a metadata file in which there is a  list containing the names of all classes. The identifier is converted into the class string  label by indexing the list.  After prediction completes, the CNN_predict   view functions sends the predicted   class to the prediction_result.html template for rendering. This template is  implemented as given in Listing 7-35. It is very simple. It just uses an expression to  print the predicted class within a   element. The page provides a link to return  to the homepage based on the endpoint to select another image for classification.

For example, TensorFlowLite, Caffe Android, and Torch Android are  all releases from TF, Caffe, and Torch, respectively, to support mobile devices. These  releases are based on their parents. There must be an in-between step in order to make  the original model work on mobile devices. For example, the process of creating an  Android application that uses TensorFlowLite has the following summarized steps:    1.  Prepare the TF Model.    2.  Convert the TF Model to TensorFlowLite Model.    3.  Create an Android Project.    4.   Import the TensorFlowLite Model Within the Project.    5.  Call the Model Within Java Code.  It is tiresome to go through these steps for building a model suitable for running on   mobile devices. The challenging step is the second one.  TensorFlowLite is a release compatible with mobile devices. Thus, it is simplified  compared to its ancestor TF. This means it does not support everything in its parent  library. Some operations in TF such as tanh, image.resize_bilinear, and depth_to_space  are not supported in TensorFlowLite to date. This adds restrictions when preparing  a model that works on mobile devices. Moreover, the model developer has to use  languages in order to create an Android application running a trained CNN model.  Using Python, the model will be created using TF. After optimizing the model using  the TF optimizing converter  TOCO , a project is created using Android Studio. Inside  such a project, the model will be called using Java. As a result, the process is not     Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F.

For more information  about building mobile applications using TensorFlowLite, read the documentation at  this link  www.tensorflow.org lite overview . In this chapter, we will use Kivy  KV  for  building applications running cross-platform with minimal effort.  Kivy is an abstract and modular open source cross-platform Python framework used   to create natural user interfaces  UIs . It decouples the developer from complex details  by using back-end libraries for low-level access to graphics hardware and handling both  audio and video. It just gives the developer simple APIs for doing the tasks.  This chapter gives an introduction to Kivy using a number of simple examples to  help explain its basic program structure, UI widgets, structuring of the widgets using  KV language, and handling actions. Kivy supports the execution of the same Python  code on Window, Linux, Mac, and also mobile devices, which makes it cross-platform.  Using Buildozer and Python-4-Android  P4A , the Kivy application is converted into  an Android package. Not only executes native Python code; Kivy also supports some  libraries to be executed on mobile devices such as NumPy and PIL  Python Image  Library . By the end of this chapter, a cross-platform application is built to execute the  CNN implemented in Chapter 5 using NumPy. Ubuntu is used in this chapter because  Buildozer is currently available on Linux.   Introduction to Kivy In this section, Kivy basics are discussed in detail based on some examples. This helps us  to put our hands on the way to build our own applications. Remember from Chapter 7   that Flask application starts to create an application by instantiating the Flask class; then  the application runs by calling the run   method. Kivy is similar but with some changes.  We can assume that the Flask class corresponds to the App class in Kivy. There is a  method called run   inside both Kivy and Flask. The Kivy application is created not by  instantiating the class App but by instantiating a child class extending the App class. The  application then runs by calling the run   method using an instance created from the  child class.  Kivy is used to build a UI that consists of a set of visual elements called widgets.  Between instantiating the class and running it, we have to specify which widgets are  used and their layout. The App class supports a method called build  , which returns  the layout widget containing all other widgets in the UI. This method can be overridden  from the parent App class.  340   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations   Basic Application Using BoxLayout Let’s make things clearer by discussing a basic Kivy application in Listing 8-1. At first, the  required modules from Kivy are imported. The kivy.app contains the App class. This  class is used as the parent of our defined class FirstApp. The second statement imports  kivy.uix.label, which has the label widget. This widget just displays text on the UI.  Inside the build   method, the label widget is created using the kivy.uix.label.  Label class. The class constructor accepts an argument named text, which is the text to  be displayed on the UI. The returned label is saved as a property of the FirstApp object.  Adding widgets as properties for the class object makes it easy to retrieve them later  compared to saving them in separate variables.  Listing 8-1.  Basic Kivy Application  import kivy.app import kivy.uix.label import kivy.uix.boxlayout  class FirstApp kivy.app.App :     def build self :         self.label = kivy.uix.label.Label text="Hello Kivy"          self.layout = kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout           self.layout.add_widget widget=self.label          return self.layout  firstApp = FirstApp   firstApp.run    Widgets in Kivy are grouped into a root widget. In Listing 8-1, the BoxLayout is used   as the root widget, which contains all other widgets. This is why the kivy.uix.boxlayout  is imported. Based on the constructor of the kivy.uix.label.BoxLayout class, the  BoxLayout object is saved as a property of the FirstClass object. After creating both  the label and the layout objects, the label is added to the layout using the add_widget    method. This method has an argument named widget, which accepts the widget to be  added to the layout. After adding the label into the root widget  layout , the layout is  returned by the build   method.  341   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  After creating the child class FirstApp and preparing its build   method, an   instance from that class is created. The run   method is then called by that instance and  the application window is displayed according to Figure 8-1.  Figure 8-1.  Simple Kivy application with a text label  Kivy Application Life Cycle By just running the application, the widgets defined inside the build   method are  rendered on the screen. Note that the Kivy life cycle is illustrated in Figure 8-2.   It is similar to the Android application life cycle. The life cycle starts by running the  application using the run   method. After that, the build   method is executed,  which returns the widgets to be displayed. After executing the on_start   method,  the application runs successfully. Also, the application might get paused or stopped.  If paused, then the on_pause   method is called. If the application resumed, then the  on_resume   method is called. If not resumed, then the app stops. The app might get  stopped directly without being paused. If this case, the on_stop   method is called.  342   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-2.  Kivy application life cycle  The title at the top of the Figure 8-1 has the word First. What is that? The child class  is named FirstApp. When the class is named with the word App at the end, Kivy uses the  work before it as the application title. Naming the class MyApp, then the title is My. Note  that the word App must start with a capital letter. If the class is named Firstapp, then  the title will be also Firstapp. Note that we have the ability to set a custom name using  the title argument of the class constructor. The constructor also accepts an argument  named icon, which is the path of an image.  Listing 8-2 sets the application title to a custom title and also implements the   on_start   and on_stop   methods. The window is shown in Figure 8-3. When the  application starts, the on_start   method is called to print a message. This is the same  for the on_stop   method.  343   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Listing 8-2.  Implementing Life Cycle Methods  import kivy.app import kivy.uix.label import kivy.uix.boxlayout  class FirstApp kivy.app.App :     def build self :         self.label = kivy.uix.label.Label text="Hello Kivy"          self.layout = kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout           self.layout.add_widget widget=self.label          return self.layout      def on_start self :         print "on_start  "       def on_stop self :         print "on_stop  "   firstApp = FirstApp title="First Kivy Application."  firstApp.run    Figure 8-3.  Channing the application title  344   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  We can add more than one widget inside the BoxLayout. This layout widget arranges  its child widgets either vertically or horizontally. Its constructor has an argument named  orientation to define the arrangement. It has two values: horizontal and vertical. It  defaults to horizontal.  If the orientation is set to vertical, then the widgets are stacked on top of each other,   where the first widget added appears at the bottom of the window and the last widget  added appears on the top. In this case, the window height is divided equally across all  child widgets.  If the orientation is horizontal, then the widgets are added side by side, where the   first widget added is the leftmost widget on the screen, while the last widget added is the  rightmost widget on the screen. In this case, the width of the window is divided equally  across all child widgets.  Listing 8-3 uses five button widgets with their text set to Button 1, Button 2, up to   Button 5. These widgets are added horizontally inside a BoxLayout widget. The result is  given in Figure 8-4.  Listing 8-3.  Kivy Application using BoxLayout as the Root Widget with  Horizontal Orientation  import kivy.app import kivy.uix.button import kivy.uix.boxlayout  class FirstApp kivy.app.App :     def build self :         self.button1 = kivy.uix.button.Button text="Button 1"          self.button2 = kivy.uix.button.Button text="Button 2"          self.button3 = kivy.uix.button.Button text="Button 3"          self.button4 = kivy.uix.button.Button text="Button 4"          self.button5 = kivy.uix.button.Button text="Button 5"           self.layout = kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout orientation=   "horizontal"           self.layout.add_widget widget=self.button1          self.layout.add_widget widget=self.button2          self.layout.add_widget widget=self.button3          self.layout.add_widget widget=self.button4          self.layout.add_widget widget=self.button5   345   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations          return self.layout  firstApp = FirstApp title="Horizontal BoxLayout Orientation."  firstApp.run    Figure 8-4.  The horizontal orientation of the BoxLayout widget   Widget Size The BoxLayout divides the screen equally across all widgets. Adding five widgets, then it  splits the screen into five equal parts in both width and height. It assigns each widget a  part of equal size. We can make the part size assigned to a widget larger or smaller using  the size_hint argument of the widgets. It accepts a tuple with two values defining the  width and height relative to the window size. By default, the tuple is  1,1  for all widgets.  This means equal sizes. If this argument is set to  2, 1  for a widget, the widget width will  be doubled compared to the default width. If it is set to  0.5,1 , then the widget width will  be half the default width.  Listing 8-4 changes the size_hint argument for some widgets. Figure 8-5 shows  the result where the text of each button reflects its widths relative to the window size.  Note that the widgets make a hint to the parent widget that it would like its size to be  according to the values specified by the size_hint argument. The parent might accept  or reject the request. This is why it has the word hint in the argument name.    346   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  For example, setting the col_force_default or row_force_default properties of the  widget makes the parent completely ignore the size_hint argument. Note that the  size_hint is an argument to the widget constructor and also available as a property for  the instances from the widgets.  Listing 8-4.

Changing the width of the widgets using size_hint argument  GridLayout There are also layouts other than the BoxLayout. For example, the GridLayout divides  the screen into a grid based on the specified number of rows and columns. According  to Listing 8-5, a grid layout is created with two rows and three columns in which six  buttons are added. The number of rows and columns are set according to the rows and  cols properties, respectively. The first widget added appears on the top left corner, while  the last widget added appears on the bottom right corner. The result is illustrated in  Figure 8-6.  Listing 8-5.

GridLayout with two rows and three columns  Another layout that is suitable for mobile devices is the PageLayout. It actually builds  several pages within the same layout. At the page borders, the user can drag the page left  or right in order to navigate to another page. Creating such a layout is simple. Just create  an instance of the kivy.uix.pagelayout.PageLayout class, which is similar to what we  did before. Then, add widgets into the layout exactly as we did using the add_widget    method.  349    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Chapter 8   More Widgets There are multiple widgets to use in the UI. For example, the Image widget is used to  display an image based on its source. The TextInput widget allows the user to type  inputs into the application. Others include CheckBox, RadioButton, Slider, and more.  Listing 8-6 gives an example with Button, Label, TextInput, and Image widgets. The  TextInput class constructor has a property named hint_text that shows a hint message  inside the widget to help the user know what input to enter. The image widget uses the  source property to specify the image path. Figure 8-7 shows the result. Later, we will  handle the actions of these widgets such as button click, changing label text, and more.  Listing 8-6.

The widget tree of Listing 8-6 is illustrated in Figure 8-8. The tree has  just one level. We can create a deeper tree like the one in Figure 8-9, in which the root  BoxLayout widget with vertical orientation has two layouts as children. The first one is  a GridLayout widget with two rows and two columns. The second child is a horizontal  BoxLayout widget with horizontal orientation. These child GridLayout widgets have  their own child widgets.  Figure 8-8.

Nested widgets  353    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Chapter 8   Handling Events We can handle the events generated by the Kivy widgets using the bind   method. This  method accepts an argument specifying the target event to be handled. This argument  is assigned a function or method to be called for handling such an event. For example,  when a button is pressed, the on_press event is fired. As a result, the argument used with  the bind   method will be named on_press. Assume that we want to handle this event  using a method called handle_press, then the on_press argument of the bind   method  will be assigned this method name. Note that the method handling an event accepts an  argument representing the widget that fired the event. Let’s see how things work using  the application in Listing 8-8.  The application has two TextInput widgets, one Label, and a Button. The user   enters a number in each of the TextInput widgets. When the button is pressed,  the numbers are fetched and added, and then the result is rendered on the Label.  Everything in the application is familiar to us based on the previous examples except for  calling the bind   method for handling the press event using the add_nums   method.  Listing 8-8.  Application for Adding Two Numbers and Showing Their Results on  a Label  import kivy.app import kivy.uix.label import kivy.uix.textinput import kivy.uix.button import kivy.uix.image import kivy.uix.boxlayout import kivy.uix.gridlayout  class FirstApp kivy.app.App :      def add_nums self, button :         num1 = float self.textinput1.text          num2 = float self.textinput2.text          result = num1 + num2         self.label.text = str result       def build self :  354   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations           self.boxLayout = kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout orientation=            self.textinput1 = kivy.uix.textinput.TextInput hint_text="Enter            self.textinput2 = kivy.uix.textinput.TextInput hint_text="Enter   "horizontal"   First Number."   Second Number."           self.boxLayout.add_widget widget=self.textinput1          self.boxLayout.add_widget widget=self.textinput2           self.label = kivy.uix.label.Label text="Result of Addition."          self.button = kivy.uix.button.Button text="Add Numbers."          self.button.bind on_press=self.add_nums            self.rootBoxLayout = kivy.uix.boxlayout.BoxLayout orientation=   "vertical"           self.rootBoxLayout.add_widget widget=self.label          self.rootBoxLayout.add_widget widget=self.boxLayout          self.rootBoxLayout.add_widget widget=self.button           return self.rootBoxLayout  firstApp = FirstApp title="Handling Actions using Bind  ."  firstApp.run    The button calls the bind   method, which is a property of any widget. For handling   the on_press event, the method will use it as an argument. This argument is set equal  to the custom function created with the name add_nums. This means the add_nums    method will be executed each time the on_press event is fired. The on_press itself is a  method. Because it is empty by default, we need to add some logic to it. That logic may  be a method we defined in the Python file, such as the add_nums method. Note that we  created a method, not a function for handling the event to have access to all widgets  within the object. If a function is used, then we have to pass the properties of the widgets  needed for handling the event.  Inside the add_nums   method, the text inside the two TextInput widgets is returned  using the text property into the num1 and num2 variables. Because the result returned by  the text property is a string, we have to convert it into a number. This is done using the  float   function. The two numbers are added together and the result is returned to the  result variable. Adding two numbers will return a number. Thus, the data type of the   355   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  result variable is numeric. Because the text property only accepts strings, we have to  convert the result variable into a string using the str   function in order to display its  value on the label. Figure 8-11 shows the application UI after adding two numbers and  rendering the result on the Label widget.  Figure 8-11.  Application UI that adds two numbers and displays the result on a  Label widget  KV Language Enlarging the widget tree by adding more widgets makes the Python code harder to  debug. Similar to what we did in Chapter 7 by separating the HTML code from the  logic inside the Flask application, in this chapter we will separate the UI code from the  application logic.  The UI will be created using a language called KV language  kvlang or Kivy   language . This language creates files with extension .kv holding the UI widgets. Thus,  there will be a .py file for the application logic such as handling the events, and another  .kv file for holding the UI of the application. The KV language builds the widget tree in a  simple way that is well read compared to adding it inside the Python code. KV language  makes it easy to debug the UI because it is clear what children belong to a given parent. The KV file consists of a set of rules similar to the CSS rule that defines the widgets.   A rule consists of the widget class and a set of properties with their values. A colon is  added after the widget class name to indicate the beginning of the widget content. The   356   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  content under a given widget is indented just the same as what Python does for defining  the content of blocks. There is a colon between the property name and its value. For  example, Listing 8-9 creates a rule for building a button widget.  The button widget is written followed by a colon. Everything indented after the colon   belongs to that widget. The number of indentation spaces is not fixed to just four. It is  similar to Python in that we can use any number of spaces. We find that there are three  properties that are indented. The first one is the text property, which is separated from  the value using a colon. Going to a new indented line, we can write the new property  background_color, which is separated from its value using a colon. By the way, the color  is defined using the RGBA color space, where A represents the alpha channel. Color values  are between 0.0 and 1.0. For the third property, the same process is repeated by writing its  name separated from its value using a colon. The color property defines the text color.  Listing 8-9.  Preparing the Button Widget with Some Properties Using KV  Language  Button:     text: "Press Me."    background_color:  0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0      color:  0,0,0,1   We can create a simple Kivy application that uses a KV file for building the   UI. Assume we want to build a UI with the BoxLayout widget as the root with vertical  orientation. That root widget has three children  Button, Label, and TextInput . Note  that the KV language has only one root widget, which is defined by typing it without any  indentation. The children of this root widget will be indented equally. The KV language  file is given in Listing 8-10. The Button, Label, and TextInput widgets are indented  by four spaces after the root widget. The root widget itself can have properties. The  properties of each child widget are indented behind their widgets. It is simple enough,  but how can we use this KV file inside the Python code?  Listing 8-10.  Simple UI Created Using KV Language  BoxLayout:     orientation: "vertical"     Button:         text: "Press Me."         color:  1,1,1,1   357   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations      Label:         text: "Label"     TextInput:         hint_text: "TextInput"  There are two ways of loading the KV file inside the Python code. The first way is to  specify the path of the file inside the load_file   method of the kivy.lang.builder. Builder class. This method uses its filename argument to specify the path of the file.  The file can be located anywhere and is not required to be in the same directory as the  Python file. Listing 8-11 shows how to locate the KV file this way.  Previously, the return of the build   method is the root widget defined within the  Python file. Now it returns the result of the load_file   method. The Python code is  clearer after separating the logic inside the Python file from the presentation, which is  now inside the KV file.  Listing 8-11.  Locating the LV File Using Its Path  import kivy.app import kivy.lang.builder  class FirstApp kivy.app.App :      def build self :          return kivy.lang.builder.Builder.load_file filename='ahmedgad   FirstApp first.kv'   firstApp = FirstApp title="Importing UI from KV File."  firstApp.run    The code can be made clearer by using the second way of loading the KV file. This   way depends on the name of the child class inheriting the App class. If this class is  named FirstApp, then Kivy will look for a KV file named first.kv. That is, the App word  is removed and the remaining text First is converted into lowercase. If there is a file  named first.kv inside the same directory at which the Python file exists, then this file  will be loaded automatically.  When this method is used, the Python code will be as given in Listing 8-12. The code  is now clearer than before and simpler to debug. The pass statement is added inside the  FirstApp class to avoid leaving it empty. Note that if Kivy could not locate a file named  according to first.kv, the application will still run but it will show a blank window.  358   Listing 8-12.  Loading the KV File Named According to the Child Class Name  Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  import kivy.app  class FirstApp kivy.app.App :     pass  firstApp = FirstApp title="Importing UI from KV File."  firstApp.run    We can separate the UI in Listing 8-8 from the Python code and bind the event   handler to the button inside the KV file. The KV file is given in Listing 8-13.  There are some further points worth mentioning. A widget can be given an ID   inside the KV file using the id property. Its value does not need to be enclosed between  quotes. The ID can be used to retrieve properties of widgets inside both the KV file and  the Python file. According to the code, IDs are given to the elements Label and the two  TextInput widgets. The reason is that these are the widgets we are looking to retrieve or  change in terms of their properties.  Listing 8-13.  UI of Listing 8-8 for Adding Two Numbers Separated into KV File  BoxLayout:     orientation: "vertical"     Label:         text: "Result of Addition."         id: label     BoxLayout:         orientation: "horizontal"         TextInput:             hint_text: "Enter First Number."             id: textinput1         TextInput:             hint_text: "Enter Second Number."             id: textinput2     Button:         text: "Add Numbers."         on_press: app.add_nums root   359   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  The button widget has the on_press property. It is used to bind the event handler  to the on_press event. The event handler is the add_nums   method found inside the  Python code in Listing 8-14. Thus, we want to call a Python method from the KV file.  How can we do that?  The KV language has three helpful keywords: app, referring to the application   instance; root, referring to the root widget in the KV file; and self, which refers to the  current widget. The suitable keyword for use in order to call a method from the Python  code is the app keyword. Because it refers to the entire application, then it will be able  to refer to the methods inside the Python file. Thus, we can use it to call the add_nums    method using app.add_nums  .  Listing 8-14.  Kivy Python File for Handling the on_press Event  import kivy.app  class FirstApp kivy.app.App :      def add_nums self, root :         num1 = float self.root.ids["textinput1"].text          num2 = float self.root.ids["textinput2"].text          result = num1 + num2         self.root.ids["label"].text = str result   firstApp = FirstApp title="Importing UI from KV File."  firstApp.run    Inside this method, we want to refer to the TextInput and label widgets in order to  fetch the numbers entered and print the result on the label. Because the self argument  refers to what called it, which is the instance about the entire application, we can use it to  refer to the root widget using self.root. This returns the root of the widgets, which can  be used to access any of its child widgets based on their IDs.  All IDs inside the KF file are saved inside the ids dictionary. We can use this   dictionary to retrieve whatever widget we want as long as it has an ID. After retrieving  the widget itself, we can fetch its properties. This way we can return the entered numbers  within the TextInput widgets, convert their values from string to float, add them, and  assign the text property of the Label widget the result after being converted into a  string.  360   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations   P4A At this point, we have a good overview of Kivy. We can go forward toward a building  Android applications using Kivy. We will start by packaging the Kivy application in  Listing 8-13 and Listing 8-14.  Without any change in the previous applications, they will run on Android after   packaging them. The simplified steps of converting the Kivy application into an Android  application are illustrated in Figure 8-12.  Figure 8-12.  Steps for building Android applications from Kivy applications  After completing the Kivy Python application, the Buildozer tool prepares the  required tools for creating the APK file. The most important tool is called P4A. The  Buildozer tool creates a file named buildozer.spec for each Kivy application before  being converted into an Android application. This file holds details about the application  that will be discussed later in section Preparing buildozer.spec File. Let’s start by  installing the Buildozer tool.   Installing Buildozer The Buildozer tool is used in this section to package the Kivy applications as Android  applications. Once installed, Buildozer automates the process of building the  Android applications. It prepares the environment by all requirements in order to  build the applications successfully. These requirements include P4A, Android SDK,  and NDK. Before installing Buildozer, some dependencies are required. They can be  downloaded and installed automatically using the following Ubuntu commands:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~$ sudo pip install --upgrade cython==0.21 ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~$ sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install build-essential ccache git  libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386 libpangox-1.0-0:i386   361   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  libpangoxft-1.0-0:i386 libidn11:i386 python2.7 python2.7-dev openjdk-8-jdk  unzip zlib1g-dev zlib1g:i386  After installing these dependencies successfully, Buildozer can be installed   according to this command:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~$ sudo install --upgrade buildozer  In case Buildozer is currently installed on your machine, the --upgrade option makes   sure it is upgraded to the latest version. After installing Buildozer successfully, let us  prepare the buildozer.spec file in order to build the Android application.   Preparing buildozer.spec File The project structure to be packaged into an Android application is given in Figure 8- 13.  There is a folder named FirstApp, which contains three files. The first file is named main. py, which is the Kivy application that was named FirstApp.py previously. The reason  it has been renamed is that when building the Android application, there must be a file  named main.py, which is the entrance of the application. This will not change anything  in the application.  Figure 8-13.  Project structure  It is preferred to check whether the Kivy application runs successfully before   proceeding the next steps. Just activate the Kivy virtual environment on your machine  and run the main.py Python file according to Figure 8-14. It is expected to work as in  Figure 8-11.  362   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-14.  Activating the Kivy virtual environment for running the Kivy  application  By this point, a Kivy desktop application has been created successfully. We can now   start preparing the missing file buildozer.spec and build an Android application.  The buildozer.spec file can be simply and automatically generated using Buildozer.   After opening the Ubuntu terminal and navigating to the FirstApp directory in which  the application Python and KV files exist, issue the following command:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ ahmedgad FirstApp$ buildozer init  After issuing this command, a confirmation message appears, as shown in to  Figure 8-15. Some of the important fields of that file are listed in Listing 8-15. For  example, the title represents the application title; source directory refers to the root  directory of the application in which the main.py file exists, which is set in this case  as the current directory; app version; Python and Kivy versions; orientation, that is,  whether the application appears in full screen or not; and application requirements,  which is just set to kivy. If we use a library supported by P4A such as NumPy, then  we need to list it beside kivy in order to load it into the application. The permissions  property represents the requested permissions by the application. You can also hard-  code the paths of both SKD and NDK if they already exist on your machine to save time  downloading them. Note that the  character before a line indicates it is a comment.  The presplash.filename property is used to specify the image path that appears when  loading the application before being started. The icon.filename property is assigned  the file name of an image to be used as the application icon.  363   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-15.  Creating the buildozer.spec file successfully  These fields are inside the [app] section of the specification file. You can also   edit the specification file to change whatever fields you see as worth modifying. The  package.domain property is by default set to org.test, which is used just for testing, not  production. If this value is left as is, it will prevent the building of the application.  Listing 8-15.

Building Android Application Using Buildozer After preparing all project files, Buildozer uses them to produce the APK file. For  development, we can produce a debug version of the application using the following  command:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ ahmedgad FirstApp$ buildozer android release  Figure 8-16 shows the response when the command is entered. When building the   application for the first time, Buildozer has to download all of the required dependencies  such as SDK, NDK, and P4A. Buildozer saves a lot of effort by downloading and installing  them automatically. Based on your Internet connection, the process might take time  before everything is up and running; be patient.  Figure 8-16.  Installing dependencies required by Buildozer to build the Android  application  After the installation has been done successfully, there are two folders created. The  first one is named .buildozer; it represents all files downloaded by Buildozer necessary  for building the application. The second folder is named bin; it stores the APK files  produced after building the application. We can transfer the APK file to an Android  device to install and test it. The screen of the Android application is shown in Figure 8- 17.  365   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-17.  Running the Android application  If an Android device is connected and recognized by the machine, Buildozer could   both produce the APK file and install it once produced on the machine according to this  command:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ ahmedgad FirstApp$ buildozer android debug deploy run  After building a basic Android application based on the Python Kivy application,   we can start building more advanced applications. Not all Kivy applications running on  desktops can work directly on mobile devices. Some libraries might not be supported  to be packaged into the mobile application. For example, P4A only supports a set of  libraries that could be used in the Android application. If you used an unsupported  library, the application crashes.  Kivy is supported by P4A, which can build the application UI exactly the same  as we discussed previously. P4A also supported other libraries such as NumPy, PIL,  dateutil, OpenCV, Pyinius, Flask, and more. The restriction when building an Android  application using Python is to only use the set of supported libraries by P4A. In the   366   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  next section, we will discuss how to build an Android application from the application  created in Chapter 3 for recognizing the Fruits 360 dataset images.   Image Recognition on Android The application created in Chapter 3 extracts features from the Fruits 360 dataset, which  used for training an ANN. In Chapter 7, a Flask application was created to access it from  the Web. In this chapter, we will discuss how to package it into an Android application  that runs offline where features are extracted on device.  The first thing to think about is whether the libraries used in this application are   supported by P4A. The libraries used are as follows:              scikit-image for reading the original RGB image and converting it  into HSV.  NumPy for extracting the features  i.e., hue histogram , building the  ANN layers, and making predictions.  pickle for restoring the best weights for the network trained using  GA and indices of the selected feature elements.  From the used libraries, P4A only supports NumPy. Neither scikit-image and  pickle are supported. As a result, we have to find alternative libraries supported by  P4A to replace these two libraries. The available choices for replacing scikit-image are  OpenCV and PIL. We just need a library to read the image file and convert it to HSV and  no more. OpenCV has more features than the two required ones. Packaging this library  into the Android application will increase its size. For this reason, PIL is used because it  is simpler.  Regarding pickle, we can replace it with NumPy. NumPy can save and load variables in  a file with the .npy extension. For this reason, the weights and selected element indices  will be saved into .npy files in order to read them using NumPy.  The project structure is illustrated in Figure 8-18. The Fruits.py file contains the  function required for extracting features from the test image, and predicting its label.  These functions are almost identical to the previous ones in Chapter 3 except for using  NumPy rather than pickle and PIL rather than scikit-image. The implementation of this  file is given in Listing 8-16.  367   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  The extract_features   function has an argument representing the image file path.   It reads it using PIL and converts it into HSV color space using the convert method.  This method accepts the HSV string specifying that the image is to be converted into  HSV. After that, the extract_features   method extracts the features, filters the feature  elements based on the selected indices’ .npy file, and finally returns them. The predict_ outputs   function is made to accept the weights .npy file path and then read it using  NumPy, classify the image based on the ANN, and return the classification label.  Figure 8-18.

It’s worth mentioning that the font size of both the label and button widgets  is increased using the font_size property. Also, the classify_image   method is called  in response to the button widget on_press event.  Listing 8-17.  KV File of the Fruits Recognition Application  BoxLayout:     orientation: "vertical"     Label:         text: "Predicted Class Appears Here."         font_size: 30         id: label     BoxLayout:         orientation: "horizontal"  369   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations          Image:             source: "apple.jpg"             id: img     Button:         text: "Classify Image."         font_size: 30         on_press: app.classify_image    The implementation of the classify_image   method is available inside the main.  py file according to Listing 8-18. This method loads the path of the image to be classified  from the source property of the image widget. This path is passed to the extract_ features   function inside the Fruits module as an argument. The predict_output    function accepts both the extracted features, ANN weights, and the activation function.  It returns the classification label after matrix multiplication between the inputs of each  layer and its weights. The label is then printed on the label widget.  Listing 8-18.

After running the application and pressing the  button, the image is classified; the result is shown in Figure 8-19. After making sure the  application is running successfully, we can start building the Android application.  Figure 8-19.  The result of running the Kivy application after classifying an image  Before building the application using Buildozer, the buildozer.spec file must be  generated. You can use the buildozer init command to create it automatically. It is  important to note that inside the application, we use two.npy files representing the  filtered element indices and the weights. We need to include them into the APK file.  How can we do that? Inside the buildozer.spec file, there is a property named source. include_exts. It accepts the extensions of all files we need to include into the APK file  separated by commas. These files are located at the root of the application. For example,  to add the files with extensions py, npy, kv, png, and jpg, the property will be as follows:  source.include_exts = py,png,jpg,kv ,npy  Two critical steps for the successful execution of the application are converting   the RGB image into HSV using the PIL and matrix multiplication using the matmul    function inside NumPy. Take care to use the versions of the libraries that offer these  functionalities.  371   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Regarding the conversion from RGB to HSV, make sure to use the new version of  PIL called Pillow. It is just an extension to PIL that could be imported and used with  no difference. Regarding the matrix multiplication, it is only supported in NumPy  version 1.10.0 and higher. Take care not to use a lower version. This leaves an additional  question, which is how to tell P4A that we need to use a specific version of a library. One  way is to specify the required version inside the P4A recipe corresponding to NumPy.  These recipes are located in the P4A installation directory under Buildozer installation.  For example, version 1.10.1 is used according to Figure 8-20. Based on the specified  version, the library will be downloaded from Python package index  PyPI  and installed  automatically when building the application. Note that preparing the environment of  Kivy for Android is harder than its usage. We are living in an era in which preparing the  development environment is harder than the development itself.  Figure 8-20.  Specifying the version of NumPy to be installed  Now we are ready to build the Android application. We can use the command   buildozer android debug deploy run for building, installing, the running the  application on a connected Android device to the development machine. We can also  use the logcat tool to print debugging information about the device. Just add this word  at the end of the command. After the building has been done successfully, the Android  application UI will be as shown in Figure 8-21.  372   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-21.  UI of the Android application used to classify images of the Fruits  360 dataset   CNN on Android In section Building a CNN using NumPy from Scratch of Chapter 5, we created a  project for building CNN from scratch using NumPy. In this section, this project will be  packaged into an Android application to execute the CNN on the device. The project  structure is illustrated in Figure 8-22. The numpycnn.py file holds all functions discussed  in Chapter 5 for building the CNN layers. The main application file named main.py has  its child class named NumPyCNNApp. This is why the KV file should be named numpycnn. kv. The buildozer.spec file is similar to what we discussed previously. We will just  discuss the main file and its KV file briefly. It is expected that most of this part of the  project will be clear based on the previous discussion across the chapter.  373   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-22.  Project structure for running CNN on Android  We will start by the KV file in Listing 8-19. The root widget is a vertical BoxLayout that  has two child GridLayout widgets. The first GridLayout widget displays both the original  image and the result of the last layer in the CNN. It is divided equally to hold two vertical  child BoxLayout widgets. Each layout has label and image widgets. The label just makes  it indicate where the original and result images are.  The second child of the root widget, GridLayout, has three widgets. The first one is a  Button that executes the CNN when pressed by calling the start_cnn   method inside  the main Python file. The second one is a Label that prints the size of the result after  executing all CNN layers. Finally, the third child is a TextInput widget, which allows  the user to specify the architecture of the CNN as a text. For example, conv2,pool,relu  means that the network consists of three layers: the first one is a conv layer with four  filters, the second one is an average pooling layer, and the third one is a ReLU layer.  When the application runs, it has the UI shown in Figure 8-23.  Listing 8-19.

The entry point for  this file is the start_cnn   method. It reads the image path from the Image widget and  reads it using PIL as we discussed in the previous example. For simplicity, the image is  converted into gray using the convert   method. The character L converts the image  into gray. After pressing the Button widget, this function runs a background thread that  executes the CNN according to the structure specified in the TextInput. The result of the  last layer is returned to the refresh_GUI   method. This method displays the first matrix  of the result on the UI window.  Figure 8-23.

That method starts by splitting   the text retrieved from the TextInput to return each layer separately. Based on if  statements, the suitable function from the numpycnn.py file is called to build the specified  CNN layer. For example, if the current string is relu, then the relu function will be called.  The number appended to the conv string is used as an argument specifying the number of  filters. The shape of all filters is 3×3. They are filled randomly. If there is an unrecognized  string, the application displays a message on the Label to indicate there is something  wrong with the inputs. After this function finishes execution, it returns to the refresh_ GUI   method. It displays the first matrix returned and prints its size on the Label.  A modified version of this application allows running all three successive conv, pool,  and ReLU layers and shows results returned by all of them. Based on the first three layers   two filters, conv layer with two filters followed by pooling and then ReLU , all returned  results are given in Figure 8-24.  378   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-24.

It can be prepared according to  our previous discussion. After creating it successfully, we can start building it using  Buildozer as we did previously. The UI of the application after running it on an Android  device is given in Figure 8-25.  379   Chapter 8    Cross-platform Data sCienCe appliCations  Figure 8-25.  Running Kivy application for executing CNN on Android devices  380    APPENDIX A  Installing Your Own  Projects Using pip Installer  Most of us have worked with several languages such as Java, C++, and Python and  created a number of projects, but unfortunately, these projects are possibly buried  and no one knows about them. Why not make these projects live online? Distributing  projects is very easy with Python. We can benefit from the implementation of CNN using  NumPy in Chapter 5 to make it available for everyone looking to do the same job. This appendix discusses the steps required to package your Python projects,   distribute them in distribution formats using setuptools, upload them into the PyPI  repository using twine, and finally install them using Python installers such as pip and  conda. This appendix starts with a very simple Python project called “printmsg”, which  has a simple function to print a message when called.  We are going to discuss the following points:     Creating a Simple Python Project.     How Does Python Locate Libraries?     Manual Installation by Copying Project Files to site-packages.     How Do Python Installers Locate Libraries?     Preparing the Package and Its Files  __init__.py and setup.py .     Distributing the Package.

Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A. F. Gad, Practical Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning with CNNs,   https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-4167-7  381   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  The platform used is Linux Ubuntu 18.04 with Python 3.6.5, but you can use other   platforms such as Windows with little or no difference in the commands used. Let’s see  how things work.   Creating a Simple Python Project Let us create a very simple project and distribute it. To be able to package and distribute  any Python project, there must be an associated folder containing all of the required files  for the project. The folder name will later be the project name.   Project Structure This project will have just a single level containing a single Python file. The project  structure is available in Figure A-1.  Figure A-1.  Simple project structure  The used project folder name is “printmsg” to reflect its use. The Python file inside it  is named “print_msg_file.py”. The Python file contains a function and a variable. The  function is named “print_msg_func”, and it will print a message once called. Because  most of the existing projects contain some variables to reflect their properties such as the  version, there is a variable named “version” that holds the version of the project.   Project Implementation The implementation of the “print_msg_file.py” file is given in Listing A-1. The first line  defines the version of the project using a variable named “__version__”. The “print_ msg_func  ” function prints a hello message when called. It is good practice to handle  the situations at which the Python file is called as the main file or not. This is the job of  the “if” statement at the end of the file using the built-in special variable “__name__”.   382   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  When a Python file is executed as the main program, then the “__name__” variable is set  equal to “__main__”. In case that file is used within a module, the “__name__” variable  is set to the module name. The if statement ensures that the file is not imported within  another module and then calls the “print_msg_func  ” to print the hello message.  Listing A-1.  Implementation of print_msg_file.py  __version__ = "1.0"  def print_msg_func  :     print "Hello Python Packaging"   if __name__ == "__main__":     print_msg_func     Running the Project After completing such a simple project, the next step is to execute it to ensure that  everything is running well. A Python file is to be executed from either the Linux terminal  or Windows command prompt by issuing the Python command followed by the location  of the file. Figure A-2 shows how to run the Python file using both Windows and Ubuntu.  Note that the project folder is saved into the Desktop.  Figure A-2.  Running the module as the main program  The CMD terminal are opened in the "printmsg" directory. Its content is displayed   using the “ls” command. Just the target file "print_msg_file.py" exists there. The  Python command is issued to run the file.  383   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr   Importing the Module into a File Inside Its Directory After making sure everything is working well, it is possible to import that project into  another Python file in order to be able to call its content. If a file to be imported into  another, a legacy way for doing this is to create another file inside the same directory of  that file. Note that it is not required to be in the same directory, but it will be simple in this  case to avoid long paths. For example, another Python file named "inside_project.py"  imports the project and calls its function according to Listing A-2.  Listing A-2.  Importing a Module and Calling Its Functions  import print_msg_file print_msg_file.print_msg_func    The project is imported as in line 1. Then, it is used to call its function in line 2. After  opening the terminal and setting its current directory to the “printmsg” folder, the new  file "inside_project.py" can be executed as in Figure A-3. The function got called  successfully.  Figure A-3.  Importing the module successfully inside another file   Importing the Module into a File Outside Its  Directory Because the imported module is in the same directory of the script it is called from, the  process is straightforward. Just type the name of the module in an import statement.  But an important question now arises: What if the script calling the file is in a different  directory than the module it would like to import? Let us try to create another Python file  not located in the same directory of the imported module and try to import the module  again. The file is named “outside_project.py” and is located in the desktop. In other   384   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  words, that file is located one level up compared to the module. It has the same code  used in the previous file, “inside_project.py”. After running this file from the terminal,  the result is shown in Figure A-4.  Figure A-4.  Unable to locate the module in a different directory  The module is not found because the file and the module to be imported are in   different directories. The file is located in the “~ Desktop ” directory, and the module  is located in “~ Desktop printmsg ” directory. To solve that issue, the printmsg is  appended to the name of the module to make the interpreter know where it can find the  module as given in Listing A-3.  Listing A-3.  Appending Module Name When Importing the Function  import printmsg.print_msg_file printmsg.print_msg_file.print_msg_func    The result of executing the “outside_project.py” file is shown in Figure A-5.  Figure A-5.  Successfully locating the module after locating it correctly within the  import statement  385   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  But appending the folder name in the path from the file to the module it imports is  tiresome, especially if the file is away from the module in more than one level. To solve  this issue, let’s learn how the Python interpreter locates its imported libraries.   How Does Python Locate Libraries? When the Python interpreter encounters an import statement, it searches in some of its  directories for that imported library. If it is not found in any of those directories, then it  will raise an error as in Figure A-4.  There are multiple sources of such paths that are searched for a given library. For   example, paths can be inside the PYTHONHOME or PYTHONPATH environment  variables, current script directory, and the site-packages directory. The list of all  directories that Python searches in is listed in the path property of the sys built-in  module. It can be printed according to Listing A-4.  Listing A-4.  Printing List of Search Directories  import sys print sys.path   The sys.path list is printed using the terminal, and the result is shown in Figure A-6.  Figure A-6.  Search paths that Python uses to locate a module  In our example, the module is not located in any of the directories listed in sys.path,  and this is why an exception is thrown. We can fix that by moving the library into one of  these paths. The directory that will be used is the site-packages directory. The reason is  that the installed libraries using pip or conda are added to that directory. Let us see how  to add our project into that directory manually.  386   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr   Manual Installation by Copying Project Files to   Site- Packages In Figure A-5, the site-packages directory is listed as a search path for imported libraries.  By simply copying and pasting the project directory “printmsg” inside the site-packages  directory, the print_msg_file module can be imported. Figure A-7 shows that the  printmsg project is copied into site-packages.  Figure A-7.  Copying the project into the site-packages directory to make it  locatable by Python  Based on the previous two lines in Listing A-3, the “outside_project.py” file can   now successfully import the project and print the output as in Figure A-5. In this case,  the imported module print_msg_file is prepended by the directory of the project  “printmsg”, but this will be valid wherever the “outside_project.py” file is located.  387   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr   How Do Python Installers Locate Libraries? Up to this point, in order to import the project successfully, it should be copied manually  inside the site-packages directory. Before doing that, the project must be copied to the  machine in some way, such as by being downloaded from any file hosting server. But all  of the work is manual. Some users will find such work tiresome to do for every library  they are to install. As a result, there is an alternative way of installing libraries.  Some installers such as pip and conda are available to receive the library name and   they take care of downloading and installing it automatically. But how can we make our  own libraries accessible by these installers?  The installers search for the libraries inside software repositories such as PyPI. Once  found, they download and install them automatically. Our question now should be how  to upload our own libraries to these repositories. These software repositories accept  distribution formats such as Wheel.  Then, the next question will be how to prepare our project into Wheel distribution   format. In order to generate the Wheel distribution format, there are a number of  files to be packaged together. These files include the actual project Python files, any  supplemental files required by those files, and also some helper files to give some details  about your project.  The sequence to be followed is to prepare the package files, generate the distribution  files, and upload the files to the PyPI repository. These points will be covered in the next  sections.   Preparing the Package and Its Files  __init__.py  and setup.py  The first step is to structure the package and its files. The structure of the package will be  as shown in Figure A-8.  Figure A-8.  Project structure prepared for use by the Python installers  388   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  There is a root directory holding all files and directories of the package. Inside that   root directory, there is another directory named “printmsg” that holds the Python file to  be imported later after being installed.  For our simple example, the minimal files required will be used; these are __init__.py    and setup.py in addition to the actual project file print_msg_file.py. The next step is to  prepare these files.   __init__.py The first file to prepare is the __init__.py file. The main use of this file is to allow Python  to treat the directory as a package. When the package has the __init__.py file, the  package can be imported as a regular library after being installed by either installer. Just  its existence is enough even if empty. You might wonder why it is now required despite  being not when the library installed manually in the “Manual Installation by Copying  Project Files to Site-Packages” section. The answer is that the installer will not know that  the directory is a package without the __init__.py file. That is why it will not fetch the  library Python files  print_msg_file.py .  Assuming that the library is now accessible by Python installers and we successfully   installed it in Windows, there are two folders generated in the site-packages directory   “printmsg-1.4.dist-info” and “printmsg”  as in Figure A-9 in the case of using the  __init__.py file.  Figure A-9.  Project directories created within the site-packages directory  389   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  The “printmsg” folder is what holds the Python files to be imported later. If the __  init__.py file is not used, then the “printmsg” folder will not be found. As a result, it will  become impossible to use the Python code because it will be missing.  Besides telling Python that the directory is a Python package, the __init__.py file is  the first file to be loaded when the module is imported and thus can do initializations.   setup.py After marking the directory as a package using the __init__.py file, the next step is to  add more details about the package. This is why the setup.py file is used. The setup.py  script is what gives details about your project, such as what dependencies are required to  make your project run. This script uses the setuptools distribution tool for building the  distribution files to be uploaded later to PyPI. Listing A-5 has the content of the setup.py  file in order to distribute the project.  Listing A-5.  Content of setup.py File  import setuptools  setuptools.setup      name="printmsg",     version="1.6",     author="Ahmed Gad",     author_email="ahmed.f.gad@gmail.com",     description="Test Package for Printing a Message"   That file contains a number of fields that hold details such as the name of the   package, version, author, author_email, short description to appear on PyPI, and  others. There are many other fields that could be used based on your needs.  Note that the package name is used currently in two positions. One time for the   module directory and another here in the setup.py file. Must they be equivalent? The  answer is NO. Each one has its own job, but there is no dependency between them. The  name used in the setup.py file is the name to be used when installing the package. The  name of the directory is the name used to import the module. If they are different, then  the package will be installed by a name and imported by a different name. There should  be consistency between these two names to avoid confusing package users.  390   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr   Distributing the Package After preparing the package, we are ready to distribute it. Before actual distribution, we  should make sure that the dependencies required are already existing. To distribute the  project, setuptools and wheel projects are required to be installed. The wheel project  is used to generate the wheel distribution format. Make sure they are installed and  updated as in Figure A-10 according to this command:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ Desktop root$ pip install --user --upgrade   setuptools wheel  Figure A-10.  Install the required packages for packaging the project  Then we can distribute the package by running the setup.py file as in Figure A-11.   After opening the terminal, make the root of the package the current directory and then  execute the setup.py file.  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ Desktop root$ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel  391   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  Figure A-11.  Generating source and wheel distributions of the project  sdist is used to generate a source distribution format, while bdist_wheel generates   the wheel built distribution format. Both of these distributions are provided for  compatibility with different users.  After executing the setup.py file, you can expect to get some new directories inside   the root of the package. The files and directories inside the root are shown in Figure A-12.  392   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  Figure A-12.  Generated files and directories of the project  The most important folder is the dist folder, because it contains the distribution files  that will be uploaded to PyPI. Its content is presented in Figure A-13. It contains the .whl  file, which is the build distribution, and also the source distribution .tar.gz file.  Figure A-13.  Source and wheel distribution files of the project  After preparing the distribution files, the next step is to upload them to PyPI.   Uploading the Distribution Files Online to Test PyPI There are two Python package repositories to use. One of them, Test PyPI  test.pypi. org , is for testing and experimentation, and the other, PyPI  pypi.org , is for real index.  Their uses are similar, but we can start using Test PyPI.  Before uploading to Test PyPI, you should register yourself to get a username and   password for uploading your packages. Just register by your active e-mail address, where  a confirmation will be received to activate your account. The registration link is https:   test.pypi.org account register .  393   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  After registration is complete, we can use the twine utility for uploading package   distributions to Test PyPI. You should make sure it is installed and upgraded according  to the following command:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ Desktop root$ pip install --upgrade twine  Once it is installed, you can upload packages to Test PyPI. Open the terminal, make   sure you are currently on the root of the package, and issue the following command:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ Desktop root$ twine upload --repository-url https:   test.pypi.org legacy  dist *  You will be asked to enter your Test PyPI username and password. Once you are   verified, the upload will start. The result is shown in Figure A-14.  Figure A-14.  Uploading the project into Test PyPI using twine  After uploading the files successfully, you can open your profile at Test PyPI to   see your uploaded projects. Figure A-15 shows that the printmsg project successfully  becomes live. Note that the value used for the description field inside the setup.py file is  now appearing on the repository.  394   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr  Figure A-15.  The project is successfully uploaded to Test PyPI.   Installing the Distributed Package from Test PyPI By this point, you have successfully packaged and distributed your Python project. It is  available now for download by any user connected to the Internet. To install the project  using pip, just issue the following command. The result is shown in Figure A-16.  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ Desktop root$ pip install --index-url https:  test.pypi. org simple  printmsg  Figure A-16.  Installing the project uploaded to Test PyPI using pip  395   APPENDIX A    INstAllINg Your owN ProjEcts usINg PIP INstAllEr   Importing and Using the Installed Package After installing the project, it can be imported. The code in Listing A-3 can now be  executed. The difference is using the package installed from Test PyPI repository rather  than the one that is manually installed. The result is identical to what is shown in   Figure A-4.   Using PyPI Rather Than Test PyPI If you decided to put your project into the real PyPI, then you will just repeat the  previous steps with few changes. At first, you have to register at https:  pypi.org  and  get a username and a password. I hate to say so, but you will have to register AGAIN  because registration in Test PyPI is different from registration in PyPI.  The first change is not using the --repository-url option with twine because  PyPI is the default repository for uploading packages. So, the command required   will be as follows:  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ Desktop root $ twine upload dist *  Similarly, the second change is omitting the --index-url option with pip for the same   reason  PyPI is the default repository when installing a package :  ahmed-gad@ubuntu:~ Desktop root$ pip install printmsg  396   Index  A Adaptive SFFS  ASFFS , 41 ANN optimization DL models, 129 GA  see Genetic algorithm  GA   hyperparameter, 130 initial values, 130 KNN algorithm, 130 NSGA-II  see Non-dominated sorting   genetic algorithm II  NSGA-II    parameters, 129 single-vs. multiobjective  bionics, 133 book publisher, 130 possible solutions, 131–132 variables, 131, 133 wastepaper, 132–133  Application program interface  API , 207 Artificial neural networks  ANNs   description, 45 implementation  architecture, 120 complete code, 123–125 matrix multiplications, inputs and   weights, 120–123 training data, 126 train_network, 126  reinforcement learning, 45 semisupervised learning, 45 supervised learning, 45–46  B Backpropagation algorithm, ANNs  activation function, 66–67 error functions, 67 forward vs. backward passes  activation functions, 69 chain partial derivatives, 73–75 derivative magnitude  DM , 76 derivative sign, 76 partial derivatives, 70–72 prediction errors, 70 updating weights, 76–77  initial parameters, 65 inputs and parameters, 66 network structure, 64–65 NN with hidden layer  network architecture, 77–78 neuron, 78–80 partial derivatives, 80–83, 85–87 prediction error, 80 updating weights, 88  training data, 65 weights update equation, 67–69  regularization technique, 46  Bionics, 133    Ahmed Fawzy Gad 2018  A.

Deploy deep learning applications into production across multiple platforms. You will work on computer vision applications that use the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model and Python. This book starts by explaining the traditional machine-learning pipeline, where you will analyze an image dataset. Along the way you will cover artificial neural networks (ANNs), building one from scratch in Python, before optimizing it using genetic algorithms. For automating the process, the book highlights the limitations of traditional hand-crafted features for computer vision and why the CNN deep-learning model is the state-of-art solution. CNNs are discussed from scratch to demonstrate how they are different and more efficient than the fully connected ANN (FCNN). You will implement a CNN in Python to give you a full understanding of the model. After consolidating the basics, you will use TensorFlow to build a practical image-recognition model that you will deploy to a web server using Flask, making it accessible over the Internet. Using Kivy and NumPy, you will create cross-platform data science applications with low overheads. This book will help you apply deep learning and computer vision concepts from scratch, step-by-step from conception to production
