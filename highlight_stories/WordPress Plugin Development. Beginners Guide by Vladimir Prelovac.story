From  making the site easier to administer, to adding the odd tweak or new feature, to completely  changing the way your blog works; plugins are the method WordPress offers to customize  and extend its functionality. This book will show you how to build all sorts of WordPress  plugins: admin plugins, Widgets, plugins that alter your post output, present custom "views"  of your blog, and more.  This book focuses on teaching you all aspects of modern WordPress development and usage.  The book uses real and published WordPress plugins and follows their creation from the  idea to the finishing touches, in a series of carefully picked, easy-to-follow tutorials. You will  discover how to use the WordPress API in all typical situations, from displaying output on   the site in the beginning to turning WordPress into a CMS in the last chapter. In Chapters   2 to 7, you will develop six concrete plugins and conquer all aspects of WordPress   plugin development.  Each new chapter and each new plugin introduces different features of WordPress and how  to put them to good use, allowing you to gradually advance your knowledge. This book is  written as a guide to take your WordPress skills from the very beginning to the level where  you are able to completely understand how WordPress works and how you can use it to   your advantage.   This is a Packt Beginners Guide, which means it focuses on practical examples and has a   fast-paced but friendly approach, with the opportunity to learn by experimentation and play.  Each chapter builds a practical plugin from the ground up using step-by-step instructions.  Individual sections show you how to code some functionality into your plugin and follow up  with a discussion of concepts.   Preface  What This Book Covers  Chapter 1 teaches the advantages of WordPress development, and what WordPress has to  offer to plugin authors.

Chapter 3 explores more cool things we can do with WordPress by livening up the default  WordPress blogroll. The purpose of the plugin is to display the most recent posts from the  sites listed in the blogroll using a nice pop-up window.  Chapter 4 uses the mixed approach, by taking advantage of creative WordPress and  JavaScript techniques, in order to create an Ajax powered 'Wall’ for your blog’s sidebar.  It introduces quite a few interesting techniques such as Widgets, interacting with the  WordPress Database, and Ajax form submission.

[  ]    1  Preparing for WordPress  Development  If you are holding this book in your hands now, you are probably aware—in one way or the  other—of the tremendous success WordPress platform has seen over the past few years. It  has become the most widespread blogging and publishing platform in the world today.  When I first installed WordPress, I was still looking around for a platform to start my personal  site and also for an opportunity to do more online development work.  After seeing the simple installation procedure  which takes just a few minutes , I realized that  the guys behind WordPress are on to something big. It has indeed proven to be so, and   as the days passed by, I have enjoyed every aspect of WordPress—publishing, social,   and development.  And I am thrilled to share these nits and bits of WordPress development information with  you, showing you the power and flexibility that allowed WordPress to become so popular.  How will you benefit?  Thanks to its open source architecture, ease of use, and customization possibilities,  WordPress has succeeded in differentiating itself from other weblog publishing platforms  weblog publishing platforms weblog publishing platforms  and even other open source solutions.  WordPress features The main WordPress features of interest to developers are:  of interest to developers are: of interest to developers are:        Its a huge community of users and developers The millions of WordPress blogs  blogs blogs Major sites using it, including a number of US government agencies   Preparing for WordPress Development              Security issues treated almost instantly  issues treated almost instantly issues treated almost instantly Unmatched flexibility with thousands of available plugins  flexibility with thousands of available plugins flexibility with thousands of available plugins High level of customizability with thousands of available themes  of available themes available themes Search engine friendly functionalities Ease of use, maintenance, and upgrade  maintenance, and upgrade maintenance, and upgrade  and upgrade and upgrade A great way to meet new people!  With such a list, it is no wonder that—every day—more and more private users and nder that—every day—more and more private users and  companies are turning to WordPress for their publishing needs. This of course presents   a fertile ground for WordPress developers to show off their skills.  More sites means more opportunities The opportunity for a WordPress developer in these circumstances becomes obvious.  With such a huge number of sites running it, the market is hungry for WordPress experts,  and not just development experts. If you are proficient in the installation and setup of  WordPress, you may easily have your hands full of work.  Big players use it The fact that a number of major sites use WordPress means that there is also an opportunity  for high profile work.  This also means that you can be fairly certain about the future of WordPress. Your  investment in time and efforts, first in reading this book, and then in enhancing your  development skills, is likely to pay off with WordPress.  Urgent response to security issues With online security becoming a bigger issue each day, it is a relief to see the WordPress  development team reacting promptly to newly discovered security issues.  This makes everyone even more comfortable and confident in using WordPress.  Flexibility With WordPress, the plugin author is allowed total control over every aspect of the site.   You are able to completely customize the way the site looks and behaves.  The opportunity is there for everyone—from beginners  developing useful plugins    to professionals  creating total WordPress makeovers such as e-commerce, marketing,   or job portal sites—where you can hardly recognize that the site is running a   WordPress installation .  [  ]   Chapter 1  Search engines friendly Search Engine Optimization  SEO  is an important aspect of today's Internet presence.

This mix is rarely seen in any  other open source platforms.  After the five minute installation, most users immediately feel comfortable in the WordPress  administration panels. Writing a post and organizing categories is as simple as it should be.  The whole WordPress installation consists of putting the files on the server and setting the  assigned database, and it is very easy to back up or move it to another server.  WordPress and its plugins can be upgraded with a click of a button; all this makes the job of  maintaining a WordPress website  or even several at the same time , a breeze. or even several at the same time , a breeze.  Social aspect If you are a WordPress developer, the chances are that you will have your own hosted  WordPress blog. Having a personal blog creates a great opportunity to create many new  blog. Having a personal blog creates a great opportunity to create many new blog. Having a personal blog creates a great opportunity to create many new   contacts—both business and friends.

This will create awareness about you as a plugin author and your site as a probable source  for some cool stuff. Having in mind how difficult it is to get noticed on the Internet today, this  becomes a very important aspect of plugin development that you get for free.

Dogfooding WordPress plugins You may sometimes wish to create a plugin just for yourself, to fulfil a specific need that can  arise at a given moment. This is how I started writing plugins initially, as I needed certain  functionalities that were not available in WordPress at the time.  The term dogfooding describes a dog food company that is ready to eat its own dog food.  It means the company is confident about its own product and uses it for the purpose it was  produced for.  In WordPress' terms, it means that you should always strive to create a plugin that satisfies  terms, it means that you should always strive to create a plugin that satisfies terms, it means that you should always strive to create a plugin that satisfies  means that you should always strive to create a plugin that satisfies means that you should always strive to create a plugin that satisfies  your needs.

Support Good documentation goes a long way when it comes to support.  [ 11 ]   Preparing for WordPress Development  You can expect hundreds of user questions pouring in after you release a plugin. So, making  sure that you have a well written documentation will save you a lot of time in answering  those questions.  I will also give some practical tips on how to organize your plugin page.  Promotion Writing a good plugin that nobody knows about is a fruitless effort.  I will give you tips on how to promote your plugin once it is published. If you have created  a really useful plugin, you can expect a snowball effect when users start to write about it on  their blogs and tell their friends about it.

It will also give you some information regarding  WordPress MU development. Wordpress MU is a multi user version of WordPress that is  that is isis  becoming more popular each day.  Tools for the job  Before we get started, we need to have some tools set up, so let's go through a short   check list.  Whatever way you decide to set up your development environment, make sure you are  comfortable using it. Plugin development can be a full-time job, so make sure you enjoy it as  development can be a full-time job, so make sure you enjoy it as development can be a full-time job, so make sure you enjoy it as  much as you can!  you can! you can!  WordPress Obviously, we will need WordPress installed. It is advisable to have a separate version of  WordPress for development purposes  that is, do not use your blog as a testing ground; your   that is, do not use your blog as a testing ground; your  that is, do not use your blog as a testing ground; your  visitors will not like it very much . not like it very much . ike it very much .  To pre  r  r pare your local version, you can always download the latest version of WordPress from  http:  wordpress.org download .  Then you need to decide if you are going to host it on the Internet or locally. I prefer to have  it on Internet as I can easily show it to other people if necessary, no matter where I am at  that moment. The advantage of local installation is that it works much faster. You can of  course combine both.  both.  If you are going to set it up on your local computer, and you are using Windows, using  going to set it up on your local computer, and you are using Windows, using going to set it up on your local computer, and you are using Windows, using  EasyPHP    http:  www.easyphp.org  will make your job much easier. packages such as EasyPHP    make your job much easier. make your job much easier.

There also are other text editors that are available for free,  such as, Netbeans IDE for PHP, Zend Studio, and so on. Netbeans IDE for PHP, Zend Studio, and so on.  FTP client The second thing you will need to have is an FTP client. Uploading plugins can be a boring  job if you do it from the FTP command line; so visual FTP client is advisable.   For this matter, I've been using Total Commander as a proven tool. Again, you might have  your own preference.  Web browser F nally, since we are developing web based software, we will need a web browser. You will be  spending a lot of time in the browser window; so make sure you are comfortable with it.  I do not want to instigate browser wars at this moment, but there is one browser that is very want to instigate browser wars at this moment, but there is one browser that is very  flexible and has tons of add-ons, much like WordPress in that respect, and that is Firefox.  of add-ons, much like WordPress in that respect, and that is Firefox.  much like WordPress in that respect, and that is Firefox. much like WordPress in that respect, and that is Firefox.  There are some pretty cool add-ons for Firefox that can really increase productivity to the add-ons for Firefox that can really increase productivity to the  level of rapid web development. This step is optional if you do not use Firefox, but I would  nevertheless recommend giving it a try.  it a try.  Firebug The most important Firefox add-on we want to install is called Firebug  you can download it  from http:  getfirebug.com .  [ 17 ]   Preparing for WordPress Development  Firebug allows you to preview, edit and debug CSS, HTML, JavaScript and Ajax requests  in real time. This is really a great time saver. For example, when it comes to debugging,  JavaScript or misaligned CSS can be really troublesome, without the use of features   provided by Firebug.  In the next picture, you can see an example of Firebug in action, debugging JavaScript with a  breakpoint in the execution of the script.  [ 1 ]   Ubiquity This is an add-on produced by Mozilla Labs and it can do a lot of fancy stuff. But for   our purposes, we are going to use it for two simple things—fast search of PHP and purposes, we are going to use it for two simple things—fast search of PHP and   purposes, we are going to use it for two simple things—fast search of PHP and WordPress documentation.  documentation. documentation.

PHP Search: http:  npattison.com ubiquity ubiq_php.html WP Codex Search: http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir ubiquity- plugins wp-codex-search  The way these two Ubiquity commands work is that when you press Ubiquity commands work is that when you press  work is that when you press Ctrl and Space  n   the browser  this opens Ubiquity window  and then type biquity window  and then type y window  and then type php search_phrase or wp  search_phrase, it takes you immediately to the PHP or WordPress documentation   for the given phrase.   The amount of time this can save is huge, especially if you need to take a peek at the  documentation every minute or so like I do  I can't keep everything in my head! .

Also I'll mention a handy tip for quickly accessing code examples.  [ 21 ]   Preparing for WordPress Development  Installing and managing plugins When you want to install a plugin, you need to follow these simple steps:  1.  Upload the plugin folder  for example wp-wall  to your server's   wp-content plugins  folder.  [ 22 ]   Chapter 1  2.  Go to your WordPress administration section, and select Plugins from the menu. This  will give you a list of all the installed plugins. Scroll down the list until you find yours,  and click Activate.  If you intend to manually update the plugin files on a live site, it is advisable to deactivate the  plugin first using the Plugins menu.  Strictly speaking, on a development blog where you are the only user, this can be skipped to  save time..  If something goes wrong with the plugin, and you are unable to access wrong with the plugin, and you are unable to access   your WordPress site anymore, deleting the plugin folder from the server   will deactivate the plugin automatically, and will instantly get your site  get your site   working again.  If you need more information regarding plugin management, you can refer to the latest  WordPress manual found at http:  codex.wordpress.org Managing_Plugins.  Searching documentation During the plugin development, you will more or less need to refer to documentation.  Luckily, you will have this book on your hand either in paper or in a PDF form, so you can will have this book on your hand either in paper or in a PDF form, so you can  take a quick look. Then, you also have the WordPress online documentation found at , you also have the WordPress online documentation found at  http:  codex.wordpress.org Main_Page.  Due to the rapid speed at which WordPress has been developing, not all the functions have  been documented.  So, I keep a copy of the latest version of WordPress locally. This way, I am able to find the  reference to the function in the WordPress core quickly, and figure out how it is used.  [ 23 ]   Preparing for WordPress Development  I also tend to keep a local copy of the entire plugin repository on my computer  you can find  more details on how to do that in Chapter 8  so that I can search through the entire plugin  repository and find instances of this function used by other plugin authors  and you can  always find new and creative uses as well .  and creative uses as well .     [ 24 ]   Using other plugins for this purpose can really save a lot of time, and it is often the easiest purpose can really save a lot of time, and it is often the easiest  way to learn how to perform certain functionalities..  Chapter 1  Summary  We learned about the advantages of WordPress development, and what WordPress has to  offer to plugin authors. We have also seen that there are certain challenges along the way,  which we will address in this book.  The six plugins that we will create in the following chapters will show you exactly how to  create a WordPress plugin from scratch and have it perform the concrete functionality you  need, whether it's on the front page or in the administration backend.  Having armed ourselves with useful development tools, we are ready to start developing  some cool WordPress plugins!  [ 25 ]    2  Social Bookmarking  I hope the first chapter got you warmed up and prepared for WordPress plugin development,  and that you are as eager to start as I am.   In this chapter, we will create our first functional WordPress plugin and learn how to interact  with the WordPress API  this is the WordPress interface to PHP  on the way. The knowledge  you will gain in this chapter alone will allow you to write a lot of similar plugins.  Let's get moving! In this chapter, you will learn:              Creating a new plugin and having it displayed in the plugins admin panel Checking the WordPress version and control activation of the plugin Accessing API features—for example the title and permalink URL of each post Using WordPress hooks to execute your plugin code when it's needed Using conditional tags to control the flow of your plugins  You will learn these by:  Creating a 'social bookmarking' type of plugin that adds a Digg button to each post  on your blog  As you probably know, Digg is a very popular service for promoting interesting content on  the Internet. The purpose of a Digg button on your blog is to make it easier for Digg users to  vote for your article and also to bring in more visitors to your blog.   Social Bookmarking  The plugin we'll create in this chapter will automatically insert the necessary code to each of  your posts. So let's get started with WordPress plugin development!  Plugging in your first plugin  Usually, the first step in plugin creation is coming up with a plugin name. We usually want to  use a name that is associated with what the plugin does, so we will call this plugin, WP Digg  This. WP is a common prefix used to name WordPress plugins.  To introduce the plugin to WordPress, we need to create a standard plugin header. This   will always be the first piece of code in the plugin file and it is used to identify the plugin   to WordPress.  Time for action – Create your first plugin In this example, we're going to write the code to register the plugin with WordPress ,  describe what the plugin does for the user, check whether  it works on the currently installed  version of WordPress, and to activate it.  1.     2.  Create a file called wp-digg-this.php in your favourite text editor. It is common  practice to use the plugin name as the name for the plugin file, with dashes '-'  instead of spaces. Next, add a plugin information header. The format of the header is always the same  and you only need to change the relevant information for every plugin: <?php  * Plugin Name: WP Digg This Version: 0.1 Description: Automatically adds Digg This button to your posts. Author: Vladimir Prelovac Author URI: http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir Plugin URI: http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir wordpress-plugins                       wp-digg-this     3.  Now add the code to check the WordPress version:       * Version check *  global $wp_version;      *  ?>        $exit_msg='WP Digg This requires WordPress 2.5 or newer.          Please      update! ';  [ 2 ]   Chapter 2  if  version_compare $wp_version,"2.5","<"   {     exit  $exit_msg ; }                 ?>  4.  Upload your plugin file to the wp-content plugins folder on your server using   5.	 Go to your WordPress Plugins admin panel. You should now see your plugin listed panel. You should now see your plugin listed   your FTP client.  among other plugins:  6.  This means we have just completed the necessary steps to display our plugin in   WordPress. Our plugin can be even activated now—although it does not do   anything useful  yet .  [ 2 ]   Social Bookmarking  What just happened? We created a working plugin template by using a plugin information header and the   version check code. The plugin header allows the plugin to be identified and displayed  properly in the plugins admin panel. The version check code will warn users of our plugin  who have older WordPress versions to upgrade their WordPress installation and prevent  compatibility problems.   The plugin information header To identify the plugin to WordPress, we need to include a plugin information header with  each plugin.  The header is written as a PHP comment and contains several fields with   important information.  This code alone is enough for the plugin to be registered, displayed in the admin panel and  readied for activation.  If your future plugin has more than one PHP file, the plugin information  should be placed only in your main file, the one which will include   or  require   the other plugin PHP files.  Checking WordPress versions To ensure that our plugin is not activated on incompatible WordPress versions, we will  perform a simple WordPress version check at the very beginning of our code.  WordPress provides the global variable $wp_version that provides the current WordPress  version in standard format. We can then use PHP function version_compare   to  compare this and our required version for the plugin, using the following code:  if  version_compare $wp_version,"2.6","<"   {        do something if WordPress version is lower then 2.6 }  If we want to stop the execution of the plugin upon activation, we can use the exit    function with the error message we want to show.  In our case, we want to show the required version information and display the link to the  WordPress upgrade site.  $exit_msg='WP Digg This requires WordPress 2.6 or newer. <a  href="http:  codex.wordpress.org Upgrading_WordPress">Please  update! ';  [ 30 ]   Chapter 2  if  version_compare $wp_version,"2.6","<"   {     exit  $exit_msg ; }  While being simple, this piece of code is also very effective. With the constant development  of WordPress, and newer versions evolving relatively often, you can use version checking to  prevent potential incompatibility problems.  The version number of your current WordPress installation can be found in the footer text   of the admin menu. To begin with, you can use that version in your plugin version check    for example 2.6 .  Later, when you learn about WordPress versions and their differences, you'll be able to  lower the version requirement to the minimal your plugin will be compatible with. This will  allow your plugin to be used on more blogs, as not all blogs always use the latest version of  WordPress.  Checking the plugin You can go ahead and activate the plugin. The plugin will be activated but will do nothing at  this moment.  Time for Action – Testing the version check Let's just make sure that the version check works, by requiring a fictional version of  WordPress that does not exist yet:  1.  Deactivate the plugin and change the version check code to a higher version. For  example, replace 2.6 with 5.0.  if  version_compare $wp_version,"5.0","<"      2.  Re-upload the plugin and try to activate it again. You will see a WordPress error and   a message from the plugin:  [ 31 ]   Social Bookmarking  What just happened? The version check fails and the plugin exits with our predefined error message. The same  thing will happen to a user trying to use your plugin with outdated WordPress installation,  requiring them to update to a newer version.  Have a go Hero We created a basic plugin that you can now customize.      Change the plugin description to include HTML formatting  add bold or links to   the description . Test your plugin to see what happens if you have two plugins with the same name   upload a copy of the file under a different name .  Displaying a Digg button  Now it's time to expand our plugin with concrete functionality and add a Digg link to every  post on our blog.  In order to create a link we will need to extract post's permalink URL, title, and description.  Luckily, WordPress provides us with a variety of ways to do this.  Time for Action – Implement a Digg link Let's create a function to display a Digg submit link using information from the post.  Then we will implement this function into our theme, to show the link just after the   post content.  1.  Add a function to our plugin to display a Digg link:                             * Show a Digg This link *  function WPDiggThis_Link   {     global $post;               get the URL to the post     $link=urlencode get_permalink $post->ID  ;             get the post title     $title=urlencode $post->post_title ;               get first 350 characters of post and strip it off                HTML tags  [ 32 ]   Chapter 2      $text=urlencode substr strip_tags $post->post_content ,                                                           0, 350  ;  }         create a Digg link and return it         return '<a href="http:  digg.com submit?url='.$link.'&amp;                 title='.$title.'&amp;bodytext='.$text.'">Digg This ';                   2.  Open your theme's single.php file and add a call to our function just below the  line with the_content  . If you are not sure how to do this, see the forthcoming  section on "Editing the theme files".  <?php if  function_exists WPDiggThis_Link   echo WPDiggThis_                                                          Link  ; ?> 3.  With the default WordPress theme, this change will look something like this  you can   also refer to the following image :  [ 33 ]   Social Bookmarking  4.  After you save the theme file, your blog posts will now automatically have the Digg   This link shown after the content:  5.  Clicking the link will take the user directly to the Digg site, with all the required   information already filled in:  Well done! You have created your first working WordPress plugin!  What just happened? When WordPress loads a post, the single.php template file from the currently active  WordPress theme is ran. We added a line to this file that calls our plugin function  WPDiggThis_Link   just after the content of the post is displayed:   Read the rest of this entry  &raquo; ' ; ?>  <?php if  function_exists WPDiggThis_Link   echo WPDiggThis_ Link  ; ?>  We use function_exists  to check our function because it exists only if our plugin is  installed and activated. PHP will generate an error if we try to run a nonexistent function. But  if we deactivate the plugin later, we don't want to cause errors with our theme. So, we make  sure that the function exists before we attempt to run it.  [ 34 ]   Chapter 2  Assuming that the plugin is present and activated, the WPDiggThis_Link   function from  our plugin is ran. The first part of the following function gets information about our post and  assigns it to variables:   * Show a Digg This link *  function WPDiggThis_Link   {     global $post;             get the URL to the post     $link=urlencode get_permalink $post->ID  ;             get the post title     $title=urlencode $post->post_title ;             get first 350 characters of post and strip it off HTML tags     $text=urlencode substr strip_tags $post->post_content ,                                                    0, 350  ;  We use the urlencode   PHP function for all the parameters that we will pass to the final  link. This will ensure that all the values are formatted properly.  The second part uses this information to construct a Digg submit link:         create a Digg link and return it         return '<a href="http:  digg.com submit?url='.$link.'&amp;        title='.$amp;title.'&bodytext='.$text.'">Digg This ';  }  It returns this HTML text so that it gets added to the WordPress output at the point where  the function is called – just after the post is displayed. Therefore, the link appears right after  each post—which is convenient for the user who has just finished reading the post.   Using the Digg API Usually, when using the functionalities of third-party sites, as we are doing in our example  with Digg, we would search for the API documentation first. Almost all the major sites have  extensive documentation available to help developers use their services in an effective way.  Digg is no exception, and if you search the Internet for the digg button api you will find a  page at http:  digg.com tools integrate that will have all the details we need in  order to implement our Digg functionality.  [ 35 ]   Social Bookmarking  Digg allows us to use several different ways of using their service.  For the start, we will display just a Digg link. Later, we will expand it and also display a   normal button.  Here is what the Digg documentation says about formatting a submit link.  Submit URL: http:  digg.com submit?url=example.com&title=TITLE&bodytext=DESCRIPTI ON&media=MEDIA&topic=TOPIC  Submit URL Details:        url=example.com Maximum length is 255 characters Story URL should be unique and devoid of session or user-specific data Please URL-encode all strings as appropriate. For example: http%3A%2F%2Fyourwebsite%2Fyourstoryurl%2Fstorypagedetails.html title=TITLE Maximum length is 75 characters Please also URL-encode the story title bodytext=DESCRIPTION Maximum length is 350 characters Please also URL-encode the body text  [ 36 ]   Chapter 2  Using this information, we are able to create a valid link for the Digg service from the  information available in our post.  Acquiring post information WordPress provides a number of ways to get information about the current post.  One of them involves using the global variable $post, which stores all the relevant  information for the current post. We have used it in our example to extract the post title and  content, but it can also be used to get other information such as post category, status and   so on.  WordPress also offers an array of functions we could have used to access post information  such as get_the_title   and get_the_content  .  The main difference between using these functions and accessing post data directly  using $post variable is in the end information we get. The $post variable contains raw  information about the post, just as the user wrote it. The functions mentioned above take  the same raw information as a starting point, but could have the final output modified by  external factors such as other active plugins.  You can browse through the wp-includes post-template.php file of  your WordPress installation to get a better understanding of the differences  between using the $post variable and the WordPress provided functions.  Post permalink URL In order to obtain post URL we used the get_permalink   WordPress function. This  function accepts the post ID as a parameter, and as a result, returns post's actual URL on the  blog. It will always return a valid URL to your post no matter what permalink structure your  blog is using.  Editing the theme files In our example, we had to edit our theme in order to place the Digg link under the post  content. WordPress allows for easy theme editing through the built-in Theme Editor panel.  After selecting the theme you want to edit, you will be presented with a number of   options. Every theme consists of various PHP template files, each covering different   blog functionalities.  [ 37 ]   Social Bookmarking  Here is a reference table detailing the most commonly used template files.  File  Page  Description  index.php  Main index file  home.php  Home page  single.php  Single post  page.php  Page Template  archive.php  Archives  comments.php  Comments  header.php  Header  footer.php  Foot r  search.php  Search results  sidebar.php  Sidebar  404.php  404 file not found page  This is the main theme file; it is used to  render any page as a replacement if the  'specialised' file listed below is missing  Used to display the contents of the home  page of the blog, which usually includes a  list of recent posts.  Called when you click on a single post to  display post comments; usually includes  comments template at the end.  Same as single post, but is used for  displaying pages  Displays blog archives, such as earlier posts,  posts by month or categories.  Template responsible for showing user  comments and the comment area for new  comments  Outputs the header for every page, usually  containing information such as title and  navigation, and includes theme style sheets  and so on  The footer of every page, usually containing  copyright information and useful links  This template is used to show search results  for your blog; It is usually   similar to archive.php but also   includes information about the   searched-for phrase  Shows the blog sidebar; if the theme  supports widgets, it will also include widget  support functions  Default page for showing missing  404   pages on your blog  Always be careful when editing the theme files as any kind of mistake in your syntax can  cause an error in displaying the page. It is therefore good practice to first backup theme files,  so you can safely revert to them afterwards.  [ 3 ]   Chapter 2  Quick reference $post: A global WordPress variable containing information about the currently  processed post. get_permalink $post_id : Returns the full URL to the post given by its  ID  for example $post->ID . function_exists $function : Helps the PHP function to check if   the given function exists. It is useful in themes when we want to include   our function. urlencode $string : Helps the PHP function to properly format the  parameters to be used in a URL query.  Have a go Hero Our plugin already has useful functionality. Try to customize it by:              Calling our Digg link function from different places in the theme template, for  example, before the content or after the tags are displayed  look for the_tags    line in the template . Adding the function to other theme templates such as the main index file and  archive pages to display the Digg links on the home page and blog archives as well. Using the get_the_title   and get_the_content   functions to obtain post  title and content instead of using the $post variable.  WordPress plugin hooks  Our plugin now works fine, but there is a problem. In order to use it, we also have to edit the  theme. This can be a real pain for all sorts of reasons:  If you want to change to a different theme, the plugin will stop working until you  edit the new theme. If you want to distribute your plugin to other people, they can't just install it and  activate it; they have to change their theme files too. If you change the function name, you need to alter the theme files again  We need some way to make the plugin work on its own, without the users having to change  their themes or anything else.  Hooks come to the rescue, making it possible to display our Digg This button in our   posts—without ever modifying our theme.  [ 3 ]   Social Bookmarking  Time for Action – Use a filter hook We will use the the_content filter hook to automatically add our Digg This link to the end  of the post content. This will avoid the need for the users to edit their theme files if they  want to use our plugin.  1.  Create a function that we will use to hook to the content filter:        create a Digg link and return it         return '<a href="http:  digg.com submit?url='.$link.'&amp;        title='.$title.'&amp;bodytext='.$text.'">Digg This ';                 }   * Add Digg link to the end of the post *  function WPDiggThis_ContentFilter $content  {             return $content.WPDiggThis_Link  ;         }  2.  Use the post content hook to automatically call our new function:     add_filter 'the_content', 'WPDiggThis_ContentFilter' ;  3.  Remove the references to our function from the theme template as we no longer   need them. Leaving them would have the effect of showing the link twice.  The end result is now the same, but we now control the appearance of the link directly   from our plugin.  What just happened? When we activate our plugin now, WordPress comes across and runs this line:  add_filter 'the_content', 'WPDiggThis_ContentFilter' ;  This tells WordPress that every time it's going to display the content of a post or page, it  should run it through our WPDiggThis_ContentFilter   function. We don't need to  modify the theme file anymore – WordPress will make sure that the function runs at the  required time.  When we load a post now, WordPress will automatically call our function:   * Add Digg link to the end of the post *  function WPDiggThis_ContentFilter $content  {                 return $content.WPDiggThis_Link  ;         }  [ 40 ]   Chapter 2  This function receives the post's content as a parameter, and returns the filtered content. In  this case, our Digg link gets automatically appended to the end of the content.  WordPress hooks WordPress provides a powerful mechanism for plugin functions to be called at the exact time  when we need them. This functionality is accomplished by using the so called hooks.  Every time you call a page from your browser, the WordPress engine goes through every  possible function it needs to render the requested page. Somewhere along the way, you can  "hook" up your function and use it to affect the end result.  You do this by simply registering your function with a specified hook, allowing it to be called  by WordPress at the right moment.  There are two types of WordPress hooks:      Action hooks: These are triggered by WordPress events, for example, when  someone creates a post or writes a comment. Filter hooks: These are used to modify WordPress content on the fly, like title or  content of the post as it is being served to the user.  Filter hooks We learned that filter hooks  also referred to as simply 'filters'  are functions that process  WordPress content, whether it is about to be saved in the database or displayed in the user's  browser. WordPress expects these functions to modify the content they get and return it.  In our case, we used the_content filter hook to modify the post content by appending a  Digg link to it. We could also have placed the Digg link at the beginning of the post, or broken  up the post and put it in the middle.  To set up a filter, we need to use the add_filter function:  add_filter   'filter_hook', 'filter_function_name' , [priority],  [accepted_args]  ;        filter_hook: One of the filter hooks provided by WordPress. ne of the filter hooks provided by WordPress. filter_function_name: A function used to process the content provided by the  filter_hook. priority: An optional parameter, which specifies the execution order of functions.  The default value is 10 if several functions apply to the same filter hook, functions  with a lower priority number execute first, while the functions with the same  priority will execute in the order in which they were added to the filter.  [ 41 ]   Social Bookmarking    accepted_args: An optional parameter, which specifies how many arguments  your function can accept. The default value is 1. The accepted_args parameter is  used for hooks that pass more than one argument.  Here is an example list of filter hooks, which will help you to get a better understanding of  what you can achieve using them.  Filter  the_content  Description  Applied to the post content retrieved from the database prior to  printing on the screen   the_content_rss  Applied to the post content prior to including in an RSS feed  the_title  wp_title  comment_text  get_categories  the_permalink  autosave_interval  theme_root_uri  Applied to the post title retrieved from the database prior to printing  on the screen   Applied to the blog page title before sending to the browser in the  wp_title function  Applied to the comment text before display on the screen by the  comment_text function and in the admin menus  Applied to the category list generated by the get_categories  function  Applied to the permalink URL for a post prior to printing by   the_permalink function Applied to the interval for auto-saving posts  Applied to the theme root directory URI returned by the   get_theme_root_uri function  Filter hooks can be removed using the remove_filter   function. It accepts the same  arguments as add_filter  , and is useful if you want to replace some of the existing  WordPress filters with your functions.  If you want to take a closer look at the default WordPress filters, you can find them in the   wp-includes\default-filters.php file of your WordPress installation.   It is important to remember that the filter function always receives some data and  is responsible for returning the data, whether it modifies the data or not. Only if  you want to disregard this data completely, can you return an empty value.  Action hooks We use action hooks when we need to include specific functionalities every time a  WordPress event triggers, for example when the user publishes a post or changes the theme.  [ 42 ]   Chapter 2  WordPress does not ask for any information back from the action function, it simply   notifies it that a certain event has happened, and that a function should respond to it   in a desired way.  Action hooks are used in a way similar to the filter hooks. The syntax for setting up an action  hooks is:  add_action   'action_hook', 'action_function_name', [priority],  [accepted_args]  ;          action_hook: The name of the hook provided by WordPress. he name of the hook provided by WordPress. action_function_name: The name of the function you want to use to handle   the event. priority: An optional parameter, which specifies the execution order of functions.  The default value is 10. If several functions apply to the same filter hook, then  functions with lower priority numbers will execute first, while the functions with the  same priority will execute in the order in which they were added. accepted_args: It is optional and specifies how many arguments your function  can accept. The default value is 1 and is used for hooks that pass more than   one argument.  The following table presents example action hooks provided by WordPress.  Action  create_category  publish_post  Description  Runs when a new category is created  Runs when a post is published, or if it is edited and its  status is published  wp_blacklist_check  Runs to check whether a comment should be blacklisted  switch_theme  Runs when the blog's theme is changed  activate_ plugin_file_name   admin_head  wp_head  init  Runs when the plugin is first activated Runs in the HTML   section of the   admin panel Runs when the template calls the wp_head function.  This hook is generally placed near the top of a page  template between   and   Runs after WordPress has finished loading but before any  headers are sent; it is useful for intercepting $_GET or  $_POST triggers  user_register  Runs when a user's profile is first created  [ 43 ]   Social Bookmarking  Just as with filters, you can use the remove_action   function to remove currently  registered actions.  Practical filters and actions examples Since understanding the power of filters and actions is very important for conquering  WordPress plugin development, we will now examine a few more simple examples of   their usage.  Upper case titles The hook function can be any registered function. In this case, we will pass the title of the  post to strtoupper making all titles appear in upper case.  add_filter 'the_title', strtoupper ;  Mailing list Actions provide a very powerful mechanism for automating tasks. Here is how to send a  notification to a mailing list whenever there is an update on your blog.  function mailing_list $post_ID    {     $list = 'john@somesite.com,becky@somesite.com';         mail $list, 'My Blog Update',           'My blog has just been updated: '.get_settings 'home'  ;     }    Send notification with every new post and comment add_action 'publish_post', 'mailing_list' ; add_action 'comment_post', 'mailing_list' ;  Changing core WordPress functionality Sometimes you may not be satisfied with the default WordPress functionalities. You may be  tempted to modify the WordPress source code, but you should never do that. One of the  main reason is that when you upgrade to a new version of WordPress the upgrade process  could overwrite your changes.  Instead, try whenever possible to write a plugin and use actions and filters to change the  desired functionality.  Let's say we want to change WordPress post excerpt handling. WordPress uses the   wp_trim_excerpt   function with the get_the_excerpt filter responsible for  processing  the post excerpt. No problem, let's replace it with our own function, using   the WordPress function as a starting point.  [ 44 ]   Chapter 2   * Create excerpt with 70 words and preserved HTML tags *  function my_wp_trim_excerpt $text   {      if   '' == $text        {         $text = get_the_content '' ;         $text = apply_filters 'the_content', $text ;         $text = str_replace ']]>', ']]&gt;', $text ;                 $excerpt_length = 70;         $words = explode ' ', $text, $excerpt_length + 1 ;         if  count $words  > $excerpt_length           {             array_pop $words ;             array_push $words, '[...]' ;             $text = implode ' ', $words ;         }     }     return $text; }     remove WordPress default excerpt filter remove_filter 'get_the_excerpt', 'wp_trim_excerpt' ;     Add our custom filter with low priority add_filter 'get_the_excerpt', my_wp_trim_excerpt, 20 ;  These were just a few practical examples. You can do almost anything that crosses your mind  using action and filter hooks in WordPress.  Sometimes, you can achieve the same result by using either the action or the  filter hook. For example, if you want to change the text of the post you can use publish_ post action hook to change the post as it is being saved to the database. Alternatively, you can use the_content filter to change the text of the post as  it is displayed in the browser window. Although the result is the same, we accomplish the goal in different ways.  In the  first case, when using the action hook, the post itself will remain permanently  changed, whereas using the filter hook will change the text every time it is  displayed. You will want to use the functionality more suitable for your needs.

Use the  comment_text filter and the ucfirst   PHP function  Adding a Digg button using JavaScript code  Our Digg link works fine for submitting the content, but isn't very pretty, and does not show  the number of Diggs we received. That is why we need to use a standard Digg button.  This is accomplished by using a simple piece of JavaScript code provided by Digg, and passing  it the necessary information.  [ 46 ]   Time for Action – Implement a Digg button Let us implement a Digg button, using information from the Digg API. We will use the newly  created button on single posts, and keep the simple Digg link for all the other pages.  Chapter 2  1.                                         Create a new function for displaying a nice Digg button using JavaScript code.  * Return a Digg button *  function WPDiggThis_Button   {     global $post;         get the URL to the post     $link=js_escape get_permalink $post->ID  ;         get the post title     $title=js_escape $post->post_title ;             get the content         $text=js_escape substr strip_tags $post->post_content ,                                                                   0, 350  ;                          create a Digg button and return it            $button="                 digg_url = '$link';        digg_title = '$title';        digg_bodytext = '$text';              <script src='http:  digg.com tools diggthis.js'                                    type='text javascript'> "                   return  $button ;        }  2.  Modify our filter function to include the Digg button for single posts and pages, and   a Digg link for all the other pages:                      * Add Digg This to the post *  function WPDiggThis_ContentFilter $content  {            if on single post or page display the button     if  is_single    is_page            return WPDiggThis_Button  .$content;             else         return $content.WPDiggThis_Link  ;         }  [ 47 ]   Social Bookmarking  3.  Digg button now shows at the beginning of the single post page.  What just happened? WordPress will parse our content filter function according to the conditional statement we  have added:  function WPDiggThis_ContentFilter $content  {             if on single post or page display the button     if  is_single    is_page             return WPDiggThis_Button  .$content;      This means that if the current viewed page is a single post or page, we will append our Digg  button at the beginning of that post.  If we are viewing all the other pages on the blog  like for example the home page or archives   we will show the Digg This link instead.      if  is_single    is_page            return WPDiggThis_Button  .$content;             else         return $content.WPDiggThis_Link  ;         }  The reason for doing so is that we do not want to clutter the home page of the blog with a  lot of big yellow Digg buttons. So we just place a subtle link below the post instead. On single  pages, we show the normal button using our new WPDiggThis_Button   function.  [ 4 ]   The first part is similar to our previous WPDiggThis_Link   function, and it acquires the  necessary post information.  Chapter 2   * Return a Digg button *  function WPDiggThis_Button   {     global $post;                           get the URL to the post     $link=js_escape get_permalink $post->ID  ;         get the post title     $title=js_escape $post->post_title ;         get the content         $text=js_escape substr strip_tags $post->post_content , 0, 350  ;       However in this case, we are treating all the information through the js_escape    WordPress function, which handles formatting of content for usage in JavaScript code. This  includes handling of quotes, double quotes and line endings, and is necessary to make sure  that our JavaScript code will work properly.  We then create a code using Digg API documentation for a JavaScript button:     create a Digg button and return it     $button="           digg_url = '$link';     digg_title = '$title';     digg_bodytext = '$text';           <script src='http:  digg.com tools diggthis.js'                   type='text javascript'> ";  Conditional Tags We have used two functions in our example, is_single   and is_page  . These are  WordPress conditional tags and are useful for determining the currently viewed page on the  blog. We used them to determine if we want to display a button or just a link.  WordPress provides a number of conditional tags that can be used to control execution of  your code depending on what the user is currently viewing.  [ 4 ]   Social Bookmarking  Here is the reference table for some of the most popular conditional tags.  Tag is_home is_admin is_single is_page is_category is_tag is_date is_search  Returns True If User is Viewing Blog home page Administration interface Single post page Blog page Archives by category Archives by tag Archives by date Search results  Conditional tags are used in a variety of ways. For example, is_single '15'  checks  whether the current page is a single post with ID 15. You can also check by title.   is_page 'About'  checks if we are on the page with the title 'About'.  Quick reference is_single  ,is_page  : These are conditional tags to determine the  nature of the currently viewed content js_escape  : A WordPress function to properly escape the strings to be used  in JavaScript code WordPress Conditional Tags: http:  codex.wordpress.org  Conditional_Tags  Styling the output  Our Digg button looks like it could use a better positioning, as the default one spoils the look  of the theme. So, we will use CSS to reposition the button.  Cascading Style Sheets or CSS  for short  http:  www.w3.org Style CSS   are a simple  but powerful tool that allows web developers to add different styles to web presentations.  They allow full control over the layout, size and colour of elements on a given page.  Time for Action – Use CSS to position the button Using CSS styles, we will move the button to the right of the post.  1.  We will accomplish this by first encapsulating the button in a   element. Then  we will add a CSS style to this element stating that the button should appear on the  right, with a left margin towards the text of 10 pixels.  [ 50 ]                             Chapter 2         create a Digg button and return it         $button="           digg_url = '$link';     digg_title = '$title';     digg_bodytext = '$text';           <script src='http:  digg.com tools diggthis.js' type='text                                          javascript'> ";         encapsulate the button in a div     $button='         <div style="float: right; margin-left:                     10px; margin-bottom: 4px;">         '.$button.'      ';                        return $button;      2.  The result of applying this simple CSS code is that Digg Button now shows to the   right of the post.  What just happened? We used CSS to move the button to a desired position. CSS is extremely useful for   these kinds of tasks and is commonly used in WordPress development to enhance the   user experience.      encapsulate the button in a div $button='     <div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom:  4px;">     '.$button.'  ';  We have basically encapsulated our button in a   element and forced it to the right  edge by using float: right CSS command inside a style tag.  [ 51 ]   Social Bookmarking  We could further experiment with the placement of the button until we find the most  satisfying solution.   For example, if we hook to the_title filter instead of the_content, and moved the  button to the left, we would get the following result:   Certainly, having good CSS skills is a very valuable asset in WordPress plugin development.

In this chapter, we will move on and explore more cool things we can do with WordPress by  livening up the default WordPress Blogroll.  The purpose of the plugin will be to display the most recent posts from the sites listed in the  blogroll using a nice pop-up window. We also want to do that dynamically, using Ajax and  jQuery technologies.  Do not worry if you know little about them right now. They integrate naturally with  WordPress, and soon you'll consider them as being part of WordPress!  In this chapter, you will:  Use more hooks, more API features Deal with RSS, an important aspect of blogging Get familiar with jQuery and Ajax, and load the 'recent posts' dynamically Learn how to make the plugin secure by using nonces            You will learn this by:  Creating a live Blogroll plugin that adds a 'recent posts' pop up for each blog in   your blogroll   Live Blogroll  The integrated WordPress Blogroll is very rudimentary one; it just displays a list of links that  stay exactly the same over time. Here is what it normally looks like:  What if it could give us an insight into what is happening on the site by showing the most  recent posts?  Our plugin makes this functionality possible, is attractive to use, and will not slow down the  loading time of the main page. We will call the plugin 'Live Blogroll' as this is what it will  actually do—breathe life into our blogroll!  [ 56 ]   Chapter 3  Starting up with the blogroll  The WordPress Blogroll is a collection of links to other sites. You can manage these links  in the WordPress administration menu where you can add, modify, and delete them. The  changes are represented instantaneously on your Blogroll and are visible to the visitors of  your site.  WordPress allow us to hook up into the process of preparing the blogroll links just before  they are displayed on the site. We will use this as a first step in our plugin, to demonstrate  how to fetch the RSS feed from the link and display the title of the first post as a link.  This will make the blogroll look livelier as it will constantly change with the posting of new  articles on those sites.  [ 57 ]   Live Blogroll  Time for action – Roll into the blogroll We want to hook up into the blogroll filter and modify the links on the fly, fetching the latest  post from the RSS feed and replacing it into the blogroll.  1.  2.                                                                      Create a new folder for the plugin, called live-blogroll. We will have more than  one file in our final plugin, so that we can keep everything neatly in one folder. Create a new file called wp-live-blogroll.php. This will be our main file and  should contain the plugin information. We can also re-use our version check code: <?php  * Plugin Name: Live Blogroll Version: 0.1 Description: Shows a number of 'recent posts' for each link in   your Blogroll using Ajax.

Please   update! '; if  version_compare $wp_version,"2.3","<"   {     exit  $exit_msg ; }  ?>  3.  We will also define a plugin path that we will use later:  $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url = trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_DIR.' '. dirname    plugin_basename __FILE__   ;  4.  Include the rss.php file, which contains functions, which are needed for parsing   RSS feeds:  require_once ABSPATH . WPINC . ' rss.php' ;    5.  Next, we want to hook to get_bookmarks in order to change the blogroll display:    add_filter 'get_bookmarks', WPLiveRoll_GetBookmarksFilter ;  [ 5 ]   Chapter 3  6.  Now, let's add the filter function:                    function WPLiveRoll_GetBookmarksFilter $items  {        do nothing if in the admin menu   if  is_admin        {     return $items;   }                                                                                                      parse all blogroll items   foreach $items as $item    {        check if the link is public     if  $item->link_visible=='Y'       {       $link_url=trailingslashit $item->link_url ;           simple feed guessing       if  strstr $link_url,"blogspot"          {            blogspot blog         $feed_url=$link_url."feeds posts default ";       }         else if  strstr $link_url,"typepad"          {            typepad blog         $feed_url=$link_url."atom.xml";       }         else         {            own domain or wordpress blog         $feed_url=$link_url."feed ";        }          use WordPress to fetch the RSS feed      $feedfile = fetch_rss $feed_url ;          check if we got valid response      if  is_array $feedfile->items         && !empty $feedfile->items           {           this is the last post        $feeditem=$feedfile->items[0];           replace name and url with post link and title        $item->link_url=$feeditem['link'];        $item->link_name=$feeditem['title'];      }  [ 5 ]   Live Blogroll                }   }      return the items back   return $items; }  7.  Upload your whole plugin folder live-blogroll to the wp-content plugins   folder on your server.  8.  Activate the plugin and check your blogroll. The new blogroll is shown with a fresh   new look which displays all the latest posts.  What just happened? When the page is loaded, the get_bookmarks filter is executed:  add_filter 'get_bookmarks', WPLiveRoll_GetBookmarksFilter ;  At this point, our filter function WPLiveRoll_GetBookmarksFilter   takes care of the  blogroll processing:  function WPLiveRoll_GetBookmarksFilter $items  {        do nothing if in the admin menu     if  is_admin         {         return $items;      }  Since the get_bookmarks filter is activated on the administration pages  where we do not  want to do anything , we are making a check by using the conditional tag is_admin. It will  return true if the user is currently viewing the admin panel pages, in which case, we simply  return the unprocessed items.  Next, we loop through all the links in the blogroll, and check to see if they are enabled:         parse all blogroll items     foreach $items as $item      {             check if the link is public          if  $item->link_visible=='Y'             {  Now, when we have a published link we need to find the RSS feed from the site.  A detailed approach would involve loading the content of the page and processing it for the    tags and searching for one of the possible RSS formats.  [ 60 ]   For the purpose of this example, we will keep it simple by guessing the feed based on the  site name, which will work for most blogs  you can develop a more comprehensive RSS  discovery function as an exercise :  Chapter 3    $link_url=trailingslashit $item->link_url ;       simple feed guessing   if  strstr $link_url,"blogspot.com"      {        blogspot blog     $feed_url=$link_url."feeds posts default ";   }    else    if  strstr $link_url,"typepad.com"      {        typepad blog     $feed_url=$link_url."atom.xml";   }    else    {        own domain or wordpress blog     $feed_url=$link_url."feed ";   }  Now that we have the feed URL, we can fetch the contents of the feed using the WordPress  function fetch_rss  :       use WordPress to fetch the RSS feed   $feedfile = fetch_rss $feed_url ;  The result should be an array of objects; each one representing information about a single  post sorted by date.  First, we check to see if we get a valid response,       check if we got valid response   if  is_array $feedfile->items       && !empty $feedfile->items         {  And then replace the blogroll URL and name with latest post's URL and title:         this is the last post     $feeditem=$feedfile->items[0];        replace name and url with post link         and title       $item->link_url=$feeditem['link'];  [ 61 ]   Live Blogroll        $item->link_name=$feeditem['title'];     }    }   }      return the items back   return $items; }  In the end we return the items. Note that if we do not get a valid response, the original link  will stay intact. It is a very simple automatic fallback in case we cannot parse the feed for  some reason.  Our code needs RSS functionality, which comes through the rss.php file of the   WordPress installation:  require_once ABSPATH . WPINC . ' rss.php' ;  We included it using two WordPress defines, ABSPATH and WPINC, which contain the  absolute path to the WordPress installation and the path to the WordPress includes folder.  Quick reference fetch_rss  : Parses RSS feed, and requires rss.php file to be included. is_admin  : Checks to see if the current page is an administration page. ABSPATH: A variable which contains the absolute path to WordPress installation. WPINC: A variable which contains the name of the includes folder. get_bookmarks: A filter used to parse blogroll items. WP_PLUGIN_URL: Contains the URL to the WordPress plugin folder  RSS Feed Processing WordPress provides a very easy to use function, fetch_rss  , to process the RSS feeds.  The function relies internally on RSS feed library that comes included with WordPress, and  takes care of the all the related work.   The function returns an array of feed items, which you can easily loop through to extract the  information you need:  $feedfile = fetch_rss $feed_url ;  foreach $feedfile->items as $item   {  You may have noticed a pause when loading the blogroll for the first time. This is caused by  the fetching of the feeds and is especially noticeable if you have many links in your blogroll.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 3  This delay exists only for the first time when new feeds are parsed. The RSS library has a  built-in mechanism for caching the feeds. That means that for the next request, the feed will  be served from the local cache if it has not been updated in the meantime.  The method we use is simple and effective, but now we want more interactivity. We do not  want any delay in loading; we want to show more recent posts, and show them in a pop-up  window. In order to achieve all this, we need to use a language specifically written to handle  events on a web page—JavaScript.  jQuery JavaScript library  There are a number of libraries available which simplify the usage of JavaScript by providing  ready-made functions for the most common tasks. The most popular today are jQuery,  Scriptaculous and MooTools. WordPress comes with the first two pre-installed, and we will  be using jQuery for our plugins.  Implementing a mouse hover event in jQuery Although our plugin is fine, we would like it to interact with the user and show them the  information when they want it, and where they want it. Responding to the user hovering the  mouse over the link on the blogroll sounds like a good place to start.  Let's create a jQuery JavaScript that will show additional information in the blogroll, using  the hover event as a trigger.  Time for action – Creating a hover event with jQuery We will create an external file to store our JavaScript and use it to display a message directly  in the blogroll, when the user hovers the mouse over one of the links.  1. 2.        Create a new file called wp-live-blogroll.js. Initialize jQuery when our page loads:    setup everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $    {  3.  Assign a hover event to our links.           connect to hover event of   in .livelinks       $ '.livelinks a' .hover function e          {  [ 63 ]   Live Blogroll  4.	 Insert a new element     on the mouse hover event. It will display a simple   message for now  Recent posts will be displayed here  :            set the text we want to display        this.tip="Recent posts from " + this.href + "          will be displayed here...";           create a new div and display a tip inside        $ this .append ' ' + this.tip +          ' ' ;      },  5.  And remove it when the user moves the mouse:           when the mouse hovers out       function           {              remove it           $ this .children  .remove  ;        } ;     } ;  6.  Using jQuery we have just assigned hover event to class 'livelinks'.  That means that blogroll needs to be embedded within this class. Open up our  plugin file wp-live-blogroll.php and add the following filter function to the  end. It will embed our blogroll into the livelinks class. add_filter 'wp_list_bookmarks',                WPLiveRoll_ListBookmarksFilter ;  function WPLiveRoll_ListBookmarksFilter $content  {     return ' '.$content.' '; }  7.  Finally, we want to have WordPress load our script when the page loads.  We use the wp_print_scripts action to accomplish that and the   wp_enqueue_script function to include our JavaScript: add_action 'wp_print_scripts', 'WPLiveRoll_ScriptsAction' ;  function WPLiveRoll_ScriptsAction    {   global $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url;    if  !is_admin      {  [ 64 ]                           Chapter 3      wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'wp_live_roll_script',                  $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url.' wp-live-blogroll.js',             array 'jquery'  ;         } }  8.  We do not want to use the get_bookmarks filter anymore. We will simply comment   out the filter assignment: add_filter 'get_bookmarks', WPLiveRoll_GetBookmarksFilter ;     9.  Update the plugin on the server. Try to hover the mouse over one of the links and   you should get our message.  What just happened? Our script is loaded in the   section of the page with the wp_print_scripts action,  which is used to print out scripts our plugin will use.  add_action 'wp_print_scripts', 'WPLiveRoll_ScriptsAction' ;  To actually add the scripts, we use the wp_enqueue_script   WordPress function, which  will be covered in detail later. This function allows us to add preinstalled scripts like jQuery,  or our custom scripts:  function WPLiveRoll_ScriptsAction    {   global $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url;   if  !is_admin      {      wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;      wp_enqueue_script 'wp_live_roll_script',           $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url.' wp-live-blogroll.js',           array 'jquery'  ;    } }  [ 65 ]   Live Blogroll  Next, Blogroll is embedded in the livelinks class, so our jQuery code can properly assign  the hover event. We used the wp_list_bookmarks hook, which executes just before the  blogroll shows on the page.  add_filter 'wp_list_bookmarks', WPLiveRoll_ListBookmarksFilter ;  The filter function receives the full HTML code of the prepared blogroll, so we only need to  embed its content into our livelinks class and return it:  function WPLiveRoll_ListBookmarksFilter $content  {     return ' '.$content.' '; }  To work with jQuery when the page is ready, we need to initialize it at the beginning of the  JavaScript code. jQuery provides the ready method which executes when the page is loaded   more accurately when the page code is loaded; the images may still be loading :     set up everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $    {  Next, we set up a hover jQuery event for links inside the livelinks class using a jQuery  selector  more on that later .          connect to hover event of   in .livelinks     $ '.livelinks a' .hover function e        {  Now, we want to add a text and a   to display it in. We used the internal variable this,  which represents the object that triggered the hover event  which will be one of the links in  the Blogroll .  To store the temporary value of the text, we will create a new variable tip and use the URL  of the link found in the link's this.href property:             set the text we want to display         this.tip="Recent posts from " + this.href + "           will be displayed here...";  We then dynamically append code to our link by using the jQuery append   method:             create a new div and display a tip inside         $ this .append ' ' + this.tip +              ' ' ;  [ 66 ]   The hover event allows us to declare the function for handling the hover out event and we  use it to remove the   when the user moves the mouse away from the link.  To do that, we can use the children   method, which references elements under our link,  in this case, the appended div:  Chapter 3           when the mouse hovers out       function           {             remove it          $ this .children  .remove  ;       }     } ;  JavaScript and WordPress WordPress provides a way to add external scripts in an elegant way, by using the   wp_enqueue_script function.  The wp_enqueue_script function is usually used in conjunction with the   wp_print_scripts action and accepts up to four parameters: handle, src,  dependencies, and version.          handle: This is the name of the script, it should be a lowercase string. src  Optional : This is the path to the script from the root directory of WordPress,  example:  wp-includes js scriptaculous scriptaculous.js. This  parameter is required only when WordPress does not already know about this  script. It defaults to false. dependencies  Optional : This is an array of the handles of any scripts that this  script depends on; which means, that the scripts that must be loaded before this  script. Set it to false if there are no dependencies. This parameter is required only  when WordPress does not already know about this script. It defaults to false. version  Optional : This is the string specifying a script version number, if it has  one. It defaults to false. This parameter is used to ensure that the correct version is  sent to the client regardless of caching, and should therefore be included if a version  number is available and makes sense for the script.  In our example, we declared that we are using jQuery and then our own script by specifying  the full path to it:  wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ; wp_enqueue_script 'wp_live_roll_script',   $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url.' wp-live-blogroll.js',  array 'jquery'  ;   [ 67 ]   Live Blogroll  As mentioned before, WordPress comes preinstalled with a variety of scripts. To use them,  you need to specify the handle to wp_enqueue_script  , as we did with jQuery. Some of  the popular scripts included are dbx  Docking Boxes , colorpicker, wp_tiny_mce  WordPress  Tiny MCE , autosave, scriptaculous, prototype, thickbox and others.  Quick reference wp_enqueue_script  : This is used to queue an external script used by our  plugin. Additional information is available at http:  codex.wordpress. org Function_Reference wp_enqueue_script bloginfo  : This is the function used to retrieve relevant blog information  like the homepage URL and print it out. get_bloginfo also does the same  thing; it only returns the information instead of printing it. More information  is available at: http:  codex.wordpress.org Template_Tags  bloginfo wp_print_scripts: Filter which runs inside the   tag of the  document, usually used to declare scripts  Initializing jQuery We have initialized jQuery with this code:     set up everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $    {   Notice the '$' parameter to the function? All jQuery variables and functions are constrained  within the jQuery namespace. You can usually access them using jQuery   and also $  .  The only problem is that sometimes other libraries also use $ as their namespace reference,  which leads to conflicts.  The most elegant way to avoid this is to declare the ready function as we did, which allows  us to use the shorter $ reference inside the ready   function while avoiding conflict with  other libraries.  Expanding jQuery knowledge One of the advantages of jQuery is the ability to access every single element in our  document with ease. Let's try a few examples:        $ "h1" : gets all the   tags $ "sidebar" : gets the element with id="sidebar" $ ".navigation" : gets all the elements with class="navigation"  [ 6 ]             $ "div.post image" : gets the element with id="image" nested in the <div  class="post"> $ "sidebar ul li" : gets all the   elements nested in all  , under the  element with id="sidebar"  Chapter 3  More control is given with the commands such as first, last, contains, visible, for example:  $ "li:first" : selects the first instance $ "li:contains blog " : selects all the elements in   that contain the   text "blog" $ "li:gt n " : selects all the elements in   with an index gr at r than  n   Responding to user events is a breeze in jQuery. There are custom defined events that we  can use such as: click, mouseover, hover, keydown, focus, and so on.  This code will add an alert pop-up whenever you click on any link on the page:  $ document .ready function     {     $ "a" .click function         {         alert "Thanks for visiting!" ;      } ; } ;  jQuery allows us to modify the document by adding classes to the elements  addclass  or  binding events to them easily.  $ document .ready function    {     $ 'button' .bind 'click', function e        {         alert 'The mouse is now at ' + e.pageX + ', ' + e.pageY ;      } ; } ;  jQuery also supports plugins, and there are literally hundreds of them which allows for  almost any kind of effect or functionality that you may imagine.  A good resource to start browsing for jQuery examples and documentation is the  official web site at http:  www.jquery.com and Learning jQuery web site  at http:  www.learningjquery.com.  [ 6 ]   Live Blogroll  Creating the pop-up with CSS Let's move on with our plugin and create a pop-up window for our message. To do this, we  will include CSS code and make a couple of changes to the plugin.  Time for action – Apply CSS to the popup In this example, we are going to style our pop up using the CSS. The contents of the CSS will  be located in the external file for easy editing. We will use another WordPress action to load  this stylesheet from the   tag of the document.  1. 2.                      Create a new file named wp-live-blogroll.css. Add this code to style the lb_popup element: lb_popup   {     color:3366FF;         width:250px;     border:2px solid 0088CC;     background:fdfdfd;     padding:4px 4px;     display:none;     position:absolute; }  3.  Edit our JavaScript wp-live-blogroll.js to position the pop up at    mouse coordinates:         create a new div and display a tip inside     $ this .append ' ' +       this.tip + ' ' ;        get coordinates     var mouseX = e.pageX   e.clientX ? e.clientX       + document.body.scrollLeft: 0 ;     var mouseY = e.pageY   e.clientY ? e.clientY       + document.body.scrollTop: 0 ;        move the top left corner to the left and down     mouseX -= 260;     mouseY += 5;        position our div     $ 'lb_popup' .      css {         left: mouseX + "px",         top: mouseY + "px"         } ;            show it using a fadeIn function         $ 'lb_popup' .fadeIn 300 ;  [ 70 ]   Chapter 3  4.	 Finally, load the CSS style by using the wp_head action. Edit the wp-live-  blogroll.php file and add this code to the end:                  add_action 'wp_head', 'WPLiveRoll_HeadAction'  ;  function WPLiveRoll_HeadAction   {   global $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url;    echo '<link rel="stylesheet"           href="'.$wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url.' wp-live-blogroll.css"        type="text css"  >';     }  5.  Be sure to upload all new files to the server. Once you reload the page you should   get a newly created pop-up window just below the mouse pointer, that looks   like this:  What just happened? We created a pop-up window by applying CSS styling to it and placed it according to the  current mouse position.  Our stylesheet is loaded using the wp_head  for admin pages wp_admin_head  action  executed inside the   tag of the page:  add_action 'wp_head', 'WPLiveRoll_HeadAction'  ;  function WPLiveRoll_HeadAction   {   global $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url;    echo '<link rel="stylesheet"     href="'.$wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url.' wp-live-blogroll.css"    type="text css"  >';  }  [ 71 ]   Live Blogroll  In the CSS file we use '' to reference our identifier    . If we were  referencing a class  possibly multiple elements  we would use a '.' instead :  lb_popup   {     color:3366FF;     width:250px;     border:2px solid 0088CC;     background:fdfdfd;     padding:4px 4px;     display:none;     position:absolute; }  The style specifies several attributes including the width, font color and background color.  We set the position to absolute as we will tell it exactly where to appear with the JavaScript.  We also want to show the pop up using jQuery fade-in effect, so we set display to none as a  default value.  The next snippet of code calculates the position of the mouse on our page:      get coordinates var mouseX = e.pageX   e.clientX ? e.clientX   + document.body.scrollLeft: 0 ; var mouseY = e.pageY   e.clientY ? e.clientY   + document.body.scrollTop: 0 ;  We then offset the coordinates by a predefined amount to get the final desired position:     move the top left corner to the left and down mouseX -= 260; mouseY += 5;  jQuery offers various functions for displaying hidden elements such as show, slide, animate  and fadeIn.   In our example, we use the fadeIn effect with the optional parameter of fade-in speed   in milliseconds:     show it using a fadeIn function $ 'lb_popup .fadeIn 300 ;  Having solved the pop up, it's finally time to use Ajax. Lots of people still avoid using Ajax as  the technology is still new. But we will show how to use it in a very simple manner.  [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  Demystifying Ajax  Ajax is a technology that allows web pages to dynamically perform actions or updates. This  allows for a higher level of user interactivity that we can see in popular applications such as  Google Maps or Gmail.   Since its introduction in 2005, Ajax has stood out as an excellent addition to the web  developer's arsenal, but several developers have been reluctant to use it due to certain initial  problems and cross-browser compatibility issues.   Fortunately, today these issues are gone thanks to high-level libraries such as jQuery that  take care of all Ajax calls internally and give us a simple to use API.  Simple example of using Ajax Now that we have a pop up in place, we need to fill it with data from the RSS feeds. We have  already learned how to parse RSS so all we have to do is create a function to display several  posts from a feed at once, and fill our pop up with this information using Ajax.  Time for action – Use Ajax to dynamically retrieve feed posts In order to work, Ajax usually needs to call a file on our server. This file is responsible for  providing the response, and it is best that we put this Ajax functionality into a separate file.   Create a file called wp-live-blogroll-ajax.php, implying that we want to use it  for handling Ajax requests. Add the code to include the necessary files, read the URL parameter passed to the  script and call our function to deal with the URL: <?php  1.  2.                              * WP Live Blogroll Ajax script Part of a WP Live Blog Roll plugin *   require_once ".. .. .. wp-config.php" ; require_once ABSPATH . WPINC . ' rss.php' ;     fetch information from GET method $link_url = $_GET['link_url'];     return the result WPLiveRoll_Handle ajax $link_url ;  [ 73 ]   Live Blogroll  3.  We will also need a utility function to get an excerpt from the text. We will use it to   show only the first 20 words from the post:  function WPLiveRoll_GetExcerpt $text, $length = 20   {     $text = strip_tags $text ;             $words = explode ' ', $text, $length + 1 ;     if  count $words  > $length        {         array_pop $words ;         array_push $words, '[...]' ;         $text = implode ' ', $words ;     }     return $text; }  4.	 We are going to add a function to parse the feed now. The function is similar to the   first function we used at the beginning of the chapter, but it parses a number of  posts and returns them in a formatted HTML. This function will return the result of  our Ajax request.  function WPLiveRoll_HandleAjax $link_url  {         we will return final HTML code in this variable     $result='';         number of posts we are showing     $number = 5;      $link_url=trailingslashit $link_url ;         pick the rss feed based on the site     if  strstr $link_url,"blogspot"         {            blogspot blog         $feed_url=$link_url."feeds posts default ";      }       else if  strstr $link_url,"typepad"         {            typepad blog         $feed_url=$link_url."atom.xml";      }       else       {            own domain or wordpress blog  [ 74 ]                                                                           Chapter 3          $feed_url=$link_url."feed ";      }         use WordPress to fetch the RSS feed     $feedfile = fetch_rss $feed_url ;         check if we got valid response     if  is_array $feedfile->items   && !empty                                      $feedfile->items              {             slice the number of items we need         $feedfile->items = array_slice $feedfile->items,                                      0, $number ;             create HTML out of posts            $result.= ' ';         foreach $feedfile->items as $item             {                 fetch the information             $item_title = $item['title'];             $item_link = $item['link'];             $item_description =               WPLiveRoll_GetExcerpt $item['description'] ;                 form result             $result.= ' <a class="lb_link"               target="'.$link_target.'" href="'.$item_link.'"               >'.$item_title.'  '              .$item_description.'  ';         }         $result.= ' ';     }       else       {            in case we were unable to parse the feed         $result.= "No posts available.";     }                                                                            return the HTML code     die  $result  ; }  ?>  [ 75 ]   Live Blogroll  5.  In order to use Ajax we need to pass the url to our plugin to JavaScript. We will use   wp_localize_script function to do that:  function WPLiveRoll_ScriptsAction    {   global $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url;       if  !is_admin      {      wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'wp_live_roll_script',      $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url.' wp-live-blogroll.js',      array 'jquery'  ;          pass parameters to JavaScript     wp_localize_script 'wp_live_roll_script', 'LiverollSettings',      array 'plugin_url' => $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url  ;   } }  6.  The moment has come. We will use simple Ajax request  load  to get a response  from the script we have made. The response will be automatically loaded into our  element as HTML content:                                        $ 'lb_popup' .css       {         left: mouseX + "px",         top: mouseY + "px"     } ;         use load   method to make an Ajax request     $ 'lb_popup .load LiverollSettings.plugin_url +       ' wp-live-blogroll-ajax.php?link_url=' + this.href ;          show it using a fadeIn function     $ 'lb_popup' .fadeIn 300 ;  7.  We will comment out the text from the previous examples, and remove it from    the  :         set the text we want to display        this.tip="Recent posts from " + this.href + "          will be displayed here...";            create a new div and append it to the link     $ this .append '  ' ;  [ 76 ]   8.  We are ready to see the plugin in action. Let us upload all the files and test it. You   should get a pop-up window showing five latest posts from the site:  Chapter 3  Congratulations! You have created a Live Blogroll plugin using jQuery and Ajax!  What just happened? The main difference here over our previous examples is in the use of Ajax in our JavaScript.  We have used the jQuery load   function, which is the simplest way to call an external  script and load the data into our page:     use load   method to make an Ajax request $ 'lb_popup .load LiverollSettings.plugin_url +   ' wp-live-blogroll-ajax.php?link_url=' + this.href ;   Notice how we reference lb_popup when using the load   function. This will load any  output of our script into the lb_popup element automatically.  Let's see now how our Ajax response script works.  [ 77 ]   Live Blogroll  First, we have created a new file wp-live-blogroll-ajax.php to handle our Ajax  requests. At the beginning of the file we referenced these includes:  require_once ".. .. .. wp-config.php" ; require_once ABSPATH . WPINC . ' rss.php' ;  Notice how we included wp-config.php. This is required because when our JavaScript  calls the file, it will not be a part of WordPress code anymore, so we need to load all the  WordPress functions and variables in order to use them. The easiest way is by including   wp-config.php, which in turn includes all the other necessary WordPress files.  Locating wp-config.php like we did in our example is only a best guess at  where the file is located and will work in most cases.  Since WordPress version 2.6, this file can be relocated anywhere in regards to  plugin folder, so there is no certain way to tell its location. You are advised to  check WordPress Codex for updated information on the topic.  Additionally, we included rss.php for fetch_rss   functionality.  Next, we read the link URL parameter that was passed to our file on the call from JavaScript.  We use the GET method as the Ajax request was using that.     fetch information from GET method $link_url = $_GET['link_url'];  Next, we call the function for handling the feed:     return the result WPLiveRoll_HandleAjax $link_url ;  This function uses an approach similar to the one we have already described. The difference  begins with the feed processing part.  We want to process a number of posts  five by default ; so we slice that number from the  array of feed items:       slice the number of items we need   $feedfile->items = array_slice $feedfile->items, 0, $number ;  Next, we process each feed item and extract the title, link and description:         create HTML out of posts     $result.= '  ';     foreach $feedfile->items as $item         {  [ 7 ]   Chapter 3             fetch the information         $item_title = $item['title'];         $item_link = $item['link'];         $item_description =           WPLiveRoll_GetExcerpt $item['description'] ;  We prepare the code using a HTML list with this information:             form result         $result.= ' <a target="'.$link_target.'"           href="'.$item_link.'"           >'.$item_title.'  '.$item_description.'  ';  In case we had a problem processing the feed, we will return a message:         $result.= '  ';     }       else       {            in case we were unable to parse the feed         $result.= "No posts available";     }  Finally, we return the result using the die   function to end our Ajax response script:         return the HTML code     die  $result  ; }  Using JavaScript with WordPress The main difference between JavaScript and PHP is that JavaScript is client based  it executes  in the user's browser  whereas PHP is server based  it executes on the remote server .   This means JavaScript is good at handling user actions  clicking, moving the mouse, and   so on  while PHP is good at dealing with server variables, database and other things  happening remotely.  This also means that we need to find a way to connect the two. Most of the time, we need a  way to pass variables from PHP to JavaScript and user actions from JavaScript to PHP.  Parsing parameters using wp_localize_script WordPress provides wp_localize_script function which is an elegant way to pass the  parameters to your JavaScript.  wp_localize_script 'wp_live_roll_script', 'LiverollSettings',  array 'plugin_url' => $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url  ;  [ 7 ]   Live Blogroll  First parameter is our script's name followed by the name of JavaScript object that will hold  the settings. Next you can specify the array of parameters.  These parameters will be available in JavaScript and can be accessed as  LiverollSettings.plugin_url  Ajax and WordPress As we have seen, integrating Ajax functionality with WordPress is relatively easy. The basic  Ajax flow chart looks generally like this:  1.  2.  3.  The user does something on the page  like clicking or moving the mouse  and the  JavaScript code is triggered. It then creates and calls another file on the server    Ajax response script . Ajax response script will process the request based on our input parameters and  return the output back to the browser. The returned information is then processed and displayed by the JavaScript in   the browser.  Ajax in admin panel You can see examples of Ajax in the administration panel such as auto-saving of posts,  moderating of comments or managing of your blogroll and categories.  For handling Ajax calls happening in the administration panel, there is another   simple alternative.  The way this works is that we create a function for handling the Ajax request and assign it to  the wp_ajax hook by extending it with the desired name, as shown here:  add_action 'wp_ajax_my_function', 'my_function'  ;  Step two, we make an Ajax call to admin-ajax.php and send the name as a parameter. The  jQuery call would look something like this:  $ 'info' .load 'admin-ajax.php?action=my_function' ;  [ 0 ]   Chapter 3  The most obvious benefit of this approach is that the Ajax handling function can freely be a  part of your main script, and you can easily change it by assigning another function to the  wp_Ajax action.  jQuery.ajax method When we want more control, especially error handling, we will use the more advanced  Ajax   function.  This function accepts several parameters of interest:              type: The type of request to make  'POST' or 'GET' ; the default is GET. url: The URL to be requested timeout: A set of local timeouts in miliseconds  ms  for the request success: A function to be called if the request succeeds error: A function to be called if the request fails async: By default, all requests are sent asynchronously. If you need synchronous  requests, set this option to false. Synchronous requests may temporarily lock the  browser, until the request is finished  Let's use this more advanced function in our JavaScript now.  Time for action – Use advanced Ajax call In this example, we will replace the simple Ajax call with a more advanced one that offers us  more options and controls.  Open the wp-live-blogroll.js.php file and replace the load   function with the  ajax   function:  $.ajax   {    type: "GET",    url: LiverollSettings.plugin_url + ' wp-live-blogroll-ajax.php',    timeout: 3000,     data:     {      link_url: this.href    },    success: function msg       {  [ 1 ]   Live Blogroll       jQuery 'lb_popup' .html msg ;      jQuery 'lb_popup' .fadeIn 300 ;     },    error: function msg       {      jQuery 'lb_popup' .html 'Error: ' + msg.responseText ;    } }   What just happened? We have used an advanced jQuery function for handling the Ajax request, which obviously  offers us more parameters.  The function allows us to specify the request type  'POST' or 'GET' , maximum script timeout  and handlers for success and error results. This gives us full control over the events.  Full reference of the Ajax   function and available parameters are available at   http:  docs.jquery.com Ajax jQuery.Ajax  Ajax script security using nonces WordPress provides a simple to use, but powerful security mechanism to protect your scripts  from unauthorised execution by using the so called nonces.  Nonce means number used once and represents a unique number much like a password  generated each time the script runs. The idea is to use nonces in order to verify whether our  request was authentic.   Time for action – Add a security nonce  1.	 Open the wp-live-blogroll.js.php file and add create a nonce at the   beginning of the script:               function WPLiveRoll_ScriptsAction    {   global $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url;   if  !is_admin      {        create a nonce  [ 2 ]   Chapter 3      $nonce = wp_create_nonce 'wp-live-blogroll' ;      wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'wp_live_roll_script',      $wp_live_blogroll_plugin_url.' wp-live-blogroll.js',      array 'jquery'  ;                      } }  2.  Modify the Ajax call to include the generated nonce as an additional parameter:     $.ajax      {       type: "GET",       url: LiverollSettings.plugin_url + ' wp-live-blogroll-ajax.php',       timeout: 3000,                           data:         {          link_url: this.href,          _ajax_nonce: ' '        },         success: function msg           {  3.  Modify wp-live-blogroll-ajax.php and add this check at the beginning of Ajax   handler function:           function WPLiveRoll_Handle ajax $link_url  {        check security     check_ajax_referer  "wp-live-blogroll"  ;  With this simple modification, we have made sure that our Ajax handling script is used only  when our plugin calls it.  What just happened? When our script is run the next time, a unique nonce is created using the   wp_create_nonce   function. We use a nonce identifier as a parameter:      $nonce = wp_create_nonce  'wp-live-blogroll'  ;  [ 3 ]   Live Blogroll  We then pass this nonce as the Ajax_nonce parameter. WordPress checks this   parameter automatically in the check_ajax_referer function, which also uses the   nonce identifier parameter:          check_ajax_referer  "wp-live-blogroll"  ;  If the check fails, the script will simply exit at that point  internally, die -1  happens .  Quick reference wp_create_nonce nonce_id : It creates a unique nonce using the  identifier. check_ajax_referer nonce_id : It is used to check Ajax nonces;  passed as the ajax_nonce parameter, using the nonce identifier.

Summary  We have come a long way from the initial concept to the final plugin. We have learned that  using jQuery and Ajax with WordPress does not have to be hard.  The Live Blogroll plugin we created made our blogroll more attractive and interactive. When  the user hovers the mouse over the links, a list of recent posts is displayed using Ajax to  retrieve the information. We learned how to use Ajax with high-level jQuery functions and  easily process the retrieved data.  Specifically, we covered:              Blogroll: Accessing and modifying information using WordPress filters hook Fetching RSS feeds: Using built-in WordPress functionality with caching Use scripts and other code in   section: Including JavaScript and CSS files  using WordPress action hooks Using jQuery: Setting up a jQuery file, with its powerful set of functions, and using it  later with Ajax support Ajax: Integrating Ajax with our scripts, and using it to generate content dynamically Using nonces: Securing your WordPress plugins using nonces  Both jQuery and Ajax offer huge possibilities for plugin development. Making your plugins  interact more with the users is definitely a trend to follow in the future.   The next step in our journey through WordPress plugin development will be a cool, Ajax- powered, Wall widget allowing users to leave comments much like a shoutbox.  [ 4 ]   4The Wall  As you may have noticeed, this chapter carries the name of a famous album, which rocked  the music world back in 1982. The artists used an unusual mix of music and film to produce  an exceptional piece of art.  In this chapter, we will be using the same mixed approach, by taking advantage of creative  WordPress and JavaScript techniques, in order to create an Ajax powered 'Wall' for your  blog's sidebar.  We will be relying on what we have learned so far—WordPress hooks, API calls, and jQuery.  We will also introduce a way to use built-in WordPress functionalities to achieve our project  goals—saving both effort and time.  This chapter will introduce quite a few interesting techniques such as:  Creating a special type of plugin—the Widget Storing the wall comments in the database—working with WordPress database Enter data in the form and updating the wall dynamically—Ajax form submit  You will learn these techniques by:  Creating the Wall widget that appears in your blog's side bar. Users can add a quick  comment and it will appear in the sidebar immediately  without reloading the page .           The Wall  The wall will increase the usability of any blog by presenting a global meeting place for all  users to communicate.  [ 6 ]             1. 2.  3.  The main concepts behind the Wall plugin  Before we start with our plugin, let's take a moment and create a design outline covering the  main areas of the plugin.  Chapter 4  Widget: Obviously, the first thing on our list is to create a sidebar area for the wall.  We will use WordPress widget API to do that. Wall Comments: We will store the user comments in the WordPress database. Comment Management: The administrator needs to be able to access comments,  and approve, disapprove, or delete them. Security and Spam protection: Being on the front page and on most other pages of  our site, the wall is exposed to various threats. We need to think of a way to protect  our blog from unwanted spam. Options and Styling: Last but not least, we want to be able to customize the   look of the widget. Since the wall will be constrained within a relatively small area    the sidebar , we need to carefully plan the look and the functionality of the widget.  The main development concerns here are the management of comments, and   spam protection.  A typical PHP approach to address these concerns would be:  Create a database to store the comments in. Create an administrative backend with comment management functionality.  Implement a set of rules for combating spam, such as black lists, user IP bans,   and so on.  It is obvious that this approach needs a long development time. On the other hand, this is  a book about WordPress, which is arguably the best blogging platform in the world today.  Blogging includes a lot of commenting, and WordPress already features one of the most  advanced commenting engines available. So why just not take advantage of it?  The main principle behind our idea is to dedicate a WordPress page as a place holder for  all user comments. This allows us to use the WordPress commenting engine to take care of  most of the hard work, such as adding the comments, administrative management and best  of all—spam protection.  [ 7 ]   The Wall  WordPress already comes with built-in comment spam and flood protection.  There are also a number of popular anti-spam plugins such as Akismet that deal with the  problem of spam in the comments. So instead of reinventing the wheel, we will leave these  dedicated plugins to do the job.  By using built-in WordPress functionalities whenever we can, we also provide the opportunity  for the plugin to develop itself automatically with the development of WordPress. For  example, if the next version of WordPress brings comment editing in a super cool 3D way,   all comments for our widget will become editable in the same way automatically.  This will allow us to spend more time focusing on other areas of the widget—like deciding  which jQuery effects we can use to make it more attractive.  [  ]   Chapter 4  Use built-in WordPress functionalities whenever you can. Try to think outside  of the box and find features of WordPress that can help you with your plugin.  Always try to find fresh ways to re-use the code that a large community of  WordPress developers has already contributed. It saves time and gets you   free upgrades.  Creating a widget  Creating widgets is a simple three step process.  1. 2. 3.  Create a function that will display the widget content. Register that function as a widget using WordPress API. Done! To enable the widget you need to activate it now in the administration panel.  Let's start our widget by displaying the 'Hello World!' text in the sidebar.  Time for action – Create a 'Hello World!' widget As usual, we will start building our plugin with the necessary plugin information.   Later, we will create a function to display Hello World text and then register that function as  a widget.   Cr at  a n w fold r call d wp-wall. Cr at  a n w wp-wall.php file. Insert the following plugin information:  * Plugin Name: WP Wall Version: 0.1 Description: "Wall" widget that appears in your blog's side bar   Users can add a quick comment and it will appear in the    1. 2.               sidebar immediately  without reloading the page .            Author: Vladimir Prelovac Author URI: http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir Plugin URI: http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir   wordpress-plugins wp-wall *      global $wp_version;  $exit_msg='WP Wall requires WordPress 2.6 or newer.          Please      update! ';  [  ]   The Wall           if  version_compare $wp_version,"2.3","<"   {     exit  $exit_msg ; }  3.  Add a variable that will hold the path to our plugin. We will use it later.    $wp_wall_plugin_url =  trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.     dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;  4.  Add the function for displaying the text:      function WPWall_Widget     {       echo "Hello World!";                         }  ?>  5.  Register our function as a widget. We do this by hooking to init action and using   register_sidebar_widget call: function WPWall_Init     {        register widget     register_sidebar_widget 'WP Wall', 'WPWall_Widget' ; }  add_action 'init', 'WPWall_Init' ;  6.  Now upload and enable our plugin. Our widget will appear on the widgets page of  the administrative panel. In order to make it active, you need to drag and drop it  onto the sidebar.  [ 0 ]   Chapter 4  [ 1 ]   The Wall  7.  Visit your site and you will notice the Hello World! text printed on your sidebar.    I know it is not pretty yet, but we just wanted to get it out there for now.  What just happened? The action hook init executes just after WordPress has finished loading. It is a good choice  for inserting general plugin initialization code such as registering widgets. We use it to insert  our init function:  add_action 'init', 'WPWall_Init' ;  The widget is registered in WordPress with register_sidebar_widget   taking the  widget name and the callback function responsible for drawing the widget.  function WPWall_Init     {        register widget     register_sidebar_widget 'WP Wall', 'WPWall_Widget' ; }  In our case, the callback function simply prints out the Hello World! text on the screen.  function WPWall_Widget     {      echo "Hello World!";  }  [ 2 ]   Register widgets with description The official WordPress documentation encourages the use of the register_sidebar_ widget   function for compatibility reasons, instead of the more powerful wp_register_ sidebar_widget  .  The latter function allows us to enter the widget description, shown on the widgets screen.  Chapter 4  Alternatively, you can use this code to register widget:  $widget_optionss = array 'classname' => 'WPWall_Widget',   'description' => "A comments 'Wall' for your sidebar."  ;  wp_register_sidebar_widget 'WPWall_Widget', 'WP Wall',   'WPWall_Widget', $widget_options ;  Which shows a description for the widget:  Quick reference Init: Action best used for initializing plugin data ad registering widgets. register_sidebar_widget $name, $callback : Registers a widget  with a name and a callback function parameter. More information is available at:  http:  automattic.com code widgets plugins  wp_register_sidebar_widget $id, $name, $callback,  $options : A more powerful way to register widgets allowing us to specify  the description in the options.  [ 3 ]   The Wall  Widget controls  Widgets have a control panel that can be changed, for example, to add options for the widget.  WordPress also provides a mechanism to make your widget compatible with various  themes. It does this by passing several parameters to your widget's callback function. These  parameters include the necessary tags and CSS classes which we need to include in order not  to 'break' the theme.  Time for action – Expanding the widget with controls In this example, we will expand our widget by adding additional widget features available   to us through WordPress.  We will also learn how to read and save plugin options using WordPress.   1.                                            Add the function to handle our widget control panel. It will parse the submitted  data, save the title and print out the form: function WPWall_WidgetControl     {         get saved options     $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;                     handle user input     if   $_POST["wall_submit"]         {         $options['wall_title'] = strip_tags  stripslashes            $_POST["wall_title"]    ;                 update_option 'wp_wall', $options ;     }      $title = $options['wall_title'];             print out the widget control             include 'wp-wall-widget-control.php' ; }  [ 4 ]                                                         }  }  Chapter 4  2.  Change our init function to register the widget control panel:  function WPWall_Init     {         register widget     register_sidebar_widget 'WP Wall', 'WPWall_Widget' ;         register widget control     register_widget_control 'WP Wall', 'WPWall_WidgetControl' ;  3.  Create the file, wp-wall-widget-control.php. This file will contain the HTML  code of the control panel, and we can then simply include   it in our code. It is  easier to edit and maintain the files this way. Here are the contents of our form:                          Title: <input  name="wall_title"      type="text" value=" "  >   <input type="hidden" id="wall_submit" name="wall_submit"                                                    value="1"  >       4.  Edit the WPWall_Widget   function to output  the title and theme    compatibility code:  function WPWall_Widget $args = array      {         extract the parameters     extract $args ;         get our options     $options=get_option 'wp_wall' ;     $title=$options['wall_title'];         print the theme compatibility code     echo $before_widget;      echo $before_title . $title. $after_title;         include our widget     include 'wp-wall-widget.php' ;      echo $after_widget;  5.  Similarly, create wp-wall-widget.php and move the Hello World! there.     Hello World!   [ 5 ]   The Wall  6.  Upload all the new files and visit the Widgets panel.  You can see that our widget has gained an input form where you can type in the title  and then click on the Save Changes button, to save the changes.  7.  The changes are also immediately visible on our sidebar:  [ 6 ]   Chapter 4  What just happened? By registering the widget control panel, we gained the ability to show and save the settings  relevant to our widget.  To register a widget control, simply call register_widget_control   with the name of  the callback function that will handle the control panel:     register widget control register_widget_control 'WP Wall', 'WPWall_WidgetControl' ;  The function can also accept two additional optional parameters–the desired width and  height of the control. But you can safely leave them at the default settings.  WordPress options Let's see how we use WordPress to store our plugin options.  WordPress provides two easy-to-use functions to handle plugin and widget options:   get_option   to retrieve the options and update_option   to save them into   the database.  Both accept the option name parameter—a unique identifier used to identify your option  in the WordPress database. It is important to use a unique option name so that your option  does not conflict with other plugins.  Use get_option   to retrieve the options:  $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;  Use update_option   to save the options. The $options variable is very flexible; for  example, it can be either an object or an array:     $options can be a string – or an array update_option 'wp_wall', $options ;  We will cover options again in more detail when we cover the creation of your plugin options  page later in the book.  Display widget control We creat d wp-wall-widget-control.php, an external file to store our widget panel. It  contains the title input field:   Title: <input  name="wall_title"  type="text"    value=" "  >  <input type="hidden" id="wall_submit" name="wall_submit" value="1"   >  [ 7 ]   The Wall  Our WPWall_WidgetControl   function retrieves the saved title and prints the form:  function WPWall_WidgetControl     {         get saved options     $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;      $title = $options['wall_title'];         print out the widget control     include 'wp-wall-widget-control.php' ; }  Handling widget input When the user submits the form, the widget control function is called again, and we can use  it to parse the submitted data.  We can check for submit action by inspecting the $_POST["wall_submit"], and then proceed  to extract the title from wall_title field to store it in the database:  function WPWall_WidgetControl     {         get saved options     $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;         handle user input     if   $_POST["wall_submit"]        {         $options['wall_title'] = strip_tags  stripslashes            $_POST["wall_title"]  ;          update_option 'wp_wall', $options ;     }      $title = $options['wall_title'];         print out the widget control             include 'wp-wall-widget-control.php' ; }  We use strip_tags and stripslashes to remove HTML and any other malformed code  the user may enter.   Handling widget output Now we need to show the widget on the sidebar. In order to achieve theme compatibility, we  will display special parameters sent to our widget.  [  ]   Chapter 4  So first, we will extract the parameters:  function WPWall_Widget $args = array      {        extract the parameters     extract $args ;  The most important ones are before_widget, before_title, after_title, and  after_widget which contains the code we need to print out.  function WPWall_Widget $args    {        extract the parameters     extract $args ;         get our options     $options=get_option 'wp_wall' ;     $title=$options['wall_title'];         print the theme compatibility code     echo $before_widget;      echo $before_title . $title. $after_title;                     include our widget     include 'wp-wall-widget.php' ;      echo $after_widget; }  The widget file currently just displays our Hello World!message.   Hello World!   For users of non-widgetized themes For those users of your widget who do not have widget-enabled themes, it is  advisable to provide instructions in your readme.txt file on how to use   the plugin. This usually includes instructions to call the widget output function  in our   case WPWall_Widget    directly from somewhere within the user's theme  sidebar template.  [  ]   The Wall  Quick reference get_option $key : Retrieves the option specified by the key name. If  the option does not exist, it returns FALSE.

The function  accepts the name of the control, the callback function to process information  and optional width and height parameters. More information can be found at:  http:  automattic.com code widgets plugins   Create a WordPress page from the code  Now that we have covered everything we need regarding the widget, the next thing on our  list is creating a WordPress page, which will be a placeholder for our wall comments.  WordPress comments do not specifically need to be assigned to a post or page; they can  exist on their own. However, having them assigned to a page makes it easier to follow them.  Moreover, should you decide to remove all the comments at once, you would only need to  delete that page.  Time for action – Insert a page We want to create the page at WordPress initialization. So we will use the init action just as  we used it earlier.  We also want to be able to check if the page has already been created, so we will save the  page ID in the options.  Let's start with modifying the init function to include page check and create code: function WPWall_Init     {         register widget     register_sidebar_widget 'WP Wall', 'WPWall_Widget' ;         register widget control     register_widget_control 'WP Wall', 'WPWall_WidgetControl' ;  1.                          $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;         get our wall pageId  [ 100 ]   Chapter 4      $pageId=$options['pageId'];         check if the actual post exists     $actual_post=get_post $pageId ;         check if the page is already created         if  !$pageId  !$actual_post                 $pageId!=$actual_post->ID              {            create the page and save it's ID         $options['pageId'] = WPWall_CreatePage  ;          update_option 'wp_wall', $options ;     } }  2.  Next, we want to create a function for inserting a page into the WordPress database  function WPWall_CreatePage     {         create post object     class mypost       {         var $post_title;         var $post_content;         var $post_status;         var $post_type;    can be 'page' or 'post'         var $comment_status;    open or closed for commenting     }         initialize the post object     $mypost = new mypost  ;             fill it with data     $mypost->post_title = 'WP Wall Guestbook';     $mypost->post_content = 'Welcome to my WP Wall Guestbook!';     $mypost->post_status = 'draft';     $mypost->post_type = 'page';     $mypost->comment_status = 'open';         insert the post and return it's ID     return wp_insert_post $mypost ; }                                                                      [ 101 ]   The Wall  3.  The next time WordPress loads, a new page will be created:  We've got a placeholder page for our Wall!  What just happened? The code that we inserted into the init, so that the function executes with the next  WordPress reload, does a couple of things. First, it checks if there is an already created page  by retrieving the saved page ID from the options.  $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;    get our wall pageId $pageId=$options['pageId'];  Next, it tries to get a WordPress post associated with this ID. This way, we can check if the  page still exists  the user could have accidently deleted it .  We are using the get_post   function, which returns a post object taking an ID as   a parameter:     check if the actual post exists $actual_post=get_post $pageId ;  If the page does not exist, we will create it and save the ID in the options:     check if the page is already created if  !$pageId  !$actual_post   $pageId!=$actual_post->ID    {       create the page and save it's ID    $options['pageId']=    WPWall_CreatePage  ;    update_option 'wp_wall', $options ; }  [ 102 ]   Let's take a look now at WPWall_CreatePage   which handles page creation.  In order to insert a post into the WordPress database, we need to specify relevant post  information. An elegant way to do this is to create a post object:  Chapter 4  function WPWall_CreatePage     {         create post object     class mypost       {         var $post_title;         var $post_content;         var $post_status;     draft, published         var $post_type;       can be 'page' or 'post'         var $comment_status;    open or closed for commenting     }         initialize the post object     $mypost = new mypost  ;  Next, we fill the variables. We will give our post a distinguishable title so that users can find   it easily.  We also want to set the status of the page to Draft instead of Published– as we do not want  this page to appear on the site at this moment:     fill it with data     $mypost->post_title = 'WP Wall';     $mypost->post_content =  "This is a placeholder page for your       WP Wall. Do not delete or publish this page.";     $mypost->post_status = 'draft';     $mypost->post_type = 'page';     $mypost->comment_status = 'open';  Finally, we want to insert the post into the WordPress database by using   wp_insert_post  . It will return an ID of the post, which we will save for later use.         insert the post and return it's ID     return wp_insert_post $mypost ; }  This completes the process of inserting a post into the database.  [ 103 ]   The Wall  Quick reference get_post $id, $output : Takes the post ID and returns the database  record for that post. Data can be in any of the various formats specified by  the optional output parameter, and defaults to object. If the post does not  exist, it returns null. More information can be found at: http:  codex. wordpress.org Function_Reference get_post wp_insert_post $post : Function to insert posts and pages to WordPress  database. Post can be an object or array containing information about the post  such as post_title, post_content, post_type, and so on. Returns the  ID of the post on success; otherwise returns 0. More information can be found  at: http:  codex.wordpress.org Function_Reference   wp_insert_post  Handling user input  We have sorted out where to keep the user comments, so now we can move onto the  comment form and user input.  Since we already have our widget set up, the next step will just involve editing the   wp-wall-widget.php file and inserting the HTML for the form.  We want the form to have two fields: one for the name and the other for the comment text.  Users who are logged-in will be recognized, and their name will be filled-in automatically.  Time for action – Create the wall comment form To create our form, we will simply edit the HTML of our widget file.  1.                            Edit the wp-wall-widget.php file and replace the 'Hello World!' code with the  following code:                               Logged in as <a href="<?php echo          get_bloginfo 'wpurl' ; ?> wp-admin profile.php">          .                            Name     [ 104 ]                                                                              Chapter 4        <input type="text" name="author" id="author" value=""          tabindex="1"   >                                   Comment          <textarea name="comment" id="comment" rows="3"          tabindex="2">                  <input name="submit_wall_post" type="submit"         id="submit_wall_post" tabindex="3" value="Submit"  >                2.  The form we created uses the global variables $user_ID and    $user_identity to check if the user is logged in. We will reference   them in the WPWall_Widget   function:  function WPWall_Widget $args    {      global  $user_ID,  $user_identity;         extract the parameters     extract $args ;  3.  Let's also add CSS to our form to spice it up. Create the file, wp-wall.css:  wp_wall p {     margin-top:4px;     margin-bottom:4px; } wallcomments p {     margin-top:5px;     margin-bottom:5px; } wall_post input   {     border: 1px solid cccccc; }  [ 105 ]   The Wall                   4.  We need to make sure our CSS loads by adding the code for the wp_head action at   the end of the wp-wall.php file:  add_action 'wp_head', 'WPWall_HeadAction'  ;  function WPWall_HeadAction   {     global $wp_wall_plugin_url;      echo '<link rel="stylesheet" href="'.$wp_wall_plugin_url.'       wp-wall.css" type="text css"  >'; }  5.  And the final result will look like this:  6.  When the admin user is logged in, it will look like this:  Soon, we will be able to actually process the submitted content and display it.  [ 106 ]   Chapter 4  What just happened? Our widget now shows an HTML form with the name and comment area.                      Name          <input type="text" name="author" id="author" value=""          tabindex="1"  >                     Comment          <textarea name="comment" id="comment" rows="3"          tabindex="2">                    <input name="submit_wall_post" type="submit"          id="submit_wall_post" tabindex="3" value="Submit"  >              We also added a check to see if the current user is logged in.  In order to do that, we referenced the global variables $user_ID and $user_identity.  Those variables provided by WordPress hold the ID of the currently logged in user with a  matching user name:  global  $user_ID, $user_identity;  If the user_ID variable contains a valid ID, it means the user is logged in. In that case, we  can print the logged-in user's details.             Logged in as <a href="<?php echo          get_bloginfo 'wpurl' ; ?> wp-admin profile.php">      .   Otherwise, just print the input field for the name:                       Name          <input type="text" name="author" id="author" value=""          tabindex="1"   >  [ 107 ]   The Wall                          Comment                  <textarea name="comment" id="comment" rows="3"          tabindex="2">         We load the CSS file using the wp_head action, which we also used in the previous chapter. It  allows us to insert scripts and CSS style references directly into the   of the document:  add_action 'wp_head', 'WPWall_HeadAction'  ; function WPWall_HeadAction   {     global $wp_wall_plugin_url;     echo '<link rel="stylesheet" href="'.$wp_wall_plugin_url.'       wp-wall.css" type="text css"  >'; }  We have prepared for the actual handling of the comments. We have the widget and the  form ready, so we are ready for our next task—handling submitted comments.  Managing Ajax comment submit  We will now expand our Ajax knowledge with Ajax submit form technique.  The principle remains the same. jQuery will respond to an event  in this case, a user   submitting the form  and instead of reloading the page, it will call an external script and  display the results.  Our script on the other end will receive form information, and after validation, insert the  comment into the WordPress database.  Finally, we will show a status message to the user, letting them know that the comment has  been accepted:  [ 10 ]   Chapter 4  Time for action – Save the comments In this example, we will learn how to handle submit forms using Ajax.  We will also learn how to save the comments in the WordPress database.  1.  Create the wp-wall-ajax.php file which will handle submitted form  through a  series of simple checks: <?php  require_once ".. .. .. wp-config.php" ;  if  $_POST['submit_wall_post']  {      $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;      $comment_post_ID=$options['pageId'];     $actual_post=get_post $comment_post_ID ;         sanity check to see if our page exists     if  !$comment_post_ID  !$actual_post         $comment_post_ID!=$actual_post->ID        {         wp_die 'Sorry, there was a problem posting your comment.           Please try again.' ;     }         extract data we need     $comment_author = trim strip_tags $_POST['author']  ;     $comment_content = trim $_POST['comment'] ;         If the user is logged in get his name     $user = wp_get_current_user  ;     if   $user->ID            $comment_author  = $user->display_name;         check if the fields are filled             if   '' == $comment_author           wp_die 'Error: please type a name.' ;      if   '' == $comment_content           wp_die 'Error: please type a comment.' ;         insert the comment     $commentdata = compact 'comment_post_ID', 'comment_author',                'comment_content', 'user_ID' ;      $comment_id = wp_new_comment  $commentdata  ;         check if the comment is approved     $comment = get_comment $comment_id ;  [ 10 ]                                                                                                                                                                               The Wall      if  $comment->comment_approved==0          wp_die 'Your comment is awaiting moderation.' ;        return status     die   'OK'  ; } ?>  2.  Now, create the wp-wall.js file to handle our jQuery and Ajax stuff:     setup everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $  {     $ 'wallform' .ajaxForm {         handler function for success event     success: function responseText, statusText        {       $ 'wallresponse' .html '         '+'Thank you for your comment!'+' ' ;     },        handler function for errors     error: function request  {           parse it for WordPress error       if  request.responseText.search   WordPress         &rsaquo; Error    != -1          {         var data = request.responseText.match    .*    ;         $ 'wallresponse' .html ' '+           data[1] +' ' ;       }         else         {         $ 'wallresponse' .html ' An           error occurred, please notify the           administrator. ' ;        }     } ,     beforeSubmit: function formData, jqForm, options  {           clear response div       $ 'wallresponse' .empty  ;                                     }   } ; } ;  3.  We now need to load our script, jQuery and jQuery-Form libraries. The latter is used   for handling Ajax form submits.   [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  Add this code at the end of wp-wall.php: add_action 'wp_print_scripts', 'WPWall_ScriptsAction' ;     function WPWall_ScriptsAction    {     global $wp_wall_plugin_url;          wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'jquery-form' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'wp_wall_script',$wp_wall_plugin_url.                         ' wp-wall.js', array 'jquery', 'jquery-form'  ; }  4.  Add the URL to our Ajax handler script to the form's action field in wp-wall-  widget.php. This is the script that will be called when the user clicks on Submit.     <form action="<?php echo $wp_wall_plugin_url.'      wp-wall-ajax.php'; ?>" method="post" id="wallform">       5.  Add a   for script responses at the end of the form. We will use it to show    status messages:      <input name="submit_wall_post" type="submit"        id="submit_wall_post" tabindex="3" value="Submit"  >                     6.  Update all the files. You are now ready to post comments:                            [ 111 ]   The Wall  7.  And if you go to the Manage Comments administration panel you can see our   comments listed:  Congratulations! An important part of the plugin functionality has been achieved.  We can now add as many comments as we want and manage them through our WordPress  administration panel.  What just happened? When the user submits a form, normally the URL given in the form's action is called:  <form action="<?php echo $wp_wall_plugin_url.   ' wp-wall-ajax.php'; ?>" method="post" id="wallform">  If we do not use jQuery Ajax to handle submissions, our browser will load wp-wall-ajax. php as a new page and show the output of the script.  However, jQuery form library allows us to assign form submissions to Ajax calls easily.  [ 112 ]   Chapter 4  So we have loaded all the necessary libraries using the wp_print_scripts action hook:  add_action 'wp_print_scripts', 'WPWall_ScriptsAction' ;  function WPWall_ScriptsAction    {     global $wp_wall_plugin_url;      wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'jquery-form' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'wp_wall_script', $wp_wall_plugin_url.'       wp-wall.js', array 'jquery', 'jquery-form'  ; }  Using Ajax to submit forms The jQuery form module provides the ajaxForm   method, which can automatically handle  form submits using Ajax. It hooks to necessary events  like the user pressing the Submit  button , submits the form dynamically using an Ajax call and displays the results.  We use the ajaxForm method with wallform, which is the ID of our form:     setup everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $    {     $ 'wallform' .ajaxForm       {   The ajaxForm   function provides three useful events we can use for extra configuration.  The first is beforeSubmit, which executes just before the form is submitted. It is usually  used to process the fields or do some kind of form validation.   In our case, we will clear the response  .      $ 'wallform' .ajaxForm       {          beforeSubmit: function formData, jqForm, options           {                 clear response div             $ 'wallresponse' .empty  ;         }     } ; } ;  Next, we will hook up to the error event, which executes in the event of a script failure.   [ 113 ]   The Wall  Since we are using wp_die   to exit our comment handling script, we need to parse   the response:      setup everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $   {    $ 'wallform' .ajaxForm     {         handler function for errors     error: function request        {           parse it for WordPress error       if  request.responseText.search   WordPress         &rsaquo; Error    != -1  {  If the response is valid, we extract the error message and print it out in our   wallresponse div:             parse it for WordPress error         if  request.responseText.search   WordPress           &rsaquo; Error    != -1            {            var data = request.responseText.match    .*    ;           $ 'wallresponse' .html ' '+             data[1] +' ' ;  Since we are using WordPress comment handling, we can expect errors ranging from  duplicate comments, comment flooding, protection, and so on. We get all this comment  checking functionality for free.  [ 114 ]   In case of wrong or malformed error response, we will print out a default error message:  Chapter 4  }   else  {     $ 'wallresponse' .html '      An error occurred, please notify the      administrator. ' ; } }, beforeSubmit: function formData, jqForm, options    {        clear response div    $ 'wallresponse' .empty  ;  }  Finally, we will hook up to the success event, which will run when our comment is submitted  successfully. If everything goes fine, we will print out a simple 'Thank you' message:     setup everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $    {      $ 'wallform' .ajaxForm {          handler function for success event     success: function responseText, statusText        {         $ 'wallresponse' .html ' '+'Thank          you for your comment!'+' ' ;      },         handler function for errors     error: function request        {  Saving comments in WordPress post Let's see how the submitted comments are parsed and saved by WordPress.  We check the $_POST variable first to confirm that a comment is being posted:      if  $_POST['submit_wall_post']      {  [ 115 ]   The Wall  Next, a sanity check is performed to see if everything is all right with our wall page that is  used for saving the comments:      $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;      $comment_post_ID=$options['pageId'];     $actual_post=get_post $comment_post_ID ;         sanity check to see if our page exists     if  !$comment_post_ID  !$actual_post         $comment_post_ID!=$actual_post->ID        {         wp_die 'Sorry, there was a problem posting your comment.           Please try again.' ;     }  We use wp_die   to exit from our script in case of an error, passing it the error message.  This will also automatically cause the Ajax call to return an error status.  Next, we extract the comment fields from the $_POST variable:         extract data we need     $comment_author = trim strip_tags $_POST['author']  ;     $comment_content = trim $_POST['comment'] ;  If the user is logged in, we want to use his display name as the comment author's name.  To do this, we use wp_get_current_user  . It returns an object containing user  information such as user ID and name.         If the user is logged in get his name     $user = wp_get_current_user  ;     if   $user->ID         $comment_author  = $user->display_name;  Now, we can proceed to insert the comment. First, we use compact   to fill the comment  data into an array, passing it the variables we need. We insert the comment using the   wp_new_comment function.         insert the comment     $commentdata = compact 'comment_post_ID', 'comment_author',      'comment_content', 'user_ID' ;      $comment_id = wp_new_comment  $commentdata  ;  [ 116 ]   Chapter 4  After the comment is inserted, we check to see if it was approved or not. Some blog  administrators like to keep all the comments for approval, in which case the comment will  not show up immediately:         check if the comment is approved     $comment = get_comment $comment_id ;      if  $comment->comment_approved==0        wp_die 'Your comment is awaiting moderation.' ;  Finally, if everything is ok, we use die   method to just exit the script. The parameter is  optional in this case, as we are not showing it anywhere:         return status     die   'OK'  ; }  Quick reference ajaxForm options   jQuery : Used to submit forms with Ajax. The options  object has among others are the success, error and the beforeSubmit  callback events.

Dynamically load comments  We are now ready to display the comments we entered on our wall. They are already saved  in the WordPress database, so just we need to extract and show them on our widget.  We will also create a mechanism to reload the comments automatically when the user  submits the form.   [ 117 ]   The Wall  Time for action – Display the comments  1.           Add a new function, WPWall_ShowComments   at the end of wp-wall.php: function WPWall_ShowComments     {     global $wpdb;         get our page id      $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;     $pageId=$options['pageId'];         number of comments to display     $number=5;      $result='';         get comments from WordPress database      $comments = $wpdb->get_results       "SELECT *       FROM $wpdb->comments        WHERE comment_approved = '1' AND comment_post_ID=$pageId         AND NOT  comment_type = 'pingback' OR comment_type =         'trackback'        ORDER BY comment_date_gmt DESC LIMIT $number      " ;     if   $comments         {          display comments one by one       foreach  $comments as $comment          {         $result.= '  ' .           $comment->comment_author.'  :          '.$comment->comment_content.'  ';       }     }     return $result; }  2.  Add the code to display comments to our widget. Edit the wp-wall-widget.php file   and add a 'wallcomments' div, inside which we will display our comments:                                          [ 11 ]                                                                                         Chapter 4  3.  Add this CSS to the end of wp-wall.css to style our comments:  wallcomments   {     margin-bottom: 5px;      * uncomment this for fixed height and a scrollbar     height: 200px;     overflow: auto; *  } .wallauthor   {     font-weight:bold; } .wallcomment   {     font-weight:normal; }  Reload the page, and you can see the comments:  4.  Let's also reload the comments when the user posts a new one.  We will use an ajaxForm target property to display the results from our script: jQuery document .ready function $    {     $ 'wallform' .ajaxForm {         target identifies the element s  to update with the server       response      target: 'wallcomments',         handler function for success event     success: function responseText, statusText        {  [ 11 ]                                                     The Wall  5.  Modify wp-wall-ajax.php script so it returns the comments:                       if  $comment->comment_approved==0          wp_die 'Your comment is awaiting moderation.' ;          return status       die   WPWall_ShowComments    ;     } } ?>  6.  Our plugin is fully working now. The new comments now appear without the    page reload.  Good job!  We got the plugin working exactly as we wanted.  What just happened? Our n w WPWall_ShowComments   function is responsible for showing the user comments.  It does this by executing a WordPress database query to get the recent comments.  WordPress database query The WordPress database queries are easy thanks to the wpdb WordPress class. It   provides the interface for handling database manipulations. In this case, we will use   the get_results   method to retrieve the rows from the database quickly.  [ 120 ]   First, we prepare the information for the query, such as pageId and the number   of comments:  Chapter 4  function WPWall_ShowComments     {     global $wpdb;         get our page id     $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;     $pageId=$options['pageId'];         number of comments to display     $number=5;      $result='';  Next, we need to prepare the query.  Let's analyze it for a moment.  We want to SELECT all comments FROM the comments table referenced by   $wpdb->comments. This is the comments table of WordPress.  Our function WHERE states that we need comments posted under our Wall page, and not of  the pingback or trackback types, which are special types of comments.  At the end, we want to sort the comments by comment date in descending order    DESC ORDER , and LIMIT them to the last five.  Here is the actual query:         get comments from WordPress database         $comments = $wpdb->get_results       "SELECT *       FROM $wpdb->comments        WHERE comment_approved = '1' AND comment_post_ID=$pageId        AND NOT  comment_type = 'pingback' OR comment_type =         'trackback'        ORDER BY comment_date_gmt DESC        LIMIT $number      " ;  Comment output By dividing the author name and the actual comment into separate CSS classes, later, the  user can  control the display though the CSS file.      if   $comments         {          display comments one by one  [ 121 ]   The Wall        foreach  $comments as $comment          {         $result.= '  ' . $comment-          >comment_author.'  :           '.$comment->comment_content.'  ';       }     }     return $result; }  Displaying the comments We use our new function to show the comments within a wallcomments    n   our widget:                             Next, by using the target parameter of the ajaxForm   function, we can specify  where we want the Ajax script response to be directed to. This allows us to fill in the  wallcomments   with new information.  $ 'wallform' .ajaxForm   {         target identifies the element s  to update with the       server response     target: 'wallcomments',  Finally, we needed to make sure that our script returns comments instead of just 'OK'.         return status     die   WPWall_ShowComments    ;  We have now achieved our desired functionality. The comments are submitted with Ajax,  and added to the database, while the last few are retrieved and shown on the page.  Quick function reference $wpdb: WordPress database interface class. Use $wpdb->get_results    to get rows for a given query quickly. More information can be found at:  http:  codex.wordpress.org Function_Reference   wpdb_Class  [ 122 ]   Chapter 4  Ajax security  F nally, we want to add a layer of security to our plugin. We will use nonces similar to those  in the Live Blogroll plugin.  Time for action – Display the comments  1.  Edit the wp-wall-widget.php file and add a nonce to the form using   wp_nonce_field:      <form action="<?php echo $wp_wall_plugin_url.' wp-wall-ajax.php';       ?>" method="post" id="wallform">                   2.  Add the check for nonce in the wp-wall-ajax.php file:      if  $_POST['submit_wall_post']      {            security check         check_ajax_referer 'wp-wall' ;         $options = get_option 'wp_wall' ;  What just happened? Adding nonces is a sure way to secure our plugins against CSRF attacks.  We can use the wp_nonce_field   function to automatically generate a nonce in forms.  You can then use check_ajax_referer   to check for nonce in the Ajax response script.  The function will automatically abort the execution of the script if there is a security threat.  Have a go Hero The plugin has a lot of potential for feature upgrades. Why don't you try adding a few?        Add an RSS feed to the wall comments. WordPress already has RSS feeds for all the  post comments; you only need to get the link  hint: use the get_post_comments_ feed_link function . Implement more options for the widget such as the number of comments to be  shown, and a checkbox to disable the addition of new comments. Use jQuery to add effects to the form such as fading in the comments.  [ 123 ]       Add a Refresh option so that the wall updates itself automatically after a specified  time period  you can use the  setInterval function . Provide a link to display all the comments by showing the comments page  user has  to publish it previously .  The Wall  Summary  In this chapter, we have learned an important lesson, which is that by utilizing built-in  WordPress functionalities whenever we can, we are able to save both time and effort. And  our shared plugin functionality will automatically follow the development of WordPress.  The Ajax Wall widget allows you to post quick comments. The comments will of course need  to pass all internal verifications of WordPress before they can appear on our page. And we  can easily manage comments from the WordPress administration interface.  We have covered important areas of WordPress development:          Widgets: Creating and managing widgets on our blog Options: Using WordPress to manage our plugin options easily Database: Working with WordPress database to insert and retrieve information Ajax forms: Submitting forms and get the results without reloading the page  In the next chapter, we are going to look over more WordPress features and development  techniques by developing a super cool Snazzy Archives plugin.  [ 124 ]   5  Snazzy Archives  This chapter covers the creation of a very sleek and stylish looking WordPress enhancement.  The purpose of the Snazzy Archives plugin will be to present your site archives in a unique   visual way.  In order to achieve this visual output, we will read all posts from the WordPress database  and display them using a combination of HTML, CSS, and jQuery.  We will incorporate our plugin into a PHP class to make it easier to use and maintain. We   will also learn a few template tricks and how to integrate the plugin output to WordPress  pages easily.   Snazzy Archives  Finally, we will create an options page so that users can control various aspects of the plugin.  In summary, this chapter will teach you how to:            Use a PHP class to describe your plugin Use shortcode API to display output on your pages, and use custom templates  when you want more control Manage options for your plugin Create options page and add administration menus Create simple caching mechanism to speed up the output of your plugins  And you will learn this by creating a stylish archive view for your WordPress site.  Using a class for plugin  Let's start with learning a new way to code your plugins. We will use a PHP class, and add  properties  variables  and methods  functions  to it.  Time for action – Create a new plugin class Let's start building our plugin by creating our first class:  Cr at  a n w fold r call d snazzy-archives. Create a new file, snazzy-archives.php: <?php    *    Plugin Name: Snazzy Archives    Version: 0.1    Plugin URI: http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir wordpress-plugins    1. 2.                             snazzy-archives                          of your post archives.

';  if  version_compare $wp_version, "2.6", "<"     {            exit $exit_msg ;  [ 126 ]                                                                   }  }  else :  Chapter 5  3.  Then add declaration for our class as follows:     Avoid name collisions. if   !class_exists 'SnazzyArchives'    :  class SnazzyArchives   {     this variable will hold url to the plugin             var $plugin_url;         Initialize the plugin     function SnazzyArchives         {              $this->plugin_url = trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.                 dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;                }         function to call after plugin activation     function install         {      exit  "Class SnazzyArchives already declared!" ; endif;  4.  Create an instance of our class:     create new instance of the class $SnazzyArchives = new SnazzyArchives  ;  5.  And finally register the function we want to run when the plugin is activated:         register the activation function by passing the reference    register_activation_hook  __FILE__, array &$SnazzyArchives,    if  isset $SnazzyArchives     {              to our instance                    'install'   ; } ?>  That's it! We have incorporated our plugin into an effective class in just a few steps.  [ 127 ]   Snazzy Archives  What just happened? Our plugin is now represented with a PHP class. The only name we need to worry about is  the class name. So we want to use a unique name; same as the plugin name is probably a  good idea.  Before the class is declared, we check its name using the PHP class_exists   function:     Avoid name collisions. if   !class_exists 'SnazzyArchives'    :  In case of a name collision, we display an error message:  else :     exit  "Class SnazzyArchives already declared!" ; endif;  We can now declare variables and functions freely inside the class, without having to use  long and unique prefixes to distinguish them.  First, we declare a variable that will hold our plugin URL:  class SnazzyArchives   {        this variable will hold url to the plugin     var $plugin_url;  The class constructor function has the same name as the class, and executes whenever a  new instance of the class is created.  We will use it to store initialization functions. For now, we will only fill the plugin URL into   a variable:  class SnazzyArchives   {        this variable will hold url to the plugin     var $plugin_url;        Initialize the plugin     function SnazzyArchives        {         $this->plugin_url=trailingslashit  get_bloginfo 'wpurl'             .PLUGINDIR.' '. dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;     }  [ 12 ]   Chapter 5  Finally, we declare an empty function which we will use later to set the default options for  the plugin.      function SnazzyArchives         {       $this->plugin_url=trailingslashit  get_bloginfo 'wpurl'           .PLUGINDIR.' '. dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;     }        function to call after plugin activation     function install         {      } }  Initializing the plugin is performed by creating a new instance of our class. This creates a  $SnazzyArchives object:     create new instance of the class $SnazzyArchives = new SnazzyArchives  ;  We also want to execute a function when our plugin is activated, so we will use the  register_activation_hook   API function. We need to specify the callback function  using a reference to our newly created object. This is because the install   function is a  member of our class.     create new instance of the class $SnazzyArchives = new SnazzyArchives  ;  if  isset $SnazzyArchives     {        register the activation function by passing the reference to       your instance     register_activation_hook  __FILE__, array &$SnazzyArchives,       'install'   ; }  We have the basics covered, and we can now move on to show our archives. First, we will  cover how to display output on WordPress pages.  Quick reference class_exists  : Useful PHP function to check if the class exists before  doing anything with it. For the functions we have the function_exists    PHP functions. register_activation_hook file, callback : Registers a plugin  function to be run when the plugin is activated.  [ 12 ]   Snazzy Archives  Showing template output with shortcodes  There are basically three ways to show output on a page in WordPress.   We have already covered the first one, using a content filter to insert the content into a page.  This is what we have used in Chapter 2 with Digg This plugin.  The second method involves using shortcodes. Shortcode API was first introduced in  WordPress 2.5. It basically behaves like the content filter internally, but allows you more  options with less effort. An example shortcode is [gallery], inserted into the post editor.  The third method involves calling our output function directly from the theme template.  Let's cover shortcodes first, as they provide an easy and powerful way to display   dynamic content.   Time for action – Use a shortcode  Add a display  function to our class:  1.     function display       {         return "Hello World!";     }  2.  Add the shortcode function handler:      function SnazzyArchives         {          $this->plugin_url = trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.          dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;             add shortcode handler         add_shortcode 'snazzy-archive', array &$this, 'display'  ;     }  [ 130 ]   3.  That's all! Using shortcodes is very easy.  Type in the shortcode [snazzy-archive] on any page:  Chapter 5  4.  WordPress will replace the shortcode with the output of our shortcode function   right away:  [ 131 ]   Snazzy Archives  What just happened? We used a shortcode to display an example output on a WordPress page. Shortcodes are  simple tags that you enter in the post editor. The shortcode API then automatically replaces  the shortcode with the output of the functions associated with the shortcode.  To register a shortcode, you need to use the add_shortcode   function:  add_shortcode 'snazzy-archive', array &$this, 'display'  ;  The first parameter is a shortcode identifier  this is what you will use in post within brackets   and the second one specifies the handler function. In our case, it is the display   function  in our class.  The handler function is always responsible for returning the content, which will replace the  shortcode in post.  Shortcode API We have just seen how shortcode API provides a powerful mechanism for displaying content  in posts and pages. Although it works internally, very much like the content filter, it provides  useful built-in functionalities that make it easier to use.  For example, a shortcode can accept parameters like this:  [gallery id="55" size="small" mode="1"]  The parameters are sent to the shortcode handling function as an associative array.  function display  $params   {        $params is array  'id' => '55', 'size' => 'small',       'mode'=>'1'  }  Although you could parse the parameters manually, shortcode API also provides a function  to do this, including setting default values. The function is shortcode_atts  $defaults_ array, $params  .  It parses the incoming parameters and assigns default values to any missing parameter. It will  also filter out all unwanted parameters.   Let 's see an example:  function display  $params   {     $values = shortcode_atts  array         [ 132 ]   Chapter 5         'id' => '1',        'size' => 'medium',        'effect'=> '1'      , $params  ; }  If we use the [gallery id="55" size="small" mode="1"] shortcode, the  $values variable would contain array   'id' => '55', 'size' => 'small',  'effect'=>'1'  after parsing and the mode parameter will be disregarded, as it is not  provided in the default array.   Enclosing shortcodes Shortcodes can also enclose content, and are written in the following format:  [gallery] content [ gallery]  The function content is treated as a part of shortcode, and will be replaced, along with the  entire shortcode, with the output of the handling function. The enclosed content is passed  as a second argument:  function display  $params, $content = null   {     if  !is_null $content           return $content ;     else         return 'Hello World !'; }  You can of course mix the shortcode parameters with the enclosed content:  [gallery id="55" ] content [ gallery]  Quick reference add_shortcode  string, handler  : Assigns a handler function for  the shortcode identified by a string shortcode_atts  defaults_array, params  : Parses the  shortcode parameters using a default array More up to date information on the Shortcode API is available at:   http:  codex.wordpress.org Shortcode_API.  [ 133 ]   Snazzy Archives  Custom templates The main advantage of shortcodes is their ease of implementation and use.  But sometimes, in order to achieve a desired output, we need more control over the output  page. In the case of shortcodes and content filters, we are bound by the theme template.  We can overcome this limitation by creating a custom template page.   Time for action – Create a custom template  Cr at  a snazzy-template.php file. <?php  * Template Name: Snazzy Archives *   1.                ?>                     <?php if  isset $SnazzyArchives   echo                      $SnazzyArchives->display  ; ?>                     2.  Upload this file to your current theme folder.  3.  When you create a page, you are now enable to select our template for the page:  [ 134 ]   4.  The page will now show how to use our template  without sidebar, page title :  Chapter 5  What just happened? We have just created a custom template for our theme. It allows us full control of the   output page.  In order to declare a new template, you need to specify only the template name, and it will  appear in the menu.  <?php  * Template Name: Snazzy Archives *  ?>  The rest of the template is normal HTML code. Normally, you would include the header and  the footer of the theme, and WordPress provides the get_header   and get_footer    functions to display them.  Usually, using shortcodes will get the job done, but it is always useful to know other  possibilities when we need broader control of the layout.  Quick function reference get_header  , get_footer  , get_sidebar  : These are WordPress  include tags and can be used within a template file to include other portions of  the theme template such as header and footer. You can also include any file from the current theme folder using:   More information on template include files: http:  codex.wordpress. org Include_Tags  [ 135 ]   Snazzy Archives  Prepare archives  Now that we have the page set up, we can begin with modifying our display   function to  show all the posts.  The function will get the posts from the database, sorted by date  newest to oldest , and  then print them using a predefined layout.  We want to name all our archive elements appropriately in the layout, so we can use CSS and  jQuery later.  Every column will represent one whole month of post archives. Each month will have  different days when postings occurred, and each day may have several posts for that day.  Each post will have a title, image  if available  and excerpt text.  Below is a diagram of the archive structure with CSS div elements used.  HTML Table  sz_date_yr  sz_cont  sz_date_mon  sz_month  sz_date_day  sz_day  sz_cont  sz_title  sz_image  sz_excerpt  [ 136 ]   The structure we have in mind looks something like this:  Chapter 5  Time for action – Show archives of posts Let's modify our display   function to retrieve all the posts from the database.  Modify the existing display   function to print the general elements of the page:  1.     function display       {         global $wpdb;             these variables store the current year, month and date           processed         $curyear='';         $curmonth='';         $curday='';  [ 137 ]   Snazzy Archives         the beginning of our output         $result='                                                            '  2.  Next, extract all the posts from the database using the $wpdb variable we covered in   the previous chapter:         query to get all published posts     $query="SELECT * FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_status =       'publish' AND post_password='' ORDER BY post_date_gmt DESC ";     $posts = $wpdb->get_results $query ;  3.  Then for each post we will retrieve title, excerpt, URL, and date:      foreach  $posts as $post       {            retrieve post information we need         $title = $post->post_title;         $excerpt= $this->get_excerpt $post-          >post_content ;         $url=get_permalink $post->ID ;         $date = strtotime $post->post_date ;             format the date         $day = date 'd', $date ;         $month = date 'M', $date ;         $year = date 'Y', $date ;  4.  We will use a regular expression to search for an image in the post and store the URL   in the $imageurl variable:             look for image in the post content         $imageurl="";         preg_match '  ]*src\s*=\s*[\""\']? [^\""\'>]*            i' , $post->post_content, $matches ;         $imageurl=$matches[1];  5.  We are also interested in getting the number of comments for the particular post:             get comments for this post         $comcount = $wpdb->get_var "             SELECT COUNT *              FROM $wpdb->comments              WHERE comment_approved = '1'   [ 13 ]   Chapter 5              AND comment_post_ID=$post->ID               AND NOT  comment_type = 'pingback'               OR comment_type = 'trackback'              " ;         " ;  6.  Next comes the HTML formatting to create all our HTML elements:             additional formatiing         if  $year!=$curyear          {                close the previous day month             if  $curday              $result.="   ";              $curday='';             $curmonth='';                 year start in a new column                 $result.= '  '              .$year.'  ';              $result.= '  ';             $curyear=$year;         }          if  $month!=$curmonth          {                close the previous day month             if  $curday                $result.="   ";                $curday='';                                                                            month starts in a new column                 $result.= '  '              .$month.'  ';              $curmonth=$month;         }          if  $day!=$curday          {                close previous day             if  $curday                $result.=" ";              $result.= ' '.$day.'                ';             $curday=$day;         }  [ 13 ]   Snazzy Archives  7.  To print out the details of the post, we will use an external template:            retrieve the archive entry representation         ob_start  ;         include 'snazzy-layout-1.php' ;         $output = ob_get_contents  ;         ob_end_clean  ;          $result.=$output;     }  8.  And finally, we close the page elements and return the result:            close the previous day month         if  $curday          $result.="   ";             close the main page elements         $result.="    ";             return the result         return $result;     }  9.  We referenced a function to get the post excerpt, so we need to write it too:     function get_excerpt $text, $length = 15      {         if  !$length              return $text;          $text = strip_tags $text ;                 $words = explode ' ', $text, $length + 1 ;         if  count $words  > $length            {             array_pop $words ;             array_push $words, '...' ;             $text = implode ' ', $words ;         }         return $text;     }  10. And finally, let's create a layout file, snazzy-layout-1.php. Our template will  output necessary classes  for example page or post , include the image if it exists,  and output the content:  post_type=='page'     ? "sz_page" : "sz_post"   ?>" <?php echo $imageurl ?   'style="background: transparent url '.$imageurl.'  no-repeat          [ 140 ]   Chapter 5                     center;"' : '' ?>  >      " title="<?php echo  $comcount ?       "$comcount comments" : ""  ?>" class="<?php echo $imageurl ?       "sz_titleon" : "sz_title" ?>">                          &8220;<?php echo $excerpt               ?>&8221;               11. The end result of this somewhat lengthy code is the archives page that starts to look   like our desired output.  What just happened? The display   function is now capable of extracting and showing all posts using our layout.  The whole archive view is encapsulated into a div and a table:     the beginning of our output $result='                              ';     MAIN ARCHIVE CONTENT       close the main page elements     $result.="    ";  [ 141 ]   Snazzy Archives  Get all posts from database We can get a list of all previous posts with a WordPress database query. We want published  posts, without a password, and sorted by date:     query to get all published posts     $query="SELECT * FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_status =       'publish' AND post_password='' ORDER BY post_date_gmt DESC ";     $posts = $wpdb->get_results $query ;  We then retrieve the relevant post information. Notice that whenever we call a function in  our class, we use $this reference, for example, $this->get_excerpt  :     retrieve post information we need     $title = $post->post_title;     $excerpt= $this->get_excerpt $post->post_content ;     $url=get_permalink $post->ID ;     $date = strtotime $post->post_date ;  Using a regular expression In order to find an image in the post content, we use a regular expression,  regexp .  Regular expressions are very powerful tools for searching patterns in content,  although you do not need to know everything about them. The snippets of code  like the ones we used are available throughout the Internet, and you just need to  search for them  for example, you can find regexp for searching links on a page  or checking if the email address is valid .  This regexp basically searches for the   tag in the content and returns the URL of  the image, which we will use to display the picture:     look for image in the post content   $imageurl="";   preg_match '  ]*src\s*=\s*[\""\']? [^\""\'>]*  i',    $post->post_content, $matches ;   $imageurl=$matches[1];  Retrieve comment count for a post Here we have a snippet of code to get the comment count for a certain post. We are making  sure that the comments are approved, and we do not want to count trackbacks or pingbacks.     get comments for this post   $comcount = $wpdb->get_var "     SELECT COUNT *   [ 142 ]   Chapter 5      FROM $wpdb->comments      WHERE comment_approved = '1'       AND comment_post_ID=$post->ID       AND NOT  comment_type = 'pingback'       OR comment_type = 'trackback'    " ;  $wpdb->get_var is useful when we are retrieving only one variable from the database, in  this case, COUNT   of the comments.  Using output buffers The external file, snazzy-layout-1.php, contains the HTML representation of our   archive entry.   In this case, we need to catch the output of the file and add it to our $result variable,  because we are returning it at the end of the function.  That is why we use the output buffering PHP ob_ functions:     retrieve the archive entry representation               ob_start  ;   include 'snazzy-layout-1.php' ;   $output = ob_get_contents  ;   ob_end_clean  ;  The ob_start   function will turn on output buffering, and while it is active, no content from  the script  will be sent to the output. Instead, it is stored in the internal buffer. The contents of  this internal buffer may be retrieved by calling the ob_get_contents  function, and when  we don't need it anymore, we can call the ob_end_clean   function to discard the buffer.  Apply styling and jQuery to archives  When we have all the data we need structured in HTML elements, it is quite easy to create  the desired look with CSS. Here is an example:  Time for action – Style the archive view Let's create a styling sheet for our archive.  1.        Cr at  a snazzy-archives.css file. .snazzy   {   text-align:left;  [ 143 ]   Snazzy Archives    overflow:auto; }  .snazzy_img   {   margin:0;   padding:0; }                                                                                                 .sz_cont   {   width:100px;   display:block;   overflow:hidden;   margin:0px 0px 10px; }  .sz_page   {   bacground-color: ffffef; }  .sz_img   {   height:110px; }  .sz_year   {   font-size:22px;   color:444;   font-family:georgia, verdana;   font-style:italic; }  .sz_date_yr   {   height:42px;   font-size:34px; }  .sz_date_mon   {   height:29px;   font-size:22px;   cursor:pointer; }  .sz_date_day   {   background: efefea;  [ 144 ]   Chapter 5                                                        margin-bottom:1px;   height:20px;   font-size:14px;   font-weight:bold;   cursor:pointer; }  .sz_title  {   padding:5px 0px;   font-weight:bold;   color:444; }  .sz_titleon   {   line-height:14px;   color:eee;   background-color:333; }  .sz_excerpt   {   font-size:9px;   padding-bottom:5px;   color:999; }  our style sheet:         Initialize the plugin     function SnazzyArchives         {  2.  Add an action for the wp_print_scripts event inside the class constructor to load           $this->plugin_url=trailingslashit  get_bloginfo 'wpurl'             .PLUGINDIR.' '. dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;                 add shortcode handler         add_shortcode 'snazzy', array &$this, 'display'  ;                     print scripts action         add_action 'wp_print_scripts',  array &$this,          'scripts_action'  ;     }  [ 145 ]   Snazzy Archives  3.  The action will print out the reference to our style sheet:  function scripts_action    {     echo ' plugin_url =                 trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.          dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;     }  4.  Once everything is prepared, we are ready to upload the files and take a look at a   new archive page, freshly styled with CSS:  [ 146 ]   What just happened? We used CSS to style our archive elements, such as the year, month and day headers, and  the entire post layout.  We control the width of the entire column with only the width property of the post  conta n r, sz_cont, so it is easy to change.  Chapter 5  .sz_cont   {   width:100px;   display:block;   overflow:hidden;   margin:0px 0px 10px; }  Styling leaves endless possibilities for the user to play with. Let's also add interactivity   using jQuery.  Time for action – Use jQuery to allow user interaction As always, jQuery allows us to add powerful effects to our plugin with ease.   In this case, we want the ability to fold up months and days when we click on the date  header. This way, we can hide the information we do not wish to read, for example,   entire months.  Create the snazzy-archives.js file. jQuery document .ready function $    {   $ '.sz_date_mon' .click function      {       $ this .next '.sz_month' .children '.sz_day' .toggle  ;   } ;        $ '.sz_date_day' .click function      {       $ this .next '.sz_day' .slideToggle  ;   } ; } ;  2.  Add our script to the scripts_action   function  function scripts_action   {     wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;     wp_enqueue_script 'snazzy', $this->plugin_url.'   [ 147 ]  1.                                      Snazzy Archives                snazzy-archives.js', array 'jquery'  ;      echo ' plugin_url.      ' snazzy-archives.css" type="text css"  >'; }  3.  And that's all. We can now fold up the segments of the archive by simply clicking on   months and days, and our jQuery code takes care of the rest:  What just happened? We used the power of jQuery to add interactivity to our archive page, using only a few lines  of code.   The first snippet uses jQuery next and children selectors to toggle all the days  children of  month div  inone of the following months, when the user clicks the month header:    $ '.sz_date_mon' .click function      {       $ this .next '.sz_month' .children '.sz_day' .toggle  ;   } ;  The next snippet slides the day up and down when a certain day is clicked, using the jQuery  slideToggle effect:    $ '.sz_date_day' .click function      {       $ this .next '.sz_day' .slideToggle  ;   } ;  [ 14 ]   These simple additions greatly increase the usability of the plugin with little effort from our  side. But the requirement was structuring the plugin output properly and planning ahead.  Chapter 5  Have a go Hero When you have all the page elements you can now try to:      Style the entire archive view to have fixed width and height  you could add width  and height to snazzy div . Create a different layout file for displaying the post information in different ways.   For example, you could make all the days the same height and write text above   the pictures:    Change the template to include buttons that would toggle the display all posts or  pages when clicked  hint: using $ '.sz_post' .toggle   will do .  Creating plugin options page  It  s always useful if the plugin allows you to customize it to your liking. Using external CSS  and layout files makes it easier, but what about variables and functions we use in the code?  That is where the plugin options page comes to play. It can be loaded with settings that we  can change, and is easily accessible from the WordPress administration panel.   [ 14 ]   Snazzy Archives  Let's create a few options for our plugin:        Allow the user to choose whether they want to display posts, pages, or both Start the archive view in mini mode  Allow the user to provide descriptions for each year  The options page may look like this:  [ 150 ]   In order to have an options page, we need to cover several key functionalities:  Chapter 5          Manage our options Set up the options page Show the options Save them after user input  It is actually easier than it may appear to be, and there is no excuse not to have an options  page in our plugins anymore!   Time for action – Create an options page  1.                First, we will declare the names for our options in the WordPress database: class SnazzyArchives   {        this variable will hold url to the plugin         var $plugin_url;             name for our options in the DB     var $db_option = 'SnazzyArchives_Options';  2.  We want to have a function for retrieving the plugin options. This function will also   be able to set default values:         handle plugin options     function get_options         {             default values         $options = array                      'years' => '2008So far so good!',                       'mini' => '',           'posts' => 'on',           'pages' => ''          ;             get saved options         $saved = get_option $this->db_option ;             assign them         if  !empty $saved             {           foreach  $saved as $key => $option            $options[$key] = $option;         }  [ 151 ]   Snazzy Archives             update the options if necessary         if  $saved != $options            update_option $this->db_option, $options ;            return the options         return $options;     }  function that we created earlier:         Set up everything     function install         {             set default options         $this->get_options  ;     }  3.  We will set the default options when the plugin is activated. Use the install     4.  Next, let's create a function for handling our options page.

In order for our options page to show in the menu, we need to tell WordPress    which function it should call when the menu is displayed. We will do that using the  add_options_page function in the admin_menu filter:     Initialize the plugin function SnazzyArchives     {      $this->plugin_url = trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.             dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;         content filter     add_filter 'the_content',  array &$this, 'content_filter'  ;                 add shortcode handler     add_shortcode 'snazzy-archive', array &$this, 'display'  ;         add options Page     add_action 'admin_menu',  array &$this, 'admin_menu'  ;  }     hook the options page function admin_menu    {      add_options_page 'Snazzy Archives Options', 'Snazzy Archives',                   8, basename __FILE__ , array &$this, 'handle_options'  ;    }                                                    [ 154 ]   This makes our options page operational, and can now be seen in the administration menu:  Chapter 5  What just happened? We have used WordPress API functions to create and install our options page in the  administration panel.  In order to do that, we hooked into the admin_menu event and supplied our function:  add_action 'admin_menu',  array &$this, 'admin_menu'  ;  This function registers our options page using the add_options_page   WordPress API  call. This will create a menu item in the Administration panel using the name and file we pass  to it.     hook the options page function admin_menu     {     add_options_page 'Snazzy Archives Options', 'Snazzy Archives', 8,       basename __FILE__ , array &$this, 'handle_options'  ; }  Managing plugin options To manage plugin options, we are using a dedicated function, get_options  . Its purpose  is to store default options, provide easy upgradeability  with new options in the future  versions of the plugin  and return the current options.  It contains the default set of options we want to use:  function get_options     {         default values     $options = array                'years' => '2008So far so good!',  [ 155 ]   Snazzy Archives          'mini' => '',         'posts' => 'on',         'pages' => ''      ;  We then retrieve the saved options from the database and merge them with the default  options. If there are no saved options, the default options will be copied over, and will  become active.     get saved options $saved = get_option $this->db_option ;        assign them     if  !empty $saved         {         foreach  $saved as $key => $option          $options[$key] = $option;     }  F nally, we save the merged options and return them:         update the options if necessary     if  $saved != $options      {          update_option $this->db_option, $options ;            return the options         return $options;     }  To install the default options, we make sure that the get_options   is called when the  plugin is activated, and that is what our install   function was created for:         Set up everything     function install         {             set default options         $this->get_options  ;     }  Handling options form When you visit the options page, our external template is loaded and shown:      function handle_options       {         include 'snazzy-archives-options.php' ;     }  [ 156 ]   To fill the values in the template, we retrieve the options from the database and assign them  to the local variables that are used in the template.  Chapter 5  To handle submits, we need to provide a path to the script. We can use the   PHP $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] variable:  function handle_options   {   $options = $this->get_options  ;    $layout=$options['layout'];   $years=stripslashes $options['years'] ;   $mini=$options['mini']=='on'?'checked':'';   $posts=$options['posts']=='on'?'checked':'';   $pages=$options['pages']=='on'?'checked':'';    include 'snazzy-archives-options.php' ; }  $posts=$options['posts']=='on'?'checked':''; $pages=$options['pages']=='on'?'checked':'';     URL for form submit, equals our current page   $action_url = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];        include 'snazzy-archives-options.php' ; }    function handle_options     {       $options = $this->get_options  ;          if   isset $_POST['submitted']              {             check security           check_admin_referer 'snazzy-nonce' ;            $options = array  ;  When the user submits the form, we check the nonce and then save all the fields:            $options['years']=htmlspecialchars $_POST['years'] ;           $options['mini']= $_POST['mini'];           $options['posts']= $_POST['posts'];           $options['pages']= $_POST['pages'];            update_option $this->db_option, $options ;            echo '  Plugin settings             saved.  ';         }          $layout=$options['layout'];  [ 157 ]   Snazzy Archives  The way our page works is by directly connecting variables on the form with variables in   the options.  For example, the $posts variable keeps the value of the option to show posts. The POST  method would pass the value on for the checkbox if it was selected, and that is what we  have saved in the database:  $options['posts']= $_POST['posts'];  When the template is shown, we assign the value checked to it if it had been   selected previously:  $posts=$options['posts']=='on'?'checked':'';  In the template, we then print the value of the variable. If it had been checked earlier, the  checkbox will be selected:     ><label   for="posts"> Show Posts     Adding administration pages WordPress administration menus are structured in a hierarchy of main menu pages and  menu subpages.  Some examples of main menu pages are Manage, Settings, Plugins, Write, and Users.  Submenu pages appear below these pages, for example, our plugin options page in the  Plugins menu.  The function for adding main menu pages is:  add_menu_page page_title, menu_title, access_level capability,   file, [function]             page_title: Text that will go into the HTML of the page, as the title for the page  when the menu is active menu_title: The on-screen name text for the menu access_level capability: The minimum user level or the capability required  to display and use this menu page file: The PHP file that handles the display of the menu page content function: The function that displays the page content for the menu page  If we want to add submenus, the format is similar:  add_submenu_page parent, page_title, menu_title,   access_level capability, file, [function] ;  [ 15 ]   The only difference is in the parent parameter. It is the filename of the core WordPress  admin file that supplies the top-level menu in which you want to insert your submenu    if this submenu is going into a custom top-level menu for example, index.php, post. php, edit.php, themes.php, plugins.php, and so on  or your plugin file.  For the most used main menus, WordPress provides functions for easier management   of submenus:  Chapter 5    add_management_page: For adding submenus in the Manage menu         Add a new submenu under Manage:     add_management_page 'Test Manage', 'Test Manage', 8,       'testmanage', 'manage_page' ;    add_options_page: For adding submenus in the Settings menu          Add a new submenu under Options:     add_options_page 'Test Options', 'Test Options', 8,       'testoptions', 'options_page' ;      add_theme_page: For adding submenus in the Design menu add_users_page: For adding submenus in the Users menu  A few more examples are:     Add a new top-level menu   add_menu_page 'Test Toplevel', 'Test Toplevel', 8, __FILE__,   'toplevel_page' ;    Add a submenu to the custom top-level menu: add_submenu_page __FILE__, 'Test Sublevel', 'Test Sublevel', 8,   'sub-page', 'sublevel_page' ;  Quick reference add_options_page page_title, menu_title, access_level  capability, file : Adds a page in the Settings menu of the WordPress  admin panel.

Use plugin options  Now, we have created and stored the following options for our plugin:        Select whether to show posts and or pages Start the archive in collapsed mode Set the year descriptions  [ 15 ]   Snazzy Archives  We should now modify the plugin to make a good use of them.  Time for action – Apply the plugin options To select whether we want to show post or pages, we will modify the display   function.  Let's start by selecting whether to show posts and pages:  1.        the beginning of our output     $result='                                                                        ';              $options=$this->get_options  ;                parse post options             $types=array  ;             if  $options['posts']                  array_push $types, "'post'" ;             if  $options['pages']                  array_push $types, "'page'" ;              $types=implode ',', $types ;                 query to get all published posts             $query="SELECT * FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_status =               'publish' AND post_password='' AND post_type IN  $types                ORDER BY post_date_gmt DESC ";              $posts = $wpdb->get_results $query ;  2.  To get the year's description we need to parse what the user entered in the    text area:              $options=$this->get_options  ;                parse year descriptions             if  !empty $options['years']               {               $yrs = array  ;               foreach  explode "\n", $options['years']  as $line                  {                 list $year, $desc  = array_map 'trim', explode "",                   $line, 2  ;                 if  !empty $year   $yrs[$year] = stripslashes $desc ;               }             }                parse post options             $types=array  ;  [ 160 ]   Chapter 5  3.  And then we display the year text below the year date in the table:              $result.= ' <div class=              "sz_date_yr">'.$year.'  ';              if  $yrs[$year]                $result.=' &8220;'.                $yrs[$year].'&8221; ';                $result.= '  ';  4.  Finally, when we want to start the view in mini mode, we need to pass this   parameter to our jQuery script, which will handle this functionality.      function scripts_action       {         $options = $this->get_options  ;          $mini=$options['mini'] ? 1 : 0;          wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;         wp_enqueue_script 'snazzy', $this->plugin_url . '           snazzy-archives.js', array 'jquery'  ;             JavaScript options         wp_localize_script 'snazzy', 'SnazzySettings',           array 'snazzy_mini' => $mini  ;  5.  Edit the snazzy-archives.js file and add the code to hide all the days if the   snazzy_mini variable is set:                       jQuery document .ready function $    {   snazzy_mini=parseInt SnazzySettings.snazzy_mini ;    if  snazzy_mini    $ '.sz_day' .hide  ;    $ '.sz_date_mon' .click function      {     $ this .next '.sz_month' .children '.sz_day' .toggle  ;   } ;  [ 161 ]   Snazzy Archives  We are done! Let's try it now. Turn all the options on, as shown:  This will result in a collapsed archive view, showing both posts and pages and the year  description we filled in:  What just happened? We have included the functionality for the options we stored earlier.  We modify our query for posts based on whether we selected to show posts, pages or both,  by using array manipulation routines:  $types=array  ; if  $options['posts']    array_push $types, "'post'" ;  [ 162 ]   if  $options['pages']    array_push $types, "'page'" ;  $types=implode ',', $types ;  We also display the description for each year, by parsing the input string. The following   code splits the input string  explode "\n", $options['years']  and then applies   the trim   to the year and the description using array_map  .  Chapter 5  if  !empty $options['years']   {   $yrs = array  ;   foreach  explode "\n", $options['years']  as $line     {     list $year, $desc  = array_map 'trim', explode "",       $line, 2  ;     if  !empty $year   $yrs[$year] = stripslashes $desc ;   } }  The end result is an array $yrs, where keys are years and values are descriptions for that  year. We can then use it to show the description for the years:  if  $yrs[$year]    $result.=' &8220;'.    $yrs[$year].'&8221; ';  Caching the plugin output  Let's learn how we can implement simple caching for our plugins. Caching is done in order to  lessen the strain on the server and provide faster loading time for the user. This is especially  true for blogs with large archives.  Time for action – Create archives cache  Add the variable to store the cache file path. We will use WordPress wp-content  folder:    name for our options in the DB   var $db_option = 'SnazzyArchives_Options';  1.                      path to store the cache file   var $cache_path;     Initialize the plugin   function SnazzyArchives     {  [ 163 ]   Snazzy Archives      $this->plugin_url = trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.            dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;        $this->cache_path = ABSPATH .'wp-content ';  2.  Next, we want to check if the cached content is present at the beginning of our  display   function. If it is present, we will simply show that file to the user,  skipping the dynamic creation of archives:      function display       {         global $wpdb;             try to retrieve cache         $data = @file_get_contents $this-          >cache_path."snazzy_cache.htm" ;             return the cache data if it exists         if  $data            return $data;             these variables store the current year, month and           date processed                     $curyear = '';  3.  If the cache is not present, we will generate the archives as normal. Only this time,   we want to save the cache file once it it's created.             close the main page elements         $result .= "    ";             write cache         if  is_writeable $this->cache_path            @file_put_contents $this->cache_path."snazzy_cache.htm",           $result ;             return the result         return $result;  4.  That will serve as the basic cache functionality. In order to delete the cache every   time a change has been made  post has been added or edited , we will add the  following code to our class constructor to initialize the delete_cache function:             add options Page         add_action 'admin_menu', array &$this, 'admin_menu'  ;            delete output cache         add_action  'edit_post',  array &$this,'delete_cache'  ;         add_action  'save_post',  array &$this,'delete_cache'  ;     }  [ 164 ]   Chapter 5  5.  Finally, we need to code the function. It will simply delete the file from the server:      function delete_cache       {         @unlink $this->cache_path."snazzy_cache.htm" ;     }  What just happened? We created a simple caching mechanism that is able to retrieve the cached file from the  server, create it if it does not exist, and remove the cache after a post has been changed   or added.  The cached file is retrieved from the disk using the file_get_contents command  @ sign  before the function name will suppress all the warning messages, for example, a message  that the file does not exist :  $data = @file_get_contents $this->cache_path."snazzy_cache.htm" ;  The file is written in the same way as if the content has been dynamically generated. Here,  we introduce another WordPress function is_writeable, which can check if the given path  is writeable by the server:  if  is_writeable $this->cache_path     @file_put_contents $this->cache_path."snazzy_cache.htm", $result ;  We also used two new actions edit_post and save_post, which are executed when the  post is edited or saved:     delete output cache   add_action  'edit_post',  array &$this,'delete_cache'  ;   add_action  'save_post',  array &$this,'delete_cache'  ;  Have a go Hero Once you have the options panel installed, you may add more enhancements to the plugin.   You can try a few:          Option to turn caching ON OFF Option to select different layouts  which you will create!   for presenting the archive Allow the user to select the time period for showing archives Exclude the specific posts from the archives by their IDs  [ 165 ]   Snazzy Archives  Summary  With the Snazzy archives plugin, we created a unique way for users to show their archives.  The plugin output can be customized using CSS, layout files, and the options page.  We have learned how to manipulate the layout of the template using shortcodes and custom  templates. This allows us to show the output the way we want it.  It is a great usability bonus for the plugin when it has an options page. And another  important lesson we learned was how to manage options, and how to create option   pages easily.  Let's sum up what we learned in this chapter:              Classes: We can learned how to use classes, properties and methods to write  to wr t    our plugins. Shortcodes: The shortcode API provides a powerful mechanism for shortcode API provides a powerful mechanism for   changing content. Custom templates: These allow us to fully control the layout of the page. Manage Options: We learned how to manage our plugin options, including setting   default values. Administrative menus: We added an administration page, and learned how to insert  our pages into WordPress menus. File caching: This provides a method to cache the plugin output.  We will continue to create exciting plugins in the next chapter as well. Our next one will  automatically find relevant Flickr images and YouTube videos for your post, and allow you to  insert them into a post with a single click!  [ 166 ]   6  Insights for WordPress  The previous chapters explored WordPress features visible on the site including modifying  and sending output to the pages and the sidebar. In this chapter, we are going to deal more  with the modification of the administration panel.  How many times, while writing a post, have you needed to refer one of your previous  articles? It is a time consuming job—searching the article on your blog to get a link. The  plugin we are about to create will make finding your old posts take only a couple of seconds.  Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. So we will also learn how to find  and insert relevant Flickr photos into your articles as well.  This chapter is all about digging a little deeper into the WordPress and hacking the Write  Post screen.  You will learn to create custom panels in the various sections of the Write Post screen. Also,  you will learn how to access the current WordPress rich editor, tinyMCE, and create a button  on its toolbar. You will also learn how to interact with Flickr API that allows you access to the  world's largest images repository.  Let's sum up what awaits us:            Creating custom panels in the Write Post screen  Searching your posts based on keywords Accessing Flickr and search for relevant photos Inserting content into the WordPress editor directly Adding a tinyMCE plugin and a button    Insights for WordPress  And you will do all of these by creating the images quickly from within the WordPress edit page.   creating the Insights plugin to access your articles and Flickr   We have a lot to do, so let's get going!  [ 16 ]   Chapter 6  Creating custom panels in the editor screen  The first part of our plugin will cover integration of images into the WordPress Write   Post screen.  We want to add a custom panel, which we will use later to display the search results.  Time for action – Create a new plugin outline Let's start building our plugin by creating a PHP class, and then adding functionality to create  a custom panel.

Let's add the custom panel to the Write Post screen. First, we need to hook into the   admin menu:      function WPInsights         {         $this->plugin_url = trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.          dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;            admin_menu hook         add_action 'admin_menu',  array &$this, 'admin_menu'  ;     }  4.  Now, add our custom panels using the WordPress add_meta_box function and   specifying our function responsible for drawing the panel:               Hook the admin menu     function admin_menu         {            custom panel for edit post         add_meta_box  'WPInsights', 'Insights', array           &$this,'draw_panel' , 'post', 'normal', 'high'  ;            custom panel for edit page         add_meta_box  'WPInsights', 'Insights', array           &$this,'draw_panel' , 'page', 'normal', 'high'  ;     }  [ 170 ]   Chapter 6  5.  For now, our draw_panel will just write a simple text:         draw the panel     function draw_panel         {          echo 'Hello World!';      }  That's all! You can see our new panel in the Write Post  and Page  screens. It's in the box just  below the editor window.  The panel automatically has all the styles of the other core WordPress panels. Also, it inherits  JavaScript, so you can open and close it just like all the other panels. And like most good  things we did it in just a few lines of code!  What just happened? Just as in the previous chapter, we are using a class to outline our plugin with default  properties such as a name for the plugin option and a variable to hold the plugin URL.  class WPInsights   {    name for our options in the DB     var $DB_option = 'WPInsights_options';        the plugin URL     var $plugin_url; }  To access and add content to WordPress panels, we use the available API function   add_meta_box    :  function admin_menu     {      custom panel for edit post   add_meta_box  'WPInsights', 'Insights', array     &$this,'draw_panel' , 'post', 'normal', 'high'  ;      custom panel for edit page   add_meta_box  'WPInsights', 'Insights', array     &$this,'draw_panel' , 'page', 'normal', 'high'  ; }  [ 171 ]   Insights for WordPress  The function takes the identifier and the title of the panel. Also, you can specify a callback  function to draw the panel—in our case, we named it draw_panel  .  function draw_panel     {   echo 'Hello World!'; }  For now, we just output a simple text, but we will soon add more functionality to it. now, we just output a simple text, but we will soon add more functionality to it.  we just output a simple text, but we will soon add more functionality to it.  Custom edit panels in WordPress Typically, WordPress allows us to insert a panel in one of the three sections of the editor  screens outlined below:  [ 172 ]   Chapter 6  The first one is called Normal, and is just below the post editor. It contains the most  frequently used panels such as post Categories and Tags.  The second section is called Advanced, and is located below the normal section with core  panels such as Excerpts and Custom Fields.  The third section is the Sidebar, where we can add panels below the WordPress   sidebar content.  Using jQuery, we can insert panels almost anywhere. But currently only those three sections  jQuery, we can insert panels almost anywhere. But currently only those three sections jQuery, we can insert panels almost anywhere. But currently only those three sections  are covered with the API. The WordPress API also allows us to choose the order in which the  panels are shown, by assigning them priority.  Let's take a close look at the add_meta_box   function:  add_meta_box id, title, callback, page, section, priority   id: It allows us to refer to the panel in the document later. title: It is the title of the box.  callback: It is a function that fills the box with the desired content. The function  should echo its output. page: It is the type of edit page on which to show the box  post, page, link  section: It is the section within the page where the boxes should show    for example 'normal' or 'advanced'  priority: It is the priority within the section where the boxes should be shown   'high', 'core', 'default', 'low'   For example, let's create our panel in the advanced section of the post screen, using   default priority:  add_meta_box  'WPInsights', 'Insights', array &$this,'draw_panel' ,   'post', 'advanced', 'default'  ;  The add_meta_box   function does not support adding panels to the sidebar yet, but you  can use the submitpost_box action instead:  add_action 'submitpost_box', array  &$this, 'my_sidebar'    ; function my_sidebar     {    echo '  Hello World!  ';              }  [ 173 ]   Insights for WordPress  In the upcoming versions of WordPress, we are likely to see a unified function for all the  sections, so keep an eye on WordPress Codex.

Time for action – Display a list of matching posts  Modify our draw_panel   function to show an input field:  1.        draw the panel     function draw_panel         {  [ 174 ]   Chapter 6          echo '           Enter keywords you would like to search for and press the           Search button.           <input type="text" id="insights-search" name="insights-          search" size="25" autocomplete="off"  >         <input id="insights-submit" class="button" type="button"           value="Search"   >';      }  This gives us an input box and a Search button to work with.  2.  We will also add a div to display the search results in:          <input id="insights-submit" class="button" type="button"           value="Search"   >';          echo '  ';  3.  Let's add input handling functionality and Ajax. Create a file, insights.js.     First, let's add a function to submit the query using Ajax.      }                                       Insights for WordPress plugin     setup everything when document is ready jQuery document .ready function $   {         initialize the variables     var last_query=undefined;         function to submit rhe query and get results     function submit_me         {             check if the search string is empty         if  $ 'insights-search' .val  .length==0            {             $ 'insights-results' .html '' ;  [ 175 ]                                                        Insights for WordPress                           return;         }             create the query          var query = InsightsSettings.insights_url + ' insights-          ajax.php?search=' + escape $ 'insights-search' .val   +           '&mode=' + mode + '&_ajax_nonce=' +                                  InsightsSettings.nonce;;                                check if already called         if  query!=last_query          {             $ 'insights-results' .html 'Please wait...' ;             $ 'insights-results' .load query ;             last_query=query;         }     } } ;  4.  Now, let's add responses to the ENTER key and Search button click:         search button click event     $ 'insights-submit' .click function         {         submit_me  ;     } ;         check for ENTER or ArrowDown keys     $ 'insights-search' .keypress function e        {         if  e.keyCode == 13  e.keyCode == 40            {             submit_me  ;             return false;         }      } ;  } ;  5.  We need to declare our script as always. This time, we are using a functionality that  enables us to decide on which admin pages we want the script to be shown on. Edit  the constructor of our class:      function WPInsights         {          $this->plugin_url = trailingslashit  WP_PLUGIN_URL.' '.           dirname  plugin_basename __FILE__   ;             admin_menu hook  [ 176 ]   Chapter 6          add_action 'admin_menu',  array &$this, 'admin_menu'  ;             print scripts action         add_action 'admin_print_scripts-post.php',  array &$this,           'scripts_action'  ;         add_action 'admin_print_scripts-page.php',  array &$this,           'scripts_action'  ;         add_action 'admin_print_scripts-post-new.php',  array &$this,           'scripts_action'  ;         add_action 'admin_print_scripts-page-new.php',  array &$this,           'scripts_action'  ;      }  6.  Now, add the function to print our script and the URL parameter we use:     prints the scripts     function scripts_action         {          $nonce=wp_create_nonce 'insights-nonce' ;          wp_enqueue_script 'jquery' ;         wp_enqueue_script 'insights', $this->plugin_url.          ' insights.js', array 'jquery'  ;         wp_localize_script 'insights', 'InsightsSettings',           array 'insights_url' => $this->plugin_url, 'nonce' =>           $nonce  ;  7.  Finally, we need to create the Ajax response. Create a new file, insights-ajax.  php, which will handle all Ajax search queries:      }  <?php  require_once '.. .. .. wp-config.php' ;  if  $_GET['search']    {         check security     check_ajax_referer 'insights-nonce' ;      die search_posts $_GET['search']  ; } else     die 'No results found.' ;     search posts function search_posts $search  {     global $wpdb, $WPInsights;  [ 177 ]                                                                                                                                                    Insights for WordPress         create query     $search = $wpdb->escape $search ;     $posts = $wpdb->get_results "SELECT ID, post_title,       post_content FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_status = 'publish'       AND  post_title LIKE '%$search%' OR post_content LIKE       '%$search%'  ORDER BY post_title LIMIT 0,5" ;             if  $posts      foreach  $posts as $post        {            display every post link and excerpt         $output .= '                        ID  . '"               style="cursor:pointer;"  >              ' . $post->post_title . '                             ' . get_excerpt $post->post_content, 25  . ' ';     }      else         $output .= 'No posts matched "' .           stripslashes $search  . '"';          return $output; }     get the content excerpt function get_excerpt $text, $length = 25  {     if  !$length          return $text;      $text = strip_tags $text ;     $words = explode ' ', $text, $length + 1 ;     if  count $words  > $length       {         array_pop $words ;         array_push $words, '...' ;         $text = implode ' ', $words ;     }     return $text; } ?>  [ 17 ]   Putting all of this together, we will have created a functional Ajax search for the editor page,  which can find posts for us in an instant!  Chapter 6  What just happened? We will add our script to the WordPress admin pages using a method that allows us to  decide which admin pages to print scripts on. To do that, you need to append the admin  page name to the action name, as shown here:  add_action 'admin_print_scripts-post.php',  array &$this,   'scripts_action'  ; add_action 'admin_print_scripts-page.php',    array &$this, 'scripts_action'  ; add_action 'admin_print_scripts-post-new.php',   array &$this, 'scripts_action'  ; add_action 'admin_print_scripts-page-new.php',   array &$this, 'scripts_action'  ;  The page names are page.php or post-new.php or any other WordPress admin page  which you can see in your browser. Using this method, we avoid cluttering other pages with  unnecessary scripts.  As always, we use jQuery to handle JavaScript events. In this case, we want to respond to the  user clicking the search button and pressing the Enter or Down Arrow keys.     search button click event $ 'insights-submit' .click function     {     submit_me  ;  [ 17 ]   Insights for WordPress  } ;     check for ENTER or ArrowDown keys $ 'insights-search' .keypress function e    {     if  e.keyCode == 13  e.keyCode == 40        {         submit_me  ;         return false;     }  } ;  As you may notice, the keypress event returns false if the desired key was   pressed, signaling to the browser that we've handled the event, and it should not   be processed anymore.  If that was not the case, the Enter key would have submitted the entire post for saving,  because our panel is placed within a WordPress edit post form  almost the whole page is .   That is also the reason why we used this method instead of creating our form  we did not  want to create a nested form .  Our submit_me   function is a typical interface to an Ajax call. We added some simple  optimization by testing if the search string was empty:  if  $ 'insights-search' .val  .length==0    {  And if the current query is different from the previously saved one:  if  query!=last_query   The results are gathered by using the jQuery load method to call our external script:  $ 'insights-results' .load query ;  Our Ajax responder, insights-ajax.php, contains a function to search all the posts for a  given keyword and return a list of post titles, links and excerpts.  Our keyword is first escaped and then run through a MySQL query using the LIKE directive  to compare to post titles and content:  $search = $wpdb->escape $search ; $posts = $wpdb->get_results "SELECT ID, post_title, post_content   FROM $wpdb->posts WHERE post_status = 'publish' AND  post_title   LIKE '%$search%' OR post_content LIKE '%$search%'  ORDER BY   post_title LIMIT 0,5" ;  We now have a list of links that we can copy and paste to the WordPress editor.  [ 10 ]   It is certainly much faster than before, but we can speed the things up by inserting the links  directly into the WordPress tinyMCE editor.  Chapter 6  Quick reference admin_print_scripts-post.php: By referencing the page in the action  name, the action will be called only on the given page, reducing the server load  in the rest of the admin panel.  Interacting with tinyMCE  tinyMCE is a popular web-based WYSIWYG editor which WordPress uses for rich-text post  editing. tinyMCE has a JavaScript interface which we will use to access common functions  such as inserting the text directly to the editor.  Time for action – Insert the link into tinyMCE  1.

Because we included the tinyMCE integration, all you have to do now—to create a link—is  to select some text on your blog, search for a matching post, and just click on it. The link   will be automatically created. Something that took few minutes before now only takes a   few seconds.  [ 12 ]   Chapter 6  The post link is assigned the onclick event that sends the link to the insert_link    JavaScript function:  <a onclick="insert_link 'http:  scriptcopy.com devblog ?p=114' ;  return false;"> Digg this plugin   This function first checks if the tinyMCE editor is present:  function insert_link html_link    {     if   typeof tinyMCE != "undefined"  &&   edt = tinyMCE.      getInstanceById 'content'    && !edt.isHidden           {  We then get the selected text, create an HTML link and send it to the   send_wp_editor   function:        if   typeof tinyMCE != "undefined"  &&   edt =         tinyMCE.getInstanceById 'content'    && !edt.isHidden            {           var sel = edt.selection.getSel  ;           if  sel            {             var link = ' '               + sel + ' ';             send_wp_editor link ;           }         }     } }  We used the WordPress built in send_to_editor   function  declared in  wp-admin js  media_upload.js  to send HTML to the tinyMCE editor.     send html to the editor function send_wp_editor html  {         var win = window.dialogArguments  opener  parent  top;     win.send_to_editor html ;             alternatively direct tinyMCE command for insert        tinyMCE.execCommand "mceInsertContent", false, html ; }  Alternatively, we could have sent the data directly using tinyMCE's   mceInsertContent command.  tinyMCE is a huge project on its own, and you can find more on tinyMCE commands and  functions available at http:  tinymce.moxiecode.com .

Using Flickr API  Just as easily as we used the Digg API in our first plugin, we will use the Flickr API to enhance  our Insights plugin further.   In order to use Flickr API, you need to first register for an API key at http:  www.flickr. com services api keys apply .  [ 14 ]   Chapter 6  This in turn allows you to use all of the Flickr services including searching and uploading   of photos.  In order to complete our plugin, we will need to learn how to use the search functionality   of Flickr.  Time for action – Display Flickr photos Let's introduce the Flickr API to our plugin. This will allow you to display a list of images from  Flickr and insert them into your article with a click of a mouse!  1.  Modify the draw_panel   function to include two radio checkboxes allowing us  to select posts or images:      function draw_panel         {         echo '          Enter keywords you would like to search for and press the            Search button.          <input name="insights-radio" type="radio" checked=""            value="1"  >  Posts                         Images                     <input type="text" id="insights-search" name="insights-           search" size="25" autocomplete="off"  > 2.

Since Flickr allows searching   of images by both tag and description, we will include both the methods for   better results:     handle Flickr photos   function search_images $keyword    {           search by tags         $tag_images = search_flickr $keyword, 'tags'  ;           search by description       $text_images = search_flickr $keyword, 'text' ;                                      [ 16 ]   Chapter 6  6.  Flickr allows us to see photos in several different predefined sizes, so we will add a Flickr allows us to see photos in several different predefined sizes, so we will add a  selection box before the images, to select the size we want to use in our article:        if any results    if  $tag_images  $text_images       {           output image size selection box        $output = '        Image size:           Thumbnail  75px           Small  100px           Normal  240px           Medium  500px           Large  1024px                    ';            output images        if  $tag_images           $output .= $tag_images;         if  $text_images           $output .= $text_images;    }    else        $output = 'No images matched "' . stripslashes $keyword  .

All that is handled by one function:     call the Flickr Api     function search_flickr $keyword, $mode = 'tags', $count = 16      {            prepare Flickr query         $params = array          'api_key' => '72c75157d9ef89547c5a7b85748106e4',          'method' => 'flickr.photos.search',          'format' => 'php_serial',          'tag_mode' => 'any',            'per_page' => $count,          'license' => '4,6,7',           'sort' => 'interestingness-desc',             $mode => $keyword ;       $encoded_params = array  ;  [ 17 ]   Insights for WordPress                                                            foreach  $params as $k => $v          {              encode parameters           $encoded_params[] = urlencode $k  .

We used the Flickr API to get a collection of photos matching our search phrase.  Using the API is easy—thanks to the extensive Flickr API documentation and lots   of examples. In our case, we used the flickr.photos.search method with   additional parameters:       call the Flickr Api   function search_flickr $keyword, $mode = 'tags', $count = 16    {          prepare Flickr query       $params = array        'api_key' => '72c75157d9ef89547c5a7b85748106e4',        'method' => 'flickr.photos.search',        'format' => 'php_serial',        'tag_mode' => 'any',        'per_page' => $count,       'license' => '4,6,7',        'sort' => 'interestingness-desc',        $mode => $keyword ;  [ 1 ]   Insights for WordPress  We can select how many photos we want  per page , what the format of the response  should be  format , how the images should be sorted  sort , and many other options.  Calling the API is a simple matter of using a URL:            call the Flickr API         $url = "http:  api.flickr.com services rest ?" . implode '&',         $encoded_params ;        $rsp = wp_remote_fopen $url ;  Since we asked for for php_serial data, we can use the unserialize   function to parse  the Flickr  response:           decode the response       $rsp_obj = unserialize $rsp ;  F nally, we create output based on the data we get from Flickr in a predefined form:         if we have photos     if  $rsp_obj && $rsp_obj['photos']['total'] > 0        {         foreach  $rsp_obj['photos']['photo'] as $photo            {              link to photo page           $link = 'http:  www.flickr.com photos ' . $photo['owner']             .

'_' . $photo['secret'];  Since we assigned the onclick event to every photo, we can easily add them to our editor  using the same tinyMCE functionality we used earlier.               create output           $output .= '<img hspace="2" vspace="2" src="' . $src . '_s.            jpg" title="' . $photo['title'] . '" onclick="insert_image             \'' . $link . '\', \'' . $src . '\', \'' . str_replace             "'", "&acute;", $photo['title']  . '\' ;"  >';         }  The user can select the size, and we retrieve the value of the selected box.   function insert_image link, src, title    {     var size = document.getElementById 'img_size' .value;  To retrieve the picture with the given size, we only need to form the URL differently.   [ 10 ]   Chapter 6  For every photo, we also create a link to the original author's page to attribute their work:       var img = ' <img src="' + src + size +       '.jpg" alt="' + title + '" title="' + title + '" hspace="5"       border="0"  > ';      send_wp_editor img ; }  And now with a click of the mouse, we can add a photo to our post.  Quick reference Wp_remote_fopen $url : Get the contents of a remote page Flickr API documentation: http:  www.flickr.com services api   Using third-party solutions—phpFlickr Sometimes, there may be a possibility of using a third-party solution for your plugin; in this  case, it was the excellent phpFlickr API. It contains a set of PHP functions that make it easy to  handle Flickr functionalities.  Using an API like phpFlickr allows you to concentrate on top-level functions, while the API  author will worry about any changes Flickr may have on their own API.  However, when using such a package, you also need to consider the following: ackage, you also need to consider the following: you also need to consider the following:      You will still need to keep your plugin updated with the current version of the given  package to preserve compatibility. The package will add to the size of your own plugin, in some cases considerably    the current phpFlickr package is almost 400 KB on its own! .  [ 11 ]   Insights for WordPress  When making a decision on this,  it is usually a compromise between speed and ease of  development with the considerations mentioned above.  Creating a tinyMCE plugin  tinyMCE is such a big editor that supports plugins on its own.  We will create a tinyMCE button on the editor toolbar with assigned functionality.  In ord r to cr at  a tinyMCE plugin, we need to follow the procedure as stated on the  tinyMCE plugin documentation page  http:  wiki.moxiecode.com index.php  TinyMCE:Create_plugin 3.x  and also WordPress codex for implementing tinyMCE  plugins within WordPress  http:  codex.wordpress.org TinyMCE_Custom_Buttons .  Time for action – Adding a button to tinyMCE  1.  Let's start by adding WordPress related tinyMCE handling. Edit our class  constructor and add:          add_action 'admin_print_scripts-post-new.php',  array &$this,           'scripts_action'  ;         add_action 'admin_print_scripts-page-new.php',  array &$this,           'scripts_action'  ;             add tinyMCE handlig         add_action  'init', array  &$this, 'add_tinymce'   ;      }                              2.  This function will add the necessary filters to handle the plugin and the button:  function add_tinymce     {     if   ! current_user_can  'edit_posts'   && ! current_user_can        'edit_pages'         return;      if   get_user_option 'rich_editing'  == 'true'         {         add_filter  'mce_external_plugins', array  &$this,           'add_tinymce_plugin'    ;         add_filter  'mce_buttons', array  &$this,           'add_tinymce_button'   ;     } }  [ 12 ]   Chapter 6  3.  WordPress filters, mce_external_plugins and mce_buttons, are used to   register the plugin and the button:      function add_tinymce_plugin  $plugin_array         {         $plugin_array['insights'] = $this->plugin_url. '           insights-mceplugin.js';         return $plugin_array;     }      function add_tinymce_button  $buttons         {         array_push  $buttons, "separator", 'btnInsights'  ;         return $buttons;     }  4.  You will need to have a 20x20 image for your button. You can call it button.gif and   save it in the i  folder  'i' for images .  5.  The plugin itself is a JavaScript module in which you define commands and buttons.   Let's create a file, insights-mceplugin.js:                      Insights tinyMCE 3 plugin    function     {     tinymce.create 'tinymce.plugins.Insights',       {          init : function ed, url            {                  Register the command so that it can be invoked by                      using tinyMCE.activeEditor.execCommand 'mceInsights' ;                                      ed.addCommand 'mceInsights', function               {             ed.windowManager.open               {                 file : url + ' insights-popup.php',                 width : 650,                 height : 520,                 inline : 1             },              {                 plugin_url : url,    Plugin absolute URL             } ;         } ;                Register a button  [ 13 ]                                                                  Insights for WordPress          ed.addButton 'btnInsights',           {           title : 'Insights',           cmd : 'mceInsights',           image : url + ' i button.gif'         } ;      },         Returns information about the plugin as a name value array.     getInfo : function         {         return           {             longname : 'Insights for WordPress',             author : 'Vladimir Prelovac',             authorurl : 'http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir',             infourl : 'http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir               wordpress-plugins insights',             version : "0.1"         };     }   } ;       Register plugin   tinymce.PluginManager.add 'insights', tinymce.plugins.Insights ; }   ;  6.  We will have a pop-up window when the button is pressed, so we also need a   corresponding PHP file. Create the insights-popup.php file with simple content  just for now:          Hello World!      The result is the I button on the tinyMCE toolbar, which opens a specified document  in a new window within our document.  [ 14 ]   Chapter 6  What just happened? We have created a tinyMCE plugin which opens a window in our editor.  In order to hook our plugin and button into tinyMCE, we must first use the two WordPress  tinyMCE filters, mce_external_plugins and mce_buttons:  add_filter  'mce_external_plugins', array  &$this,   'add_tinymce_plugin'    ; add_filter  'mce_buttons', array  &$this, 'add_tinymce_button'   ;  To declare the tinyMCE plugin, we need to provide the URL to the plugin.js file:  function add_tinymce_plugin  $plugin_array     {     $plugin_array['insights'] = $this->plugin_url. '       insights-mceplugin.js';     return $plugin_array; }  To add the button, we pass our button identifier to the function  the same as the one we  used in the plugin.js file .  We also pass an extra separator button to separate our button from the rest:  function add_tinymce_button  $buttons     {     array_push  $buttons, "separator", 'btnInsights'  ;     return $buttons; }  [ 15 ]   Insights for WordPress  The tinyMCE plugin JavaScript file is used to initialize the plugin and define its functionality.  We cr at d a n w tinyMCE command, and named it mceInsights. It opens a window with  our insights-popup.php.  ed.addCommand 'mceInsights', function     {     ed.windowManager.open       {         file : url + ' insights-popup.php',         width : 650,         height : 520,         inline : 1     },       {         plugin_url : url,    Plugin absolute URL     } ; } ;  You can specify the width and the height of the new window. The inline parameter  specifies if the file will be opened in the current document or in a new browser window.  The command function can be anything you want, and does not have to create a window at  all. For example:  ed.addCommand 'mceInsights',do_something ;  Where do_something is a JavaScript function that is executed when the command is called.  To register a button, we need to declare a unique identifier, btnInsights, and associate the  command, mceInsights, which will be executed when the button is clicked, on the path to  the button image file,  i button.gif.     Register a button     ed.addButton 'btnInsights',       {         title : 'Insights',         cmd : 'mceInsights',         image : url + ' i button.gif'     } ;  That covers the creation of a tinyMCE button and a plugin. Let's move the functionality of  our WordPress panel to the new window now.  [ 16 ]   Create a functional tinyMCE plugin window Our tinyMCE window will be opened in a new frame or in a new window. This means that it  will be a standalone HTML document.  So we will need to call all the necessary .js files such as jQuery and define all other  elements of a HTML file.   Chapter 6  Time for action – Open a tinyMCE window Let's create an example tinyMCE window.  <?php require_once '.. .. .. wp-config.php' ; ?>           Insights          * <![CDATA[ *      var insights_url="        wp-content plugins insights";  * ]]> *         <script type='text javascript' src='<?php echo get_ option 'siteurl'  ?> wp-includes js jquery jquery.js'>       <script type="text javascript" src="<?php echo get_ option 'siteurl'  ?> wp-content plugins insights insights.js"><  script>              <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo get_option 'siteurl'   ?> wp-includes js tinymce themes advanced skins wp_theme dialog. css?ver=311" >             Enter keywords you would like to search for and press Search  button.       <input name="insights-radio" type="radio" checked="" value="1"   >  Posts           Images              <input type="text" id="insights-search" name="insights-search"  size="25"  >  [ 17 ]       <input id="insights-submit" class="button" type="button"  value="Search" autocomplete="off"  >                      Insights for WordPress       The result is a plugin form with a functionality similar to that of our original   WordPress panel. The two can exist together.  What just happened? We created a new window within the editor, and because the window opens as a new  independent document, we need to specify all the required HTML elements.  [ 1 ]   Chapter 6  That means we also need to manually include the necessary JavaScript files, jQuery and our  also need to manually include the necessary JavaScript files, jQuery and our  insights.js file:file:  <script type='text javascript' src='<?php echo get_option   'siteurl'  ?> wp-includes js jquery jquery.js'>       <script type="text javascript" src="<?php echo get_option  'siteurl'  ?> wp-content plugins insights insights.js">   We can see that this is not as elegant anymore as we are now stepping outside WordPress.  So we lose a part of the functionality as well. Also, every time this window is opened, certain  waiting time is involved as the scripts need to be read and parsed again. You may have  already experienced that in working with the tinyMCE plugins.  On the other hand, you can transform the editor into virtually anything as it allows you to  change almost every one of its aspects.

Adding localization is fairly simple. First we need to add a function to our class that   will load the translation file:         Localization support     function handle_load_domain         {            get current language         $locale = get_locale  ;              locate translation file         $mofile = WP_PLUGIN_DIR.'

'.mo';              load translation         load_textdomain $this->plugin_domain, $mofile ;     }  [ 204 ]   4.  Since loading the file takes resources, we will load it only when the translation is  actually needed by checking the current page  $pagenow  and the list of pages  pages where we need translations  $local_pages array :  Chapter 7         Initialize the plugin     function PostTypes         {         global $wp_version, $pagenow;                     pages where our plugin needs translation         $local_pages=array 'plugins.php' ;                  if  in_array $pagenow, $local_pages               $this->handle_load_domain  ;          $exit_msg='Post Types requires WordPress 2.5 or newer.                      Please update! ';  5.  Finally, to use the available translations, we only need to enclose our text in the   __   function:          $this->handle_load_domain  ;          $exit_msg=__ 'Post Types requires WordPress 2.5 or newer.                      Please update! ', $this->plugin_domain ;          if  version_compare $wp_version,"2.5","<"    What just happened? We have added localization support to our plugin by using the provided   localization functions provided by WordPress.  Currently, we have only localized the error message for WordPress version checking:  we have only localized the error message for WordPress version checking: we have only localized the error message for WordPress version checking:  $exit_msg=__ 'Post Types requires WordPress 2.5 or newer.

To load localization, we created a handle_load_domain function..

The file name is derived from the  locale, and the *.mo language file extension:       locate translation file   $mofile = WP_PLUGIN_DIR.' '.plugin_basename     dirname __FILE__  .' lang ' . $this->plugin_domain .     '-' . $locale . '.mo';  Finally, the localization file is loaded using the load_textdomain   function, taking our  text domain and .mo file as parameters.       load translation   load_textdomain $this->plugin_domain, $mofile ;  Optimizing localization usage The translation file needs to be loaded as the first thing in the plugin—before you output any  messages. So we have placed it as the first thing in the plugin constructor. first thing in the plugin constructor.  in the plugin constructor.  Since loading the translation file occurs at the beginning of the constructor, which is  executed every time, it is a good idea to select only the pages where the translation will be the pages where the translation will be  where the translation will be  needed in order to preserve resources.  resources. resources.

How does localization work? For localization to work, you need to provide .po and .mo files with your plugins. These files  are created by using external tools such as PoEdit, which we will cover in more detail in the  next chapter.  These tools output the compiled translation file, which can be then loaded by using the  tools output the compiled translation file, which can be then loaded by using the tools output the compiled translation file, which can be then loaded by using the compiled translation file, which can be then loaded by using the  load_textdomain   function. This function accepts a language domain name and a path  to the file.  In order to use translated messages, you can use the __ $text, $domain    and _e $text, $domain  functions. The _e   function is just an equivalent of   echo __  ;  These functions accept two parameters, the first being the desired text, and the second, the  language domain where the message will be looked for.  If no translation was found, the text is just printed out as it is. This means that you can , the text is just printed out as it is. This means that you can he text is just printed out as it is. This means that you can  always safely use these functions, even if you do not provide any translation files. This will  you do not provide any translation files. This will you do not provide any translation files. This will  prepare the plugin for future translation.  Quick reference $pagenow: A global variable holding the name of the currently displayed page  within WordPress. get_locale  : A function which gets the currently selected language. load_textdomain domain, filepath : This function loads the  localization file and adds it to the specified language domain identifier. _  ; _e  : These functions are used to find the output text using a given  language domain.

Let's start with a simple specify a photo and publish immediately.  immediately..   with a simple Add Photo template where we want to be able to just set the title,   Time for action – Create 'add photo' post template  1.  In order to create the post template, we need a place for it in the menus. We will  use the Write menu and place a submenu there:             add admin_menu action         add_action 'admin_menu',  array &$this, 'admin_menu'  ;     }         Hook the admin menu     function admin_menu         {            submenu pages        add_submenu_page 'post-new.php', __ 'Add Photo',         $this->plugin_domain  , __ 'Photo', $this->plugin_domain  , 1 ,         'add-photo',  array &$this, 'display_form'   ;     }  2.  Since we have localized text on our new page, we want to make sure that the   localization file is loaded on this page, so we will add it to our $local_pages array:      function PostTypes         {          global $wp_version, $pagenow;                   pages where our plugin needs translation         $local_pages=array 'plugins.php', 'post-new.php' ;          if  in_array $pagenow, $local_pages    3.  Let's create the template  folder and call our new write post template,    photo.php.  [ 20 ]   Chapter 7  4.  We will start the template with the boxes that display the information :                                                                                   plugin_domain ;           ?>  <a href="<?php echo get_permalink                                                               $published_id ;                    ?>"> plugin_domain ; ?>           &raquo;                               plugin_domain ; ?>            <?php wp_nonce_field $_GET['page'] ;  5.  Then add the Publish button using the WordPress CSS classes:                                               <input name="publish" type="submit"           class="button button-highlighted" tabindex="5" value="           plugin_domain ; ?>"  >           6.  Finally, we add the input fields to the template—title, photo URL or upload field,    and description:                            plugin_domain ; ?>         <input type="text" name="title" tabindex        ="1" value=" " id="title"  >           [ 20 ]   Post Types          ?>           <input style="width: 415px"  tabindex="2" type="text"           name="url" id="url" value=" "  >                                      <?php _e 'or Upload Photo:',$this-          >plugin_domain ; ?>           <input type="file"  tabindex="3" name="upload" id=                       plugin_domain ; ?>                                      <?php _e 'Enter URL:                          ',$this->plugin_domain ;                                                                      "upload"  >                                                                 <?php _e 'Description  optional '                      ,$this->plugin_domain ; ?>                    $description; ?>                                       <textarea name="description" id="description" rows="5"          style="width: 415px" tabindex="4"><?php echo                                                  7.  The template is done! To display it, we will create a display_form   function in   our main plugin class.         Display the Post form     function display_form         {         global $wpdb;  [ 210 ]   Chapter 7          $page=$_GET['page'];          switch  $page  :          case 'add-photo':          include  'template photo.php' ;          break;          endswitch;      }  The function does not process any information yet; it just prints out the template.  The end result is our new post template in the Write menu.  What just happened? We have just created a quick photo post template. For the sake of simplicity, the form has  been designed to have only three fields.  [ 211 ]   Post Types  When creating a backend form, you can design it any way you want, but you can also decide  to use the WordPress CSS classes.

WordPress upload dir  wp-content uploads    $uploads = wp_upload_dir  ;     check permissions if  is_writable $uploads['path']     {   $uploadfile=true; }  Now comes the part when we check if the post was published properly, and if there was an  image uploaded with it.   The information about uploaded file s  is stored in the global PHP $_FILES variable, and we  are interested in the upload reference as that is the name of our upload file field.  $url=$_POST['url'];     $upload=$_FILES['upload'];  if  $published  {   if  !empty $title  &&  !empty $upload['tmp_name']   !empty $url      {        if file uploaded     if  $upload['tmp_name']      {          handle uploaded image           $file=$this->handle_image_upload $upload ;  The handle_image_upload   function uses another built-in WordPress function to check  if the uploaded file—file_is_displayable_image  —is really an image.  function handle_image_upload $upload  {      check if image       if  file_is_displayable_image  $upload['tmp_name']       {  Further on, we call the wp_handle_upload   function. The purpose of this function is to  check the uploaded file  type, size etc  and move it to the WordPress uploads folder.   [ 21 ]   You can specify certain overrides; in this case we are overriding the test for form action, as  we are using a custom form.  Chapter 7    if  file_is_displayable_image  $upload['tmp_name']      {            handle the uploaded file        $overrides = array 'test_form' => false ;         $file=wp_handle_upload $upload, $overrides ;    }   return $file; }  The wp_handle_upload   function handles everything for our file, including moving it to  the upload directory and setting correct permissions. So, we do not need to worry about it. It  also returns a reference to the newly created file, which contains useful information such as  the new filename and a URL to the file, which we will need for displaying the photo.  In the next piece of code back in the main function, we will create a thumbnail of the  uploaded image to show it in the post and link it to the original picture.  Let's see how this is done:    if  $file    {     $image_url=$file['url'];         create a thumbnail     $size='medium';         $resized = image_make_intermediate_size  $file['file'],          get_option "{$size}_size_w" , get_option "{$size}_size_h" ,          get_option "{$size}_crop"   ;      if  $resized         $image_src=$uploads['url'] .' '.$resized['file'];     else       $image_src=$image_url;           $image_uploaded=true;   }   else     $error=__ 'Please upload a valid image.',$this->plugin_domain ; }  We use the WordPress image_make_intermediate_size   function, which accepts   the filename and resizing information as parameters. We chose to use the medium size,  which is already defined in the WordPress backend; height and width are stored in the  medium_size_h and medium_size_w options, respectively.  [ 21 ]   Post Types  Settings for the upload folder  Uploading  and Image sizes can be found on the WordPress  Miscellaneous Settings page:  We also need to handle cases where the picture is specified by a URL, in which case we will  just use the provided information:      else       $error=__ 'Please upload a valid image.',$this->plugin_domain ;   }       else    if file uploaded       {        $image_url=$url;        $image_src=$url;      }  [ 220 ]   Now, when we have the picture information, we can create the post content and insert a   new post:     create post content $content='      '.$description.' ';  Chapter 7     post information $data = array      'post_title' => $wpdb->escape $title ,   'post_content' => $wpdb->escape $content ,       'post_status' => $post_status                          ;     insert post $published_id = wp_insert_post $data ;  We will insert a custom field for our post, call it post-type and specify that it is   a Photo.     add a custom field add_post_meta $published_id,   "post-type",__ 'Photo',$this->plugin_domain  ;  Custom fields allow us to insert any type of information to WordPress posts and pages, and  in fact allow us transform WordPress into a CMS. We will get back to the custom fields in  more detail later.  We have uploaded and processed the image. If we want to follow it up all the   way, we want to add our photo to the WordPress Media Library by using the   wp_insert_attachment function.  if  $image_uploaded  {   $attachment = array          'post_mime_type' => $file['type'],     'guid' => $image_url,     'post_parent' => $published_id,     'post_title' => $wpdb->escape $title ,     'post_content' => $wpdb->escape $description ,    ;       insert post attachment   $aid = wp_insert_attachment $attachment, $file['file'],     $published_id ;       update metadata  [ 221 ]   Post Types    }    if   !is_wp_error $aid        {         wp_update_attachment_metadata  $aid,          wp_generate_attachment_metadata  $aid, $file['file']    ;  After we have done this, all new photos will turn up in the in the WordPress Media Library   Manage Media  looking like this:  Quick reference wp_handle_upload &$file, $overrides : A function which handles  user uploaded files.

[ 222 ]   Using custom fields  Custom fields are used in WordPress to store additional information about a post. They are  normally available to you in the Write Post screen as Key Value pairs.  Chapter 7  You can use custom fields to display information on the site or for some other kind of special  processing  like storing a post's expiration date .  Adding custom fields To add a custom field from the code, you can use the add_post_meta   function: add_post_meta $post_id, $meta_key, $meta_value, $unique           post_id: This parameter contains the ID of the post where the custom field is   to be added. meta_key: This parameter contains the key identifier  such as mood, job-type . meta_value: This parameter contains the value for the key  such as happy,  temporarily, and so on . unique: This parameter contains is used to decide whether you want this key to be  unique. WordPress supports multiple values for the same key, and if the value set is  unique, only one instance for the given key is allowed.prev_value: This contains  the previous value of the key, which helps us to differentiate the values if the key is  not unique.  To update existing fields, you can use the update_post_meta   function: update_post_meta $post_id, $meta_key, $meta_value, $prev_value   [ 223 ]   Post Types  Retrieving custom fields To retrieve custom fields, you can use one of the following functions:  get_post_custom $post_id : This function returns a multidimensional array with all the  custom fields of a particular post or page.    get_post_custom_keys $post_id : This function returns an array containing the keys  of all custom fields of a particular post or page.   get_post_custom_values $key, $post_id : This function gets the list of values for a  particular key on the current post.   get_post_meta $post_id, $key, $single = false : This function gets the value  for the specified key in a given post. If $single is true, then only the first key is returned   even if there are more .  For example:  get_post_meta 223, 'mood', false ;  Quick reference More on Custom Fields – http:  codex.wordpress.org Using_ Custom_Fields  Quick post a link  Add ng the link post type is easy when we know how to display the form and handle it.

Then, add a new submenu page for the Write screen :         Hook the admin menu     function admin_menu        {           submenu pages       add_submenu_page 'post-new.php', __ 'Add Photo',$this-        >plugin_domain  , __ 'Photo', $this->plugin_domain  , 1         , 'add-photo',  array &$this, 'display_form'   ;       add_submenu_page 'post-new.php', __ 'Add URL', $this-        >plugin_domain  ,  __ 'URL', $this->plugin_domain     , 1 ,         'add-url',  array &$this, 'display_form'   ;      }  3.  And finally, add the code to the display_form   switch case to handle the   rendering of the link form:           include  'template photo.php' ;      break;      case 'add-url':     $url=$_POST['url'];         if  $published      {       if  !empty $url         {         if  empty $title           $title=$url;          $content=' '.$title.'

We have added another post template using the previous form as a starting point. The code  is very similar, so we will not go into the details.   The recipe for adding further forms is:        Cr ate a new form based on a previous one and edit the form fields. Add the submenu page in the admin_menu   function. Add the form-specific handling code in the switch case of display_form  .  You can add as many forms as you like, for example to enter simple text, video, a quote,   and so on.  Tinkering with WordPress backend menus  S nc  we added the URL page under the Write menu, and there is already a Link page there   for adding links to the blogroll , we would like to remove the Link page from the menus to  prevent confusion.  You can easily do this  in fact, you can totally rearrange WordPress menus in any way you like .  Time for action - Remove 'Link' from the Write page  Removing an item from a menu is a simple matter. Lets add this code to the   admin_menu   function:    Hook to admin menu     function admin_menu         {         global $submenu;             remove 'Link' from Write menu         unset $submenu['post-new.php'][15] ;              submenu pages         add_submenu_page 'post-new.php', __ 'Add Photo',$this-          >plugin_domain  , __ 'Photo', $this->plugin_domain  , 1 ,           'add-photo',  array &$this, 'display_form'   ;   1.                           [ 22 ]   2.  That's all! The link page no longer shows in the menu.  Chapter 7  What just happened? We removed the Link page from the menus by unsetting it from the submenu array.   WordPress holds the entire backend menu structure in two globally available variables  $menu and $submenu.  Using these two variables, not only can you read entries, you can also change and delete  entries in the menus, and customize the menu structure to your liking by simply editing   the arrays.  To do that, we must first learn what this structure looks like. The easiest way to do that is to  use the print_r  function to dump the variable in a readable form.  Here is the sample output of print_r $menu :  Array     [0] => Array             [0] => Dashboard       [1] => read       [2] => index.php          [5] => Array             [0] => Write       [1] => edit_posts       [2] => post-new.php          [10] => Array             [0] => Manage       [1] => edit_posts       [2] => edit.php        [ 22 ]   Post Types    [15] => Array             [0] => Design       [1] => switch_themes       [2] => themes.php         [20] => Array             [0] => Comments                  0         [1] => edit_posts       [2] => edit-comments.php        As you can see, the menus are organized into multidimensional arrays. If you remove  elements of this array, they will not be displayed in the menu anymore.  For example:  unset $menu[10] ;    Remove Manage Menu unset $menu[15] ;    Remove Design Menu unset $menu[20] ;    Remove Comments Menu  This piece of code will cause the Manage, Design, and Comments pages to disappear from  the WordPress main menu leaving with only the with Write menu:  Similarly, we remove the Link page from the submenus:     remove 'Link' from Write menu unset $submenu['post-new.php'][15] ;  Using the menu arrays, you can customize the backend of a WordPress site to show  only relevant information for your purpose. If you are turning WordPress into a CMS,  implementing custom fields and tinkering with menus would be the first things on the list.  We can also hack into the Manage panel, which will allow us to show custom information in  the post listings. Let's learn how to do that!  Programming the Manage panel  The Manage Posts screen can be changed to show extra columns, or remove unwanted  columns in the listing.  [ 230 ]   Chapter 7  Let's say that we want to show the post type—Normal, Photo or Link. Remember the  custom field post-type that we added to our posts? We can use it now to differentiate   post types.  Time for action – Add post type column in the Manage panel We want to add a new column to the Manage  an l, and w  w ll call  t Type. The value of  the column will represent the post type—Normal, Photo or Link.   1.  Expand the admin_menu   function to load the function to handle Manage   Page hooks:           add_submenu_page 'post-new.php', __ 'Add URL',         $this->plugin_domain  ,  __ 'URL', $this->plugin_domain  , 1 ,        'add-url', array &$this, 'display_form'   ;          handle Manage page hooks       add_action 'load-edit.php', array &$this, 'handle_load_edit'   ;     }  2.  Add the hooks to the columns on the Manage screen:        Manage page hooks     function handle_load_edit         {          handle Manage screen functions       add_filter 'manage_posts_columns', array &$this,         'handle_posts_columns'  ;       add_action 'manage_posts_custom_column', array &$this,         'handle_posts_custom_column' , 10, 2 ;      }  3.  Then implement the function to add a new Column, remove the author and replace   the date with our date format :        Handle Column header     function handle_posts_columns $columns        {          add 'type' column       $columns['type'] = __ 'Type',$this->plugin_domain ;       return $columns;     }     4.  For date key replacement, we need an extra function:     function array_change_key_name  $orig, $new, &$array       {       foreach   $array as $k => $v         $return[   $k === $orig   ? $new : $k ] = $v;       return   array   $return;     }  [ 231 ]   Post Types  5.  And finally, insert a function to handle the display of information in that column:         Handle Type column display     function handle_posts_custom_column $column_name, $id       {            'type' column handling based on post type         if  $column_name == 'type'             {             $type=get_post_meta $id, 'post-type', true ;             echo $type ? $type : __ 'Normal',$this->plugin_domain ;         }         }  6.  Don't forget to add the manage page to the list of localized pages:             pages where our plugin needs translation     $local_pages=array 'plugins.php', 'post-new.php', 'edit.php' ;      if  in_array $pagenow, $local_pages    As a result, we now have a new column that displays the post type using information from a  post custom field.  [ 232 ]   What just happened? We have used the load-edit.php action to specify that we want our hooks to be assigned  only on the Manage Posts page  edit.php . This is similar to the optimization we did when  we loaded the localization files.  The handle_posts_columns is a filter that accepts the columns as a parameter and allows  you to insert a new column:  Chapter 7  function handle_posts_columns $columns   {   $columns['type'] = __ 'Type',$this->plugin_domain ;   return $columns; }  You are also able to remove a column. This example would remove the Author column:  unset $columns['author'] ;  To handle information display in that column, we use the   handle_posts_custom_column action.  The action is called for each entry  post , whenever an unknown column is encountered.  WordPress passes the name of the column and current post ID as parameters.  That allows us to extract the post type from a custom field:  function handle_posts_custom_column $column_name, $id    {   if  $column_name == 'type'       {     $type=get_post_meta $id, 'post-type', true ;  It also allows us to print it out:      echo $type ? $type : __ 'Normal',$this->plugin_domain ;   } }  Modifying an existing column  we want to change the way We can also modify an existing column. Let's say we want to change the way we want to change the way Date   is displayed. displayed..  Here are the changes we would make to the code:  changes we would make to the code: changes we would make to the code: code::         Handle Column header     function handle_posts_columns $columns        {  [ 233 ]   Post Types           add 'type' column       $columns['type'] = __ 'Type',$this->plugin_domain ;           remove 'author' column         unset $columns['author'] ;           change 'date' column       $columns = $this->array_change_key_name  'date', 'date_new',         $columns  ;        return $columns;     }         Handle Type column display     function handle_posts_custom_column $column_name, $id        {            'type' column handling based on post type         if  $column_name == 'type'             {             $type=get_post_meta $id, 'post-type', true ;             echo $type ? $type : __ 'Normal',$this->plugin_domain ;         }             new date column handling          if  $column_name == 'date_new'             {             the_time 'Y-m-d   g:i:s a' ;         }     }      function array_change_key_name  $orig, $new, &$array       {         foreach   $array as $k => $v           $return[   $k === $orig   ? $new : $k ] = $v;         return   array   $return;     }  The example replaces the date column with our own date_new column and uses it to  display the date with our preferred formatting.

Chapter 7  Time for action – Add a search filter box  1.  Let's start by adding two more hooks to the handle_load_edit   function. The  restrict_manage_posts function draws the search box and the posts_where  alters the database query to select only the posts of the type we want to show.

Let's write the corresponding function to draw the select box:         Handle select box for Manage page     function handle_restrict_manage_posts         {       ?>                View all types        <option value="normal" <?php if  $_GET['post_type']=='normal'          echo 'selected="selected"' ?>><?php _e         'Normal',$this->plugin_domain ; ?>        <option value="photo" <?php if  $_GET['post_type']=='photo'          echo 'selected="selected"' ?>><?php _e         'Photo',$this->plugin_domain ; ?>   [ 235 ]   Post Types        <option value="link" <?php if  $_GET['post_type']=='link'          echo 'selected="selected"' ?>><?php _e         'Link',$this->plugin_domain ; ?>                <?php      }  3.  And finally, we need a function that will change the query to retrieve only the posts   of the selected type:         Handle query for Manage page     function handle_posts_where $where        {       global $wpdb;       if  $_GET['post_type'] == 'photo'           {         $where .= " AND ID IN  SELECT post_id FROM {$wpdb->postmeta}           WHERE meta_key='post-type' AND meta_value='".__          'Photo',$this->plugin_domain ."'  ";       }       else if  $_GET['post_type'] == 'link'           {           $where .= " AND ID IN  SELECT post_id FROM {$wpdb->postmeta}           WHERE meta_key='post-type' AND meta_value='".__           'Link',$this->plugin_domain ."'  ";       }       else if  $_GET['post_type'] == 'normal'           {         $where .= " AND ID NOT IN  SELECT post_id FROM           {$wpdb->postmeta} WHERE meta_key='post-type'  ";         }       return $where;     }  What just happened? We have added a new select box to the header of the Manage panel. It allows us to filter the  post types we want to show.   We added the box using the restrict_manage_posts action that is triggered at the end of   the Manage panel header and allows us to insert HTML code, which we used to draw a  select box.  [ 236 ]   Chapter 7  To actually perform the filtering, we use the posts_where filter, which is run when a query  is made to fetch the posts from the database.  if  $_GET['post_type'] == 'photo'     {   $where .= " AND ID IN  SELECT post_id FROM {$wpdb->postmeta}     WHERE meta_key='post-type' AND meta_value='".__     'Photo',$this->plugin_domain ."'  ";  If a photo is selected, we inspect the WordPress database postmeta table and select posts  that have the post-type key with the value, Photo.  At this point, we have a functional plugin. What we can do further to improve it is to add  user permissions checks, so that only those users allowed to write posts and upload files are  allowed to use it.  Quick reference manage_posts_columns $columns : This acts as a filter for adding  removing columns in the Manage Posts panel. Simlarly, we use the function,  manage_pages_columns for the Manage Pages panel. manage_posts_custom_column $column, $post_id : This acts as  an action to display information for the given column and post. Alternatively,  manage_pages_custom_column for Manage Pages panel. posts_where $where : This acts as a filter for the where clause in the  query that gets the posts. restrict_manage_posts: This acts as an action that runs at the end of the  Manage panel header and allows you to insert HTML.  Handling error messages  WordPress provides a simple class called WP_Error that allows us to keep all our error  messages tidy and in one place.  place. place.  Time for action – Adding support for errors  Change the plugin constructor to add initialization of error class:     if  version_compare $wp_version,"2.5","<"       {         exit  $exit_msg ;     }  1.                      initialize the error class  [ 237 ]   Post Types           $this->error = new WP_Error  ;     $this->init_errors  ;              add admin_menu action     add_action 'admin_menu',  array &$this, 'admin_menu'  ;  2.   Initialize all our errors by defining the error code and the message:         Init error messages     function init_errors       {         $this->error->add 'e_image', __ 'Please upload a valid           image.',$this->plugin_domain  ;         $this->error->add 'e_title', __ 'You need to enter a title           and add a photo.',$this->plugin_domain  ;         $this->error->add 'e_url', __ 'You need to enter a           URL.',$this->plugin_domain  ;     }  3.  Add a function to retrieve an error:          Retrieve an error message     function my_error $e = ''        {          $msg = $this->error->get_error_message $e ;          if  $msg == null            {             return __ "Unknown error occured, please contact the               administrator.", $this->plugin_domain ;         }         return $msg;     }  4.  Finally replace the old error messages with our new function:              else             $error=$this->my_error 'e_image' ;         }         else    if file uploaded          else             $error=$this->my_error 'e_title' ;       }        include  'template photo.php' ;        else  [ 23 ]   Chapter 7          $error=$this->my_error 'e_url' ;     }      include  'template link.php' ;  What just happened? We used the integrated WordPress error class for displaying error messages.  We initialize the class in the plugin constructor and call the error message   initialization function:  $this->error = new WP_Error  ; $this->init_errors  ;  To add new errors, we use the add method of the error class, and define the message with  code and text:  $this->error->add 'e_image', __ 'Please upload a valid   image.',$this->plugin_domain  ;  We then created the my_error function that retrieves the error message using the   get_error_message method:  $msg = $this->error->get_error_message $e ;  Quick reference WP_Error: This is the WordPress class for handling error messages. Use the  add and get_error_message methods to store and retrieve messages.  User roles and capabilities  Let's add some checks to our plugin to prevent unauthorized users from publishing posts and  uploading files using our post templates.  This can be done using the WordPress capabilities system, providing us with functions to  check if the user is allowed to perform a certain action.  [ 23 ]   Post Types  1.  Time for action – Add user capability checks  Let's add our first check, to see if the user can publish posts. All capability checks are  performed using the current_user_can   function. We will include a new variable in the display_form   function to hold the new  post's status:              if  $published              {               check_admin_referer $page ;                  $post_status = current_user_can 'publish_posts'  ?                   'publish' : 'pending';              }  2.  Change the Publish button in both the template files, link.php and photo.php, to   show different text if the user can not publish:                                                                  <input name="publish" type="submit"                 class="button button-highlighted" tabindex="4"                 value="<?php if  current_user_can 'publish_posts'                   _e 'Publish', $this->plugin_domain ; else _e 'Submit',                 $this->plugin_domain ; ?>"  >                  upload files:  3.  Finally, edit the display_form  to check if the current user is allowed to                       check permissions                  if  is_writable $uploads['path']  &&                   current_user_can 'upload_files'                     {                     $uploadfile=true;                 }  With the capabilities systems in place, we are now able to restrict the actions of users  without enough privileges to publish the post or upload files to the server.  Congratulations! That was the last bit of code needed to finish our last plugin!  [ 240 ]   Chapter 7  What just happened? User capabilities provide a flexible model for checking the permissions of the user.  Roles and capabilities are interconnected, but the capabilities of a role can be changed  dynamically by other plugins. So it is adviseable to always check for capabilities instead   of roles.  User capabilities are checked using the current_user_can $action  function,   which accepts the desired action as a parameter. Actions can be edit_posts,   or upload_plugins, and so on.  Bearing in mind that WordPress sites can be used by multiple users, you should always make  sure to assign the correct capabilities for the features of you plugin.  Quick reference current_user_can $action : This function is used to check if the  current user is capable of performing a certain action. A full reference for roles and capabilities is available at http:  codex. wordpress.org Roles_and_Capabilities.  Have a go Hero With this plugin, we explored the core of the WordPress backend.  There are a few features you can consider now, that could improve this plugin further:          Include tags and perhaps categories to the post templates Create more interesting post templates For the photo template, you can download the image instead of linking to it, if the  image is specified with a URL Create a mobile phone friendly admin panel by removing all other unnecessary  menus and leaving only the quick post templates  Summary  The purpose of the Post Types plugin was to introduce you to different aspects of WordPress  backend development.

[ 242 ]     Development Goodies  Plugin development does not end with a finished plugin—depending on the plugin's purpose  there are several more phases a plugin author needs to consider.  This chapter will cover additional steps involved in localizing, documenting, publishing, and  promoting the plugin. It will also cover useful tips and ideas to further improve your general  WordPress knowledge.   In this chapter, you will learn about:            Handling localization files Managing documentation and providing support Managing your plugin using SVN and publishing it to the WordPress   Plugin Repository Distributing and promoting your plugin Staying up-to-date by working on the latest development version of WordPress  The final sections of the chapter are devoted to information about WordPress MU  development and other useful online resources.  Creating Localization files  In Chapter 7, we have learned how to use the localization functionalities provided by  WordPress. Using the __   and _e   functions, we can specify localizable text that users  can translate to different languages.  We can split the localization process in two phases.  In the first phase, you need to generate a POT file that will describe all localizable strings  used in the plugin.   Development Goodies  In the second phase, users generate .po and .mo files in their desired language. A PO file  is the same as a POT file, but includes translated strings in another language. A MO file is  actually a compiled PO file and is loaded by the load_text_domain   function that we  used in the WordPress plugin.  Localization process is usually performed using external tools that are available for Windows,  Mac OS or Linux platforms. Example of one such popular multi-platform tool is Poedit, which  we will use in this chapter.   Time for action - Create a POT file Here is how to create a .pot file using Poedit:  1.  2.  If you do not have it already, download Poedit from   http:  www.poedit.net download.php Select the option New catalog… under the File menu. It will open a window where  you can fill in some basic details, including your plugin name. You may also want to  fill in the default plugin language and the file charset:  [ 244 ]   3.  In the Paths tab, add ..  for the base path as we will keep the language files inside   the lang  folder in the plugin.  Chapter 8  4.  Finally, in the Keywords tab, add __ and _e as our language functions.  [ 245 ]   Development Goodies  5.  Press OK and then select All files from the Save dialog. Save the file in the lang    folder of the plugin, manually typing .pot as the extension.  6.  After the file is saved, Poedit will scan through your plugin files and display a list of   all the strings that can be translated.  [ 246 ]   Chapter 8  What just happened? You have created basic a POT file that users can use to create translations in their   own language.  Updating POT file You will need to update the POT file manually with every new release of your plugin. To do  this, you need to do the following:  1. 2. 3.  Open the POT file. Select the Update from sources option from the Catalog menu. Save the POT file.  [ 247 ]   Development Goodies  Time for action – Perform translation Here is how to create a new translation:  1. 2.  Start Poedit, and select New catalog from POT file... from the File menu. Select the POT file supplied with the plugin. Now, you can enter the project  information relating to the translation.  3.  Go through all the strings and translate them. Be careful to leave all the %s and %d   references. These will be replaced with a string or a number by the plugin.  [ 24 ]   Chapter 8  When you are done, you need to save the PO file. The usual practice is to use the POT  filename and a language code. If our POT file was PostTypes.pot, we would name, for  example, the Serbian translation  language code sr_RS  of the file, PostTypes-sr_RS.po.  When you save the PO file, the MO file will be automatically generated.  What just happened? We have created a language translation file that our plugin can automatically use when it  detects a WordPress blog in that language.  You will notice that we use the language code. This matches the installation language of  WordPress and is retrieved using the get_locale   function in our WordPress plugin.  Some of these codes are:          fr_FR: French de_DE: German es_ES: Spanish zh_CN: Chinese  You can view the list of all the language codes at theWordPress Codex page   http:  codex.wordpress.org WordPress_in_Your_Language.  Updating translation When a new version of the plugin is released, the translation file needs to be updated. To do  that, you can follow these steps:  1. 2.  3. 4.  Using Poedit, open your translated PO file  for example PostTypes-sr_RS.po . Select the Update from POT file... option in the Catalog menu. Now select the POT  file that had previously been updated to a new version. Poedit will show you what is new, and what is not used anymore. When you are done translating, save the PO file again.  Normally, if you supply the POT file with your plugin, users will start sending you the  translations. It is a good practice to mention and thank these users in your plugin   credits sections.

Some plugin authors, in a hurry to release their plugin, may choose to skip this step, resulting  in poor or inadequately prepared 'readme' files. This is bad practice because usually the  success of the plugin greatly depends on the available documentation.  Plugin readme file To prepare documentation for the public release of a plugin, you need to complete two steps.   1. 2.  Create a plugin readme.txt file. Prepare a page on your site  if you do not have a site you can use the WordPress  plugin repository instead—we will discuss this later .   The readme.txt file is a standardized text file describing the plugin functionality,  installation and usage manual.   The contents of a readme.txt file are automatically parsed by the WordPress plugin  repository to display a plugin information page that looks like this one:  [ 250 ]   Chapter 8  Time for action – Create a sample plugin readme.txt file Let's create an example readme.txt file for the Insights plugin.  1.  First comes the general information section. This section contains general  information on the plugin such as the name, author, tags, version information   and a donation link. === Insights === Contributors: freediver Donate link: https:  www.networkforgood.org donation MakeDonation.                aspx?ORGID2=520781390          video, play, media, Post, posts        Requires at least: 2.3 Tested up to: 2.6.2 Stable tag: trunk  Tags:  admin, posts, images, links, google, ajax, jquery, youtube,    Insights allows you to quickly access and insert information              links, images, videos, maps..  into your blog posts.

We have created a properly formed readme.txt file for the plugin, which not only helps the  users who downloaded your plugin, but is also required if you want to host your plugin at the  WordPress plugin repository.  Sections of readme.txt The readme file can contain several sections encapsulated in the == characters. These  sections are recognized by the plugin repository and are used for creating sections on the  plugin information page automatically. The sections are:            Plugin name and information  Description Installation Credits Screenshot  [ 253 ]                           Development Goodies  License Frequently Asked Questions Any arbitrary section, these will be displayed after the recognized sections  General information The first section is used to describe general plugin information. It contains important data  about the plugin:  Contributors: This shows the user names of authors in the repository Donate link: This can be used used for collecting donations for your work Tags: It is a list of descriptive tags about your plugin Requires at least: Displays the minimum WordPress version required Tested up to: Indicates the latest version of WordPress with which the plugin has   been tested Stable tag: SVN tag are used for the stable version; use of trunk    will be explained later   Special codes The plugin repository allows you to use several special codes in the readme file text. They are:   For highlighting text, you could place it between wildcards  example 'this is  *important*'  or double wildcards  'this is **very important**'  If you want to create a list, use a wildcard at the beginning of each new line.  Example:  * Item 1 * Item 2  To create links, use the [link text] link URL  format. For example:  [WordPress] http:  www.wordpress.org   Screenshots The repository also searches for files named screenshot-1.png, screenshot-2.png  n  your plugin root folder and displays them in the Screenshots section.   To add descriptions for the screenshots, simply create a list in the Screenshots sections of  the readme file.  == Screenshots ==  1. Searching images on Flickr and adding them  [ 254 ]   Chapter 8  2. Searching Youtube videos, add to post 3. Adding a Google Map! 4. Using Wikipedia 5. Searching my Blog and linking to a post  Installation instructions The installation section should contain the information necessary to install and run the  plugin. Consider updating your installation section as you become aware of the problems  your users may be experiencing.  Even if the plugin is simple, this section should still have basic installation instructions   such as:  1. Upload the whole plugin folder to your  wp-content plugins  folder. 2. Go to the 'Plugins' page in the menu and activate the plugin. 3. Use the 'Options' page to change your plugin options.  Keeping the installation and usage instructions up-to-date will save you a lot of  time in addressing support questions!  Quick reference readme.txt template: http:  wordpress.org extend plugins  about readme.txt Readme validator: Use this to validate your readme file before submitting.  http:  wordpress.org extend plugins about validator    Plugin homepage The plugin page is an important part of promoting your plugin as well as giving the users  necessary information. This is the page you would usually link from the plugin header. You  should make sure it is descriptive and well written. If you've made good effort to prepare the  readme.txt file, you will find it much easier to create this page.   You can usually copy over most of the text from the readme file, and you will have all the  screenshots ready for uploading to your post.  [ 255 ]   Development Goodies  Useful plugin page tips Include the large Download link or button, and make it visible immediately.  Many users will come to the plugin page simply to download it. It would be good if the download link pointed to the file in the   WordPress repository. If your plugin needs explicit installation and usage instructions, make sure you  include them on the page  and keep them updated . Includ  a Change log section which lists changes in the plugin through   the versions.  After you publish a new version, it would probably be a good idea to write a blog  post about it and add a comment with version changes to the comments on the  plugin page.  [ 256 ]   Providing support Thanks to the huge WordPress user base, your plugin will typically be downloaded at least  a few hundred or or perhaps even thousands of times. If your plugin gets popular, you can  expect tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of downloads.  Chapter 8  When you have thousands of people downloading the plugin, be prepared to have hundreds  coming to your site and asking questions.   Most users will first look for answers in the readme.txt file or your plugin page, before  they send a direct question. So, it is important to have these files prepared well.  [ 257 ]   Development Goodies  Useful support tips Make sure you create good documentation. This small investment in time will  return itself many times over in the long run. When you answer a particular support question, consider adding it to the FAQ  part of the readme.txt file if you think that can help other users as well. Try to engage users to help each other out. Users have a tendency to discover  things by themselves, and they love to share it - make sure you encourage it. This  will save your own time later. If a user reports an error in the plugin, try to fix it and update the plugin as soon  as possible, especially if it is a security related problem. No matter how hard you try, there will always be users who have never read  your readme file or the plugin page and have come straight with a question.  Don't get mad at them. If the plugin becomes very popular and the comment system is not enough to  cover all issues, you may consider opening a support forum. There are several  forum plugins for WordPress  bbPress, SimplePress, and so on  and also stand  alone solutions  SMF, Vanilla, and so on.  that can be integrated with WordPress.  Code management and plugin repository  WordPress provides a free home for any plugin at the WordPress Plugin Directory, found  at http:  wordpress.org extend plugins . It simply represents a frontend to the  WordPress SVN repository found at wp-plugins.org.  Subversion  also known as SVN  is software that allows you to easily store and manage your  plugin projects  you can find a SVN FAQ at http:  subversion.tigris.org faq.html .  Once in the WordPress SVN, everyone will be able to check out  download  a copy of your  plugin, but only you, as a plugin author, will have the ability to commit changes to the plugin  in the repository.  Requesting repository access In order to gain write access to the repository, you need to fill out the Request form found at  http:  wordpress.org extend plugins add .  [ 25 ]   You will need to provide:  1. 2. 3.  A plugin name A short description An URL to the plugin homepage  Chapter 8  The access will usually be granted in a couple of days, and the best way to use the time   while you wait is to polish your readme.txt file. Prepare the screenshots, and tweak the  plugin page.  Using SVN Once your request has been approved, you will get an email with the details for accessing  your repository. For example, it may be: http:  svn.wp-plugins.org wp-wall.  To access it, you need to use SVN. There are various SVN frontends, but no matter which one  you use, the procedure for setting up your plugin for the first time is the same. The following  example uses the TortoiseSVN client for Windows  http:  tortoisesvn.tigris.org .  [ 25 ]   Development Goodies  Time for action - Manage a local repository using SVN  1.  2.  Create a directory where your local copy of the plugin will be stored, for example,  D:\plugins\wp-wall. Then perform the action—checkout from the repository  right-click the folder and  select the SVN Checkout . You need to type in the URL that you received when  repository access was granted for your plugin.  3.  When you perform a checkout, you will have three empty folders: trunk,   branches, and tags. Copy your plugin files to the trunk folder  for example, you  now have trunk wp-wall.php .  4.  Cr at  a n w fold r  n tags, for example, 0.1  your initial plugin version , and copy   the plugin files there as well.  5.  Commit the changes to the repository  for example, right-click and select    SVN Commit… .  [ 260 ]   Chapter 8  What just happened? First, we created a local copy of the repository using SVN checkout. This copies the necessary  file structure to your disk. Note that you can also use SVN checkout later, if for example, you  lost the files, or you want to update a plugin from a different computer.  Next, we moved our plugin files to the trunk folder. When you download a plugin from  WordPress.org, you will get the archived contents of the trunk folder. We have also copied  our files to the 0.1 folder in the tags folder  we have 'tagged' our versions . This allows us to  revert to a previous version at a later time.  Finally, we commited our plugin to the repository, and soon, it will be publically available for  download at www.WordPress.org!  Tagging a new version When you create a new version of the plugin, the process is similar.  1. 2.  3.  Make sure you changed the version number in your main PHP file. Cr at  a n w fold r und r tags, for example 0.2, and copy your plugin files from  the trunk folder. If you are on Windows, every folder under trunk  will have .svn  folders. You should not copy them. Commit the changes for all the files.  [ 261 ]   Development Goodies  Using WordPress development SVN WordPress core is developed using SVN. This means that you can also at anytime checkout  the latest development version. This allows you to see what is going on under the hood, for  example, to test your plugins before a new version of WordPress is officially released.  The fastest way to do this is to have a development version of WordPress running on your  local computer. On Linux and Mac OS, this should not be a big problem, and Windows users  can use packages such as EasyPHP  http:  www.easyphp.org  to set up the PHP MySQL  development environment.  You can even have a development version on a shared web hosting account, as many web  hosting companies allow SSH Secure Shell  or jailed SSH access to your account  you may  want to inquire with your hosting provider about this .  Once you have a Unix-like shell available, you can check out the latest Wordpress build using  the following commands:  $ mkdir devwp  $ cd devwp  $ svn co http:  svn.automattic.com wordpress trunk  .  To check out a specific version, you would use:  $ svn co http:  svn.automattic.com wordpress tags 2.5.1.  Web based SVN packages such as PHPSVNClient  http:  code.google. com p phpsvnclient   could allow you to check out the latest version of  WordPress to your site, even if you do not have shell access to your server.  Local copy of plugin repository Just like you can check out WordPress core, you are also free to check out the entire  WordPress plugin repository.  [ 262 ]   Chapter 8  Be warned that this may take quite a while.  The advantage of having a local copy of the plugin repository is to easily search through   all plugins when you need a reference to a function or an idea on how to create   certain functionalities.

[ 263 ]   Development Goodies  We have already covered how to host the plugin in the WordPress Plugin Directory, which  is the most important first step in plugin promotion. But there are some other interesting  places to visit as well.  Plugin promotion checklist  1.  Head to the WordPress Plugins and Hacks forums    http:  wordpress.org support forum 10 .  Create a new topic, for example, [New plugin: Insights].  2. 3.  Use a simple but informative template to describe your plugin release.                Plugin Name: Insights  Plugin URL: http:  www.prelovac.com vladimir wordpress-plugins  insights  Description: Insights brings a powerful new way to write your blog   posts. It increases productivity and at the same time the appeal   of your posts.  4.  Visit the Weblog Tools Collection forum  http:  weblogtoolscollection.  com news forum new-wordpress-plugins  and create a topic there as well,  using the same template. After guys from the Weblog Tools Collection site review  the topic, it should be added to their regular plugin news post, which appears on the  dashboard of every WordPress user.  5.  Add your plugin to http:  wp-plugins.net. This is another place where users   will look for a plugin.  6.  Add your plugin to the WordPress Plugin Compatibility list  http:  codex.  wordpress.org Plugins Plugin_Compatibility . You need to register  before you can add changes to the list.  7.  Announce the plugin on your blog.  These steps will almost guarantee that you get enough downloads, feedbacks, reviews, and  support questions.  General plugin development guidelines  WordPress does not enforce any strict rules on plugins, and plugins have complete control  over the WordPress web site. It is important to understand this and underline security and  performance implications if plugins do not follow general good behaviour guidelines.  [ 264 ]                 Chapter 8  Security Exploits such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Request Forgery  CSRF  may pose serious security  threat to the users of your plugin, if particular care is not taken.  WordPress provides simple mechanisms to prevent these threats.  $wpdb->prepare  , $wpdb->insert  , $wpdb->update  : These are  database functions that should be used for creating database queries and inserting  updating the information. wp_nonce_url  : This function is used for links, and wp_nonce_field   is a  function used for forms in combination with check_admin_referer   check_ ajax_referer   that will protect your requests against CSRF.  Performance If you not careful, plugins can sometimes create serious overhead issues and affect the  performance of the entire site. Therefore, it is important to follow general performance  guidelines and these tips:  Take care of the number of your MySQL queries. If you need to use several  complicated queries, you can use built-in WordPress cache  which we covered   in Chapter 4 . To enable caching, add this line to the WordPress wp-config.php file:       define 'WP_CACHE', true ;  Loading plugin localization data only when necessary  as shown in Chapter 7  is  another performance improvement. The same goes for JavaScript usage—load the scripts only on those pages where  your plugin needs them. In Chapter 7, we also covered how to hook to actions and filters only on those pages  where your plugin needs them. That way, we do not add a burden to the WordPress  engine when they are not needed. Generally optimization means to use only those resources that are required to do  the job.  Re-using resources The best WordPress plugins will try to make the most most of the functions provided   by WordPress.  By using WordPress functions for handling uploaded files, storing posts or displaying  information, you are making sure your code works properly in all the future WordPress  versions. The best thing about all this is that you will get a free ride on all future upgrades to  that functionality.  [ 265 ]   Development Goodies  An example of this is the way we used WordPress comment system to handle shouts on the  wall for the WP Wall plugin.  In case you need to save simple data in the database, you can re-use the WordPress options  table which is capable of storing almost any kind of information.  Keeping API up-to-date          WordPress is still in rapid development, and API functions change with each   new version.  Make sure you always use the latest API functions. To help you find any deprecated functions and include the files that you may have  used, WordPress provides two action hooks:      deprecated_function_run $oldfunction, $newfunction      deprecated_file_included $oldfile, $newfile   In order to use them, you need to set the WP_DEBUG global variable in   wp-config.php:      define 'WP_DEBUG', true ;  These two hooks will allow you to discover deprecated code and make your plugin much  more resilient to future WordPress upgrades.

It allows you to run many blogs from a single installation of the WordPress   MU software.  [ 266 ]   The WordPress MU homepage is located at http:  mu.wordpress.org, and from here,  you can access the latest version.  Chapter 8  Although, WordPress MU re-uses 90% of the WordPress code, there are some   differences between the two, mainly due to the fact that MU is meant to host multiple   blogs simultaneously.  For example, if you were creating an XML sitemap plugin for normal WordPress, and created  the file by default in the root of the blog, it would not work on MU, as each blog would be  overwriting the sitemap every time it was generated.  Other differences come from the fact that WordPress MU is not always updated at the same  time with WordPress. So if you use new features and API functions available in the latest  version of WordPress, they may not work in the latest version of WordPress MU; that's  something to keep your eye on.  [ 267 ]   Development Goodies  Finally, WordPress MU supports additional API functions and global variables mainly used   to support the multiple blog MU environment. Find more about them at this address:  http:  codex.wordpress.org WPMU_Functions  If you want to make sure your plugin is compatible with WordPress MU, the best thing to do  is to have a local version of MU installed as a testing ground.  Quick reference WordPress MU: http:  mu.wordpress.org Codex for WordPress MU: http:  codex.wordpress.org  WordPressMU Exclusive WPMU functions: http:  codex.wordpress.org WPMU_ Functions Exclusive WPMU variables: http:  codex.wordpress.org WPMU_ Global_Variables  WordPress and GPL  WordPress is licensed under GNU General Public License  GPL , which has several  implications to your plugins.  The most important one is that plugin code using WordPress functions automatically  becomes GPL as well. This still means you can sell your plugins. But it also means that  anyone who buys it or downloads it from the Internet is free to modify it and even resell it  without asking for your permission.  A commercially oriented approach to plugin development is still possible, as most clients will  be interested in a long-term relationship, with support and plugin updates included.  Technically speaking, there might be a way to license your code differently if you created it in  the following way:  1. 2.  Write most of your code as a library, without any WordPress calls. Create a WordPress plugin that will call the functions from your library.  This way, only the WordPress plugin becomes GPL, and you can license the library separately.  The GPL license is still subject to many different interpretations, even by its creators; so make  sure you consult the latest GPL FAQ  http:  www.gnu.org licenses gpl-faq.html   for all your questions.
