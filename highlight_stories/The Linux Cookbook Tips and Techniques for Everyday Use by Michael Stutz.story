But what some may not know is that the free software movement, of which Linux is a part, is very much a counter−cultural phenomenon: the design by which it is produced and published is contrary to the notions of proprietary, intellectual "property" that have dominated mainstream culture so long. While some programmers turn their research into corporate−backed software that you cannot openly change, share, or examine  but only purchase and run on your system , Linux and other free software is the product of many individuals who courageously published and shared their research and work openly, for everyone to benefit from.  I wrote this book because I want everyone to know how to use this software, because I think everyone deserves the freedom that comes with it. I don't willingly use proprietary software−−not because it is always inferior to free software, but because its use precludes freedoms that I find I cannot exist without ... freedoms that should be everyone's right by default in a free, open society.  See Introduction.   I know that Linux isn't difficult to use, especially when compared with other software and operating systems, but what was needed was a guide to show people how to use it to get things done: "Oh, you want to do that? Here, type this."  That explains the premise of the book−−it's a hands−on guide to getting things done on a Linux system, designed for the everyday user who is not necessarily a computer programmer.  The traditional approach to the subject is to either provide laundry lists of all available commands and applications, or focus on their use in a programming or otherwise technical environment. This book takes a different approach, showing how everyday users−−be they artists, designers, businessmen, scholars, or scientists−−can use these tools and applications to get things done. When I speak of "things," I mean  hopefully  the kind of things that you−−the sort of person possibly and partially described above−−might want to do with a modern computer system: view text and images, play and record sounds, perform mathematic operations, print to your printer, format text, access the Internet, check your grammar, and so forth.  Like a culinary cookbook, this book presents "recipes" for preparing or accomplishing a particular, specific thing. I've selected what I consider to be the easiest and most effective methods for accomplishing particular tasks, and have arranged these recipes in general sections according to subject matter−−the first part of the book is all about getting started, and contains the most essential information you need to know about using Linux; the remaining chapters deal with general categories of usage: Files, Text, Images, Sound, Productivity, and Networking.  1.0 Format of Recipes 1.1 Assumptions, Scope, and Exclusions 1.2 Typographical Conventions 1.3 Versions, Latest Edition, and Errata 1.4 Acknowledgments     Organization of recipes.

These figures are constructed as follows: the first number always corresponds to the chapter number, and the second to the section of the recipe. For example, Chapter 3 is The Shell, and Recipe No. 3.5 is the fifth recipe on shells, Recording a Shell Session.  Sometimes recipes are divided into subsections, with a third number specifying the specific recipe−−for example, Recipe No. 3.4 is on the subject of command history in the shell, and is divided further into subsections; Recipe No. 3.4.2 is the second recipe on command history, Specifying a Command from Your History.  Each recipe describes a method for completing a specific task on the system; these tasks require at least one software program. The software programs or files a recipe calls for are its ingredients.  The recipes are structured as follows:  1. Recipe number and title of the recipe.  2. Special ingredients, if any. The Debian package s  and or or URLs where the program s  can be  obtained are listed, if they are available.  Debian classifies packages in varying level of importance, from `required' packages that all systems must have in order to run, to `optional' and `extra' packages that you only install if you want them. If a described software package is in the first two given categories−−−`required' and `important'−−−then I assume you have it installed, and the package name isn't listed here.  In the rare case that a software package I describe is not yet available as a Debian package, I just give the URL where to obtain the source packages for that software; have your system administrator install it.  3. Special preparation methods or description, if any. When a configurable program is described, the standard setup as provided by the Debian distribution is assumed, unless otherwise specified here.  4. Description of the recipe and "cooking" method proper.  5. Remarks concerning the results and use.  6. Bulleted example of the method in a specific context.  7. Extra commands or actions you might want to do next.  8. Variations on the recipe, with additional examples.   Preface   4   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   9.

The Cookbook assumes that you have at least minimal understanding of your computer hardware−−you don't have to know how to take it apart or anything like that, but you ought to know how to operate the mouse, where the power button is on your computer and monitor, how to load paper in your printer, and so forth. If you need help with any of these tasks or concepts, ask your dealer or the party who set up your computer.  This book also assumes that you have Linux installed and properly set up, and that you have your own user account set up on your system. If you need help with this, please see If You Need More Help.  While this book can and should be used by the newcomer to Linux, I like to think that I've presented broad enough coverage of the Linux−based system, and have included enough interesting or obscure material, so that wizards, hackers, and members of the Linux Cabal may find some of it useful−−and that said users will not feel ashamed to have a copy of this book on their desk or as part of their library.  Finally, a note about what isn't covered in the Cookbook.  This book describes only free software  sometimes called "open source" software  that runs on Linux systems. 1  Proprietary software is omitted, as are most software packages that are currently in a "beta" or some other unstable release not yet intended for general use.  Some programs take a number of options that modify the way they work. Sometimes, various options that a tool takes are listed in a table. These lists are not exhaustive; rather, they contain the most popular or useful options, or those options that are relevant to the discussion at hand. Consult the online manual page of a particular tool for the complete listing  see section Reading a Page from the System Manual .  This is a user manual; no computer programming activities, such as program compilation, are discussed. Topics related to system administration are also omitted−−so you won't find anything in this text on matters such as managing accounts, system maintenance, setting up hardware, and configuring networks.  As with any rule, you can find an exception to this−−if you look hard enough for it. If you are running Linux on your home computer as a single−user system, you are also the administrator of this system, and are the responsible party for ensuring that any administrative tasks be completed; Administrative Issues exists as a reference for those users who will be administrating their own systems.

The text that describes what the example does appears just before the example itself, and is offset from the text with a bullet, like this.    A given recipe may have several variations; each is offset with its own bullet.    The names of documents or users that are used in some recipes may not always reference actual documents or users on your system, but demonstrate the general principles involved. So when I show how to print a file called `resume', you might not necessarily have a file with that name on your system, but you should understand the idea which the recipe demonstrates.  Sometimes, a terminal screen is shown to illustrate an interactive session:  $ Text that you actually type is displayed in a slanted font, like this. If it is a command to be typed at a shell prompt, the command is preceded with a `$' character.   Text that denotes program output is displayed in a monospaced Courier font like this.      $  In examples where a shell prompt is displayed, the default current working directory is omitted in the prompt and just a `$' is used; when a command outputs text and then exits, the last line of an example contains a `$' character to denote the return to a shell prompt. Don't worry if this sounds strange to you now; all of this "shell" business is explained in The Shell.  When a command exits and returns to the shell prompt without outputting text, the final shell prompt character is omitted, and a cartouche border is not drawn around the example; this was purely an aesthetic decision.  The names of files or directories appear in the text as `file'; commands appear as command, and strings of text are typeset like `some text'. GNU INFO BUG: Note that the differences in fonts and appearance are mostly lost in the Info version.  Text you type is written like this, just as in the examples, and when a specific key on the keyboard is mentioned, its conventional name is displayed in a box. For example, RET denotes the `Return' key on the keyboard. 2   In examples where keys are meant to be pressed and held down together, the keys are separated by hyphens; the hyphens are not meant to be literally pressed. For example, pressing the CTRL, ALT, and DEL keys and holding them down at the same time is a combination that has meaning in some operating systems  including Linux, where this keystroke means to shut down the system and reboot the computer ; it is represented like this:   Preface   6   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     CTRL−ALT−DEL  The CTRL  `Control'  key is always used in combination with another key; these combinations are denoted by C−x, where x is the second key. These combinations are read as `control−x', where x is the name of the second key. To type one of these combinations, press and hold CTRL, press the second key, and then release both keys.    For example, to type C−d  pronounced `control d' , press and hold CTRL, type the D key, and then release both keys.  In some applications  notably, the Emacs editor; see section Emacs , the META key is used with another key, in the same way as SHIFT; these combinations are denoted by M−x, where x is the second key. Most keyboards today don't have a META key, even though the term is still in use; instead, press and release ESC, and then type the second key.    To type M−c, press and release ESC, and then press and release the C key.  You can sometimes also use the ALT key for the META key. This often does not work in the X Window System, but in the console you can press and hold ALT and then type the second key just as you would with a CTRL key sequence.    So to type M−c with the ALT key, press and hold ALT, press the C key, and then release both keys.  Both CTRL and META sequences are not case−sensitive; that is, pressing X in the last example is the same as pressing x  although x is certainly easier to type . By convention, the C− or M− prefix is always given as an uppercase letter, and the key which follows is always given as a lowercase letter.  Menu items in an application are written like Menu Item; the names of command functions are written as Function.  For aesthetic purposes, a physical space appears in the text between commands and the final RET that ends a command line, and should not be literally typed  although nothing bad will happen should you actually type this space . Where explicitly pressing the space bar is called for, that key is represented in examples by SPC.

Conception, took but an idle moment−−but once the idea had been implanted, I found resistance and setbacks at every turn. It was only through the help of the following individuals that this book with my name on its cover was finally brought forth, and has now found its way to you.  Everyone involved with this book at No Starch Press deserves a hearty round of thanks. Bill Pollock has published this book precisely according to its author's vision, and had the discernment and foresight to allow that a copylefted edition  with corresponding source data  be made available in conjunction with the hardcopy book. Project manager Karol Jurado worked ceaselessly to keep the production flowing, while dealing with my input files, and giving opinion and advice on all manners of obtuse esoterica whenever the sudden need to know came over me. Both Elisabeth Beller and Andy Carroll contributed improvements to the text.  Steve Turner and the National Writers Union played a major role in helping to ensure that this book could be completed, copylefted, and in the hands of Linux users like yourself. Carol Cricow gave invaluable legal assistance, and various advice and assistance came from the NWU's JoAnn Kawell, Philip Mattera, Judy Heim, and Bonnie Britt.  Wendy Seltzer, Fellow, The Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School assisted with the conception of the Design Science License  DSL , which is used in this book. She gave an initial review of the license draft and provided her expertise and advice throughout the entire process.  Thanks to David Sims, Chris Coleman, and Terrie Schweitzer, who've all been great folks to work with at the O'Reilly Network, where my "Living Linux" column runs.  I am indebted to Buwei Yang Chao, whose How To Cook and Eat In Chinese  John Day Company, 1945  served as much of the inspiration behind the tone and structure of this book. I feel the same regard for two other authors who have come before me, and whose work has had a direct influence in the writing of this book−−Dr. Lee Su Jan  The Fine Art of Chinese Cooking, Gramercy Publishing 1962  and Andrew Walker  The UNIX Environment, Wiley 1984 .  Thanks also go out to Kenneth W. Melvin, and to the members of the "Byline" forum on the WELL; both were sources of advice and feedback early in the project. The art−hackers of the linart mailing list entertained initial discussion of the idea of this book as it first occurred, and the "elders" Ann and Walt gave various support for which I am grateful.  Finally, I must thank Jack Angelotta, Jon Konrath, Steven Snedker, and mrs  Marie Stutz , who all listened to the unbelievable as it happened, and stood by−−even in moments of terror.

Or at least it was an operating system; the original system known as Unix proper is not the "Unix" we know and use today; there are now many   2. Introduction   11   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   "flavors" of Unix, of which Linux has become the most popular.  A product of the 1960s, Unix and its related software was invented by Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan, and other hackers at Bell Labs in 1969; its name was a play on "Multics," another operating system of the time. 3   In the early days of Unix, any interested party who had the hardware to run it on could get a tape of the software from Bell Labs, with printed manuals, for a very nominal charge.  This was before the era of personal computing, and in practice, mostly only universities and research laboratories did this . Local sites played with the software's source code, extending and customizing the system to their needs and liking.  Beginning in the late 1970s, computer scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, a licensee of the Unix source code, had been making their own improvements and enhancements to the Unix source during the course of their research, which included the development of TCP IP networking. Their work became known as the BSD  "Berkeley Systems Distribution"  flavor of Unix.  The source code of their work was made publicly available under licensing that permitted redistribution, with source or without, provided that Berkeley was credited for their portions of the code. There are many modern variants of the original BSD still actively developed today, and some of them−−such as NetBSD and OpenBSD−−can run on personal computers.  NOTE: The uppercase word `UNIX' became a trademark of AT&T  since transferred to other organizations , to mean their particular operating system. But today, when people say "Unix," they usually mean "a Unix−like operating system," a generalization that includes Linux.  If you'd like further information on this topic, you might be interested in consulting A Quarter Century of UNIX by Peter H. Salus  Addison−Wesley 1994 , which has become the standard text on the subject.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   2.1.2 What's Free Software?  @sf{WWW}: http:  www.gnu.org philosophy free−sw.html  Over the years, Unix's popularity grew. After the divestiture of AT&T, the tapes of the source code that Bell Labs provided became a proprietary, commercial product: AT&T UNIX. But it was expensive, and didn't come with the source code that made it tick. Even if you paid extra for a copy of the sources, you couldn't share with your programmer colleagues any improvements or discoveries you made.  By the early 1980s, proprietary software development, by only−for−profit corporations, was quickly becoming the norm−−even at universities. More software was being distributed without source code than ever before.  In 1984, while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, hacker Richard Stallman saw his colleagues gradually accept and move to this proprietary development model. He did not accept the kind of world such proprietism would offer: no sharing your findings with your fellow man, no freedom for anyone to take a look "under the hood" of a published work to see how it worked so that one could understand it or build upon it; it would mean no freedom to improve your copy of such works, or do   2. Introduction   12   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   what you please with your copy−−including share it with others.  So instead of giving in to the world of non−free computing, Stallman decided to start a project to build and assemble a new Unix−like operating system from scratch, and make its source code free for anyone to copy and modify. This was the GNU Project  "GNU's Not Unix" . 4   The GNU Project's software would be licensed in such a way so that everyone was given the freedom to copy, distribute, and modify their copy of the software; as a result, this kind of software became known as free software.  Individuals and businesses may charge for free software, but anyone is free to share copies with their neighbors, change it, or look at its source code to see how it works. There are no secrets in free software; it's software that gives all of its users the freedom they deserve.  Proprietary software strictly limits these freedoms−−in accordance with copyright law, which was formulated in an age when works were normally set and manipulated in physical form, and not as non−physical data, which is what computers copy and modify.  Free software licensing was developed as a way to work around the failings of copyright law, by permitting anyone to copy and modify a work, though under certain strict terms and conditions. The GNU Project's GNU General Public License, or GNU GPL, is the most widely used of all free software licenses. Popularly called a "copyleft," it permits anyone to copy or modify any software released under its terms−−provided all derivatives or modifications are released under the same terms, and all changes are documented.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   2.1.3 What's Open Source?  @sf{WWW}: http:  www.opensource.org  @sf{WWW}: http:  www.gnu.org philosophy free−software−for−freedom.html  The term open source was first introduced by some free software hackers in 1998 to be a marketing term for "free software." They felt that some people unfamiliar with the free software movement−−namely, large corporations, who'd suddenly taken an interest in the more than ten years' worth of work that had been put into it−−might be scared by the word "free." They were concerned that decision−makers in these corporations might confuse free software with things like freeware, which is software provided free of charge, and in executable form only.  Free software means nothing of the sort, of course; the "free" in "free software" has always referred to freedom, not price.   The Open Source Initiative  OSI  was founded to promote software that conforms with their public "Open Source Definition," which was derived from the "Debian Free Software Guidelines"  DFSG , originally written by Bruce Perens as a set of software inclusion guidelines for Debian. All free software−−including software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License−−conforms with this definition.  But some free software advocates and organizations, including the GNU Project, do not endorse the term "open source" at all, believing that it obscures the importance of "freedom" in this movement. 5   Whether you call it free software, open source software, or something else, there is one fundamental   2. Introduction   13   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   difference between this kind of software and proprietary, non−free software−−and that is that free software always ensures that everyone is granted certain fundamental freedoms with respect to that software.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   2.1.4 What's Linux?  In the early 1990s, Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds began hacking on Minix, a small, Unix−like operating system for personal computers then used in college operating systems courses. 6  He decided to improve the main software component underlying Minix, called the kernel, by writing his own.  The kernel is the central component of any Unix−like operating system.   In late 1991, Torvalds published the first version of this kernel on the Internet, calling it "Linux"  a play on both Minix and his own name . 7   When Torvalds published Linux, he used the copyleft software license published by the GNU Project, the GNU General Public License. Doing so made his software free to use, copy, and modify by anyone−−provided any copies or variations were kept equally free. Torvalds also invited contributions by other programmers, and these contributions came; slowly at first but, as the Internet grew, thousands of hackers and programmers from around the globe contributed to his free software project. The Linux software was immensely extended and improved so that the Linux−based system of today is a complete, modern operating system, which can be used by programmers and non−programmers alike; hence this book.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   2.1.5 What's Debian?  @sf{WWW}: http:  debian.org   It takes more than individual software programs to make something that we can use on our computers−−someone has to put it all together. It takes time to assemble the pieces into a cohesive, usable collection, and test it all, and then keep up to date with the new developments of each piece of software  a small change in any one of which may introduce a new software dependency problem or conflict with the rest . A Linux distribution is such an assemblage. You can do it yourself, of course, and "roll your own" distribution−−since it's all free software, anyone can add to it or remove from it and call the resulting concoction their own. Most people, however, choose to leave the distribution business to the experts.  For the purposes of this book, I will assume that you are using the Debian GNU Linux distribution, which, of all the major distributions, is the only one designed and assembled in the same manner that the Linux kernel and most other free software is written−−by individuals.  And when I say "Linux" anywhere in this book  including in the title , unless noted, I am not referring to the bare kernel itself, but to the entire working free software system as a whole. Some people call this "GNU Linux." 8    2. Introduction   14   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   There are many other distributions, and some of them are quite acceptable−−many users swear by Red Hat Linux, for example, which is certainly popular, and reportedly easy to install. The SuSE distribution is very well−received in Europe. So when people speak of Debian, Red Hat, SuSE, and the like in terms of Linux, they're talking about the specific distribution of Linux and related software, as assembled and repackaged by these companies or organizations  see section Linux Resources on the Web . The core of the distributions are the same−−they're all the Linux kernel, the GNU Project software, and various other free software−−but each distribution has its own packaging schemes, defaults, and configuration methods. It is by no means wrong to install and use any of these other distributions, and every recipe in this book should work with all of them  with the exception of variations that are specific to Debian systems, and are labelled as such in the text .  In Debian's early days, it was referred to as the "hacker's distro," because it could be very difficult for a newbie to install and manage. However, that has changed−−any Linux newbie can install and use today's Debian painlessly.  NOTE: I recommend Debian because it is non−corporate, openly developed, robust  the standard Debian CD−ROM set comes with more than 2,500 different software packages! , and it is entirely committed to free software by design  yes, there are distributions which are not .

A dip in these inviting waters will help clarify the rôle of this book as "cookbook."  The fact that the Unix operating system has survived for more than thirty years should tell us something about the temerity of its design considerations. One of these considerations−−perhaps its most endearing−−is the "tools" philosophy.  Most operating systems are designed with a concept of files, come with a set of utility programs for handling these files, and then leave it to the large applications to do the interesting work: a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation designer, a Web browser.  When a few of these applications recognize each other's file formats, or share a common interface, the group of applications is called a "suite."   Each of these monolithic applications presumably has an "open file" command to read a file from disk and open it in the application; most of them, too, come with commands for searching and replacing text, checking spelling, printing the current document, and so on. The program source code for handling all of these tasks must be accounted for separately, inside each application−−taking up extra space both in memory and on disk. This is the anti−Unix approach.  And in the case of proprietary software, all of the actual program source code is kept from the public−−so other programmers can't use, build on, or learn from any of it. This kind of closed−source software is presented to the world as a kind of magic trick: if you buy a copy of the program, you may use it, but you can never learn how the program actually works.   2. Introduction   15   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   The result of this is that the code to handle essentially the same function inside all of these different applications must be developed by programmers from scratch, separately and independently of the others each time−−so the progress of society as a whole is set back by the countless man−hours of time and energy programmers must waste by inefficiently reinventing all the same software functions to perform the same tasks, over and over again.  Unix−like operating systems don't put so much weight on application programs. Instead, they come with many small programs called tools. Each tool is generally capable of performing a very simple, specific task, and performing it well−−one tool does nothing but output the file s  or data passed to it, one tool spools its input to the print queue, one tool sorts the lines of its input, and so on.  An important early development in Unix was the invention of "pipes," a way to pass the output of one tool to the input of another. By knowing what the individual tools do and how they are combined, a user could now build powerful "strings" of commands.  Just as the tensile strength of steel is greater than the added strength of its components−−nickel, cadmium, and iron−−multiple tools could then be combined to perform a task unpredicted by the function of the individual tools. This is the concept of synergy, and it forms the basis of the Unix tools philosophy. 9   Here's an example, using two tools. The first tool, called who, outputs a list of users currently logged on to the system  see section Listing Who Is on the System . The second tool is called wc, which stands for "word count"; it outputs a count of the number of words  or lines or characters  of the input you give it  see section Counting Text .  By combining these two tools, giving the wc command the output of who, you can build a new command to list the number of users currently on the system:  $ who  wc −l RET         4 $        The output of who is piped−−via a "pipeline," specified by the vertical bar  `'  character−−to the input of wc, which through use of the `−l' option outputs the number of lines of its input.  In this example, the number 4 is shown, indicating that four users are currently logged on the system.  Incidentally, piping the output of who to wc in this fashion is a classic tools example, and was called "the most quoted pipe in the world" by Andrew Walker in The UNIX Environment, a book that was published in 1984.   Another famous pipeline from the days before spell−check tools goes something like this:  $ tr −cs A−Za−z '\012'  tr A−Z a−z  sort −u   comm −23 −  usr dict words RET  This command  typed all on one line  uses the tr, sort, and comm tools to make a spelling checker−−after you type this command, the lines of text you type  until you interrupt it  are converted to a single−column list of lowercase words with two calls of tr, sorted in alphabetical order while ferreting out all duplicates, the resultant list which is then compared with ` usr dict words', which is the system "dictionary," a list of properly−spelled words kept in alphabetical order  see section Spelling .   2. Introduction   16   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Collective sets of tools designed around a certain kind of field or concept were called "workbenches" on older Unix systems; for example, the tools for checking the spelling, writing style and grammar of their text input were part of the "Writer's Workbench" package  see section Checking Grammar .  Today the GNU Project publishes collections of tools under certain general themes, such as the "GNU text utilities" and "GNU file utilities," but the idea of "workbenches" is generally not part of the idiom of today's Unix−based systems. Needless to say, we still use all kinds of tools for all kinds of purposes; the great bulk of this book details various combinations of tools to obtain the desired results for various common tasks.  You'll find that there's usually one tool or command sequence that works perfectly for a given task, but sometimes a satisfactory or even identical result can be had by different combinations of different tools−−especially at the hands of a Unix expert.  Traditionally, such an expert was called a wizard.   Some tasks require more than one tool or command sequence. And yes, there are tasks that require more than what these simple craft or hand tools can provide. Some tasks need more industrial production techniques, which are currently provided for by the application programs. So we still haven't avoided applications entirely; at the turn of the millennium, Linux−based systems still have them, from editors to browsers. But our applications use open file formats, and we can use all of our tools on these data files.  The invention of new tools has been on the rise along with the increased popularity of Linux−based systems. At the time of this writing, there were a total of 1,190 tools in the two primary tool directories  ` bin' and ` usr bin'  on my Linux system. These tools, combined with necessary applications, make free, open source software−−for perhaps the first time in its history−−a complete, robust system for general use.

These are the basics.  Beginning Linux users should start with the concepts described in these first chapters. Once you've learned how to start power to the system and log in, you should look over the chapter on the shell, so that you are familiar with typing at the command prompt, and then read the chapter on the graphical windows interface called the X Window System, so that you can start X and run programs from there if you like.  If you are a Linux beginner and are anxious to get up to speed, you might want to skip ahead and read the chapter on files and directories next, to get a sense of what the system looks like and how to maneuver through it. Then, go on to learning how to view text, and how to edit it in an editor  respectively described in the chapters on viewing text and text editing . After this, explore the rest of the book as your needs and interests dictate.  So, to recapitulate, here is what I consider to be the essential material to absorb for familiarizing yourself with the basic usage of a Linux system:  1. Introduction  this current chapter .   2.

Try these steps for getting help:    Chances are good that you are not alone in your question, and that someone else has asked it before; therefore, the compendiums of "Frequently Asked Questions" just might have the answer you need: the Debian FAQ and the Linux FAQ.    The Linux Documentation Project is the center of the most complete and up−to−date Linux−related documentation available; see if there is a document related to the topic you need help with.    The Usenet newsgroups news:comp.os.linux.help and news:linux.debian.user are often an excellent place to discuss issues with other Linux users.  Usenet is described in Reading Usenet .    Check http:  linux.com lug  to find the Linux User Group  "LUG"  nearest you−−people involved with LUGs can be great sources of hands−on help, and it can be fun and rewarding to get involved with other Linux and free software enthusiasts in your local area.    Finally, you can hire a consultant. This may be a good option if you need work done right away and are willing to pay for it.  The Linux Consultants HOWTO is a list of consultants around the world who provide various support services for Linux and open source software in general  see section Reading System Documentation and Help Files . Consultants have various interests and areas of expertise, and they are listed in that document with contact information.   2.

What Every Linux User Knows  This chapter concerns those concepts and commands that every Linux user knows−−how to start and stop the system, log in and out from it, change your password, see what is happening on the system, and use the system help facilities. Mastery of these basic concepts is essential for using Linux with any degree of success.  Some of these recipes make reference to files and directories; these concepts are explained in Files and Directories.  3.1 Controlling Power to the System    How to start and stop the system. 3.2 Accounts and Privileges 3.3 Console Basics 3.4 Running a Command 3.5 Changing Your Password 3.6 Listing User Activity 3.7 Listing System Activity 3.8 Help Facilities     Using your account to access the system.

It's more than just pressing the button on the case; in particular, there is a right way to turn off the system, and doing it wrong can result in losing some of your work. Fortunately, there isn't any black magic involved, as we soon shall see−−properly shutting down the system is easy!  3.1.1 Powering Up the System    Booting up the system. 3.1.2 Turning Off the System    Turning off the system.

What Every Linux User Knows   20   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    3.1.1 Powering Up the System  The first thing you do to begin using the system is start power to it. To power up the system, just turn it on. This is called booting the system.  As the Linux kernel boots there will be many messages on the screen. After a while, the system will display a login: prompt. You can now log in. See section Logging In to the System.  Some systems are configured to start xdm at boot time  see section Starting X . If your system is configured like this, instead of the login: prompt described above, you'll see a graphical screen with a box in the middle containing both login: and Password: prompts. Type CTRL−ALT−F1 to switch to the first virtual console, where you can log in to the system in the usual way  see section Console Basics .  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.1.2 Turning Off the System  You can't just flip the power switch when you are done using the computer, because Linux is constantly writing data to disk.  It also keeps data in memory, even when it may have appeared to have written that data to disk.  Simply turning off the power could result in the loss or corruption of some of your work.  The following describes a method of turning off the system that can be done by a normal user; the traditional way of shutting down can only be performed by the superuser, and is described in Shutting Down the System.  To turn off a single user system, first log out of all consoles  discussed in Console Basics . Then, type CTRL−ALT−DEL  press and hold these three keys at once . 10   The system will print some messages as it shuts down, and when you see the line, `Rebooting...', it's safe to turn the power to machine off.  NOTE: You don't want to wait too long after you see this message; if left untouched, the system will reboot and you'll be back to the beginning!  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.2 Accounts and Privileges  Linux is a multi−user system, meaning that many users can use one Linux system simultaneously, from different terminals. So to avoid confusion  and to maintain a semblance of privacy , each user's workspace must be kept separate from the others.  Even if a particular Linux system is a stand−alone personal computer with no other terminals physically   3. What Every Linux User Knows   21   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   connected to it, it can be shared by different people at different times, making the separation of user workspace still a valid issue.  This separation is accomplished by giving each individual user an account on the system. You need an account in order to use the system; with an account you are issued an individual workspace to use, and a unique username that identifies you to the system and to other users. It is the name that the system  and those who use it  will then forever know you as; it's a single word, in all lowercase letters.  During the installation process, the system administrator should have created an account for you.  The system administrator has a special account whose username is root; this account has total access to the entire system, so it is often called the superuser.   Until the mid−1990s it was widely common for usernames to be the first letter of your first name followed by your entire surname, up to 12 characters total. So for example, user Samuel Clemens would have a username of sclemens by this convention; this, however, is not a hard and fast rule, especially on home systems where you may be the only user. Sometimes, a middle initial may be used  "dkjohnson" , or sometimes even nicknames or initials are used  "zenboy," "xibo" . But whatever username you pick for yourself, make sure it's one you can live with, and one you can stand being called by both the system and other users  your username also becomes part of your email address, as we'll see in Email .  In addition to your username, you should also have a password that you can keep secret so that only you can use your account. Good passwords are strings of text that nobody else is likely to guess  i.e., not obvious words like `secret', or identifying names like `Ruski', if that happens to be your pet cat . A good password is one that is highly memorable to you so that you don't have to write it down, but is complex enough in construction so that anyone else couldn't ever guess it. For example, `t39sAH' might be a fine password for someone whose first date was to see the movie The 39 Steps directed by Alfred Hitchcock.  NOTE: While usernames are always in lowercase, passwords are case sensitive; the passwords `Secret', `secret', and `SECRET' are all considered different.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.2.1 Logging In to the System  To begin a session on a Linux system, you need to log in. Do this by entering your username at the login: prompt on your terminal, and then entering your password when asked.  The login: prompt appears on the terminal after the system boots. If your system is configured to start the X Window System at boot time, you'll be presented with an X login screen instead of the standard login prompt. If that happens, press CTRL−ALT−F1 to switch to the text login screen; this is explained further in Console Basics.   3. What Every Linux User Knows   22   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   A typical login: prompt looks like this:  Debian GNU Linux 2.2 bardo tty1  bardo login:  Every Linux system has its own name, called the system's hostname; a Linux system is sometimes called a host, and it identifies itself with its hostname at the login: prompt. It's important to name your system−−like a username for a user account, a hostname gives name to the system you are using  and it becomes especially important when putting the system on a network . The system administrator usually names the system when it is being initially configured  the hostname can always be changed later; its name is kept in the file ` etc hostname' . Like usernames, hostnames are one word in all lowercase letters. People usually give their system a name they like, such as darkstar or shiva.  In this example, `bardo' is the hostname of this particular Linux system.  The name of the terminal you are connecting from is displayed just after the hostname. In this example, the terminal is `tty1', which means that this is the first terminal on this particular system.  Incidentally, `tty' is short for "teletype," which historically was the kind of terminal hardware that most Unix−based systems used by default.   To log in to the system, type your username  followed by RET  at the login: prompt, and then type your password when asked  also followed by RET ; for security purposes, your password is not displayed on the screen when you type it.    To log in to the system with a username of `kurt' and a password of `empathy', type:        Debian GNU Linux 2.2 bardo tty1  bardo login: kurt RET Password: empathy RET Linux bardo 2.0.30 1 Tue Jul 29 10:01:26 EDT 1997 i586 unknown  Copyright  C  1993−1998 Software in the Public Interest, and others  Most of the programs included with the Debian Linux system are freely redistributable; the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the individual files in   usr doc * copyright  Debian GNU Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Last login: Tue Apr  5 12:03:47 on tty1. No mail. ~ $  Once you've entered your username and password, you are "logged in" to the system. You can then use the system and run commands.  As soon as you log in, the system displays the contents of ` etc motd', the "Message of the Day" file. The system then displays the time and date of your last login, and reports whether or not you have electronic   3. What Every Linux User Knows   23   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   mail waiting for you  see section Email . Finally, the system puts you in a shell−−−the environment in which you interact with the system and give it commands. Use of the default shell on most Linux systems, bash, is discussed in The Shell.  The dollar sign  `$'  displayed to the left of the cursor is called the shell prompt; it means that the system is ready and waiting for input.  You can change this prompt to any text of your liking; to learn how, see section Changing the Shell Prompt.  By default, the shell prompt includes the name of the current directory, which it places to the left of the `$' character. The tilde character  `~' , is a shell symbol that denotes the user's home directory−−when you log in, you are in your home directory  these terms are defined in Files and Directories .

This command logs you out of the system, and a new login: prompt appears on your terminal.    To log out of the system, type:     $ logout RET  Debian GNU Linux 2.2 bardo tty1  bardo login:  What works equally well to typing the logout command is to just type C−d  hold down CTRL and press D . You don't even have to type RET afterwards. Many users prefer this quick shortcut.  Logging out of the system frees the terminal you were using−−and ensures that nobody can access your account from this terminal.  If you are the only person using your system and have just ended a session by logging out, you might want to power down the system. See section Turning Off the System, earlier in this chapter.

What Every Linux User Knows   24   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   When you access a Linux system by the keyboard and monitor that are directly connected to it, you are said to be using the console terminal.  Linux systems can be accessed in other ways, such as through a network or via another terminal connected to a serial line; see section Communications .  Linux systems feature virtual consoles, which act as separate console displays that can run separate login sessions, but are accessed from the same physical console terminal. Linux systems are configured to have seven virtual consoles by default. When you are at the console terminal, you can switch between virtual consoles at any time, and you can log in and use the system from several virtual consoles at once.  The following recipes explain the basic things you will need to do with virtual consoles.  3.3.1 Switching between Consoles 3.3.2 Scrolling the Console Text 3.3.3 Keys for Console Manipulation    Keystrokes for manipulating the console.  Switching between consoles. Scrolling the text on the screen.

To switch to the fourth virtual console, press ALT−F4.  This command switches to the fourth virtual console, denoted by `tty4':     Debian GNU Linux 2.2 bardo tty4  bardo login:  You can also cycle through the different virtual consoles with the left and right arrow keys. To switch to the next−lowest virtual console  or wrap around to the highest virtual console, if you're at the first virtual console , press ALT−@leftarrow. To switch to the next−highest virtual console, press ALT−@rightarrow. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]    To switch from the fourth to the third virtual console, press:     ALT−@leftarrow [GNU INFO BUG: any 60;62; in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]  This keystroke switches to the third virtual console, `tty3':   3. What Every Linux User Knows   25   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     Debian GNU Linux 2.2 bardo tty3  bardo login:  The seventh virtual console is reserved for the X Window System. If X is installed, this virtual terminal will never show a login: prompt, but when you are using X, this is where your X session appears. If your system is configured to start X immediately, this virtual console will show an X login screen.  You can switch to a virtual console from the X Window System using CTRL in conjunction with the usual ALT and function keys. This is the only console manipulation keystroke that works in X.    To switch from X to the first virtual console, press:     CTRL−ALT−F1  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.3.2 Scrolling the Console Text  When you are logged in at a virtual console, new lines of text appear at the bottom of the console screen, while older lines of text scroll off the top of the screen.    To view this older text, press SHIFT−PgUp to scroll back through it.    Once you have scrolled back, press SHIFT−PgDn to scroll forward through the text toward the most recent text displayed on the console.  The amount of text you can scroll back through depends on system memory.  NOTE: This technique is for scrolling through text displayed in your shell session  see section The Shell . It does not work for scrolling through text in a tool or application in the console−−in other words, you can't use this technique to scroll through text that is displayed by a tool for perusing text files. To scroll through text in an application, use its own facilities for scrolling, if it has any.

It's a good idea to experiment with these commands until you are comfortable with them, because knowing how to use virtual consoles is basic to using Linux.   3. What Every Linux User Knows   26   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   KEYSTROKE ALT−Fn CTRL−ALT−Fn ALT−@leftarrow  DESCRIPTION Switch to virtual console n, where n is a number from 1 to 7  the default maximum . When in X, switch to virtual console n, where n is a number from 1 to 6. Switch to the next−lowest virtual console. For example, typing this while in virtual console 4 switches to virtual console 3. Pressing this keystroke in the lowest console wraps around to the highest console. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]  ALT−@rightarrow Switch to the next−highest virtual console. For example, typing this while in virtual  console 4 switches to virtual console 5. Pressing this keystroke in the highest console wraps around to the lowest console. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.] Scroll back one screen to view previously displayed text. When viewing previously displayed text, scroll forward one screen.  SHIFT−PgUp SHIFT−PgDn  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.4 Running a Command  A tool is a software program that performs a certain function−−usually a specialized, simple task. For example, the hostname tool outputs the system's hostname, and the who tool outputs a listing of the users who are currently logged in. An application is the name given to larger, usually interactive, programs for completing broader kinds of tasks−−such as programs for image editing or word processing.  A tool or application may take any number of options  sometimes called "flags" , which specify a change in its default behavior. It may also take arguments, which specify a file or some other text to operate on. Arguments are usually specified after any options.  A command is the name of a tool or application along with the options and arguments you want to use, if any. Since typing the name of a tool itself is often sufficient to accomplish a desired task, tools alone are often called commands.  Commands are case sensitive; the names of tools and applications are usually in all lowercase letters.  To run  or "execute"  a tool or application without giving any options or arguments, type its name at a shell prompt followed by RET.    To run the hostname tool, type:     $ hostname RET bardo $  The hostname of the system in the example is `bardo'.   3. What Every Linux User Knows   27   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Options always begin with a hyphen character, `−', which is usually followed by one alphanumeric character. To include an option in a command, follow the name of the tool or application with the option. Always separate the tool name, each option, and each argument with a space character.  Long−style options  sometimes called "GNU−style" options  begin with two hyphen characters  `−−'  and are usually one English word.  For example, many tools have an option, `−−version', to output the version number of the tool.  Many tools also have a `−−help' option, which outputs a list of options the tool takes; see section Listing the Usage of a Tool.           To output the version of the hostname tool, type:  $ hostname −−version RET hostname 2.10 $  This command outputs the text `hostname 2.10', indicating that this is version 2.10 of the hostname tool.  Sometimes, an option itself may may take an argument. For example, hostname has an option for specifying a file name to use to read the hostname from, `−F'; it takes as an argument the name of the file that hostname should read from.    To run hostname and specify that the file `host.info' is the file to read from, type:  $ hostname −F host.info RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.5 Changing Your Password  To change your password, use the passwd tool. It prompts you for your current password and a new password to replace it with. For security purposes, neither the old nor the new password is echoed to the screen as you type it. To make sure that you type the new password correctly, passwd prompts you for your new password twice. You must type it exactly the same way both times, or passwd will not change your password.    To change your password, type:     $ passwd RET Changing password for kurt   3. What Every Linux User Knows   28   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Old password: your current password RET Enter the new password  minimum of 5, maximum of 8 characters  Please use a combination of upper and lower case letters and numbers. New password: your new password RET Re−enter new password: your new password RET Password changed. $  NOTE: Passwords can contain uppercase and lowercase letters, the digits 0 through 9, and punctuation marks; they should be between five and eight characters long. See section Accounts and Privileges, for suggestions on choosing a good password.

This is not as inutile a command as one might first think−−if you're at a shared terminal, it's useful to determine whether or not it is your account that you're messing in, and for those with multiple accounts on a system, it's useful to see which of them you're currently logged in with.    To output your username, type:     $ whoami RET kurt $   3. What Every Linux User Knows   29   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   In this example, the username of the user logged in at this terminal is `kurt'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.6.2 Listing Who Is on the System  Use who to output a list of all the users currently logged in to the system. It outputs a minimum of three columns, listing the username, terminal location, and time of login for all users on the system. A fourth column is displayed if a user is using the X Window System; it lists the window location of the user's session  see section The X Window System .    To see who is currently logged in, type:     $ who RET murky    tty1     Oct 20 20:09 dave     tty2     Oct 21 14:37 kurt     tty3     Oct 21 15:04 kurt     ttyp1    Oct 21 15:04  :0.0  $  The output in this example shows that the user murky is logged in on tty1  the first virtual console on the system , and has been on since 20:09 on 20 October. The user dave is logged in on tty2  the second virtual console , and has been on since 14:37 on 21 October. The user kurt is logged in twice−−on tty3  the third virtual console , and ttyp1, which is an X session with a window location of ` :0.0 '.  NOTE: This command is for listing the users on the local system; to list the users connected to a different system on the network, or to see more detailed information that a user may have made public about himself, see Checking Whether a User Is Online.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.6.3 Listing Who Is on and What They're Doing  The w tool is similar to who, but it displays more detail. It outputs a header line that contains information about the current system status, including the current time, the amount of time the system has been up and running, and the number of users on the system. It then outputs a list of users currently logged in to the system, giving eight columns of information for each. These columns include username, terminal location, X session  if any , the time of login, the amount of time the user has been idle, and what command the user is running.  It also gives two columns showing the amount of time the system's CPU has spent on all of the user's current jobs  "JCPU"  and foreground process  "PCPU" ; processes are discussed in Listing System Activity, and jobs in Managing Jobs.    3. What Every Linux User Knows   30   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To see who is currently logged in and what they are doing, type:     $ w RET   5:27pm  up 17:53,  4 users,  load average: 0.12, 0.06, 0.01 USER     TTY      FROM       LOGIN   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU  WHAT murky    tty1          Oct 20 20:09 17:22m  0.32s  0.32s  −bash dave     tty2                 14:37 13.00s  2:35   0.07s  less foo kurt     tty3                 15:04  1:00m  0.41s  0.09s  startx kurt     ttyp1    :0.0        15:04  0:00s 21.65s 20.96s  emacs $  In this example, the command's output shows that the current system time is 5:27 p.m., the system has been up for 17 hours and 53 minutes, and there are four users currently logged in: murky is logged in at tty1, has been idle for 17 hours and 22 minutes, and is at a bash shell prompt; dave is logged in at tty2, has been idle for 13 seconds, and is using less to peruse a file called `foo'  see section Perusing Text ; and kurt is logged in at two terminals−−−tty3 and ttyp1, which is an X session. He ran the startx command on tty3 to start his X session, and within his X session, he is currently using Emacs.

What Every Linux User Knows   31   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    3.7 Listing System Activity  When you run a command, you are starting a process on the system, which is a program that is currently executing. Every process is given a unique number, called its process ID, or "PID."  Use ps to list processes on the system. Some of the information it can display about a process includes process ID, name of command being run, username running the command, and how long the process has been running. By default, ps outputs 5 columns: process ID, the name of the terminal from which the process was started, the current status of the process  including `S' for sleeping, meaning that it is on hold at the moment, `R' meaning that it is running, and `Z' meaning that it is a zombie process, or a process that has already died , the total amount of time the CPU has spent on the process since the process started, and finally the name of the command being run.  The following recipes describe popular usage of ps.  3.7.1 Listing Your Current Processes 3.7.2 Listing All of a User's Processes 3.7.3 Listing All Processes on the System 3.7.4 Listing Processes by Name or Number     Listing your processes.

While you can't snoop on the actual activities of other users, you can list the commands they are running at a given moment.    To list all the processes that user hst has running on the system, type:  $ ps −u hst RET  NOTE: This command is useful for listing all of your own processes, across all terminals and shell sessions; give your own username as an argument.

In fact, the foremost trouble with Linux documentation isn't that there is not enough of it, but that you have to sift through the mounds of it, trying to find the precise information you're looking for!  I describe the help facilities in the following sections; their relative usefulness for the particular kind of information you're looking for is noted.  If you find that you need more help, don't panic−−other options are available. They're described in If You Need More Help.  3.8.1 Finding the Right Tool for the Job 3.8.2 Listing a Description of a Program 3.8.3 Listing the Usage of a Tool 3.8.4 Reading a Page from the System Manual  Finding the right tool to use.        Getting a description of a tool.    Getting usage help for a tool.    The online manuals.   3. What Every Linux User Knows   34   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   3.8.5 Using the GNU Info System 3.8.6 Reading System Documentation and Help Files     The GNU hypertext Info system.    Other documentation on the  system.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.8.1 Finding the Right Tool for the Job  When you know what a particular tool or application does, but you can't remember it's name, use apropos. This tool takes a keyword as an argument, and it outputs a list of installed software whose one−line descriptions contain that keyword. This is also useful for finding software on your system related to, say, "audio" or "sound" or "sort" or some other such general concept.          To output a list of programs that pertain to consoles, type:  $ apropos consoles RET console  4           − console terminal and virtual consoles gpm  1               − a cut and paste utility and mouse server for                        virtual consoles $  NOTE: The apropos tool only finds exact matches, so a search for the keyword `console' might not list the programs that a search for the keyword `consoles' would yield, and vice versa.  Another way to find tools by keyword is to search the system manual pages  see section Reading a Page from the System Manual . To do this, use man and give the text to search for as an argument to the `−k' option. This searches the short descriptions and manual page names for the given text, and outputs a list of those tools that match in the same format as the apropos tool.    To output a list of all tools whose pages in the system manual contain a reference to consoles, type:  $ man −k consoles RET  On Debian systems, yet another way to find installed software by keyword is to use dpkg, the Debian package tool. Use the `−l' option to list all of the installed packages, which are each output on a line of their own with their package name and a brief description.  You can output a list of packages that match a keyword by piping the output to grep. Use the `−i' option with grep to match keywords regardless of case  grep is discussed in Searching Text .  Additionally, you can directly peruse the file ` var lib dpkg available'; it lists all available packages and gives a description of them.   3. What Every Linux User Knows   35   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list all of the packages on the system, type:  $ dpkg −l RET    To list all of the packages whose name or description contains the text "edit," regardless of case, type:  $ dpkg −l  grep −i edit RET    To peruse descriptions of the packages that are available, type:  $ less  var lib dpkg available RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.8.2 Listing a Description of a Program  Use whatis to list a one−line description of a program. Give the name of the tool or application to list as an argument.    To get a description of the who tool, type:  $ whatis who RET  NOTE: The whatis tool gets its descriptions from the manual page of a given program; manual pages are described later in this section, in Reading a Page from the System Manual.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.8.3 Listing the Usage of a Tool  Many tools have a long−style option, `−−help', that outputs usage information about the tool, including the options and arguments the tool takes.    To list the possible options for whoami, type:  $ whoami −−help RET Usage: whoami [OPTION]...   3. What Every Linux User Knows   36                  The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Print the user name associated with the current effective user id. Same as id −un.    −−help      display this help and exit   −−version   output version information and exit  Report bugs to sh−utils−bugs@gnu.ai.mit.edu $  This command outputs some usage information about the whoami tool, including a short description and a list of possible options.  NOTE: Not all tools take the `−−help' option; some tools take a `−h' or `−?' option instead, which performs the same function.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.8.4 Reading a Page from the System Manual  In the olden days, the hardcopy reference manual that came with most Unix systems also existed electronically on the system itself; each software program that came with the system had its own manual page  often called a "man page"  that described it. This is still true on Linux−based systems today, except they don't always come with a hardcopy manual.  Use the man tool to view a page in the system manual. As an argument to man, give the name of the program whose manual page you want to view  so to view the manual page for man, you would type man man .    To view the manual page for w, type:     $ man w RET  This command displays the manual page for w:   3. What Every Linux User Knows   37   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Use the up and down arrow keys to move through the text. Press Q to stop viewing the manual page and exit man. Since man uses less to display the text, you can use any of the less keyboard commands to peruse the manual page  see section Perusing Text .  Despite its name, a manual page does not always contain the complete documentation to a program, but it's more like a quick reference. It usually gives a short description of the program, and lists the options and arguments it takes; some manual pages also include an example or a list of related commands.  Sometimes, commands have very complete, extensive manual pages, but more often, their complete documentation is found either in other help files that come with it or in its Info documentation; these are subjects of the following two recipes.   To prepare a man page for printing, see Preparing a Man Page for Printing.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3.8.5 Using the GNU Info System  The GNU Info System is an online hypertext reference system for documentation prepared in the Info format. This documentation tends to be more complete than a typical man page, and often, the Info documentation for a given software package will be an entire book or manual. All of the manuals published by the Free Software Foundation are released in Info format; these manuals contain the same text  sans illustrations  as the paper manuals that you can purchase directly from the Free Software Foundation.  There are different ways to peruse the Info documentation: you can use the standalone info tool, read Info files in the Emacs editor  see section Emacs , or use one of the other tools designed for this purpose. Additionally, tools exist for converting Info documentation to HTML that you can read in a Web browser  see section Browsing Files .  To read the Info manual for a tool or application with the info tool, give its name as an argument. With no   3. What Every Linux User Knows   38   arguments, info opens your system's Top Info menu, which lists all of the available manuals that are installed on the system.    To view all of the Info manuals on the system, type:     $ info RET  This command starts info at the system's Top menu, which shows some of the info key commands and displays a list of available manuals:   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   This command opens a copy of The GNU tar Manual in info.  To read the contents of a file written in Info format, give the name of the file to read with the `−f' option. This is useful for reading an Info file that you have obtained elsewhere, and is not in the ` usr info' directory with the rest of the installed Info files. Info can automatically recognize and expand Info files that are compressed and have a `.gz' file name extension  see section Compressed Files .    To read `faq.info', an Info file in the current directory, type:  $ info −f faq.info RET        This command starts info and opens the Info file `faq.info', beginning at the top node in the file.  To read a specific node in an Info file, give the name of the node to use in quotes as an argument to the `−n' option.    To read `faq.info', an Info file in the current directory, beginning with the node Text, type:  $ info −n 'Text' −f faq.info RET  NOTE: You can also read Info documentation directly from the Emacs editor; you type C−h i from Emacs to start the Info reader, and then use the same commands as in the standalone info tool  see section Getting Acquainted with Emacs .  The Emacs "incremental" search command, C−s, also works in info; it's a very fast, efficient way to search for a word or phrase in an entire Info text  like this entire book ; see Searching Incrementally in Emacs.

To learn more about files and directories, see Files and Directories.  To peruse any of these files, use less, described in full in Perusing Text.  When a software package is installed, any additional documentation files it might have beyond a manual page and Info manual are placed here, in a subdirectory with the name of that package. For example, additional documentation for the hostname package is in ` usr doc hostname', and documentation for the passwd package is in ` usr doc passwd'. Most packages have a file called `README', which usually contains relevant information. Often this file is compressed as `README.gz', in which case you   3. What Every Linux User Knows   40   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   can use zless instead of less.  The Linux Documentation Project  LDP  has overseen the creation of more than 100 "HOWTO" files, each of which covers a particular aspect of the installation or use of Linux−based systems.  The LDP HOWTOs are compressed text files stored in the ` usr doc HOWTO' directory; to view them, use zless. The file ` usr doc HOWTO HOWTO−Index.gz' contains an annotated index of all the HOWTO documents installed on the system. 11   Finally, the ` usr doc FAQ' directory contains a number of FAQ  "Frequently Asked Questions"  files on various subjects, and the files that make up the Debian FAQ are in the ` usr doc debian FAQ' directory. The Debian FAQ is available both in HTML format, which you can view in a Web browser  see section Browsing Files , and as a compressed text file, which you can view in zless.    To view the HTML version of the Debian FAQ in the lynx Web browser, type:        $ lynx  usr doc debian FAQ debian−faq.html RET    To view the compressed text version of the Debian FAQ in zless, type:  $ zless  usr doc debian FAQ debian−faq.txt.gz RET  NOTE: It's often very useful to use a Web browser to browse through the documentation files in these directories−−see Browsing Files.  On some systems, ` usr doc' is superseded by the ` usr share doc' directory.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   3. What Every Linux User Knows   41    4. The Shell  The subject of this chapter is the shell, the program that reads your command input and runs the specified commands. The shell environment is the most fundamental way to interact with the system−−you are said to be "in" a shell from the very moment you've successfully logged in to the system.  The `$' character preceding the cursor is called the shell prompt; it tells you that the system is ready and waiting for input. On Debian systems, the default shell prompt also includes the name of the current directory  see section Files and Directories . A tilde character  `~'  denotes your home directory, which is where you'll find yourself when you log in.  For example, a typical user's shell prompt might look like this:     ~ $ _  If your shell prompt shows a number sign  `'  instead of a `$', this means that you're logged in with the superuser, or root, account. Beware: the root account has complete control over the system; one wrong keystroke and you might accidentally break it something awful. You need to have a different user account for yourself, and use that account for your regular use  see section Making a User Account .  Every Linux system has at least one shell program, and most have several. We'll cover bash, which is the standard shell on most Linux systems.  Its name stands for "Bourne again shell"−−−a pun on the name of Steve Bourne, who was author of the traditional Unix shell, the Bourne shell.

The text you type at a shell prompt is called the command line  it's also called the input line .   4. The Shell   42   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   The following table describes the keystrokes used for typing command lines.  KEYSTROKES text  BKSP DEL RET  C−a C−d C−e C−k  C−l C−u C−y  C−_ @leftarrow  @rightarrow  DESCRIPTION Insert text at the point where the cursor is at; if there is text to the right of the cursor, it is shifted over to the right. Delete the character to the left of the cursor. Delete the character the cursor is underneath. Send the command line to bash for execution  in other words, it runs the command typed at the shell prompt . You don't have to be at the far right end of the command line to type RET; you can type it when the cursor is anywhere on the command line. Move the cursor to the beginning of the input line. Same as DEL  this is the Emacs equivalent . Move the cursor to the end of the input line. Kill, or "cut," all text on the input line, from the character the cursor is underneath to the end of the line. Clear the terminal screen. Kill the entire input line. Yank, or "paste," the text that was last killed. Text is inserted at the point where the cursor is. Undo the last thing typed on this command line. Move the cursor to the left one character. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the <− arrow key.] Move the cursor to the right one character. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the −> arrow key.]  @uparrowand@downarrow Cycle through the command history  see section Command History . [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the up and down arrow keys.]  NOTE: These keyboard commands are the same as those used by the Emacs editor  see section Emacs . Many other Emacs keyboard commands also work on the command line  see section Basic Emacs Editing Keys . And, for Vi aficionados, it is possible to configure bash to recognize Vi−style bindings instead.  The following sections describe some important features of command line editing, such as quoting special characters and strings, letting the shell complete your typing, re−running commands, and running multiple commands. See Info file `bashref.info', node `Command Line Editing' for more information on bash's command line editing features.  4.1.1 Passing Special Characters to Commands 4.1.2 Letting the Shell Complete What You Type 4.1.3 Repeating the Last Command You Typed     Quoting special characters and strings.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.1.1 Passing Special Characters to Commands  Some characters are reserved and have special meaning to the shell on their own. Before you can pass one of these characters to a command, you must quote it by enclosing the entire argument in single quotes  `'' .  For example, here's how to pass `Please Stop!' to a command:  'Please Stop!'  When the argument you want to pass has one or more single quote characters in it, enclose it in double quotes, like so:           "Please Don't Stop!"  To pass special characters as a string, give them as:  $'string'  where string is the string of characters to be passed. Special backslash escape sequences for certain characters are commonly included in a string, as listed in the following table.  ESCAPE SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION \a \b \e \f \n \r \t \v \\ \NNN  Alert  rings the system bell . Backspace. Escape. Form feed. Newline. Carriage return. Horizontal tab. Vertical tab. Backslash. Character whose ASCII code is NNN in octal  base 8 .  To demonstrate the passing of special character sequences to tool, the following examples will use the figlet tool, which displays the text you give as an argument in a "font" made up of text characters  see   4. The Shell   44   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   section Horizontal Text Fonts .    To pass a backslash character as an argument to figlet, type:    To pass a form feed character followed by a pilcrow sign character  octal character code 266  to figlet, type:        $ figlet $'\\' RET  $ echo $'\f\266' RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.1.2 Letting the Shell Complete What You Type  Completion is where bash does its best to finish your typing. To use it, press TAB on the input line and the shell will complete the word to the left of the cursor to the best of its ability. Completion is one of those things that, once you begin to use it, you will wonder how you ever managed to get by without.  Completion works on both file names and command names, depending on the context of the cursor when you type TAB.  For example, suppose you want to specify, as an argument to the ls command, the ` usr lib emacs 20.4 i386−debian−linux−gnu ' directory−−that's a lot to type. So instead of typing out the whole directory name, you can type TAB to complete it for you. Notice how our first attempt, typing only the letter `e' in ` e', brings up a series of files−−while the second attempt, typing `em', further refines our search:  $ ls  usr lib eTAB elm−me+    emacs      emacsen−common  entity−map    expect5.30 $ ls  usr lib emTAB  At this point, the system beeps 12  and the shell completes the word `emacs', since all options in this directory beginning with the letters `em' complete to at least that word. Press  TAB to access this word and go on, and the shell completes the subdirectory `20.4' since that is the only file or directory in the `emacs' subdirectory:  $ ls  usr lib emacs TAB20.4   Press TAB again to have the shell complete the only subdirectory in `20.4':  $ ls  usr lib emacs 20.4 TABi386−debian−linux−gnu    4.

You can then type RET to run the command again, or you can edit the command first. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]    To repeat the last command entered, type:           The @uparrow key moves the last command you typed back to the input line, and RET executes it. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]  By typing @uparrow more than once, you can go back to earlier commands you've typed; this is a function of your command history, which is explained in full in Command History. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]  Additionally, you can use the bash reverse−incremental search feature, C−r, to search, in reverse, through your command history. You'll find this useful if you remember typing a command line with `foo' in it recently, and you wish to repeat the command without having to retype it. Type C−r followed by the text foo, and the last command you typed containing `foo' appears on the input line.  Like the Emacs command of the same name  see section Searching Incrementally in Emacs , this is called an incremental search because it builds the search string in character increments as you type. Typing the string `cat' will first search for  and display  the last input line containing a `c', then `ca', and finally `cat', as you type the individual characters of the search string. Typing C−r again retrieves the next previous command line that has a match for the search string.    To put the last command you entered containing the string `grep' back on the input line, type:  $ C−r  reverse−i−search `': grep    To put the third−to−the−last command you entered containing the string grep back on the input line, type:  $ C−r   4. The Shell   46   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    reverse−i−search `': grep  C−r C−r  When a command is displayed on the input line, type RET to run it.

The standard output is where the shell streams the text output of commands−−the screen on your terminal, by default. The standard input, typically the keyboard, is where you input data for commands. When a command reads the standard input, it usually keeps reading text until you type C−d on a new line by itself.  When a command runs and exits with an error, the error message is usually output to your screen, but as a separate stream called the standard error.  You redirect these streams−−to a file, or even another command−−with redirection. The following sections describe the shell redirection operators that you can use to redirect standard input and output.   4.

For example, instead of giving a list of keywords as arguments to apropos  see section Finding the Right Tool for the Job , you can redirect standard input to a file containing a list of keywords to use.    To redirect standard input for apropos to file `keywords', type:  $ apropos 60; keywords RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.2.2 Redirecting Output to a File  Use the `>' operator to redirect standard output to a file. To use it, follow a command with > and the name of the file the output should be written to.    To redirect standard output of the command apropos shell bash to the file `commands', type:  $ apropos shell bash 62; commands RET  If you redirect standard output to an existing file, it will overwrite the file, unless you use the `>>' operator to append the standard output to the contents of the existing file.    To append the standard output of apropos shells to an existing file `commands', type:  $ apropos shells 62;62; commands RET   4.

Follow a command with 2> and the name of the file the error stream should be written to.    To redirect the standard error of apropos shell bash to the file `command.error', type:  $ apropos shell bash 262; command.error RET  As with the standard output, use the `>>' operator instead of `>' to append the standard error to the contents of an existing file.    To append the standard error of apropos shells to an existing file `command.error', type:  $ apropos shells 262;62; command.error RET  To redirect both standard output and standard error to the same file, use `&>' instead.    To redirect the standard output and the standard error of apropos shells to the file `commands', type:  $ apropos shells 38;62; commands RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.2.4 Redirecting Output to Another Command's Input           Piping is when you connect the standard output of one command to the standard input of another. You do this by specifying the two commands in order, separated by a vertical bar character, `'  sometimes called a "pipe" . Commands built in this fashion are called pipelines.  For example, it's often useful to pipe commands that display a lot of text output to less, a tool for perusing text  see section Perusing Text .    To pipe the output of apropos bash shell shells to less, type:   4. The Shell   49   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ apropos bash shell shells  less RET  This redirects the standard output of the command apropos bash shell shells to the standard input of the command less, which displays it on the screen.

You can have more than one job running from a shell at once, but only one job can be active at the terminal, reading standard input and writing standard output. This job is the foreground job, while any other jobs are said to be running in the background.  The shell assigns each job a unique job number. Use the job number as an argument to specify the job to commands. Do this by giving the job number preceded by a `%' character.  To find the job number of a job you have running, list your jobs  see section Listing Your Jobs .  The following sections describe the various commands for managing jobs.      Suspending a job to do something else.  4.3.1 Suspending a Job 4.3.2 Putting a Job in the Background    Having jobs work in the background. 4.3.3 Putting a Job in the Foreground 4.3.4 Listing Your Jobs 4.3.5 Stopping a Job        Listing your jobs.     Stopping jobs before they're finished.  Putting jobs in the foreground.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.3.1 Suspending a Job  Type C−z to suspend or stop the foreground job−−useful for when you want to do something else in the shell and return to the current job later. The job stops until you either bring it back to the foreground or make it run in the background  see section Putting a Job in the Foreground and see section Putting a Job in the Background .  For example, if you are reading a document in info, typing C−z will suspend the info program and return you to a shell prompt where you can do something else  see section Using the GNU Info System . The shell outputs a line giving the job number  in brackets  of the suspended job, the text `Stopped' to indicate that the job has stopped, and the command line itself, as shown here:   4. The Shell   50   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     [1]+  Stopped                 info −f cookbook.info  In this example, the job number is 1 and the command that has stopped is `info −f cookbook.info'. The `+' character next to the job number indicates that this is the most recent job.  If you have any stopped jobs when you log out, the shell will tell you this instead of logging you out:        $ logout RET There are stopped jobs. $  At this point you can list your jobs  see section Listing Your Jobs , stop any jobs you have running  see section Stopping a Job , and then log out.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.3.2 Putting a Job in the Background  New jobs run in the foreground unless you specify otherwise. To run a job in the background, end the input line with an ampersand  `&' . This is useful for running non−interactive programs that perform a lot of calculations.    To run the command apropos shell > shell−commands as a background job, type:  $ apropos shell 62; shell−commands 38; RET [1] 6575 $   The shell outputs the job number  in this case, 1  and process ID  in this case, 6575 , and then returns to a shell prompt. When the background job finishes, the shell will list the job number, the command, and the text `Done', indicating that the job has completed successfully:  [1]+  Done                    apropos shell 62;shell−commands  To move a job from the foreground to the background, first suspend it  see section Suspending a Job  and then type bg  for "background" .    For example, to start the command apropos shell > shell−commands in the foreground, suspend it, and then specify that it finish in the background, you would type:        $ apropos shell 62; shell−commands RET C−z   4. The Shell   51   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   [1]+  Stopped                 apropos shell 62;shell−commands $ bg RET [1]+ apropos shell 38; $  If you have suspended multiple jobs, specify the job to be put in the background by giving its job number as an argument.    To run job 4 in the background, type:  $ bg %4 RET  NOTE: Running a job in the background is sometimes called "backgrounding" or "amping off" a job.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.3.3 Putting a Job in the Foreground  Type fg to move a background job to the foreground. By default, fg works on the most recent background job.    To bring the most recent background job to the foreground, type:  $ fg RET  To move a specific job to the foreground when you have multiple jobs in the background, specify the job number as an option to fg.    To bring job 3 to the foreground, type:  $ fg %3 RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.3.4 Listing Your Jobs  To list the jobs running in the current shell, type jobs.            4. The Shell   52   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list your jobs, type:  $ jobs RET [1]−  Stopped                 apropos shell 62;shell−commands [2]+  Stopped                 apropos bash 62;bash−commands $  This example shows two jobs−−−apropos shell > shell−commands and apropos bash > bash−commands. The `+' character next to a job number indicates that it's the most recent job, and the `−' character indicates that it's the job previous to the most recent job. If you have no current jobs, jobs returns nothing.  To list all of the processes you have running on the system, use ps instead of jobs−−−see Listing System Activity.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.3.5 Stopping a Job  Typing C−c interrupts the foreground job before it completes, exiting the program.    To interrupt cat, a job running in the foreground, type:  Use kill to interrupt  "kill"  a background job, specifying the job number as an argument.  $ cat RET C−c RET $    To kill job number 2, type:  $ kill %2 RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.4 Command History  Your command history is the sequential list of commands you have typed, in the current or previous shell sessions. The commands in this history list are called events.   4. The Shell   53   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   By default, bash remembers the last 500 events, but this number is configurable  see section Customizing Future Shells .  Your command history is stored in a text file in your home directory called `.bash_history'; you can view this file or edit it like you would any other text file.  Two very useful things that having a command history lets you do is to repeat the last command you typed, and  as explained earlier in this chapter  to do an incremental backwards search through your history.  The following sections explain how to view your history and specify events from it on the command line. See Info file `bashref.info', node `Bash History Facilities', for more information on command history.  4.4.1 Viewing Your Command History 4.4.2 Specifying a Command from Your History     Viewing the history of what you typed.     Substituting a command from your history.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.4.1 Viewing Your Command History  Use history to view your command history.    To view your command history, type:  $ history RET 1 who 2 apropos shell 62;shell−commands 3 apropos bash 62;bash−commands 4 history $        This command shows the contents of your command history file, listing one command per line prefaced by its event number. Use an event number to specify that event in your history  see section Specifying a Command from Your History .  If your history is a long one, this list will scroll off the screen, in which case you may want to pipe the output to less in order to peruse it. It's also common to search for a past command by piping the output to grep  see section Redirecting Output to Another Command's Input and Searching for a Word or Phrase .    To search your history for the text `apropos', type:  $ history  grep apropos RET   4. The Shell   54   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   2 apropos shell 62;shell−commands 3 apropos bash 62;bash−commands 5 history  grep apropos $  This command will show the events from your history containing the text `apropos'.  The last line of output is the command you just typed.   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.4.2 Specifying a Command from Your History  You can specify a past event from your history on the input line, in order to run it again.  The simplest way to specify a history event is to use the up and down arrow keys at the shell prompt to browse your history. The up arrow key  @uparrow  takes you back through past events, and the down arrow key  @downarrow  moves you forward into recent history. When a history event is on the input line, you can edit it as normal, and type RET to run it as a command; it will then become the newest event in your history. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]    To specify the second−to−the−last command in your history, type:  $ @uparrow @uparrow [GNU INFO BUG: any 60;62; in the preceding line should be the one of the cursor arrow keys.]  To run a history event by its event number, enter an exclamation point  `!', sometimes called "bang"  followed by the event number.  Get the event number by viewing your history; see section Viewing Your Command History .          To run history event number 1, type:  $ !1 RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.5 Recording a Shell Session  Use script to create a typescript, or "capture log," of a shell session−−it writes a verbatim copy of your session to a file, including commands you type and their output. The first and last lines of the file show the beginning and ending time and date of the capture session. To stop recording the typescript, type exit at a   4. The Shell   55   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   shell prompt. By default, typescripts are saved to a file called `typescript' in the current directory; specify the file name to use as an argument.    To create a typescript of a shell session and save it to the file `log.19990817', type:     $ script log.19990817 RET Script started, output file is log.19990817 $ hostname RET erie $ apropos bash 62; bash.commands RET $ exit RET exit Script done, output file is log.19990817 $     Script started on Tue May 25 14:21:52 1999 $ hostname erie $ apropos bash 62; bash.commands $ exit exit  Script done on Tue May 25 14:22:30 1999  In this example, the typescript records a shell session consisting of two commands  hostname and apropos  to a file called `log.19990817'. The typescript looks like this:  NOTE: It's possible, but usually not desirable, to run script from within another script session. This usually happens when you've forgotten that you are running it, and you run it again inside the current typescript, even multiple times−−as a result, you may end up with multiple sessions "nested" inside each other like a set of Russian dolls.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.6 Customizing Your Shell  The following sections describe the most common ways to customize the shell−−including changing the text of the shell prompt and creating aliases for other commands. These customizations will apply to the rest of your current shell session, unless you change them again. Eventually, you will want to make them work all the time, like whenever you log in or start a new shell−−and how to do this is discussed below.  4.6.1 Changing the Shell Prompt 4.6.2 Making a Command Alias    Making an alias for a command sequence. 4.6.3 Adding to Your Path  Specifying the text to put in the shell prompt.     Adding to your path.       4. The Shell   56   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   4.6.4 Customizing Future Shells    Automatically running commands when you first log  in.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.6.1 Changing the Shell Prompt  A shell variable is a symbol that stores a text string, and is referenced by a unique name. bash keeps one special variable, named PS1, for the text of the shell prompt. To change the text of the shell prompt, you need to change the contents of the PS1 variable.  To change a variable's contents, type its name followed by an equal sign  `='  character and the string that should replace the variable's existing contents.    To change your shell prompt to `Your wish is my command: ', type:  $ PS1='Your wish is my command: ' RET Your wish is my command:   Since the replacement text has spaces in it, we've quoted it  see section Passing Special Characters to Commands .  You can put special characters in the prompt variable in order to output special text. For example, the characters `\w' in the value of PS1 will list the current working directory at that place in the shell prompt text.    To change your prompt to the default bash prompt−−the current working directory followed by a `$' character−−type:        The following table lists some special characters and their text output at the shell prompt.  $ PS1='\w $ ' RET ~ $  TEXT OUTPUT  SPECIAL CHARACTER \a  \d \h \n   4. The Shell   Inserts a C−g character, which makes the internal speaker beep.  It "rings the system bell"; C−g is sometimes called the bell character.  The current date. The hostname of the system. A newline character.  57   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   \t \@ \w \u \!  The current system time, in 24−hour format. The current system time, in 12−hour a.m. p.m. format. The current working directory. Your username. The history number of this command.  You can combine any number of these special characters with regular characters when creating a value for PS1.    To change the prompt to the current date followed by a space character, the hostname of the system in parenthesis, and a greater−than character, type:  $ PS1='\d  \h 62;' RET 14 Dec 1999  ithaca 62;  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.6.2 Making a Command Alias  Use alias to assign an alias, a name that represents another command or commands. Aliases are useful for creating short command names for lengthy and frequently used commands.    To make an alias of bye for the exit command, type:  $ alias bye="exit" RET  This command makes `bye' an alias for `exit' in the current shell, so typing bye would then run exit.  You can also include options and arguments in an alias.    To make an alias of `ap' for the command apropos shell bash shells, type:  $ alias ap="apropos shell bash shells" RET  This command makes `ap' an alias for `apropos shell bash shells' in the current shell, so typing ap would run apropos shell bash shells.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4. The Shell   58            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    4.6.3 Adding to Your Path  To add or remove a directory in your path, use a text editor to change the shell variable `PATH' in the `.bashrc' file in your home directory  see section Text Editing .  For example, suppose the line that defines the `PATH' variable in your `.bashrc' file looks like this:  PATH=" usr bin: bin: usr bin X11: usr games"  You can add the directory ` home nancy bin' to this path, by editing this line like so:  PATH=" usr bin: bin: usr bin X11: usr games: home nancy bin"  NOTE: See Files and Directories for a complete description of directories and the path.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4.6.4 Customizing Future Shells  There are a number of configuration startup files in your home directory that you can edit to make your configurations permanent. You can also edit these files to specify commands to be run whenever you first log in, log out, or start a new shell. These configuration files are text files that can be edited with any text editor  see section Text Editing .  When you log in, bash first checks to see if the file ` etc profile' exists, and if so, it executes the commands in this file. This is a generic, system−wide startup file that is run for all users; only the system administrator can add or delete commands to this file.  Next, bash reads and executes the commands in `.bash_profile', a "hidden" file in your home directory  see section Listing Hidden Files . Thus, to make a command run every time you log in, add the command to this file.  For all new shells after you've logged in  that is, all but the "login shell" , bash reads and executes the commands in the `.bashrc' file in your home directory. Commands in this file run whenever a new shell is started except for the login shell.  There are separate configuration files for login and all other shells so that you can put specific customizations in your `.bash_profile' that only run when you first log in to the system. To avoid having to put commands in both files when you want to run the same ones for all shells, append the following to the end of your `.bash_profile' file:  if [ −f ~ .bashrc ]; then . ~ .bashrc; fi   4. The Shell   59            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   This makes bash run the `.bashrc' file in your home directory when you log in. In this way, you can put all of your customizations in your `.bashrc' file, and they will be run both at log in and for all subsequent shells. Any customizations before this line in `.bash_profile' run only when you log in.  For example, a simple `.bash_profile' might look like this:  This `.bash_profile' prints a welcome message with the figlet text font tool  see section Horizonal Text Fonts , and then runs the commands in the `.bashrc' file.         "Comment" lines in shell scripts begin with a  character.  They are not executed by bash, but exist so that you may   document your file.   You can insert blank lines in your file to increase readability;  bash will not mind.   Generate a welcome message when you log in. figlet 'Good day, '$USER'!'   Now run the commands in .bashrc if [ −f ~ .bashrc ]; then . ~ .bashrc; fi   Set a custom path. PATH=" usr local bin: usr bin: bin: usr bin X11: usr games:~ bin:."  A simple .bashrc file might look like this:   Make color directory listings the default. alias ls="ls −−color=auto"   Make "l" give a verbose directory listing. alias l="ls −l"   Set a custom shell prompt. PS1="[\w] $ "   Make a long history list and history file. HISTSIZE=20000 HISTFILESIZE=20000   Export the path and prompt variables for all   variables you define. export HISTSIZE HISTFILESIZE PATH PS1  This `.bashrc' sets a few useful command aliases and uses a custom path and shell prompt whenever a new shell is run; with the preceding `.bash_profile', this `.bashrc' is also run at login.  When you log out, bash reads and executes the commands in the `.bash_logout' file in your home directory, if it exists. To run commands when you log out, put them in this file.    To clear the screen every time you log out, your `.bash_logout' would contain the following line:   4. The Shell   60   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     clear  This executes the clear command, which clears the screen of the current terminal, such as in the xterm window where you type it, or in a virtual console.  NOTE: Some distributions come with default shell startup files filled with all kinds of interesting stuff. Debian users might want to look at the example startup files in ` usr share doc bash examples startup−files'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   4. The Shell   61    5. The X Window System  @sf{Debian}: `xserver−common' @sf{WWW}: http:  www.xfree86.org   The X Window System, commonly called "X," 13  is a graphical windowing interface that comes with all popular Linux distributions. X is available for many Unix−based operating systems; the version of X that runs on Linux systems with x86−based CPUs is called "XFree86." The current version of X is 11, Revision 6−−or "X11R6."  All the command−line tools and most of the applications that you can run in the console can run in X; also available are numerous applications written specifically for X.  This chapter shows you how to get around in X: how to start it and stop it, run programs within it, manipulate windows, and customize X to your liking. See The Linux XFree86 HOWTO for information on installing X  see section Reading System Documentation and Help Files .  5.1 Running X 5.2 Running a Program in X 5.3 Manipulating X Client Windows 5.4 Moving around the Desktop 5.5 Running a Shell in X 5.6 Configuring X     What X looks like, and how to run it.

If your X is configured to start any tools or applications, they should each start and appear in individual windows. A typical X session looks like this:   5. The X Window System   62   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   The root window is the background behind all of the other windows. It is usually set to a color, but you can change it  see section Changing the Root Window Parameters . Each program or application in X runs in its own window. Each window has a decorative border on all four sides, called the window border; L−shaped corners, called frames; a top window bar, called the title bar, which displays the name of the window; and several title bar buttons on the left and right sides of the title bar  described in Manipulating X Client Windows .  The entire visible work area, including the root window and any other windows, is called the desktop. The box in the lower right−hand corner, called the pager, allows you to move about a large desktop  see section Moving around the Desktop .  A window manager controls the way windows look and are displayed−−the window dressing, as it were−−and can provide some additional menu or program management capabilities. There are many different window managers to choose from, with a variety of features and capabilities.  See section Choosing a Window Manager, for help in choosing a window manager that's right for you.    5. The X Window System   63   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Window managers typically allow you to customize the colors and borders that are used to display a window, as well as the type and location of buttons that appear on the window  see section Running a Program in X . For example, in the image above, the clock image itself is the oclock program; the blue outline around it is the window border, as drawn by the fvwm2 window manager. With the afterstep window manager, the window border would look quite different:  There are many window managers you can choose from, all different; instead of describing only one, or describing all of them only superficially, this chapter shows the basics of X, which are common to all window managers. I try to make no assumptions as to which window manager you are using; while the fvwm family of window managers has long been a popular choice on most Linux−based systems, today other window managers−−including WindowMaker  the binary itself is called wmaker , Enlightenment, AfterStep, and others−−have all gained in popularity.  And recently, desktop environments have become popular. These are a collection of applications that run on top of the window manager  and X , with the purpose of giving your X session a standardized "look and feel"; these suites normally come with a few basic tools such as clocks and file managers. The two popular ones are GNOME and KDE, and while they generate a lot of press these days because of their graphical nature, both are changing very quickly and at the time of this writing are not yet ready for widespread, general use  and they can cause your system to crash .  If you have a recent Linux distribution and chose the default install, chances are good that you have either GNOME or KDE installed, with either the fvwm2 or wmaker window manager assigned as the default.  While you can have more than one window manager installed on your system, you can only run one at a time.   5.1.1 Starting X    How to start X. 5.1.2 Stopping X    How to stop X.

The X Window System   64            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    5.1.1 Starting X  There are two ways to start X. Some systems run the X Display Manager, xdm, when the system boots, at which point a graphical xdm login screen appears; you can use this to log in directly to an X session. On systems not running xdm, the virtual console reserved for X will be blank until you start X by running the startx command.    To start X from a virtual console, type:  $ startx RET    To run startx and redirect its output to a log file, type:  $ startx 62;$HOME startx.log 262;38;1 RET  Both of these examples start X on the seventh virtual console, regardless of which console you are at when you run the command−−your console switches to X automatically. You can always switch to another console during your X session  see section Console Basics . The second example writes any error messages or output of startx to a file called `startx.log' in your home directory.  On some systems, X starts with 8−bit color depth by default. Use startx with the special `−bpp' option to specify the color depth. Follow the option with a number indicating the color depth to use, and precede the option with two hyphen characters  `−−' , which tells startx to pass the options which follow it to the X server itself.    To start X from a virtual console, and specify 16−bit color depth, type:  $ startx −− −bpp 16 RET  NOTE: If your system runs xdm, you can always switch to the seventh virtual console  or whichever console xdm is running on , and then log in at the xdm login screen.

To end your X session if you are running the fvwm2 window manager, click the left mouse button in the root window to pull up the start menu, and then choose Really quit? from the Exit   5. The X Window System   65   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Fvwm submenu.    To end your X session if you are running the afterstep window manager, click the left mouse button in the root window to pull up the start menu, and then choose Really quit? from the Exit Fvwm submenu.  If you started your X session with startx, these commands will return you to a shell prompt in the virtual console where the command was typed. If, on the other hand, you started your X session by logging in to xdm on the seventh virtual console, you will be logged out of the X session and the xdm login screen will appear; you can then switch to another virtual console or log in to X again.  To exit X immediately and terminate all X processes, press the CTRL−ALT−BKSP combination  if your keyboard has two ALT and CTRL keys, press the left ones . You'll lose any unsaved application data, but this is useful when you cannot exit your X session normally−−in the case of a system freeze or other problem.    To exit X immediately, type:     CTRL−ALT−BKSP  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   5.2 Running a Program in X  Programs running in an X session are called X clients.  The X Window System itself is called the X server . To run a program in X, you start it as an X client−−either by selecting it from a menu, or by typing the command to run in an xterm shell window  see section Running a Shell in X . Most window managers have a "start menu" of some kind; it's usually accessed by clicking the left mouse button anywhere on the root window. To run an X client from the start menu, click the left mouse button to select the client's name from the submenus.  For example, to start a square−shaped, analog−face clock from the start menu, click the left mouse button on the root window to make the menu appear, and click the left mouse button through the application menus and on `Xclock  analog '. This starts the xclock client, specifying the option to display an analog face:   5. The X Window System   66   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   You can also start a client by running it from a shell window−−useful for starting a client that isn't on the menu, or for when you want to specify options or arguments. When you run an X client from a shell window, it opens in its own window; run the client in the background to free the shell prompt in the shell window  see section Putting a Job in the Background .    To run a digital clock from a shell window, type:  $ xclock −digital 38; RET  This command runs xclock in the background from a shell window; the `digital' option specifies a digital clock.  The following sections explain how to specify certain command−line options common to most X clients−−such as window layout, colors, and fonts.  5.2.1 Specifying Window Size and Location     5.2.2 Specifying Window Colors 5.2.3 Specifying Window Font 5.2.4 Specifying Additional Window Attributes  Specifying the size and location of a window.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   5.2.1 Specifying Window Size and Location  Specify a window's size and location by giving its window geometry with the `geometry' option. Four fields control the width and height of the windows, and the window's distance  "offset"  from the edge of the screen. It is specified in the form:     −geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF  The values in these four fields are usually given in pixels, although some applications measure WIDTH and HEIGHT in characters. While you must give these values in order, you can omit either pair. For example, to specify just the size of the window, give values for WIDTH and HEIGHT only.    To start a small xclock, 48 pixels wide and 48 pixels high, type:  $ xclock −geometry 48x48 RET   5. The X Window System   67                        The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To start a large xclock, 480 pixels wide and 500 pixels high, type:  $ xclock −geometry 480x500 RET    To start an xclock with a width of 48 pixels and the default height, type:  $ xclock −geometry 48 RET    To start an xclock with a height of 48 pixels and the default width, type:  $ xclock −geometry x48 RET  You can give positive or negative numbers for the XOFF and YOFF fields. Positive XOFF values specify a position from the left of the screen; negative values specify a position from the right. If YOFF is positive, it specifies a position from the top of the screen; if negative, it specifies a position from the bottom of the screen. When giving these offsets, you must specify values for both XOFF and YOFF.  To place the window in one of the four corners of the desktop, use zeroes for the appropriate XOFF and YOFF values, as follows:  XOFF AND YOFF VALUES WINDOW POSITION +0+0 +0−0 −0+0 −0−0  Upper left corner. Lower left corner. Upper right corner. Lower right corner.    To start a default size xclock in the lower left−hand corner, type:  $ xclock −geometry +0−0 RET  Or, to put it all together, you can specify the size and location of a window with one geometry line that includes all four values.    To start an xclock with a width of 120 pixels, a height of 100 pixels, an x offset of 250 pixels from the right side of the screen, and a y offset of 25 pixels from the top of the screen, type:  $ xclock −geometry 120x100−250+25 RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   5. The X Window System   68   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    5.2.2 Specifying Window Colors  The window colors available in your X session depend on your display hardware and the X server that is running. The xcolors tool will show all colors available on your X server and the names used to specify them.  Color names are not case sensitive.     To list the available colors, type:  $ xcolors RET  Press Q to exit xcolors.              To specify a color to use for the window background, window border, and text or graphics in the window itself, give the color name as an argument to the appropriate option: `−bg' for background color, `−bd' for window border color, and `−fg' for foreground color.    To start an xclock with a light blue window background, type:  $ xclock −bg lightblue RET  You can specify any combination of these attributes.    To start an xclock with a sea green window background and a turquoise window foreground, type:  $ xclock −bg seagreen −fg turquoise RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   5.2.3 Specifying Window Font  To get an X font name, use xfontsel  see section X Fonts . To specify a font for use in a window, use the `−fn' option followed by the X font name to use.    To start an xclock with a digital display, and specify that it use a 17−point Helvetica font for text, type:  $ xclock −digital −fn −*−helvetica−*−r−*−*−17−*−*−*−*−*−*−* RET   5. The X Window System   69   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   This command starts an xclock that looks like this:  NOTE: If you specify the font for a shell window, you can resize it after it's running, as described in Resizing the Xterm Font.

To see these menus, hold CTRL and click one of the three mouse buttons. 14  The following table lists and describes various window attributes common to most X−aware applications.  WINDOW OPTIONS −bd color −bordercolor color −bg color −background color −bw number −borderwidth number −fg color −foreground color −fn font −font font −geometry geometry −iconic −title string  DESCRIPTION  Use color for the window border color.   Use color for the window background color.   Specify the window border width in pixels.   Use color for the window foreground text or graphics.   Use font for the font to use.  Specify window geometry. Immediately iconify the program  see section Minimizing a Window . Use string for the window title.

To make a client active, move the mouse over the client's window. When a client is the active client, it is said to be "in focus." Depending on the window manager, the shape of the mouse pointer may change, or the   5. The X Window System   70   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   window border and title bar of the active client may be different  a common default is steel blue for the active client color and gray for all other windows .

This is useful for when the program running in the window has stopped responding.  Of course, if a program in a window has an option to stop it normally, you can always use it to stop the program and close its window.    5.

A virtual desktop can be larger than the display, in which case you can scroll though it with the mouse. The view which fills the display is called the viewport. When you move the mouse off the screen in a direction where the current  virtual  desktop extends, the view scrolls in that direction. Virtual desktops are useful for running many clients full screen at once, each in its own separate desktop.  Some configurations disallow scrolling between desktops; in that case, switch between them with a pager, which shows a miniature view of your virtual desktop, and allows you to switch between desktops. It is a sticky window  it "sticks to the glass" above all other windows , and is always in the lower right−hand corner of your screen, even when you scroll across a virtual desktop. Both your current desktop and active X client are highlighted in the pager.  The default fvwm2 virtual desktop size is nine desktops in a 3x3 grid:   5. The X Window System   72   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   In the preceding illustration, the current desktop is the second one in the top row. The first desktop contains two X client windows−−a small one and a large one−−but there are no windows in any other desktop  including the current one .  To switch to another desktop, click the left mouse button on its corresponding view in the pager, or use a keyboard shortcut. In fvwm2, the default keys for switching between desktops are ALT in conjunction with the arrow keys; in afterstep, use the CTRL key in place of ALT.    To switch to the desktop to the left of the current one while running fvw2, type ALT−{@leftarrow}. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the   arrow keys.]    To switch to the desktop directly to the left of the current one while running afterstep, type CTRL−{@leftarrow}. [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the <− and or −> arrow keys.]  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   5.5 Running a Shell in X  Use xterm to run a shell in a window. You can run commands in an xterm window just as you would in a virtual console; a shell in an xterm acts the same as a shell in a virtual console  see section The Shell .  Unlike a shell in a console, you can cut and paste text from an xterm to another X client  see section Selecting Text .  To scroll through text that has scrolled past the top of the screen, type Shift−PgUp. The number of lines you can scroll back to depends on the value of the scrollback buffer, specified with the `−sl' option; its default value is 64.  There are many options for controlling xterm's emulation characteristics; consult the xtermman page for a complete listing  see section Reading a Page from the System Manual .  NOTE:xterm is probably the most popular terminal emulator X client, but it is not the only one; others to choose from include wterm and rxvt, all with their own special features−−try them all to find one you like.

An X server can switch between the video modes allowed by your hardware and set up by the administrator; it is not uncommon for a machine running X to offer several video modes, so that 640x480, 800x600, and 1024x768 display resolutions are possible.  To switch to another video mode, use the + and − keys on the numeric keypad with the left CTRL and ALT keys. The + key switches to the next mode with a lower resolution, and the − key switches to the next mode with a higher resolution.    To switch to the next−lowest video mode, type:    To switch to the next−highest video mode, type:        CTRL−ALT−+  CTRL−ALT−−  Type either of the above key combinations repeatedly to cycle through all available modes.

It is just a shell script, usually containing a list of clients to run. You can edit your `.xsession' file in a text editor, and if this file doesn't exist, you can create it.  Clients start in the order in which they are listed, and the last line should specify the window manager to use. The following example `.xsession' file starts an xterm with a black background and white text, puts an `oclock'  a round clock  window in the upper left−hand corner, starts the Emacs text editor, and then starts the fvwm2 window manager:     !  bin sh   A sample .xsession file.  xterm −bg black −fg white 38; oclock −geometry +0+0 38; emacs 38; exec  usr bin X11 fvwm2  All clients start as background jobs, with the exception of the window manager on the last line, because when this file runs, the X session is running in the foreground  see section Managing Jobs . Always put an ampersand  `&'  character at the end of any command line you put in your `.xsession' file, except for the line giving the window manager on the last line.

To draw these patterns, X tiles the root window with a bitmap, which is a black−and−white image stored in a special file format. X comes with some bitmaps installed in the ` usr X11R6 include bitmaps ' directory; the default bitmap file is `root_weave'  you can make your own patterns with the bitmap tool; see Interactive Image Editors and Tools .  Use xsetroot to change the color and bitmap pattern in the root window.  To change the color, use the `−solid' option, and give the name of the color to use as an argument.  Use xcolors to get a list of possible color names; see section Specifying Window Colors.     To change the root window color to blue violet, type:   5. The X Window System   75            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ xsetroot −solid blueviolet RET  To change the root window pattern, use the `−bitmap' option, and give the name of the bitmap file to use.    To tile the root window with a star pattern, type:  $ xsetroot −bitmap  usr X11R6 include bitmaps star RET  When specifying a pattern, use the `−fg' and `−bg' options to specify the foreground and background colors.    To tile the root window with a light slate gray star pattern on a black background, type  all on one line :  $ xsetroot −fg slategray2 −bg black −bitmap  usr X11R6 include bitmaps star RET   Use xsetroot with the special `−gray' option to change the root window to a shade of gray designed to be easy on the eyes, with no pattern.    To make the root window a gray color with no pattern, type:  $ xsetroot −gray RET  NOTE: You can also put an image in the window  although this consumes memory that could be spared for a memory−hogging Web browser instead; but see Putting an Image in the Root Window, for how to do it .

Files and Directories  This chapter discusses the basic tools for manipulating files and directories−−tools that are among the most essential on a Linux system.  A file is a collection of data that is stored on disk and that can be manipulated as a single unit by its name.  A directory is a file that acts as a folder for other files. A directory can also contain other directories  subdirectories ; a directory that contains another directory is called the parent directory of the directory it contains.  A directory tree includes a directory and all of its files, including the contents of all subdirectories.  Each directory is a "branch" in the "tree."  A slash character alone  ` '  is the name of the root directory at the base of the directory tree hierarchy; it is the trunk from which all other files or directories branch.  The following image shows an abridged version of the directory hierarchy.   6. Files and Directories   79   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   To represent a directory's place in the file hierarchy, specify all of the directories between it and the root directory, using a slash  ` '  as the delimiter to separate directories. So the directory `dict' as it appears   6. Files and Directories   80   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   in the preceding illustration would be represented as ` usr dict'.  Each user has a branch in the ` home' directory for their own files, called their home directory. The hierarchy in the previous illustration has two home directories: `joe' and `jon', both subdirectories of ` home'.  When you are in a shell, you are always in a directory on the system, and that directory is called the current working directory. When you first log in to the system, your home directory is the current working directory.  Whenever specifying a file name as an argument to a tool or application, you can give the slash−delimited path name relative to the current working directory. For example, if ` home joe' is the current working directory, you can use work to specify the directory ` home joe work', and work schedule to specify `schedule', a file in the ` home joe work' directory.  Every directory has two special files whose names consist of one and two periods: `..' refers to the parent of the current working directory, and `.' refers to the current working directory itself. If the current working directory is ` home joe', you can use `.' to specify ` home joe' and `..' to specify ` home'. Furthermore, you can specify the ` home jon' directory as .. jon.  Another way to specify a file name is to specify a slash−delimited list of all of the directory branches from the root directory  ` '  down to the file to specify. This unique, specific path from the root directory to a file is called the file's full path name.  When referring to a file that is not a directory, this is sometimes called the absolute file name .  You can specify any file or directory on the system by giving its full path name. A file can have the same name as other files in different directories on the system, but no two files or directories can share a full path name. For example, user joe can have a file `schedule' in his ` home joe work' directory and a file `schedule' in his ` home joe play' directory. While both files have the same name  `schedule' , they are contained in different directories, and each has a unique full path name−−−` home joe work schedule' and ` home joe play schedule'.  However, you don't have to type the full path name of a tool or application in order to start it. The shell keeps a list of directories, called the path, where it searches for programs. If a program is "in your path," or in one of these directories, you can run it simply by typing its name.  By default, the path includes ` bin' and ` usr bin'. For example, the who command is in the ` usr bin' directory, so its full path name is  usr bin who. Since the ` usr bin' directory is in the path, you can type who to run  usr bin who, no matter what the current working directory is.  The following table describes some of the standard directories on Linux systems.  DIRECTORY DESCRIPTION    The ancestor of all directories on the system; all other directories are subdirectories of this directory, either directly or through other subdirectories. Essential tools and other programs  or binaries . Files representing the system's various hardware devices. For example, you use the file ` dev cdrom' to access the CD−ROM drive. Miscellaneous system configuration files, startup files, etcetera. The home directories for all of the system's users.   bin  dev   etc  home   6.

File names are almost always all lowercase letters.  Linux does not force you to use file extensions, but it is convenient and useful to give files proper extensions, since they will help you to identify file types at a glance. You can have files with multiple extensions, such as `long.file.with.many.extensions', and you can have files with none at all, such as `myfile'. A JPEG image file, for example, does not have to have a `.jpg' or `.jpeg' extension, and program files do not need a special extension to make them work.  The file name before any file extensions is called the base file name. For example, the base file name of `house.jpeg' is `house'.  Some commonly used file extensions are shown in the following table, including extensions for text and graphics files.  See Converting Images between Formats, for more extensions used with image files, and see Playing a Sound File, for extensions used with sound files.

Files and Directories   83   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    6.1.1 Making an Empty File  You may sometimes want to create a new, empty file as a kind of "placeholder." To do so, give the name that you want to use for the file as an argument to touch.    To create the file `a_fresh_start' in the current directory, type:  $ touch a_fresh_start RET    To create the file `another_empty_file' in the `work completed' subdirectory of the current directory, type:  $ touch work completed another_empty_file RET  This tool "touches" the files you give as arguments. If a file does not exist, it creates it; if the file already exists, it changes the modification timestamp on the file to the current date and time, just as if you had used the file.  NOTE: Often, you make a file when you edit it, such as when in a text or image or sound editor; in that case, you don't need to make the file first.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.1.2 Making a Directory  Use mkdir  "make directory"  to make a new directory, giving the path name of the new directory as an argument. Directory names follow the same conventions as used with other files−−that is, no spaces, slashes, or other unusual characters are recommended.    To make a new directory called `work' in the current working directory, type:    To make a new directory called `work' in the ` tmp' directory, type:  $ mkdir work RET  $ mkdir  tmp work RET              [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6. Files and Directories   84   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    6.1.3 Making a Directory Tree  Use mkdir with the `−p' option to make a subdirectory and any of its parents that do not already exist. This is useful when you want to make a fairly complex directory tree from scratch, and don't want to have to make each directory individually.    To make the `work completed 2001' directory−−a subdirectory of the `completed' directory, which in turn is a subdirectory of the `work' directory in the current directory, type:  $ mkdir −p work completed 2001 RET  This makes a `2001' subdirectory in the directory called `completed', which in turn is in a directory called `work' in the current directory; if the `completed' or the `work' directories do not already exist, they are made as well  if you know that `work' and `completed' both exist, the above command works fine without the `−p' option .  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.2 Changing Directories  Use cd to change the current working directory; give the name of the new directory as an argument.    To change the current working directory to `work', a subdirectory in the current directory, type:    To change to the current directory's parent directory, type:  $ cd work RET  $ cd .. RET  You can also give the full path name of a directory.    To change the current working directory to ` usr doc', type:  $ cd  usr doc RET  This command makes ` usr doc' the current working directory.               6.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.2.1 Changing to Your Home Directory  With no arguments, cd makes your home directory the current working directory.    To make your home directory the current working directory, type:  $ cd RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.2.2 Changing to the Last Directory You Visited  To return to the last directory you were in, use cd and give `−' as the directory name. For example, if you are in the ` home mrs work samples' directory, and you use cd to change to some other directory, then at any point while you are in this other directory you can type cd − to return the current working directory to ` home mrs work samples'.    To return to the directory you were last in, type:  $ cd − RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.2.3 Getting the Name of the Current Directory  To determine what the current working directory is, use pwd  "print working directory" , which lists the full path name of the current working directory.   6. Files and Directories   86                     The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To determine what the current working directory is, type:  $ pwd RET  home mrs $  In this example, pwd output the text ` home mrs', indicating that the current working directory is ` home mrs'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.3 Listing Directories  @sf{Debian}: `mc' @sf{Debian}: `mozilla' @sf{WWW}: http:  www.gnome.org mc  @sf{WWW}: http:  www.mozilla.org   Use ls to list the contents of a directory. It takes as arguments the names of the directories to list. With no arguments, ls lists the contents of the current working directory.    To list the contents of the current working directory, type:  $ ls RET apple   cherry  orange $  In this example, the current working directory contains three files: `apple', `cherry', and `orange'.    To list the contents of `work', a subdirectory in the current directory, type:    To list the contents of the ` usr doc' directory, type:  $ ls work RET  $ ls  usr doc RET  You cannot discern file types from the default listing; directories and executables are indistinguishable from all other files. Using the `−F' option, however, tells ls to place a ` ' character after the names of subdirectories and a `*' character after the names of executable files.    To list the contents of the directory so that directories and executables are distinguished from other   6. Files and Directories   87   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   files, type:     $ ls −F RET repeat* test1   test2   words  $  In this example, the current directory contains an executable file named `repeat', a directory named `words', and some other files named `test1' and `test2'.  Another way to list the contents of directories−−and one I use all the time, when I'm in X and when I also want to look at image files in those directories−−is to use Mozilla or some other Web browser as a local file browser. Use the prefix 16 file:  to view local files. Alone, it opens a directory listing of the root directory; file: home joe opens a directory listing of user joe's home directory, file: usr local src opens the local source code directory, and so on. Directory listings will be rendered in HTML on the fly in almost all browsers, so you can click on subdirectories to traverse to them, and click on files to open them in the browser.  Yet another way to list the contents of directories is to use a "file manager" tool, of which there are at least a few on Linux; the most popular of these is probably the "Midnight Commander," or mc.  The following subsections describe some commonly used options for controlling which files ls lists and what information about those files ls outputs. It is one of the most often used file commands on Unix−like systems.  6.3.1 Listing File Attributes 6.3.2 Listing Directories Recursively 6.3.3 Listing Newest Files First 6.3.4 Listing Hidden Files 6.3.5 Listing Directories in Color 6.3.6 Listing Directory Tree Graphs 6.3.7 Additional Directory Listing Options     Listing file attributes.    Listing directories and their subdirectories.    Listing newest files first.    Listing hidden or special files.    Directory listings in color.    Listing an entire directory tree.     Popular options for the ls command.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.3.1 Listing File Attributes  Use ls with the `−l'  "long"  option to output a more extensive directory listing−−one that contains each file's size in bytes, last modification time, file type, and ownership and permissions  see section File Ownership .    To output a verbose listing of the ` usr doc bash' directory, type:   6. Files and Directories   88   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ ls −l  usr doc bash RET  total 72 −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root     13744 Oct 19 22:57 CHANGES.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root      1816 Oct 19 22:57 COMPAT.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root     16398 Oct 19 22:57 FAQ.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root      2928 Oct 19 22:57 INTRO.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root      4751 Oct 19 22:57 NEWS.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root      1588 Oct 19 22:57 POSIX.NOTES.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root      2718 Oct 19 22:57 README.Debian.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root     19596 Oct 19 22:57 changelog.gz −rw−r−−r−−   1 root    root      1446 Oct 19 22:57 copyright drwxr−xr−x   9 root    root      1024 Jul 25  1997 examples $  This command outputs a verbose listing of the files in ` usr doc bash'. The first line of output gives the total amount of disk space, in 1024−byte blocks, that the files take up  in this example, 72 . Each subsequent line displays several columns of information about one file.  The first column displays the file's type and permissions. The first character in this column specifies the file type; the hyphen  `−'  is the default and means that the file is a regular file. Directories are denoted by `d', and symbolic links  see section Giving a File More than One Name  are denoted by `l'. The remaining nine characters of the first column show the file permissions  see section Controlling Access to Files . The second column lists the number of hard links to the file. The third and fourth columns give the names of the user and group that the file belongs to. The fifth column gives the size of the file in bytes, the sixth column gives the date and time of last modification, and the last column gives the file name.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.3.2 Listing Directories Recursively  Use the `−R' option to list a directory recursively, which outputs a listing of that directory and all of its subdirectories.    To output a recursive directory listing of the current directory, type:     $ ls −R RET play    work  play: notes  work: notes $  In this example, the current working directory contains two subdirectories, `work' and `play', and no other files. Each subdirectory contains a file called `notes'.   6. Files and Directories   89   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list all of the files on the system, type:  $ ls −R   RET  This command recursively lists the contents of the root directory, ` ', and all of its subdirectories. It is common to combine this with the attribute option, `−l', to output a verbose listing of all the files on the system:     $ ls −lR   RET  NOTE: You can't list the contents of some directories on the system if you don't have permission to do so  see section Controlling Access to Files .  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.3.3 Listing Newest Files First  Use the `−t' option with ls to sort a directory listing so that the newest files are listed first.    To list all of the files in the ` usr tmp' directory sorted with newest first, type:  $ ls −t  usr tmp RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.3.4 Listing Hidden Files  By default, ls does not output files that begin with a period character  `.' . To reduce clutter, many applications "hide" configuration files in your home directory by giving them names that begin with a period; these are called dot files, or sometimes "hidden" files. As mentioned earlier, every directory has two special dot files: `..', the parent directory, and `.', the directory itself.  To list all contents of a directory, including these dot files, use the `−a' option.    To list all files in the current directory, type:  $ ls −a RET   6. Files and Directories   90            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Use the `−A' option to list almost all files in the directory: it lists all files, including dot files, with the exception of `..' and `.'.    To list all files in the current directory except for `..' and `.', type:     $ ls −A RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.3.5 Listing Directories in Color  Use ls with the `−−color' option to list the directory contents in color; files appear in different colors depending on their content. Some of the default color settings include displaying directory names in blue, text files in white, executable files in green, and links in turquoise.    To list the files in the root directory in color, type:  NOTE: It's common practice to create a command alias that substitutes `ls −−color' for `ls', so that typing just ls outputs a color listing. To learn more about making aliases, see Making a Command Alias.

Files and Directories   91               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To output a tree graph of the current directory and all its subdirectories, type:  $ tree RET . −− projects    −− current    `−− old        −− 1        `−− 2 `−− trip     `−− schedule.txt  4 directories, 3 files $  In the preceding example, a tree graph is drawn showing the current directory, which contains the two directories `projects' and `trip'; the `projects' directory in turn contains the directories `current' and `old'.  To output a tree graph of a specific directory tree, give the name of that directory tree as an argument.    To output a tree graph of your home directory and all its subdirectories, type:  $ tree ~ RET  To output a graph of a directory tree containing directory names only, use the `−d' option. This is useful for outputting a directory tree of the entire system, or for getting a picture of a particular directory tree.    To output a tree graph of the entire system to the file `tree', type:  $ tree −d   62; tree RET    To peruse a tree graph of the ` usr local' directory tree, type:  $ tree −d  usr local less RET  NOTE: Another tool for outputting directory trees is described in Listing a File's Disk Usage.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.3.7 Additional Directory Listing Options  The ls tool has many options to control the files listed and the information given for each file; the following table describes some of them.  The options are case sensitive.    6. Files and Directories   92   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   OPTION DESCRIPTION −−color Colorize the names of files depending on their type. −R −a −d −f −l −r −s −t  Produce a recursive listing. List all files in a directory, including hidden, or "dot," files. List directories by name instead of listing their contents. Do not sort directory contents; list them in the order they are written on the disk. Produce a verbose listing. Sort directory contents in reverse order. Output the size−−as an integer in 1K blocks−−of each file to the left of the file name. Sort output by timestamp instead of alphabetically, so the newest files are listed first.  NOTE: You can combine any of these options; for example, to list the contents of a directory sorted newest first, and display all attributes, use `−lt'. To recursively list all hidden files and display all attributes, use `−lRa'. It doesn't matter what order you put the options in−−so `−lRa' is the same as, say, `−alR'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.4 Copying Files and Directories  Use cp  "copy"  to copy files. It takes two arguments: the source file, which is the existing file to copy, and the target file, which is the file name for the new copy. cp then makes an identical copy of the source file, giving it the specified target name. If a file with the target name already exists, cp overwrites it. It does not alter the source file.    To copy the file `my−copy' to the file `neighbor−copy', type:  $ cp my−copy neighbor−copy RET  This command creates a new file called `neighbor−copy' that is identical to `my−copy' in every respect except for its name, owner, group, and timestamp−−the new file has a timestamp that shows the time when it was copied. The file `my−copy' is not altered.  Use the `−p'  "preserve"  option to preserve all attributes of the original file, including its timestamp, owner, group, and permissions.    To copy the file `my−copy' to the file `neighbor−copy', preserving all of the attributes of the source file in the target file, type:  $ cp −p my−copy neighbor−copy RET         6. Files and Directories   93   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   This command copies the file `my−copy' to a new file called `neighbor−copy' that is identical to `my−copy' in every respect except for its name.  To copy a directory along with the files and subdirectories it contains, use the −R option−−it makes a recursive copy of the specified directory and its entire contents.    To copy the directory `public_html', and all of its files and subdirectories, to a new directory called `private_html', type:  $ cp −R public_html private_html RET  The `−R' option does not copy files that are symbolic links  see section Giving a File More than One Name , and it does not retain all original permissions. To recursively copy a directory including links, and retain all of its permissions, use the `−a'  "archive"  option. This is useful for making a backup copy of a large directory tree.    To make an archive copy of the directory tree `public_html' to the directory `private_html', type:  $ cp −a public_html private_html RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.5 Moving Files and Directories  Use the mv  "move"  tool to move, or rename, a file or directory to a different location. It takes two arguments: the name of the file or directory to move followed by the path name to move it to. If you move a file to a directory that contains a file of the same name, the file is overwritten.    To move the file `notes' in the current working directory to `.. play', type:  $ mv notes .. play RET  This command moves the file `notes' in the current directory to `play', a subdirectory of the current working directory's parent. If a file `notes' already exists in `play', that file is overwritten. If the subdirectory `play' does not exist, this command moves `notes' to its parent directory and renames it `play'.  To move a file or directory that is not in the current directory, give its full path name as an argument.            6. Files and Directories   94   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To move the file ` usr tmp notes' to the current working directory, type:  $ mv  usr tmp notes . RET  This command moves the file ` usr tmp notes' to the current working directory.  To move a directory, give the path name of the directory you want to move and the path name to move it to as arguments.    To move the directory `work' in the current working directory to `play', type:  $ mv work play RET  This command moves the directory `work' in the current directory to the directory `play'. If the directory `play' already exists, mv puts `work' inside `play'−−−it does not overwrite directories.  Renaming a file is the same as moving it; just specify as arguments the file to rename followed by the new file name.    To rename the file `notes' to `notes.old', type:  $ mv notes notes.old RET  6.5.1 Changing File Names to Lowercase 6.5.2 Renaming Multiple Files with the Same Extension     Changing the case of a file.

It takes as arguments the files whose names it should change.    To change the file names of all of the files in the current directory to lowercase letters, type:  $ chcase * RET   6. Files and Directories   95               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Use the `−u' option to change file names to all uppercase letters.    To change file names of all of the files with a `.dos' extension in the `~ tmp' directory to all uppercase letters, type:  $ chcase −u ~ tmp *.dos RET  By default, chcase does not rename directories; use the `−d' option to rename directories as well as other files. The `−r' option recursively descends into any subdirectories and renames those files, too.    To change all of the files and subdirectory names in the current directory to all lowercase letters, type:    To change all of the files and subdirectory names in the current directory to all uppercase letters, and descend recursively into all subdirectories, type:    To change all of the files in the current directory to all lowercase letters, and descend recursively into all subdirectories  but do not change any directory names , type:  $ chcase −d * RET  $ chcase −d −r −u * RET  $ chcase −r * RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.5.2 Renaming Multiple Files with the Same Extension  @sf{WWW}: http:  eternity.2y.net chcase  To give a different file name extension to a group of files that share the same file name extension, use chcase with the `−x' option for specifying a Perl expression; give the patterns to match the source and target files as a quoted argument.  For example, you can rename all file names ending in `.htm' to end in `.html' by giving `s htm html ' as the expression to use.    To rename all of the files in the current directory with a `.htm' extension to `.html', type:                  6. Files and Directories   96   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   $ chcase −x 's htm html ' '*.htm' RET  By default, chcase will not overwrite files; so if you want to rename `index.htm' to `index.html', and both files already exist in the current directory, the above example will do nothing. Use the `−o' option to specify that existing files may be overwritten.    To rename all of the files in the current directory with a `.htm' extension to `.html' and overwrite any existing files, type:  $ chcase −o −x 's htm html ' '*.htm' RET  NOTE: Renaming multiple files at once is a common request.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.6 Removing Files and Directories  Use rm  "remove"  to delete a file and remove it from the system. Give the name of the file to remove as an argument.    To remove the file `notes' in the current working directory, type:  To remove a directory and all of the files and subdirectories it contains, use the `−R'  "recursive"  option.    To remove the directory `waste' and all of its contents, type:  $ rm notes RET  $ rm −R waste RET  To remove an empty directory, use rmdir; it removes the empty directories you specify. If you specify a directory that contains files or subdirectories, rmdir reports an error.    To remove the directory `empty', type:  $ rmdir empty RET              6.6.1 Removing a File with a Strange Name     Removing files with strange names.   6. Files and Directories   97   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   6.6.2 A Safe Way to Remove a File     A safer way to remove files.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6.6.1 Removing a File with a Strange Name  Files with strange characters in their names  like spaces, control characters, beginning hyphens, and so on  pose a problem when you want to remove them. There are a few solutions to this problem.  One way is to use tab completion to complete the name of the file  see section Letting the Shell Complete What You Type . This works when the name of the file you want to remove has enough characters to uniquely identify it so that completion can work.    To use tab completion to remove the file `No Way' in the current directory, type:  $ rm NoTAB Way RET  In the above example, after TAB was typed, the shell filled in the rest of the file name  ` Way' .  When a file name begins with a control character or other strange character, specify the file name with a file name pattern that uniquely identifies it  see section Specifying File Names with Patterns, for tips on building file name patterns . Use the `−i' option to verify the deletion.    To delete the file `^Acat' in a directory that also contains the files `cat' and `dog', type:  $ rm −i ?cat RET rm: remove `^Acat'? y RET $  In the above example, the expansion pattern `?cat' matches the file `^Acat' and no other files in the directory. The `−i' option was used because, in some cases, no unique pattern can be made for a file−−for example, if this directory also contained a file called `1cat', the above rm command would also attempt to remove it; with the `−i' option, you can answer n to it.  These first two methods will not work with files that begin with a hyphen character, because rm will interpret such a file name as an option; to remove such a file, use the `−−' option−−it specifies that what follows are arguments and not options.    To remove the file `−cat' from the current directory, type:  $ rm −− −cat RET   6.

Although if you can unmount the filesystem that contained the file immediately after you deleted the file, a wizard might be able to help reconstruct the lost file by using grep to search the filesystem device file.   A safer way to remove files is to use del, which is simply an alias to rm with the `−i' option. This specifies for rm to run in interactive mode and confirm the deletion of each file. It may be good practice to get in the habit of using del all the time, so that you don't make an accidental slip and rm an important file.  NOTE: Question 3.6 in the Unix FAQ  see ` usr doc FAQ unix−faq−part3'  discusses this issue, and gives a shell script called can that you can use in place of rm−−−it puts files in a "trashcan" directory instead of removing them; you then periodically empty out the trashcan with rm.

There are two kinds of links: hard links and symbolic links. A hard link is another name for an existing file; there is no difference between the link and the original file. So if you make a hard link from file `foo' to file `bar', and then remove file `bar', file `foo' is also removed. Each file has at least one hard link, which is the original file name itself. Directories always have at least two hard links−−the directory name itself  which appears in its parent directory  and the special file `.' inside the directory. Likewise, when you make a new subdirectory, the parent directory gains a new hard link for the special file `..' inside the new subdirectory.  A symbolic link  sometimes called a "symlink" or "soft link"  passes most operations−−such as reading and writing−−to the file it points to, just as a hard link does. However, if you remove a symlink, you remove only the symlink itself, and not the original file.  Use ln  "link"  to make links between files. Give as arguments the name of the source file to link from and the name of the new file to link to. By default, ln makes hard links.    To create a hard link from `seattle' to `emerald−city', type:      6. Files and Directories   99   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   $ ln seattle emerald−city RET  This command makes a hard link from an existing file, `seattle', to a new file, `emerald−city'. You can read and edit file `emerald−city' just as you would `seattle'; any changes you make to `emerald−city' are also written to `seattle'  and vice versa . If you remove the file `emerald−city', file `seattle' is also removed.  To create a symlink instead of a hard link, use the `−s' option.    To create a symbolic link from `seattle' to `emerald−city', type:     $ ln −s seattle emerald−city RET  After running this command, you can read and edit `emerald−city'; any changes you make to `emerald−city' will be written to `seattle'  and vice versa . But if you remove the file `emerald−city', the file `seattle' will not be removed.

You can use them when specifying file and directory names as arguments to any tool or application.  The following table lists the various file expansion characters and their meaning.  CHARACTER DESCRIPTION *  The asterisk matches a series of zero or more characters, and is sometimes called the "wildcard" character. For example, * alone matches all file names, a* matches all file names that consist of an `a' character followed by zero or more characters, and a*b matches all file names that begin with an `a' character and end with a `b' character, with any  or no  characters in between. The question mark matches exactly one character. Therefore, ? alone matches all file names with exactly one character, ?? matches all file names with exactly two characters, and a? matches any file name that begins with an `a' character and has exactly one character following it. Square brackets match one character in list. For example, [ab] matches exactly two file names: `a' and `b'. The pattern c[io] matches `ci' and `co', but no other file names. The tilde character expands to your home directory. For example, if your username is joe and therefore your home directory is ` home joe', then `~' expands to ` home joe'. You can follow the tilde with a path to specify a file in your home directory−−for example, `~ work' expands to ` home joe work'.  ?  ~  [list]   6. Files and Directories   100   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Brackets also have special meaning when used in conjunction with other characters, as described by the following table.  CHARACTER DESCRIPTION −  !  A hyphen as part of a bracketed list denotes a range of characters to match−−so [a−m] matches any of the lowercase letters from `a' through `m'. To match a literal hyphen character, use it as the first or last character in the list. For example, a[−b]c matches the files `a−c' and `abc'. Put an exclamation point at the beginning of a bracketed list to match all characters except those listed. For example, a[!b]c matches all files that begin with an `a' character, end with a `c' character, and have any one character, except a `b' character, in between; it matches `aac', `a−c', `adc', and so on.  You can combine these special expansion characters in any combination, and you can specify more than one pattern as multiple arguments. The following examples show file expansion in action using commands described in this chapter.    To list all files in the ` usr bin' directory that have the text `tex' anywhere in their name, type:    To copy all files whose names end with `.txt' to the `doc' subdirectory, type:  $ ls  usr bin *tex* RET  $ cp *.txt doc RET    To output a verbose listing of all files whose names end with either a `.txt' or `.text' extension, sorting the list so that newer files are listed first, type:  $ ls −lt *.txt *.text RET    To move all files in the ` usr tmp' directory whose names consist of the text `song' followed by an integer from 0 to 9 and a `.cdda' extension, placing them in a directory `music' in your home directory, type:  $ mv  usr tmp song[0−9].cdda ~ music RET    To remove all files in the current working directory that begin with a hyphen and have the text `out' somewhere else in their file name, type:  $ rm −− −*out* RET    To concatenate all files whose names consist of an `a' character followed by two or more characters, type:   6.

The lynx tool is very good for browsing files on the system−−give the name of the directory to browse, and lynx will display a listing of available files and directories in that directory.  You can use the cursor keys to browse and press RET on a subdirectory to traverse to that directory; lynx can display plain text files, compressed text files, and files written in HTML; it's useful for browsing system documentation in the ` usr doc' and ` usr share doc' directories, where many software packages come with help files and manuals written in HTML.    To browse the system documentation files in the ` usr doc' directory, type:  $ lynx  usr doc RET  For more about using lynx, see Reading Text from the Web.  With Mozilla and some other browsers you must precede the full path name with the `file: ' URN−−so the ` usr doc' directory would be `file:  usr doc'. With lynx, just give a local path name as an argument.    To browse the system documentation files in the ` usr doc' directory in Mozilla, type the following in Mozilla's Location window:        file:  usr doc  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   6. Files and Directories   102    7. Sharing Files  Groups, file ownership, and access permissions are Linux features that enable users to share files with one another. But even if you don't plan on sharing files with other users on your system, familiarity with these concepts will help you understand how file access and security work in Linux.  7.1 Groups and How to Work in Them    How users can work together in groups. 7.2 File Ownership 7.3 Controlling Access to Files     Who owns a file?    Who has permission to access a file?  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7.1 Groups and How to Work in Them  A group is a set of users, created to share files and to facilitate collaboration. Each member of a group can work with the group's files and make new files that belong to the group. The system administrator can add new groups and give users membership to the different groups, according to the users' organizational needs. For example, a system used by the crew of a ship might have groups such as galley, deck, bridge, and crew; the user captain might be a member of all the groups, but user steward might be a member of only the galley and crew groups.  On a Linux system, you're always a member of at least one group: your login group. You are the only member of this group, and its group name is the same as your username.  Let's look at how to manage your group memberships.  7.1.1 Listing the Groups a User Belongs To 7.1.2 Listing the Members of a Group     Listing the groups a user is a member of.

Give a username as an argument, and groups outputs a line containing that username followed by all of the groups the user is a member of. With no arguments, groups lists your own username and group memberships.   7. Sharing Files   103            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list your group memberships, type:  $ groups RET steward galley crew $  In this example, three groups are output: steward  the user's login group , galley, and crew.    To list the group memberships of user blackbeard, type:  $ groups blackbeard RET blackbeard : blackbeard $  In this example, the command outputs the given username, blackbeard, followed by the name of one group, blackbeard, indicating that user blackbeard belongs to only one group: his login group.

Sharing Files   104   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    7.2 File Ownership  Every file belongs to both a user and a group−−usually to the user who created it and to the group the user was working in at the time  which is almost always the user's login group . File ownership determines the type of access users have to particular files  see section Controlling Access to Files .  7.2.1 Determining the Ownership of a File 7.2.2 Changing the Ownership of a File     Who owns a file?

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7.2.1 Determining the Ownership of a File  To find out which user and group own a particular file, use ls with the `−l' option to list the file's attributes  see section Listing File Attributes . The name of the user who owns the file appears in the third column of the output, and the name of the group that owns the file appears in the fourth column.  For example, suppose the verbose listing for a file called `cruise' looks like this:     −rwxrw−r−−      1 captain   crew        8,420 Jan 12 21:42 cruise  The user who owns this file is captain, and the group that owns it is crew.  NOTE: When you create a file, it normally belongs to you and to your login group, but you can change its ownership, as described in the next recipe. You normally own all of the files in your home directory.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7.2.2 Changing the Ownership of a File  You can't give away a file to another user, but other users can make copies of a file that belongs to you, provided they have read permission for that file  see section Controlling Access to Files . When you make a copy of another user's file, you own the copy.  You can also change the group ownership of any file you own. To do this, use chgrp; it takes as arguments the name of the group to transfer ownership to and the names of the files to work on. You must be a member of the group you want to give ownership to.   7. Sharing Files   105   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To change the group ownership of file `cruise' to bridge, type:  $ chgrp bridge cruise RET        This command transfers group ownership of `cruise' to bridge; the file's group access permissions  see section Controlling Access to Files  now apply to the members of the bridge group.  Use the `−R' option to recursively change the group ownership of directories and all of their contents.    To give group ownership of the `maps' directory and all the files it contains to the bridge group, type:  $ chgrp −R bridge maps RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7.3 Controlling Access to Files  Each file has permissions that specify what type of access to the file users have. There are three kinds of permissions: read, write, and execute. You need read permission for a file to read its contents, write permission to write changes to or remove it, and execute permission to run it as a program.  Normally, users have write permission only for files in their own home directories. Only the superuser has write permission for the files in important directories, such as ` bin' and ` etc'−−−so as a regular user, you never have to worry about accidentally writing to or removing an important system file.  Permissions work differently for directories than for other kinds of files. Read permission for a directory means that you can see the files in the directory; write permission lets you create, move, or remove files in the directory; and execute permission lets you use the directory name in a path  see section Files and Directories .  If you have read permission but not execute permission for a directory, you can only read the names of files in that directory−−you can't read their other attributes, examine their contents, write to them, or execute them. With execute but not read permission for a directory, you can read, write to, or execute any file in the directory, provided that you know its name and that you have the appropriate permissions for that file.  Each file has separate permissions for three categories of users: the user who owns the file, all other members of the group that owns the file, and all other users on the system. If you are a member of the group that owns a file, the file's group permissions apply to you  unless you are the owner of the file, in which case the user permissions apply to you .  When you create a new file, it has a default set of permissions−−usually read and write for the user, and read for the group and all other users.  On some systems, the default permissions are read and write for both the user and group, and read for all other users.    7. Sharing Files   106   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   The file access permissions for a file are collectively called its access mode. The following sections describe how to list and change file access modes, including how to set the most commonly used access modes.  NOTE: The superuser, root, can always access any file on the system, regardless of its access permissions.  See Info file `fileutils.info', node `File permissions', for more information on file permissions and access modes.  7.3.1 Listing the Permissions of a File 7.3.2 Changing the Permissions of a File 7.3.3 Write−Protecting a File 7.3.4 Making a File Private 7.3.5 Making a File Public 7.3.6 Making a File Executable     Listing the permissions a file has.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7.3.1 Listing the Permissions of a File  To list a file's access permissions, use ls with the `−l' option  see section Listing File Attributes . File access permissions appear in the first column of the output, after the character for file type.  For example, consider the verbose listing of the file `cruise':     −rwxrw−r−−      1 captain   crew        8,420 Jan 12 21:42 cruise  The first character  `−'  is the file type; the next three characters  `rwx'  specify permissions for the user who owns the file; and the next three  `rw−'  specify permissions for all members of the group that owns the file except for the user who owns it. The last three characters in the column  `r−−'  specify permissions for all other users on the system.  All three permissions sections have the same format, indicating from left to right, read, write, and execute permission with `r', `w', and `x' characters. A hyphen  `−'  in place of one of these letters indicates that permission is not given.  In this example, the listing indicates that the user who owns the file, captain, has read, write, and execute permission, and the group that owns the file, crew, has read and write permission. All other users on the system have only read permission.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7. Sharing Files   107   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    7.3.2 Changing the Permissions of a File  To change the access mode of any file you own, use the chmod  "change mode"  tool. It takes two arguments: an operation, which specifies the permissions to grant or revoke for certain users, and the names of the files to work on.  To build an operation, first specify the category or categories of users as a combination of the following characters:  CHARACTER CATEGORY u g o a  The user who owns the file. All other members of the file's group. All other users on the system. All users on the system; this is the same as `ugo'.  Follow this with the operator denoting the action to take:  OPERATOR ACTION + − =  Add permissions to the user's existing permissions. Remove permissions from the user's existing permissions. Make these the only permissions the user has for this file.  Finally, specify the permissions themselves:  CHARACTER PERMISSION r w x  Set read permission. Set write permission. Set execute permission.  For example, use `u+w' to add write permission to the existing permissions for the user who owns the file, and use `a+rw' to add both read and write permissions to the existing permissions of all users.  You could also use `ugo+rw' instead of `a+rw'.

This effectively "write−protects" a file, preventing accidental changes to it. A write−protected file is sometimes called a "read only" file.  To write−protect a file so that no users other than yourself can write to it, use chmod with `go−w' as the   7. Sharing Files   108   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   operation.    To write−protect the file `cruise' so that no other users can change it, type:  $ chmod go−w cruise RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7.3.4 Making a File Private  To make a file private from all other users on the system, use chmod with `go=' as the operation. This revokes all group and other access permissions.    To make the file `cruise' private from all users but yourself, type:  $ chmod go= cruise RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   7.3.5 Making a File Public  To allow anyone with an account on the system to read and make changes to a file, use chmod with `a+rw' as the operation. This grants read and write permission to all users, making the file "public." When a file has read permission set for all users, it is called world readable, and when a file has write permission set for all users, it is called world writable.    To make the file `cruise' both world readable and world writable, type:  $ chmod a+rw cruise RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]            7. Sharing Files   109   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    7.3.6 Making a File Executable  An executable file is a file that you can run as a program. To change the permissions of a file so that all users can run it as a program, use chmod with `a+x' as the operation.    To give execute permission to all users for the file `myscript', type:     $ chmod a+x myscript RET  NOTE: Often, shell scripts that you obtain or write yourself do not have execute permission set, and you'll have to do this yourself.

Finding Files  Sometimes you will need to find files on the system that match given criteria, such as name and file size. This chapter will show you how to find a file when you know only part of the file name, and how to find a file whose name matches a given pattern. You will also learn how to list files and directories by their size and to find the locations of commands.  NOTE: When you want to find files in a directory whose contents match a particular pattern, search through the files with grep−−−see Searching Text. A method of searching for a given pattern in the contents of files in different directories is given in Running Commands on the Files You Find.  See Info file `find.info', node `Top', for more information on finding files.  8.1 Finding All Files That Match a Pattern 8.2 Finding Files in a Directory Tree 8.3 Finding Files in Directory Listings 8.4 Finding Where a Command Is Located    Locating a command.

Use it when you want to list all files on the system whose full path name matches a particular pattern−−for example, all files with the text `audio' somewhere in their full path name, or all files ending with `ogg'; locate outputs a list of all files on the system that match the pattern, giving their full path name. When specifying a pattern, you can use any of the file name expansion characters  see section Specifying File Names with Patterns .    To find all the files on the system that have the text `audio' anywhere in their name, type:  $ locate audio RET    To find all the files on the system whose file names end with the text `ogg', type:           $ locate *ogg RET    To find all hidden "dotfiles" on the system, type:   8. Finding Files   111   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   $ locate  . RET  NOTE:locate searches are not case sensitive.

Unlike most other tools, you must specify the directory tree argument before any other options.   You can specify a number of search criteria, and format the output in various ways; the following sections include recipes for the most commonly used find commands, as well as a list of find's most popular options.  8.2.1 Finding Files in a Directory Tree by Name 8.2.2 Finding Files in a Directory Tree by Size 8.2.3 Finding Files in a Directory Tree by Modification Time 8.2.4 Finding Files in a Directory Tree by Owner 8.2.5 Running Commands on the Files You Find     The basic find options.

Give the name of the directory tree to search through, and use the `−name' option followed by the name you want to find.    To list all files on the system whose file name is `top', type:     $ find   −name top RET   8. Finding Files   112   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   This command will search all directories on the system to which you have access; if you don't have execute permission for a directory, find will report that permission is denied to search the directory.  The `−name' option is case sensitive; use the similar `−iname' option to find name regardless of case.    To list all files on the system whose file name is `top', regardless of case, type:  $ find   −iname top RET  This command would match any files whose name consisted of the letters `top', regardless of case−−including `Top', `top', and `TOP'.  Use file expansion characters  see section Specifying File Names with Patterns  to find files whose names match a pattern. Give these file name patterns between single quotes.    To list all files on the system whose names begin with the characters `top', type:  $ find   −name 'top*' RET    To list all files whose names begin with the three characters `top' followed by exactly three more characters, type:  $ find   −name 'top???' RET    To list all files whose names begin with the three characters `top' followed by five or more characters, type:  $ find   −name 'top?????*' RET    To list all files in your home directory tree that end in `.tex', regardless of case, type:  $ find ~ −iname '*.tex' RET    To list all files in the ` usr share' directory tree with the text `farm' somewhere in their name, type:                    $ find  usr share −name '*farm*' RET  Use `−regex' in place of `−name' to search for files whose names match a regular expression, or a pattern describing a set of strings  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns .    To list all files in the current directory tree whose names have either the string `net' or   8. Finding Files   113                  The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   `comm' anywhere in their file names, type:  $ find . −regex '.*\ net\comm\ .*' RET  NOTE: The `−regex' option matches the whole path name, relative to the directory tree you specify, and not just file names.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.2.2 Finding Files in a Directory Tree by Size  To find files of a certain size, use the `−size' option, following it with the file size to match. The file size takes one of three forms: when preceded with a plus sign  `+' , it matches all files greater than the given size; when preceded with a hyphen or minus sign  `−' , it matches all files less than the given size; with neither prefix, it matches all files whose size is exactly as specified.  The default unit is 512−byte blocks; follow the size with `k' to denote kilobytes or `b' to denote bytes.     To list all files in the ` usr local' directory tree that are greater than 10,000 kilobytes in size, type:  $ find  usr local −size +10000k RET    To list all files in your home directory tree less than 300 bytes in size, type:  $ find ~ −size −300b RET    To list all files on the system whose size is exactly 42 512−byte blocks, type:  $ find   −size 42 RET  Use the `−empty' option to find empty files−−files whose size is 0 bytes. This is useful for finding files that you might not need, and can remove.    To find all empty files in your home directory tree, type:  $ find ~ −empty RET  NOTE: To find the largest or smallest files in a given directory, output a sorted listing of that directory  see section Finding Files in Directory Listings .   8. Finding Files   114   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.2.3 Finding Files in a Directory Tree by Modification Time  To find files last modified during a specified time, use find with the `−mtime' or `−mmin' options; the argument you give with `−mtime' specifies the number of 24−hour periods, and with `−mmin' it specifies the number of minutes.    To list the files in the ` usr local' directory tree that were modified exactly 24 hours ago, type:  $ find  usr local −mtime 1 RET    To list the files in the ` usr' directory tree that were modified exactly five minutes ago, type:  $ find  usr −mmin 5 RET  To specify a range of time, precede the number you give with either a plus sign  `+'  to match times that are equal to or greater than the given argument, or a hyphen or minus sign  `−'  to match times that are equal to or less than the given argument.    To list the files in the ` usr local' directory tree that were modified within the past 24 hours, type:  $ find  usr local −mtime −1 RET    To list the files in the ` usr' directory tree that were modified within the past five minutes, type:  $ find  usr −mmin −5 RET  Include the `−daystart' option to measure time from the beginning of the current day instead of 24 hours ago.    To list all of the files in your home directory tree that were modified yesterday, type:  $ find ~ −mtime 1 −daystart RET    To list all of the files in the ` usr' directory tree that were modified one year or longer ago, type:  $ find  usr −mtime +356 −daystart RET   8. Finding Files   115                     The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list all of the files in your home directory tree that were modified from two to four days ago, type:  $ find ~ −mtime 2 −mtime −4 −daystart RET  In the preceding example, the combined options `−mtime 2' and `−mtime −4' matched files that were modified between two and four days ago.  To find files newer than a given file, give the name of that file as an argument to the `−newer' option.    To find files in the ` etc' directory tree that are newer than the file ` etc motd', type:  $ find  etc −newer  etc motd RET  To find files newer than a given date, use the trick described in the find Info documentation: create a temporary file in ` tmp' with touch whose timestamp is set to the date you want to search for, and then specify that temporary file as the argument to `−newer'.    To list all files in your home directory tree that were modified after May 4 of the current year, type:  $ touch −t 05040000  tmp timestamp RET $ find ~ −newer  tmp timestamp RET  In this example, a temporary file called ` tmp timestamp' is written; after the search, you can remove it  see section Removing Files and Directories .  NOTE: You can also find files that were last accessed a number of days after they were modified by giving that number as an argument to the `−used' option. This is useful for finding files that get little use−−files matching `−used +100', say, were accessed 100 or more days after they were last modified.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.2.4 Finding Files in a Directory Tree by Owner  To find files owned by a particular user, give the username to search for as an argument to the `−user' option.    To list all files in the ` usr local fonts' directory tree owned by the user warwick, type:  $ find  usr local fonts −user warwick RET  The `−group' option is similar, but it matches group ownership instead of user ownership.   8. Finding Files   116               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list all files in the ` dev' directory tree owned by the audio group, type:  $ find  dev −group audio RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.2.5 Running Commands on the Files You Find  You can also use find to execute a command you specify on each found file, by giving the command as an argument to the `−exec' option. If you use the string `'{}'' in the command, this string is replaced with the file name of the current found file when the command executes. Mark the end of the command with the string `';''.    To find all files in the `~ html ' directory tree with an `.html' extension, and output lines from these files that contain the string `organic', type:  $ find ~ html  −name '*.html' −exec grep organic '{}' ';' RET  In this example, the command grep organic file is executed for each file that find finds, with file being the name of each file in turn.  To have find pause and confirm execution for each file it finds, use `−ok' instead of `−exec'.    To remove files from your home directory tree that were accessed more than one year after they were last modified, pausing to confirm before each removal, type:  $ find ~ −used +365 −ok rm '{}' ';' RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.2.6 Finding Files by Multiple Criteria  You can combine many of find's options to find files that match multiple criteria.    To list files in your home directory tree whose names begin with the string `top', and that are newer than the file ` etc motd', type:  $ find ~ −name 'top*' −newer  etc motd RET   8. Finding Files   117               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To compress all the files in your home directory tree that are two megabytes or larger, and that are not already compressed with gzip  having a `.gz' file name extension , type:     $ find ~ −size +2000000c −regex '.*[^gz]' −exec gzip '{}' ';' RET  The following tables describe many other options you can use with find. The first table lists and describes find's general options for specifying its behavior. As you will see, find can take many different options; see its man page or its info documentation for all of them.  DESCRIPTION Use the beginning of today rather than 24 hours previous for time criteria. Search the subdirectories before each directory. Output a help message and exit. Specify the maximum number of directory levels to descend in the specified directory tree.  OPTION −daystart −depth −help −maxdepth levels −mountor−xdev Do not descend directories that have another disk mounted on them. −version  Output the version number and exit.  The following table lists and describes find's options for specifying which files to find.  Specify the numeric arguments to these options in one of three ways: preceded with a plus sign  `+'  to match values equal to or greater than the given argument; preceded with a hyphen or minus sign  `−'  to match values equal to or less than the given argument; or give the number alone to match exactly that value.  DESCRIPTION Time in minutes since the file was last accessed.  File was accessed more recently than file.  Time in days since the file was last accessed.  Time in minutes since the file was last changed.  File was changed more recently than file.  Days since the file was last changed.  File is empty. Name of the group that owns file.  OPTION −amin minutes −anewer file −atime days −cmin minutes −cnewer file −ctime days −empty −group group −iname pattern −ipath pattern  Case−insensitive file name pattern to match  `report' matches the files `Report', `report', `REPORT', etc. .

They also show how to find the number of files in a given directory.  8.3.1 Finding the Largest Files in a Directory 8.3.2 Finding the Smallest Files in a Directory 8.3.3 Finding the Smallest Directories 8.3.4 Finding the Largest Directories 8.3.5 Finding the Number of Files in a Listing  Finding the largest files.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.3.1 Finding the Largest Files in a Directory  To find the largest files in a given directory, use ls to list its contents with the `−S' option, which sorts files in descending order by their size  normally, ls outputs files sorted alphabetically . Include the `−l' option to output the size and other file attributes.    To list the files in the current directory, with their attributes, sorted with the largest files first, type:     $ ls −lS RET   8. Finding Files   120   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: Pipe the output to less to peruse it  see section Perusing Text .  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.3.2 Finding the Smallest Files in a Directory  To list the contents of a directory with the smallest files first, use ls with both the `−S' and `−r' options, which reverses the sorting order of the listing.    To list the files in the current directory and their attributes, sorted from smallest to largest, type:  $ ls −lSr RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.3.3 Finding the Smallest Directories  To output a list of directories sorted by their size−−the size of all the files they contain−−use du and sort. The du tool outputs directories in ascending order with the smallest first; the `−S' option puts the size in kilobytes of each directory in the first column of output. Give the directory tree you want to output as an option, and pipe the output to sort with the `−n' option, which sorts its input numerically.    To output a list of the subdirectories of the current directory tree, sorted in ascending order by size, type:  $ du −S .  sort −n RET        [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.3.4 Finding the Largest Directories  Use the `−r' option with sort to reverse the listing and output the largest directories first.    To output a list of the subdirectories in the current directory tree, sorted in descending order by size, type:   8. Finding Files   121   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ du −S .  sort −nr RET    To output a list of the subdirectories in the ` usr local' directory tree, sorted in descending order by size, type:  $ du −S  usr local  sort −nr RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.3.5 Finding the Number of Files in a Listing  To find the number of files in a directory, use ls and pipe the output to `wc −l', which outputs the number of lines in its input  see section Counting Text .    To output the number of files in the current directory, type:  $ ls  wc −l RET      19 $  In this example, the command outputs the text `19', indicating that there are 19 files in the current directory.  Since ls does not list hidden files by default  see section Listing Hidden Files , the preceding command does not count them. Use ls's `−A' option to count dot files as well.    To count the number of files−−including dot files−−in the current directory, type:  $ ls −A  wc −l RET      81 $  This command outputs the text `81', indicating that there are 81 files, including hidden files, in the current directory.  To list the number of files in a given directory tree, and not just a single directory, use find instead of ls, giving the special find predicate `\! −type d' to exclude the listing  and therefore, counting  of directories.    To list the number of files in the ` usr share' directory tree, type:   8. Finding Files   122                        The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   $ find  usr share \! −type d  wc −l RET    To list the number of files and directories in the ` usr share' directory tree, type:  $ find  usr share  wc −l RET    To list the number of directories in the ` usr share' directory tree, type:  $ find  usr share \! −type f  wc −l RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8.4 Finding Where a Command Is Located  Use which to find the full path name of a tool or application from its base file name; when you give the base file name as an option, which outputs the absolute file name of the command that would have run had you typed it. This is useful when you are not sure whether or not a particular command is installed on the system.    To find out whether perl is installed on your system, and, if so, where it resides, type:  $ which perl RET  usr bin perl  In this example, which output ` usr bin perl', indicating that the perl binary is installed in the ` usr bin' directory.  NOTE: This is also useful for determining "which" binary would execute, should you type the name, since some systems may have different binaries of the same file name located in different directories. In that case, you can use which to find which one would execute.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   8. Finding Files   123    9. Managing Files  File management tools include those for splitting, comparing, and compressing files, making backup archives, and tracking file revisions. Other management tools exist for determining the contents of a file, and for changing its timestamp.  9.1 Determining File Type and Format 9.2 Changing File Modification Time 9.3 Splitting a File into Smaller Ones 9.4 Comparing Files 9.5 Compressed Files 9.6 File Archives 9.7 Tracking Revisions to a File  Splitting a file into smaller files.     Determining what kind of data is in a file.    Changing file timestamps.       Compare a group of files for similarities.    Compressing and expanding files.    All about file archives.    Tracking the revisions you make to a file.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.1 Determining File Type and Format  When we speak of a file's type, we are referring to the kind of data it contains, which may include text, executable commands, or some other data; this data is organized in a particular way in the file, and this organization is called its format. For example, an image file might contain data in the JPEG image format, or a text file might contain unformatted text in the English language or text formatted in the TeX markup language.  The file tool analyzes files and indicates their type and−−if known−−the format of the data they contain. Supply the name of a file as an argument to file and it outputs the name of the file, followed by a description of its format and type.    To determine the format of the file ` usr doc HOWTO README.gz', type:     $ file  usr doc HOWTO README.gz RET  usr doc HOWTO README.gz: gzip compressed data, deflated, original filename, last modified: Sun Apr 26 02:51:48 1998, os: Unix $  This command reports that the file ` usr doc HOWTO README.gz' contains data that has been compressed with the gzip tool.  To determine the original format of the data in a compressed file, use the `−z' option.   9. Managing Files   124   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To determine the format of the compressed data contained in the file ` usr doc HOWTO README.gz', type:     $ file −z  usr doc HOWTO README.gz RET  usr doc HOWTO README.gz: English text  gzip compressed data, deflated, original filename, last modified: Sun Apr 26 02:51:48 1998, os: Unix  $  This command reports that the data in ` usr doc HOWTO README.gz', a compressed file, is English text.  NOTE: Currently, file differentiates among more than 100 different data formats, including several human languages, many sound and graphics formats, and executable files for many different operating systems.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.2 Changing File Modification Time  Use touch to change a file's timestamp without modifying its contents. Give the name of the file to be changed as an argument. The default action is to change the timestamp to the current time.    To change the timestamp of file `pizzicato' to the current date and time, type:  $ touch pizzicato RET  To specify a timestamp other than the current system time, use the `−d' option, followed by the date and time that should be used enclosed in quote characters. You can specify just the date, just the time, or both.    To change the timestamp of file `pizzicato' to `17 May 1999 14:16', type:  $ touch −d '17 May 1999 14:16' pizzicato RET    To change the timestamp of file `pizzicato' to `14 May', type:  $ touch −d '14 May' pizzicato RET    To change the timestamp of file `pizzicato' to `14:16', type:  $ touch −d '14:16' pizzicato RET  NOTE: When only the date is given, the time is set to `0:00'; when no year is given, the current year is   9.

See Info file `fileutils.info', node `Date input formats', for more information on date input formats.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.3 Splitting a File into Smaller Ones  It's sometimes necessary to split one file into a number of smaller ones. For example, suppose you have a very large sound file in the near−CD−quality MPEG2, level 3  "MP3"  format. Your file, `large.mp3', is 4,394,422 bytes in size, and you want to transfer it from your desktop to your laptop, but your laptop and desktop are not connected on a network−−the only way to transfer files between them is by floppy disk. Because this file is much too large to fit on one floppy, you use split.  The split tool copies a file, chopping up the copy into separate files of a specified size. It takes as optional arguments the name of the input file  using standard input if none is given  and the file name prefix to use when writing the output files  using `x' if none is given . The output files' names will consist of the file prefix followed by a group of letters: `aa', `ab', `ac', and so on−−the default output file names would be `xaa', `xab', and so on.  Specify the number of lines to put in each output file with the `−l' option, or use the `−b' option to specify the number of bytes to put in each output file. To specify the output files' sizes in kilobytes or megabytes, use the `−b' option and append `k' or `m', respectively, to the value you supply. If neither `−l' nor `−b' is used, split defaults to using 1,000 lines per output file.    To split `large.mp3' into separate files of one megabyte each, whose names begin with `large.mp3.', type:  $ split −b1m large.mp3 large.mp3. RET  This command creates five new files whose names begin with `large.mp3.'. The first four files are one megabyte in size, while the last file is 200,118 bytes−−the remaining portion of the original file. No alteration is made to `large.mp3'.  You could then copy these five files onto four floppies  the last file fits on a floppy with one of the larger files , copy them all to your laptop, and then reconstruct the original file with cat  see section Concatenating Text .    To reconstruct the original file from the split files, type:  $ cat large.mp3.* 62; large.mp3 RET $ rm large.mp3.* RET         9. Managing Files   126   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   In this example, the rm tool is used to delete all of the split files after the original file has been reconstructed.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.4 Comparing Files  There are a number of tools for comparing the contents of files in different ways; these recipes show how to use some of them. These tools are especially useful for comparing passages of text in files, but that's not the only way you can use them.  9.4.1 Determining Whether Two Files Differ 9.4.2 Finding the Differences between Files 9.4.3 Patching a File with a Difference Report     Comparing two files to see if they differ.    Showing the differences between files.    Applying a difference report to a file.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.4.1 Determining Whether Two Files Differ  Use cmp to determine whether or not two text files differ. It takes the names of two files as arguments, and if the files contain the same data, cmp outputs nothing. If, however, the files differ, cmp outputs the byte position and line number in the files where the first difference occurs.    To determine whether the files `master' and `backup' differ, type:     $ cmp master backup RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.4.2 Finding the Differences between Files  Use diff to compare two files and output a difference report  sometimes called a "diff"  containing the text that differs between two files. The difference report is formatted so that other tools  namely, patch−−−see section Patching a File with a Difference Report  can use it to make a file identical to the one it was compared with.  To compare two files and output a difference report, give their names as arguments to diff.   9. Managing Files   127   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To compare the files `manuscript.old' and `manuscript.new', type:  $ diff manuscript.old manuscript.new RET  The difference report is output to standard output; to save it to a file, redirect the output to the file to save to:     $ diff manuscript.old manuscript.new 62; manuscript.diff RET  In the preceding example, the difference report is saved to a file called `manuscript.diff'.  The difference report is meant to be used with commands such as patch, in order to apply the differences to a file. See Info file `diff.info', node `Top', for more information on diff and the format of its output.  To better see the difference between two files, use sdiff instead of diff; instead of giving a difference report, it outputs the files in two columns, side by side, separated by spaces. Lines that differ in the files are separated by `'; lines that appear only in the first file end with a `<', and lines that appear only in the second file are preceded with a `>'.    To peruse the files `laurel' and `hardy' side by side on the screen, with any differences indicated between columns, type:  $ sdiff laurel hardy  less RET  To output the difference between three separate files, use diff3.    To output a difference report for files `larry', `curly', and `moe', and output it in a file called `stooges', type:  $ diff3 larry curly moe 62; stooges RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.4.3 Patching a File with a Difference Report  To apply the differences in a difference report to the original file compared in the report, use patch. It takes as arguments the name of the file to be patched and the name of the difference report file  or "patchfile" . It then applies the changes specified in the patchfile to the original file. This is especially useful for distributing different versions of a file−−small patchfiles may be sent across networks easier than large source files.    To update the original file `manuscript.new' with the patchfile `manuscript.diff', type:   9. Managing Files   128   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ patch manuscript.new manuscript.diff RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.5 Compressed Files  File compression is useful for storing or transferring large files. When you compress a file, you shrink it and save disk space. File compression uses an algorithm to change the data in the file; to use the data in a compressed file, you must first uncompress it to restore the original data  and original file size .  The following recipes explain how to compress and uncompress files.  9.5.1 Compressing a File    Making files smaller. 9.5.2 Decompressing a File    Making files bigger.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.5.1 Compressing a File  Use the gzip  "GNU zip"  tool to compress files. It takes as an argument the name of the file or files to be compressed; it writes a compressed version of the specified files, appends a `.gz' extension to their file names, and then deletes the original files.    To compress the file `war−and−peace', type:     $ gzip war−and−peace RET  This command compresses the file `war−and−peace', putting it in a new file named `war−and−peace.gz'; gzip then deletes the original file, `war−and−peace'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.5.2 Decompressing a File  To access the contents of a compressed file, use gunzip to decompress  or "uncompress"  it.   9. Managing Files   129   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Like gzip, gunzip takes as an argument the name of the file or files to work on. It expands the specified files, writing the output to new files without the `.gz' extensions, and then deletes the compressed files.    To expand the file `war−and−peace.gz', type:     $ gunzip war−and−peace.gz RET  This command expands the file `war−and−peace.gz' and puts it in a new file called `war−and−peace'; gunzip then deletes the compressed file, `war−and−peace.gz'.  NOTE: You can view a compressed text file without uncompressing it by using zless. This is useful when you want to view a compressed file but do not want to write changes to it.  For more information about zless, see section Perusing Text .

Archives are usually used to transfer or make a backup copy of a collection of files and directories−−this way, you can work with only one file instead of many. This single file can be easily compressed as explained in the previous section, and the files in the archive retain the structure and permissions of the original files.  Use the tar tool to create, list, and extract files from archives. Archives made with tar are sometimes called "tar files," "tar archives," or−−because all the archived files are rolled into one−−−"tarballs."  The following recipes show how to use tar to create an archive, list the contents of an archive, and extract the files from an archive. Two common options used with all three of these operations are `−f' and `−v': to specify the name of the archive file, use `−f' followed by the file name; use the `−v'  "verbose"  option to have tar output the names of files as they are processed. While the `−v' option is not necessary, it lets you observe the progress of your tar operation.  NOTE: The name of this tool comes from "tape archive," because it was originally made to write the archives directly to a magnetic tape device. It is still used for this purpose, but today, archives are almost always saved to a file on disk.  See Info file `tar.info', node `Top', for more information about managing archives with tar.  9.6.1 Creating a File Archive 9.6.2 Listing the Contents of an Archive 9.6.3 Extracting Files from an Archive     Creating an archive of files.

Managing Files   130   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.6.1 Creating a File Archive  To create an archive with tar, use the `−c'  "create"  option, and specify the name of the archive file to create with the `−f' option. It's common practice to use a name with a `.tar' extension, such as `my−backup.tar'.  Give as arguments the names of the files to be archived; to create an archive of a directory and all of the files and subdirectories it contains, give the directory's name as an argument.    To create an archive called `project.tar' from the contents of the `project' directory, type:  $ tar −cvf project.tar project RET  This command creates an archive file called `project.tar' containing the `project' directory and all of its contents. The original `project' directory remains unchanged.  Use the `−z' option to compress the archive as it is being written. This yields the same output as creating an uncompressed archive and then using gzip to compress it, but it eliminates the extra step.    To create a compressed archive called `project.tar.gz' from the contents of the `project' directory, type:  $ tar −zcvf project.tar.gz project RET  This command creates a compressed archive file, `project.tar.gz', containing the `project' directory and all of its contents. The original `project' directory remains unchanged.  NOTE: When you use the `−z' option, you should specify the archive name with a `.tar.gz' extension and not a `.tar' extension, so the file name shows that the archive is compressed. This is not a requirement, but it serves as a reminder and is the standard practice.        [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.6.2 Listing the Contents of an Archive  To list the contents of a tar archive without extracting them, use tar with the `−t' option.   9. Managing Files   131               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list the contents of an archive called `project.tar', type:  $ tar −tvf project.tar RET  This command lists the contents of the `project.tar' archive. Using the `−v' option along with the `−t' option causes tar to output the permissions and modification time of each file, along with its file name−−the same format used by the ls command with the `−l' option  see section Listing File Attributes .  Include the `−z' option to list the contents of a compressed archive.    To list the contents of a compressed archive called `project.tar.gz', type:  $ tar −ztvf project.tar RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.6.3 Extracting Files from an Archive  To extract  or unpack  the contents of a tar archive, use tar with the `−x'  "extract"  option.    To extract the contents of an archive called `project.tar', type:  $ tar −xvf project.tar RET  This command extracts the contents of the `project.tar' archive into the current directory.  If an archive is compressed, which usually means it will have a `.tar.gz' or `.tgz' extension, include the `−z' option.    To extract the contents of a compressed archive called `project.tar.gz', type:  $ tar −zxvf project.tar.gz RET  NOTE: If there are files or subdirectories in the current directory with the same name as any of those in the archive, those files will be overwritten when the archive is extracted. If you don't know what files are included in an archive, consider listing the contents of the archive first  see section Listing the Contents of an Archive .  Another reason to list the contents of an archive before extracting them is to determine whether the files in the archive are contained in a directory. If not, and the current directory contains many unrelated files, you might confuse them with the files extracted from the archive.   9. Managing Files   132   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   To extract the files into a directory of their own, make a new directory, move the archive to that directory, and change to that directory, where you can then extract the files from the archive.

To store a revision of a file so that RCS can keep track of it, you check in the file with RCS. This deposits the revision of the file in an RCS repository−−−a file that RCS uses to store all changes to that file. RCS makes a repository file with the same file name as the file you are checking in, but with a `,v' extension appended to the name. For example, checking in the file `foo.text' with RCS creates a repository file called `foo.text,v'.  Each time you want RCS to remember a revision of a file, you check in the file, and RCS writes to that file's RCS repository the differences between the file and the last revision on record in the repository.  To access a revision of a file, you check out the revision from RCS. The revision is obtained from the file's repository and is written to the current directory.  Although RCS is most often used with text files, you can also use it to keep track of revisions made to other kinds of files, such as image files and sound files.  Another revision control system, Concurrent Versions System  CVS , is used for tracking collections of multiple files whose revisions are made concurrently by multiple authors. While much less simple than RCS, it is very popular for managing free software projects on the Internet. See Info file `cvs.info', node `Top', for information on using CVS.  9.7.1 Checking In a File Revision 9.7.2 Checking Out a File Revision 9.7.3 Viewing a File's Revision Log    Viewing the revision log.

Type ci followed by the name of a file to deposit that file into the RCS repository. If the file has never before been checked in, ci prompts for a description to use for that file; each subsequent time the file is   9. Managing Files   133               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   checked in, ci prompts for text to include in the file's revision log  see section Viewing a File's Revision Log . Log messages may contain more than one line of text; type a period  `.'  on a line by itself to end the entry.  For example, suppose the file `novel' contains this text:  This is a tale about many things, including a long voyage across America.    To check in the file `novel' with RCS, type:  $ ci novel RET novel,v  60;−−  novel enter description, terminated with single '.' or end of file: NOTE: This is NOT the log message! 62;62; The Great American Novel. RET 62;62; . RET $  This command deposits the file in an RCS repository file called `novel,v', and the original file, `novel', is removed. To edit or access the file again, you must check out a revision of the file from RCS with which to work  see section Checking Out a File Revision .  Whenever you have a new revision that you want to save, use ci as before to check in the file. This begins the process all over again.  For example, suppose you have checked out the first revision of `novel' and changed the file so that it now looks like this:  This is a very long tale about a great many things, including my long voyage across America, and back home again.     To deposit this revision in RCS, type:  $ ci novel RET novel,v  60;−−  novel new revision: 1.2; previous revision: 1.1 enter log message, terminated with single '.' or end of file: 62;62; Second draft. RET 62;62; . RET $  If you create a subdirectory called `RCS'  in all uppercase letters  in the current directory, RCS recognizes this specially named directory instead of the current directory as the place to store the `,v' revision files. This helps reduce clutter in the directory you are working in.  If the file you are depositing is a text file, you can have RCS insert a line of text, every time the file is   9. Managing Files   134   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   checked out, containing the name of the file, the revision number, the date and time in the UTC  Coordinated Universal Time  time zone, and the user ID of the author. To do this, put the text `$'Id$ at a place in the file where you want this text to be written. You only need to do this once; each time you check the file out, RCS replaces this string in the file with the header text.  For example, this chapter was written to a file, `managing−files.texinfo', whose revisions were tracked with RCS; the `$'Id$ string in this file currently reads:     $Id: managing−files.texinfo,v 1.32 2001 05 16 16:57:58 m Exp m $  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   9.7.2 Checking Out a File Revision  Use co to check out a revision of a file from an RCS repository.  To check out the latest revision of a file that you intend to edit  and to check in later as a new revision , use the −l  for "lock"  option. Locking a revision in this fashion prevents overlapping changes being made to the file should another revision be accidentally checked out before this revision is checked in.          To check out the latest revision of the file `novel' for editing, type:  $ co −l novel RET  This command checks out the latest revision of file `novel' from the `novel,v' repository, writing it to a file called `novel' in the current directory.  If a file with that name already exists in the current directory, co asks whether or not to overwrite the file.  You can make changes to this file and then check it in as a new revision  see section Checking In a File Revision .  You can also check out a version of a file as read only, where changes cannot be written to it. Do this to check out a version to view only and not to edit.  To check out the current version of a file for examination, type co followed by the name of the file.    To check out the current revision of file `novel', but not permit changes to it, type:  $ co novel RET  This command checks out the latest revision of the file `novel' from the RCS repository `novel,v'  either from the current directory or in a subdirectory named `RCS' .  To check out a version other than the most recent version, specify the version number to check out with the `−r' option. Again, use the `−l' option to allow the revision to be edited.   9. Managing Files   135   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To check out revision 1.14 of file `novel', type:     $ co −l −r1.14 novel RET  NOTE: Before checking out an old revision of a file, remember to check in the latest changes first, or they may be lost.

To view the revision log for file `novel', type:     $ rlog novel RET  RCS file: novel,v Working file: novel head: 1.2 branch: locks: strict access list: symbolic names: keyword substitution: kv total revisions: 2;     selected revisions: 2 description: The Great American Novel. −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−− revision 1.2 date: 1991 06 20 15:31:44;  author: leo;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 −2 Second draft. −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−− revision 1.1 date: 1991 06 21 19:03:58;  author: leo;  state: Exp; Initial revision ==================================================================== $  This command outputs the revision log for the file `novel'; it lists information about the RCS repository, including its name  `novel,v'  and the name of the actual file  `novel' . It also shows that there are two revisions−−the first, which was checked in to RCS on 20 June 1991, and the second, which was checked in to RCS the next day, on 21 June 1991.

Viewing Text  Dealing with textual matter is the meat of Linux  and of most computing , so there are going to be many chapters about the various aspects of text. This first chapter in this part of the book shows how to view text on your display screen.  There are many ways to view or otherwise output text. When your intention is to edit the text of a file, open it in a text editor, as described in Text Editing.  Some kinds of files−−such as PostScript, DVI, and PDF files−−often contain text in them, but they are technically not text files. These are image format files, and I describe methods for viewing them in Previewing Print Files.  NOTE: To learn how to browse files and their contents in a Web browser, see Browsing Files.  10.1 Perusing Text 10.2 Outputting Text 10.3 Streaming Text 10.4 Viewing a Character Chart     Perusing text on the display.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   10.1 Perusing Text  Use less to peruse text, viewing it one screen  or "page"  at a time. The less tool works on either files or standard output−−it is popularly used as the last command on a pipeline so that you can page through the text output of some commands. For an example, see Redirecting Output to Another Command's Input.  zless is identical to less, but you use it to view compressed text files; it allows you to read a compressed text file's contents without having to uncompress it first  see section Compressed Files . Most of the system documentation in the ` usr doc' and ` usr share doc' directories, for example, consists of compressed text files.  You may, on occasion, be confronted with a reference to a command for paging text called more. It was the standard tool for paging text until it gave way to less in the early to mid−1990s; less comes with many more options−−its most notable advantage being the ability to scroll backward through a file−−but at the expense of being almost exactly three times the size of more. Hence there are two meanings to the saying, "less is more."  10.1.1 Perusing a Text File      Perusing a file.   10.

To page through the text file `README', type:  $ less README RET        This command starts less and displays the file `README' on the screen.  You can more forward through the document a line at a time by typing @downarrow, and you can move forward through the document a screenful at a time by typing PgDn. To move backward by a line, type @uparrow, and type PgUp to move backward by a screenful.

To page through all of the Unix FAQ files in ` usr doc FAQ', type:  $ less  usr doc FAQ unix−faq−part* RET  This command starts less, opens in it all of the files that match the given pattern ` usr doc FAQ unix−faq−part*', and begins displaying the first one:   10. Viewing Text   139   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: When you specify more than one file to page, less displays each file in turn, beginning with the first file you specify or the first file that matches the given pattern.

This is useful for quickly looking at part of a text, or for passing part of a text to other tools in a command line.  Many people still use cat to view a text file, especially if it is a very small file. To output all of a file's contents on the screen, use cat and give the file name as an argument.  This isn't always the best way to peruse or read text−−a very large text will scroll off the top of the screen, for example−−but sometimes the simple outputting of text is quite appropriate, such as when you just want to output one line of a file, or when you want to output several files into one new file.  This section describes the tools used for such purposes. These tools are best used as filters, often at the end of a pipeline, outputting the standard input from other commands.  NOTE: Tools and methods for outputting text for printing, such as outputting text in a font, are described in Converting Plain Text for Output.  10.2.1 Showing Non−printing Characters 10.2.2 Outputting a Beginning Part of a Text 10.2.3 Outputting an Ending Part of a Text 10.2.4 Outputting a Middle Part of a Text 10.2.5 Outputting the Text between Strings 10.2.6 Outputting Text in a Dialect     Showing non−printing characters.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   10.2.1 Showing Non−printing Characters  Use cat with the `−v' option to output non−printing characters, such as control characters, in such a way so that you can see them. With this option, cat outputs those characters in hat notation, where they are represented by a `^' and the character corresponding to the actual control character  for example, a bell character would be output as `^G' .   10. Viewing Text   141   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To peruse the file `translation' with non−printing characters displayed in hat notation, type:  $ cat −v translation  less RET  In this example, the output of cat is piped to less for viewing on the screen; you could have piped it to another command, or redirected it to a file instead.  To visually display the end of each line, use the `−E' option; it specifies that a `$' should be output after the end of each line. This is useful for determining whether lines contain trailing space characters.  Also useful is the `−T' option, which outputs tab characters as `^I'.  The `−A' option combines all three of these options−−it is the same as specifying `−vET'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   10.2.2 Outputting a Beginning Part of a Text  Use head to output the beginning of a text. By default, it outputs the first ten lines of its input.    To output the first ten lines of file `placement−list', type:  $ head placement−list RET  You can specify as a numeric option the number of lines to output. If you specify more lines than a file contains, head just outputs the entire text.    To output the first line of file `placement−list', type:  $ head −1 placement−list RET    To output the first sixty−six lines of file `placement−list', type:  $ head −66 placement−list RET              To output a given number of characters instead of lines, give the number of characters to output as an argument to the `−c' option.    To output the first character in the file `placement−list', type:   10. Viewing Text   142            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ head −c1 placement−list RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   10.2.3 Outputting an Ending Part of a Text  The tail tool works like head, but outputs the last part of its input. Like head, it outputs ten lines by default.    To output the last ten lines of file `placement−list', type:  $ tail placement−list RET    To output the last fourteen lines of file `placement−list', type:  $ tail −14 placement−list RET  It is sometimes useful to view the end of a file on a continuing basis; this can be useful for a "growing" file, a file that is being written to by another process. To keep viewing the end of such a file, use tail with the `−f'  "follow"  option. Type C−c to stop viewing the file.    To follow the end of the file `access_log', type:  $ tail −f access_log RET  NOTE: You can achieve the same result with less; to do this, type F while perusing the text  see section Perusing Text .  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   10.2.4 Outputting a Middle Part of a Text  There are a few ways to output only a middle portion of a text.  To output a particular line of a file, use the sed tool  see section Editing Streams of Text . Give as a quoted argument the line number to output followed by `!d'. Give the file name as the second argument.    To output line 47 of file `placement−list', type:   10. Viewing Text   143   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ sed '47!d' placement−list RET  To output a region of more than one line, give the starting and ending line numbers, separated by a comma.    To output lines 47 to 108 of file `placement−list', type:  $ sed '47,108!d' placement−list RET  You can also combine multiple head or tail commands on a pipeline to get the desired result  see section Redirecting Output to Another Command's Input .    To output the tenth line in the file `placement−list', type:  $ head placement−list  tail −1 RET    To output the fifth and fourth lines from the bottom of file `placement−list', type:  $ tail −5 placement−list  head −2 RET    To output the 500th character in `placement−list', type:  $ head −c500 placement−list  tail −c1 RET    To output the first character on the fifth line of the file `placement−list', type:                 $ head −5 placement−list  tail −1  head −c1 RET  In the preceding example, three commands were used: the first five lines of the file `placement−list' are passed to tail, which outputs the last line in the output  the fifth line in the file ; then, the last head command outputs the first character in that last line, which achieves the desired result.

The strings can be words or even regular expressions  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns .   10. Viewing Text   144   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Use the `−n' option followed by `' first , last p'' to output just the text between the strings first and last, inclusive. This is useful for outputting, say, just one chapter or section of a text file when you know the text used to begin the sections with.    To output all the text from file `book−draft' between `Chapter 3' and `Chapter 4', type:  $ sed −n ' Chapter 3 , Chapter 4 p' book−draft RET  To output all of the lines of text except those between two patterns, omit the `−n' option.    To output all the text from file `book−draft', except that which lies between the text `Chapter 3' and `Chapter 4', type:  $ sed ' Chapter 3 , Chapter 4 p' book−draft RET  NOTE: For a more thorough introduction to sed, see Editing Streams of Text.

Generally speaking, a filter is a tool that works on standard input, changing it in some way, and then passing it to standard output.    To apply the kraut filter to the text in the file ` etc motd', type:  $ cat  etc motd  kraut RET  These commands pass the contents of the file ` etc motd' to the kraut filter, whose output is then sent to standard output. The contents of ` etc motd' are not changed.  Some of the dialect filters available include nyc, which gives a "New Yawker" dialect to text, and newspeak, which translates text into the approved language of the thought police, as described in George Orwell's novel, 1984.

Rapid serial visual presentation, or RSVP, is a technique that aims to increase reading speed and comprehension with the use of computer display screens. With this technique, text is displayed streamed on the screen, one word at a time, with pauses between words and punctuation. The average reading time is lowered and comprehension is increased significantly with this technique.  GNOME sview is a "streaming viewer" for X; it streams text a word at a time on the screen, at a default rate of 450 words per minute. Use it to read text files and the X selection, which is text you have selected with the mouse  see section Selecting Text .  To open a file in sview, either specify it as an argument to the command, or choose Open from the File menu in sview, and select the file from there.    To view the contents of the text file `alice−in−wonderland' in sview, type:     $ sview alice−in−wonderland RET  To start streaming the text, either press S once, or left−click on the button marked RSVP. Both S and the RSVP button toggle the streaming; the left and right arrow keys control the speed.  Text being streamed with sview looks like this:   10. Viewing Text   146   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   The large area with the word `beginning' in it is where the text is being streamed. The text in the lower−left window is a shrunken view of the entire file, the text in the lower−right window is the paragraph from which the current word comes from.  To open another file, choose it from the menu; you can have many files open in sview at once. sview places each file in its own buffer. You can also paste the X selection into a buffer of its own−−to switch to a different buffer, choose its name from the Buffer menu.  Type Q to quit reading and exit sview.  The following table lists the keyboard commands used in sview and describes their meaning.  KEYSTROKE DESCRIPTION @leftarrow Decrease the stream speed.

To view an ASCII character set, type:  $ man ascii RET        You can use the octal codes listed for each character to type them in Emacs−−see Inserting Special Characters in Emacs.  The default Linux character set, the ISO 8859−1  "Latin 1"  character set, contains all of the standard ASCII character set plus an additional 128 characters.  To view the ISO 8859−1 character set, which contains an extended set of characters above the standard 127 ASCII characters, view the iso_8859_1man page.    To view the ISO 8859−1 character set, type:  $ man iso_8859_1 RET  You can use this page to see all of the characters in this character set and how to input them.  NOTE: There's a special way to "quote" these characters in Emacs; this technique is described in Inserting Special Characters in Emacs.  The `miscfiles' package also contains charts for these character sets, as explained in Word Lists and Reference Files.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   10. Viewing Text   148    11. Text Editing  Text editing is one of the most fundamental activities of computing on Linux−based systems, or most any computer for that matter. We edit text when writing a document, sending email, making a Web page, posting an article for Usenet, programming−−and the list goes on. Most people spend a good deal of their computing time editing text with a text editor application.  There are a lot of text editors to choose from on Linux systems, as the first recipe in this chapter shows, but the majority of editors fit in one of two families of editor: Emacs and Vi. Most users prefer one or the other; rarely is one adept at both. I give more coverage to Emacs, and not only because it's my preferred editor−−its keystroke commands are used by default in many other tools and applications, including the bash shell  see section The Shell .  11.1 Choosing the Perfect Text Editor 11.2 Emacs 11.3 Running a Vi Tutorial 11.4 Selecting Text 11.5 Editing Streams of Text 11.6 Concatenating Text 11.7 Including Text Files     Overview of text editors.

There is more than one version of Emacs. GNU Emacs is the Emacs released under the auspices of Richard Stallman, who wrote the original Emacs predecessor in the 1970s. XEmacs  formerly Lucid Emacs  offers essentially the same features GNU Emacs does, but also contains its own features for use with the X Window System  it also behaves differently from GNU Emacs in some minor ways .  GNU Emacs and XEmacs are by far the most popular emacsen  as they are referred to in number ; other flavors include jed  described in the previous section  and Chet's Emacs, ce, developed by a programmer at Case Western Reserve University.  Following is a brief introduction to using Emacs, interspersed with the necessary Emacs jargon; following that are recipes that describe how to use some of Emacs's advanced editing features.  11.2.1 Getting Acquainted with Emacs 11.2.2 Basic Emacs Editing Keys 11.2.3 Making Abbreviations in Emacs 11.2.4 Recording and Running Macros in Emacs 11.2.5 Inserting Special Characters in Emacs     How to learn Emacs.

To start GNU Emacs at a shell prompt, type:  $ emacs RET    To start XEmacs at a shell prompt, type:         11. Text Editing   151   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   $ xemacs RET  Upon startup in X, a typical GNU Emacs window looks like this  the window frame will differ depending on your window manager :  The welcome message appears when Emacs first starts, and it tells you, among other things, how to run a tutorial  which we'll look at in just a minute .  The top bar is called the menu bar, and you can pull down its menus with the mouse by left−clicking a menu and then dragging it down. When you run Emacs in a console, you can't use the mouse to pull down the menus, but you can access and choose the same menu items in a text menu by typing F10. 17    11. Text Editing   152   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   A file or other text open in Emacs is held in its own area called a buffer. By default, the current buffer appears in the large area underneath the menu bar. To write text in the buffer, just type it. The place in the buffer where the cursor is at is called point, and is referenced by many Emacs commands.  The horizontal bar near the bottom of the Emacs window and directly underneath the current buffer is called the mode line; it gives information about the current buffer, including its name, what percentage of the buffer fits on the screen, what line point is on, and whether or not the buffer is saved to a file.  The mode line also lists the modes active in the buffer. Emacs modes are general states that control the way Emacs behaves−−for example, when Overwrite mode is set, text you type overwrites the text at point; in Insert mode  the default , text you type is inserted at point. Usually, either Fundamental mode  the default  or Text mode will be listed.  You can make the menu bar appear or disappear by toggling Menu bar mode. Typing F10 to activate the menu pull−downs works whether Menu bar mode is on or off; if it's off, the menu choices will appear in a new buffer window.    To turn off the top menu bar, type:  M−x menu−bar−mode RET         If the menu bar is already turned off, this command will turn it on.   The echo area is where Emacs writes brief status messages, such as error messages; it is the last line in the Emacs window. When you type a command that requires input, that input is requested in this area  and when that happens, the place you type your input, in the echo area, is then called the minibuffer .  Emacs commands usually begin with a Control or Meta  Escape  key sequence; many commands begin with the C−x sequence, which you type by pressing and holding the CTRL key and then pressing the X key  see section Typographical Conventions .  Because Emacs is different in culture from the editors and approach of the Microsoft Windows and Apple MacOS world, it has gotten a rather unfounded reputation in those corners that it is odd and difficult to use. This is not so. The keyboard commands to run its various functions are designed for ease of use and easy recall.  For example, the find−file function prompts for the name of a file and opens a copy of the file in a new buffer; its keyboard accelerator is C−x C−f  you can keep CTRL depressed while you press and release the X and F keys .  You can run any Emacs function by typing M−x followed by the function name and pressing RET.    To run the find−file function, type:  M−x find−file RET  This command runs the find−file function, which prompts for the name of a file and opens a copy of the   11. Text Editing   153   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   file in a new buffer.  Type C−g in Emacs to quit a function or command; if you make a mistake when typing a command, this is useful to cancel and abort the keyboard input.  Now that we have run through the essential Emacs terminology, I'll show you how to exit the program−−just type C−x C−c.  Emacs can have more than one buffer open at once. To switch between buffers, type C−x C−b. Then, give the name of the buffer to switch to, followed by RET; alternatively, type RET without a buffer name to switch to the last buffer you had visited.  Viewing a buffer in Emacs is called visiting the buffer.   A special buffer called `*scratch*' is for notes and things you don't want to save; it always exists in Emacs.    To switch to a buffer called `rolo', type:  C−x C−b rolo RET          To switch to the `*scratch*' buffer, type:  C−x C−b *scratch* RET  Any file names you give as an argument to emacs will open in separate buffers:     $ emacs todo rolo  usr local src nirvarna README RET   You can also make new buffers and open files in buffers later, of course.   Emacs comes with an interactive, self−paced tutorial that teaches you how to use the basics. In my experience, setting aside 25 minutes to go through the tutorial is one of the best things you can do in your computing career−−even if you decide that you don't like Emacs very much, a great many other applications use Emacs−like keyboard commands and heuristics, so familiarizing yourself with them will always pay off.  To start the tutorial at any time when you are in Emacs, type C−h t.  Incidentally, C−h is the Emacs help key; all help−related commands begin with this key. For example, to read the Emacs FAQ, type C−h F, and to run the Info documentation browser  which contains The GNU Emacs Manual , type C−h i.

Abbrevs exist as a convenience to you−−you can define abbrevs to expand to a long phrase that is inconvenient to type, or you can define a misspelling that you tend to make to expand to its correct spelling. Abbrevs only expand when you have Abbrev mode enabled.    To turn on Abbrev mode, type:     M−x abbrev−mode RET  To define an abbrev, type the abbrev you want to use and then type C−x aig. Emacs will prompt in the minibuffer for the text you want the abbrev to expand to; type that text and then type RET.    To define `rbf' as an abbrev for `R. Buckminster Fuller', do the following:  ¤ First, type the abbrev itself:  ¤ Next, specify that this text is to be an abbrev; type:  rbf  C−x aig           ¤ Now type the text to expand it to:  Global expansion for "rbf": R. Buckminster Fuller RET  Now, whenever you type `rbf' followed by a whitespace or punctuation character in the current buffer, that text will expand to the text `R. Buckminster Fuller'.  To save the abbrevs you have defined so that you can use them later, use the write−abbrev−file function. This saves all of the abbrevs currently defined to a file that you can read in a future Emacs session.  You can also open the file in a buffer and edit the abbrevs if you like.    11. Text Editing   156               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To save the abbrevs you have currently defined to a file `~ .misspelling−abbrevs', type:  M−x write−abbrev−file RET ~ .misspelling−abbrevs RET  Then, in a future Emacs session, you can use the read−abbrev−file function to define those abbrevs for that session.    To read the abbrevs from the file `~ .misspelling−abbrevs', and define them for the current session, type:  M−x read−abbrev−file RET ~ .misspelling−abbrevs RET  NOTE: Emacs mode commands are toggles. So to turn off Abbrev mode in a buffer, just type M−x abbrev−mode RET again. If you turn Abbrev mode on in that buffer later on during the Emacs session, the abbrevs will be remembered and will expand again.

To begin recording a macro, type C−x  . Then, everything you type is recorded as the macro until you stop recording by typing C−x  . After you have recorded a macro, you can play it back at any time during the Emacs session by typing C−x e. You can precede it with the universal−argument command, C−u, to specify a number of times to play it back.    To record a macro that capitalizes the first word of the current line  M−c capitalizes the word to the right of point  and then advances to the next line, type:  C−x   C−a M−c C−n C−x      To play the macro back 20 times, type:  C−u 20 C−x e  Macros are primary to how Emacs works−−in fact, the name Emacs is derived from `Editing MACroS', because the first version of Emacs in 1976 was actually a collection of such macros written for another text editor.   11.

For example, in a text file, you can specify a page break by inserting the formfeed character, ASCII C−l or octal code 014; when you print a file with formfeeds, the current page is ejected at this character and printing is resumed on a new page.  However, C−l has meaning as an Emacs command. To insert a character like this, use the quoted−insert function, C−q. It takes either a literal keystroke to insert, or the octal code of the character to insert. It inserts that character at point.    To insert a formfeed character at point by specifying its actual keystroke  C−l , type:    To insert a formfeed character at point by specifying its octal character code, type:  The preceding examples both do the same thing: they insert a formfeed character at point.  An interesting use of C−q is to underline text. To do this, insert a literal C−h character followed by an underscore  `_'  after each character you want to underline.  C−q C−l  C−q 014 RET             To underline the character before point, type:  C−q C−h _  You can then use ul to output the text to the screen  see section Underlining Text .  Another kind of special character insert you might want to make is for accented characters and other characters used in various languages.  To insert an accented character, use ISO Accents mode. When this mode is active, you can type a special accent character followed by the character to be accented, and the proper accented character will be inserted at point.  The following table shows the special accent characters and the key combinations to use.  [GNU INFO BUG: Info does not currently display accent characters correctly.]   11.

The most recently selected text is called the X selection.  In the console, you can cut and paste text in the same virtual console or into a different virtual console. To do this, you need the gpm package installed and set up for your mouse  it's a default, recommended package .  The operations described in this section work the same both in X and in virtual consoles. You cannot presently cut and paste text between X and a virtual console.  Three buttons on the mouse are used for cutting and pasting. If you have a two−button mouse, your administrator can set it to emulate three buttons−−to specify the middle button, press the left and right buttons simultaneously.  Click the left mouse button and drag the mouse over text to select it. You can also double−click the left mouse button on a word to select that word, and triple−click the left mouse button on a line to select that line. Furthermore, you can click the left mouse button at one end of a portion of text you want to select, and then click the right mouse button at the other end to select all of the text between the points.  NOTE: In an xterm window, when you're running a tool or application locally in a shell  such as the lynx Web browser , the left mouse button alone won't work. When this happens, press and hold the SHIFT key while using the mouse to select text.  11.4.1 Cutting Text 11.4.2 Pasting Text     Cutting out a selection of text.    Pasting in a selection of text.

At a shell prompt or in Emacs, type C−k to cut the text from the cursor to the end of the line.  In Emacs parlance, cutting text is known as killing text. Emacs has additional commands for killing text:    When you have selected an area of text with the mouse as described previously, you can type Shift−DEL to delete it.    You can also click the left mouse button at one end of an area of text and then double−click the right mouse button at the other end of the area to kill the area of text.   11. Text Editing   161   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     Finally, to kill a large portion of text in an Emacs buffer, set the mark at one end of the text by moving point to that end and typing C−SPC. Then, move point to the other end of the text, and type C−w to kill it.

You can also use the keyboard by moving the cursor to where you want to paste and then typing Shift−INS. These commands work both in X and in the console.  In X, to display the contents of the X selection in its own window, run the xpaste X client; its only purpose in life is to display this text in its window.  In Emacs, pasting text is called yanking the text. Emacs offers the additional key, C−y  "yank" , to yank the text that was last selected or killed. This key also works in the bash shell, where it pastes the last text that was killed with C−k in that shell session, if any.

It is not a text editor in the usual sense−−you don't open a file in sed and interactively edit it; instead, it performs editing operations on a stream of text sent to its standard input, and it writes the results to the standard output. This is more like a filter than an editor, and sed is a useful tool for formatting and searching through text.  "The seder's grab−bag" is a useful collection of sed information including a FAQ and many example scripts.  The sed"one−liners" are useful commands for editing and processing text.  See Info file `sed.info', node `Top', for more information on sed usage.  Other tools that are good for stream editing include the AWK and Perl programming languages; to learn more about using these powerful languages, I recommend the following books:    The GNU Awk User's Guide    Picking Up Perl   11.

It is useful for concatenating files of text together.  For example, suppose you have two files, `early' and `later'. The file `early' contains this text:    To concatenate these files into a new file, `novels', type:     $ cat early later 62; novels RET  This command redirects the standard output to a new file, `novels', which would then contain the following text:              This Side of Paradise The Beautiful and Damned  And the file `later' contains this text:  The Great Gatsby Tender Is the Night The Last Tycoon  This Side of Paradise The Beautiful and Damned The Great Gatsby Tender Is the Night The Last Tycoon  The files `early' and `later' are not altered.  The Great Gatsby Tender Is the Night The Last Tycoon This Side of Paradise The Beautiful and Damned  Had you typed cat later early > novels instead, the files would be concatenated in that reversed order instead, beginning with `later'; so the file `novels' would contain the following:  The following sections give other recipes for concatenating text.   11. Text Editing   163   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: You can also use cat to concatenate files that are not text, but its most popular usage is with text files. Another way to concatenate files of text in an automated way is to use file inclusion−−−see Including Text Files.  A similar tool, zcat, reads the contents of compressed files.  11.6.1 Writing Text to Files 11.6.2 Appending Text to a File 11.6.3 Inserting Text at the Beginning of a File        Writing text to a file.

There are ways of doing these kind of micro−editing jobs without a text editor.  To write a text file without using a text editor, redirect the standard output of cat to the file to write. You can then type your text, typing C−d on a line of its own to end the file. This is useful when you want to quickly create a small text file, but that is about it; usually, you open or create a text file in a text editor, as described in the previous sections in this chapter.    To make a file, `novels', with some text in it, type:     $ cat 62; novels RET This Side of Paradise RET The Beautiful and Damned RET The Great Gatsby RET Tender Is the Night RET C−d $  In this example, the text file `novels' was created and contains four lines of text  the last line with the C−d is never part of the file .  Typing text like this without an editor will sometimes do in a pinch but, if you make a mistake, there is not much recourse besides starting over−−you can type C−u to erase the current line, and C−c to abort the whole thing and not write the text to a file at all, but that's about it.

Using `>' instead would overwrite the file.     To add a line of text to the bottom of file `novels', type:  $ cat 62;62; novels RET The Last Tycoon RET C−d  In this example, no files were specified to cat for input, so cat used the standard input; then, one line of text was typed, and this text was appended to file `novels', the file used in the example of the previous recipe. So now this file would contain the following:     This Side of Paradise The Beautiful and Damned The Great Gatsby Tender Is the Night The Last Tycoon  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   11.6.3 Inserting Text at the Beginning of a File  @sf{WWW}: http:  dsl.org comp tinyutils   Inserting text at the beginning of a text file without calling up a text editor is a bit trickier than appending text to a file's end−−but it is possible.  To insert one or more lines of text at the beginning of a file, use ins. Give the name of the file in which to insert text as an argument; ins will read lines of text from the standard input and insert them at the beginning of the file.  It works by opening the file in ed, a simple line editor.   Give the EOF−−that is, type C−d on a line by itself−−to signify the end of the lines of text to insert.    To insert several lines of text at the beginning of the file `novels', type:  $ ins novels RET The Novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald RET −−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−− RET C−d $   11. Text Editing   165         The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   This command inserts two lines of text at the beginning of novels, the file used in the previous examples in this section.

This is useful if you want or need to frequently rearrange divisions or sections of a document, if you need to keep a document in more than one arrangement, or if you have some sections of text that you frequently insert in more than one document. For these situations, you can keep each section in a separate file and build an include file that contains the file names for the various sections in the order you want to generate that file.  To include a file in a text file, specify the file to be included on a line of its own, like this:  include file   When you process this file for inclusion, the line with the `include' statement is replaced with the contents of the file file  whose path is relative to the current directory of the include file .  Use the m4 tool, the GNU macro processor, to process an include file. It takes as an argument the name of the include file, and it outputs the inclusion to the standard output. You can use redirection to redirect the output to a file.  For example, suppose the file `soups' contains this text:  And suppose the file `sandwiches' contains this text:  Clam Chowder Lobster Bisque Vegetable  BLT   11. Text Editing   166               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   And finally, suppose the file `menu' contains this text:    To process the file and write to the file `monday.txt', type:     $ m4 menu 62; monday.txt RET  This command writes a new file, `monday.txt', which looks like this:        Ham on Rye Roast Beef  Diner Menu For Today  Soups −−−−−  include soups   Sandwiches −−−−−−−−−−  include sandwiches   Diner Menu For Today  Soups −−−−−  Clam Chowder Lobster Bisque Vegetable  Sandwiches −−−−−−−−−−  BLT Ham on Rye Roast Beef  NOTE: You can write more than one include file that will use your files−−and the files themselves can have include files of their own.  This is a fairly simple use of m4; it can do much more, including run commands, manipulate text, and run custom macros. See Info file `m4.info', node `Top' for more information on this tool.   11.

Grammar and Reference  The tools and resources for writing and editing on Linux−based systems include spell checkers, dictionaries, and reference files.

Word lists and reference files.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.1 Spelling  There are several ways to spell check text and files on Linux; the following recipes show how to find the correct spellings of particular words and how to perform batch, interactive, and Emacs−based spell checks.  The system dictionary file, ` usr dict words', 18  is nothing more than a word list  albeit a very large one , sorted in alphabetical order and containing one word per line. Words that are correct regardless of case are listed in lowercase letters, and words that rely on some form of capitalization in order to be correct  such as proper nouns  appear in that form. All of the Linux spelling tools use this text file to check spelling; if a word does not appear in the dictionary file, it is considered to be misspelled.  NOTE: None of the computerized spell−check tools will correct your writing if you are using the wrong word to begin with−−for example, if you have `there' when you mean `their', the computer will not catch it  yet! .  12.1.1 Finding the Correct Spelling of a Word 12.1.2 Listing the Misspellings in a Text 12.1.3 Keeping a Spelling Word List 12.1.4 Interactive Spell Checking 12.1.5 Spell Checking in Emacs  Spell checking a word.

Grammar and Reference   169   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    12.1.1 Finding the Correct Spelling of a Word  If you're unsure whether or not you're using the correct spelling of a word, use spell to find out. spell reads from the standard input and outputs any words not found in the system dictionary−−so if a word is misspelled, it will be echoed back on the screen after you type it.    For example, to check whether the word `occurance' is misspelled, type:  $ spell RET occurance RET occurance C−d $        In the example, spell echoed the word `occurance', meaning that this word was not in the system dictionary and therefore was quite likely a misspelling. Then, C−d was typed to exit spell.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.1.2 Listing the Misspellings in a Text  To output a list of misspelled words in a file, give the name of the file to check as an argument to spell. Any misspelled words in the file are output, each on a line of its own and in the order that they appear in the file.    To spell check the file `fall−lecture.draft', type:  $ spell fall−lecture.draft RET occurance willl occurance $  In this example, three words are output: `occurance', `willl' and `occurance' again, meaning that these three words were found in `fall−lecture.draft', in that order, and were not in the system dictionary  and so were probably misspelled . Note that the misspelling `occurance' appears twice in the file.  To correct the misspellings, you could then open the file in your preferred text editor and edit it. Later in this section I'll describe an interactive spell checker that allows you to correct misspellings as they are found. Still another option is to use a text editor with spell−checking facilities built in, such as Emacs.    To spell check the file `fall−lecture.draft', and output any possibly misspelled words to a   12. Grammar and Reference   170   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   file `fall−lecture.spelling', type:  $ spell fall−lecture.draft 62; fall−lecture.spelling RET        In this example, the standard output redirection character, `>', is used to redirect the output to a file  see section Redirecting Output to a File .  To output an alphabetical list of the misspelled words, pipe the output to sort; then pipe the sorted output to the uniq filter to remove duplicates from the list  uniq removes duplicate adjacent lines from its input, outputting the "unique" lines .    To output a sorted list of the misspelled words that are in the file `fall−lecture.draft', type:  $ spell fall−lecture.draft  sort  uniq RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.1.3 Keeping a Spelling Word List  The stock American English dictionary installed with Linux−based systems includes over 45,000 words. However large that number may seem, a lot of words are invariably left out−−including slang, jargon, and some proper names.  You can view the system dictionary as you would any other text file, but users never edit this file to add words to it. 19  Instead, you add new words to your own personal dictionary, a file in the same format as the system dictionary, but kept in your home directory as the file `~ .ispell_default'.  Users can have their own personal dictionary; the spelling commands discussed in this chapter automatically use your personal dictionary, if you have one, in addition to the system dictionary.  You build your personal dictionary using the i and u options of ispell, which insert words into your personal dictionary. Use these options either with the stand−alone tool or with the various ispell Emacs functions  see Interactive Spell Checking and Spell Checking in Emacs .  NOTE: You can also add  or remove  words by manually editing the file with a text editor, but take care so that the list is kept in alphabetical order!  Over time, personal dictionaries begin to look very personal, as a reflection of their owners; Gregory Cosmo Haun made a work of art by photographing the portraits of a dozen users superimposed with listings of their personal dictionaries  accessible online at http:  www.reed.edu ~cosmo art DictPort.html .

Grammar and Reference   171   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    12.1.4 Interactive Spell Checking  Use ispell to spell check a file interactively, so that every time a misspelling is found, you're given a chance to replace it then and there.    To interactively spell check `fall−lecture.notes', type:     $ ispell fall−lecture.notes RET  When you type this, ispell begins checking the file. It stops at the first misspelling it finds:  On the top line of the screen, ispell displays the misspelled word, followed by the name of the file. Underneath this is the sentence in which the misspelling appears, with the word in question highlighted. Following this is a list of suggested words, each offset by a number−−in this example, ispell has only one suggestion: `lectures'.  To replace a misspelling with a suggested word, type the number that corresponds to the suggested word  in this example, you would type 0 to replace the misspelling with `lectures' . You only need to type the number of your selection−−a RET is not required.  You can also type a correction yourself; this is useful when ispell either offers no suggestions, or when it does and the word you want is not one of them. To do this, type r  for "replace"  and then type the replacement word, followed by RET.  Sometimes, ispell will question a word that you may not want to count as a misspelling, such as proper names and the like−−words that don't appear in the system dictionary. There are a few things you can do in such cases, as follows.   12. Grammar and Reference   172   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   To accept a misspelled word as correct for the current ispell session only, type a; from then on during the current session, this word will be considered correct.  If, however, you want ispell  and spell, and all other tools that access the system dictionary  to remember this word as being correct for this and all future sessions, insert the word in your own personal dictionary. Type u to insert a copy of the word uncapitalized, in all lowercase letters−−this way, even if the word is capitalized at the beginning of a sentence, the lowercase version of the word is saved. From then on, in the current ispell session and in future sessions, this word, regardless of case, will be considered correct.  When case is important to the spelling−−for example, in a word that is a proper name such as `Seattle', or a word with mixed case, such as `LaTeX'−−−type i to insert a copy of the word in your personal dictionary with its case just as it appears; this way, words spelled with the same letters but with different case will be considered misspellings.  When ispell finishes spell checking a file, it saves its changes to the file and then exits. It also makes a copy of the original file, without the changes applied; this file has the same name as the original but with `.bak' added to the end−−so in our example, the backup file is called `fall−lecture.notes.bak'. This is useful if you regret the changes you've made and want to restore the file to how it was before you mucked it up−−just remove the spell−checked file and then rename the `.bak' file to its original name.  The following table is a reference to the ispell key commands.  COMMAND Accept misspelled word as correct, but only for this particular instance.  KEY SPC number Replace the misspelled word with the suggestion that corresponds to the given number. ? a i  Display a help screen. Accept misspelled word as correct for the remainder of this ispell session. Accept misspelled word as correct and add it to your private dictionary with the capitalization as it appears. Look up words in the system dictionary according to a pattern you then give. Quit checking and restore the file to how it was before this session. Replace misspelled word with a word you type. Accept misspelled word as correct and add it to your private dictionary in all lowercase letters. Save the changes thus made, and then stop checking this file.  l q r u x  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.1.5 Spell Checking in Emacs  Emacs has several useful commands for spell checking. The ispell−word, ispell−region, and ispell−buffer functions, as you might guess from their names, use the ispell command inside Emacs to check portions of the current buffer.   12. Grammar and Reference   173   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   The first command, ispell−word, checks the spelling of the word at point; if there is no word at point, it checks the first word to the left of point. This command has a keyboard shortcut, M−$. The second command, ispell−region, checks the spelling of all words in the currently selected region of text. The third command, ispell−buffer, checks the spelling of the entire buffer.                To check the spelling of the word at point, type:  M−x ispell−word RET    To check the spelling of all words in the currently selected region of text, type:  M−x ispell−region RET    To check the spelling of all words in the current buffer, type:  M−x ispell−buffer RET  Flyspell mode is another useful Emacs spelling command that, when set in a buffer, highlights misspelled words. This function is useful when you are writing a first draft in a buffer, because it lets you catch misspellings as you type them.    To turn on Flyspell mode in a buffer, type:  M−x flyspell−mode RET  NOTE: This command is a toggle; run it again to turn it off.  To correct a word in Flyspell mode, click and release the middle mouse button on the word to pull up a menu of suggestions; you then use the mouse to select the replacement word or add it to your personal dictionary.  If there are words you frequently misspell, you can define abbrevs for them  see section Making Abbreviations in Emacs . Then, when you type the misspelled word, Emacs will automatically replace it with the correct spelling.  Finally, if you prefer the sparse, non−interactive interface of spell, you can use the Emacs interfaces to that command instead: Spell word, Spell region, and Spell buffer. When any of these commands find a misspelling, they prompt for a replacement in the minibuffer but do not offer suggestions or provide any of ispell's other features.

The latter is the kind of thing most people mean when they talk about dictionaries.  When most Unix folk talk about dictionaries, however, they almost always mean the former.   WordNet is a lexical reference system in the form of a database containing thousands of words arranged in synonym sets. You can search the database and output the results in text with the wn tool or the wnb X client  the "WordNet browser" .  Use of the X client is fairly straightforward−−type a word in the dialog box near the top of the screen, followed by RET, to get its definition s , which are displayed in the large output window underneath the dialog box.  For example, this is what appears when you do a search for the definition of the word `browse':  Between the dialog box and the output window, there are menus for searching for synonyms and other word senses. A separate menu is given for each part of speech a word may have; in the preceding example, the word `browse' can be either a noun or a verb, so two menus are shown.  To get a list of all word sense information available for a given word, run wn with the name of the word as an argument. This outputs a list of all word sense information available for the word, with each possible sense preceded with the name of the option to use to output it.   12. Grammar and Reference   175   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To output a list of word senses available for the word `browse', type:     $ wn browse RET  The following sections show how to use wn on the command line.

Use look to output a list of words in the system dictionary that begin with a given string−−this is useful for finding words that begin with a particular phrase or prefix. Give the string as an argument; it is not case sensitive.    To output a list of words from the dictionary that begin with the string `homew', type:  $ look homew RET  This command outputs words like `homeward' and `homework'.  Since the system dictionary is an ordinary text file, you can also use grep to search it for words that match a given pattern or regular expression  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns .    To list all words in the dictionary that contain the string `dont', regardless of case, type:  $ grep −i dont  usr dict words RET         12. Grammar and Reference   176                  The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list all words in the dictionary that end with `ing', type:  $ grep ing^  usr dict words RET    To list all of the words that are composed only of vowels, type:  $ grep −i '^[aeiou]*$'  usr dict words RET  To find some words that rhyme with a given word, use grep to search ` usr dict words' for words ending in the same last few characters as the word they should rhyme with  see section Matching Lines Ending with Certain Text .    To output a list of words that rhyme with `friend', search ` usr dict words' for lines ending with `end':  $ grep 'end$'  usr dict words RET  Finally, to do a search on the WordNet dictionary, use wn with one of the `−grep' options. When you give some text to search for as an argument, this command does the equivalent search as look, except only the particular kind of word sense you specify is searched: `−grepn' searches nouns, `−grepv' searches verbs, `−grepa' searches adjectives, and `−grepr' searches adverbs. You can combine options to search multiple word senses.    To search the WordNet dictionary for nouns that begin with `homew', type:    To search the WordNet dictionary for both nouns and adjectives that begin with `homew', type:  $ wn homew −grepn RET  $ wn homew −grepn −grepa RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.2.2 Listing the Definitions of a Word  To list the definitions of a word, give the word as an argument to wn, followed by the `−over' option.

A dict client exists for accessing DICT servers and outputting definitions locally; this tool is available in the `dict' package.  DICT also has a number of specialized dictionaries that are plain text files  including the author's Free Journalism Dictionary, containing jargon and terms used in the journalism and publishing professions . Their FILE project, The Free Internet Lexicon and Encyclopedia, is an effort to build a free, open source collection of modern−word, idiom, and jargon dictionaries. FILE is a volunteer effort and depends on the support of scholars and lexicographers; the DICT pages contain information on how to help contribute to this worthy project.

Grammar and Reference   179   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Old−timers probably remember these names−−the originals came with AT&T UNIX as part of the much−loved "Writer's Workbench"  WWB  suite of tools back in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 20   AT&T "unbundled" the Writer's Workbench from their UNIX version 7 product, and as the many flavors of Unix blossomed over the years, these tools were lost by the wayside−−eventually becoming the stuff of Unix lore.  In 1997, Michael Haardt wrote new Linux versions of these tools from scratch. They support both the English and German languages, and they're now part of the GNU Project.  Two additional commands that were part of the Writer's Workbench have long been standard on Linux: look and spell, described previously in this chapter.  12.3.1 Checking Text for Misused Phrases 12.3.2 Checking Text for Doubled Words 12.3.3 Checking Text for Readability 12.3.4 Checking Text for Difficult Sentences 12.3.5 Checking Text for Long Sentences     Checking for misused phrases.    Checking for doubled words.    Checking writing style.    Checking for difficult sentences.    Checking for long sentences.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.3.1 Checking Text for Misused Phrases  Use diction to check for wordy, trite, clichéd, or misused phrases in a text. It checks for all the kind of expressions William Strunk warned us about in his Elements of Style.  According to The UNIX Environment, by Andrew Walker, the diction tool that came with the old Writer's Workbench just found the phrases, and a separate command called suggest would output suggestions. In the GNU version that works for Linux systems, both functions have been combined in the single diction command.  In GNU diction, the words or phrases are enclosed in brackets `[like this]'. If diction has any suggested replacements, it gives them preceded by a right arrow, `−> like this'.  When checking more than just a screenful of text, you'll want to pipe the output to less so that you can peruse it on the screen  see section Perusing Text , or pipe the output to a file for later examination.    To check file `dissertation' for clichés or other misused phrases, type:     $ diction dissertation  less RET    To check file `dissertation' for clichés or other misused phrases, and write the output to a file   12. Grammar and Reference   180   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   called `dissertation.diction', type:  $ diction dissertation 62; dissertation.diction RET  If you don't specify a file name, diction reads text from the standard input until you type C−d on a line by itself. This is especially useful when you want to check a single sentence:     $ diction RET Let us ask the question we wish to state. RET  stdin :1: Let us [ask the question −62; ask] [we wish to state −62;  cliche, avoid ].  C−d $  To check the text of a Web page, use the text−only Web browser lynx with the `−dump' and `−nolist' options to output the plain text of a given URL, and pipe this output to diction.  If you expect there to be a lot of output, add another pipe at the end to less so you can peruse it.   To peruse a copy of the text of http:  example.org 1.html with markings for possible wordy and misused phrases, type:    $ lynx −dump −nolist http:  example.org 1.html  diction  less RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.3.2 Checking Text for Doubled Words  One of the things that diction looks for is doubled words−−words repeated twice in a row. If it finds such a sequence, it encloses the second member of the doubled pair in brackets, followed by a right arrow and the text `Double word', like `this [ this −> Double word.]'.  To check a text file for doubled words only, and not for any of the other things diction checks, use grep to find only those lines in diction's output that contain the text `Double word', if any.    To output all lines containing double words in the file `dissertation', type:  $ diction dissertation  grep 'Double word' RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]         12. Grammar and Reference   181   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    12.3.3 Checking Text for Readability  The style command analyzes the writing style of a given text. It performs a number of readability tests on the text and outputs their results, and it gives some statistical information about the sentences of the text. Give as an argument the name of the text file to check.    To check the readability of the file `dissertation', type:     $ style dissertation RET  Like diction, style reads text from the standard input if no text is given−−this is useful for the end of a pipeline, or for checking the writing style of a particular sentence or other text you type.  The sentence characteristics of the text that style outputs are as follows:    Number of characters    Number of words, their average length, and their average number of syllables    Number of sentences and average length in words    Number of short and long sentences    Number of paragraphs and average length in sentences    Number of questions and imperatives  The various readability formulas that style uses and outputs are as follows:    Kincaid formula, originally developed for Navy training manuals; a good readability for technical documentation    Automated Readability Index  ARI     Coleman−Liau formula    Flesch Reading Ease Score, which gives an approximation of readability from 0  difficult  to 100  easy     Fog Index, which gives a school−grade reading level    WSTF Index, a readability indicator for German documents    Wheeler−Smith Index, Lix formula, and SMOG−Grading tests, all readability indicators that give a school−grade reading level   12.

To output all sentences in the file `dissertation' whose ARI is greater than a value of 20, type:  $ style −r 20 dissertation RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.3.5 Checking Text for Long Sentences  Use style to output sentences longer than a certain length by giving the minimum number of words as an argument to the `−l' option.    To output all sentences longer than 14 words in the file `dissertation', type:  $ style −l 14 dissertation RET        [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   12.4 Word Lists and Reference Files  @sf{Debian}: `miscfiles' @sf{WWW}: ftp:  ftp.gnu.org pub gnu miscfiles miscfiles−1.1.tar.gz  The GNU Miscfiles are a collection of text files containing various facts and reference material, such as common abbreviations, telephone area codes, and English connective phrases.

Analyzing Text  There are many ways to use command−line tools to analyze text in various ways, such as counting the number of words in a text, creating a concordance, and comparing texts to see if  and where  they differ. There are also other tricks you can do with text that count as analysis, such as finding anagrams and palindromes, or cutting up text to generate unexpected combinations of words. This chapter covers all these topics.  13.1 Counting Text 13.2 Making a Concordance of a Text 13.3 Text Relevance 13.4 Finding Anagrams in Text 13.5 Finding Palindromes in Text 13.6 Text Cut−Ups     Counting words, lines and characters.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   13.1 Counting Text  Use the "word count" tool, wc, to count characters, words, and lines in text.  Give the name of a file as an argument; if none is given, wc works on standard input. By default, wc outputs three columns, displaying the counts for lines, words, and characters in the text.    To output the number of lines, words, and characters in file `outline', type:     $ wc outline RET  The following subsections describe how to specify just one kind of count with wc, and how to count text in Emacs.  NOTE: You can get a count of how many different words are in a text, too−−see Making a Concordance of a Text.

To output the number of words in the file `story', type:  $ wc −w story RET  To output counts for several files, first concatenate the files with cat, and then pipe the output to wc.    To output the combined number of words for all the files with a `.txt' file name extension in the current directory, type:  $ cat *.txt  wc −w RET  NOTE: To read more about concatenation with cat, see Concatenating Text.

To count the number of lines per page in the current buffer in Emacs, type:     C−x l  Emacs outputs the number of lines per page of the current buffer in the echo area.  For example, if the output in the minibuffer is   13. Analyzing Text   188   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     Page has 351 lines  69 + 283  this means that the current page contains 351 lines, and point is on line number 70−−there are 69 lines before this line, and 283 lines after this line.

A concordance−like functionality−−an alphabetical listing of all words in a text and their frequency−−can be made fairly easily with some basic shell tools: tr, sort, and uniq.    To output a word−frequency list of the text file `naked_lunch', type:  $ tr ' ' ' RET 62; ' 60; naked_lunch  sort  uniq −c RET  These commands translate all space characters to newline characters, outputting the text with each word on its own line; this is then sorted alphabetically, and that output is passed to uniq, which outputs only the unique lines−−that is, all non−duplicate lines−−while the `−c' option precedes each line with its count  the number of times it occurs in the text .  To get a word frequency count−−that is, the total number of different words in a text−−just pipe the output of the frequency list to wc with the `−l' option. This counts all the lines of its input, which in this case will be the list of unique words, one per line.    To output a count of the number of unique words in the text file `naked_lunch', type:  $ tr ' ' ' RET 62; ' 60; naked_lunch  sort  uniq −c  wc −l RET        [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   13.3 Text Relevance  The following recipes show how to analyze a given text for its relevancy to other text, either to keywords or to whole files of text.

It outputs the names of those files that are relevant to the given keywords, ranked in order of relevance; if a file does not meet the criteria, it is not output in the relevance listing.  rel takes as an option the keyword to search for in quotes; you can build a boolean expression by grouping multiple keywords in parentheses and using any of the following operators between them:  OPERATOR DESCRIPTION  & !  Logical "or." Logical "and." Logical "not."  Give as arguments the names of the files to rank.

It then outputs in a smaller window a list of suggestions−−those files that it has found−−which you can open in a new buffer.  When installing the Remembrance Agent, you create three databases of the files to use when making relevance suggestions; when remembrance−agent is running, it searches these three databases in parallel, looking for relevant text. You could create, for example, one database of saved email, one of your own writings, and one of saved documents.    To toggle the Remembrance Agent in the current buffer, type:  When remembrance−agent is running, suggested buffers will be displayed in the small `*Remembrance*' buffer at the bottom of the screen. To open a suggestion in a new buffer, type C−c r number, where number is the number of the suggestion.

Use an to find and output anagrams. Give as an argument the word or quoted phrase to use; an writes its results to the standard output.    To output all anagrams of the word `lake', type:  $ an lake RET    To output all anagrams of the phrase `lakes and oceans', type:  $ an 'lakes and oceans' RET  To limit the anagrams output to those containing a given string, specify that string with the `−c' option.    To output only anagrams of the phrase `lakes and oceans' which contain the string `seas', type:  $ an −c seas 'lakes and oceans' RET  To print all of the words that some or all letters in a given word or phrase can make, use the `−w' option. This outputs words that are not anagrams, since anagrams must contain all of the letters of the other word or phrase.    To output all of the words that can be made from the letters of the word `seas', type:  $ an −w seas RET  This command outputs all of the words that can be formed from all or some of the characters in `seas', including `see' and `as'.

Software for rearranging text in random ways has existed since the earliest text−processing tools; the popularity of these tools will never die.  The cut−up technique in literature was discovered by painter Brion Gysin and American writer William S. Burroughs in 1959; they believed it brought the montage technique of painting to the written word.  "All writing is in fact cut−ups," Burroughs wrote. 21  "A collage of words read heard overheard ... [u]se of scissors renders the process explicit and subject to extension and variation."  These recipes describe a few of the common ways to make text cut−ups; more free software tools for making cut−ups are listed at http:  dsl.org comp cutups.shtml.  13.6.1 Making Simple Text Cut−Ups 13.6.2 Making Random Word Cut−Ups 13.6.3 Making Cut−Ups in Emacs  Simple text cutups.

The program works better on larger texts, where more subtleties can be analyzed and hence more realistic−looking text is output.  Give as an argument the name of the text file to be used; by default, dadadodo outputs text to standard output until you interrupt it by typing C−c.    To output random text based on the text in the file `nova', type:  $ dadadodo nova RET  This command will output passages of random text based on the text in the file `nova' until it is interrupted by the user.  You can analyze a text and save the analysis to a file of compiled data; this analysis can then be used to generate random text when the original input text is not present.

The text in the new buffer is generated by combining random portions of the buffer by overlapping characters or words, thus  usually  creating plausible−sounding sentences. It pauses occasionally and asks whether or not you want to continue the dissociation.    To generate a Dissociated Press cut−up from the current buffer, type:  M−x dissociated−press RET  Give a positive argument to the dissociated−press function to specify the number of characters to use for overlap; give a negative argument to specify the number of words for overlap.    To generate a Dissociated Press cut−up from the current buffer, always overlapping by three characters, type:  C−u 3 M−x dissociated−press RET    To generate a Dissociated Press cut−up from the current buffer, always overlapping by one word, type:  C−u −1 M−x dissociated−press RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   13.

Formatting Text   196   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    14.1.1 Eliminating Extra Spaces in Text  To eliminate extra whitespaces within lines of text, use the fmt filter; to eliminate extra whitespace between lines of text, use cat.  Use fmt with the `−u' option to output text with "uniform spacing," where the space between words is reduced to one space character and the space between sentences is reduced to two space characters.    To output the file `term−paper' with uniform spacing, type:  $ fmt −u term−paper RET  Use cat with the `−s' option to "squeeze" multiple adjacent blank lines into one.    To output the file `term−paper' with multiple blank lines output as only one blank line, type:  $ cat −s term−paper RET  You can combine both of these commands to output text with multiple adjacent lines removed and give it a unified spacing between words. The following example shows how the output of the combined commands is sent to less so that it can be perused on the screen.    To peruse the text file `term−paper' with multiple blank lines removed and giving the text unified spacing between words, type:  $ cat −s term−paper  fmt −u  less RET  Notice that in this example, both fmt and less worked on their standard input instead of on a file−−the standard output of cat  the contents of `term−paper' with extra blank lines squeezed out  was passed to the standard input of fmt, and its standard output  the space−squeezed `term−paper', now with uniform spacing  was sent to the standard input of less, which displayed it on the screen.           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.1.2 Single−Spacing Text  There are many methods for single−spacing text. To remove all empty lines from text output, use grep with the regular expression `.', which matches any character, and therefore matches any line that isn't empty  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns . You can then redirect this output to a file, or pipe it to other commands; the original file is not altered.   14. Formatting Text   197   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To output all non−empty lines from the file `term−paper', type:  $ grep . term−paper RET  This command outputs all lines that are not empty−−so lines containing only non−printing characters, such as spaces and tabs, will still be output.  To remove from the output all empty lines, and all lines that consist of only space characters, use `[^ ].' as the regexp to search for. But this regexp will still output lines that contain only tab characters; to remove from the output all empty lines and lines that contain only a combination of tab or space characters, use `[^[:space:]].' as the regexp to search for. It uses the special predefined `[:space:]' regexp class, which matches any kind of space character at all, including tabs.    To output only the lines from the file `term−paper' that contain more than just space characters, type:  $ grep '[^ ].' term−paper RET  To output only the lines from the file `term−paper' that contain more than just space or tab characters, type:  $ grep '[^[:space:]].' term−paper RET  If a file is already double−spaced, where all even lines are blank, you can remove those lines from the output by using sed with the `n;d' expression.    To output only the odd lines from file `term−paper', type:  $ sed 'n;d' term−paper RET              [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.1.3 Double−Spacing Text  To double−space text, where one blank line is inserted between each line in the original text, use the pr tool with the `−d' option. By default, pr paginates text and puts a header at the top of each page with the current date, time, and page number; give the `−t' option to omit this header.    To double−space the file `term−paper' and write the output to the file `term−paper.print', type:   14. Formatting Text   198   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ pr −d −t term−paper 62; term−paper.print RET  To send the output directly to the printer for printing, you would pipe the output to lpr:     $ pr −d −t term−paper  lpr RET  NOTE: The pr  "print"  tool is a text pre−formatter, often used to paginate and otherwise prepare text files for printing; there is more discussion on the use of this tool in Paginating Text.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.1.4 Triple−Spacing Text  To triple−space text, where two blank lines are inserted between each line of the original text, use sed with the `'G;G'' expression.    To triple−space the file `term−paper' and write the output to the file `term−paper.print', type:  $ sed 'G;G' term−paper 62; term−paper.print RET  The `G' expression appends one blank line to each line of sed's output; using `;' you can specify more than one blank line to append  but you must quote this command, because the semicolon  `;'  has meaning to the shell−−see Passing Special Characters to Commands . You can use multiple `G' characters to output text with more than double or triple spaces.    To quadruple−space the file `term−paper', and write the output to the file `term−paper.print', type:  $ sed 'G;G;G' term−paper 62; term−paper.print RET  The usage of sed is described in Editing Streams of Text.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.1.5 Adding Line Breaks to Text        Sometimes a file will not have line breaks at the end of each line  this commonly happens during file conversions between operating systems . To add line breaks to a file that does not have them, use the text   14. Formatting Text   199   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   formatter fmt. It outputs text with lines arranged up to a specified width; if no length is specified, it formats text up to a width of 75 characters per line.    To output the file `term−paper' with lines up to 75 characters long, type:  $ fmt term−paper RET  Use the `−w' option to specify the maximum line width.    To output the file `term−paper' with lines up to 80 characters long, type:  $ fmt −w 80 term−paper RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.1.6 Adding Margins to Text  Giving text an extra left margin is especially good when you want to print a copy and punch holes in it for use with a three−ring binder.  To output a text file with a larger left margin, use pr with the file name as an argument; give the `−t' option  to disable headers and footers , and, as an argument to the `−o' option, give the number of spaces to offset the text. Add the number of spaces to the page width  whose default is 72  and specify this new width as an argument to the `−w' option.    To output the file `owners−manual' with a five−space  or five−column  margin to a new file, `owners−manual.pr', type:  $ pr −t −o 5 −w 77 owners−manual 62; owners−manual.pr RET  This command is almost always used for printing, so the output is usually just piped to lpr instead of saved to a file. Many text documents have a width of 80 and not 72 columns; if you are printing such a document and need to keep the 80 columns across the page, specify a new width of 85. If your printer can only print 80 columns of text, specify a width of 80; the text will be reformatted to 75 columns after the 5−column margin.    To print the file `owners−manual' with a 5−column margin and 80 columns of text, type:  $ pr −t −o 5 −w 85 owners−manual  lpr RET    To print the file `owners−manual' with a 5−column margin and 75 columns of text, type:   14. Formatting Text   200               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ pr −t −o 5 −w 80 owners−manual  lpr RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.1.7 Swapping Tab and Space Characters  Use the expand and unexpand tools to swap tab characters for space characters, and to swap space characters with tabs, respectively.  Both tools take a file name as an argument and write changes to the standard output; if no files are specified, they work on the standard input.  To convert tab characters to spaces, use expand. To convert only the initial or leading tabs on each line, give the `−i' option; the default action is to convert all tabs.    To convert all tab characters to spaces in file `list', and write the output to `list2', type:  $ expand list 62; list2 RET    To convert only initial tab characters to spaces in file `list', and write the output to the standard output, type:  $ expand −i list RET  To convert multiple space characters to tabs, use unexpand. By default, it only converts leading spaces into tabs, counting eight space characters for each tab. Use the `−a' option to specify that all instances of eight space characters be converted to tabs.    To convert every eight leading space characters to tabs in file `list2', and write the output to `list', type:  $ unexpand list2 62; list RET    To convert all occurrences of eight space characters to tabs in file `list2', and write the output to the standard output, type:              $ unexpand −a list2 RET  To specify the number of spaces to convert to a tab, give that number as an argument to the `−t' option.   14. Formatting Text   201            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To convert every leading space character to a tab character in `list2', and write the output to the standard output, type:  $ unexpand −t 1 list2 RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.2 Paginating Text  The formfeed character, ASCII C−l or octal code 014, is the delimiter used to paginate text. When you send text with a formfeed character to the printer, the current page being printed is ejected and a new page begins−−thus, you can paginate a text file by inserting formfeed characters at a place where you want a page break to occur.  To insert formfeed characters in a text file, use the pr filter.  Give the `−f' option to omit the footer and separate pages of output with the formfeed character, and use `−h ""' to output a blank header  otherwise, the current date and time, file name, and current page number are output at the top of each page .    To paginate the file `listings' and write the output to a file called `listings.page', type:  $ pr −f −h "" listings 62; listings.page RET  By default, pr outputs pages of 66 lines each. You can specify the page length as an argument to the `−l' option.    To paginate the file `listings' with 43−line pages, and write the output to a file called `listings.page', type:  $ pr −f −h "" −l 43 listings 62; listings.page RET  NOTE: If a page has more lines than a printer can fit on a physical sheet of paper, it will automatically break the text at that line as well as at the places in the text where there are formfeed characters.  You can paginate text in Emacs by manually inserting formfeed characters where you want them−−see Inserting Special Characters in Emacs.  14.2.1 Placing Headers on Each Page 14.2.2 Placing Text in Columns         Putting headers on a page.

By default, pr outputs text in pages of 66 lines each, with headers at the top of each page containing the date and time, file name, and page number, and footers containing five blank lines.    To print the file `duchess' with the default pr preparation, type:  $ pr duchess  lpr RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.2.2 Placing Text in Columns  You can also use pr to put text in columns−−give the number of columns to output as an argument. Use the `−t' option to omit the printing of the default headers and footers.    To print the file `news.update' in four columns with no headers or footers, type:  $ pr −4 −t news.update  lpr RET        [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.2.3 Options Available When Paginating Text  The following table describes some of pr's options; see the prinfo for a complete description of its capabilities  see section Using the GNU Info System .  OPTION DESCRIPTION +first:last Specify the first and last page to process; the last page can be omitted, so +7 begins processing  with the seventh page and continues until the end of the file is reached.   14. Formatting Text   203   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   −column −a −c  Specify the number of columns to output text in, making all columns fit the page width. Print columns across instead of down. Output control characters in hat notation and print all other unprintable characters in "octal backslash" notation. Specify double−spaced output. Separate pages of output with a formfeed character instead of a footer of blank lines  63 lines of text per 66−line page instead of 53 . Specify the header to use instead of the default; specify −h "" for a blank header.  −h header −l length Specify the page length to be length lines  default 66 . If page length is less than 11, headers  and footers are omitted and existing form feeds are ignored. Use when specifying multiple files; this option merges and outputs them in parallel, one per column. Set the number of spaces to use in the left margin  default 0 .  −d −f  −m  −o spaces −t −T −v −w width Specify the page width to use, in characters  default 72 .  Omit the header and footer on each page, but retain existing formfeeds. Omit the header and footer on each page, as well as existing formfeeds.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.3 Underlining Text  In the days of typewriters, text that was meant to be set in an italicized font was denoted by underlining the text with underscore characters; now, it's common practice to denote an italicized word in plain text by typing an underscore character, `_', just before and after a word in a text file, like `_this_'.  Some text markup languages use different methods for denoting italics; for example, in TeX or LaTeX files, italicized text is often denoted with brackets and the `\it' command, like `{\it this}'.  LaTeX files use the same format, but `\emph' is often used in place of `\it'.   You can convert one form to the other by using the Emacs replace−regular−expression function and specifying the text to be replaced as a regexp  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns .    To replace plaintext−style italics with TeX `\it' commands, type:      M−x replace−regular−expression RET   14. Formatting Text   204            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   _\ [^_]+\ _ RET \{\\it \1} RET    To replace TeX−style italics with plaintext _underscores_, type:   M−x replace−regular−expression RET \{\\it \{\ [^\}]+\ \} RET _\1_ RET  Both examples above used the special regexp symbol `\1', which matches the same text matched by the first `\  ... \ ' construct in the previous regexp. See Info file `emacs−e20.info', node `Regexps' for more information on regexp syntax in Emacs.  To put a literal underline under text, you need to use a text editor to insert a C−h character followed by an underscore  `_'  immediately after each character you want to underline; you can insert the C−h in Emacs with the C−q function  see section Inserting Special Characters in Emacs .  When a text file contains these literal underlines, use the ul tool to output the file so that it is viewable by the terminal you are using; this is also useful for printing  pipe the output of ul to lpr .    To output the file `term−paper' so that you can view underbars, type:  $ ul term−paper RET  To output such text without the backspace character, C−h, in the output, use col with the `−u' option.    To output the file `term−paper' with all backspace characters stripped out, type:  $ col −u term−paper RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.4 Sorting Text  You can sort a list in a text file with sort. By default, it outputs text in ascending alphabetical order; use the `−r' option to reverse the sort and output text in descending alphabetical order.  For example, suppose a file `provinces' contains the following:     Shantung Honan Szechwan   14. Formatting Text   205   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To sort the file `provinces' and output all lines in ascending order, type:  Hunan Kiangsu Kwangtung Fukien        $ sort provinces RET Fukien Honan Hunan Kiangsu Kwangtung Shantung Szechwan $  $ sort −r provinces RET Szechwan Shantung Kwangtung Kiangsu Hunan Honan Fukien $    To sort the file `provinces' and output all lines in descending order, type:  The following table describes some of sort's options.  OPTION DESCRIPTION −b −d −f  Ignore leading blanks on each line when sorting. Sort in "phone directory" order, with only letters, digits, and blanks being sorted.

Formatting Text   206   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    14.5 Numbering Lines of Text  There are several ways to number lines of text.  One way to do it is to use the nl  "number lines"  tool. Its default action is to write its input  either the file names given as an argument, or the standard input  to the standard output, with an indentation and all non−empty lines preceded with line numbers.    To peruse the file `report' with each line of the file preceded by line numbers, type:  $ nl report  less RET  You can set the numbering style with the `−b' option followed by an argument. The following table lists the possible arguments and describes the numbering style they select.  ARGUMENT NUMBERING STYLE a t n pregexp  Number all lines. Number only non−blank lines. This is the default. Do not number lines. Only number lines that contain the regular expression regexp  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns .  The default is for line numbers to start with one, and increment by one. Set the initial line number by giving an argument to the `−v' option, and set the increment by giving an argument to the `−i' option.    To output the file `report' with each line of the file preceded by line numbers, starting with the number two and counting by fours, type:  $ nl −v 2 −i 4 report RET    To number only the lines of the file `cantos' that begin with a period  `.' , starting numbering at zero and using a numbering increment of five, and to write the output to `cantos.numbered', type:  $ nl −i 5 −v 0 −b p'^\.' cantos 62; cantos.numbered RET  The other way to number lines is to use cat with one of the following two options: the `−n' option numbers each line of its input text, while the `−b' option only numbers non−blank lines.    To peruse the text file `report' with each line of the file numbered, type:               14. Formatting Text   207               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To peruse the text file `report' with each non−blank line of the file numbered, type:  $ cat −n report  less RET  $ cat −b report  less RET  In the preceding examples, output from cat is piped to less for perusal; the original file is not altered.  To take an input file, number its lines, and then write the line−numbered version to a new file, send the standard output of the cat command to the new file to write.    To write a line−numbered version of file `report' to file `report.lines', type:  $ cat −n report 62; report.lines RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   14.6 Reversing Text  The tac command is similar to cat, but it outputs text in reverse order. There is another difference−−−tac works on records, sections of text with separator strings, instead of lines of text. Its default separator string is the linebreak character, so by default tac outputs files in line−for−line reverse order.    To output the file `prizes' in line−for−line reverse order, type:  $ tac prizes RET   Specify a different separator with the `−s' option. This is often useful when specifying non−printing characters such as formfeeds. To specify such a character, use the ANSI−C method of quoting  see section Passing Special Characters to Commands .    To output `prizes' in page−for−page reverse order, type:  $ tac −s $'\f' prizes RET   The preceding example uses the formfeed, or page break, character as the delimiter, and so it outputs the file `prizes' in page−for−page reverse order, with the last page output first.  Use the `−r' option to use a regular expression for the separator string  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns . You can build regular expressions to output text in word−for−word   14. Formatting Text   208   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   and character−for−character reverse order:    To output `prizes' in word−for−word reverse order, type:  $ tac −r −s '[^a−zA−z0−9\−]' prizes RET     To output `prizes' in character−for−character reverse order, type:  $ tac −r −s '.\ RET ' prizes RET  To reverse the characters on each line, use rev.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.1 Searching for a Word or Phrase  The primary command used for searching through text is the rather froglike−sounding tool called grep  the origin of its name is explained in Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns, where its advanced usage is discussed . It outputs lines of its input that contain a given string or pattern.  To search for a word, give that word as the first argument. By default, grep searches standard input; give the name of a file to search as the second argument.    To output lines in the file `catalog' containing the word `CD', type:  $ grep CD catalog RET  To search for a phrase, specify it in quotes.          To output lines in the file `catalog' containing the word `Compact Disc', type:  $ grep 'Compact Disc' catalog RET  The preceding example outputs all lines in the file `catalog' that contain the exact string `Compact Disc'; it will not match, however, lines containing `compact disc' or any other variation on the case   15. Searching Text   210   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   of letters in the search pattern. Use the `−i' option to specify that matches are to be made regardless of case.    To output lines in the file `catalog' containing the string `compact disc' regardless of the case of its letters, type:  $ grep −i 'compact disc' catalog RET  This command outputs lines in the file `catalog' containing any variation of the pattern `compact disc', including `Compact Disc', `COMPACT DISC', and `comPact dIsC'.  One thing to keep in mind is that grep only matches patterns that appear on a single line, so in the preceding example, if one line in `catalog' ends with the word `compact' and the next begins with `disc', grep will not match either line. There is a way around this with grep  see section Finding Phrases Regardless of Spacing , or you can search the text in Emacs  see section Searching for a Phrase in Emacs .  You can specify more than one file to search. When you specify multiple files, each match that grep outputs is preceded by the name of the file it's in  and you can suppress this with the `−h' option.     To output lines in all of the files in the current directory containing the word `CD', type:  $ grep CD * RET    To output lines in all of the `.txt' files in the `~ doc' directory containing the word `CD', suppressing the listing of file names in the output, type:  $ grep −h CD ~ doc *.txt RET  Use the `−r' option to search a given directory recursively, searching all subdirectories it contains.    To output lines containing the word `CD' in all of the `.txt' files in the `~ doc' directory and in all of its subdirectories, type:  $ grep −r CD ~ doc *.txt RET  NOTE: There are more complex things you can search for than simple strings, as will be explained in the next section.

Searching Text   211   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    15.2 Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns  In addition to word and phrase searches, you can use grep to search for complex text patterns called regular expressions. A regular expression−−or "regexp"−−−is a text string of special characters that specifies a set of patterns to match.  Technically speaking, the word or phrase patterns described in the previous section are regular expressions−−just very simple ones. In a regular expression, most characters−−including letters and numbers−−represent themselves. For example, the regexp pattern 1 matches the string `1', and the pattern bee matches the string `bee'.  There are a number of reserved characters called metacharacters that don't represent themselves in a regular expression, but have a special meaning that is used to build complex patterns. These metacharacters are as follows: ., *, [, ], ^, $, and \.  To specify one of these literal characters in a regular expression, precede the character with a `\'.    To output lines in the file `catalog' that contain a `$' character, type:  $ grep '\$' catalog RET    To output lines in the file `catalog' that contain the string `$1.99', type:  $ grep '\$1\.99' catalog RET    To output lines in the file `catalog' that contain a `\' character, type:           $ grep '\\' catalog RET  The following table describes the special meanings of the metacharacters and gives examples of their usage.  METACHARACTER .  *  []  MEANING Matches any one character, with the exception of the newline character. For example, . matches `a', `1', `?', `.'  a literal period character , and so forth. Matches the preceding regexp zero or more times. For example, −* matches `−', `−−', `−−−', `−−−−−−−−−', and so forth. Now imagine a line of text with a million `−' characters somewhere in it, all marching off across the horizon, up into the blue sky, and through the clouds. A million `−' characters in a row. This pattern would match it. Now think of the same long parade, but it's a million and one `−' characters−−it matches that, too. Encloses a character set, and matches any member of the set−−for example, [abc] matches either `a', `b', or `c'. In addition, the   15. Searching Text   212   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   −  ^  hyphen  `−'  and caret  `^'  characters have special meanings when used inside brackets: The hyphen specifies a range of characters, ordered according to their ASCII value  see section Viewing a Character Chart . For example, [0−9] is synonymous with [0123456789]; [A−Za−z] matches one uppercase or lowercase letter. To include a literal `−' in a list, specify it as the last character in a list: so [0−9−] matches either a single digit character or a `−'.x As the first character of a list, the caret means that any character except those in the list should be matched. For example, [^a] matches any character except `a', and [^0−9] matches any character except a numeric digit. Matches the beginning of the line. So ^a matches `a' only when it is the first character on a line. Matches the end of the line. So a$ matches `a' only when it is the last character on a line. Use \ before a metacharacter when you want to specify that literal character. So \$ matches a dollar sign character  `$' , and \\ matches a single backslash character  `\' . In addition, use \ to build new Called the `alternation operator'; it Matches the preceding regexp as many times as Matches the regexp preceding it either zero or  \ \+ \? \{number\} Matches the previous regexp \ regexp\  Group regexp together for  ^  $  \  NOTE: The name `grep' derives from a command in the now−obsolete Unix ed line editor tool−−the ed command for searching globally through a file for a regular expression and then printing those lines was g re p, where re was the regular expression you'd use. Eventually, the grep command was written to do this search on a file when not using ed. 22   The following sections describe some regexp recipes for commonly searched−for patterns.  15.2.1 Matching Lines Beginning with Certain Text 15.2.2 Matching Lines Ending with Certain Text 15.2.3 Matching Lines of a Certain Length 15.2.4 Matching Lines That Contain Any of Some Regexps 15.2.5 Matching Lines That Contain All of Some Regexps 15.2.6 Matching Lines That Don't Contain a Regexp 15.2.7 Matching Lines That Only Contain     Matching text at the beginning of a  line.

To output all lines in ` usr dict words' beginning with `pre', type:  $ grep '^pre'  usr dict words RET    To output all lines in the file `book' that begin with the text `in the beginning', regardless of case, type:  $ grep −i '^in the beginning' book RET  NOTE: These regexps were quoted with ' characters; this is because some shells otherwise treat the `^' character as a special "metacharacter"  see section Passing Special Characters to Commands . 23   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.2 Matching Lines Ending with Certain Text  Use `$' as the last character of quoted text to match that text only at the end of a line.    To output lines in the file `sayings' ending with an exclamation point, type:  $ grep '!$' sayings RET  NOTE: To use `$' in a regexp to find words that rhyme with a given word, see Listing Words that Match a Pattern.   15.

To output all lines in ` usr dict words' that are exactly two characters wide, type:  $ grep '^..$'  usr dict words RET  For longer lines, it is more useful to use a different construct: `^.\{number\}$', where number is the number of lines to match. Use `,' to specify a range of numbers.    To output all lines in ` usr dict words' that are exactly seventeen characters wide, type:  $ grep '^.\{17\}$'  usr dict words RET    To output all lines in ` usr dict words' that are twenty−five or more characters wide, type:  $ grep '^.\{25,\}$'  usr dict words RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.4 Matching Lines That Contain Any of Some Regexps  To match lines that contain any of a number of regexps, specify each of the regexps to search for between alternation operators  `\'  as the regexp to search for. Lines containing any of the given regexps will be output.    To output all lines in `playlist' that contain either the patterns `the sea' or `cake', type:  $ grep 'the sea\cake' playlist RET  This command outputs any lines in `playlist' that match the patterns `the sea' or `cake', including lines matching both patterns.   15. Searching Text   215               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.5 Matching Lines That Contain All of Some Regexps  To output lines that match all of a number of regexps, use grep to output lines containing the first regexp you want to match, and pipe the output to a grep with the second regexp as an argument. Continue adding pipes to grep searches for all the regexps you want to search for.    To output all lines in `playlist' that contain both patterns `the sea' and `cake', regardless of case, type:  $ grep −i 'the sea' playlist  grep −i cake RET  NOTE: To match lines containing some regexps in a particular order, see Regexps for Common Situations.

To output all lines in ` usr dict words' that are not three characters wide, type:  $ grep −v '^...$' RET    To output all lines in `access_log' that do not contain the string `http', type:  $ grep −v http access_log RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.7 Matching Lines That Only Contain Certain Characters  To match lines that only contain certain characters, use the regexp `^[characters]*$', where characters are the ones to match.   15. Searching Text   216   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To output lines in ` usr dict words' that only contain vowels, type:  $ grep −i '^[aeiou]*$'  usr dict words RET           The `−i' option matches characters regardless of case; so, in this example, all vowel characters are matched regardless of case.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.8 Finding Phrases Regardless of Spacing  One way to search for a phrase that might occur with extra spaces between words, or across a line or page break, is to remove all linefeeds and extra spaces from the input, and then grep that.  To do this, pipe the input 24  to tr with `'\r\n:\>\−'' as an argument to the `−d' option  removing all linebreaks from the input ; pipe that to the fmt filter with the `−u' option  outputting the text with uniform spacing ; and pipe that to grep with the pattern to search for.    To search across line breaks for the string `at the same time as' in the file `notes', type:  $ cat notes  tr −d '\r\n:\62;\−'  fmt −u  grep 'at the same time as' RET  NOTE: The Emacs editor has its own special search for doing this−−see Searching for a Phrase in Emacs.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.9 Finding Patterns in Certain Contexts  To search for a pattern that only occurs in a particular context, grep for the context in which it should occur, and pipe the output to another grep to search for the actual pattern.  For example, this can be useful to search for a given pattern only when it is quoted with an `>' character in an email message.    To list lines from the file `email−archive' that contain the word `narrative' only when it is quoted, type:  $ grep '^62;' email−archive  grep narrative RET   15. Searching Text   217   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   You can also reverse the order and use the `−v' option to output all lines containing a given pattern that are not in a given context.    To list lines from the file `email−archive' that contain the word `narrative', but not when it is quoted, type:  $ grep narrative email−archive  grep −v '^62;' RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.10 Using a List of Regexps to Match From  You can keep a list of regexps in a file, and use grep to search text for any of the patterns in the file. To do this, specify the name of the file containing the regexps to search for as an argument to the `−f' option.  This can be useful, for example, if you need to search a given text for a number of words−−keep each word on its own line in the regexp file.    To output all lines in ` usr dict words' containing any of the words listed in the file `forbidden−words', type:  $ grep −f forbidden−words  usr dict words RET    To output all lines in ` usr dict words' that do not contain any of the words listed in `forbidden−words', regardless of case, type:  $ grep −v −i −f forbidden−words  usr dict words RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.2.11 Regexps for Common Situations  The following table lists sample regexps and describes what they match.

Matching lines in Web pages.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.3.1 Matching Lines in Compressed Files  Use zgrep to search through text in files that are compressed. These files usually have a `.gz' file name extension, and can't be searched or otherwise read by other tools without uncompressing the file first  for more about compressed files, see section Compressed Files .  The zgrep tool works just like grep, except it searches through the text of compressed files. It outputs matches to the given pattern as if you'd searched through normal, uncompressed files. It leaves the files compressed when it exits.   15. Searching Text   219   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To search through the compressed file `README.gz' for the text `Linux', type:  $ zgrep Linux README.gz RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.3.2 Matching Lines in Web Pages  You can grep a Web page or other URL by giving the URL to lynx with the `−dump' option, and piping the output to grep.    To search the contents of the URL http:  example.com  for lines containing the text `gonzo' or `hunter', type:     $ lynx −dump http:  example.com   grep 'gonzo\hunter' RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.4 Outputting the Context of a Search  It is sometimes useful to see a matched line in its context in the file−−that is, to see some of the lines that surround it.  Use the `−C' option with grep to output results in context−−−it outputs matched lines with two lines of "context" both before and after each match. To specify the number of context lines output both before and after matched lines, use that number as an option instead of `−C'.    To search ` usr dict words' for lines matching `tsch' and output two lines of context before and after each line of output, type:  $ grep −C tsch  usr dict words RET    To search ` usr dict words' for lines matching `tsch' and output six lines of context before and after each line of output, type:  $ grep −6 tsch  usr dict words RET  To output matches and the lines before them, use `−B'; to output matches and the lines after them, use   15. Searching Text   220   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   `−A'. Give a numeric option with either of these options to specify that number of context lines.    To search ` usr dict words' for lines matching `tsch' and output two lines of context before each line of output, type:  $ grep −B tsch  usr dict words RET    To search ` usr dict words' for lines matching `tsch' and output six lines of context after each line of output, type:  $ grep −A6 tsch  usr dict words RET    To search ` usr dict words' for lines matching `tsch' and output ten lines of context before and three lines of context after each line of output, type:  $ grep −B10 −A3 tsch  usr dict words RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.5 Searching and Replacing Text  A quick way to search and replace some text in a file is to use the following one−line perl command:     $ perl −pi −e "s oldstring newstring g;" filespec RET  In this example, oldstring is the string to search, newstring is the string to replace it with, and filespec is the name of the file or files to work on. You can use this for more than one file.    To replace the string `helpless' with the string `helpful' in all files in the current directory, type:  $ perl −pi −e "s helpless helpful g;" * RET  You can also search and replace text in an Emacs buffer; to do this, use the replace−regexp function and give both the expression to search for and the expression to replace it with.    To replace the text `helpless' with the text `helpful' in the current buffer, type:   15. Searching Text   221                  The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   M−x replace−regexp RET helpless RET helpful RET  NOTE: You can also search and replace text in most text editors, including Emacs; see Searching and Replacing in Emacs.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.6 Searching Text in Emacs  The following sections show ways of searching for text in Emacs−−incrementally, for a word or phrase, or for a pattern−−and for searching and then replacing text.  15.6.1 Searching Incrementally in Emacs 15.6.2 Searching for a Phrase in Emacs 15.6.3 Searching for a Regexp in Emacs 15.6.4 Searching and Replacing in Emacs  Searching incrementally. Searching for a word or phrase. Searching for a pattern.              Replacing text in Emacs.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.6.1 Searching Incrementally in Emacs  Type C−s to use the Emacs incremental search function. It takes text as input in the minibuffer and it searches for that text from point toward the end of the current buffer. Type C−s again to search for the next occurrence of the text you're searching for; this works until no more matches occur. Then, Emacs reports `Failing I−search' in the minibuffer; type C−s again to wrap to the beginning of the buffer and continue the search from there.  It gets its name "incremental" because it begins searching immediately when you start to type text, and so it builds a search string in increments−−−for example, if you want to search for the word `sunflower' in the current buffer, you start to type     C−s s  At that point Emacs searches forward through the buffer to the first `s' character, and highlights it. Then, as you type u, it searches forward to the first `su' in the buffer and highlights that  if a `u' appears immediately after the `s' it first stopped at, it stays where it's at, and highlights the `s' and the `u' . It continues to do this as long as you type and as long as there is a match in the current buffer. As soon as what you type does not appear in the buffer, Emacs beeps and a message appears in the minibuffer stating that the search has failed.   15. Searching Text   222   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   To search for the next instance of the last string you gave, type C−s again; if you keep CTRL held down, every time you press the S key, Emacs will advance to the next match in the buffer.  This is generally the fastest and most common type of search you will use in Emacs.  You can do an incremental search through the buffer in reverse−−−that is, from point to the beginning of the buffer−−with the isearch−backward function, C−r.    To search for the text `moon' in the current buffer from point in reverse to the beginning of the buffer, type:     C−r moon  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.6.2 Searching for a Phrase in Emacs  Like grep, the Emacs incremental search only works on lines of text, so it only finds phrases on a single line. If you search for `hello, world' with the incremental search and the text `hello,' appears at the end of a line and the text `world' appears at the beginning of the next line, it won't find it.  To find a multi−word phrase across line breaks, use the word−search−forward function. It searches for a phrase or words regardless of punctuation or spacing.    To search forward through the current buffer for the phrase `join me', type:     M−x word−search−forward RET join me RET  NOTE: The word−search−backward function does the same as word−search−forward, except it searches backward through the buffer, from point to the beginning of the buffer.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.6.3 Searching for a Regexp in Emacs  Use the search−forward−regexp function to search for a regular expression from point to the end of the current buffer.    To search forward through the current buffer for the regexp `@.*\.org', type:   15. Searching Text   223   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     M−x search−forward−regexp RET @.*\.org RET  The keyboard accelerator for this command is M−C−s−−−on most keyboards, you press and release ESC and then hold down CTRL while you type s. To repeat the last regexp search you made, type M−C−s C−s; then, as long as you have CTRL held down, you can keep typing s to advance to the next match, just as you would with an incremental search.  NOTE: There is a search−backward−regexp function that is identical but searches backward, from point to the top of the buffer.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.6.4 Searching and Replacing in Emacs  To search for and replace text in Emacs, use the replace−regexp function. When you run this function, Emacs will ask for both the text or regexp to search for and the text to replace it with.    To replace the text `day' with the text `night' in the current buffer, type:  M−x replace−regexp RET day RET night RET  This function is especially useful for replacing control characters with text, or for replacing text with control characters, which you can specify with C−q, the quoted−insert function  see section Inserting Special Characters in Emacs .    To replace all the `^M' characters in the current buffer with regular linefeeds, type:  M−x replace−regexp RET C−q C−m RET C−q 012 RET RET        [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15.7 Searching Text in Less  There are two useful commands in less for searching through text:   and ?. To search forward through the text, type   followed by a regexp to search for; to search backward through the text, use ?.  When you do a search, the word or other regexp you search for appears highlighted throughout the text.   15. Searching Text   224   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To search forward through the text you are perusing for the word `cat', type:         cat RET  ?[ch]at RET  To search backward through the text you are perusing for the regexp `[ch]at', type:  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   15. Searching Text   225    16. Typesetting and Word Processing  If you're coming to Linux with a Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS background, or from some other non−Unix computing environment, you are likely used to one approach to "word processing." In these environments, most writing is done in word processors−−large programs that offer a vast array of formatting options and that store their output in proprietary file formats. Most people use word processors no matter where the intended output will go  even if it's just your diary .  Word processors, from complete suites like StarOffice to commercial favorites like WordPerfect, are available for Linux−−and have been for years. However, the standard personal−computing paradigm known as "word processing" has never really taken off on Linux−−or, for that matter, on Unix−like operating systems in general. With Linux, most writing is done in a text editor, and files are kept in plain text.  When you keep a file in plain text, you can use command−line tools to format the pages and paragraphs; add page numbers and headers; check the spelling, style, and usage; count the lines, words, and characters it contains; convert it to HTML and other formats; and even print the text in a font of your choosing−−all of which are described in the recipes in this book. The text can be formatted, analyzed, cut, chopped, sliced, diced, and otherwise processed by the vast array of Linux command−line tools that work on text−−over 750 in an average installation.  This approach may seem primitive at first−−especially to those weaned in a computing environment that dictates that all writing must be set in a typeface from the moment of creation−−but the word−processing approach can be excessive compared to what Linux provides. You can, if you like, view or print plain text in a font, with a single command−−which is what ninety percent of people want to do with a word processor ninety percent of the time, anyway; to do this, see Converting Plain Text for Output.  It's my opinion that word processing is not a forward−thinking direction for the handling of text, especially on Linux systems and especially now that text is not always destined for printed output: text can end up on a Web page, in an "eBook," 25  in an email message, or possibly in print. The best common source for these formats is plain text. Word processing programs, and the special file formats they require, are anathema to the generalized, tools−based and plain−text philosophy of Unix and Linux  see section Unix and the Tools Philosophy . "Word processing" itself may be an obsolete idea of the 1980s personal computing environment, and it may no longer be a necessity in the age of the Web and email−−mediums in which plain text content is more native than proprietary word processor formats.  If you do need to design a special layout for hardcopy, you can typeset the text. One could write a book on the subject of Linux typesetting; unfortunately, no such book has yet been written, but this chapter contains recipes for producing typeset text. They were selected as being the easiest to prepare or most effective for their purpose.  NOTE: For more information on this subject, I recommend Christopher B.

The following table can help you determine which system is best for a particular task. There isn't one way of doing such things, of course−−these are only my recommendations.

This is often done to prepare text for printing; the original source text file remains as unformatted text, but the text of the printed output is formatted in basic ways, such as being set in a font.  The main tool for converting text to PostScript is called enscript; it converts the text file that is specified as an argument into PostScript, making any number of formatting changes in between. It's great for quickly making nice output from a plain text file−−you can use it to do things such as output text in a font of your choosing, or paginate text with graphical headers at the top of each page.  By default, enscript paginates its input, outputs it in a 10−point Courier font, and puts a simple header at the top of each page containing the file name, date and time, and page number in bold. Use the `−B' option to omit this header.  If you have a PostScript printer connected to your system, enscript can be set up to spool its output right to the printer. You can verify if your system is set up this way by looking at the enscript configuration file, ` etc enscript.cfg'. The line     DefaultOutputMethod: printer  specifies that output is spooled directly to the printer; changing it to `stdout' instead of `printer' sends the output to the standard output instead.  Even if your default printer does not natively understand PostScript, it may be able to take enscript output, anyway. Most Linux installations these days have print filters set up so that PostScript spooled for printing is automatically converted to a format the printer understands  if your system doesn't have this setup for some reason, convert the PostScript to a format recognized by your printer with the gs tool, and then print that−−see Converting PostScript .    To convert the text file `saved−mail' to PostScript, with default formatting, and spool the output right to the printer, type:     $ enscript saved−mail RET  To write the output to a file instead of spooling it, give the name of the file you want to output as an argument to the `−p' option. This is useful when you don't have a PostScript printer and you need to convert the output first, or for when you just want to make a PostScript image file from some text, or for previewing the output before you print it. In the latter case, you can view it on the display screen with a PostScript viewer application such as ghostview  see section Previewing a PostScript File .   16. Typesetting and Word Processing   228   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To write the text file `saved−mail' to a PostScript file, `saved−mail.ps', and then preview it in X, type:  $ enscript −p report.ps saved−mail RET $ ghostview saved−mail.ps RET  The following recipes show how to use enscript to output text with different effects and properties.  NOTE: Once you make a PostScript file from text input, you can use any of the tools to format this new PostScript file, including rearranging and resizing its pages  see section PostScript .  16.2.1 Outputting Text in a Font 16.2.2 Outputting Text as a Poster or Sign 16.2.3 Outputting Text with Language Highlighting 16.2.4 Outputting Text with Fancy Headers 16.2.5 Outputting Text in Landscape Orientation 16.2.6 Outputting Multiple Copies of Text 16.2.7 Selecting the Pages of Text to Output 16.2.8 Additional PostScript Output Options     Outputting text in a font.

Specify both the font family and size in points: give the capitalized name of the font family  with hyphens to indicate spaces between words  followed by the the size in points. For example, `Courier14' outputs text in the Courier font at 14 points, and `Times−Roman12.2' outputs text in the Times Roman font at 12.2 points. Some of the available font names are listed in the file ` usr share enscript afm font.map'; the enscriptman page describes how to use additional fonts that might be installed on your system.    To print the contents of the text file `saved−mail' on a PostScript printer, with text set in the Helvetica font at 12 points, type:   16. Typesetting and Word Processing   229         The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   $ enscript −B −f "Helvetica12" saved−mail RET    To make a PostScript file called `saved−mail.ps' containing the contents of the text file `saved−mail', with text set in the Helvetica font at 12 points, type:  $ enscript −B −f "Helvetica12" −p saved−mail.ps saved−mail RET  The `−B' option was used in the preceding examples to omit the output of a header on each page. When headers are used, they're normally output in 10−point Courier Bold; to specify a different font for the text in the header, give its name as an argument to the `−F' option.    To print the contents of the text file `saved−mail' to a PostScript printer, with text set in 10−point Times Roman and header text set in 18−point Times Bold, type:  $ enscript −f "Times−Roman10" −F "Times−Bold18" saved−mail RET    To make a PostScript file called `saved−mail.ps' containing the contents of the text file `saved−mail', with text and headers both set in 16−point Palatino Roman, type:  $ enscript −f "Palatino−Roman16" −F "Palatino−Roman16" −p saved−mail.ps saved−mail RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.2.2 Outputting Text as a Poster or Sign  You can output any text you type directly to the printer  or to a PostScript file  by omitting the name of the input file; enscript will read the text on the standard input until you type C−d on a new line.  This is especially useful for making a quick−and−dirty sign or poster−−to do this, specify a large font for the text, such as Helvetica Bold at 72 points, and omit the display of default headers.    To print a sign in 72−point Helvetica Bold type to a PostScript printer, type:              $ enscript −B −f "Helvetica−Bold72" RET RET CAUTION RET RET WET PAINT! RET C−d  72−point type is very large; use the `−−word−wrap' option with longer lines of text to wrap lines at word boundaries if necessary. You might need this option because at these larger font sizes, you run the risk of   16.

You can also use the `−r' option to print the text in landscape orientation, as described in Outputting Text in Landscape Orientation.    To print a sign in 63−point Helvetica Bold across the long side of the page, type:     $ enscript −B −r −−word−wrap −f "Helvetica−Bold63" RET RET RET CAUTION −− WET PAINT! RET C−d  NOTE: To make a snazzier or more detailed message or sign, you would create a file in a text editor and justify the words on each line in the file as you want them to print, with blank lines where necessary. If you're getting that complicated with it, it would also be wise to use the `−p' option once to output to a file first, and preview the file before printing it  see section Previewing a PostScript File .  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.2.3 Outputting Text with Language Highlighting  The enscript tool currently recognizes the formatting of more than forty languages and formats, from the Perl and C programming languages to HTML, email, and Usenet news articles; enscript can highlight portions of the text based on its syntax. In Unix−speak, this is called pretty−printing.  The following table lists the names of some of the language filters that are available at the time of this writing and describes the languages or formats they're used for.

To print the contents of the text file `saved−mail' with fancy headers on a PostScript printer, type:  $ enscript −G saved−mail RET    To make a PostScript file called `saved−mail.ps' containing the contents of the text file `saved−mail', with fancy headers, type:  $ enscript −G −p saved−mail.ps saved−mail RET  Without the `−G' option, enscript outputs text with a plain header in bold text, printing the file name and the time it was last modified. The `−B' option, as described earlier, omits all headers.  You can customize the header text by quoting the text you want to use as an argument to the `−b' option. Use the special symbol `$%' to specify the current page number in the header text.    To print the contents of the text file `saved−mail' with a custom header label containing the current page number, type:  $ enscript −b "Page $% of the saved email archive" saved−mail RET  NOTE: You can create your own custom fancy headers, too−−this is described in the `CUSTOMIZATION' section of the enscriptman page.

To print the contents of the text file `saved−mail' to a PostScript printer, with text set in 28−point Times Roman and oriented in landscape orientation, type:  $ enscript −f "Times−Roman28" −r saved−mail RET  The `−r' option is useful for making horizontal banners by passing output of the figlet tool to enscript  see section Horizontal Text Fonts .    To output the text `This is a long banner' in a figlet font and write it to the default printer with text set at 18−point Courier and in landscape orientation, type:  $ figlet "A long banner"  enscript −B −r −f "Courier18" RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.2.6 Outputting Multiple Copies of Text  To output multiple copies of text when sending to the printer with enscript, give the number as an argument to the `−' option. This option doesn't work when sending to a file, but note that lpr takes the same option  see section Printing Multiple Copies of a Job .    To print three copies of the text file `saved−mail' to a PostScript printer with the default enscript headers, type:  $ enscript −3 saved−mail RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.2.7 Selecting the Pages of Text to Output  To specify which pages of a text are output with enscript, give the range of page number s  as an argument to the `−a' option.   16.

This is good for printing double−sided pages: first print the odd−numbered pages, and then feed the output pages back into the printer and print the even−numbered pages.    To print the odd−numbered pages of the file `saved−mail' with the default headers, type:  $ enscript −a odd saved−mail RET    To print the even−numbered pages of the file `saved−mail' with the default headers, type:  $ enscript −a even saved−mail RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.2.8 Additional PostScript Output Options  The following table describes some of enscript's other options.

Specify the page numbers to be printed, where pages is a comma−delineated list of page numbers. Specify individual pages by their numbers, and specify a range of pages by giving the first and last page numbers in the range separated by a hyphen  `−' . The special `odd' prints odd−numbered pages and `even' prints even−numbered pages. Spool output to the printer named printer. "Pretty−print" the text written in the specified language with context highlighting. Specify the height of highlight bars, in lines  without number, the value of 2 is used .

It's a visual, graphic editor for X, but it doesn't emulate the output paper directly on the display screen. In contrast to specifying exactly how each character in the document will look  "make this word Helvetica Bold at 18 points" , you specify the structure of the text you write  "make this word a chapter heading" . And, in contrast to the WYSIWYG paradigm, its authors call the new approach WYSIWYM−−−"What you see is what you mean."  LyX comes with many document classes already defined−−such as letter, article, report, and book−−−containing definitions for the elements these document types may contain. You can change the look of each element and the look of the document as a whole, and you can change the look of individual selections of text, but with these elements available, it's rarely necessary.  Since LyX uses LaTeX as a back−end to do the actual typesetting, and LyX is capable of exporting documents to LaTeX input format, you can think of it as a way to write LaTeX input files in a GUI without having to know the LaTeX language commands.  However, even those who do use LaTeX and related typesetting languages can get some use out of LyX: many people find it quick and easy to create some documents in LyX that are much harder to do in LaTeX, such as multi−column newsletter layouts with illustrations.   One excellent example of this is http:  www.bcgs.org newsletters bcgs_newsletter−2000−01.pdf   You can also import your LaTeX files  and plain text  into LyX for further layout or manipulation.  The following recipes show how to get started using LyX, and where to go to learn more about it.   16.

It is the premier computer typesetting system−−its output surpasses or rivals all other systems to date. The advanced line and paragraph breaking, hyphenation, kerning, and other font characteristic policies and algorithms it can perform, and the level of precision at which it can do them, have yet to be matched in word processors.  The TeX system itself−−not a word processor or single program, but a large collection of files and data−−is packaged in distributions; teTeX is the TeX distribution designed for Linux.  TeX input documents are plain text files written in the TeX formatting language, which the TeX tools can process and write to output files for printing or viewing. This approach has great benefits for the writer: the plain text input files can be written with and exchanged between many different computer systems regardless of operating system or editing software, and these input files do not become obsolete or unusable with new versions of the TeX software.  Donald Knuth, the world's foremost authority on algorithms, wrote TeX in 1984 as a way to typeset his books, because he wasn't satisfied with the quality of available systems. Since its first release, many extensions to the TeX formatting language have been made−−the most notable being Leslie Lamport's LaTeX, which is a collection of sophisticated macros written in the TeX formatting language, designed to facilitate the typesetting of structured documents.  LaTeX probably gets more day−to−day use than the plain TeX format, but in my experience, both systems are useful for different kinds of documents.   The collective family of TeX and related programs are sometimes called "TeX and friends," and abbreviated as `texmf' in some TeX references 26 : for example, the supplementary files included with the bare TeX system are kept in the ` usr lib texmf' directory tree.  The following recipes describe how to begin writing input for TeX and how to process these files for viewing and printing. While not everyone wants or even has a need to write documents with TeX and LaTeX, these formats are widely used−−especially on Linux systems−−so every Linux user has the potential to encounter one of these files, and ought to know how to process them.  NOTE: "TeX" doesn't sound like the name of a cowboy, nor "LaTeX" like a kind of paint: the letters `T', `E', and `X' represent the Greek characters tau, epsilon, and chi  from the Greek `techne', meaning art and science . So the last sound in "TeX" is like the `ch' in `Bach', and "LaTeX," depending on local dialect, is pronounced either `lay−teck' or `lah−teck'. Those who become highly adept at using the system, Knuth calls "TeXnicians."   16.

By convention, TeX files always have a `.tex' file name extension. LaTeX input files sometimes have a `.latex' or `.ltx' file name extension instead, but not always−−one way to tell if a `.tex' file is actually in the LaTeX format is to use grep to search the file for the text `\document', which every LaTeX  and not TeX  document will have. So if it outputs any lines that match, you have a LaTeX file.  The regular expression to use with grep is `\\document', since backslash characters must be specified with two backslashes.     To determine whether the file `gentle.tex' is a TeX or LaTeX file, type:     $ grep '\\document' gentle.tex RET $  In this example, grep didn't return any matches, so it's safe to assume that `gentle.tex' is a TeX file and not a LaTeX file.  NOTE: For more on grep and searching for regular expressions, see Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns.

It takes as an argument the name of the TeX source file to process, and it writes an output file in DVI  "DeVice Independent"  format, with the same base file name as the source file, but with a `.dvi' extension.   16. Typesetting and Word Processing   241            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To process the file `gentle.tex', type:  $ tex gentle.tex RET  Once you have produced a DVI output file with this method, you can do the following with it:    Preview it on the screen with xdvi; see Previewing a DVI File    Print it with dvips or lpr; see Printing with Dvips    Convert it to PostScript with dvips; see Preparing a DVI File for Printing;  then, you can also convert the PostScript output to PDF or plain text   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.4.3 Processing LaTeX Files  The latex tool works just like tex, but is used to process LaTeX files.    To process the LaTeX file `lshort.tex', type:  $ latex lshort.tex RET  This command writes a DVI output file called `lshort.dvi'.  You may need to run latex on a file several times consecutively. LaTeX documents sometimes have indices and cross references, which, because of the way that LaTeX works, take two  and in rare cases three or more  runs through latex to be fully processed. Should you need to run latex through a file more than once in order to generate the proper references, you'll see a message in the latex processing output after you process it the first time instructing you to process it again.    To ensure that all of the cross references in `lshort.tex' have been generated properly, run the input file through latex once more:  $ latex lshort.tex RET  The `lshort.dvi' file will be rewritten with an updated version containing the proper page numbers in the cross reference and index entries. You can then view, print, or convert this DVI file as described in the previous recipe for processing TeX files.   16.

Then, you process this TeX or LaTeX input file to create an output file in the DVI format, which you can preview, convert, or print.  It's an old tradition among programmers introducing a programming language to give a simple program that just outputs the text `Hello, world' to the screen; such a program is usually just detailed enough to give those unfamiliar with the language a feel for its basic syntax.  We can do the same with document processing languages like TeX and LaTeX. Here's the "Hello, world" for a TeX document:  If you processed this input file with tex, it would output a DVI file that displayed the text `Hello, world' in the default TeX font, on a default page size, and with default margins.  Hello, world \end        Here's the same "Hello, world" for LaTeX:  \documentclass{article} \begin{document} Hello, world \end{document}  Even though the TeX example is much simpler, LaTeX is generally easier to use fresh "out of the box" for writing certain kinds of structured documents−−such as correspondence and articles−−because it comes with predefined document classes which control the markup for the structural elements the document contains 27 . Plain TeX, on the other hand, is better suited for more experimental layouts or specialized documents.  The TeX and LaTeX markup languages are worth a book each, and providing an introduction to their use is well out of the scope of this text. To learn how to write input for them, I suggest two excellent tutorials, Michael Doob's A Gentle Introduction to TeX, and Tobias Oetiker's The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX−−−each available on the WWW at the URLs listed above. These files are each in the respective format they describe; in order to read them, you must process these files first, as described in the two previous recipes.  Good LaTeX documentation in HTML format can be found installed on many Linux systems in the ` usr share texmf doc latex latex2e−html ' directory; use the lynx browser to view it  see section Browsing Files .  Some other typesetting systems, such as LyX, SGMLtools, and Texinfo  all described elsewhere in this   16. Typesetting and Word Processing   243   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   chapter , write TeX or LaTeX output, too−−so you can use those systems to produce said output without actually learning the TeX and LaTeX input formats.  This book was written in Emacs in Texinfo format, and the typeset output was later generated by TeX.   NOTE: The Oetiker text consists of several separate LaTeX files in the `lshort' directory; download and save all of these files.

These templates include those for creating letters and correspondence, articles and term papers, envelopes and mailing labels, 28  and fax cover sheets. If you're interested in making typeset output with TeX and LaTeX, these templates are well worth exploring.  To write a document with a template, insert the contents of the template file into a new file that has a `.tex' or `.ltx' extension, and edit that.  Use your favorite text editor to do this.   To make sure that you don't accidentally overwrite the actual template files, you can write−protect them  see section Write−Protecting a File :     $ chmod a−w template−file−names RET  In the templates themselves, the bracketed, uppercase text explains what kind of text belongs there; fill in these lines with your own text, and delete the lines you don't need. Then, process your new file with either latex or tex as appropriate, and you've got a typeset document!  The following table lists the file names of the TeX templates, and describes their use. Use tex to process files you make with these templates  see section Processing TeX Files .

SGML  "Standard Generalized Markup Language"  is not an actual format, but a specification for writing markup languages; the markup language "formats" themselves are called DTDs  "Document Type Definition" . When you write a document in an SGML DTD, you write input as a plain text file with markup tags.  The various SGML packages on Linux are currently in a state of transition. The original SGML−Tools package  known as LinuxDoc−SGML in another life; now SGMLtools v1  is considered obsolete and is no longer being developed; however, the newer SGMLtools v2  a.k.a. "SGMLtools Next Generation" and "SGMLtools '98"  is still alpha software, as is SGMLtools−lite, a new subset of SGMLtools.  In the interim, if you want to dive in and get started making documents with the early SGMLtools and the LinuxDoc DTD, it's not hard to do. While the newer DocBook DTD has become very popular, it may be best suited for technical books and other very large projects−−for smaller documents written by individual authors, such as a multi−part essay, FAQ, or white paper, the LinuxDoc DTD still works fine.  And since the Linux HOWTOs are still written in LinuxDoc, the Debian project has decided to maintain the SGMLtools 1.0 package independently.  The SGML−Tools User's Guide comes installed with the `sgml−tools' package, and is available in several formats in the ` usr doc sgml−tools' directory. These files are compressed; if you want to   16. Typesetting and Word Processing   245   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   print or convert them, you have to uncompress them first  see section Compressed Files .  To peruse the compressed text version of the SGML−Tools guide, type:    $ zless  usr doc sgml−tools guide.txt.gz RET    To print a copy of the PostScript version of the SGML−Tools guide to the default printer, type:     $ zcat  usr doc sgml−tools guide.ps.gz  lpr RET  16.5.1 Elements of an SGML Document 16.5.2 Checking SGML Document Syntax    Checking SGML document syntax. 16.5.3 Generating Output from SGML    Making output from SGML source.

A very simple "Hello, world" example in the LinuxDoc DTD might look like this:     60;!doctype linuxdoc system62; 60;article62; 60;title62;An Example Document 60;author62;Ann Author 60;date62;4 May 2000 60;abstract62; This is an example LinuxDoc document. 60; abstract62;  60;sect62;Introduction  60;p62;Hello, world.  60; article62;  A simple example document and the various output files it generates are on the SGMLtools site at http:  www.sgmltools.org old−site example index.html.  The SGMLtools package also comes with a simple example file, `example.sgml.gz', which is installed in the ` usr doc sgml−tools' directory.   16.

To check the SGML file `myfile.sgml', type:  $ sgmlcheck myfile.sgml RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.5.3 Generating Output from SGML  The following table lists the SGML converter tools that come with SGMLtools, and describes the kind of output they generate. All take the name of the SGML file to work on as an argument, and they write a new file with the same base file name and the file name extension of their output format.  DESCRIPTION  TOOL sgml2html Generates HTML files. sgml2info Generates a GNU Info file. Generates a LyX input file. sgml2lyx sgml2latex Generates a LaTeX input file  useful for printing; first process as in Processing LaTeX Files,  sgml2rtf sgml2txt sgml2xml  and then print the resultant DVI or PostScript output file . Generates a file in Microsoft's "Rich Text Format." Generates plain text format. Generates XML format.    To make a plain text file from `myfile.sgml', type:  $ sgml2txt myfile.sgml RET  This command writes a plain text file called `myfile.txt'.  To make a PostScript or PDF file from an SGML file, first generate a LaTeX input file, run it through LaTeX to make a DVI output file, and then process that to make the final output.   16. Typesetting and Word Processing   247               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To make a PostScript file from `myfile.sgml', type:  $ sgml2latex myfile.sgml RET $ latex myfile.latex RET $ dvips −t letter −o myfile.ps myfile.dvi RET $  In this example, sgml2latex writes a LaTeX input file from the SGML source file, and then the latex tool processes the LaTeX file to make DVI output, which is processed with dvips to get the final output: a PostScript file called `myfile.ps' with a paper size of US letter.  To make a PDF file from the PostScript file, you need to take one more step and use ps2pdf, part of the gs or Ghostscript package; this converts the PostScript to PDF.    To make a PDF file from the PostScript file `myfile.ps', type:  $ ps2pdf myfile.ps myfile.pdf RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   16.6 Other Word Processors and Typesetting Systems  The following table describes other popular word processors and typesetting tools available for Linux.

This chapter discusses the most popular kinds of fonts used on Linux systems: display fonts for use in the X Window System, fonts for use in virtual consoles, and the "fonts" often seen in Usenet and email composed entirely of ASCII characters.  Omitted are reference of the use of fonts with TeX, which are the kind of fonts you're most likely to use when producing typeset output−−it is beyond the scope of this book to cover that issue with the space it needs. However, to print a text file with a font, see Outputting Text in a Font.

The recipe that describes how to do this is in Specifying a Window Font.  When you specify a font as an option, you have to give the X font name, which is the exact name used to specify a specific font in X.  An easy way to get the X font name is described in the first recipe in this section.  X font names consist of 14 fields, delimited by  and beginning with  a hyphen. All fields must be specified, and empty fields are permitted:     −fndry−fmly−wght−slant−swdth−adstyl−pxlsz −ptsz−resx−resy−spc−avgwdth−rgstry−encdng  The preceding line was split because of its length, but X font names are always given on one line.  The following table describes the meaning of each field.  FIELD  DESCRIPTION   17. Fonts   250   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   fndry fmly wght  slant  swdth  The type foundry that digitized and supplied the font data. The name of the typographic style  for example, `courier' . The weight of the font, or its nominal blackness, the degree of boldness or thickness of its characters. Values include `heavy', `bold', `medium', `light', and `thin'. The posture of the font, usually `r'  for `roman', or upright , `i'  `italic', slanted upward to the right and differing in shape from the roman counterpart , or `o'  `oblique', slanted but with the shape of the roman counterpart . The proportionate width of the characters in the font, or its nominal width, such as `normal', `condensed', `extended', `narrow', and `wide'.  adstyl Any additional style descriptions the particular font takes, such as `serif'  fonts that have small strokes drawn on the ends of each line in the character  or `sans serif'  fonts that omit serifs . The height, in pixels, of the type. Also called body size. The height, in points, of the type. The horizontal screen resolution the font was designed for, in dpi  "dots per inch" . The vertical screen resolution the font was designed for, in dpi. The kind of spacing used by the font  its escapement class ; either `p'  a proportional font containing characters with varied spacing , `m'  a monospaced font containing characters with constant spacing , or `c'  a character cell font containing characters with constant spacing and constant height .  pxlsz ptsz resx resy spc  avgwdth The average width of the characters used in the font, in 1 10th pixel units. rgstry The international standards body, or registry, that owns the encoding. encdng The registered name of this character set, or its encoding.  17.1.1 Selecting an X Font Name 17.1.2 Listing Available X Fonts 17.1.3 Displaying the Characters in an X Font 17.1.4 Resizing the Xterm Font  Selecting an X font name.

Use the mouse to select items from each menu, and the X font you have selected is shown in the main window. Above it is written its X font name.    To make the X font name the X selection, click the mouse on the button labeled select.  This example makes the X font name the X selection, which makes it possible to paste the X font name to a command line or into another window  see section Pasting Text .

Supply a pattern in quotes as an argument, and it outputs the names of all X fonts installed on the system that match that pattern; by default, it lists all fonts.    To list all the X fonts on the system whose name contains the text `rea', type:    To list all the X fonts on the system, type:  $ xlsfonts RET  $ xlsfonts '*rea*' RET    To list all the bold X fonts on the system, type:  $ xlsfonts '*bold*' RET            17.

The xterm tool is usually used to run a shell while in X, and many people like to specify which font is used for this window.  To resize the current font when the xterm is running, press and hold CTRL and right−click anywhere in the xterm window. A menu will appear that gives you the size options, from Unreadable and Tiny to Huge. To resize the font to its original size, choose Default.

Console fonts are stored in the ` usr share consolefonts' directory as compressed files; to install new console fonts, have the system administrator make a ` usr local share consolefonts' directory and put the font files in there.  These recipes show how to set the console font, and how to display a table containing all of the characters in the current font.   17.

To set the console font to the scrawl_w font, type:  $ consolechars −f scrawl_w RET  Some font files contain more than one height  or size  of the font. If a font contains more than one encoding for different heights, give the height to use as an argument to the `−H' option.  If you try to do it without the option anyway, consolechars will output a list of available sizes.   Common console font heights include 8  for 8x8 fonts , 14  for 8x14 fonts , and 16  for 8x16 fonts .

The making of "fonts"  and even pictures  from the arrangement of ASCII characters is known as ascii art.

Give the text to output as an argument, quoting text containing shell metacharacters  see section Passing Special Characters to Commands .    To output the text `news alert' in the default figlet font, type:     $ figlet news alert RET  This command outputs the following:                                      _           _     _ __   _____      _____    __ _  ___ _ __ _   '_ \   _ \ \  \     __    _`    _ \ '__ __      __ \ V  V  \__ \   _    __     _  _ _\___ \_ \_  ___   \__,__\____   \__  Fonts for figlet are kept in the ` usr lib figlet' directory; use the `−f' option followed by the base name of the font file  without the path or extension  to use that font.  To output the contents of a text file with a figlet font, use cat to output the contents of a file and pipe the output to figlet.   17. Fonts   255            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To output the text of the file `poster' in the figlet `bubble' font, type:  $ cat poster  figlet −f bubble RET  NOTE: The `bubble' font is installed at ` usr lib figlet bubble.flf'.

You can use zgv to browse through the filesystem and select images to view, or give as arguments the names of image files to view. It recognizes many image formats, including GIF, JPEG, PNG, PBM PNM PPM, TGA and PCX; one of its nicest features is that it can fill the entire screen with an image.  When you run zgv with no options, it displays image icons of any images in the current directory, listing any subdirectories as folder icons. You can also give the name of a directory as an argument in order to browse the images in that directory.    To browse the images in the current directory, type:  $ zgv RET        $ zgv  usr share gimp scripts RET    To browse the images in the ` usr share gimp scripts' directory, type:  Use the arrow keys to navigate through the file display; the red border around a image or directory icon indicates which image or subdirectory is selected. Type RET to view the selected image or to change to the selected directory.  You can manipulate the images you view in a number of ways−−zoom the image magnification in and out, change the brightness and color, and even make automatic "slide shows" of images. The following table describes some of zgv's options.  OPTION DESCRIPTION −c  Toggle image centering. Images are centered on screen by default; specifying this option turns off centering. Ignore errors due to corrupted files, and display whatever portion of the file is displayable. Start zgv in slide−show mode, where it loops through all images specified as arguments, continuously, until you interrupt it. Toggle mouse support. Mouse support is off by default; this option turns it on. Reread and redisplay every image after every integer seconds.

While viewing images in a browser doesn't offer much flexibility  you can't zoom in on a portion of the image, or get information about the image resolution and other details , if you simply want to quickly view an image file while you are in X, and you have a Web browser running, it can be a quick and easy way to do it.  To view an image file in a Web browser, specify a file: URL pointing to the file name of the image in the Location field of the browser.    To view the file ` usr share images mondrian−15.jpeg', type:  file: usr share images mondrian−15.jpeg RET  Notice that the given file: URL only has one preceding slash, pointing to the root directory, and not two, as in http:  .

One very useful package for both transforming images and converting between image formats is the netpbm suite of utilities  see section Scanning Images . Another is the ImageMagick suite of imaging tools, of which mogrify is particularly useful for performing fast command line image transforms; use it to change the size of, to rotate, or to reduce the colors in an image.  mogrify always takes the name of the file to work on as an argument, and it writes its changes to that file. Use a hyphen  `−'  to specify the standard input, in which case mogrify writes its output to the standard output.  I'll use the image `phoenix.jpeg' in the examples that follow to give you an understanding of how to use mogrify:   19. Editing Images   268   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: You can also perform many of the image transformations described in the following sections interactively with the GIMP  see section Editing Images with the GIMP .  19.1.1 Changing the Size of an Image 19.1.2 Rotating an Image 19.1.3 Adjusting the Colors of an Image 19.1.4 Annotating an Image 19.1.5 Adding Borders to an Image 19.1.6 Making an Image Montage 19.1.7 Combining Images 19.1.8 Morphing Two Images Together     Changing the size of an image.    Rotating an image.    Reducing the colors in an image.    Annotating an image.       Making a montage of images.    Combining images.    Morphing two images.  Putting a border around an image.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   19.1.1 Changing the Size of an Image  To resize an image with mogrify, use the `−geometry' option with the width and height values, in pixels, as an argument.    To resize `phoenix.jpeg' to 480x320 pixels, type:     $ mogrify −geometry 480x320 phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' file to:   19. Editing Images   269   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: Images scaled to a larger size will appear blocky or fuzzy.  When mogrify resizes an image, it maintains the image's aspect ratio, so that the ratio between the width and height stays the same. To force a conversion to a particular image size without necessarily preserving its aspect ratio, append the geometry with an exclamation point.    To resize `phoenix.jpeg' to exactly 480x320 pixels, regardless of aspect ratio, type:     $ mogrify −geometry 640x480! phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' to:   19. Editing Images   270   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   You can also specify the width or height by percentage. To decrease by a percentage, give the value followed by a percent sign  `%' . To increase by a percentage, give the value plus 100 followed by a percent sign. For example, to increase by 25 percent, give `125%'.    To increase the height of `phoenix.jpeg' by 25 percent and decrease its width by 50 percent, type:     $ mogrify −geometry 125%x50% phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' to:  NOTE: To view an image at a particular scale without modifying it, use display; when you resize its window, you resize the image on the screen only  see section Resizing a Window .   19.

If the image width exceeds its height, follow this number with a `>', and if the height exceeds its width, follow it with a ` ' are shell redirection operators, enclose this argument in quotes, omitting either if the image height and width are the same.     To rotate `phoenix.jpeg', whose height exceeds its width, by 90 degrees, type:  $ mogrify −rotate '9060;' phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' to:  NOTE: After this command, the width of `phoenix.jpeg' now exceeds its height, so to rotate it again use `>' instead of `<'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   19.1.3 Adjusting the Colors of an Image  You can use mogrify to make a number of adjustments in the color of an image. To reduce the number of colors in an image, use the `−colors' option, followed by the number of colors to use.    To reduce the colors in `phoenix.jpeg' to two, type:  $ mogrify −colors 2 phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' to:   19. Editing Images   272         The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Use the `−dither' option to reduce the colors with Floyd−Steinberg error diffusion, a popular algorithm for improving image quality during color reduction.    To reduce the colors in `phoenix.jpeg' to four and apply Floyd−Steinberg error diffusion, type:  $ mogrify −colors 4 −dither phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' to:  Use the `−map' option with a second file name as an argument to read the color map, or the set of colors, from the second image and use them in the first image.    To change the colors in the file `rainbow.jpeg' to those used in the file `prism.jpeg', type:  $ mogrify −map prism.jpeg rainbow.jpeg RET  Use the `−monochrome' option to make a color image black and white.    To make the color image `rainbow.jpeg' black and white, type:  $ mogrify −monochrome rainbow.jpeg RET  If you have a PPM file, use ppmquant to quantize, or reduce to a specified quantity the colors in the image−−see the ppmquantman page for details  see section Reading a Page from the System Manual .  Because of differences in display hardware, the brightness of an image may vary from one computer system   19. Editing Images   273            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   to another. For example, images created on a Macintosh usually appear darker on other systems. When you adjust the brightness of an image it is called gamma correction.  To adjust the brightness of an image, give the numeric level of correction to apply as an argument to the `−gamma' option. Most PC displays have a gamma value of 2.5, while Macintosh displays have a lower gamma value of 1.4.    To set the gamma correction of the image `rainbow.jpeg' to .8, type:  $ mogrify −gamma .8 rainbow.jpeg RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   19.1.4 Annotating an Image  @sf{Debian}: `libjpeg−progs' @sf{WWW}: http:  www.ijg.org   To annotate an image file with a comment, use mogrify with the `−comment' option, giving the comment in quotes as an argument to the option. This is useful for adding a copyright  or copyleft  statement to an image, or for annotating an image file with a URL.    To annotate the image file `phoenix.jpeg', type  all on one line :  $ mogrify −comment "If you can read this,  you're too close!" phoenix.jpeg RET   You won't see the annotation when you view the image; it is added to the image header in the file. You can, however, read image annotations with tools that display information about an image file, such as display or the GIMP. To read annotations in JPEG files, you can also use the rdjpgcom tool−−it outputs any comments in the JPEG file whose file name is given as an argument.    To read any comments made in the image file `phoenix.jpeg', type:  $ rdjpgcom phoenix.jpeg RET If you can read this, you're too close! $  NOTE: Another method for writing comments in JPEG files is to use wrjpgcom, which is distributed with rdjpgcom in the `libjpeg−progs' package.            19.

To add a border two pixels wide and four pixels high to `phoenix.jpeg', type:  $ mogrify −border 2x4 phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' to:  NOTE: The border is added to the outside of the existing image; the image is not cropped or reduced in size to add the border.  The `−frame' option works like `−border', but it adds a more decorative border to an image.    To add a decorative frame eight pixels wide and eight pixels high to `phoenix.jpeg', type:  $ mogrify −frame 8x8 phoenix.jpeg RET  This transforms the original `phoenix.jpeg' to:         19.

It takes as arguments the names of the images to use followed by the name of the output file to write the montage image to.  The montage image is made by scaling all of the input images to fit the largest size possible up to 120x120 pixels, and tiling these images in rows of five and columns of four.    To create a montage from the files `owl.jpeg', `thrush.jpeg', and `warbler.jpeg' and write it to `endangered−birds.png', type:     $ montage owl.jpeg thrush.jpeg warbler.jpeg endangered−birds.png RET  NOTE: In this example, three JPEGs were read and output to a PNG file; to specify the format to use in the output, give the appropriate file extension in the output file name.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   19.1.7 Combining Images  Use combine to combine two images into one new image−−give the names of the two source image files and the new file to write to as arguments. Without any options, it makes a new image file by overlaying the smaller of the two images over the larger, starting in the top left corner; if both images are the same size, only the second image is visible.    To combine two images, `ashes.jpeg' and `phoenix.jpeg', into a new file `picture.jpeg', type:  $ combine ashes.jpeg phoenix.jpeg picture.jpeg RET  You can specify the percentage to blend two images together with the `−blend' option.

Give the name of the file to convert as the first argument, and the destination file as the second argument. When you convert a file, the original is not altered.  To specify the file type to convert to, use that file type's standard file extension in the file name of the converted file.    To convert the JPEG file `phoenix.jpeg' to a PNG image, type:     $ convert phoenix.jpeg phoenix.png RET  This command converts the JPEG image `phoenix.jpeg' to PNG format and writes it to a new file, `phoenix.png'.  The following table lists the file extensions to use and describes their format.  The convention is to give extensions in all lowercase letters.   FILE EXTENSION bmp cgm cmyk eps fax fig fpx gif  IMAGE FORMAT  Microsoft Windows bitmap image. Computer Graphics Metafile format. Raw cyan, magenta, yellow, and black bytes.

Color X Window System window "dump" file format.  When converting a file to JPEG format, be sure to use the `−interlace NONE' option to make sure the resultant JPEG image is non−interlaced−−unless, of course, you want an interlaced image; an interlaced image is drawn in multiple passes, and is often used on the Web where a reader may view the low−resolution image consisting of early passes before the entire image is downloaded. A non−interlaced image is drawn in one single pass.  For example, use convert to convert a PNM file to non−interlaced JPEG, while sharpening it, adding a border, and adding a copyright statement.    To convert the PNM file `pike.pnm' to non−interlaced JPEG while sharpening the image by 50 percent and adding both a 2x2 border and a copyright comment, type:     $ convert −interlace NONE −sharpen 50 −border 2x2 −comment 'copyright 1999 MS' pike.pnm pike.jpeg RET  This command writes its output to a file `pike.jpeg'. Notice that the options `−border' and `−comment' were previously described for the `mogrify' tool. Some ImageMagick tools share common options, which is useful if you are making multiple changes to an image file at once; only one tool is needed for the job.  NOTE: Some image formats are "lossy," in that some image information is lost when you convert to it. For example, the JPEG format is a lossy format that is usually used for photographic images. If you convert a file from its source PNM format to JPEG and then back to PNM, the resultant PNM will not be identical to the original source PNM.  To convert image files interactively, use the GIMP to open the image, and then choose `Save as' from the File menu, and select the file type to use; see Editing Images with the GIMP.

Using gimp you can also convert image files, retouch and edit photographic images, and browse collections of images.  The GIMP comes with hundreds of tools, filters, fonts, and other goodies installed. Here is a partial list of its features:    Contains a full suite of painting tools, including Brush, Pencil, Airbrush, and Clone.    Supports custom brushes and patterns.    Includes a full suite of image selection, transformation, and manipulation tools, including a gradient editor, color blending, and special effects.    Allows for large images, with their size being limited only by available disk space.    Includes animation support.    Permits the use of layers and channels.    Provides high−quality anti−aliasing.    Offers full alpha−channel support.    Supports command scripting.    Permits multiple undo and redo, limited only by available disk space.    Allows multiple images to be open simultaneously.    Supports all popular file formats, including GIF, JPEG, PNG, XPM, TIFF, TGA, MPEG, PS, PDF, PCX, and BMP.    Allows the easy addition of more than 100 plug−ins for new file formats and new effect filters.  The GIMP runs under X and is started by running gimp or choosing it from your window manager's menu. When started, the GIMP looks like this:   19.

In this chapter, I'll show how to import images from scanners and Kodak PhotoCD discs. We'll begin with recipes for taking screen shots.  20.1 Taking Screen Shots 20.2 Scanning Images 20.3 Extracting PhotoCD Images    Taking images off a Kodak PhotoCD.     Taking screen shots.

The following recipes show you how to take screen shots in X and in the console.  20.1.1 Taking a Screen Shot in X 20.1.2 Taking a Screen Shot in a Console     Taking an X screen shot.    Taking a console screen shot.

As with other ImageMagick tools, the image format of the output file depends on the file extension you specify: `.eps' for EPS, `.tiff' for TIFF, `.jpeg' for JPEG, and so on.  For a complete list, see Converting Images between Formats .  After you give the command, the mouse pointer changes to a set of cross−hairs. You then use the mouse to specify which window to take the shot of, as follows:   20. Importing Images   283   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     Left−click on a window to capture it.    Left−click on the root window to capture the entire screen.    Left−click and drag the mouse across an area of the screen to form a rectangular selection outline; release the mouse button to capture the selected area.  When you specify a window, import captures only the window's contents; use the `−frame' option to include the window manager frame in the image.    To capture a particular window, including its window manager frame, and write it to a PNG−format file, first type:  $ import −frame session−1.png RET    Then, left−click on the window you want to capture.  In this example, the capture is saved to a file called `session−1.png'.  NOTE: The system bell rings once when the screen capture starts, and twice when the captures finishes.

For example, if the target console is the first virtual console  which you would see by typing ALT−F1 , the device to cat is ` dev vcs1'.    To take a screen shot of the fourth virtual console, and save it to a file called `screenshot', type:  $ cat  dev vcs4 62; screenshot RET  NOTE: You must have superuser privileges to access these files  see section Administrative Issues .  Take the screen shot from a virtual console different from the one you want to take a shot of; if you try to take it from the same console you want to capture, the command line you give will be included in the shot!  Kind of like having your thumb in front of the lens while taking a photograph.   Screenshots taken of virtual consoles, as shown here, are saved as text files; you can't take screen shots of virtual consoles when graphics are displayed.   20.

SANE works with a wide array of scanning hardware, but make sure the scanning hardware you want to use is compatible by checking the Hardware HOWTO and SANE's list of supported scanners.  Once you have SANE running, you can scan images with SANE−aware applications like the GIMP  see section Editing Images with the GIMP .  The following recipes describe use of the command−line scanimage tool, which comes with the SANE package.  NOTE: As the acronym implies, getting a scanner to work on a Linux system hasn't always been smooth going. The SANE interface is completely open, and its developers are making sure that it is generalized enough to be implementable on any hardware or operating system.  20.2.1 Listing Available Scanner Devices 20.2.2 Testing a Scanner 20.2.3 Scanning an Image     Listing available scanners.

Most scanners let you specify the x and y values, in pixels, for the image size to scan, starting from the top−left corner of the scanner bed. Give these coordinates as arguments to the `−x' and `−y' options. Also, give an argument to the `−−resolution' option to specify the scan resolution, given in dpi  "dots per inch" . Common resolution values include 72, 120, 300, and 600 dpi; 72 dpi is the most popular resolution for use on the Web or for viewing on screen, and 204 dpi is often used for images that you want to send on a fax machine.  Scanned output is sent to standard output, so to scan an image to a file, redirect the standard output.  scanimage outputs images in the PNM  "portable anymap"  formats, so make sure that you have the   20.

Use the `−−mode' option to specify the format of the output, followed by one of the following arguments: `color' for color PPM, `gray' for PGM grayscale, or `lineart' for black and white PBM. Each scanner has a default mode; for most color scanners, the default mode will be `color'.    To make a 72 dpi scan of a color image 200 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall, using the UNIX scanner from previous examples, and writing to a file called `scan.ppm', type:  $ scanimage −d umax: dev sgb −−resolution 72 −x 200 −y 100 62;  scan.ppm RET    To make a 300 dpi scan of a black and white image 180 pixels wide and 225 pixels tall, using the UMAX scanner from previous examples, and writing to a file called `scan.pbm', type:  $ scanimage −d umax: dev sgb −−resolution 300 −−mode lineart −x 180 −y 225 62; scan.pbm RET  NOTE: The command lines in this recipe are split across two lines because they're too long to fit on one, but type these commands on one long line.  Once the image has been scanned and written to a file, you can edit it just as you would any image.

If you are browsing the disc with the xpcd tool, then choose an image, extract a copy at the desired resolution, and save it to a file, as described in Browsing PhotoCD Archives.  You can also use pcdtoppm on a PCD file directly to extract an image at a given resolution and save it to a file in PPM format. Use the `−r' option to specify the resolution to extract, given as a numeric argument from 1  lowest resolution  to 5  highest ; if this option is omitted, a value of 3 is assumed. Also give as arguments the name of the PCD file to read from and the name of the PPM file to write to.   20.

PostScript files are text files containing the PostScript commands for drawing images to be printed on pages.  Like plain text files, PostScript files are commonly found on the Internet  and are used by commercial printers  because, as with plain text, they can be shared across platforms and hardware without difficulty. The same PostScript file can be output on a high−end display or printed on a low−end printer, to the best of that hardware's capability. PostScript is a compact and elegant format.  While it's possible to write directly in the PostScript language, and some people have become adept at programming PostScript, so many tools and applications convert files to and from PostScript that you don't have to. See section Converting Plain Text for Output, for a way to convert plain text into PostScript.  Ghostscript is a free implementation of the PostScript language. The gs tool is a Ghostscript interpreter that is used to convert files from PostScript to other formats, usually for printing to a non−PostScript printer  see section Preparing a PostScript File for Printing . The ghostview tool is used to preview PostScript files on the screen  see section Previewing a PostScript File .  EPS, or Encapsulated PostScript, is a file format that describes the contents of a box within a page. EPS files can be embedded in the page of a PostScript file, and are therefore commonly used when inserting an illustration into a document  for example, all of the illustrations in the Cookbook are EPS format files . You can view and print EPS files just as you would PostScript files.  This chapter includes recipes for formatting and manipulating PostScript files. Recipes are separated according to whether they work on the individual, logical pages in a PostScript file  the numbered pages in the file that are not necessarily the physical pages of output , and those that work on the entire file as a whole.  Unless otherwise indicated, the tools in this chapter are part of Angus Duggan's PSUtils package. These tools can be useful for other purposes than those described below; see their respective man pages for more details.  21.1 Manipulating PostScript Pages 21.2 Manipulating PostScript Documents    Manipulating a PostScript file as a whole. 21.3 Converting PostScript     Converting PostScript to other formats.

PostScript   291   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Give the pages to select as arguments to the `−p' option; you can list single pages and ranges of pages separated by commas. Give ranges as two numbers between a hyphen; thus, `4−6' specifies pages four through six, inclusive. If you omit the first number in a pair, the first page is assumed, and if you omit the last number, the last page is assumed. Pages are written to the new file in the order they are specified.  To select page 47 from the PostScript file `newsletter.ps' and output it to the file `selection.ps', type:    $ psselect −p47 newsletter.ps selection.ps RET    To select the first ten pages, page 104, pages 23 through 28, and page 2 from the file `newsletter.ps' and write it to the file `selection.ps', type:  $ psselect −p1−10,104,23−28,2 newsletter.ps selection.ps RET  In the preceding example, page 2 is selected twice.

To make a new PostScript file, `double.ps', putting two pages from the file `single.ps' on each page, type:  $ psnup −2 single.ps double.ps RET  To specify the paper size, give the name of a standard paper size as an argument to the `−p' option: a3, a4, a5, b5, letter, legal, tabloid, statement, executive, folio, quarto, or 10x14. You can also specify any height and width with the `−h' and `−w' options; units can be specified in centimeters  followed by `cm'  or inches  followed by `in' . If no size is specified, psnup assumes a paper size of a4.  Use the `−l' option when pages are in landscape orientation  rotated 90 degrees counter−clockwise from portrait orientation , and `−r' when pages are in seascape orientation  rotated 90 degrees clockwise from portrait orientation .  Pages are placed in "row−major" layout in the output file, where logical pages are placed in rows across the page. Use the `−c' option to specify a "column−major" layout, where logical pages are placed in columns down the page. Scale the size of the pages by giving a percentage to multiply the page size by as an argument to the `−s' option; for example, `−s .5' scales pages to 50 percent of their original size.   21. PostScript   293   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   To draw a border around each page, specify the border's width in points as an argument to the `−d' option  if no width is specified, a value of 1 is assumed .

To rearrange the pages of a PostScript file by signature−−usually for printing the file as a book or booklet−−use psbook. Give as arguments the name of the PostScript file to read from and the name to use for the output file; it reads the contents of the first, rearranges the pages, and then writes the PostScript output to the second file.    To rearrange the pages of file `newsletter.ps' into a signature and write it to the file `newsletter.bound.ps', type:  $ psbook newsletter.ps newsletter.bound.ps RET  By default, psbook uses one signature for the entire file. If the file doesn't contain a multiple of four pages, it adds blank pages to the end.  To specify the size of the signature to use−−in other words, the number of pages that will appear on a single piece of paper−−give the number as an argument to the `−s' option. Signature size is always a multiple of four.    To rearrange the pages of file `newsletter.ps' into an eight−sided signature and write it to `newsletter.bound.ps', type:        $ psbook −s8 newsletter.ps newsletter.bound.ps RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   21.2 Manipulating PostScript Documents  These recipes work on a PostScript document as a whole.   21.

It takes as arguments the file to resize and the output file to write to; you must also specify the page size of the output file, using the same format as with the psnup tool: use `−p' or `−h' and `−w' to specify the size of the output file, and use `−P' to specify the size of the input file  see section Combining PostScript Pages .    To resize the PostScript file `double.ps' to US letter−sized paper, writing output to a new file, `doublet.ps', type:  $ psresize −pletter double.ps doublet.ps RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   21.2.2 Combining PostScript Documents  Use psmerge to concatenate and merge multiple PostScript files into a single file. Give the names of the files to be merged as arguments, and psmerge outputs them to the standard output in the order given. You can also specify an output file name with the `−o' option  don't put any spaces between the file name and the option .    To merge the files `slide1.ps', `slide2.ps', and `slide3.ps' into a new PostScript file, `slideshow.ps', type:  $ psmerge −oslideshow.ps slide1.ps slide2.ps slide3.ps RET  NOTE: As of this writing, psmerge only works with PostScript files that were made with the same application−−which means, for example, that you can merge multiple files made with TeX, or multiple files made with xfig, but not a combination of the two.

PostScript   295         The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    21.2.3 Arranging a PostScript Document in a Booklet  To arrange the pages in a PostScript file to make booklets, rearrange the file in a signature with psbook, use psnup to arrange the pages−−two to a printed page in landscape mode−−and then use pstops to output first the odd and then the even pages.  The trick to doing this properly is to first determine exactly what you need to do and then calculate the proper measurements for use with pstops.    To make a booklet from the file `newsletter.ps':  1. Rearrange the pages into a signature:              $ psbook newsletter.ps newsletter.signature.ps RET  2. Put the pages two to a page in landscape orientation, at 70 percent of their original size   typed all on one line :  $ psnup −l −pletter −2 −s.7 newsletter.signature.ps 62; newsletter.2up.ps RET   3. Output the odd pages:  4. Output the even pages:  $ pstops "2:0 1in,0in " newsletter.2up.ps 62; odd.ps RET  $ pstops "2:−1 1in,0in " newsletter.2up.ps 62; even.ps RET  Then, to print the booklet, you send `odd.ps' to the printer, load the printed pages in the manual feed tray and then send `even.ps' to the printer. This prints the odd and even pages on opposite sides of the sheets.    To make a double−sized booklet on letter−sized paper in landscape orientation, from a file using letter−sized portrait orientation, type:     $ psbook input.ps 62; temp1.ps RET ...processing messages... $ psnup −l −pletter −2 −s.7 temp1.ps 62; temp2.ps RET ...processing messages... $ pstops "2:0 1in,0in " temp2.ps 62; odd.ps RET ...processing messages... $ pstops "2:−1 1in,0in " test2.ps 62; even.ps RET   21.

Sound Files  @sf{Debian}: `alsa−base' @sf{WWW}: http:  www.alsa−project.org   This chapter covers the basic control of audio on Linux−based systems, including how to adjust the audio mixer and how to play and record sound files using basic tools. You can also play and record audio with snd  see section Editing Sound Files  and many other sound applications.  In order to have sound working on your system, you need to have a sound driver installed and configured for your sound card. There are two free sound drivers that are popularly used on Linux−based systems. The standard Open Sound System driver  "OSS Free"  by 4Front Technologies is currently part of the Linux kernel and is what comes as default with most Linux distributions. The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture  "ALSA"  is another free driver that is becoming popular with musicians who use Linux.  NOTE: Most systems come configured so that you must be the superuser to be able to use sound devices, including audio CDs. If this is the case on your system, ask your administrator to give you access to these devices, typically by adding you to the audio group  see section Groups and How to Work in Them .  22.1 Sound File Formats 22.2 Adjusting the Audio Controls 22.3 Playing a Sound File 22.4 Recording a Sound File 22.5 Other Sound File Tools  Sound file formats.

You must use a mixer to adjust your audio settings before you play or record sound.  ALSA's default mixer is called amixer, and the following recipes assume its use. There are other mixers, and some of them are easier to use than amixer. If you want a graphical mixer, install the aumix package, or see the end of this chapter for others.  22.2.1 Listing the Current Audio Settings 22.2.2 Changing the Volume Level 22.2.3 Muting an Audio Device 22.2.4 Selecting an Audio Recording Source     Listing the current audio settings.

Your sound card's components are organized in groups, from the Master group containing the master left and right volume settings to the individual groups for audio compact discs and digital sound files.  These groups have nothing to do with the file access groups described in Groups and How to Work in Them.    22.

Before you can record something, you must unmute the input device you want to record from. Remember to also mute the microphone after you have finished recording, to avoid feedback when you turn up your speakers.    To unmute the microphone and turn it on for recording, type:  $ amixer set MIC unmute capture RET    To mute the microphone, type:  $ amixer set MIC mute RET    To unmute the master volume and set it to 80 percent volume, type:  $ amixer set Master 80% unmute RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   22.2.4 Selecting an Audio Recording Source  To select a device for recording, use set followed by the name of the device and the `capture' argument, which designates the specified group as the one to capture sound from for recording.

To play the file `pentastar.aiff', type:  $ play pentastar.aiff RET  NOTE: Before you begin playing sound, make sure you've set the master and PCM volume levels with the mixer  see section Adjusting the Audio Controls . The most common reason for no sound being produced when you try to play sound is not having the volume turned up!  ALSA comes with aplay, a tool for playing sound files that is similar to play, but does not recognize as many formats.  22.3.1 Playing an MP3 File       22.3.2 Playing a MIDI File  Playing MP3 files.

The default is 0  no buffer ; if you need this option, use a size of at least 1024KB  which is 1MB , or about six seconds of MP3 audio.  You can also use mpg321 to play "streaming" MP3 audio from the Web; just give the URL of the MP3 stream as an argument.    To play the MP3 stream at http:  example.net broadcast live.mp3, type:  $ mpg321 http:  example.net broadcast live.mp3 RET    To play the MP3 stream at http:  example.net broadcast live.mp3 with a 2MB audio buffer, type:  $ mpg213 −b 2048 http:  example.net broadcast live.mp3 RET  NOTE: The mpg321 tool is a free software replacement of mpg123, another command−line MP3 player that is not free software.

Sound Files   305   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ playmidi copa−cabana.mid RET  If you have a non−MIDI sound card, you can still play MIDI files by giving the `−f' option, which sends the MIDI output to the FM synthesizer on the sound card, which in turn plays it using FM patches that come with the playmidi distribution.    To play the MIDI file `copa−cabana.mid' on a non−MIDI sound card, type:  $ playmidi −f copa−cabana.mid RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   22.4 Recording a Sound File  @sf{Debian}: `sox' @sf{WWW}: http:  home.sprynet.com ~cbagwell sox.html  To record sound, first select an input device as a source for recording. Sound cards may have MIC and LINE IN jacks, as well as connections to the CD−ROM drive, all of which are sound inputs that can be recording sources. When you select a device for capture, your recording will come from this source.  Recording occurs from the currently active input, if any, which must be set with the mixer; unmute it and set its volume level before you begin recording.  Be sure to turn the volume on your speakers all the way off, or you'll get feedback.   To record audio to a file, use the rec tool. It can write many audio file formats, either to a format you specify with the `−t' option, or by determining the format to use based on the file name extension you give the output file  see section Sound File Formats . Type C−c to stop recording.  Give the name of the sound file to record as an argument; if a `.wav' file is specified, it records a simple monaural, low−fidelity sound sample by default.    To record a simple WAV sample from the microphone and save it to a file called `hello.wav', type:  $ rec hello.wav RET  This command begins an 8,000 Hz, monaural 8−bit WAV recording to the file `hello.wav', and keeps recording until you interrupt it with C−c. While the default is to make a low−fidelity recording−−8,000 Hz, monaural 8−bit samples−−you can specify that a high−fidelity recording be made.  But remember that high−fidelity recordings take up much more disk space.   To make a stereo recording, use the `−c' option to specify the number of channels, giving 2 as the   22. Sound Files   306         The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   argument. To make a 16−bit recording, give `w'  "wide"  as the argument to the `−s'  "sample size"  option.  Set the recording sample rate by giving the samples per second to use as an argument to the `−r' option. For CD−quality audio at 44,100Hz, use `−r 44100'.  Finally, to record a file in a particular format, either give the name of the format as an argument to the `−f' option, or use the traditional file name extension for that format in the output file name  see section Sound File Formats .    To make a high−fidelity recording from the microphone and save it to a WAV−format file called `goodbye.wav', type:  $ rec −s w −c 2 −r 44100 goodbye.wav RET    To make a sound recording in the CD audio format, and write the output to a file called `goodbye.cdr', type:        $ rec goodbye.cdr RET  NOTE: When you're not recording sound, keep the inputs muted  see section Muting an Audio Device ; this way, you can have a microphone plugged in without having feedback when playing sounds. Also, make sure the volume levels are not set too high or too low when recording; getting the right level for your microphone or other input device may take some initial adjustment.  Like play, rec is part of the sox toolkit.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   22.5 Other Sound File Tools  There are many mixer, playback, and recording tools available.

Both can retrieve single tracks or entire disks; the former is the archetypal CD audio−sampling tool for Linux, and should be used when speed is more important than sound quality. The latter does various extra checks for the paranoid, and should be used when an absolutely perfect copy is necessary−−at the expense of speed. cdda2wav is perfectly capable of creating a digitally perfect audio sample; cdparanoia is useful for when your original CD may have scratches  its scratch detection capability can attempt to "hold sync" across the scratch , or for when you are using a less−than−optimal−quality CD−ROM drive.  With cdda2wav, you specify the track number to be retrieved as an argument to the `−t' option; use `x' to specify a CD−quality retrieval, and give the name of the CD−ROM device with the `−D' option−−unless you have multiple CD−ROM drives installed, this is almost certainly going to be ` dev cdrom'.  By default, files are written as WAV format files; use the `−O' option followed by `cdr' to write the files in CD audio format. `.cdr' files are useful for burning an audio CD containing the files as tracks  discussed in the following section , and `.wav' files are useful for converting to MP3 format  see section Making an MP3 File . You can convert either format to the other at a later time with sox−−−see Converting Sound Files.    To copy track seven of an audio CD to a CD−quality WAV file in the current directory, type:   23.

Give the range of audio tracks to sample as an argument  with no arguments, it samples the entire disc . Use the `−w' option to specify WAV format output.    To sample the third track from a scratched audio CD in the default CD−ROM drive using "paranoid" data verification, and write the output to a WAV format file in the current directory, type:  $ cdparanoia −w 3−3 RET    To sample the entire audio CD using "paranoid" data verification, type:  $ cdparanoia −w −B RET    To sample the entire audio CD using less−than−maximum "paranoid" data verification, without checking for scratches, and saving each song as a separate raw audio−format file in the current directory, type:  $ cdparanoia −B −Y −X RET  NOTE: Sampling an entire audio CD can use a lot of disk space; most people delete the `.cdr' or `.wav' files as soon as they make MP3s or burn an audio CD−R from the data.

You will need a CD−R drive 31  and the audio files must be in CD−DA CD audio format  they usually have a `.cdda' or `.cdr' file name extension .  Specify the CD−R drive with the special `dev' argument, which is given in this form:     `dev=scsibus,target,lun'   23. Audio Compact Discs   314   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   where scsibus is the number of the SCSI bus  0 for the primary bus , target is the SCSI target ID  usually a number from 1 to 6 , and lun is its LUN number  most always 0 .  Use the `speed' argument to set the speed factor for writing data: give `speed=2' to specify double speed or `speed=4' to specify quad speed.  Use the `−dummy' option to run with the drive laser turned off, so no actual burning takes place; this is useful when you are first using a CD−R drive and need to test your configuration to make sure you've got it right. Another useful option is `−v', which gives a more verbose message output.  Give the names of the audio files to burn, in the order that they should appear on the disc, as arguments to the `−audio' option. The files are written in CD−DA CD audio format, and they should contain 16−bit stereo at 44,100 samples second  the `.cdr' or `.cdda' files meet this criterion .    To burn the file `symphony.cdr' to the disc in the CD−R drive whose target ID is 2 on the primary SCSI bus, type:  $ cdrecord dev=0,2,0 −audio symphony.cdr RET    To burn all the files in the current directory ending with a `.cdr' extension at double speed to the CD−R drive whose target ID is 2 on the primary SCSI bus, and give verbose output, type:  $ cdrecord dev=0,2,0 speed=2 −v −audio *.cdr RET    To run a test burn of the file `symphony.cdr' to the disc in the CD−R drive whose target ID is 6  LUN 1  on the primary SCSI bus, type:           $ cdrecord dev=0,6,1 −dummy −audio symphony.cdr RET  When you use wildcards for files, as in the second−to−the−last example, the shell expands the files in alphabetical order. To write a group of tracks in a particular order without specifying all of their names as arguments, rename them so that their names begin with numbers that correspond to the order you want to write them in  see section Moving Files and Directories .  For example, if you have the three files `morning−song.cdr', `midday−song.cdr', and `evening−song.cdr', and you want to write them in that order, rename the files to `01−morning−song.cdr', `02−midday−song.cdr', and `03−evening−song.cdr'; otherwise, if you specify them as `*.cdr', the shell will sort their names so that they will be written to CD−R in the order of `evening−song.cdr', `midday−song.cdr', and `morning−song.cdr'−−−exactly the opposite of what was intended!  To write a disc containing both data and audio tracks, first specify the file for the data track  it should contain a filesystem image in either ISO 9660 or Rock Ridge format , and then follow it with the `−audio' option and the names of the audio tracks to use. The resulting CD−R will be both mountable as a data CD and playable on audio CD players  the first track on the disc, the data track, will be skipped when playing the audio .   23. Audio Compact Discs   315   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To burn the data track `band−info' and all the audio tracks in the current directory with a `.cdda' extension to the CD−R drive whose target ID is 2 on the primary SCSI bus, type:     $ cdrecord dev=0,2,0 band−info −audio *.cdda RET  NOTE: When writing an audio CD, you should have as few processes running as possible. If cdrecord has to pause even momentarily to let the system shuffle other processes, the CD−R could be ruined! For this reason, it is advisable to avoid switching between consoles−−or between windows, if running X−−during the CD−R burning process.

And it uses Emacs−style key bindings.   You'll find a complete manual for it in the ` usr doc snd' directory; this section explains how to use Snd to work with selections from sound files.  To open a sound file in Snd, give the name of the file to be opened as an argument to snd.    To open the sound file `mixdown.wav' in Snd, type:     $ snd mixdown.wav RET  This command starts Snd with a WAV file called `mixdown.wav':   24. Editing Sound Files   317   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Making a selection of a sound file in snd is similar to selecting text in Emacs; you can mark a section of a sound file or recording you've made in Snd by left−clicking and dragging across the area with the mouse. The area you drag across becomes shaded and is called the selection. Once you select a portion of the sound, any effect you choose works on that selection. You can also cut and paste selections of the sound you are editing into other sound buffers.

It reads sound as files or standard input and outputs the sound either to a file or standard output, while translating in between. You can use sox to convert sound files between formats or process sounds with special effects. This section describes some of the special effects you can apply to sound files with sox.  When applying an effect, the original file is never altered. You must specify an output file, or use `−' to indicate the standard output, specifying the output format with `−t'. You can only apply one effect with each sox command; thus, to add both echo and reverb to a sound file, you would need to issue two sox commands.  The amount and levels applied for each effect will vary with every situation. As such, consider the following recipes guidelines only for using the options; you will probably end up experimenting a bit to get your intended effect for any particular sound file.  Almost all of the sound effects are applied by specifying the input and output file arguments, followed by the name of the effect to use and any options the effect takes  with notable exceptions, like the `−v' option for changing the amplitude of a file .  NOTE: For more information on the effects Sox can do, see the various files in ` usr doc sox ', and read the soxman page  see section Reading a Page from the System Manual .  24.2.1 Changing the Amplitude of a Sound File    Changing the amplitude of a sound file. 24.2.2 Changing the Sampling Rate of a Sound File 24.2.3 Adding Reverb to a Sound File 24.2.4 Adding Echo to a Sound File 24.2.5 Adding Flange to a Sound File     Adding reverb to a sound file.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   24.2.1 Changing the Amplitude of a Sound File  To change the volume or amplitude of a sound file, use sox with the `−v' option, giving the volume level as an argument. Levels below 1.0 lower the amplitude, and higher numbers raise it.    To raise the volume of file `old.wav' twofold and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox −v3 old.wav new.wav RET    To lower the volume of file `old.wav' by half and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox −v.5 old.wav new.wav RET  Use sox with the `stat' option and `−v' to determine the largest possible value that can be used before distortion or clipping occurs  it performs a statistical analysis on the file and outputs a numeric value . This value comes in handy when you want to raise a file's volume as high as possible without ruining its fidelity.    To raise the volume of the file `quit.cdr' as high as possible without distortion, type:           $ sox quiet.cdr loud.cdr stat −v RET 3.125 $ sox −v 3.125 quiet.cdr loud.cdr RET $  The preceding example writes a new file, `loud.cdr'.

Editing Sound Files   320            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    24.2.2 Changing the Sampling Rate of a Sound File  To change the sampling rate of a sound file, use the `−r' option followed by the sample rate to use, in Hertz. Like the `−v' option, specify this option before giving the name of the output file.    To change the sampling rate of file `old.wav' to 7,000 Hz, and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav −r 7000 new.wav RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   24.2.3 Adding Reverb to a Sound File  To add reverb to a sound file, use the `reverb' effect. `reverb' takes three arguments: the volume of the output  its "gain−out" , the time  in milliseconds  of reverb, and the length  in milliseconds  of delay. You can specify more than one delay; the more you specify, the more of an overlapping echo the reverb will have.    To add a basic reverb to file `old.wav' and write the output to file `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav .5 1000 100 RET    To add a spacey, echoing reverb to file `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav reverb 1 1000 333 333 333 333 RET  NOTE: This last example makes a sound similar to some of the recordings of the band Flying Saucer Attack.

It takes as arguments the "gain−in" and "gain−out" volume levels, as well as the delay and decay, both in milliseconds.   24. Editing Sound Files   321   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To add a 100 millisecond echo to the sound file `old.wav' and write output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav echo .5 .5 100 .5 RET    To add a one−second echo to the sound file `old.wav' and write output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav echo .5 .5 1000 .5 RET    To add a "tin−can" echo effect to `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav echo 1 .5 5 .5 RET  NOTE: The `echos' effect works like `echo', but adds a sequence of echos to the sound file.

It takes as arguments the "gain−in" and "gain−out" volume levels, as well as the delay and decay in milliseconds, and the speed of the flange, in Hertz. Specify the type of modulation with either `−s'  for sinodial  or `−t'  for triangular .    To add an "underwater" flange to the file `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav flanger .5 .5 4 .5 1 −t RET    To add flange that sounds somewhat like a "wah−wah" effects pedal to the file `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav flanger .5 .5 .5 1 2 −t RET                 [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   24.2.6 Adding Phase to a Sound File  The `phaser' effect adds phase to a sound file. It takes the same arguments as the `flanger' effect.    To add a heavy phase to the file `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:   24. Editing Sound Files   322   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ sox old.wav new.wav phaser 1 .5 4 .5 1 −s RET    To add a phased "breathing" effect to the file `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav phaser .5 .5 .5 .9 .5 −t RET  NOTE: Using a decay greater than .5 may result in feedback.

Its options are the "gain−in" and "gain−out" of the volume, the delay and decay in milliseconds, the speed in Hertz, and the depth of the chorus in milliseconds. Specify either `−s' or `−t' for sinodial or triangular modulation.    To add a 100 millisecond chorus to the file `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav chorus 1 .5 100 1 1 1 −t RET    To add a deep, "alien−sounding" chorus to the file `old.wav' and write the output to `new.wav', type:  $ sox old.wav new.wav chorus 1 .5 100 1 5 9 −t RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   24.2.8 Adding Vibro−Champ Effects to a Sound File  The `vibro' effect imitates the effect of the Fender Vibro−Champ amplifier.

Give as arguments the name of the input file and the name of the output file to write to; use a file name extension specifying the sound format for the output file  see section Sound File Formats .    To convert the file `new.wav' to an audio CD format file, type:  $ sox new.wav new.cdr RET  This command writes a new file, `new.cdr', in the audio CD format; the original file, `new.wav', is not altered.  You may sometimes need to specify additional options, such as with raw audio files where the sampling rate and other properties must be specified.    To convert all of the raw audio files in the current directory to audio CD format files, type:   24.

This is not so much a recording process as it is a conversion process: existing audio is converted to an MP3 file.  To make MP3 files from your own recordings, make the recording as a CD−quality WAV file, and then convert that.   Unfortunately, the algorithm for encoding MP3 is patented, and all software which uses it must pay a license fee−−including free software. This restriction makes it difficult for people to create a free software MP3 encoder, and it is the reason why some free software and open source groups advocate the development of a high−quality compressed audio format to replace MP3. 32  A workaround is presented in the form of LAME  "LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder" . LAME isn't an MP3 encoder, but it is a free software patch file  see section Patching a File with a Difference Report  designed to work with the sample source code distributed by the patent holders of the MP3 encoding process.  This means that you can download both separately and combine them to get a working MP3 encoder called notlame, perhaps the fastest  yes, encoding MP3s is a slow process  encoder currently available for Linux. When you visit the LAME Project at http:  www.sulaco.org mp3 , you'll find a link to download a pre−assembled notlame binary from a site in Australia, where the patent laws do not apply.   24. Editing Sound Files   325   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   The notlame encoder takes two arguments: the name of the input file and the name of the output file.    To encode an MP3 file from a WAV file called `september−wind.wav', type:  $ notlame september−wind.wav september−wind.mp3 RET  It usually takes some time to encode an MP3 file; when notlame is encoding a file, it continually outputs the current percentage of completion.  NOTE: Scripts on the download site show how to encode multiple WAV files and how to decode all of the tracks on an audio CD.

Disk Storage  All files and directories on a Linux−based system are stored on a Linux filesystem, which is a disk device  such as a hard drive  that is formatted to store a directory tree  see section Files and Directories .  There are two kinds of disk storage on a Linux system: fixed and removable. Fixed storage refers to a disk that is firmly attached to the computer system, and is not intended for casual removal  except when upgrading . Your hard drive  sometimes called "hard disk" , used to store the operating system, application software, and user data, is the prime example of a fixed disk.  The second kind of disk storage is removable storage, disks that are intended to be removed for archiving or transfer to another system. Common examples of removable storage are floppy disk  or "diskette"  and CD−ROM drives, where you typically remove the storage media from its drive bay when you're done using it.  On Linux systems, disks are used by mounting them to a directory, which makes the directory tree the disk contains available at that given directory mount point. Disks can be mounted on any directory on the system, but any divisions between disks are transparent−−so a system which has, aside from the root filesystem disk mounted on ` ', separate physical hard disks for the ` home', ` usr', and ` usr local' directory trees will look and feel no different from the system that only has one physical disk.  System administrators often mount high−capacity drives on directory trees that will contain a lot of data  such as a ` home' directory tree on a system with a lot of users , and for purposes of fault tolerance, administrators often use several physical hard disks on one system−−if there is a disk failure, only the data in that disk is lost.  This chapter describes tools and techniques for manipulating disks and storage media.  25.1 Listing a Disk's Free Space 25.2 Listing a File's Disk Usage 25.3 Floppy Disks 25.4 CD−ROMs     Listing free disk space.

Without any options, df outputs a list of all mounted filesystems. Six columns are output, displaying information about each disk: the name of its device file in ` dev'; the number of 1024−byte blocks the system uses; the number of blocks in use; the number of blocks available; the percent of the device used; and the name of the directory tree the device is mounted on.   25. Disk Storage   329   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To see how much free space is left on the system's disks, type:  $ df RET Filesystem         1024−blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on  dev hda1             195167   43405   141684     23%      dev hda2            2783807  688916  1950949     26%    usr  dev hdb1            2039559 1675652   258472     87%    home webb $  This example shows that three filesystems are mounted on the system−−the filesystem mounted on ` ' is at 23 percent capacity, the filesystem mounted on ` usr' is at 26 percent capacity, and the filesystem mounted on ` home webb', a home directory, is at 87 percent capacity.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   25.2 Listing a File's Disk Usage  Use du to list the amount of space on disk used by files. To specify a particular file name or directory tree, give it as an argument. With no arguments, du works on the current directory.  It outputs a line for each subdirectory in the tree, listing the space used and the subdirectory name; the last line lists the total amount of space used for the entire directory tree.    To output the disk usage for the directory tree whose root is the current directory, type:  $ du RET 8       . projects documentation 12      . projects source 4       . projects etc 24      . projects 3       . tmp 27      . $  This example shows two subdirectories in the directory tree: `projects' and `tmp'; `projects' contains three additional directories. The amount of disk space used by the individual directories is the total on the last line, 27K.  By default, output is in 1K blocks, but you can specify another unit to use as an option: `−k' for kilobytes and `−m' for megabytes.    To output the disk usage, in kilobytes, of the ` usr local' directory tree, type:  $ du −k  usr local RET   25. Disk Storage   330            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To show the number of megabytes used by the file ` tmp cache', type:  $ du −m  tmp cache RET  Use the `−s' option  "summarize"  to output only the last line containing the total for the entire directory tree. This is useful when you are only interested in the total disk usage of a directory tree.    To output only the total disk usage of the ` usr local' directory tree, type:    To output only the total disk usage, in kilobytes, of the ` usr local' directory tree, type:  $ du −s  usr local RET  $ du −s −k  usr local RET           [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   25.3 Floppy Disks  Before you can use a floppy disk for the first time, it must be formatted, which creates an empty filesystem on the disk.  To read or write files to a formatted disk, you mount the floppy on an empty directory, making its filesystem available in the specified directory. Usually, Linux systems have an empty ` floppy' directory for this purpose.  Another general−purpose directory for mounting filesystems is the ` mnt' directory.   NOTE: While you cannot mount a filesystem on a directory containing other files, you can always create a new directory somewhere to mount a filesystem.  When you mount a disk on a directory, that directory contains all the files and directories of the disk's filesystem; when you later unmount the disk, that directory will be empty−−all the files and directories on the disk are still on the disk's filesystem, but the filesystem is no longer mounted.  When you're done using a floppy, you must unmount it first before you remove it from the drive. If you don't, you risk corrupting or deleting some of the files on it−−Linux may still be using the mounted files when you remove the disk  see section Turning Off the System .  The following sections show you how to format, mount, and unmount floppies. On many systems, you need superuser privileges to do any one of these actions.  NOTE: For recipes describing use of MS−DOS  and Microsoft Windows  formatted disks under Linux, see Using DOS and Windows Disks.   25.

Give the name of the device file of the floppy drive as an argument−−usually the first removable disk drive, ` dev fd0'. The floppy must be in the drive when you give the format command, and any data already on it will be lost.

To mount the floppy in the first floppy drive to `~ tmp', type:  $ mount  dev fd0 ~ tmp RET  Once you have mounted a floppy, its contents appear in the directory you specify, and you can use any file command on them.   25. Disk Storage   332            The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To list the contents of the base directory of the floppy mounted on ` floppy', type:    To list the contents of the entire directory tree on the floppy mounted on ` floppy', type:  $ ls  floppy RET  $ ls −lR  floppy RET  NOTE: You can copy files to and from the directory tree that the floppy is mounted on, make and remove directories, and do anything else you could on any other directory tree. But remember, before you remove it, you must first unmount it.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   25.3.3 Unmounting a Floppy Disk  Use umount to unmount a floppy disk, using the name of the directory it is mounted on as an argument.    To umount the floppy that is mounted on ` floppy', type:  $ umount  floppy RET  NOTE: You can't unmount a disk if your current working directory, the directory you are in, is somewhere in that disk's directory tree. 34  In this case, trying to unmount the disk will give the error that the ` floppy' filesystem is in use; change to a different directory that isn't in the ` floppy' directory tree, and then you can unmount the disk.  Sometimes when you unmount a floppy, the light on the floppy drive will go on and remain on for a few seconds after it has been unmounted. This is because Linux sometimes keeps changes to files in memory before it writes them to disk; it's making sure that the files on the floppy are up−to−date. Simply wait until the light goes off before you remove the floppy from the drive.

You then unmount it from the directory before you can eject the CD from the CD−ROM drive  you can also eject the disc using software−−−see section Ejecting an Audio CD .   25. Disk Storage   333   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: To use audio CDs, see Audio Compact Discs.  25.4.1 Mounting a CD−ROM    25.4.2 Unmounting a CD−ROM     [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   25.4.1 Mounting a CD−ROM  To mount a CD−ROM on the system, use mount with the ` cdrom' option. 35     To mount a CD−ROM on the system, type:  $ mount  cdrom RET        This command makes the contents of the CD−ROM available from the ` cdrom' directory tree. You can use any Linux file command on the files and directories on a CD−ROM, but you can't write to a CD−ROM−−the CD−ROM format is read−only, so you can read the disc but not write to it.  Like the ` floppy' directory, the use of the ` cdrom' directory is a standard practice and convenient, but not necessary−−you can mount disks in whatever empty directory you like.  You could even, for example, mount discs from the CD−ROM drive to ` floppy' and mount floppy disks to ` cdrom', but why would anyone do that!   To mount a CD−ROM to a specific directory, use mount and give as arguments the name of the device file in ` dev' corresponding to the CD−ROM drive, and the name of the directory to mount to. This directory must already exist on the filesystem, and must be empty. If it doesn't exist, use mkdir to create it first  see section Making a Directory .  Most Linux systems are set up so that the device file of the first CD−ROM drive is ` dev cdrom', but the name of the device file may be different, especially if you have a SCSI CD−ROM drive.    To mount the disc in the CD−ROM drive to the ` usr local share clipart' directory, type:  $ mount  dev cdrom  usr local share clipart RET  The contents of the disc in the CD−ROM drive will then be available in the ` usr local share clipart' directory tree, and you can then use the files and directories on the CD−ROM as you would any other files. For example:   25.

To unmount the disc in the CD−ROM drive mounted on ` cdrom', type:  $ umount  cdrom RET  NOTE: As with unmounting any kind of filesystem, make sure that none of the files on the disc are in use, or you won't be able to unmount it. For example, if the current working directory in a shell is somewhere inside the ` cdrom' directory tree, you won't be able to unmount the CD−ROM until you change to a different directory.

Printing  @sf{Debian}: `magicfilter'  The usual way to print on a Linux system is to send a print job to the printer with lpr, as described below in Sending a Print Job to the Printer.  But you don't always send a file straight to the printer−−sometimes you may want to add special things to it before you print it, such as headers or graphic trim. For example, you might want to split a text file into pages and add a header to the top of each page containing the file name and page number; all of this is described in Formatting Text.  Sometimes you may need to convert or otherwise prepare a file so that it can be printed on your particular printer, since not all print hardware can print the same kinds of file formats. Recipes in this chapter show how to do this, such as how to convert PostScript files so that they will print properly on a non−PostScript printer  see section Preparing Files for Printing .  This chapter also shows how to format PostScript files for printing. To convert plain text to PostScript and enhance it for printing, by adding fonts, graphic headers, and the like, see Converting Plain Text for Output.  And this chapter isn't in the files section, because you can print things that aren't in a file−−for example, you can pipe the output of another tool or series of tools to lpr, and it will spool that command output to the printer. This usage is actually very common.  NOTE: When a printer is properly configured on Linux, it is a pleasure to use, but a misconfigured printer can lead to all kinds of trouble−−including the dreaded "staircase effect," where a text file prints with each subsequent line of output offset to the right by the length of the previous line.  If print services haven't been configured yet on your system, I strongly recommend that the `magicfilter' package be installed; it includes filters for the automatic detection of file types−−when you print a file, it automatically converts it to the proper format for your printer.  Comprehensive details on the setup of printer resources can be found in both the Printing HOWTO and the Printing Usage HOWTO  see section Reading System Documentation and Help Files .  26.1 Making and Managing Print Jobs 26.2 More Recipes for Printing 26.3 Preparing Files for Printing  Sending a job to the printer.

Printing   336   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    26.1 Making and Managing Print Jobs  The traditional way to print on Linux−based systems is to send a print job for the file or data you want to print to the spool queue for the printer in question. The spool queue contains all of the print jobs sent to it by all users; these jobs are released in turn to the printer device as it becomes available. In this way, Linux can handle multiple print jobs going to the same printer at once.  The following recipes show how to make and manage print jobs. In practice, you will probably send print jobs all the time−−since this is the way most printing is done in Linux−−and use the tools for listing or cancelling print jobs rarely. But sometimes things do go wrong, and it helps to know what to do when that happens.  26.1.1 Sending a Print Job to the Printer 26.1.2 Printing Multiple Copies of a Job 26.1.3 Listing Your Print Jobs 26.1.4 Cancelling a Print Job  Sending a print job.

You can also pipe the output of a command to lpr.   lpr writes a copy of the specified file or text to the spool queue of the specified printer, to be sent to the printer when the printer becomes available.    To print the file `invoice', type:  $ lpr invoice RET             To type a message with banner and send it to the printer, type:  $ banner "Bon voyage!"  lpr RET    To print a verbose, recursive listing of the ` usr doc HOWTO' directory, type:  $ ls −lR  usr doc HOWTO  lpr RET   26. Printing   337   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   If you have more than one printer connected to your system, specify the printer to send to as an argument to the `−P' option.  Printers have names just as user accounts and hosts do, and it is the administrator's privilege to name them; the default printer is usually called lp, for "line printer."     To send the file `nightly−report' to the printer called bossomatic, type:  $ lpr −P bossomatic nightly−report RET  NOTE: The name of the lpr tool comes from "line printer," which was the kind of printer hardware in popular use back when this program was first developed.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   26.1.2 Printing Multiple Copies of a Job  To print more than one copy of a print job, give the number of copies to print as an argument to the `−' option of lpr.    To print a dozen copies of the file `nightly−report', type:  $ lpr −12 nightly−report RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   26.1.3 Listing Your Print Jobs  To list your print jobs, use lpq, the "line printer queue" tool. It outputs a list of all print jobs currently in the default printer's spool queue−−each on a line of its own−−giving its rank in the queue, the username who sent the job, the print job number, the file names in the job, and the size of the data to be printed, in bytes.    To view the spool queue for the default printer, type:  $ lpq RET lp is ready and printing Rank   Owner      Job  Files                            Total Size active groucho   83   cigar.ps                       1739030 bytes 1st    harpo     84   harp.ps                            499 bytes 2nd    chico     85   love.ps                          45576 bytes $            26. Printing   338   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   In this example, there are three jobs queued for the default printer−−one by user groucho, for the file `cigar.ps', one by user harpo, for the file `harp.ps', and one by user chico, who has printed a file called `love.ps'.  The job by user groucho is the active job; this is the job that is currently printing on the printer. The other jobs must wait until this file is finished printing, and then they print in rank order.  As with lpr, you can specify the name of a printer as an argument to the `−P' option.    To view the spool queue for the printer called bossomatic, type:  $ lpq −P bossomatic RET  To only list the jobs for a particular user, give the name of the user as an argument.    To list the print jobs for user harpo, type:  $ lpq harpo RET  NOTE: When there are no print jobs, lpq outputs the text `no entries'.

Give as an argument the number of the print job to remove.  To cancel all of your print jobs in the spool queue, use a hyphen instead of the number of a print job.    To cancel print job 83, type:  $ lprm 83 RET    To cancel all of your print jobs, type:  $ lprm − RET  NOTE: If you try to cancel an active job−−one that has already been spooled to the printer−−don't be alarmed if some pages still print; the printer probably has some of the job in its internal print buffer.

Not all applications have print controls, but some of them do−−including Emacs and LyX  see section LyX Document Processing . Their print commands essentially send the print job to the printer via lpr, after possibly formatting or otherwise preparing the data to print. If you are working in such an application and want to print your work, using the built−in print control can be easier than having to go to a shell to run lpr.  For example, to print the current document in the LyX document processing application, choose Print from the File menu; it creates the proper output for your printer and makes a print job containing this output  see section LyX Document Processing .  Some tools, such as dvips and enscript  see section Converting Plain Text for Output , are also configured to spool output to the printer.  You can view these print jobs in the spool queue and you can cancel them, just as you could any print job.     26.2.1 Printing in Emacs 26.2.2 Printing with Dvips    26.2.3 Printing the Contents of an Xterm Window     Printing with dvips.

Both commands print the hardcopy output separated into pages, and with headers at the top of each page, showing the file name and current page number.  To generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer, use the ps−print−buffer function, which is also available on the Print submenu. A related function, ps−print−region, prints a PostScript image of the region. These commands are useful for sending the text of a buffer to a PostScript printer.   26.

Normally, you can print plain text on any printer. However, most graphics or image files must be converted to PostScript or EPS  "Encapsulated PostScript" . Some applications−−such as TeX−−−produce DVI output; in this case, you convert that to PostScript for printing.  If you have a PostScript printer, you can print PostScript files directly to it. If not, you'll need to convert the PostScript output to a format your printer uses. Filter programs like `magicfilter' make the conversion easier by doing this work for you, but they're not a panacea, since your system may use one of a great many filters.

Newer versions of gs will have better support for newer printers, so make sure that you have a recent version installed if you have a new model printer.  gs takes the file to convert as an argument; give the device to write output for as an argument to the `−sDEVICE=' option, and give the name of the file to write to as an argument to the `−sOutputFile=' option.  Two additional options are commonly used: `−dSAFER', which prevents the accidental deleting or overwriting of files, and `−dNOPAUSE', which turns off the pause between pages.   26.

To convert the file `abstract.dvi' to PostScript, type:  $ dvips −o abstract.ps abstract.dvi RET  This command reads the DVI file `abstract.dvi' and writes a PostScript version of it to the file `abstract.ps'; the original file is not altered.  To write only certain pages of a DVI file to the PostScript output, give the page or pages as arguments to the `−pp' option.    To output only pages 14 and 36 from file `abstract.dvi' to a PostScript file, `abstract.ps', type:  $ dvips −pp14,36 −o abstract.ps abstract.dvi RET    To output pages 2 through 100 from file `abstract.dvi' to a PostScript file, `abstract.ps', type:  $ dvips −pp2−100 −o abstract.ps abstract.dvi RET               26.

You can then print this file with lpr or convert it to another format  see section Preparing a PostScript File for Printing .  The second way is to use pdf2ps, part of the `gs' package, to convert the PDF file to PostScript  then print the PostScript output as described for xpdf above . pdf2ps takes two arguments: the name of the PDF file to convert, and the name of the PostScript file to write to.

In Linux and other unices, text files have only the newline character.  In either of these operating systems, text files that originated from the other may display irregularly−−in DOS and Windows, the lines of a Linux text file may appear to run together; in Linux, a DOS or Windows text file may have `^M' newline characters at the end of each line.  To convert a text file from DOS to Linux, removing the `^M' newline characters in the file, use `fromdos'. It converts the file you give as an argument, removing the newline characters from the ends of all its lines.  To convert a text file from Linux to the convention used by DOS and Windows, use todos. It adds newline characters to the ends of all lines in the file you give as an argument.    To remove the newline characters from the text file `autoexec.bat', type:  $ fromdos autoexec.bat RET    To add newline characters to all of the text files with a `.tex' extension in the current directory, type:  $ todos *.tex RET  NOTE: Both commands directly write to the files you specify. To make a backup of the original file, use the `−b' option; before the conversion, this writes a copy of each specified file with a `.bak' file name extension.   27.

It can convert files to two different formats: LaTeX and plain text.  Convert to LaTeX when the layout of the original document, including its formatting and font characteristics, is important. When you just need the complete text of the document, convert it to plain text. word2x can send its output to the standard output, so the latter conversion is useful for adding to a pipeline.  Word files usually have a `.doc' or `.DOC' extension, which you don't have to specify−−for example, if the Word file you want to convert is called `resume.doc', you can simply give `resume' as the source file.  But if there exists another file named `resume' in the same directory, this trick won't work .  If you don't specify an output file, word2x writes its output to a file with the same base file name and an appropriate extension for the output format. This is useful for converting a lot of Word files in the same directory−−specifying a wildcard such as `*.doc' as the input and no output name will convert them all.  You can also set the maximum line width to be used in the output file; specify the width as an argument to the `−w' option.  The following recipes describe how to use word2x to convert Word files to LaTeX and plain text format.  NOTE: While word2x does a pretty good job of conversion, it won't convert any pictures embedded in Word documents.  Another way to read Word files is to import them into the AbiWord or StarWriter word processors  see section Other Word Processors and Typesetting Systems .  27.4.1 Converting Word to LaTeX 27.4.2 Converting Word to Plain Text        Converting Word to plain text.

To output the current system date and time, type:  $ date RET Fri May 11 11:10:29 EDT 2001 $        The default format of the output is to display the day of the week; the month name; the day of the month; the 24−hour time in hours, minutes, and seconds; the time zone; and the year.  Use the `−u' option to output the current date and time in Greenwich Mean Time  also known as Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC .    To output the current date and time in UTC, type:  $ date −u RET Fri May 11 15:10:29 UTC 2001 $   28. Reminders   356   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Use the `−R' option to output the date in the format described in RFC822  see section Word Lists and Reference Files : day of week followed by day of month, month name, year, time, and time zone in numeric format. This is the date format used in email messages.          To output the current date and time in RFC822 format, type:  $ date −R RET Fri, 11 May 2001 11:10:29 −0400 $  You can also use the `−d' option to specify the precise fields to output, and the order in which to output them. One useful example is given next; for more information, see the dateman page  see section Reading a Page from the System Manual .  To output the number of days into the year for a particular date, use `−d' with 'DD MMM' +%j, where `DD' is the day of month and `MMM' is the name of month.    To output the numeric day of the year that 21 June falls on in the current year, type:  $ date −d '21 Jun' +%j RET 172 $  This command outputs the number 172, which indicates that 21 June of the current year is the 172nd day of the current calendar year.  NOTE: To ensure that the time on your system clock remains as accurate as possible, your system administrator should install the `chrony' package; it periodically adjusts the time on the system clock according to measurements obtained from other servers on the Internet via "Network Time Protocol."

It reads a calendar file, which is a text file in the current directory containing a list of appointments and reminders; then it outputs those entries from the file that have today or tomorrow's date.  On a Friday, it outputs entries for that weekend and for the following Monday.   For example, if today is Friday, June 16, and you run calendar in the same directory as your calendar file, typical output might look like this:     $ calendar RET 6 16    Finish draft of book   28.

While the BSD derivate is available for Debian as part of the bsdmainutils package, this tool isn't yet standard on all Linux distributions.  The following are recipes for writing your calendar files, including other calendar files in your own calendar file, and for automating the delivery of your reminders.  NOTE: Emacs has its own equivalent to this tool, which it calls the "Diary." See Info file `emacs−e20.info', node `Diary' for more information on this feature.  28.4.1 Making an Appointment File 28.4.2 Including Holidays in Your Reminders 28.4.3 Automatic Appointment Delivery     Making an input calendar files.

[   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   28.4.1 Making an Appointment File  To begin using calendar, you need to make a "calendar file" where you can enter your appointments. It's just a plain text file, and can be called either `calendar' or `.calendar'; the latter makes it a "hidden" file, as described in Listing Hidden Files.  Write each appointment or calendar entry on a line by itself; blank lines in the file are ignored. The format of a calendar entry is as follows:  [date] [tab or spaces] [text of reminder itself]  Just about every common date style is recognized. For example, the following are all valid dates for the fourth of July:        7 4 July 4 4 July Jul. 4 Jul 4  Entries aren't constrained to a single day, either; you can have entries for a day of the week or for a certain   28. Reminders   361   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   month−−−`Mon' or `Monday' for every Monday; `Jun' or `June' for the first day of every June. You can use an asterisk as a wildcard: `* 13' reminds you of something on the thirteenth of every month. When the date is omitted on a line, the date of the preceding appointment is assumed.  For example, suppose you have a file called `calendar' in your home directory that looks like this:  6 16    Finish draft of book         Party at Jack's 6 20    Gallery reading Fri     Lunch with Kim and Jo, 12:30 Mon     Book manuscript due  If the current date is 16 June, a Friday, and you run calendar in your home directory, you'll get the same output as in the example in the previous section, Managing Appointments.  NOTE: In the example above, the entry for the party doesn't have a date on it−−it used the date of the preceding entry, `6 16'.

The prepared files are stored in ` usr share calendar'. The following table gives the name of each calendar file and describes its contents.  DESCRIPTION  CALENDAR FILE calendar.birthday Births and deaths of famous people. calendar.christian Christian holidays. calendar.computer Significant dates in the history of computing. calendar.history calendar.holiday calendar.judaic calendar.music calendar.usholiday U.S. holidays. calendar.hindu  Dates of U.S. historical events. Standard and obscure holidays. Jewish holidays. Dates related to music, mostly 1960s rock and roll.  Hindu holidays.  To have calendar output dates from one of these files along with your usual appointments, put the following in your calendar file, where file is the name of the particular calendar file you want to include:   28. Reminders   362                  The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   include 60;file62;  For example, to output both US holidays and famous births and deaths when you run calendar, put these lines somewhere in your calendar file:  include 60;calendar.usholiday62; include 60;calendar.birthday62;  NOTE: You can, of course, share your own calendar files with other users; this is useful for making special calendars for a group or organization. If the calendar file is in the current directory or ` usr share calendar', you can just give the file name; otherwise, give its full path name in the include statement.

Add calendar to your `.bashrc' file to output the day's appointments and reminders every time you log in or start a new shell  see section Customizing Future Shells .  If you keep your calendar file in a directory other than your home directory, make sure that calendar  the tool  is called from that directory. For example, if your calendar file is in your `~ doc etc' directory, you'd put the following line in your `.bashrc' file:  cd ~ doc etc; calendar; cd  To have the system send you the day's appointments in email, use crontab to schedule a daily cron job process which runs calendar and, if there is any output, mails it to you with mail.  To do this, add the following line to your `crontab' file  if you don't have one, just put this line in a text file called `crontab' somewhere in your home directory :  45 05 * * 1−5 calendar  mail −s 'Your Appointments' joe@example.org  The `45 05 * * 1−5' specifies that these commands be run at 5:45 a.m. on every weekday. The rest of the line is the series of actual commands that are run: the calendar tool is run on your personal calendar file, and if there is any output, it's mailed to joe@example.org  replace that with your actual email address, or with your username on your local system if you check mail there .  Add this new crontab entry to the cron schedule by running the crontab tool with the name of your `crontab' file as an argument.   28. Reminders   363   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To add the new entry in the file `crontab' to the cron schedule, type:     $ crontab crontab RET  NOTE: The name of the command, crontab, is the same as the file, `crontab'.

In the past, people often called the physical embodiment of these things a "rolodex," which incidentally was a brand name for the Cadillac of such contact managers, the circular Rolodex file that sat atop the desk of every successful 20th century businessman. I hear that many people use them even today; the following recipes show how it can be done in Linux with less desk space and faster search times.  28.5.1 Keeping a Free−Form Address List 28.5.2 Keeping a Contact Manager Database     A free−form address list.    A contact manager database in Emacs.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   28.5.1 Keeping a Free−Form Address List  The simplest way to keep names and addresses in Linux is to keep them in a text file as a free−form address list; to find an entry, use the search capabilities of tools like grep, less, and Emacs.  This method is useful for when you need to keep track of name and address information of many parties, and don't always keep the same kind of information for each−−maybe sometimes a name and phone number, sometimes just a mailing address, sometimes a name and email address. With a free−form address list, each entry contains whatever information you have in the format you want.  Separate the entries with a delimiter line of your preference. I happen to use `', but you can use whatever characters you're comfortable with−−just make it a combination that won't appear in the text for any of the entries themselves.  For example, suppose you have a text file, `rolo', containing three entries:     John Dos Passos 1919 America Ave.   28. Reminders   364   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   New York City      Scott F. − 602 555 1803  don't call after 12   T. Wolfe's new email has changed. The new one is: tw@example.com  Notice that each entry contains varied information, and is in no particular format. That's the benefit of a free−form list−−you don't have to type in the entries in any particular order, and you're not bound by a given set of "fields"; you can even cut and paste text into it from email, the Web, or other windows  see section Selecting Text .  There are several ways to find text in such a file. Suppose, for example, you want to contact your friend Scott, and you need his telephone number.    To output the line in the file containing the text `scott', regardless of case, type:  $ grep −i scott rolo RET Scott F. − 602 555 1803 $  This works nicely when the information you need is on the same line as the information you search for−−here, the name Scott is on the same line as the telephone number; however, the output did not show the warning that appears on the next line in the file. And what about when the term you search for and the information you need are on adjacent lines?  Use the `−C' option with grep to output several lines of context before and after matched lines.    To output the several lines around the line matching the text `olfe', type:        $ grep −C olfe rolo RET  T. Wolfe's new email has changed. The new one is: tw@example.com  $  Another way to search such a file is to open it as a buffer in Emacs and use any of the Emacs searches. The Emacs incremental−search function, C−s, is very useful for such files−−even for very large ones. If you do such a search on a large file, and the first result doesn't turn up the right record, just keep typing C−s until the right one appears. If you type the letters to search for in all lowercase, Emacs matches those letters regardless of case.    To search through the current buffer in Emacs for the first entry containing the text `New York',   28. Reminders   365   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   regardless of case, type:  C−s new york        C−s    To search for the next entry containing the text `New York', regardless of case, type:  You can repeat the second example as many times as you wish to show all entries in the entire buffer with the text `New York' in them. Once you reach the end of the buffer, type C−s again to loop around to the beginning of the buffer and continue the search from there.  The minibuffer will tell you when you've reached the end of the buffer, and will remind you to type this if you want to loop the search.   NOTE: It's also useful to peruse and search through these kind of files with less−−−see Searching Text in Less.

You can use it with Emacs email and news readers; it stores contact information in records, and allows you to search for records that match a regular expression, as well as records whose particular fields match a regular expression  see section Regular Expressions−−Matching Text Patterns .  There are several ways to add a record to the database. Use the bbdb−create function to manually add a record  when you run this command, bbdb prompts you to enter the relevant information for each field . When in a mail reader inside Emacs, type a colon  `:'  to display the record for the author of the current message; if there is none, bbdb asks whether or not one should be created.    To create a new bbdb record from scratch, type:  M−x bbdb−create RET    To add a new bbdb record for the author of the current email message, type:        :  Use the bbdb function to search for records−−it takes as an argument the pattern or regexp to search for.   28. Reminders   366         The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To output records containing the text `scott' anywhere in the record, type:  M−x bbdb RET scott RET  There are additional functions that let you narrow your search to a particular field: bbdb−name, bbdb−company , bbdb−net, and bbdb−notes, which respectively search the name, company, email address, and notes fields.    To output records matching the regexp `*\.edu' in the email address, type:  M−x bbdb−net RET *\.edu RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   28.6 Reminding Yourself of Things  Sometimes, it's useful to make a reminder for yourself that you'll see either later in your current login session, or the next time you log in.

To quickly send an email reminder, give your email address  or just your username on your local system, if you check mail there  as an argument to mail tool.

To remind yourself to leave at 8:05 p.m., type:     $ leave 2005 RET  When you run leave with no arguments, it prompts you to enter a time; if you just type RET then leave exits without setting the reminder. This method is good for adding leave to scripts or to your `.bashrc', so that you may interactively give a time to leave, if desired, when the script runs  see section Customizing Future Shells .

It takes as an argument a simple mathematical expression, and it outputs the answer.  Use `*' for a multiplication sign and ` ' for division; to output the remainder, use `%'. You can use parenthesis to group expressions−−but when you do, be sure to quote them  see section Passing Special Characters to Commands .   29.

Type bc to perform arithmetic operations interactively, just like you would with a calculator.  Type each statement to evaluate on a line by itself, typing RET at the end the statement; the evaluation of what you type is output on the following line. Each line you type will be evaluated by bc as an arithmetic expression. To exit, type quit on a line by itself.

To output the sequence of numbers from −1 to 14, incrementing by 3, type:  $ seq −1 3 14 RET  Use the `−w' option to pad numbers with leading zeros so that they're all output with the same width.  Specify a separator string to be output between numbers as an argument to the `−s' option; the default is a newline character, which outputs each number in the sequence on its own line.    To output the sequence of numbers from 9 to 999, incrementing by 23, with numbers padded with zeros so that they're all of equal width, type:    To output the sequence of numbers from 1 to 23, with a space character between each, type:  $ seq −w 9 23 999 RET  $ seq −s ' ' 1 23 RET  To pass a sequence of numbers as arguments to a command, pipe the output of seq using a space character as a separator.

Give two quoted arguments: the number and name of the units you have, and the name of the units to convert to. It outputs two values: the number of the second units you have, and how many of the second kind of unit can make up the quantity of the first that you've specified.    To output the number of ounces in 50 grams, type:     $ units '50 grams' 'ounces' RET         * 1.7636981           0.56699046 $  In this example, the output indicates that there are about 1.7636981 ounces in 50 grams, and that conversely, one ounce is about 0.56699046 times 50 grams.   29.

Digital Subscriber Line  DSL  service, cable modems, and dial−up connections with ISDN or analog modems are currently the most popular methods. Each of these services have their own hardware and software requirements.  For up−to−date, detailed instructions for using these services on Linux−based systems, the relevant HOWTOs published by the Linux Documentation Project remain the definitive guides  see section Reading System Documentation and Help Files :    ISP Hookup HOWTO, by Egil Kvaleberg  http:  www.linuxdoc.org HOWTO ISP−Hookup     DSL HOWTO for Linux, by David Fannin  http:  www.linuxdoc.org HOWTO DSL−HOWTO     Cable Modem Providers HOWTO, by Vladimir Vuksan  http:  www.linuxdoc.org HOWTO Cable−Modem   The following recipes show how to set up and use a PPP  "Point−to−Point Protocol"  dial−up connection, long the de facto means of connecting a computer to the Internet over a dial−up line.   30. Communications   379   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   30.1.1 Setting Up PPP 30.1.2 Controlling a PPP Connection    Controlling PPP connections.  Setting up PPP.      [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   30.1.1 Setting Up PPP  To configure PPP for a regular dial−up connection, where your system is assigned a dynamic IP address  the norm for home Internet access , you need to be root  the superuser  to edit the PPP configuration files, and you'll need the standard connection information from your ISP: the dial−up number to use, the IP addresses for their nameservers, and your username and password for accessing their system.  Use this information to customize the file ` etc chatscripts provider':  ABORT        BUSY ABORT        "NO CARRIER" ABORT        VOICE ABORT        "NO DIALTONE" ""           "\p\p+++\p\p" ""           "at" ""           "at" OK           "ath0" ""           atdt5551010,, ost          ppp ogin         smith word         \qsecret\q        In this example, after eight lines of modem initialization strings, the modem is instructed to dial the ISP dial−up number, `5551010'. Some systems need one or two commas after the number to signify pauses for the modem; only do this if you can't get a good connection with just the telephone number in this space.  Next is the "host" line: this is an optional line used by some ISPs whose connection line contains a choice of services from which you must make a selection before entering your username and password  some ISPs offer SLIP and shell access along with the standard PPP, for example ; customize this and the following lines as instructed by your ISP.  Finally, the username `smith' is given, and then the password of `secret'. The password appears between two `\q' strings, which−−for security purposes−−instruct ppp to display the question mark  `?'  characters instead of the actual password in system log files or other places where an intruder might see it.  Next, edit the file ` etc ppp peers provider' so that it contains these lines:  connect " usr sbin chat −v −f  etc chatscripts provider" defaultroute  dev modem 115200 persist  The last line in this file should include the device name of the modem you are using and the maximum   30. Communications   380   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   connect speed to try; the preceding example uses ` dev modem' as the device name of the modem, and 115,200 bps as the maximum connect speed, which is a good value for a typical 56K modem  a rule of thumb is to use the highest connect speed your modem supports; you can always go lower when a connection is made, but you can never raise the speed above what is given here .  Finally, edit the file ` etc resolv.conf' so that it contains the following, using the two nameserver IP addresses given to you by your ISP:     search . nameserver      nameserver address 1 nameserver      nameserver address 2  For the two nameserver address values, use the IP address of the nameserver machines, as given to you by your ISP. The second is optional−−most ISPs have more than one designated nameserver as a backup in the event that the first system becomes unavailable.  Make sure that your user account has membership to the dialout group; otherwise, you'll have to have the superuser account start and stop PPP, which is not recommended  see section Letting Users Access Hardware Peripherals .  Once you've done these things, you should be able to start and stop PPP connections to the Internet. Complete documentation for setting up PPP is in the ` usr share doc ppp' directory.

It calls the number of your ISP with your modem, sends the appropriate login information, and starts the PPP connection.    To start a PPP connection, type:     $ pon RET  Once you have a PPP connection, you can connect to other systems on the Internet via the WWW or other network services, as described in the following chapters.  To make PPP automatically start when the system first boots, rename the file ` etc ppp no_ppp_on_boot' to ` etc ppp ppp_on_boot'.  you must be root, the superuser, to do this.   To output the last few lines of the PPP log file, type plog. This is useful for checking the progress of your PPP connection when it first dials.   30. Communications   381   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Use the poff tool to stop a PPP session. It disconnects your computer from your ISP and hangs up the modem.

The following subsections show how to do this with the efax package, which is designed for single user systems or relatively simple fax configurations  more complicated tools for faxing exist, but they are beyond the scope of this book .  To set up efax for faxing, edit the file ` etc efax.rc'  you must be root to do this . The important things to specify in this file are the value for `DEV', which is the device name in ` dev' of the fax or modem device  this should almost always be `modem' , and the values for `FROM' and `NAME'−−−the fax number and organization name to appear on outgoing faxes.  NOTE: Unless you have membership to the dialout group, you must ask your system administrator for access to the modem hardware before you can use it  see section Letting Users Access Hardware Peripherals .

Communications   382   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    30.2.1 Sending a Fax  Use efax to send a fax. It dials the telephone number you give and faxes the contents of the file or files you specify. You can send plain text files or files in TIFF Group 3 format as they are. You can also send files in other formats, but you must convert them to `tiffg3' first−−see Converting to and from Fax Format.  Use the `−d' option to specify the full path name of the fax device  usually ` dev modem' if you are using the modem connected to your system  and the `−t' option followed by a telephone number to specify the number you are to send the fax to. To specify DTMF tone dialing, precede the phone number with a `T'; specify pauses in the dialing sequence with a comma  `,'  character−−this is useful for dialing out from a PBX or office phone system.    To fax a copy of the file `resume.txt' to the number `555−9099', using DTMF tone dialing, type:  $ efax −d  dev modem −t T555−9099 resume.txt RET  To send more than one file, specify them as arguments in the order they are to be sent. You can also specify them with a wildcard character, but be careful−−they are sent in the order in which the shell expands the file names, which is alphabetical order. If you have a lot of files that should be sent in a particular order, rename them so their file names begin with the number of the page they correspond to. But be sure to number them with the same number of digits for each file−−for example, if you have eleven files to fax, don't name them `1.fax', `2.fax', and so on, to `10.fax' and `11.fax', because the shell will expand them in the order of `1.fax', `10.fax', `11.fax', `2.fax', `3.fax', and so on up to `9.fax'. In this case, you would number them as `01.fax', `02.fax', and so on, so that files one through nine contain the same number of digits in their name as do `10.fax' and `11.fax'.    To fax all of the files with the `.fax' extension in the current directory to the number `555−9099', using DTMF tone dialing, type:  $ efax −d  dev modem −t T555−9099 *.fax RET  Another way to do this is to make a text file containing the list of files to fax, one file name per line, in the order you want them sent. If the files you want to send are not in the current directory, be sure to write the file names with path names relative to the current directory−−so for example, if you want to send the file `header.fax', which is in your home directory, and the current directory is `~ documents faxes', the file should be specified as `~ header.fax'.    To fax all of the files listed in the file `fax.list' to the number `555−9099', dialing `9' first to obtain an outside line, and using DTMF tone dialing, type:  $ efax −d  dev modem −t T9,555−9099 $ cat fax.list  RET  NOTE:efax doesn't delete the files it faxes.   30.

You may also have to use `−iSO=1' to send an `S0=1' command to the modem to set it to auto answer, and use `−kZ' to send an `ATZ' reset request to the modem after efax exits.  As with sending a fax, specify the full path name of the device file to use with the `−d' option.  By default, efax outputs a "session log" to the standard error, containing information on the status of the fax messages received; use redirection to redirect it to a file  see section Redirecting Error Messages to a File .    To set up efax to receive an incoming fax, saving the session log to a file, `faxlog', type:     $ efax −d  dev modem −kZ −w −iS0=1 262;38;1 62;62; faxlog RET  This command starts efax and sets up the modem to wait for an incoming fax. After a fax is received, efax exits. You can stop efax before it receives a fax by typing C−c or by killing the efax job  see section Stopping a Job .  When a fax is received, it is written to a file in the current directory whose base name consists of the current numeric date and a session number generated by efax; each page is written to a separate file whose three−digit file extension is the page number. The received fax files are in TIFF Group 3 fax format; use display to view them  see section Viewing an Image in X , or convert them to PostScript or another format for printing  see section Converting to and from Fax Format .

To set up your system so that you automatically receive all incoming fax messages continually, until you interrupt it, use `faxon', part of the tinyutils package. It starts efax for receiving an incoming fax, as explained previously, but after a fax is received, it starts efax again and continues until you interrupt it.    To automatically receive any incoming fax messages, type:     $ faxon RET   30.

A session log is written to the file `faxlog' in your home directory.  Should an incoming facsimile message arrive, efax will receive it and write the message in files in the current directory, with a file name convention as described previously; then efax restarts, ready to receive another fax.

You can, however, view `tiffg3' files with the GIMP, or with display−−−see section Viewing an Image in X .  Use efix to convert  or "fix"  files for faxing; it will convert a file you want to fax to the `tiffg3' format. You can also use it to convert received fax files to another format you can view or print. efax outputs to standard output, but you can redirect its output to a file to save it.  To convert a file for faxing, type efix followed by the name of the file to convert, and redirect standard output to the file you want to contain your fax image. efix can read plain text, PBM, and TIFF files.    To convert the file `chart.pbm' for faxing, type:  $ efix −i pbm chart.pbm 62; chart.fax RET        This command converts a copy of the file `chart.pbm' to the `tiffg3' fax format, writing it to a file called `chart.fax'. The original PBM file is not altered.  To convert a PostScript file to fax format, use gs and specify tiffg3 as the output device to write to−−see Preparing a PostScript File for Printing.    To convert the PostScript file `resume.ps' to fax format, type:  $ gs −q −sDEVICE=tiffg3 −dSAFER −dNOPAUSE −sOutputFile=resume.fax resume.ps 60;  dev null RET   This command  typed all on one line  writes a copy of the file `resume.ps' to the file `resume.fax' in `tiffg3' format, which you can then send as a fax. The original PostScript file is not   30. Communications   385   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   altered.  To convert a received fax file to a PostScript file that you can then preview  see section Previewing a PostScript File  or print  see section Sending a Print Job to the Printer , use the `−o ps' option.    To convert `19990325.001', a received fax file, to a PostScript file, type:     $ efix −o ps 19990325.001 62; received.ps RET  This command converts the fax file into a PostScript file called `received.ps'.

It's a serial communications tool for X or the console; it resembles some of the communications tools of the DOS world, such as Telix and Procomm.  When you start minicom, the connection screen looks like this:  The bottom line contains a status bar showing a message describing how to get help, the current modem settings  in this case, 57,600 bps, 8 data bits, no parity, one stop bit , whether or not cursor keys work  the mysterious `NOR' message , the version of the program  `1.82' , the kind of terminal emulation currently set  `VT102' , and whether or not an online connection is currently established. To get a help menu, type   30. Communications   386   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   C−a z; from this menu, you can press P to set the communications parameters, T to set the terminal settings, O to configure minicom, or D to enter the dialing directory.  To dial a number from the main screen, type ATDT followed by the number to dial.    To dial the number `368−2208', type:     ATDT3682208 RET  When you type RET, minicom will begin dialing the number; type any key to interrupt the dialing and hang up the line. Once connected, type C−a h to hang up the line and type C−a x to hang up the line and exit the program.  NOTE:minicom isn't really a way to connect your system to the Internet; to do that, you normally start a PPP connection, as described earlier in this chapter. 37   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   30. Communications   387    31. Email  The primary means of sending plain−text messages  or binaries in attachment files  between users across computer networks and systems on the Internet is called electronic mail, or email  and more often than not these days, just "mail" .  The number of email applications  called mail user agents, or MUAs  available for Linux is large, and you could spend endless hours exploring the details of all of them. Instead of guiding you toward this route, this chapter attempts to do three things: give a brief intro to using the default mail agent; give an overview of other well−supported mail agents, with pointers on where to go for more info; and show how you can use other tools on the system to manipulate your email.  The mail tool is the default mail agent on Debian and most other Linux systems. It comes without many bells and whistles that are standard with most MUAs, and any user who sends and receives email more than occasionally will certainly want to learn a more advanced system  see section Picking the Right Mail Application .  However, mail is available on almost all Unix−based systems, and it works in a pinch−−by learning to use it you can always send and receive email on any Linux− or Unix−based system you encounter.  NOTE: On some Unix−based systems, the name of the tool is mailx instead of mail.

To send an email message to lisa@example.com, type:      31. Email   388   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   $ mail lisa@example.com RET Subject: Hello RET Hi there, long time no talk! I'm just learning how to use RET  Linux and thought I'd show you how easy it is to send email! RET C−d Cc: RET  The text you type on the `Subject:' line is displayed as the subject of your email message, and the lines of text you type after that is the body text of the message. Type C−d on a line alone to end the message. Then, mail prompts for `Cc:' addresses; a "carbon copy" of the email message is sent to any addresses you give here, if any  just type RET for none, and separate multiple addresses with commas .  When you type, mail just reads the standard input like any other command−line tool, so there's little direct editing capability in this basic email service−−use C−u to erase the current line, and C−c C−c  that is, C−c pressed twice  to cancel your input and abort the message altogether.  That's it!

To send an email message to user mrs on your local system, type:     $ mail mrs RET Subject: are you going to the party tonight?

To do this, give the email addresses you want to send to as arguments to mail, and use the standard input redirection operators to redirect the text to use as the message body  see section Redirecting Input and Output .    To mail the contents of the text file `trades' to the email address terrapin@example.com, type:  $ mail terrapin@example.com 60; trades RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   31.1.3 Mailing the Contents of a URL  A variation on the previous recipe is to use mail and shell redirection to send the output of some command to some address via email. You can, for example, send the contents of a URL as an annotated text file by redirecting the output of the lynx Web browser  see section Reading Text from the Web .    To mail the text of the URL http:  etext.org  as annotated text to the email address droneon@example.com, type:  $ mail droneon@example.com 60; lynx −dump −number_links http:  etext.org  RET   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]         31.

KEYSTROKE DESCRIPTION C−c C−c . RETorC−d On a blank line, either of these commands sends the message and then exits mail. C−u  Erase the current line and move the cursor to the beginning of the line.  Abort the current message and exit mail.

The following table lists some of these commands and describes their functions.  COMMAND DESCRIPTION ~!command Run command in a shell. ~baddress ~d ~e  Send a blind carbon copy to the usernames or email addresses given. Copy the file `dead.letter' from your home directory into the message. Edit the message in the default text editor program.  When you exit the text editor, you are returned to mail.  Insert copies of the specified received messages into the message body. Messages are specified by number or a range  for example, `2−4' inserts messages two through four inclusive ; if no number is given, the current received message is inserted. Same as `~f', but reads in the messages with full headers. Insert a copy of the file file into the message. Write a copy of the body text into the file file.  ~fnumber  ~F ~rfile ~wfile  These commands should each be typed on a line by itself.

Email   391   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    31.2 Receiving Mail  On Linux−based systems, the INBOX is a text file on the system where your incoming mail is written to. Its location is always given by $MAIL, a special shell variable  see section Changing the Shell Prompt .    To output the location of your INBOX, type:     $ echo $MAIL RET  Usually, the INBOX location is in the ` var spool mail' directory, and has the same name as your username−−so if your username is mrs, your INBOX is likely ` var spool mail mrs'.  You shouldn't directly edit this file, because doing so can inadvertently cause you to lose incoming mail.  To see if you have any mail waiting in your INBOX, type mail. If you don't have any mail, mail will indicate this and exit; if you do have mail waiting, mail outputs a list of message headers, one line per message, each containing the status of the message  `N' for new messages, blank for previously read messages , the message number, the name of the sender, the date and time the message was received, and the number of lines and characters in the message.

Sometimes, people put their name, email address, and a small quote, or a piece of ASCII art  such as text written in a figlet font−−−see section Horizonal Text Fonts ; once the World Wide Web became popular, many people started including the URL of their home page in their `.sig'.  The use of signatures goes in and out of vogue with the years; you can decide whether or not you want to use one, but whatever you do, be sure to keep your `.sig' at most four lines in length−−to use any more is considered very bad form. A first line consisting only of `−− ' is sometimes used; many applications recognize this text as the beginning of a `.sig' when processing messages.   31. Email   400   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   You create your signature file in a text editor, just like any other text file. Name the file `.signature' or `.sig', and keep it in your home directory.  If you want to use more than one signature, use sigrot to "rotate" your various signatures−−every time you run sigrot, it selects one of the signature files you keep in your `.sigrot' directory and writes it to `.signature'. To change your `.signature' every time you log in, you would run sigrot in your `.bash_login' file  see section The Shell .

APPLICATION DESCRIPTION balsa  elm  gnus  mew  mh−e  mutt  nmh  mozilla  A graphical email client that works in X with GNOME installed; its interface is inspired somewhat by the proprietary Eudora. {@sf{Debian}}: `balsa' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.balsa.net  A menu−driven MUA, elm was popular in the early 1990s among experienced users−−it has some interesting features, including ways to send mails in batch mode to many addresses at once, and a tool to send telephone messages as email messages. Interest in elm has waned somewhat over the years, and most novices are advised to try mutt instead. {@sf{Debian}}: `elm me+' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.instinct.org elm  The gnus newsreader for Emacs 39  can also be used to read and send mail. It has many features and should appeal to Emacs lovers−−but a warning: it can be daunting to learn! {@sf{Debian}}: `gnus' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.gnus.org  mew is an Emacs mail and news facility developed in Japan. It shows promise as a fairly new MUA and has many features for handling mail in complex ways. {@sf{Debian}}: `mew' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.mew.org  MH−E is an Emacs front end to nmh, below. It's very powerful, yet it remains easy to use. {@sf{Debian}}: `emacsen−common' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.emacs.org  Netscape Inc.'s open source Web browser, mozilla, has its familiar and self−explanatory email interface that works in the X Window System. {@sf{Debian}}: `mozilla' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.mozilla.org  The MUA currently in favor among many vi users is mutt; it is one of the most popular MUAs for Linux. {@sf{Debian}}: `mutt' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.mutt.org  The Rand "Mail Handling" system, mh, is not one application but a collection of small tools for manipulating mail folders. It should appeal to those who excel at building complex commands from combinations of simple tools and operators. nmh is the new "Mail Handling" system, containing rewrites and improved versions of the mh tools. Most Linux systems will install this over the old mh. {@sf{Debian}}: `nmh' {@sf{WWW}}: http:  www.mhost.com nmh    31.

Email   402    32. The World Wide Web  Next to email, the most useful service on the Internet is the World Wide Web  often written "WWW" or "Web" . It is a giant network of hypertext documents and services, and it keeps growing by the instant−−anyone with an Internet−connected computer can read anything on the Web, and anyone can publish to the Web. It could well be the world's largest public repository of information.  This chapter describes tools for accessing and using the Web. It also describes tools for writing text files in HTML  "HyperText Markup Language" , the native document format of the Web.     Netscape's famous Web browser.  32.1 Browsing the Web 32.2 Viewing an Image from the Web    Viewing images from the Web. 32.3 Reading Text from the Web 32.4 Browsing the Web in Emacs 32.5 Getting Files from the Web 32.6 Writing HTML 32.7 More Web Browsers and Tools     Reading text from the Web.

Most Web sites today make heavy use of graphic images; furthermore, commercial Web sites are usually optimized for Netscape−compatible browsers−−many of them not even accessible with other alternative browsers. That means you'll want to use this application for browsing this kind of Web site.  The version of Netscape's browser which had been released as free, open source software  see section What's Open Source?  in 1998 to much fanfare is called Mozilla. 40  When first released, the Mozilla application was a "developer's only" release, but as of this writing it is finally reaching a state where it is ready for general use.  Once the Mozilla browser has been installed, run it in X either by typing mozilla in a shell or by selecting it from a menu in the usual fashion, as dictated by your window manager.   32. The World Wide Web   403   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Like most graphical Web browsers, its use is fairly self−explanatory; type a URL in the Location dialog box to open that URL, and left−click on a link to follow it, replacing the contents of the browser's main window with the contents of that link. One nice feature for Emacs fans is that you can use Emacs−style keystrokes for cursor movement in Mozilla's dialog boxes  see section Basic Emacs Editing Keys .  A typical Mozilla window looks like this:   In this example, the URL http:  slashdot.org  is loaded.   A criticism of the earlier Netscape Navigator programs is that the browser is a bloated application: it contained its own email client, its own Usenet newsreader, and other functions that are not necessary when one wants to simply browse the Web. Since Mozilla is free software, anyone can take out these excess parts to make a slimmer, faster, smaller application−−and that is what some have done. Two of these projects, Galeon and Skipstone, show some promise; see the above URLs for their home pages. 41   The following recipes will help you get the most out of using a graphical Web browser in Linux.  NOTE: Mozilla development is moving very rapidly these days, and while Mozilla is continually improving at a fantastic rate, some of these recipes may not work as described with the version you have.  Another way to browse the Web is to use Emacs  see section Browsing the Web in Emacs ; more alternative browsers are listed in More Web Browsers and Tools.  32.1.1 Maintaining a List of Visited Web Sites 32.1.2 Opening a URL from a Script 32.1.3 Mozilla Browsing Tips     Keeping a history of your browsing.

You start it in the background, and each time you visit a URL in a Web browser  as of this writing, works with the Netscape, Arena, and Amaya browsers , it writes the name and URL to its current history log, which you can view at any time.    To start browser−history every time you start X, put the following line in your `.xsession' file:  browser−history 38;  The browser history logs are kept in a hidden directory called `.browser−history' in your home directory. The current history log is always called `history−log.html'; it's an HTML file that you can view in a Web browser.    To view the current history log with lynx, type:  $ lynx ~ .browser−history history−log.html RET  Past history logs have the year, month, and week appended to their name, and they are compressed  see section Compressed Files . After uncompressing them, you can view them just as you would view the current log  if you are viewing them in Mozilla, you don't even need to uncompress them−−it handles this automagically.   You can also use zgrep to search through your old browser history logs. The logs keep the URL and title of each site you visit, so you can search for either−−then when someone asks, "Remember that good article about such−and−such?" you can do a zgrep on the files in your `~ .browser−history' directory to find it.    To find any URLs from the list of those you visited in the year 2000 whose titles contain the word `Confessions', type:  $ zgrep Confessions ~ .browser−history history−log−2000* RET  This command searches all your logs from the year 2000 for the text `Confessions' in it, and outputs   32.

To open the URL http:  www.drudgereport.com  in Mozilla from a shell script, use the following line:    mozilla −remote 'openURL http:  www.drudgereport.com  '  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   32.1.3 Mozilla Browsing Tips  The following tips make Web browsing with Mozilla easier and more efficient.    Many users disable Java and JavaScript altogether; most Web sites don't require their use, and they often introduce security problems or have other pernicious effects on your browsing. Just say no.    Disabling the automatic loading of images can help if you are on a slow connection; the broken−image icons take some getting used to, but you'll be surprised at how much more quickly pages will load! If you need to see a page's images, just left−click on the Load Images button. You can also right−click on the broken−image icon of the image you want to load and select Open this Image.    Right−click on an image to save it to a file; you will be given a choice to either open the image in the browser window or save it to a file.    To open a link in another browser window, middle−click on the link. Opening multiple links in their own windows saves time when you are doing a lot of "power browsing."    If a site forces links to open in a new window, and you don't want to do that, right−click on the link you want to open, and choose Open this Link; the link will open in the current browser window.    To go back to the last URL you visited, type ALT−@leftarrow, and to go forward to the next   32. The World Wide Web   406   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   URL in your history, type ALT−@rightarrow.  These keys may not have the desired effect in some window managers; if they don't work for you, try using the CTRL key instead of the ALT key.  [GNU INFO BUG: any   in the preceding line should be the   arrow keys.]    If your visited−URL history on the Go menu is very large, and earlier URLs are truncated, you can still visit them by doing this: left−click one of the lowest entries on the menu, and visit that; then, left−click on the Home button. This eliminates all the URLs in the history list that are more recent than the page you'd just visited, but all of the old pages will be back in the list.    To open your bookmarks file in a new window, type ALT−b.    To open a new Mozilla window, ALT−n  it's often useful to have several windows open at once .

This is especially nice for viewing your favorite webcam image, or for viewing images on ftp sites−−you don't have to log in or type any other commands at all.    To view the image at ftp:  garbo.uwasa.fi garbo−gifs garbo01.gif, type:     $ display ftp:  garbo.uwasa.fi garbo−gifs garbo01.gif RET  NOTE: When viewing the image, you can use all of the image manipulation commands that display supports, including resizing and changing the magnification of the image.

The World Wide Web   407   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   interface for reading hypertext.  Type lynx to start it−−if a "start page" is defined, it will load. The start page is defined in ` etc lynx.cfg', and can be a URL pointing to a file on the local system or to an address on the Web; you need superuser privileges to edit this file. On Debian systems, the start page comes defined as the Debian home page, http:  www.debian.org   but you can change this, of course; many experienced users write their own start page, containing links to frequently−visited URLs, and save it as a local file in their home directory tree .  To open a URL, give the URL as an argument.    To view the URL http:  lycaeum.org , type:     $ lynx http:  lycaeum.org  RET  When in lynx, the following keyboard commands work:  DESCRIPTION  COMMAND @uparrowand@downarrow Move forward and backward through links in the current document. @rightarroworRET @leftarrow DEL PgDnorSPC PgUp =  Follow the hyperlink currently selected by the cursor. Go back to the previously displayed URL. View a history of all URLs visited during this session. Scroll down to the next page in the current document. Scroll up to the previous page in the current document. Display information about the current document  like all pages in lynx, type @leftarrow to go back to the previous document . Go to a URL; lynx will prompt you for the URL to go to. Type @uparrow to insert on this line the last URL that was visited; once inserted, you can edit it. Display the lynx help files. Quit browsing and exit the program; lynx will ask to verify this action.  h q  g  The following are some recipes for using lynx.  NOTE: Emacs users might want to use the `−emacskeys' option when starting lynx; it enables you to use Emacs−style keystrokes for cursor movement  see section Basic Emacs Editing Keys .  32.3.1 Perusing Text from the Web 32.3.2 Viewing a Site That Requires Authorization 32.3.3 Options Available while Browsing Text  Perusing text from the Web.

This dumps the text of the given URL to the standard output, and you can pipe this to less for perusal, or use redirection to save it to a file.    To peruse the text of http:  www.sc.edu fitzgerald winterd winter.html, type  all on one line :  $ lynx −dump  http:  www.sc.edu fitzgerald winterd winter.html  less RET  It's an old net convention for italicized words to be displayed in an etext inside underscores like `_this_'; use the `−underscore' option to output any italicized text in this manner.  By default, lynx annotates all the hyperlinks and produces a list of footnoted links at the bottom of the screen. If you don't want them, add the `−nolist' option and just the "pure text" will be returned.    To output the pure text, with underscores, of the previous URL, and save it to the file `winter_dreams', type  all on one line :        $ lynx −dump −nolist −underscore  http:  www.sc.edu fitzgerald winterd winter.html 62; winter_dreams RET  You can do other things with the pure text, like pipe it to enscript for setting it in a font for printing.    To print the pure text, with underscores, of the previous URL in a Times Roman font, type  all on one line :     $ lynx −dump −nolist −underscore  http:  www.sc.edu fitzgerald winterd winter.html  enscript −B  −f "Times−Roman10" RET  NOTE: To peruse the plain text of a URL with its HTML tags removed and no formatting done to the text, see Converting HTML to Another Format.

To view the URL http:  www.nytimes.com archive  with a username and password of `cypherpunks', type  all on one line :  $ lynx −auth=cypherpunks:cypherpunks http:  www.nytimes.com archive  RET   It's often common to combine this with the options for saving to a file, so that you can retrieve an annotated text copy of a file from a site that normally requires registration.    To save the URL http:  www.nytimes.com archive  as an annotated text file, `mynews', type  all on one line :  $ lynx −dump −number_links −auth=cypherpunks:cypherpunks http:  www.nytimes.com archive  62; mynews RET  NOTE: The username and password argument you give on the command line will be recorded in your shell history log  see section Command History , and it will be visible to other users on the system should they look to see what processes you're running  see section Listing All of a User's Processes .

It can retrieve files from URLs that begin with either `http' or `ftp'. It keeps the file's original timestamp, it's smaller and faster to use than a browser, and it shows a visual display of the download progress.  The following subsections contain recipes for using wget to retrieve information from the Web. See Info file `wget.info', node `Examples', for more examples of things you can do with wget.  NOTE: To retrieve an HTML file from the Web and save it as formatted text, use lynx instead−−see Perusing Text from the Web.  32.5.1 Saving a URL to a File 32.5.2 Archiving an Entire Web Site 32.5.3 Archiving Part of a Web Site 32.5.4 Reading the Headers of a Web Page     Getting a URL.

The World Wide Web   413   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    32.5.1 Saving a URL to a File  To download a single file from the Web, give the URL of the file as an argument to wget.    For example, to download ftp:  ftp.neuron.net pub spiral septembr.mp3 to a file, type:           $ wget ftp:  ftp.neuron.net pub spiral septembr.mp3 RET  This command reads a given URL, writing its contents to a file with the same name as the original, `septembr.mp3', in the current working directory.  If you interrupt a download before it's finished, the contents of the file you were retrieving will contain only the portion of the file wget retrieved until it was interrupted. Use wget with the `−c' option to resume the download from the point it left off.    To resume download of the URL from the previous example, type:  $ wget −c ftp:  ftp.neuron.net pub spiral septembr.mp3 RET  NOTE: In order for the `−c' option to have the desired effect, you should run wget from the same directory as it was run previously, where that partially−retrieved file should still exist.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   32.5.2 Archiving an Entire Web Site  To archive a single Web site, use the `−m'  "mirror"  option, which saves files with the exact timestamp of the original, if possible, and sets the "recursive retrieval" option to download everything. To specify the number of retries to use when an error occurs in retrieval, use the `−t' option with a numeric argument−−−`−t3' is usually good for safely retrieving across the net; use `−t0' to specify an infinite number of retries, good for when a network connection is really bad but you really want to archive something, regardless of how long it takes. Finally, use the `−o' with a file name as an argument to write a progress log to the file−−examining it can be useful in the event that something goes wrong during the archiving; once the archival process is complete and you've determined that it was successful, you can delete the log file.    To mirror the Web site at http:  www.bloofga.org , giving up to three retries for retrieving files and putting error messages in a log file called `mirror.log', type:  $ wget −m −t3 http:  www.bloofga.org  −o mirror.log RET   32.

Log messages are written to a file in the current directory called `mirror.log'.  To continue an archive that you've left off, use the `−nc'  "no clobber"  option; it doesn't retrieve files that have already been downloaded. For this option to work the way you want it to, be sure that you are in the same directory that you were in when you originally began archiving the site.    To continue an interrupted mirror of the Web site at http:  www.bloofga.org  and make sure that existing files are not downloaded, giving up to three retries for retrieval of files and putting error messages in a log file called `mirror.log', type:  $ wget −nc −m −t3 http:  www.bloofga.org  −o mirror.log RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   32.5.3 Archiving Part of a Web Site  To archive only part of a Web site−−such as, say, a user's home page−−use the `−I' option followed by a list of the absolute path names of the directories to archive; all other directories on the site are ignored.    To archive the Web site at http:  dougal.bris.ac.uk ~mbt , only archiving the ` ~mbt' directory, and writing log messages to a file called `uk.log', type:  $ wget −m −t3 −I  ~mbt http:  dougal.bris.ac.uk ~mbt  −o uk.log RET   This command archives all files on the http:  dougal.bris.ac.uk ~mbt  Web site whose directory names begin with ` ~mbt'.  To only get files in a given directory, use the `−r' and `−l1' options  the `−l' option specifies the number of levels to descend from the given level . To only download files in a given directory, combine these options with the `−−no−parent' option, which specifies not to ascend to the parent directory.  Use the `−A' option to specify the exact file name extensions to accept−−for example, use `−A txt,text,tex' to only download files whose names end with `.txt', `.text', and `.tex' extensions. The `−R' option works similarly, but specifies the file extensions to reject and not download.

These headers contain information such as the current system date of the Web server host and the name and version of the Web server and operating system software.  Use the `−S' option with wget to output these headers when retrieving files; headers are output to standard output, or to the log file, if used.    To retrieve the file at http:  slashdot.org  and output the headers, type:     $ wget −S http:  slashdot.org  RET  This command writes the server response headers to standard output and saves the contents of http:  slashdot.org  to a file in the current directory whose name is the same as the original file.

You can write HTML files in any text editor; then, open the file in a Web browser to see the HTML markup rendered in its resulting hypertext appearance.  Many people swear by Bluefish, a full−featured, user−friendly HTML editor for X.  Emacs  see section Emacs  has a major mode to facilitate the editing of HTML files; to start this mode in a buffer, type:     M−x html−mode RET  The features of HTML mode include the insertion of "skeleton" constructs.   32.

By specifying these parameters in all the image tags on a page, the text in that page will display in the browser window before the images are loaded. Without them, the browser must load all images before any of the text on the page is displayed.  Use imgsizer to automatically determine the proper values and insert them into an HTML file. Give the name of the HTML file to fix as an argument.    To add `HEIGHT' and `WIDTH' parameters to the file `index.html', type:  $ imgsizer index.html RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]         32. The World Wide Web   417   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    32.6.2 Converting HTML to Another Format  @sf{Debian}: `unhtml' @sf{Debian}: `html2ps' @sf{WWW}: http:  dragon.acadiau.ca ~013639s  @sf{WWW}: http:  www.tdb.uu.se ~jan html2ps.html  There are several ways to convert HTML files to other formats. You can convert the HTML to plain text for reading, processing, or conversion to still other formats; you can also convert the HTML to PostScript, which you can view, print, or also convert to other formats, such as PDF.  To simply remove the HTML formatting from text, use unhtml. It reads from the standard input  or a specified file name , and it writes its output to standard output.    To peruse the file `index.html' with its HTML tags removed, type:  $ unhtml index.html  less RET    To remove the HTML tags from the file `index.html' and write the output to a file called `index.txt', type:  $ unhtml index.html 62; index.txt RET  When you remove the HTML tags from a file with unhtml, no further formatting is done to the text. Furthermore, it only works on files, and not on URLs themselves.  Use lynx to save an HTML file or a URL as a formatted text file, so that the resultant text looks like the original HTML when viewed in lynx. It can also preserve italics and hyperlink information in the original HTML. See section Perusing Text from the Web.  One thing you can do with this lynx output is pipe it to tools for spacing text, and then send that to enscript for setting in a font. This is useful for printing a Web page in typescript "manuscript" form, with images and graphics removed and text set double−spaced in a Courier font.    To print a copy of the URL http:  example.com essay  in typescript manuscript form, type:  $ lynx −dump −underscore −nolist http:  example.com essay   pr −d  enscript −B RET  NOTE: In some cases, you might want to edit the file before you print it, such as when a Web page contains text navigation bars or other text that you'd want to remove before you turn it into a manuscript. In such a case, you'd pipe the lynx output to a file, edit the file, and then use pr on the file and pipe that output to enscript for printing.  Finally, you can use html2ps to convert an HTML file to PostScript; this is useful when you want to print a Web page with all its graphics and images, or when you want to convert all or part of a Web site into PDF.   32. The World Wide Web   418                     The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Give the URLs or file names of the HTML files to convert as options. Use the `−u' option to underline the anchor text of hypertext links, and specify a file name to write to as an argument to the `−o' option. The defaults are to not underline links, and to write to the standard output.    To print a PostScript copy of the document at the URL http:  example.com essay  to the default printer, type:  $ html2ps http:  example.com essay   lpr RET    To write a copy of the document at the URL http:  example.com essay  to a PostScript file `submission.ps' with all hypertext links underlined, type:  $ html2ps −u −o submission.ps http:  example.com essay  RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   32.6.3 Validating an HTML File  @sf{Debian}: `weblint' @sf{WWW}: http:  www.weblint.org   Use weblint to validate the basic structure and syntax of an HTML file. Give the name of the file to be checked as an argument, and weblint outputs any complaints it has with the file to standard output, such as whether or not IMG elements are missing ALT descriptions, or whether nested elements overlap.    To validate the HTML in the file `index.html', type:  $ weblint index.html RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   32.7 More Web Browsers and Tools  Surprisingly, there are not nearly as many Web browsers for Linux as there are text editors−−or even text viewers. This remains true for any operating system, and I have often pondered why this is; perhaps "browsing the Web," a fairly recent activity in itself, may soon be obsoleted by Web readers and other tools.

You will then be brought to the telnet command prompt, where you can suspend with the `z' command; to return to the remote system, bring the job back into the foreground  see section Putting a Job in the Foreground .    To temporarily return to a local shell prompt, type:  faraway−system$ C−[ telnet62; z RET [2]+ Stopped                    telnet $    To return to the remote system, type:        $ fg RET faraway−system$  In the first of the two preceding examples, the escape character C−[ was typed on the remote system, whose shell prompt in this example is `faraway−system$'  you don't have to type the escape character at a shell prompt, though; you can type it regardless of what program you are running or where you are on the remote system . Then, the `z' command was given to telnet to suspend the telnet connection. In the second example, the suspended telnet connection to the remote system was brought back into the foreground.  NOTE: You should be aware that it's possible  though not often desirable  to "nest" multiple layers of telnet sessions on top of each other by connecting from one system to the next, to the next, and so on, without disconnecting from the previous system. To avoid this, make sure you know which host you're leaving when you're about to telnet off to another; the hostname tool is useful for this  see section Logging In to the System .

Other Internet Services   423   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   telnet. These tools encrypt the data that is passed between the local and remote systems during your connect session; they're becoming very popular today among security−conscious administrators. Should you be asked to use one, follow your administrator's instructions in installing and configuring it for your system.  NOTE: In order to be of any use, the services and tools discussed in this chapter require that your system is online or otherwise connected to a network; see Communications.

Use the ftp tool to connect to another system using this protocol, giving the name or numeric IP address of the system you want to connect to as an argument. Once connected, you will be prompted to log in with a username and password  if you have one on that system .  Many systems are set up to accept "anonymous ftp" connections, where a public repository of files are available for downloading by the general public; to use this, log in with a username of anonymous, and give your email address for a password.    To make an anonymous ftp connection to ftp.leo.org, type:     $ ftp ftp.leo.org RET Connected to ftp.leo.org. 220−Welcome to LEO.ORG. 220−See file README for more information about this archive. 220− 220−Your connection class is named: The world outside Germany 220− 220−If you don't connect from inside Munich and login anonymously, 220−your data transfers are limited to a certain bandwidth. 220− 220−If you notice unusual behaviour, drop a note to ftp−admin@leo.org. 220 FTP server leo.org−0.9alpha ready.

Other Internet Services   424   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   remote system.  It is standard practice for public systems to have a ` pub' directory on their FTP host that contains all the files and goodies available to the general public.    To change to the ` pub' directory on the remote system and look at the files that are there, type:        ftp62; cd  pub RET 250 Directory changed to  pub. ftp62; ls RET ftp62; ls 200 PORT command successful. 150 Opening ASCII connection for file  918 bytes  total 30258 −rw−rw−r−−   1 ftpadmin ftpadmin 10942767 Sep 28 06:18 INDEX.gz drwxr−xr−x   5 ftpadmin ftpadmin     512 Sep 17 18:22 comp −rw−rw−r−−   1 ftpadmin ftpadmin 9512498 Sep 28 06:40 ls−lR.gz drwxr−xr−x   2 ftpadmin ftpadmin     512 Sep 17 18:22 rec drwxr−xr−x   3 ftpadmin ftpadmin     512 Sep 17 18:22 science 226 Transfer completed with 918 Bytes s. ftp62;   In this example, the ` pub' directory contained three subdirectories  `comp', `rec', and `science'  and two files, `INDEX.gz' and `ls−lR.gz'; many public systems have files similar to these in their ` pub' directories−−−`INDEX.gz' is a listing of all files on their ftp site, with descriptions, and `ls−lR.gz' is the output of the command ls −lR run on the directory tree of their ftp server.  The following subsections describe how to upload and download files. Use the quit command to exit ftp and end the connection to the remote system.  33.2.1 Uploading a File 33.2.2 Downloading a File    Downloading files.     Uploading files.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   33.2.1 Uploading a File  Use the put command to upload a file; give the name of the file as an argument. put takes that file in the current directory of the local system, and puts a copy of it in the current directory of the remote system.    To put a copy of the file `thyme.rcp' from the current directory on the local system to the current directory of the remote system, type:   33. Other Internet Services   425   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   ftp62; put thyme.rcp RET  The current directory of the local system is, by default, the directory where you ran the ftp command. To change directories on your local system, use lcd; it works just like the cd command, but it changes the local directory.    To change to the parent directory of the current directory on the local system, type:  ftp62; lcd .. RET Local directory now  home james demos ftp62;   In this example, the local current directory is now ` home james demos'.  There are other important commands for downloading files−−use `i' to specify that files be transferred as binary; normally, the transfer is set up for text files. When you want to transfer programs, archives, compressed files, or any other non−text file, set the transfer type to `i' first.  In recent years, most public systems have added a security measure forbidding the upload by anonymous users to anywhere but the ` incoming' or ` pub incoming' directories.  The mput command works like put but allows you to specify wildcards. By default, mput asks you, for each file, whether to upload the file or not; to turn off this file prompting, type prompt before giving the mput command. This command is a toggle−−type prompt again to turn file prompting back on for your session.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   33.2.2 Downloading a File  The get command works like put, but in reverse−−specify a file on the remote system, and get saves a copy to the current directory on the local system. Again, use i first when downloading non−text files.  You can also download text files with i, so it is good practice to always set it before you transfer files; most Linux systems are configured to set the type to `i' immediately upon connection .    To download the file `INDEX.gz' in the current directory on the remote system, saving it to your `~ tmp' directory, type:        ftp62; lcd ~ tmp RET Local directory now  home james tmp ftp get INDEX.gz RET local: INDEX.gz remote: INDEX.gz Transferred 10942767 bytes ftp62;   33. Other Internet Services   426   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: The mget command works like get but allows wildcards; as with mput, you will be prompted to verify each file unless you use the prompt command first to turn this off.

Newsgroups are named and organized by hierarchy, with each branch delineated by a period  `.' ; for example, the `comp.os.linux' newsgroup is part of the `comp.os' branch of the `comp' hierarchy.  The following table lists the "Big Eight" Usenet hierarchies and give examples of some newsgroups in each one.  USENET HIERARCHY DESCRIPTION comp  humanities misc news  rec  sci soc  talk  Computing. news:comp.os.linux.advocacy, news:comp.text.tex Humanities. news:humanities.music.composers.wagner Miscellaneous. news:misc.consumers.frugal−living Newsgroups relating to Usenet itself. news.newusers.questions Recreation. news:rec.music.marketplace.vinyl, news:rec.food.cooking Science. news:sci.math, news:sci.cognitive Social groups and cultures. news:soc.culture.usa, news:soc.college Talk and chit−chat. news:talk.environment, news:talk.politics.guns  While there are many other hierarchies, these eight are technically the only newsgroups considered to be part of Usenet proper. While netnews is the term for the collection of all newsgroups including those in Usenet, these terms are often used interchangeably.  The "alternative" hierarchy, `alt', is perhaps the most popular hierarchy of all−−just about every subject you might want to discuss has an appropriate newsgroup here, including non sequiturs. There are also hierarchies for topics concerning certain geographical areas; for example, the `cols.' hierarchy is for topics pertaining to Columbus, Ohio, and `seattle' is for Seattle, Washington. So, while `cols.forsale' pertains to items for sale in the greater Columbus area, `seattle.forsale' is for items for sale in and around Seattle. Hierarchies can exist also for certain organizations; for example, the `gnu' hierarchy is for newsgroups concerning the GNU Project, and `bit' is for newsgroup redistributions of the popular Bitnet LISTSERV mailing lists.   33.

This is useful for finding groups on a particular topic.          To output a list of all newsgroups that match the pattern `society', type:  $ nngrep society RET  Use the `−u' option to only search through unsubscribed groups. This is useful if you are subscribed to a number of groups, and you are looking only for groups you aren't subscribed to yet.    To output a list of all unsubscribed−to newsgroups that match the pattern `society', type:  $ nngrep society RET  In the previous example, if you were already subscribed to the group alt.society.neutopia, that group will not be displayed; but other groups matching the pattern `society' that you are not subscribed to would be listed.

Type ping followed by the name or numeric IP address of the system you want to check; if your system is online and the system to be checked is also online, ping should continually output lines telling how long the latency, in milliseconds, is between the two systems. Type C−c to interrupt it and stop pinging.    To ping the host bfi.org, type:     $ ping bfi.org RET PING bfi.org  209.196.135.250 : 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 209.196.135.250: icmp_seq=0 ttl=63 time=190.0 ms 64 bytes from 209.196.135.250: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=159.9 ms 64 bytes from 209.196.135.250: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=160.5 ms C−c −−− bfi.org ping statistics −−− 3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss round−trip min avg max = 159.9 170.1 190.0 ms $  In this example, the host bfi.org was pinged and a total of three pings were sent and received before the user typed C−c to interrupt it. As long as these ping lines are output, you know that the other machine is connected to the Internet  or at least to the same network that your localhost is connected to .  You really don't need to analyze the information on each line of a ping message−−the only useful information is the number at the end of the line, which tells you how many milliseconds it took to go out to the Internet, touch or "ping" that host, and come back. 43  The quicker the better−−−pings that are four or five digits long  or greater  mean a slow connection between the two machines. When you interrupt the ping, some statistics are output, including the minimum, average, and maximum number of milliseconds it took to ping the given host. In the example above, the high was 190 and the low was 159.9 milliseconds, with an average of 170.1.  NOTE: If your own system is not online, ping will report that either the network is unreachable or that the host isn't found.

Give as an argument the username of the user  if on the local system  or their email address  if on a remote system . This is called "fingering" a user.   33. Other Internet Services   430   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   If the system they are using has finger enabled  most Unix−based systems should , the command will tell you the following: the date and time when they last logged in; whether or not they are currently logged in; their full name; their office room and telephone number; their home directory; what shell they use; whether or not they have mail waiting; the last time they read mail; and, finally, their "plan," as described below.          To finger the user bradley@ap.spl.org, type:  $ finger bradley@ap.spl.org RET [ap.spl.org] Login: bradley                         Name: Bradley J Milton Directory:  sp1 bradley                Shell:  bin tcsh Last login Wed Jan 20 16:38 1999  PST  on ttypb from zais.pair.com No mail. Plan: To learn to how use Linux and GNU software. $  In this example, the user bradley on the system at ap.spl.org is not currently logged in, logged in last on 20 January, and uses the tsch shell.  NOTE: On Unix−based systems, you can put information in a hidden file in your home directory called `.plan', and that text will be output when someone fingers you. Some people put elaborate information in their `.plan' files; in the early 1990s, it was very much in vogue to have long, rambling .plans. Sometimes, people put information in their `.plan' file for special events−−for example, someone who is having a party next weekend might put directions to their house in their `.plan' file.

This gives a listing of all the users who are currently logged in on that system. It doesn't give each individual's `.plan's, but the output includes how long each user has been idle, where they are connected from, and  sometimes  what command they are running.  The particular information that is output depends on the operating system and configuration of the remote system.     To output the users who are currently logged in to the system ap.spl.org, type:  $ finger @ap.spl.org RET [spl.org] Login      Name              Tty  Idle  Login Time   Office allison    Allison Chaynes  *q2 16:23  Sep 27 17:22  gate1.grayline  gopherd    Gopher Client    *r4  1:01  Sep 28 08:29  gopherd  johnnyzine Johnny McKenna   *q9 15:07  Sep 27 16:02  johnnyzine    33.

You can also use dig, the "domain information groper" tool. Give a hostname as an argument to output information about that host, including its IP address in a section labelled `ANSWER SECTION'.    To find the IP address of the host linart.net, type:  $ dig linart.net RET ...output messages... ;; ANSWER SECTION: linart.net.            1D IN A         64.240.156.195 ...output messages... $  In this example, dig output the IP address of 64.240.156.195 as the IP address for the host linart.net.

Use the whois command to view the domain records for the common .com, .org, .net, and .edu top−level domains.  With only a domain name as an argument, whois outputs the name of the "Whois Server" that has that particular domain record. To output the domain record, specify the Whois Server to use as an argument to the `−h' option.    To output the name of the Whois Server for linart.net, type:  $ whois linart.net RET    To view the domain record for linart.net, using the whois.networksolutions.com Whois Server, type:  $ whois −h whois.networksolutions.com linart.net RET  NOTE: This command also outputs the names of the nameservers that handle the given domain−−this is useful to get an idea of where a particular Web site is hosted.

Give the username you want to write to as an argument. This command writes the message you give, preceded with a header line indicating that the following is a message from you, and giving the current system time. It also rings the bell on the user's terminal.    To send the message `Wake up!' to the terminal where user `sleepy' is logged in, type:   33. Other Internet Services   433   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     $ write sleepy RET  Wake up! C−d $  The other user can reply to you by running write and giving your username as an argument. Traditionally, users ended a write message with `−o', which indicated that what they were saying was "over" and that it was now the other person's turn to talk. When a user believed that a conversation was completed, the user would end a line with `oo', meaning that they were "over and out."  A similar command, wall, writes a text message to all other users on the local system. It takes a text file as an argument and outputs the contents of that file; with no argument, it outputs what you type until you type C−d on a line by itself. It precedes the message with the text `Broadcast message from username'  where username is your username  followed by the current system time, and it rings the bell on all terminals it broadcasts to.    To output the contents of ` etc motd' to all logged−in terminals, type:  $ wall  etc motd RET    To output the text `Who wants to go out for Chinese food?' to all logged−in terminals, type:  $ wall RET Who wants to go out for Chinese food? RET C−d  You can control write access to your terminal with mesg. It works like biff  see section Setting Notification for New Mail : with no arguments, it outputs whether or not it is set; with `y' as an argument, it allows messages to be sent to your terminal; and with `n' as an argument, is disallows them.  The default for all users is to allow messages to be written to their terminals; antisocial people usually put the line mesg n in their `.bashrc' file  see section Customizing Future Shells .    To disallow messages to be written to your terminal, type:    To output the current access state of your terminal, type:  $ mesg n RET  $ mesg RET is n $  In the preceding example above, mesg indicated that messages are currently disallowed to be written to your terminal.   33.

The following recipes describe the most popular tools and methods for doing this.  33.6.1 Chatting Directly with a User 33.6.2 Chatting with Users on IRC 33.6.3 Chatting with Users on ICQ     Chatting directly with a user.

Give the username  or email address  of the user you want to chat with as an argument; a message will be sent to that user's terminal, indicating that a connection is requested. If that person then runs talk, giving your username as an argument, you will both be connected in a talk session−−the screen will clear and then what you type will appear on the top of the screen; what the other user types will appear at the bottom of the screen.    To request a chat with the user kat@kent.edu, type:     $ talk kat@kent.edu RET  This command sends a connection request to the user kat@kent.edu. If the user is not logged on or is refusing messages, talk will output a message indicating such; but if that user is available, talk will send a message to that user asking to complete the connection, and it will tell you that it is ringing your party.  If that user then types talk stutz@dsl.org  if, in this example, your email address is stutz@dsl.org , then your screen will clear and you will see the following:   33. Other Internet Services   435   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   You can then type, and what you type will appear on both your screen and that user's screen; that user, in turn, can also type−−even while you are typing−−and what that user types appears on the other half of both screens:  It is standard practice to indicate that you are done saying something by typing RETRET, thus making a blank line on your half of the screen. Some users, when they have typed to the bottom of their half of the screen, sometimes type RET repeatedly to "clear" their half of the screen and bring the cursor back to the top.  Type C−c to end a talk session.  When you type, both users see the characters appear in realtime; my first demonstration of the interactive nature of the Internet, back in 1991, was when I had a live, real−time chat with a user in Australia, on the   33.

IRC is a great way to meet and talk to all kinds of people, live on the Internet; it has historically been very popular with Linux users.  There are several IRC networks, each with its own servers and tens of thousands of users; to "go on" IRC, you use an IRC client program to connect with an IRC server. Like CB radio, IRC networks have channels, usually based on a particular topic, which you join to chat with other users in that channel  you can also send private messages to other users .  The following table lists some of the IRC clients available for Linux.

Since then, many free software chat tools have been written that use the ICQ protocol.  One nice feature of ICQ is is that you can maintain a "buddy list" of email addresses, and when you have an ICQ client running, it will tell you whether or not any of your buddies are online. But unlike talk, you can't watch the other user type in realtime−−messages are displayed in the other user's ICQ client only when you send them.

Administrative Issues  Every Linux system has an administrator−−−someone who installs the hardware and software, maintains the system, and generally keeps things running smoothly. A single−user home Linux system, once installed and running, needs little administration−−but the occasional upgrade or maintenance task is necessary.  This appendix exists as a reference for those users who will also be performing the administrative duties on their system. While a complete administrative guide is out of the scope of this book, the goal of this appendix is to point the new Linux administrator in the right direction, giving tips on how to choose the computer you'll use for Linux, install Debian GNU Linux on it, and get it ready for use.  Unlike the rest of this book, this chapter contains recipes describing commands to be run by root, the superuser account. Many of these commands cannot be run by an ordinary user; instead of the normal shell prompt used for examples throughout the rest of the book  `$' , the examples in these recipes use a pound sign  `' , which is the default prompt for the root account.

But no more. Today, many dealers sell complete systems with Linux pre−installed, including corporations like Dell Computers and IBM. 44   The Duke of URL reviews the latest hardware as it performs with Linux. His periodic "Linux Buyer's Guide" feature lists current hardware that works well on a Linux−based system, and it gives sample configurations  with prices and links to vendors  for putting together a complete system−−from low−end budget system to a blazing, dual−processor rig.   A. Administrative Issues   439   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   Since Linux runs on many different computers and supports a wide range of hardware, and because everyone has different needs, I won't make too many recommendations as to which specific hardware to buy.  Systems change too fast for such a list to be useful, anyway.   Before you make a hardware purchase, though, make sure that it's compatible with Linux−−that bargain video−capture board will be worthless if it has a proprietary interface that only works with a certain non−free operating system.  To find out whether your hardware will work under Linux, try the following:    Read the Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO  see section Reading System Documentation and Help Files , an up−to−date list of hardware that is compatible with Linux.    Visit the Linux Hardware Database and Linux Hardware.Net sites, which provide reviews and information about hardware that works with Linux.    Search the Internet−−particularly Usenet news and the linux.com site−−for the hardware you intend to buy. Read any trouble reports people may have written about getting it to work with Linux, so that you won't be writing the next report about it.

It notifies all users and processes of the impending shutdown, blocks new logins, and brings the system down cleanly.  Just cutting power to the system without cleanly stopping processes and unmounting filesystems could result in the loss or corruption of data.   To halt the system once the shutdown is complete, use the `−h' option; to reboot the system after shutdown, use `−r' instead.  The following recipes describe ways of using shutdown to do useful things.

To immediately shut down and halt the system, type:   shutdown −h now RET    To immediately shutdown the system, and then reboot, type:   shutdown −r now RET  You can follow the `now' argument with a quoted message that will be displayed on all terminals of all users currently logged in.    To immediately shut down and halt the system, and send a warning message to all users, type:   shutdown −h now "The system is being shut down now!" RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.2.2 Shutting Down at a Certain Time  To shut down the system at a certain time, give that time  in 24−hour format  as an argument.    To shut down and then reboot the system at 4:23 a.m., type:   shutdown −r 4:23 RET    To shut down and halt the system at 8:00 p.m., type:   shutdown −h 20:00 RET                 To shut down the system in a certain number of minutes, give that number of minutes prefaced by a plus sign  `+' .   A. Administrative Issues   441               The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:     To shut down and halt the system in five mintues, type:   shutdown −h +5 RET  Follow the time with a quoted message to display it on the terminals of all logged in users.    To shut down and halt the system at midnight, and give a warning message to all logged−in users, type:   shutdown −h 00:00 "The system is going down for maintenance at midnight" RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.2.3 Cancelling a Shutdown  If you have given a shutdown and decide that you don't actually want to shut the system down, run shutdown again with the `−c' option. This command stops any shutdowns in progress.    To cancel any pending shutdown, type:   shutdown −c RET  As with a normal system shutdown, you can send out an explanatory message with the cancel that will be shown to all users.    To cancel any pending shutdown and send an explanatory message to all logged in users, type:   shutdown −c "Sorry, I hit the wrong key!" RET  This command cancels any pending system shutdown and displays the message, `Sorry, I hit the wrong key!' on all the terminals of anyone logged in.

If you choose to buy a copy of Debian in a local computer store, be sure you get the most recent version. If a store only carries an older version, the software might not work with your brand−new hardware!  Visit the Debian Web site to find the number of the latest version.   If you'd rather buy a copy online, Cheap*Bytes sells affordable Debian GNU Linux CD−ROMs. The Debian Project maintains a full list of vendors at http:  www.debian.org distrib vendors .  The precise details of installation are out of the scope of this book, but the Debian installation guide comes on the CD−ROM. It contains step−by−step instructions and the latest release notes.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.3.2 Installing a Debian Package  Debian makes the software programs available in `.deb'packages, files that contain everything necessary for the installation of a given software program.   A. Administrative Issues   443   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   There are different methods of installing packages on a Debian system: via dselect, where you select packages from a menu; dpkg, a command−line tool for installing packages; and apt−get, part of Debian's new "Advanced Package Tool" system.  To install a package when you know the package name, mount your Debian distribution  for example, if you install Debian via CD−ROM, put the first Debian CD−ROM disc in your CD−ROM drive . Then run apt−get with the `install' command option, and give the name of the package to install as an argument. Should there be additional packages that must be installed first  called dependencies , or should the package conflict with others already installed, an action will be presented to fix this, and you will be prompted to confirm or abort the operation.    To install the `miscfiles' package, type:   apt−get install miscfiles RET        If you already have the `.deb' file, use dpkg to install it. Use the `−i' option and give the name of the file as an option. Any conflicts or dependencies will have to be resolved by you before the package is installed. If a problem is detected, dpkg will report it and exit without installing the package.    To install the package in the `miscfiles−1.1.7.deb' file, type:   dpkg −i miscfiles−1.1.7.deb RET  Finally, to peruse available packages and choose them from a menu, use dselect, the Debian package selection tool. A word of caution: its menu interface is different from most programs you have probably encountered, and its usage is unfortunately an acquired skill. Even the man page makes note of this: "The dselect package selection interface is confusing or even alarming to the new user."  NOTE: If you're new to Debian, I recommend consulting Dselect Documentation for Beginners.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.3.3 Upgrading a Debian Package  People are constantly contributing to the free software movement. This means that new software programs are constantly being added to Linux distributions, and current software programs are continually being improved−−new features to match new hardware, faster program execution, security updates, and so forth. A Linux system, therefore, needs to be kept up to date in order to reap the benefits of the latest free software.  To upgrade a single package, use apt−get with the `install' argument, and follow that with the name of the package to upgrade.    To upgrade the `sview' package, type:   A. Administrative Issues   444   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:      apt−get install sview RET  This command will upgrade the `sview' package to the most current version available, if greater than the version already installed on your system. If additional packages must be upgraded first in order for this new package upgrade to function properly, this command will fetch and upgrade those packages, too. Before downloading any packages, apt−get will show the list of packages that will be installed, replaced, or otherwise changed, and wait for confirmation first.  To bring your entire Debian system up to date, use the apt−get tool with the following command arguments. First, use the `update' argument to update your system's list of available software packages. Then run apt−get again, using either the `upgrade' argument to upgrade all of the installed packages to their most recently available versions, or use the `dist−upgrade' argument when a new version of the Debian system is announced, to upgrade to that new version.    To upgrade all of the software on your system to their most recent versions, type:    To upgrade your Debian system to the most recent release, type:   apt−get update RET ...processing messages...  apt−get upgrade RET ...processing messages...          apt−get update RET ...processing messages...  apt−get dist−upgrade RET ...processing messages...   [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.3.4 Installing a Shell Script  A shell script is a file that contains commands written in a shell command language  see section The Shell . You run  or "execute"  a script as you would any other command  see section Running a Command . First, make sure that the script file is executable; if it isn't, you won't be able to execute it  see section Making a File Executable .  Generally, the administrator installs new shell scripts in the ` usr local bin' directory. If you are on a multi−user system and you are the only user liable to run a particular script, you can put it in a special directory in your home directory tree−−the `~ bin' directory is the standard recommendation here−−and then add that directory to your path  see section Adding to Your Path .  Not all executable script files are shell scripts. The first line of a script contains the full path name of the shell or other program that is to interpret and execute the script; sometimes, the path may differ on your system   A. Administrative Issues   445         The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   from the one the script was written on, and so you may have to change this line.  For example, a script may start with the following line:  ! usr local bin perl  This line means that the script is written in the perl language; the text after the `!' is the full path name of the perl program, which in this case is ` usr local bin perl'.  If you try to execute this script and the system reports an error finding the file, you'll have to change that first line to correspond to the location of the perl binary on your system. The which tool will output this location.    To find out where perl is installed on your system, type:     $ which perl RET  If that command returns ` usr bin perl' or some path name other than  usr local bin perl, you'll have to change the location in the first line of the script to the path name given:  ! usr bin perl  NOTE: If the output of the which command returns nothing, that means that the perl program is not installed on your system at all; in that case, you should install the perl software.

It takes as an argument the username to use for the new account. It will prompt for default setup information, including the user's full name and an initial password to use.    To create a new user with a username of bucky, type:   adduser bucky RET  NOTE: By default, the name of the user's home directory will be the same as the username. So, for example, the user bucky will have a home directory of ` home bucky'.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.4.2 Letting Users Access Hardware Peripherals  Certain hardware peripherals, like CD−ROM drives and soundcards, normally require superuser privileges in order to access them. These devices also have groups of their own, so a regular user can also access them by having membership to their groups  see section Groups and How to Work in Them .  The groups that regular users might want to be part of include floppy  the floppy disk drive , audio  the soundcard , and dialout and dip  modem dial−out privileges .  Use addgroup to add a user to the group associated with a hardware device. Give as arguments the username to add and the name of the group to add to.    To add the user doug to the audio group, type:   addgroup doug audio RET        [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.4.3 Letting Users Mount Drives  The ` etc fstab' file specifies the details about the filesystems in use on a system, including those that may be mounted by floppy or CD−ROM drive. In order to let users mount disks on these drives, make sure   A. Administrative Issues   447   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   that there is a line in ` etc fstab' for both the floppy and CD−ROM drives, each containing the `user' flag:      dev fd0       floppy    auto    defaults,noauto,user    0       0  dev cdrom     cdrom     auto    defaults,noauto,user    0       0  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.5 Displaying Information about the System  The following recipes describe ways of displaying information about the system you are running.  A.5.1 How Long Has the System Been Up? A.5.2 What Version of Linux Am I Running? A.5.3 What Version of Debian Am I Running?     How long has the system been up?

To find out how long the system has been running, use the uptime tool. When you run it as a command, it outputs the current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are logged on, and what the system "load averages" have been for the past one, five, and fifteen minutes.    To find out how long the system has been up, type:  $ uptime RET 3:34pm  up  4:31,  4 users,  load average: 0.01, 0.05, 0.07 $  To get a list of the times and dates when the system was recently rebooted, give `reboot' as an argument to last  see section Listing the Last Times a User Logged In .    To output a list of times when the system was rebooted, type:  $ last reboot RET         A. Administrative Issues   448   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   NOTE: An operating system capable of running constantly for a long time without crashes or freeze−ups is a good one, and so having a high uptime value is a matter of pride for many Linux users. It is not uncommon to hear of systems that have been running for months and sometimes even years non−stop−−one Linux administrator reported on the Internet about one of his work systems, which had been running continuously without reboot for three years!  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A.5.2 What Version of Linux Am I Running?  Use the GNU uname tool to see what version of Linux you are running. By default, it outputs the name of the operating system; the `−r' option outputs the operating system release number.                To output the name of the operating system, type:    To output the release number of the operating system, type:  $ uname RET  $ uname −r RET  You can also use uname to output the CPU processor type of the system  such as i586, PowerPC, etc. ; specify this with the `−m' option. The `−a' option is also useful; it outputs all information about the system that it can, including all of the mentioned options, plus the version date and number of the operating system and the machine's hostname.    To output the CPU processor type of the system, type:    To output all of the uname information for the system you are on, type:  $ uname −m RET  $ uname −a RET  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   A. Administrative Issues   449   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    A.5.3 What Version of Debian Am I Running?  On a Debian system, the file ` etc debian_version'  see section Files and Directories  contains the release name of the Debian installed.  Use cat to output the contents of this file  see section Concatenating Text .    To output the release name of the Debian system you are on, type:     $ cat  etc debian_version RET  NOTE: Debian releases have historically been named after characters from the motion picture Toy Story.

The GNU Project Web site lists new software packages as they become part of the GNU Project. This site is also the home of the Free Software Foundation, and is a source for both philosophical readings and news about the free software movement. In addition to the latest in Linux news, linux.com provides feature stories, links, and a database of Linux User Groups. The Linux Documentation Project manages the creation and upkeep of Linux HOWTOs and other documentation. The Linux Gazette is a monthly webzine devoted to "making Linux just a little more fun," and it has been published by SSC for years. Its "More 2−Cent Tips" column is famous.  Linux Weekly News contains great coverage for Linux and related free software. This site hosts the Linux FAQ. SAL  "Scientific Applications on Linux"  is the authoritative listing of scientific software that runs on Linux−based systems. Slashdot is a popular news and discussion site for members of the Linux and free software community; many people usually check Slashdot several times daily. Sourceforge is the Internet's largest community for developers of free software; it gives free resources to developers of free software. Tracks free software that is innovative−−−not just the latest free clone of some old proprietary application that wasn't all that interesting to begin with.

License  Like much of the software that makes a working Linux system, including the Linux kernel itself, the text of this book is copylefted. That is, its copyright holder published it in its source form with a special kind of copyright license that has come to be known as a "copyleft" license. That does not mean that it has been put in the public domain; rather, the copyleft is a special set of terms and conditions, given by the copyright holder, that permit anyone to copy, distribute, and modify the work while all subsequent copies and derivatives retain equally open and free to anyone else. For this book those terms are described by the Design Science License, which follows.  C.1 Design Science License C.2 Applying Copyleft to Your Work    Applying copyleft to your work.     The Design Science License.  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   C.1 Design Science License  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION  Copyright  C  1999−−2001 Michael Stutz    Verbatim copying of this document is permitted, in any medium.  0. PREAMBLE.  Copyright law gives certain exclusive rights to the author of a work, including the rights to copy, modify, and distribute the work  the "reproductive," "adaptative," and "distribution" rights .  The idea of "copyleft" is to willfully revoke the exclusivity of those rights under certain terms and conditions, so that anyone can copy and distribute the work or properly attributed derivative works, while all copies remain under the same terms and conditions as the original.  The intent of this license is to be a general "copyleft" that can be applied to any kind of work that has protection under copyright. This license states those certain conditions under which a work published under its terms may be copied, distributed and modified.  Whereas "design science" is a strategy for the development of artifacts as a way to reform the environment  not people  and subsequently improve the universal standard of living, this Design Science License was written and deployed as a strategy for promoting the progress of science and art through reform of the environment.  1. DEFINITIONS.   C. License   453   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   "License" shall mean this Design Science License. The License applies to any work which contains a notice placed by the work's copyright holder stating that it is published under the terms of this Design Science License.  "Work" shall mean such an aforementioned work. The License also applies to the output of the Work, only if said output constitutes a "derivative work" of the licensed Work as defined by copyright law.  "Object Form" shall mean an executable or performable form of the Work, being an embodiment of the Work in some tangible medium.  "Source Data" shall mean the origin of the Object Form, being the entire, machine−readable, preferred form of the Work for copying and for human modification  usually the language, encoding or format in which composed or recorded by the Author ; plus any accompanying files, scripts or other data necessary for installation, configuration or compilation of the Work.   Examples of "Source Data" include, but are not limited to, the following: if the Work is an image file composed and edited in PNG format, then the original PNG source file is the Source Data; if the Work is an MPEG 1.0 layer 3 digital audio recording made from a WAV format audio file recording of an analog source, then the original WAV file is the Source Data; if the Work was composed as an unformatted plaintext file, then that file is the Source Data; if the Work was composed in LaTeX, the LaTeX file s  and any image files and or custom macros necessary for compilation constitute the Source Data.   "Author" shall mean the copyright holder s  of the Work.  The individual licensees are referred to as "you."  2. RIGHTS AND COPYRIGHT.  The Work is copyright the Author.

License   454   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:    b  A written offer is included with the distribution, valid for at least three years or for as long as the distribution is in print  whichever is longer , with a publicly−accessible address  such as a URL on the Internet  where, for a charge not greater than transportation and media costs, anyone may receive a copy of the Source Data of the Work distributed according to the section above; or   c  A third party's written offer for obtaining the Source Data at no cost, as described in paragraph  b  above, is included with the distribution. This option is valid only if you are a non−commercial party, and only if you received the Object Form of the Work along with such an offer.  You may copy and distribute the Work either gratis or for a fee, and if desired, you may offer warranty protection for the Work.  The aggregation of the Work with other works that are not based on the Work−−such as but not limited to inclusion in a publication, broadcast, compilation, or other media−−does not bring the other works in the scope of the License; nor does such aggregation void the terms of the License for the Work.  4.

The copying, distribution or modification of the Work outside of the terms described in this License is expressly prohibited by law.  If for any reason, conditions are imposed on you that forbid you to fulfill the conditions of this License, you may not copy, distribute or modify the Work at all.  If any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.  7.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES  INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION  HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT  INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE  ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS WORK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS  [   ]    [  > ]             [Top] [Contents] [Index] [ ? ]   C.2 Applying Copyleft to Your Work  The underlying idea of free software is to help create a society where people are free, where we have freedom, and where we can share our work with others; but software is just one part of the digital information we work with and share in our lives.  The Design Science License is a generalized "copyleft" license that can be applied to any kind of work that is recognized by copyright law. You can use it to copyleft  make "Open Source"  any kind of work, not just a computer software program.  In order to copyleft a work, it must exist in machine−readable form  where identical copies can be made without harm to the original , and you must be its copyright holder. If you are the author of a work, then you automatically hold its copyright; you don't need to register your work with the copyright office.  To apply the DSL to your work, do the following:    Use the following text for the work's copyright notice, substituting Year and Author for their appropriate values:     Copyright  C  Year Your Name; this information may be copied, distributed or modified under certain terms and conditions, but it comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; see the Design Science License for more details.    Include a copy of the DSL with the distribution of the work.    Include the source data of the work  see the license text itself for the precise definition  with the   C. License   456   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   distribution, or make it available through postal mail for a cost not greater than storage media and postage.  In many cases, the source data and the object form of a work will be the same−−this is the case for software programs written in the Perl language, for example. But often, the source data will differ from a given object form. For example, when the object form is an MP3 format file made from a WAV format sample of an analog source, the WAV sample is the source data. For a cropped and manipulated JPEG file of a photograph obtained from a Kodak PhotoCD, the original PhotoCD file is the source data.  By copylefting your work in this manner, you can make it available for the benefit of everyone−−all copies and modifications of your work remain as equally free as the original−−while attribution and artistic integrity is guaranteed.  If you are interested in applying copyleft to your works, you might be interested in the following sites:    "Copyleft and the Information Renaissance", a general copyleft primer and collection of resources, written and maintained by the author.    Free Music Philosophy, on the free music movement, by Dr. Ram Samudrala.    "What is Copyleft?", an explanation of copyleft as it applies to computer software programs, by the GNU Project.

This key is labelled `Enter' on some keyboards.  The name "Unix" was first written as "Unics," which stood for "Uniplex Information and Computing System."  No such "official GNU" operating system has yet been released in its entirety, but most people today consider Linux−based free software systems to be the effective realization of their goals−−hence the "GNU" in "Debian GNU Linux."  You can extend this "free software movement" to be part of a greater "free information" or "free speech" movement, to include all other kinds of free works−−including works of literature and music.  Presumably, many of these courses use Linux now.  This was not the original name, however. Torvalds had originally called it freax, for "`free' + `freak' + the obligatory `−x'"; while the 1990s were fast becoming the "freaky" alterna decade  at least in fashion , more people seemed to favor "Linux," and the name stuck.  The GNU Project's own kernel is called Hurd, and is still in development; Debian's experimental distribution of a Hurd−based free software system, not yet publicly released, is called Debian GNU Hurd.

Buckminster Fuller, who invented a new mathematical system based on these same principles.  If you keyboard has two ALT and CTRL keys, use the left set of these keys.  LDP documents are available in other formats as well, including HTML and DVI.  The Unix way of saying it is that the command "rings the system bell."  Sometimes you might see it referred to as "X Windows," but this term is incorrect.  If you have a mouse with only two buttons, click both buttons simultaneously to emulate the middle button.  Technically, there are other characters that you can use−−but doing so may get you into trouble later on.  Called a URN, or "Uniform Resource Name."  This key works in X as well, and works as it does in the console.  On an increasing number of systems, this file is being replaced with ` usr share dict words'; administrators should make a symbolic link from this to the shorter, preferred form.  Footnotes  506   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   If a word is reasonably universal, you may, of course, contact the global maintainers of wenglish or other appropriate packages and try to convince them that said word ought to be included.  There was also a set of tools for formatting text called the "Documenter's Workbench"  DWB , and there was a planned "Reader's Workbench"; we can only guess at what that might have been, but today we do have Project Gutenbook, a new etext reader.  In The Third Mind, by William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin.  The ed command is still available on virtually all unices, Linux inclusive, and the old `g re p' still works.  The default shell on most Linux systems, bash, doesn't−−but it's still probably good practice to quote a regexp with a caret in it.  If the input is a file, use cat to do this, as in the example.  This is the term given to the currently−fashionable hardware devices that allow for display and reading of text. A book in plain text with or without formatting commands is called an "etext," but as more information is handled in machine−readable form, the e− prefix will probably be dropped.  The `mf' also stands for "Metafont," the name of the font language that is part of TeX.  LyX, being in essence a graphical front−end to LaTeX, uses these same document classes.   19    20    21    22    23    24    25    26    27   Footnotes  507   The Linux Cookbook: Tips and Techniques for Everyday Use:   In addition, a more advanced LaTeX style for printing many different kinds of shipping and package labels is normally installed at ` usr share texmf tex latex labels '.  The manuscript template requires that your system has the LaTeX style file called `manuscript.sty'; most TeX distributions have this installed at ` usr share texmf tex latex misc manuscript.sty'.  This is a proprietary scanned image format from Kodak, which is a current standard for scanning film images to digital.  You can also use this tool with a CD−RW drive and write to a CD−RW disc.  Ogg Vorbis is one such format; see http:  www.vorbis.com .  This works if your administrator has set up the floppy drive filesystem for user access−−see Letting Users Access Hardware Peripherals.  This is sometimes called being "under the mount point" of the disk.  This works if your administrator has set up the CD−ROM drive filesystem for user access−−see Letting Users Access Hardware Peripherals.

Noah Friedman has an alternate set of "Spam" images you can use, available from http:  www.splode.com ~friedman software packages index.html.  It comes pre−installed with XEmacs.  Netscape's browsers, from their earliest Navigator release to their later Communicator series, were always referred to by the company as Mozilla; this was a pun on the name Mosaic, which had been the first popular graphical Web browser in the early 1990s−−Netscape's goal had been to make a monster Mosaic.  A trimmed−down Mozilla will soon be available for Debian systems.  Like many of my generation, it was through lynx that I had my first view of the Web.  "I named it after the sound that a sonar makes, inspired by the whole principle of echo−location," said the original author of ping, Mike Muss. He died in an automobile accident in November 2000.
