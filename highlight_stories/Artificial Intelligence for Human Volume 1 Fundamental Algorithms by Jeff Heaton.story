SH   Introduction 	  Series	Introduction Computer	Languages Prerequisite	Knowledge Fundamental	Algorithms Other	Resources Structure	of	this	Book  This	 is	 the	 first	 in	 a	 series	 of	 books	 covering	 select	 topics	 in	 Artificial Intelligence	 AI .	Artificial	Intelligence	is	a	large	field	that	encompasses	many sub-disciplines.	 The	 following	 sections	 introduce	 both	 the	 series	 and	 the	 first volume.  SH   Series	Introduction  This	series	of	books	introduces	the	reader	to	a	variety	of	popular	topics	in Artificial	 Intelligence.	 By	 no	 means	 is	 this	 meant	 to	 be	 an	 exhaustive	 AI resource—AI	is	a	huge	field,	and	a	great	deal	of	information	is	added	on	a	daily basis.	Each	book	focuses	on	a	specific	area	of	AI.  The	 series	 teaches	 Artificial	 Intelligence	 concepts	 in	 a	 mathematically gentle	 manner,	 which	 is	 why	 the	 series	 is	 named	 Artificial	 Intelligence	 for Humans.	Still: 	  I	assume	the	reader	is	proficient	in	at	least	one	programming	language. I	assume	the	reader	has	a	basic	understanding	of	college	algebra. I	 use	 topics	 and	 formulas	 from	 calculus,	 linear	 algebra,	 differential equations,	and	statistics. However,	 when	 explaining	 topics	 in	 bullet	 point	 3,	 I	 do	 not	 assume	 the reader	is	fluent	in	the	topics	described	in	the	above	bullet. I	 always	 follow	 concepts	 with	 real-world	 programming	 examples	 and pseudo	code,	rather	than	relying	solely	on	mathematical	formulas.  The	 target	 audience	 for	 this	 book	 comprises	 programmers	 who	 are proficient	in	at	least	one	programming	language.	The	book’s	examples	have	been ported	to	a	number	of	programming	languages.  Programming	Languages  The	 actual	 book	 text	 stays	 at	 the	 pseudo	 code	 level.	 Example	 packs	 are provided	 for	 Java,	 C,	 R,	 C C++,	 and	 Python.	 There	 is	 also	 a	 community supplied	port	for	the	Scala	programming	language.	Members	of	the	community are	 working	 on	 porting	 the	 examples	 to	 additional	 languages,	 so	 your	 favorite language	might	have	been	ported	since	this	printing.	Check	the	book’s	GitHub repository	for	more	information.	The	community	is	encouraged	to	help	port	to other	languages!	If	you	would	like	to	get	involved,	your	help	would	be	greatly appreciated.	Appendix	A	has	more	information	to	get	you	started.  SH   Online	Labs  Many	 of	 the	 examples	 from	 this	 series	 are	 available	 to	 run	 online,	 using HTML5.	 These	 examples	 use	 JavaScript	 and	 should	 run	 from	 mobile	 devices that	are	capable	of	HTML5.  All	online	lab	materials	can	be	found	at	the	following	web	site:  These	 online	 labs	 allow	 you	 to	 try	 out	 examples	 even	 when	 reading	 an  http:  www.aifh.org  ebook	from	a	mobile	device.

Books	Planned	for	the	Series  The	following	volumes	are	planned	for	this	series:  	  Volume	0:	Introduction	to	the	Math	of	AI Volume	1:	Fundamental	Algorithms Volume	2:	Nature	Inspired	Algorithms Volume	3:	Neural	Networks Volume	4:	Support	Vector	Machines Volume	5:	Probabilistic	Learning  Volumes	 one	 through	 five	 will	 be	 produced	 in	 order.	 Volume	 zero	 is	 a  SH   “planned	prequel”	that	will	be	produced	near	the	end	of	the	series	to	focus	on	the mathematical	 concepts	 introduced	 in	 the	 other	 volumes.	 Volumes	 one	 through five	will	cover	required	mathematical	concepts,	while	volume	zero	is	planned	to be	a	recap	and	expansion	of	the	mathematical	concepts	from	the	other	volumes. Volume	zero	 can	be	 read	at	 either	 the	beginning	 or	the	 end	of	 the	 series. Volume	one	should	generally	be	read	before	the	other	volumes.	Volume	two	does contain	some	information	useful	for	volume	three.	Figure	1	shows	the	suggested reading	order.  Figure	1:	Reading	the	Volumes  Each	 volume	 can	 be	 read	 separately	 or	 as	 part	 of	 the	 series.	 Volume	 one lays	 down	 foundational	 algorithms	 that	 are	 used	 in	 each	 of	 the	 subsequent volumes.	The	algorithms	of	volume	one	are	both	foundational	and	useful	in	their own	right.  Other	Resources  There	are	many	other	resources	on	the	Internet	that	will	be	very	useful	to  you	as	you	read	through	this	series	of	books.  SH   The	 first	 is	 the	 Khan	 Academy,	 which	 is	 a	 collection	 of	 YouTube	 videos that	demonstrate	many	areas	of	mathematics.	If	you	need	additional	review	on any	mathematical	concept	in	this	book,	there	is	most	likely	a	video	on	the	Khan Academy	that	covers	it. http:  www.khanacademy.org   Second	is	the	Neural	Network	FAQ.	This	text-only	resource	has	a	great	deal  of	information	on	neural	networks	and	other	AI	topics. http:  www.faqs.org faqs ai-faq neural-nets   The	 Encog	 wiki	 has	 a	 fair	 amount	 of	 general	 information	 on	 machine  learning,	although	the	information	found	here	is	not	necessarily	tied	to	Encog. http:  www.heatonresearch.com wiki Main_Page  Finally,	 AI	 and	 neural	 networks	 can	 be	 discussed	 on	 the	 Encog	 forums. These	forums	are	fairly	active	and	you	are	very	likely	to	receive	an	answer	from myself	or	from	one	of	the	community	members	at	the	forum. http:  www.heatonresearch.com forum  SH   Fundamental	Algorithms	Introduction  To	 have	 a	 great	 building,	 you	 must	 have	 a	 great	 foundation.	 This	 book teaches	 Artificial	 Intelligence	 algorithms	 such	 as	 dimensionality,	 distance metrics,	clustering,	error	calculation,	hill	climbing,	linear	regression	and	discrete learning.	These	algorithms	allow	for	the	processing	and	recognition	of	patterns in	data.	This	is	how	sites	such	as	Amazon	and	NetFlix	suggest	products	to	you.  These	are	not	just	foundational	algorithms	for	the	rest	of	the	series,	but	are very	 useful	 algorithms	 in	 their	 own	 right.	 All	 algorithms	 are	 explained	 with numeric	calculations	that	you	can	perform	yourself.  SH   Structure	of	this	Book  Chapter	one,	“Introduction	to	AI,”	introduces	some	of	the	basic	concepts	of AI.	These	concepts	are	built	upon	both	by	this	volume	and	the	series.	You	will see	 that	 most	 AI	 algorithms	 accept	 an	 input	 array	 of	 numbers	 and	 produce	 an output	 array.	 Problems	 to	 be	 solved	 by	 AI	 are	 often	 modeled	 to	 this	 form. Internally,	the	algorithm	keeps	additional	arrays	that	effectively	represent	long and	short-term	memory.	These	algorithms	are	trained	by	adjusting	the	long-term memory	to	produce	a	desirable	output	for	a	given	input.  Chapter	 two,	 “Normalizing	 Data,”	 shows	 how	 raw	 data	 is	 typically prepared	for	many	AI	algorithms.	Data	is	presented	to	an	algorithm	in	the	form of	an	input	array.	Not	all	data	is	numeric	and	some	is	categorical.	Examples	of categorical	data	include	color,	shape,	gender,	species,	and	any	other	non-numeric descriptive	quality.	Numeric	data	must	often	be	normalized	to	a	specific	range. Numeric	qualities	are	often	normalized	to	a	range	between	-1	and	1.  Chapter	 three,	 “Distance	 Metrics,”	 shows	 how	 data	 can	 be	 compared	 in much	the	same	way	as	we	plot	a	distance	between	two	points	on	a	map.	AI	often works	with	numeric	arrays.	These	arrays	hold	input	data,	output	data,	long-term memory,	 short-term	 memory,	 and	 other	 information.	 These	 arrays	 are	 often called	vectors.	We	can	calculate	the	distances	between	these	data	points	in	much the	same	way	as	we	calculate	the	distance	between	two	points.	Two-dimensional and	 three-dimensional	 points	 can	 be	 thought	 of	 as	 vectors	 of	 length	 two	 and three,	 respectively.	 In	 AI,	 we	 often	 deal	 with	 spaces	 of	 much	 higher dimensionality	than	three.  Chapter	 four,	 “Random	 Numbers,”	 shows	 how	 random	 numbers	 are calculated	 and	 used	 by	 AI	 algorithms.	 This	 chapter	 begins	 by	 discussing	 the difference	 between	 uniform	 and	 normal	 random	 numbers.	 Sometimes	 AI algorithms	call	for	each	random	number	to	have	an	equal	probability.	At	other times,	 random	 numbers	 must	 follow	 a	 distribution.	 The	 chapter	 additionally discusses	techniques	for	random	number	generation.  Chapter	five,	“K-Means	Clustering,”	shows	how	data	can	be	grouped	into similar	clusters.	K-Means	is	an	algorithm	can	be	used	by	itself	to	group	data	into groups	by	commonality.	Additionally,	K-Means	is	often	used	as	a	component	to other	more	complex	algorithms.	Genetic	algorithms	often	use	K-Means	to	group  SH   populations	 into	 species	 with	 similar	 traits,	 while	 online	 retailers	 often	 use clustering	 algorithms	 to	 break	 customers	 into	 clusters.	 Sales	 suggestions	 can then	be	created	based	on	the	buying	habits	of	members	of	the	same	cluster.  Chapter	 six,	 “Error	 Calculation,”	 shows	 how	 the	 results	 of	 AI	 algorithms can	be	evaluated.	Error	calculation	is	how	we	determine	the	effectiveness	of	an algorithm,	 which	 can	 be	 done	 using	 a	 scoring	 function	 that	 evaluates	 the effectiveness	 of	 a	 trained	 algorithm.	 A	 very	 common	 type	 of	 scoring	 function simply	contains	input	vectors	and	expected	output	vectors.	This	is	called	training data.	The	algorithm	is	rated	based	on	the	distance	between	the	algorithm’s	actual output	and	the	expected	output.  Chapter	seven,	“Towards	Machine	Learning,”	introduces	simple	algorithms that	 can	 be	 trained	 to	 analyze	 data	 and	 produce	 better	 results.	 Most	 AI algorithms	use	a	vector	of	weighted	values	to	transform	the	input	vector	into	a desired	output	vector.	This	vector	of	weighted	values	forms	a	sort	of	long-term memory	for	the	algorithm.	Training	is	the	process	of	adjusting	this	memory	to produce	the	desired	output.	This	chapter	shows	how	to	construct	several	simple models	 that	 can	 be	 trained	 and	 introduces	 relatively	 simple,	 yet	 effective, training	algorithms	that	can	adjust	this	memory	to	provide	better	output	values. Simple	 random	 walks	 and	 hill	 climbing	 are	 two	 such	 means	 for	 setting	 these weights.  Chapter	 eight,	 “Optimization	 Algorithms,”	 expands	  the	 algorithms introduced	in	the	previous	chapter.	These	algorithms,	which	include	Simulated Annealing	and	Nelder	Mead,	can	be	used	to	quickly	optimize	the	weights	of	an AI	 model.	 This	 chapter	 shows	 how	 to	 adapt	 these	 optimization	 algorithms	 to some	of	the	models	introduced	in	the	previous	chapter.  Chapter	nine,	“Discrete	Optimization,”	shows	how	to	optimize	data	that	is categorical	rather	than	numeric.	Not	every	optimization	problem	is	numeric,	as we	see	in	the	cases	of	discrete,	or	categorical,	problems	such	as	the	Knapsack Problem	 and	 the	 Traveling	 Salesman	 Problem.	 This	 chapter	 shows	 that Simulated	Annealing	can	be	adapted	to	either	of	these	two	problems.	Simulated annealing	can	be	used	for	continuous	numeric	problems	and	discrete	categorical problems.  Chapter	 ten,	 “Linear	 Regression,”	 shows	 how	 linear	 and	 non-linear equations	 can	 be	 used	 to	 learn	 trends	 and	 make	 predictions.	 The	 chapter introduces	simple	linear	regression	and	shows	how	to	use	it	to	fit	data	to	a	linear model.	This	chapter	will	also	introduce	the	General	Linear	Model	 GLM ,	which can	be	used	to	fit	non-linear	data.  SH   The	Kickstarter	Campaign  This	 series	 of	 books	 was	 launched	 in	 2013	 as	 the	 result	 of	 a	 successful Kickstarter	 campaign.	 The	 home	 page	 for	 the	 Kickstarter	 project	 is	 shown	 in Figure	2.  Figure	2:	The	Kickstarter	Campaign  SH   You	can	visit	the	original	Kickstarter	at	the	following	link:  http:  goo.gl dGorA  I	would	like	to	thank	all	of	the	Kickstarter	backers	of	the	project!	Without your	 support,	 this	 series	 might	 not	 exist.	 I	 would	 also	 like	 to	 extend	 a	 special thanks	to	those	backers	who	supported	at	the	$100	and	higher	levels.	They	are listed	here,	in	order	that	they	pledged.  Figure	3:	Kickstarter	100	Dollar	Level	Supporters  Also	a	big	thanks	to	Rick	Cardarelle!	His	pledge	of	$358	pushed	the	project to	the	$2,500	minimum	requested	amount.	A	very	big	thank	you	to	Rory	Graves and	Matic	Potocnik	porting	the	examples	to	Scala.  Thank	you	everyone—you	are	the	best!  SH   Chapter	1:	Introduction	to	AI 	  Relationship	to	Human	Brains Modeling	Input	and	Output Classification	and	Regression Time	Series Training  Most	 laypeople	 think	 of	 Artificial	 Intelligence	  AI 	 as	 a	 sort	 of	 artificial brain	and	recall	images	from	science	fiction	movies	about	robots.	Such	images have	very	little	to	do	with	how	AI	is	actually	used	in	today’s	world.	It	is	true	that AI	has	many	similarities	to	human	brain	function,	but	the	significant	distinction is	 that	 Artificial	 Intelligence	 is	 artificial.	 AI	 does	 not	 need	 to	 pretend	 to	 be biological.  Before	 we	 get	 too	 deep,	 I	 would	 like	 to	 introduce	 some	 very	 general concepts	about	how	you	interact	with	an	AI	algorithm.	The	AI	algorithm	is	the technique	that	you	are	using	to	solve	a	problem.	An	AI	algorithm	is	sometimes called	a	model.	There	are	many	different	AI	algorithms,	or	models.	Some	of	the most	 common	 are	 Neural	 Networks,	 Support	 Vector	 Machines,	 Bayesian networks,	 and	 Hidden	 Markov	 Models.	 This	 series	 of	 books	 covers	 many	 of these	models.  It	 is	 important	 for	 the	 AI	 practitioner	 understand	 how	 to	 represent	 a problem	to	an	AI	program,	as	this	is	the	primary	mode	of	interaction	with	an	AI algorithm.	We	will	begin	our	foundation	of	knowledge	in	this	topic	by	exploring how	the	human	brain	interacts	with	its	world.  SH   Relationship	to	Human	Brains  The	 purpose	 of	 AI	 is	 to	 allow	 a	 computer	 to	 function	 somewhat	 like	 a human	brain.	However,	this	does	not	mean	that	AI	seeks	to	emulate	every	aspect of	 the	 human	 brain.	 The	 degree	 to	 which	 an	 AI	 algorithm	 matches	 the	 actual functioning	of	the	human	brain	is	called	biological	plausibility.  Christof	 Koch,	 chief	 scientific	 officer	 of	 the	 Allen	 Institute	 for	 Brain Science,	 calls	 the	 brain	 “the	 most	 complex	 object	 in	 the	 known	 universe.”  Koch,	2013 	In	the	context	of	AI,	the	brain	is	essentially	an	advanced	piece	of technology	that	we	must	study,	reverse	engineer,	and	learn	to	emulate.  The	 brain	 is	 not	 the	 only	 piece	 of	 “advanced	 technology”	 that	 nature	 has shared	 with	 us.	 Flight	 is	 another.	 Early	 airplanes	 attempted	 to	 emulate	 the flapping	 wings	 of	 birds.	 Such	 airships	 are	 called	 ornithopters.	 These	 flapping airships	did	not	work	very	well,	however.	Figure	1.1	shows	a	patent	diagram	for the	Gray	Goose	Ornithopter.  Figure	1.1:	Gray	Goose	Ornithopter	 US	patent	1,730,758   SH   SH   Biological	 birds	 were	 the	 only	 models	 for	 flying	 machines	 in	 existence through	 the	 early	 1900s.	 It	 seemed	 logical	 to	 emulate	 birds,	 as	 they	 were excellent	 flyers.	 However,	 from	 experimenting	 with	 flying	 machines,	 humans have	learned	not	to	follow	the	path	of	nature	too	closely.	While	we	wanted	to emulate	the	end	goal	of	flying,	emulating	exactly	how	natural	bird	flight	occurs did	not	result	in	an	effective	flying	machine.  The	abstraction	of	emulation	occurs	in	many	other	contexts.	My	MacBook Pro	can	emulate	a	Windows	PC,	and	can	also	emulate	a	Commodore	64.	A	C64 is	somewhat	different	from	my	more	modern	laptop,	in	more	than	just	looks.	The instruction	set	that	drives	a	C64	is	quite	different	from	the	Intel	x86	instruction set	common	on	many	modern	computers.	When	my	Mac	emulates	a	C64,	it	does not	 emulate	 the	 actual	 transistors	 that	 make	 up	 a	 C64’s	 6510	 microprocessor. The	emulation	occurs	at	a	higher	level.	This	is	the	same	in	AI.	Some	algorithms emulate	neurons,	while	some,	like	my	C64	emulator,	operate	at	a	higher	level. We	focus	on	the	end	goal	of	providing	functionality	in	a	PC	context,	rather	than directly	emulating	all	the	processes	that	lead	to	functionality	in	a	brain.  What	you	want	to	do	is	more	important	than	how.	At	the	highest	level,	there are	similarities	between	a	human	brain	and	most	AI	algorithms.	The	next	section will	examine	these.  The	Brain	and	Its	World  Before	we	begin,	let’s	look	at	how	the	human	brain	works	on	an	external level.	While	we	know	relatively	little	about	the	internal	operation	of	the	brain, we	do	know	a	fair	amount	about	the	external	operation	of	the	brain.  The	 brain	 is	 essentially	 a	 black	 box	 connected	 by	 nerves.	 These	 nerves carry	 signals	 between	 the	 brain	 and	 the	 body.	 A	 certain	 set	 of	 inputs	 causes	 a certain	output.	For	example,	feeling	your	finger	about	to	touch	a	hot	stove	will result	 in	 other	 nerves	 sending	 commands	 to	 your	 muscles	 to	 pull	 your	 finger back.  It	is	also	very	important	to	note	that	the	brain	has	an	internal	state.	Consider if	you	suddenly	heard	a	horn.	How	you	react	is	determined	not	just	by	the	stimuli of	the	horn,	but	where	you	are	when	you	hear	the	horn.	Hearing	a	horn	in	the middle	of	a	movie	evokes	a	very	different	response	than	hearing	a	horn	when you	are	crossing	a	busy	street.	The	knowledge	of	where	you	are	creates	a	certain internal	state	that	causes	your	brain	to	react	differently	to	different	contexts.  SH   The	order	in	which	stimuli	are	received	is	also	important.	A	common	game is	to	close	your	eyes	and	attempt	to	use	only	touch	to	determine	what	an	object is.	When	you	grab	the	object,	you	do	not	instantly	receive	enough	information	to determine	what	it	is.	Rather,	you	must	grab	the	object	and	run	your	fingers	over it.	 As	 your	 fingers	 run	 over	 the	 object,	 you	 receive	 information	 that	 forms	 an image	of	what	the	object	is.  You	can	essentially	think	of	the	human	brain	as	a	black	box	with	a	series	of inputs	and	outputs.	Our	nerves	provide	our	entire	perception	of	the	world.	The nerves	are	the	inputs	to	the	brain.	There	is	actually	a	finite	number	of	inputs	to	a typical	human	brain.  Likewise,	our	only	means	to	interact	with	the	world	are	the	outputs	from our	nerves	to	our	muscles.	The	output	from	the	human	brain	is	a	function	of	the inputs	and	internal	state	of	the	brain.	In	response	to	any	input,	the	human	brain will	alter	its	internal	state	and	produce	output.	The	significance	of	the	order	of the	inputs	is	handled	by	the	internal	state	of	the	brain.  Brain	in	a	Vat  If	 our	 only	 interaction	 with	 reality	 is	 the	 inputs	 we	 receive	 from	 sensory inputs	 and	 out	 actions	 through	 motor	 nerves,	 what	 actually	 is	 “reality”?	 Your brain	is	hooked	up	to	your	body,	but	it	could	also	be	hooked	up	to	a	simulation, as	in	the	movie,	The	Matrix.	So	long	as	the	output	from	your	brain	is	producing the	expected	inputs,	would	you	know	what	was	real	and	what	was	simulated?  This	is	a	common	philosophical	thought	experiment	called	“brain	in	a	vat.” Figure	 1.2	 illustrates	 the	 brain	 in	 a	 vat	 thought	 experiment.	 In	 the	 figure,	 the brain	believes	that	its	body	is	walking	a	dog.	But	does	the	brain	have	a	body? Does	the	dog	even	exist?	What	does	“exist”	even	mean?	All	we	really	know	is what	our	nerves	tell	us.	 Sigiel,	1999   Figure	1.2:	Brain	in	a	Vat  SH   This	experiment	assumes	that	a	person’s	brain	could	be	removed	from	the body	and	provided	life-support.	Nerves	would	be	connected	to	a	supercomputer that	 would	 provide	 electrical	 impulses	 identical	 to	 those	 the	 brain	 normally receives.	 The	 computer	 would	 then	 be	 simulating	 reality	 by	 including appropriate	 responses	 to	 the	 brain’s	 output.	 The	 disembodied	 brain	 would continue	 to	 have	 perfectly	 normal	 conscious	 experiences	 outside	 of	 the	 “real world.”	 There	 are	 even	 philosophical	 theories	 that	 suggest	 we	 are	 living	 in	 a simulation.	 Bostrom,	2003   One	 attempt	 to	 model	 an	 algorithm	 directly	 from	 the	 human	 brain	 is	 the neural	 network.	 Neural	 networks	 are	 one	 small	 part	 of	 AI	 research,	 and	 the neural	network	model	aligns	very	closely	with	many	of	the	AI	algorithms	that you	will	learn	in	this	series	of	books.  Computer	based	neural	networks	are	not	like	the	human	brain	in	that	they are	not	general-purpose	computation	devices.	Neural	networks,	as	they	currently  SH   exist,	carry	out	very	small,	specific	tasks.	An	AI	algorithm	experiences	its	reality by	 providing	 output	 based	 on	 the	 algorithm’s	 internal	 state	 and	 the	 input	 it	 is currently	receiving.	The	“reality”	that	the	algorithm	is	attached	to	may	change	as the	researcher	experiments	with	the	algorithm.  This	 model	 of	 inputs,	 outputs,	 and	 internal	 state	 holds	 true	 for	 most	 AI algorithms,	 regardless	 of	 whether	 you	 are	 creating	 AI	 for	 a	 robot	 or	 a	 stock picker.	Of	course,	some	algorithms	are	more	complex	than	others.  SH   Modeling	Problems  Knowing	 how	 to	 model	 a	 real-world	 problem	 to	 a	 machine-learning algorithm	 is	 critical.	 Different	 problems	 will	 lend	 themselves	 to	 different algorithms.	 At	 the	 highest	 level,	 you	 will	 model	 your	 problem	 in	 one	 of	 four different	ways: 	  Data	classification Regression	analysis Clustering Time	Series  Data	Classification  Sometimes	you	will	model	one	problem	using	several	of	these	approaches.  We	will	examine	each	of	these,	beginning	with	data	classification.  Classification	attempts	to	determine	the	class	in	which	the	input	data	falls into.	Classification	is	usually	a	supervised	training	operation,	which	occurs	when the	user	provides	data	and	expected	results	to	the	machine-learning	algorithm.	In data	classification,	the	expected	result	is	identification	of	the	data	class.  Supervised	 training	 always	 deals	 with	 known	 data.	 During	 training, machine-learning	algorithms	are	evaluated	according	to	how	well	they	classify known	data.	The	hope	is	that	the	algorithm,	once	trained,	will	be	able	to	classify unknown	data	as	well.  Fisher’s	 Iris	 Dataset	 is	 an	 example	 of	 classification.	  Fisher,	 1936 	 This dataset	contains	measurements	of	iris	flowers.	This	is	one	of	the	most	famous datasets	 and	 is	 often	 used	 to	 evaluate	 machine-learning	 algorithms.	 The	 full dataset	is	available	at	the	following	URL: http:  www.heatonresearch.com wiki Iris_Data_Set Below	is	a	small	sampling	from	the	iris	dataset.  "Sepal	Length","Sepal	Width","Petal	Length","Petal	Width","Species" 5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,"setosa"  SH   4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,"setosa" 4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,"setosa" ... 7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,"versicolor" 6.4,3.2,4.5,1.5,"versicolor" 6.9,3.1,4.9,1.5,"versicolor" ... 6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,"virginica" 5.8,2.7,5.1,1.9,"virginica" 7.1,3.0,5.9,2.1,"virginica"  Sepal	length Sepal	width Petal	length Petal	width Species  The	 above	 data	 are	 shown	 as	 a	 CSV	 file.	 CSV	 is	 a	 very	 common	 input format	for	machine	learning.	The	first	row	is	typically	a	definition	for	each	of the	columns	in	the	file.	As	you	can	see,	for	each	of	the	flowers	there	are	five pieces	of	information	provided: 	  For	classification,	the	algorithm	is	instructed	to	determine	the	species	of	the flower	given	the	sepal	length width	and	the	petal	length width.	The	species	is	the class.  A	class	is	usually	a	non-numeric	data	attribute	and,	as	such,	membership	in the	class	must	be	well	defined.	For	the	Iris	dataset,	there	are	three	different	types of	iris.	If	a	machine-learning	algorithm	is	trained	on	three	types	of	iris,	it	cannot be	expected	to	identify	a	rose.	All	members	of	the	class	must	be	known	at	the time	of	training.  Regression	Analysis  In	the	last	section,	we	learned	how	to	use	data	to	classify	data.	But	often	the desired	output	is	not	simply	a	class,	but	a	number.	Consider	the	calculation	of	an automobile’s	fuel	efficiency	in	miles	per	gallon	 MPG .	Provided	data	such	as the	engine	size	and	car	weight,	the	MPG	for	the	specified	car	may	be	calculated.  The	following	sample	provides	MPG	data	for	five	cars:  "mpg","cylinders","displacement","horsepower","weight","acceleration","model	year","origin","car	name"  SH   18.0,8,307.0,130.0,3504.,12.0,70,1,"chevrolet	chevelle	malibu" 15.0,8,350.0,165.0,3693.,11.5,70,1,"buick	skylark	320" 18.0,8,318.0,150.0,3436.,11.0,70,1,"plymouth	satellite" 16.0,8,304.0,150.0,3433.,12.0,70,1,"amc	rebel	sst" 17.0,8,302.0,140.0,3449.,10.5,70,1,"ford	torino" ...  The	entirety	of	this	dataset	may	be	found	at	the	link	below:	 Quinlan,	1993   http:  www.heatonresearch.com wiki MPG_Data_Set  A	regression	analysis	aims	to	train	the	algorithm	with	input	data	about	the car	to	provide	an	answer	calculated	from	input.	In	this	case,	the	algorithm	would be	asked	to	determine	the	miles	per	gallon	that	the	specified	car	would	likely	get. It	is	also	important	to	note	that	not	every	piece	of	data	in	the	above	file	will be	used.	The	columns	“car	name”	and	“origin”	are	not	used.	The	name	of	a	car has	 nothing	 to	 do	 with	 its	 fuel	 efficiency	 and	 is	 therefore	 excluded	 from	 the calculation.	Likewise,	the	origin	of	the	car	does	not	contribute	to	this	equation. Although	 the	 origin	 is	 given	 a	 numeric	 value	 that	 specifies	 what	 geographic region	 the	 car	 was	 produced	 in	 and	 some	 regions	 do	 focus	 more	 on	 fuel efficiency	than	others,	this	piece	of	data	is	far	too	broad	to	be	useful.  Clustering  Clustering	is	very	similar	to	classification	in	that	the	computer	is	required	to group	data.	Clustering	algorithms	take	input	data	and	place	it	into	clusters.	The programmer	 usually	 specifies	 the	 number	 of	 clusters	 to	 be	 created	 before training	 the	 algorithm.	 The	 computer	 places	 similar	 items	 together	 using	 the input	data.	Because	you	do	not	specify	what	cluster	you	expect	a	given	item	to fall	into,	clustering	is	useful	when	you	have	no	expected	output.	Because	there	is no	expected	output,	clustering	is	considered	unsupervised	training.  Consider	the	car	data	from	the	previous	section.	You	might	run	a	clustering algorithm	to	break	the	cars	into	four	groups.	This	would	tell	you	what	cars	are similar	to	each	other.  The	difference	between	clustering	and	classification	is	that	clustering	gives the	 algorithm	 the	 freedom	 to	 find	 order	 in	 the	 data.	 Classification	 teaches	 the algorithm	what	class	known	data	should	fit	into,	with	the	goal	of	allowing	the trained	 algorithm	 to	 eventually	 classify	 new	 data	 that	 the	 algorithm	 was	 not trained	with.  Clustering	 and	 classification	 algorithms	 handle	 new	 data	 differently.	 The  SH   entire	 purpose	 of	 classification	 is	 to	 be	 able	 to	 classify	 new	 data	 based	 on previous	data	with	which	the	algorithm	was	trained,	while	clustering	makes	no provision	for	new	data.	If	you	want	to	add	new	data	to	the	existing	groups,	you must	reclassify	the	entire	data	set.  Time	Series  Machine	learning	algorithms	work	somewhat	like	mathematical	functions. They	map	the	input	values	to	output	values.	If	there	is	no	internal	state	to	the machine-learning	algorithm,	a	given	set	of	inputs	will	always	produce	the	same outputs.	 Many	 machine-learning	 methods	 do	 not	 have	 an	 internal	 state	 that changes	and	affects	the	output.	For	example,	in	the	context	of	the	car	data,	you would	 want	 the	 classification	 algorithm’s	 decision	 to	 be	 supported	 by	 all	 the data,	rather	than	just	by	the	last	few	cars	that	it	has	seen.  Time	 series	 is	 often	 very	 important.	 Some	 machine-learning	 algorithms support	it	and	others	do	not.	If	you	are	classifying	cars	or	irises	you	most	likely do	not	care	about	time	series.	However,	if	your	only	input	is	the	current	price	of a	stock,	time	series	becomes	very	important.	A	single	price	point	for	a	stock	on	a given	 day	 does	 not	 help	 much	 for	 prediction.	 However,	 a	 trend	 considering several	days	of	stock	prices	may	be	of	use.  There	 are	 also	 methods	 to	 encode	 time	 series	 into	 algorithms	 that	 do	 not directly	support	time	series.	In	these	cases	you	make	the	previous	days	part	of the	input.	For	example,	you	may	have	five	inputs	that	represent	the	previous	five days	of	trading	from	the	day	you	wish	to	predict.  SH   Modeling	Input	and	Output  Earlier	 in	 this	 chapter	 I	 mentioned	 that	 a	 machine-learning	 algorithm	 is provided	 with	 input	 and	 produces	 output.	 This	 output	 is	 affected	 by	 the algorithm’s	 long-	 and	 short-term	 memory.	 Figure	 1.3	 shows	 how	 long-	 and short-term	memory	are	involved	in	the	output	process.  Figure	1.3:	Abstract	Machine	Learning	Algorithm  SH   SH   As	 you	 can	 see,	 the	 algorithm	 above	 accepts	 input	 and	 produces	 output. Most	 machine	 learning	 algorithms	 operate	 completely	 synchronously.	 The algorithm	 will	 only	 output	 when	 presented	 with	 input.	 It	 is	 not	 like	 a	 human brain,	which	always	responds	to	input	but	occasionally	produces	output	without input!  So	far	we	have	only	referred	to	the	input	and	output	patterns	abstractly.	You may	be	wondering	exactly	what	they	are.	The	input	and	output	patterns	are	both vectors.	 A	 vector	 is	 essentially	 an	 array	 of	 floating	 point	 numbers,	 as	 shown below:  Input:	[	-0.245,	.283,	0.0	] Output:	[	0.782,	0.543	]  Nearly	all	machine	learning	algorithms	have	a	fixed	number	of	inputs	and outputs.	 They	 work	 like	 functions	 in	 computer	 programs.	 The	 input	 can	 be thought	of	as	the	parameters	to	a	function.	The	output	is	the	return	value.	For	the above	data	an	algorithm	would	accept	three	input	values	and	return	two	output values.	 These	 counts	 do	 not	 typically	 change.	 As	 a	 result,	 the	 number	 of elements	 in	 the	 input	 and	 output	 patterns	 for	 a	 particular	 algorithm	 can	 never change.  To	 make	 use	 of	 the	 algorithm,	 you	 must	 express	 your	 problem	 in	 such	 a way	as	to	have	the	input	to	the	problem	be	an	array	of	floating	point	numbers. Likewise,	 the	 solution	 to	 the	 problem	 must	 be	 an	 array	 of	 floating	 point numbers.	This	is	really	all	that	most	algorithms	can	do	for	you.	Machine	learning algorithms	take	one	array	and	transform	it	into	a	second.  Many	 pattern	 recognition	 algorithms	 are	 something	 like	 a	 hash	 table	 in traditional	programming.	In	traditional	programming,	a	hash	table	is	used	to	map keys	to	values.	In	many	ways,	a	hash	table	is	somewhat	like	a	dictionary,	in	that it	includes	a	term	and	its	meaning.	A	hash	table	could	look	like	the	following: 	  “hear”	->	“to	perceive	or	apprehend	by	the	ear” “run”	->	“to	go	faster	than	a	walk” “write”	 ->	 “to	 form	  as	 characters	 or	 symbols 	 on	 a	 surface	 with	 an instrument	 as	a	pen ”  The	above	example	is	a	mapping	between	words	and	their	definitions.	This hash	table	uses	a	key	of	string	and	applies	it	to	another	value	of	a	string.	If	you provide	the	dictionary	with	a	key	 the	word ,	it	returns	a	value	 the	definition .  SH   This	is	how	most	machine	learning	algorithms	function.  All	program	hash	tables	use	keys	and	values.	Think	of	the	pattern	sent	to the	input	layer	of	the	algorithm	as	the	key	to	the	hash	table.	Likewise,	think	of the	 value	 returned	 from	 the	 hash	 table	 as	 the	 pattern	 that	 is	 returned	 from	 the output	 layer	 of	 the	 algorithm.	 Of	 course,	 an	 algorithm	 is	 much	 more	 than	 a simple	hash	table.  With	the	above	hash	table,	what	would	happen	if	you	were	to	pass	in	a	word that	is	not	a	key	in	the	map?	For	example,	the	key	“wrote.”	A	hash	table	would return	 null	 or	 in	 some	 way	 indicate	 that	 it	 could	 not	 find	 the	 specified	 key. Machine	learning	algorithms,	on	the	other	hand,	do	not	return	null.	They	find	the closest	match,	or	a	probability	of	a	match.	If	you	passed	“wrote”	to	the	algorithm above,	you	would	likely	get	back	what	you	would	have	expected	for	“write.”  Not	only	does	the	algorithm	find	the	closest	match,	it	will	modify	the	output to	guess	the	missing	value.	Of	course,	there	is	not	enough	data	for	the	algorithm to	 have	 modified	 the	 response	 in	 the	 example	 above,	 as	 there	 are	 only	 three samples.	When	the	data	is	limited	the	closest	match	may	not	be	very	meaningful. The	 above	 mapping	 brings	 up	 one	 very	 important	 point	 about	 these algorithms.	Given	that	algorithms	accept	an	array	of	floating	point	numbers	and return	another	array,	how	would	you	put	strings	into	the	algorithm?	There	is	a way	to	do	this,	although	it	is	much	easier	to	deal	with	numeric	data	than	strings. The	 Bag	 of	 Words	 algorithm	 is	 a	 common	 means	 of	 encoding	 strings.  Harris,	1954 	Each	input	represents	the	count	of	one	particular	word.	The	entire input	 vector	 would	 contain	 one	 value	 for	 each	 unique	 word.	 Consider	 the following	strings.  We	have	the	following	unique	words.	This	is	our	“dictionary.”  Of	Mice	and	Men Three	Blind	Mice Blind	Man's	Bluff Mice	and	More	Mice  Input	0:	and	 Input	1:	blind		 Input	2:	bluff Input	3:	man's	 Input	4:	men Input	5:	mice	 Input	6:	more	 Input	7:	of	  SH   Input	8:	three	  The	four	lines	above	would	be	encoded	as	follows.  Of	Mice	and	Men	[0	4	5	7] Three	Blind	Mice	[1	5	8] Blind	Man's	Bluff	[1	2	3] Mice	and	More	Mice	[0	5	6]	  Of	course	we	have	to	fill	in	the	missing	words	with	zero,	so	we	end	up	with  the	following.  Of	Mice	and	Men	[1,	0,	0,	0,	1,	1,	0,	1,	0] Three	Blind	Mice	[0,	1,	0,	0,	0,	1,	0,	0,	1] Blind	Man's	Bluff	[0,	1,	1,	1,	0,	0,	0,	0,	0] Mice	and	More	Mice	[1,	0,	0,	0,	0,	2,	1,	0,	0]	  Notice	that	we	now	have	a	consistent	vector	length	of	nine.	Nine	is	the	total number	of	words	in	our	“dictionary”.	Each	component	number	in	the	vector	is	an index	into	our	dictionary	of	available	words.	At	each	vector	component	is	stored a	count	of	the	number	of	words	for	that	dictionary	entry.	Each	string	will	usually contain	 only	 a	 small	 subset	 of	 the	 dictionary.	 As	 a	 result,	 most	 of	 the	 vector values	will	be	zero.  As	 you	 can	 see,	 one	 of	 the	 most	 difficult	 aspects	 of	 machine	 learning programming	 is	 translating	 your	 problem	 into	 a	 fixed-length	 array	 of	 floating point	numbers.	The	following	section	shows	how	to	translate	several	examples.  A	Simple	Example  If	you	have	read	anything	about	machine	learning,	you	have	no	doubt	seen examples	 with	 the	 XOR	 operator.	 A	 program	 learning	 the	 XOR	 operator	 is essentially	 the	 “Hello	 World”	 of	 AI.	 This	 book	 will	 describe	 scenarios	 much more	complex	than	XOR,	but	the	XOR	operator	is	a	great	introduction.	We	shall begin	by	looking	at	the	XOR	operator	as	though	it	were	a	hash	table.	If	you	are not	 familiar	 with	 the	 XOR	 operator,	 it	 works	 similarly	 to	 the	 AND	 and	 OR operators	in	that	it	considers	two	sides	and	generates	a	true	or	false	answer.	An AND	operator	is	true	when	both	sides	are	true.	Likewise	an	OR	is	true	when either	side	is	true.  For	an	XOR	to	be	true,	both	of	the	sides	must	be	different	from	each	other.  The	truth	table	for	an	XOR	is	as	follows.  SH   The	above	truth	table	would	be	represented	in	hash	table	form	as	follows:  These	 mappings	 show	 the	 input	 and	 the	 ideal	 expected	 output	 for	 the  Machine	learning	problems	usually	involve	dealing	with	a	set	of	data	and using	a	calculation	to	predict	the	output	data	or	to	determine	a	course	of	action. Consider	a	car	database	that	contains	the	following	fields: 	  False	XOR	False	=	False True	XOR	False	=	True False	XOR	True	=	True True	XOR	True	=	False  [	0.0	,	0.0	]	->	[	0.0	] [	1.0	,	0.0	]	->	[	1.0	] [	0.0	,	1.0	]	->	[	1.0	] [	1.0	,	1.0	]	->	[	0.0	]  algorithm.  Miles	per	Gallon  Car	weight Engine	displacement Cylinder	count Horse	power Hybrid	or	gasoline Miles	per	gallon  Assuming	you	have	collected	some	data	for	these	fields,	you	should	be	able to	 construct	 a	 model	 that	 can	 predict	 one	 field	 value	 based	 on	 the	 other	 field values.	For	this	example,	we	will	try	to	predict	miles	per	gallon.  We	will	need	to	define	this	problem	in	terms	of	an	input	array	of	floating point	values	mapped	to	an	output	array	of	floating	point	values.	Furthermore,	the numeric	range	on	each	of	these	array	elements	should	be	between	0	and	1	or	-1 and	 1.	 This	 is	 called	 normalization.	 Normalization	 will	 be	 covered	 in	 much greater	detail	in	the	next	chapter.  First,	we	see	how	we	would	normalize	data	from	above.	Consider	the	input and	output	data	formats.	We	have	six	total	fields.	We	want	to	use	five	of	these	to predict	the	sixth.	The	algorithm	would	have	five	inputs	and	one	output.  SH   Your	algorithm’s	input	and	output	would	look	something	like	the	following.  	  We	also	need	to	normalize	the	data.	To	do	this	we	must	think	of	reasonable ranges	for	each	of	these	values.	We	will	then	transform	input	data	into	a	number between	0	and	1	that	represents	an	actual	value’s	position	within	that	range.	The following	example	establishes	reasonable	ranges	for	these	values: 	  Input	1:	Car	weight Input	2:	Engine	displacement Input	3:	Cylinder	count Input	4:	Horse	power Input	5:	Hybrid	or	gasoline Output	1:	Miles	per	gallon  Car	weight:	100–5000	lbs Engine	displacement:	0.1–10	liters Cylinder	count:	2–12 Horse	power:	1–1000 Hybrid	or	gasoline:	true	or	false Miles	per	gallon:	1–500  These	ranges	may	be	a	little	large	for	modern	cars.	However,	this	will	allow minimal	restructuring	to	the	algorithm	in	the	future.	It	is	also	best	to	use	ranges that	will	not	invite	too	much	data	at	their	extreme	ends,	so	a	large	range	is	best.  We	 will	 now	 look	 at	 an	 example.	 How	 would	 we	 normalize	 a	 weight	 of 2,000	pounds?	This	weight	is	1,900	into	the	range	and	the	size	of	the	range	is 4,900	pounds.	The	percent	of	the	range	size	is	0.38	 1,900	 	4,900 .	Therefore, we	would	feed	the	value	of	0.38	to	the	algorithm	input	to	represent	this	value. This	satisfies	the	typical	range	requirement	of	0	to	1	for	an	input.  The	hybrid	or	regular	value	is	a	true false.	To	represent	this	value	we	will use	 1	 for	 hybrid	 and	 0	 for	 regular.	 We	 simply	 normalize	 a	 true false	 into	 two values.  Presenting	Images	to	Algorithms  Images	are	a	popular	source	of	input	for	algorithms.	In	this	section,	we	will see	how	to	normalize	an	image.	There	are	more	advanced	methods	than	this,	but  SH   this	method	is	often	effective.  Consider	 a	 full-color	 image	 of	 300x300	 pixels.	 90,000	 pixels	 times	 the three	RGB	colors	gives	270,000	total	pixels.	If	we	had	an	input	for	each	pixel, that	would	be	270,000	inputs.	This	is	just	too	large	for	many	algorithms.  Thus,	we	need	to	downsample.	Consider	the	following	image,	which	is	at  full	resolution	 Figure	1.4 .  Figure	1.4:	An	Image	at	Full	Resolution  We	will	now	downsample	it	to	32x32,	as	shown	below	 Figure	1.5 .  Figure	1.5:	An	Image	Downsampled  The	grid-like	pattern	of	the	image	after	it	has	been	reduced	to	32x32	pixels allows	 us	 to	 use	 the	 pixels	 to	 form	 the	 input	 to	 an	 algorithm.	 This	 algorithm would	require	1,024	inputs,	if	the	algorithm	were	to	only	look	at	the	intensity	of  SH   each	square.	Looking	at	the	intensity	causes	the	algorithm	to	“see”	in	black	and white.  If	 you	 would	 like	 the	 algorithm	 to	 see	 in	 color,	 then	 it	 is	 necessary	 to provide	 the	 intensity	 of	 red,	 green,	 and	 blue	  RGB 	 values	 for	 each	 of	 these pixels.	This	would	mean	three	inputs	for	each	pixel,	which	would	push	our	input count	to	3,072.  The	normal	intensity	range	for	RGB	values	is	between	0	and	255.	To	create input	for	the	algorithm,	simply	divide	the	intensity	by	255	to	create	an	intensity percentage.	For	example,	intensity	number	10	becomes	10 255,	or	0.039.  You	may	be	wondering	how	the	outputs	will	be	handled.	In	a	case	such	as this,	 the	 outputs	 should	 communicate	 what	 image	 the	 algorithm	 believes	 it	 is looking	at.	The	usual	solution	is	to	create	one	output	for	each	type	of	image	the algorithm	should	recognize.	The	algorithm	will	be	trained	to	return	a	value	of 1.0	for	the	output	that	corresponds	to	what	the	image	is	believed	to	be.  We	 will	 continue	 showing	 you	 how	 to	 format	 algorithms	 for	 real-world  problems	in	the	next	section,	which	will	take	a	look	at	financial	algorithms.  Financial	Algorithms  Financial	 forecasting	 is	 a	 very	 popular	 form	 of	 temporal	 algorithm.	 A temporal	algorithm	is	one	that	accepts	input	for	values	that	range	over	time.	If the	algorithm	supports	short	term	memory	 internal	state 	then	ranges	over	time are	 supported	 automatically.	 If	 your	 algorithm	 does	 not	 have	 an	 internal	 state then	you	should	use	an	input	window	and	a	prediction	window.	Most	algorithms do	not	have	an	internal	state.	To	see	how	to	use	these	windows,	consider	if	you would	like	the	algorithm	to	predict	the	stock	market.	You	begin	with	the	closing price	for	a	stock	over	several	days.  Day	1:	$45 Day	2:	$47 Day	3:	$48 Day	4:	$40 Day	5:	$41 Day	6:	$43 Day	7:	$45 Day	8:	$57 Day	9:	$50 Day	10:$41  The	 first	 step	 is	 to	 normalize	 the	 data.	 This	 is	 necessary	 whether	 your  SH   algorithm	 has	 internal	 state	 or	 not.	 To	 normalize,	 we	 want	 to	 change	 each number	into	the	percent	movement	from	the	previous	day.	For	example,	day	2 would	 become	 0.04,	 because	 there	 is	 a	 4%	 difference	 between	 $45	 and	 $47. Once	you	perform	this	calculation	for	every	day,	the	data	set	will	look	like	the following:  Day	2:	0.04 Day	3:	0.02 Day	4:-0.16 Day	5:	0.02 Day	6:	0.04 Day	7:	0.04 Day	8:	0.04 Day	9:-0.12 Day	10:-0.18  In	order	to	create	an	algorithm	that	will	predict	the	next	day’s	values,	we need	to	think	about	how	to	encode	this	data	to	be	presented	to	the	algorithm.	The encoding	 depends	 on	 whether	 the	 algorithm	 has	 an	 internal	 state.	 The	 internal state	allows	the	algorithm	to	use	the	last	few	values	inputted	to	help	establish trends.  Many	machine	learning	algorithms	have	no	internal	state.	If	this	is	the	case, then	you	will	typically	use	a	sliding	window	algorithm	to	encode	the	data.	To	do this,	we	use	the	last	three	prices	to	predict	the	next	one.	The	inputs	would	be	the last	 three-day	 prices,	 and	 the	 output	 would	 be	 the	 fourth	 day.	 The	 above	 data could	be	organized	in	the	following	way	to	provide	training	data.	These	cases specified	the	ideal	output	for	the	given	inputs.  [0.04,0.02,-0.16]	->	0.02	 [0.02,-0.16,0.02]	->	0.04 [-0.16,0.02,0.04]	->	0.04 [0.02,0.04,0.04]		->	0.26		 [0.04,0.04,0.26]		->	-0.12 [0.04,0.26,-0.12]	->	-0.18  The	above	encoding	would	require	that	the	algorithm	have	three	inputs	and  one	output.  SH   Understanding	Training  What	exactly	is	training?	Training	is	the	process	whereby	an	algorithm	is adapted	for	the	training	data.	This	can	be	different	from	the	“internal	state”	that	I have	mentioned.	You	can	think	of	training	as	affecting	the	long-term	memory	of an	algorithm.	For	a	neural	network,	training	is	the	weight	matrix.  When	training	occurs	depends	on	the	algorithm.	Usually,	training	and	actual usage	of	the	algorithm	are	divided	into	two	distinct	phases.	Sometimes,	training and	usage	can	occur	simultaneously.  Evaluating	Success  In	school,	students	are	graded	as	they	learn	their	subjects.	There	are	many purposes	for	these	grades.	The	most	basic	purpose	is	to	provide	the	student	with feedback	on	their	path	of	learning.	You	must	also	evaluate	your	algorithms	as they	train.	This	evaluation	will	both	guide	the	training	and	provide	you	feedback as	to	the	success	of	the	training.  One	 method	 of	 evaluation	 is	 to	 provide	 a	 scoring	 function.	 This	 scoring function	takes	a	trained	algorithm	and	evaluates	it.	The	scoring	function	simply returns	 a	 score.	 The	 goal	 will	 be	 to	 either	 minimize	 or	 maximize	 this	 score. Whether	 any	 given	 problem	 is	 a	 minimization	 or	 maximization	 problem	 is purely	arbitrary	and	is	the	preference	of	the	scoring	programming.  Batch	and	Online	Training  Batch	and	online	training	usually	come	into	play	when	you	are	dealing	with a	training	set,	as	they	refer	to	types	of	learning	processes.	For	online	training, learning	 occurs	 after	 each	 training	 set	 element.	 Batch	 training	 accumulates learning	 from	 a	 certain	 number	 of	 elements	 and	 then	 the	 algorithm	 is	 updated accordingly.	The	designated	number	of	elements	is	called	the	batch	size.	Often, the	batch	size	is	equal	to	the	total	training	size.  Online	training	can	be	useful	when	an	algorithm	must	learn	and	train	at	the same	 time.	 The	 human	 brain	 always	 works	 in	 this	 mode.	 However,	 online  SH   training	 is	 less	 common	 in	 AI,	 and	 not	 all	 algorithms	 support	 online	 training. Online	training	support	is	very	common	for	neural	networks,	however.  Supervised	and	Unsupervised	Training  This	 chapter	 outlines	 two	 different	 training	 methods:	 supervised	 and unsupervised.	 Supervised	 training	 occurs	 when	 you	 know	 the	 output	 that	 you desire	 from	 the	 algorithm.	 Unsupervised	 training	 occurs	 when	 you	 do	 not provide	the	expected	outputs	to	the	algorithm.  There	 are	 also	 hybrid-training	 methods.	 In	 a	 hybrid	 training	 method,	 you provide	 only	 some	 expected	 outputs.	 This	 training	 method	 is	 used	 with	 deep belief	neural	networks.  Stochastic	and	Deterministic	Training  A	deterministic	training	algorithm	always	performs	exactly	the	same	way, given	 the	 same	 initial	 state.	 There	 are	 typically	 no	 random	 numbers	 used	 in	 a deterministic	training	algorithm.  Stochastic	 training	 makes	 use	 of	 random	 numbers.	 Because	 of	 this,	 an algorithm	 will	 always	 train	 differently,	 even	 with	 the	 same	 starting	 state.	 This can	 make	 it	 difficult	 to	 evaluate	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 a	 stochastic	 algorithm. However,	stochastic	algorithms	are	very	common	and	very	effective.  SH   Chapter	Summary  This	 chapter	 provided	 a	 basic	 introduction	 to	 AI,	 particularly	 machine learning.	You	saw	how	problems	are	modeled	to	a	machine-learning	algorithm. Machine	learning	algorithms	share	some	similarities	to	biological	processes,	but the	goal	of	AI	is	not	to	exactly	emulate	the	workings	of	a	human	brain.	The	goal of	 machine	 learning	 is	 to	 produce	 machines	 capable	 of	 some	 degree	 of intelligence	beyond	simple	procedural	programming.  Machine	learning	is	similar	to	the	human	brain	in	that	there	is	input,	output, and	potentially	an	internal	state.	The	input	and	internal	state	determine	what	the output	will	be.	This	internal	state	can	be	thought	of	as	a	short-term	memory	that influences	 the	 output.	 There	 is	 also	 a	 long	 term	 memory	 that	 dictates	 exactly what	 the	 machine	 learning	 algorithm	 will	 output	 given	 the	 input	 and	 internal state.	 Training	 is	 the	 process	 of	 adjusting	 this	 long-term	 memory	 so	 that	 the machine	learning	algorithm	produces	the	desired	output.  Machine	 learning	 algorithms	 are	 typically	 broken	 into	 several	 groups: regression	 and	 classification	 algorithms.	 Regression	 algorithms	 will	 output	 a number	 given	 one	 or	 more	 inputs.	 Regression	 algorithms	 are	 essentially multivariate	 functions.	 These	 algorithms	 accept	 several	 inputs	 and	 produce	 an output	of	one	or	more	values.  Classification	 algorithms	 accept	 one	 or	 more	 variable	 to	 return	 a	 single class	 instance.	 They	 are	 allowed	 to	 make	 decisions	 based	 on	 the	 input.	 For example,	 a	 classification	 algorithm	 might	 be	 used	 to	 sort	 job	 applicants	 into preferred,	average,	and	denied	groups.  This	 chapter	 showed	 that	 the	 input	 to	 a	 machine	 learning	 algorithm	 is	 a vector	of	numbers.	It	is	important	to	understand	how	to	represent	problems	as	a vector	of	numbers	in	order	to	pose	your	question	to	the	algorithm.  The	next	chapter	will	introduce	normalization.	Normalization	broadly	refers to	the	means	by	which	data	are	prepared	to	become	input	for	a	machine	learning algorithm.	 Additionally,	 normalization	 is	 used	 to	 interpret	 the	 output	 from	 the machine	learning	algorithm.  SH   Chapter	2:	Normalization 	  What	is	Normalization? Reciprocal	Normalization	and	Denormalization Range	Normalization	and	Denormalization  In	 the	 last	 chapter,	 we	 saw	 that	 a	 machine-learning	 algorithm	 is	 given	 a vector	of	floating	point	numbers.	This	is	the	input	vector.	We	also	saw	that	the machine-learning	algorithm	would	return	a	vector	in	response	to	the	input.	This is	the	output	vector.  This	chapter	looks	at	how	to	present	data	as	an	input	vector,	as	well	as	how to	interpret	the	results	from	the	output	vector.	In	order	to	do	so,	we	must	learn about	 the	 several	 different	 types	 of	 data,	 which	 are	 all	 normalized	 in	 different ways.  SH   Levels	of	Measurement  In	 statistics,	 data	 is	 typically	 broken	 down	 into	 two	 major	 categories: qualitative	and	quantitative.	In	general,	quantitative	data	deals	with	quantities,	or numbers.	Qualitative	data	deals	with	qualities,	or	descriptions.  For	example,	consider	a	cup	of	coffee.	You	could	describe	the	coffee	both qualitatively	 and	 quantitatively.	 If	 you	 were	 to	 describe	 the	 cup	 of	 coffee qualitatively,	you	might	list	the	following	attributes: 	  These	are	all	non-numerical	qualities,	and	thus	are	qualitative.	You	can	also  describe	the	cup	of	coffee	quantitatively. 	  These	are	all	numeric	quantities	that	describe	the	cup	of	coffee. We	 can	 describe	 the	 types	 of	 data	 in	 even	 greater	 detail	 by	 categorizing them	 into	 one	 of	 four	 subcategories.	 These	 data	 types	 were	 defined	 by psychologist	Stanley	Smith	Stevens	in	the	article	“On	the	Theory	of	Scales	of Measurement.”	 Stevens,	1946 	These	four	data	types	are	as	follows: 	  Brown Strong	aroma White	cup Hot	to	the	touch  12	fluid	ounces 106	calories 65	degrees	Celsius $4.99	cost  Nominal	data Ordinal	data Interval	data Ratio	data  SH   Nominal	 and	 ordinal	 observations	 are	 both	 qualitative,	 while	 interval	 and ratio	observations	are	both	quantitative.	The	differences	between	each	of	the	four can	 be	 somewhat	 confusing.	 I	 prefer	 to	 think	 of	 them	 in	 terms	 of	 what	 basic mathematical	 operations	 can	 be	 used	 with	 each.	 This	 is	 summarized	 in	 Figure 2.1.  Figure	2.1:	Levels	of	Measurement  You	 can	 usually	 determine	 the	 type	 of	 observation	 by	 considering	 what operators	are	valid	on	it.	For	example,	if	you	have	two	colors,	you	can	determine whether	the	two	colors	are	equal	 that	is,	whether	both	are	the	same	color .	One color	is	not	greater	than	another	color,	however.	You	can’t	add	two	colors,	nor can	you	multiply	two	colors.	Given	these	properties,	colors	are	nominal.  Now	let’s	consider	ordinals.	The	observation	that	something	is	hot	or	warm indicates	an	implied	ordering;	the	“hotness”	of	a	cup	of	coffee	is	ordinal.	Given two	 cups	 of	 coffee,	 one	 can	 determine	 whether	 they	 are	 the	 same	 degree	 of hotness	and	whether	one	is	hotter	than	the	other.	Ordinals	are	not	only	ordered, but	the	levels	of	order	are	clearly	defined.	In	the	case	of	the	levels	of	“hotness,” levels	include	scalding,	hot,	warm,	room	temperature,	and	cold.  For	a	slightly	more	complex	example	of	nominal	and	ordinal	observations,  SH   consider	a	zip	code	such	as	those	used	in	the	United	States	to	allow	for	the	quick sorting	 of	 letters	 and	 packages.	 They	 are	 made	 up	 of	 six	 digits,	 and	 each specifies	 a	 particular	 region.	 For	 example,	 the	 90210	 zip	 code	 specifies	 an address	in	Beverly	Hills,	California.  Although	 zip	 codes	 are	 always	 made	 up	 of	 digits	 and	 look	 like	 numbers, they	are	not	numbers.	You	could	compare	two	zip	codes	to	see	if	they	are	equal, but	to	add	to	or	subtract	from	a	zip	code	would	give	a	meaningless	answer.	So	a zip	 code	 is	 clearly	 qualitative,	 rather	 than	 quantitative.	 But	 is	 it	 nominal	 or ordinal?	Although	one	could	compare	the	numerical	value	of	zip	codes	to	say that	one	zip	code	is	greater	than	another,	the	higher	value	of	a	zip	code	gives	it no	special	meaning.	Certainly,	higher	zip	codes	are	often	in	the	west	of	the	USA and	lower	zip	codes	often	specify	a	location	in	the	east,	but	this	tendency	does not	hold	true	in	all	cases.	Zip	codes,	therefore,	are	nominal.  Quantitative	Observations  Now	 we	 will	 look	 at	 quantitative	 observations.	 The	 relationship	 between interval	 and	 ratio	 can	 be	 a	 little	 more	 complex	 than	 between	 ordinal	 and nominal.	In	addition	to	the	operators	above,	I	will	give	you	one	additional	rule	to define	the	difference.	Interval	observations	have	an	arbitrary	zero,	whereas	ratio observations	have	an	actual	non-arbitrary	zero	that	defines	their	beginning.  For	example,	age	is	a	ratio.	It	has	a	clearly	defined	origin	at	zero,	for	there are	no	ages	before	age	0.	The	current	year,	on	the	other	hand,	is	an	interval.	It does	not	have	a	clearly	defined	origin	at	0.  Let’s	 apply	 the	 operator	 test	 to	 these	 two	 examples.	 You	 can	 say	 that someone	is	twice	the	age	of	someone	else,	so	the	multiplier	rule	is	a	yes,	which defines	age	as	a	ratio.	You	could	treat	the	current	year	as	a	number	and	multiply it	by	2,	but	that	would	not	mean	that	one	date	was	twice	the	other,	because	dates do	not	have	an	origin	at	0.	However,	you	may	add	and	subtract	quantities	from dates	to	get	meaning,	so	the	current	date	does	count	as	an	interval.  Temperature	 can	 be	 either	 a	 ratio	 or	 an	 interval,	 depending	 on	 the	 scale used.	If	you	measure	the	temperature	in	Kelvin,	then	zero	is	absolute	zero;	thus, temperature	measured	in	Kelvin	is	a	ratio.	Temperature	measured	in	Fahrenheit or	 Celsius	 is	 an	 interval,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 because	 zero	 is	 not	 the	 origin	 for either	Fahrenheit	or	Celsius.  Test	 this	 definition	 using	 the	 phrase	 “twice	 as	 hot.”	 Ten	 degrees	 Celsius  SH   cannot	be	twice	as	hot	as	five	degrees	Celsius,	for	there	are	an	infinite	number	of degrees	available	below	0.	Thus,	because	the	term	“twice”	has	no	meaning	with Celsius	or	Fahrenheit,	they	are	intervals	rather	than	ratios.  With	Kelvin,	zero	is	absolute	zero—there	is	no	molecular	movement	at	all, and	it	cannot	possibly	be	colder	than	0.	In	the	case	of	Kelvin,	0	is	the	true	origin point.	Twice	as	hot	as	5	is	in	fact	10	degrees,	in	Kelvin.  Similarly,	speeds	are	ratios:	twice	as	fast	as	five	kilometers	per	hour	is	ten kilometers	per	hour.	There	is	no	going	slower	than	zero	kilometers	per	hour,	and so	zero	is	the	true	origin	point.  Most	scientific	measurements	are	ratio	observations.	These	include	length, width,	 electrical	 charge,	 volume,	 mass,	 and	 Kelvin	 temperature.	 The	 value	 of interval	 measurements	 are	 still	 helpful	 trackers,	 but	 typically	 their	 meaning	 is more	arbitrary.  SH   Normalizing	Observations  In	 the	 previous	 chapter	 we	 saw	 that	 all	 input	 and	 output	 from	 machine learning	 algorithms	 are	 typically	 vectors	 of	 floating	 point	 numbers.	 The	 real world	 observations	 that	 we	 provide	 to	 a	 machine	 learning	 algorithm	 must	 be nominal,	 ordinal,	 interval,	 or	 ratio.	 Nominal	 and	 ordinal	 observations	 are	 not inherently	numeric,	so	we	need	to	convert	these	into	a	number	that	is	meaningful to	the	machine	learning	algorithm.  Some	 machine	 learning	 algorithms	 require	 that	 all	 observations	 be	 in	 a specific	range,	usually	-1	to	+1	or	0	to	+1.	Even	if	you	are	not	required	to	be	in	a specific	range,	it	is	often	a	good	idea	to	ensure	that	your	values	fall	into	a	range. This	will	normalize	the	values	so	they	can	be	compared.  Why	is	normalization	necessary?	Consider	if	you	made	two	observations, one	of	which	was	the	daily	volume	of	the	NYSE	and	the	other	of	which	was	the point	movement	of	an	individual	stock.	The	NYSE	daily	volume	is	usually	in	the billions,	 while	 the	 number	 of	 points	 moved	 by	 many	 individual	 stocks	 is typically	 less	 than	 10.	 The	 volume	 number	 could	 easily	 overwhelm	 the	 point movement,	making	the	point	movement	seem	meaningless,	or	zero.  Normalization	 is	 something	 we	 see	 every	 day.	 One	 of	 its	 most	 common forms	 is	 that	 of	 percentages.	 If	 something	 is	 5%	 off,	 you	 can	 easily	 tell	 the relative	size	of	the	discount.	It	might	be	a	few	dollars	for	a	new	cell	phone	or	it might	be	several	hundred	dollars	for	a	car,	yet	the	size	of	the	percentage	figure stays	 the	 same.	 We	 could	 normalize	 the	 values	 in	 the	 NYSE	 example	 by considering	them	as	percentages.	Now	we	might	say	that	the	volume	increased by	10%,	while	the	stock	fell	by	5%.	The	volume	number	is	now	comparable	to the	point	number.  In	the	next	sections	we	will	see	how	to	normalize	nominal,	ordinal,	interval,  and	ratio	observations.  Normalizing	Nominal	Observations  There	are	two	commonly	used	methods	for	normalizing	ordinal	values.	In this	section,	we	will	look	at	one-of-n	encoding.	This	the	most	simple	means	of normalizing	 nominal	 values.	 Later	 in	 this	 chapter,	 we	 will	 discuss	 equilateral  SH   encoding.	Equilateral	encoding	is	more	complex,	but	is	often	more	efficient	than one-of-n	encoding.  One-of-n	is	a	very	simple	form	of	normalization.	For	an	example,	consider the	iris	dataset	that	we	saw	in	the	last	chapter.	A	single	line	from	the	iris	data	set is	 shown	 here.	 The	 species	 is	 non-numeric.	 We	 will	 have	 to	 use	 one-of-n normalization	for	it.  5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa  The	first	four	values	are	all	ratio	observations,	as	they	are	lengths	and	the origin	is	at	zero.	However,	the	fifth	value	is	nominal,	which	is	sometimes	called categorical.	It	describes	a	category.	The	nominal	value	is	defined	by	the	species of	the	iris;	in	the	iris	dataset	described	above,	there	were	three	iris	species: 	  Setosa Versicolor Virginica  With	 the	 one-of-n	 normalization,	 the	 machine	 learning	 algorithm	 would have	three	outputs—one	for	each	iris	species.	The	machine	learning	algorithm would	most	likely	be	trained	to	accept	the	four	length	measurements	as	inputs and	 then	 output	 three	 values	 to	 predict	 what	 species	 of	 iris	 the	 input	 data corresponds	to.  Normalization	is	used	to	create	training	data.	A	machine	learning	algorithm is	trained	with	training	data.	The	actual	process	of	training	will	be	covered	later in	 this	 book.	 For	 now,	 you	 simply	 need	 to	 be	 aware	 that	 a	 training	 set	 is	 a collection	of	input	vectors	that	includes	the	ideal	output	for	each	vector.	We	can use	the	iris	data	set	to	generate	a	training	set.	First,	to	generate	the	inputs,	we will	normalize	each	of	the	four	ratio	observations.	Later	in	the	chapter	we	will see	how	to	normalize	ratio	observations.	For	now,	we	will	focus	on	the	species.  Generating	the	ideal	output	for	each	of	these	input	vectors	is	relatively	easy. Simply	assign	a	+1	to	the	neuron	that	corresponds	to	the	chosen	iris	and	a	-1	to the	remaining	neurons.	For	example,	using	a	normalization	range	of	-1	to	1,	the Setosa	iris	species	would	be	encoded	as	follows:  1,-1,-1  SH   Likewise,	the	Versicolor	would	be	encoded	as	follows:  Finally,	Virginica	would	be	encoded	as	follows.  -1,1,-1  -1,-1,1  If	you	are	using	0	to	1,	then	substitute	0	for	the	-1	values	in	the	above	three  species	encodings.  Normalizing	Ordinal	Observations  Ordinal	observations	are	not	necessarily	numeric.	However,	they	do	have	an implied	 ordering.	 For	 example,	 consider	 the	 levels	 of	 education	 progressed through	by	a	student	in	the	United	States.	One	moves	from	preschool	level	to senior	level	before	graduating.	The	levels	have	no	true	numerical	value,	but	they do	occur	in	a	set	order.  In	order	to	normalize	an	ordinal	set,	one	must	preserve	the	order.	One-of-n encoding	loses	the	order.	While	the	outputs	are	a	vector,	and	it	may	appear	that there	 is	 order,	 there	 is	 really	 no	 ordering,	 because	 most	 machine	 learning algorithms	 treat	 the	 individual	 outputs	 with	 no	 ordering	 at	 all.	 Just	 because output	1	and	output	2	are	next	to	each	other,	that	does	not	mean	they	are	in any	way	related.	Implying	such	ordering	might	introduce	bias.  To	normalize	ordinal	observations,	there	two	options.	First,	you	can	simply normalize	with	one-of-n	encoding	and	forget	the	order.	It	could	be	that	the	order is	 not	 important,	 and	 in	 that	 case	 you	 can	 simply	 treat	 the	 observation	 as	 an unordered	 nominal	 data	 set.	 However,	 if	 you	 wish	 to	 preserve	 the	 order,	 you need	to	assign	a	whole	number	to	each	category,	starting	with	zero.	The	number assignments	for	the	grades	would	thus	be	as	follows: 	  Preschool	 0  Kindergarten	 1  First	grade	 2  Second	grade	 3  Third	grade	 4  Fourth	grade	 5  Fifth	grade	 6   SH   Sixth	grade	 7  Seventh	grade	 8  Eighth	grade	 9  Freshman	 10  Sophomore	 11  Junior	 12  Senior	 13   Now,	we	calculate	a	percent	completion	rate	to	determine	the	value	for	each level.	 There	 are	 fourteen	 total	 categories.	 So	 someone	 in	 sixth	 grade	 has completed	50%	of	their	education.  7	 	14	=	0.5	 50%   If	 we	 are	 normalizing	 between	 the	 range	 0	 to	 1,	 then	 the	 percentage	 is sufficient	at	0.5.	However,	if	we	are	normalizing	to	the	range	-1	to	1,	we	need	to apply	 the	 percent	 to	 that	 range.	 In	 order	 to	 do	 so,	 calculate	 the	 width	 of	 the range,	which	is	the	high	value	of	the	range	subtracted	by	the	low	value.  width	=	 high	-	low 	=	 1	-	 -1  	=	2  The	 percentage	 can	 be	 applied	 to	 the	 value	 of	 the	 width.	 If	 we	 are	 50%,  then	we	are	halfway.	Simply	multiply	the	percent	by	the	width.  widthDistance	=	width	*	0.5	=	1  Now,	add	the	width	to	the	lower	bound	to	get	the	normalized	number.	If	we had	achieved	zero	percent,	we	would	be	exactly	at	the	lower	bound	 -1 .	If	we had	achieved	one	hundred	percent,	we	would	be	exactly	at	the	upper	bound	 +1 . Sixth	grade	thus	normalizes	to	0.  lowerBound	+	widthDistance	=	-1	+	1	=	0  The	above	process	can	be	summarized	using	Equation	2.1:  Equation	2.1:	Normalize	Ordinal	Observation  The	concept	of	calculating	the	width	between	the	high	and	low	values	and taking	the	percent	of	that	width	to	normalize	the	percentage	is	one	that	will	be used	again	and	again.	The	next	two	normalization	techniques	will	build	on	that  SH   concept.	 For	 example,	 the	 next	 section	 shows	 how	 to	 reverse	 this	 process	 and denormalize	a	normalized	ordinal	observation.  Denormalizing	Ordinal	Observations  Denormalization	is	the	opposite	of	normalization—it	allows	you	to	take	a number	that	was	normalized	and	convert	it	back	to	the	original	number.	This	is very	useful	when	processing	the	output	from	a	machine	learning	algorithm.	For example,	if	you	trained	an	algorithm	to	predict	the	grade	level	achievement	of any	 given	 person,	 based	 on	 other	 observations,	 you	 would	 probably	 train	 the algorithm	with	current	grade	level	observations	that	were	normalized.	Because the	algorithm	was	trained	with	normalized	data,	it	will	also	output	normalized data.	 You	 need	 to	 denormalize	 this	 output	 so	 that	 it	 will	 have	 meaning	 in	 the context	of	the	knowledge	that	you	hoped	to	achieve.  I	will	now	show	you	how	to	denormalize	the	grade	level	from	the	previous section,	 which	 is	 essentially	 the	 process	 of	 running	 the	 normalization	 steps	 in reverse.	Let’s	say	that	the	output	is	the	normalized	value	of	zero.	To	determine what	grade	that	represents,	we	first	need	to	calculate	how	far	it	is	from	the	lower bound:  widthDistance	=	0	-	 -1 	=	1  This	converts	our	distance	into	the	width.	We	can	determine	the	percentage by	 calculating	 what	 percent	 into	 the	 width	 the	 above	 distance	 describes.	 We know	the	total	width,	because	it	is	the	range	between	the	normalized	upper	and lower	bounds	 -1	and	1 .	In	order	to	denormalize,	you	must	know	the	range	in which	the	data	were	originally	normalized.  widthPercent	=	widthDistance	 	width	=	1	 	2	=	0.5	 50%   We	 now	 apply	 this	 50%	 to	 our	 total	 number	 of	 categories,	 which,	 in	 this  case,	is	14.  categoryNumber	=	totalCategories	*	widthPercent	=	14	*	0.5	=	7  The	list	giving	value	to	the	grades	indicates	that	7	corresponds	to	the	sixth  grade.	We	have	thus	denormalized	the	observation.  The	above	process	can	be	summarized	using	Equation	2.2.  SH   Equation	2.2:	Denormalize	Ordinal	Observation  In	the	next	section,	we	will	see	how	to	normalize	quantitative	observations.  Normalizing	Quantitative	Observations  Interval	and	ratio	observations	are	normalized	in	the	same	way.	We	simply look	 at	 the	 range	 from	 which	 either	 of	 the	 quantitative	 observation	 types	 are drawn	 and	 normalize	 them	 to	 the	 desired	 range.	 The	 individual	 qualities	 that make	an	interval	observation	different	from	a	ratio	observation	are	meaningless for	normalization.  Quantitative	observations	are	always	numeric,	so	they	might	not	need	to	be normalized.	 While	 many	 machine-learning	 algorithms	 do	 require	 that	 numeric data	be	normalized	to	a	specific	range,	some	do	not.	It	is	important	to	know	the numeric	 ranges	 required	 by	 the	 algorithm	 you	 are	 using	 in	 order	 to	 receive relevant	output.  For	practice,	let’s	normalize	the	weight	of	an	automobile.	For	the	purposes of	this	example,	I	will	estimate	that	the	range	for	the	weight	of	a	car	is	between 100	and	4,000	kilograms.	As	mentioned	in	Chapter	1,	the	guessed	low	should	be lower	than	the	real	low	and	the	guessed	high	should	be	higher	than	the	actual high.	I	would	like	to	normalize	this	range	between	-1	and	1.	The	various	highs and	lows	that	apply	to	this	scenario	are	listed	as	follows: 	  dataHigh:	The	highest	unnormalized	observation. dataLow:	The	lowest	unnormalized	observation. normalizedHigh:	 The	 high	 end	 of	 the	 range	 to	 which	 the	 data	 will	 be normalized. normalizedLow:	 The	 low	 end	 of	 the	 range	 to	 which	 the	 data	 will	 be normalized.  Plugging	in	the	values	from	above	provides	the	following	values:  	  dataHigh:	4,000 dataLow:	100 normalizedHigh:	1  SH   normalizedLow:	-1  We	can	now	normalize	the	data.	We	need	to	calculate	two	ranges,	or	widths:  dataHigh	to	dataLow	and	normalizedHigh	to	normalizedLow.  dataRange	=	dataHigh	-	dataLow	=	4000	-	100	=	3900 normalizedRange	=	normalizedHigh	-	normalizedLow	=	1	-	 -1 	=	2  Let’s	attempt	to	normalize	a	car	weight	of	1,000	kilograms.	First,	we	need  to	determine	how	far	into	the	dataRange	this	value	is.  d	=	sample	-	dataLow	=	1000	-	100	=	900  We	now	convert	this	to	a	percent.  dPct	=	d	 	dataRange	=	900	 	3900	=	0.230769...	 23%   Rounded,	  this	 gives	 0.23.	 We	 now	 calculate	 how	 far	  into	  the  normalizedRange	is	0.23.  dNorm	=	dRange	*	dPct	=	2	*	0.23	=	0.46  We	now	add	this	to	the	normalized	low,	and	we	are	done.  Normalized	=	normalizedLow	+	dNorm	=	-1	+	0.46	=	-0.54  The	normalized	value	is	-0.54. The	above	process	can	be	summarized	using	Equation	2.3.  Equation	2.3:	Normalize	Quantitative	Observation  The	next	section	will	show	how	to	reverse	this	process	and	denormalize	a  quantitative	observation.  Denormalizing	Quantitative	Observations  To	 denormalize	 a	 quantitative	 observation,	 the	 normalization	 process	 is reversed.	Let’s	use	the	normalized	-0.54	from	before.	First,	we	calculate	how	far it	is	from	the	lower	bound.  SH   -0.54	-	 -1 	=	0.46  min	and	max.  0.46	 	2	=	0.23  0.23	*	3900	=	897  We	now	need	to	divide	this	number	by	the	distance	between	the	normalized  The	result	is	0.23,	or	23%.	Multiply	this	by	dataRange.  The	value	897	is	the	distance	into	the	dataRange	that	we	are.	To	convert  this	to	an	actual	weight,	just	add	dataLow.  	897	+	dataLow	=	897	+	100	=	997  The	value	997	is	approximately	equal	to	our	original	number	of	1,000,	so we	have	denormalized	the	weight.	It	is	not	exactly	equal	because	I	rounded	on some	of	the	divisions.  The	above	process	can	be	summarized	with	Equation	2.4.  Equation	2.4:	Denormalize	Quantitative	Observation  There	 are	 other	 ways	 to	 normalize	 both	 nominal	 and	 quantitative  observations.	These	will	be	covered	in	the	next	section.  SH   Other	Methods	of	Normalization  There	 are	 many	 other	 means	 of	 normalizing	 observations.	 The	 means already	presented	are	the	most	common.	This	section	will	introduce	some	other normalization	methods	for	both	quantitative	and	nominal	observations.  Reciprocal	Normalization  In	 this	 section	 we	 will	 look	 at	 a	 very	 simple	 means	 of	 normalization— reciprocal	 normalization.	 This	 normalization	 method	 supports	 both normalization	and	denormalization.	However,	reciprocal	normalization	is	limited in	 that	 you	 cannot	 normalize	 into	 the	 range	 of	 your	 choice.	 Rather,	 reciprocal normalization	always	normalizes	to	a	number	in	the	range	between	-1	and	1.  Reciprocal	normalization	is	very	easy	to	implement.	It	requires	no	analysis of	the	data	to	determine	high	and	low	data	values.	Equation	2.5	shows	how	to use	reciprocal	normalization.  Equation	2.5:	Reciprocal	Normalization  To	see	Equation	2.5	in	use,	consider	normalizing	the	number	five.  f 5.0 	=	1.0 5.0	=	0.2  As	you	can	see,	the	number	five	has	been	normalized	to	0.2.  Reciprocal	Denormalization  It	 is	 very	 easy	 to	 denormalize	 a	 number	 that	 has	 been	 normalized  reciprocally.	Because	it	is	a	reciprocal,	it	is	the	same	equation.  Equation	2.6:	Reciprocal	Denormalization  SH   To	see	Equation	2.6	in	use,	consider	denormalizing	the	number	0.2.  f 0.2 	=	1  0.2 	=	5.0  As	you	can	see,	we	have	easily	completed	a	round	trip.	We	normalized	5.0  to	0.2,	and	then	denormalized	0.2	back	to	5.0.  Understanding	Equilateral	Encoding  Equilateral	 encoding	 is	 a	 potential	 replacement	 for	 one-of-n	 encoding.	 I must	 admit	 that	 I	 am	 rather	 fond	 of	 this	 encoding	 method.	 If	 you’ve	 read	 my web-based	articles,	you	will	see	that	I	use	it	often.	Equilateral	encoding	brings two	main	features	to	the	table. 	  Requires	one	fewer	output	than	one-of-n Spreads	the	“blame”	better	than	one-of-n  Equilateral	encoding	uses	one	fewer	output	than	one-of-n.	This	means	that if	 you	 have	 ten	 categories	 to	 encode,	 one-of-n	 will	 require	 ten	 outputs	 while equilateral	will	require	only	nine.	This	gives	you	a	slight	performance	boost.  The	 second	 feature	 is	 slightly	 more	 difficult	 to	 understand.	 Most	 training algorithms	will	score	the	output	of	a	machine-learning	algorithm	based	on	the incorrectness	of	each	output.	Consider	if	you	had	100	categories,	which	would require	100	outputs	in	one-of-n.	The	incorrectness	will	be	centered	primarily	on two	outputs.	Recall	that	one-of-n	specifies	the	selected	category	by	which	output has	the	highest	value.	The	two	outputs	primarily	involved	in	the	incorrect	answer are	the	output	that	mistakenly	had	the	highest	output	and	the	output	that	should have	 had	 the	 correct	 output.	 All	 of	 the	 other	 outputs	 have	 an	 “ideal	 value”	 of either	0	or	-1,	depending	on	your	normalization	range.  This	can	cause	a	small	problem	for	the	one-of-n	normalization	method.	If the	 algorithm	 had	 predicted	 a	 versicolor	 iris	 when	 it	 should	 have	 predicted	 a verginica	iris,	the	actual	output	and	ideal	output	would	be	as	follows:  Ideal	output:	-1,	-1,	1 Actual	output:	-1,	1,	-1  The	 problem	 is	 that	 only	 two	 of	 three	 actual	 outputs	 are	 incorrect.	 We would	like	to	spread	the	“guilt”	for	this	error	over	a	larger	percent	of	the	actual outputs.	This	ensures	that	any	training	correct	is	applied	equally	to	all	outputs.  SH   To	do	this,	a	unique	set	of	values	for	each	class	must	be	determined.	Each	set	of values	 should	 have	 an	 equal	 Euclidean	 distance	 from	 the	 others.	 We	 will	 see more	 about	 Euclidean	 distance	 later	 in	 this	 chapter.	 The	 equal	 distance	 makes sure	that	incorrectly	choosing	Iris	setosa	for	versicolor	has	the	same	error	weight as	choosing	Iris	setosa	for	Iris	virginica.  Listing	2.1	shows	the	ideal	classes	normalized	for	one	of	n.  Listing	2.1:	Calculated	Class	Equilateral	Values	3	Classes  0:	-0.8660	,	-0.5000 1:	-0.8660	,	-0.5000 2:	0.0000	,	1.0000  Notice	that	there	are	two	outputs	for	each	of	the	three	classes.	This	causes the	 decreased	 number	 of	 outputs	 provided	 by	 equilateral	 encoding	 relative	 to one-of-n	encoding.	Equilateral	encoding	always	requires	one	fewer	output	than one-of-n	encoding	would	have.  Look	at	the	example	concerning	equilateral	normalization.	Just	as	before, consider	 whether	 the	 algorithm	 had	 predicted	 a	 versicolor	 iris	 when	 it	 should have	predicted	a	verginica	iris.	The	output	and	ideal	are	as	follows:  Ideal	output:	0.0000	,	-1.0000 Actual	output:	-0.8660	,	-0.5000  In	 this	 case,	 there	 are	 only	 two	 outputs,	 as	 is	 consistent	 with	 equilateral encoding.	Now	all	outputs	are	producing	incorrect	values.	Additionally,	there	are only	 two	 outputs	 to	 process,	 which	 slightly	 decreases	 the	 amount	 of	 data processed	by	the	machine	learning	algorithm.  Algorithms	will	rarely	give	output	that	exactly	matches	any	of	their	training values.	To	deal	with	this	in	one-of-n	encoding,	we	simply	look	at	what	output was	the	highest.	This	method	does	not	work	for	equilateral	encoding.	Equilateral encoding	 shows	 what	 calculated	 class	 equilateral	 value	  Listing	 2.1 	 has	 the shortest	distance	to	the	actual	output	of	the	algorithm.  What	is	meant	by	the	assertion	that	each	of	the	sets	are	equal	in	distance from	each	other?	It	means	that	their	Euclidean	distance	is	equal.	Distances	will be	covered	in	greater	detail	in	the	next	chapter.	The	Euclidean	distance	can	be calculated	using	Equation	2.7.  Equation	2.7:	Euclidean	Distance  SH   In	the	above	equation,	the	variable	“q”	represents	the	ideal	output	value;	the variable	“p”	represents	the	actual	output	value.	There	are	“n”	sets	of	ideal	and actual	outputs.	The	next	chapter	will	greatly	expand	upon	Euclidean	distance.  Implementing	Equilateral	Encoding  I	 will	 now	 show	 you	 the	 means	 by	 which	 the	 Euclidean	 encodings	 are calculated.	I	originally	saw	this	algorithm	in	the	book	“Practical	Neural	Network Recipes	in	C++”	by	Masters	 1993 ,	who	cited	an	article	in	PCAI	as	the	actual source.	 Guiver,	1991   The	equilateral	algorithm	can	be	a	bit	confusing,	so	I	will	demonstrate	it	in two	different	ways.	First,	I	will	demonstrate	it	graphically.	We	will	normalize	to the	 range	 -1	 to	 1.	 Consider	 if	 we	 were	 to	 simply	 encode	 two	 categories. Equilateral	encoding	requires	one	output	less	than	the	number	of	categories.	For two	categories,	only	one	output	is	given.	We	can	think	of	the	single	output	as	a single	dimension.	Figure	2.2	demonstrates	what	the	one-dimensional	output	will look	like.  Figure	2.2:	Equilateral	Encoding	for	Two	Categories  SH   You	 can	 see	 the	 two	 points	 on	 the	 above	 line.	 We	 would	 have	 a	 single  output	of	either	1	or	-1.  If	we	had	three	categories,	there	would	be	two	outputs.	Think	of	this	as	two dimensions;	it	creates	an	equilateral	triangle.	This	is	where	the	name	equilateral encoding	comes	from.	Figure	2.3	shows	how	the	three	categories	are	encoded.  Figure	2.3:	Equilateral	Encoding	for	Three	Categories  The	key	point	of	equilateral	encoding	is	that	each	of	these	three	categories must	be	equally	distant	from	their	neighbors.	This	allows	the	three	categories	to be	 represented	 in	 two	 dimensions.	 The	 dimensions	 that	 you	 see	 in	 the	 above figure	match	the	encodings	that	we	used	in	Figure	2.2.  We	 can	 also	 encode	 four	 categories.	 To	 encode	 four	 categories,	 we	 need  three	outputs,	or	three	dimensions.	This	is	depicted	in	in	Figure	2.4.  Figure	2.4:	Equilateral	Encoding	for	Four	Categories  SH   The	above	figure	is	a	three-dimensional	equilateral	triangle.	It	is	essentially a	 triangle-based	 pyramid.	 Just	 like	 all	 equilateral	 triangles,	 the	 lengths	 of	 all sides	are	equal.  We	can	also	encode	much	larger	numbers	of	categories.	I	cannot	show	these as	dimensions	because	it	is	difficult	to	display	a	high	dimensional	figure	in	our three	dimensional	world,	let	alone	on	a	two-dimensional	book	page.  Hopefully	the	graphical	representations	above	show	how	the	categories	are arranged	 equidistantly	 from	 one	 another.	 Now	 I	 will	 show	 you	 how	 these numbers	are	actually	calculated.  The	 equilateral	 encoding	 algorithm	 is	 usually	 implemented	 to	 output	 a matrix.	The	matrix	is	N	by	N-1,	where	N	is	the	number	of	categories.	Each	row contains	the	encodings	for	one	category.	We	will	always	create	this	matrix	for normalization	to	the	range	-1	to	1.	We	will	ultimately	scale	the	completed	matrix to	whatever	range	we	desire.  To	 begin	 creating	 this	 matrix	 we	 first	 seed	 the	 matrix	 for	 a	 two	 class encoding.	As	seen	in	Figure	2.1,	this	is	simply	the	values	-1	and	1.	We	begin	by  SH   seeding	these	two	values	into	the	matrix.  result[0][0]	=	-1; result[1][0]	=	1;  We	 will	 now	 loop	 from	 two	 categories	 up	 to	 our	 N	 classes.	 We	 skip	 1 because	we	already	seeded	for	the	case	where	we	have	one	category	only.	We loop	from	2	up	to,	but	not	including,	N.  for	k	from	2	to	N	{  Next,	 we	 calculate	 a	 scaling	 factor.	 We	 will	 recursively	 build	 each successive	 matrix	 from	 the	 previous	 matrix.	 We	 seed	 for	 two	 categories,	 and then	 scale	 it	 to	 build	 the	 matrix	 for	 three	 categories.	 This	 is	 done	 with	 the following	code:  Next,	we	loop	over	the	portion	of	the	matrix	that	we	have	already	calculated  	f	=	sqrt 	N	*	N	-	1.0 	 	r;  and	scale.  	for	i	from	0	to	k	{ 			for	j	from	0	to	k-1	{ 					result[i][j]	*=	f; 			} 	}  reciprocal	of	N.  		r	=	-1	 	N; 				for	i	from	0	to	k	{ 						result[i][k	-	1]	=	r; 		}  	result[k][k	-	1]	=	1.0; }  We	will	now	populate	the	edge	of	the	matrix	 columns 	with	the	negative  Set	the	last	value	in	the	matrix	to	1.0	and	continue	the	previous	“for	loop.”  Now	 that	 the	 loop	 is	 complete,	 we	 are	 ready	 to	 scale	 the	 matrix	 to	 the appropriate	 range.	 We	 use	 the	 same	 normalization	 formula	 shown	 in	 Equation 2.3.  SH   We	will	use	-1	and	1	for	the	low	and	high	ranges	for	the	data.  dataLow	=	-1; dataHigh	=	1;  We	now	loop	over	the	entire	matrix	and	scale	it.  for	row	from	0	to	N	{ 		for	col	from	0	to	N-1	{ 				result[row][col]	=	  result[row][col]	-	dataLow 	 						 	 dataHigh	-	dataLow   						*	 normalizedHigh	-	normalizedLow 	+	normalizedLow; 		} }  At	this	point,	the	matrix	is	now	ready	to	be	used	as	a	table	for	equilateral encoding.	If	you	wish	to	encode	a	category	to	equilateral,	simply	use	the	matrix as	 a	 lookup	 table	 and	 copy	 the	 row	 that	 corresponds	 to	 the	 category	 you	 are encoding.	To	decode,	simply	find	the	matrix	row	that	has	the	lowest	Euclidean distance	to	the	output	vector	from	your	machine-learning	algorithm.  SH   Chapter	Summary  This	 chapter	 described	 several	 normalization	 processes.	 Normalization	 is the	process	by	which	data	is	forced	to	conform	to	a	specific	range.	The	range	is usually	either	-1	to	+1	or	0	to	1.	The	range	you	choose	is	usually	dependent	on the	 machine-learning	 algorithm	 you	 are	 using.	 This	 chapter	 covered	 several different	types	of	normalization.  Reciprocal	 normalization	 is	 a	 very	 simple	 normalization	 technique.	 This technique	 normalizes	 numbers	 to	 the	 range	 -1	 to	 1.	 Reciprocal	 normalization simply	takes	the	reciprocal	normalization	and	divides	the	number	to	normalize by	1.  Range	 normalization	 is	 more	 complex.	 However,	 range	 normalization allows	you	to	normalize	to	any	range	you	like.	Additionally,	range	normalization must	know	the	range	of	the	input	data.	While	this	does	allow	you	to	make	use	of the	 entire	 normalization	 range,	 it	 also	 means	 that	 the	 entire	 data	 set	 must	 be analyzed	ahead	of	time.  This	chapter	also	showed	how	Euclidean	distance	can	be	used	to	determine how	similar	two	vectors	are	to	one	another.	The	next	chapter	will	expand	upon the	concept	of	distance	and	introduce	additional	distance	metrics.  SH   Chapter	3:	Distance	Metrics 	  Vectors Euclidean	Distance Manhattan	Distance Chebyshev	Distance  Distance	 is	 a	 very	 important	 measurement	 in	 both	 real	 life	 and	 Artificial Intelligence	 AI .	In	real	life,	distance	measures	the	degree	of	separation	between two	points.	In	AI,	distance	is	used	to	calculate	the	similarity	of	two	vectors.	For AI,	 think	 of	 a	 vector	 as	 a	 one-dimensional	 array—the	 distance	 between	 two arrays	is	the	similarity	between	them.  SH   Understanding	Vectors  A	 vector	 is	 essentially	 a	 one-dimension	 array.	 Do	 not	 confuse	 the dimensionality	of	the	vector	array	with	the	dimensions	of	your	problem.	Even	if your	problem	had	10	inputs,	you	would	still	have	a	vector.	Vectors	are	always one	dimension	arrays.	Your	ten	inputs	would	be	stored	in	a	vector	of	length	ten.  In	 AI,	 a	 vector	 is	 usually	 used	 to	 store	 observations	 about	 a	 particular  instance	of	something.  This	maps	to	the	real	world	concept	of	distance	quite	well.	You	can	think	of a	point	on	a	sheet	of	paper	as	having	two	dimensions,	which	are	usually	referred to	 as	 x	 and	 y.	 Likewise,	 a	 point	 in	 3D	 space	 has	 three	 dimensions,	 usually labeled	“x,”	“y,”	and	“z.”	A	two	dimensional	point	can	be	stored	in	a	vector	of length	two.	Likewise,	a	3D	point	can	be	stored	in	a	vector	of	length	three.  Our	 universe	 is	 made	 up	 of	 three	 perceivable	 dimensions,	 although sometimes	“time”	is	treated	as	a	fourth	dimension.	However,	this	is	a	manifold, and	does	not	imply	that	time	is	a	true	dimension,	at	least	in	the	sense	of	the	first three.	Because	higher	dimensions	are	imperceptible	to	humans,	it	is	very	difficult for	us	to	comprehend	dimensional	spaces	higher	than	three.	Very	high	dimension spaces	are	very	common	in	AI,	however.  Recall	 from	 Chapter	 2,	 “Normalizing	 Data,”	 that	 the	 iris	 data	 set	 had	 the  following	five	observations,	or	features: 	  Sepal	length Sepal	width Petal	length Petal	width Iris	species  You	 could	 think	 of	 this	 data	 set	 as	 a	 vector	 of	 length	 5.	 However,	 the species	feature	must	be	handled	differently	than	the	other	four.	Vectors	typically contain	 only	 numbers.	 The	 first	 four	 features	 are	 inherently	 numerical,	 but species	is	not.	As	demonstrated	in	chapter	two,	there	are	several	ways	to	encode the	species	observation	to	additional	dimensions.  SH   Only	 simple	 numeric	 encoding	 translates	 the	 iris	 species	 to	 a	 single dimension.	We	must	use	additional	dimensional	encodings,	such	as	one-of-n	or equilateral,	so	that	the	species	encodings	are	equidistant	from	each	other.	If	we are	 classifying	 irises,	 we	 do	 not	 want	 our	 means	 of	 encoding	 to	 induce	 any biases.  Thinking	of	the	iris	features	as	dimensions	in	a	higher	dimensional	space makes	a	great	deal	of	sense.	You	can	think	of	the	individual	samples	 the	rows	in the	iris	data	set 	as	points	in	this	search	space.	Points	closer	together	are	likely	to share	 similarities.	 Let’s	 take	 a	 look	 at	 what	 this	 actually	 looks	 like	 by considering	the	following	three	rows	from	the	iris	data	set:  5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,Iris-versicolor 6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,Iris-virginica  [5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,1,0,0] [7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,0,1,0] [6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,0,0,1]  If	we	use	one-of-n	encoding	to	the	range	0	to	1,	the	above	three	rows	would  encode	to	the	following	three	vectors:  Now	that	you	have	the	data	in	vector	form,	you	can	calculate	the	distance between	any	two	data	items.	The	next	few	sections	will	describe	several	different methods	to	calculate	the	distance	between	two	vectors.  SH   Calculating	Vector	Distance  The	distance	between	two	vectors	tells	us	the	degree	of	similarity	between  two	vectors.	There	are	several	different	ways	to	calculate	this	vector	distance.  Euclidean	Distance  The	 Euclidean	 distance	 measurement	 is	 based	 off	 of	 the	 real,	 two- dimensional	distance	between	two	vectors.	That	is,	it	is	the	difference	between the	two	points	if	you	drew	them	on	paper	and	measured	with	a	ruler.	This	two- dimensional	distance	is	based	on	the	Pythagorean	Theorem.	Specifically,	if	you had	 two	 points	  x1,y1 	 and	  x2,y2 ,	 the	 distance	 between	 the	 two	 would	 be described	as	follows:  Figure	3.1	shows	a	two	dimensional	Euclidean	distance	between	two	points.  Figure	3.1:	Two-Dimensional	Euclidean	Distance  SH   This	would	work	fine	for	comparing	two	vectors	of	length	two.	However, most	vectors	are	longer	than	two	numbers.	To	calculate	the	Euclidean	distance for	any	sized	vector,	use	the	general	form	of	the	Euclidean	distance	equation.  The	Euclidean	distance	measurement	is	used	often	in	Machine	Learning.	It is	a	quick	way	to	compare	two	vectors	of	numbers	that	have	the	same	number	of elements.	Consider	three	vectors,	named	vector	a,	vector	b,	 and	 vector	 c.	The Euclidean	distance	between	array	a	and	array	b	 is	 10.	 The	 Euclidean	 distance between	 array	 a	 and	 array	 c	 is	 20.	 In	 this	 case,	 the	 contents	 of	 array	 a	 more closely	match	array	b	than	they	do	array	c.  Equation	 3.1	 shows	 the	 formula	 for	 calculating	 the	 Euclidean	 distance.   Deza,	2009   Equation	3.1:	The	Euclidean	Distance  SH   The	above	equation	shows	us	the	Euclidean	distance	d	between	two	arrays p	and	q.	The	above	equation	also	states	that	d p,q 	is	the	same	as	d q,p .	This simply	 means	 that	 the	 distance	 is	 the	 same	 no	 matter	 which	 end	 you	 start	 at. Calculation	of	the	Euclidean	distance	is	no	more	than	summing	the	squares	of the	difference	of	each	array	element.	Following	this,	the	square	root	of	this	sum is	taken.	This	square	root	is	the	Euclidean	distance.  The	following	shows	Equation	3.1	in	pseudo	code	form.  function	euclidean	 position1,	position2 	 { 		sum	=	0; 		for	i	from	0	to	position1.length	 		{ 				d	=	position1[i]	-	position2[i]; 				sum	=	sum	+	d	*	d; 		} 		 		return	sqrt sum ; }  Manhattan	Distance  Manhattan	 distance	 is	 also	 commonly	 called	 taxicab	 distance.	 Euclidean distance	can	be	thought	of	in	terms	of	“as	the	crow	flies.”	Manhattan	distance calculates	the	distance	as	though	you	were	driving	on	a	city	grid.	 Krause,	2012  You	can	see	two-dimensional	Manhattan	distance	depicted	in	Figure	3.2.  Figure	3.2:	Two-Dimension	Manhattan	Distance  SH   To	calculate	the	Manhattan	Distance	between	two	points,	add	the	absolute distances	 of	 each	 of	 the	 dimensions.	 Equation	 3.2	 performs	 this	 operation.  Deza,	2009   Equation	3.2:	The	Manhattan	Distance  The	primary	difference	between	the	Euclidean	and	Manhattan	distances	is that	large	distances	are	penalized	disproportionately	more	than	small	distances. For	example,	when	using	Euclidean	distance,	the	distance	between	two	vectors that	differ	by	one	unit	in	two	dimensions	 the	square	root	of	two 	is	less	than	the distance	 between	 two	 vectors	 that	 differ	 by	 two	 units	 in	 only	 one	 dimension  SH    two ,	whereas	they	would	both	be	equal	 two 	using	Manhattan	distance.  The	following	shows	Equation	3.2	in	pseudo	code	form.  function	manhattan	 position1,	position2 	 { 		sum	=	0; 		for	i	from	0	to	position1.length	 		{ 				d	=	abs position1[i]	-	position2[i] ; 				sum	=	sum	+	d; 		} 		 		return	sum; }  Chebyshev	Distance  The	Chebyshev	distance	is	also	commonly	called	the	chessboard	distance. If	you’ve	ever	played	chess,	you	can	think	of	it	as	the	number	of	moves	that	a king	would	take	to	move	between	the	two	points.	Figure	3.3	shows	how	far	each of	the	locations	is	from	the	first	point.  Figure	3.3:	Two-Dimension	Chebyshev	Distance  SH   To	calculate	the	Chebyshev	distances,	take	the	maximum	of	the	dimension  differences.	This	is	described	in	Equation	3.3.	 Deza,	2009   Equation	3.3:	The	Chebyshev	Distance  The	 Chebyshev	 distance	 can	 be	 useful	 when	 you	 want	 to	 focus	 on	 the dimension	with	the	largest	distance.	When	all	dimensions	are	either	normalized or	 in	 approximately	 the	 same	 range	 and	 the	 worst	 dimension	 governs	 the similarity	between	the	two	vectors,	the	Chebyshev	distance	is	best	to	use.  The	following	shows	Equation	3.3	in	pseudo	code	form.  function	chebyshev	 position1,	position2 	  SH   { 		result	=	0; 		for	i	from	0	to	position1.length	 		{ 				d	=	abs position1[i]	-	position2[i] ; 				result	=	max result,	d ; 		} 		 		return	result; }  SH   Optical	Character	Recognition  OCR	 is	 a	 very	 common	 example	 of	 machine	 learning.	 You’ve	 probably seen	it	on	the	Internet.	Most	of	these	examples	are	of	the	same	form.	You	draw	a series	 of	 characters	 and	 a	 very	 complex	 machine-learning	 algorithm	  often	 a neural	network 	learns	your	characters	and	can	recognize	new	ones.  Euclidean	 distance	 can	 be	 used	 to	 perform	 basic	 Optical	 Character Recognition	 OCR .	The	program	allows	you	to	draw	individual	characters	and add	them	a	list	of	known	characters.	The	characters	you	draw	are	images,	which are	a	popular	source	of	input	for	AI.	This	section	describes	how	to	normalize	an image	 using	 down	 sampling.	 There	 are	 more	 advanced	 methods	 than	 this,	 but down	sampling	is	often	effective.	 Lyons,	2009   The	first	step	is	to	take	a	raw	image	that	you	want	the	program	to	recognize. A	 real	 OCR	 package	 would	 have	 to	 process	 the	 image	 and	 determine	 its individual	 characters.	 For	 this	 example,	 we	 will	 simplify	 the	 process	 by	 only using	a	single	character.	Figure	3.4	shows	such	an	image—a	zero	digit.  Figure	3.4:	Drawing	a	Zero  SH   You	may	have	noticed	there	is	quite	a	bit	of	extra	space	at	the	sides	of	the digit	I	drew.	This	could	present	a	problem.	The	machine	learning	algorithm	will be	looking	at	a	grid	of	pixels	as	inputs.	What	if	the	user	draws	the	zero	in	the upper	 left	 corner	 during	 training,	 but	 in	 the	 lower-right	 corner	 when	 actually using	the	algorithm?	The	algorithm	would	be	unlikely	to	recognize	the	second drawing,	because	the	pixels	would	be	on	different	inputs.	Because	of	this,	it	is necessary	to	crop.	To	crop,	just	drop	lines	from	the	top,	left,	right,	and	bottom until	they	touch	a	pixel.	Figure	3.5	shows	the	cropping	lines.  Figure	3.5:	Cropping	the	Digit  SH   Then	crop	the	image.	While	doing	so,	we	will	also	down	sample.	This	will cause	us	to	have	fewer	pixels	to	review	and	resolves	issues	related	to	size.	If	the user	 draws	 the	 digit	 at	 different	 sizes,	 down	 sampling	 will	 eliminate	 the possibility	that	the	sizing	will	affect	the	program’s	reading.  Why	do	we	need	to	decrease	the	number	of	pixels?	Consider	a	full-color image	that	is	300x300	pixels.	We	would	have	90,000	pixels	times	the	three	RGB colors,	giving	270,000	total	pixels.	If	we	had	an	input	for	each	pixel,	that	would be	270,000	inputs.	Each	image	is	a	vector,	and	a	270k-dimension	vector	would be	very	large!	To	make	the	program	more	robust,	it	is	necessary	to	decrease	the number	of	inputs.  Figure	3.6	shows	what	the	image	looks	like	down	sampled	to	7x5	pixels.  SH   Figure	3.6:	Down	Sampling  To	perform	the	down	sample,	lay	a	7x5	grid	over	the	high-resolution	image. For	 each	 grid	 cell,	 make	 the	 entire	 cell	 black,	 if	 even	 one	 underlying	 pixel	 is black.  Because	we	have	a	7x5	grid,	we	now	can	create	a	vector	of	size	7x5	or	35 inputs.	 We	 create	 a	 vector	 for	 each	 digit	 and	 store	 its	 cropped,	 down	 sampled form	in	a	table.	When	the	user	draws	new	characters	to	recognize,	we	will	crop and	down	sample.	A	new	vector	is	created	for	each	image.	We	then	find	the	digit in	our	table	with	the	least	distance	from	our	new	image.	We	determine	the	new image	to	be	the	same	digit	as	the	digit	in	the	table	with	the	lowest	distance.  SH   Chapter	Summary  Vectors	 are	 a	 very	 important	 component	 of	 machine	 learning.	 Both	 input and	 output	 are	 in	 the	 form	 of	 vectors	 in	 the	 context	 of	 a	 machine	 learning algorithm.	The	memory	of	the	machine	learning	algorithm	is	typically	thought	of as	a	vector.	Vectors	can	also	be	considered	as	coordinates	in	an	n-dimensional space.	This	allows	us	to	compare	the	similarity	of	two	vectors	by	computing	the distance	between	them.  There	 are	 many	 different	 ways	 to	 calculate	 the	 distance	 between	 two vectors.	One	of	the	most	basic	is	Euclidean	distance.	Euclidean	distance	uses	the regular	distance	formula	for	between	two-dimensional	points.	This	same	formula can	be	applied	to	any	number	of	dimensions.	Manhattan	distance	and	Chebyshev distance	may	also	be	used.  Optical	Character	Recognition	 OCR 	can	be	implemented	through	simple distance	 calculation.	 We	 begin	 by	 creating	 a	 table	 of	 known	 characters	 and	 a table	 of	 vectors	 to	 represent	 these	 characters.	 These	 vectors	 are	 created	 by cropping	and	down	sampling	the	character	images.	New	images	are	cropped	and down	sampled,	as	well.	We	then	determine	the	new	character	to	be	the	character that	has	the	least	distance	from	one	of	the	vectors	stored	in	the	table.  Random	 numbers	 are	 a	 very	 important	 concept	 to	 machine	 learning.	 We will	 often	 use	 a	 random	 vector	 as	 the	 initial	 state	 of	 a	 machine	 learning algorithm.	 This	 initial	 random	 state	 is	 then	 refined	 during	 training.	 Random numbers	 can	 also	 be	 used	 for	 Monte	 Carlo	 techniques	 for	 training.	 The	 next chapter	will	cover	random	numbers.  SH   Chapter	4:	Random	Number	Generation 	  Pseudorandom	Number	Generation Linear	Congruential	Generator	 LCG  Multiply	With	Carry	 MWC  Mersenne	Twister Monte	Carlo	Method  Random	numbers	are	very	important	to	many	machine	learning	algorithms and	 training	 techniques.	 When	 performed	 by	 computers,	 random	 number generation	 is	 called	 pseudorandom	 number	 generation	  PRNG .	 The	 prefix “pseudo”	means	that	something	is	implied,	rather	than	defined.	This	is	the	case with	computer	generated	random	numbers,	as	a	computer	is	a	completely	logical machine	 that	 follows	 instructions	 and	 can	 only	 simulate	 randomization.	 Given exactly	 the	 same	 inputs	 and	 internal	 state,	 a	 computer	 will	 always	 produce exactly	the	same	outputs.	 Turing,	1948   Despite	these	logical	limitations	to	randomization,	computers	can	be	very effective	 at	 pseudorandom	 number	 generation.	 Two	 criteria	 are	 often	 used	 to judge	 the	 effectiveness	 of	 a	 PRNG:	 the	 randomness	 of	 the	 algorithm	 and	 the security	of	the	PRNG	algorithm.	An	algorithm	can	be	very	random,	but	is	not necessarily	 cryptographically	 secure.	 For	 AI,	 we	 care	 primarily	 about	 the randomness	 of	 an	 algorithm.	 Security	 is	 more	 important	 for	 an	 encryption algorithm.	A	secure	PRNG	is	called	a	Cryptographically	Secure	Pseudorandom Number	Generator	 CSPRNG .  Good	 randomness	 is	 defined	 by	 whether	 a	 PRNG’s	 period	 produces detectable	 repeating	 sequences	 within	 a	 period	 and	 how	 long	 the	 PRNG’s periods	 are.	 In	 this	 context,	 a	 period	 is	 the	 amount	 of	 random	 numbers	 that	 a PRNG	 can	 produce	 before	 it	 begins	 to	 repeat	 the	 sequence.	 Each	 period	 is essentially	a	string	of	numbers,	and	each	PRNG	compiles	a	series	of	identical periods.	 The	 larger	 the	 period,	 the	 more	 random	 a	 generator	 is.	 The	 fewer repeating	 sequences	 evident	 inside	 of	 a	 period	 there	 are,	 the	 more	 random	 a generator	is.  It	 is	 important	 to	 understand	 the	 distinction	 between	 regular	 PRNGs	 and CSPRNGs.	All	PRNGs	and	CSPRNGs	have	an	internal	state.	If	you	know	the internal	state	of	the	generator,	you	will	know	what	the	next	random	number	will  SH   be.	 PRNGs	 and	 CSPRNGs	 can	 both	 potentially	 produce	 high	 quality	 random number	 sequences.	 The	 primary	 difference	 between	 PRNGs	 and	 CSPRNGs	 is that	 you	 can	 typically	 determine	 a	 PRNG’s	 internal	 state	 by	 analyzing	 the numbers.	 However,	 you	 cannot	 determine	 a	 CSPRNG’s	 internal	 state	 in	 a reasonable	amount	of	time.	This	distinction	is	critical	for	cryptology,	but	is	not as	important	for	AI.	In	AI,	the	quality	of	the	numbers	is	most	important,	while the	numbers’	likelihood	of	providing	information	about	the	algorithm’s	internal state	is	of	less	importance.  SH   PRNG	Concepts  There	 are	 several	 important	 concepts	 that	 nearly	 all	 PRNGs	 share.	 These define	how	the	PRNG	performs	and	what	its	expected	output	can	be.	Common concepts	that	all	PRNGs	share	include	the	following: 	  Seed Internal	State Period  The	seed	defines	the	sequence	of	random	numbers	you	will	get,	as	well	as the	 initial	 internal	 state.	 You	 should	 always	 get	 the	 same	 sequence	 of	 random numbers	 for	 the	 same	 given	 seed,	 and	 nearly	 every	 seed	 should	 produce	 a different	sequence	of	random	numbers.  The	internal	state	comprises	the	variables	that	the	PRGN	uses	to	produce both	the	random	numbers	and	the	next	internal	state.	If	you	know	the	internal state	 and	 the	 type	 of	 PRGN	 or	 CSPRNG	 algorithm,	 you	 can	 predict	 the	 next random	number.  The	length	of	each	random	number	sequence	is	the	period.	Once	the	period is	 up,	 the	 random	 PRGN	 will	 repeat.	 That	 is	 why	 the	 PRGN	 is	 considered	 a periodic	 function—because	 it	 repeats	 its	 values	 at	 regular	 intervals	 or	 periods. Figure	 4.1	 shows	 the	 sine	 function,	 which	 is	 perhaps	 the	 most	 well-known periodic	function.  Figure	4.1:	The	Sine	Function	is	Periodic  SH   As	 you	 can	 see	 from	 the	 above	 figure,	 the	 sine	 function	 has	 a	 period	 of  2*PI,	or	approximately	6.18.  SH   Random	Distribution	Types  You	 will	 usually	 want	 your	 random	 numbers	 to	 be	 uniformly	 distributed. PRNGs	 typically	 provide	 a	 random	 number	 between	 0	 and	 1,	 with	 equal probability	of	getting	any	particular	number	in	that	range.	You	can	see	the	results of	generating	a	large	number	of	random	numbers	between	0	and	1	in	Figure	4.2, which	shows	a	uniform	distribution	of	random	numbers.  Figure	4.2:	Uniform	Distribution	of	Random	Numbers  As	 you	 can	 see	 from	 figure	 4.2	 above,	 the	 random	 numbers	 are	 evenly distributed	between	0	and	1.	This	is	called	a	uniform	distribution,	or	a	uniform random	 number.	 It	 provides	 equal	 probability	 of	 getting	 any	 option	 within	 the specified	range.  Most	 programming	 languages	 provide	 a	 means	 to	 generate	 uniformly distributed	random	numbers	between	0	and	1.	You	can	scale	this	random	number out	to	whatever	range	you	desire.	This	works	very	similarly	to	normalization.	If the	function	rand  	returns	a	random	number	between	0	and	1,	then	equation	4.1 scales	it	to	a	range	between	high	and	low.  Equation	4.1:	Random	Numbers	in	a	Range  The	above	equation	allows	you	to	generate	a	random	number	in	any	range.  SH   Some	programming	languages	also	provide	a	means	to	generate	a	normally distributed	random	number.	Figure	4.3	shows	such	normally	distributed	random numbers.  Figure	4.3:	Normal	Distribution	of	Random	Numbers  The	random	numbers	with	the	greatest	probability	are	clustered	around	0. There	 is	 really	 no	 defined	 upper	 and	 lower	 bound.	 Each	 whole	 number represents	a	standard	deviation.	As	the	standard	deviations	increase	on	both	the positive	 and	 negative	 sides,	 the	 probability	 of	 getting	 a	 random	 number decreases	 greatly.	 Beyond	 4	 or	 -4,	 it	 is	 very	 rare	 to	 get	 a	 number.	 Normally distributed	random	numbers	are	often	useful	when	you	want	to	vary	a	number	by a	small	random	amount.  Not	 all	 programming	 languages	 support	 normally	 distributed	 random  numbers,	however.	The	functions	that	support	these	PRNGs	are	listed	here.  C 				Uniform:	Random.NextDouble 				Normal:	NA C C++ 				Uniform:	rand 				Normal:	NA Java 				Uniform:	Random.NextDouble 				Normal:	Random.nextGaussian Python 				Uniform:	random.random 				Normal:	random.randn R 				Uniform:	runif  SH   				Normal:	rnorm  If	your	language	does	not	support	normal	distributions,	you	can	use	the	Box Muller	transformation	to	transform	uniformly	distributed	random	numbers	into normally	distributed	random	numbers.	Box	Muller	is	discussed	at	length	later	in this	chapter.  SH   Roulette	Wheels  Another	 popular	 random	 number	 technique	 is	 called	 the	 roulette	 wheel  Back,	 1996 .	 This	 technique	 only	 bears	 a	 slight	 resemblance	 to	 an	 actual roulette	wheel,	as	seen	in	a	casino.	Roulette	wheels	are	useful	when	you	would like	to	choose	between	three	or	more	categories.	For	example,	consider	if	you wanted	to	create	a	robot	to	randomly	explore	a	grid	and	your	robot	can	perform only	the	following	three	actions: 	  Move	forward Turn	left Turn	right  Although	 the	 robot	 moves	 randomly,	 you	 might	 not	 want	 an	 even distribution	among	these	three	directions.	You	might	want	the	robot	to	move	as follows: 	  Move	forward	 80%	of	the	time  Turn	left	 10%	of	the	time  Turn	right	 10%	of	the	time   Such	 a	 random	 number	 generation	 is	 relatively	 easy	 to	 implement.	 You must	order	these	choices	so	that	they	each	share	part	of	the	0	to	1	range	that	a uniform	PRNG	will	generate	numbers	for.  If	x	is	the	random	number,	then	the	following	list	defines	our	actions.  if	0<x<0.8	then	move	forward if	0.8<x<0.9	then	turn	left if	0.9<x<1.0	then	turn	right  The	first	line	is	needed	because	x	will	be	below	0.8	in	80%	of	the	cases. The	second	line	is	needed	because	x	will	be	between	0.8	and	0.9	in	10%	of	the cases.	Likewise,	x	will	be	between	0.9	and	1.0	in	10%	of	the	cases.  SH   PRNG	Algorithms  There	 are	 many	 different	 PRNG	 algorithms.	 Often,	 there	 is	 a	 tradeoff between	 execution	 speed	 and	 randomness.	 Some	 algorithms	 are	 simply	 better than	 others.	 In	 this	 section,	 we	 will	 review	 some	 of	 the	 PRNG	 algorithms. Finally,	 we	 will	 review	 the	 Box	 Muller	 transformation.	 Box	 Muller	 is	 not	 a PRNG	algorithm,	but	it	can	take	the	output	of	a	uniform	PRNG	algorithm	and produce	normally	distributed	random	numbers.  Performance	is	another	very	important	consideration	for	PRNG	selection. Most	AI	algorithms	require	a	very	large	quantity	of	random	numbers.	Random number	 generation	 can	 thus	 be	 a	 very	 important	 consideration	 that	 affects	 the overall	efficiency	of	the	algorithm.  It	 is	 not	 critical	 that	 you	 understand	 how	 all	 of	 the	 PRNG	 algorithms function	internally.	You	can	make	use	of	the	random	numbers	generated	by	an algorithm	without	learning	the	algorithm’s	internal	details.  The	PRNG	algorithms	covered	in	this	book	are	as	follows:  	  Linear	Congruential	Generator	 LCG  Multiply	With	Carry	 MWC  Mersenne	Twister  Different	 programming	 languages	 will	 use	 different	 PRNG	 algorithms.	 If your	programming	language	does	not	use	the	algorithm	you	desire,	the	algorithm can	be	implemented	separately	in	that	language.  Linear	Congruential	Generator  The	 Linear	 Congruential	 Generator	  LCG 	 is	 one	 of	 the	 oldest	 and	 most common	PRNG	algorithms	in	use.	LCG	is	the	built-in	PRNG	for	C C++,	Java, and	 C.	 LCG	 is	 documented	 in	 Donald	 Knuth’s	 The	 Art	 of	 Programming, Section	3.2.1.	 Knuth,	1997 .	LCGs	should	not	be	used	for	applications	where high	 quality	 randomness	 is	 needed.	 LCG	 is	 not	 typically	 useful	 for	 a	 Monte Carlo	 simulation	 because	 of	 the	 serial	 correlation.	 Serial	 correlation	 is	 the relation	of	a	variable	to	itself	over	time.	This	means	LCG	random	numbers	are  SH   not	high	quality,	nor	are	they	suitable	for	cryptographic	applications.  LCG	 is	 straightforward	 to	 implement	 and	 understand.	 It	 is	 implemented through	a	linear	function	clipped	into	a	defined	period.	The	equation	for	LCG	is shown	in	Equation	4.2.  Equation	4.2:	Random	Numbers	in	a	Range  The	variables	and	acceptable	ranges	for	the	above	equation	are	defined	as  follows:  m,	0	<	m,	The	modulus a,	0	<	a	<	m,	The	multiplier c,	0	<=	c	<	m,	The	increment X0,	0	<=	X0	<	m,	The	seed,	or	starting	value  The	seed	value	is	updated	with	each	random	number	generated.	For	LCG, the	next	seed	is	the	internal	state.	These	random	numbers	will	be	integers.	They can	be	converted	into	the	0	to	1	range	by	dividing	the	random	numbers	by	the maximum	 integer	 that	 the	 algorithm	 can	 produce.	 The	 maximum	 integer produced	will	depend	on	the	settings	of	m,	a,	and	c.  The	 values	 chosen	 for	 m,	 a,	 and	 c	 will	 have	 a	 great	 impact	 on	 the randomness	of	the	numbers	generated	by	the	PRNG.	Typically,	you	should	not choose	values	of	your	own	for	m,	a,	and	c.	Much	research	has	gone	into	finding optimal	 values.	 Wikipedia	 has	 a	 very	 good	 summary	 of	 the	 values	 used	 by various	PRNGs. http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Linear_congruential_generator  I	typically	use	the	values	used	by	the	GCC	compiler.  m	=	2e31 a	=	1103515245 c	=	12345  a	better	alternative.  Multiply	with	Carry  While	LCG	is	a	very	commonly	used	PRNG,	the	Mersenne	Twister	is	often  The	Multiply	with	Carry	 MWC 	PRNG	was	invented	by	George	Marsaglia  SH   for	the	purpose	of	generating	sequences	of	random	integers	with	large	periods.  Marsaglia,	 1991 	 It	 uses	 an	 initial	 seed	 set	 from	 two	 to	 many	 thousands	 of randomly	chosen	values.	The	main	advantages	of	the	MWC	method	are	that	it invokes	simple	computer	integer	arithmetic	and	leads	to	very	fast	generation	of sequences	 of	 random	 numbers.	 MWC	 has	 immense	 periods,	 ranging	 from around	260	to	2	to	the	power	of	2000000.  MWC	works	somewhat	similarly	to	LCG.	Assuming	32	bit	registers,	LCG uses	 only	 the	 lower	 32	 bits	 of	 the	 multiplication	  Equation	 4.2 .	 MWC	 makes use	of	these	higher	bits	through	a	carry.	Additionally,	multiple	seed	values	are used.	 These	 seed	 values	 are	 typically	 created	 with	 another	 PRNG	 algorithm, such	as	LCG.  We	 must	 first	 define	 a	 variable	 r	 to	 describe	 the	 “lag”	 of	 the	 MWC.	 We must	 provide	 a	 number	 of	 seed	 values	 equal	 to	 r.	 Like	 the	 LCG	 algorithm  Equation	4.2 ,	we	also	have	a	modulus	and	a	multiplier.	However,	there	is	no increment	 in	 this	 case.	 The	 equation	 used	 to	 generate	 the	 random	 integers	 for MWC	is	shown	in	Equation	4.3.  Equation	4.3:	Calculate	Random	Integer	 MWC   The	multiplier	is	represented	by	a,	while	the	modulus	is	represented	by	b. There	is	an	additional	variable	c,	which	represents	the	carry.	The	calculation	for the	carry	is	shown	in	Equation	4.4.  Equation	4.4:	MWC	Calculate	C  The	variable	n	represents	the	number	in	the	sequence	you	are	calculating.	It is	important	that	n	always	be	greater	than	r.	This	is	because	the	x	values	before n	are	the	seed	values,	and	we	have	r	seeds.  Equation	4.4	is	very	similar	to	4.3,	but	while	4.3	uses	the	modulus	operator to	 return	 the	 remainder,	 4.4	 actually	 carries	 out	 the	 division.	 We	 then	 use	 the floor	of	this	result	as	the	carry.	The	floor	is	the	largest	integer	part	of	a	number. For	example,	the	floor	of	7.3	would	be	7.	However,	the	floor	of	-7.3	would	be	-8. The	floor	of	-7	would	be	-7.  The	reason	that	we	use	the	floor	operator	in	Equation	4.4	is	to	ensure	an  SH   integer	result.	Typically	these	operations	are	carried	out	on	integer	variables	so the	 floor	 operator	 is	 given	 to	 make	 Equation	 4.4	 mathematically	 correct.	 The code	examples	for	MWC	do	not	make	use	of	a	call	to	the	floor	function.  The	 MWC	 generator	 has	 a	 much	 larger	 period	 than	 LCG,	 and	 its implementations	 are	 typically	 very	 fast	 to	 execute.	 It	 is	 an	 improvement	 over LCG,	 but	 it	 is	 not	 a	 commonly	 used	 generator.	 It	 is	 not	 the	 default	 random number	generator	for	any	computer	language	that	I	am	aware	of.  Mersenne	Twister  The	 Mersenne	 Twister	 is	 a	 PRNG	 developed	 in	 1997	 by	 Makoto Matsumoto	 and	 Takuji	 Nishimura.	 It	 provides	 for	 fast	 generation	 of	 very	 high quality	pseudorandom	integers.	The	Mersenne	Twister	was	designed	specifically to	address	many	of	the	flaws	found	in	older	algorithms.	 Matsumoto,	1998   The	Mersenne	Twister	is	a	very	popular	PRNG.	It	is	the	“built	in”	PRNG for	Ruby,	Python,	and	R.	This	book’s	examples	also	contain	implementations	for other	 languages.	 The	 Mersenne	 Twister	 algorithm	 creates	 high	 quality	 random numbers	 suitable	 for	 Monte	 Carlo	 simulations.	 Mersenne	 Twister	 is	 not	 a cryptographically	 secure	 generator.	 However,	 its	 execution	 speed	 and	 high quality	randomness	make	it	a	very	attractive	generator	for	AI.  The	name	Mersenne	Twister	comes	from	the	fact	that	that	the	period	of	the  Mersenne	Twister	is	always	chosen	to	be	a	Mersenne	prime	number.  A	prime	number	is	any	number	that	can	only	be	divided	evenly	by	itself	and one.	 For	 example,	 5	 is	 a	 prime	 number.	 A	 Mersenne	 prime	 number	 is	 any number	n	where	M	is	also	a	prime	number,	as	seen	in	Equation	4.5.  Equation	4.5:	Mersenne	Prime	Numbers  To	see	how	this	works,	consider	5,	which	is	a	Mersenne	prime	number.  2^5	=	32 32	-	1	=	31  The	number	31	is	prime,	so	the	number	5	is	a	Mersenne	prime	number.	You  can	find	a	list	of	the	known	Mersenne	prime	numbers	at	the	following	URL. http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Mersenne_prime  SH   Some	other	Mersenne	primes	are	shown	below.  2 3 5 7 13 17 19 31 61 89 107 127 521 607 1,279 2,203 2,281 3,217 4,253 4,423	 Wikipedia,	2013   The	Mersenne	Twister	algorithm’s	implementation	is	much	more	complex than	the	algorithms	already	described	in	this	chapter,	and	a	full	description	of	it is	 beyond	 the	 scope	 of	 this	 book.	 The	 code	 examples	 do	 contain	 an implementation	of	the	Mersenne	Twister	based	on	the	original	C	implementation provided	by	Matsumoto.  One	 of	 the	 more	 tricky	 aspects	 of	 implementing	 the	 Mersenne	 Twister	 is that	it	relies	on	bit	shifts.	This	can	be	tricky	for	languages	that	do	not	support unsigned	 numbers.	 Java’s	 non-support	 of	 unsigned	 numbers	 makes	 a	 Java implementation	particularly	tricky.	For	other	languages,	it	is	important	to	make sure	that	the	variable	sizes	match	the	original	C	code.  Box	Muller	Transformation  Not	all	programming	languages	support	the	generation	of	random	numbers in	a	normal	distribution.	You	might	also	be	using	a	custom	PRNG	not	provided by	 your	 programming	 language.	 There	 is	 an	 algorithm	 that	 can	 transform	 a continuous	 random	 number	 distribution	 into	 a	 normal	 one.	 This	 algorithm	 is called	the	Box	Muller	Transformation.	 Box,	1958   The	 following	 pseudo	 code	 can	 be	 used	 to	 transform	 regular	 continuous  SH   random	 numbers	 into	 normal	 random	 numbers.	  Ross,	 2009 	 The	 Box	 Muller Transformation	generates	numbers	two	at	a	time.	To	keep	track	of	the	pairs,	we will	place	the	two	numbers	into	y1	and	y2.	We	will	use	the	variable	useLast	to track	if	there	is	a	value	in	y2	waiting	to	be	used.	The	variable	y1	will	ultimately be	returned,	so	if	useLast	is	set	to	true,	then	move	y2	into	y1.  Begin	by	generating	x1	and	y1,	both	in	the	range	-1	to	1.	Because	rand   normally	returns	0	to	1,	we	scale	x1	and	y1.	We	then	square	and	sum	both	x1	and y1,	giving	w.	We	continue	until	we	have	a	w	that	is	greater	than	or	equal	to	1.0.  if	 useLast 	 { 		y1	=	y2; 		useLast	=	false; }	else	 {  do	 { 		x1	=	2.0	*	rand  	-	1.0; 		x2	=	2.0	*	rand  	-	1.0; 		w	=	x1	*	x1	+	x2	*	x2; }	while	 w	>=	1.0 ; w=	sqrt  -2.0	*	log w  	 	w ;  Box	 Muller	 works	 by	 calculating	 two	 independent	 uniform	 distributions, stored	in	x1	and	x2.	A	scaling	factor	w	is	calculated	across	them;	it	allows	x1 and	x2	to	be	converted	into	a	normally	distributed	random	number.  	y1	=	x1	*	w; 	y2	=	x2	*	w; 	useLast	=	true; }  return	Y1;  function	will	return	y2.  We	scale	both	x1	and	x2,	storing	the	results	in	y1	and	y2.  We	 immediately	 return	 y1	 and	 set	 useLast	 to	 true.	 The	 next	 call	 to	 the  SH   Estimating	PI	with	Monte	Carlo  Monte	Carlo	algorithms	attempt	to	estimate	through	random	sampling,	as	it can	be	time	intensive	to	calculate	the	actual	value.	Monte	Carlo	makes	use	of random	 samples	 to	 generate	 a	 good	 estimate.	 There	 are	 many	 different	 Monte Carlo	 techniques,	 some	 of	 which	 are	 hybrids	 between	 Monte	 Carlo	 and	 other techniques.	  Robert,	 2005 	 Later	 in	 this	 book,	 we	 will	 learn	 a	 Monte	 Carlo method	called	Simulated	Annealing.  One	 simple	 example	 of	 Monte	 Carlo	 is	 its	 estimation	 of	 the	 value	 of	 PI.  Figure	4.4	shows	a	circle	perfectly	inscribed	inside	of	a	square.  Figure	4.4:	A	Circle	Inscribed	in	a	Square  SH   We	will	now	place	random	points	inside	of	the	square	and	circle.	The	ratio of	points	inside	to	outside	will	tell	us	the	value	of	PI.	The	area	of	the	square	is	its length	multiplied	by	its	width.	Because	a	square	has	the	same	width	as	length, the	area	of	the	square	is	essentially	the	width	times	itself,	or	width	squared.  A	circle’s	area	is	PI	times	its	radius	squared.	The	diameter	of	the	circle	is the	same	as	the	width	of	the	square.	We	will	calculate	the	ratio	of	the	area	of	the circle	to	the	square	by	using	Equation	4.6.  Equation	4.6:	Ratio	of	a	Square	and	Circle  SH   The	width	of	the	square	is	the	same	as	two	times	the	circle’s	radius.	So	we can	describe	the	square’s	diameter	as	two	times	the	radius	squared.	We	will	take the	ratio	of	points	inside	the	circle	to	outside	and	multiply	by	4.	This	will	give	us an	approximation	of	PI.  The	pseudo	code	to	produce	this	is	shown	below.  tries	=	0; success	=	0; for	i	from	0	to	10000	 { 	  	pick	a	point	at	random. 	x	=	rand  ; 	y	=	rand  ; 	tries	=	ties	+	1; 	  	was	the	point	inside	of	a	circle? 	if	 x	*	x	+	y	*	y	<=	1  	{ 	success++; 	} } pi	=	4	*	success	 	tries;  As	we	consider	more	points	we	gain	a	more	accurate	approximation	of	PI.  SH   Chapter	Summary  Random	numbers	are	very	useful	to	AI	programs,	particularly	Monte	Carlo simulations.	A	number	of	different	random	number	generation	algorithms	exist. All	are	called	pseudorandom	number	generators	 PRNG .	These	random	number generators	vary	in	their	ability	to	produce	quality	random	numbers.  Some	 PRNGs	 are	 said	 to	 be	 cryptographically	 secure	  CSPRNG .	 A random	number	generator	may	produce	high	quality	random	numbers,	yet	not	be cryptographically	 secure.	 CSPRNG	 implies	 that	 the	 internal	 state	 of	 the algorithm	cannot	easily	be	guessed	by	observing	the	output	of	the	algorithm.	It	is not	necessary	to	have	a	CSPRNG	for	AI	applications.	For	AI,	we	are	primarily interested	 in	 obtaining	 high	 quality	 random	 numbers	 and	 less	 interested	 in ensuring	that	these	numbers	do	not	reveal	the	internal	state	of	the	algorithm.  One	 of	 the	 earliest	 and	 most	 common	 PRNG	 algorithms	 is	 the	 Linear Congruential	 Generator	  LCG .	 While	 LCG	 can	 produce	 decent	 random numbers,	the	quality	is	not	good	enough	for	Monte	Carlo	simulations.	Multiply with	 Carry	  MWC 	 was	 created	 to	 overcome	 some	 of	 the	 limitations	 of	 LCG. The	 Mersenne	 Twister	 algorithm	 quickly	 produces	 high	 quality	 random numbers.	Mersenne	Twister	is	acceptable	for	a	Monte	Carlo	simulation.  A	 Monte	 Carlo	 simulation	 estimates	 a	 large	 problem	 by	 sampling	 small pieces	of	it.	In	this	chapter,	we	saw	that	we	could	estimate	PI	using	Monte	Carlo. We	 looked	 at	 a	 circle	 that	 was	 perfectly	 inscribed	 inside	 of	 a	 square.	 We randomly	chose	points	and	determined	what	points	were	inside	of	the	circle	and what	were	not.	The	ratio	of	these	two	point	sets	told	us	the	value	of	PI.  The	last	two	chapters	introduced	distance	calculation	and	random	numbers. The	 next	 chapter	 will	 show	 us	 an	 algorithm	 that	 combines	 both	 techniques.	 It will	 show	 how	 observations	 can	 be	 divided	 into	 similar	 groups	 based	 on	 their distances	 from	 each	 other.	 K-Means	 clustering	 is	 one	 common	 technique	 for performing	such	divisions.  SH   Chapter	5:	K-Means	Clustering 	  Clustering Centroid Unsupervised	Training K-Means  In	previous	chapters	we	saw	that	the	input	to	a	machine-learning	algorithm is	typically	a	vector	of	floating	point	numbers.	Each	of	these	vectors	is	called	an observation,	 while	 the	 individual	 numbers	 that	 make	 up	 the	 vectors	 are	 called features.  In	this	chapter	we	will	learn	about	clustering.	Clustering	is	the	process	of placing	 together	 observations	 with	 similar	 features,	 and	 thereby	 creating	 a cluster.  Clustering	is	a	very	useful	means	of	breaking	observations	into	a	specified number	of	groups.	Most	clustering	algorithms	require	you	to	specify	the	number of	groups	beforehand.	Some	clustering	algorithms	can	automatically	determine an	optimal	number	of	groups.	This	chapter	focuses	on	the	K-Means	algorithm.  The	process	of	clustering	a	finite	number	of	observations	into	a	specified number	 of	 clusters	 is	 called	 NP-Hard.	 NP-Hard	 is	 an	 abbreviation	 for	 non- deterministic	polynomial-time.	Informally,	NP-Hard	can	be	defined	as	problems that	cannot	be	solved	via	a	brute	force	search,	when	there	are	simply	too	many different	 combinations	 to	 search	 every	 potential	 solution	 to	 a	 problem. Clustering	a	non-trivial	number	of	observations	is	NP-Hard.  K-Means	 makes	 use	 of	 random	 numbers	 to	 search	 for	 an	 acceptable clustering	arrangement	for	the	observations.	Because	the	algorithm	is	based	on random	 numbers,	 K-Means	 is	 said	 to	 be	 nondeterministic.	 This	 means	 that multiple	 runs	 of	 the	 K-Means	 algorithm	 will	 result	 in	 different	 assignment	 of observations	to	clusters.  The	opposite	of	a	nondeterministic	algorithm	is	a	deterministic	algorithm. Deterministic	 algorithms	 always	 produce	 the	 same	 output,	 given	 consistent input.	Nearly	all	of	the	algorithms	presented	in	this	book	are	nondeterministic.  Clustering	can	be	used	both	independently	and	as	a	component	to	a	larger machine-learning	 algorithm.	 Independently,	 clustering	 can	 be	 used	 to	 place  SH   similar	 items	 into	 groups.	 For	 example,	 you	 may	 have	 a	 large	 amount	 of observations	that	represent	the	buying	habits	of	individuals.	If	each	observation represents	 a	 customer,	 customers	 can	 be	 clustered.	 This	 allows	 you	 to	 make suggestive	sales	to	customers	based	on	what	other	customers	in	the	same	cluster have	purchased.  Genetic	 algorithms	 that	 use	 speciation	 often	 make	 use	 of	 clustering	 as	 a component	of	the	genetic	algorithm.	Genetic	algorithms	find	solutions	following a	 process	 that	 is	 loosely	 modeled	 after	 Darwinian	 evolution.	  Banzhaf,	 1998  Potential	solutions	to	a	problem	compete	with	each	other	and	reproduce	to	create potentially	better	solutions	that	carry	the	desirable	traits	from	the	parents.	Often it	 is	 desirable	 to	 break	 the	 potential	 solutions	 into	 species	 and	 only	 allow breeding	within	a	species.	Because	the	potential	solutions	are	often	vectors,	K- Means	can	be	used	to	speciate	the	potential	solutions.	 Green,	2009   The	K-Means	algorithm	has	been	around,	in	various	forms,	since	the	1950s. This	algorithm	has	gone	through	a	number	of	revisions	by	various	researchers. James	MacQueen	first	used	the	term	“K-Means”	in	1967.	The	actual	idea	for	K- Means	 goes	 back	 to	 Hugo	 Steinhaus	 in	 1957.	 Stuart	 Lloyd	 first	 proposed	 the standard	 algorithm	 in	 1957	 at	 Bell	 labs.	 However,	 his	 work	 wasn't	 published outside	Bell	labs	until	1982.	In	1965,	E.	W.	Forgy	published	essentially	the	same method,	which	is	why	it	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	the	Lloyd-Forgy	algorithm. A	more	efficient	version	was	proposed	and	published	in	Fortran	by	Hartigan	and Wong	in	1975	and	revised	in	1979.  SH   Understanding	Training	Sets  Sets	 of	 observations	 are	 usually	 grouped	 into	 large	 collections	 called training	sets.	This	data	is	used	to	train	the	machine-learning	algorithm.	Training is	 the	 process	 where	 the	 machine-learning	 algorithm	 is	 modified	 so	 that	 the output	from	the	algorithm	provides	the	desired	information.  There	are	two	very	broad	classes	of	machine	learning	algorithm	that	take very	 different	 types	 of	 training	 sets.	 Training	 is	 either	 supervised	 or unsupervised.	 When	 performing	 unsupervised	 the algorithm	with	an	input	observation	as	a	vector.	However,	you	do	not	specify	an output	vector	that	represents	the	expected,	or	ideal,	output.	Clustering	is	a	type of	unsupervised	training.  training,	 you	 provide	  Unsupervised	Training  Recall	the	iris	data	set	used	in	previous	chapters?	The	iris	data	set	has	been applied	to	many	different	machine-learning	algorithms.	It	can	be	used	for	both supervised	and	unsupervised	training.	This	section	shows	how	the	iris	data	set can	be	applied	to	both.  First,	 we	 will	 take	 a	 look	 at	 how	 we	 would	 present	 the	 iris	 data	 set	 for unsupervised	clustering.	Recall	that	the	iris	data	set	consists	of	four	individual ratio	 observations	 about	 the	 dimensions	 of	 the	 iris	 petals.	 Additionally,	 the species	of	the	iris	is	specified.	Listing	5.1	shows	a	sampling	from	the	iris	data set.  Listing	5.1:	Several	Rows	from	the	Iris	Data	Set  5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa ... 7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,Iris-versicolor 6.4,3.2,4.5,1.5,Iris-versicolor ... 6.3,3.3,6.0,2.5,Iris-virginica 5.8,2.7,5.1,1.9,Iris-virginica  SH   For	 an	 unsupervised	 clustering,	 we	 would	 most	 likely	 use	 the	 first	 four measurements	 and	 ignore	 the	 species.	 We	 might	 tag	 the	 observations	 to	 the species,	 perhaps	 for	 later	 comparison.	 However,	 the	 clustering	 algorithm	 does not	 need	 to	 know	 the	 species,	 because	 this	 is	 unsupervised	 training.	 The algorithm	will	not	aim	to	determine	what	species	the	iris	is,	but	will	rather	place the	observations	into	clusters	based	on	similarities	among	the	observations.  It	 is	 also	 important	 to	 note	 that	 it	 is	 not	 necessary	 to	 normalize	 the	 four observations.	 K-Means	 clustering	 does	 not	 inherently	 require	 normalization. Some	other	algorithms	will	require	normalization,	of	course.	For	clustering	the iris	data	set,	normalization	is	optional.	You	should	only	use	clustering	with	K- Means	if	one	or	more	of	the	features	are	so	large	that	it	might	overwhelm	the others.	 The	 four	 ratio	 features	 of	 the	 iris	 data	 set	 are	 all	 reasonably	 close	 in value,	so	K-Means	clustering	is	not	necessary	in	this	case.  The	 iris	 data	 set	 does	 not	 have	 enough	 information	 expressed	 in	 the	 four ratio	features	to	properly	cluster	it	by	species.	This	is	okay.	For	clustering,	we are	really	trying	to	visualize	how	close	observations	are	and	what	clusters	they might	fall	into.  Figure	5.1	shows	one	attempt	to	cluster	the	iris	data	set.  Figure	5.1:	Iris	Data	Set	Clustered  SH   It	will	take	some	explanation	to	show	what	Figure	5.1	depicts,	as	there	is quite	a	bit	going	on	in	this	graph.	The	clusters	are	shown	by	color.	They	are	also circled,	for	the	benefit	of	those	viewing	this	in	black	and	white	media.	You	can see	that	there	are	three	clusters:	red,	green,	and	blue.  Each	 point	 is	 designated	 one	 of	 three	 total	 characters,	 which	 are	 pluses, asterisks,	and	O’s.	The	character	type	indicates	the	species,	as	specified	by	the file	in	Listing	5.1.	If	the	clustering	algorithm	were	able	to	correctly	cluster	the iris	species,	each	character	of	the	same	type	would	be	the	same	color.	If	you	look at	Figure	5.1,	you	will	see	that	this	is	not	the	case.  While	you	can	see	that	the	clusters	are	clearly	defined,	they	do	not	line	up with	 the	 species.	 This	 is	 mostly	 unavoidable.	 K-Means	 will	 sometimes	 come closer	to	picking	the	species,	due	to	its	random	nature.	However,	if	you	look	at Figure	5.1,	you	will	see	that	two	regions	are	linearly	separable.	This	means	you could	draw	a	line	between	them.	However,	two	of	the	iris	species	are	not	linearly separable.	There	is	overlap.	It	would	be	impossible	for	unsupervised	clustering  SH   alone	to	find	the	separation	between	these	two	species.  You	may	be	wondering	how	the	four	dimensional	iris	vectors	were	drawn on	 a	 two	 dimensional	 graph.	 I	 used	 R	 to	 reduce	 the	 dimensions	 to	 two	 for graphing	 purposes.	 Dimension	 reduction	 is	 a	 common	 technique	 for	 data visualization,	and	was	done	using	R’s	cmdscale	function.  Supervised	Training  Supervised	 training	 is	 more	 restricted	 than	 unsupervised.	 A	 supervised training	set	consists	of	pairs	of	input	and	ideal	output	data.	For	the	iris	data	set, you	 would	 input	 the	 four	 ratio	 measurement	 observations	 as	 a	 four	 dimension input	vector.	You	would	likely	use	one-of-n	encoding	to	encode	the	species	data into	an	ideal	output	vector.	The	machine-learning	algorithm	would	be	rated	on how	well	it	produced	the	expected	output	vector,	given	the	input	vector.	We	will use	supervised	training	with	the	iris	data	later	in	this	book.  SH   Understanding	the	K-Means	Algorithm  The	 K-Means	 algorithm	 is	 relatively	 simple	 to	 implement.	 It	 works	 by assigning	 observations	 into	 a	 set	 number	 of	 clusters.	 There	 are	 three	 distinct steps	to	the	K-Means	algorithm:	 Russel,	2009  	  Initialization	Step Assignment	Step Update	Step  There	 are	 two	 different	 means	 by	 which	 the	 initialization	 step	 can	 be accomplished.	 Hamerly,	2002 	These	two	initialization	methods	will	be	covered after	we	cover	the	other	two	steps.	For	now,	just	assume	that	the	observations	are initially	assigned	to	the	clusters	by	some	means.  Assignment	Step  The	assignment	and	update	steps	are	repeated	until	no	observation	moves	to a	new	cluster.	Each	cluster	is	defined	by	two	aspects.	The	first	is	its	centroid, which	 is	 a	 vector	 of	 the	 same	 length	 as	 the	 observation.	 It	 is	 essentially	 an observation	itself,	but	in	fact	represents	the	average	of	all	observations	inside	the cluster.	 The	 centroid	 is	 thus	 essentially	 the	 point	 that	 is	 at	 the	 center	 of	 all observations	 in	 a	 cluster.	 In	 addition	 to	 a	 centroid,	 each	 cluster	 holds	 a	 list	 of observations	assigned	to	that	cluster.  The	assignment	step	loops	over	all	of	the	observations	and	assigns	them	to the	cluster	that	has	the	nearest	centroid.	By	nearest,	I	mean	the	shortest	distance between	the	two	vectors.	Typically,	the	Euclidean	distance	is	used;	however,	any of	the	distance	algorithms	from	the	last	chapter	would	work.  It	 is	 also	 important	 for	 the	 update	 step	 to	 keep	 track	 of	 whether	 any observation	 moves	 from	 one	 cluster	 to	 another.	 This	 allows	 the	 K-Means algorithm	to	know	when	the	algorithm	is	complete.	If	no	observations	move	to	a new	cluster,	then	the	K-Means	algorithm	is	considered	complete.  The	 pseudo	 code	 for	 the	 assignment	 step	 is	 shown	 here.	 First,	 we	 set	 a variable	named	done	to	true.	 We	 start	 out	 assuming	 that	 we	 are	 done.	 If	 any  SH   observation	is	reassigned	from	one	cluster	to	another,	we	will	set	done	to	false.  done	=	true  We	 must	 now	 check	 each	 cluster	 and	 determine	 whether	 that	 cluster’s observations	might	need	to	be	moved	to	another	cluster.	We	do	not	keep	a	list	of observations;	the	observations	“live”	inside	of	clusters.  We	now	loop	over	every	observation	in	the	current	cluster	and	reassign	if  foreach	 cluster	in	clusters 	 {  necessary.  	foreach observation	in	cluster 	 	{  Find	 what	 cluster	  the	 observation.	 The findNearestCluster	 function	 simply	 finds	 the	 minimum	 Euclidean	 distance between	the	current	observation	and	the	centroids	of	all	the	clusters.  is	 currently	 closest	  to	  	targetCluster	=	findNearestCluster observation ;  If	 the	 targetCluster	 is	 not	 the	 current	 cluster,	 then	 a	 move	 must	 occur.  Perform	the	move	and	record	that	we	are	not	done	by	setting	done	to	false.  			if	 targetCluster	!=	cluster 	 			{ 					cluster.remove observation ; 					targetCluster.add observation ; 					done	=	false; 			} 	} } return	done;  Finally,	return	the	value	of	done	so	that	the	rest	of	the	program	can	decide	if  it	should	continue	iterating	or	exit.  Update	Step  The	update	step	is	executed	after	the	assignment	step.	These	two	steps	keep cycling	until	there	no	observations	change	clusters	during	the	assignment	step.  SH   Like	 many	 machine	 learning	 algorithms,	 K-Means	 is	 iterative.	 The	 training process	goes	through	a	large	number	of	iterations,	and	every	iteration	should	see some	 gradual	 improvement.	 At	 some	 point,	 each	 iteration	 brings	 little	 or	 no improvement.	This	is	when	an	iterative	algorithm	stops.  The	real	work	of	the	update	step	is	to	recalculate	the	centroids	for	each	of the	clusters.	During	the	previous	assignment	step,	it	is	likely	that	the	contents	of each	 cluster	 were	 changed.	 Because	 of	 this,	 the	 centroid	 for	 each	 cluster	 may have	become	invalid.	To	account	for	this,	we	need	to	recalculate	each	cluster’s centroid,	which	is	a	matter	of	simply	calculating	the	mean	of	each	feature	of	the observation.	For	example,	if	the	following	three	iris	flowers	were	all	in	a	cluster, we	 would	 need	 to	 calculate	 a	 mean	 vector	 of	 four	 dimensions.	 This	 mean becomes	the	centroid	for	the	cluster.  5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa 7.0,3.2,4.7,1.4,Iris-versicolor  This	vector	would	be	calculated	as	follows:  element1	=	 5.1	+	4.9	+	7.0 	 	3	=	5.7 element2	=	 3.5	+	3.0	+	3.2 	 	3	=	3.2 element3	=	 1.4	+	1.4	+	4.7 	 	3	=	2.5 element4	=	 0.2	+	0.2	+	1.4 	 3	=	0.6  Which	results	in	the	following	centroid:  [5.7,	3.2,	2.5,	0.6]  Of	course,	as	discussed	previously,	the	iris	species	column	is	not	used	by  the	algorithm.  SH   Initializing	the	K-Means	Algorithm  In	 the	 last	 few	 sections	 we	 saw	 how	 the	 assign	 and	 update	 steps	 were performed.	 Both	 of	 these	 operate	 on	 clusters	 that	 already	 have	 observations assigned	 to	 them.	 We	 must	 therefore	 start	 in	 a	 state	 where	 observations	 are assigned	to	clusters.  In	this	section	we	will	look	at	two	different	means	of	initializing	the	clusters randomly.	 The	 initialization	 step	 of	 K-Means	 is	 stochastic,	 or	 random.	 The update	and	assign	steps	are	both	deterministic.	However,	because	the	algorithm has	a	non-deterministic	beginning,	the	entire	algorithm	is	non-deterministic.  There	are	two	very	popular	means	of	initializing	the	K-Means	algorithm: the	 Random	 algorithm	 and	 the	 Forgy	 algorithm.	 The	 name	 of	 first	 method —“Random”—is	 a	 bit	 misleading,	 however,	 as	 both	 algorithms	 use	 random numbers.  Random	K-Means	Initialization  The	random	algorithm	is	very	simple.	You	simply	create	the	requested	K number	of	clusters	and	assign	random	observations	to	each	of	these	clusters.	It	is also	important	that	we	do	not	let	any	cluster	have	zero	observations.	Of	course, K	should	never	be	higher	than	the	number	of	observations.	That	is,	you	cannot cluster	 30	 observations	 into	 50	 clusters.	 It	 is	 also	 very	 important	 that	 the “random”	 initialization	 proceed	 directly	 to	 the	 update	 step.	 This	 allows	 the centroids	to	be	calculated	for	the	newly	created	clusters.  First,	we	calculate	the	number	of	dimensions	the	observations	have.	The	K- Means	 algorithm	 requires	 that	 each	 dimension	 contain	 the	 same	 number	 of dimensions.	This	is	simply	the	array	length.  dimensions	=	theObservations.length;  Next,	we	must	create	K	clusters.	We	loop	from	zero	up	to,	but	not	including  K.  for	i	from	0	to	K	 {  SH   	clusters.add new	Cluster dimensions  ; }  We	 must	 now	 assign	 each	 of	 the	 observations	 to	 a	 random	 cluster.	 First,  loop	over	all	observations	provided.  foreach	 observation	in	theObservations 	 {  Then,	pick	a	random	cluster.	Assign	a	random	integer	between	0	and	K-1.  Add	that	observation	to	the	cluster.  	clusterIndex	=	randInt K ; 	cluster	=	clusters[clusterIndex]; 	cluster.add observation ; }  to	them.  foreach	 cluster	in	this.clusters 	 { 	if	 cluster.length	==	0 	 	{  We	can	now	handle	any	clusters	that	might	have	no	observations	assigned  It	is	time	to	add	one	observation	to	this	cluster.	We	do	not	want	to	create another	zero	length	cluster	in	the	process	of	fixing	this	cluster,	however.	Find	a random	cluster	that	has	more	than	one	observation	already.	Make	sure	that	the chosen	cluster	is	not	the	same	cluster	as	that	we	are	trying	to	fill.  	done	=	false; 	while	 !done 	 	{ 			sourceIndex	=	randInt K ; 			source	=	clusters[sourceIndex]; 			if	 source	!=	cluster	&&	source.length	>	1 	 			{  Once	we	find	the	cluster,	we	can	move	the	observation.	Choose	a	random observation	 from	 the	 source	 cluster	 and	 move	 it	 to	 the	 empty	 cluster.	 We	 can now	set	the	done	flag	to	true.  					sourceObservationIndex	=	rndInt source.length ; 					sourceObservation	=	source[sourceObservationIndex]; 					source.remove sourceObservationIndex ;	  SH   					cluster.add sourceObservation ; 					done	=	true; 			} 		} 	} } updateStep  ;  Once	the	observations	have	been	assigned	to	their	clusters,	we	can	perform  Figure	5.2	shows	the	flow	chart	for	a	K-Means	algorithm	that	uses	random  the	update	step.  initialization.  Figure	5.2:	Random	Initialization  SH   SH   that	  Note	  the	 random	  initialization	 goes	 directly	  to	 update	 form initialization.	Performing	the	assignment	step	after	a	random	initialization	would not	make	sense,	because	the	initialization	step	already	assigned	the	observations to	 clusters.	 You	 will	 see	 in	 the	 next	 section	 that	 the	 for	 Forgy	 K-Means initialization	has	a	slightly	different	flow.  Forgy	K-Means	Initialization  Forgy	initialization	works	by	first	establishing	the	centroid	values	and	then assigning	the	observations	to	the	nearest	clusters.	This	is	done	using	the	pseudo code	 described	 below.	 First,	 determine	 the	 number	 of	 dimensions	 in	 the observations.	Each	observation	should	have	the	same	number	of	dimensions.	We will	 also	 keep	 a	 hash	 set	 of	 usedObservations.	 We	 will	 not	 use	 every observation	for	initialization,	but	we	do	not	want	to	reuse	an	observation,	either.  dimensions	=	theObservations.length; usedObservations	=	new	HashSet  ;  We	now	loop	through	and	create	K	clusters.  for	i	from	0	to	K  Create	the	cluster,	with	the	correct	number	of	dimensions.  	cluster	=	new	Cluster dimensions ; 	clusters.add cluster ;  With	 the	 cluster	 created,	 select	 a	 random	 observation.	 Do	 not	 choose	 an  observation	that	has	already	been	used.  	observationIndex	=	-1; 	 	while	 observationIndex	==	-1 	 	{ 			observationIndex	=	randInt theObservations.length ; 			if	 usedObservations.contains observationIndex  	 			{ 					observationIndex	=	-1; 			} 	}  Now	we	have	a	random	observation	that	was	not	previously	used.	Create	a  SH   cluster	 with	 only	 that	 observation	 and	 assign	 that	 observation	 to	 the	 cluster’s centroid.  	observation	=	theObservations[observationIndex]; 	usedObservations.add observationIndex ; }  Figure	5.3	shows	the	flow	of	an	application	that	uses	Forgy	initialization.  Figure	5.3:	Forgy	Initialization  SH   SH   As	 you	 can	 see	 from	 the	 above	 figure,	 the	 assignment	 step	 is	 processed right	 after	 the	 initialization	 step.	 This	 is	 because	 Forgy	 has	 already	 set	 up	 the cluster	 centroids,	 and	 we	 now	 need	 to	 assign	 all	 of	 the	 observations	 to	 the clusters.  SH   Chapter	Summary  Clustering	is	a	method	for	placing	observations	into	clusters.	The	similarity between	 observations	 determines	 what	 observations	 are	 placed	 into	 what clusters.	Clustering	is	an	example	of	unsupervised	training.  There	are	a	number	of	different	algorithms	for	clustering.	One	of	the	most popular	 is	 the	 K-Means	 algorithm.	 The	 K-Means	 algorithm	 assigns	 the observations	 into	 a	 fixed	 number	 of	 clusters.	 It	 takes	 several	 iterations	 for	 K- Means	 to	 move	 all	 of	 the	 observations	 into	 acceptable	 clusters.	 You	 should iterate	the	K-Means	algorithm	until	you	have	an	iteration	where	no	observation changes	clusters.  There	are	three	different	steps	that	are	used	in	the	K-Means	algorithm.	The initialization	 step	 creates	 the	 initial	 clusters.	 The	 assignment	 step	 updates	 the centroid	for	each	cluster.	The	centroid	is	the	vector	average	of	all	observations assigned	to	that	cluster.	The	update	step	recalculates	all	centroid	values	based	on observations	assigned	to	those	clusters.  This	chapter	introduced	you	to	clustering	and	unsupervised	training.	In	the next	chapter,	you	will	learn	about	error	calculation.	Error	calculation	is	primarily used	in	supervised	training.	It	helps	to	calculate	the	difference	between	the	actual output	and	the	ideal	output	of	a	machine	learning	method.  SH   Chapter	6:	Error	Calculation 	  Supervised	Training Sum	of	Squares	Error	 SSE  Mean	Squares	 MSE  Root	Mean	Squares Data	Sets  Error	calculation	is	very	important	for	supervised	training.	A	training	set	for supervised	training	consists	of	vector	pairs.	These	pairs	align	input	vectors	with an	 output,	 or	 ideal,	 vector	 that	 is	 the	 expected	 response	 to	 the	 provided	 input vectors.  Listing	6.1	shows	an	example	of	how	vector	pairs	would	be	constructed	for  the	XOR	function.  Listing	6.1:	The	XOR	Function Operator  Input:	[0,0];	Ideal:	[0] Input:	[0,1];	Ideal:	[1] Input:	[1,0];	Ideal:	[1] Input:	[1,1];	Ideal:	[0]  The	XOR	function	always	returns	true	when	the	two	inputs	are	different.	If the	two	inputs	are	the	same,	then	it	returns	false.	 In	 the	 above	 listing,	true	 is normalized	to	1	and	false	to	0.	The	above	training	set	would	be	used	to	teach	a machine-learning	 algorithm	 to	 emulate	 the	 XOR	 function.	 This	 is	 a	 common introductory	task	for	machine	learning	algorithms.  In	the	above	listing,	there	are	two	inputs:	0	and	1.	The	ideal	output	for	each of	 the	 four	 input	 vectors	 is	 also	 provided.	 This	 training	 set	 contains	 four input ideal	output	pairs.  There	are	a	variety	of	different	error	calculation	methods	that	are	commonly used	 with	 machine	 learning	 algorithms.	 In	 this	 chapter	 we	 will	 look	 at	 the following	three	error	calculation	methods: 	  Sum	of	Squares	Error	 SSE   SH   Mean	Square	Error	 MSE  Root	Mean	Square	Error	 RMS   The	most	commonly	used	error	calculation	method	is	Mean	Square	Error  MSE .	 However,	 this	 does	 not	 mean	 the	 MSE	 should	 always	 be	 used. Sometimes,	 the	 machine-learning	 algorithm	 in	 use	 will	 dictate	 the	 error calculation	 method	 that	 you	 should	 use.	 You	 can	 also	 use	 multiple	 error calculation	methods	if	necessary,	for	comparison.  The	 following	 sections	 will	 describe	 each	 of	 these	 error	 calculation  methods.  SH   Sum	of	Squares	Error  The	Sum	of	Squares	Error	 SSE 	is	a	very	simple	error	calculation	method used	 by	 some	 machine	 learning	 algorithms.	 A	 high	 SSE	 value	 indicates	 that there	is	a	large	difference	between	the	expected	output	and	the	actual	output.	A training	algorithm	should	work	to	minimize	SSE.  The	calculation	of	SSE	is	shown	in	Equation	6.1.	 Draper,	1998   Equation	6.1:	Sum	of	Squares	Error	 SSE   Where	y	hat	is	the	ideal	output	and	y	bar	is	the	actual	output. The	 most	 common	 reason	 to	 use	 SSE	 is	 that	 some	 training	 algorithms require	it.	SSE	is	essentially	the	sum	of	squares	of	the	individual	variances	of each	output.	Because	of	this,	bigger	training	sets	will	always	tend	to	have	larger SSE	 values.	 This	 is	 one	 of	 the	 weaknesses	 of	 the	 SSE	 value—you	 cannot directly	compare	the	SSE	values	from	two	training	sets	of	different	sizes.  SH   Root	Mean	Square  The	 Root	 Mean	 Square	  RMS 	 error	 calculation	 method	 is	 similar	 to	 the SSE	 method	 in	 that	 it	 is	 based	 on	 the	 squares	 of	 the	 individual	 differences between	expected	output	vectors	and	the	actual	output.	However,	a	mean	is	taken of	all	of	these	squares	and	then	the	square	root	is	taken	of	this	mean.	Because	the RMS	 is	 based	 on	 a	 mean,	 you	 can	 compare	 the	 RMS	 values	 of	 two	 different training	sets.	 Draper,	1998   Equation	6.2:	Root	Mean	Square	 RMS   Where	y	hat	is	the	ideal	output	and	y	bar	is	the	actual	output.  SH   Mean	Square	Error  MSE	 error	 calculation	 is	 the	 most	 commonly	 used	 error	 calculation	 for machine	 learning.	 Most,	 but	 not	 all,	 Internet	 examples	 of	 neural	 networks, support	vector	machines,	and	other	models	make	use	of	MSE.	MSE	is	shown	in Equation	6.3.	 Draper,	1998   Equation	6.3:	Mean	Square	Error	 MSE   Where	y	hat	is	the	ideal	output	and	y	bar	is	the	actual	output. The	 mean	 square	 error	 is	 essentially	 the	 mean	 of	 the	 squares	 of	 the individual	differences.	Because	the	individual	differences	are	squared,	it	does	not matter	to	MSE	if	the	difference	is	positive	or	negative.  You	may	be	wondering	how	to	choose	between	RMS	and	MSE.	RMS	and MSE	are	very	similar.	One	important	difference	is	that	RMS	is	linear	whereas MSE	is	not.	If	you	were	to	double	every	error	in	the	training	set,	the	RMS	errors would	also	double,	while	the	MSE	errors	would	not.	Sometimes	it	is	useful	to	be able	to	compare	errors	like	this.  SH   Comparison	of	Error	Calculation	Methods  This	section	shows	how	to	add	random	distortion	to	a	training	set.	Listing 6.2	 shows	 how	 small,	 medium,	 large,	 and	 huge	 distortions	 affect	 each	 of	 the training	sets.  Listing	6.2:	Error	Calculation	Methods  Type					SSE								MSE								RMS Small				2505							0.01							0.1 Medium			62634						0.251						0.501 Large				250538					1.002						1.001 Huge					25053881			100.216				10.011  The	largest	effect	is	on	the	SSE	error	calculation,	because	SSE	is	a	simple summation	of	the	errors.	SSE	has	a	larger	change	than	RMS.	You	can	see	that RMS	is	essentially	the	square	root	of	RMS.  Partitioning	Training	Data  You	typically	do	not	want	to	use	all	available	data	for	training,	as	there	is almost	 always	 noise	 in	 your	 data.	 The	 word	 “noise”	 is	 used	 to	 describe	 small distortions	 that	 are	 not	 consistently	 reproducible.	 A	 successfully	 trained algorithm	will	be	able	to	see	through	the	noise	and	still	predict	accurately.	Over fitting	occurs	when	the	algorithm	memorizes	the	noise.	Because	the	noise	is	not consistent,	 this	 will	 greatly	 impair	 the	 algorithm’s	 ability	 to	 recognize	 data outside	 of	 the	 training	 set.	 Because	 noise	 is	 not	 consistent,	 it	 will	 cause	 the algorithm	 to	 see	 false	 patterns.	 Such	 patterns	 create	 a	 phenomenon	 called training	set	bias.  Selection	 bias	 is	 another	 concern.	 If	 you	 need	 to	 choose	 from	 among several	competing	machine	learning	algorithms,	you	should	not	simply	choose the	algorithm	 that	trained	 to	the	 lowest	 error,	or	 you	will	 likely	pick	 the	 most over	fit	model.  Available	 data	 is	 typically	 broken	 into	 three	 sets	 to	 avoid	 bias.	 It	 is important	that	these	sets	are	randomly	sampled	from	available	data,	as	you	do not	want	to	introduce	any	bias	when	selecting	the	items	for	each	set.	Randomly  SH   select	items	from	the	available	data	in	order	to	avoid	bias.	For	time-series	data, you	 select	 chronological	 ranges.	 The	 three	 sets	 that	 training	 data	 is	 typically divided	into	are	listed	here. 	  Training	set Validation	set Test	set  The	 training	 set	 is	 the	 data	 with	 which	 you	 train	 your	 algorithm.	 This	 is usually	 the	 largest	 of	 three	 sets.	 Training	 data	 is	 often	 selected	 as	 80%	 of available	data.	You	can	then	split	the	remaining	20%	between	validation	and	test. It	 is	 important	 to	 remember	 that	 error	 on	 your	 training	 data	 is	 often	 very optimistic.	This	is	because	the	training	data	was	used	to	train	the	algorithm.  If	 you	 are	 evaluating	 several	 different	 algorithms,	 you	 should	 use	 the validation	 set	 next	 to	 see	 what	 algorithms	 learned	 the	 best.	 Use	 data	 that	 the algorithms	did	not	see	during	the	training,	as	the	algorithms	should	be	unbiased to	this	data.  SH   Chapter	Summary  This	chapter	introduced	supervised	training,	using	data	sets.	A	supervised data	 set	 is	 used	 with	 a	 supervised	 training	 algorithm	 and	 contains	 pairs	 of vectors.	Each	of	these	pairs	represents	one	element	in	the	training	set.	Each	pair contains	an	input	vector	and	an	output	vector	that	represents	the	expected	output from	that	input	vector.	Machine	learning	algorithms	are	evaluated	based	on	how closely	the	actual	output	matches	the	ideal	expected	output.  There	 are	 several	 different	 error	 calculation	 algorithms.	 One	 of	 the	 most basic	is	the	Sum	of	Squares	Error	 SSE .	This	method	calculates	the	difference between	the	actual	and	expected	outputs	for	the	machine-learning	algorithm.	The SSE	algorithm	then	squares	and	sums	each	of	these	differences.  The	Mean	Squares	Error	 MSE 	is	one	of	the	most	commonly	used	distance calculation	 methods	 in	 machine	 learning.	 This	 calculation	 is	 similar	 to	 SSE; however,	MSE	is	divided	by	the	number	of	elements,	thus	producing	an	average. Once	you	have	selected	your	algorithm,	you	can	use	the	test	set	to	give	you an	idea	of	how	well	the	algorithm	might	perform	with	real	data.	This	should	be the	final	indicator	of	the	overall	performance	of	your	chosen	model.	MSE	is	not linear—if	the	difference	doubles,	MSE	will	not	double.  The	 Root	 Mean	 Square	  RMS 	 error	 is	 essentially	 the	 square	 root	 of	 the MSE	error.	Unlike	MSE,	RMS	is	linear.	This	allows	you	to	directly	evaluate	two RMS	errors.	If	the	difference	between	the	actual	and	ideal	vectors	doubles,	then RMS	will	also	double.  This	 chapter	 introduced	 several	 concepts	 in	 supervised	 training	 and described	 how	 to	 construct	 supervised	 training	 sets.	 It	 also	 discussed	 several methods	 for	 evaluating	 these	 data	 sets.	 The	 next	 chapter	 introduces	 machine learning.	 You	 will	 see	 how	 simple	 models	 can	 be	 constructed	 and	 trained	 to produce	the	correct	output.  SH   Chapter	7:	Towards	Machine	Learning 	  Training	a	Polynomial Greedy	Random	Training RBF	Functions RBF	Network	Model  In	 previous	 chapters	 we	 saw	 that	 a	 machine-learning	 algorithm	 typically accepts	an	input	vector	and	produces	an	output	vector.	To	transform	this	input vector	into	an	output	vector,	two	additional	vectors	can	be	used.	These	additional vectors	are	referred	to	as	long-term	and	short-term	memory.	Long-term	memory can	also	be	referred	to	as	weights	or	coefficients.	It	is	adjusted	through	training. Short-term	memory	is	not	used	by	all	machine-learning	algorithms.  It	might	be	helpful	to	think	of	a	machine-learning	algorithm	as	a	function. We	 will	 treat	 a	 very	 simple	 equation	 as	 though	 it	 were	 a	 machine-learning algorithm	in	equation	7.1,	in	order	to	demonstrate.  Equation	7.1:	Simple	Linear	Equation  Here	 we	 think	 of	 x	 as	 a	 single	 value—a	 scalar,	 rather	 than	 a	 vector.	 The value	 5	 is	 a	 coefficient.	 Coefficients	 are	 usually	 grouped	 into	 a	 vector	 and represent	the	long-term	memory	of	the	algorithm.	When	we	train	Equation	7.1, we	will	adjust	the	coefficient	until	we	arrive	at	a	value	that	produces	the	desired output.	If	Listing	7.1	represented	the	training	data	for	the	algorithm	of	Equation 7.1,	we	could	feed	the	input	into	Equation	7.1	and	evaluate	the	results.  Listing	7.1:	Simple	Training	Data  Input:	[1],	Desired	Output:	[7] Input:	[2],	Desired	Output:	[14] Input:	[3],	Desired	Output:	[21]  The	 coefficient	 of	 5	 would	 not	 provide	 the	 desired	 output.	 As	 we	 saw	 in Chapter	6,	we	could	calculate	the	error	between	the	above	desired	outputs	and the	 actual	 outputs	 provided	 in	 Listing	 7.1.	 For	 example,	 the	 input	 of	 1	 to Equation	7.1	would	produce	5,	while	our	desired	output	for	1	is	7.  SH   There	 are	 many	 different	 ways	 to	 find	 a	 suitable	 coefficient	 for	 machine learning	algorithms.	Coefficient	adjustment	methods	is	one	of	the	primary	areas of	research	for	machine	learning.  If	the	machine	learning	algorithm	is	a	linear	function,	as	is	the	case	with Equation	 7.1,	 mathematical	 techniques	 can	 often	 be	 used	 to	 find	 a	 suitable coefficient.	For	this	simple	case,	we	only	need	to	find	the	coefficient	that	yields 7	 when	 multiplied	 by	 1.	 This	 coefficient	 would	 be	 7.	 A	 coefficient	 of	 7	 also yields	a	zero	error	for	the	other	training	set	elements.  Not	 all	 data	 sets	 will	 be	 so	 easy.	 In	 fact,	 it	 is	 extremely	 rare	 to	 fit	 the coefficients	 or	long-term	memory	vectors 	to	result	in	an	error	that	is	exactly zero.	This	is	because	most	data	contains	noise.	Noise	is	any	outcome	that	is	not consistently	 reproducible	 given	 its	 input	 data,	 and	 thus	 contributes	 to	 a	 higher error	rate.	Because	of	noise,	the	goal	of	a	machine	learning	algorithm	is	usually for	the	algorithm	to	perform	well	on	new	data,	rather	than	displaying	zero	error. If	you	do	get	a	zero	error,	you	should	be	suspicious	that	your	coefficients are	 over	 fit.	 Over	 fitting	 occurs	 when	 the	 machine	 learning	 method	 has memorized	 your	 training	 data.	 At	 this	 point,	 the	 algorithm	 simply	 recalls memorized	 input	 vectors	 rather	 than	 learning	 to	 abstract	 output.	 An	 over	 fit algorithm	will	not	perform	well	on	new	data	that	is	not	in	the	original	training set.  We	will	now	look	at	some	methods	for	optimizing	the	coefficients	to	lower the	error	and	be	introduced	to	a	few	foundational	algorithms	for	optimizing	the coefficients.	The	next	chapters	will	discuss	more	advanced	algorithms,	such	as simulated	annealing	and	Nelder	Mead.  Most	 training	 algorithms	 presented	 in	 this	 book	 are	 generic.	 Given	 any long-term	memory	vector,	these	algorithms	can	attempt	to	optimize.	This	is	not the	case	with	every	training	algorithm,	however.	Some	training	algorithms	use specific	insights	into	the	algorithm	that	they	are	trying	to	train.	We	will	see	such algorithms	in	Chapter	10.	However,	most	of	the	algorithms	in	the	other	chapters of	this	book	are	generic.  SH   Coefficients	of	a	Polynomial  This	section	describes	how	to	implement	a	generic	training	method	in	order to	optimize	the	coefficients	of	a	polynomial.	We	will	use	the	polynomial	as	the machine-learning	 algorithm	 that	 we	 seek	 to	 optimize.	 Typically,	 you	 will optimize	 the	 coefficients	 into	 something	 more	 complex	 than	 a	 simple polynomial,	 but	 this	 example	 will	 serve	 as	 a	 great	 introduction	 to	 machine learning.	 Fitting	 a	 polynomial	 to	 a	 dataset	 illustrates	 the	 fundamentals	 of	 how more	complex	machine	learning	algorithms	work.  A	 polynomial	 is	 a	 mathematical	 expression	 consisting	 of	 variables	 and constant	 coefficients	 and	 uses	 only	 the	 operations	 of	 addition,	 subtraction, multiplication,	 and	 positive	 integer	 exponents.	 Equation	 7.2	 shows	 a	 typical, third	degree	polynomial.	 Lial,	2010   Equation	7.2:	A	Third	Degree	Polynomial  The	above	mathematical	function	accepts	a	value	x	and	returns	a	value	y. The	 input	 and	 output	 vectors	 for	 this	 function	 are	 both	 of	 size	 one.	 There	 are three	coefficients	in	Equation	7.1:	2,	4,	and	6.	In	this	case,	the	coefficients	are multiplied	 against	 the	 variable	 x.	 The	 coefficient	 2	 is	 multiplied	 against	 x squared,	 the	 coefficient	 4	 is	 multiplied	 against	 x.	 Even	 6	 is	 a	 coefficient. Technically	6	is	multiplied	against	x	to	the	power	of	zero.	Though	x	to	the	power of	zero	is	equal	to	one.  The	above	polynomial	is	said	to	be	of	the	“third	degree”	because	there	are three	 terms.	 Each	 term	 relates	 to	 a	 coefficient.	 The	 three	 coefficients	 used	 in Equation	7.1	can	be	thought	of	as	a	vector	and	described	as	follows:  [2,4,6]  For	Equation	7.1,	the	coefficient	is	already	specified.	Often	we	will	need	to use	machine	learning	to	determine	what	the	coefficient s 	should	be.	To	do	so, you	would	use	a	training	set	that	includes	the	expected	outputs	for	a	variety	of inputs.	 Such	 data	 can	 be	 collected	 experimentally.	 In	 order	 to	 fit	 these observations	to	a	third	degree	polynomial,	we	can	use	machine	learning	to	help.  SH   We	 will	 begin	 by	 creating	 some	 training	 data.	 We	 already	 know	 that	 we want	the	solution	to	be	the	coefficients	[2,4,6].	This	is	a	completely	contrived example,	but	it	will	demonstrate	how	to	use	some	basic	training	algorithms.	To generate	the	training	data,	loop	over	some	x	values	and	calculate	the	polynomial for	each.	Then,	use	random	coefficients	to	train	to	the	correct	coefficients.	We will	use	only	the	training	data	to	see	if	we	can	rebuild	the	correct	coefficients.  The	 generated	 training	 data	 is	 shown	 in	 Listing	 7.2.	 As	 you	 can	 see,	 we  loop	the	input	from	-50	to	+50	and	calculate	the	ideal	output.  Listing	7.2:	Polynomial	Training	Data  [BasicData:	input:[-50.0],	ideal:[4806.0]] [BasicData:	input:[-49.0],	ideal:[4612.0]] [BasicData:	input:[-48.0],	ideal:[4422.0]] ... [BasicData:	input:[47.0],	ideal:[4612.0]] [BasicData:	input:[48.0],	ideal:[4806.0]] [BasicData:	input:[49.0],	ideal:[5004.0]]  Given	the	above	data,	we	will	now	see	how	the	coefficients	can	be	adjusted to	produce	the	above	data.	In	the	next	section	we	will	see	how	we	can	use	the training	 data	 in	 Listing	 7.2	 to	 reconstruct	 the	 polynomial.	 Of	 course,	 we	 will assume	that	we	did	not	know	the	actual	polynomial	in	the	first	place.	We	only assume	we	have	Listing	7.2.  SH   Introduction	to	Training  There	 are	 many	 different	 ways	 to	 adjust	 the	 long-term	 memory	 of	 a machine-learning	 algorithm	 during	 training.	 In	 this	 section,	 we	 will	 look	 at greedy	random	training.	This	method	is	simple	to	implement.	In	the	next	chapter, we	will	look	at	more	robust	training	algorithms.	Robust	training	algorithms	will typically	 find	 an	 optimal	 setting	 for	 long-term	 memory	 faster	 than	 greedy random	training.  Greedy	Random	Training  Greedy	random	training	is	extremely	simple	to	implement.	Essentially,	all	it does	is	randomly	select	values	for	the	long-term	memory	vector.	This	algorithm is	greedy	in	the	sense	that	it	only	accepts	a	new	memory	vector	if	the	new	vector is	 an	 improvement	 over	 the	 previous	 one.	 This	 algorithm	 keeps	 choosing	 new random	values	for	the	long-term	memory	and	always	maintains	the	best	vector seen	so	far.	This	algorithm	is	sometimes	called	a	random	walk.  This	algorithm	can	be	seen	in	the	pseudo	code	shown	in	Listing	7.3.  Listing	7.3:	Greedy	Random	Training	 minimize	score   function	iteration  	ltm,	  	the	current	long	term	memory	vector 	lowRange,	  	the	lowest	value	to	randomize	to 	highRange	  	the	highest	value	to	randomize	to  	 { 	  	Score	the	current	state. 	oldScore	=	calculateScore ltm ; 	  	Keep	a	copy	of	the	current	state,	in	case	we 	  	fail	to	improve	it. 	len	=	ltm.length; 	oldLtm	=	ltm.clone  ; 	 	  	Set	to	a	random	state. 	for	i	from	0	to	len 	{ 	ltm[i]	=	rand lowRange,highRange ; 	}  SH   	  	Score	the	new	random	vector. 	newScore	=	calculateScore ltm ; 	  	Greedy	decision.	Did	the	randomization	improve	our	state? 	  	If	not,	then	back	it	out. 	if 	newScore	>	oldScore	 	 	{ 	Ltm	=	oldLtm.clone  ; 	} }  The	 above	 code	 implements	 one	 iteration	 of	 a	 greedy	 random	 algorithm.  There	are	three	parameters	that	you	pass	to	the	above	function. 	  Parameter	1.	The	long-term	memory	vector	that	you	would	like	to	optimize. Parameters	2	&	3.	The	low	and	high	ranges	for	the	values	that	you	would like	to	randomly	assign	to	the	individual	elements	in	the	long-term	memory vector.  The	iteration	function	then	assigns	random	values	to	the	long-term	memory vector.	 The	 score	 of	 the	 vector	 is	 compared	 to	 the	 score	 from	 before	 the randomization.	If	the	vector’s	score	did	not	decrease,	then	throw	out	the	changes and	 revert	 to	 the	 previous	 vector.	 This	 is	 why	 it	 is	 called	 greedy.	 It	 will	 only accept	improvements.	This	is	not	always	the	best	policy.	As	the	old	saying	goes, “sometimes	you	have	to	take	one	step	backward	to	take	two	steps	forward.”  Believe	 it	 or	 not,	 the	 greedy	 random	 trainer	 can	 actually	 train	 vectors. Running	 it	 against	 the	 polynomial	  from	 Equation	 7.2 	 yields	 the	 following results.  Iteration	999984,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999985,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999986,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999987,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999988,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999989,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999990,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999991,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999992,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999993,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999994,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999995,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999996,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999997,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	999998,	Score=37.93061791363337,	  SH   Iteration	999999,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Iteration	1000000,	Score=37.93061791363337,	 Final	score:	37.93061791363337 2.0026889363153195x^2+4.057350732096355x+9.393343096548456  As	 you	 can	 see,	 the	 greedy	 random	 training	 algorithm	 came	 reasonably close	 to	 the	 expected	 coefficients.	 Instead	 of	 getting	 [2,4,6],	 we	 got	 [2.002, 4.057,	and	9.3933].  The	 greedy	 random	 algorithm	 is	 often	 used	 as	 a	 benchmark.	 You	 can compare	 the	 greedy	 random	 result	 against	 a	 new	 algorithm	 that	 you	 are evaluating.	 If	 the	 new	 algorithm	 does	 not	 outperform	 the	 greedy	 random algorithm,	then	you	know	the	new	algorithm	is	performing	very	poorly.  SH   Radial	Basis	Networks  In	 the	 last	 section	 we	 looked	 at	 how	 to	 optimize	 the	 coefficients	 for	 a polynomial.	Most	machine	learning	algorithms	are	much	more	complex	than	a simple	polynomial.	In	this	section	we	will	introduce	an	RBF	Network.	 Bishop, 1996 	 The	 RBF	 network	 is	 a	 statistical	 model	 that	 can	 be	 used	 both	 for regression	and	classification.  There	are	many	different	methods	for	training	an	RBF	network.	The	RBF network	has	a	vector	that	represents	its	long-term	memory.	For	an	RBF	network, the	 long-term	 memory	 is	 a	 combination	 of	 coefficients	 and	 other	 parameters. There	is	no	short-term	memory	vector	for	the	RBF	network.	It	can	be	trained	by both	greedy	random	and	hill	climbing	algorithms,	and	is	based	on	radial	basis functions	 RBF .  The	next	section	will	briefly	review	RBFs	and	describe	the	exact	makeup	of  this	vector.  Radial	Basis	Functions  Radial	basis	functions	are	a	very	important	concept	in	AI,	as	many	different AI	 algorithms	 make	 use	 of	 them.	 There	 are	 a	 number	 of	 different	 RBF	 types, several	of	which	will	be	introduced	in	this	chapter.  A	 radial	 basis	 function	 is	 symmetric	 about	 its	 center,	 which	 is	 typically located	somewhere	along	the	x-axis.	The	RBF	will	reach	its	maximum	value	at the	center.	This	maximum	value	is	called	the	peak,	and	is	often	set	to	one.	In	the context	 of	 RBF	 networks,	 the	 peak	 is	 always	 set	 to	 one	 and	 the	 center	 varies accordingly.  RBFs	can	have	many	dimensions.	The	output	of	an	RBF	will	always	be	a single	scalar	value,	regardless	of	the	number	of	dimensions	in	the	vector	passed to	the	RBF.  There	are	a	number	of	commonly	used	RBFs.	We	will	start	with	the	most common:	 the	 Gaussian	 function.	 Figure	 7.1	 shows	 a	 graph	 of	 a	 1D	 Gaussian function	centered	at	0.  SH   Figure	7.1:	Gaussian	Function  RBF	 functions	 are	 commonly	 used	 to	 selectively	 scale	 something,	 and Gaussian	is	no	different.	Consider	Figure	7.1.	If	this	function	were	used	to	scale something,	 you	 would	 have	 maximum	 intensity	 at	 the	 center.	 The	 intensity would	fall	off	in	either	the	positive	or	negative	directions	as	you	moved	from	the center.  Before	we	can	look	at	the	equation	for	the	Gaussian	RBF,	we	must	consider how	to	process	the	multiple	dimensions.	It	is	important	to	note	that	RBFs	accept multi-dimensional	input	to	return	a	single	value.	It	does	this	by	calculating	the distance	 between	 the	 input	 and	 the	 center	 vector	 of	 the	 RBF.	 This	 distance	 is called	 r.	 The	 RBF	 center	 and	 input	 to	 the	 RBF	 must	 always	 have	 the	 same number	of	dimensions	for	the	calculation	to	occur.	Once	we	calculate	r,	then	we can	calculate	the	individual	RBF	function.	All	of	the	RBF	functions	make	use	of this	calculated	r.  Equation	7.3	shows	how	to	calculate	r.  Equation	7.3:	Calculating	r  The	 double	 vertical	 bars	 you	 see	 in	 the	 equation	 above	 represent	 that	 the function	describes	a	distance.	Euclidean	distance	is	almost	always	used	for	an RBF.	However,	other	distances	might	be	used	for	certain	very	specialized	cases. The	 examples	 provided	 for	 this	 book	 always	 use	 the	 Euclidean	 distance. Therefore,	 r	 is	 simply	 the	 Euclidean	 distance	 between	 the	 center	 and	 the	 x vector.	 The	 value	 r	 will	 be	 used	 in	 each	 of	 the	 RBF	 functions	 used	 in	 this section.  SH   The	equation	for	a	Gaussian	RBF	is	shown	in	Equation	7.4.  Equation	7.4:	Gaussian	RBF  Once	you’ve	calculated	r,	it	is	fairly	easy	to	calculate	the	RBF.	The	Greek  letter	PHI,	which	you	see	at	the	left	of	the	equation,	always	represents	an	RBF.  The	Gaussian	is	not	the	only	RBF,	and	other	RBFs	have	different	shapes.	If you	 are	 using	 the	 RBF	 to	 scale,	 these	 different	 shapes	 can	 give	 you	 different ways	to	scale	a	number.	Figure	7.2	shows	the	Ricker	Wavelet.  Figure	7.2:	The	Ricker	Wavelet	 Mexican	Hat	Function   The	Ricker	Wavelet	is	often	used	as	an	RBF.	It	is	often	called	the	Mexican hat	function,	due	to	its	pictorial	resemblance	to	a	sombrero.	The	equation	for	the Ricker	Wavelet	is	provided	in	Equation	7.5.  Equation	7.5:	The	Ricker	Wavelet	 Mexican	Hat	Function   As	 you	 can	 see	 from	 Figure	 7.2,	 the	 Ricker	 Wavelet	 actually	 scales  negatively	just	at	the	edges,	and	then	returns	to	zero.  Different	 RBF	 functions	 are	 useful	 in	 different	 situations.	 Some	 other  common	RBF	functions	include: 	  Multiquadric  SH   Inverse	quadratic Inverse	multiquadric Polyharmonic	spline Thin	plate	spline  We	 can	 make	 use	 of	 the	 RBF	 function	 to	 implement	 a	 statistical	 model called	 the	 RBF	 network.	 We	 will	 be	 able	 to	 train	 this	 model	 using	 any	 of	 the techniques	discussed	so	far.  Radial	Basis	Function	Networks  A	Radial	Basis	Function	network	is	a	statistical	model	that	can	be	used	for both	classification	and	regression.	It	provides	a	weighted	summation	of	one	or more	 Radial	 Basis	 Functions,	 each	 of	 which	 receives	 the	 weighted	 input attributes	used	to	predict	the	output.	The	following	equation	describes	an	RBF network.  Equation	7.6:	An	RBF	Network  Note	 that	 the	 double	 vertical	 bars	 above	 mean	 to	 take	 the	 distance.	 Such symbols	do	not	specify	what	distance	algorithm	to	use;	this	is	your	choice.	In	the above	equation	X	is	the	input	vector	of	attributes,	c	is	the	vector	center	of	the RBF,	p	is	the	chosen	RBF	 Gaussian,	for	example ,	a	is	the	vector	coefficient	 or weight 	for	each	RBF,	and	b	specifies	the	vector	coefficient	to	weight	the	input attributes.	We	will	see	pseudo	code	for	Equation	7.6	later	in	this	chapter.  In	our	example,	we	will	apply	the	RBF	network	to	the	iris	data	set.	Figure  7.3	provides	a	graphic	representation	of	this	application.  Figure	7.3:	An	RBF	Network	for	the	Iris	Data  SH   SH   The	above	network	contains	four	inputs	 the	length	and	width	of	petals	and sepals ,	 which	 map	 to	 the	 features	 that	 describe	 each	 iris	 species.	 The	 above diagram	assumes	that	we	are	using	one-of-n	encoding	for	the	three	different	iris species.	It	would	also	be	possible	to	use	equilateral	encoding	and	have	only	two outputs.	To	keep	things	simple,	however,	we	will	use	one-of-n.	We	also	choose to	use	three	RBF	functions.	This	is	purely	an	arbitrary	choice.	Additional	RBF functions	 allow	 the	 model	 to	 learn	 more	 complex	 data	 sets.	 However,	 more RBF’s	take	more	time	to	process.  Arrows	represent	all	coefficients	from	the	equation.	The	arrows	between	the input	attributes	 and	RBFs	 are	represented	 by	b	 in	 Equation	 7.6.	 Similarly,	 the arrows	between	the	RBFs	and	the	summation	are	represented	by	a.	You	will	also note	that	there	is	a	bias	box.	This	is	a	synthetic	function	that	always	returns	a value	of	1.	Because	the	bias	function’s	output	is	constant,	no	inputs	are	required. The	weights	from	the	bias	to	the	summation	function	very	similarly	to	the	vector intercept	 in	 linear	 regression.	 Bias	 is	 not	 always	 bad!	 In	 this	 case	 it	 is	 an important	component	to	the	RBF	network.	Bias	nodes	are	also	very	common	in neural	networks.  Because	 there	 are	 multiple	 summations,	 you	 can	 see	 that	 this	 poses	 a classification	 problem.	 The	 highest	 summation	 specifies	 the	 predicted	 class.	 If this	were	a	regression	problem,	there	would	be	single	output.	The	single	output would	represent	the	predicted	output	for	regression.  You	will	also	notice	that	there	is	a	bias	node	in	Figure	7.3.	The	bias	node	is located	in	the	place	where	an	additional	RBF	function	might	go.	However,	the bias	 node	 does	 not	 accept	 any	 input—unlike	 an	 RBF.	 The	 bias	 node	 always outputs	a	constant	value	of	one.	Of	course,	this	constant	value	of	1	is	multiplied by	a	coefficient	value.	This	has	the	effect	of	the	coefficient	always	being	directly added	to	the	output,	regardless	of	the	input.	Bias	nodes	are	very	useful	when	the input	is	zero,	as	they	allow	the	RBF	layer	to	output	values	even	when	the	input	is zero.  The	long-term	memory	vector	for	the	RBF	network	is	made	up	of	several  different	components: 	  Input	coefficients Output Summation	coefficients RBF	width	scalars	 same	width	in	all	dimensions  RBF	center	vectors  SH   The	RBF	network	will	store	all	of	these	components	as	a	single	vector.	This vector	becomes	the	long-term	memory	of	the	RBF	network.	We	will	then	make use	of	either	greedy	random	or	hill	climbing	training	to	set	the	vector	to	values that	will	produce	the	correct	iris	species	for	the	features	presented.  This	model	works	almost	exactly	like	the	polynomial	that	we	saw	before. The	only	difference	is	that	the	equation	is	much	more	complex,	as	we	now	must calculate	several	output	values	and	RBF	functions.  Implementing	an	RBF	Network  This	 section	 outlines	 the	 pseudo	 code	 for	 two	 major	 functions	 in	 the implementation	 of	 an	 RBF	 network.	 First,	 we	 will	 look	 at	 the	 function	 that initializes	an	RBF	network.	This	function	allocates	the	long-term	memory	vector that	is	used	for	the	RBF	network.	To	create	the	RBF	network,	you	must	provide the	following	three	pieces	of	information. 	  Input	count RBF	count Output	count  The	input	and	output	counts	simply	specify	the	sizes	of	the	input	and	output vectors.	 Your	 data	 set	 will	 dictate	 these	 values.	 The	 RBF	 count	 is	 a	 bit	 more subjective.	The	more	RBF	functions	you	have,	the	better	the	model	will	be	able to	 predict	 desired	 outcomes.	 However,	 using	 more	 RBF	 functions	 increases inefficiency.  Listing	7.4	shows	how	an	RBF	network	is	initialized.  Listing	7.4:	Initializing	an	RBF	Network  function	initRBFNetwork  	theInputCount,	  	the	number	of	inputs	to	the	network 	rbfCount,	  	the	number	of	RBF	functions	in	the	network 	theOutputCount	  	the	output	count 	 	 { 	result	=	new	RBFNetwork  ; 	  	set	simple	properties	on	the	network 	result.inputCount	=	theInputCount; 	result.outputCount	=	theOutputCount; 	  	Calculate	input	and	output	weight	counts.  SH   	  	Add	1	to	output	to	account	for	an	extra	bias	node. 	inputWeightCount	=	inputCount	*	rbfCount; 	outputWeightCount	=	 rbfCount	+	1 	*	outputCount; 	rbfParams	=	 inputCount	+	1 	*	rbfCount; 	 	  	allocate	enough	space	for	the	long	term	memory 	result.longTermMemory	=	alloc inputWeightCount	 	+	outputWeightCount	+	rbfParams ; 	  	Set	more	properties	on	the	model 	result.indexInputWeights	=	0; 	result.indexOutputWeights	=	inputWeightCount	+	rbfParams; 	  	Allocate	RBF	functions 	result.rbf	=	new	FnRBF[rbfCount]; 	  	Set	up	all	of	the	RBF	functions 	for	i	from	0	to	rbfCount	 	{ 			  	The	index	for	the	current	RBF	function. 			rbfIndex	=	inputWeightCount	+	  inputCount	+	1 	*	i ; 			  	allocate	a	Gaussian	and	specify	the	input	count	and	 			  	the	location	in	long	term	memory	where	this	RBF 			  	function's	parameters	are	stored.	The	parameters	are	 			  	the	width,	followed	by	the	center	dimensions. 			result.rbf[i]	=	new	GaussianFunction  					inputCount,	result.longTermMemory,	rbfIndex ; 	} 	  	return	the	newly	constructed	network 	return	result; }  The	method	begins	by	allocating	an	object	named	result	to	hold	the	RBF Network.	 This	 object	 will	 hold	 the	 long-term	 memory	 and	 a	 few	 other	 basic items	about	the	network.  The	above	code	calculates	exactly	how	much	long-term	memory	is	needed to	hold	the	coefficients	and	RBF	parameters.	The	individual	RBF	functions	are then	 allocated	 and	 pointed	 to	 the	 long-term	 memory	 for	 their	 parameters.	 The RBF	parameters	are	their	widths,	followed	by	their	center	dimensions.  The	 above	 code	 does	 not	 actually	 fill	 the	 long-term	 memory	 with	 any values.	 Once	 the	 network	 has	 been	 allocated,	 you	 will	 typically	 assign	 it	 to random	values.	This	will	give	the	RBF	network	an	initial	starting	point.	Training will	refine	the	long-term	memory	values	into	useful	values	that	produce	output closer	to	the	expected	outputs.	For	the	iris	data,	these	are	the	outputs	that	define what	species	the	network	thinks	the	inputs	correspond	to.  Once	the	RBF	network	has	been	set	up	and	the	long-term	memory	has	been  SH   set,	the	network	is	ready	for	training.	We	will	call	the	RBF	model	and	score	how well	the	initial	outputs	match	up.	Of	course,	we	are	starting	with	random	values, so	the	output	will	not	be	good.	However,	you	have	to	start	somewhere.  Just	as	was	done	for	the	polynomial,	we	must	calculate	the	output	for	the RBF	 network.	 The	 pseudo	 code	 in	 Listing	 7.5	 is	 provided	 to	 show	 the calculation	in	this	context.  Listing	7.5:	Calculating	an	RBF	Network  function	computeRBFNetwork  	input,	  	the	input	vector 	network	  	the	RBF	network 	 	 { 	  	First,	compute	the	output	values	of	each	of	the	RBFs. 	  	Add	one	additional	RBF	output	for	bias	 always	set	 	  	to	one . 	rbfOutput	=	alloc network.rbf.length	+	1 ; 	  	Bias	is	always	valued	1. 	rbfOutput[rbfOutput.length	-	1]	=	1;	 	for	rbfIndex	from	0	to	network.rbf.length 	{ 			  	weight	the	input 			weightedInput	=	alloc input.length ; 			for	inputIndex	from	0	to	input.length	 			{ 					memoryIndex	=	network.indexInputWeights	 					+	 rbfIndex	*	network.inputCount 	+	inputIndex; 					weightedInput[inputIndex]	=	input[inputIndex]	 							*	network.longTermMemory[memoryIndex]; 			} 			  	calculate	the	rbf 			rbfOutput[rbfIndex]	=	 			network.rbf[rbfIndex].evaluate weightedInput ; 	} 	  	Calculate	the	output,	which	is	the	result	 	  	of	the	weighted	result	of	the	RBFs. 	result	=	alloc network.outputCount ; 	for	outputIndex	from	0	to	result.length 	{ 			sum	=	0; 			for	rbfIndex	from	0	to	rbfOutput.length	 			{ 					  	Add	1	to	rbf	length	for	bias. 					memoryIndex	=	network.indexOutputWeights	 							+	 outputIndex	*	 network.rbf.length	+	1  	+	rbfIndex; 					sum	+=	rbfOutput[rbfIndex]	  SH   							*	network.longTermMemory[memoryIndex]; 			} 			result[outputIndex]	=	sum; 	} 	  	finally,	return	the	result. 	return	result; }  The	 above	 code	 calculates	 the	 final	 output	 in	 several	 layers.	 We	 create	 a variable	named	rbfOutput.	As	its	name	implies,	it	will	hold	the	outputs	from	the RBF	 functions.	 We	 loop	 over	 all	 of	 the	 RBF	 functions	 and	 calculate	 the weighted	 input	 to	 the	 RBF.	 The	 weighted	 input	 is	 simply	 a	 vector	 created	 by multiplying	each	input	by	that	RBF	function’s	input	coefficients.	On	Figure	7.3, these	are	the	coefficients	represented	by	the	vertical	group	of	arrows	closest	to the	 left.	 As	 each	 RBF	 function	 is	 calculated,	 the	 rbfOutput	 vector	 is	 filled, except	for	the	last	element	of	the	rbfOutput	vector.	The	last	element	gets	a	1 and	functions	as	the	bias	node.  Once	the	rbfOutput	vector	has	been	filled,	it	is	multiplied	by	the	output coefficients.	 The	 output	 coefficients	 are	 represented	 by	 the	 vertical	 column	 of arrows	closest	to	the	right	in	Figure	7.3.	The	calculated	output	values	are	placed into	 the	 result	 vector,	 and	 then	 the	 result	 vector	 is	 returned	 to	 the	 calling function.  Using	an	RBF	Network  Examples	for	using	RBF	networks	with	the	iris	data	set,	as	well	as	the	XOR data	set,	are	provided	below.	These	allow	you	to	see	how	the	RBF	network	can be	trained	to	learn	the	expected	output	for	both	XOR	and	iris.	First,	we	will	look at	the	output	from	the	XOR	training	with	greedy	random	training.  Iteration	999996,	Score=0.013418057671024912,	 Iteration	999997,	Score=0.013418057671024912,	 Iteration	999998,	Score=0.013418057671024912,	 Iteration	999999,	Score=0.013418057671024912,	 Iteration	1000000,	Score=0.013418057671024912,	 Final	score:	0.013418057671024912 [0.0,	0.0]	->	[-0.16770550224628078],	Ideal:	[0.0] [1.0,	0.0]	->	[0.9067663351025073],	Ideal:	[1.0] [0.0,	1.0]	->	[0.8703332321473845],	Ideal:	[1.0] [1.0,	1.0]	->	[0.0064115711694006094],	Ideal:	[0.0]  Of	course,	many	individual	iterations	were	skipped.	It	also	took	a	sizeable  SH   number	of	iterations	just	to	get	the	score	down	to	0.01.	You	can	see	from	the above	output	that	the	actual	output	does	not	exactly	match	the	idea.	For	the	first input	of	[0,0],	we	can	see	that	the	output	should	have	been	[0];	however,	it	was -0.16,	which	is	fairly	close.	The	two	outputs	that	should	have	been	[1.0]	are	both near	1.0,	at	0.906	and	0.87.  Training	to	the	iris	data	set	provides	the	following	output:  Iteration	99971,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99972,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99973,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99974,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99975,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99976,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99977,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99978,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99979,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99980,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99981,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99982,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99983,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99984,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99985,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99986,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99987,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99988,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99989,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99990,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99991,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99992,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99993,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99994,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99995,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99996,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99997,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99998,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	99999,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Iteration	100000,	Score=0.08747428121794937,	 Final	score:	0.08747428121794937  The	above	shows	that	the	training	continued	until	the	score	reached	0.08. This	 allowed	 the	 majority	 of	 the	 irises	 to	 be	 correctly	 classified,	 and	 was	 the result	of	using	greedy	random	training	and	a	very	large	number	of	iterations.	In the	next	chapter,	we	will	get	even	better	results	in	fewer	iterations	using	more advanced	training	algorithms.  SH   Chapter	Summary  This	 chapter	 introduced	 you	 to	 the	 fundamentals	 of	 training	 machine learning	algorithms.	Once	trained,	the	machine	learning	algorithm	should	be	able to	produce	output	close	to	what	you	would	expect	from	the	input.	When	input	is provided	 with	 the	 expected	 output,	 the	 algorithm	 has	 been	 provided	 with	 a training	set.	Training	sets	are	used	to	train	the	algorithms.  Most	 machine	 learning	 algorithms	 keep	 a	 long-term	 memory,	 which	 is adjusted	when	the	algorithm	is	trained.	This	long-term	memory	is	often	referred to	as	a	weight	or	coefficient,	and	is	typically	stored	in	a	vector.  This	chapter	described	the	greedy	random	training	algorithm.	The	greedy random	 training	 algorithm	 is	 a	 very	 simple	 training	 algorithm	 that	 assigns random	 values	 to	 long-term	 memory.	 New	 configurations	 are	 tried	 repeatedly and	the	best	configuration	is	kept.	This	is	a	very	simple	training	algorithm	that	is often	used	as	a	baseline	against	which	one	might	benchmark	other	algorithms.  We	trained	two	different	models	in	this	chapter:	a	simple	polynomial	and	an RBF	 model.	 The	 polynomial	 demonstrated	 how	 the	 greedy	 random	 algorithm can	be	applied	to	very	simple	equations.	We	were	able	to	approximate	the	three coefficients	used	in	the	polynomial.  The	 RBF	 model	 is	 based	 on	 radial	 basis	 functions,	 which	 are	 symmetric about	 a	 center.	 The	 RBF	 each	 have	 multi-dimensional	 centers	 and	 adjustable width	values,	although	the	width	of	an	RBF	is	consistent	across	all	dimensions. In	this	chapter,	we	used	a	Gaussian	RBF.  The	 RBF	 model	 can	 be	 used	 for	 classification	 or	 regression	 and	 uses training	algorithms	to	modify	its	long-term	memory.	The	long-term	memory	for the	RBF	model	is	made	up	coefficients,	RBF	widths,	and	RBF	centers.	The	RBF model	was	used	to	learn	the	iris	data	set.  The	next	chapter	will	introduce	additional	optimization	algorithms.	These algorithms	can	be	used	to	adjust	the	long-term	memory	vector	used	by	the	RBF network.	They	can	be	used	on	any	algorithm	that	stores	its	state	in	a	long-term memory-like	 vector.	 The	 next	 chapter	 will	 describe	 hill	 climbing,	 simulated annealing	and	Nelder	Mead	training	algorithms.  SH   Chapter	8:	Optimization	Training 	  Hill	Climbing Simulated	Annealing Nelder	Mead  This	 chapter	 will	 refine	 the	 concept	 of	 training	 a	 machine	 learning algorithm	 to	 provide	 more	 comiteplex	 approaches	 than	 those	 described	 in	 the previous	 chapter.	 There	 are	 many	 different	 algorithms	 for	 training	 machine learning	algorithms.	The	algorithms	presented	in	this	chapter	do	not	require	any specific	 insight	 into	 the	 long-term	 memory	 vector	 they	 are	 attempting	 to optimize.	This	makes	them	very	versatile	in	terms	of	what	they	can	train.  This	chapter	will	focus	on	optimizing	continuous	vectors,	which	are	those that	 are	 made	 up	 of	 floating	 point	 numbers.	 Chapter	 9	 will	 focus	 on	 discrete problems.  Hill	Climbing	Training  Hill	 climbing	 is	 only	 marginally	 more	 complex	 to	 implement	 than	 the greedy	random	algorithm.	One	of	the	main	disadvantages	of	the	greedy	random algorithm	is	that	there	is	no	refinement.	A	random	vector	is	chosen	for	the	long term	memory	and	then	immediately	replaced	if	a	better	random	vector	is	found. It	does	not	attempt	to	refine	a	potentially	good	solution,	but	looks	for	a	better one	at	random.  Hill	climbing	works	by	refining	the	current	vector,	which	is	why	the	name is	 actually	 very	 descriptive	 of	 the	 algorithm.	 Imagine	 that	 you	 are	 randomly placed	somewhere	in	the	middle	of	hilly	terrain	and	your	goal	is	to	climb	to	the highest	location	possible.	You	begin	by	looking	at	every	location	that	you	could reach	in	one	step	and	then	decide	what	step	you	are	going	to	take.	You	always decide	to	take	the	step	that	moves	you	the	highest.	This	process	is	repeated	until you	cannot	find	a	higher	step.	Once	you	cannot	find	a	higher	step,	the	process terminates.	With	hill	climbing,	the	process	terminates	at	the	nearest	high	point, which	is	often	called	a	local	maxima.  This	process	can	also	be	run	in	reverse,	if	you	seek	to	minimize.	Instead	of selecting	 the	 step	 that	 leads	 you	 to	 the	 highest	 possible	 position,	 you	 would  SH   select	the	step	that	leads	you	to	the	lowest	position.	The	lowest	position	is	called the	 local	 minima.	 Local	 minima	 and	 maxima	 are	 very	 important	 elements	 of training.  Using	this	same	analogy,	consider	if	you	started	out	somewhere	on	the	East Coast	of	the	United	States	and	used	hill	climbing	to	find	the	highest	place.	You would	probably	get	stuck	somewhere	in	the	Appalachian	mountains,	as	walking to	higher	ground	when	starting	on	the	East	Coast	would	lead	you	to	these	peaks, and	once	you	reached	the	peaks	there	would	be	no	way	to	step	higher.	However, they	are	not	the	highest	ground	in	the	world,	or	even	in	the	United	States.  This	example	presumes	you	are	walking	in	a	two	dimensional	space	on	the Earth’s	 surface.	 The	 third	 dimension,	 or	 altitude,	 does	 not	 count	 because	 you cannot	 directly	 change	 your	 altitude.	 You	 cannot	 fly!	 Yet,	 altitude	 is	 the objective.	Altitude	changes	based	your	movements	in	the	x	and	y	dimensions. Most	machine	learning	applications	will	have	much	more	than	two	dimensions. However,	 the	 principle	 is	 still	 the	 same—these	 applications	 just	 have	 more dimensions	to	search.  You	will	very	likely	never	find	a	global	maximum	or	minimum	for	anything but	a	very	trivial	algorithm.	Rather,	you	should	hope	to	find	successively	better local	 minima	 or	 maxima.	 If	 you	 find	 your	 training	 to	 be	 “stuck,”	 you	 will sometimes	have	to	randomize	and	start	over.	You	were	probably	stuck	in	a	local minima	or	maxima	 that	is,	stuck	in	the	Appalachians,	instead	of	reaching	the Himalayas .	Hill	climbing	is	greedy.	Hill	climbing	would	be	unwilling	to	give	up its	spot	on	top	of	the	Appalachians	to	ever	find	anything	else.  The	hill	climbing	algorithm	is	implemented	in	two	separate	functions.	The first	function	performs	an	initialization	for	the	hill	climbing	algorithm,	while	the second	function	shows	an	iteration.	We	begin	with	Listing	8.1,	which	shows	one iteration	of	the	hill	climbing	algorithm.	 Russell,	2009   Listing	8.1:	Hill	Climbing	Algorithm	 Initialization   function	initHillClimb  	ltm,	  	the	initial	long	term	memory 	acceleration,	  	the	acceleration 	initialVelocity	  	the	initial	step	size	in	each	dimension  	 { 	for	i	from	0	to	ltm.length	 	{ 			stepSize[i]	=	initialVelocity; 	}  SH   	candidate[0]	=	-acceleration; 	candidate[1]	=	-1	 	acceleration; 	candidate[2]	=	0; 	candidate[3]	=	1	 	acceleration; 	candidate[4]	=	acceleration; }  There	are	several	different	implementations	of	the	hill	climbing	algorithm; this	 implementation	 makes	 use	 of	 step	 size	 and	 acceleration.	 The	 algorithm assumes	that	it	will	accelerate	when	it	is	moving	in	a	direction	that	is	producing positive	results.  Listing	7.3	sets	up	two	vectors	for	the	algorithm	to	use.	The	stepSize	vector tracks	 how	 big	 a	 step	 the	 algorithm	 is	 able	 to	 move	 in	 each	 dimension.	 The parameter	for	this	is	defined	by	the	term	initialVelocity.	The	candidate	vector defines	five	potential	moves	that	the	algorithm	might	take.	The	algorithm	applies these	candidate	moves	to	each	dimension.	These	potential	moves	are	based	on the	 acceleration	 parameter.	 The	 acceleration	 and	 initialVelocity	 parameters will	affect	the	efficiency	of	your	training.	You	will	have	to	experiment	with	them in	order	to	gain	the	best	results.  Now	 that	 the	 algorithm	 has	 been	 initialized,	 we	 can	 begin	 processing iterations.	Listing	8.2	shows	the	iteration	function	of	the	hill	climbing	algorithm.  Listing	8.2:	Hill	Climbing	Algorithm	Iteration  function	iterateHillClimb ltm 	 { 	len	=	ltm.length;   	loop	over	all	dimensions	and	try	to	improve	each 	for	i	from	0	to	len 	{ 			best	=	-1;   	We	are	trying	to	minimize,	so	set	the	best	score	to	+Infinit.   	Everything	is	lower	than	that!	So	we	default	to	the	first   	score	considered.	 	bestScore	=	+Infinity;   	Try	each	of	the	candidate	moves	for	this	dimension. 			for	j	from	0	to	candidate.length	 			{   	Try	the	move	and	score,	but	back	out	the	move	once	scored. 					ltm[i]	=	ltm[i]	+	 stepSize[i]	*	candidate[j] ; 					temp	=	score.calculateScore ltm ; 					ltm[i]	=	ltm[i]	-	 stepSize[i]	*	candidate[j] ;   	Keep	track	of	what	dimension	 if	any 	had	the	best  SH     	improvement. 					if	 	temp	<	bestScore  					{ 							bestScore	=	temp; 							best	=	j; 					} 			} 	   	Now	that	we	are	done	with	the	current	dimension,	see	if   	any	other	step	produced	a	better	result.	If	so,	move	   	in	that	direction. 			if	 best	!=	-1 	 			{ 					ltm[i]	=	ltm[i]	+	 stepSize[i]	*	candidate[best] ; 					stepSize[i]	=	stepSize[i]	*	candidate[best]; 			} 		} }  The	above	iteration	function	should	be	called	until	calling	it	does	not	result in	a	move.	Once	no	further	movement	is	possible,	the	algorithm	has	reached	the local	 minima.	 The	 above	 function	 is	 designed	 to	 minimize	 the	 score	 function. Adapting	 it	 to	 minimize	 is	 relatively	 simple.	 The	 examples	 provided	 for	 this example	on	GitHub	support	both	minimization	and	maximization.  Hill	 climbing	 will	 typically	 perform	 better	 than	 the	 greedy	 random algorithm.	 However,	 like	 the	 greedy	 random	 algorithm,	 hill	 climbing	 is	 still typically	used	as	a	benchmark	algorithm.  The	 hill	 climbing	 implementation	 shown	 here	 optimizes	 continuous	 data, which	 has	 an	 infinite	 number	 of	 values	 between	 any	 two	 values.	 A	 different algorithm	is	used	for	optimization	of	discrete	values,	which	have	a	fixed	count. For	example,	the	number	of	cars	in	a	parking	lot	is	a	discreet	number—there	are no	fractional	cars.	Chapter	9	will	describe	how	to	optimize	for	discrete	values.  SH   Simulated	Annealing  Scott	 Kirkpatrick	 and	 several	 other	 researchers	 developed	 simulated annealing	in	the	mid-1970s.	It	was	originally	developed	to	better	optimize	the design	of	integrated	circuit	 IC 	chips	by	simulating	the	process	of	annealing.  Annealing	 is	 the	 metallurgical	 process	 of	 heating	 up	 a	 solid	 and	 then cooling	 it	 slowly	 until	 it	 crystallizes.	 The	 atoms	 of	 such	 materials	 have	 high- energy	 values	 at	 very	 high	 temperatures.	 This	 gives	 the	 atoms	 a	 great	 deal	 of freedom	in	their	ability	to	restructure	themselves.	As	the	temperature	is	reduced, the	energy	levels	of	the	atoms	decrease.	If	the	cooling	process	is	carried	out	too quickly—a	 situation	 called	 rapid	 quenching—many	 irregularities	 and	 defects will	be	seen	in	the	crystal	structure.	Ideally,	the	temperature	should	be	reduced slowly	to	allow	a	more	consistent	and	stable	crystal	structure	to	form,	which	will increase	the	metal’s	durability.  Simulated	annealing	seeks	to	emulate	the	annealing	process.	It	begins	at	a very	 high	 temperature,	 at	 which	 the	 long	 term	 memory	 values	 are	 allowed	 to assume	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 random	 values.	 As	 the	 training	 progresses,	 the “temperature”	is	allowed	to	fall,	thus	restricting	the	degree	to	which	the	memory are	 permitted	 to	 vary.	 This	 often	 leads	 the	 simulated	 annealing	 algorithm	 to	 a better	 solution,	 just	 as	 a	 metal	 achieves	 a	 better	 crystal	 structure	 through	 the annealing	process.	 Das,	2005   Simulated	Annealing	Applications  Given	 a	 specified	 number	 of	 inputs	 for	 an	 arbitrary	 equation,	 simulated annealing	can	be	used	to	determine	what	inputs	will	produce	the	minimum	result for	 the	 equation.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 the	 traveling	 salesman,	 this	 equation	 is	 the calculation	 of	 the	 total	 distance	 the	 salesman	 must	 travel.	 It	 is	 the	 error calculation	or	scoring	function	for	a	machine-learning	algorithm.  When	 simulated	 annealing	 was	 first	 introduced,	 the	 algorithm	 was	 very popular	for	integrated	circuit	 IC 	chip	design.	Most	IC	chips	are	composed	of many	internal	logic	gates,	which	allow	the	chip	to	accomplish	the	tasks	that	it was	designed	to	perform.	Just	as	algebraic	equations	can	often	be	simplified,	so too	can	IC	chip	layouts.  SH   Simulated	annealing	is	often	used	to	find	an	IC	chip	design	that	has	fewer logic	gates	than	the	original.	The	result	is	a	chip	that	generates	less	heat	and	runs faster.	The	long	term	memory	vector	of	a	machine	learning	algorithm	provides an	 excellent	 vector	 to	 optimize.	 Different	 memory	 values	 are	 used	 for	 the algorithm	until	one	is	found	that	produces	a	sufficiently	low	return	from	the	error function.  Simulated	Annealing	Algorithm  The	 simulated	 annealing	 algorithm	 is	 similar	 to	 hill	 climbing	 in	 that	 it considers	 what	 moves	 it	 can	 make	 from	 its	 current	 position.	 These	 moves	 are evaluated	 randomly.	 If	 the	 randomly	 chosen	 move	 has	 a	 better	 score,	 than	 the current	 position,	 then	 the	 algorithm	 moves	 to	 the	 new	 position.	 If	 the	 new position	is	a	worse	score,	then	the	new	position	will	be	accepted	with	random probability.	 This	 random	 probability	 is	 higher	 if	 the	 temperature	 is	 higher,	 as summarized	in	Figure	8.1.  Figure	8.1:	Simulated	Annealing	Flowchart  SH   SH   The	ability	to	take	on	a	worse	score	is	an	important	distinction.	Simulation annealing	is	not	as	greedy	as	the	greedy	random	algorithm.	Simulated	annealing will	sometimes	take	one	step	backwards	to	potentially	take	two	steps	forward.  The	pseudo	code	to	the	complete	algorithm	is	provided	in	Listing	8.3.

The	 iteration	 begins	 by	 obtaining	 the	 current	 temperature	 from	 the cooling	schedule.	This	temperature	will	remain	the	same	for	the	entire	iteration. The	 iteration	 will	 execute	 a	 defined	 number	 of	 cycles.	 For	 each	 cycle,	 the algorithm	will	attempt	to	move	from	the	current	position.	Each	cycle	will	take place	at	the	same	temperature.  For	each	cycle,	a	random	position	is	chosen.	This	random	position	is	based on	the	current	position.	Because	of	this,	only	close	positions	will	be	considered. If	 the	 new	 position	 has	 a	 better	 score	 than	 the	 current	 position,	 then	 the algorithm	moves	to	the	new	position.	Otherwise,	it	calculates	a	probability	based on	the	previous	error,	the	current	error,	and	the	current	temperature.	The	exact process	used	to	calculate	the	probability	will	be	described	later	in	this	chapter.  At	the	end	of	the	iteration,	the	algorithm	checks	to	see	if	it	has	surpassed any	previous	best	solutions.	In	this	regard,	the	algorithm	is	ultimately	somewhat “greedy”	in	that	it	always	keeps	the	best	solution	that	it	has	found	so	far.  Cooling	Schedule  The	cooling	schedule	defines	how	quickly	the	temperature	will	fall	during the	 simulated	 annealing	 iterations.	 The	 temperature	 determines	 the	 likelihood that	an	algorithm	will	move	to	a	new	position	with	a	worse	score.	It	is	best	if	this probability	is	higher	in	the	beginning	phases	of	the	training.	Once	the	training has	 run	 for	 a	 longer	 time,	 it	 is	 best	 if	 the	 probability	 of	 moving	 to	 a	 worse position	is	much	less.	This	allows	the	algorithm	to	narrow	in	on	a	more	optimal solution.	The	following	equation	is	used	to	calculate	the	cooling	schedule.  Equation	8.1:	Cooling	Schedule  SH   The	 above	 equation	 calculates	 the	 temperature	 for	 iteration	 number	 k.  There	are	a	few	things	to	keep	in	mind	when	setting	the	equation. 	  The	equation	must	also	be	provided	with	the	initial	and	final	temperatures, as	well	as	the	max	number	of	iterations. It	is	not	necessary	that	you	use	this	equation	exactly. It	is	important	that	the	temperature	decrease	as	training	progresses. Do	not	choose	zero	as	the	final	temperature	in	the	above	equation.	It	is	okay to	 choose	 something	 close	 to	 zero,	 however.	 Because	 the	 above	 equation multiplies	by	the	final	temperature,	having	a	final	temperature	of	zero	will quickly	take	the	current	temperature	to	zero.  You	can	see	this	cooling	schedule	in	Figure	8.2.  Figure	8.2:	Cooling	from	1,000	to	10,500	Iterations  The	temperature	is	used	to	determine	the	probability	that	the	algorithm	will  accept	an	inferior	score.  Annealing	Probability  Simulated	 annealing	 always	 attempts	 to	 move	 the	 algorithm	 to	 random locations.	Sometimes	these	random	locations	will	not	produce	as	good	a	score	as the	 previous	 location.	 A	 completely	 greedy	 algorithm	 would	 never	 consider	 a new	 position	 that	 produces	 a	 worse	 score.	 However,	 such	 an	 outlook	 can	 be  SH   counterproductive.	You	might	have	to	go	through	a	few	valleys	before	you	find the	top	of	the	highest	mountain!  We	will	compute	the	probability	that	the	simulated	annealing	algorithm	will  accept	a	worse	score	as	a	function	of	the	following	three	inputs: 	  Current	error Previous	error Current	temperature  Equation	8.2	makes	use	of	all	of	these.  Equation	8.2:	Annealing	Probability  The	 probability	 function	 accepts	 the	 previous	 error,	 current	 error,	 and current	temperature.	The	probability	function	returns	a	number	between	0	and	1. A	value	of	one	means	a	100%	likelihood	of	selecting	a	worse	score,	and	a	value of	zero	means	there	is	no	likelihood	of	selecting	a	worse	score.	These	numbers can	easily	be	compared	against	random	numbers.	If	the	random	number	is	less than	the	probability,	then	we	will	accept	the	solution	with	an	inferior	score.  Equation	8.2	returns	higher	probabilities	for	higher	temperatures.	However, the	increase	in	error	is	also	considered.	The	larger	the	increase	in	error,	the	new position	is	less	likely	to	be	accepted.  Simulated	annealing	can	also	be	used	to	train	the	RBF	networks	introduced in	the	last	chapter.	It	allows	for	more	efficient	learning	than	could	be	achieved with	the	hill	climbing	and	greedy	random	algorithms	alone.  SH   Nelder	Mead  The	Nelder	Mead	algorithm	was	proposed	by	John	Nelder	and	Roger	Mead  Nelder,	 1965 .	 It	 is	 an	 optimization	 algorithm	 that	 can	 be	 used	 to	 optimize vectors	to	a	scoring	function.	The	Nelder	Mead	method	is	sometimes	called	the downhill	simplex	method	or	amoeba	method.	Nelder	Mead	is	relatively	easy	to visualize	and	understand.	It	is	also	a	generally	effective	solutions	finder.	It	thus provides	a	great	introduction	to	advanced	training	algorithms.  Nelder	 Mead	 works	 by	 constructing	 a	 simplex.	 A	 simplex	 is	 a	 geometric shape	 that	 has	 a	 number	 of	 vertices	 equal	 to	 N+1,	 where	 N	 is	 the	 number	 of dimensions	in	the	problem.	A	vertex	is	a	point	in	space.	These	vertices	become the	corners	of	a	geometric	shape	called	a	simplex.	Lines	are	drawn	to	form	new shapes	that	connect	vertices,	or	corners.	If	we	were	optimizing	a	vector	with	two dimensions,	we	would	have	a	simplex	in	the	shape	of	a	triangle.  The	 simplex	 is	 simply	 a	 list	 of	 potential	 solutions.	 The	 algorithm	 always keeps	 N+1	 potential	 solutions,	 and	 so	 the	 simplex	 will	 change	 its	 shape	 as training	progresses.	Once	the	training	has	reached	an	advanced	state,	the	simplex has	most	become	very	small.	At	this	point,	we	can	find	the	solution	by	selecting the	vertex	with	the	best	score.  The	 Nelder	 Mead	 algorithm	 can	 also	 be	 used	 to	 train	 the	 RBF	 networks introduced	 in	 the	 last	 chapter.	 It	 is	 able	 to	 converge	 to	 a	 low	 error	 faster	 than greedy	random,	hill	climbing,	and	often	simulated	annealing	algorithms.  Nelder	Mead	always	begins	with	an	initial	guess	as	to	the	solution	vector.	If you	 cannot	 make	 an	 educated	 guess,	 then	 choose	 a	 random	 vector.	 If	 you previously	trained	with	another	algorithm,	you	can	use	your	result	from	the	last algorithm	as	the	initial	guess,	and	Nelder	Mead	will	further	refine	the	solution. This	also	works	if	you	want	to	refine	a	previous	Nelder	Mead	solution.  The	initial	solution	becomes	one	of	the	vertices	of	the	starting	simplex.	If we	have	two	dimensions,	then	we	need	to	generate	two	additional	vertices.	The simplex	 is	 always	 constructed	 of	 N+1	 vertices,	 where	 N	 is	 the	 number	 of dimensions.	It	is	important	that	you	not	confuse	dimension	with	vertex.	A	vertex is	a	point	made	up	of	one	or	more	dimensions.  We	 will	 now	 consider	 Nelder	 Mead	 for	 two	 dimensions.	 The	 following  SH   would	be	true	in	this	case. 	  Dimensions	=	N	=	2 Vertices	=	N+1	=	3	 a	triangle  Simplex:	A	collection	of	3	vertices,	each	having	2	dimensions	 resulting	in the	shape	of	a	triangle   The	 first	 step	 for	 Nelder	 Mead	 is	 to	 generate	 the	 initial	 simplex.	 This simplex	 will	 be	 refined	 as	 the	 iterations	 progress.	 The	 initial	 simplex	 always takes	 the	 initial	 solution	 vector	 as	 one	 of	 the	 starting	 vertices.	 The	 other	 N vertices	 are	 created	 by	 moving	 one	 of	 the	 N	 dimensions	 by	 a	 set	 amount. Typically,	the	sides	of	the	initial	simplex	are	set	to	be	of	the	same	length.  Figure	 8.3	 shows	 a	 visualization	 of	 a	 three	 vertex	 simplex	 in	 two  dimensions.  Figure	8.3:	Nelder	Mead	Simplex  The	above	graph	is	a	topology	map.	I	sometimes	like	to	think	of	the	vertices in	the	above	figure	as	members	of	a	search	party	covering	rugged	terrain.	All	are looking	for	the	optimal	point	on	the	map.	The	optimal	point	might	be	a	high	or	a low,	 depending	 on	 how	 you	 define	 a	 good	 score.	 In	 a	 nutshell,	 Nelder	 Mead works	by	moving	the	searcher	who	is	in	the	worst	position	to	a	new	location	that is	based	on	the	better	positions	of	the	other	two.  The	 minimum	 that	 the	 depicted	 simplex	 is	 moving	 toward	 is	 in	 the	 large oval-like	area	in	the	top-right.	The	vertices	are	labeled	X,	although	they	are	not  SH   to	be	confused	with	x	and	y	dimensions.	The	three	X	vertices	are	labeled	h,	s, and	l.	They	are	the	worst,	second	worst,	and	the	best	vertices,	respectively.  Iterations	of	Nelder	Mead	consist	of	the	following	steps:  	  Step	1.	Find	the	worst,	second	worst,	and	best	points	of	the	vertex. Step	2.	Reflect	the	worst	to	a	better	point	through	the	best	side. Step	3.	If	the	reflection	is	successful,	expand. Step	4.	If	the	reflection	it	unsuccessful,	contract.  Reflection  Figure	8.4:	Reflection  Reflection	is	the	first	step	in	the	Nelder	Mead	algorithm.	The	worst	vertex will	be	the	one	considering	a	move.	Figure	8.4	shows	the	basic	setup	for	moving by	reflection.  SH   The	current	simplex	is	depicted	by	the	solid	lines,	and	the	worst	position	is Xh.	To	reflect	Xh,	the	average	is	taken	between	Xs	and	Xl.	This	gives	a	center, which	 is	 labeled	 as	 c	 in	 the	 figure	 above.	 If	 you	 consider	 the	 search	 party example,	the	farthest	off	searcher	 Xh 	looks	in	the	direction	of	the	other	two	and points	 at	 the	 center	 point	  the	 average 	 between	 them	 as	 the	 best	 place	 to	 go. Because	the	other	two	are	in	better	locations	than	him,	the	searcher	must	assume that	anything	behind	him	is	also	worse.	He	must	move	toward	the	other	two,	so he	visualizes	a	point	well	beyond	them,	at	point	Xr.	He	visualizes	a	point	well beyond	because	he	aspires	to	become	the	best	searcher!  After	selecting	the	point	at	Xr,	the	point	is	now	evaluated.	Was	it	actually	a  SH   better	location?	If	it	was,	then	we	continue	by	implementing	expansion.	If	not, then	we	continue	by	implementing	contraction.  Expansion  Continuing	the	example	from	before,	the	Xh	searcher	has	seen	that	he	could improve	his	ranking	by	moving	to	Xr.	Now	he	gets	a	little	greedy,	and	wants	to move	farther.	If	we	are	climbing	down	a	valley,	then	going	to	a	farther	point	will probably	get	us	to	the	optimal	point	faster.	Figure	8.5	depicts	this	scenario.  Figure	8.5:	Expansion  SH   The	searcher	at	Xh	evaluated	the	spot	at	Xr.	It	was	an	improvement.	So	he became	greedy	and	jumped	right	to	Xe	without	checking	Xe.	This	is	okay,	since even	if	he	overshoots,	he	was	at	the	worst	spot	to	begin	with.  This	ends	the	iteration.	The	next	iteration	re-evaluates	all	of	the	vertices	and  determines	which	is	now	the	farthest	off.  Contraction  Contraction	occurs	when	the	reflection	point	does	not	improve	the	rank	of  SH   the	worst	point.	Figure	8.6	shows	the	contraction	scenario.  Figure	8.6:	Contraction  Continuing	with	the	searcher	analogy,	the	worst	searcher	at	Xh	had	dreams of	moving	to	Xr	and	getting	a	better	rank.	However,	if	the	position	at	Xr	had	an even	worse	score,	all	we	can	do	is	move	closer	to	the	other	two	searchers.	We still	point	toward	the	center	of	the	two	other	searchers	but,	since	our	hopes	have been	dashed,	we	do	not	move	beyond	them.	We	move	somewhere	in	the	middle of	the	simplex,	to	location	Xc.	Hopefully	this	improves	our	rank.	Either	way,	the iteration	 is	 now	 done.	 The	 next	 iteration	 will	 rank	 the	 vertices	 again	 and continue.  SH   Finishing	the	Nelder	Mead	Algorithm  It	 is	 important	 to	 know	 when	 to	 terminate	 an	 iterative	 algorithm	 such	 as Nelder	Mead.	This	algorithm	typically	terminates	based	on	the	following	three criteria. 	  A	maximum	number	of	iterations	is	exceeded. The	score	is	good	enough. The	vertices	have	become	“close	enough”	to	each	other.  Once	 the	 algorithm	 completes,	 we	 consider	 the	 best	 vertex	 to	 be	 the solution.	If	the	vertices	have	become	close	together,	another	option	is	to	restart the	algorithm	by	building	a	new	simplex	based	on	the	best	vertex.	The	search can	then	begin	anew.  Nelder	Mead	is	relatively	efficient	in	that	only	one	of	the	vertices	needs	to be	 reevaluated	 with	 each	 iteration.	 In	 machine	 learning,	 most	 computer processing	time	is	spent	evaluating	against	the	training	data.	With	Nelder	Mead, it	 is	 only	 necessary	 to	 reevaluate	 one	 vertex	 because	 only	 the	 worst	 vertex moves.  In	 addition	  to	 reflection,	 contraction	 and	 expansion,	 some	 older implementations	of	Nelder	Mead	also	made	use	of	a	shrink	step.	Later	research found	 the	 shrink	 step	 to	 be	 unnecessary,	 however,	 and	 most	 modern implementations	of	Nelder	Mead	do	not	include	it.  Unlike	greedy	random,	simulated	annealing	and	hill	climbing,	Nelder	Mead performs	a	coordinated	search	from	multiple	locations	at	once.	Such	coordinated searches	are	very	common	in	even	more	advanced	algorithms.	Particle	Swarm Optimization	  PSO 	 and	 Genetic	 Algorithms	 both	 use	 many	 multiple coordinated	solutions.  SH   Chapter	Summary  This	 chapter	 introduced	 you	 to	 three	 optimization	 algorithms	 that	 can	 be used	for	training.	These	algorithms	are	designed	to	optimize	individual	values	in a	vector	to	obtain	a	better	score	for	the	model	being	trained.	This	vector	is	the long	term	memory	for	any	of	the	machine	learning	algorithms	we	have	seen	so far.  Hill	climbing	is	a	simple	search	optimization	algorithm.	It	starts	at	a	vector location	and	evaluates	moves	that	can	be	made	from	that	vector.	Whatever	move results	 in	 the	 largest	 improvement	 to	 the	 score	 is	 taken.	 Hill	 climbing	 is	 very susceptible	 to	 local	 minima	 and	 maxima.	 Once	 hill	 climbing	 reaches	 a	 point where	it	can	no	longer	find	a	better	solution,	the	algorithm	is	complete.  Simulated	 annealing	 works	 somewhat	 like	 hill	 climbing,	 except	 that simulated	annealing	is	sometimes	willing	to	move	to	a	position	that	has	a	lower score	than	the	current	position.	Nelder	Mead	is	another	training	algorithm	that can	be	used	to	optimize	a	vector.  This	chapter	focused	on	continuous	optimization	algorithms.	A	continuous optimization	 algorithm	 deals	 primarily	 with	 floating	 point	 numbers.	 However, some	 optimization	 algorithms	 may	 be	 used	 on	 discrete	 data.	 The	 next	 chapter will	demonstrate	the	optimization	of	discrete	data.  SH   Chapter	9:	Discrete	Optimization 	  Discrete	vs.	Continuous The	Knapsack	Problem The	Traveling	Salesman	Problem  the	  In	 the	 last	 chapter,	 we	 saw	 that	 simulated	 annealing	 could	 be	 used	 to optimize	 long-term	 memory	 of	 machine-learning	 algorithms.	 The optimization	 occurred	 against	 the	 long-term	 memory	 vector	 of	 a	 machine- learning	 algorithm.	 This	 vector	 was	 composed	 of	 continuous	 floating-point numbers.	 With	 continuous	 vectors,	 there	 is	 an	 infinite	 amount	 of	 additional numbers	between	two	consecutive	whole	numbers.	This	is	continuous	data.	Not all	data	is	continuous.  This	 chapter	 will	 focus	 on	 using	 simulated	 annealing	 to	 analyze	 discrete problems,	 particularly	 focusing	 on	 the	 traveling	 salesman	 problem	 and	 the knapsack	problem.	The	traveling	salesman	problem	is	discrete	because	it	seeks to	find	 the	most	 optimal	route	 to	 visit	a	 fixed	number	 of	cities.	 The	 knapsack problem	is	discrete	because	it	seeks	to	find	an	optimal	set	of	items	to	put	into	a finite	knapsack.	Discrete	data	always	deals	with	a	finite	number	of	items.  SH   The	Traveling	Salesman	Problem  Simulated	 annealing	 is	 commonly	 used	 to	 solve	 the	 traveling	 salesman problem	 TSP ,	because	the	TSP	is	an	NP-hard	problem	that	generally	cannot	be solved	by	traditional	iterative	algorithms.	TSP	is	one	of	most	famous	computer science	problems.	We	will	now	see	how	to	apply	simulated	annealing	to	it.  Understanding	the	Traveling	Salesman	Problem  The	traveling	salesman	problem	involves	determining	the	shortest	route	for a	“traveling	salesman”	who	must	visit	a	certain	number	of	cities.	The	salesman	is allowed	to	begin	and	end	at	any	city,	but	must	visit	each	city	once	and	only	once. There	are	several	variants	of	the	TSP,	some	of	which	allow	multiple	visitations to	cities	or	assign	different	values	to	different	cities.	The	TSP	we	will	evaluate	in this	 chapter	 simply	 seeks	 the	 shortest	 route	 to	 visit	 each	 city	 once.	 The	 TSP problem	and	shortest	route	used	in	this	chapter	are	shown	in	Figure	9.1.  Figure	9.1:	The	Traveling	Salesman  SH   It	 may	 seem	 like	 finding	 the	 shortest	 route	 would	 be	 an	 easy	 task	 for	 a normal	 iterative	 program.	 However,	 as	 the	 number	 of	 cities	 increases,	 the number	 of	 possible	 combinations	 increases	 drastically.	 If	 there	 are	 one	 or	 two cities,	 only	 one	 route	 is	 possible.	 If	 there	 are	 three	 cities,	 the	 possible	 routes increase	to	six,	however.	The	follow	list	shows	how	quickly	the	number	of	paths grow!  1	city	has	1	path 2	cities	have	1	path 3	cities	have	6	paths 4	cities	have	24	paths 5	cities	have	120	paths 6	cities	have	720	paths  SH   7	cities	have	5,040	paths 8	cities	have	40,320	paths 9	cities	have	362,880	paths 10	cities	have	3,628,800	paths 11	cities	have	39,916,800	paths 12	cities	have	479,001,600	paths 13	cities	have	6,227,020,800	paths ... 50	cities	have	3.041	*	10^64	paths  The	 formula	 used	 to	 collect	 data	 for	 the	 above	 table	 is	 the	 factorial.	 The number	of	cities,	n,	is	calculated	using	the	factorial	operator	 ! .	The	factorial	of some	arbitrary	value	n	is	given	by	n	*	 n	–	1 	*	 n	–	2 	*	...	*	3	*	2	*	1.	These values	become	incredibly	large	when	a	program	must	do	a	“brute	force”	search. However,	a	simulated	annealing	algorithm	such	as	the	sample	program	examined in	the	next	section	finds	the	solution	to	a	50-city	problem	in	a	matter	of	minutes.  Behzad,	2002   Implementing	the	Traveling	Salesman	Problem  So	 far,	 we	 have	 discussed	 the	 basic	 principles	 of	 continuous	 simulated annealing	 algorithms	 in	 previous	 chapters.	 The	 discrete	 version	 of	 simulated annealing	is	not	too	different	from	the	continuous	version	that	we	saw	in	Chapter 8.	The	flow	chart	remains	the	same	as	what	we	saw	in	Figure	8.1.	The	difference is	in	how	we	move	from	the	current	position.  To	conduct	continuous	simulated	annealing,	we	would	add	a	random	value to	 one	 or	 more	 dimensions	 to	 move	 from	 the	 current	 position.	 In	 discrete simulated	annealing,	on	the	other	hand,	we	need	to	be	a	little	more	creative.	In the	 context	 of	 the	 TSP,	 each	 solution	 is	 a	 path	 through	 the	 cities.	 Our	 current position	is	this	path.	Moving	to	a	new	“position”	means	choosing	a	path	similar to	the	current	path.  It	is	important	not	to	confuse	the	term	“position”	with	city	location.	In	this context,	it	does	not	refer	to	any	particular	“position”	within	the	map	of	the	cities. Rather,	it	describes	one	path	among	all	possible	paths	to	navigate	that	particular map.	To	move	from	one	path	to	another,	we	simply	flip	the	order	of	two	cities	in the	original	path.	Flipping	two	cities	ensures	that	we	do	not	introduce	a	duplicate city.  To	 use	 simulated	 annealing,	 you	 must	 first	 generate	 an	 initial	 random solution.	For	TSP,	this	is	a	random	list	of	the	cities,	with	no	duplicates.	Then	you  SH   must	provide	a	means	of	creating	a	new	solution	through	the	implementation	of a	slight,	randomized	change	For	TSP,	we	simply	flip	the	order	in	which	the	path visits	two	cities.	This	is	implemented	by	choosing	two	random	indexes	 that	are not	the	same 	and	exchanging	their	locations	on	the	list.  There	 are	 three	 things	 that	 you	 must	 provide	 to	 any	 simulated	 annealing  algorithm	implementation. 	  A	scoring	function	to	evaluate	each	position. A	means	of	generating	an	initial	random	potential	solution. A	 means	 of	 moving	 to	 a	 new	 random	 position	 based	 on	 your	 current position.  This	 is	 no	 different	 from	 continuous	 simulated	 annealing.	 The	 primary difference	between	the	continuous	and	discrete	annealing	is	in	how	these	three aspects	are	implemented.	For	the	traveling	salesman	problem,	the	score	is	simply the	 distance	 traveled,	 which	 is	 scored	 more	 highly	 as	 the	 distance	 travelled minimizes.	The	initial	solution	is	the	generation	of	a	random,	non-repeating	list of	cities.	Movement	to	the	new	random	position	is	implemented	by	flipping	two cities.  SH   Circular	TSP  How	 can	 we	 evaluate	 an	 algorithms	 effectiveness	 with	 an	 NP-Hard problem?	 For	 an	 NP-Hard	 problem	 we	 often	 do	 not	 know	 the	 actual	 correct answer.	This	can	make	it	very	difficult	to	know	exactly	how	close	the	algorithm has	come	to	an	optimal	solution.	There	is	a	way	to	test	the	simulated	annealing algorithm	on	a	TSP,	however.	We	can	arrange	the	cities	in	a	circle.	If	the	cities are	arranged	in	a	circle,	or	oval,	then	the	optimal	path	should	run	the	perimeter of	 the	 shape.	 Figure	 9.2	 shows	 simulated	 annealing	 trying	 to	 optimize	 a	 path through	cities	arranged	in	an	oval.  Figure	9.2:	Annealing	an	Oval	Path  The	annealing	algorithm	above	came	close	to	an	optimal	solution.	However, it	 is	 not	 perfect.	 This	 is	 okay.	 You	 can	 rarely	 find	 a	 global	 optimum	 in	 any situation.	 It	 is	 only	 because	 we	 have	 insight	 into	 geometry	 that	 we	 can immediately	spot	that	this	path	is	not	perfect.	If	you	have	insight	into	a	problem that	can	help	to	solve	it,	then	by	all	means,	use	it!	AI	is	most	useful	when	you have	no	other	way	to	solve	a	problem.  SH   The	Knapsack	Problem  The	 knapsack	 problem	 is	 a	 combinational	 optimization	 problem	 that	 has been	 around	 as	 early	 as	 the	 late	 1800s.	 The	 origin	 of	 the	 name	 is	 unknown, although	 mathematician	 Tobias	 Dantzig	 suggested	 that	 the	 knapsack	 problem may	have	originated	as	a	folk	story	long	before	a	formal	mathematical	problem was	set	down.  Understanding	the	Knapsack	Problem  The	knapsack	problem	describes	the	dilemma	of	a	burglar	inside	of	a	store. He	is	surrounded	by	merchandise,	but	he	only	has	one	knapsack.	What	should the	burglar	take	to	maximize	his	profit?	The	combination	of	items	must	fit	inside his	knapsack.  In	 fact,	 anyone	 who	 has	 packed	 for	 a	 trip	 has	 faced	 a	 variant	 of	 the knapsack	problem.	Figure	9.3	shows	a	knapsack	and	some	items	one	might	want for	an	overnight	camping	trip.  Figure	9.3:	The	Knapsack	Problem  SH   SH   The	knapsack	problem	is	a	discrete	problem.	You	can	only	select	a	fixed number	 of	 items	 and	 you	 are	 typically	 allowed	 to	 choose	 only	 zero	 or	 one	 of each	item.	This	is	the	most	common	type	of	knapsack	problem	and	it	is	called	a 0-1	 problem.	 Other	 variants	 allow	 for	 the	 selection	 of	 more	 than	 one	 of	 each individual	 item.	 The	 items	 are	 typically	 provided	 to	 the	 problem	 with	 weights and	profit	scores.	You	might	wonder	about	volume	in	the	knapsack	problem.	By convention,	 the	 knapsack	 problem	 does	 not	 consider	 volume.	 The	 maximum weight	that	will	fit	in	the	knapsack	is	also	specified.	 Pisinger,	2003   Implementing	the	Knapsack	Problem  Discrete	 simulated	 annealing	 can	 easily	 be	 applied	 to	 the	 knapsack problem.	It	is	very	important	to	think	about	how	you	might	want	to	represent	this problem.	In	the	context	of	the	knapsack	problem,	a	solution	is	a	list	of	items	that does	not	exceed	the	weight	limit	imposed	by	the	knapsack.  The	best	way	to	represent	a	potential	knapsack	solution	is	with	a	vector	that has	 dimensions	 equal	 to	 the	 number	 of	 unique	 items	 that	 can	 be	 added	 to	 the knapsack.	 Each	 item’s	 element	 in	 this	 vector	 will	 contain	 a	 whole	 number representing	the	count	of	that	item	taken.	For	example,	Figure	9.3	describes	the potential	for	bringing	the	following	items.  Coffee	thermos	 weight=5,profit=1 :	false	 Baseball	cap	 weight=1,	profit=1 :	true Blanket	 weight=3,	profit=10 :	true Bottle	of	water	 weight=2,	profit=25 :	true  Out	 knapsack	 can	 hold	 a	 max	 weight	 of	 7.	 The	 coffee	 thermos	 has	 been deemed	 unworthy,	 so	 that	 value	 is	 false.	 The	 rest	 has	 been	 determined	 to	 be profitable,	so	their	values	are	true.	The	resulting	weight	is	6,	which	is	below	the maximum	weight	of	7.	Adding	the	coffee	would	put	us	over	the	weight,	while replacing	anything	else	with	the	coffee	would	reduce	our	profit.  We	 now	 have	 a	 way	 to	 represent	 the	 solution.	 We	 must	 provide	 certain  things	to	the	simulated	annealing	algorithm. 	  A	scoring	function	to	evaluate	each	position	 set	of	items . A	means	of	generating	an	initial	random	potential	solution. A	means	of	moving	to	a	new	random	position	based	on	the	current	position.  SH   Simulated	 annealing	 always	 solves	 a	 minimization	 problem.	 This	 aspect must	be	considered	during	the	creation	of	the	scoring	function.	We	would	like	to tie	 the	 maximum	 score	 to	 the	 profit	 generated	 by	 each	 item	 we	 take.	 The theoretical	maximum	profit	is	the	sum	of	the	profit	of	all	items.	If	all	the	items fit	in	the	knapsack,	the	theoretical	maximum	profit	is	attainable—otherwise,	it	is not.  We	 will	 use	 the	 difference	 between	 our	 current	 profit	 and	 the	 theoretical maximum	as	the	best	score.	It	is	unlikely	that	we	will	ever	get	the	optimal	score of	zero,	which	would	indicate	that	every	item	can	fit	in	the	knapsack.	If	they	can all	fit,	it	hardly	seems	worthwhile	to	consider	the	problem.	Rather,	we	instead attempt	to	approach	perfection.  Another	 important	 feature	 to	 consider	 for	 the	 scoring	 function	 is	 what happens	if	the	knapsack’s	maximum	weight	is	exceeded	in	the	solution.	Ideally, our	 randomization	 would	 never	 let	 this	 happen.	 However,	 it	 does	 not	 hurt	 to check	 the	 maximum	 weight	 in	 the	 scoring	 function	 as	 well.	 If	 the	 knapsack’s maximum	 weight	 is	 exceeded,	 then	 the	 score	 should	 be	 pushed	 out	 to	 a	 very large	value.	This	will	cause	any	invalid	knapsack	configuration	to	be	discarded by	the	algorithm.  To	 meet	 the	 second	 provision	 to	 simulated	 annealing,	 we	 need	 a	 way	 to initialize	a	random	solution.	To	initialize	the	first	solution,	start	with	an	empty knapsack	and	add	items	to	it	one	at	a	time.	Once	we	add	an	item	that	exceeds	the maximum	weight	of	the	knapsack,	remove	that	item	and	consider	the	knapsack initialized.  To	meet	the	third	provision	to	simulated	annealing,	we	need	to	generate	a new	position	based	on	the	current	position.	To	randomize	to	a	new	state,	add	a new	item	that	is	not	already	in	the	knapsack.	If	this	sets	us	over	the	maximum weight,	choose	a	random	item	and	remove	it.	Continue	to	remove	items	until	the knapsack	is	below	the	maximum	weight.	The	result	will	be	the	new	position.  SH   Chapter	Summary  This	 chapter	 looked	 at	 how	 we	 might	 apply	 simulated	 annealing	 to	 a discrete	 problem.	 Discrete	 solutions	 are	 usually	 members	 of	 a	 finite	 set.	 For example,	whole	numbers	in	a	range	are	discreet,	as	are	colors.  There	are	very	few	differences	between	a	continuous	simulated	annealing  algorithm	and	a	discrete	one.	Both	require	three	components: 	  A	scoring	function. A	way	to	generate	an	initial	random	solution. A	 means	 of	 slightly	 changing	 a	 solution	 as	 we	 iterate	 through	 potential solutions.  The	traveling	salesman	problem	was	introduced	as	a	discrete	problem.	The traveling	salesman	seeks	the	shortest	possible	path	through	a	number	of	cities. Brute	force	cannot	be	applied	to	this	problem,	as	there	are	too	many	possibilities. Simulating	annealing	can	be	used	to	find	an	acceptable	solution,	however.	The end	result	from	simulated	annealing	may	not	be	the	global	optimum,	however,	as finding	the	best	solution	is	typically	NP-Hard.  The	knapsack	problem	is	also	discrete.	This	problem	requires	you	to	choose from	a	list	of	items	that	have	varying	weights	and	profit	values	to	pack	into	a knapsack	that	can	only	hold	so	much	weight.	The	goal	is	to	maximize	the	profit for	the	weight	our	knapsack	can	hold.  The	next	chapter	will	conclude	this	book	by	introducing	linear	regression and	general	linear	models.	These	are	two	very	common	statistical	models	that can	 be	 used	 with	 machine	 learning.	 Both	 linear	 regression	 and	 general	 linear models	are	valuable	when	used	alone	or	as	part	of	a	larger	algorithm.  SH   Chapter	10:	Linear	Regression 	  Linear	Regression Generalized	Linear	Model	 GLM  Link	Function  This	 chapter	 will	 explore	 linear	 regression	 and	 generalized	 linear	 models  GLM .	 These	 are	 related	 statistical	 models	 that	 allow	 relationships	 to	 be established	 between	 input	 and	 output	 vectors.	 The	 input	 vector	 can	 contain multiple	values,	while	the	output	vector	must	be	a	single	value.  Linear	 regression	 allows	 for	 simple	 linear	 relationships	 to	 be	 modeled between	the	input	and	output	vectors.	These	relationships	can	be	used	for	some to	learn	basic	problems,	so	long	as	the	relationships	are	linear.	Generalized	linear models	  GLM 	 add	 a	 link	 function	 to	 regular	 regression	 that	 greatly	 expands what	can	be	modeled,	as	the	relationship	no	longer	needs	to	be	linear.	 Pedhazur, 1982   SH   Linear	Regression  Linear	regression	attempts	to	map	the	input	vector	to	the	output	vector	with a	relatively	simple	linear	model.	If	you	just	have	two	variables,	x	and	y,	you	can write	a	linear	function	from	them.	Equation	10.1	shows	such	an	equation.  Equation	10.1:	Linear	Function  Here	m	is	the	slope	and	b	is	the	x-intercept.	This	function	is	called	linear because	on	a	graph	it	looks	like	a	straight	line.	A	curve	in	the	line	would	indicate that	the	function	is	not	linear.  The	following	equation	gives	values	to	the	unknowns	in	Equation	10.1.  The	slope	is	0.5	and	the	x-intercept	is	2.	Figure	10.1	shows	the	graph	of	this  equation.  Figure	10.1:	Graph	of	Y	=	0.5x	+	2  Equation	10.1	is	a	simple,	single	variable	linear	regression	model.	A	linear regression	 dealing	 with	 only	 a	 single	 variable	 is	 called	 univariate.	 A	 very common	example	used	to	demonstrate	univariate	regressions	is	the	relationship of	shoe	size	to	a	person’s	height.	This	regression	would	accept	a	single	input	of the	 person’s	 height	 and	 output	 their	 shoe	 size,	 or	 vice	 versa.	 Training	 such	 a  SH   model	 would	 involve	 finding	 the	 slope	 and	 y-intercept	 that	 describes	 the relationship	between	height	and	shoe	size.  The	 above	 graph	 shows	 that	 the	 function	 is	 linear.	 The	 function	 has	 a positive	slope,	which	is	evident	in	the	line’s	northeast	to	southwest	orientation. The	 slope	 is	 also	 only	 0.5,	 so	 the	 line	 is	 not	 greatly	 inclined.	 Because	 the	 y- intercept	is	2,	we	know	that	when	x	is	zero,	y	will	be	2.  Many	problems	consist	of	several	inputs,	however.	Such	models	are	called multivariate.	A	multivariate	linear	regression	looks	very	similar	to	a	univariate. The	 only	 difference	 is	 that	 you	 have	 one	 term	 for	 each	 of	 the	 inputs. Additionally,	 you	 still	 have	 the	 y-intercept.	 Equation	 10.2	 shows	 the	 general form	of	a	multivariate	linear	regression.  Equation	10.2:	Multivariate	Linear	Regression  In	the	above	equation,	the	x	variables	represent	the	input	vector.	There	will be	a	total	of	n	inputs.	You	should	notice	that	each	of	the	inputs	is	multiplied	by	a corresponding	beta	value.	Finally,	an	epsilon	value	is	added.	Epsilon	represents the	y-intercept.	Despite	all	the	additional	terms,	the	above	equation	is	still	linear. Any	such	model	would	produce	a	straight	line	graph.  We	 will	 focus	 on	 the	 multivariate	 linear	 regression.	 Univariate	 linear regression	is	really	just	a	special	case	of	multivariate	regression.	Thus,	it	is	not worth	learning	to	do	two	separate	algorithms.  The	beta	and	epsilon	values	are	coefficients.	Even	epsilon	is	a	coefficient	of one.	These	coefficients	make	up	the	long-term	memory	for	this	model.	We	could use	 any	 of	 the	 learning	 algorithms	 presented	 in	 this	 book	 to	 find	 decent coefficients	that	produce	the	desired	outputs	from	the	inputs	in	your	training	set.  Least	Squares	Fitting  Training	is	the	process	of	determining	what	coefficients	will	most	closely match	your	training	set.	Once	you	have	your	coefficients,	it	is	easy	to	calculate the	output	of	a	linear	regression.	It	is	unlikely	that	coefficients	will	be	fit	enough to	 allow	 the	 model	 to	 represent	 every	 training	 case.	 However,	 training	 will attempt	to	minimize	the	overall	error	of	your	training	set	elements.  Most	documentation	on	linear	regression	uses	the	word	“fitting”to	describe the	process	of	training.	Both	terms	really	mean	the	same	thing.	As	stated	in	the  SH   previous	section,	you	could	use	any	of	the	training	algorithms	in	this	book	to	fit proper	coefficients	to	the	model.	The	training	algorithms	presented	so	far	are	all general-purpose	algorithms.	They	do	not	specify	any	requirements	on	the	long- term	memory	 in	this	case,	coefficients 	that	they	are	trying	to	fit.	We	will	now see	a	training	algorithm	designed	specifically	for	linear	regression.  Often,	 mathematical	 solutions	 will	 produce	 a	 better	 solution	 faster	 than general	algorithms.	If	you	do	not	know	of	an	appropriate	mathematical	solution, then	by	 all	means	 use	a	 general	 algorithm.	The	 only	real	 downside	is	 that	 the training	 time	 will	 likely	 be	 longer.	 I’ve	 occasionally	 implemented	 a	 general solution	 only	 to	 have	 a	 more	 mathematically	 advanced	 friend	 say,	 “Oh interesting,	 you	 decided	 not	 to	 go	 with	 the	 [insert	 advanced	 mathematical technique	 here]	 approach.”	 Though,	 I	 am	 always	 quite	 glad	 to	 have	 such shortcuts	shown	to	me.	Math	is	an	infinite	loop	of	learning.  Now	we	will	look	at	one	such	mathematical	solution	in	order	to	use	least squares	 fitting.	 This	 training	 algorithm	 will	 not	 work	 on	 any	 of	 the	 previous models	 or	 machine	 learning	 algorithms	 presented	 in	 this	 book.	 The	 only algorithm	 in	 this	 book	 with	 which	 you	 can	 use	 least	 squares	 fitting	 is	 linear regression,	as	least	square	fitting	is	not	a	general-purpose	algorithm.  To	fit	using	least	squares,	we	must	create	two	matrixes.	These	matrixes	will be	 named	 matrixX	 and	 matrixY.	 Both	 matrixes	 will	 have	 a	 number	 of	 rows equal	to	the	number	of	training	set	elements.	The	matrix	matrixX	will	hold	all of	the	inputs	from	the	training	set.	Thus,	it	will	have	a	number	of	columns	equal to	 the	 input	 count	 plus	 1.	 Each	 input	 in	 the	 matrix	 should	 have	 a	 one concatenated	to	it.	This	allows	the	y-intercept	to	be	accounted	for.	The	matrix matrixY	 will	 hold	 all	 of	 the	 ideal	 outputs	 from	 the	 training	 set.	 For	 linear regression,	there	should	be	only	one	output,	so	the	column	count	for	matrixY will	always	be	1.  Using	these	two	matrixes,	we	can	get	a	good	fit	of	coefficients	for	the	linear regression.	We	will	use	a	linear	algebra	technique	called	matrix	decomposition, of	which	there	are	many	different	kinds.	Matrix	decomposition	is	essentially	a factorization.	 Factoring	 the	 matrix	 separates	 the	 matrix	 into	 two	 matrixes	 that, when	multiplied	together,	produce	the	original	matrix.  For	sum	of	squares,	we	will	not	use	the	two	factor	matrixes,	but	rather	use the	QR	decomposition	to	solve	this	system	of	equations.	QR	decomposition	is commonly	 used	 in	 AI.	 It	 is	 the	 main	 component	 of	 the	 least	 squares	 training algorithm.	 Barlow,	1993   SH   Least	Squares	Fitting	Example  Let’s	 create	 a	 linear	 regression	 model	 that	 will	 convert	 Fahrenheit temperatures	into	Celsius	using	least	squares	fitting.	We	will	begin	with	some training	data.  The	above	data	simply	states	that	0	degrees	Celsius	is	equal	to	32	degrees Fahrenheit.	Likewise,	100	degrees	Celsius	is	212	degrees	Fahrenheit.	We	would like	to	calculate	the	slope	and	y-intercept	for	a	linear	equation	that	will	produce the	desired	output	shown	above.  We	must	generate	the	matrixX	and	matrixY	matrixes.	First,	we	generate matrixX.	 As	 previously	 stated,	 this	 is	 essentially	 the	 input	 values	 with	 a	 1 concatenated.	The	1	represents	the	y-intercept.	matrixX	is	described	below.  Next,	we	construct	matrixY,	which	is	a	matrix	of	ideal	outputs.  0	->	32 100	->	212  [0.0,1.0] [100.0,1.0]  [32.0] [212.0]  The	next	step	is	to	solve	the	matrix,	using	QR	decomposition,	and	obtain the	 coefficients.	 I	 am	 not	 going	 to	 show	 you	 the	 internals	 of	 a	 QR decomposition,	as	this	is	a	“wheel”	I’ve	never	tried	to	reinvent.	I	always	use	a linear	 algebra	 package	 to	 perform	 this	 operation.	 There	 are	 quite	 a	 few	 linear algebra	 packages	 to	 choose	 from	 in	 most	 programming	 languages.	 Some	 are very	 efficient.	 You	 might	 choose	 to	 use	 a	 natively	 implemented	 linear	 algebra package	or	GPU	based	linear	algebra	package.	BLAS	is	a	very	common	linear algebra	 package,	 and	 there	 is	 a	 version	 of	 BLAS	 for	 CUDA	 GPUs	 called CUBLAS.	GPUs	can	often	perform	matrix	operations	considerably	faster	than CPUs.  We	 will	 solve	 matrixX	 for	 matrixY	 using	 QR.	 This	 will	 return	 the coefficients	that	must	be	applied	to	matrixX	to	produce	matrixY.	We	will	only get	 one	 set	 of	 coefficients,	 despite	 the	 fact	 that	 we	 have	 two	 rows.	 These coefficients	will	produce	the	best	results	possible	over	all	rows.	This	results	in the	following	matrix:  SH   [1.8] [32.0]  The	 matrix	 describes	 a	 coefficient	 and	 the	 y-intercept.	 The	 y-intercept	 is always	 given	 by	 the	 one	 that	 we	 concatenated	 to	 every	 input.	 As	 previously stated,	 the	 y-intercept	 has	 a	 coefficient	 of	 1.	 Therefore,	 the	 following	 linear model	can	be	used	to	convert	Celsius	to	Fahrenheit:  f	=	 c*1.8 +32  sources.  This	 matches	 the	 conversion	 formulas	 found	 in	 Wikipedia	 and	 other  There	 are	 no	 iterations	 with	 the	 least	 squares	 fit.	 It	 is	 not	 necessary	 to perform	multiple	iterations	of	least	squares	fitting,	unlike	other	iteration-based algorithms	seen	in	previous	chapters.  Anscombe's	Quartet  Linear	regression	requires	that	the	relationship	between	inputs	and	outputs be	linear,	but	it	can	be	problematic	to	force	a	line	from	data	points.	Anscombe’s Quartet	 is	 a	 special	 data	 set	 that	 points	 out	 some	 issues	 in	 linear	 regression. Figure	10.2	shows	Anscombe’s	Quartet.	 Anscombe,	1973   Figure	10.2:	Anscombe’s	Quartet  SH   SH   The	above	figure	shows	four	different	data	sets.	The	points	in	each	of	these four	 look	 clearly	 different.	 All	 four	 of	 these	 produce	 the	 exact	 same	 linear regression	coefficients.	The	line	drawn	through	the	points	represents	the	linear regression.	That	these	four	all	produce	the	same	linear	regression	indicates	some of	the	flaws	in	the	system.  The	top-left	plot	shows	a	linear	regression	line	that	does	a	pretty	good	job approximating	the	relationship	between	the	points.	However,	the	top-right	data set	is	not	at	all	linear.	The	bottom	two	show	the	effect	that	outliers	can	have	on	a model.	An	outlier	occurs	when	a	small	number	of	points	are	completely	out	of sequence	with	the	others.  Abalone	Data	Set  An	example	is	provided	for	fitting	a	linear	regression	to	the	Abalone	Data Set,	 which	 contains	 observations	 of	 abalone	 sea	 snails.	 The	 data	 set	 can	 be obtained	from	the	following	URL.  http:  archive.ics.uci.edu ml datasets Abalone  The	set	fits	a	linear	regression	to	predict	the	number	of	rings	in	the	abalone using	 a	 number	 of	 other	 observations.	 Much	 like	 a	 tree,	 the	 ring	 count	 of	 an abalone	indicates	its	age.	The	output	from	this	set	is	as	follows.

SH   Generalized	Linear	Models  Generalized	linear	models	 GLM 	are	based	on	the	linear	regression	models discussed	above.	They	make	use	of	a	link	function	to	further	abstract	the	output from	 the	 GLM.	 There	 are	 a	 variety	 of	 link	 functions	 that	 can	 be	 used	 with GLMs.	Because	GLMs	are	trained	with	a	calculus-based	training	algorithm,	the link	function	must	have	a	derivative.	The	use	of	derivatives	for	GLM	training will	be	described	in	the	next	section.  The	equation	for	a	GLM	is	very	similar	to	that	for	linear	regression.	The  primary	difference	is	that	a	GLM	adds	a	link	function.  The	equation	for	a	GLM	is	shown	in	Equation	10.3.  Equation	10.3:	Generalized	Linear	Model  You	may	have	noticed	that	Equation	10.3	is	very	similar	to	Equation	10.2. This	 is	 because	 the	 GLM	 is	 essentially	 the	 return	 value	 of	 a	 linear	 regression passed	to	the	link	function.	In	the	above	equation,	the	link	function	is	given	by g  .	The	input	vector	is	x,	while	the	output	is	y.	The	beta	values	make	up	the coefficients	and	the	epsilon	value	is	the	y-intercept,	which	is	the	same	as	with linear	regression.	The	only	addition	is	the	link	function.  There	 are	 many	 different	 link	 functions	 to	 choose	 from.	 One	 of	 the	 most common	is	the	logistic,	or	logit,	function.	A	GLM	that	uses	the	logit	function	is typically	called	a	logistic	regression	model.	The	output	of	a	logistic	regression	is always	considered	to	be	one	of	two	values.  If	you	would	like	to	model	something	with	two	categories,	then	you	should consider	using	a	logistic	regression	model.	Logistic	regression	chooses	between two	options	based	on	the	input.	This	might	be	true false,	good bad,	buy sell,	etc. If	you	need	to	choose	between	more	than	two	options,	you	could	use	the	RBF networks	presented	in	this	book.  The	logit	function	is	sometimes	called	a	sigmoid	function.	It	is	shown	in  Figure	10.3.  Figure	10.3:	The	Logistic	Function  SH   The	logistic	function	is	able	to	scale	the	output	from	the	linear	regression.	It  has	several	very	important	properties: 	  g -Infinity 	=	0 g Infinity 	=	1 g 0 	=	1 2 g -x 	=	1	–	g x  if	x	>	y	then	g x 	>	g y   The	 output	 of	 the	 logit	 will	 never	 be	 less	 than	 zero	 or	 more	 than	 one. Therefore,	0	is	typically	mapped	to	one	of	the	categories	that	the	GLM	aims	to predict,	while	1	is	mapped	to	the	other	category.	A	value	of	0	results	in	a	half, which	is	exactly	between	0	and	1.  The	sigmoid	function	is	also	monotonic.	Monotonic	refers	to	the	fact	that the	function	is	either	consistently	increasing	or	decreasing.	Monotonic	functions do	not	reverse	that	direction.  Reweight	Least	Squares	Training  GLMs	can	be	trained	using	any	of	the	general	training	algorithms	presented in	 this	 book.	 However,	 there	 is	 a	 mathematical	 shortcut	 in	 the	 form	 of	 the reweight	least	squares	training	algorithm.	This	training	algorithm	is	based	on	the least	squares	training,	but	reweight	least	squares	training	can	handle	the	addition of	the	link	function.	Unlike	least	squares,	the	reweight	least	squares	algorithm	is  SH   iterative.	 You	 will	 need	 to	 process	 iterations	 until	 the	 error	 is	 acceptable.  Chartrand,	2008   The	 reweight	 least	 squares	 algorithm	 falls	 into	 a	 category	 of	 training algorithms	called	gradient	descent.	The	back	propagation-training	algorithm	also falls	 under	 the	 category	 of	 gradient	 descent;	 you	 might	 be	 familiar	 with	 back propagation	training	if	you’ve	ever	worked	with	neural	networks.  Gradient	 descent	 makes	 use	 of	 calculus	 to	 determine	 the	 gradient	 of	 the error	 function	 at	 the	 current	 state	 of	 the	 long-term	 memory	  the	 coefficients . This	 gradient	 will	 indicate	 whether	 we	 need	 to	 increase	 or	 decrease	 each coefficient	to	lower	the	error.	To	do	this,	we	need	to	determine	the	derivative	of the	link	function,	which	means	that	link	functions	must	be	differentiable	 have	a derivative 	in	order	to	perform	gradient	descent.  The	derivative	of	a	function	is	just	another	function.	The	derivative	function tells	 us	 the	 instantaneous	 rate	 of	 change	 for	 the	 first	 function.	 Consider	 a function	that	describes	the	position	of	a	car	at	any	given	time.	If	you	pass	the value	 10	 seconds	 into	 the	 function,	 it	 tells	 you	 the	 position	 of	 the	 car	 at	 10 seconds.	Likewise,	if	you	pass	in	60	seconds,	you	will	be	given	the	position	of the	car	at	that	time.	If	you	were	to	take	the	derivative	of	the	function	describing position	at	time,	you	would	have	a	new	function	that	describes	the	speed	of	the car	at	any	time.  When	 plotted	 on	 a	 graph,	 the	 derivative	 usually	 looks	 like	 a	 line	 that touches	 the	 main	 function	 at	 only	 one	 point.	 Consider	 whether	 Figure	 10.4 represents	the	error	as	you	varied	only	one	coefficient.  Figure	10.4:	Error	Derivative	from	Varying	Single	Coefficient  SH   The	curvy	line	shows	the	error	function	e  	as	you	vary	the	coefficient	w. The	straight	line	is	the	derivative	of	the	error	function	at	a	given	w.	Notice	how the	slope	of	the	derivative	tells	us	the	direction	in	which	the	underlying	function is	 heading.	 The	 goal	 is	 to	 descend	 to	 the	 lowest	 point,	 which	 is	 somewhere between	 2.0	 and	 2.5.	 The	 point	 at	 which	 it	 touches	 is	 currently	 at	 1.5	  the location	of	the	derivative .	Therefore,	by	the	slope	 or	gradient 	of	the	derivative, we	 must	 increase	 w.	 This	 is	 called	 gradient	 descent,	 because	 we	 use	 the gradients	to	descend.  During	training,	the	program	cannot	visualize	this	graph.	All	that	we	can see	is	one	narrow	vertical	slice,	in	which	exist	the	error	at	our	current	coefficient value	and	the	derivative.	We	move	the	coefficient	in	the	direction	indicated	by the	derivative	and	see	how	much	the	error	improves	in	the	next	iteration.	In	the next	iteration,	we	calculate	a	new	gradient	and	continue	to	adjust	the	coefficient. This	 same	 process	 continues	 until	 we	 can	 no	 longer	 improve	 the	 error	 by	 a considerable	amount.  SH   Chapter	Summary  This	 chapter	 introduced	 two	 forms	 of	 linear	 regression:	 regular	 linear regression.	 Regular	 linear	 regression	 requires	 that	 a	 mostly	 linear	 relationship exist	 between	 the	 input	 vector	 and	 output	 values.	 Linear	 regression	 outputs	 a single	resulting	value.  A	 linear	 regression	 algorithm’s	 long-term	 memory	 is	 the	 coefficients	 that are	 used	 by	 its	 equation.	 These	 coefficients	 can	 be	 adjusted	 using	 the	 general training	 algorithms	 used	 earlier	 in	 this	 book.	 However,	 there	 a	 mathematical shortcut	that	can	be	employed	to	quickly	determine	values	for	the	coefficients that	 minimize	 the	 error	 between	 the	 output	 from	 the	 model	 and	 the	 expected outputs	contained	in	the	training	set.  You	 will	 see	 several	 such	 shortcuts	 through	 this	 series.	 There	 are	 general algorithms	that	can	be	used	to	solve	nearly	any	type	of	problem,	and	there	are specialized	 algorithms	 that	 only	 work	 with	 specific	 models.	 The	 special algorithms	 often	 use	 mathematical	 techniques	 to	 perform	 very	 efficient optimization	of	the	underlying	models.	Least	squares	training	and	reweight	least squares	training	are	two	such	examples.  This	 book	 introduced	 you	 to	 many	 fundamental	 algorithms	 for	 AI. Subsequent	volumes	in	this	series	will	build	more	complex	algorithms	that	make use	of	the	fundamental	algorithms	in	this	book.	While	these	algorithms	are	often used	as	building	blocks,	they	are	also	very	useful	in	their	own	right.  The	next	book	in	this	series	will	cover	nature	inspired	algorithms.	The	only model	that	we	have	for	true	intelligence	is	the	human	brain	and	nature.	Because of	 this,	 it	 is	 natural	 that	 we	 take	 inspiration	 from	 nature	 to	 design	 algorithms. Genetic	 algorithms,	 genetic	 programming,	 ant	 colony	 optimization,	 particle swarm	 optimization,	 and	 other	 such	 algorithms	 will	 be	 explored	 in	 the	 next book.	The	next	book	uses	many	of	the	algorithms	introduced	in	this	book.

This	download	is	a	zip	file.  Once	 you	 open	 the	 examples	 file	 you	 will	 see	 the	 contents	 see	 in	 Figure  A.2.  Figure	A.2:	Examples	Download  The	license	file	describes	the	license	used	for	the	book	examples.	All	of	the examples	 for	 this	 series	 are	 released	 under	 the	 Apache	 v2.0	 license.	 This	 is	 a Free	 and	 open-source	 software	  FOSS 	 license.	 This	 means	 that	 I	 do	 retain	 a copyright	 to	 the	 files.	 However,	 you	 can	 freely	 reuse	 these	 files	 in	 both commercial	and	non-commercial	projects	without	further	permission.  While	the	book	source	code	is	provided	free,	the	book	text	is	not	provided free.	These	books	are	commercial	products	that	I	sell	through	a	variety	of	means. You	may	not	redistribute	the	actual	books.	This	includes	the	PDF,	MOBI,	EPUB and	any	other	format	the	book	might	be	converted	to.	I	do,	however,	provide	all books	in	DRM-free	form.	Your	support	of	this	policy	is	greatly	appreciated	and does	contribute	to	the	future	growth	of	these	books.  There	 are	 also	 two	 README	 files	 included	 in	 the	 download.	 The README.md	 is	 a	 “markdown”	 file	 that	 contains	 images	 and	 formatting.	 The README.txt	 file	 is	 plane	 text.	 Both	 files	 contain	 the	 same	 information.	 For more	information	on	MD	files,	refer	to	the	following	URL. https:  help.github.com articles github-flavored-markdown  You	will	find	README	files	at	several	levels	of	the	examples	download. The	 README	 file	 contained	 in	 the	 examples	 root	  seen	 above 	 contains  SH   information	about	the	book	series.  You	 will	 also	 notice	 the	 individual	 volume	 folders	 contained	 in	 the download.	These	are	named	vol1,	vol2,	etc.	You	may	not	see	all	of	the	volumes in	 the	 download.	 Not	 all	 of	 the	 volumes	 have	 been	 written	 yet!	 All	 of	 the volumes	have	the	same	format.	For	example,	if	you	were	to	open	Volume	1,	you would	see	the	contents	listed	in	Figure	A.3.  Figure	A.3:	Inside	Volume	1  Again,	 you	 see	 the	 two	 README	 files.	 These	 files	 contain	 information unique	to	this	particular	volume.	The	most	important	information	contained	in the	 volume	 level	 README	 files	 is	 the	 current	 status	 of	 the	 examples.	 The community	 often	 contributes	 example	 packs.	 This	 means	 that	 some	 of	 the example	packs	may	not	be	complete.	The	README	for	the	volume	will	let	you know	this	important	information.	The	volume	README.also	contains	the	errata and	FAQ	for	a	volume.  You	 should	 also	 see	 a	 file	 named	 “chart.R”.	 This	 file	 contains	 the	 source code	 that	 I	 used	 to	 create	 many	 of	 the	 charts	 in	 the	 book.	 I	 use	 the	 R programming	language	to	produce	nearly	all	graphs	and	charts	seen	in	the	book. This	allows	you	to	see	the	equations	behind	the	pictures.	I	do	not	translate	this file	to	other	programming	languages.	R	is	simply	what	I	use	in	the	production	of the	book.	If	I	used	another	language,	like	Python,	to	produce	some	of	the	charts, you	would	see	a	“chart.py”	along	with	the	R	code.  You	 can	 see	 that	 the	 above	 volume	 contains	 examples	 for	 C,	 C,	 Java, Python	and	R.	These	are	the	core	languages	that	I	try	to	always	ensure	complete  SH   examples	 for.	 However,	 you	 may	 see	 other	 languages	 added.	 Again,	 always check	the	README	file	for	the	latest	information	on	language	translations.  Figure	A.4	shows	the	contents	of	a	typical	language	pack.  Figure	A.4:	The	Java	Language	Pack  Notice	the	README	files	again?	The	README	files	inside	of	a	language folder	are	VERY	important.	Inside	the	above	two	README	files	you	will	find information	about	using	the	examples	with	Java.	If	you	are	having	trouble	using the	 book’s	 examples	 with	 a	 particular	 language,	 the	 README	 file	 should	 be your	first	stop.	The	other	files	seen	above	are	all	unique	to	Java.	The	README file	above	describes	these	in	much	greater	detail.  SH   Contributing	to	the	Project  Do	you	want	to	translate	the	examples	to	a	new	language?	Have	you	found something	broken,	misspelled,	or	otherwise	botched?	You	probably	have.	Fork the	project	and	push	a	commit	revision	to	GitHub.	You	will	be	credited	among the	growing	number	of	contributors.  The	process	begins	with	a	fork.	You	create	an	account	on	GitHub	and	fork the	AIFH	project.	This	creates	a	new	project,	with	a	copy	of	the	AIFH	files.	You will	then	clone	your	new	for,	in	a	similar	way	as	was	described	for	cloning	the main	 AIFH	 repositiory.	 Once	 you	 make	 your	 changes	 you	 submit	 a	 “pull request”.	 Once	 I	 get	 this	 request	 I	 will	 evaluate	 your	 changes additions	 and merge	it	with	the	main	project.

A great building requires a strong foundation. This book teaches basic Artificial Intelligence algorithms such as dimensionality, distance metrics, clustering, error calculation, hill climbing, Nelder Mead, and linear regression. These are not just foundational algorithms for the rest of the series, but are very useful in their own right. The book explains all algorithms using actual numeric calculations that you can perform yourself. Artificial Intelligence for Humans is a book series meant to teach AI to those without an extensive mathematical background. The reader needs only a knowledge of basic college algebra or computer programming—anything more complicated than that is thoroughly explained. Every chapter also includes a programming example. Examples are currently provided in Java, C#, R, Python and C. Other languages planned.
