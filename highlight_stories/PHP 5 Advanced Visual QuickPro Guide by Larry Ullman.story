562 Index 569  s t n e t n o C   f o e l b a T     viii   Introduction i  If you’re looking at this book, then I probably don’t need to tell you how great PHP is. Presumably, since you’re perusing the pages of an advanced text on the topic, you are already using PHP for developing dynamic Web sites. Maybe you’ve been doing so for a couple of years, perhaps just a couple of months. You could have learned PHP on your own, in a class, or by reading one of the many excellent books on the subject.  I’m referring not just to my own, of course!  Whatever the case, with some experience under your belt, you probably don’t want another “here’s how to use PHP and isn’t it swell” book. What you probably want to learn is how to use PHP more efficiently, more securely, faster, and all-around better than you already are. If so, you’ve found the right book.  In this humble author’s  or not-so-humble author’s  opinion, advanced PHP is about learning: how to do different things, how to improve upon the basic things, and about technologies that intersect with PHP. In short, you know how to make a dynamic Web site with PHP, but you’d like to know how to make a better Web site, with every possible meaning of “better.” That’s the approach I’ve taken in writing this book. I’ve not set out to blow your mind discussing esoteric idiosyncrasies the language has, rewriting the PHP, MySQL, or Apache source code, or making theoretically interesting but practically useless code. In short, I present to you several hundred pages of beyond-the- norm but still absolutely necessary  and often cool  tips and techniques.  I n t r o d u c t i o n  ix   n o i t c u d o r t n I  Introduction  About This Book Simply put, I’ve tried to make this book’s content accessible and useful for every  PHP programmer out there. As I suggest  in the introductory paragraphs, I believe that “advanced” PHP is mostly a matter  of extended topics. You already possess  all the basic knowledge—you retrieve data- base query results in your sleep—but want to go further. This may mean learning object- oriented programming  OOP , using PEAR  PHP Extension and Application Repository , incorporating Ajax  Asynchronous JavaScript and XML  into a site, or improving upon aspects of your existing skill set.  My definition of advanced PHP program- ming covers three loosely grouped skills:  ◆ Doing what you already do better, faster,  and more securely  ◆ Learning more sophisticated PHP tech-  niques  ◆ Doing standard things using PHP and other technologies  like PEAR, Ajax,  or OOP   This book can be divided into three sections, corresponding to those skills. The first five chapters cover advanced PHP knowledge  in general: programming techniques, Web applications, databases, security, and e-com- merce. They all cover information that the average PHP programmer may not be famil- iar with but should be able to comprehend, providing useful code in the process.  The next six chapters focus on extending your knowledge to areas of PHP with which you might not be as familiar. Half of this sec- tion goes over object-oriented programming in great detail, from the fundamentals to advanced topics to some real-world examples. The other three chapters are on different ways you might use PHP: to communicate with  x   Introduction  networked servers, to communicate with  the host server, or from a command-line interface. The remaining three chapters each deal with a specific technology tied into PHP: PEAR, Ajax, and XML.   Two bonus chapters, “Image Generation” and “Creating PDFs”, can be downloaded from Peachpit’s Web site. Those two chapters, which are available for free, provide another 100 pages of content showing how PHP ties into related, and very useful, technologies.

Most examples used in this book are intended to be applicable in the real world, omitting the frivolous code you might see in other books, tutorials, and manuals. I focus as much on the philosophies involved as on the coding itself so that, in the end, you will come away with not just how to do this or that but also how to apply the overarching mentality to your own, individual projects.  Unlike with most of my other books, I do not expect that you’ll necessarily read this book in sequential order, for the most part. Some chapters do assume that you’ve read others, like the object-oriented ones, which have a progression to them. Some later chapters also reference examples completed in earlier ones. If you read the later ones first, you’ll just need to quickly hop over to the earlier ones to generate whatever data- base or scripts the later chapter requires.  Finally, I’ll be using XHTML in my scripts instead of HTML. I’ll also use some CSS, as warranted. I do not discuss either of these subjects in this book  and, to be frank, may not adhere to them perfectly . If you are not already familiar with the subjects, you should look at some online resources or good books  such as Elizabeth Castro’s excellent Visual QuickStart Guides  for more information.  xi  I n t r o d u c t i o n   n o i t c u d o r t n I  Introduction  What’s new in this edition The most important change in this edition of the book is that every bit of code has been updated, rewritten, or replaced to ensure 100 percent compatibility with PHP 5. Many of the examples have also been modified  to take advantage of features added to the language.   What is also new is my approach. The first edition of this text was the second book I ever wrote. I’ve learned a lot since then, both in terms of PHP and in terms of what read- ers expect in a book. A lot of my valuable experience in this latter category comes from the constant interactions with other readers through email and my supporting forums  www.DMCInsights.com phorum  . A fair amount of material is therefore based upon frequently asked questions I see. How this book compares to my others Those readers who have come to this book from my PHP for the World Wide Web: Visual QuickStart Guide may find themselves in a bit over their heads. This book does assume comfort with standard PHP programming, in particular debugging your own scripts. I’m not suggesting you put this book down, but if you find it goes too fast for you, or assumes knowledge you don’t currently pos- sess, you may want to check out my PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide instead.  If you have read the PHP and MySQL book, or the first edition of this one, I’m hoping that you’ll find this to be a wonderful addi- tion to your library and skill set.  xii   Introduction  About PHP 5 Although version 5 of PHP has been out since July 2004  when the first non-beta version was released , there are still a large number of servers running older versions  of PHP, particularly outside of the United States. This book does assume you’re using PHP 5, although some examples will work with older versions of the language.  The most important change in PHP 5,  with respect to this book, is the completely different object model and syntax. Object- oriented programming in PHP 4 is a rather watered-down concept, really not worth using in comparison to PHP 5’s OOP. The object-oriented chapters use PHP 5 syntax exclusively, and that code will not work on older versions of the language.  In addition, PHP 5 added support for the Improved MySQL extension, designed for use with MySQL 4.1 or later. With only one or two exceptions, I use these Improved MySQL functions instead of the older, “regu- lar” MySQL functions. If your PHP installa- tion  or MySQL installation  does not sup- port these functions, you’ll need to change the code accordingly.  I n t r o d u c t i o n  xiii   n o i t c u d o r t n I  Introduction  What You’ll Need Just as this book assumes that you already possess the fundamental skills to program in PHP  and, more important, to debug it when things go awry , it also assumes that you already have everything you need to follow along with the material. For starters, this means a PHP-enabled server. At the time of this writing, the latest version of PHP was 5.2, and much of the book depends upon your using at least PHP 5.0.  Along with PHP, you’ll often need a database application. I use MySQL for the examples, but you can use anything. And, for the scripts in some of the chapters to work—particularly the last five—your PHP installation will have to include support for the corresponding technology, and that technology’s library may need to be installed, too. Fortunately PHP 5 comes with built-in support for many advanced features. If the scripts in a par- ticular chapter require special extensions, that will be referenced in the chapter’s intro- duction. This includes the few times where I make use of a PEAR or PECL class. Nowhere in this book will I discuss installation, though, as I expect you should already know or have accomplished that.  As with any issue, should you have questions or problems, you can always search the Web or post a message in my support forums for assistance.  Beyond PHP, you need the things you should already have: a text editor or IDE, an FTP application  if using a remote server , and a Web browser. All of the code in this book has been tested on both Windows XP and Mac OS X; you’ll see screen shots in both operating systems.  xiv   Introduction  Support Web Site I have developed a Web site to support this book, available at www.DMCinsights.com  phpvqp2 . This site:  ◆ Has every script available for download  ◆ Has the SQL commands available for  download  for download  the book  ◆ Has extra files, as necessary, available   ◆ Lists errors that have been found in   ◆ Has a support forum where you can get  help or assist others  ◆ Provides a way to contact me directly  When using this site, please make sure you’ve gone to the correct URL  the book’s title and edition are plastered everywhere . Each book I’ve written has its own support area; if you go to the wrong one, the down- loadable files won’t match those in the book.  Two bonus chapters, “Image Generation” and “Creating PDFs,” can be downloaded  for free. Visit www.peachpit.com title  0321376013 to learn how to register this book and access the chapters.  I n t r o d u c t i o n  xv   This page intentionally left blank    1  Advanced  PHP Techniques  At the most basic level good programming is determined by whether or not an appli- cation or script works as intended. This is where the beginning programmer will leave things, and there is nothing wrong with that. However, the advanced programmer will work past that point, striving toward improved efficiency, reliability, security, and portability. This book teaches you how to develop the skills of an advanced PHP programmer.  One thing the advanced PHP programmer does better than the beginner is learning to take advantage of more obscure or harder-to-comprehend features of the language. For example, while you probably already know how to use arrays, you may not have mas- tered multidimensional arrays: creating them, sorting them, and so on. You have writ- ten your own functions by this point but may not understand how to use recursion and static variables. Issues like these will be discussed as well as other beyond-the-basics concepts, like the heredoc syntax and the printf   sprintf   family of functions.     A d v a n c e d P H P t e c h n i q u e s  1   Chapter 1  Multidimensional Arrays Because of their power and flexibility, arrays are widely used in all PHP programming. For advanced uses, the multidimensional array often solves problems where other variable types just won’t do.  For the first of the two examples, I’ll demon- strate how to sort a multidimensional array. It’s a common question users have and isn’t as hard as one might think. For the second example, I’ll create a database-driven to-do list, which can have limitless dimensions  Figure 1.1 . Sorting multidimensional arrays Sorting arrays is easy using PHP, thanks to the sort  , ksort  , and related functions. You can sort a one-dimensional array by key, by value, in reverse order, etc. But these func- tions will not work on multidimensional arrays  not as you’d probably like, at least .  Say you have an array defined like so: $a = array   array  ‘key1’ => 940, ‘key2’ => ‘blah’ , array  ‘key1’ => 23, ‘key2’ => ‘this’ , array  ‘key1’ => 894, ‘key2’ => ‘that’   ;  This is a simple two-dimensional array  an array whose elements are also arrays  that you might need to sort using key1  a numeric sort  or key2  an alphabetical sort . To sort a multidimensional array, you define your own sort function and then tell PHP to use that function via the usort  , uasort  , or uksort   function. The function you define must take exactly two arguments and return a value indicating which should come first.   s y a r r A   l a n o i s n e m i d i t l u M  2  Figure 1.1 One use of multidimensional arrays will be to create a nested to-do list.  Figure 1.2 The multidimensional array sorted by numeric value  key1 .   Advanced PHP Techniques  To sort the preceding array on the first key, the sorting function would like this: function mysort1  $x, $y  {  return  $x[‘key1’] > $y[‘key1’] ;  }  Then the PHP code would use this function by doing: usort  $a, ‘mysort1’ ;  Figure 1.2 shows the same array at this point.  PHP will continue sending the inner arrays to this function so that they may be sorted. If you want to see this in detail, print the values being compared in the function  Figure 1.3 .  The usort   function sorts by values and does not maintain the keys  for the outermost array . If you used uasort  , the keys would be maintained, and if you used uksort  , the sort would be based upon the keys.  To sort on the second key in the preceding example, you would want to compare two strings. That code would be  Figure 1.4 shows the result : function mysort2  $x, $y  {  return strcasecmp $x[‘key2’],  ➝ $y[‘key2’] ; } usort  $a, ‘mysort2’ ;  Or you could just use strcmp  , to perform a case-sensitive sort.  To see this in action for yourself, let’s run through an example.  M u l t i d i m e n s i o n a l   A r r a y s  3  Figure 1.3 By printing out the values of $x[‘key1’] and $y[‘key1’], one can see how the user-defined sorting function is invoked.  Figure 1.4 An alphabetical sort on the example array using key2.   Chapter 1  To sort a multidimensional array: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi- tor or IDE, starting with the HTML code  Script 1.1 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C   ➝ DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset= ➝ iso-8859-1”  >   Sorting Multidimensional  ➝ Arrays      <?php  Script 1.1 - sort.php 2. Define a multidimensional array.  $students = array   256 => array  ‘name’ => ‘Jon’, ➝ ‘grade’ => 98.5 , 2 => array  ‘name’ => ‘Vance’, ➝ ‘grade’ => 85.1 , 9 => array  ‘name’ => ‘Stephen’, ➝ ‘grade’ => 94.0 , 364 => array  ‘name’ => ‘Steve’, ➝ ‘grade’ => 85.1 , 68 => array  ‘name’ => ‘Rob’,  ➝ ‘grade’ => 74.6   ; The outer array, $students, has five ele- ments, each of which is also an array.

Define the name sorting function. function name_sort  $x, $y  {  return strcasecmp $x[‘name’],  ➝ $y[‘name’] ; } The strcasecmp   function returns a number—negative, 0, or positive—indi- cating how similar two strings are. If a negative value is returned, the first string comes before the second alphabetically; if a positive value is returned, the second string comes first. If 0 is returned, the strings are the same.  4. Define the grade sorting function. function grade_sort  $x, $y  {  return  $x[‘grade’] <  ➝ $y[‘grade’] ; } This example is like the demo in the introduction to these steps. One signifi- cant difference is that I want to perform a descending sort, so that the highest grades are listed first. This is easily accomplished: change the comparison operator from greater than to less than.  5. Print the array as it’s initially defined. echo ‘ Array As Is  ’ . ➝ print_r $students, 1  . ‘ ’; For improved legibility, I’ll use the   tags and print_r   to quickly reveal the arrays’ structure and values.  6. Sort the array by name and print the  results. uasort  $students, ‘name_sort’ ; echo ‘ Array Sorted By ➝ Name  ’ . ➝ print_r $students, 1  . ‘ ’; Here the uasort   function is used so that the keys—the student IDs—are not lost. Figure 1.5 shows the result if just usort   was used instead.  6  s y a r r A   l a n o i s n e m i d i t l u M  Figure 1.5 Failure to use uasort   would cause the keys, which store meaningful values  see Script 1.1 , to be lost.

Chapter 1  Database-driven arrays If you think about it, most database queries return a multidimensional array  Figure 1.8 . If the query results are immediately sent to the Web browser one at a time, the multidi- mensional structure doesn’t add any compli- cation to your code. However, if you need to do something more elaborate with the results, you’ll need a way to comprehend and man- age the nested structure.  For this example, I want to create a database- driven, Web-based to-do list system. If the to-do list were one-dimensional, this wouldn’t be that hard. But the list should be nestable, where each item can have multiple steps. The result will be a tree-like structure, where each branch can have its own offshoots  Figure 1.9 .  s y a r r A   l a n o i s n e m i d i t l u M  Figure 1.9 How a nested to-do list looks as a tree.  8   Advanced PHP Techniques  The database required by this is surprisingly simple  Table 1.1 . The trick is that each item has a parent_id attribute. If an item is a sub- step, its parent_id would be the task number of the item that it falls under  Figure 1.10 . If an item is not a substep, its parent_id would be 0. It’s a very simple setup, but han- dling this in PHP will take some effort.  Over the next few pages, you’ll create the database table and a PHP script for adding new tasks. In the next sections of the chap- ter, you’ll see how to use recursive functions to handle the multidimensional array.  Figure 1.10 This table represents the same data as in Figures 1.8 and 1.9. There will be a pseudo–foreign key–primary key relationship between the task_id and parent_id columns.  M u l t i d i m e n s i o n a l   A r r a y s  9  Table 1.1 This one database table is all that is required to manage a nested to-do list.  The tasks Table  C o l u m n   N a m e  Ty p e  task_id parent_id task date_added date_completed  INT UNSIGNED INT UNSIGNED VARCHAR 100  TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP  E xt r a AUTO_INCREMENT, Primary Key NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL NOT NULL   Figure 1.11 The table will be created within the test database.  Figure 1.12 Creating the tasks table.  Chapter 1  To create the database: 1. Access MySQL using the mysql client or  other interface. I’ll be using MySQL in this example, but you can use any database application, of course. To create the table, I’ll use the command-line mysql client, but you could use phpMyAdmin or one of MySQL’s graphical interfaces instead.  2. Select the test database  Figure 1.11 .  USE test; I’ll just throw this one table within the test database, as it’s not part of any larger application. You can put it in a  different database, if you prefer. 3. Create the table  Figure 1.12 .  CREATE TABLE tasks   task_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ AUTO_INCREMENT, parent_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ DEFAULT 0, task VARCHAR 100  NOT NULL, date_added TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, date_completed TIMESTAMP, PRIMARY KEY  task_id , INDEX parent  parent_id , INDEX added  date_added , INDEX completed  date_completed   ; The task_id is an automatically incre- mented primary key. The value will also be used as the parent_id if a task is a sub- step. The task itself goes into a VAR- CHAR 100  column, which you could also define as a text type if you wanted to allow for longer descriptions. Two time- stamp columns round out the table, one documenting when the task was added and another to indicate its completion. Three standard indexes are placed on columns that might be used in queries.  10  s y a r r A   l a n o i s n e m i d i t l u M   Figure 1.13 The tasks will normally be added using a PHP script, but a test insertion is run just to make sure everything is on the up and up.  Advanced PHP Techniques  4. Test the table by adding a dummy task   Figure 1.13 : INSERT INTO tasks  task  VALUES ➝  ‘Must Do This!’ ; SELECT * FROM tasks; For a simple task that’s not a subset of another task, only the one column needs to be provided with a value. The SELECT query confirms that the parent_id, date_added, and date_completed columns are automatically given default values  0000-00-00 00:00:00 is the TIMESTAMP equivalent of 0 . 5. Empty the table.

Connect to the database.  $dbc = @mysqli_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’, ‘test’  OR ➝ die  ‘ Could not connect to the ➝ database!   ’ ; I’ll be using MySQL and the Improved MySQL functions in this script. These are available as of PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1. If you are using older versions of either, you’ll need to change the code accordingly. If a database connection couldn’t be made, an error is printed and the script terminated  Figure 1.14 .  3. Check if the form has been submitted. if  isset $_POST[‘submitted’]  && ➝ !empty $_POST[‘task’]   { The form  Figure 1.15  has one main text box and a drop-down menu. To test for the form’s submission, the conditional checks that a hidden input named sub- mitted is set and that the text box  named task  isn’t empty.  4. Ensure that the parent_id value is an  integer. if  isset $_POST[‘parent_id’]   {  $parent_id =  int  ➝ $_POST[‘parent_id’]; } else {  $parent_id = 0;  } The parent_id value is another task’s task_id. It will come from the drop-down menu, which means that it should be an integer. But one shouldn’t make assump- tions  because if someone hacked the form to send text as the parent_id, it would break the query , so this variable is typecast to an integer. If a valid value is submitted, this casting will have no effect. Any invalid values will be turned into 0. The same applies if the script does not receive a $_POST[‘parent_id’] value.  14  s y a r r A   l a n o i s n e m i d i t l u M   5. Secure the task value.  $task = ➝ mysqli_real_escape_string $dbc, ➝ $_POST[‘task’] ; The mysqli_real_escape_string   func- tion will make whatever submitted task value safe to use in the query. 6. Add the task to the database.  $q = “INSERT INTO tasks  parent_id, ➝ task  VALUES  $parent_id, ➝ ‘$task’ ”; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; This query differs from the test query run earlier in that it also populates the parent_id field in the table. 7. Report on the query results.  if  mysqli_affected_rows $dbc  == 1  {  echo ‘ The task has been  ➝ added! ’;  } else { echo ‘ The task could not be  ➝ added! ’; }  Advanced PHP Techniques  8. Complete the submission conditional  and start the form. }    End of submission IF. echo ‘<form action=”add_task.php” ➝ method=”post”>    Add a Task   Task: <input name=”task” type= ➝ ”text” size=”60” maxlength=”100” ➝  >   Parent Task: <select name= ➝ ”parent_id”><option value= ➝ ”0”>None  ‘; The form has one text input and one drop-down menu. The menu will be pop- ulated from the list of existing tasks. The first possible value will be 0, for tasks that are not subservient to other tasks. 9. Retrieve all the uncompleted tasks.  $q = ‘SELECT task_id, parent_id, task ➝ FROM tasks WHERE its date_ ➝ completed=”0000-00-00 00:00:00” ➝ ORDER BY date_added ASC’; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; The query returns three pieces of infor- mation for every uncompleted task  once a task has been completed, its date_completed column would have a nonzero value . The task_id and the task itself will be used in the drop-down menu. The parent_id will be used later  to nest the tasks.  continues on next page  M u l t i d i m e n s i o n a l   A r r a y s  15   Chapter 1  10. Create an array for storing the tasks.  $tasks = array  ; This script will list all the tasks twice: once in the drop-down menu and once after the form  Figure 1.16 . This array will store the second list.  11. Retrieve a database record and use it  accordingly. while  list $task_id, $parent_id, ➝ $task  = mysqli_fetch_ ➝ array $r, MYSQLI_NUM   { echo “<option value=\  ➝ ”$task_id\”>$task \n”;  $tasks[] = array ‘task_id’ =>  ➝ $task_id, ‘parent_id’ =>  ➝ $parent_id, ‘task’ => $task ; } Within the while loop the retrieved record is used to populate the drop- down menu  Figure 1.17  and is also stored in the $tasks array. This array will be multidimensional.  12. Complete the form.  echo ‘   <input name=”submitted” type= ➝ ”hidden” value=”true”  > <input name=”submit” type=”submit” ➝ value=”Add This Task”  >     ‘; The hidden input here is a trick I use  to check for a form’s submission. Doing this is sometimes necessary as just pressing Enter within Internet Explorer for Windows will submit a form without ever setting the $_POST[‘submit’] variable.  16  s y a r r A   l a n o i s n e m i d i t l u M  Figure 1.16 The page contains the list of tasks two times.  Figure 1.17 The PHP-generated HTML source code for the drop-down menu.   Advanced PHP Techniques  13. Sort the tasks by parent_id.  function parent_sort  $x, $y  {  return  $x[‘parent_id’] >  ➝ $y[‘parent_id’] ; } usort  $tasks, ‘parent_sort’ ; The parent_id value is what separates  primary tasks from secondary ones,  so working with this value in PHP is important. Using the information dis- cussed earlier in the chapter, a user- defined function will sort the multidimen- sional array.  14. Display the full list of tasks.  echo ‘ Current To-Do ➝ List  ’; foreach  $tasks as $task  {  echo “ {$task[‘task’]}  ➝  \n”; } echo ‘ ’; This loop will display each task in order of its parent_id. This is the first step toward making the list shown in Figure 1.1, although as you can see in Figure 1.16, the list isn’t organized as it should be. This will be solved later in the chapter.  15. Complete the page.  ?>      16. Save the file as add_task.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figures 1.18 and 1.19 .  ✔ Tip    If you wanted to implement this idea in a  live site, one improvement you could make would be the ability to add multi- ple tasks at once. I’ll provide further tips on fleshing out this example over the course of the chapter.  17  M u l t i d i m e n s i o n a l   A r r a y s  Figure 1.18 Adding a new task that’s not linked to another task.  Figure 1.19 Adding a task that’s a subset of an existing task.   The lack of a condition that determines when to stop execution of the function cre- ates a big programming no-no, the infinite loop. Compare that function to this one: function count_to_100  $n  {  if  $n <= 100  {  echo $n . ' '; $n++; count_to_100  $n ;  }  } count_to_100  1 ;  This function will continue to call itself until $n is greater than 100, at which point it will stop executing the function.  That’s obvi- ously a trivial use of this concept; a loop would do the same thing.   Recursive functions are necessary when you have a process that may be followed to an unknown depth. For example, a script that searches through a directory may have to search through any number of subdirecto- ries. Or an array might have an unknown number of dimensions....  With the tasks table created earlier in the chapter, retrieving and displaying all the tasks is not hard  see Figures 1.17 and 1.18 . However, the method used in add_task.php  Script 1.2  does not properly nest the tasks like that in Figure 1.1. To accomplish that desired end, a multidimensional array and a recursive function are required.  Chapter 1  Advanced Function Definitions Being able to define and use your own func- tions is integral to any programming lan- guage. After even a modicum of PHP experi- ence, you’ve no doubt created many. But there are three potential features of user- defined functions that arise in more advanced programming. These are:  ◆ Recursive functions  ◆ Static variables  ◆ Accepting values by reference  While not often used, sometimes these con- cepts are indispensable. In discussing and demonstrating these first two concepts, I’ll continue to build upon the tasks example just begun in the chapter. Recursive functions Recursion is the act of a function calling itself. function somefunction   {     Some code. somefunction  ;    Possible other code.  }  The end result is that your functions can act both as originally intended and as a loop. The one huge warning when using this tech- nique is to make sure your function has an “out” clause. For example, the following code will run ad infinitum: function add_one  $n  {  $n++; add_one  $n ;  } add_one  1 ;  18     s n o i t i n i f e D n o i t c n u F d e c n a v d A      To use recursion: 1.

Begin defining a function.  function make_list  $parent  {  global $tasks; echo ‘ ’;  The purpose of the function will be  to display an array of items in an  ordered list:    Item 1   Item 2   Item 3    This function will take one argument, which will always be an array. Within the function, the $tasks array  the main array  needs to be available—you’ll soon see why. Then the ordered list is begun.  3. Loop through the array, printing   each item. foreach  $parent as $task_id  ➝ => $todo  {  echo “ $todo”;  A foreach loop will go through the array, printing each item within   tags. Those are begun here.  continues on next page     A d v a n c e d F u n c t i o n D e f i n i t i o n s     21   Figure 1.20 The PHP script takes the tasks from the database and creates this multidimensional array.  Chapter 1  4. Check if any subtasks exist.  if  isset $tasks[$task_id]   {  make_list $tasks[$task_id] ;  } This is the most important part of the script. The tasks retrieved from the data- base will be tossed into a multidimen- sional array like that in Figure 1.20. For the main array, each key is a parent_id and the elements are arrays of tasks that fall under that parent_id. So after print- ing the initial   task, the function needs to check if this task has any sub- tasks; in other words: is there an array element in $tasks whose key is this task ID? If so, then this function should be called again, sending that other part of the array  the element whose key is this task_id and whose value is an array of subtasks  as the argument. That will result in the code:    Item 1   Item 2    Subitem 1   Subitem 2        Item 3     5. Complete the foreach loop and the   function.  echo ‘ ’;  }    End of FOREACH loop. echo ‘ ’;  }    End of make_list   function.  22     s n o i t i n i f e D n o i t c n u F d e c n a v d A      6. Connect to the database.  $dbc = @mysqli_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’, ‘test’  OR ➝ die  ‘ Could not connect to the ➝ database!   ’ ; With the recursive function defined, the rest of the script needs to retrieve all the tasks, organize them in an array, and then call the make_list   function. 7. Define and execute the query.  $q = ‘SELECT task_id, parent_id, task ➝ FROM tasks WHERE date_completed=”0000-00-00 00:00:00” ➝ ORDER BY parent_id, date_added ➝ ASC’; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; The query retrieves three pieces of infor- mation for each task: its ID, its parent_id, and the task itself. The conditional means that only noncompleted tasks are selected. The results are also ordered by the parent_id, so that every top-level task  with a parent_id of 0  is returned first. A secondary ordering by the date_added returns the tasks in the order they were added  an assumption being that’s how they are prioritized .  8. Add each task to an array.  $tasks = array  ; while  list $task_id, $parent_id, ➝ $task  = mysqli_fetch_ ➝ array $r, MYSQLI_NUM   {  $tasks[$parent_id][$task_id]   ➝ =  $task; }  Advanced PHP Techniques  The $tasks array will store every task. Figure 1.20 shows the final structure. As described in Step 4, the array’s outer- most key is the parent_id value from the table. The value of this outermost array is an array of the tasks with that parent_id.  9. Add a debugging line, if desired.    echo ‘ ’ . print_r $tasks,1  . ➝ ‘ ’; When dealing with multidimensional arrays, it’s vitally important to know and understand the structure you’re working with. When you uncomment this line  by removing the two slashes , the script will print the array like you see in Figure 1.20. 10. Call the make_list   function, sending it  the array of top-level tasks. make_list $tasks[0] ; Although the $tasks variable is a multi- dimensional array, the make_list   func- tion needs to be called only once, send- ing it the first array element. This ele- ment’s value is an array of tasks whose parent_id is 0. Within the function, for each of these tasks, a check will see if there are subtasks. So the function will end up accessing every task thanks to its recursive nature.  11.

Add some more subtasks and retest in  your Web browser  Figure 1.22 .  ✔ Tips    The PHP manual suggests that you  should avoid any recursive function that may call itself over 100 to 200 times. Doing so could crash the script or the Web server.    This page does assume that some tasks were returned by the database. You may want to add a conditional checking that $tasks isn’t empty prior to calling the make_list   function.  Figure 1.21 The page of tasks, as a bunch of nested lists.

The example count_to_100   function  see the preceding section of this chapter  could be rewritten like so with the same result: function count_to_100    {  static $n = 1; if  $n <= 100  {  echo $n . ' '; $n++; count_to_100   ;  }  } count_to_100   ;  Of course, that’s not a very useful implemen- tation of the concept. The very astute reader may have wondered how I achieved the result in Figure 1.3. Showing the values being com- pared is not hard, but counting the iterations requires the use of static. Toward this end, sort.php will be modified.     A d v a n c e d F u n c t i o n D e f i n i t i o n s     25  Completing This Example  This example was primarily written to demonstrate multidimensional arrays and recursive functions. Still, it’s a nice exam- ple and worth implementing in a live site  the ability to nest tasks is great . If you wanted to do so, one feature you’d likely need is the ability to mark a task as com- pleted. An example later in the chapter will do just that. Another alteration would be to change the add_task.php page so that the drop-down menu reflects the hierarchy as well.  Another likely addition would be the  ability to add multiple tasks at once. And you may want to consider an edit task option. While you’re at it, the view tasks page could have a link that passes a value in the URL indicating whether all tasks should be displayed or just uncom- pleted ones. These are just some ideas.

The first is the declaration of a static variable called $count. It’s ini- tially set to 1, but that assignment only applies the first time this function is called  because it’s a static variable .  Then the iteration number is printed  how many times this function has  been called , along with the values being compared. Finally, the $count variable is incremented.  continues on page 28  Script 1.4 This modified version of the sorting script will reveal how many times each sorting function is invoked, thanks to a static variable.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">          Sorting Multidimensional Arrays       <?php  Script 1.4 - sort2.php  This page creates a multidimensional array of names and grades.

This means that a function receives the value of a variable, not the actual variable itself. The function can also be described as making a copy of the variable. This is fine, as long as that variable does not need to be altered within the function. To alter the value of a variable within a function, you need to either use the global statement or pass the variable by reference.  To pass a variable by reference instead of by value, precede the variable in the argument list with the ampersand  & . function increment  &$var  {  Alternatively, the function definition can stay the same and how the function is called would change: function increment  $var  {  You probably won’t  or shouldn’t  find yourself passing values by reference often, but like the other techniques in this chapter, it’s often the perfect solution to an advanced problem.  $var++;  } $num = 2; increment $num ; echo $num;    3  $var++;  } $num = 2; increment &$num ; echo $num;    3     s n o i t i n i f e D n o i t c n u F d e c n a v d A     30   Advanced PHP Techniques  The Heredoc Syntax Heredoc, in case you’ve never heard the term before, is an alternative way for encapsulat- ing strings. It’s used and seen much less often than the standard single or double quotes, but it fulfills the same role. Heredoc is like putting peanut butter on bananas: you either grow up doing it or you don’t. The heredoc method works just like a double quote in that the values of variables will be printed, but you can define your own delimiter, which is particularly nice when printing oodles of HTML  with its own double-quotation marks . The only catch to heredoc is that its syntax is very particular!  The heredoc syntax starts with <<<, immedi- ately followed by an identifier. The identifier is normally a word in all caps. It can only contain alphanumeric characters plus the underscore  no spaces , and it cannot begin with a number. There should be nothing on the same line after the initial identifier, not even a space! So usage of heredoc might begin like echo <<<EOT blah…  or $string = <<<EOD blah…  continues on next page     T h e H e r e d o c S y n t a x     31   Chapter 1  At the end of the string, use the same identi- fier without the <<<. The closing identifier has to be the very first item on the line  it cannot be indented at all  and can only be followed by a semicolon! Examples: echo <<<EOT Somevar $var Thisvar $that EOT; $string = <<<EOD string with $var \n EOD;  Using EOD and EOT as delimiters is common  they’re unlikely to show up in the string   but not required. The heredoc syntax is a nice option but—and I’m trying to drive this point home—it’s very particular. Failure to get the syntax 100 percent correct—even an errant space—results in a parse error.  As an example of this, let’s write a new  version of the view_tasks.php page that allows for marking tasks as updated   Figure 1.27 .     x a t n y S c o d e r e H e h T     To use the heredoc syntax: 1. Open view_tasks.php  Script 1.3  in your  text editor or IDE.  2. Within the make_list   function, change  the printing of the task to  Script 1.5 : echo <<<EOT  <input type=”checkbox” ➝ name=”tasks[$task_id]” value=”done” ➝  > $todo EOT; This is a good use of the heredoc syntax, as it’s an alternative to: echo “ <input type=\”checkbox\” ➝ name=\”tasks[$task_id]\” ➝ value=\”done\”  >$todo”; That syntax, in my opinion, has way too many double quotation marks to escape. The single quotation mark example isn’t as bad but requires concatenation: echo ‘ <input type=”checkbox” ➝ name=”tasks[‘. $task_id . ‘]” ➝ value=”done”  > ‘ . $todo; With the heredoc code, be absolutely cer- tain that nothing follows the opening identifier  EOT  except a return  a carriage return or newline  and that the closing identifier starts as the very first thing on its own line.  continues on page 35  Figure 1.27 The page for viewing tasks will now have check boxes to mark tasks as complete.  32   Script 1.5 The original view_tasks.php page  Script 1.3  has been modified as a form so that tasks can be checked off. The heredoc syntax aids in the creation of some of the HTML.

Advanced PHP Techniques  Using printf   and sprintf   For most PHP programmers, the print   and echo   functions are all they need for printing text and variables. The advanced PHP programmer might occasionally use the more sophisticated printf   function. This function prints text but also has the ability to format the output. The PHP manual defi- nition of this function is printf string format [, mixed ➝ arguments] ;  The format is a combination of literal text and special formatting parameters, begin- ning with the percent sign  % . After that you may have any combination of  in order :  ◆ A sign specifier  + -  to force a positive  number to show the plus sign.  ◆ A padding specifier that indicates the  character used for right-padding  space is the default, but you might want to use 0 for numbers .  ◆ An alignment specifier  default is right- justified, use - to force left-justification .  ◆ A number indicating the minimum width  to be used.  ◆ A precision specifier for how many deci- mal digits should be shown for floating- point numbers  or how many characters in a string .  ◆ The type specifier; see Table 1.2.  continues on next page     U s i n g p r i n t f       a n d s p r i n t f         37  Table 1.2 These type specifiers are used to format values used in the printf   and sprintf   functions.  Type Specifiers  C h a r a c t e r b c d e u f o s x  M e a n i n g binary integer ASCII integer standard integer scientific notation unsigned decimal integer floating-point number octal integer string hexadecimal integer   Figure 1.30 The same number printed using four different type specifiers.  Figure 1.31 Using printf   to format how numbers are printed.  Figure 1.32 Printing a mix of numbers and strings.  Chapter 1  This all may seem complicated, and well, it kind of is. You can start practicing by playing with a number  Figure 1.30 : printf ‘b: %b  c: %c   d: %d ➝   f: %f  ’, 80, 80, 80, 80 ;  That’s four different representations of the same number. The first format will print 80 as a binary number, the second as 80’s corre- sponding ASCII character  the capital letter P , the third as an integer, and the fourth as a floating-point number.  From there, take the two most common number types—d and f—and add some for- matting  Figure 1.31 : printf ‘%0.2f  %+d  %0.2f <br ➝  >’, 8, 8, 1235.456 ;  First, the number 8 is printed as a floating- point number, with two digits after the deci- mal and padded with zeros. Next, the num- ber 8 is printed as a signed integer. Finally, the number 1235.456 is printed as a floating- point number with two digits after the deci- mal  resulting in the rounding of the number .  Taking this idea further, mix in the string type  Figure 1.32 : printf ‘The cost of %d %s at $%0.2f each ➝ is $%0.2f.’, 4, ‘brooms’, 8.50, ➝  4*8.50  ;  The sprintf   function works exactly like printf  , but instead of printing the format- ted string, it returns it. This function is great for generating database queries, without an ugly mixing of SQL and variables  and poten- tially function calls .         f t n i r p s d n a       f t n i r p g n i s U     38   Advanced PHP Techniques  To use sprintf  : 1.

Change the line that defines the INSERT  query to read: $q = sprintf “INSERT INTO tasks ➝  parent_id, task  VALUES  %d, ➝ ‘%s’ ”, $parent_id, ➝ mysqli_real_escape_string $dbc, ➝ $_POST[‘task’]  ; By using the sprintf   function, the query can be created without interspers- ing SQL and variables. While doing so wasn’t too ugly in the original script, in more complex queries the result can be hideous  lots of {$var[‘index’]} and such , prone to errors, and hard to debug. This syntax separates the query from the data being used and is still able to incor- porate a function call, all without using concatenation or other techniques.  4. Change the action attribute of the form  to add_task2.php. echo ‘<form action=”add_task2.php” ➝ method=”post”>    Add a Task   Task: <input name=”task” ➝ type=”text” size=”60” ➝ maxlength=”100”  >   Parent Task: <select ➝ name=”parent_id”><option value=”0”>None  ‘; This file will be renamed, so the form needs to be adjusted, too.  continues on next page     U s i n g p r i n t f       a n d s p r i n t f         41   Chapter 1  5. If you want, remove all the lines required  to view the list of tasks. The view_tasks.php page  and its sec- ond version  both do this much better,  so there’s no need to still include that code here.  6. Save the file as add_task2.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figures 1.33 and 1.34 .  ✔ Tips    To use a literal percent sign in a string,  escape it with another percent sign: printf ‘The tax rate is %0.2f%%’, ➝ $tax ;    The vprintf   function works exactly like printf   but only takes two argu- ments: the format and an array of values.    The scanf   and fscanf   functions also work exactly like printf   and sprintf   in terms of formatting parameters. The scanf   function is used for reading input; fscanf   is used to read data  from a file.  Figure 1.33 The page should still work exactly as it had before.  Figure 1.34 Another thing to do!         f t n i r p s d n a       f t n i r p g n i s U     42   2  Developing  Web Applications  The life of a PHP programmer normally begins with individual scripts, dedicated to a single purpose. From there one begins using more and more files, building up Web applications. Eventually you might get to developing sites on your own server and, if you’re lucky, balanced over multiple servers. No matter how large your projects are, learning new and improved ways to develop Web applications is an important part of the life of the PHP programmer. As is being reminded to abide by the fundamentals.  In this chapter, the focus is on developing Web applications beyond the beginner or intermediate level. Assuming a mastery of standard Web application tools, like using sessions and templates, the topics here range from a reassertion of the fundamentals  which become more vital in larger projects  to changing the way you create pages. The chapter ends on two kinds of caching, both used to influence the client server relationship.     D e v e l o p i n g W e b A p p l i c a t i o n s     43   Chapter 2  Documenting Code Properly documenting one’s code is so vitally important that I wish PHP would generate errors when it came across a lack of com- ments! Having taught PHP and interacted with readers for years, I am amazed at how often comments are omitted, occasionally under the guise of waiting until later. Proper documentation is something that should be incorporated into code for your own good, for your client’s, for your co-workers’  if applicable , and for the programmer in the future who may have to alter or augment your work. Even—or especially—if that pro- grammer is you.  Arguably, one cannot over-document one’s work. Make notes about functions, variables, sections of code, and pages as a whole. And remember that documentation is some- thing you should implement when you begin coding and continue to do as you work. Attempting to go in after the fact to make notes just isn’t the same  and fre- quently won’t happen at all . What seems obvious at the time of creation will be per- plexing just three months later.     e d o C g n i t n e m u c o D  44  Comments and White  Space in Book Code  Because of the confines of the book for- mat, the scripts developed in my books are never as well documented or organ- ized as I would prefer  or as you should . But there’s reasonably a limit as to how much valuable book space should be taken up with lines like    Developed by: Larry E. Ullman.  Assuming that you are learning things from me and this book  that is the think- ing, right? , then, when it comes to code documentation and layout, use what you see here as the base: the absolute mini- mum of what you should do. The amount of comments in my books may be suffi- cient but could be safely doubled.   Developing Web Applications  To document your code: 1. At the top of a script, thoroughly docu-  ment all the meta-properties. “Meta-properties” refers to information about the file: who created it, when, why, as part of what site, etc. Also include information about yourself, even if you don’t think anyone else will ever see the source code.  2. Document any contingencies.  This is just a more specific type of docu- mentation than that in Step 1. By “con- tingency,” I mean what things must exist or happen for this script to do its job. Does it receive information from a form or a database? Does it rely upon PEAR or other external code? Does it use a tem- plate? Basically make a note of any other file that this script interacts with or includes. If the script assumes a mini- mum version of PHP, note that too. 3. Thoroughly describe every function. Functions should be commented like scripts: note their purpose, their contin- gencies, what values they take, what value s  they return, etc.  4. Indicate the purpose of a variable if it  would not be already completely obvious to the most basic programmer. Hopefully a variable’s name is a good indicator of its purpose, but don’t always assume such things are crystal clear. 5. Explain what sequences of code are  going to do.  continues on next page  D o c u m e n t i n g C o d e     45   Chapter 2  6. Indicate the purpose of a conditional.  ✔ Tips  Make sure it’s clear why you’re using the condition you’re using and what the desired results are. If a conditional refer- ences a specific number or value, com- ment on why that number or value is being used.  7. Mark the closing brackets for complex  functions and control structures  condi- tionals, loops, etc. . You’ll see this commonly in my scripts: }    End of some_name   function.  8. Update your comments when you  change your code! This is a common and problematic mis- take: you update your code but don’t update the comment. Then, when you come back to review the code later, you read that the code does X but it actually does Y and you can’t tell which is sup- posed to be correct.    The popular phpDocumentor  www.  phpdoc.org, Figure 2.1  is used by PEAR to automatically generate package docu- mentation. This tool, written in PHP and similar to the common JavaDoc  for Java programmers , creates comments within your scripts by actually reading the code itself. This shouldn’t be used in lieu of your own comments, but it can add stan- dardized documentation to a page.    Somewhat outdated but still useful is  the PHP Coding Standard. It’s worth a read, even if you don’t abide by all its suggestions. Unfortunately it tends to float around the Web a lot  its URL has changed several times over , so do a search to find it.    You can also find many suggestions  on comments, style, and structure by checking out coding standards for other languages.     e d o C g n i t n e m u c o D  Figure 2.1 The home page of phpDocumentor.  46   Developing Web Applications  Code Style and Structure As the second topic to be discussed under the implied heading of “you know you should be doing these things but aren’t for some reason,” I want to take a couple pages to talk about code style and structure. The fundamentals of code structure refer to how you indent your code, skip blank lines, use braces and parentheses, and so forth. Proper syntax implies a certain amount of struc- ture, but there are really two golden rules:  ◆ Be consistent!  ◆ Make your code easy to read.  I cannot stress enough that consistency  is the most important consideration. Inconsistency will lead to unnecessary  errors and extra hours of debugging.  Style is a much more subjective guideline, involving naming conventions  pages, vari- ables, classes, and functions , where you define and how you organize functions, and so forth. Style is entirely a matter of user preference. Any recommendations anyone, including myself, has on the subject are merely suggestions. The only absolute must is that you be consistent!        C o d e S t y l e a n d S t r u c t u r e     47   Chapter 2  To structure and style your code:  ◆ Always use curly braces, even if syntacti-  cally speaking you don’t have to. Many programmers will ignore this rec- ommendation, but it’s so much more foolproof to use curly braces all the time.  ◆ Indent blocks of code  e.g., results of  conditionals or function content  one tab stop or four spaces.  Formally, one should use spaces in lieu of tabs, but coders use the more convenient tab option regardless.  How you indent your code goes directly toward how easy it is to read. Indentation should make clear the rela- tionship between code and the control structures  loops, conditionals, etc. , functions, classes, and so on that the code is part of.  ◆ Use blank lines to visually separate relat-  ed sections of code.  ◆ Put spaces between words, function  arguments, operators, and so forth, as allowed  PHP is generally, but not univer- sally, insensitive to white space .  ◆ Place functions at the beginning of a  document or in a separate file.  ◆ Always use the formal PHP tags.  Because XML uses short tags     for its own purpose, you must use the formal PHP tags     when using XML, as you’ll see in Chapter 14, “XML and PHP.” The recommendation is to  use the formal tags regardless because that is the best way to ensure cross-server compatibility.  ◆ It is suggested that .php always be used as the file extension for pages that are to be treated as PHP scripts.  Includes such as classes and configuration pages may use different extensions.  Acceptable file extensions are deter- mined by the Web server’s configuration, but within the PHP community the movement is toward making .php the default.  Site Structure  Much like your code structure and documentation, another overarching issue when develop- ing larger Web applications is that of site structure: how the files are organized and stored on the server. Proper site structure is intended to improve security and administration of a site, as well as promote scalability, portability, and ease of modifications.  The key to site structure is to break up your code and applications into different pages and directories according to use, purpose, and function. Within the primary Web documents folder, which I’ll call html, you would have one directory for images  most everyone does do this, at least , another for classes  if using object-oriented programming , another for func- tions, and so forth. Further, I would suggest that you use your own personalized folder names for security purposes. Anytime that a malicious user is blind to the names of folders and doc- uments, the better. If you use the name admin for the administration section of a site, you’re not doing yourself any favors, security-wise.     e r u t c u r t S d n a e l y t S e d o C        48   Developing Web Applications  Modularizing a Web Site In my experience, the arc of a programmer’s development starts with writing one-page applications that do just a single thing. These turn into two-page tools, and eventu- ally into multipage sites, using templates, sessions, and or cookies to tie them all together. For many programmers, though, the arc is actually a bell curve. After more and more experience, the seasoned PHP developer starts doing the same amount of work in fewer pages, like having the same script both display and handle a form. Or, conversely, the advanced PHP programmer may start making individual scripts that actually do less, by focusing each on a par- ticular task. This is the premise behind modularizing a Web site.  For this example, I’ll create a dummy Web site  i.e., it won’t do much  that’s broken into pieces. The new knowledge here will be how those features are separated, organized, and put back together. Instead of having individual pages  contact.php, about.php, index.php, etc. , the entire application will be run through one index page. That page will include the appropriate content module based upon values passed in the URL.  M o d u l a r i z i n g a W e b S i t e           49   Chapter 2  Creating the configuration file Every Web application I build begins with a configuration file. Configuration files serve several purposes, the four most important being:  To create the configuration file: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 2.1 . <?php  Script 2.1 - config.inc.php  continues on page 53  ◆ Defining constants  ◆ Establishing site-wide settings  ◆ Creating user functions  ◆ Managing errors  Basically, any piece of information that every page in a site might need to access should be stored in a configuration file.  As a side note, if a function would not likely be used by the majority of site pages, I would put it in a separate file, thereby avoiding the extra overhead of defining it on pages where it won’t be called.            e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  50   Script 2.1 The configuration file is the key back-end script. It defines site-wide constants and dictates how errors are handled.

Set the email address to be used for  errors. $contact_email = ➝ ‘address@example.com’; For live sites, I prefer to be emailed when errors occur. So I declare a variable with the “to” email address. This may be my address while developing a site or a client’s once the site goes live.  4. Determine if the script is running on the  live server or a test server. if  stristr $_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’], ➝ ‘local’    Developing Web Applications  ➝  substr $_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’],  ➝ 0, 7  == ‘192.168’   {  $local = TRUE;  } else {  $local = FALSE;  } I almost always develop on a local server and then upload the completed site to the live server. The two environments will have server-specific settings, so the con- figuration file ought to confirm which is the current environment. To see if the site is running locally, I check two condi- tions against $_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’]. If that variable contains the word local  as in http:  localhost or http:  power- book.local  or if the IP address begins with 192.168  indicating a local network , then a $local variable is set as TRUE. Otherwise, it is FALSE.  5. Set the server-specific constants.  if  $local  {  $debug = TRUE; define  ‘BASE_URI’,  ➝ ‘ path to html folder ’ ;  define  ‘BASE_URL’,  ➝ ‘http:  localhost directory ’ ;  define  ‘DB’,  ➝ ‘ path to mysql.inc.php’ ; } else {  define  ‘BASE_URI’,  ➝ ‘ path to live html folder ’ ;  define  ‘BASE_URL’,  ➝ ‘http:  www.example.com ’ ;  define  ‘DB’,  ➝ ‘ path to live mysql.inc.php’ ; }  continues on next page  53  M o d u l a r i z i n g a W e b S i t e            Chapter 2  I always use these three constants in my Web applications. The BASE_URI is the absolute path to where the site’s root folder is on the server  Figure 2.2 . This constant makes it easy to use absolute URLs when any script includes a file. The BASE_URL constant is the hostname and directory  if applicable . On a test server, that might be just http:  localhost  ch02 . Finally, the DB constant is the absolute path to the file that contains the database connectivity information. For security purposes, it’s best to keep this stored outside of the Web directory. Note that each constant is represented twice: once for a test server and once for the live server. If this is a test server  $local is TRUE , I also turn on debug- ging, which will mean more shortly.  6. Set the debugging level. if  !isset $debug   { $debug = FALSE;  } I use a $debug variable to indicate how errors should be handled. If the site is being run locally, $debug will be TRUE. To debug a live site, a page would need to use the line $debug = TRUE; prior to including the configuration file. In all other cases, debugging is turned off.           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  54  Figure 2.2 The root folder is where the site’s index page may be found. Within the root folder, other subfolders—such as images, includes, and modules— would be found.   7. Begin a function for handling errors.  8. Build up the error message.  function my_error_handler  $e_number, ➝ $e_message, $e_file, $e_line, ➝ $e_vars  {  global $debug, $contact_email;  PHP allows you to define your own func- tion for handling errors, rather than using the built-in behavior. For more informa- tion on this process or the syntax, see the PHP manual or my PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickStart Guide book  Peachpit Press, 2005 . Two global variables will be used in this function.  Developing Web Applications  $message = “An error occurred in ➝ script ‘$e_file’ on line $e_line: ➝ \n $e_message\n ”; $message .= “Date Time: “ . date ‘n- ➝ j-Y H:i:s’  . “\n ”; $message .= “ ” . print_r ➝  $e_vars, 1  . “ \n ”; For debugging purposes, the error mes- sage should be as informative as possible. To start, it will include the name of the file where the error occurred and on what line. Then the date and time of  the error are appended to the message. Finally, every existing variable is added. This can be a lot of data  Figure 2.3 , but that’s a good thing when you need  to find and fix a problem.  continues on next page  M o d u l a r i z i n g a W e b S i t e           Figure 2.3 This is just some of the data reported when an error occurs.  55   Chapter 2  9.  If debugging is turned on, print the error. if  $debug  {  echo ‘ ’ .  ➝ $message . ‘ ’; If debugging is turned on, then the full message will appear in the Web browser  Figure 2.4 . This is great when devel- oping a site but a huge security flaw on a live site. You can also edit this code to fit into your site’s design.  10. If debugging is turned off, send the mes-  sage in an email and print a default  message. } else {  error_log  $message, 1,   ➝ $contact_email ;  if    $e_number != E_NOTICE  &&  ➝  $e_number < 2048   {  echo ‘<p class=  ➝ ”error”>A system error occurred. ➝ We apologize for the  ➝ inconvenience. ’;  }  }    End of $debug IF. For a live site, the detailed error message should not be shown  unless debugging is temporarily enabled for that page   but should be emailed instead. The error_log   function will do this, if provided with the number 1 as its sec- ond argument. But the user probably needs to know that something didn’t go right, so a generic message is displayed  Figure 2.5 . If the error happens to be  a notice or a strict error  having a value of 2048 , no message should be printed, as the error is likely not interfering with the operation of the page.           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  56  Figure 2.4 How errors appear when debugging a page.  Figure 2.5 On a live site, errors are handled more modestly  and securely .   Developing Web Applications  11.

Save the file as config.inc.php and place it in your Web directory  in an includes subfolder . Figure 2.2 shows the directory layout I’ll use for this site.  Creating the Database File  I have not, for this application, created  a database configuration file, as the site does not involve any databases. If a database were required, I would write a mysql.inc.php  or postgresql.inc.php or oracle.inc.php or whatever  file that establishes the database connection. Such a file should also define any functions that involve the database application.  This file could also be stored in the includes directory but would preferably be stored outside of the Web directory. The config.inc.php file has a constant named DB that should be an absolute path to this file on the server.  Any page that needs a database connec- tion could then include it by just using require_once DB ;  Because DB represents an absolute  path to that file, it wouldn’t matter if  the including script was in the main  folder or a subdirectory.  M o d u l a r i z i n g a W e b S i t e           57   Chapter 2  Creating the HTML template Using an HTML template is a virtual cer- tainty with any larger-scale application. You can use Smarty  http:  smarty.php.net  or many other templating systems, but I prefer to use just two simple files: a header that contains everything in a page up until the page-specific content, and a footer that con- tains the rest of the page  Figure 2.6 .  For this template, I’ll use a design found on Open Source Web Design  www.oswd.org , an excellent Web design resource. This particu- lar design  Figure 2.7  is by Anthony Yeung  www.smallpark.org  and is gratefully used with his kind permission. To create the template pages: 1. Design an HTML page in your text or  WYSIWYG editor. To start creating a template for a Web site, design the layout like a standard HTML page, independent of any PHP code. For this example, as I already said, I’ll be using the Leaves CSS design  Figure 2.7 . Note: In order to save space, the CSS file for this example  which controls the lay- out  is not included in the book.You can download the file through the book’s supporting Web site  www.DMCInsights. com phpvqp2 , see the site’s Extras page  or do without it  the template will still work; it just won’t look as nice .           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  2. Copy everything from the first line of the  layout’s source to just before the page- specific content and paste it in a new document  Script 2.2 . That is, start from <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C   ➝ DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” ➝ “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml”>   and continue through        This first file will contain the initial HTML tags  from DOCTYPE through the head and into the beginning of the page body . It also has the code that makes the column of links on the left side of the browser window and the sidebar on the right  see Figure 2.7 . I’ve omitted a good chunk of the HTML from this step. For the com- plete code, see Script 2.2 or just down- load the file from the book’s Web site.  continues on page 60  Figure 2.6 A very crude representation of how to create a template for a site by wrapping two included files around the page-specific content area. 58  Figure 2.7 The template this site will use for all  its pages.

Change the page’s title line to read:  <?php echo $page_title; ➝ ?>  I’ll want the page title  which appears at the top of the Web browser; Page Title in Figure 2.7  to be changeable on a page- by-page basis. To do so, I set this as a variable that will be printed out by PHP. 4. Before any HTML, create a PHP section  that checks for a $page_title. <?php  Script 2.2 - header.html if  !isset $page_title   $page_title ➝ = ‘Default Page Title’; ?> Just in case a PHP script includes  the header file without having set a $page_title first, this PHP code declares  a default page title  which you’ll likely want to make more meaningful . If you don’t do this and error reporting is turned on, the browser title could end up like Figure 2.8.           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  Figure 2.8 Make sure that a $page_title value is set, or else the error reporting system will end up printing a detailed error message there instead.  60   Script 2.3 The footer file completes the HTML template.  5.

Some pro- grammers like to use .inc to indicate that a file is used as an include. In this case, you could also use .inc.html, which would indicate that it’s both an include and an HTML file  to distinguish it from includes full of PHP code .  6.

In fact, it’s the  only page that should ever be loaded in  the Web browser. The index page has but  a single purpose: to assemble all the proper pieces to make the complete Web page. Accomplishing this might involve:  ◆ Including a configuration file  ◆ Including a database connectivity file  ◆ Incorporating an HTML template  ◆ Determining and including the proper  content module  With this in mind, it’s really just a matter of thinking out all the code and making sure it’s securely handled. I’ll explain in more detail in the following steps.  To create the main page: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 2.4 . <?php  Script 2.4 - index.php  2. Include the configuration file require_once  ‘. includes  ➝ config.inc.php’ ; The configuration file defines many important things, so it should be  included first.  continues on page 64  Script 2.4 The index page is the script through which everything happens. It determines what module should be included, requires the configuration file, and pulls together the HTML template.  <?php  Script 2.4 - index.php   *  * * * *   This is the main page. This page includes the configuration file,  the templates, and any content-specific modules.     Require the configuration file before any PHP code: require_once  '. includes config.inc.php' ;     Validate what page to show: if  isset $_GET['p']   {  $p = $_GET['p'];  } elseif  isset $_POST['p']   {    Forms  $p = $_POST['p'];  } else {  $p = NULL;  }     Determine what page to display: switch  $p  {           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  62   script continues on next page    Script 2.4 continued  24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73  case 'about':  $page = 'about.inc.php'; $page_title = 'About This Site'; break;  case 'this':  $page = 'this.inc.php'; $page_title = 'This is Another Page.'; break;  case 'that':  $page = 'that.inc.php'; $page_title = 'That is Also a Page.'; break;  case 'contact':  $page = 'contact.inc.php'; $page_title = 'Contact Us'; break;  case 'search':  $page = 'search.inc.php'; $page_title = 'Search Results'; break;     Default is to include the main page. default:  $page = 'main.inc.php'; $page_title = 'Site Home Page'; break;  }    End of main switch.     Make sure the file exists: if  !file_exists '. modules ' . $page   {  $page = 'main.inc.php'; $page_title = 'Site Home Page';     Include the header file: include_once  '. includes header.html' ;     Include the content-specific module:    $page is determined from the above switch. include  '. modules ' . $page ;     Include the footer file to complete the template: include_once  '. includes footer.html' ;  }  ?>  Developing Web Applications  M o d u l a r i z i n g a W e b S i t e           63   Chapter 2  3. Validate the page being shown.  if  isset $_GET[‘p’]   {  $p = $_GET[‘p’];  } elseif  isset $_POST[‘p’]   {  $p = $_POST[‘p’];  } else {  $p = NULL;  } The specific content being shown will  be based upon a value sent to this page. When clicking links, the value will be sent in the URL. When most forms are submitted, the value will be sent in $_POST. If neither is the case, set $p to NULL.  4. Begin a switch conditional that deter-  mines the page title and file. switch  $p  {  case ‘about’:  $page = ‘about.inc.php’; $page_title = ‘About  ➝ This Site’;  break;  Each module has a name of something. inc.php, which is my way of indicating that it’s both a PHP script but also an included file. Due to the way computers handle extensions, only the final exten- sion really matters  i.e., if you were to run the file directly, it would be treated as a PHP script . For each module, the page’s title  which will appear in the browser window  is also set.           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  64  5. Complete the switch.  case ‘this’:  $page = ‘this.inc.php’; $page_title = ‘This is  $page = ‘that.inc.php’; $page_title = ‘That is  ➝ Another Page.’;  break;  case ‘that’:  ➝ Also a Page.’;  break; case ‘contact’: $page = ➝ ‘contact.inc.php’;  ➝ ‘Contact Us’;  break; case ‘search’: $page = ➝ ‘search.inc.php’;  ➝ Results’;  break;  default:  $page_title =   $page_title = ‘Search  $page = ‘main.inc.php’; $page_title = ‘Site Home  ➝ Page’;  break;  }    End of main switch. For each possible content module, another switch case is provided. For security purposes, the default case is critical. If $p does not have a value or does not have a valid value—one of the specific cases— then the main.inc.php file will be used. This is a necessary security step because some ill-intended person will see that your site has a URL like index.php?p= contact and will attempt to do something like index.php?p= path to something  useful. In such a case, the page’s main content will be included.   Developing Web Applications  6. Confirm that the module file exists. if  !file_exists ‘. modules ’ . ➝ $page   {  $page = ‘main.inc.php’; $page_title = ‘Site Home Page’;  } This isn’t absolutely necessary as long as the right module file exists for each case in the switch. However, including this code provides an extra layer of security.  Include the header file. include_once  ‘. includes header.html’ ; This is the start of the HTML template.  Include the module. include  ‘. modules ’ . $page ; This brings in all the specific content.  Include the footer file. include_once  ‘. includes footer.html’ ; This completes the HTML template.  7.  8.  9.  10. Complete the page.  ?>  11. Save the file as index.php and place it in  your Web directory. You can’t test it until you’ve created some of the content modules  at least main.inc.php .  ✔ Tip    The switch conditional that validates  proper $p values is an important securi- ty measure. Another is using a separate variable for the name of the included file  i.e., $page . The following code would be highly insecure: include  $_GET[‘p’] ;  65  M o d u l a r i z i n g a W e b S i t e           My Security Anecdote  In the summer of 2006, I revamped my company’s Web site  www.DMCInsights.com , using a modularized layout, to a small extent. Literally the first night the new version of the site went live, someone tried hacking the server by changing URLs like about.php?i=phpmysql2 into about.php?i=http:  somesite.com  file.txt. The file.txt script on that other server contained PHP code that would reveal every file on my server. Had it run, my site’s security would have been compromised.  The attempt did not work for two rea- sons. First, I was smart about validating my $_GET[‘i’] data, associating proper values to scripts. Second, I was careful about how files were included. Just as important, though, was the error report- ing I had implemented. As the site was live, the user saw nothing informative when they tried to include an invalid file but I was notified via email of the attempt.   To create the main module: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 2.5 . <?php  Script 2.5 - main.inc.php  continues on page 68  Chapter 2  Creating content modules Now that all the legwork has been done and the configuration, template, and index files have been written, it’s time to start creating the actual content modules. With this sys- tem, a content module is stunningly simple to implement. The content files do not need to include the configuration or the template files, as the main script already does that. And because all the content files are includes, they can contain literal HTML or PHP code.  There is one catch: the modules should not be loadable directly. If one were to directly access main.inc.php  or any other module  in their Web browser, they’d see the result without the HTML template  Figure 2.9 , without the proper error management, and possibly without the database connectivity. So every module should have some code that redirects the user to the proper page, if accessed directly.           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  Figure 2.9 Content modules shouldn’t be accessed directly through a URL, since they would then lack the HTML template  among other things .  66   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  24 25  26 27  Script 2.5 The first content module has the HTML for the main page.

It was surprisingly simple, so I want to run through another example to show some variety. As a demonstration of a PHP-driven module, I’ll sketch out the search feature. Keep in mind that, having no real content and no database back end, it’s impossible to implement a real search with this example. But that’s not important any- way. The focus here is on how you would use PHP to handle forms within the modular structure. Once again, I think you’ll be sur- prised by how uncomplicated it is.           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  70   Script 2.6 The search module pretends to return some results as a way of demonstrating how easy it is to handle forms, even in a modularized structure.

Redirect if this page was accessed directly: if  !defined 'BASE_URL'   {     Need the BASE_URL, defined in the config file: require_once  '.. includes config.inc.php' ;     Redirect to the index page: $url = BASE_URL .

There are two changes. First, the redirection URL is changed to BASE_URL plus index.php?p=search. This technique can be used for any module so that the user is redirected to the page they want—via index.php. Second, if, for some inexplicable reason, the user arrived on this page while submitting a form, then the search terms would be present in the URL. If so, those terms will be passed along as well. The end result will be that going directly to www.example. com modules search.inc.php?terms=blah still results in a valid search.  3. Print a caption.  echo ‘ Search Results ’;  4. Check for a proper search term. if  isset $_GET[‘terms’]  && ➝  $_GET[‘terms’] != ‘Search...’    { The database search would only take place if a search term were passed along in the URL. The search box uses Search… as the default value, so that needs to be ruled out.  72           e t i S b e W a g n i z i r a l u d o M  Using Frameworks  Frameworks are libraries of established code meant to facilitate development. There are many well-conceived frame- works available for PHP, well over 40 at last count. Zend, the company behind  the PHP engine, has recently entered the framework discussion with its own ver- sion  http:  framework.zend.com .  Frameworks normally use a modular sys- tem, like the one implemented in this chapter, but on a much more elaborate scale. The arguments for using frame- works are the same as those for using OOP or PEAR: they allow you to quickly build applications with  hopefully  better features and security. The arguments against using frameworks are also com- parable to OOP and PEAR: they require time and effort to learn, let alone master, and may be difficult to customize. It’s also probable that framework-driven sites will run more slowly  due to extra pro- cessing required .  Personally, I’m not a framework person, as I like to get my hands dirty with code, but you may like them. For a good dis- cussion and comparison of ten popular frameworks, see www.phpit.net article  ten-different-php-frameworks    Figure 2.11 No search is performed without a term being submitted.  Figure 2.12 Any search term will turn up these dummy results.  Developing Web Applications  5.

This is some ➝ description. \n EOT; } Since there’s no database to search, I’ll just use a for loop to print ten search results. I’m using the heredoc syntax here, as described in Chapter 1, “Advanced PHP Techniques.”  6. Complete the page.  } else {  echo ‘ Please ➝ use the search form at the top of ➝ the window to search this ➝ site. ’; } ?> This conditional applies if no valid search terms were entered  Figure 2.11 .  7.

Caching a page is a matter of storing its content  or part of its content, like an image or video  and then providing that stored version, rather than the version on the server, when a request is made.  For most end users, this is not a problem. In fact, they may not be aware that they are receiving an outdated version of a page or image. But if, while developing a site, you’ve struggled to get your Web browser  let’s face it: the likely culprit is Internet Explorer  to recognize changes you know you’ve made in a page, then you’ve seen the dark side of caching. With your dynamic, PHP-driven sites, sometimes you want to make certain that end users are getting the most up-to- date version of your pages.  Caching—both in Web browsers and proxy servers—can be affected using PHP’s head- er   function. There are four header types involved:  ◆ Last-Modified  ◆ Expires  ◆ Pragma  ◆ Cache-Control  The first three header types are part of the HTTP 1.0 standard. The Last-Modified head- er uses a UTC  Universal Time Coordinated  date-time value. If a caching system sees that the Last-Modified value is more recent than the date on the cached version of the page, it knows to use the new version from the server.  74     e h c a C r e s w o r B e h t g n i t c e f f A         Developing Web Applications  Expires is used as an indicator as to when a cached version of the page should no longer be used  in Greenwich Mean Time . Setting an Expires value in the past should always force the page from the server to be used: header  “Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 ➝ 05:00:00 GMT” ;  Pragma is just a declaration for how the page data should be handled. To avoid caching of a page, use: header  “Pragma: no-cache” ;  The Cache-Control header was added in HTTP 1.1 and is a more finely tuned option.  You should still use the HTTP 1.0 headers as well.  There are numerous Cache-Control settings  Table 2.1 .  Putting all this information together, to keep all systems from caching a page, you would use these headers: header  “Last-Modified: Thu, 9 Nov 2006 ➝ 14:26:00 GMT” ;    Right now! header  “Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 ➝ 05:00:00 GMT” ;    Way back when! header  “Pragma: no-cache” ; header  “Cache-Control: no-cache” ;  While all too common, this is a heavy- handed approach. Certainly not every PHP script you use is uncacheable. Even the most active site could cache some of its scripts for a minute or more  and a very active site would get many requests within a minute; the cached version would save the server all those hits . As a more focused and proper use of these concepts, let’s rewrite the view_tasks.php page  Script 1.3  from Chapter 1.

Because they would be returned in a less usable format  Figure 2.13 , the UNIX_TIMESTAMP   function is applied to make them both integers  Figure 2.14 . Then, the ternary operator is used to assign the largest value  and therefore the most recent date  to the $max variable.     e h c a C r e s w o r B e h t g n i t c e f f A        78   Figure 2.15 The cache-controlled Web page.  Developing Web Applications  5. Define a reasonable caching interval.  $interval = 60 * 60 * 6; “Reasonable” depends upon your page, how many visitors you get  i.e., the serv- er load , and how often it’s updated. For this value, which is in seconds, I use six hours  60 seconds times 60 minutes time 6 .  6. Send the Last-Modified header.  header  “Last-Modified: “ . gmdate ➝  ‘r’, $max  ; This header sets the modification date of this script as the last time the data- base was updated. The “r” gmdate    and date    option will return the date for- matted per the HTTP specifications.  7. Set the Expires header.  header  “Expires: “ . gmdate  “r”, ➝  $max + $interval   ; The expiration value is the current time plus the defined interval.  8. Set the Cache-Control header.  header  “Cache-Control: max-age= ➝ $interval” ; ?> This is just the HTTP 1.1 equivalent of the Expires header. Instead of giving a date value, max-age is set in seconds. 9. Delete the database connection that existed later on in the original script. This has been moved to the top of the script in Step 3.  10. Save the file as view_tasks.php, place in  your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 2.15 .  continues on next page        A f f e c t i n g t h e B r o w s e r C a c h e     79   Chapter 2  ✔ Tips    Note that caching is, in theory, a very  good thing, designed to minimize unnec- essary server requests. If properly con- trolled, caches are great for both the server and the client.    If you have cURL installed on your sys- tem, you can run this command to see a page’s headers  Figure 2.16 : curl --head http:  www.example.com  ➝ page.php Curl is discussed in Chapter 9, “Networking with PHP.”    If your applications make use of sessions,  you can adjust session caching with the session_cache_limit   function. See the manual for more information.    Page caching can also be affected using the META tags, placed within an HTML document’s head. This may not work  as reliably with some browsers as the header   method.    Client server performance can also be  improved—for large scripts—using Zlib output compression or the function ob_gzhandler   . See the PHP manual  for more on both.     e h c a C r e s w o r B e h t g n i t c e f f A        80  Figure 2.16 Using cURL to view the headers returned by the view_tasks.php page.  Server-Side Caching  There is an alternative type of caching you can use to affect the client server relationship. When a PHP script is requested, the Web server asks the PHP module to read and process that code. Server-side caches store preprocessed versions of a script, so that they may be served without processing. Server-side caching can greatly improve your applica- tion’s performance but normally requires more control over the server than the average user has  read: those using a shared hosting service .  If you want to look into and possibly implement server-side caching, there are many options. APC  Alternative PHP Cache  is very popular, so much so that it’s now part of PECL  http:  pecl.php. net . It’s free, but installation can be tricky. Zend  www.zend.com  offers the free Zend Optimizer. It’s fairly easy to install, but you must remember to upgrade it when you upgrade PHP  it’s version-specific .  For options that do not require software installation on a server, there are the PEAR Cache and Cache_Lite packages. It’s also possible to write your own caching system, although that’s probably not the most efficient idea.   3  Advanced Database Concepts  I had many goals in writing this second edition of my PHP Advanced book. The pri- mary aim is to demonstrate what I consider to be “advanced” PHP programming: doing the things you already do but better, doing things tangentially related to PHP, and taking advantage of aspects of the language with which the average user may not be familiar. A second goal is to help solve some of the problems often put forth  to me or otherwise  in emails, forums, and newsgroups. This chapter addresses both goals equally.  For the first example, you’ll see how to use a database to store session data. Doing so offers many advantages, improved security being at the forefront. Next, a thorough discussion on how to work with U.S. zip codes, demonstrated with a distance calcu- lation script  i.e., how far various stores are from a given zip code . The third example introduces stored functions, a new addition to MySQL in version 5  but present in other databases for some time . After that, a common question is addressed: how do you lay out query results horizontally?  Please note: for every example in this chapter I will be using MySQL as the data- base application. Most of these techniques are implementations of theories that  are not database-specific. It shouldn’t be difficult to translate them to whatever database application you’re using. Second, I’ll be exclusively using the Improved MySQL functions, available as of PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1. If you are using earlier ver- sions of either, you’ll need to modify the code to the earlier  the old standard  MySQL functions.     A d v a n c e d D a t a b a s e C o n c e p t s     81   Chapter 3  Storing Sessions  in a Database By default PHP stores all session data  in text files in the server. Normally these files are stored in a temporary folder  like  tmp on Unix and Mac OS X  with file- names matching the session IDs  e.g., ei26b4i2nup742ucho9glmbh84 . PHP also supports the ability to store the same  session data in a database.  The main reason I would recommend mak- ing this change is improved security. On shared hosting servers, every Web site is using the same temporary directory. This means that dozens upon dozens of applica- tions are all reading and writing in the same place. It would be very easy to create a script that reads all the data from all the files in the sessions folder.  Second, moving the session data to a data- base would allow you to easily retrieve more information about your Web site’s sessions in general. Queries could be run indicating the number of active sessions and session data can be backed up.  A third reason to store session data in a database is if you have a site running on multiple servers. When this is the case, the same user may be fed pages from different servers over the course of the same session. The session data stored in a file on one serv- er would be unavailable to the pages on other servers. This isn’t a situation that the majority of developers face, but if you do, there’s really no other option but to go the database route.        e s a b a t a D a n i   s n o i s s e S g n i r o t S     82  Figure 3.1 I’ll put the sessions table within the  test database for this example.  Figure 3.2 This one table will handle all the  session data.  Figure 3.3 Confirming the table’s structure.  ✔ Tip    Another fix for the security concern on   a shared host is to change the session directory for your site. To do so, call the session_save_path   function prior to every session_start   call. You’ll also need to make sure that the new directory exists, of course, and that it has the proper permissions.   Creating the session table The session data will be stored in a special table. This table can be part of an already existing database  like the rest of your appli- cation  or in its own. At a bare minimum, the table needs three columns  Table 3.1 .  The session table can have more than those three columns, but it must have those three. Keep in mind, though, that many things you might be inclined to represent in another column—a user’s ID, for example—would likely be stored in the session data. To create the sessions table: 1. Access your MySQL database using the  mysql client. You can also use phpMyAdmin or what- ever other interface you prefer.  2. Select the test database  Figure 3.1 .  USE test; Since this is just an example, I’ll create the table within the test database.  Table 3.1 A table with just three columns will suffice for storing session data in a database.  Session Table Columns  C o l u m n   Ty p e  CHAR 32  TEXT TIMESTAMP  St o r e s The session ID The session data The last time the session data was accessed  Advanced Database Concepts  3. Create the sessions table  Figure 3.2 .  CREATE TABLE sessions   id CHAR 32  NOT NULL, data TEXT, last_accessed TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY  id   ; The table contains the basic three fields. The id is the primary key. It will always contain a string 32 characters long and can never be NULL. The data column is a TEXT type and it can be NULL  when the session is first started, there is no data . The last_accessed column is a TIME- STAMP. It will therefore always be updated when the session is created  on INSERT  or modified  on UPDATE .  4. Confirm the sessions table structure   Figure 3.3 . DESCRIBE sessions;  ✔ Tips    You don’t have to use MySQL for this example; you could use PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, or any other database.    If your application stores a lot of data in sessions, you’d want to change the size of the session data column to MEDIUMTEXT or LONGTEXT.     S t o r i n g S e s s i o n s   i n a D a t a b a s e        83   Chapter 3  Defining the session functions After creating the database table, storing session data in a database is a two-part process  from a PHP perspective : 1. Define the functions for interacting with  the database.  2. Tell PHP to use these functions.  For this second step, the session_set_save_ handler   function is called. This function should be called with six arguments, each a function name  Table 3.2 .  I’ll briefly discuss what each function should receive  as arguments  and do while creating them in the next script. I’ll say up front that every function must return a Boolean value, except for the “read” function. That function must always return a string, even if that means an empty string.  For an understanding of when the different functions are called  from the perspective of what you’d do in the PHP code , see Figure 3.4.        e s a b a t a D a n i   s n o i s s e S g n i r o t S     84  Figure 3.4 Every time a session is started, the “open” and “read” functions are called. When the “read” function is called, garbage collection may take place  depending upon various factors . At the end of a script, the data is written, and then the “close” function is called, unless the session was destroyed, in which case the “write” function is not invoked.  Table 3.2 The session_set_save_handler   function takes six arguments. Each should be the name of a function that is called when a particular event occurs.  session_set_save_handler   Arguments  O r d e r 1 2 3 4 5 6  Fu n c t i o n   t o   B e   C a l l e d   Wh e n … A session is started A session is closed Session data is read Session data is written Session data is destroyed Old session data should be deleted  aka garbage collection performed    Advanced Database Concepts  To create new session handlers: 1.

This function closes the database connection. function close_session   {  global $sdbc;  return mysqli_close $sdbc ;  }    End of close_session   function.     Define the read_session   function:    This function takes one argument: the session ID.    This function retrieves the session data. function read_session $sid  {  global $sdbc;  list $data  = mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ;  $sid  ;   $r = mysqli_query $sdbc, $q ;     Retrieve the results: if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {     Return the data: return $data;  } else {    Return an empty string.  return '';  }  }    End of read_session   function.     Define the write_session   function:    This function takes two arguments:     the session ID and the session data. function write_session $sid, $data  {  global $sdbc;  28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47  48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72  73 74  86        e s a b a t a D a n i   s n o i s s e S g n i r o t S        Store in the database: $q = sprintf 'REPLACE INTO sessions  id, data  VALUES  "%s", "%s" ',  mysqli_real_escape_string $sdbc, $sid , mysqli_real_escape_string $sdbc, $data  ;   $r = mysqli_query $sdbc, $q ;   script continues on next page    Advanced Database Concepts     Delete from the database: $q = sprintf 'DELETE FROM sessions WHERE id="%s"', mysqli_real_escape_string $sdbc, $sid  ;  $r = mysqli_query $sdbc, $q ;  Script 3.1 continued  return mysqli_affected_rows $sdbc ;  }    End of write_session   function.

Define the function for opening a session.  function open_session   {  global $sdbc; $sdbc = mysqli_connect ➝  ‘localhost’, ‘username’, ➝ ‘password’, ‘test’  OR die  ‘Cannot ➝ connect to the database.’ ;  return true;  } This function takes no arguments  which is to say that when PHP does whatever to open a session, it will call this function without sending any values to it . The intent of this function is to establish a database connection.  3. Define the function for closing a session.  function close_session   {  global $sdbc; return mysqli_close $sdbc ;  } This function also takes no arguments.  It will close the database connection, returning the success of that operation. 4. Define the function for reading the ses-  sion data. function read_session $sid  {  global $sdbc; $q = sprintf ‘SELECT data FROM  ➝ sessions WHERE id=”%s”’, ➝ mysqli_real_escape_string $sdbc, ➝ $sid  ;  $r = mysqli_query $sdbc, $q ; if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  ➝ mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ;  list $data  =  return $data;  } else {  return ‘’;  }  }  88        e s a b a t a D a n i   s n o i s s e S g n i r o t S     This function will receive one  argument: the session ID  e.g., ei26b4i2nup742ucho9glmbh84 . The  function needs to retrieve the data for that session ID from the database and return it. If it can’t do that, it should return an empty string instead. Although the session ID should be safe to use in a URL, one shouldn’t make assumptions when it comes to security, so the mysqli_ real_escape_string   function is used to make it safe  alternatively, you could use prepared statements . If you’re not familiar with the sprintf   function, which I use to compile the query, see Chapter 1, “Advanced PHP Techniques.”  5. Define the function for writing data to  the database. function write_session $sid, $data  {  global $sdbc; $q = sprintf ‘REPLACE INTO  ➝ sessions  id, data  VALUES  “%s”, ➝ “%s” ’, mysqli_real_escape_string $sdbc, ➝ $sid , mysqli_real_escape_ ➝ string $sdbc, $data  ;  $r = mysqli_query $sdbc, $q ; return mysqli_affected_  ➝ rows $sdbc ; } This function receives two arguments: the session ID and the session data. The session data is a serialized version of the $_SESSION array  Figure 3.5 . For the query, an INSERT must be run the first time the session record is created in the database and an UPDATE query every time thereafter. The lesser-known REPLACE query will achieve the same result. If a record exists whose primary key is the same as that given a value in this query  i.e., the session ID , an update will occur. Otherwise, a new record will be made.   6. Create the function for destroying the  session data. function destroy_session $sid  {  global $sdbc; $q = sprintf ‘DELETE FROM  ➝ sessions WHERE id=”%s”’, ➝ mysqli_real_escape_string $sdbc, ➝ $sid  ;  $r = mysqli_query $sdbc, $q ; $_SESSION = array  ; return mysqli_affected_  ➝ rows $sdbc ; } This function receives one argument, the session ID, when called. Normally this occurs when the session_destroy   function is invoked. This function then runs a DELETE query in the database and clears the $_SESSION array.  7. Define the garbage collection function.  function clean_session $expire  {  global $sdbc; $q = sprintf ‘DELETE FROM  ➝ sessions WHERE DATE_ADD last_ ➝ accessed, INTERVAL %d SECOND  < ➝ NOW  ’,  int  $expire ;  $r = mysqli_query $sdbc, $q ; return mysqli_affected_  ➝ rows $sdbc ; }  Advanced Database Concepts  Garbage collection is something most PHP programmers do not think about. The premise is that PHP will automati- cally delete old sessions. There are two relevant settings in PHP: what is consid- ered to be “old” and how likely it is that garbage collection is performed. For all session activity in a site, there is an X percent chance that PHP will go into garbage collection mode  the exact per- cent is a PHP setting; the default value is 1% . If it does, then all “old” session data will be destroyed. So garbage collection is triggered by any session but attempts to clean up every session. As for the garbage collection function,  it will receive a time, in seconds, as to what is considered to be old. This can be used in a DELETE query to get rid of any session that hasn’t been accessed in more than the set time.  8. Tell PHP to use the session handling  functions. session_set_save_handler ‘open_ ➝ session’, ‘close_session’, ➝ ‘read_session’, ‘write_session’, ➝ ‘destroy_session’, ➝ ‘clean_session’ ;  continues on next page  Figure 3.5 Session data is stored in the database  or in a file  as a serialized array. This serialized value says that indexed at blah is a string six characters long with a value of umlaut. Indexed at this is a decimal with a value of 3615684.4500  and so on . Indexed at that is a string four characters long with a value of blue.  89     S t o r i n g S e s s i o n s   i n a D a t a b a s e         Chapter 3  9. Start the session. session_start  ; Two important things to note here. First, the session_set_save_handler   function does not start a session. You still have to invoke session_start  . Second, you must use these two lines in this order. Calling session_start   prior to session_set_save_handler   will result in your handlers being ignored.  10. Complete the page.  ?>  11. Save the file as db_sessions.inc.php and  place it in your Web directory.  ✔ Tips    The “write” session function is never called until all of the output has been sent to the Web browser. Then the “close” function is called. See Figure 3.4.    If session.auto_start is turned on in your PHP configuration  meaning that sessions are automatically started for each page , then you cannot use the session_set_save_handler   function.        e s a b a t a D a n i   s n o i s s e S g n i r o t S     90   Advanced Database Concepts  Using the new session handlers Using the newly created session handlers  is only a matter of invoking the function session_set_save_handler   function, as discussed in the preceding section of the chapter. Everything else you would do with sessions is unchanged, from storing data in them to accessing stored data to destroying a session.  To demonstrate this, the next script will create some session data if it doesn’t exist, show all the session data, and even destroy the session data if a link back to this same page is clicked. As is often the case, there is one little tricky issue…  All of the session activity requires the data- base and, therefore, the database connec- tion. The connection is opened when the session is started and closed when the ses- sion is closed. No problem there except that the “write” and “close” functions will be called after a script has finished running  see Figure 3.4 . As you may already know, PHP does you the favor of automatically closing any database connections when a script stops running. For this next script, this means that after the script runs, the database connection is automatically closed, and then the session functions attempt to write the data to the database and close the connection. The result will be some confus- ing errors  and the—trust me on this—long “Where in the World Is My Database Connection?” search . To avoid this sequen- tial problem, the session_write_close   function should be called before the script terminates. This function will invoke the “write” and “close” functions, while there’s still a good database connection.     S t o r i n g S e s s i o n s   i n a D a t a b a s e        91   Chapter 3  To use the new session handlers: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text   editor or IDE  Script 3.2 . <?php  Script 3.2 - sessions.php  Script 3.2 This script includes the db_sessions.inc.php page  Script 3.1  so that session data is stored in a database. In order to have one page create a new session, access existing data, and close the session, a couple of conditionals are used in lieu of writing out multiple pages.  <?php  Script 3.2 - sessions.php  This page does some silly things with sessions. It includes the db_sessions.inc.php script so that the session data will be stored in  a database.   * * * * *      Include the sessions file:    The file already starts the session. require_once 'db_sessions.inc.php' ; ?><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">          DB Session Test       <?php  }  }     Store some dummy data in the session,    if no data is present. if  empty $_SESSION   {  $_SESSION['blah'] = 'umlaut'; $_SESSION['this'] = 3615684.45; $_SESSION['that'] = 'blue';     Print a message indicating what's going on: echo ' Session data stored.

';  } else {    Print the "Log Out" link:  echo ' Log Out ';     Print out the session data: echo ' Session Data: ' . print_r $_SESSION, 1  .

Include the db_sessions.inc.php file.  require_once ‘db_sessions.inc.php’ ; ?> The session_start   function, which is in db_sessions.inc.php, must be called before anything is sent to the Web browser, so this file must be included prior to any HTML.  3. Create the initial HTML.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” ➝ “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org  ➝ 1999 xhtml” xml:lang=”en” ➝ lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   DB Session Test        4. Store some dummy data in a session if it  is empty. <?php if  empty $_SESSION   {  $_SESSION[‘blah’] = ‘umlaut’; $_SESSION[‘this’] = 3615684.45; $_SESSION[‘that’] = ‘blue’; echo ‘ Session data  ➝ stored. ’; } else {  echo ‘ Session Data ➝ Exists: ’ . print_r ➝  $_SESSION, 1  . ‘  ’; }  Advanced Database Concepts  Storing data in a database-managed ses- sion is no different than the regular method. This conditional is being used to replicate sessions on multiple pages. The first time the page is loaded, new data will be stored in the session. The second time the page is loaded, the exist- ing data will be available. As a quick way to print the session data, the print_r   function will be used.  5. Create the logout functionality. if  isset $_GET[‘logout’]   {  session_destroy  ; echo ‘ Session  ➝ destroyed. ’; } else {  echo ‘<a href=”sessions.php?  ➝ logout=true”>Log Out ’; } Again, this conditional is used to fake a multipage site. When the page is accessed, a “Log Out” link is displayed. If the user clicks that link, ?logout=true is passed in the URL, telling this same page to destroy the session. 6. Print the session data.  echo ‘ Session Data: ’ . ➝ print_r $_SESSION, 1  . ➝ ‘  ’; This is mostly a repeat of the code in Step 4. Unlike that line, this one will apply the first time the page is loaded. It will also be used to reveal the effect of destroying the session.  7. Complete the PHP and HTML.  ?>      continues on next page  93     S t o r i n g S e s s i o n s   i n a D a t a b a s e         Chapter 3  8. Call the session_write_close   function.    It really doesn’t matter where in the script this function is called, as long as all the modifications to the session data are over. If you don’t use this function, you might see results like those in Figure 3.6.  Figure 3.6 Because PHP is nice enough to close open database connections after a script runs, the write_session   and close_session   functions— called after that point—would be without a database connection.        e s a b a t a D a n i   s n o i s s e S g n i r o t S     94   Advanced Database Concepts  9. Save the file as sessions.php, place it in  your Web directory  in the same folder as db_sessions.inc.php , and test in your Web browser  Figures 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 .  ✔ Tips    The session_write_close   function is  also necessary if your site uses frames. By calling it, you can close one page’s access to a session so that the other page can load faster  because only one script can access the same session at a time .    You should also call session_write_  close   before redirecting the browser with a header   call. This only applies when using your own session handlers.

Chapter 3  Working with U.S.  Zip Codes One common need for Web sites is to be able to perform distance calculations between addresses. Although you can always go the full Mapquest or Google Maps route, simple distance estimates can be managed using just zip codes  in the United States, that is .  For every zip code, there is an associated longitude and latitude. Take two of these points on the earth, throw in some compli- cated math, and you have an approximate distance. In this section, I’ll discuss how to obtain the necessary zip code data, create a “stores” table that will provide one of the two points, and then go over the formula used to calculate distances.  Creating the zip code table This whole example is predicated upon hav- ing a database with the latitude and longi- tude points for every zip code in the United States. You’ll find three sources for this information:  ◆ Commercial zip code databases  ◆ Free zip code databases  ◆ Free ZCTA databases  The first option will provide you with the most accurate, up-to-date information,  but you’ll have to pay for it  not a terrible amount, normally . The second option is free  free!  but harder to find and likely to  be out of date. At the time of this writing, the Web site www.cfdynamics.com zipbase  provides this information, although there’s no guarantee how long that will last. You can also search the Web for “free zip code database” to find alternatives.  As for the last option, ZCTA, the Zip Code Tabulation Areas, is a database created by the U.S. Census Bureau for its own purposes. This database ignores around 10,000 zip codes that are used by the U.S. Post Office or by specific corporations. It also groups some zip codes together and uses characters to represent others. For the vast majority of zip codes, this information will do just fine. Once source of a ZCTA database is http:  zips.sourceforge.net, found by searching SourceForge.net for “zip code”.  s e d o C p i Z   .           .  S U h t i w g n i k r o W  96   Figure 3.10 Creating a new database to be used in this example.  Figure 3.11 The main table, whose structure is based upon the data to be inserted  Figure 3.12 .  3. Create a table that matches the data in  Advanced Database Concepts  To create the zip code database: 1. Find your data source.  Which source  of the types and specific ones outlined  you use depends upon your situation. How important is accuracy? How much are you willing to spend? As a secondary consideration, what resources exist as you’re reading this  search the Web and SourceForge ? I’ll use the version from www.cfdynamics.com zipbase  for my example.  2. Create the database  Figure 3.10 .  CREATE DATABASE zips; I’m creating a database called zips, in MySQL, using the mysql command-line client. You could do most of the follow- ing using phpMyAdmin, the MySQL Administrator, or another tool.  the data file  Figure 3.11 . CREATE TABLE zip_codes   zip_code INT 5  UNSIGNED ZEROFILL NOT ➝ NULL, latitude DOUBLE 8,6 , longitude DOUBLE 8,6 , city VARCHAR 60  NOT NULL, state CHAR 2  NOT NULL, county VARCHAR 60  NOT NULL, zip_class VARCHAR 12  NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY  zip_code   ;  continues on next page  W o r k i n g w i t h U S  .           .   Z i p C o d e s  97   Figure 3.12 The data file I’m working with.  Figure 3.13 Importing the data into the table.  Chapter 3  Some sources may already provide the necessary SQL commands to create the table and even insert the data, in which case you could skip Steps 3 and 4. If not, you should create a table whose struc- ture matches the data to be inserted. Figure 3.12 shows the file that I down- loaded. The zip code column, which is the primary key, should be an unsigned, zero-filled integer five digits in length. The latitude and longitude columns should be some type of floating-point number. Because, in my case, some of the records have no values for the latitude and longitude, these two columns can’t be defined as NOT NULL. My data contains four more columns: the city’s name, a two-character state abbreviation, the county, and the “zip code class.” 4. Import the data  Figure 3.13 .  LOAD DATA INFILE ‘ tmp ZIP_CODES.txt’ INTO TABLE zip_codes FIELDS TERMINATED BY ‘,’ ENCLOSED BY ‘“‘ LINES TERMINATED BY ‘\r\n’; It may take you a while to get this step working properly  you may also have more luck using phpMyAdmin for this . The LOAD DATA INFILE query takes the contents of a text file and inserts them into the given table. For this step to work, the number of columns in the table must match the number of values on each row in the text file. You might also need to change the FIELDS TERMINATED BY, ENCLOSED BY, and LINES TERMINATED BY values to match the text file you have. See the MySQL manual for more infor- mation on this syntax. The name of the text file should match the absolute path to the file on your computer.  98  s e d o C p i Z   .           .

Add indexes and update the data, if   necessary. One additional step I took was to turn empty latitude and longitude values into formal NULL values. That query is: UPDATE zip_codes SET latitude=NULL, ➝ longitude=NULL WHERE latitude=’’; 7. Check the information for your  or any   zip code  Figure 3.15 .

Z i p C o d e s  99   Chapter 3  Creating the stores table After creating the zip code table, it’s time  to create the other required table. For this example, I’ll want to be able to calculate the distance between a given zip code  like a user’s home address  and a list of stores. Therefore, a stores table is necessary.  This table can contain whatever information you want. Likely, it would be something like Table 3.3.  Since the city and state are tied to the zip code, and that information is already in  the zip_codes table, those columns can be removed. I’ll also make the Address 2 column have a NULL option, as not all stores will use this field. To create the stores table: 1. Access the zips database using the mysql  client or another interface.  2. Create the stores table  Figure 3.16 .  CREATE TABLE stores   store_id SMALLINT 5  UNSIGNED NOT ➝ NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR 60  NOT NULL, address1 VARCHAR 100  NOT NULL, address2 VARCHAR 100  default NULL, zip_code INT 5  UNSIGNED ZEROFILL NOT ➝ NULL, phone VARCHAR 15  NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY  store_id , KEY  zip_code   ; The table models the data suggested in Table 3.3, except for the omission of the city and state  which are present in the zip_codes table . The zip_code column here should be defined exactly like that in the zip_codes table because the two fields will be used in a join  see the side- bar “Optimizing Joins,” on page 102 .  100  s e d o C p i Z   .           .

Select the complete address for a couple  of stores  Figure 3.18 . SELECT stores.*, zip_codes.city, ➝ zip_codes.state FROM stores LEFT JOIN zip_codes USING ➝  zip_code  LIMIT 2\G To get a store’s complete address, includ- ing the city and state, a join must be made across the two tables, using the zip_code column, which is common to both. If you’re not familiar with it, using the \G closing character in the mysql client just returns the results in vertical groupings, not horizontal rows.  Figure 3.18 By performing a join on the two tables, a store’s complete address can be fetched.  s e d o C p i Z   .           .  S U h t i w g n i k r o W  102  Optimizing Joins  The MySQL database does a lot of work to improve efficiency, often unbeknownst to the common user. This may involve changing the definition of a column or secretly altering how a query is run. But sometimes MySQL needs a little help.  Joins are expensive queries  in terms of database resources  because they require conditional matches to be made across two or more tables. In this example, a join will occur between the zip_codes and stores tables, using the zip_code column from both. To encourage MySQL to perform these joins faster, you should do two things.  First, an index should exist on both columns. Second, both columns should be defined in exactly the same way. If one column is a TINYINT and the other is an INT, MySQL will not use any indexes  which is bad .   Figure 3.19 To check the distance between two points, I select the information for two random zip codes.  Figure 3.20 The result of the distance calculation, using the latitudes and longitudes from Figure 3.19.  Advanced Database Concepts  Performing distance calculations Now that two tables exist and are populated with data, it’s time to perform the distance calculations. In PHP, the formula for doing so is: $distance = sin deg2rad $a_latitude   * sin deg2rad $b_latitude   + cos deg2rad $a_latitude   * cos deg2rad $b_latitude   * cos deg2rad $a_longitude - $b_longitude  ; $distance =  rad2deg acos $distance    * ➝ 69.09;  I could explain that formula in detail, except I don’t really understand it  or, in truth, haven’t tried to . All I know is that this works, and sometimes that’s enough.  In MySQL, that same formula  requiring a couple of different functions  is: SELECT  DEGREES ACOS SIN RADIANS lat_a   * SIN RADIANS lat_b   + COS RADIANS lat_a   * COS RADIANS lat_b   * COS RADIANS long_a - long_b      * ➝ 69.09  For example, taking the latitude and longi- tude for two random zip codes  Figure 3.19 , this calculation returns a value of approxi- mately 1,170 miles  Figure 3.20 . SELECT  DEGREES ACOS ➝  SIN RADIANS 40.347017   * SIN RADIANS 29.362879   + COS RADIANS 40.347017   * COS RADIANS 29.362879   * COS RADIANS -79.500729 - - 95.276050      * 69.09 AS distance;  To finally put all of this good knowledge into action, I’ll create a PHP script that returns the three closest stores to a given zip code.  103  W o r k i n g w i t h U S  .           .

Identify the point of origin.  $zip = 64154; echo “ Nearest stores to ➝ $zip: \n”; This value could also be taken from a form  after validating it, of course .  3. Connect to the database.  $dbc = @mysqli_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’, ‘zips’  OR ➝ die  ‘ Cannot ➝ connect to the database.  ➝  ’ ;  4. Define and execute the query.  $q = “SELECT latitude, longitude FROM ➝ zip_codes WHERE zip_code=’$zip’ AND ➝ latitude IS NOT NULL”; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; This first query—the script contains two—both validates the zip code  that it’s an actual U.S. zip code  and retrieves that zip code’s latitude and longitude. That information will be necessary for calculating distances between the given zip code and each store. Because the data I used lacks the latitude and longi- tude for some zip codes, I’ve added an AND latitude IS NOT NULL condition to the WHERE clause. This may not be neces- sary for all data sets.  5. Retrieve the results of the query.  if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  list $lat, $long  =  ➝ mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ; If one row was returned, the zip code is valid and the returned data is assigned to these two variables.  s e d o C p i Z   .           .

As you can see in Figure 3.21, this query returns a store’s name, full address, phone number, and distance from the given zip code. The two addresses lines are concatenated using CONCAT_WS  , which will place a   between the lines if address2 has a value, but return just address1 otherwise. The store’s city and state values come from the zip_codes table, and the zip_code could come from either. The phone number is also returned. The big, complex calculation is also selected. For the “A” latitude and longi- tude, the values for the original zip code are used  already retrieved by the earlier query . For the “B” latitude and longitude, values from this query will be used. Only three stores are going to be returned, and they are ordered by the distance value, from smallest to largest. Whew!  continues on next page  W o r k i n g w i t h U S  .           .

Chapter 3  Creating Stored Functions Stored functions are half of a larger concept called stored routines  the other half are stored procedures . Present in many data- base applications but new to MySQL as of version 5, stored routines allow you to save a set sequence of code in the MySQL server, and then call that sequence as needed. Think of it like being able to write your own PHP functions but in SQL.  The topic of stored routines can be expan- sive, but I want to give you a little taste here. For more information, see the MySQL man- ual or my MySQL: Visual QuickStart Guide  Peachpit Press, 2006 , where I dedicate many more pages to the subject. Before you follow this example, make sure that you have at least version 5 of MySQL  or are using a database application that supports them, like PostgreSQL .  The basic syntax for creating stored func- tions is: CREATE FUNCTION name  arguments  RETURNS ➝ type code  For the routine’s name, you should not use an existing keyword, SQL term, or function name. As with most things you name in MySQL, you should stick to alphanumeric characters and the underscore.  The arguments section is used to pass val- ues to the routine. The listed arguments are named and given types that correspond to the available data types in MySQL: CREATE FUNCTION myfunc  myvar1 INT, ➝ myvar2 CHAR  RETURNS type code     s n o i t c n u F d e r o t S g n i t a e r C     110  Declaring Local Variables  Stored routines are like small programs, and they can even have their own vari- ables. To do so, use the DECLARE statement: DECLARE var_name var_type  The naming rules are pretty much the same as for everything else, but you absolutely want to make sure that your variables have unique identifiers. The types correspond to the MySQL data types: DECLARE var1 INT DECLARE var2 DECIMAL 5,2  DECLARE var3 VARCHAR 20   The only restrictions to declaring vari- ables are:  ◆ The declarations must take place within a BEGIN…END code block.  ◆ The declarations must take place  before any other statements  i.e., dec- larations must be immediately after the BEGIN .  Once you’ve declared a variable, you can assign it a value using SET: SET name = value  Note, as well, that unlike variables in PHP, these stored routine variables do not begin with a dollar sign.   Figure 3.26 You have to be careful when attempting to create stored routines within the mysql client.  Advanced Database Concepts  The code section of this syntax is the most important. As your routines will normally contain multiple lines, you’ll want to create a block by using BEGIN and END: CREATE FUNCTION name  arguments  RETURNS ➝ type BEGIN  statement1; statement2;  END  Within the code block, each statement ends with a semicolon. This can cause a problem: when you go to add this stored function using the mysql client, it will think that the semicolon indicates the end of a command to be executed immediately  Figure 3.26 . To prevent this, one solution is to change the delimiter  the semicolon  to something else. Another option is to use the MySQL Administrator, instructions for which you’ll soon see.  Stored functions must contain a RETURNS clause, indicating the type of value returned by the function. Functions return scalar  single  values, like a number or a string.  To do so, use RETURNS data  within the function’s code body. The type of the data returned must match the type indi- cated in the function’s initial definition line. You cannot return a list of values from a stored function, but because stored func- tions return scalar values, they can be used in queries like any of the existing MySQL functions.  All of this information, along with the blip in the accompanying sidebar “Declaring Local Variables,” is the five-minute guide to stored functions. In the next sequence of steps, I’ll show you how to turn the complicated dis- tance calculation formula  see Script 3.3  into a callable stored function.  111     C r e a t i n g S t o r e d F u n c t i o n s      Chapter 3  To create a stored function: 1. Download and install the MySQL  Administrator. This free tool is part of MySQL’s GUI Tools package, a wonderful suite of appli- cations. Versions are available for most operating systems  Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux  and you can compile your own version if necessary.  2. Start the application.  Windows users can use the Start menu shortcut. Mac users can double-click the application itself.  3. At the first prompt  Figure 3.27 , enter  the correct username, hostname, and password combination. To administer MySQL running on the same computer, you’ll likely want to enter localhost as the host. You’ll then want to use either root or another admin- istrative account, and the correct pass- word for that user. These values corre- spond to the users and permissions established within the MySQL server. 4. Click OK or Connect, depending upon your version of the application, to take you into the application. Assuming that you used a valid adminis- trative username hostname password combination, this will connect to the MySQL server. Figure 3.28 shows the result on Windows; Figure 3.29 is the Mac OS X view.     s n o i t c n u F d e r o t S g n i t a e r C     112  Figure 3.27 The MySQL Administrator connection prompt, where you enter the access information for the database server with which you will interact.  Figure 3.28 MySQL Administrator on Windows, just after logging in.  Figure 3.29 MySQL Administrator on Mac OS X.   Figure 3.30 The view of the zips database.  Figure 3.31 The next step on Windows is to click Stored procedures.  Figure 3.32 At this prompt, click Create FUNCTION.  Advanced Database Concepts  5. Click Catalogs.  The Catalogs section is where you can look at and edit your databases. 6. Click on the zips database in the Schemata column  Figure 3.30 . Not sure why they don’t just say Databases instead of Schemata  or Catalogs , but…  7. Find the stored function editor.  How the MySQL Administrator behaves on the different operating systems is stunningly varied. On Windows, you would: 1. Click Stored procedures  Figure 3.31 . 2. Click Create Stored Proc. 3. Click Create FUNCTION at the next  prompt  Figure 3.32 .  continues on next page     C r e a t i n g S t o r e d F u n c t i o n s     113   Figure 3.33 In the Catalogs pane on Mac OS X, click Functions.  Figure 3.34 Using the SQL Editor  on Windows  to enter the stored function.  Chapter 3  On Mac OS X, you would: 1. Click Functions  Figure 3.33 . 2. Click Create Function.  8. In the resulting window, enter    Figure 3.34 : CREATE FUNCTION zips.return_ ➝ distance  lat_a DOUBLE, long_ ➝ a DOUBLE, lat_b DOUBLE, long_b DOUBLE  ➝ RETURNS DOUBLE BEGIN  DECLARE distance DOUBLE; SET distance =  ➝ SIN RADIANS lat_a   *  ➝ SIN RADIANS lat_b   + COS RADIANS lat_a   * COS RADIANS lat_b   * COS RADIANS long_a - long_b  ;  RETURN  DEGREES ACOS distance     ➝ * 69.09 ; END This code wraps the complicated calcu- lation within a stored function. The function is called return_distance. The databasename.functionname syntax associates the function with a specific database  here, zips . The function takes four arguments, all of type DOUBLE. It will return a DOUBLE value as well. The first step in the function is to create a variable of type DOUBLE. Doing so will simplify the calculation to a degree   pardon the pun . The variable is assigned the value of most of the calculation. This variable is then run through a couple more functions and some arithmetic, then returned.  9. Click OK  Mac OS X  or Execute SQL   Windows .  114     s n o i t c n u F d e r o t S g n i t a e r C      Figure 3.35 The stored function is used to simplify the SQL query.  Advanced Database Concepts  10. Test the function by running the  following query in the mysql client  Figure 3.35 : SELECT return_distance 40.347017, - ➝ 79.500729, 29.362879,  ➝ --95.276050 ; This is the same query run in Figure 3.20, except now it calls the stored function.  11. If you want, modify distance.php   Script 3.3  to call the stored procedure. To do so, just change the main query to SELECT name, CONCAT_WS ‘ ’, ➝ address1, address2 , city, ➝ state, stores.zip_code, phone, ➝ ROUND return_distance $lat, ➝ $long, latitude, longitude   AS ➝ distance FROM stores LEFT JOIN ➝ zip_codes USING  zip_code  ORDER ➝ BY distance ASC LIMIT 3  ✔ Tips    All stored routines are associated with a  specific database. This has the added benefit of not needing to select the data- base  USE databasename  when invoking them. This also means that you cannot have a stored routine select a database.    Because stored routines are linked with  databases, if you drop the database, you’ll also drop any associated stored routine.     C r e a t i n g S t o r e d F u n c t i o n s     115   Chapter 3  Displaying Results Horizontally Another of the common questions I see involves displaying query results horizontal- ly. It’s quite easy to fetch the results and dis- play them vertically  Figure 3.36 , but cre- ating an output like that in Figure 3.37 does stymie some programmers. The code in Figure 3.37 uses an HTML table to create this output, with five records per row.  To achieve this effect using PHP, a counter is required that tracks how many records have been placed on a row. When zero records have been placed, the new row should be started. When the maximum number of records have been placed, the old row should be concluded. That’s the premise, which I’ll develop in this next script. For the data, I’ll use the zip_codes table in the zips database  but you could use anything .     y l l a t n o z i r o H s t l u s e R g n i y a l p s i D     116  Figure 3.36 A traditional vertical display of some records.

Unless the number of items displayed is easily divisible by the number to be displayed per row  i.e., there’s no remainder of that division , the last row will be incomplete  Figure 3.39 . If $i has a value other than 0, some extra cells must be added  if it has a value of 0, then the last row was com- pleted . A for loop can accomplish this task easily, starting with the current value of $i and stopping when $i equals $items. A little-known trick with the for loop is that each of the three parts is optional. Since no initial expression must be evaluated  like setting $i to some value , the loop begins with  ;.  tional started in Step 3. echo ‘ ’;  } else {  echo ‘ An  ➝ invalid state abbreviation was ➝ used. ’; }  12.

Sadly, most beginning pro- grammers fail to understand the truth about security: there is no such thing as “secure” or “insecure.” The wise programmer knows that the real question is how secure a site is. Once any piece of data is stored in a database, in a text file, or on a Post-it note in your office, its security is compromised. The focus in this chapter is therefore how to make your applications more secure.  This chapter will begin by rehashing the fundamentals of secure PHP programming. These are the basic things that I hope assume you’re already doing. After that a quick example shows ways to validate different kinds of data that might come from an HTML form. The third topic is the new-to-PHP 5 PECL library called Filter. Its usage isn’t very programmer-friendly, but the way it wraps all of the customary data filter- ing and sanitizing methods into one interface makes it worth knowing. After that, two different uses of the PEAR Auth package show an alternative way to implement authorization in your Web applications. The chapter will conclude with coverage of the MCrypt library, demonstrating how to encrypt and decrypt data.  S e c u r i t y T e c h n i     q u e s  123   Chapter 4  Remembering the Basics Before getting into demonstrations of more particular security techniques, I want to take a moment to go over the basics: those fundamental rules that every PHP program- mer should abide by all of the time. To ensure a basic level of security: 1. Do not rely upon register_globals.  The advent of register_globals once made PHP so easy to use, while also making it less secure  convenience often weakens security . The recommendation is to program as if register_globals is off. This is particularly important because register_globals will likely disappear in future versions of PHP.  2. Initialize variables prior to using them. If register_globals is still enabled—even if you aren’t using them—a malicious user could use holes created by nonini- tialized variables to hack your system. For example: if  condition  {  $auth = TRUE;  } If $auth is not preset to FALSE prior  to this code, then a user could easily make themselves authorized by passing $_GET[‘auth’], $_POST[‘auth’], or $_COOKIE[‘auth’] to this script.  3. Verify and purify all incoming data. How you verify and purify the data depends greatly upon the type of data. You’ll see many different techniques in this chapter and the book.        s c i s a B e h t g n i r e b m e m e R  124  Avoiding Mail Abuses  A security concern exists in any Web application that uses the mail   func- tion with form data. For starters, if someone enters their “to” email address as someone@example.com,someone.else @example.com, you’ll now be sending two emails. If a malicious user enters  500 addresses  perhaps by creating their own form that submits to your same page , you’re now sending out spam! You can avoid this by using regular expres- sions to guarantee that the submitted value contains just one address. Or you could search for a comma in the submit- ted email address, which wouldn’t be allowed. But that won’t solve the problem entirely.  Although the mail   function takes sepa- rate arguments for the “to” address, “from” address  or other additional head- ers , subject, and body, all four values are put together to create the actual message. By submitting specifically formatted text through any of these inputs, bad people can still use your form to send their spam. To guard against this, you should watch for newline  \n  and carriage returns  \r  within the submitted data. Either don’t send emails with these val- ues or replace them with spaces to invali- date the intended message format. You should probably also make sure that you  or someone involved with the site  receives a copy of every email sent so that close tabs can be kept on this area of the server.   Security Techniques  8. Watch for HTML  and more important, JavaScript  in submitted data if it will be redisplayed in a Web page. Use the strip_tags   or similar func- tions to clear HTML and potential JavaScript from submitted text.  9. Do not reveal PHP errors on live sites. One of the most common ways to hack a site is to try to “break” it—do some- thing unexpected to cause errors—in the hopes that the errors reveal impor- tant behind-the-scenes information.  10. Nullify the possibility of SQL injection  attacks. Use a language-specific database escap- ing function, like mysqli_real_escape_ data  , to ensure that submitted values will not break your queries.  11. Program with error reporting on its  highest level. While not strictly a security issue, pro- gramming with error reporting on its highest level can often show potential holes in your code.  12. Never keep phpinfo   scripts on the  server. Although vital for developing and debugging PHP applications, phpinfo   scripts reveal too much information and are too easily found if left on a live site.  4. Be careful if you use variables for included  files. If your code does something like require $page ; then you should either make sure that $page does not come from an outside source  like $_GET  or, if it does, that you’ve made certain that it has an  appropriate value. See the technique  in Chapter 2, “Developing Web Applications.”  5. Be extra, extra careful when using any function that runs commands on the server. This includes eval  , exec  , system  , passthru  , popen  , and the backticks  `` . Because each of these runs com- mands on the server itself, they should never be used casually. And if you must use a variable as part of the command to execute, perform any and all security checks on that variable first. Also use the escapeshellarg   and escapeshellcmd   functions as an extra precaution.  6. Consider changing the default session directory or using a database to store session data. An example as to how you would do this is discussed in Chapter 3, “Advanced Database Concepts.”  7. Do not use browser-supplied filenames for storing uploaded files on the server. When you move a file onto your server, rename it to something safe, preferably something not guessable.  R e m e m b e r i n g t h e B a s i c s        125   Chapter 4  Validating Form Data Handling form data is still far and away the most common use of PHP  in this author’s humble opinion, anyway . The security con- cern lies in the fact that the PHP page han- dling the form will do something with the information the user enters: store it in a database, pass it along to another page, or use it in an email. If the information the user enters is tainted, you could have a major problem on your hands. As a rule,  do not trust the user! Mistakes can happen, either on purpose or by accident, that could reveal flaws in your code, cause the loss of data, or bring your entire system to a crash- ing halt.  Some good validation techniques are:  ◆ Use the checkdate   function to confirm  that a given date is valid.  ◆ Typecast numbers.  ◆ Use regular expressions to check email addresses, URLs, and other items with definable patterns  see the sidebar .        a t a D m r o F g n i t a d i l a V  126  When to Use Regular  Expressions  I often see what I would call an overuse of regular expressions. You should under- stand that regular expressions require extra processing, so they shouldn’t be used flippantly. Many types of data— comments and addresses being just two examples—really don’t have a definable pattern. A regular expression that allows for any valid comment or address would allow for just about anything. So skip the server-intensive regular expressions in such cases.  As a guide, regular expressions may be the most exacting security measure, but they’re almost definitely the least effi- cient and possibly the most problematic. I’m not suggesting you shouldn’t use them—just make sure they’re really the best option for the data being validated.   Security Techniques  As with the basic security techniques already reviewed, the hope is that as a somewhat- experienced PHP programmer, you already know most of these things. To be certain, this next example will present a sample reg- istration form  Figure 4.1 , taking various types of information, which will then be pre- cisely validated. In doing so, I’ll make use of a couple of Character Type functions, added to PHP in version 4.3. Listed in Table 4.1, these functions test a given value against certain constraints for the current locale  established by the setlocale   function .  V a l i d a t i n g F o r m D a t a        127  Figure 4.1 When users first come to the registration page, this is the form they will see.

Create the section of the script that han-  dles the submitted form. if  isset $_POST[‘submitted’]   {  $errors = array  ;  Your script should always handle the form before it could possibly redisplay it  on errors found . I like to use a hidden form input to check if a form was sub- mitted. The hidden form input will always be passed to the page upon sub- mission, unlike any other input  on Internet Explorer, if a user submits a but- ton by pressing Enter, then the submit button won’t be set . One way I like to validate forms is to use an array that stores the errors as they occur. By checking if this array is empty, the script can tell if all validation tests have been passed. If the array isn’t empty, its values can be used to print the error messages.  3. Check for a name.  if  !isset $_POST[‘name’]  OR ➝ empty $_POST[‘name’]   {  $errors[] = ‘name’;  } A person’s name is one of those things that you can use regular expressions on, but it may not be worthwhile. A valid name can contain letters, spaces, peri- ods, hyphens, and apostrophes. Under most circumstances, just checking for a nonempty name is sufficient.  Security Techniques  4. Validate the submitted email address. if  !eregi ‘^[_a-z0-9-]+ \.[_a-z0- ➝ 9-]+ *@[a-z0-9-]+ \.[a-z0-9-] ➝ + * \.[a-z]{2,4} $’, ➝ $_POST[‘email’]   {  $errors[] = ‘email address’;  } There are any number of patterns you can use to validate an email address, depending on how strict or liberal you want to be. This one is commonly seen. Certainly some invalid email addresses could slip through this expression, but it does add a sufficient level of security. Feel free to use a different pattern if you have one to your liking. Keep in mind that a user could enter a valid e-mail address that does not actually exist. Only some sort of activation process  sending the user an email containing a link back to the Web site  can confirm a real address.  5. Validate the submitted password.  if  !ctype_alnum $_POST[‘pass’]   {  $errors[] = ‘password’;  } The form indicates that the password must contain only letters and numbers. To validate such values, the function ctype_alnum   works perfectly. In a real registration form, I would also recommend confirming the password with a second password input, then mak- ing sure both values match. I’m skipping that step here for brevity’s sake.  continues on next page  V a l i d a t i n g F o r m D a t a        131   6. Begin checking to see if the user entered  8. Complete the date of birth conditionals.  $errors[] = ‘date of  } else {  ➝ birth’;  }  } else {  $errors[] = ‘date of birth’;  } The first else applies if the submitted value cannot be exploded into three parts. The second else applies if the value isn’t of the right length.  9. Validate the ICQ number.  if  !ctype_digit $_POST[‘icq’]   {  $errors[] = ‘ICQ number’;  } The ICQ number can only contain dig- its, so it makes sense to use the ctype_digit   function.  10. Check for some comments.  if  !isset $_POST[‘comments’]  OR ➝ empty $_POST[‘comments’]   {  $errors[] = ‘comments’;  } Comments really cannot be run through a regular expression pattern because any valid pattern would allow just about anything. Instead, a check for some  value is made.  Chapter 4  a valid date of birth. if  isset $_POST[‘dob’]  AND  strlen $_POST[‘dob’]  >= 8  AND  strlen $_POST[‘dob’]  <= 10    {  $dob = explode ‘ ’,  ➝ $_POST[‘dob’] ;  if  count $dob  == 3  {  There is really no way of knowing if the information users enter is in fact their birthday, but PHP’s built-in checkdate   function can confirm whether or not that date existed. Since the form takes the date of birth as a simple string in the format MM DD YYYY, the script must first confirm that something was entered. I also check if the string’s length is at least eight characters long  e.g., 1 1 1900  but no more than ten characters long  e.g., 12 31 2000 . This string is then exploded on the slash- es to theoretically retrieve the month, day, and year values. Next, a conditional checks that exactly three parts were cre- ated by the explosion.  7. Check if the date of birth is a valid date. if  !checkdate  int  $dob[0],  int  ➝ $dob[1],  int  $dob[2]   {  $errors[] = ‘date of birth’;  } The checkdate   function confirms that a date is valid. You might want to also check that a user didn’t enter a date of birth that’s in the future or the too- recent past. Each value is typecast as  an integer as an extra precaution.        a t a D m r o F g n i t a d i l a V  132   Figure 4.2 If all of the data passed through the various checks, this message is displayed.  Figure 4.3 A lot of mistakes were made in this registration attempt, each reported back to the user.  Security Techniques  11. If there were no errors, report upon the  success. if  empty $errors   {  echo ‘ You have successfully  ➝ registered  but not ➝ really .   ’;  exit  ;  If no errors occurred, then $errors would still be empty. The script could then register the user  probably in a database . Here it just prints a message and terminates the script  so that  the form isn’t redisplayed  instead  Figure 4.2 .  12. Report the errors.  } else {  echo ‘ Problems exist with  ➝ the following field s : ’;  foreach  $errors as $error  {  echo  ➝ “ $error \n”;  } echo ‘  ’;  } If $errors isn’t empty, it contains all  of the fields that failed a validation  test. These can be printed in a list  Figure 4.3 .  13.

Create the HTML form.      Registration Form   Name: <input type=”text” ➝ name=”name”  >   Email Address: <input type=”text” ➝ name=”email”  >   Password: <input type=”password” ➝ name=”pass”  >  Letters and  ➝ numbers only.    Date of Birth: <input type=”text” ➝ name=”dob” value=”MM DD YYYY”  > ➝    ICQ Number: <input type=”text” ➝ name=”icq”  >   Comments: <textarea  ➝ name=”comments” rows=”5” ➝ cols=”40”>   <input type=”hidden”  ➝ name=”submitted” value=”true”  > <input type=”submit” name=”submit” ➝ value=”Submit”  >     There’s not much to say about the form except to point out that it does indicate the proper format for the password and date of birth fields. If you are validating data to a specification, it’s important that the end user be made aware of the requirements as well, prior to submit- ting the form.  15. Complete the page.       16. Save the file as register.php, place it  in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser.  134        a t a D m r o F g n i t a d i l a V   Security Techniques  ✔ Tips    If possible, use the POST method in your forms. POST has a limitation in that the resulting page cannot be bookmarked, but it is far more secure and does not have the limit on transmittable data size that GET does. If a user is entering pass- words, you really must use the POST method lest the password be visible.    Placing hidden values in HTML forms can be a great way to pass information from page to page without using cookies or sessions. But be careful what you hide in your HTML code, because those hid- den values can be seen by viewing a page’s source. This technique is a convenience, not a security measure.    Similarly, you should not be too   obvious or reliant upon information  PHP passes via the URL. For example, if a homepage.php page requires receipt of a user ID—and that is the only mandatory information for access to the account— someone else could easily break in  e.g., www.example.com userhome.php?user=2 could quickly be turned into www.example. com userhome.php?user=3, granting access to someone else’s information .  V a l i d a t i n g F o r m D a t a        135  Using Captcha  Popular in many of today’s forms is captcha, short for “completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart”  now that’s an acronym! . A captcha test displays an image with a word or some letters written in it, nor- mally in a nonlinear fashion. In order to successfully complete the form, the text from the image has to be typed into a box. This is something a human user could do but a bot could not.  If you do want to add this feature to your own sites, using the PEAR Text_CAPTCHA package would be the easiest route. Otherwise, you could generate the images yourself using the GD library. The word on the image should be stored in a ses- sion so that it can be compared against what the user typed.  The main caveat with captcha tests is that they do restrict the visually impaired from completing that form. You should be aware of this, and provide alternatives. Personally, I think that bots can be effec- tively stopped by just adding another input to your form, with an easy-to-answer question  like “What is 2 + 2?” . Humans can submit the answer, whereas bots could not.   Chapter 4  Using PECL Filter New in PHP 5 and quite promising is the Filter library of PECL code. Being developed by PHP’s creator and other major contribu- tors, the future of Filter looks bright, even though it’s still in beta form  at the time of this writing . The Filter package provides two types of security:  ◆ Data validation by type  ◆ Data sanitization  What Filter offers is a unified interface for performing common types of validation and sanitization. For example, I might common- ly use code like this: if  isset $_GET[‘id’]   {  if  is_numeric $_GET[‘id’]   {  $id =  int  $_GET[‘id’]; if  $id > 0  {     Do whatever.  }  }  }  I could instead do this: $id = filter_input INPUT_GET, ‘id’, ➝ FILTER_VALIDATE_INT, array ‘options’ ➝ =>array ‘min_range’=>1   ; if  $id  { …  That might look like jabberwocky, but once you get the hang of Filter, the amount of work you can do in just a line of code will be worth the learning curve.  r e t l i F     L C E P g n i s U  136   Security Techniques  To filter individual variables, there are two functions you’ll use: filter_input   and filter_var  . The first one is for working with variables coming from an outside source, like forms, cookies, sessions, and the server. The second is for variables within your own code. I’ll focus on filter_input   here. Its syntax is: $var = filter_input $variable_source, ➝ $variable_name, $filter, $options ;  The sources, which the PHP manual calls “types,” are: INPUT_GET, INPUT_POST, INPUT_COOKIE, INPUT_SERVER, INPUT_ENV, INPUT_SESSION, and INPUT_REQUEST. As you can probably guess, each of these corre- sponds to a global variable  $_GET, $_POST, etc. . For example, if a page receives data in the URL, you’d use INPUT_GET  not $_GET .  The second argument—the variable name— is the specific variable within the source that should be addressed. The $filter argu- ment indicates the filter to apply, using the constants in Table 4.2. This argument is optional, as a default filter will be used if none is specified. Some filters also take options, like the FILTER_VALIDATE_INT in the preceding example  which can take a range .  The filter_input   function will return the filtered variable if the filtration or validation was successful, the Boolean FALSE if the fil- ter didn’t apply to the data, or the value NULL if the named variable didn’t exist in the given input. Thus you have multiple levels  of validation in just one step.  There’s really a lot of information packed into just a few functions here, but I want to present a sample of how you would use the Filter library. To do so, I’ll create a modified version of the registration form  Figure 4.4 . Note that as of PHP 5.2, Filter is built into PHP. If you’re using an earlier version, you may need to install it using the pecl installer  see the PHP manual for more .  137  U s i n g P E C L     F i l t e r  Figure 4.4 This new registration form lacks the password and date of birth inputs.  Table 4.2 These constants represent some of the filters that can be applied to data. For a complete list, see the PHP manual or invoke the filter_list   function.

The FILTER_ SANITIZE_STRING filter will accomplish that. The last argument, FILTER_FLAG_ NO_ENCODE_QUOTES, says that any quota- tion marks in the name  e.g., O’Toole  shouldn’t be turned into an HTML  entity equivalent.  4.

In this script, you could use this code to see if the form has been submitted: if  filter_has_var INPUT_POST, ➝ ‘submitted’   {    To filter an array of variables, use filter_ input_array  . In filter.php, you could just do this: $filters = array  ‘name’ => FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING, ‘email’ => FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL, ‘icq’ => FILTER_VALIDATE_INT, ‘comments’ => array ‘filter’ => ➝ FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING, ‘flags’ => ➝ FILTER_FLAG_NO_ENCODE_QUOTES   ; $data = filter_input_array ➝  INPUT_POST, $filters ; From that point, you could just refer to $data[‘name’], etc.    The filter_var_array   applies a filter, or an array of filters, to an array of data.  r e t l i F     L C E P g n i s U  142   Security Techniques  Authentication with  PEAR Auth One of the more common elements in today’s Web sites is an authentication sys- tem: users register with a site, they log in to gain access to some parts, and restricted pages allow or deny access accordingly. Such systems aren’t hard to implement—I’ve done so in some of my other books—but here I’d like to look at what PEAR has to offer.  The PEAR Auth package provides a really easy, yet customizable authentication sys- tem. To show it off, I’ll start with one very simple example. This will mostly demon- strate its basic usage. Then I’ll show how to customize the authentication system to fit it into a larger application. For both exam- ples, you’ll need to install the PEAR Auth package. Because the authentication infor- mation is stored in a database, the PEAR DB package must also be installed. If you’re not familiar with PEAR and its installation, see Chapter 12, “Using PEAR,” or http:  pear.php.net. ✔ Tip    For these examples I will put both the authentication code and the restricted page data in the same file. In a larger Web site, you’ll likely want to separate the authentication code into its own file, which is then included by any file that requires authentication.     A u t h e n t i c a t i o n w i t h P E A R A u t h        143   Chapter 4  Simple authentication This first, simple authentication example shows how easily you can implement authen- tication in a page. I’ll run through the syntax and concepts first, and then create a script that executes it all.  To begin, require the Auth class: require_once  ‘Auth.php’ ;  Next, you’ll need to define a function that creates a login form. This function will be called when an unauthorized user is trying to access a page. The form should use the POST method and have inputs called user- name and password.  Then, for database-driven authentication, which is the norm, you’ll need to create a “DSN” within an options array. DSN stands for data source name. It’s just a string of information that indicates the type of data- base application being used, the username, password, and hostname to connect as, and the database to select. That code might be: $options = array ‘dsn’ => ➝ ‘mysql:  username:password@localhost  ➝ databasename’ ;  Now that those two things have been defined—the function that makes the login form and the DSN—you can create an object of Auth type. Provide this object three argu- ments: the type of authentication back end to use  e.g., database or file , the options  that correspond to the authentication type , and the name of the login function: $auth = new Auth ‘DB’, $options, ➝ ‘login_form_function_name’ ;        h t u A R A E P h t i w n o i t a c i t n e h t u A     144   Figure 4.8 Creating the database and table required by the simple authentication example.  Security Techniques  The DB option tells Auth to use the PEAR DB package. If you wanted to use a file sys- tem instead, you would use File as the first argument and the name of the file as the second.  Now, start the authentication process: $auth->start  ;  From there, you can check if a user is authenticated by calling the checkAuth   method: if  $auth->checkAuth    {     Do whatever.  And that’s simple authentication in a nut- shell! This next example will implement all this. It will also invoke the addUser   method to add a new authenticated user, which can then be used for logging in. One last note: this example will make use of a database called auth, which must be created prior to writing this script. It should have a table called auth, defined like so: CREATE TABLE auth   username VARCHAR 50  NOT NULL, password VARCHAR 32  NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY  username , KEY  password     Be certain that you’ve created this database and table  Figure 4.8 , and that you have created a MySQL user that has access to them, prior to going any further.     A u t h e n t i c a t i o n w i t h P E A R A u t h        145   Chapter 4  To perform simple authentication: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 4.3 . <?php  Script 4.3 - login.php Because Auth relies on sessions  it’ll start the sessions for you , it’s best to do as much as you can before sending any HTML to the Web browser. So I’ll write most of the authentication code, and only then begin the HTML page.  continues on page 148  Script 4.3 Using PEAR Auth and a MySQL table, this script enforces authentication.  <?php  Script 4.3 - login.php   *  This page uses PEAR Auth to control access. * * * *  This assumes a database called "auth", accessible to a MySQL user of "username@localhost"  with a password of "password".

Include the Auth class.  require_once  ‘Auth.php’ ; If you haven’t installed PEAR Auth yet, do so now. See the PEAR manual for instructions.  3. Define the function that creates the login  form. function show_login_form   { echo ‘<form method=”post” ➝ action=”login.php”>  Username <input type=”text” ➝ name=”username”  >   Password <input type=”password” ➝ name=”password”  >       ‘; } The only requirements are that this form has one input called username and another called password. 4. Create the options array.  $options = array ‘dsn’ => ➝ ‘mysql:  username:password@ ➝ localhost auth’ ; This code says that a connection should be made to a MySQL database called auth, using username as the username, password as the password, and localhost as the host.  5. Create the Auth object.  $auth = new Auth ‘DB’, $options, ➝ ‘show_login_form’ ;        h t u A R A E P h t i w n o i t a c i t n e h t u A     148   Figure 4.9 One user has been added to the table. The password is encrypted using the MD5   function.  Security Techniques  6. Add a new user and complete the PHP  section. $auth->addUser ‘me’, ‘mypass’ ; ?> The addUser   functions takes the user- name as its first argument and the pass- word as the second. This record will be added to the database as soon as the script is first run  Figure 4.9 . Because the username column in the table is defined as a primary key, MySQL will never allow a second user with the name of me to be added. In a real application, you’d have a regis- tration process that would just end up calling this function in the end.  7. Add the initial HTML code.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   Restricted Page        8.

Figure 4.11 The result after successfully logging in.  Implementing Optional  Authentication  If some of your Web site’s pages do not require authentication but could still acknowledge logged-in users, that’s an option with Auth, too. To make authenti- cation optional, add a fourth parameter when creating the Auth object: $auth = new Auth ‘DB’, $options, ➝ ‘show_login_form’, true ;  To limit aspects of a page to authenticat- ed users, invoke the getAuth   method: if  $auth->getAuth    {     Restricted access content.  }   Custom authentication The preceding example does a fine job of showing how easy it is to use PEAR Auth, but it doesn’t demonstrate how you would actually use it in a more full-fledged applica- tion. By this I mean a site that has a table with more than two columns and needs to store, and retrieve, other information as well.  The first change you’ll need to make is to the options array used when creating the Auth object. Different storage types  “con- tainers” in Auth parlance  have different options. Table 4.3 lists some of the other options you can use with DB.  For example, the DB container will use a combination of the usernamecol and pass- wordcol  encrypted using cryptType  to authenticate the user against the submitted values. The preceding example used the defaults, but you can change this informa- tion easily. Just as important, you can speci- fy what other database columns should be retrieved. These will then be available in the session data and can be retrieved in your script through the getAuthData   function: echo $auth->getAuthData ‘column_name’ ;  Table 4.3 These are some of the parameters you can set when creating a new Auth object that uses DB.  DB Container Options  O p t i o n dsn table usernamecol passwordcol db_fields  cryptType  I n d i c at e s The Data Source Name The database table to use The name of the username column The name of the password column What other table fields should be  selected The function used to encrypt the  password  Security Techniques  Three other functions you can use to cus- tomize the authentication are setExpire  , setIdle  , and setSessionName  . The first takes a value, in seconds, when the session should be set to expire. The second takes a value, in seconds, when a user should be considered idle  because it’s been too long since their last activity . The third function changes the name of the session  which is PHPSESSID, by default .  For this next example, a new table will be used, still in the auth database. To create it, use this SQL command  Figure 4.12 : CREATE TABLE users   user_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ AUTO_INCREMENT, email VARCHAR 60  NOT NULL, pass CHAR 40  NOT NULL, first_name VARCHAR  20  NOT NULL, last_name VARCHAR 40  NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY  user_id , UNIQUE  email , KEY  email, pass     This table represents how you might already have some sort of user table, with its own columns, that you’d want to use with Auth.

It selects every column from the table, making all the previously stored data available to the page.  Chapter 4  To use custom authentication: 1.

Next, the table, usernamecol, and pass- wordcol values are all specified. These match the table already created  Figure 4.12 . The cryptType value says that the passwords should be encoded using SHA1  , instead of the default MD5  . The final element in the $options array says that every column from the table should be retrieved. In this particular script, this will allow the page to refer to the logged- in user by name.  154        h t u A R A E P h t i w n o i t a c i t n e h t u A     Figure 4.13 The customized login form.  Creating a Logout Feature  To add a logout to your authentication system, place this code on a logout page: $auth = new Auth ‘DB’, $options, ➝ ‘show_login_form’ ; $auth->start  ; if  $auth->checkAuth    {  $auth->logout  ; $auth->start  ;  }  Just as when using sessions, you need to start the authentication in order to destroy it. You should then confirm that the user is authenticated, using checkAuth  , prior to logging out. Then call the logout   method to de-authenticate the user. Calling the start   method again will redisplay the login form.   4. Add a new user and complete the initial  5. Create the initial HTML code.  PHP section  Figure 4.14 . $auth->addUser ‘me@example.com’, ➝ ‘mypass’, array ‘first_name’ => ➝ ‘Larry’, ‘last_name’ => ‘Ullman’  ; ?> Because the table has more than just the two columns, the extra columns and val- ues have to be provided, as an array, as the third argument to the addUser   method. This call of the function is the equivalent of running this query: INSERT INTO users  email, pass, ➝ first_name, last_name  VALUES ➝  ‘me@example.com’, SHA1 ‘mypass’ , ➝ ‘Larry’, ‘Ullman’   Security Techniques  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   Restricted Page        continues on next page  Figure 4.14 A sample user has been added to the users table.

When the user does log in, they are greeted by name  Figure 4.15 . The getAuthData   func- tion can access the values selected from the table and stored in the authentica- tion session.  8. Complete the page.  ?>      9. Save the file as custom_auth.php, place it  in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser.  ✔ Tips    You can add, on the fly, other data to the  authentication session using setAuthData  : setAuthData $name, $value ;    You can also improve authentication  security via the setAdvancedSecurity   method. It uses both cookies and JavaScript to lessen the possibility of someone hacking an authenticated  session.  156        h t u A R A E P h t i w n o i t a c i t n e h t u A     Figure 4.15 After successfully logging in, the user is greeted by name. The name was pulled from the table and stored in the session.  Using Auth_HTTP  One of the potential problems with  Auth is that it relies upon sessions, which can introduce some security concerns.  A more secure option is to use HTTP authentication via Auth_HTTP. HTTP authentication uses a pop-up window, separate from the HTML page, that takes a username and password.  The benefits of HTTP authentication are these:  ◆ The entered username and password are remembered without needing to send cookies or establish sessions.  ◆ The clean interface will not interfere  with your page design.  The downsides are:  ◆ Inability to create a logout feature  ◆ Inability to establish user groups or  specify access levels  ◆ Inability to set an expiration time   Figure 4.16 Run a phpinfo   script to confirm your server’s support for MCrypt.  Security Techniques  Using MCrypt Frequently Web applications will encrypt and decrypt data stored in a database, using the database-supplied functions. This is appro- priate, as you want the database to do the bulk of the work whenever possible. But what if you want to encrypt and decrypt data that’s not being stored in a database? In that situation, MCrypt is the best solution. To use MCrypt with PHP, you’ll need to install the MCrypt library  libmcrypt, available from http:  mcrypt.sourceforge.net  and configure PHP to support it  Figure 4.16 .  For this example, I’ll show you how to encrypt data stored in a cookie, making it that much more secure. Because the encryp- tion process creates binary data, the base64_encode   function will be applied to the encrypted data prior to storing it in a cookie. Therefore, the base64_decode   func- tion needs to be used prior to decoding the data. Other than that little tidbit, the focus in the next two scripts is entirely on MCrypt.  Do keep in mind that in the next several pages I’ll be introducing and teaching con- cepts to which people have dedicated entire careers. The information covered here will be secure, useful, and valid, but it’s just the tip of the proverbial iceberg.     U s i n g M C r y p t  157   Chapter 4  Encrypting data With MCrypt libraries 2.4.x and higher,  you start by identifying which algorithm  and mode to use by invoking the mcrypt_ module_open   function: $m = mcrypt_module_open  algorithm, ➝ algorithm_directory, mode, ➝ mode_directory ;  MCrypt comes with dozens of different algo- rithms, or ciphers, each of which encrypts data differently. If you are interested in how each works, see the MCrypt home page or search the Web. In my examples, I’ll be using the Rijndael algorithm, also known as the Advanced Encryption Standard  AES . It’s a very popular and secure encryption algo- rithm, even up to United States government standards. I’ll be using it with 256-bit keys, for extra security.  As for the mode, there are four main modes: ECB  electronic codebook , CBC  cipher block chaining , CFB  cipher feedback , and OFB  output feedback . CBC will suit most of your needs, especially when encrypting blocks of text as in this example. So to indi- cate that you want to use Rijndael 256 in CBC mode, you would code: $m = mcrypt_module_open ‘rijndael- ➝ 256’, ‘’, ‘cbc’, ‘’ ;  The second and fourth arguments fed to the mcrypt_module_open   function are for explicitly stating where PHP can find the algorithm and mode files. These are not required unless PHP is unable to find a cipher and you know for certain it is installed.  Once the module is open, you create an IV  initialization vector . This may be required, optional, or unnecessary depending upon the mode being used. I’ll use it with CBC, to increase the security. Here’s how the PHP manual recommends an IV be created: $iv = mcrypt_create_iv ➝  mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size  $m , ➝ MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM ;  By using the mcrypt_enc_get_iv_size   function, a properly sized IV will be created for the cipher being used. Note that on Windows, you should use MCRYPT_RAND instead of MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM, and call the srand   function before this line to ensure the random generation.  The final step before you are ready to encrypt data is to create the buffers that MCrypt needs to perform encryption: mcrypt_generic_init  $m, $key, $iv ;  The second argument is a key, which should be a hard-to-guess string. The key must be of a particular length, corresponding to the cipher you use. The Rijndael cipher I’m using takes a 256-bit key. Divide 256 by 8  because there are 8 bits in a byte and each character in the key string takes one byte  and you’ll see that the key needs to be exactly 32 char- acters long. To accomplish that, and to ran- domize the key even more, I’ll run it through MD5  , which always returns a 32-character string: $key = MD5 ‘some string’ ;  Once you have gone through these steps, you are ready to encrypt data: $encrypted_data = mcrypt_generic  $m, ➝ $data ;  t p y r C M g n i s U     158   Security Techniques  Finally, after you have finished encrypting everything, you should close all the buffers and modules: mcrypt_generic_denit  $m ; mcrypt_module_close $m ;  For this example, I’m going to create a cook- ie whose value is encrypted. The cookie data will be decrypted in the next example. The key and data to be encrypted will be hard- coded into this script, but I’ll mention alter- natives in the following steps. Also, because the same key and IV are needed to decrypt the data, the IV will also be sent in a cookie. Surprisingly, doing so doesn’t hurt the secu- rity of the application.     U s i n g M C r y p t  159   Chapter 4  To encrypt data: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 4.5 . <?php  Script 4.5 - ➝ set_mcrypt_cookie.php Because the script will send two cookies, most of the PHP code will come before any HTML.  2. Define the key and the data.  $key = md5 ‘77 public drop-shadow ➝ Java’ ; $data = ‘rosebud’; For the key, some random words and numbers are run through the MD5   func- tion, creating a 32-character-long string. Ideally, the key should be stored in a safe place, such as a configuration file located outside of the Web document root. Or it could be retrieved from a database. The data being encrypted is the word rosebud, although in real applications this data might come from the database or another source  and be something more worth protecting .  3. Open the cipher.  $m = mcrypt_module_open ‘rijndael- ➝ 256’, ‘’, ‘cbc’, ‘’ ; This is the same code outlined in the text before these steps.  continues on page 162  t p y r C M g n i s U     160   Script 4.5 This script uses MCrypt to encrypt some data to be stored in a cookie.

Encrypt the data.  $data = mcrypt_generic $m, $data ; If you were to print the value of  $data now, you’d see something like Figure 4.17.  7.

Send the two cookies. setcookie ‘thing1’, ➝ base64_encode $data  ; setcookie ‘thing2’, ➝ base64_encode $iv  ; For the cookie names, I’m using mean- ingless values. You certainly wouldn’t want to use, say, IV, as a cookie name! For the cookie data itself, you have to run it through base64_encode   to make it safe to store in a cookie. This applies to both the encrypted data and the IV  which is also in binary format . If the data were going to be stored in a binary file or in a database  in a BLOB col- umn , you wouldn’t need to use base64_encode  .  162  t p y r C M g n i s U      Figure 4.18 The result of running the page.

I’ve used it here regardless, but it’s the kind of issue that legitimate cryptographers think about.  163     U s i n g M C r y p t   Chapter 4  Decrypting data When it’s time to decrypt encrypted data, most of the process is the same as it is for encryption. To start: $m = mcrypt_module_open ‘rijndael- ➝ 256’, ‘’, ‘cbc’, ‘’ ; mcrypt_generic_init $m, $key, $iv ;  At this point, instead of using mcrypt_ generic  , you’ll use mdecrypt_generic  : $data = mdecrypt_generic $m, ➝ $encrypted_data ;  Note, and this is very important, that to suc- cessfully decrypt the data, you’ll need the exact same key and IV used to encrypt it.  Once decryption has taken place, you can close up your resources: mcrypt_generic_deinit $m ; mcrypt_module_close $m ;  Finally, you’ll likely want to apply the rtrim   function to the decrypted data, as the encryption process may add white space as padding to the end of the data.  To decrypt data: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE, starting with the HTML  Script 4.6 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   A More Secure  ➝ Cookie      <?php  Script 4.6 - ➝ read_mcrypt_cookie.php  continues on page 166  t p y r C M g n i s U     164   Script 4.6 This script reads in a cookie with encrypted data  plus a second cookie that stores an important piece for decryption ; then it decrypts and prints the data.

Check that the cookies exist.  if  isset $_COOKIE[‘thing1’]  && ➝ isset $_COOKIE[‘thing2’]   { There’s no point in trying to decrypt  the data if the page can’t read the two cookies.  3. Create the key.  $key = md5 ‘77 public drop-shadow ➝ Java’ ; Not to belabor the point, but again, this must be the exact same key used to encrypt the data. This is another reason why you might want to store the key out- side of these scripts.  4. Open the cipher.  $m = mcrypt_module_open ‘rijndael- ➝ 256’, ‘’, ‘cbc’, ‘’ ; This should also match the encryption code  you have to use the same cipher and mode for both encryption and decryption .  5. Decode the IV.  $iv = base64_decode ➝  $_COOKIE[‘thing2’] ; The IV isn’t being generated here; it’s being retrieved from the cookie  because it has to be the same IV as was used to encrypt the data . The base64_decode   function will return the IV to its binary form.  6. Initialize the decryption.  mcrypt_generic_init $m, $key, $iv ;  7. Decrypt the data.  $data = mdecrypt_generic $m, ➝ base64_decode $_COOKIE[‘thing1’]  ; The mdecrypt_generic   function will decrypt the data. The data is coming from the cookie and must be decoded first.  166  t p y r C M g n i s U      Figure 4.21 The cookie data has been successfully decrypted.  Security Techniques  8. Wrap up the MCrypt code.  mcrypt_generic_deinit $m ; mcrypt_module_close $m ;  9. Print the data.  echo ‘ The cookie has been ➝ received. Its value is “‘ . ➝ trim $data  . ‘“. ’;  10. Complete the page.  } else {  echo ‘ There\’s nothing to  ➝ see here. ’; } ?>     The else clause applies if the two cook- ies were not accessible to the script.  11. Save the file as read_mcrypt_cookie.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 4.21 .  ✔ Tip    If you rerun the first script, you’ll see  that the encrypted version of the data is actually different each time, even though the data itself is always the same. This is because the IV will be different each time. Still, the decryption will always work, as the IV is stored in a cookie.     U s i n g M C r y p t  167   This page intentionally left blank    5  E-commerce Techniques  In this chapter, a Web site explicitly for selling products will be developed. The infor- mation you learn will help you to understand the mechanics of an online store while giving you some viable code. The example will focus on the PHP coding itself, along with the database requirements, and it will lead you to the point of implementing a payment system.  Due to the vast number of online payment systems, attempting to demonstrate any one would be of limited use.   This e-store will sell the ubiquitous widget. Unlike many similar examples, these will be some fancy widgets, organized under various categories and available in different sizes and colors. The specifics of these products are irrelevant; all I’m really trying to do is establish real-world factors for what might be sold online. You could also sell shirts in small, medium, and large that come in different colors or music available on compact disc, cassette tape, LP, or 8-track  admittedly not much of a market . Rarely will you get the chance to develop a site that sells only a handful of items, each in a singular format, so the example focuses on representational diversity.  E - c o m m e r c e T e c h n i q u e s     169      s t p e c n o C e c r e m m o c - E  Chapter 5  E-commerce Concepts Even the most basic e-commerce site requires multiple features. For example, an administrator should be able to:  ◆ Add new products  ◆ Edit existing products  ◆ Update product availability  ◆ View orders  ◆ Fulfill orders  Customers should be able to:  ◆ Register and log in  ◆ Possibly purchase without registration  ◆ Browse for products  ◆ Search for products  ◆ Add products to a shopping cart  ◆ Check out to complete an order  ◆ View an order’s status  To fully implement an e-commerce site with all of these features, addressing every possible security concern, would require a book in its own right. Instead, I’m going to focus on the most critical components. Features not implemented are those that are well docu- mented elsewhere  like in my other books  or easy enough to add on your own. I will, throughout the chapter, make suggestions  as to other things you could do. Additional information and code relating to this chap- ter is available on the companion Web site  www.DMCinsights.com phpvqp2  , and you can also ask questions via the supporting forum  www.DMCinsights.com phorum  .  170   E-commerce Techniques  Creating the Database The foundation for the store will be a data- base containing all the tables required for recording the customers, products, and orders. Under the premise of selling widgets that are categorized and can come in any color or size, I’ve come up with eight tables: five for the products, two for the orders, and another for the customer data.  This last table is roughed out in Table 5.1. This is a straightforward template for con- taining all of the customer information. I’m making the zip code and phone numbers text rather than number formats to allow for parentheses and dashes. This table also assumes only United States clients, but you can easily modify it for international address- es. One important note is that the database will not store the customer’s credit card information. This means a slight inconven- ience to the user  in having to reenter a credit card for each order , but it also signifi- cantly decreases the security risks involved.  In the database I suggest using two tables for the orders. The first  Table 5.2  records the metadata for the order: an order ID, the customer ID, the total amount, the credit card number used, and the order date. This table could also have fields indicating a ship- ping amount, the type of shipping selected, what coupons were applied and for how much, and so on. Now you might be think- ing: didn’t I just say I wasn’t going to store the credit card information? Yes, I did. All that the credit_card_number field in this table plans on storing is the last four digits of the credit card used by the customer for that order. By recording this information, customers can review their orders and see they used card number ************1234, which will mean something to them but nothing to a potential thief.  continues on next page  171     C r e a t i n g t h e D a t a b a s e     Table 5.1 The customers table keeps a list of every customer the site has. One update to the database would be to make the information in this table more international in scope by allowing for non-American addresses.  Table customers  C o l u m n  D ata   Ty p e  customer_id email pass first_name last_name address1 address2 city state zip phone  INT UNSIGNED VARCHAR 40  CHAR 40  VARCHAR 20  VARCHAR 30  VARCHAR 60  VARCHAR 60  VARCHAR 30  CHAR 2  VARCHAR 10  VARCHAR 15   Table 5.2 The orders table records the customer  via the customer’s ID , the total amount of the order, the last four digits of the credit card used, and the date and time the order was placed.  Table orders  C o l u m n  D ata   Ty p e  order_id customer_id total credit_card_number order_date  INT UNSIGNED INT UNSIGNED DECIMAL 10,2  INT 4  TIMESTAMP      e s a b a t a D e h t g n i t a e r C     Chapter 5  The second orders table stores the specific items in an order  Table 5.3 . Each product purchased will be represented as one record in this table  so if a person ordered five dif- ferent things, there would be five rows for that order . This table stores the product ID  called sw_id; you’ll see why soon , the quan- tity purchased, and the price paid apiece. Each item also has its own shipping date, in case an order is shipping incrementally.  As I said, there are five tables just to repre- sent the products. Of the five product tables, there are two “product attributes” tables: colors  Table 5.4  and sizes  Table 5.5 . Both are required by a normalized design, as multiple products will be in the same color or same size. Plus, these tables would make it easy to search or sort by color and size. A third table allows the widgets to be catego- rized  Table 5.6 . This makes browsing easi- er for the customer.  With the last two tables, a successful  e-commerce database requires that each unique product sold has a unique ID  or SKU, in retail terms . Red, medium T-shirts are different than black, medium T-shirts, which are different than black, large T-shirts. Each variation of a unique thing gets its own ID! Getting to that point is the only way for an e-commerce system to work. If a family of products had the same identifier, regard- less of size, color, and so on, there would be no way to track inventory or fulfill the order.  Toward that end, there will be a general widgets  or products  table that contains the generic information for an item: its name, its default price, a description, and the category under which it falls  Table 5.7 . Second, there is a specific widgets table. It acts as the glue between general widgets,  172  Table 5.3 The order_contents table has the details of an order; the actual products purchased, in what quantity, and at what price.  Table order_contents  C o l u m n  D ata   Ty p e  oc_id order_id sw_id quantity price ship_date  INT UNSIGNED INT UNSIGNED INT UNSIGNED TINYINT UNSIGNED DECIMAL 6,2  DATETIME  Table 5.4 The colors table only has two columns.  Table colors  C o l u m n  color_id color  D ata   Ty p e  TINYINTINT UNSIGNED VARCHAR 10   Table 5.5 The sizes table also only has two columns.  Table sizes  C o l u m n  size_id size  D ata   Ty p e  TINYINTINT UNSIGNED VARCHAR 10   Table 5.6 The categories table stores a category name, its ID, and a text description.  Table categories  C o l u m n  D ata   Ty p e  category_id category description  TINYINTINT UNSIGNED VARCHAR 30  TEXT   E-commerce Techniques  the colors, and the sizes  Table 5.8 . In this table, a widget of one general kind in a cer- tain color and a certain size is represented as a row, with a unique ID. The same general widget in the same color but a different size is another record with a different ID, and so on. This table ensures that each unique prod- uct sold has its own ID. This table also has a field stating whether or not the product is currently in stock. That column could be used to reflect on-hand inventory instead.  A note on prices, which are reflected upward of three times for each product: This might seem like a violation of normalization  redundancy being a very bad thing , but it’s really not. The general_widgets table stores the default price: what a product is assumed to sell for. The specific_widgets table pro- vides for the ability to override a price. You might do this to put an item on sale, charge more for a different size or color, or close out an item. Finally, the order_contents table has the price actually paid for an item. It’s very important that this field exist, as the price an item sells for might change, making that value different than what cus- tomers in the past paid for it.  Once you have all of the tables sketched out on paper, you can create them in your data- base. I’ll be using MySQL, so if you use another RDMS  relational database manage- ment system , change the SQL and instruc- tions as needed.  Also, to start things off, I’ll populate all of the products tables here, rather than creat- ing an administrative interface for that  purpose. The PHP scripts required to do that would be easy enough for you to create. If you don’t want to type all this text your- self, you can download the SQL commands from the book’s corresponding Web site.  173     C r e a t i n g t h e D a t a b a s e     Table 5.7 The general_widgets table stores general information about product lines. It also has a foreign key–primary key relationship with the categories table.

Figure 5.2 Creating the customers table.     e s a b a t a D e h t g n i t a e r C     Chapter 5  To create the database: 1. Connect to your server via a command-  line interface and connect to MySQL. If you’d rather, or are forced to, use phpMyAdmin or whatever other tool instead, that’s fine. 2. Create the database.  CREATE DATABASE ecommerce;  3. Choose the database  Figure 5.1 .  USE ecommerce;  4. Create the customers table  Figure 5.2 .  CREATE TABLE customers   customer_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ AUTO_INCREMENT, email VARCHAR 40  NOT NULL, pass CHAR 40  NOT NULL, first_name VARCHAR 20  NOT NULL, last_name VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL, address1 VARCHAR 60  NOT NULL, address2 VARCHAR 60 , city VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL, state CHAR 2  NOT NULL, zip_code VARCHAR 10  NOT NULL, phone VARCHAR 15 , PRIMARY KEY  customer_id , UNIQUE  email , KEY email_pass  email, pass    ENGINE=MyISAM; The customer_id will be the primary key  automatically incremented , but email will also be unique and indexed. Although you won’t directly use this table within the confines of this chapter, it’s a viable part of any e-commerce site and it would be remiss of me not to include it. The assumption is that customers would reg- ister and then be able to log in using a combination of their email address and their password  encrypted using SHA1   or a similar function .  174   Figure 5.3 Creating the orders table, which stores the metadata about the orders and uses a transaction- safe table type.  Figure 5.4 Creating the order_contents table, which lists the details for every order.  E-commerce Techniques  5. Create the orders table  Figure 5.3 .

Notice that a foreign key column here, like  customer_id, is of the same exact type  as its corresponding primary key   customer_id in the customers table . The order_date field will store the date and time an order was entered. Being defined as a TIMESTAMP, it will automati- cally be given the current value when a record is inserted. Finally, because I’ll want to use transac- tions with the orders and order_contents tables, both will use the InnoDB storage engine.  6. Create the order_contents table    Figure 5.4 . CREATE TABLE order_contents   oc_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ AUTO_INCREMENT, order_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, sw_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, quantity TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ DEFAULT 1, price DECIMAL 6,2  NOT NULL, ship_date DATETIME default NULL, PRIMARY KEY  oc_id , KEY order_id  order_id , KEY sw_id  sw_id , KEY ship_date  ship_date    ENGINE=InnoDB;  continues on next page 175     C r e a t i n g t h e D a t a b a s e      Figure 5.5 Creating the categories table, which provides categorization for the general widgets.  7. Create the categories table  Figure 5.5 .  Figure 5.6 Creating the colors table, which will be tied to general widgets to define specific widgets.     e s a b a t a D e h t g n i t a e r C     Chapter 5  In order to have a normalized database structure, I’ve separated out each order into its general information—the cus- tomer, the order date, and the total amount—and its specific information— the actual items ordered and in what quantity. This table has foreign keys to the orders and specific_widgets tables. The quantity has a default value of 1. The ship_date is defined as a DATETIME, so that it can have a NULL value, mean- ing that the item has not yet shipped. Again, this table must use the InnoDB storage engine in order to be part of a transaction.  CREATE TABLE categories   category_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ AUTO_INCREMENT, category VARCHAR 30  NOT NULL, description TEXT, PRIMARY KEY  category_id    ENGINE=MyISAM; The categories table is just an added layer so that general widgets can be clas- sified. In other e-commerce stores, the categories might be: shirts, sweaters, pants, etc., or music, movies, books, etc.  8. Create the colors table  Figure 5.6 .  CREATE TABLE colors   color_id TINYINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ AUTO_INCREMENT, color VARCHAR 10  NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY  color_id    ENGINE=MyISAM; A very simple little table, this has just two columns, one of which is a primary key. Creating this table is implied by nor- malization, as you wouldn’t want to use color names in the specific widgets table over and over again.  176   Figure 5.7 Creating the sizes table, which, along with colors, will define specific widgets.  Figure 5.8 Creating the general_widgets table, which stores information about generic products.  E-commerce Techniques  9. Create the sizes table  Figure 5.7 .

Selling books, music, and videos is rela-  tively straightforward, as these industries provide item-specific SKUs for the ven- dor  e.g., each book has its own ISBN number and the hardcover edition has a different ISBN than the paperback .    If you wanted to store multiple addresses  for users—home, billing, friends, etc.— create a separate addresses table. In  this table store all of that information, including the address type, and link those records back to the customers table using the customer ID as a  primary-foreign key.     e s a b a t a D e h t g n i t a e r C     182   E-commerce Techniques  Creating the Configuration File Every multipage Web application requires  a configuration file, and certainly this is  no exception. To make things easy—and because reusing code is just a smart thing  to do—most of this configuration file will mimic the one developed in Chapter 2, “Developing Web Applications.” For more information on most of this code, see that chapter. Also, because every page in the  e-commerce site requires a database con- nection  and to save time and book space , I’ll throw the database connectivity code into this file as well.  As with nearly every example in the book, I’ll be using the Improved MySQL functions, available as of PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1. If you’re using an earlier version of either, or a differ- ent database application entirely, you’ll need to change the code accordingly.        C r e a t i n g t h e C o n f i g u r a t i o n F i l e     183   Chapter 5  To create the configuration file: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 5.1 . <?php  Script 5.1 - config.inc.php  2. Set the email address to be used for errors.  $contact_email = ➝ ‘address@example.com’;  continues on page 187  Script 5.1 The config.inc.php file is essentially the same as that written in Chapter 2, although it now also connects to the database.     e l i F n o i t a r u g i f n o C e h t g n i t a e r C        <?php  Script 5.1 - config.inc.php   *  * * * * * *   Configuration file does the following things: - Has site settings in one location. - Stores URLs and URIs as constants. - Sets how errors will be handled. - Establishes a connection to the database.   ********************   ***** SETTINGS *****      Errors are emailed here. $contact_email = 'address@example.com';   $local = TRUE;  } else {  $local = FALSE;  }     Determine location of files and the URL of the site:    Allow for development on different servers. if  $local  {     Always debug when running locally: $debug = TRUE;     Define the constants: define  'BASE_URI', ' path to html folder ' ; define  'BASE_URL', 'http:  localhost directory ' ;  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39     Determine whether we're working on a local server    or on the real server: if  stristr $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 'local'    substr $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], 0, 7  == '192.168'   {  } else {  184  define  'BASE_URI', ' path to live html folder ' ;   script continues on next page    E-commerce Techniques  Script 5.1 continued  define  'BASE_URL', 'http:  www.example.com ' ;  Most important setting...

Determine if the script is running on the  live server or a test server. if  stristr $_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’], ➝ ‘local’    substr $_SERVER ➝ [‘HTTP_HOST’], 0, 7  == ‘192.168’   ➝ {  $local = TRUE;  $local = FALSE;  } else {  }  4. Set the server-specific constants.  if  $local  {  $debug = TRUE; define  ‘BASE_URI’,  ➝ ‘ path to html folder ’ ;  define  ‘BASE_URL’,  ➝ ‘http:  localhost directory ’ ; } else {  define  ‘BASE_URI’,  ➝ ‘ path to live html folder ’ ;  define  ‘BASE_URL’,  ➝ ‘http:  www.example.com ’ ; } Unlike in the script in Chapter 2, I am not defining a path to the database file here, as that code will appear later in this script. If you want to keep the data- base information separate, then define a DB constant here, with the full path to that file. If necessary, you could also define server- specific database access constants here. You might do this if you use one set of username password hostname for your local server and another for the live server.  5. Set the debugging mode. if  !isset $debug   { $debug = FALSE;  }  continues on next page  187        C r e a t i n g t h e C o n f i g u r a t i o n F i l e      Figure 5.14 Detailed error messages aid in debugging problems.

Define the function for handling errors.  function my_error_handler  $e_number, ➝ $e_message, $e_file, $e_line, ➝ $e_vars  {  global $debug, $contact_email; $message = “An error occurred in  ➝ script ‘$e_file’ on line $e_line: ➝ \n $e_message\n ”;  $message .= “Date Time: “ .  ➝ date ‘n-j-Y H:i:s’  . “\n ”;  $message .= “ ” . print_r ➝  $e_vars, 1  . “ \n ”;  if  $debug  {  echo ‘ ’  ➝ . $message . ‘ ’;  } else {  error_log  $message, 1,  ➝ $contact_email ;    Send email.  if    $e_number !=  ➝ E_NOTICE  &&  $e_number < 2048   {  echo ‘<p  class=”error”>A system error ➝ occurred. We apologize for the ➝ inconvenience. ’;  }  }  } If debugging is turned on, a full, detailed message will appear in the Web browser  Figure 5.14 . For a live site, the detailed error message should not be shown  unless debugging is temporarily enabled for that page  but should be emailed instead. The error_log   function will do this, if provided with the number 1 as its second argument. But the user proba- bly needs to know that something didn’t go right, so a generic message is dis- played  Figure 5.15 . If the error hap- pens to be a notice or a strict error  hav- ing a value of 2048 , no message should be printed, as the error is likely not inter- fering with the operation of the page.  188   7. Tell PHP to use this error handler.  set_error_handler ➝  ‘my_error_handler’ ;  8. Establish a database connection.  $dbc = @mysqli_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’, ➝ ‘ecommerce’  OR ➝ trigger_error “Could not connect to ➝ the database!\n MySQL Error: “ ➝ . mysqli_connect_error   ; If a database connection cannot be made, the trigger_error   function will invoke my_error_handler  , managing the error as appropriate for a live or local site. The error message will begin with Could not connect to the database!, fol- lowed by the MySQL connection error.  E-commerce Techniques  9. Define a function for escaping   query data. function escape_data  $data  {  global $dbc; if  ini_get  ➝  ‘magic_quotes_gpc’   {  $data =  ➝ stripslashes $data ;  } return mysqli_real_escape_  ➝ string $dbc, trim $data  ; } This bit of code is one of my favorite creations, if I do say so myself. It takes a piece of data, strips any slashes if Magic Quotes is enabled  if the function didn’t do this, the data would be over-escaped , and then trims and escapes the data using the secure mysqli_real_escape_ string   function. Any data run through this function should be safe to use in  a query.  10. Complete the page.  ?>  11. Save the file as config.inc.php and place it in your Web directory  in an includes subfolder .        C r e a t i n g t h e C o n f i g u r a t i o n F i l e     189   Chapter 5  Making the Template This e-commerce application will also use  a template, of course, just like the example in Chapter 2. For this template, I’ll use another design found on Open Source  Web Design  www.oswd.org . This particular design  Figure 5.16  is by Tjobbe Andrews  www.sitecreative.net  and is gratefully used with his kind permission.  I’ve modified it slightly  Figure 5.17  to show the store’s name. The right-side col- umn lists the categories of widgets for brows- ing purposes and also has areas that could be used to promote other products, reflect the contents of the shopping cart, or contain a search form. I haven’t modified the top navigation, but you might want to make a spot there for quickly accessing the cart  such as a tab to cart.php .  In Chapter 2 I go through the steps involved in turning a sample page into a template. Here I’ll just create the templates outright. In order to save space, the CSS file for this example  which controls the layout  is not included in the book. You can download the file through the book’s supporting Web site  www.DMCInsights.com phpvqp2 , see the Extras page .     e t a l p m e T e h t g n i k a M     190  Figure 5.16 Tjobbe Andrews’ original design.

Begin a new PHP page in your text editor  or IDE  Script 5.2 . <?php  Script 5.2 - header.html  2. Start the session and check for a  $page_title variable. session_start  ; if  !isset $page_title   $page_title ➝ = ‘WoW::World of Widgets!’; ?> The shopping cart relies upon sessions, so every page must have session access. As for the $page_title variable, that’s used to set the browser window’s title on a page-by-page basis. If one is not defined prior to including this file, a default title is used.     M a k i n g t h e T e m p l a t e     Script 5.2 The header.html document contains the beginnings of an HTML page and starts the session.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  <?php  Script 5.2 - header.html  This page begins the HTML header for the site.

Save the file as footer.html, placing   it your Web directory’s includes folder  along with header.html, config.inc.php, and style.css .  ✔ Tips    Any variable you define in an included  file that is only used in that file  like the category ID and name in the header  should be given a unique name. If you don’t do that, you’ll likely run into odd, hard-to-debug errors. For example, if I used $cid and $cat instead of $fcid and $fcat in header.html, I’d have conflicts with the $cid and $cat variables used in the category.php page  developed later in the chapter .    One of the right-hand sections could be used for new products. To retrieve, say, the three latest products, you could just fetch those from the specific_widgets table with the highest sw_id values  since it’s an automatically incrementing number .  196   E-commerce Techniques  Creating the Index Page The site’s home page won’t really do much, but it needs to exist regardless. It will show how all of the other pages are assembled, though. Let’s whip that out quickly. To create the index page: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 5.4 . <?php  Script 5.4 - index.php  continues on next page  Script 5.4 This script acts as the public home page.  <?php  Script 5.4 - index.php   *  * * *   This is the main page.

Save the file as index.php, place it in your  Web directory, and test in your Web browser  see Figure 5.17 for the result .  198   E-commerce Techniques  Browsing by Category Now that the database has been implement- ed and all of the base PHP files written, it’s time to begin adding functionality to the site. With the example as I’m developing  it, all of the products will be accessed by browsing. This starts with a widget category page, which is found by clicking a link in the right-hand column.  The category page should put the category’s name in the browser window’s title as well as on the page itself. After that, the page should contain a description of the category, if it exists, and every widget that falls under this category  Figure 5.20 . These widgets would be linked to the widget-specific pages.  Figure 5.20 The category page shows information about general widgets.     B r o w s i n g b y C a t e g o r y     199   Script 5.5 The category page is the first step in the browsing process  for the customer . It lists all the general widgets found in that category.  Chapter 5  To create the category page: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 5.5 . <?php  Script 5.5 - category.php require_once  ‘. includes  ➝ config.inc.php’ ;  continues on page 202     y r o g e t a C y b g n i s w o r B     <?php  Script 5.5 - category.php   *  * * * * *   This page represents a specific category. This page shows all the widgets classified under that category. The page expects to receive a $_GET['cid'] value.     Require the configuration file before any PHP code: require_once  '. includes config.inc.php' ;     Check for a category ID in the URL: $category = NULL; if  isset $_GET['cid']   {     Typecast it to an integer: $cid =  int  $_GET['cid'];    An invalid $_GET['cid'] value would    be typecast to 0.     $cid must have a valid value. if  $cid > 0  {  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34  200     Get the information from the database    for this category: $q = "SELECT category, description FROM categories WHERE category_id=$cid"; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ;     Fetch the information: if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  }    End of mysqli_num_rows   IF.  list  $category, $description  = mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ;   script continues on next page    E-commerce Techniques  Script 5.5 continued  }    End of  $cid > 0  IF.  }    End of isset $_GET['cid']  IF.     Use the category as the page title: if  $category  {  $page_title = $category;     Include the header file: include_once  '. includes header.html' ;  if  $category  {    Show the products.  echo " $category \n";  35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57  58 59 60 61 62 63  64 65 66  67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81  }  {  }  ?>  }  }     B r o w s i n g b y C a t e g o r y        Print the category description, if it's not empty. if  !empty $description   {  echo " $description \n";     Get the widgets in this category: $q = "SELECT gw_id, name, default_price, description FROM general_widgets WHERE  category_id=$cid";  $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ;  if  mysqli_num_rows $r  > 1  {     Print each: while  list $gw_id, $wname, $wprice, $wdescription  = mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM       Link to the product.php page: echo "  $wname   $wdescription<br   >\$$wprice \n";  }    End of while loop.  } else {    No widgets here!  echo ' There are no widgets in this category. ';  } else {    Invalid $_GET['cid']!  echo ' This page has been accessed in error. ';     Include the footer file to complete the template: include_once  '. includes footer.html' ;  201      y r o g e t a C y b g n i s w o r B     Chapter 5  2. Begin validating the category ID.  $category = NULL; if  isset $_GET[‘cid’]   {  $cid =  int  $_GET[‘cid’]; if  $cid > 0  {  First, a flag variable is created, called $category. The script will refer to this later on to tell if a valid category ID  was received. Next, a check confirms  that some $_GET[‘cid’] value was received, which is then typecast to an integer. This forces $cid to be an integer. Even if someone changed the URL to category.php?cid= path to file, $cid would now equal 0. The next check  confirms that the integer has a positive value.  3. Retrieve the category information.  $q = “SELECT category, description ➝ FROM categories WHERE ➝ category_id=$cid”; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  list  $category, $description  = ➝ mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ; }  4. Complete the validation conditionals.  }    End of  $cid > 0  IF.  }    End of isset $_GET[‘cid’]  IF.  5. Make the category name be the page title  and include the header file. if  $category  {  $page_title = $category;  } include_once  ‘. includes  ➝ header.html’ ; If the query in Step 3 did return a row, then that value  e.g., Fuzzy Widgets  should be used in the browser window.  202   Figure 5.21 The main query and its results for one of the category pages.  Figure 5.22 The HTML source reveals how each general widget is linked to the product page, passing along the general widget ID in the URL.  E-commerce Techniques  6. If a valid category ID was used, print the  category name and description. if  $category  {  echo “ $category \n”; if  !empty $description   {  echo “ $description  ➝  \n”;  }  The description field in the database is optional  it can be NULL , so a conditional here checks for a value prior to printing it.  7. Retrieve all the widgets that are in this  category. $q = “SELECT gw_id, name, ➝ default_price, description FROM ➝ general_widgets WHERE ➝ category_id=$cid”; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; if  mysqli_num_rows $r  > 1  { This query retrieves all the general widg- et information for widgets associated with this category  Figure 5.21 .  8. Print each widget, linking it to the prod-  ucts page. while  list $gw_id, $wname, $wprice, ➝ $wdescription  = mysqli_fetch_ ➝ array $r, MYSQLI_NUM   {  echo “ <a href=\”product.php? ➝ gwid=$gw_id\”>$wname   $w ➝ description \$$wprice \n”; } It’s not the most attractive layout, but I’ll just print each widget in a vertical list. You could use the technique shown in Chapter 3, “Advanced Database Concepts,” to lay the widgets out in horizontal rows. As you can see from the HTML source code of the page  Figure 5.22 , each widget’s name is linked to product.php, passing along the widget’s ID  from the database , in the URL. The widget’s description and default price are then under each name.  203     B r o w s i n g b y C a t e g o r y      Chapter 5  9. Complete the conditionals begun in  Steps 7 and 6. } else {  echo ‘<p  ➝ class=”error”>There are no widgets ➝ in this category. ’;  }  } else {  echo ‘ This  ➝ page has been accessed in ➝ error. ’; } The first else clause applies if there are no widgets in this category. A message stating such will be printed in the brows- er  Figure 5.23 . The second else applies if an invalid category ID is passed to this page  Figure 5.24 .  10. Complete the page.  include_once  ‘. includes  ➝ footer.html’ ; ?>  11. Save the file as category.php, place it in  your Web directory, and test in your Web browser by using the links in the right-hand column  Figure 5.25 .     y r o g e t a C y b g n i s w o r B     Figure 5.23 If a category has no products  general widgets  in it, the customer will see this message.  Figure 5.24 If a malicious user hacks the category ID value in the URL  or if something just goes wrong , this will be the result.  Figure 5.25 Another category of widgets.  204   E-commerce Techniques  Showing a Product By clicking an individual product in the cat- egory page, customers will be taken to the product-specific page. This page should show all the general details about a widget—name and description, plus all of the specific ver- sions of the widget available  Figure 5.26 . Here is where all the widget colors and sizes get pulled out of the database and revealed.  The other feature of this page is a method that enables the customer to add an item to their shopping cart. This could be handled in any number of ways; I’ll create a link that passes the specific product ID to cart.php. For the most part, this script will behave, and be written, like category.php.  Figure 5.26 The specific products page.     S h o w i n g a P r o d u c t     205   Chapter 5  To make the product page: 1.

The script will refer to this later on to tell if a valid general widget ID was received. Next, a check confirms that some $_GET[‘gwid’] value was received, which is then typecast to an integer. This forces $gwid to be an integer. The next check confirms that the integer has a positive value. All of this is exactly like the code in category.php.  3. Retrieve the general widget information and complete the validation conditionals.  $q = “SELECT name,  ➝ default_price, description FROM ➝ general_widgets WHERE gw_id=$gwid”;  $r = mysqli_query $dbc,  ➝ $q ;  ➝ == 1  {  if  mysqli_num_rows $r   list  $name,  ➝ $price, $description  = ➝ mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ;  }  }    End of  $gwid > 0  IF.  }    End of isset $_GET[‘gwid’]  IF.

For each item, the price to use has  to be determined. This is the default price  associated with the general  widget  unless the specific widget has  a new price. The size, color, price, and availability are then printed.  8. Print a link to the shopping cart. Then complete the item and the while loop. if  $row[‘in_stock’] == ‘Y’  {  echo “  <a  ➝ href=\”cart.php?sw_id={$row[‘sw_ ➝ id’]}&do=add\”>Add to Cart ”;  } echo ‘ ’;  }    End of WHILE loop. If the product is in stock, it should be purchasable. Customers can purchase an item just by clicking the link  this is a common method in most e-commerce sites . The link passes the specific widget ID to cart.php  Figure 5.28 . Each link also passes another variable called do, with a value of add. This will provide an easy way, on the cart page, to know what should be done  the cart page will allow for both adding new items and updating quantities .  210   Figure 5.29 General widgets may not have any specific widgets available, resulting in this message.  }  } else {  Figure 5.30 Viewing another product.

Chapter 5  Implementing a  Shopping Cart The most important aspect of the  e-commerce site is the shopping cart  itself. A shopping cart should:  ◆ Allow the customer to add items to   the cart  ◆ Allow for different quantities of each item  ◆ Allow the customer to alter the   quantities of an item  ◆ Allow the customer to remove an item  ◆ Not allow the customer to hack an   item’s price  All of the other functionality of an  e-commerce site—from displaying prod- ucts to processing the order—is separate from the cart. I’m going to write a shopping cart page that does all of this as well as  display the cart’s contents  Figure 5.31 . There are a number of ways you can handle the cart contents, normally storing them  in either a database or a session. I prefer  the latter method, although this does mean you could potentially have session problems.  This page would be invoked under two  situations: after the user clicks an “Add to Cart” link and after the user updates the cart’s contents. The main if-else condition- al checks for these two situations. Every time the cart is accessed, even directly with- out clicking “Add to Cart” or updating the form, the page will show the current cart’s contents.        t r a C g n i p p o h S a g n i t n e m e l p m     i  212   E-commerce Techniques  To make a shopping cart page: 1.

Validate the specific widget ID. if  isset $_GET[‘sw_id’]   {  $sw_id =  int  $_GET[‘sw_id’]; if  $sw_id > 0  {  Just to be safe, you should make sure that the specific widget ID is a positive integer.  5.

If the item is already represented in the shop- ping cart, the assumption is that the customer wants to add another. In that case, $_SESSION[‘cart’][$sw_id] is incremented. Otherwise, a new array  element is added to the cart, with a  value of 1. Messages indicating what  just happened are then printed   Figures 5.32 and 5.33 .  7. Complete the conditionals started in Steps 4 and 5, and then check to see if $_REQUEST[‘do’] equals update.  ➝ mysqli_num_rows   IF.  }    End of  }    End of  $sw_id > 0   IF.  }    End of  ➝ isset $_GET[‘sw_id’]  IF. } elseif  isset $_REQUEST[‘do’]  && ➝  $_REQUEST[‘do’] == ‘update’   { $_REQUEST[‘do’] will have a value of update when the user updates their cart by submitting the form. At this point the shopping cart should attempt to update every quantity.  218   E-commerce Techniques  8. Update the cart quantities.  foreach  $_POST[‘qty’] as $k => $v  {  $pid =  int  $k; $qty =  int  $v; if  $qty == 0  {  unset  ➝  $_SESSION[‘cart’][$pid] ;  } elseif  $qty > 0  {  $_SESSION[‘cart’][$pid]  ➝ = $qty;  }  } This is pretty simple. Both the key, which is the product ID, and the value, which is the quantity, are first typecast to integers. If the quantity equals 0, then the item is removed from the cart. This will also apply if a noninteger is entered as the quantity. Otherwise, as long as the quantity is positive, the cart is updated.  9. Print a message and complete the  $_REQUEST if-else.  echo ‘ Your shopping cart has  ➝ been updated. ’; }    End of $_REQUEST IF-ELSE.  10. Show the cart contents, if it’s not empty.  if  isset $_SESSION[‘cart’]  && ➝ !empty $_SESSION[‘cart’]   { If the customer goes directly to the cart page, then $_SESSION[‘cart’] will not be set. If the user deletes everything from their cart, then $_SESSION[‘cart’] will be empty.  continues on next page  219  i     m p l e m e n t i n g a S h o p p i n g C a r t         Figure 5.34 The query used by the shopping cart to retrieve each item’s details.        t r a C g n i p p o h S a g n i t n e m e l p m     i  Chapter 5  11. Create the query for retrieving the cart  content details. $q = “SELECT sw_id, name, color, ➝ size, default_price, price FROM ➝ general_widgets LEFT JOIN  ➝ specific_widgets USING  gw_id  ➝ LEFT JOIN colors USING  color_id  ➝ LEFT JOIN sizes USING  size_id  ➝ WHERE sw_id IN  “; foreach  $_SESSION[‘cart’] as $sw_id ➝ => $v  {  $q .=  int  $sw_id . ‘,’;  } $q = substr  $q, 0, -1  . ‘  ORDER ➝ BY name, size, color’; $r = mysqli_query  $dbc, $q ; The query needs to perform a join across four tables in order to retrieve each item’s name, color, size, and price. An IN clause will append each specific widget ID to the query. Figure 5.34 shows the query and its result.  12. Begin creating the table and form. if  mysqli_num_rows $r  > 0  {  echo ‘<table border=”0”  ➝ width=”90%” cellspacing=”2” ➝ cellpadding=”2” align=”center”>     <td align=”left”  ➝ width=”20%”> Widget    <td align=”left”  ➝ width=”15%”> Size    <td align=”left”  ➝ width=”15%”> Color    <td align=”right”  ➝ width=”15%”> Price   <td align=”center”  ➝ width=”10%”> Qty   <td align=”right”  ➝ width=”15%”> Total Price    220   E-commerce Techniques     <form action=”cart.php” ➝ method=”post”> <input type=”hidden” name=”do” ➝ value=”update”  > ‘; The table generated by this cart will list the products ordered, as well as how many and at what price. It will be creat- ed as an HTML form allowing the cus- tomer to alter the quantities, even delet- ing an item altogether. The recipient of the form will be the cart.php script, this same page. A hidden input named do with a value of update will indicate to this page that a cart update is in order once the form has been submitted  see Step 7 .  13. Initialize a total variable and begin  retrieving each item. $total = 0; while  $row = mysqli_fetch_array ➝  $r, MYSQLI_ASSOC   {  14. Calculate the price of the item, the  subtotal, and the total thus far. $price =  empty $row[‘price’]   ? ➝ $row[‘default_price’] : ➝ $row[‘price’]; $subtotal = $_SESSION[‘cart’] ➝ [$row[‘sw_id’]] * $price; $total += $subtotal; $subtotal = number_ ➝ format $subtotal, 2 ; Remember that the price of an item could be the default price or the specific widget price, if it exists. The ternary oper- ator helps assign the price to use to the $price variable. Then the subtotal is cal- culated as the price times the quantity. This is added to the $total variable and then formatted  for display purposes .  continues on next page  221  i     m p l e m e n t i n g a S h o p p i n g C a r t         Figure 5.35 Part of the HTML source of the form. For each input, the name is qty[X], where X is the specific widget ID and the value is preset as the current quantity in the cart.  Chapter 5  15. Print each item in the cart.  echo <<<EOT     <td  <td  <td  align=”left”>{$row[‘name’]}   align=”left”>{$row[‘size’]}    {$row  ➝ [‘color’]}    \$$price   <input  ➝ type=”text” size=”3” ➝ name=”qty[{$row[‘sw_id’]}]” ➝ value=”{$_SESSION[‘cart’][$row ➝ [‘sw_id’]]}”  >   align=”right”>\$$subtotal   \n EOT; }    End of the WHILE loop. Because I’m using a mix of HTML  and PHP variables here, the heredoc syntax is a good way to print it all out  see Chapter 1 for details . Each record from the query is a row in the table, with the name, size, and color printed  as is. Then the price, quantity, and subtotal are printed. Notice that the quantity is printed as an HTML  text input, with the current quantity as the value  Figure 5.35 . This will make  it easy for the customer to change the quantities as needed.        t r a C g n i p p o h S a g n i t n e m e l p m     i  222   E-commerce Techniques  16.

Then instructions show how to remove an item. Finally,  the user is given two buttons: one for updating the cart  submitting the  form back to this page  and another  for checking out.  17. Complete the page.  }  } else {  echo ‘ Your cart is currently  ➝ empty. ’; } include_once ➝  ‘. includes footer.html’ ; ?>  18.

By comparing that code with this code, you can get a glimpse into procedural versus object-oriented programming.   Chapter 5  Validating Credit Cards The next step for the consumer in the e- commerce process would be to check out. It’s at this point that the site would take or confirm their name, shipping address, and other information. If using a registration and login system, this information would  be pulled out of the database  the customers table already allows for it . A checkout page might also apply discounts or gift certifi- cates to an order, allow the customer to specify the shipping method  calculating the shipping accordingly  or choose gift wrap- ping, and more.  All checkout systems begin the payment process. For some sites, this is a link to PayPal or another online payment handler. For other sites, this is where the credit card information is taken. This next script will be a bare-bones implementation of a checkout page, taking the credit card type, number, and expiration date, and then validating this information. For validating credit cards,     s d r a C t i d e r C g n i t a d i l a V     there are certain rules the numbers must abide by. Different types of cards have dif- ferent lengths and potentially different set numbers  e.g., all Visa cards begin with a 4, all MasterCards with a 5 . Every credit card number, no matter the type, must also pass the Luhn Mod 10 algorithm. It’s a compli- cated little scheme and, coupled with the card type–specific checks, I find it best to use existing card validation code, rather than rolling your own. Toward that end, this next script will use the PEAR Validate_ Finance_CreditCard class. Although in alpha stage at this writing, it works just fine. If you can’t or don’t want to use this PEAR class, just search the Web for other PHP credit card validation code. Note that this, or any similar code, doesn’t test if a credit card number is approved for purchases. Rather, it confirms that a number is syntactically cor- rect. The payment gateway  see the accom- panying sidebar “Handling Payments”  would still have to be used to approve a purchase; this code prevents an attempted purchase using an knowingly invalid card number.  224   E-commerce Techniques  To validate credit cards: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 5.8 . <?php  Script 5.8 - checkout.php require_once  ‘. includes  ➝ config.inc.php’ ; $page_title = ‘Checkout’; include_once  ‘. includes  ➝ header.html’ ; echo ‘ Checkout ’;  continues on page 228     V a l i d a t i n g C r e d i t C a r d s     Script 5.8 This, the final script in the chapter, primarily demonstrates one way to validate a credit card number.

The reason is that how the most important aspect—the commerce—is handled varies greatly. This requires some system, called a payment gateway, to get the money from the  customer’s account to the store’s account.  Normally a store creates an account with a chosen gateway. Every gateway I’ve ever worked with provides an API  application programming interface  for connecting your site to their system. What this really comes down to is submitting a form with certain information—the store’s ID, the customer’s information, the credit card information, the amount of the trans- action, and so on—to the gateway’s server. The server processes the information and then returns to the store’s site a code indicating the success of the transaction.  When it comes time for you to implement a complete e-commerce solution, you’ll need  to choose a gateway and then program the final steps of your site to match the gateway’s methodologies. It’s not at all hard; it’s just not something that can really be done in a book.     s d r a C t i d e r C g n i t a d i l a V     232   6  Basic Object- Oriented Programming  Object-oriented programming  commonly abbreviated OOP  is a relative newcomer to the world of programming. Before the advent of OOP, languages such as Pascal and BASIC solved problems through linear programming. As projects get bigger, perhaps requiring teams of developers, this approach becomes too time-consuming and error-prone. Hence OOP, which allows programmers to more rapidly develop, use, and manage sophisticated applications.  Similarly, OOP is quite new to PHP. Version 3 of the language had rudimentary sup- port, and version 4 made some nice improvements on this front. It’s in PHP 5 that OOP support has become closer to what true OOP languages, like Java and C, offer. Although PHP is still not as strong in its OOP feature set as it could be, object-oriented programming in PHP has a lot going for it. While expert PHP programmers can go through their entire careers without ever using objects without significant limitations on what they can do, most find some knowledge of the subject beneficial.  In this chapter, and the next  Chapter 7, “Advanced OOP” , I will only be using objects as they function in PHP 5 and later. This is very important: If you’re using PHP 4, most of this code will not work!  And, frankly, compared with PHP 5, objects in PHP 4 aren’t even worth learning.  Here, I will use somewhat mundane examples, as the focus of the chapter is more on explaining OOP theory and syntax to the uninitiated. In sub- sequent chapters, practical, real-world code will be used. Through multiple examples and plenty of explanation, I hope in this book to fully demonstrate not just how you do object-oriented programming in PHP but also when and why.     B a s i c O b j e c t - O r i e n t e d P r o g r a m m i n g     233   y r o e h T P O O  Chapter 6  OOP Theory The first thing that you must understand about OOP is that it presents not just new syntax but a new way of thinking about a problem. By far the most common mistake beginning OOP programmers make is to inappropriately apply OOP. PHP will tell you when you make a syntactical mistake, but you’ll need to learn how to avoid theoretical mistakes, too.  The two most important terms for OOP are class and object. A class is a generalized definition of a thing. Think of classes as a blueprint. An object is the implementation of that thing. Think of objects as the house built using the blueprint. To program using OOP, you design your classes and then implement them in your programs as needed.  One of the tenets of OOP is modularity: breaking applications into specific subparts. Web sites do many, many things: interact with databases, handle forms, send emails, generate HTML, etc. Each of these things can be a module, which is to say a class. By separating unrelated  albeit interacting  ele- ments, code can be developed independent- ly, maintenance and updates may be less messy, and debugging can be simplified.  Related to modularity is abstraction: classes should be defined broadly. This is a common and understandable beginner’s mistake. As an example, instead of designing a class for interacting with a MySQL database, you should make one that interacts with a non- specific database. From there, using inheri- tance and overriding, you would define a more particular class for MySQL. This class would look and act like the general database class, but some of its functionality would be customized.  234  Another principle of OOP is encapsulation: separating out and hiding how something is accomplished. A properly designed object can do everything you need it to do without your ever knowing how it’s being done. Coupled with encapsulation is access control or visibility, which dictates how accessible aspects of the object are.  Those are the main concepts behind OOP. You’ll see how they play out in the many OOP examples in this book. But before getting into the code, I’ll talk about OOP’s dark side.  First of all, OOP is not a better way to program, just a different way. In some cases, it may be better and in some cases worse, but OOP is not the Mount Everest of all things program- ming. And in PHP in particular, you can have a long, happy, and viable programming career without OOP. However, you might have a more productive, easier, and lucrative career using it  emphasis on “might” .  As for the technical negatives of OOP, use of objects can  often  be less efficient than a procedural approach  just as defining and invoking your own functions can be less effi- cient . The performance difference between using an object or not may be imperceptible in some cases, but you should be aware of this potential side effect.  A second issue that arises is what I have already pointed out: misuse and overuse of objects. Making this mistake isn’t the end of the world, of course, or even cause for your applications to fail, but like trying to use a screwdriver to drive a nail, it’s just not a good thing to do.  True object-oriented programming is smart, purposeful object-oriented programming!   Basic Object-Oriented Programming  Defining a Class OOP programming begins with classes, a class being an abstract definition of a thing: what information must be stored and what functionality must be possible. A philosoph- ical example of a class would be Human. A Human class would be able to store informa- tion such as gender, height, weight, birth date, and so forth. The functionality of a Human could be eating, sleeping, working,  and more.  Syntactically, a class definition begins with the word class, followed by the name of the class. The class name cannot be a reserved word and is often written in uppercase, as a convention  I always use lowercase for my variables but stick with uppercase classes . After the class name, the class definition is placed within curly braces: class ClassName { }  Classes contain variables and functions, which are referred to as attributes  or proper- ties  and methods, respectively  you’ll see other terms, too . Functions are easy to add to classes: class ClassName {  function function_name   {     Function code.  }  }  The methods you define within a class are defined just like functions outside of a class. They can take arguments, have default values, return values, and so on.  continues on next page  235  D e f i n i n g a C l a s s        Design Patterns  A subject you’ll hear in correlation to OOP is patterns  or design patterns . By following the principles of OOP, you’ll come up with a class, which is a blueprint for building a thing. Every time you have an application that requires that thing, you use that class. If your application requires a variant of that thing, you use an extension of that class.  The more you program, the more you realize that most applications do the same things  or variants of those things . This is to say that most programs have the same problems that must be solved. With this in mind, design patterns are accepted solutions to common problems. They aren’t necessarily specific code implementations but more like a tem- plate to apply. Smart people have thought about these issues and come up with the best approach. If you find yourself faced with a common problem, use a design pattern instead of reinventing the wheel.   Note that you don’t have to initialize the attributes with a value. And, aside from declaring variables, all of a class’s code goes within its methods. You could not do this: class BadClass {  public $num = 2; public $square; $square = $num * $num;    No!  }  With all of this in mind, let’s create an easy, almost useless class just to make sure it’s all working fine and dandy. Naturally, I’ll use a Hello, world! example  it’s either that or foo and bar . To make it a little more interesting, this class will be able to say Hello, world! in different languages.  Chapter 6  Attributes within classes are a little different than variables outside of classes. First of all, all attributes must be prefixed with a key- word indicating the variable’s visibility. The options are: public, private, and protected. Unfortunately these values won’t mean any- thing to you until you understand inheri- tance  in Chapter 7 , so until then, just use public: class ClassName {  public $var1, $var2; function function_name   {     Function code.  As shown here, a class’s attributes are listed before any method definitions.  The second distinction between attributes and normal variables is that, if an attribute is initialized with a set value, that value must be a constant and not the result of an expression. class GoodClass {  public $var1 = 123; public $var2 = ‘string’; public $var3 = array 1, 2, 3 ;  } class BadClass {     These won’t work! public $today = get_date  ; public $square = $num * $num;        s s a l C a g n i n i f e D  }  }  }  236   Script 6.1 This simple class will allow you to say Hello, world! through the magic of objects!  Okay, so it’s completely unnecessary, but it’s a fine introductory demonstration.   <?php  Script 6.1 - HelloWorld.php  This page defines the HelloWorld  The class says “Hello, world!” in   * class. * different languages. *   class HelloWorld {     This method prints a greeting.    It takes one argument: the  language to use.     Default language is English. function say_hello  $language =  ‘English’  {     Put the greeting within   P tags.  echo ‘ ’;  1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10  11 12  13 14  15 16   script continues on next page   Basic Object-Oriented Programming  To define a class: 1. Create a new PHP document in your text  editor or IDE  Script 6.1 . <?php  Script 6.1 - HelloWorld.php  2. Begin defining the class.  class HelloWorld { Using the syntax outlined earlier, start with the keyword class, followed by the name of the class, followed by the open- ing curly brace  which could go on the next line, if you prefer . For the class name, I use the “camel”  capitalization: initial letters capitalized as are the first letter of new words. This is a pseudo-standardized convention in many OOP languages.   3. Begin defining the first  and only   method. function say_hello  $language = ➝ ‘English’  { This class currently contains no attrib- utes  variables , which would have been declared before the methods. This method is called say_hello  . It takes one argument: the language for the greeting. For the methods, I normally use all low- ercase and separate words with an underscore. This is the same naming scheme I use for functions outside of classes.  4. Start the method’s code.  echo ‘ ’; The method will print Hello, world! in one of several languages. The message will be wrapped within HTML paragraph tags, begun here.  continues on next page  237  D e f i n i n g a C l a s s         Chapter 6  5. Add the method’s switch.  switch  $language  {  case ‘Dutch’:  echo ‘Hello, wereld!’; break; case ‘French’:  echo ‘Bonjour, monde!’; break; case ‘German’:  echo ‘Hallo, Welt!’; break; case ‘Italian’:  echo ‘Ciao, mondo!’; break; case ‘Spanish’:  echo ‘¡Hola, mundo!’; break; case ‘English’: default:  echo ‘Hello, world!’; break;  } The switch prints different messages based upon the chosen language. English is the default language, both in the switch and as the value of the $language argument  see Step 3 . Obviously you can easily expand this switch to include more languages, like non-Western ones.        s s a l C a g n i n i f e d  Script 6.1 continued     Print a message specific to a  language.  switch  $language  {  case ‘Dutch’:  echo ‘Hello, wereld!’; break;  case ‘French’:  echo ‘Bonjour, monde!’; break;  case ‘German’:  echo ‘Hallo, Welt!’; break;  case ‘Italian’:  echo ‘Ciao, mondo!’; break;  case ‘Spanish’:  echo ‘¡Hola, mundo!’; break;  case ‘English’: default:  echo ‘Hello, world!’; break;  }    End of switch.     Close the HTML paragraph. echo ‘ ’;  }    End of say_hello   function.  }    End of HelloWorld class.  ?>  17  18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48  238   Basic Object-Oriented Programming  6. Complete the say_hello   method.  echo ‘ ’;  } You just need to close the HTML para- graph tag.  7. Complete the class and the PHP page.  } ?>  8. Save the file as HelloWorld.php.  You’ve now created your first class. This isn’t, to be clear, a good use of OOP, but it starts the process and you’ll learn better implementations of the concept  in due time.  ✔ Tips    In PHP 4, attributes  class variables  were  identified using: var $variable_name; This is still supported in PHP 5, although not recommended unless you need to program for backward compatibility.    Class methods can also have a visibility,  by preceding the function definition with the appropriate keyword. If not stated, all methods have an assumed definition of public function function_name   {…    The class stdClass is already in use inter-  nally by PHP and cannot be declared in your own code.  D e f i n i n g a C l a s s        239      t c e j b O n a g n i t a e r C     Chapter 6  Creating an Object Using OOP is a two-step process. The first— defining a class—you just did when you wrote the HelloWorld class. The second step is to make use of that class by creating an object  or a class instance .  Going back to my Human class analogy, an instance of this class may be called Jude. Jude’s attributes are a gender of male, a height of about 50 inches, a weight of 65 pounds, and a birth date of November 15, 1998. Jude is one instance of the Human class and, as you may have noticed, is also a child. A second instance, Kelsey, has a female gen- der, a height of 5 feet, a weight of 90 pounds, and a birth date of April 11, 1996. Both Jude and Kelsey are separate objects derived from the same class. They are similar in theory, different in actuality.  Creating an object is remarkably easy in PHP once you’ve defined your class. It involves the keyword new: $object = new ClassName  ;  Now the variable $object exists and is of type ClassName  instead of type string or array .  To call the methods of the class, you use this syntax: $object->method_name  ;  If a method takes arguments, you would use: $object->method_name ‘value’, 32, true ;  Once you’ve finished with an object, you can delete it as you would any variable: unset $object ;  Simple enough! Let’s go ahead and quickly make use of the HelloWorld class.  240   Script 6.2 In this page, PHP uses the defined class in order to say Hello, world! in several different languages.  To create an object: 1.

This PHP page will include  all of the code necessary to make a valid XHTML page.  2. Include the class definition.  require_once  ‘HelloWorld.php’ ; In order to create an instance of a class, the PHP script must have access to that class definition. As the definition is stored in a separate file, that file must be included here. By using require_once    as opposed to include_once   , the script will stop executing with a fatal error if the file could not be included  and there really is no point in continu- ing without this file .  continues on next page  241     C r e a t i n g a n O b j e c t      Chapter 6  3. Create the object.  $obj = new HelloWorld  ; This one line of code is all there is to it! You can name the object variable any- thing you’d like, of course.  4. Invoke the say_hello   method.  $obj->say_hello  ; This line of code will call the say_hello   method, which is part of the $obj object. Since the method is not being given any arguments, the greeting will be in the default language of English.  5. Say hello in a few more languages.  $obj->say_hello ‘Italian’ ; $obj->say_hello ‘Dutch’ ; $obj->say_hello ‘French’ ; An object’s methods can be called  multiple times, like any other function. Different arguments are provided to  vary the result.  6. Delete the object and complete   the page. unset $obj ; ?>     You don’t technically have to delete the object, as it will be deleted as soon as the script ends. Still, I think it’s better pro- gramming form to tidy up like this.     t c e j b O n a g n i t a e r C     242  Analyzing the   HelloWorld Example  As I state in the first section of this  chapter, OOP is both syntax and theory. For this first example, the HelloWorld class, the emphasis is on the syntax. Hopefully you can already see that this isn’t great use of OOP. But why? Well, it’s both too specific and too simple. Having an object print one string is a very focused idea, whereas classes should be much more abstract. It also makes absolutely no sense to use all this code—and the extra memory required—for one echo statement. It’s nice that the object han- dles different languages, but still…  The HelloWorld class does succeed in a couple of ways, though. It does demon- strate some of the syntax. And it is reusable: if you have a project that needs to say Hello, world! dozens of times, this one object will do it. And if you need to change it to Hello, World!  with a capital “W” , edit just the one file and you’re golden. Finally, this class kind of reflects the notion of encapsulation: you can  use the object to say Hello, world! in mul- tiple languages without any knowledge of how the class does that.   Figure 6.1 The resulting Web page  the examples will get better, I promise .  Basic Object-Oriented Programming  7. Save the file as hello_object.php and place it in your Web directory, along  with HelloWorld.php. You don’t have to place both documents in the same directory, but if they are stored separately, you would need to change the require_once   line accordingly.  8. Test hello_object.php by viewing it in  your Web browser  Figure 6.1 . Note that you should run hello_ object.php, not HelloWorld.php in your Web browser.  ✔ Tips    Class names are not case-sensitive.  However, object names, like any variable in PHP, are case-sensitive.    Because function names in PHP are   not case-sensitive, the same is true for method names in classes.     C r e a t i n g a n O b j e c t     243   Script 6.3 This class is much more rounded than the HelloWorld example. It contains two attributes—for storing the rectangle’s width and height—and four methods.  1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  25 26  27 28  <?php  Script 6.3 - Rectangle.php  This page defines the Rectangle  The class contains two attributes:  The class contains four methods:  - set_size   - get_area   - get_perimeter   - is_square     * class. * width and height. * * * * * *   class Rectangle {     Declare the attributes: public $width = 0; public $height = 0;     Method to set the dimensions. function set_size $w = 0, $h = 0  {  $this->width = $w; $this->height = $h;  area.  }  }     Method to calculate and return the  function get_area   {  return  $this->width *   $this->height ;   script continues on next page   e t u b i r t t A s i h t $ e h T        Chapter 6  The $this Attribute The HelloWorld class does actually do  something, which is nice, but it’s a fairly minimal example. The class does include a method, but it does not contain any attrib- utes  variables .  As I mention in the section “Defining a Class,”  class attributes:  ◆ Are variables  ◆ Must be declared as public, private, or  protected  I’ll use only public in this chapter   ◆ If initialized, must be given a static value   not the result of an expression   Those are the rules for defining a class’s attrib- utes, but using those attributes requires one more piece of information. The problem is that there’s no easy way to access a class’s attributes within the methods. For example: class MyClass { public $var; function do   {     This won’t work: print $var;  The do   method cannot access $var like that. The solution is a special variable called $this. Within a method, you can refer to  the instance of a class and its attributes by using the $this->attribute_name syntax.  Rather than over-explaining this concept, it’d be best just to go right into another example putting this new knowledge into action. This next, much more practical, example will define a class representing a rectangle.  }  }  244   Script 6.3 continued  29  30 31  32 33 34  35 36 37 38  39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48     Method to calculate and return the  perimeter.  function get_perimeter   {  return    $this->width +   $this->height  * 2  ;  }     Method to determine if the  rectangle      is also a square. function is_square   {  if  $this->width == $this-  >height  {  return true;    Square  } else {  return false;    Not a square  }  }  ?>  }    End of Rectangle class.  Basic Object-Oriented Programming  To use the $this variable: 1. Create a new PHP document in your text  editor or IDE  Script 6.3 . <?php  Script 6.3 - Rectangle.php  2. Begin defining the class.  class Rectangle {  3. Declare the attributes.  public $width = 0; public $height = 0; This class has two attributes: one for the rectangle’s width and another for its height. Both are initialized to 0.  4. Create a method for setting the rectangle’s  dimensions. function set_size $w = 0, $h = 0  {  $this->width = $w; $this->height = $h;  } The set_size   method takes two argu- ments, corresponding to the width and height. Both have default values of 0, just to be safe. Within the method, the class’s attrib- utes are given values using the numbers to be provided when this method is called  assigned to $w and $h . Using $this->width and $this->height refers to this class’s $width and $height attributes.  continues on next page        T h e $ t h i s A t t r i b u t e  245   To use the Rectangle class: 1. Create a new PHP document in your text  editor or IDE, beginning with the stan- dard HTML  Script 6.4 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   Rectangle       <?php  Script 6.4 - rectangle1.php  2.

Create a method that calculates and  returns the rectangle’s area. function get_area   {  return  $this->width *   ➝ $this->height ; } This method doesn’t need to take any arguments, as it can access the class’s attributes via $this. Calculating the area of a rectangle is simple: multiply the width times the height. This value is then returned.  6. Create a method that calculates and  returns the rectangle’s perimeter. function get_perimeter   {  return    $this->width +   ➝ $this->height  * 2  ; } This method is like get_area  , except it uses a different calculation.  7. Create a final method that indicates if  the rectangle is also a square. function is_square   {  if  $this->width ==   ➝ $this->height  {  return true;  return false;  } else {  }  } This final method compares the rectan- gle’s dimensions. If they are the same, the Boolean true is returned, indicating the rectangle is a square. Otherwise, false is returned.  8. Complete the class and the PHP page.  9. Save the file as Rectangle.php.  } ?>  246   Script 6.4 The Rectangle class is used in this PHP script. The rectangle’s dimensions are first assigned to the class’s attributes by invoking the set_size   method, and then various properties of the rectangle are reported.

Create the object and assign the rectan-  gle’s dimensions. $r = new Rectangle  ; $r->set_size $width, $height ; The first line creates an object of type Rectangle. The second line assigns the values of the variables in this script— $width and $height—to the object’s attributes. The values here are assigned to $w and $h in the set_size   method when it’s called, which are then assigned to $this->width and $this->height with- in that method.  5. Print the rectangle’s area.  echo ‘ The area of the rectangle is ➝ ‘ . $r->get_area   . ‘ ’; To print the rectangle’s area, you only need to have the object tell you what that value is by referring to the get_area   method. As this method returns the area  instead of printing it , it can be used in an echo statement like this.  6. Print the rectangle’s perimeter. echo ‘ The perimeter of the ➝ rectangle is ‘ .  ➝ $r->get_perimeter   . ‘ ’; This is a variation on the code in Step 5.  e t u b i r t t A s i h t $ e h T        248  Analyzing the   Rectangle Example  The Rectangle class as defined isn’t per- fect, but it’s pretty good, if I do say so myself. It encapsulates all the things you might want to do with or know about a rectangle. The methods also only handle calculations and return values; no HTML is used within the class, which is a better way to design.  One criticism may be that the class is too specific. Logically, if you’re doing a lot of geometry, the Rectangle class might be an inherited class from a broader Shape.  From the first two examples you can see the benefit of objects: the ability to create your own data type. Whereas a string is a variable type whose only power is to con- tain characters, the Rectangle is a new, powerful type with all sorts of features.   Basic Object-Oriented Programming  7.  Indicate whether or not this rectangle is also a square. echo ‘ This rectangle is ‘; if  $r->is_square    {  echo ‘also’;  } else {  echo ‘not’;  } echo ‘ a square. ’; Since the is_square   method returns a Boolean value, I can invoke it as a condi- tion. This code will print either This rec- tangle is also a square. or This rectangle is not a square.  8. Delete the object and complete the page.  unset $r ; ?>      9.

Figure 6.3 Changing just the $width and $height values in the script results in all new calculations  compare with Figure 6.2 .  Figure 6.4 If the width and height are the same, the rectangle is also a square.   Chapter 6  ✔ Tips    Having get_ and set_ methods in a class is a common convention. Methods start- ing with set_ are used to assign values to class attributes. Methods starting with get_ are used to return values: either attributes or the results of calculations.    Methods can call each other, just as they would any other function. To do so, you’ll need to use $this again. The following is unnecessary but valid: function get_area   {  if  $this->is_square    {  return  $this->width * 2 ;  } else {  return  $this->width * ➝ $this->height ;  }  }    Suppose you do this:  $r1 = new Rectangle  ; $r1->set_size 10, 25 ; $r2 = $r1; Then $r1 and $r2 are objects with the same dimensions. But what if you  then do $r2->set_size 8, 40 ; Then $r2 is an object with different dimensions than $r1, and $r1 retains  its original values.  e t u b i r t t A s i h t $ e h T        250   Basic Object-Oriented Programming  Creating Constructors A constructor is a special kind of method that differs from standard ones in two ways:  ◆ Its name is always __construct  .  ◆ It is automatically and immediately  called whenever an object of that class is created.  The syntax for defining a constructor is therefore: class ClassName {  public $var; function __construct   {     Function code.  }  }  A constructor could be used to connect to  a database, set cookies, or establish initial values. Basically you’ll use constructors to do whatever should always be done  and done first  when an object of this class is made.  Because the constructor is still just another method, it can take arguments, and values for those arguments can be provided when the object is created: class Human {  function __construct $name  {     Function code.  }  } $me = new Human ‘Henry’ ;  The Rectangle class could benefit from hav- ing a constructor that assigns the rectangle’s dimensions when the rectangle is created.  251     C r e a t i n g C o n s t r u c t o r s   Chapter 6  To add and use a constructor: 1. Open Rectangle.php  Script 6.3  in your  text editor or IDE.  2. After declaring the attributes and before defining the set_size   method, add the constructor  Script 6.5 . function __construct $w = 0, $h = 0  {  $this->width = $w; $this->height = $h;  } This method is exactly like the set_size   method, albeit with a  different name. Note that constructors are normally the first method defined  in a class  but still defined after the attributes .  Script 6.5 A constructor has been added to the Rectangle class. This makes it possible to assign the rectangle’s dimensions when the object is created.  1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  <?php  Script 6.5 - Rectangle.php  The class contains two attributes:  This page defines the Rectangle   * class. * width and height. * * * * * * * *   The class contains four methods:  - set_size   - get_area   - get_perimeter   - is_square   In this new version of the class, a constructor is also present.  class Rectangle {     Declare the attributes: public $width = 0; public $height = 0;     Constructor: function __construct $w = 0, $h = 0   {  $this->width = $w; $this->height = $h;  }  }     Method to set the dimensions. function set_size $w = 0, $h = 0  {  $this->width = $w; $this->height = $h;   script continues on next page   s r o t c u r t s n o C g n i t a e r C     252   Basic Object-Oriented Programming  3.

Delete the invocation of the set_size    method. This method is still part of the class, though, which makes sense. By keeping it in there, a rectangle object’s size can be changed after the object is created.  8. Save the file as rectangle2.php, place it  in your Web directory along with the new Rectangle.php  Script 6.5 , and test in your Web browser  Figure 6.5 .    A constructor like the one just added to  the Rectangle class is called a default constructor, as it provides default values for its arguments. This means that a Rectangle object can be created using either of these techniques: $r = new Rectangle $width, $height ; $r = new Rectangle  ;    You can, although rarely do, call a   constructor: $o = new SomeClass  ; $o->__construct  ; With the Rectangle example, this would let you get rid of the set_size   method without losing the ability to resize a  rectangle.    In PHP 4 and in other programming  languages  like C++ , a constructor is declared by creating a method whose name is the same as the class itself. So  in PHP 4, the Rectangle class would  have a constructor named Rectangle  .    If PHP 5 cannot find a __construct    method in a class, it will then try to find a constructor whose name is the same as the class  the PHP 4 constructor naming scheme .  255     C r e a t i n g C o n s t r u c t o r s   Chapter 6  Creating Destructors The corollary to the constructor is the destructor. Whereas a constructor is auto- matically invoked when an object is created, the destructor is called when the object is destroyed. This may occur when you overtly remove the object: $obj = new ClassName  ; unset $obj ;  Or this may occur when a script ends  at which point PHP releases the memory used by variables .  Being the smart reader that you are, you have probably already assumed that the destructor is created like so: class ClassName {  function __destruct   {    Function code.  }  }  Destructors do differ from constructors and other methods in that they cannot take any arguments.  The Rectangle class used in the last two examples doesn’t lend itself to a logical destructor  there’s nothing you need to do when you’re done with a rectangle . And rather than do a potentially confusing but practical example, I’ll run through a dummy example that shows how and when con- structors and destructors are called.  s r o t c u r t s e D g n i t a e r C     Script 6.7 This script doesn’t do anything except best convey when constructors and destructors are called.  1  2  3  4 5  6  7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  25 26  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD   xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  content=”text html; charset= iso-8859-1”  >   Constructors and  Destructors      <?php  Script 6.7 - demo.php  This page defines a Demo class and a demo   function.

Create the destructor.  function __destruct   {  echo ‘ In the  ➝ destructor. ’;  }  5. Complete the class.  } It’s a very simple class!  6. Define a simple function that also   creates an object. function demo    {  echo ‘ In the function.  ➝ Creating a new object... ’;  $f = new Demo  ; echo ‘ About to leave the  ➝ function. ’; } To best illuminate the life of objects, which affects when constructors and destructors are called, I’m adding this simple function. It prints messages and creates its own object, which will be local to this function.  7. Create an object of class Demo.  echo ‘ Creating a new ➝ object... ’; $o = new Demo  ; When this object is created, the con- structor will be called.

Creating a new object... will first be printed. Then, in that function, a new object is created  called $f . Therefore, the constructor will be called again, and the In the constructor. message printed. After the object is created in the func- tion, the About to leave the function. message is printed. Then the function is exited, at which point in time the object defined in the function—$f—goes away, thus invoking the $f object’s destructor, printing In the destructor.  9. Delete the $o object.  echo ‘ About to delete the ➝ object... ’; unset $o ; Once this object is deleted, its destruc- tor is invoked.  10. Complete the page.  echo ‘ End of the script. ’; ?>      11. Save the file as demo.php and place it in your Web directory, and test by viewing it in your Web browser  Figure 6.6 .  12. Delete the unset $o  line, save the file,  and rerun it in your Web browser  Figure 6.7 . Also check the HTML source code of this page  Figure 6.8  to really under- stand the flow.  ✔ Tip    In C++ and C, the destructor’s name  for the class ClassName is ~ClassName, the corollary of the constructor, which  is ClassName. Java does not support destructors.  259     C r e a t i n g D e s t r u c t o r s  Figure 6.7 If you don’t forcibly delete the object  demonstrated by Figure 6.6 , it will be deleted when the script stops running. This means that the $o object’s destructor is called after the final printed message, even after the closing HTML tags  Figure 6.8 .  Figure 6.8 The $o object’s destructor is called as the very last script event, when the script stops running. Thus, the In the destructor. messages gets sent to the browser after the closing HTML tag.   Chapter 6  Autoloading Classes With OOP, a logical way to modularize the files in an application is to place each class definition in its own file. You’ve now done this with both the HelloWorld and Rectangle classes. In these examples, the class file has to be required by the script that needs to create an object of that type: require_once ‘Rectangle.php’ ; $r = new Rectangle 43, 902 ;  When including just one class file, this isn’t much of a hardship, but as your programs use more and more objects, including all the requisite files can become very tedious. The developers behind PHP, big brains that they are, added a simple work-around to the tire- some process of always including class defi- nition files.  PHP 5 supports a special function called _ _ autoload  note that functions in PHP beginning with two underscores are special ones . The __autoload   function is invoked when an object is requested of a class that hasn’t yet been defined. You define how this function works in your scripts. In simplest form, this would be: function __autoload  $class  {  require_once $class . ‘.php’ ;  }     s e s s a l C g n i d a o l o t u A  Script 6.8 An __autoload   function is added to the script so that class definition files, such as Rectangle, don’t have to be individually required.  1  2  3  4 5  6 7 8 9 10 11  12  13 14  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD   xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  content=”text html; charset= iso-8859-1”  >   Rectangle       <?php  Script 6.8 - rectangle3.php  This page uses the revised Rectangle   * class. * information * * __autoload  . *   This page shows a bunch of  about a rectangle This version incorporates     Define the __autoload   function: function __autoload  $class  {  require_once $class . ‘.php’ ;  }     Define the necessary variables: $width = 56; $height = 1475;   script continues on next page   260   Script 6.8 continued  25 26 27  28 29 30 31 32 33  34 35 36  37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52     Print a little introduction: echo “ With a width of $width and a height of $height... ”;     Create a new object: $r = new Rectangle $width, $height ;     Print the area. echo ‘ The area of the rectangle is ‘ . $r->get_area   . ‘ ’;     Print the perimeter. echo ‘ The perimeter of the rectangle is ‘ . $r->get_perimeter   . ‘ ’;     Is this a square? echo ‘ This rectangle is ‘; if  $r->is_square    {  echo ‘also’;  } else {  echo ‘not’;  } echo ‘ a square. ’;     Delete the object: unset $r ;  ?>      Basic Object-Oriented Programming  For each new object type created in the fol- lowing code, the function will be invoked: $obj = new Class  ; $me = new Human  ; $r = new Rectangle  ;  Thanks to the __autoload   function,  those three lines will automatically include Class.php, Human.php, and Rectangle.php  within the current directory .  Notice that this __autoload   function is defined outside of any class; instead, it is placed in a script that instantiates the objects. To autoload class definition files:  1. Open rectangle2.php  Script 6.6  in   your text editor or IDE.  2. Remove the require_once   line   Script 6.8 .  3. Add the definition of the __autoload    function. function __autoload  $class  {  require_once $class . ‘.php’ ;  }  4. If you want, change the values of the  $width and $height variables. $width = 56; $height = 1475;  continues on next page  A u t o l o a d i n g C l a s s e s     261   Chapter 6  5. Save the file as rectangle3.php, place   it in your Web directory along with Rectangle.php  Script 6.5 , and test in your Web browser  Figure 6.9 .  ✔ Tips    If you store your class definition files in their own directory, change the defini- tion of the __autoload   function to something like: function __autoload  $class  {  require_once ‘classes ’ .   ➝ $class . ‘.php’ ; }    Although class names in PHP are case- insensitive, some operating systems use case-sensitive file structures. If your class is called MyClass, then you’ll be better off naming the file exactly MyClass.php and creating objects using: $obj = new MyClass  ;  Figure 6.9 As with other OOP examples, incorporating features like the __autoload   function  see Script 6.8  has no bearing on the end result.     s e s s a l C g n i d a o l o t u A  262   7  Advanced  OOP  Chapter 6, “Basic Object-Oriented Programming,” covers the fundamental concepts of OOP in PHP. Those concepts include: defining a class, creating an object, accessing class attributes  variables  using $this, creating constructors, and creating destructors. A fair amount of theory is also discussed there, as that’s half the OOP battle. Complete comfort with the contents of that chapter is a prerequisite for this one.  Here, things get more advanced  hence the chapter title! , really getting into the more abstract aspects of OOP. Again, ample time will be given to theory. Almost all of the dozen-ish topics discussed herein involve inheritance. Fully understanding inheritance is crucial. Some of the topics get to be rather esoteric, and the need for implementing such features may not be apparent at first. My best recommendation is not to over- whelm yourself with the material in this chapter. Take little bites and chew the mate- rial thoroughly. Forging ahead in the hopes that it’ll all make sense eventually will only make matters worse  I think  as each new advanced idea is added to the pile. All that being said, don’t be too afraid. Advanced object-oriented programming isn’t the scariest programming technique you’ll encounter, and you can begin to really see the beauty of OOP on this higher level.  A d v a n c e d O O P     263   Chapter 7  Advanced Theories I want to begin this chapter with a brief dis- cussion of a few key concepts in advanced OOP. Chapter 6 introduced some of the basic terms: class, object, modularity, and abstraction. A few more were also refer- enced: inheritance, overriding, encapsulation, and visibility. Of these latter four notions, all of which arise in this chapter, inheritance is far and away the most important in advanced object-oriented programming.  Object inheritance is where one class is derived from another, just as humans inherit qualities from their parents. Of course, the “qualities” in the object-oriented world are attributes  variables  and methods  functions . Through inheritance, you can define one class that is born with the same attributes and methods as another  Figure 7.1 . The inherited child class can even have its own unique qualities that the parent doesn’t have  Figure 7.2 .  But inheritance isn’t a simple one-to-one relationship. There’s no limit to how many times inheritance can occur: multiple classes can inherit from the same parent  Figure 7.3  or a class can be a child of a child  Figure 7.4 . This speaks to the powerful reusablity of class code.  Once you’ve defined a class that inherits from another, it doesn’t take long to start thinking how nice it’d be if it behaved just slightly dif- ferently. You can add new attributes and methods, but what if you wanted to change the behavior of the parent class’s methods? It would be wrong to change the definition of the parent class  presumably it works as it should, and besides, other classes might inherit from it too, as shown in Figure 7.3 . Instead, you can override a parent class’s method to customize it for the new class. This is polymorphism: where calling the same  264     s e i r o e h T d e c n a v d A  Figure 7.1 A child class inherits  i.e., has  all  of the attributes and methods of its parent class  there can be exceptions to this, but assume this to be true  for now .  Figure 7.2 Child classes can add their own members to the ones they inherited. In this way a child can separate itself  functionally speaking  from its parent.   Advanced OOP  method can have different results, depending upon the object type. This probably doesn’t mean much yet, but you’ll understand in time.  Acknowledging  as I just did  that it’s not a good thing for one class to muck around in another, the concept of visibility exists. Visibility controls what qualities of a class can be accessed or altered by other classes  or even outside of any class .  As you can tell already, once you introduce inheritance, the OOP world expands expo- nentially. Just as in the last chapter, I’ll attempt to go through this sea of informa- tion slowly, to make sure that it really settles in. Some of the examples will be designed for illumination of a concept, rather than real-world implementations  Chapter 8, “Real-World OOP,” works toward that end .  Inheritance Terminology  With class definitions, the main terms are attributes and methods, meaning vari- ables and functions, respectively. You’ll also see properties used instead of attrib- utes, but both refer to a class’s variables. The combination of attributes and meth- ods make up the members of a class.  With inheritance you have a parent class and a child class: the latter is inherited from the former. You’ll also see these described as a base class or superclass and its derived class or subclass.  265  A d v a n c e d T h e o r i e s     Figure 7.3 A single parent class can have unlimited offspring, each customized in its own way.  Figure 7.4 Inheritance can theoretically have limitless depth, with each child inheriting all the members of its parent  again, not always so, but… .   Chapter 7  Inheriting Classes One of the ways in which objects make  programming faster is the ability to use  one class definition as the basis for another. From there, the second class can add its  own attributes  variables  and methods  functions . This is referred to as inheritance.  Going back to the Human example introduced in Chapter 6, if the Human class has the attrib- utes gender, height, weight, and birth date and it has the methods eating and sleeping, you could create another class called Adult that is an extension of Human. Along with  the aforementioned variables and functions, an Adult object might also have the attrib- ute of married and the method of working  Figure 7.5 .  To make a child class from a parent, you use the extends statement. Assuming you have already defined the ClassName class, you can create a child like so: class ChildClass extends ClassName { }  The class ChildClass will possess all the members of its parent, ClassName. Now you can modify this class to adapt it to your spe- cific needs without altering the original class. Ideally, once you’ve created a solid parent class, you will never need to modify it again and can use child classes to tailor the code to your individual requirements.  For an example implementation of this, I’ll start with a silly  but comprehensible  pets example. Say you have two pets: a cat and a dog. Both animals have a name, and they both eat and sleep. Cats differ from dogs in that they can climb trees and dogs differ from cats in that they can fetch. Being able to describe these qualities and relationships in plain language leads to the inheritance structure you would create  Figure 7.6 .  266     s e s s a l C g n i t i r e h n I  Figure 7.5 The Adult class can have all the same members as Human, while adding  its own.  Figure 7.6 How the pet-cat-dog relationship would be implemented objectively.

Start declaring the Pet class.  class Pet {  public $name;  3. Create the constructor.  function __construct $pet_name  {  $this->name = $pet_name;  } The constructor takes one argument: the name of the pet. This gets assigned to the class’s $name attribute. 4. Define the eat   method.  function eat   {  echo “ $this->name is  ➝ eating. ”; } This method simply reports the name of the animal eating.  5. Define the go_to_sleep   method and  complete the class.  function go_to_sleep   {  echo “ $this->name is  ➝ sleeping. ”;  }  }    End of Pet class. This function could be named sleep  , but there’s already a PHP function with that same name.

Declare the Cat class.  class Cat extends Pet { function climb   {  ➝ climbing. ”;  }    End of Cat class. The Cat class extends Pet, meaning that it has all the attributes and methods of Pet. Added to those is one new method, climb  . The method can refer to the $name attribute via $this->name because the attribute is also part of this class  thanks to inheritance .  7.

Save the file as pets1.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 7.7 .  ✔ Tips    In this example, you could create an object of type Pet. That object would have a name and could eat   and go_to_sleep  , but it could not fetch   or climb  .    You cannot create a child class that  inherits fewer properties than its parent. In fact, if that was something you were hoping to do, then the design of the child and the parent should be switched. As classes are extended, they should contain more features, never fewer.    You can determine the parent class of an  object using PHP’s get_parent_class   function, a companion to the get_class   function. These two are part of a handful of functions PHP has for getting information about classes.     s e s s a l C g n i t i r e h n I  270   Figure 7.8 When an object is created, PHP will always call the constructor of that object’s class type.  Advanced OOP  Inheriting Constructors and Destructors The pets example shows how you can  create one class  i.e., Pet  and then  derive other classes from it  Dog and Cat . These other classes can have their own methods, unique to themselves, such as climb   and fetch  .  Two methods are common to many classes: constructors and destructors  see Chapter 6 for a detailed description . The Pet class has a constructor but no need for a destructor. What would happen, then, if Cat or Dog also had a constructor? By definition, this method is always called __construct  . How does PHP determine which to call when?  As a rule, PHP will always call the constructor for the class just instantiated  Figure 7.8 . The same rule applies for destructors.  This next, somewhat more practical, example will extend the Rectangle class  Script 6.5, defined in Chapter 6  to create a Square class  because all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares .

Declare the Square class.  class Square extends Rectangle {  function __construct $side = 0   {  }  $this->width = $side; $this->height = $side;  } The premise is simple: there’s no reason to have to pass both a height and a width value to the Rectangle class when you know you’re creating a square. So a new constructor is defined that only takes one argument. That value will be assigned, within the constructor, to the parent class’s attributes. Note that in order for this class exten- sion to work, it must be able to access the Rectangle definition  so that file must be included prior to this point .  4. Create a rectangle and report on it.  $width = 21; $height = 98; echo “ With a width of $width and ➝ a height of $height... ”; $r = new Rectangle $width, $height ; echo ‘ The area of the rectangle ➝ is ‘ . $r->get_area   . ‘ ’; echo ‘ The perimeter of the ➝ rectangle is ‘ . $r- ➝ >get_perimeter   . ‘ ’; This code is also from Chapter 6. It just creates a rectangle and prints its area and perimeter.  274        s r o t c u r t s e D d n a s r o t c u r t s n o C g n i t i r e h n I     Inheritance Theory  Any time one class inherits from another, the result should be a more specific descrip- tion of a thing. Hence, I go from Pet to Dog or Cat and from Rectangle to Square. When deciding where to place methods, including constructors and destructors, you have to think about whether that functionality is universal or specific.  In the Pet example, the constructor sets the pet’s name, which is universal for all pets. So the Dog and Cat classes don’t need their own constructors. In the Rectangle example, its constructor sets the height and width. But a square doesn’t have both, so having a new constructor for it is valid.   Figure 7.9 Even though the Square constructor only takes one argument  Script 7.2 , the use of the Rectangle methods, and the end result, work just the same.  Advanced OOP  5. Repeat Step 4 for a square.  $side = 60; echo “ With each side being ➝ $side... ”; $s = new Square $side ; echo ‘ The area of the square  ➝ is ‘ . $s->get_area   . ‘ ’; echo ‘ The perimeter of the square ➝ is ‘ . $s->get_perimeter   . ➝ ‘ ’; This code differs from that in Step 4 in that only one value needs to be passed to the Square constructor. Then all the other methods can be called just the same.  6. Complete the page.  unset $r, $s ; ?>      7. Save the file as square.php, place it in  your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 7.9 .     I n h e r i t i n g C o n s t r u c t o r s a n d D e s t r u c t o r s        275   Figure 7.10 shows the result of the preced- ing code.  Overriding methods is a common and useful feature of advanced object-oriented program- ming. As a simple example of this, I’ll return to the Pet, Dog, and Cat classes. Instead of having separate climb   and fetch   meth- ods, that functionality will be implemented as an overridden play   method.  Chapter 7  Overriding Methods So far I’ve covered how one class can inherit from another class and how the child classes can have their own new methods. The last example demonstrated that subclasses can even define their own constructors  and destructors, implicitly , which will be used  in lieu of the parent class’s constructors and destructors. This same thinking can be applied to the other class methods. This  concept is called overriding a method.  To achieve this in PHP, the subclass must define a method with the exact same name and number of arguments as the parent class: class SomeClass {  function scream $count = 1  {  for  $i = 0; $i < $count; $i++  {  echo ‘Eek! ’;  } class SomeOtherClass extends SomeClass{  function scream $count = 1  {  for  $i = 0; $i < $count; $i++  {  echo ‘Whohoo! ’;     s d o h t e M g n i d i r r e v O  }  }  }  }  276  } $obj1 = new SomeClass  ; $obj1->scream  ; $obj1->scream 2 ; $obj2 = new SomeOtherClass  ; $obj2->scream  ; $obj2->scream 2 ;  Figure 7.10 When related classes have overridden methods, which method is called depends upon the type of the object calling it. Note that for $obj2, the code of the overridden scream   method in SomeOtherClass is used in lieu of the original scream    hence the different scream in the last three lines .   To override methods: 1. Open pets1.php  Script 7.1  in your text  editor or IDE.  2. Add a play   method to the Pet class   Script 7.3 . function play   {  ➝ playing. ”; }  echo “ $this->name is  Advanced OOP  This is the method that will be overrid- den. It just prints the name of the pet that is playing.  3. In the Cat class, change the name of  climb   to play  . Now the Pet class’s play   method has been overridden in the Cat class.  continues on page 279  Script 7.3 The Cat and Dog classes override the Pet play   method, giving it new functionality. Which version of play   gets called depends upon the type of the object calling it.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">          Pets   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44      <?php  Script 7.3 - pets2.php  This page defines and uses the Pet, Cat, and Dog classes.    * * *    *******************   ***** CLASSES *****   The class contains one attribute: name.

The exception is if a function is defined as final: final function myfunc    {…}  A final method’s definition cannot be altered by any subclass.  A class can also be declared final, mean- ing that it cannot be extended.   Chapter 7  9. Also unset the $pet object toward the  end of the script. unset $dog, $cat, $pet ;  10. Save the file as pets2.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 7.11 .  ✔ Tips    The combination of a function’s name  and its arguments  the number of argu- ments, specifically  is referred to as the function’s signature. In PHP 5, except for constructors, any derived class must use the same signature when overriding a method.    The Square class could logically override  the Rectangle is_square   method. It would be defined as simply: function is_square   {  return true;  }    Overriding a method in such a way   that it also takes a different number of arguments than the original is referred to as overloading a method. This can be accomplished in PHP but not as easily  as overriding one. One option is to add dummy  unused  arguments to one method  the original or the derived  so that they both have the same number. The second option is to use PHP’s  magic __call   method to emulate  overloading.     s d o h t e M g n i d i r r e v O  280  Figure 7.11 The end result isn’t that much different from Figure 7.7, although cat- specific and dog-specific play   methods were introduced. A third object, of type Pet, was also added.   Figure 7.12 The more restricted the visibility, the smaller the realm where the attribute or method is accessible.  Advanced OOP  Access Control Access control, which is also called visibility, dictates how accessible a class’s properties and methods are. There are three levels of visibility: public, protected, and private. To establish the visibility of an attribute, prefix the variable’s declaration with one of these keywords: class ClassName {  public $var1 = ‘Hello’; private $var2 = ‘world’; protected $var3 = 234;  }  You’ve already been doing this, in making everything public thus far.  To establish the visibility of a method, prefix the function’s declaration with one of these keywords: class ClassName {  public function my_function   {     Function code.  }  }  Methods lacking the accessibility declaration are considered to be public. And because methods often are public, the visibility for them is frequently omitted.  Think of each term as prescribing a more limited circle in which the member can be accessed  Figure 7.12 . A public member is accessible everywhere: in the class itself, in inherited classes, in other classes, and in scripts without using objects. Protected members can only be accessed within the class and derived subclasses. Private is the most restrictive; those members are only accessible within the class that defines them.  continues on next page  281     A c c e s s C o n t r o l   Chapter 7  As with most concepts in OOP, there are two issues: how it works and how you’d use it. To make clear how access control works, I’ll run through a dummy example that just plays around with the accessibility of attributes. How you’d use visibility will become clearer as you see other examples. To control member access: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE, starting with the HTML  Script 7.4 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   Visibility       <?php  Script 7.4 - visibility.php  continues on page 284  Script 7.4 This script demonstrates access control by showing what can and cannot be done with attributes of different visibility.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">          Visibility   l o r t n o C s s e c c A     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37      <?php  Script 7.4 - visibility.php  This page defines and uses the Test and LittleTest classes.    * * *    *******************   ***** CLASSES *****   The class contains three attributes: - public $public - protected $protected - private $private The class defines one method: print_var  .   * Class Test. * * * * * *  class Test {     Declare the attributes: public $public = 'public'; protected $protected = 'protected'; private $private = 'private';     Function for printing a variable's value: function print_var $var  {  echo " In Test, \$$var equals '{$this->$var}'.

Begin declaring the Test class.  class Test {  public $public = ‘public’; protected $protected =  ➝ ‘protected’;  private $private = ‘private’;  This class contains three attributes, one of each type. To make things even more obvious, the name and value of each attribute match its visibility.  3. Add a print_var   method and complete  the class.  function print_var $var  {  echo “ In Test, \$$var  ➝ equals ‘{$this->$var}’. ”;  }  }    End of Test class. The print_var   method prints the value of a variable whose name it receives as an argument. It will print the attribute’s name and value out like this: In Test, $public equals ‘public’. The \$$var will end up printing a dollar sign followed by the value of $var  the argument . The $this->$var code will be evaluated as $this->public, $this->pro- tected, and $this->private so that it can access the class attributes.  4. Create a class that extends Test.  class LittleTest extends Test { function print_var $var  {  echo “ In LittleTest,  ➝ \$$var equals ‘{$this->$var}’. ➝  ”;  }  }  284  l o r t n o C s s e c c A     The instanceof Keyword  The instanceof keyword can be used to see if a particular object is of a certain class type. if  $obj instanceof SomeClass  { …  Notice that you don’t put the class’s name in quotation marks. Also—and this is important—if the object is not an instance of the given class, the entire script termi- nates. For a less drastic result, you could use the is_a   function: if  is_a $obj, ‘SomeClass’   {…  There’s also the is_subclass_of   function.   Figure 7.13 Public variables can be accessed, and modified, anywhere.  Advanced OOP  The LittleTest class, as an extension of Test, will inherit its own $public and $protected attributes. It will not have the $private attribute, as that variable’s visi- bility is private, meaning it cannot be inherited. This class will override the print_var   method, changing the printed text slightly.  5. Create an object of each type.  $parent = new Test  ; $child = new LittleTest  ;  6. Print the current value of the $public  variable by calling the print_var   method. echo ‘ Public ’; echo ‘ Initially... ’; $parent->print_var ‘public’ ; $child->print_var ‘public’ ; Because the $public variable is public,  it can be accessed by either class’s print_var   method.  7. Modify the Test $public attribute and  reprint. echo ‘ Modifying $parent- ➝ >public... ’; $parent->public = ‘modified’; $parent->print_var ‘public’ ; $child->print_var ‘public’ ; Because $public has public visibility, it can be accessed  and therefore modified  anywhere. Figure 7.13 shows the result of running this script so far. You should note that these lines only change the value of $public in $parent. The $child object’s $public variable still has the orig- inal value  because the $public attribute is represented as a separate entity in each class .  continues on next page  285     A c c e s s C o n t r o l   Figure 7.14 Attempting to modify the value of the protected variable using the syntax $obj->var results in a fatal error  which is bad .  Chapter 7  8. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 for the protected  variable. echo ‘  Protected ’; echo ‘ Initially... ’; $parent->print_var ‘protected’ ; $child->print_var ‘protected’ ; echo ‘ Attempting to modify ➝ $parent->public... ’; $parent->protected = ‘modified’; $parent->print_var ‘protected’ ; $child->print_var ‘protected’ ; As you’ll see when you run this script  Figure 7.14 , you can access the $pro- tected variable from within either class. But you cannot access it  which also means you cannot modify it  from out- side the class. Doing so causes a fatal error.  9. Complete the page.  unset $parent, $child ; ?>     Ignore the rest of what you see in  Script 7.4 for now, as I’m working  you through a process!  l o r t n o C s s e c c A     286   Figure 7.15 Attempting to refer to $this->private within the LittleTest class—which is what happens when you call $child->print_var ‘private’ — creates a notice, as the class does not contain that attribute  because it neither inherited one nor defined one itself . As in Figure 7.14, attempting to refer to $parent->private results in a fatal error.  Advanced OOP  10. Save the file as visibility.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figures 7.13 and 7.14 . This is one of those rare times where  I actually want you to see the error,  so that you may better understand  visibility. A public class member can  be accessed anywhere, including outside of a class. A protected member can only be accessed in the class or in derived classes. Attempting to access the mem- ber elsewhere results in a fatal error. Thus, a protected class member is more insulated.  11. Comment out this line:  $parent->protected = ‘modified’; This is the line that caused the fatal error, so let’s make it inert.  12. Before unsetting the objects, repeat  Steps 6 and 7 for the private attribute. echo ‘  Private ’; echo ‘ Initially... ’; $parent->print_var ‘private’ ; $child->print_var ‘private’ ; echo ‘ Attempting to modify ➝ $parent->private... ’; $parent->private = ‘modified’; $parent->print_var ‘private’ ; $child->print_var ‘private’ ; To finalize this example, let’s look at where you can access private class  members.  13. Save the file and retest  Figure 7.15 . As you can see in the figure, not even the $child object, which is an instance of the inherited LittleTest class, can access $private. And the script cannot refer to $parent->private, which, again, causes a fatal error.  continues on next page  287     A c c e s s C o n t r o l   Chapter 7  ✔ Tips    Using access control to limit how a   class is used is encapsulation. Simply  put, encapsulation is the hiding of infor- mation  actual data or processes .  A good class is a usable entity without your necessarily knowing how it works internally.    Looking at the Pet class, its name attrib- ute should be made protected. It makes sense for the class and its subclasses to be able to access the name, but you shouldn’t be able to do this: $cat->name = ‘Fungo’; The same applies to the $width and $height attributes in Rectangle.    As I already mentioned, you can   restrict access to methods, but that’s  less common than restricting access  to attributes.    You should know that the LittleTest  class doesn’t actually need its own print_var   method. It can use the   public  print_var   in Test. Because of inheritance, LittleTest would have  a print_var  , just as it has a $public and a $protected.  l o r t n o C s s e c c A     288  Visibility Suggestions  The visibility.php script demonstrates the realms in which variously visible vari- ables can be accessed. It does not, how- ever, demonstrate how you would really use access control in your own classes. You’ll see that better in other examples in this chapter and the next. In the meantime, some quick tips:  Start by thinking of access control as a firewall between your class and everything else. Use visibility to prevent bugs and other inappropriate behavior  e.g., being able to change class attributes . Err on the side of making your classes too restrictive! If the restriction ends up being a problem, then adjust. Ask yourself: Are there meth- ods that should only ever get called by the class itself? Then make them protected or private. Also consider that most attrib- utes can be restricted, as the class’s methods can be used to access them.   Using the Scope Resolution Operator The scope resolution operator is the combi- nation of two colons together  :: . It’s used to specify to which class a member belongs  and avoiding confusion is often necessary with inherited classes that have the same attributes and methods .   Outside of a class, assuming the method is not protected or private, you could call a method directly using: ClassName::method_name  ;  The scope resolution operator can also be used within a class to refer to its own prop- erties and members. In that case, you would use the keyword self: class SomeClass {  function __construct   {  self::do  ;  } protected function do   {  echo ‘do!’;  }  }  Advanced OOP  In that code, self::do   is the same as using $this->do  .  To refer to a member of a parent class, use the keyword parent: class SomeOtherClass extends SomeClass{  function __construct   {  parent::do  ;  }  }   As a side note on understanding visibility, the do   function defined in SomeClass can only be called by other methods within SomeClass or by methods within inherited classes, because do   is defined as protected.   For the most part, you’ll use the scope reso- lution operator to access overridden mem- bers. You’ll also use it with static and con- stant members, two topics yet to be dis- cussed. As a simple demonstration of how you might use this, I’ll touch up the Pet, Dog, and Cat classes.  continues on next page           U s i n g t h e S c o p e R e s o l u t i o n O p e r a t o r     289   Chapter 7  To use the scope resolution operator: 1. Open pets2.php  Script 7.3  in your text  editor or IDE.  2. Modify the Pet constructor so that the animals immediately sleep  Script 7.5 . function __construct $pet_name  {  $this->name = $pet_name; self::go_to_sleep  ;  }  It seems that many animals go to sleep as one of the first things they do  and there is no go_to_bathroom   method! . By placing this new line in the construc- tor, the go_to_sleep   method will be called as soon as the object is created.  continues on page 293  Script 7.5 The scope resolution operator makes it easy to refer to overridden methods.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">          Pets      r o t a r e p O n o i t u l o s e R e p o c S e h t g n i s U           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36  290      <?php  Script 7.5 - pets3.php  This page defines and uses the Pet, Cat, and Dog classes.    * * *    *******************   ***** CLASSES *****   The class contains one attribute: name.

Modify the Cat play   method so that it  calls Pet play  . function play   {  parent::play  ; echo “ $this->name is  ➝ climbing. ”; } The play   method in the Pet and Cat classes do slightly different things. The Pet method says that the object is play- ing. The Cat method says specifically what kind of play. To have the functional- ity of both methods, call parent::play   within the Cat method.  4. Repeat Step 3 for the Dog class.  function play   {  parent::play  ; echo “ $this->name is  ➝ fetching. ”; }  5. Save the file as pets3.php, place it in your  Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 7.16 .  ✔ Tips    In the Pet class it would be more com- mon to see $this->go_to_sleep   than self::go_to_sleep  , but I was trying to demonstrate self:: versus parent::.    In PHP 4, you could access any class  member without objects using the scope resolution operator: ClassName::method_name  ; This worked in PHP 4 in part because it did not employ the concept of visibility. In PHP 5, only static members  a concept discussed next  can be referred to this way.  293           U s i n g t h e S c o p e R e s o l u t i o n O p e r a t o r     Figure 7.16 The modified code  Script 7.5  now calls the Pet play   method each time a Cat or Dog plays.    In Dog and Cat, you could also use the code Pet::play  . But by using parent::play  , you minimize the chance of future prob- lems should the class definitions change.    You will often see documentation use the ClassName::method_name   syntax. When you see this, it’s not suggesting that you should call the method this way, but rather that method_name   is part of ClassName.   Figure 7.17 A static variable in a function retains its value over multiple calls  in the same script .  Chapter 7  Creating Static Members Static class attributes are the class equivalent of static function variables  see Chapter 1, “Advanced PHP Techniques” . A static func- tion variable remembers its value each time a function is called: function test    { static $n = 1; echo “$n ”; $n++;  } test  ; test  ; test  ;  As Figure 7.17 shows, each call of the test   function increments the value of $n by one. If $n was not declared as static, each call to the function would print the number 1.  With static class attributes, the concept is just the same except that a static variable is remembered across all instances of that class  across all objects based upon the class . To declare a static attribute, use the static key- word after the visibility: class SomeClass {  public static $var = ‘value’;  }     s r e b m e M c i t a t S g n i t a e r C     294   Advanced OOP  Static variables differ from standard attrib- utes in that you cannot access them within the class using $this. Instead, you’ll use self, followed by the scope resolution operator  :: , followed by the variable name, with its initial dollar sign: class SomeClass {  public static $counter = 0; function __construct   {  self::$counter++  The preceding code creates a counter for how many objects of this class exist. Each time a new object is created: $obj = new SomeClass  ;  $counter goes up by one.  Static methods are created in much the same way: class SomeClass {  public static function do   {     Code.  }  }  }  }  But once defined, static methods cannot  be called using an object. You could never execute: $obj = new SomeClass  ; $obj->do  ;    NO!  Instead you would have to use: SomeClass::do  ;  To play this out, let’s create a new Pet class that uses a static attribute and a static method. The attribute will be used to count the number of pets in existence. The static method will return the number of pets. As this is a demonstration, no other methods will be created.  295     C r e a t i n g S t a t i c M e m b e r s     Class Constants  Class constants are like static attributes in that they are accessible to all instances of that class  or derived classes . But as with any other constant, the value can never change. Class constants are created using the const keyword, followed by the name of the constant  without a dollar sign , followed by the assignment opera- tor and the constant’s value: class SomeClass {  const PI = 3.14;  }  Constants can only be assigned a value like in that example. The value cannot be based upon another variable, and it can’t be the result of an expression or a func- tion call.  Constants, like static attributes, also can- not be accessed through the object. You cannot do: $obj->PI  or $obj::PI  But you can use ClassName::constant_ name  e.g., SomeClass::PI  anywhere. You can also use self::constant_name within the class’s methods.

Create the static method and complete  Chapter 7  class Pet {  protected $name; private static $count = 0;  The class still has the $name attribute,  but it’s now marked as protected so that only this and derived classes can access it. The $count variable, which is initial- ized as 0, is both private and static. By making it private, only this class can access it, which is smart, because you don’t want anything else to be able to adjust the counter. By making $count static, it retains its value for all instances of Pet or any derived classes.  3. Create the constructor.  function __construct $pet_name  {  $this->name = $pet_name; self::$count++;  } The constructor still assigns the name to the $name attribute, but now it also incre- ments the counter. Note the unique syn- tax for referring to a static attribute. Every time an object of type Pet or of a derived type is created, this constructor gets called. So for every qualifying object, $count is incremented. 4. Create the destructor.  function __destruct   {  self::$count--;  } Just as the constructor should increase the value of $count, the destructor should decrease it. Every time an object of a qualifying type  Pet or a derived class  is destroyed, this destructor is called.  298     s r e b m e M c i t a t S g n i t a e r C     the class.  public static function  ➝ get_count   {  return self::$count;  }  }    End of Pet class. The get_count   method is public and static. This means that it’s available to be called anywhere but cannot be called through an object. It returns the value of $count.  6. Create a Cat class.  class Cat extends Pet { } Since the focus here is on the static mem- bers, the derived classes don’t need to do anything.  7. Create a couple more subclasses.  class Dog extends Pet { } class Ferret extends Pet { } class PygmyMarmoset extends Pet { }  8. Create a new object and print the number  of pets. $dog = new Dog ‘Old Yeller’ ; echo ‘ After creating a Dog, I now ➝ have ‘ . Pet::get_count   . ‘ ➝ pet s . ’; When $dog is created, the Pet construc- tor is called, incrementing $count to 1.  To return this value, refer to Pet::get_count  . To avoid confusion, I’ll point out that the Pet constructor is called when making an object of Dog type because Dog does not have its own constructor.   Advanced OOP  9. Create a couple more pets. $cat = new Cat ‘Bucky’ ; echo ‘ After creating a Cat, I now ➝ have ‘ . Pet::get_count   . ‘ ➝ pet s . ’; $ferret = new Ferret ‘Fungo’ ; echo ‘ After creating a Ferret, I ➝ now have ‘ . Pet::get_count   . ‘ ➝ pet s . ’;  10. Have the unthinkable happen  my   condolences . unset $dog ; echo ‘ After tragedy strikes, I ➝ now have ‘ . Pet::get_count   . ‘ ➝ pet s . ’; When the Dog  or any other subclass  object is destroyed  here using unset   , the Pet destructor is invoked, subtract- ing 1 from $count.  Again, the Pet destructor is called because no derived class has its own destructor.   11. Recover by getting another pet.  $pygmymarmoset = new PygmyMarmoset ‘Toodles’ ; echo ‘ After creating a Pygmy ➝ Marmoset, I now have ‘ . ➝ Pet::get_count   . ‘ pet s . ’;  12. Complete the page.  unset $cat, $ferret, ➝ $pygmymarmoset ; ?>      13.

You would do so by adding parent::__construct   and parent::__destruct   to them.    Static methods are almost always public because they can’t be called through an object.   Chapter 7  Abstract Classes and Methods To wrap up the chapter, I’m going to intro- duce abstract classes and methods. Abstract classes are template versions of a parent class. By defining an abstract class, you can indicate the general behavior of a class. It starts with the keyword abstract: abstract class ClassName { }  Abstract classes differ from normal classes in that attempting to create an object of an abstract class’s type results in a fatal error  Figure 7.19 . Instead, abstract classes are meant to be extended, and then you create an instance of that extended class.  Abstract classes often have abstract meth- ods. These are defined like so: abstract function function_name  ; abstract function function_name $var1, ➝ $var2 ;  That’s it! You do not define the functionality of the method; instead, that functionality will be determined by the class that extends the abstract class. If you want to add visibili- ty to the definition, add the corresponding keyword after the word abstract: abstract public function function_name  ;  The implementation of the abstract method in the extended class must abide by the same visibility or weaker. If the abstract function is public, the extended version must also be public. The implemented version of the method must also have the same number of arguments as the abstract definition.  To put this into action, let’s return to geom- etry examples, like Rectangle. That class could be an extension of a more generic Shape class. Figure 7.20 shows just part of the Shape family tree. Let’s institute the Shape abstract class and its child, Triangle.        s d o h t e M d n a s e s s a l C t c a r t s b A     Figure 7.19 The fatal error created by trying to make an object of an abstract class.  Figure 7.20 The abstract Shape class can be the parent to many types of  two-dimensional  shapes.  300   Script 7.7 The abstract Shape class, with two abstract methods, will be the template for more specific shapes, like Triangle  Script 7.8 .  1 2 3  4 5  6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16  17  18 19  20  21 22 23 24  <?php  Script 7.7 - Shape.php  This page defines the Shape abstract  The class contains no attributes.

Start defining the Shape class.  abstract class Shape { Remember that when a class is abstract, it means you’ll never create an object  of that type. So you wouldn’t make an abstract Rectangle class because you do need to occasionally make rectangles.  3. Define the first abstract method.  abstract protected function ➝ get_area  ; This line says that any class that extends Shape needs to define a get_area   method. Furthermore, this method should not take any arguments and have either public or protected visibility  the same visibility or weaker . Defining this as an abstract method makes sense, as every two-dimensional shape should have the ability to calculate its own area  three-dimensional shapes have volumes, not areas .  4. Define the second abstract method.  abstract protected function ➝ get_perimeter  ;  5. Complete the class and the page.  }    End of Shape class. ?>  6.

It is therefore responsible for defining how the get_area   and get_perimeter   methods work.  Chapter 7  To create the Triangle class: 1. Begin a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 7.8 . <?php  Script 7.8 - Triangle.php  <?php  Script 7.8 - Triangle.php  This page defines the Triangle class.

Begin declaring the Triangle class. class Triangle extends Shape {  3. Declare the attributes.  private $sides = array  ; private $perimeter = NULL; The first attribute will store the size of the three sides  you could make three separate variables instead . The second will store the perimeter. I’m only adding this one because the perimeter will be used in calculating the area  a lot , so it’s nice to have it in a variable instead of retrieving it through a method call. All the attributes are private, as they shouldn’t be accessed outside of any class and I can’t imagine how a Triangle class would be inherited  in which case they may need to be protected .  4. Define the constructor.  function __construct $s0 = 0, $s1 = ➝ 0, $s2 = 0  {  $this->sides[] = $s0; $this->sides[] = $s1; $this->sides[] = $s2; $this->perimeter =  ➝ array_sum $this->sides ; } The constructor takes three arguments for the three sides of the triangle. Those values are placed in the $sides array,  and then the perimeter is calculated. The array_sum   function adds up all the ele- ments of an array.  continues on next page     A b s t r a c t C l a s s e s a n d M e t h o d s        303   Figure 7.21 To calculate the area of a triangle the easy way, you would need to know the height value.  Figure 7.22 Heron’s Formula says that the area of a triangle is equal to the square root of z times z minus a times z minus b times z minus c, where z is half the perimeter and a, b, and c are the three sides.  And no, I didn’t know this offhand, Mr. Friendly Internet helped out.   Chapter 7  5. Create the get_area   method. public function get_area   {  return  SQRT   $this->perimeter 2  *   $this->perimeter 2  -   ➝ $this->sides[0]  *    $this->perimeter 2  -   ➝ $this->sides[1]  *    $this->perimeter 2  -   ➝ $this->sides[2]     ;  } If you remember your geometry, you know that the area of a triangle is equal to one-half the base times the height  Figure 7.21 . Of course, to make that calculation, the class would need to determine the base  the longest side,  not a problem  and the height  requiring trigonometry, yikes! . So instead I’ll use the formula in Figure 7.22. This code implements that formula in PHP.  6. Create the get_perimeter   method. public function get_perimeter   {  return $this->perimeter;  } This is the second of the abstract meth- ods in Shape that must be implemented here. For this example, it simply returns the perimeter attribute. Had I not created a perimeter attribute, this method would instead return array_sum $this->sides .  7. Complete the class and the page.  }    End of Triangle class. ?>  8.

Similar in theory to abstract classes   are interfaces. Interfaces have an added advantage of allowing a derived class to inherit from multiple parent classes.     A b s t r a c t C l a s s e s a n d M e t h o d s        307   Chapter 7  Where to Go from Here  In this chapter I focus on the most important aspects of so-called advanced object-oriented programming. It all starts with inheritance, which is what you really need to master.  Although I formally discussed seven topics and included sidebars on many others, another entire chapter could be dedicated to “more advanced object-oriented programming.” But I strongly believe that you can’t go from little-to-no OOP knowledge to advanced OOP in just  a few chapters or even an entire book.  If you are interested in expanding your OOP skills, you’ll need to practice, practice, practice. Also look at how existing classes are defined, in particular looking at some of the PEAR stuff. Keep reading, keep experimenting, but start slow and really think things through! If you get stuck or confused, feel free to make use of my supporting forum  www.DMCInsights.com.com phorum  .        s d o h t e M d n a s e s s a l C t c a r t s b A     308   8  Real-World OOP  The preceding two chapters each discuss object-oriented programming, as it pertains specifically to version 5 of PHP  which has a drastically new object model and syntax . The majority of the examples in those chapters tend to be more demonstrative than practical  the Rectangle, Square, Shape, and Triangle classes are useful, though, but only if you’re doing geometric work . Philosophical examples are best for teaching OOP, I believe, but real-world object-oriented programming hammers the points home.  In this chapter I focus on two popular uses of OOP: exception handling and a shop- ping cart. The first subject is new to PHP 5 and worth knowing, even if you don’t reg- ularly do object-based programming. The shopping cart example will be an alternative to the procedural method implemented in Chapter 5, “E-Commerce Techniques.” My hope is that by having both the procedural and objective implementations of this example, you’ll be best able to grasp the OOP concepts.  R e a l - W o r l d O O P     309   Chapter 8  Catching Exceptions One of the OOP additions in PHP 5 is the ability to handle errors using try and catch statements. The premise is that you try to do certain things in your PHP code, specifi- cally the kinds of things that might fail  like connecting to a database or including a file . If an error occurs, you then throw an excep- tion. Your code will then catch the exception and respond accordingly. Simply put, an exception is when something other than what you expected happens.  The basic syntax is try {     Do something.    Throw an exception on error.  } catch  exception  {    Do whatever now.  }  This is a more sophisticated version of if   * Do something. *   { } else {   * Do whatever because a problem  ➝ occurred. *  }  The benefit that the exception handling has over the conditional is that it further sepa- rates the functionality and logic from the error handling. Furthermore, multiple errors can be handled without having to use lots of nested conditionals.  There are two ways exceptions might be thrown. The first is to forcibly throw an exception, using the syntax throw new Exception ‘error message’ ;  s n o i t p e c x E g n i h c t a C     310  Exceptions vs. Error Handling  Catching exceptions, like all object- oriented programming, shouldn’t be  used just because you can or know how. Exceptions can be overused, cluttering up code with unnecessary try…catch blocks. Exception handling also intro- duces a new potential problem: any exception that’s not caught results in a fatal error. A third concern is that every time you create an object, including an Exception object, quite a bit of server overhead is required.  You’ll see in this book that I tend to  use exception handling most frequently when using secondary libraries. For example, in later chapters, try…catch blocks will be used when working with COM  Chapter 10, “PHP and the Server”  and the PDFlib  download the free bonus chapter, “Creating PDFs,” from www.peachpit.com title 0321376013. .   Real-World OOP  This code throws an object of type Exception, a class defined in PHP. To catch this excep- tion, you would have: catch  Exception $e   where $e is an object of the Exception type.  The Exception class contains the methods  functions  indicated in Table 8.1, which you can use to access information about the error. A try…catch example might therefore look like: try {     Do something.  } catch  Exception $e  {  echo $e->getMessage  ;  }  You should note that any code after an exe- cuted throw will never run. Conversely, if no exception ever occurs, the code in the catch block will never be executed.  The second way an exception might be thrown is if the try block is executing  code that throws exceptions itself. You’ll  see this later in the chapter. For this first example, some sample data will be written to a text file.     C a t c h i n g E x c e p t i o n s  311  Table 8.1 These methods are all part of the Exception class and will be necessary to properly handle exceptions that occur.

Chapter 8  and the data to be written. $file = ‘data.txt’; $data = “This is a line of data.\n”; The $file variable should store the full path  relative or absolute  to the text file. This code is outside of a try…catch struc- ture and will therefore always be execut- ed, like any other PHP code.  3. Begin a try block.  try { The bulk of the functionality of the script will go within this block. 4. Attempt to open the file.  if  !$fp = @fopen $file, ‘w’   {  throw new Exception ‘could not  ➝ open the file.’ ; } Opening a file for writing is a common cause of problems, most likely because the file doesn’t exist, the file’s name and path are incorrect, or the file does not have the proper permissions. If the file could not be opened in writing mode, an exception is thrown with the message could not open the file. Any errors generated by the function calls will be suppressed by @  the error suppression operator .  if  !@fwrite $fp, $data   {  throw new Exception ‘could not  ➝ write to the file.’ ; } This piece of code will only be executed if no exception was thrown by the code in Step 4. Logically, if the file could be opened for writing, the script should be able to use fwrite   here. But, just as an example, if you accidentally coded !fwrite $file, $data  here, that mistake would be caught, too.  6. Attempt to close the file.  if  !@fclose $fp   {  throw new Exception ‘could not  ➝ close the file.’ ; } Each exception thrown within the try block is of the Exception type, but each has a unique message.  7.

Within this block, the received message is printed  by call- ing the getMessage   method  within context.  9.

For example, changing the fopen   mode to r will create the result in Figure 8.3. Changing !fclose $fp  to !fclose $Fp  will create the result in Figure 8.4.    Failure to catch a thrown exception results in a fatal error  Figure 8.5 .    Every try statement requires at least one catch. You can have multiple catch state- ments, each catching a different excep- tion type. You’ll see this in the next example.    The Exception class’s constructor can take anywhere from zero to two argu- ments. The first argument is an error message, and the second is an error code.    A catch block can also throw an excep- tion to be caught by a later catch block. The object thrown can be new or the current exception object: try {     Code.  } catch  Exception $e  {     Do whatever. throw $e;  } catch  Exception $e  {     Now do this.  }  s n o i t p e c x E g n i h c t a C     316  Figure 8.3 If the script could not write to the data file, an exception with a different message is thrown  compare with Figures 8.1 and 8.4 .  Figure 8.4 An inability to close the opened file generates this result.  Figure 8.5 When using try, you must ensure that all exceptions are caught, lest you’re left with ugly fatal errors like this one.   Real-World OOP  Extending the  Exception Class The preceding example demonstrates basic usage of a try…catch block, using the built- in Exception class. This class is very basic, designed to be extended so that you can add, or change, functionality as needed. Script 8.2 shows the basic outline of this class.  Extending the Exception class is accom- plished just like extending any class  see Chapter 7, “Advanced OOP” : class MyException extends Exception {…  continues on next page  Script 8.2 This code, which comes from the PHP manual, shows the basic definition of the Exception class.  <?php  {  class Exception  protected $code = 0;  protected $file;  protected $line;  protected $message = 'Unknown exception';     exception message     user defined exception code     source filename of exception     source line of exception  function __construct $message = null, $code = 0 ;  final function getMessage  ;     message of exception   final function getCode  ;  final function getFile  ;  final function getLine  ;  final function getTrace  ;     code of exception     source filename     source line     an array of the backtrace    final function getTraceAsString  ;     formatted string of trace        E x t e n d i n g t h e E x c e p t i o n C l a s s      * Overrideable *   function __toString  ;  }  ?>     formatted string for display  317  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21   Chapter 8  Note that only the Exception constructor and __toString   methods can be overrid- den, because the others are all defined as final.  To use your extended class, you would change the try…catch block to: try {     Some code. throw new MyException ‘error  ➝ message’ ; } catch  MyException $e  { }  Thanks to object type hinting  see the side- bar , you can catch different kinds of excep- tions from the same try block: try {     Some code. throw new MyException1 ‘error  ➝ message’ ;     Some more code. throw new MyException2 ‘error  ➝ message’ ; } catch  MyException1 $e  { } catch  MyException2 $e  { }  In the preceding section of the chapter I mention the two ways exceptions are nor- mally thrown: forcibly in the try code or by using code that throws exceptions itself. I’ll demonstrate this other method in the next example. This script will do the same thing as the preceding example—write data to a file—but will use an object to do so. This object will throw exceptions of a specific class. To save time and book space, both new classes and the code that uses them  will be put into this one file. In a real appli- cation, you’d likely want to separate the  code into three distinct files.  318     s s a l C n o i t p e c x E e h t g n i d n e t x E         Real-World OOP  Object Type Hinting  Not discussed in Chapter 7 but more of an advanced topic is object type hinting. This is accomplished by preceding a variable with a class name, as in a catch block: catch  ClassName $e   You’ll also come across type hinting in functions or methods that must take a specific type  of object as an argument: function my_func  ClassName $e  {…  The intent of type hinting is to only accept a value if it’s of the proper type  or class, when it comes to objects . PHP’s loosely typed nature is fine for numbers and strings, as you can treat variables of these types just the same without complaint. But thinking you have an object of a certain class when you don’t will be a real problem when you go to invoke the object’s class- specific methods. Object type hinting prevents this from being an issue.  The last thing to know about type hinting is that it matches a class or any derived  class. The code catch  Exception $e   will catch exceptions thrown of type MyException or Exception  given that MyException is derived from Exception . If your code might catch both kinds of exceptions, you would want to catch the derived types first: try {     Code  } catch  MyException $me  { } catch  Exception $e  { }  In that code, any exception of type MyException will be caught by the first catch.

Begin defining an extension to the  Exception class. class FileException extends  ➝ Exception { This class, called FileException, will specifically handle file opening, writing, and closing errors. It will add one method to the inherited Exception methods.  3. Begin defining the get_details    method. function get_details   {  switch  $this->code  {  case 0:  ➝ filename was provided’;  return ‘No  break;  Any time an exception occurs, up to  two arguments can be passed to the Exception class: the message and the error code. The WriteToFile class, to be written shortly, will generate its own error codes. This class, FileException, will associate those error codes with more specific error messages. This get_details   method returns the  message that goes with each code,  using a switch.  4. Complete the switch.  case 1:  ➝ not exist.’;  break;  case 2:  ➝ a file.’;  break;  case 3:  324     s s a l C n o i t p e c x E e h t g n i d n e t x E        return ‘The file is not  return ‘An invalid mode  return ‘The data could  return ‘The file could  ➝ writable.’;  break;  case 4:  ➝ was provided.’;  break;  case 5:  ➝ not be written.’; break;  case 6:  ➝ not be closed.’; break;  default:  return ‘No further  ➝ information is available.’;  break; }    End of SWITCH. Each of these messages will mean more once you see the WriteToFile class.  5. Complete the get_details   method and  the FileException class.  }    End of get_details    ➝ function. }    End of FileException class.  6. Begin defining the WriteToFile class.  private $fp = null; private $message = ‘’;  This class is going to wrap up under one umbrella all the validation and code required for writing to a file. It has two attributes, the first of which will be the file pointer. The second attribute will be assigned an error message. Both attrib- utes are private, as they should not be accessible outside of this class.  return ‘The file does  class WriteToFile {  return ‘The file is not   7. Begin defining the constructor.  function __construct $file = null, ➝ $mode = ‘w’  {  $this->message = “File: $file  ➝ Mode: $mode”; The constructor is called when a new WriteToFile object is created. It takes two arguments: the file and the mode, whose default value is w. The purpose of the constructor is to confirm that the file exists and is writable, and then to open that file for writing. The constructor also helps build the error message, which, for debugging purposes, will contain the file- name and the mode.  8. Make sure that a filename was provided.  if  empty $file   {  throw new FileException  ➝  $this->message, 0 ; } The first validation routine checks that some filename was passed to the class. If not, an exception of type FileException is thrown, using the default message and an error code of 0. This error code matches the more specific message in the FileException get_details   method.  9. Make sure that the file exists and that it  is a file. if  !file_exists $file   {  throw new FileException   ➝  $this->message, 1 ; } if  !is_file $file   {  throw new FileException   ➝  $this->message, 2 ; } The file_exists   function will return TRUE even if provided with a directory name, so the second check is also neces- sary. If either check fails, an exception is thrown, providing different error codes accordingly.  Real-World OOP  10. Confirm that the file is writable.  if  !is_writable $file    {  throw new FileException   ➝  $this->message, 3 ; }  11. Confirm that a valid mode was used.  if  !in_array $mode, array ‘a’, ➝ ‘a+’, ‘w’, ‘w+’    {  throw new FileException  ➝  $this->message, 4 ; } As I don’t want to try to open the file in an invalid mode, this check is necessary. I’ve omitted some valid modes  like ab  and all reading modes  because I’m cre- ating a write-specific class  to keep it simple.  12. Open the file and complete the   constructor.  $this->fp = fopen $file,   ➝ $mode ; }    End of constructor. If all of the validation tests were passed, the file is opened in the given mode, assigning the result to the $fp attribute. 13. Create the method for writing data to  the file. function write $data = null  {  if  !fwrite $this->fp, $data    throw new  ➝ FileException $this->message . “ ➝ Data: $data”, 5 ;  {  }  }    End of write   method. This method has its own validation test and throws an exception with its own error code.  continues on next page  325        E x t e n d i n g t h e E x c e p t i o n C l a s s      14. Create the method for closing the file.  18. Catch the exceptions.  Chapter 8  function close   {  if  !fclose $this->fp   {  throw new  ➝ FileException $this->message, 6 ;  } $this->fp = null;  }    End of close   method.  15. Complete the WriteToFile class. }    End of WriteToFile class.  16. Identify the file to use and the data   to write. $file = ‘data.txt’; $data = “This is a line of data.\n”;  17. Create a try block that uses the  WriteToFile class. try {  $fp = new WriteToFile $file ; $fp->write $data ; $fp->close  ; echo ‘ The data has been  ➝ written. ’; Because all of the validation resides in the WriteToFile class, using this class  is remarkably simple. Compare this  code with that in write_to_file.php  Script 8.1 .     s s a l C n o i t p e c x E e h t g n i d n e t x E        326  } catch  FileException $fe  {  echo ‘ The process could not  ➝ be completed. Debugging  ➝ information: ’ .  ➝ $fe->getMessage   . ‘ ’ .  ➝ $fe->get_details   . ‘ ’; } This catch expects exceptions of type FileException, which will be thrown by the WriteToFile object. Within the catch, debugging information is printed using both the Exception getMessage   method  which should print the file, mode, and possibly data  and the FileException get_details   method.  Analyzing the WriteToFile Class  The focus in this section of the chapter is on extending the Exception class, but I do want to take a minute to analyze the WriteToFile class, as part of my ongoing attempt to convey good OOP theory.  The class is good in that it puts every- thing involved with writing to a file in one place. It also has a ton of validation built in, which makes using the class real- ly easy  see Script 8.3 . Tying the class to an extended Exception class also works nicely.   The class is a bit too specific, though. In reality, you’d probably want to create a FileIO class, that handles both writing and reading. I would probably, in hind- sight, place the code that closes the file  in the destructor instead of a separate close   method.    Figure 8.6 The result if the file exists but is not writable. The first line of debugging information comes from the Exception getMessage   class. The rest comes from FileException get_details  .  Figure 8.7 If the data cannot be written to the file, the debugging information also shows what data was received  here, nothing .  Figure 8.8 Attempting to open the file in reading mode will also fail.  Real-World OOP  19. Complete the page.  ?>      20. Save the file as write_to_file2.php, place it in your Web directory, and  test in your Web browser  Figures 8.6, 8.7, and 8.8 . This example really emphasizes two things. First, it shows how you can extend the Exception class to make your error handling as detailed as possible  the default errors you might encounter when opening, writing to, and closing files are generally not very informative . Second, it shows how much of an appli- cation’s functionality can be stored in a class, making the rest of the code quite simple. This is just one of the benefits of object-oriented programming.  ✔ Tips    Because PHP generates an ugly error should an uncaught exception occur, you can create your own exception  handler to handle this situation more gracefully: function my_exception_handler  Exception $e  {     Do whatever.  } set_exception_handler ‘my_exception_ ➝ handler’ ;    If your extended class has its   own constructor, it should also  call the Exception constructor using parent::__construct  .        E x t e n d i n g t h e E x c e p t i o n C l a s s     327   Chapter 8  Creating a Shopping  Cart Class For the second “real-world” use of object- oriented programming, I want to implement as a class the shopping cart system created in Chapter 5, “E-Commerce Techniques.” If you look back at cart.php  Script 5.7 , you’ll see that the one page does several things:  ◆ Adds items to the cart  ◆ Updates the quantities in the cart  ◆ Removes items from the cart  when the  user enters a quantity of 0   ◆ Displays the shopping cart in an   HTML form  In an object-oriented structure, this  can be implemented in many ways. You could start with an abstract ShoppingCart class that is then extended by a more  specific WidgetShoppingCart class. I’m  going to keep this simple and just go with the WidgetShoppingCart, but check out the Shape and Triangle classes in Chapter 7 for how an inherited abstract class would work.  For this class, each of the preceding fea- tures can be turned into a method. Only  one attribute, which will store an array of items in the cart, will be required. Unlike  the session variable in Chapter 5, which only stored the product IDs and their respective quantities, this cart will store everything about each product: ID, name, color, size, quantity, and price.        s s a l C t r a C g n i p p o h S a g n i t a e r C        328   Real-World OOP  To create a shopping cart class: 1.

It’ll be used by scripts to know whether or not the cart should be  displayed.  Real-World OOP  4. Begin defining the add_item   method.  public function add_item $id,  ➝ $info  {  if  isset $this->items[$id]   { $this->update_item $id,  ➝ $this->items[$id][‘qty’] + 1 ; This method receives two arguments: the item ID and an array of information. The ID will be the index in the $items array. The array of information will contain the product’s name, color, size, and price, to which will be added the quantity. The method starts by checking if  the item is already in the cart. If so, the update_item   method is called, sending it the item ID and the new quantity  which is the current quantity plus 1 . Although the item’s quantity could be updated within this method, since the other method with the appropriate func- tionality already exists, it’s best not to replicate that functionality here  creating redundancies .  continues on next page        C r e a t i n g a S h o p p i n g C a r t C l a s s        333   $this->items[$id][‘qty’]  Figure 8.9 The message generated when a new item is added to the shopping cart.  5. Complete the add_item   method.  } else {  $this->items[$id] =  Chapter 8  ➝ $info;  ➝ = 1;  echo “ The widget  ➝ ‘{$info[‘name’]}’ in color ➝ {$info[‘color’]}, size ➝ {$info[‘size’]} has been added to ➝ your shopping cart. \n”;  }  }    End of add_item   method. The else clause applies if the item is  not already in the cart. In that case, the item is put into the virtual cart by adding a new element to the $items array. The $info variable will be sent to this method as an array, defined like so: $info = array   ‘name’ => $name, ‘color’ => $color, ‘size’ => $size, ‘price’ => $price ; To this array, a fifth element is added: a quantity of 1, indexed at qty. Finally, this method prints a message indicating what just happened   Figure 8.9 .        s s a l C t r a C g n i p p o h S a g n i t a e r C        334   Figure 8.10 When the quantity of an item in the cart is updated, a message like this is printed.  Real-World OOP  6. Create a method for updating an item.  public function update_item $id, $qty  {  if  $qty == 0  {  $this->delete_item $id ;  } elseif    $qty > 0  &&  $qty  ➝ != $this->items[$id][‘qty’]   {  $this->items[$id][‘qty’]  ➝ = $qty;  echo “ You now have  ➝ $qty copy ies  of the widget ➝ ‘{$this->items[$id][‘name’]}’ in ➝ color {$this->items[$id][‘color’]}, ➝ size {$this->items[$id][‘size’]} in ➝ your shopping cart. \n”;  }  }    End of update_item   method. The first check sees if the new quantity  is 0, in which case the item should be deleted. To do so, the delete_item   method is called, which contains that functionality. Otherwise, as long as the quantity is positive and it’s not the same as the current quantity  because that wouldn’t be an update, would it? , the quantity in the cart will be updated. Again, a message reports on what just happened  Figure 8.10 .  continues on next page        C r e a t i n g a S h o p p i n g C a r t C l a s s        335   Figure 8.11 Unlike the cart in Chapter 5, this version now indicates what item s  are removed when the user sets a quantity to zero.  Chapter 8  7. Create a method for deleting an item. public function delete_item $id  {  if  isset $this->items[$id]   {  echo “ The widget  ➝ ‘{$this->items[$id][‘name’]}’ in ➝ color {$this->items[$id][‘color’]}, ➝ size {$this->items[$id][‘size’]} ➝ has been removed from your shopping ➝ cart. \n”;  unset $this->items  ➝ [$id] ;  }  }    End of delete_item   method. The only thing this method should do  is confirm that the item is in the cart prior to unsetting it. A message indicat- ing what just happened is also printed  Figure 8.11 . Note that you have to print the message before unsetting the item or else you won’t be able to refer to $this->items[$id][‘name’], etc.        s s a l C t r a C g n i p p o h S a g n i t a e r C        336   Figure 8.12 The cart viewed as an HTML form so that the user can update the quantities.  Figure 8.13 The cart viewed without the HTML form, so it is uneditable. This feature might be used on the final checkout page.  Real-World OOP  8. Begin the method for displaying the  cart’s contents. public function display_cart $action ➝ = false  {  echo ‘<table border=”0”  ➝ width=”90%” cellspacing=”2” ➝ cellpadding=”2” align=”center”>     <td align=”left”  ➝ width=”20%”> Widget    <td align=”left”  ➝ width=”15%”> Size    <td align=”left”  ➝ width=”15%”> Color    <td align=”right”  ➝ width=”15%”> Price   <td align=”center”  ➝ width=”10%”> Qty   <td align=”right”  ➝ width=”15%”> Total Price       ‘;  if  $action  {  echo ‘<form action=”’ .  ➝ $action . ‘“ method=”post”>  <input type=”hidden” name=”do”  ➝ value=”update”  >  ‘; }  I want this method to display the  cart either as part of an HTML form  Figure 8.12  or not  Figure 8.13 . To distinguish between these two modes, the method takes an optional $action argument. If provided, this should be  the name of the file to which the form should be submitted. The method begins by printing a table and its header. If an action was received, the initial form tags are generated.  continues on next page  337        C r e a t i n g a S h o p p i n g C a r t C l a s s         Figure 8.14 The HTML source code of the form shows how each item’s quantity is a text input.  Chapter 8  9.  Initialize a total variable and begin loop- ing through each item in the cart. $total = 0; foreach  $this->items as $id => ➝ $info  {  $subtotal = $info[‘qty’] *  ➝ $info[‘price’];  $total += $subtotal; $subtotal =  ➝ number_format $subtotal, 2 ; The first thing that happens within the loop is the calculation of the subtotals and total. This code is similar to that in the original script.  10. Determine how the item’s quantity  should be displayed. $qty =  $action  ? “<input ➝ type=\”text\” size=\”3\” ➝ name=\”qty[$id]\” ➝ value=\”{$info[‘qty’]}\”  >” : ➝ $info[‘qty’]; If the cart is being displayed as a form, then the quantities should be shown  as an input box with a preset value  Figure 8.14 . Otherwise, the quantity should just be the quantity. The ternary operator helps makes this decision,  using the $action variable. This is the equivalent of writing: if  $action  {  $qty = “<input type=\”text\”  ➝ size=\”3\” name=\”qty[$id]\” ➝ value=\”{$info[‘qty’]}\”  >”; } else {  $qty = $info[‘qty’];        s s a l C t r a C g n i p p o h S a g n i t a e r C        }  338   11. Print the item and complete the   13.

Because this code involves both variables and HTML, I use the heredoc syntax, as described in Chapter 1, “Advanced PHP Techniques.”  12. Print the order total.  echo ‘     <td colspan=”5”  ➝ align=”right”> Total:     $’ .  ➝ number_format  $total, 2  . ‘   ’;  Real-World OOP  if  $action  { echo ‘  <td colspan=”6”  ➝ align=”center”>Set an item\’s ➝ quantity to 0 to remove it from ➝ your cart.       <td colspan=”6”  ➝ align=”center”><button ➝ type=”submit” name=”submit” ➝ value=”update”>Update ➝ Cart      ’; } If this cart is being displayed as part of a form, it must also inform the user how to delete an item, and create a submit button.  14.

C r e a t i n g a S h o p p i n g C a r t C l a s s        339   Chapter 8  Using the Cart Class Having created the WidgetShoppingCart class, a script now has to be made that uses an object of that type. This next script will replace cart.php  Script 5.7 , doing every- thing the original file did, but using OOP for the cart management. However, the page must still uses sessions, because any created object will still only exist for the life of the page. Therefore, this script will now store the object in the session at the end of the script and refer to that session-stored object at the beginning of the script, if it exists. Other than that, much of the basic functionality of this page will mimic that in the original file.  To use the WidgetShoppingCart class: 1. Create a new PHP document in your text  editor or IDE  Script 8.5 . <?php  Script 8.5 - cart.php require_once  ‘. includes  ➝ config.inc.php’ ; $page_title = ‘Shopping Cart’; include_once  ‘. includes  ➝ header.html’ ; echo ‘ View Your Shopping ➝ Cart ’;  continues on page 343  Script 8.5 The cart.php page handles all cart management through an object of type WidgetShoppingCart. The object must be serialized and stored in the session in order to be available over multiple page views.  <?php  Script 8.5 - cart.php   *  * * * * * * * *   This is the shopping cart page. This page has two modes: - add a product to the cart - update the cart The page shows the cart as a form for updating quantities. The cart is an object of WidgetShoppingCart type, which is stored in a session.     Require the configuration file before any PHP code: require_once  '. includes config.inc.php' ;     Include the header file: $page_title = 'Shopping Cart'; include_once  '. includes header.html' ;  echo ' View Your Shopping Cart ';     Create the shopping cart: require_once 'WidgetShoppingCart.php' ; if  isset $_SESSION['cart']   {  $cart = unserialize $_SESSION['cart'] ;     s s a l C t r a C e h t g n i s U        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  340   script continues on next page    26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44  45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56  57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70  Real-World OOP  Script 8.5 continued  } else {  }  $cart = new WidgetShoppingCart  ;     This page will either add to or update the     shopping cart, based upon the value of $_REQUEST['do']; if  isset $_REQUEST['do']  &&  $_REQUEST['do'] == 'add'    {    Add new item.  if  isset $_GET['sw_id']   {    Check for a product ID.

Next, the script checks to see if the cart object exists in the session  which is to say  that the user has accessed this page before . If so, the $cart variable will be assigned the unserialized version of $_SESSION[‘cart’]. You have to use  the unserialize   function to access  it, as the cart object will be serialized prior to storing it in the session. If $_SESSION[‘cart’] does not exist, a new object of type WidgetShoppingCart   will be created.  3. Check for a $_REQUEST[‘do’] variable.  if  isset $_REQUEST[‘do’]  && ➝  $_REQUEST[‘do’] == ‘add’    { When an item is added to the cart by clicking the link on the products page, $_GET[‘do’] will have a value of add.  4. Validate the specific widget ID. if  isset $_GET[‘sw_id’]   {  $sw_id =  int  $_GET[‘sw_id’]; if  $sw_id > 0  {  Just to be safe, you should make sure that the specific widget ID is a positive integer.  continues on next page  343        U s i n g t h e C a r t C l a s s      Figure 8.15 The query retrieves all the required information for an individual product.

Retrieve the product information from  the database. $q = “SELECT name, color, size, ➝ default_price, price FROM ➝ general_widgets LEFT JOIN ➝ specific_widgets USING  gw_id  LEFT ➝ JOIN colors USING  color_id  LEFT ➝ JOIN sizes USING  size_id  WHERE ➝ sw_id=$sw_id”; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  { In order both to confirm that a valid product ID was received and to be able to add it to the shopping cart, this query is necessary. It performs a join across four tables in order to get the general widget name as well as the specific wid- get’s color and size  Figure 8.15 . Because a widget could have a default price or a specific price  which overrides the default , both prices are selected. Code in Step 6 will determine which price to use.  $row = mysqli_fetch_array $r, ➝ MYSQLI_ASSOC ; $price =  empty $row[‘price’]   ? ➝ $row[‘default_price’] : ➝ $row[‘price’]; $cart->add_item $sw_id, array ‘name’ ➝ => $row[‘name’], ‘color’ => ➝ $row[‘color’], ‘size’ => ➝ $row[‘size’], ‘price’ => $price  ; First, the record is retrieved from the data- base. Second, the correct price is deter- mined by checking if $row[‘price’] has a value. If so, this new price should be used; otherwise, the default price is correct. Then, the item is added to the cart using the add_item   method. The first argu- ment should be the item ID, which is $sw_id. The second argument is an array of information.  6. Update the cart.  344     s s a l C t r a C e h t g n i s U         Real-World OOP  7. Complete the conditionals started in Steps 5 and 4, and then check to see if $_REQUEST[‘do’] equals update.  ➝ mysqli_num_rows   IF.  }    End of  }    End of  $sw_id > 0   ➝ IF.  }    End of  ➝ isset $_GET[‘sw_id’]  IF. } elseif  isset $_REQUEST[‘do’]  && ➝  $_REQUEST[‘do’] == ‘update’   { $_REQUEST[‘do’] will have a value of update when the user updates their cart by submitting the form. At this point the shopping cart should attempt to update every quantity.  8. Update the cart quantities.  foreach  $_POST[‘qty’] as $k => $v  {  $pid =  int  $k; $qty =  int  $v; $cart->update_item $pid, $qty ;  } This is pretty simple. Both the key, which is the product ID, and the value, which is the quantity, are first typecast to inte- gers. Then the update_item   method is called. That method will only update the quantity if it has a positive value differ- ent from the current quantity  see WidgetShoppingCart.php, Script 8.4 . The method also removes any items whose quantity is set to 0.  9. Print a message and complete the  $_REQUEST if-else.  echo ‘ Your shopping cart has  ➝ been updated. ’; }    End of $_REQUEST IF-ELSE.  continues on next page  345        U s i n g t h e C a r t C l a s s     The Standard PHP Library  More “real-world” object-oriented pro- gramming can be found in PEAR  see Chapter 12, “Using PEAR”  or in the Standard PHP Library  SPL .

Show the cart contents, if it’s not empty.  if  !$cart->is_empty    {  $cart->display_cart  ➝  ‘cart.php’ ; } else {  echo ‘ Your cart is currently  ➝ empty. ’; } Invoking the display_cart   method is all that’s required to show the cart. By passing this method one argument  with a value of cart.php, the method will create a form that is submitted  back to this page.  11. Store the cart object in a session.  $_SESSION[‘cart’] = ➝ serialize $cart ; The cart must be stored in the session, or else the cart will be empty each time the user comes to the page.  12.

This is true for all objects, as PHP would otherwise have no way of accessing a class’s methods.     s s a l C t r a C e h t g n i s U        Figure 8.16 These values will update the cart’s contents  Figure 8.17  upon submitting the form.  Figure 8.17 Specific messages show what changes were made to the cart’s contents.  346  Figure 8.18 If the WidgetShoppingCart is_empty   function returns a value of true, the cart will not be displayed.   9  Networking with PHP  The vast bulk of what PHP is used to do is based upon taking information from the server  like a database or a text file  and sending it to the client  the end user’s Web browser  or vice versa. But PHP also supports a slew of features for the purpose of interacting with other Web sites, communicating with other servers, and even FTP’ing files. In this chapter, I’ll discuss and demonstrate a couple of network-related PHP functions and capabilities.  In the first example, you’ll see how to read data from another Web site as if it were any old text file. In the second, a URL validator will be created  a tool for checking if a link is still good . In the third section of the chapter, you’ll learn how to identify from what country a user is connecting to your server. And finally, you’ll get a quick introduction to cURL, a powerful networking utility.  N e t w o r k i n g w i t h P H P        347   Chapter 9  Accessing Other  Web Sites Even though PHP itself is normally used to create Web sites, it can also access and inter- act with Web pages on its own. This can be useful for retrieving information, writing spiders  applications that scour the Internet for particular data , and more. Surprisingly, you can access other Web sites in much the same way you would access a text file on your hard drive: by using fopen  . fopen  ‘http:  www.example.com ’, ‘r’ ;  The fopen   function used for opening files can also open Web pages because they are, after all, just files on a server. The parame- ters for using fopen   are the same  r, w, and a , although you will be limited to open- ing a file only for reading unless the file’s permissions are open  which hopefully they are not .  One caveat, though, is that you must use  a trailing slash after a directory because fopen   will not support redirects. The pre- ceding example and this one are fine: fopen  ‘http:  www.example.com  ➝ index.php’, ‘r’ ;  But this will fail: fopen  ‘http:  www.example.com  ➝ dir’, ‘r’ ;   Many people are unaware that the URL www.example.com dir is redirected to www.example.com dir .   Once you have opened a file, you can treat  it as you otherwise would, using file  , fgets  , etc., to retrieve  or place  the data.  I’ll demonstrate this concept by making use of Yahoo!’s financial pages to return New York Stock Exchange quotes for different stocks.  348        s e t i S b e W r e h t O g n i s s e c c A     Before proceeding, I should state that the legality of retrieving information from another Web site is an issue you would want to investigate before permanently imple- menting something like this. Most sites con- tain copyrighted information, and using it without permission would be a violation. This demonstration with Yahoo! is just a demonstration, not a suggestion that you make a habit of this! To read a Web site with PHP: 1. Create a new PHP document in your text editor or IDE, beginning with the HTML  Script 9.1 : <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset= ➝ iso-8859-1”  >   Get Stock Quotes  <style type=”text css”  ➝ title=”text css” media=”all”> .error {  color: F30;  } .quote {  font-weight : bold;  }       <?php  Script 9.1 - get_quote.php  continues on page 351   Script 9.1 The code in this example will retrieve stock quotes by opening up Yahoo!’s quote page and parsing the data therein.

The form itself takes just one input: the symbol for a stock. As the form uses the GET method, the handling PHP code checks for the presence of a $_GET[‘symbol’].  3. Define the URL to be opened.  $url = sprintf ‘http:   ➝ quote.yahoo.com d quotes.csv?s= ➝ %s&f=nl1’, $_GET[‘symbol’] ; The most important consideration when accessing and reading other Web pages is to know exactly what data will be there and in what form. In other words, unless you are merely copying the entire contents of a file, you’ll need to develop some system for gleaning the parts of the page you want according to how the data is structured. In this example, a URL such as http:   quote.yahoo.com d quotes.csv takes two arguments: the stock  or stocks  to check and the formatting parameters. It will then return a CSV  comma-separated value  file. For this example, I want to know the stock’s name and the latest price, so  the formatting would be nl1  see www. gummy-stuff.org Yahoo-data.htm for the options and what they mean . Throw in the ticker symbol and the result will be in the format  where XX.XX is the price : “STOCK NAME”,XX.XX  continues on next page  351     A c c e s s i n g O t h e r W e b S i t e s         Figure 9.1 The result if the URL could not be opened.  Chapter 9  Once I know that this is a comma- delineated list of the stock’s name and  its latest price, I can then parse exactly what I am looking for. More complex Web pages might require use of regular expressions to retrieve the particular pieces you want.  4. Open the Web page and read in the data.  $fp = @fopen  $url, ‘r’  or die ➝  ‘<div align=”center” ➝ class=”error”>Cannot access ➝ Yahoo!   ’ ; $read = fgetcsv  $fp ; fclose  $fp ; Now that the URL is defined, I can open the “file” for reading. Since I know that the returned data is in CSV form, I can use fgetcsv   to read it. This function will automatically turn the line it reads into an array, using commas as the delimiter. Then I close the file pointer. Note that if the URL were a proper HTML document  this one is not , the first line read would be something like <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C . If the URL could not be opened, an error message is printed and the script termi- nated  Figure 9.1 .  5. Validate that a legitimate stock symbol  was used. if  strcasecmp $read[0], ➝ $_GET[‘symbol’]  != 0  { If an invalid stock symbol is used, then the Yahoo! page will return that symbol as the stock name and $0.00 as the price. To weed these instances out, check if the returned name is the same as the sym- bol. I use the strcasecmp   function to perform a case-insensitive equality check between them. If they are the same, the function will return 0. If they are not the same, a nonzero value is returned, mean- ing it’s safe to print the result.  352        s e t i S b e W r e h t O g n i s s e c c A      Figure 9.2 The resulting HTML, including the CSS references.

Print the stock’s value.  echo ‘ The latest ➝ value for  ’ . ➝ $read[0] . ‘   <span ➝ class=”quote”>’ . $_GET[‘symbol’] . ➝ ‘   is $  ➝ ’. $read[1] . ‘ .  ➝  ’; The code in Step 4 takes the information retrieved  e.g., “STOCK NAME”,24.34  and turns it into an array. The first ele- ment in the array is the stock’s name, and the second is the current stock value. Both are printed, along with the stock’s symbol, within some CSS format- ting  Figure 9.2 . Note that the fgetcsv   function will strip the quotes from around the stock’s name.  7. Complete the strcasecmp   conditional.  } else {  echo ‘<div align=  ➝ ”center” class=”error”>Invalid ➝ symbol! ’;  }  }  8. Complete the $_GET[‘symbol’] condi-  tional and the PHP section. } ?>  9.

See Chapter 12, “Using PEAR,” and the Web site http:  pear. php.net for more.    The Zend Framework  http:    framework.zend.com  has some network- related classes as well. At the time of this writing, there are ones specifically for connecting to Amazon, Flickr, and Yahoo!.        s e t i S b e W r e h t O g n i s s e c c A     354  Figure 9.3 The form takes just a stock symbol from the user.

Common Ports  N u m b e r 21 22 23 25 80 81 110 143 389 443  P r i m a r y   P u r p o s e FTP SSH Telnet SMTP Web Web  alternate  POP IMAP LDAP SSL  Networking with PHP  Working with Sockets The fopen   function is one way to access Web pages, but a more sophisticated method would be to use sockets. A socket, in case you are not familiar, is a channel through which two computers can communicate with each other. To open a socket in PHP, use fsockopen  : $fp = fsockopen  $url, $port, $error_ ➝ number, $error_string, $timeout ;  You use fsockopen   to establish a file point- er as you would use fopen  . The parameters the function takes are the URL, the port, an error number variable, an error string vari- able, and the timeout  only the first argu- ment is required .  In layman’s terms, a port is the door through which different protocols  methods of com- munication  go. For Web pages, the port is normally 80  see Table 9.1 . The error num- ber and string variables are interesting in that they are not really sent to the function  as they have no value initially  so much as they are returned by the function should an error occur. Finally, the timeout simply states for how many seconds the function should try to connect.  Once the file has been successfully opened, you can again use fwrite  , fgets  , and so forth to manipulate the data.  Another function I’ll explain before writing the fsockopen   example is parse_url  . This function takes a URL and turns it into an associative array by breaking the struc- ture into its parts: $url_pieces = parse_url  $url ;  continues on next page     W o r k i n g w i t h S o c k e t s  355   Table 9.2 How parse_url   breaks down a sample URL. The fragment value corresponds to anything after a .

For URL validation purposes,  200 is the preferred code to see. Common HTTP Status Codes  C o d e 200 204 400 401 403 404 408 500  M e a n i n g OK No content Bad request Unauthorized Forbidden Not found Timeout Internal server error  Chapter 9  The primary pieces of the URL will be scheme, host, port, path, and query. Table 9.2 shows how the URL http:  www.example.com view.php?week=1  would be broken down by parse_url  .  The parse_url   function can be handy in all sorts of instances. I’ll demonstrate one example in the following script. The code developed there will run through a list of URLs and check each to make sure they are still valid. To do so, a user-defined function will take a provided URL, parse it, and then use fsockopen   to connect to it. The serv- er’s HTTP response code will indicate the validate of that link.  Table 9.3 lists some common HTTP status codes, which you can also find by searching the Web.  To use fsockopen  : 1.

The type  of request being made is HEAD. Such a request is like GET, except that the serv- er will only return a response and not  the entire page  compare Figures 9.7 and 9.8 . The fsockopen   line connects to the server; the HEAD $path line here requests a specific page. This could be just   or  somefolder somepage.php. The \r\n code is required for properly formatting the request.  7. Retrieve the response code. $data = fgets  $fp, 128 ; fclose $fp ; list $response, $code  = explode  ➝  ‘ ‘, $data ; Once the URL has been hit with a header, it will respond with its own HTTP head- ers. The code will read in the first 128 characters of the response and then break this down into an array. The sec- ond element returned will be the HTTP code.

Return the code and a class message.  if  $code == 200  {  return array $code, ‘good’ ;  } else {  return array $code, ‘bad’ ;  } This function should indicate, via its return values, what code was received and whether that code is good or bad  these strings match up to the CSS classes . An HTTP status code of 200 is considered normal  OK, technically ; anything else indicates some sort of problem.  9. Finish the conditional begun in Step 5  and the function.  } else {  ‘bad’ ;  }  return array $errstr,  }    End of check_url   function. If a socket connection was not made, the returned error message will be sent back from the check_urls   function.  10.

You might retrieve your own URLs from a database or file instead.  11. Print a header and adjust the PHP  scripts’ time limit. echo ‘ Validating URLs ’; set_time_limit 0 ; Making these socket connections can take some time, especially if you have a lot of URLs to validate. By calling the set_time_limit   function with a value of 0, the PHP script is given limitless time to do its thing. 12. Validate each URL.  foreach  $urls as $url  {  list $code, $class  = check_url  ➝  $url ;  echo “ <a href=\”$url\”  ➝ target=\”_new\”>$url   <span ➝ class=\”$class\”>$code   ➝  \n”; } The foreach loop goes through each URL in the array. Then the check_url   function is called. It returns two values: the code  or an error message  and the CSS class name to use  either good or bad . Then the URL is printed, as a link, followed by the code or error message  Figure 9.9 .  13. Finish the PHP and the HTML.  14.

This is just one example of using sockets  in PHP. You can create your own socket server using PHP and the socket func- tions. If you don’t already know why  you might want to do this, you’ll likely never need to touch these functions.  But for more information, see www.php.net sockets.   Networking with PHP  Performing IP Geolocation One of the questions that I commonly see in my support forums  www.dmcinsights.com  phorum   or in the PHP newsgroups is how to identify what country a user resides in. Although the server where PHP is located could be anywhere in the world and the user could be located anywhere in the world, it is possible to make a geographic match. The premise is this:  Every computer must have an IP address to have Internet access  or to connect to any network . An Internet service provider  ISP  assigns a computer an IP address from a pool of valid addresses only they have access to. By knowing a computer’s IP address, which PHP puts in $_SERVER[‘REMOTE_ADDR’], one can know the ISP and therefore, the country. Hence, the name IP geolocation. New GeoIP databases can even predict the city and state, although with less accuracy.  The easiest way to implement this is to use the PEAR Net_Geo class. It uses online serv- ices to retrieve the information for a provided IP address. This class has its downsides, which I discuss in the sidebar.  This next example will make use of  another network-related PHP function.  The gethostbyname   function returns  the IP address for a given domain name.  P e r f r o m i n g   I P G e o l o c a t i o n  363  Choosing an IP  Geolocation Option  Unfortunately the online resources used by the Net_Geo PEAR class aren’t that up-to-date, so its accuracy could fade over time. In the interest of most readily demonstrating the IP geolocation con- cept, I think it’s a fine enough option.  A more accurate option is to use the Net_GeoIP PEAR class. Unfortunately,  this is still in beta form at the time of this writing and relies upon a commercial database for best accuracy and informa- tion. In fact, as a rule of thumb, if you’re writing an application that relies upon IP geolocation, you’ll want to pay someone for a commercial database, which is likely to be most accurate.

On the city and state level, that accuracy may dip down to 50–80 per- cent, depending upon the database being used. In my case, it did not accu- rately pick the city but suggested one about 20 miles away  in another state . As I suggest in the sidebar, using a com- mercial database would garner more accurate results.    If you have need to find out the host  name of associated with an IP address, use the corresponding gethostbyaddr   function.    If a URL might be on multiple servers, the gethostbynamel   function returns all the possible IP addresses. You can then check one or every IP.  P e r f r o m i n g   I P G e o l o c a t i o n  367   Chapter 9  Using cURL The last network-related topic to be dis- cussed in this chapter is a technology called cURL. This utility, which stands for client URLs  and is also written as just curl or Curl , is a command-line tool for working with URLs. With cURL you can access Web sites, FTP files, and do much, much more. PHP can use cURL via the shell_exec   and other system functions. But PHP also supports libcurl, a cURL library.  The process starts by using curl_init  , providing this function the name of the URL being accessed: $curl = curl_init ‘www.example.com’ ;  The value returned by the function should be assigned to a variable, which will act as a pointer or a handle to the transaction.  Next, the curl_setopt   function is used  a lot  to set any options. The syntax is: curl_setopt $curl, CONSTANT, value ;  Unfortunately, there are way too many options to even provide a subset here. In the following example I’ll highlight a hand- ful of them. If you take to cURL, check out the PHP manual for the full list of settings.     L R U c g n i s U  368   Networking with PHP  After setting all the options  and note that you can set them in any order , use curl_exec   to execute the transaction: $result = curl_exec $curl ;  You should assign the result of the curl_exec   command to a variable, in case you need to print the result.  Finally, close the connection: curl_close $curl ;  The great thing about cURL is that it could also do everything that the other examples in the chapter accomplish. But for this next example, let’s use it for something that fopen  , fsockopen  , and the rest can’t do: open a Web page and post data to it  as if  it submitted a form . In Chapter 4, “Security Techniques,” the PEAR Auth module is  used to add a database-driven username  password restriction to a Web page. After a user submits a valid username password combination, they can access the page  Figure 9.14 . Otherwise, they’ll get a  message indicating the need to log in  Figure 9.15 .  Figure 9.14 After the user logs in  providing a valid username password combination, of course , they’re rewarded with this impressive result.  Figure 9.15 Until a user successfully logs in, this is what they see.  U s i n g c U R L     369   Chapter 9  To use cURL: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE, beginning with the HTML  Script 9.4 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset= ➝ iso-8859-1”  >   Using cURL       <?php  Script 9.4 - curl.php  2. Begin the cURL transaction.  $url = ‘http:  localhost login.php’; $curl = curl_init $url ; You don’t have to assign the URL to use to a variable prior to the curl_init   line, of course. But do make sure you change this URL to point to the login.php script you made  and put in your Web directory  in Chapter 4. If you haven’t done that yet, get thyself over to Chapter 4 and do so before continuing.  3. Tell cURL to fail if an error occurs.  curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_ ➝ FAILONERROR, 1 ; The first of the options is CURLOPT_ FAILONERROR. By setting this to true  or 1 , you tell cURL to stop the process if an error occurs  rather than continuing on .  4. Tell cURL to allow for redirects. curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_ ➝ FOLLOWLOCATION, 1 ;  370     L R U c g n i s U  This second option sets whether or  not redirections  think of a PHP header  ‘Location: somepage.php’  call  should stop the transaction or if redirec- tions should be followed.  5. Opt to assign the returned data to a   variable. curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_ ➝ RETURNTRANSFER,1 ; If you’ll not use the data that would be returned by a cURL request, then you don’t need to enable this option. In this script, that data will be printed for veri- fication, so this value is set to 1.  6. Set the timeout.  curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_ ➝ TIMEOUT, 5 ; This is the maximum amount of time to attempt the transaction, in seconds. 7. Tell cURL to use the POST method.  curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_POST, 1 ; In this example, data will be posted to the page  http:  localhost login.php  as if a form were submitted.  8. Set the POST data.  curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_ ➝ POSTFIELDS, ‘username=me&password= ➝ mypass’ ; The CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option is where you set the POST data. The syntax is a series of name=value pairs, separated by ampersands. The values you use here should match those registered in the database back in Chapter 4.  9. Execute the transaction. $r = curl_exec $curl ;  10. Close the connection. curl_close $curl ;  continues on page 372   Networking with PHP  Script 9.4 The cURL library is used by PHP to post data to a page that requires logging in for access.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd”>          Using cURL   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50      <?php  Script 9.4 - curl.php  This page uses cURL to post a usernamme password combination to a password-protected Web page.   * * *      Identify the URL: $url = ‘http:  localhost login.php’;     Start the process: $curl = curl_init $url ;        Tell cURL to fail if an error occurs: curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, 1 ;      Allow for redirects: curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1 ;     Assign the returned data to a variable: curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,1 ;     Set the timeout: curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 5 ;     Use POST: curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_POST, 1 ;     Set the POST data: curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, ‘username=me&password=mypass’ ;     Execute the transaction: $r = curl_exec $curl ;     Close the connection: curl_close $curl ;  ?>         Print the results: echo ‘ cURL Results:  ’ . htmlentities $r  . ‘ ’;  U s i n g c U R L     371   Chapter 9  11. Print the results.  echo ‘ cURL Results:  ’ . ➝ htmlentities $r  . ‘ ’; Everything returned by the request is assigned to the $r variable. I want  to print this, but since I know it’s a bunch of HTML, I’ll print it within  the preformatted tags, and apply the htmlentities   function. The end  result will be the other page’s HTML shown as the HTML tags.  12. Complete the page.  ?>      13. Save the file as curl.php, place it in  your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 9.16 .  14. Change the POST data to an invalid username password combination  and retest in your Web browser   Figure 9.17 .  ✔ Tips    If a page is protected by HTTP authenti-  cation, use this option: curl_setopt $curl, CURLOPT_USERPWD, ➝ ‘username:password’ ;    The curl_getinfo   function, which  must be called prior to closing the con- nection, returns an array of information about the transaction  Figure 9.18 .    The cURL utility can also be used to send and receive cookies, handle file uploads, work over SSL connections, even FTP files.    Use the curl_errno   and curl_error    functions to retrieve the error number and message, should one occur.  372     L R U c g n i s U  Figure 9.16 The cURL request was able to successfully log in.

Chapter 9, “Networking with PHP,” approaches some behind-the-scenes features of the language, specifically toward the goal of communicating between servers. Continuing along this vein, there’s plenty to discuss when it comes to PHP interacting with, or just how it runs on, the server itself.  A lot of very standard PHP actions, such as communicating with databases and sending emails, actually occur between applications on the server and PHP. As PHP  is increasingly used for advanced purposes and not simply to generate Web content, its ability to manipulate and use the features the server has to offer becomes more important.  This chapter will show you how to better take advantage of the other services and applications that your server may have. Starting off is a demonstration of how to compress files using PHP. The second example takes off into a whole new world: cre- ating graphical programs using PHP-GTK. The third and fourth topics are related to each other: how to automatically run your PHP scripts, first using cron on Unix  and Mac OS X , then using Scheduled Tasks on Windows. In the final example, COM is used on Windows to create an Excel spreadsheet.     P H P a n d t h e S e r v e r     373   Chapter 10  Compressing Files Most users are familiar with client-based GUI compression utilities such as WinZip  or StuffIt, which will compress and decom- press files. Thanks to zlib, available from www.zlib.net, you can have PHP automati- cally compress files as well. The zlib library was written by two of the major compres- sion decompression developers as a patent- free, lossless data-compression tool. Zlib is available on every major platform  even for Palm handhelds!  and is frequently built into a server’s configuration. I would be surprised if a Unix brand of operating system did not include zlib, and you can use a dynamic link library  DLL  version of the library on Windows. In fact, PHP has built-in support for zlib ever since version 4.3.  Once zlib is installed and PHP is made to support it  Figure 10.1 , you can use it for writing to or reading from compressed files. Most of the functions work exactly like the standard file functions  fopen  , fwrite  , fclose  ,… . You start by opening a file, indicating the mode: $fp = gzopen ‘filename.gz’, ‘mode’ ;  The modes, shown in Table 10.1, are the same as those used with fopen  . Added  to this can be a compression level on a scale of 1  least compressed  to 9  most . With an open file, you can then write data to it: $fp = gzopen ‘filename.gz’, ‘w5’ ; gzwrite $fp, ‘data’ ;  Finally, close the file: gzclose $fp ;     s e l i F g n i s s e r p m o C  374  Figure 10.1 Before attempting to use the zlib functions, run a phpinfo   script to confirm PHP’s support for the library.  Table 10.1 Use these letters to set the mode when opening a file. For gzopen  , you can also set the level of compression from 1 to 9 and indicate f, h, and b to further modify the mode. File Open Modes  M o d e r  r+  w  w+  a  a+  x  x  f h b  O p e n   f o r … Reading only, starting at the beginning of  the file. Reading and writing, starting at the beginning of the file.

Reading and writing, starting at the beginning of the file; create the file if it doesn’t exist, indi- cate failure if it does. Filtered data Huffman-only compression Binary mode   PHP and the Server  Reading from files can be even easier. You can use readgzfile  , which reads in a com- pressed file, decompresses the data, and sends it to the output. There is also the gzfile   function, which reads in compressed file, decompresses it, and returns it as an array  one element for each line in the file .  In this next example I’ll have PHP create a compressed file on the fly. The PHP script itself will retrieve all of the data stored in a named database and will create files listing said data in comma-delineated format. In short, this PHP script will create a com- pressed backup of a database’s records. To compress a file: 1. Create a new PHP document in your text  editor or IDE, beginning with the stan- dard HTML  Script 10.1 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset= ➝ iso-8859-1”  >   Database Backup       <?php  Script 10.1 - db_backup.php  2. Set the name of the database.  $db_name = ‘test’; First, I set a variable with the name of the database to be backed up. I do so mostly because the database name will be referenced several times over in this script and I want to make changes easily.  continues on page 378  375  C o m p r e s s i n g F i l e s      Chapter 10  Script 10.1 This very useful script will back up a database, table by table, to a compressed, comma-separated text file.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd”>          Database Backup       <?php  Script 10.1 - db_backup.php  This page retrieves all the data from a database and writes that data to a text file.

Within this directory, each database will have its own directory. First, a variable is given the value of the final destination. Next, the script checks to see if that directory already exists. If not, the script attempts to create it. The script terminates if the directory could not be created  Figure 10.2 , as there’d be no point in continuing. One assumption here is that an existing directory is already writable, something you could easily check for  using the is_writable   function . This section of the code, which is secondary to what’s really being taught, assumes you already understand what permissions must exist for PHP to write to directories.     s e l i F g n i s s e r p m o C  4. Get the current time.  $time = time  ; This value will be used in each table backup’s filename. Because every file should have the same time, I assign this to a variable once, instead of invoking the function once for each file.  5. Connect to the database.  $dbc = @mysqli_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’, $db_name  ➝ OR die  “ The database--$db_ ➝ name--could not be backed ➝ up. \n \n \n” ;  378   Figure 10.3 The result if a database connection could not be made.

PHP and the Server  The script attempts to connect to the named database. If it can’t, a message indicating a problem is displayed in the Web browser  Figure 10.3 , and the HTML page is concluded. You can change the error message to incorporate a MySQL error function, if you want a more informative response. Note, also, that I’m using the Improved MySQL extension functions, available as of PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1. If your setup doesn’t support them, switch to the older MySQL functions instead  changing all the code in the script as needed .  6. Retrieve the tables in this database.  $q = ‘SHOW TABLES’; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; This query will return a list of every table in the current database  Figure 10.4 .  7. Confirm that at least one record was  returned and print a message. if  mysqli_num_rows $r  > 0  {  echo “ Backing up database  ➝ ‘$db_name’. \n”; No need to back up an empty database!  8. Create a loop that fetches each table  name. while  list $table  = mysqli_ ➝ fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM   { 9. Retrieve all the records for this table.  $q2 = “SELECT * FROM $table”; $r2 = mysqli_query $dbc, $q2 ; Since this query is run within a while loop for another query, you have to use a different result variable  $r2 here instead of $r , or else you’ll overwrite the first query’s results. Figure 10.5 shows the result of this query based upon the results in Figure 10.4.  379  C o m p r e s s i n g F i l e s      Chapter 10  10. If the table contains some records, open  11.

All of the files will be written to a database-specific folder within a backup folder. Both directories must have appro- priate permissions for PHP to write to them. The gzopen   function takes two param- eters: the filename and the mode of opening. The modes correspond directly to fopen  ’s modes  w, r, a along with b for writing binary data  but can also indicate a level of compression. The acceptable compression levels are on a scale from 1  minimal compression  to  9  maximum  with a trade-off between compression and performance.

Instead of using the fwrite   function that you may be familiar with, there is gzwrite  , which works just the same  except that it writes to a compressed file .  12.

Create a folder called backups, in the same directory as db_backup.php, and change its permissions  if necessary . How you do this depends upon your operating system, which I assume, as  an experienced PHP developer, you’ve already discovered. If you don’t know how to change a directory’s permissions, search the Web or check out the book’s corresponding support forum  www.DMCInsights.com phorum  .  17.

Change the code to use another database   also changing the MySQL connection parameters, if necessary  and rerun the script in your Web browser  Figures 10.7 and 10.8 .  ✔ Tips    For security purposes, you’d likely want  to place the backups folder outside of the Web directory  considering its open permissions.     The zlib functions can also work with  compressed binary files.  Windows makes a distinction between binary and plain text files, but Unix and Mac OS X do not.  Binary files offer the advantage of being able to read from, and write to, the file in a nonlinear fashion.

But I can provide you with a taste of how it works and then develop a practical, real- world application with only a little bit of know-how.  GTK uses widgets to make applications. A widget can be anything from a window to a button to a table to a text label. To build an application, you create new instances of widgets  PHP uses an OOP interface to GTK  and then apply different properties by calling that widget’s methods. There are special widgets called containers that are used as  parents for other widgets. The primary con- tainer will be a window. The entire applica- tion will exist within this window.  PHP-GTK GTK+, which stands for GIMP Tool Kit  GIMP being the GNU Image Manipulation Program , is an open-source toolkit that works on multiple platforms. This resource makes it easy for programmers to generate graphical elements—windows, buttons, and so on—for their applications. The GTK home page, www.gtk.org, describes the system’s origins and usage but from a C programming perspective  GTK, like PHP, is written in C .  The PHP-GTK Web site, http:  gtk.php.net  Figure 10.10 , discusses how GTK can be used with PHP. To do so, you need a binary version of PHP, GTK+, and the php_gtk module. You can download and configure all of these for a Unix  Linux, etc.  system or retrieve preconfigured binaries for Windows. The Web site Gnope  www.gnope.org  pro- vides a lot of help in this area.  Figure 10.10 The home page of PHP-GTK.  P H P - G T K  385   Figure 10.11 This calculator is actually a PHP script that uses PHP-GTK.  Chapter 10  Besides creating widgets that make up an application, you associate user-defined PHP functions with different widgets so that, for example, when this button is clicked, this function is invoked. A widget listens for sig- nals—user events—and then enacts a call- back—the function that gets called upon for that event. You assign a function to an event using the connect_simple   method.  $widget->connect_simple ‘event’,  ➝ ‘function_name’ ;  The primary event I’ll demonstrate is clicked, indicating that the mouse button was clicked on the widget.  You can pass a value to the callback func- tion by adding it as a parameter to the connect_simple   call. $widget->connect_simple ‘event’, ➝ ‘function_name’, $var ;  These are just the basics of how you’ll use GTK with PHP. Every widget has its own methods and attributes, and GTK includes dozens upon dozens of widgets. I’ll explain in more detail in this example, a simple graphical calculator  Figure 10.11 . For each action that takes place in the calculator—entering a number, selecting an operator, clicking clear, and clicking equals—a user-defined function must exist. Those will be written first. These functions will work with the three main variables the calculator requires: two numbers for the operands  the numbers used in the math  and one variable storing the selected operator.

Make sure that the GTK module has  been loaded. if  !class_exists ‘gtk’   die ‘The ➝ PHP-Gtk2 module has not been ➝ loaded!’ ; With GTK2 and PHP 5, you cannot load the library dynamically using the dl   function. Instead, you must be using a version of PHP with built-in support for the library. This line checks that the GTK class has been defined, killing the script otherwise  Figure 10.12 .  3. Create a function for clearing the   calculator. function clear    {  global $n1, $n2, $operator; $n1 = false; $n2 = false; $operator = false; set_display   ;  } This function will reset the three main global variables. The first two—$n1 and $n2—store the two numbers used in any calculation  even if you add 30 numbers together, that’s really just adding two numbers at a time, repeatedly . The third variable, $operator, will store a string indicating what operation was selected. Finally, this function calls the user-defined set_display   function, which sets the value of the calculator’s display  the default value being 0 .  4. Write the function that will set the value  of the display window. function set_display  $value = 0  {  global $display; $display->set_text  $value ;  }  continues on next page  391  P H P - G T K   Chapter 10  The global $display variable refers to the widget that is the calculator’s display win- dow. The widget itself is a label, which is merely a display of text. The set_text   method will place a string  or, in this case, a number  on that label. Anytime a num- ber is entered or a calculation is made, this function will be called so that the resulting number is shown in the display.  5. Begin the calculate   function.  function calculate    {  global $n1, $n2, $operator; $value = $n1;  The calculate   function will do the actual math. It uses three global vari- ables—the $n1 number, the $n2 number, and the $operator. This function is called when the equals sign is clicked or when a second operator is selected. For example, if a user clicks 10 + 9 + 8 =, the calculate   function is called twice  once after the second plus, to add  10 + 9, and again after the equals, to  add 19 + 8 . The $value variable is used internally by this function. It’s initialized as $n1.  6. Create the main switch.  switch  $operator  {  case ‘add’:  $value = $n1 + $n2; break;  case ‘subtract’:  $value = $n1 - $n2; break;  case ‘multiply’:  $value = $n1 * $n2; break; case ‘divide’:  $value = $n1   $n2; break;  K T G - P H P  }  392  This calculator performs four kinds of calculations, depending upon the value  of $operator.  7. Complete the function.  set_display  $value ; $n1 = $value; $operator = false; $n2 = false;  }    End of calculate   function. After doing the math, the determined value will be shown in the calculator dis- play via the set_display   function. Then the $n1 value is assigned the value of the current $value, allowing for a continued calculation. An entry of 2 + 3 + 4 is really 2 + 3 = 5  which is assigned to $n1 , plus 4.  8. Write a function for assigning the operator.  function set_operator  $which  {  global $operator; if  $operator  calculate  ; $operator = $which;  } This function is called whenever one of the four operators—+, –, *,  —is clicked. It assigns the string version of that oper- ator to the global $operator variable. Before doing so, it will check if a calcula- tion should be made. To explain… The $operator variable starts with a value of false  also the case when the calculator is cleared . If a user clicks 2 + 3 + 4, then $n1 is assigned the value of 2  in the set_number   function, written next , $operator is assigned the value of add, and then $n2 is assigned the value of 3. When the user clicks the next +, set_operator   is called again. This func- tion sees that $operator already has a value and knows that the calculations thus far must be completed  because the calcula- tor only stores two numbers at a time .   Figure 10.13 Allowing for multidigit numbers, like 12, requires a little thought. My trick is to track the $operator variable.  PHP and the Server  9. Make a function for building up numbers.  function set_number  $value  {  global $n1, $n2, $operator; if  !$operator  {  $n1 .= $value; set_display $n1 ;  $n2 .= $value; set_display $n2 ;  } else {  }  } When any of the number buttons are clicked, along with the decimal point, the calculator will need to keep track of the $n1 and $n2 values  which will be used for the calculations . If, for example, the user clicks 1 and then 2, that should be 12. To accomplish this, the function works like so: It receives the $value every time a number or the decimal is clicked. If the $operator variable is equal to false, which means that it has been reset or has no value, then the user is building up the $n1 number and the new value should be concatenated to the old. If $operator has a value such as add or subtract, then the user has stopped entering the $n1 num- ber and is working on entering the $n2 number. The number that the user is making will be displayed in the calculator window  Figure 10.13 .  continues on next page  P H P - G T K  393   10. Make the global variables.  12. Make a secondary container.  Chapter 10  $n1 = false; $n2 = false; $operator = false; All of the functions have been written, so now it’s into the heart of the code. These are the three global variables used by the functions. Initializing them like so isn’t strictly necessary but is good programming form.  11. Make the window widget.  $window = new GtkWindow  ; $window->set_title  ‘Calculator’ ; $window->set_default_size  320, ➝ 320 ; The $window variable is the first and most important of all the widgets. It acts as a container for everything. The GtkWindow   widget has multiple meth- ods, including set_title  , which ends up in the taskbar  Figure 10.14 , and set_default_size  .  $box = new GtkVBox  ; $window->add $box ; The box is another container widget into which I’ll place the calculator. I could have multiple boxes within my window, should I choose  perhaps another box would contain a Close button . I use the window’s add   method to physically place the box in the window.  13. Create a table.  $table = new GtkTable 5, 6 ; $table->set_row_spacings 2 ; $table->set_col_spacings 2 ; $table->set_border_width 5 ; $box->pack_start $table ; Making tables with GTK is slightly trick- ier than it is with HTML. I first make a new table object, setting the number of  Figure 10.14 The window widget’s title value applies when the operating system refers to the application, as in the taskbar.  K T G - P H P  394   rows and columns I intend to use. The tricky part is that although I want my table to have four rows and five columns, I need to add one extra of each. This is because elements are placed from, say, row 1 to row 2 and column 1 to column 2. Thus, an element in the fourth row will go from row 4 to row 5. The final line in this section of code— $box->pack_start $table ; —says to place the table just created onto the box made earlier. 14. Create a display window.  $display = new GtkLabel ‘display’ ; $table->attach $display, 1, 4, 1, ➝ 2 ; The display window of the calculator  is a label—a simple noneditable text field. After creating the label  whose name is display , it should be placed  on, or attached to, the table. The attach   method takes the following arguments: the widget being attached, the x starting point, the x stopping point, the y starting point, and the y stopping point. I want the label to go from 1 to 4 along the x-axis  i.e., across three columns  and from 1 to 2 on the y  just one row .  15. Place all of the number buttons. for  $i = 0; $i <= 9; $i++  {  switch  $i  {  case 0:  $x = 1; $y = 5; break;  $x = 1; $y = 4; break;  $x = 2;  case 1:  case 2:  PHP and the Server  case 3:  case 4:  case 5:  case 6:  case 7:  case 8:  case 9:  $y = 4; break;  $x = 3; $y = 4; break;  $x = 1; $y = 3; break;  $x = 2; $y = 3; break;  $x = 3; $y = 3; break;  $x = 1; $y = 2; break;  $x = 2; $y = 2; break;  $x = 3; $y = 2; break;  P H P - G T K  } $button = new GtkButton $i ; $button->connect_simple  ➝  ‘clicked’, ‘set_number’, $i ; $table->attach $button, $x,  ➝  $x+1 , $y,  $y+1  ; }    End of 0-9 FOR loop.  continues on next page  395   Chapter 10  To make these ten buttons, I loop through the numbers 0 through 9. I then determine the x- and y-coordinates of each on my table  use Figure 10.11 as a reference . Once I know the coordinates, I can create a new button. The button will then be told to watch for when the user clicks it, by attaching the set_number   function to the clicked event. When that occurs, I also want to pass the value of the button, which is the number  $i , to the function as well. Looking back at the set_number   function written earlier, you will see  that it receives a $value, which is this  $i value here. The final step is to place this button on the table, using the predetermined x- and y-coordinates.  16. Create the decimal button.  $decimal = new GtkButton ‘.’ ; $decimal->connect_simple  ‘clicked’, ➝ ‘set_number’, ‘.’ ; $table->attach $decimal,  ➝ 2, 3, 5, 6 ; The decimal point has a value of a peri- od. When clicked, the set_number   function should be called, so that the decimal is concatenated to the operand.  17. Create the equals button.  $equals = new GtkButton ‘=’ ; $equals->connect_simple  ‘clicked’, ➝ ‘calculate’ ; $table->attach $equals, 3, 4, 5, 6 ; This button differs from the decimal button in that the calculate function should be called when it is clicked. It passes no values to that function.  K T G - P H P  396  18. Create the clear button.  $clear = new GtkButton ‘C’ ; $clear->connect_simple  ‘clicked’, ➝ ‘clear’ ; $table->attach $clear, 4, 5, 1, 2 ; This button just calls the clear   func- tion when clicked.  19. Create the operator buttons. $add = new GtkButton ‘+’ ; $add->connect_simple  ‘clicked’, ➝ ‘set_operator’, ‘add’ ; $table->attach $add, 4, 5, 2, 3 ; $subtract = new GtkButton ‘-’ ; $subtract->connect_simple ➝  ‘clicked’, ‘set_operator’, ➝ ‘subtract’ ; $table->attach $subtract,  ➝ 4, 5, 3, 4 ; $multiply = new GtkButton ‘*’ ; $multiply->connect_simple ➝  ‘clicked’, ‘set_operator’, ➝ ‘multiply’ ; $table->attach $multiply,  ➝ 4, 5, 4, 5 ; $divide = new GtkButton ‘ ’ ; $divide->connect_simple  ‘clicked’, ➝ ‘set_operator’, ‘divide’ ; $table->attach $divide, 4, 5, 5, 6 ; Each of these operator buttons is linked to the set_operator   function. They pass a string value to it: add, subtract, multiply, divide.  20. Call the clear   function to reset the  calculator. clear  ; If you look at the code in Step 3, you will see that this function voids out any value for $n1 and $n2 and resets the $operator. It also sets the value of the display win- dow to 0  by calling the set_display   function .   Figure 10.15 The calculator will need to be started through a command-line interface. I’m using Windows here; see Chapter 11, “PHP’s Command-Line Interface,” for more on Windows or Unix command- line operations.  PHP and the Server  21. Finish the script.  $window->connect_simple  ‘destroy’, ➝ array ‘Gtk’, ‘main_quit’  ; $window->show_all  ; Gtk::main  ; ?> One of the events you will want to  watch for is when the user quits or  closes the application. At that time, the GTK’s main_quit   method should be called. The line of code that associates main_quit   with a destroy event is something you’ll have verbatim in every PHP-GTK application. Next, I call the show_all   method, which reveals every element—the box, the table, the buttons, and the label— within the window. The opposite of show_all    or show   for a specific widget  is hide  , which makes a widget invisible without destroying it. Finally, I call the main   method, the most important line of all. This function starts a loop in which the application will watch for user events. Unlike a standard PHP script, which does noth- ing else once it has completed running, this script will continue to be active until the user quits the application. It’s the main   method that gives it this dimension.  P H P - G T K  22. Save the file as calculator.php and load it on your computer or server that sup- ports PHP-GTK.  23.

Hopefully this script has given you the know-how to make your own improve- ments to it, should you desire. It would not be that hard to add, for example, memory buttons  M+, M–, MC, MR  or to create a second window that shows a “paper tape” of the calculations.  ✔ Tips    The calculator as created relies upon the clicking of the buttons using the mouse. There is also a way to tie specific keys to specific buttons, allowing for use of the calculator with just the keyboard.    When creating programs that use PHP-  GTK, you can still use the print   or echo   functions to send text to the command-line window. This will give you a way to debug your scripts.    You can connect multiple callback func-  tions to a single widget using multiple $widget->connect_simple   lines. The callback functions will be called in order when the event signal is sent.  K T G - P H P  398  Figure 10.16 Make sure you run the script using a version of PHP with support for GTK.  Figure 10.17 The calculator allows me to enter multiple-digit numbers for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  Figure 10.18 Calculations are made when the equals button is clicked  or when repeated operators are clicked .   PHP and the Server  Another example would be: 0 1 * * 1-5 mail –s ‘Howdy’ ➝ phpvqp2@DMCinsights.com  This line states that from Monday through Friday  1–5 , at 1 A.M.  0 minutes, 1 hour  every day of the month and every month of the year  * *  it will send me an email  apparently I like email .  To use cron to run a PHP script, you have a couple of options. The first is to use the server’s own Web browser—like Lynx or Wget—to run a PHP script. Another would be to use the server’s installation of cURL. This program works very well with URLs, although it’s not a Web browser, per se. A final option is to run the PHP script using the Command-Line Interface  see Chapter 11, “PHP’s Command-Line Interface” .  For this example, I’ll run the db_backup.php script  Script 10.1  created earlier in the chapter, using cURL. The syntax for using cURL is easy: curl yourURLhere  So: curl http:  www.example.com page.php  To add an item to the crontab file, you can manually edit it by typing crontab -e in a command prompt. This will allow you to edit the file using your default command- line text editor. Unfortunately, if you don’t know how to already use said text editor—a surprisingly daunting task—this does you no good. So instead I’ll show you another method….  Establishing a cron A cron is a service on Unix servers that allows tasks to be scheduled and executed automat- ically. The cron application runs constantly and will, according to instructions, carry out its orders. These orders are stored in a file called crontab. This file is a to-do list that contains lines that might look like this: 30 22 * * * lynx --dump http:   ➝ www.DMCinsights.com >  dev null  The crontab format dictates that each line contain six fields separated by spaces or tabs. The first five fields represent, in order, minutes, hours, days, months, and day of the week  from 0 to 6, with 0 being Sunday . Notice that you can specify the day of opera- tion as either a day of the month  1–31  or a day of the week  Sunday through Saturday , the latter being date-indifferent.  An asterisk as one of the first five parameters means that value is not limited  i.e., it always applies . In the preceding example, the instruction is to be carried out at 10:30 P.M.  22 being 10 P.M. on the 24-hour clock  every day of the month, every month of the year.  You can also set ranges using the hyphen  1–6 for the month field would mean that the job applies to the first six months of the year  or list elements separated by comma   1, 3, 5 for Monday, Wednesday, Friday . The sixth field on each line is the task itself.  Looking at the preceding example, the actual command is to open the URL www.DMCinsights.com with Lynx, a text- based Web browser built into Unix. The  --dump and >  dev null tell Lynx to close itself after viewing the site and not to store the information accessed.  E s t a b l i s h i n g a c r o n        399   Figure 10.19 Before entering the command into the crontab file, I test it once to confirm the results.  Script 10.4 The cronjob1 file lists the command to be added to crontab.  1  1 0 * * 5 curl http:  localhost  db_backup.php  Chapter 10  To establish a cron for a PHP file: 1. Access your server via a command-line  interface. For Mac OS X and other Unix users,  this likely means opening the Terminal application.  2. Test the command  Figure 10.19 .  curl http:  localhost db_backup.php It’s always best to test the command you’ll have cron execute so that you know that it works. Do so just by enter- ing the command within the Terminal application. You’ll obviously need to change your URL to match where you put your copy of db_backup.php. In this case, it’s running on the same server.  3. View the current contents of the   crontab file. crontab -l This command will show you the current crontab, which you should be careful with, as the following steps will replace any existing instructions. If you’ve never worked with the crontab before, it’s prob- ably blank, but better safe than sorry! 4. Create a new document in your text   editor or IDE  Script 10.4 . 1 0 * * 5 curl http:  localhost  ➝ db_backup.php First you’ll write a dummy cronjob file, and then you’ll install this into the actual crontab. This file should contain the entire command. Make sure you press Enter Return once at the end of the line. The command itself says that cURL should be invoked with that URL every Friday  5  at 12:01 A.M.        n o r c a g n i h s i l b a t s E  400   Figure 10.20 Adding the new instruction to the crontab file.  Figure 10.21 Confirming the contents of the crontab file.    A couple more helpful cURL options… The -o option lets you specify a text file where the output will be written: curl -o  path to filename.txt ➝ http:  www.example.com The -s option runs cURL in silent mode  so it doesn’t return the results : curl -s http:  www.example.com The -retry option tells cURL to attempt to access the URL X number of times   if it fails : curl -retry X http:  www.example.com    To see more information about using  cron, type man cron or man crontab in the command line.  PHP and the Server  5. If Step 3 revealed anything in the current  crontab, add it to the text document begun in Step 4. Just copy-paste whatever was returned in Step 3 to the text document. Each task should be on its own line.  6. Save this file as cronjob1  without any  extension  and upload it to the server in a convenient location  not necessarily within the Web document root .  7. Within your server’s command prompt, enter the following code and then press Enter Return once: crontab  path to cronjob1 In my example  Figure 10.20 , cronjob1 is stored on the desktop of user larryull- man. The full path is therefore  Users  larryullman Desktop cronjob1. Replace that part of the code with the applicable location of your cronjob1 file on the server.  8. Confirm the cron task list by viewing the  crontab file  Figure 10.21 . crontab –l  ✔ Tips    If you are using a hosted Web site, the hosting company will often provide a Web-based interface to the cron utility.    The crontab is unique for each user on  the server. This also means that the instructions in the crontab file will run as that user, so permissions conflicts may arise.  E s t a b l i s h i n g a c r o n        401   Chapter 10  Scheduling Tasks on Windows The cron utility works on Unix for schedul- ing tasks, but it is not present on Windows. Windows users can instead work with Scheduled Tasks. The operating system pro- vides a wizard for easily adding a task, which I’ll run through in the following steps. The specific task to be scheduled will be the exe- cution of the db_backup.php script. To schedule a task on Windows: 1. Click Start menu > All Programs >  Accessories > System Tools > Scheduled Tasks  Figure 10.22 .  2. In the resulting window  Figure 10.23 ,  double-click Add Scheduled Task.  3. In the first window of the Scheduled  Task Wizard, click Next.  4. In the next window  Figure 10.24 , click  Browse.  5. Using the Select Program to Schedule  window, select the PHP script to execute  Figure 10.25 , and then click Open. 6. In the next window  Figure 10.26 ,  enter a name for this task, choose when the task should run, and click Next. The running options are: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, One time only, When my com- puter starts, and When I log on.        s w o d n i W n o s k s a T g n i l u d e h c S     Figure 10.22 Begin by navigating to the Scheduled Tasks window.  Figure 10.24 In this prompt, you select which application should be scheduled.  Figure 10.23 The Scheduled Tasks window.  402  Figure 10.25 Find the PHP script that you want to run.   7. Fine-tune how and when the task runs. The choice made in Step 6 will dictate what options appear. Figure 10.27 shows the weekly scheduling options. If in Step 6 you chose either of the last two options, you’ll go straight to Step 8.  8. Enter the username and password of the user for whom the task should run, and then click Next  Figure 10.28 . 9. In the last window, click Finish.  PHP and the Server  ✔ Tips    This method of directly running a PHP  script in Windows assumes that you have already configured Windows to run PHP scripts using the PHP executable. This is discussed in Chapter 11.    To edit an existing task, follow Step 1, and then double-click the name of the task listed in the window  under Add Scheduled Task .  Figure 10.26 Tasks can be given a descriptive name and scheduled in all sorts of ways.  Figure 10.28 Tasks can be run under different users.

S c h e d u l i n g T a s k s o n W i n d o w s        403   Chapter 10  Using COM with PHP Added in PHP 4 is support for COM on Windows operating systems. COM, which stands for Component Object Module, is a technology developed by Microsoft to con- trol its applications via a programming lan- guage, notably Visual Basic. It is related to other Microsoft technologies such as OLE  Object Linking and Embedding  and ActiveX.  Microsoft has defined every function and attribute that an application—such as Word or Excel—has as an object with methods and properties. Using the proper notation, you can then control the application with Visual Basic or, in this case, PHP. You begin by creating a new object using the name of the application and PHP’s com   function. $word = new COM ‘word.application’ ;  You can set the application to run either vis- ibly on the computer or invisibly by setting the Visible value  this step is not required . $word->Visible = 1;    Visible  Once the application is running, you begin by creating a new document. $word->Documents->Add  ;  Now, in the case of a Word document, you can start adding text to the page. $word->Selection-> ➝ TypeText ‘mmmm…COM...’ ;  Finally, save the document and quit Word. $word->Documents[1]->SaveAs ‘com.doc’ ; $word->Quit  ;        P H P h t i w M O C g n i s U     404   Figure 10.29 The Visual Basic editor provides useful tools for working with COM elements.  Figure 10.30 The Object Browser lists all the properties and methods of existing objects.  PHP and the Server  As you can see from those lines, accessing COM with PHP is fairly simple and direct; the most complicated issue will be under- standing what objects are available in an application and how exactly you should  refer to them. You have several options:  ◆ Pick up a book that covers COM for the  specific application you are using.  ◆ Learn Visual Basic, which will help with knowing the different objects available.  ◆ Use the Visual Basic Help aspect of the  application itself.  ◆ Search the Internet!  I’ve taken all of these steps, and still, under- standing how to do certain things can be a challenge. But if you work with Windows a lot, mastering this skill can be very useful.  For some assistance, once you have opened an application, like Word or Excel, press Alt+F11 to bring up the Visual Basic editor  Figure 10.29 . Then press F2 to view the Object Browser  Figure 10.30 . By clicking and viewing the different elements in the Object Browser, you can see how the differ- ent objects, methods, and attributes you’ll need relate. To get a jump-start on under- standing COM for an application, use the Visual Basic Help application.  As an example of using COM technology with PHP, I’ll write a script similar to db_backup.php. Instead of creating a CSV file, this version will create an Excel spread- sheet containing the database’s data.  Note that support for COM is built into  PHP but that it only exists on Windows.  You should also have some familiarity with OOP before proceeding, as COM is entirely object-based.     U s i n g C O M w i t h P H P        405   Chapter 10  To use COM with PHP: 1. Create a new PHP document in your text editor or IDE, beginning with the HTML  Script 10.5 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset= ➝ iso-8859-1”  >   Excel Backup       <?php  Script 10.5 - excel_backup.php  2. Increase the allowable time limit for  script execution. set_time_limit 300 ; The set_time_limit   function deter- mines, in seconds, at what point the script has taken too long. Because this script will need to open, write to, save, and quit an application, the default time limit—probably 30 seconds, depending on the setting in your php.ini file— needs to be increased. Five minutes should be adequate, but there would be little harm in doubling or tripling that value, depending on the complexity of the script.  continues on page 410        P H P h t i w M O C g n i s U     406   Script 10.5 This PHP script makes use of COM to back up a MySQL database to an Excel spreadsheet.

Create an instance of the COM object.  $excel = new COM  “excel.application”  or die  “Cannot ➝ start Excel.  ” ; echo “ Loaded Excel Version  ➝ $excel->Version \n”; You may need to change the name of the application if your system has trouble with excel.application.  I am running this script on a server with Windows XP and Office 2003.  Just for the heck of it, I’m going to print the version of Excel loaded to the Web browser so that I know it’s working  Figure 10.31 . If the COM object cannot be created, the script terminates immediately. The script may function differently on your computer, but in my case, each cre- ation of a new COM object will open up a new copy of that application, so be careful not to overburden the server when using COM.  4. Begin a try…catch block and set the   visibility of the application. try {  $excel->Visible = 0;  By using try and catch, I can easily  handle any COM errors that occur  see Chapter 8, “Real-World OOP,” for more  on this concept . I set the Visible prop- erty to 0 so that Excel is opened in an invisible manner.        P H P h t i w M O C g n i s U     410   PHP and the Server  5.

Create a new workbook and save the   document. $workbook = $excel->Workbooks->Add  ; $workbook->SaveAs “C:\Documents and ➝ Settings\Larry Ullman\Desktop\ ➝ db_backup.xls” ; The first line creates a workbook, which Excel itself would normally do if it were opened as a regular application. Then  I immediately save the file to the com- puter. You’ll need to provide a valid full pathname and a unique filename for your server.  7. Set the initial sheet number.  $sheet_number = 1; An Excel document is called a workbook and is made up of sheets. For backing up a MySQL database, I’ll want to put one table on each sheet, so I need to track the number of sheets to reference them.  continues on next page     U s i n g C O M w i t h P H P        411   Figure 10.32 Excel starts off with three sheets.  Figure 10.33 The sheet names will reflect the MySQL table names.  Chapter 10  8. Fetch each table name and fetch the data  in that table. while  list $table  = mysqli_fetch_ ➝ array $r, MYSQLI_NUM   {  $q2 = “SELECT * FROM $table”;  $r2 = mysqli_query $dbc, $q2 ; if  mysqli_num_rows $r2  > 0  { 9. Create a new sheet for each table.  $sheet = ‘Sheet’ . $sheet_number; if  $sheet_number > 3   ➝ $workbook->Sheets->Add; $worksheet =  ➝ $workbook->Worksheets $sheet ; $worksheet->Activate; $worksheet->Name = $table; This is starting to get a little compli- cated. First, understand that Excel, by default, creates a workbook with three sheets, called Sheet1, Sheet2, and Sheet3  Figure 10.32 . So to reference a sheet by name, I use the syntax SheetX, which is why I want to track the sheet number. For the first three tables, I can use these first three sheets. The last three lines of code here select a sheet, assigning it to $work- sheet, make it active, and then rename it to the table name  Figure 10.33 . But if a database has more than three tables, extra sheets are necessary. In those cases, a new sheet is added  line 2 of this step’s code .        P H P h t i w M O C g n i s U     412   10. Initialize a row value.  $excel_row = 1; Each table’s data should begin in the first row, so I set a variable to this value for each table.  11. Fetch all the records and initialize a col-  umn counter. while  $row = mysqli_fetch_array $r2,  ➝ MYSQLI_NUM   {  $excel_col = 1;  Each record of each table should start in the first column, so I initialize another variable inside of this loop.  12. Place the data into the Excel spreadsheet.  foreach  $row as $value  {  $cell = $worksheet-  ➝ >Cells $excel_row,$excel_col ;  if  is_numeric $value   {  $cell->Value = $value;  } else {  ➝ = ‘@’;  $cell->NumberFormat   $cell->Value = $value;  } $excel_col++;  } The foreach loop will loop through  each record returned, accessing a single column’s value at a time. This value should be placed in a column of the spreadsheet. Within the loop, the cell is identified using the $excel_row and $excel_col variables, going from 1, 1 to X, Y, where X is the number of rows in the MySQL table and Y is the number of columns.  PHP and the Server  Once you’ve identified the column, you can put some data there by referring to $cell->Value. Unfortunately, if the value being stored has certain characters in it  if, for instance, it starts with an equals sign , it’ll cause errors. So I first check if the value is numeric, in which case it can just be written to the spreadsheet. Otherwise, I change the formatting of the cell to text, and then set the value. Finally, the column count is increased so that the next MySQL column goes into the next spreadsheet column. It is possible to define a range of cells and place all of the data at once, but I’m trying to keep this as straightforward as possible.  13. Complete the while loop, print a mes- sage to the browser, increase the sheet count, and save the file.  $excel_row++;  }    End of table WHILE loop. echo “ Table ‘$table’ backed ➝ up. \n”; $sheet_number++; $workbook->Save  ; The while loop closed here is the one that returned all the records for a single table. Within the while loop, the row variable needs to be increased  so that the next record is placed on the next row of the spreadsheet . After that, a message is printed in the browser and the sheet count is increased  because each sheet matches a table . To be safe, the spreadsheet is then saved.  14.

PHP and the Server  ✔ Tips    Within the Unix family of operating   systems you can connect to other appli- cations using popen   and pclose  , which create pipes—avenues of  communication.    Another way to see what COM properties  you’ll need is to record a macro in the application that does what you intend to do. Then view this macro in the macro editor to see what terminology it uses.    There are already COM classes available  such as the Excel class at http:   sourceforge.net projects psxlsgen.    PHP 5 also supports interactions with  .NET objects.

There are many PHP func- tions available for executing server com- mands. For starters, there is exec  : exec command, $output ;  This function takes a command and assigns to $output an array where each element is a line of the generated output.  There is also system  , which just returns the output  so that it could be immedi- ately sent to the Web browser : system command ;  The passthru   function is similar, but it can also return binary output: passthru command ;  Finally, you could use shell_exec   or the backticks, both of which just return the output: $var = shell_exec command ; $var = `command`;  For security purposes, you should use escapeshellarg   or escapeshellcmd   to sanctify any command that isn’t  hard-coded.

Inevitably, developers started asking: If I can use PHP for Web pages, why can’t I use it for other things, too? Why not, indeed! The people behind PHP came around to this way of thinking circa PHP 4.2, and PHP CLI  Command Line Interface  was born. As of PHP 4.3, it’s part of the default configuration for all installations. Now you can do the equivalent of shell scripting  command-line programming  using your favorite language, PHP.  PHP CLI lets you run PHP scripts and even snippets of PHP code outside of a Web browser. On Windows, the action takes place within a DOS prompt  aka a console or command window . On Unix and Mac OS X, you’ll use Terminal  or a similar program . The CLI is best used for:     ’  P H P s C o m m a n d - L i n e    I n t e r f a c e  ◆ Quickly testing bits of PHP code  ◆ Performing routine maintenance  ◆ Creating your own system utilities  ◆ Making installers for your PHP applications  In this chapter I’ll cover what you need to know to accomplish these tasks. As an understanding of PHP itself is assumed, the focus will be on the fundamentals of using this new interface.  417   Chapter 11  Testing Your Installation To get the ball rolling, the first thing you’ll need to do is confirm that you have an available PHP CLI and to see what version you have  see the sidebar “CLI vs. CGI” . Hopefully, this is just a matter of: 1. Opening a command-line interface. 2. Typing php -v and pressing Return   or Enter.  If the CLI version of PHP is installed and is  in your PATH  a list of locations on your com- puter where the operating system is likely  to find executable files , this should work. Worst-case scenario—assuming PHP CLI is installed, you’ll need to use the full path to the CLI executable or move into the PHP directory first.  Along with the -v option, there are three others to point out up front:  ◆ -i reveals information about the PHP  installation.  ◆ -h accesses the help file.  ◆ -m lists the modules compiled into this  PHP installation.  I’ll formally run through these steps for both Windows and Unix Mac OS X users.  n o i t a l l a t s n I   r u o Y g n i t s e T     418  CLI vs. CGI  There are two versions of PHP that can be used for command-line scripting.  The older version is the CGI  Common Gateway Interface . It’s intended for Web pages but could also be used for shell scripts. The only drawback is that it needs to be told to behave differently or else it’s likely to clutter up the command- line interface.  The CLI version is really a pared-down CGI, lacking GET and POST variables. It also does not send out MIME headers, which are needed for Web pages but not for consoles. The CLI version also does not use HTML in its errors, and it has no maximum execution time.   PHP’s Command-Line Interface  To test your installation on  Windows XP: 1. Click the Start menu. 2. In the Start menu, click Run  Figure 11.1 . 3. At the Run prompt, type cmd  Figure 11.2   and click OK  or press Enter .  4. In the console window, type php -v and  press Enter  Figure 11.3 . This should show you the PHP and CLI versions installed.  5. Still in the console window, type php -i and press Enter to learn more about the installation. This is the equivalent of running a phpinfo   script within a Web browser. There’s a ton of information available here, although you’ll need to scroll back to view it all  and possibly increase the console’s buffer size before running this command .  continues on next page     T e s t i n g Y o u r   I n s t a l l a t i o n  419  Figure 11.1 My Start menu; the Run option appears in the second column.  Figure 11.2 The Run prompt.  Figure 11.3 The command php -v shows the version of PHP CLI installed.   Chapter 11  6.  Having not left the console window…  Type php -m and press Enter to see what modules are installed  Figure 11.4 . This lists the extensions that the PHP installation supports.  7.  Where else but…  In the console win- dow, type php -h and press Enter to see the help menu. The help file, should you need…um…help, is mostly just a listing of the few basic options.  8. In the console window, type exit and  press Enter to close the window.  ✔ Tips    My Windows console window may not look like yours, so don’t be alarmed. I’ve tried to “pretty it up” by changing from the default colors to black text on a white background. To do so, click the icon in the upper-left corner, and then click Properties.    Another change I make in my console  window is that I change the prompt from the default  which is the current directo- ry followed by >  to a simple colon. To do so, type prompt X and press Enter, where X is whatever you want the prompt to be.    At the time of this writing, the next ver- sion of Windows after XP—Vista—hasn’t yet been released. Regardless, the early reviews suggest that Vista will still have a Start menu, within which you can access the Run prompt. So these instructions should continue to work when Windows Vista finally hits the scene.  n o i t a l l a t s n I   r u o Y g n i t s e T     420  Figure 11.4 The list of modules built into this PHP CLI installation.   Figure 11.5 The command php -v shows the version of PHP CLI installed.  Figure 11.6 The PHP CLI help file.  Figure 11.7 The PHP CLI man page, quite similar to the help file  Figure 11.6 .  PHP’s Command-Line Interface  To test your installation on Unix  and Mac OS X: 1. Open your Terminal application.  Most flavors of Unix that I’m familiar with as well as Mac OS X provide an application called Terminal, which is used for command-line operations. It’s likely present in your Applications folder, or wherever your OS keeps its programs. 2. In the console window, type php -v and  press Enter  Figure 11.5 . This should show you the PHP and CLI versions installed.  3. Still in the console window, type php -i and press Enter to learn more about the installation. This is the equivalent of running a phpinfo   script within a Web browser. There’s a ton of information available here, although you’ll need to scroll back to catch it all  and possibly increase the console’s buffer size .  4.  Having not left the console window…  Type php -m and press Enter to see what modules are installed. This lists the extensions that the PHP installation supports.  5.  Where else but…  In the console win- dow, type php -h and press Enter to see the help menu  Figure 11.6 . The help file, should you need…um…help, is mostly just a listing of the few basic options.  6. In the console window, type exit and  press Enter to close the window.  ✔ Tip    There is, on Unix and Mac OS X, a man-  ual page installed for the PHP CLI. To access it, type man php  Figure 11.7 .  421     T e s t i n g Y o u r   I n s t a l l a t i o n   Chapter 11  Executing Bits of Code One of the first uses I find for PHP CLI is  to be able to test snippets of code without going through the process of: 1. Writing a formal PHP script. 2. Placing it in a Web directory. 3. Running it in a Web browser.  You can test small sections of code using this syntax: php -r ‘php_code_here’  For a predictable example: php -r ‘echo “Hello, world!”;’  A couple of things to memorize with this syntax: First, using PHP tags will cause parse errors  Figure 11.8 . Second, it’s safest to use single quotes around the code block. Without getting too deep into the reasons why, if you have variables in your code and use double quotation marks for the whole block, you’ll get wonky results  Figure 11.9 .  Finally, you should end each statement in PHP with a semicolon, just as you would in a script.     e d o C   f o s t i B g n i t u c e x E     422  Figure 11.8 Do not use PHP tags with the php -r option.  Figure 11.9 It’s best not to use double quotation marks around your PHP code, or else any variables used might create parse errors or worse.  Using a Remote Server  If you want to work with PHP CLI on a remote server instead of a local one, that may also be an option. To do so, you must first make sure that the server’s administrator—be it an ISP, hosting com- pany, or whoever—allows remote logins. If so, they should provide you with a user- name and password.  Next, you need an SSH application to connect to that server  SSH provides a secure connection between two comput- ers . If running Unix or Mac OS X, you can use SSH within a Terminal, typing ssh -l username address  After the lowercase “L”, enter your user- name. For the address, this can be either a URL—www.example.com—or an IP address  123.123.123.123 . You’ll then be prompted for the password.  For Windows users, I recommend PuTTY  search the Web for the current URL . This simple and free application provides a graphical interface along with the SSH and Telnet clients.  Once connected to the remote server, you can follow the other steps in this chapter.   Figure 11.10 Among its many benefits, PHP CLI provides yet another way to say Hello, world!  Figure 11.11 Using two lines of PHP code, I can print a formatted version of a file’s last modification date.  Figure 11.12 Thanks to the printed newlines, the command prompt no longer appears immediately after the result of the code  compare with Figure 11.10 .  ✔ Tip    In truth, what PHP CLI offers is a way for  PHP programmers to do things they might otherwise do using Perl, awk, or shell scripts. Or in some cases, PHP CLI might replicate what is already possible using built-in utilities that you’re unfa- miliar with. This is fine, of course, as the benefit of PHP CLI is having a new way to use the knowledge you already possess.  PHP’s Command-Line Interface  To use PHP CLI for code blocks: 1. Follow the steps in the first section of this chapter so that you can access PHP CLI. By this I just mean: open a Terminal application  Mac OS X and Unix , bring up a DOS prompt  Windows , or connect to your remote server.  2. Test an echo   statement  Figure 11.10 .  php -r ‘echo “Hello, world!”;’ The PHP code being tested is echo “Hello, world!”; This is wrapped within single quotes and placed after php -r to execute it.  3. Print the modification date of a file   Figure 11.11 . php -r ‘$ts = filemtime “ Users larryullman Desktop ➝  php number.php” ; echo date  “F j Y H:i:s”, $ts ;’ Here I’m actually executing two lines of PHP code. In the first line, the $ts vari- able is assigned the timestamp value of the last time the number.php file was modified. In the second line, that time- stamp is formatted using the date   function, and printed. Because of the sin- gle quotes surrounding the entire PHP code block, I can enter this over multiple lines  see the figure . Obviously you’ll need to change the path to the file so that it’s appropriate for a file—any file—on your server.  4. Add a newline or two to the printed  result  Figure 11.12 . php -r ‘echo “Hello, world! \n\n”; ‘ By printing newline characters, I can add spacing to the output.  423     E x e c u t i n g B i t s o f   C o d e      Chapter 11  Creating a  Command-Line Script Being able to test little bits of PHP code from the command line is nice, but it won’t take you far. What you’ll really want to do is run entire PHP scripts from the command- line interface. Such scripts could perform file or database maintenance, run updates for your Web sites, and more.  A PHP script to be used by PHP CLI is dif- ferent from a Web script in three ways: 1. It won’t use or create any HTML. 2. It doesn’t need to use the .php extension   although it’s fine if it does .  3. The very first line of the script will be:  ! usr bin php  You can use HTML, if you like, but it’ll just clutter up the result in the console window. As for the file’s extension, how the script is run will change  covered in the next section of the chapter , so you could literally use anything. But .php is still a fine idea. Or you could use a different extension to differentiate your Web PHP scripts from the command- line ones  or no extension at all! . But of the three rules, only the last one matters  and, frankly, it only matters on Unix and Mac OS X .     t p i r c S e n i L - d n a m m o C a g n i t a e r C        424  The CLI php.ini  Most PHP installations will end up with two or more usable command-line ver- sions of PHP. The one I’m focusing on in this chapter is CLI. But there are probably other PHPs lingering on your server, like the one used by Apache or IIS for han- dling Web pages.  One interesting point about PHP CLI is that it uses a different php.ini file than the Web PHP module. This file, of course, is where you dictate how PHP behaves. So it’s important to remember that PHP CLI may run differently than you’re used to.  For that matter, your PHP CLI instal- lation may support different modules than your Web installation.   In this same vein, you can, when invoking PHP CLI, use options to change the php.ini behavior:  ◆ -c tells PHP CLI where to look for a  php.ini file.  ◆ -n tells PHP CLI not to use a php.ini.  ◆ -d sets a php.ini value for PHP CLI.   Figure 11.13 Text outside of the PHP tags is revealed in the console.  PHP’s Command-Line Interface  That line of code is called the shebang line. It tells the operating system where to find the executable that should be used to run this script. For Unix and Mac OS X, that executable should have been installed in  usr bin. If you know that PHP CLI was installed elsewhere, change the shebang  line accordingly. For Windows, this line is ignored, but you should keep it in there for cross-platform reliability.  After that line, all PHP code goes within the normal PHP tags. Anything outside of the PHP tags is sent to the standard output just like Web-based PHP scripts  Figure 11.13 : ! usr bin php <?php    Do whatever. ?> This text is also displayed. <?php    Do whatever. ?>  As the first implementation of this concept, I’ll create a script that reads in a text file and reprints it, numbering the lines along the way.        C r e a t i n g a C o m m a n d - L i n e S c r i p t     425   Chapter 11  To create a command-line script: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi-  Script 11.1 This PHP script will be run from the command line. It reads in a text file and prints it out, line by line, with the lines numbered.     t p i r c S e n i L - d n a m m o C a g n i t a e r C        tor or IDE, beginning with the shebang line  Script 11.1 . ! usr bin php <?php  Script 11.1 - number.php Remember that the first line is the most important and that you might need to change it if PHP CLI was installed in a place other than  usr bin. And although Windows users can skip this line, it’s best to leave it in there. Finally, you still need to use the PHP tags.  2. Identify what file will be numbered.  $file = ‘number.php’; Later in the chapter you’ll see how to write this script so that this information can be assigned when the script is run. As for number.php, I’m actually having this script number itself. You can use any plain text file, like another PHP script from the book.  3. Print an introductory message.  echo “\nNumbering the file named ➝ ‘$file’... -------------------\n\n”;  4. Read in the file.  $data = file $file ; The file   function reads an entire file into an array. Each line becomes one array element. You could use fopen   and the other file functions instead, if  you prefer.  1 2 3 4 5  6  7 8 9 10 11 12 13  14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35  ! usr bin php <?php  Script 11.1 - number.php  This page reads in a file.

Print each line with its number.  $n = 1; foreach  $data as $line  {  echo “$n  $line”; $n++;  } To start, a counter is initialized so that the first line is numbered at 1. Then a foreach loop goes through the array. Within the loop, each line is printed, pre- fixed by the line number and a couple of spaces. You do not need to print a new- line here, as the line read in from the original file retained that newline. Finally, the counter is incremented.  6. Print a closing message.  echo “\n------------------- End of file ‘$file’.\n”; 7. Complete the PHP script.  ?>  8. Save the file as number.php. ✔ Tips    PHP CLI can be used in combination with PHP-GTK to create stand-alone applica- tions. Check out Chapter 10, “PHP and the Server,” or  http:  gtk.php.net for more information.    The original CGI version of the command-  line PHP would send out HTTP headers as part of its duties  as it was meant to work with Web servers . To avoid that step, it could be invoked using -q, which stands for quiet mode. This is no longer required with PHP CLI, but you’ll some- times see that flag used anyway, like so: ! usr bin php -q  427        C r e a t i n g a C o m m a n d - L i n e S c r i p t      Chapter 11  Running a  Command-Line Script Now that you’ve written a script especially meant for a command-line execution  and wasn’t it nice not to mess with all that pesky HTML? , it’s time to learn how to run it. There are two methods:  The first is to directly invoke PHP CLI, as you did when executing a bit of code, this time providing it with the name of a script  to execute: php scriptname.php  You’ll also see the -f flag used. It stands for file, and whether you use it or not makes no difference on the end result: php -f scriptname.php  This method should work just fine, as long as php is in your PATH and you are in the same directory as scriptname.php. Variations to circumvent these limitations might be:  usr bin php scriptname.php php  path to scriptname.php C:\php\php.exe scriptname.php  The second method for executing PHP scripts is to treat the script as if it were an application in its own right: scriptname.php  Windows  . scriptname.php  Unix and Mac OS X   This method, which is preferred, can have some tricks to it, so I’ll run through the details in the following steps.     t p i r c S e n i L - d n a m m o C a g n i n n u R        428   PHP’s Command-Line Interface  To run a command-line script  in Windows: 1.

Run the file using the php scriptname.php  syntax  Figure 11.19 . php number.php Hopefully this should work for you.  If you get an error message, it’s most likely because php is not in your PATH. If you don’t know how to change  your PATH, either search the Web for tutorials or turn to my support forums  www.dmcinsights.com phorum  .  4. Make the file executable.  chmod +x number.php If you’re not familiar with chmod, it’s a utility for changing the properties of files and directories. The +x code says to add executable status to number.php.  5. Run the file using the . scriptname.php  syntax  Figure 11.20 . . number.php    You can use php -l scriptname.php to have PHP check a script’s syntax, with- out actually running it. The only caveats are that this doesn’t work with the -r option  for testing bits of code  and it doesn’t check for fatal errors.  431        R u n n i n g a C o m m a n d - L i n e S c r i p t     Figure 11.19 The first method for running the PHP script.  Figure 11.20 Executables can be run using the . thing syntax, assuming you are in the same directory as the thing to be run.  ✔ Tip   Figure 11.21 The args.php script just prints out the number and values of the arguments used when calling it. Notice that the script name itself is always the first received argument.     s t n e m u g r A e n i L - d n a m m o C h t i w g n i k r o W        Chapter 11  Working with Command- Line Arguments The number.php example  Script 11.1  is a reasonable-enough application of PHP CLI. The script provides a viable service but has one limitation: the file to be numbered is hard-coded into the script. It’d be better to set that value when the application is used. This can be easily achieved by rewriting the script so that it uses command-line arguments.  Command-line arguments are values passed to an application when it is run. For example, the PHP CLI takes several configuration options, the name of a script to be run, or some code to be executed. Arguments are passed to the invoked application by adding them after the application’s name: scriptname.php arg1 arg2…  In your PHP script, you can then access these arguments by referring to $argv and $argc  or the more formal $_SERVER[‘argv’] and $_SERVER[‘argc’]. The $argv array stores every argument provided; $argc stores the number of arguments provided. The only catch to using these is that the name of the script itself is the first listed argument  $_SERVER[‘argv’][0] . To get a better understanding of this, Figure 11.21 shows the execution of this code: ! usr bin php  echo “\n{$_SERVER[‘argc’]} arguments ➝ received. They are...\n”;  foreach  $_SERVER[‘argv’] as $k => $v  {  echo “$k: $v\n”;  <?php  }  ?>  Let’s write a new number.php script so that it accepts an argument: the name of the script to number. 432   PHP’s Command-Line Interface  To use command-line arguments: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE, beginning with the shebang line  Script 11.2 . ! usr bin php <?php  Script 11.2 - number2.php  continues on page 435  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35  Script 11.2 This PHP script expects to receive the name of the file to number as a command-line argument.  ! usr bin php <?php  Script 11.2 - number2.php  This page reads in a file.

Make sure that the file exists. $file = $_SERVER[‘argc’][1]; if  file_exists $file  && ➝ is_file $file   { First, the name of the file is identified as the second argument provided  the argu- ments list being an array, the indexing begins at 0 . Then two conditionals con- firm that the given file does exist and is a file  because a directory would pass the first test . You’d likely want to add code restricting the files to a certain directory, for security purposes.  4. Read in the file and print each line.  if  $data = file $file   {  echo “\nNumbering the file named  ➝ ‘$file’...\n------------------- ➝ \n\n”;  $n = 1; foreach  $data as $line  { echo “$n  $line”; $n++;  } echo “\n-------------------\nEnd  ➝ of file ‘$file’.\n”; This code matches that in number.php, except for reading the file’s contents as a conditional.  435   Figure 11.22 If no filename is provided, the utility’s proper usage is shown.

This is a command-line convention, also discussed in the sidebar. 8. Complete the PHP script.  ?>  9. Save the file as number2.php. 10. Run the script  Figures 11.23 and 11.24 .  Note that on Windows, you’ll need to use this syntax: php number2.php filename If you use number2.php filename the script will only recognize one argu- ment  with a value of number2.php .  ✔ Tip    To get really professional with your   command-line arguments, check  out the PEAR Console_Getargs and Console_Getopt packages. They both help establish and manage the list of long and short options that your pro- gram will accept.     s t n e m u g r A e n i L - d n a m m o C h t i w g n i k r o W        436   Figure 11.25 Any function that attempts to read from the standard input will create a prompt where the user can type.  Creating an Interface  Using PHP in a command-line situation opens up a whole new world that PHP for Web development doesn’t have: the user interface. Sure, presentation and usage of Web pages is a vitally important HTML issue, but on the command line it’s a dif- ferent beast.  For starters, most command-line appli- cations indicate how the command is to be used, should it be used incorrectly. Type php -varmit and you’ll see what I mean. The number2.php script does this  a little bit  showing the usage  but com- mands normally do more, like offer help  if commandname -h or commandname --help is entered.  Finally, command-line applications often return a code indicating how successful the operation was. The number 0 is returned to indicate no problems, and some nonzero number otherwise. In number2.php, the integer 1 is returned when things go wrong  you could also write it as exit 1  in your PHP code .  PHP’s Command-Line Interface  Taking Input An alternative to using command-line  arguments is to request input from the user  although you could use both techniques in combination . By doing so, you can create an interactive application, where it prompts the user for information and does something with what is entered.  Strange as it may seem, taking input in a command-line application is exactly like reading in data from a file. But in this case, instead of using a file handle  a pointer to an opened file , you’ll use a special constant, STDIN. This stands for standard input, which would be the keyboard by default. One easy way to read in standard input would be to use the fgets   function: $data = fgets STDIN ;  This line of code creates a prompt   Figure 11.25 . Anything typed there  is assigned to $data.  To be more precise with input, I like to use the fscanf   function. Like printf   and sprintf  , discussed in Chapter 1, “Advanced PHP Techniques,” this function takes for- matting parameters to handle specific types of data. By using this function, instead of a more generic one, some basic validation as  to the type of data read in can take place. In this next example, fscanf   will be used to create an application that converts tempera- tures between degrees Fahrenheit and Celsius  in either direction .  T a k i n g   I n p u t  437   Figure 11.26 The initial prompt.  t u p n I   g n i k a T  Chapter 11  To take user input: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE, beginning with the shebang line  Script 11.3 . ! usr bin php <?php  Script 11.3 - temperature.php  2. Prompt the user for the input.  echo “\nEnter a temperature and ➝ indicate if it’s Fahrenheit or ➝ Celsius [. C F]: “; The prompt  Figure 11.26  clearly indi- cates to the user what information is expected and in what format. Because there is no newline character printed at the end of this text, the user will be able to type immediately after the colon.  3. Read in a floating-point number and a  string. if  fscanf  STDIN, “%f %s”, $temp_i, ➝ $which_i  == 2  { There’s a lot going on in this one line. First, the fscanf   function will attempt to read in, from the standard input, one floating-point number and one string. These should match up to the tempera- ture  e.g., 98.6  and the indicator as to  the current temperature type  C or F . There is no “character” format with fscanf  , so the %s for string will have  to do. If fscanf   can read in exactly these two data types in that order,  they’ll be assigned to the variables $temp_i and $which_i. The last bit of trickery is that the fscanf   function can return the number of values it assigned to variables. So if it reads in two values, assigned to $temp_i and $which_i, the conditional knows that the proper data was entered.  continues on page 440  438   Script 11.3 User input is requested when this script runs. The input is read in from STDIN and validated; if proper, a temperature conversion occurs.

Print the results: if  $which_o  {  } else {  }  } else {    Didn’t enter the right input.  echo “You failed to use the proper syntax.\n”;  }    End of main IF. ?>  printf  “%0.1f %s is %0.1f %s.\n”, $temp_i, $which_i, $temp_o, $which_o ;  echo “You failed to enter C or F to indicate the current temperature.\n”;  T a k i n g   I n p u t  439   Chapter 11  4.

The switch checks to see if degrees Celsius is being converted to Fahrenheit or vice versa. If the second piece of input submitted is not C, c, F, or f, no conver- sion takes place.  t u p n I   g n i k a T  440  Taking CLI Further  This chapter covers what you need to know about running PHP code from a command-line interface. For the most part this just means that you’ll take what you already know how to do with PHP and execute it in a non-Web interface. That alone is perfect for many automated tasks that you might want to do.  On a more sophisticated level, PHP CLI can be used to really interact with the operating system on a low level. One thing to look into is the pcntl  process control  extension. The extension, which isn’t available when using PHP for Web pages, lets you fork your processes  split them off . From there you can go on to the con- cept of signals. If you don’t know what these things are, that’s fine: you probably shouldn’t be messing with them in PHP anyway. But if you do understand these concepts, knowing that you can work with them in PHP is a welcome bit of news.  Finally, with PHP CLI you can use the backticks, exec  , system  , and similar functions to call system utilities. Using these functions with PHP CLI doesn’t really differ from using them in a Web script, but your need to use them might increase.   Figure 11.27 The result of the calculation is printed as a floating-point number with one decimal.  Figure 11.28 One of the possible error messages if the script is not used properly.  PHP’s Command-Line Interface  5. Print the results. if  $which_o  {  printf  “%0.1f %s is %0.1f  ➝ %s.\n”, $temp_i, $which_i,  ➝ $temp_o, $which_o ;  } else {  echo “You failed to enter C or F  ➝ to indicate the current  ➝ temperature.\n”;  } If $which_o is equal to C or F, then the conditional is true and the conversion is printed, using the printf   function to handle the formatting  Figure 11.27 . Otherwise, a default message is printed  Figure 11.28 .  continues on next page  T a k i n g   I n p u t  441   Figure 11.29 The second of the possible error messages for misuse.

Complete the conditional started in Step 3.  echo “You failed to use the  ➝ proper syntax.\n”;  } This else clause applies if the fscanf   function does not return the number 2, meaning it didn’t read in two values  Figure 11.29 . In neither this case nor the else clause in Step 5 did I return a number indicating a problem, but that could be added.  7. Complete the PHP script.  ?>  8. Save the file as temperature.php. 9. Run the script  Figure 11.30 . ✔ Tips    This script could have been simplified by taking the temperature and the tempera- ture type as two separate inputs. But doing so would have been far less cool than using just one prompt and showing off what fscanf   can do.    Any of PHP’s file functions can be used on STDIN. This means, for example, that you could use fgetc   to retrieve just a single character or fgetcsv   to retrieve and parse an entire line.  t u p n I   g n i k a T  442   12  Using PEAR  One part of my definition of “advanced” PHP is simply: Do the things you already do but better and faster. Toward this end, PEAR is a miraculous tool. PEAR, the PHP Extension and Application Repository  http:  pear.php.net , is a shared library of PHP code that you can use to develop your own applications. The library is made up of packages, each package providing functionality within a specific area.  In some other chapters, I have either mentioned related PEAR packages or outright used them  because why reinvent the wheel, right? . In this chapter I am going to demonstrate three more PEAR packages, which did not fit in elsewhere. These pack- ages address common problems PHP programmers encounter, and frequently asked questions on my support forums.  U s i n g P E A R     A couple last words on PEAR: as much as it’s great, it has some limitations. How cur- rent and how well documented a package is varies greatly  both being good indica- tors as to the package’s usability . And installation can be troublesome. But you can also learn a lot from PEAR: it’s an excellent model of object-oriented design  see Chapter 6, “Basic Object-Oriented Programming,” and Chapter 7, “Advanced OOP” . By looking at PEAR source code, you can learn much about defining classes, docu- menting your work, extending classes, or even how to use an otherwise undocument- ed package. I will be using OOP terminology in this chapter, so an understanding of those fundamentals  again, see Chapter 6  will help comprehension of this material.  443   Chapter 12  Using Benchmark The first of the PEAR packages to discuss in this chapter is Benchmark. As the name implies, this is a simple class for benchmark- ing code. Benchmarking, in case you’re not familiar, is the process of timing how long code blocks, entire scripts, or whole applica- tions take to run. Doing so can be a useful tool for finding bottlenecks in your sites and improving performance.  In this next section I’ll run through two uses of the Benchmark package. The first will time three different ways of printing text in PHP, because which method is fastest is a common question. The second will show how fast PHP executes a particular user- defined function.  I’ll say up front that the Benchmark class is nice and simple, but the documentation for it is lacking. There is simply no end-user documentation available. But through these next two pages, and by looking at the class definitions in the downloadable files, you’ll be able to start benchmarking your scripts.  k r a m h c n e B g n i s U     444  Understanding Benchmarks  In the first two examples of this chapter, I benchmark some PHP code. While the results of the benchmarks are clear and easy to understand, they are not univer- sal. For the first example, several execu- tions of this script show that using single quotes is faster, for that exact example on my computer. This is not to say that single quotes are always faster.  Benchmarking is a good way to give you an understanding of execution tendencies: is it generally better to do this or that? When it comes time to really fine-tune your applications, you should benchmark your exact code  i.e., what you’ve written versus alternative methods  on the server it will run on. Only then will you know for certain that you’ve got the best perform- ance possible.  It should also be remembered that the benchmarking itself affects a script’s per- formance. Because of the extra memory required by the Benchmark object, and the extra processing required by calling its methods, any benchmarked script will perform worse than its unbenchmarked version  not that there’s a way to test for that, of course .   Using PEAR  Benchmarking some code To simply benchmark some sections of code in a PHP script, use the Benchmark Timer class. Start by including the file and creating the object: require  ‘Benchmark Timer.php’ ; $timer = new Benchmark_Timer  ;  Once you have a timer object, you can start the timer at any point: $timer->start  ;  Stopping the timer is a matter of: $timer->stop  ;  Commonly, you’ll want to see how long spe- cific parts of your code take to run. You can set place markers using: $timer->setMarker ‘Marker Name’ ;  When you’re done doing whatever, you can easily report on the results by invoking the display   method  Figure 12.1 : $timer->display  ;  Or you can manually access the intervals between points using: $timer->timeElapsed ‘Marker1’, ➝ ‘Marker2’   A final option is to get an array of results via: $profile = $timer->getProfiling  ;  This array  see Figure 12.2  can then be used however you see fit.  As a practical example, I’m going to run a test to see what the execution difference is between using echo with single quotes, dou- ble quotes, or the heredoc syntax  if you’re not familiar with the heredoc syntax, see Chapter 1, “Advanced PHP Techniques” . Because PHP has to look for variables to be extrapolated within double quotes and here- doc, the performance difference is often questioned.  445     U s i n g B e n c h m a r k  Figure 12.1 The benchmark results for timing the execution of a script  this being a QuickForm example developed later in the chapter  are revealed using the display   method.  Figure 12.2 Part of the structure of the array returned by the getProfiling   method.   k r a m h c n e B g n i s U     Chapter 12  To benchmark your code: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi- tor or IDE, beginning with the standard HTML  Script 12.1 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset= ➝ iso-8859-1”  >   Benchmarking Code       <?php  Script 12.1 - timer.php  2. Define at least one variable.  $data = ‘This is some text.’; To really test the performance differ- ence, I want to print some HTML and  a variable.  3. Include the Timer class definition.  require  ‘Benchmark Timer.php’ ; Assuming that you’ve installed the Benchmark package and that the PEAR directory is in your include path, this one line is all you need to use the class.  continues on page 448  Installing PEAR Packages  One PEAR-related thing I do not discuss in this book is the installation process, for two good reasons. First, with the variations of available operating systems, it’s too tough to nail down comprehensive instructions for all potential readers. Second, experience tells me that many users are on hosted servers, where they cannot directly install anything.  Still, installing PEAR is not impossibly hard, and once you master the installation of a single package, installing more is a snap. If you want to try your hand at installing PEAR packages, start by checking out the PEAR manual, which has instructions  you have to set up the installer first . If you’re still not clear as to what you should do, search the Web for articles on the sub- ject and or post a question in the book’s supporting forum, where I’ll be happy to assist.  Some installation tips up front:  ◆ You may need to invoke the pear installer as a superuser  or using sudo .  ◆ Make sure that the location of your PEAR directory is in your PHP include path.  ◆ If using PHP 5, you may want to set error reporting below E_STRICT, as not all PEAR pack-  ages have been upgraded to the new object model.  ◆ Run the command pear help install to see what options are available.  If you are on a hosted server, the hosting company should be willing to install PEAR packages for you  which benefit every user on the server . If they won’t do that, you ought to consider a different hosting company  seriously . Barring that, for some PEAR classes, you can just download a package from the PEAR site, copy its files onto your server, and include them as if they were any other class definition files.  446   Script 12.1 How long it takes PHP to execute three different echo   statements is benchmarked in this script.

Then I print out, using echo  , some HTML. Within the HTML, a vari- able will be concatenated several times over.  6. Time a double-quote example. $timer->setMarker ‘echo2’ ; echo “ echo   with double ➝ quotes  <table border=\”0\” width=\”90%\” ➝ cellspacing=\”3\” cellpadding=\”3\” ➝ align=\”center\”>     448    $data   $data   $data    $data   $data   $data              End of echo   with double ➝ quotes.  “; This is a variation on the code in Step 5, except that double quotes are used. This means that all double quotes in the HTML must be escaped but that the variables can be kept within the string  and not concatenated . 7. Time a heredoc example.  $timer->setMarker ‘heredoc’ ; echo <<<EOT  heredoc Syntax  <table border=”0” width=”90%” ➝ cellspacing=”3” cellpadding=”3” ➝ align=”center”>              $data   $data   $data    $data   $data   $data   Using PEAR     End of heredoc syntax.  EOT; This is the heredoc syntax, discussed in Chapter 1. Variables can be kept in the string, but double quotation marks do not need to be escaped.  8. Set a final marker and stop the timer.  $timer->setMarker ‘end’ ; $timer->stop  ; So that the timing of each code block is consistent, I set a marker and then stop the timer. This way each chunk begins and ends with a setMarker   call.  9. Print the results.  echo ‘  Results: ’; echo ‘ Time required for the  ➝ single quote echo  : ‘ . $timer- ➝ >timeElapsed ‘echo1’, ‘echo2’  . ➝ ‘ ’; echo ‘ Time required for the  ➝ double quote echo  : ‘ . $timer- ➝ >timeElapsed ‘echo2’, ‘heredoc’  . ➝ ‘ ’; echo ‘ Time required for the ➝ heredoc echo  : ‘ . $timer- ➝ >timeElapsed ‘heredoc’, ‘end’  . ➝ ‘ ’; To find out how long each section of code took to execute, invoke the timeElapsed   method, providing two markers as the start and stop points.  10.

Save the file as timer.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 12.3 .  12. Run the page several times to confirm  the results  Figures 12.4 and 12.5 .  ✔ Tips    As I mention in the introduction to this  section of the chapter, the Benchmark package does not come with much in the way of documentation. But if you download the package files and view the class definitions, you’ll find some sample code and, what is more important, be able to see what each method does. Doing so only requires an understanding of basic object-oriented programming  see Chapter 6 .    If you do this when creating a new timer: $timer = new Benchmark_Timer true ; then the timer will automatically be started at that point. The timer will also automatically stop at the end of the script  or when the variable is deleted  with the results shown as in Figure 12.1.  k r a m h c n e B g n i s U     450  Figure 12.3 The first part of the page is the tested code: three different ways to achieve the same result. The bottom of the page shows how long, in seconds, each code block took to execute.  Figure 12.4 Rerun the same page  compare with Figures 12.3 and 12.5  multiple times to confirm and compare the benchmarking numbers.   Using PEAR  Benchmarking functions The previous example uses the Timer class to perform a simple timing operation on some code. The drawback of those tests  is that they represent a single execution. Part of the Benchmark package is the Benchmark_Iterate class, which can test the performance of functions by invoking them for a repeated number of times. To use it, create an object of type Benchmark_Iterate: require  ‘Benchmark Iterate.php’ ; $b = new Benchmark_Iterate  ;  Then, just tell the object what function to run and how many times: $b->run $iterations, ‘function_name’ ;  Finally, invoke the get   method to retrieve all the results. $r = $b->get  ;  The returned data is an associative array, listing the time taken by each iteration of the function, plus the mean and a confirma- tion of the number of iterations  Figure 12.6 .

True. But to demonstrate the performance hit between straight-up executing a bit of code  Script 12.1 and Figures 12.3 through 12.5  and having a function do the same thing, I want to repeat the single-quotes echo   state- ment. I have made one alteration: the data is being written within HTML com- ments so that it doesn’t all appear in the Web browser  Figure 12.7 .  3. Include the Iterate class definition.  require  ‘Benchmark Iterate.php’ ;  4. Create and start an iteration of the  dummy   function. $b = new Benchmark_Iterate  ; $b->run 100, ‘dummy’ ; I’ll invoke this function 100 times and average the results of using it.  5.

You can provide arguments to the func-  tion being called by adding them as  arguments to the run   method. $b->run $iterations, ‘function_name’, ➝ 21, ‘value’ ;    You can even use the Benchmark_Iterate class to test methods defined in classes.    Not to put too much stock in these  examples, but the results suggest that executing the same bit of code in your own function  iterate.php, Script 12.2  is slightly slower than executing it out- side of a function  timer.php, Script 12.1 . This does make sense.     U s i n g B e n c h m a r k  455   Chapter 12  Using HTML_QuickForm Of the several hundred PEAR packages avail- able, HTML_QuickForm may well be my favorite. And with great reason: it helps you create and process HTML forms. Even after all these years working with PHP, displaying and then handling an HTML form is the overwhelming majority of what I do with  the language.  I could write a whole book  maybe a small book  on the subject, and it breaks my heart to know that there isn’t room here to discuss everything I love about this package. But I can provide you with enough real-world code to whet your appetite and start you down the path of HTML_QuickForm adulation.  One of the reasons that QuickForm is so usable and successful is that it places all of the form-related events—creating the form, filtering the form data, validating the form, and processing the form data—into one object and one PHP page. This ensures con- sistency and a minimum of code, two hall- marks of the advanced PHP programmer. ✔ Tip    At the time of this writing, HTML_  QuickForm2 is just in the works, without any releases. This is going to be a PHP 5 rewrite of the HTML_QuickForm pack- age. I expect it will function exactly the same as the original, albeit using the PHP 5 object model behind the scenes.  m r o F k c i u Q _ L M T H g n i s U     Table 12.1 The HTML_QuickForm class starts by accepting all of the standard HTML form element types. Standard HTML Element Types  N a m e button checkbox file hidden image password radio reset select submit text textarea  C r e at e s   a   n   … button single check box file upload prompt hidden input image input password input radio button reset button select menu submit button text input textarea field  Table 12.2 The HTML_QuickForm class improves upon the standard HTML form element types by creating some of its own.

Begin by creating the object: require_once  ‘HTML QuickForm.php’ ; $form = new HTML_QuickForm  ;  When creating this object, you can pass parameters to the constructor, giving the form a name, choosing a method other  than POST  the default , setting a target,  and so on.  From there you want to add elements to the form. There are many element types, from the standard HTML ones with which you are accustomed  Table 12.1  to useful ones defined by QuickForm  Table 12.2 . The syntax for adding a form element is: $form->addElement ‘type’, ‘name’, ➝ ‘prompt’, $options ;  Figure 12.10 The form contains five elements: one text input, one hidden input, two radio buttons, and a submit button.  Figure 12.11 The HTML source of the page  see Figure 12.10  reveals the code generated by the QuickForm class, including an HTML table.  457   Chapter 12  To make a registration form: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi- tor or IDE, beginning with the standard HTML  Script 12.3 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset= ➝ iso-8859-1”  >   QuickForm       <?php  Script 12.3 - quickform.php  2. Create the QuickForm object.  require_once  ‘HTML QuickForm.php’ ; $form = new HTML_QuickForm  ;  3. Add a header.  $form->addElement ‘header’, NULL, ➝ ‘Registration Form’ ; The header element type is a QuickForm invention. It adds a label to the top of the form.  m r o F k c i u Q _ L M T H g n i s U     4. Add the elements for the person’s name.  $form->addElement ‘select’, ➝ ‘salutation’, ‘Salutation: ‘, ➝ array   ‘Mr.’ => ‘Mr.’, ‘Miss’ => ‘Miss’, ‘Mrs.’ => ‘Mrs.’, ‘Dr.’ => ‘Dr.’    ; $form->addElement ‘text’, ➝ ‘first_name’, ‘First Name: ‘ ; $form->addElement ‘text’, ➝ ‘last_name’, ‘Last Name: ‘ ; The person’s name will require three inputs. The first is a select menu called salutation. The prompt for this item is Salutation: and its possible values are Mr., Miss, Mrs., and Dr. The next two  elements are simple text boxes.  5. Add an element for an email address. $form->addElement ‘text’, ‘email’, ➝ ‘Email Address: ‘, array ‘size’ => ➝ 30, ‘maxlength’ => 100  ; This is another text box, like those for the person’s name, but the box’s dimen- sions are set as well.  continues on page 460  458   Using PEAR  Script 12.3 The HTML_QuickForm class is used to make a registration form.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd”>          QuickForm   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51      <?php  Script 12.3 - quickform.php  This page creates a registration form.

Delete the object and complete the page.  $form->addElement ‘password’, ➝ ‘pass1’, ‘Password: ‘ ; $form->addElement ‘password’, ➝ ‘pass2’, ‘Confirm Password: ‘ ; The inputs are both of type password. I think it’s best to take passwords twice, since what is typed is not visible to the end user  Figure 12.12 .  7. Add a submit button.  $form->addElement ‘submit’, ➝ ‘submit’, ‘Register!’ ;  8.

Figure 12.13 The simple HTML form.  Figure 12.14 The HTML generated by QuickForm. 460   Using PEAR  Filtering and validating  form data In the quickform.php example  Script 12.3 , I show how to start using QuickForm to cre- ate an HTML form. Those steps generate the HTML required to make the elements. But that’s just a drop in the bucket as for what QuickForm can do.  Commonly you’ll want to apply some sort of filter to your form data. The applyFilter   method does this, taking the name of the element to which this should be applied and the function to apply as its arguments: $form->applyFilter ‘element_name’, ➝ ‘function_name’ ;  To have an element’s submitted data trimmed, use: $form->applyFilter ‘email’, ‘trim’ ;  Or you might want to apply nl2br   to a text area field: $form->applyFilter ‘comments’, ‘nl2br’ ;  To apply a filter to every element, use the special identifier __ALL__: $form->applyFilter ‘__ALL__’, ➝ ‘function_name’ ;  Along with filters, you can add rules to form elements. Rules can apply validation tech- niques to the form data. The addRule   method is used here: $form->addRule ‘element_name’, ‘error ➝ message’, ‘rule_type’ ;  continues on next page     U s i n g H T M L _ Q u i c k F o r m  461  Setting Default Form Values  If you need to establish default values for your form inputs, rest assured that doing so is possible and stunningly simple. Begin by defining an array whose keys are the element names and whose values are the default values: $defaults = array  ‘username’ => ➝ ‘jellyhead’, ‘age’ => 8, ‘email’ => ‘jellyhead@thejelly.org’  ;  Then invoke the setDefaults   method: $form->setDefaults $defaults ;  All there is to it!  Often the default form values will be based upon data stored in a database. In such a case, if your database columns have the same names as your form ele- ments  which is a good idea anyway , using this data as the default values is a snap: $q = ‘SELECT username, age, email ➝ FROM users WHERE user_id=3453’; $r = mysql_query $q ;    Check that a row was returned. $defaults = mysql_fetch_array $r, ➝ MYSQL_ASSOC ; $form->setDefaults $defaults ;   Table 12.3 These rule types are used in the addRule   method to add validation routines to a form.  QuickForm Validation Rules  N a m e required maxlength minlength rangelength regex email emailorblank lettersonly alphanumeric numeric nopunctuation nonzero compare uploadedfile maxfilesize  mimetype  filename  M e a n i n g Some value required Cannot have more characters than Must be at least this many characters Within a range Matches a regular expression pattern Is a valid email address Is a valid email address or is empty Only uses letters Only uses letters and numbers Only uses numbers Anything but punctuation A number not starting with zero Compare two or more elements Element must contain an uploaded file Uploaded file cannot be bigger than this value Uploaded file must be of this type   or types  Uploaded file must have a certain  filename  m r o F k c i u Q _ L M T H g n i s U     Chapter 12  Table 12.3 lists the available rule types. To make a field required, use: $form->addRule ‘city’, ‘Enter your ➝ city.’, ‘required’ ;  If a rule, like maxlength, takes another argu- ment, that would come after the rule type: $form->addRule ‘age’, ‘Please enter your ➝ age.’, ‘rangelength’, array 1, 120  ;  Better yet, you can have QuickForm perform not only server-side validation  using PHP  but also client-side  by generating the neces- sary JavaScript . Just add the word client as the fifth argument: $form->addRule ‘city’, ‘Enter your ➝ city.’, ‘required’, NULL, ‘client’ ; $form->addRule ‘age’, ‘Please enter your ➝ age.’, ‘rangelength’, array 1, 120  , ➝ ‘client’ ;  To filter and validate form data: 1. Open quickform.php  Script 12.3  in your  text editor or IDE, if it is not already.  2. After adding all the elements but before displaying the form, apply a trim   filter  Script 12.4 . $form->applyFilter ‘__ALL__’, ➝ ‘trim’ ; This one line will run all of the submitted data through PHP’s trim   function. Although it may be overkill to do so to the select menu  the salutation  and the submit button, the convenience of trim- ming all form data through this one line of code more than makes up for the potential performance hit.  continues on page 464  462   Script 12.4 The form  started in Script 12.3  is improved upon by applying one filter and four validation rules.

The second is the error message that should appear if the rule isn’t obeyed. The message could show in a JavaScript alert window  Figure 12.15  or in the HTML page  Figure 12.16 .  4. Add a rule for the email address.  $form->addRule ‘email’, ‘Please enter ➝ your email address.’, ‘email’, ➝ NULL, ‘client’ ; This rule is of type email, meaning that the entered value must be a valid email address.  m r o F k c i u Q _ L M T H g n i s U     Script 12.4 continued  52 53  54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62  464     Display the form: $form->display  ;     Delete the object: unset $form ; ?>      Figure 12.15 The client-side validation will use alert windows to warn of rule violations.

The first makes sure that something is entered for the first pass- word field. The second checks if the two password fields have the same value. This is accomplished using the compare rule, whose default comparison is equality. This particular rule takes as its first argument an array of the elements to be compared.  6. Save the file, place it in your Web direc-  tory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 12.17 .  7. Check the HTML source of the page to see the generated JavaScript  Figure 12.18 .  ✔ Tips    You can create your own validation rules  and then declare them for use using registerRule  . This could be used, for example, to make sure that a username or email address has not already been registered. The function involved would check your database for that name or address’s presence.    Constants in the form of __NAME__  like  __ALL__ in the QuickForm class  are called “magic” constants.      U s i n g H T M L _ Q u i c k F o r m  465   Chapter 12  Processing form data The final step in the whole form dance  is to do something with the form data. QuickForm provides a method that returns  a Boolean value indicating if the form passes the server-side validation  if the form fails client-side validation, it’ll never get to the server side . This method can be used in a conditional: if  $form->validate    {     Good to go!  }  The form data will pass the validate   test if every form element passes all of the appli- cable rules you’ve established.  To then access the form values, refer to $form->exportValue ‘element_name’ . This  method returns the “safe” version of the sub- mitted data: the results after running the data through the filters. You can also fetch all the safe form data as an associative array using: $form->exportValues  ;  To wrap up the QuickForm example, the submitted form data will be displayed if it passes validation. To process a QuickForm: 1. Open quickform.php  Script 12.4  in your  text editor or IDE, if it is not already. 2. Remove the current invocation of the  display   method  Script 12.5 . I will change when this method is called.  continues on page 468  Script 12.5 The final step in the form process is to do something with the submitted data.

Use $data[‘element_name’].  } $form->process ‘process_data’ ;  Escaping Data for Databases  For any incoming data that will be used in a query, I like to make sure it’s safe by using a database-specific escaping function, like mysql_real_escape_string   for MySQL. I wrap this function call inside of my own function, which will also strip any existing slashes if Magic Quotes is on. My resulting function looks like: function escape_data  $data  {  global $dbc; if  get_magic_quotes_gpc    $data = stripslashes $data ; return mysql_real_escape_string  trim  $data , $dbc ;  Having defined this function, I can apply it to all form data using applyFilter  : $form->applyFilter ‘__ALL__’, ‘escape_data’ ;  Now all of the form data will be safe to use in a query. Because this function also trims the data, I don’t need to apply that as a filter.  }  468   Figure 12.19 The complete HTML form.

Using PEAR  Using Mail_Mime Next up on my march through PEAR is the Mail_Mime package  and, ever so slightly, Mail . PHP’s built-in mail   function is sim- ple to use, but it does have its shortcomings. For starters, you cannot use it with an SMTP server that requires authentication. Second, it’s not very easy to use it for sending HMTL email or email with attachments. A solution is to use PEAR’s Mail and Mail_Mime classes. The documentation for both is slight, but I can provide you with more than enough functional knowledge.  As a preview to what you’ll see in the next two examples, the Mail_Mime class is used to create the proper email code  there are pages and pages of documentation as to how emails are formatted . In layman’s terms, Mail_Mime turns the information you need to send—be it HTML or attachments—into the proper syntax for an email message. The Mail class is then used to send that message. Sending HTML email To start, you’ll need to include two class def- initions  after having installed both PEAR packages, of course : require_once  ‘Mail.php’ ; require_once  ‘Mail mime.php’ ;  You’ll also want to establish your message body. For HTML emails, you should create  a plain text and an HTML equivalent. For the HTML content, it should be a complete HTML document: $text = ‘Plain text version’; $html = ‘<!DOCTYPE html…    ’;  Now create a new Mail_Mime object: $mime = new Mail_Mime  ;  continues on next page  469     U s i n g M a i l _ M m e  i   Chapter 12  Using the object’s methods, set the email’s body for both the plain text and the HTML versions: $mime->setTXTBody $text ; $mime->setHTMLBody $html ;  Before sending the email, the extra headers have to be generated: who the email is from and what the subject is. There are separate methods for each: $mime->setFrom ‘this@address.com’ ; $mime->setSubject ‘Your Email Subject’ ;  You can also use addCc   and addBcc   to carbon copy and blind carbon copy other addresses.  Now that all this information has been stored in the object, use the get   and head- ers   methods to fetch the generated code for use with the Mail class: $body = $mime->get  ; $headers = $mime->headers  ;  Note that you must call these two functions in this order as the headers   method partly uses the result of the get   method.  i  e m M _ l i a M g n i s U     470  Using SMTP with Mail  One of the features of the Mail class is that it can send an email using three dif- ferent methods: PHP’s mail   function, the server’s sendmail application, or an SMTP server. PHP’s mail   function can also use an SMTP server, but not if that server requires authentication.  If running PHP on your own computer, you can install a free SMTP server or just tap into one likely provided by your Internet provider or Web host. To do so, first create an array containing the SMTP server address and your authentication information: $smtp[‘host’] = ‘smtp.hostname.com’; $smtp[‘auth’] = true; $smtp[‘username’] = ➝ ‘username@hostname.com’; $smtp[‘password’] = ‘password’;  The auth element just indicates that authentication should be used. Now use this array as the second parameter in the Mail factory   method: $mail =& Mail::factory ‘smtp’, ➝ $smtp ;   Figure 12.21 Aside from the all-capital BODY and HEADERS, this is the code generated by the Mail_Mime class.  Using PEAR  The result is two pieces of data that can be used in an email  print their values to see the end result, Figure 12.21 . Finally, the Mail class can be used to send the actual email.  To do so, you don’t actually create an object of type Mail but rather invoke the class’s factory   method directly: $mail =& Mail::factory $backend ;  For the $backend value, this can be: mail  PHP’s built-in mail   function ; sendmail  if installed on the server ; or smtp  to use  an SMTP server . Assuming you can use the mail   function or sendmail on the server already, either of those options is fine. To  use an SMTP server, see the sidebar “Using SMTP with Mail.”  The final step is to send the email, providing the to address, the headers, and the body: $mail->send ‘to@address.com’, $headers, ➝ $body ;     U s i n g M a i l _ M m e  i  471   Chapter 12  To send HTML email: 1.

Check your menus, help files, or documentation for suggestions.     U s i n g M a i l _ M m e  i  475   Chapter 12  Sending HTML with images One of the reasons the resulting email in the preceding example is so plain  Figure 12.23  is that it lacks any images, a rudimentary element in Web pages. There are two ways you can incorporate images in your HTML emails. The first is easy and foolproof: just use the img tag, with an absolute URI for the image.  Some HTML  <img src=”http:  www.yoursite.com path  ➝ to image.ext”  >  Using this method, when the email is received, the mail client will attempt to download that image from that URI. But this method can also be frowned upon because it’s used by very bad people to track when spam reaches an address  the request for the image sends a signal to that server indicat- ing that the address was good .  An alternative is to use the Mail_Mime addHTMLImage   method. Start by putting the img tag in the HTML, but just use the image’s exact name as the source: $html = ‘... ...’;  Then, add the image using the class: $mime->addHTMLImage ‘ path to  ➝ image.ext ;  Then add the HTML to the email: $mime->setHTMLBody $html ;  To send email with images: 1. Open mail_html.php  Script 12.6  in your text editor or IDE, if it is not already open. 2. If you want, change the page title  line 6,  Script 12.7 .

Thanks to Mail_Mime, it’s sur- prisingly simple. Whether you’re creating plain text or HTML emails, just use the addAttachment   method: $mime->addAttachment $file_name, ➝ $file_type ;  The first argument used is the full name and path to the file on the server. This might be .. path to mydoc.doc or C:\data\spreadsheet.xls. The second argument is the file’s type, like applica- tion pdf.  With this one line of code, assuming that it can find the file on the server, you can quickly send attachments with your emails.   Figure 12.25 Not much new happening here, but check your email  Figure 12.26 !  Figure 12.26 The received email now includes an image  built into the message, not fetched from a server .  Figure 12.27 The plain text alternative of the message shows the image as an attachment  in my mail client .  Using PEAR  5. After creating the object, add the image.  $mime->addHTMLImage ‘logo2.png’ ; Because the src of the image in the HTML is logo2.png, the name of the file here must match that exactly. This code assumes that the file logo2.png is in the same directory as this script. To include an image located elsewhere, use an absolute or relative path: $mime->addHTMLImage ‘ path to  ➝ logo2.png’ ; Whatever the location of the file on the server, the src in the HTML should remain just logo2.png.  6. If you want, update the email’s subject.  $mime->setSubject ‘Testing HTML Email ➝ with an Image’ ;  7. Save the file as mail_image.php, place it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figure 12.25 .  8. Check your email to see the result   Figure 12.26 .  9. If possible, view the plain text alternative  version of the email  Figure 12.27 .

In truth, Ajax is just a label given to functionality that’s been present for years, but sometimes a good label helps, and when a powerhouse like Google uses Ajax  for Gmail, Google Suggest, and more , people pay attention.  In this chapter I provide an introduction to the Ajax concept, with PHP and MySQL  as its back end. As Ajax is still comparatively new, there are new ideas and debates for each aspect of the technology, but in two different examples I can demonstrate the entire soup-to-nuts of what Ajax is about and, in the process, provide real-world code. Because the heart of Ajax really is JavaScript and the Document Object Model  DOM , the PHP in this chapter will be basic. As sophisticated JavaScript may be new territory for you, the chapter concludes with a discussion of debugging techniques, as resolving Ajax problems requires special approaches.  A j a x  481   Figure 13.1 The typical client server model, where each data transfer is apparent to the end user.  Figure 13.2 The Ajax model, where the client server data transfer can happen unbeknownst to the end user.  Chapter 13  Introduction to Ajax Before getting into the code, you should understand what, exactly, Ajax is and how it differs from what you currently do with PHP. As you know, PHP is primarily a Web-based technology  although it can be used from  the command line—see Chapter 11, “PHP’s Command-Line Interface” . This means that PHP does its thing whenever a server request is made. A user goes to a Web page or submits a form; the request is made of the server; PHP handles that request and returns the result. Each execution of some PHP code requires an active request and a redrawing of the Web browser  Figure 13.1 . For the end user, this means they see their browser leave the current page, access the new one, down- load the new page’s content, and display the content, repeating as necessary.  The secret to Ajax is that it can make the server request happen behind the scenes while still changing what the user sees as  if they actively made the server request. JavaScript is really the key technology here.  With an Ajax transaction, JavaScript, which does its thing within a Web browser, makes the request of the server and then handles that request. The Web page can then be updated without ever seeming to leave the current page  Figure 13.2 . In action, this might mean: 1. The end user goes to a Web page. 2. The user types something in a box, clicks  a button, or drags something with their cursor.        x a j A o t n o i t c u d o r t n I  482   Ajax  3. Whatever the user does in Step 2 triggers JavaScript to request something from the server.  4. The server handles that request  using  PHP in this chapter , returning some data.  5. JavaScript receives that data and uses it to update the Web page, without reload- ing it.  Looking at all the technologies involved, you start with  X HTML, which is the  foundation of all Web pages. Then there’s JavaScript, which runs in the Web browser, asks for and receives data from the server, and manipulates the HTML by referring to the Document Object Model  DOM, an object-based representation of the elements of a Web page . And finally, on the server, you have our friend PHP. The last technolo- gy commonly involved is XML  Extensible Markup Language , which can be used in the data transfer. I say “can be,” because you don’t have to use XML. In fact, this chapter has two examples—one simple, one complex— without any XML. ✔ Tip    Jesse James Garrett coined the term Ajax  in February 2005. He has since claimed that Ajax is not an acronym. It just, you know, seems like an acronym.  I n t r o d u c t i o n t o A j a x        483  What Is Asynchronous?  One of the key components of Ajax is its asynchronous behavior. This term, which literally means not synchronous, refers to a type of communication where one side  say, the client  does not have to wait for the other side  the server  before doing something else.  In an asynchronous transaction, the  user can do something that makes the JavaScript request data from the server. While the JavaScript is awaiting that data, which it’ll then display in the  Web browser, the user is free to do  other things, including other things that involve JavaScript. So the asynchronicity makes the experience more seamless.  On the other hand, you can perform  synchronous transactions, if you are in  a situation where the user should wait until the data is in.   Chapter 13  A Simple Example One of my personal favorite best uses of Ajax starts with a commonplace Web presence: a registration form  Figure 13.3 . When using PHP to validate a registration form, there are many steps you’d take, from checking that all the required fields are filled out to validating the values in certain fields  e.g., a valid email address, a valid date of birth . If the registra- tion process requires a username for logging in, PHP would also check the database to see if that username is available. With a tradi- tional model, this check couldn’t take place until the form was submitted. With Ajax, this check can take place prior to form submis- sion  Figure 13.4 , saving the user from hav- ing to go back, think up a new username, and resubmit the form, repeating as necessary.  In developing this Ajax example, I’ll work the application backward, which I think makes it easiest to understand the whole process  it also leaves the newer information toward the end . For the server-side stuff, it’s really basic PHP and MySQL. I won’t develop it fully, but you shouldn’t have a problem fleshing it out when it comes time for you to implement this in a real site.     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     484  Figure 13.3 The basic registration form.  Figure 13.4 The availability of the requested username will be indicated prior to submitting the form to the server.   Figure 13.5 I’ll be creating the table in the test database, using the mysql client.  Figure 13.6 Creating the table.  Ajax  Creating the database This example will involve user registration. This might be part of a forum, e-commerce site, or whatever. At the very minimum, a users table is necessary, with fields for the user ID, username, password, first name, last name, and email address. For demonstration purposes, some sample data needs to be entered as well. To create and populate the database: 1. Access your MySQL database using the  mysql client. You can also use phpMyAdmin or what- ever other interface you prefer.  2. Select the test database  Figure 13.5 .  USE test; Since this is just an example, I’ll create the table within the test database.  3. Create the users table  Figure 13.6 .  CREATE TABLE users   user_id INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL ➝ AUTO_INCREMENT, username VARCHAR 20  NOT NULL, userpass CHAR 40  NOT NULL, first_name VARCHAR 20  NOT NULL, last_name VARCHAR 40  NOT NULL, email VARCHAR 60  NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY  user_id , UNIQUE  username   ; The table contains just six fields; you’ll likely want to expand it for your real- world needs. The user_id is the primary key, and the username field must be unique for each row. I set the userpass field as a CHAR 40 , as I’ll encrypt pass- words using SHA  , which returns a string 40 characters long. The table also has slots for the user’s name and email address.  485     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e      Figure 13.7 Populating the table.  Figure 13.8 Make sure you know what’s in your database before proceeding! Doing so will make debugging that much easier.  Chapter 13  4. Populate the users table  Figure 13.7 .  INSERT INTO users  username, ➝ userpass, first_name, last_name, ➝ email  VALUES  ‘sherif’, SHA ‘deadwood1’ , ‘Seth’, ➝ ‘Bullock’, ‘seth@address.com’ ,  ‘Al’, SHA ‘deadwood2’ , ‘Al’, ➝ ‘Swearengen’, ‘al@thegem.org’ ,  ‘Garret’, SHA ‘deadwood3’ , ‘Alma’, ➝ ‘Garret’, ‘agarret@address.net’ ,  ‘starman’, SHA ‘deadwood4’ , ‘Sol’, ➝ ‘Star’, ‘solstar@bank.com’ ; I’m just throwing in a few random records. You can use your own, type this query exactly as it is, or download the SQL commands from the book’s corre- sponding Web site.  5. Confirm the contents of the users table   Figure 13.8 . SELECT * FROM users; I’m going to focus on debugging quite a bit in this chapter because there are many technologies being used and you are probably less familiar with some of them. The first debugging technique is to know—for certain—what data you have in the server.  ✔ Tip    You don’t have to use MySQL for this example; you could use PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLite, a text file, or even a  simple array.     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     486   Ajax  Programming the PHP In discussing this example, I state that the Ajax aspect of the application will be to check that a username is available prior to submitting the form to the server. This PHP script, which is the server side of the Ajax process, just needs to check the availability of a provided username.  The script will be written so that it accepts a username in the URL; the script is invoked using: http:  hostname checkusername.php? ➝ username=XXXX  The PHP script then runs a query on the database to see if this username—XXXX— has already been registered. Finally the script should return a message indicating the availability of that username. This should all be quite easy for even a beginning PHP programmer.  One little quirk with this page: It will not use any HTML  gasp! . As this page won’t  be intended to be viewed directly in a Web browser, HTML is unnecessary.     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e     487   Script 13.1 This simple PHP script takes a submitted username  passed in the URL  and sees if it is already recorded in the database. Simple text messages are displayed, indicating the status.     Connect to the database: $dbc = @mysqli_connect  'localhost', 'username', 'password', 'test'  OR die  'The  availability of this username will be confirmed upon form submission.' ;     Define the query: $q = sprintf "SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE username='%s'", mysqli_real_escape_string $dbc,  Chapter 13  To create the PHP script: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 13.1 . <?php  Script 13.1 - ➝ checkusername.php  <?php  Script 13.1 - checkusername.php  This page checks a database to see if $_GET['username'] has already been registered. The page will be called by JavaScript. The page returns a simple text message. No HTML is required by this script!   * * * * * *      Validate that the page received $_GET['username']: if  isset $_GET['username']   {  trim $_GET['username']   ;     Execute the query: $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ;     Report upon the results: if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  echo 'The username is unavailable!';  echo 'The username is available!';  } else {  }  mysqli_close $dbc ;  } else {    No username supplied!  echo 'Please enter a username.';     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16 17  18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36  } ?>  488   Figure 13.9 If the PHP script could not connect to the database, then the availability of the username could not be determined. That information could be shown in the registration form.  Ajax  2. Validate that the page received a   username. if  isset $_GET[‘username’]   { No use in querying the database without a username!  3. Connect to the database.  $dbc = @mysqli_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’, ‘test’  OR ➝ die  ‘The availability of this ➝ username will be confirmed upon ➝ form submission.’ ; For sake of simplicity, I’m hard-coding the database connection into this script  as opposed to including a MySQL file for that purpose . Note that I’m using the MySQL Improved extension, available as of PHP 5 and MySQL 4.1. If you’re using older versions of either technology, you’ll want to switch to the mysql_* functions. You will likely need to change the MySQL access information provided here to val- ues that correspond to a valid username  password hostname for your server. If a connection to the database cannot be established, this page returns a generic message. This isn’t strictly necessary, but remember that anything returned by this script will be displayed on the HTML form page  Figure 13.9 .  continues on next page     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e     489   Chapter 13  4. Define and execute the query.  $q = sprintf “SELECT user_id FROM ➝ users WHERE username=’%s’”, ➝ mysqli_real_escape_string $dbc, ➝ trim $_GET[‘username’]   ; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; The query will be SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE ➝ username=’XXXX’ To create it, I use the sprintf   function  see Chapter 1, “Advanced  PHP Techniques,” if you are not familiar with it . The provided username will be trimmed and run through the mysqli_ real_escape_string   function for improved security.  5. Report upon the results of the query.  if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  echo ‘The username is  ➝ unavailable!’; } else {  echo ‘The username is  ➝ available!’; } This script just prints a string indicating the results of the query. These are the two primary responses, assuming there were no errors.  6. Close the database connection and com-  plete the page.  mysqli_close $dbc ;  } else {  echo ‘Please enter a username.’;  } ?> The else clause here applies if no user- name was supplied when calling the script.  7. Save the file as checkusername.php and  place it in your Web directory.  490     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A      Figure 13.10 Without providing a username in the URL, this is the result.  Figure 13.11 If the provided username has not been registered, the PHP script displays this message  and nothing more .  Figure 13.12 If the provided username has been taken, this is the result.  Figure 13.13 If the PHP script could not connect to the database in order to perform the query, this message is shown.  Ajax  Testing the PHP To fully understand what’s happening in  the client, it’s best to understand what the server side of things is doing. Toward that end, you should quickly confirm what checkusername.php does in different situa- tions. To do so, run it directly in your Web browser, offering different usernames in  the URL.  You should know by now how to test a PHP script, of course. The important point here is that debugging an Ajax application begins by confirming what the server is sending back to the client. To test the PHP script: 1. Load checkusername.php in your Web  browser  Figure 13.10 .  2. Rerun the script, providing an available username in the URL  Figure 13.11 . Doing so is just a matter of adding ?username=XXXX to the end of the URL.  3. Rerun the script, providing an unavailable  username in the URL  Figure 13.12 . Use one of the registered usernames   see Figure 13.8 or your own users table contents . So I might test the script with ?username=al.  4. If you want, check the result if the PHP script couldn’t connect to the database  Figure 13.13 . The easiest way to do so is to change the connection parameters so that they are invalid.     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e     491   Chapter 13  Writing the JavaScript, part 1 For many PHP programmers the JavaScript will be the most foreign part of the Ajax process. It’s also the most important, so I’ll go through the thinking in detail. I’m break- ing the JavaScript code into two sections: the creation of the XMLHttpRequest object and the use of said object. The first chunk of code will be used by both examples in this chapter  and can pretty much be used by any Ajax application you write . The second chunk of code will be application-specific.  To start, you’ll need to create an object through which all the magic happens. For this purpose, there is the XMLHttpRequest class. The functionality defined within this class is at the heart of all Ajax capabilities.  If the user’s browser supports the XMLHttpRequest  which I’ll show you how to test for in the next script , you’ll want to make an object of this type: var ajax = new XMLHttpRequest  ;  Windows Internet Explorer 5.x and 6.x do not support XMLHttpRequest and instead need to use an ActiveXObject: var ajax = new ActiveXObject “Microsoft.XMLHTTP” ;  And that’s really it to creating the object. Even if you’ve never done any JavaScript programming before, this is easy enough to follow. In this next script, I’ll formally imple- ment the two lines of code but wrap it in some conditionals and try…catch blocks  see Chapter 8, “Real-World OOP,” for a  discussion of PHP try…catch  to make sure it’s done right.     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     492   Script 13.2 This JavaScript file creates an object called ajax of a browser-supported type. This object will be used by the other JavaScript files  Scripts 13.3 and 13.6 .     Script 13.2 - ajax.js  This page creates an Ajax request  This page is included by other pages  need to perform an XMLHttpRequest.   * object. * that  * *      Initialize the object: var ajax = false;     Create the object...     Choose object type based upon what's supported: if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {     IE 7, Mozilla, Safari, Firefox,  Opera, most browsers:  ajax = new XMLHttpRequest  ;  } else if  window.ActiveXObject  {    Older IE browsers     Create type Msxml2.XMLHTTP, if  possible: try {  type instead: try {  ajax = new  ActiveXObject "Msxml2.XMLHTTP" ;  } catch  e1  {    Create the older  ajax = new  ActiveXObject "Microsoft.XMLHTTP" ;  } catch  e2  { }  }  }     Send an alert if the object wasn't created. if  !ajax  {  alert  'Some page functionality is  unavailable.' ; }  1 2 3  4  5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  14 15 16  17 18 19  20 21  22 23  24  25 26  27 28 29 30 31 32  33 34  35 36  Ajax  To write some of the JavaScript: 1. Create a new JavaScript script in your  text editor or IDE  Script 13.2 .    Script 13.2 - ajax.js  2. Initialize a variable. var ajax = false; In JavaScript you should declare variables using the keyword var. Here I declare the variable  called ajax, but it could be called anything  and initially set its value to false.  3. Create the XMLHttpRequest object, if   supported. if  window.XMLHttpRequest  {  ajax = new XMLHttpRequest  ;  If the browser supports the XMLHttpRequest object type, a new  object of that type will be created.  This will be the case for most browsers, including Internet Explorer 7  but not earlier versions , Firefox, Mozilla, Safari, and Opera.  4. Check if ActiveXObject is supported. } else if  window.ActiveXObject  { If the browser does not support XMLHttpRequest, then an object of  type ActiveXObject should be created. This only applies to Internet Explorer  versions prior to 7.  5. Try to create the ActiveXObject object.  try {  ajax = new  ➝ ActiveXObject “Msxml2.XMLHTTP” ; } catch  e1  {  ➝ ActiveXObject “Microsoft.XMLHTTP” ;  try {  ajax = new  } catch  e2  { }  }  continues on next page  493     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e      Chapter 13  Microsoft has developed several differ- ent flavors of ActiveXObject XMLHTTP. Ideally, you’d like to use the most current one. Since there’s no way of testing what versions are supported by the current browser, two try…catch blocks will attempt to make the object. If an object of type Msxml2.XMLHTTP cannot be creat- ed, then an attempt is made to make one of type Microsoft.XMLHTTP. Nothing is done with any caught excep- tions, as a more general error handling later in the script will suffice.  6. Complete the main conditional.  } This closes the else if clause begun in Step 4.  7. Send an alert if the object wasn’t created.  if  !ajax  {  alert  ‘Some page functionality  ➝ is unavailable.’ ; } If ajax is false, meaning that none of  the attempts to declare it as an object succeeded, then the entire Ajax applica- tion won’t work. In such a case, a simple message is displayed to the end user  Figure 13.14 , although you don’t have to do that.  8. Save the file as ajax.js and place it in  your Web directory. This file should be put in the same direc- tory as checkusername.php.     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     494  Figure 13.14 If the user’s browser supports JavaScript but none of the attempts to make the XMLHttpRequest object succeeds, this alert is displayed.  ✔ Tips    If you have an Ajax application that per- forms multiple Ajax transactions in the same Web browser, you’ll want to modify the code in ajax.js so that a JavaScript function returns an XMLHttpRequest object. Then you would call this function, assigning the returned value to a new variable for each separate Ajax transac- tion. This may make more sense to you once you’ve completed the first Ajax example.    People are often  understandably  con- fused about this point, but JavaScript is unrelated to the programming language Java. JavaScript is an implementation of a scripting language called ECMAScript.   Writing the JavaScript, part 2 The first sequence of JavaScript instructions creates the ajax.js file. The code in that file creates an XMLHttpRequest object, tailored for the Web browser in use. Once you’ve estab- lished the object, you can begin using it, start- ing by opening a connection. Provide to the open   method the type of request to make— GET, POST, or PUT—and the URL to use: ajax.open ‘get’, ‘scriptname.php’ ;  The object is called ajax, defined in the ajax.js file. It opens a connection to scriptname.php on the server, to which it will make a GET request.  With this first example  checking a user- name’s availability , you’ll need to modify that open   code to pass the username along to the script. You already know how  to do this: ajax.open ‘get’, ‘checkusername.php? ➝ username=XXXX’ ;  Adding ?username=XXXX to the URL achieves the desired result. If you look back at how the checkusername.php script is used  Figures 13.11 and 13.12 , this will make more sense.  The next step is to name the JavaScript user- defined function to be called when the PHP  Ajax  script returns its results. The onreadystate- change property takes this value. This prop- erty is one of five important XMLHttpRequest object properties listed in Table 13.1. Assign to this property the name of the function, without any parentheses: ajax.onreadystatechange = ➝ call_this_function;  So the JavaScript will send the request to the server, the server will send back a reply, and, at that time, the call_this_function   func- tion will be called. This function, defined in a little bit, will take the returned data and update the Web page accordingly.  The last step in this sequence is to send the request. For GET requests, you should provide the value null as its only argument: ajax.send null ;  That wraps up the “making the request” JavaScript; next is the handling of the returned results  what the server-side PHP script sends back . The first thing you’ll want to do is con- firm that the request was successful. To do so, check that the readyState is equal to 4  see Table 13.2 for the list of readyState values . if  ajax.readyState == 4  {     Handle the returned data.  continues on next page     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e     Table 13.1 You’ll rely upon these XMLHttpRequest properties in your JavaScript code.  XMLHttpRequest Properties  P r o p e r t y  onreadystatechange  Table 13.2 The five readyState values, of which the last one is the most important for knowing when to handle the returned data.  XMLHttpRequest readyState Values  C o n ta i n s   t h e … Name of the function to be called when the readyState property changes. Current state of the request  see Table 13.2 . Returned data as a string. Returned data as XML. HTTP status code returned.  Va l u e 0 1 2 3 4  M e a n i n g uninitialized loading loaded interactive complete  readyState  responseText responseXML status  495   Chapter 13  The readyState just indicates the status of the request process: at first it’s uninitialized, then the server page is loading, then it’s completely loaded; next up is some interac- tion and eventually the request is complet- ed. Often these states will change very quickly.  Along with the readyState value, you can also check the status property to know if it’s safe to process the returned data. if    ajax.readyState == 4  &&  ajax.status == 200    {  The status corresponds to the possible HTTP status codes, with which you might already be familiar. Table 13.3 has a small sampling of them.  Having created the XMLHttpRequest object, having performed the transaction, and  having confirmed the server results, the  final step is to use the returned data to  alter the Web browser content. The easiest way to access that data is by referring to the responseText property. This attribute stores the results of the server request  i.e., the PHP page , which, in this case, is one of the string messages  The username is unavailable!, The username is available!, etc. .  In this example, the JavaScript will take  this message and place it in the HTML.  To do that, the JavaScript uses the DOM  Document Object Model, see the accompa- nying sidebar “The Document Object Model”  to identify where on the page the text should go. Then the innerHTML property is assigned a value: document.getElementById ‘location_name’  ➝ .innerHTML = ‘Some message’;     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     496  Table 13.3 Every requested server page returns an HTTP status code. For Ajax purposes, 200 is the code to watch for.  Common HTTP Status Codes  C o d e 200 204 400 401 403 404 408 500  M e a n i n g OK No content Bad request Unauthorized Forbidden Not found Timeout Internal server error  The Document Object Model  The Document Object Model is a repre- sentation of an HTML page  also XML data  in a tree form. For example, the base of an HTML tree is the entire page, found within HTML tags. From that base there are two main branches: the HEAD and the BODY. Within each of these there are going to be many other branches, like the TITLE in the HEAD or a P in the BODY.  The DOM provides an object-oriented way to reference each branch and leaf on this tree. For example, document.form. username refers to the username input  in a form.  Rather than navigating the entire  tree, you can quickly address a  specific element by using document. getElementById ‘id_name’ . Thus  document.form.username and document. getElementById ‘username’  are the same thing  provided that the form has an input with an ID of username .  This is just a basic introduction to the DOM. You can either trust me and go with the examples as is, or search the Web for more information on this concept.   Ajax  To complete the JavaScript: 1. Create a new JavaScript script in your  text editor or IDE  Script 13.3 .    Script 13.3 - checkusername.js  continues on next page  Script 13.3 The second JavaScript file defines two functions specific to the Ajax application being developed. One function makes the request, and the second handles it.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43     Script 13.3 - checkusername.js  This page does all the magic for applying Ajax principles to a registration form. The users's chosen username is sent to a PHP  script which will confirm its availability.   * * * * *      Function that starts the Ajax process: function check_username username  {     Confirm that the object is usable: if  ajax  {      Function that handles the response: ajax.onreadystatechange = handle_check;     Send the request: ajax.send null ;  } else {    Can't use Ajax!     Call the PHP script.    Use the GET method.    Pass the username in the URL. ajax.open 'get', 'checkusername.php?username=' + encodeURIComponent username  ;  document.getElementById 'username_label' .innerHTML = 'The availability of this username  will be confirmed upon form submission.';  }  }  }    End of check_username   function.     Function that handles the response from the PHP script: function handle_check   {     If everything's OK: if    ajax.readyState == 4  &&  ajax.status == 200    {     Assign the returned value to a document element: document.getElementById 'username_label' .innerHTML = ajax.responseText;  }    End of handle_check   function.  497     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e      6. Send the request. ajax.send null ;  7. Complete the if  ajax  conditional.  } else {  document.getElementById  ➝  ‘username_label’ .innerHTML =  ➝ ‘The availability of this username ➝ will be confirmed upon form ➝ submission.’; } The easiest way to change the HTML page using JavaScript  and without reloading the browser  is to refer to an element’s innerHTML value. In the page’s HTML, there will be a SPAN tag with a name of username_label. This line of code says that that element’s “innerHTML”—the stuff between the tags—should be set to The availability of….  8. Complete the check_username   function.  }  9. Begin defining the function for handling  the request result. function handle_check   {  if    ajax.readyState == 4  &&  ➝  ajax.status == 200    { Because the handle_check   function  will be called every time the readyState changes, it should check to make sure that the request is complete before doing its thing. This conditional checks two things: that the readyState is completed  4  and that the server returned an OK status  200 .  Chapter 13  2. Begin defining the main function.  function check_username username  { This is the function that will be called when something happens in the Web browser. It takes one argument: the user- name. This will be passed to the PHP script. 3. Check that the request object has a value.  if  ajax  { A conditional checks if ajax has a value. This is an important check because the ajax.js code may not have been able to make a valid request object. As for variable scope, you can reference ajax in this function because in JavaScript, variables declared outside of any func- tion are automatically available within them. This differs from PHP.  4. Open the connection.  ajax.open ‘get’, ➝ ‘checkusername.php?username=’ + ➝ encodeURIComponent username  ; This code is similar to what I show in the introduction to these steps. In JavaScript, you cannot place variables within quota- tion marks, so the username must be concatenated  using the plus sign  to  the URL. For safety’s sake, I’m using the encodeURIComponent   function, which makes any submitted value safe to pass in the URL  for example, it’ll turn spaces into URL-safe pluses .  5. Declare what function handles the  response. ajax.onreadystatechange = ➝ handle_check; This line states that when the  readyState value of the object  changes, the handle_check   function should be called.  498     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A      10. Complete the handle_check   function.  11. Save the file as checkusername.js and  Ajax  place it in your Web directory. This file should be put into the same directory as checkusername.php and ajax.js.  document.getElementById  ➝  ‘username_label’ .innerHTML = ➝ ajax.responseText;  }  }    End of handle_check   function. Like the code in Step 7, the HTML will be changed using the innerHTML attrib- ute. Here, after a successful request, that attribute is assigned the value of ajax.responseText. That property stores, as a string, whatever was returned by the server.  ✔ Tips    Some Ajax examples you might come  across will use escape   instead of encodeURIComponent   for safeguarding data passed to the server. The escape   method only works on ASCII characters, leaving out-of-range characters unencoded. Conversely, encodeURIComponent   works on all UTF-8 characters, making it safer.    One modification you could make is to  separate the handle_check   conditional so that the readyState and status prop- erties are validated separately: if  ajax.readyState == 4  {  if  ajax.status == 200  {  document.getElementById  ➝  ‘username_label’ .innerHTML = ➝ ajax.responseText;  } else {  document.getElementById ‘username_ ➝ label’ .innerHTML = ‘The ➝ availability of this username will ➝ be confirmed upon form ➝ submission.’;  }  }  The main benefit would be that you could take separate steps if the process completes  readyState ==4  but the sta- tus was something other than OK  200 .    One of the constant Ajax debates is whether or not one should use the innerHTML property. It has been deprecat- ed by the W3C  World Wide Web Consortium, which governs Web stan- dards , meaning that it could disappear  in future standards. But browsers don’t really live and die by standards, and using innerHTML is so popular, that I doubt your Ajax code will be rendered useless in the near future. The alternative is to use something called nodes, which can be tedious, and are not universally supported.     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e     499   Chapter 13  Creating the HTML By this point in time in the Ajax application’s development, all of the challenging coding has been completed. Besides actually making the HTML page with the registration form, two things still need to be accomplished:  ◆ An event defined that starts the Ajax  process  ◆ A place created in the HTML where the  resulting message will be placed  For the first item, some JavaScript event must call the check_username   function. Table 13.4 lists some common events. For this form, I’ll attach an onchange   event to the username form input.  For the second item, some understanding of the Document Object Model  see the side- bar “The Document Object Model” earlier in the chapter  is required. For this example, where one string is returned by the server, you can make an empty SPAN to be filled by the JavaScript.     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     500  Table 13.4 A handful of the available JavaScript events. The word “element” can refer to a form field, an image, a button, even a link. The word “focus” means that the cursor is placed within that form element  as one common example .

Create a new HTML page in your text  editor or IDE  Script 13.4 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999 xhtml”>    Ajax   Registration Form  <script src=”ajax.js”  type=”text javascript” ➝ language=”javascript”>   <script src=”checkusername.js”  ➝ type=”text javascript” ➝ language=”javascript”>      <!-- Script 13.4 - register.html  continues on next page  Script 13.4 The HTML page that includes the two JavaScript files, makes the form, and ties the form into the JavaScript.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">        Registration Form         This page has the HTML registration form. The JavaScript code is included in the HEAD.      <!-- Script 13.4 - register.html   * * *  -->      Registration Form    Username: <input name="username" type="text" size="20" maxlength="20" onchange="check_username this.form.username.value "  >       Password:      Confirm Password:      First Name:      Last Name:      Email Address:                 501  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e      Chapter 13  In the first part of this page, the most important consideration is the inclusion of both JavaScript files: ajax.js and checkusername.js.  2. Begin the HTML form.  <form action=”register.php” ➝ method=”post”>    Registration Form  To clarify one possible point of confusion, the action value here is register.php. This is a separate script from checkuser- name.php. That file is used for Ajax purposes and only confirms the availabil- ity of a username. The purpose of regis- ter.php is to handle the entire form. That would likely also involve confirming the username’s availability, but it would vali- date the entire form as well, and then actually record the new registrant in the database. I have not, in this chapter, created  register.php, but it should be pretty easy to put together.   Username: <input name=”username” ➝ type=”text” size=”20” ➝ maxlength=”20” ➝ onchange=”check_username this.form. ➝ username.value ”  > <span ➝ id=”username_label”>   For the HTML page, this line ties into  all the JavaScript functionality. First, the input is called username and a JavaScript event is attached to it. That event says that when the value of this input changes, the check_username   function should  be called, passing that function the user- name input’s value. This gets the Ajax ball rolling.  3. Create the username input.  502     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A      Figure 13.15 The registration form when the user first arrives.  Ajax  After the input, a SPAN is added, with an id  not a name  of username_label. This is part of the DOM, and the JavaScript func- tion that handles the server result will dynamically assign text to this SPAN. When the form is first loaded, this area after the username is blank  Figure 13.15 .  4. Complete the HTML form.   Password: <input name=”pass1” ➝ type=”password”  >   Confirm Password: <input ➝ name=”pass2” type=”password”  >   First Name: <input ➝ name=”first_name” type=”text” ➝ size=”20” maxlength=”20”  >   Last Name: <input name=”last_name” ➝ type=”text” size=”20” ➝ maxlength=”20”  >   Email Address: <input name=”email” ➝ type=”text” size=”20” ➝ maxlength=”60”  >  <input name=”submit” type=”submit” ➝ value=”Register”  >    5. Complete the HTML page.         6. Save the file as register.html and place   it in your Web directory. All four files—checkusername.php, ajax.js, checkusername.js, and  register.html—should be in the  same directory.     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e     503   Chapter 13  Testing the application That’s it! You’ve now created an entire Ajax application from scratch. You have created four files:  ◆ checkusername.php  ◆ ajax.js  ◆ checkusername.js  ◆ register.html  These should all be in the same folder in your Web directory. Now, to test the applica- tion…but first: If yours does not work as it should  as it does in the following figures , you’ll need to use some good old-fashioned debugging work to solve the problem. I dis- cuss how to debug Ajax applications at the end of this chapter.     e l p m a x E e l p m i S A     504   Figure 13.16 The result  without reloading the Web page  if a username is available.  Figure 13.17 The result  without reloading the Web page  if a username is unavailable.  Ajax  To test the Ajax application: 1. Load register.html in a Web browser.  How you load register.html is very important. You absolutely must access  it through a URL! This might mean http:  localhost register.html or http:  www.example.com register.html. If you just open the HTML file without going through a URL, then the request for the PHP script will not be made to the server and it won’t work.  2. Type an available username in the  first text box, and then press Tab   Figure 13.16 . Nothing will happen until you press Tab or click in one of the other text inputs. At that point, the JavaScript will see that the value of the username has changed, triggering the event, and calling the check_username   function.  3. Change the username value to an unavailable one  Figure 13.17 . You don’t have to reload the page or do anything special; just delete what you typed in Step 2, type something new,  and press Tab.  ✔ Tip    If you submit the form, you’ll get a page not found error, because the form is sent to a register.php script, which has not been created. When you want to imple- ment this application in a live Web site, write your own register.php that vali- dates and handles the form as you other- wise would.     A S i m p l e E x a m p l e     505   Chapter 13  Full-Fledged Ajax This chapter begins with a “simple” demon- stration of Ajax, which turns out to be not all that simple. The overall premise was that the server returns a string that is put into the HTML page. Accomplishing this requires one PHP script, two JavaScript files, and an HTML document. But what if you want to return a lot of data to the client? You can take heart in knowing that doing so won’t require that much more work.  In this next, “full-fledged” example, the user will enter their U.S. zip code in a form field  Figure 13.18  and click the submit button. Using Ajax, the browser will then be updated to show a list of stores in order of how close they are  in miles  to the supplied zip code  Figure 13.19 . Much of the technology involved will be the same as it was in the “simple” example. The main difference is that a new idea is required for conveying between the server and the client not only the data but also what that data is. In particular, the server will send back to the JavaScript sever- al pieces of information—a name, an address, a city, a state, and so on—for several stores. The receiving page must be able to differen- tiate between each piece of data.  The old-school and common way of doing just that is to use XML. But XML can be a bit of a pain to work with, and there is an easier answer: JSON  JavaScript Object Notation . JSON is a “lightweight data-interchange for- mat”  see www.json.org  that JavaScript can intuitively work with. So in this next exam- ple, the biggest changes will involve creating and using JSON instead of working with a plain string.  506     x a j A d e g d e l F - l l u F  Figure 13.18 The simple form as the user sees it upon first loading the page.  Figure 13.19 The Ajax-generated result  without reloading the page  after the user clicks the submit button.   Figure 13.20 One sample MySQL result using the query from the PHP script.  Figure 13.21 A JSON representation of the query results in Figure 13.20.  Creating the Database  The database in this example will be  the zips database, exactly the same as it was created in Chapter 3. The database contains two tables: stores, which lists a bunch of stores, and zip_codes, which contains the latitude and longitude values for every U.S. zip code.  If you have not yet created this database on your server, get thee to Chapter 3 and follow the steps therein.  Note that this database also contains one stored function, called return_distance  . This function performs the math that cal- culates the distance between two latitudes and longitudes. Stored functions, and the creation of this one in particular, are also covered in Chapter 3. If you are not using at least version 5 of MySQL  or a data- base application that supports stored procedures , you’ll need to see Chapter 3 for alternatives because the query used in this example’s PHP script will not work for you.  Ajax  Programming the PHP The database for this example does not need to be created as it was created in Chapter 3, “Advanced Database Concepts.” See the side- bar for details or if you have not yet created the database. As for the PHP script used by this Ajax example, it’ll differ from checkusername.php in three ways:  ◆ The MySQL query will return a table of  data  Figure 13.20 .  ◆ The PHP script needs to return this array  of data, or an indication that no data is being returned.  ◆ If an array of data is returned, it should  be in JSON format.  In the preceding example, it really didn’t matter what, if anything, MySQL returned because the PHP script was going to return  i.e., print  a string message no matter what. Here, there’ll be a distinction between returning an array of data or nothing.  As for returning the data in the JSON format, that format isn’t too hard to understand  go to www.json.org for specifics of the syntax  or to create for yourself in PHP. Figure 13.21 shows the data in Figure 13.20 in JSON for- mat. That being said, the success of the JavaScript using the JSON data relies upon this format being exactly correct. To better guarantee that end, I recommend using the PECL json package  see http:  pecl.php. net package json . If you can’t or don’t want to install a PECL package for this example, then there are several JSON scripts written in PHP available online. Just download and use one of them.  F u l l - F l e d g e d A j a x     507   Chapter 13  To create the PHP script: 1. Create a new PHP script in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 13.5 . <?php  Script 13.5 - stores_json.php  continues on page 510  <?php  Script 13.5 - stores_json.php  This page queries a database, returning a list of 10 stores and how far away they are from the submitted zip code. The page will be called by JavaScript. No HTML is required by this script!   * * * * * *   $zip = FALSE;    Flag variable.  Script 13.5 This PHP script accepts a U.S. zip code in the URL and uses it to fetch a list of stores from the database. The list is then returned in JSON format.     x a j A d e g d e l F - l l u F     Validate that the page received $_GET['zip']: if   isset $_GET['zip']  &&     strlen $_GET['zip']  == 5    strlen $_GET['zip']  == 10      {     Chop off the last four digits, if necessary. if  strlen $_GET['zip']  == 10  {  $zip = substr $_GET['zip'], 0, 5 ;  } else {  }  $zip = $_GET['zip'];     Make sure it's numeric: if  is_numeric $zip   {     Connect to the database: $dbc = @mysqli_connect  'localhost', 'username', 'password', 'zips'  OR die  'null' ;     Get the origination latitude and longitude: $q = "SELECT latitude, longitude FROM zip_codes WHERE zip_code='$zip'"; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ;     Retrieve the results: if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  list $lat, $long  = mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ;  } else {    Invalid zip.   script continues on next page   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39  508   Script 13.5 continued  $zip = FALSE; mysqli_close $dbc ;  }  } else {    Invalid zip.  $zip = FALSE;  }  }  40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53  54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62  63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86  if  $zip  {    Get the stores and distances.     Big, important query: $q = "SELECT name, CONCAT_WS ' ', address1, address2 , city, state, s.zip_code, phone,  round return_distance $lat, $long, latitude, longitude   AS dist FROM stores AS s LEFT JOIN zip_codes AS z USING  zip_code  ORDER BY dist ASC LIMIT 5";     Put each store into the array: while  list $name, $address, $city, $state, $zip, $phone, $distance  =  mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM   {  $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ;  if  mysqli_num_rows $r  > 0  {     Initialize an array: $json = array  ;  $json[] = array 'name' => $name, 'address' => $address,  'city' => ucfirst strtolower $city  ,  'state' => $state,  'zip' => $zip,  'phone' => $phone,  'distance' => $distance ;  }     Send the JSON data: echo json_encode $json  . "\n";  } else {    No records returned.  echo 'null';  }  mysqli_close $dbc ;  } else {    Invalid zip.  echo 'null';  } ?>  Ajax  509  F u l l - F l e d g e d A j a x      2. Validate that the page received a zip code.  5. Connect to the database.  Chapter 13  $zip = FALSE; if   isset $_GET[‘zip’]  &&     strlen $_GET[‘zip’]  == 5    ➝  strlen $_GET[‘zip’]  == 10       {  To start, I assume that no valid zip  code has been received. Then I use a  conditional that checks if a zip code was passed to this script in the URL and, if so, if it’s either exactly five or ten characters in length. A U.S. zip code will be either 12345 or 12345-6789, so this script should accept both lengths.  3. Trim off the last four digits of the zip  code, if necessary. if  strlen $_GET[‘zip’]  == 10  { $zip = substr $_GET[‘zip’],   ➝ 0, 5 ; } else {  $zip = $_GET[‘zip’];  } This conditional results in having a zip code, now stored in $zip, that’s exactly five characters long. The zip codes in the database never use the -6789 extensions, so that can be chopped off.  4. Confirm that the zip code is numeric.  if  is_numeric $zip   { This is the last validation routine for the zip code. By this point in the script, the zip code must be exactly five characters long. All that is left to do is confirm that it is numeric  because a submitted zip code of pizza would match every check thus far .     x a j A d e g d e l F - l l u F  510  $dbc = @mysqli_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’, ‘zips’  OR ➝ die  ‘null’ ; As with the other PHP script, I’m hard- coding the database connection instead of including an external file. Unlike the last example, though, if a database con- nection couldn’t be made, I don’t want  to return a message, just a null value  which, in truth, is a string with a value  of null, not a real null . You’ll see how  this is used in the following JavaScript.  6. Define and execute the query.  $q = “SELECT latitude, longitude FROM ➝ zip_codes WHERE zip_code=’$zip’”; $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ; This first query—the script contains two—both validates the zip code  that it’s an actual U.S. zip code  and retrieves that zip code’s latitude and longitude. That information will be necessary for calculating distances between the given zip code and each store.  7. Retrieve the results of the query.  if  mysqli_num_rows $r  == 1  {  list $lat, $long  =  ➝ mysqli_fetch_array $r, MYSQLI_NUM ; } else {  $zip = FALSE; mysqli_close $dbc ;  } If one row was returned, the zip code is valid. Otherwise, the $zip variable should be set as false, because it’s invalid.   8. Complete the conditionals begun in   10. Fetch the data from the query.  Steps 4 and 2. } else {  }  $zip = FALSE;  } If the first five characters of the provided zip code are not numeric, the flag vari- able is set as false.  9.  If the zip code is valid, perform the main query. if  $zip  {  $q = “SELECT name,  ➝ CONCAT_WS ‘ ’, address1, ➝ address2 , city, state, ➝ s.zip_code, phone, ➝ round return_distance $lat, $long, ➝ latitude, longitude   AS dist FROM ➝ stores AS s LEFT JOIN zip_codes ➝ AS z USING  zip_code  ORDER BY ➝ dist ASC LIMIT 5”;  $r = mysqli_query $dbc, $q ;  Getting to this main query is really the point of the whole script. As you can see in Figure 13.20, this query returns a store’s name, full address, phone number, and distance from the given zip code. It cal- culates that distance using the return_ distance   stored procedure. For more discussion of this query, see Chapter 3.  Ajax  if  mysqli_num_rows $r  > 0  {  $json = array  ; while  list $name, $address,  ➝ $city, $state, $zip, $phone, ➝ $distance  = ➝ mysqli_fetch_array $r, ➝ MYSQLI_NUM   { If at least one row was returned, it should be fetched. Before using a loop that does that, an array is initialized. This array will store the JSON data. 11. Add each record to the $json array. $json[] = array ‘name’ => $name, ‘address’ => $address, ‘city’ => ➝ ucfirst strtolower $city  , ‘state’ => $state, ‘zip’ => $zip, ‘phone’ => $phone, ‘distance’ => $distance ; The while loop builds up a multidimen- sional array, where the main array has one array for each store. The subarrays contain each store’s data, indexed by data type  name, address, … . Because the zip code database I used in Chapter 3 has each city’s name in all capital letters  again, see Figure 13.20 , I make the name all lowercase, then capitalize the first letter, prior to storing this information in the array.  12. Complete the while loop and print   the data. } echo json_encode $json  . “\n”; If you’ve installed the json PECL pack- age, this is all you need to do to have the script return properly formatted JSON data  Figure 13.21 .  continues on next page  511  F u l l - F l e d g e d A j a x      Chapter 13  13. Complete the page.  } else {  echo ‘null’;  } mysqli_close $dbc ;  } else {  echo ‘null’;  } ?> If no records were returned by the query, then null is printed. The same applies if no valid zip code was provided.  14. Save the file as stores_json.php, place  it in your Web directory, and test in your Web browser  Figures 13.22, 13.23, and 13.24 . Remember that you’ll need to test  this by appending ?zip=XXXXX or ?zip=XXXXX-XXXX to the URL.  Figure 13.22 The result if a valid zip code was supplied.  Figure 13.23 The result if no or an invalid zip code was supplied.  Figure 13.24 The result using another valid zip code.     x a j A d e g d e l F - l l u F  512   Ajax  Writing the JavaScript Once you’ve written the server side of things  the PHP script , you can move to  the JavaScript. The ajax.js file will still  be used by this application to create the XMLHttpRequest object. But another JavaScript file will be required that makes the server request and handles the returned data. In this example, the first part of that equation will be simple, very much like the checkuser- name.js check_username   function. The second part of the equation—handling the returned data and displaying it in the Web page—will require new code, as the returned data is in the JSON format.  For starters, the returned data will still be accessed through the responseText attrib- ute. But that value will be a string  as shown in Figure 13.24 , not easily usable. To turn it into a more accessible format, you’ll run it through the eval   function. You could do something like var data = eval ‘ ‘ + ajax.responseText ➝ + ‘ ’ ;  The extra parentheses are necessary in order for this to work—just trust me on this one. After running the JSON data through eval  , you can refer to individual elements using the data[x].attribute syntax. The overall variable—data—is an array, meaning a spe- cific element is at data[0], data[1], and so on. Each array element is an object, whose attributes are at .attribute. You’ll see this better in the following script.  F u l l - F l e d g e d A j a x     513  Performing Synchronous  Transactions  This chapter’s examples perform asyn- chronous transactions. You might, how- ever, want to perform synchronous ones. You’d do so in situations where you don’t want the user to be doing anything else while the JavaScript is waiting for the server response.  To do this, set the open   method’s third argument to false: ajax.open ‘get’, ‘scriptname.php’, ➝ false ;  If not provided, this third argument has a default value of true, which is to say that performing asynchronous transactions is the default behavior.

Function that shows the list of stores: function show_stores stores  {     Initialize a string: var message = '';     Get each store: for  var i = 0 ; i < stores.length ; i++  {     Add to the string: message += ' ' + stores[i].name + ' ' + ' ' +  stores[i].address + ' ' + stores[i].city + ', ' + stores[i].state + ' ' + stores[i].zip + ' ' + stores[i].phone + '  approximately '  + stores[i].distance + ' miles  ';  }     Place the string in the page: document.getElementById 'list' .innerHTML = message;  }    End of show_stores   function.  33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76  Ajax  515  F u l l - F l e d g e d A j a x      Chapter 13  2. Begin defining the main function.  function get_stores zip  {  if  ajax  {  This is the function that will be called when something happens in the Web browser. It takes one argument: the zip code. This will be passed to the PHP script. Prior to that, though, a condi- tional confirms that ajax has a value.  3. Create the request. ajax.open ‘get’, ➝ ‘stores_json.php?zip=’ + ➝ encodeURIComponent zip  ; ajax.onreadystatechange = ➝ handle_stores; ajax.send null ; All of this code is much like that in checkusername.js, although a different URL and variable are used.  4. Complete the get_stores   function.  return false;  return true;  } else {  }  }    End of get_stores   function. Unlike check_username   this function will return a Boolean value. I’m doing this because of the way that the function will be called in the HTML page. Specifically, it’ll be called when the user clicks the submit button. That code is: onclick=”return ➝ get_stores this.form.zip.value ” Because of the return in that statement, whether or not the form is submitted depends upon what value is returned by the get_stores   function. If an ajax request could be made, then false is returned, stopping the form from being submitted to the server  because the data is already accessible . If an ajax request could not be made, true is returned and  516     x a j A d e g d e l F - l l u F   Figure 13.25 If the PHP script does not return any data, this message is displayed in the HTML page.  Ajax  the form will be sent to the server. This is desired because if an ajax request could not be made, the user should still be able to get the information somehow.  5. Begin defining the function for handling  the request result. function handle_stores   {  if    ajax.readyState == 4  &&  ➝  ajax.status == 200    { This code is the same as it was in checkusername.js.  6. Handle the returned data.  if  ajax.responseText.length > 10  {  show_stores eval ‘ ‘ +  ➝ ajax.responseText + ‘ ’  ; } else { document.getElementById ‘list’ . ➝ innerHTML = ‘ No stores matched ➝ your search. ’; } The PHP script will return either the data in JSON format  if the query worked  or the word null  if the query doesn’t return any results, if an invalid zip code is used, or if the database connection cannot be made . As a simple test to see if the stores were returned, check if the length of the response is greater than 10  or some other small number, allowing for both null and some extra spaces . So if just null is returned, the length will be less than 10 and the form will show that no match was made  Figure 13.25 . If any JSON data was returned, then the length will be greater than 10 and the show_stores   function is called. This function is sent one argument: the eval   version of the responseText.

Just a couple of exam- ples are Rico  www.openrico.org , Dojo  www.dojotoolkit.org , script.aculo.us  http:  script.aculo.us , XAJAX  www.xajaxproject.org , and SAJAX  www.modernmethod.com sajax . What  you can do with these frameworks is quite impressive!   The main downside to these is that they often use Ruby  or Ruby on Rails  or some other technology for the back end. This means that while the client side of things can be a snap to put together, you’ll need to put more effort into figur- ing out how to tie the client to the server  your PHP code . But doing so isn’t impossible, particularly with decent doc- umentation and many Web searches, and may be well worth your time.  It would also be worth your while to con- sider the PEAR HTML_AJAX package  Arpad Ray, one its developers, was kind enough to help out on this chapter . It’s a PHP-specific option, of course, so it may be much easier to integrate into your Web sites.   Figure 13.26 The HTML of a single returned store record  I use a JavaScript alert to display it—see the debugging section at the end of the chapter .  Ajax  A simple for loop can access every stores element. The variable is an array  of objects, each object representing one of the records returned by the MySQL  database. In the loop, you can refer to stores.length to see how many items are in the array  like count $stores  in PHP . For each element in the array, the loop refers to stores[i]. Then, all you need to do is refer to the attributes of that object  the object being stores[i] . These attributes correspond to the array indexes set in the PHP script: name, address, city, state, zip, phone, and distance. Each of these values is concate- nated to the message variable, along with some HTML. Figure 13.26 shows an individually formatted record.  10. Complete the show_stores   function.  document.getElementById ‘list’ .  ➝ innerHTML = message; }    End of show_stores   function. All that’s left to do is assign the com- piled message variable to the proper HTML element’s innerHTML.  11. Save the file as stores.js and place it in  your Web directory. This file should be put into the same directory as stores_json.php and ajax.js.  ✔ Tip    Using the JavaScript eval   function can  be unsafe if the source of the evaluated code cannot be trusted. In such cases, a JSON parser could be used instead: show_stores ajax.responseText. ➝ parseJSON   ;  519  F u l l - F l e d g e d A j a x      Script 13.7 This HTML page includes the two required JavaScript files and shows an HTML form.  1  2  3  4 5 6  7  8 9 10 11 12  13 14 15  16 17  18 19 20 21 22 23 24  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org   TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd"> <html xmlns="http:  www.w3.org 1999  xhtml">     Find Stores  <script src="ajax.js"  type="text javascript" language="javascript">   <script src="stores.js"  type="text javascript" language="javascript">      <!-- Script 13.7 - stores.html   * * the HEAD. *  --> <form action="find_stores.php" method="post">  This page has a simple HTML form.

I have not, in this chapter, created find_stores.php, but it would do exactly what stores.php does, except it would display the data in an HTML page instead of printing it in JSON format. 3. Create the DIV.     After the form, a DIV is added, with an  id  not a name  of list. This is part of the DOM that JavaScript will dynamically assign text to.

In my experience developing Ajax applica- tions from scratch, I’ve picked up quite a few useful debugging techniques, outlined in the following steps.     D e b u g g i n g A j a x A p p l i c a t i o n s     523  Making POST Requests  I didn’t have the need to in this chapter’s two examples, but you can perform POST requests with Ajax instead of GET ones. To do so, start by naming that method when invoking the open   function: ajax.open ‘post’, ‘scriptname.php’ ;  Then you’ll need to pass the data when calling the send   method. The data should be a string in the format of arg1=value&arg2=value&arg3=value…  You might accomplish this by doing something like: var post_data = ‘first_name=’ + encodeURIComponent first_name  + ‘&last_name=’ + encodeURIComponent last_name  +’&city=’ + encodeURIComponent city ;  Finally: ajax.send post_data ;   Figure 13.30 When PHP pages run dynamically generated queries on a database, it’s best to know exactly what that query is.  Chapter 13  To debug Ajax applications: 1. Run your applications through a URL!  For the PHP to work, it must be accessed through http:  . This means that you must load your HTML page through http:  .  2. Test your PHP script separately.  This is something I include as a step for both Ajax examples. Be in the habit of doing this automatically, not just when things go awry.  3. Test your database queries separately.  This, and many other unmentioned tech- niques, are essential to debugging your PHP scripts, should Step 2 indicate a problem. Print out the exact query ies  PHP is running  Figure 13.30  and use another interface, like the mysql client or phpMyAdmin, to confirm the results.  4. Validate, if appropriate, the data returned  by the PHP script. If the JavaScript function handling the returned data expects to receive XML or JSON, then the returned text must be in strict XML or JSON format. To validate that, follow Step 2, and then use a valida- tion tool  search the Web  to confirm that the data conforms to the proper format.     s n o i t a c i l p p A x a j A g n i g g u b e D     524   Figure 13.31 JavaScript alert prompts, while generally annoying, can be valuable debugging tools.  Figure 13.32 This alert reveals the data, in JSON format, received by the JavaScript from the PHP page.  Ajax  5. Use JavaScript alerts to indicate what’s  going on. Since so much is going on behind the scenes, it’s often necessary to shed some light on the processes. Add code like alert ‘in the check_username   function’ ; to your JavaScript code  e.g., put that alert as the first line in the check_username   function . Then, when you test the appli- cation, you’ll see what the JavaScript is trying to do  Figure 13.31 .  6. Use JavaScript alerts to indicate the val-  ues of variables. There are three families of values you’ll need to confirm:  ◆ Values received by a function:  alert zip ; Use this for any JavaScript function, like the one triggered by the HTML event or the one called when the PHP script returns its value.  ◆ Values returned by the PHP script:  alert ajax.responseText ; Since responseText stores the data you’ll deal with in the JavaScript, con- firming its value is a great debugging technique  Figure 13.32 .  ◆ Values to be assigned to HTML   elements: alert message ; You could also have problems in writ- ing new HTML to the Web page. In such cases, you’ll need to confirm if the problem is in the message being written  tested using such an alert  or in the writing process itself  i.e., assigning a value to innerHTML .  continues on next page  525     D e b u g g i n g A j a x A p p l i c a t i o n s      Chapter 13  7. Make sure you reload your Web browser  after making changes. Failure to do so is a common, and very frustrating, mistake.  8. Test with multiple browsers.  With JavaScript and HTML, different browsers can behave differently, so see how your applications behave in multiple browsers. Of the multiple browsers you test on, the first one should be good, like Firefox, and not quirky, like Internet Explorer.  9. Watch the method—GET or POST—  being used. Some browsers  I’m looking at you, Internet Explorer  cache GET page requests, so it might look as if the changes you made didn’t take effect. Also, it’s possible that using POST in your Ajax won’t work properly with the PHP script  it’s odd, but I’ve witnessed it myself , so try switching methods to rule that out as a culprit. To allow for any method in your PHP script, use $_REQUEST instead of $_POST or $_GET.     s n o i t a c i l p p A x a j A g n i g g u b e D     526   Figure 13.33 Firefox’s JavaScript console.  Ajax  10. Use a JavaScript console.  Good browsers, like Firefox and Safari, can show JavaScript errors in a separate window  Figure 13.33 , which will  save you some grief. To enable this on Firefox, you’ll need to opt for installing the Development Tools during installa- tion. On Safari, enable the Debug menu  Figure 13.34 , where you can access the JavaScript console.  11. Use a JavaScript debugger.  Firefox users benefit greatly from the Venkman debugger  www.mozilla.org  projects venkman  . Internet Explorer users have the Microsoft Script Debugger.  Figure 13.34 Safari’s Debug menu, which needs to be enabled in order to appear.     D e b u g g i n g A j a x A p p l i c a t i o n s     527   Chapter 13  Know When You Shouldn’t Use Ajax  Ajax is, without a doubt, pretty cool, but what’s cool isn’t always what’s best  despite what you thought in high school . As with any technology, employ Ajax because you should  when it adds useful features without adding more problems and excluding users , not because you can or know how.  Since Ajax relies upon JavaScript, one potential problem is that not all users enable JavaScript and it can run differently on different browsers. A well-implemented Ajax example can work seamlessly on any browser, but you really need to be thorough. You can also create a non-Ajax version of a system for those with JavaScript disabled: not difficult, but again, something you do need to think about.  Another problem is that Ajax renders the browser’s history feature unusable. For that matter, you can’t bookmark Ajax pages the way you can search results  the page itself can be book- marked, but not after some interaction . So by adding functionality, your Ajax application will remove common features. And Ajax requests still require a server connection and the data transfer, so they don’t save any resources, just reallocate them.  Finally, I’ll point out that there’s an argument to be made that IFrames offer similar function- ality to Ajax but without some of its downsides.     s n o i t a c i l p p A x a j A g n i g g u b e D     528   14  XML and PHP  XML, the Extensible Markup Language, is one of the most used technologies for shar- ing data between computers and applications. XML provides a format for storing not just information but also information about the information  aka meta-information . XML, like HTML, is based on Standard Generalized Markup Language, or SGML, which means that you’ll see numerous similarities between the two  in fact, XHTML, is a combination of them . Early versions of PHP supported XML, PHP 4 improved upon that support, and PHP 5 took things even further.  This chapter begins with a basic introduction to XML: what it is, the proper XML syntax, and how to make your own XML document. From there, PHP will take over, both for reading and creating XML documents. You’ll learn about and use the two primary XML handling methods. The chapter wraps up with a demonstration of creating RSS  Really Simple Syndication  feeds, an increasingly popular feature of Web sites and just one use of XML.  X M L     a n d P H P  529   Chapter 14  What Is XML? XML, which is governed by the World Wide Web Consortium  W3C , was created with several goals in mind:  ◆ To be a regulated standard, not the pro- prietary technology of any one company  ◆ To act as a highly flexible way to store  nearly any type of information  ◆ To be easily readable by humans and still  usable by computers  ◆ To be able to check itself for validity and  integrity  While XML itself is not actually a markup language—despite its name—it provides a foundation for you to manufacture your  own markup language. A markup language is used to help define or describe pieces of information. For example, the HTML code  Giant  indicates that the word Giant should be displayed in empha- sized text.  With XML you use tags to encapsulate pieces of information in defined chunks. XML tags  or elements as they are formally called  are the opposite of HTML tags in that they define what something is but do not reveal how that something should be displayed. Whereas the purpose of HTML  is to present information, the purpose of XML is to identify information.  ? L M X s I       t a h W  530  XML and…  Because XML is all about providing an independent way to store and transmit data, it’s often intertwined with other networking technologies. You’ll see  other acronyms, like RPC  Remote Procedure Calls , SOAP  which used to  be an acronym but technically isn’t any- more , WSDL  Web Services Description Language , and REST  Representational State Transfer . All of these help create Web services: where part of the content of one Web site is based upon data requested from another Web site. Google, eBay, PayPal, Amazon, Yahoo!, and  others all offer ways to use their data  in your applications.  Every book having its limitations,  you won’t find examples of these here. Sadly, this chapter alone can only offer  a mere introduction to XML. But that knowledge—basic XML—is key to imple- menting Web services in your own site when you’re ready.   XML and PHP  The power of XML is that you are not limit- ed to any predetermined set of tags; you can actually use XML to come up with your own. Once you have created your markup language  your own definition of elements , you can begin to store data formatted with- in the newly defined tags.  XML documents can be created in any text editor or IDE. But they cannot necessarily be read in a Web browser like any old Web page  Figures 14.1, 14.2, and 14.3 . You can use PHP to turn XML data into a browser-readable format, as you’ll see by chapter’s end.  Figure 14.1 Firefox  here, on Macintosh  automatically parses an XML document to display it in a more meaningful form.  Figure 14.2 Safari  also for Macintosh  shows XML files as plain text, with the tags treated as unknown HTML  you can still see them in the source of the page .  W h a t       I s X M L ?  Figure 14.3 Internet Explorer  on Windows  is also able to render XML data.  531   Chapter 14  XML Syntax Before doing anything with XML, you must understand how XML documents are struc- tured. An XML document contains two parts:  ◆ The prolog or XML declaration  ◆ The data  The XML prolog is the first line of every XML file and should be in the form    It indicates the XML version and, sometimes, the text encoding or similar attributes. There are actually two versions of XML—1.0 and 1.1—but the differences aren’t important here and using version 1.0 is fine.  The main part of the XML document is the content itself. This section, like an HTML page, begins and ends with a root element. Each XML document can have only one root.  Within that root element will be more nest- ed elements. Each element contains a start tag, the element data, and an end tag:  data   One example might involve products for an e-commerce store  Script 14.1 . In this example, store is the root element.  The XML rules for elements insist upon the following:  ◆ XML tags must be balanced in that they  open and close  for every   there must be a   .  ◆ Elements can be nested but not inter- twined. HTML will let you get away  with a construct like   Soul Mining  , but XML will not.  532  x a t n y S L M X  Script 14.1 An XML document representing two products in a virtual store.           1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18         T-Shirt    XL    White    12.00          Sweater    M    Blue    25.50             XML and PHP  As for the tag names, they are case-sensitive. You can use letters, numbers, and some other characters, but tag names cannot contain spaces or begin with the letters xml. They can only begin with either a letter or the underscore.  Before getting into an example, two last pieces of information. First, it is safe to use white space outside of elements but not within the tags or between them  XML is generally sensitive to white space, unlike PHP or HTML . Second, you can place com- ments within an XML file—for your own use, not for any technical purposes—by using the same syntax as HTML:    To start down the XML path, you’ll hand- code an XML document: a partial listing of the books I’ve written  with apologies for the self-centeredness of the example .  X M L S y n t a x  533   Chapter 14  To write XML: 1. Begin a new XML document in your text  editor or IDE  Script 14.2 .      2. Open with the root element.    For a file to be proper XML, it must use a root element. All of the content of the page will be stored between the opening and closing tags of this element. You can make up the name of this element, as is the case with all of your elements.  3. Add a book to the file.

Save this file as books1.xml.  If you want, view it in a Web browser  Figure 14.4 .  X M L S y n t a x  535   Chapter 14  Attributes, Empty Elements, and Entities The preceding section of the chapter and the books1.xml file demonstrate the basic syntax of an XML document. There are three more concepts to cover before learning how to handle XML with PHP.  An element, as already described, has both tags and data. This is like HTML:  some text here   Also like HTML, XML elements can have attributes:  data   some text here   XML elements can have an unlimited num- ber of attributes, the only restriction being that each attribute must have a value. You could not do:  data   You can use either single or double quotes for quoting your attribute values, but you must use quotes and you should be consis- tent about which type you use.  Attributes are often used with empty ele- ments. An empty element is one that doesn’t encapsulate any data. As an HTML example,   is an empty element. Just as XHTML requires the space and the slash at the end of an empty element, so does XML:    For example, you might have this:    The last little idea to throw out here is the entity. Some characters cannot be used in XML data, as they cause conflicts. Instead, a character combination is used, starting with the ampersand  &  and ending with the semicolon  ; . Table 14.1 lists five of the predeclared XML entities.  536  s e i t i t n E d n a   ,     s t n e m e l E y t p m E       ,  s e t u b i r t t A  Table 14.1 Use these five entities in your data whenever one of these special characters is required.  XML Entities  E n t i t y  &amp; &lt; &gt; &apos; &quot;  M e a n i n g & < > ‘ “   XML and PHP  To indicate that these two titles are sec- ond editions, an attribute is added to their title elements, with values of 2. The third book, which is in its first edi- tion, won’t have this attribute, although you could add it with a value of 1.  continues on next page  To use attributes, empty elements, and entities: 1.

You can also create your own entities in a Document Type Definition file, discussed next in the chapter.  539  A t t r i b u t e s  ,       E m p t y E l e m e n t s     ,   a n d E n t i t i e s   Chapter 14  Document Type Definitions XML files primarily contain data, as you’ve already seen in the first three scripts. That data can also be associated with a schema, which is a guide for how the XML docu- ment should be formatted. A schema can  be put together in many kinds of ways, the DTD, a Document Type Definition, being one of the older, standard methods  includ- ed in the definition of XML 1.0 . For the simple examples in this chapter, a DTD will suffice. A DTD or any other schema is used to validate an XML document. They are optional, though, as XML data can be used with or without validation.  To associate a DTD with an XML file, a  reference line is placed after the prolog but before the data:        The syntax begins <!DOCTYPE name. This is similar to HTML documents that begin with <!DOCTYPE html, stating that the root ele- ment of the file is the html tag. Within the document type declaration, you can define your elements or you can reference an exter- nal document that contains these defini- tions. For the declaration to point to an external file, your document type declara- tion would be <!DOCTYPE name SYSTEM ➝ “ path to filename.dtd”>  where filename.dtd is the included file and  path to is a Uniform Resource Indicator, or URI, pinpointing where that file is on the server.  Now that the XML file references the DTD, that file must be created. This process is called document modeling, because you are creating a paradigm for how your XML  540     s n o i t i n i f e D e p y T t n e m u c o D      XML and PHP  data should be organized. A DTD defines every element and attribute in your markup language.  The syntax for defining an element is    where name is the name of the new tag and it will contain content of type TYPE.  Table 14.2 lists the three primary element types and their meanings.  Applying this to the e-commerce example  Script 14.1 , some of the elements could be defined like so:          The last element, picture, is of type EMPTY because it has no content  it has an attrib- ute of filename .  The rules just defined seem to cover the XML in Script 14.1, but there are still a couple of missing pieces. First, there’s another element used, that of product, which contains all of the other elements. To define it: <!ELEMENT product  name, size, price, ➝ picture >  This states that product contains four other elements in the order of name, size, price, and picture. Definitions can be more flexi- ble by using regular expression–like syntax. <!ELEMENT product  name, size*, price, ➝ picture? >  This line indicates that product can contain up to four elements. One element, size, can be listed anywhere from zero to multiple times. Another element, picture, is entirely optional, but if present, there can be only one. Table 14.3 lists the pertinent charac- ters for defining elements.  continues on next page 541     D o c u m e n t T y p e D e f i n i t i o n s     Table 14.2 These are the three main element types, although an element can also consist of other elements or mixed data.  Element Types  Ty p e   PCDATA   EMPTY ANY  A s s o c i at i o n Generally text  specifically Parsed- Character Data  Nothing Anything  Table 14.3 The four symbols here reflect their regular expression counterparts and are used to more specifically define an element.  Element Type Symbols  Sy m b o l ? + *   M e a n i n g Optional  zero or one  At least one Zero or more Or   Chapter 14  You can extend this even further by dictat- ing that an element contain other elements, parsed-character data, or nothing, using the OR character: <!ELEMENT thing  other_element  PCDATA ➝  EMPTY >  The second problem with the current model for Script 14.1 is that it doesn’t reflect the picture element’s attribute  the filename . To allow elements to have attributes, make an attribute list within the DTD. This can be done only after defining the elements  or at least, the attributes of an element must be defined after the element itself has been defined . <!ATTLIST element_name attribute_name attribute_type ➝ attribute_description >  The attribute_name field is simply a text string like color or alignment. The attribute_ type indicates the format of the attribute. Table 14.4 lists the possibilities.     s n o i t i n i f e D e p y T t n e m u c o D     542  Another possibility is for an attribute to be an enumerated list of possible values: <!ATTLIST element_name attribute_name  value1  value2  ➝ “value1” >  The preceding code says that element_name takes an attribute of attribute_name with possible values of value1 or value2, the for- mer being the default.  The third parameter for an attribute—the attribute’s description—allows you to fur- ther define how it will function. Possibilities include REQUIRED, meaning that an element must use that attribute; IMPLIED, which means that the attribute is optional; and FIXED, indicating that the attribute will always have the same value. To round out the definition of the picture element for Script 14.1, an attribute should be added: <!ATTLIST picture filename NMTOKEN REQUIRED >  Now that you’ve seen the foundation of defining elements, you can write a Document Type Definition that corresponds to the books XML.  Table 14.4 There are more options for your attribute type field, but these four cover the basics.  Element Attribute Types  Ty p e  CDATA NMTOKEN  NMTOKENS  M e a n i n g Character Data Name Token  Several Name Tokens  ID  Unique Identifier  E x a m p l e General text String  without white space  NMTOKENS separated by white spaces  e.g., “Jessica Zoe Sam”  Text or numerical,  but it must be unique for each element   XML and PHP  To write a Document Type Definition: 1.

Define the book element.  <!ELEMENT book  title, author+, year, ➝ pages?, chapter*, cover? > This tag will contain up to six other tags: title, author, and year, which are required; chapter, which is optional and can be listed numerous times; and pages and cover_image, both of which are optional but can occur only once. The author is also flagged as being allowed multiple times.  4. Define the title, author, year, pages,  and chapter elements.           Each of these elements contains only character data.  5. Define the cover element.   This one item is different from the others because the element will always be empty. The information for this element will be stored in the attribute.  6. Define the attributes for title  and chapter. <!ATTLIST title edition NMTOKEN IMPLIED > <!ATTLIST chapter number NMTOKEN IMPLIED pages NMTOKEN IMPLIED > The title element has one optional attribute, the edition. The chapter ele- ment has two attributes—number and pages—both of which are optional.  544     s n o i t i n i f e D e p y T t n e m u c o D     Well-Formed and Valid XML  Two ways of describing an XML docu- ment are well formed and valid. A well- formed XML document conforms to the XML standard. These are the rules dis- cussed in the “XML Syntax” section of this chapter. A valid XML document is both well formed and adheres to the rules laid out in its associated schema  or Document Type Definition file.  Most XML data can be used as long as  it is well formed, which is why many dis- cussions of XML don’t even go into the topics of schema and DTD. But being valid is, for obvious reasons, better.   7. Define the attribute for cover.  8. Save this file as collection.dtd.  <!ATTLIST cover filename NMTOKEN REQUIRED > The cover element will take one manda- tory attribute, the filename of type  NMTOKEN, which means it will be a string  e.g., image.jpg . Keep in mind that the element itself is not required, as defined in the book tag. So the XML file should either include cover with a filename attribute or not include it at all.  XML and PHP  Now that the document modeling is done, the DTD needs to be linked to  the XML file.  9. Open books2.xml  Script 14.3  in your  text editor or IDE.  10.

More sophisticated than a DTD, and having vastly different syntax, XML Schema serves the same purpose but requires a whole new body of knowledge.    One of the great things about XML is that you can write your own DTDs or make use of document models created by others, which are freely available online. Developers have already written models for books, recipes, and more.    If you get into developing complex XML  applications, you may want to learn about namespaces, which is another way to group elements. Check an XML refer- ence for more information.    Script 14.6 shows books3.xml   Script 14.5  with the element defini- tions within the document instead  of using an external DTD.     s n o i t i n i f e D e p y T t n e m u c o D     546   Script 14.6 To define the elements in the XML file, the DTD reference could be replaced.

One thing you can do with XML is parse it. Parsing XML is a matter of using an application or library to access XML files and…  ◆ Check if they are well formed  ◆ Check if they are valid  ◆ Access the stored data  A parser, in short, takes XML files and breaks them down into their various pieces. As an example, the code  Air  consists of the opening tag    , the content  Air , and the closing tag    . While this distinction is obvious to the human eye, the ability of a computer to pull meaning out of a string of characters is the power of XML.  There are two types of XML parsers: event- based and tree-based. The former goes into action when an event occurs. An example of an event would be encountering an opening tag in an XML file. By reading an entire file and doing things at each event, this type of parser—also called a SAX  Simple API for XML —manages the entire XML document. Expat, to be demonstrated next, is an event- based parser.  The second parser type views an XML file and creates a tree-like representation of the entire thing that can then be manipulated. These are primarily DOM  Document Object Model  systems such as libxml. Figure 14.7 shows how Script 14.1 would be represented as a DOM tree. SimpleXML, covered later in the chapter, is a DOM parser.     L M X g n i s r a P  Figure 14.7 A DOM, or tree, representation of the store XML file  Script 14.1 .  548   Parsing XML with Expat Using Expat with PHP is a four-step process: 1. Create a new parser. 2. Identify the functions to use for handling  events.  3. Parse the file. 4. Free up the resources used by the parser.  The first step is accomplished using xml_parse_create  . $parser = xml_parser_create  ;  The second step is the most important. Because Expat is an event-handler parser, it makes use of callback functions when encountering events. The primary events that occur are reading:  ◆ An opening tag  ◆ The content between tags  ◆ A closing tag  You need to tell PHP what user-defined functions should be called when each of these events occurs. For the opening and closing tags, use the xml_set_element_ handler   function: xml_set_element_handler  $parser, ➝ ‘open_element_function’, ➝ ‘close_element_function’ ;  XML and PHP  For the tag content, use xml_set_character_ data_handler   to name the callback  function: xml_set_character_data_handler  $parser, ➝ ‘data_function’ ;  Now, when the parser encounters the differ- ent events, it will automatically send that content to the proper function.  Parsing the file requires the use of the xml_parse   function, which takes two  arguments  and an optional third . xml_parse  $parser, $data, ➝ $stopping_point ;  This function is first fed the pointer or refer- ence to the parser, and then the information to be parsed. The third argument tells the parser when to stop working.  Finally, you should free up the resources used by the parser by calling xml_parser_free  $parser ;  One use of PHP and XML is to turn XML documents into HTML so that the informa- tion can be displayed in the browser  espe- cially because some of the currently avail- able browsers will not do this automatically . As an example, I’ll write a PHP script that uses Expat to make a legible Web page from an XML file.  P a r s i n g X M L     549   Chapter 14  To parse XML with PHP: 1. Create a new document in your text edi- tor or IDE, beginning with the standard HTML  Script 14.7 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>    <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   XML Expat Parser  <style type=”text css”  ➝ title=”text css” media=”all”> .tag {  color: 00F;  } .content {  color: C03;  } .attribute {  color: 063;  } .avalue {  color: 000;  }         <?php  Script 14.7 - expat.php I add the   tag here because I’ll be using spaces throughout the page to align my code and I want the Web browser to honor them. And yes, that means this isn’t valid XHTML, but that’s a price I’m willing to pay in this example. Notice that I’ve also declared four CSS classes to help with the formatting of the output.  continues on page 553     L M X g n i s r a P  Script 14.7 This script uses PHP in conjunction with the Expat library to parse XML documents, turning them into an HTML page.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">          XML Expat Parser     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  550  .tag {  color: 00F;  } .content {  color: C03;  } .attribute {  color: 063;  } .avalue {  color: 000;  }   script continues on next page    XML and PHP  Script 14.7 continued          <?php  Script 14.7 - expat.php  This script will parse an XML file.

Define the necessary constants.  4. Begin a switch for handling the different  define  ‘LT’, ‘<span ➝ class=”tag”>&lt;’ ; define  ‘GT’, ‘&gt; ’ ; My script will mimic what the built-in Firefox or Internet Explorer parser does with XML files  see Figure 14.6 . To this end, I’ll frequently be printing out the greater-than and less-than symbols in a blue font. The start of the tags  the less- than symbol  will also start the span with the CSS class association. The close of the tags  the greater-than symbol  will close this same span.  3. Begin the function for handling   opening tags. function handle_open_element  $p, ➝ $element, $attributes  { $element = strtolower $element ; The function that will be called when- ever an opening tag is encountered by the parser will be handle_open_element  . This function will receive from the parser the parser reference, the name of the ele- ment, and an associative array of any attributes that element contains. As an example, the chapter element can have both number and pages attributes. Upon encountering that tag, the parser will send this function the values $p  for  the parser , chapter  the name of the  element , and an array that could be defined like so: $attributes = array  ‘NUMBER’ => 1, ➝ ‘PAGES’ => ‘34’ ;  One oddity is that every element  and attribute name is received in  all-uppercase letters, so I use the  strtolower   function to turn them back into a lowercase form.   XML and PHP  elements. switch  $element  {  case ‘collection’:  ➝ . “\n”;  break;  case ‘book’:  echo LT . $element . GT  echo ‘  ‘ . LT .  ➝ $element . GT . “\n”;  break;  Depending on the element received, the function will do different things. For  the root element, collection, the ele- ment name will be printed as a tag    , using the HTML entity versions of   stored in the con- stants. For the book elements, the same rules applied, but the tag is indented two spaces.  5. Add a case for chapter elements.  case ‘chapter’:  echo ‘    ‘ . LT . $element; foreach  $attributes as $key =>  ➝ $value  {  echo ‘ <span  ➝ class=”attribute”>’ . ➝ strtolower $key  . ‘=”<span ➝ class=”avalue”>’ . $value . ➝ ‘ ” ’;  } echo GT; break;  For the chapter element, I’ll want to loop through the $attributes array, printing each name value pair  or key value pair .  continues on next page  553  P a r s i n g X M L      6. Add a case for cover elements.  9. Script the final function.  Chapter 14  case ‘cover’:  $image = @getimagesize  ➝  $attributes[‘FILENAME’] ;  echo “<img  ➝ src=\”{$attributes[‘FILENAME’]}\” ➝ $image[3] border=\”0\”  > \n”;  break;  If the element is the cover, I’ll place the image itself in the page in lieu of refer- ring to the textual name of the element or its attributes.  7. Complete the switch and the function.  default:  echo ‘    ‘ . LT  ➝ . $element . GT;  break;  }  } The default case will apply to the title, the pages, the year, and the author. Each will be indented four spaces.  8. Write the function for handling any   closing elements. function handle_close_element  $p, ➝ $element  {  $element = strtolower $element ; if  $element == ‘book’  {  echo ‘  ‘ . LT . ‘ ’ .  ➝ $element . GT . “\n”;  } elseif  $element != ‘cover’  { echo LT . ‘ ’ . $element  ➝ . GT . “\n”;  }  } This function is more straightforward than its predecessor. All this does is send a formatted version of the tag to the browser, assuming the tag is not the closing cover tag. The book tag is indented two spaces, everything else four.  554     L M X g n i s r a P  function handle_character_data  $p, ➝ $cdata  {  echo “   ➝ $cdata ”; } The handle_character_data   function will be used for the information between the opening and closing tags. It will be printed in its own CSS class. Note that the parser does not capitalize this infor- mation as it does the element and attribute names.  10. Create a new parser and identify the  functions to use. $p = xml_parser_create  ; xml_set_element_handler  $p, ➝ ‘handle_open_element’, ➝ ‘handle_close_element’ ; xml_set_character_data_handler  $p, ➝ ‘handle_character_data’ ; 11. Read and parse the XML file.  $file = ‘books3.xml’; $fp = @fopen  $file, ‘r’  or die ➝  “Could not open a file called ➝ ‘$file’.\n \n \n” ; while  $data = fread  $fp,  ➝ filesize $file    {  xml_parse  $p, $data,  ➝ feof $fp  ; } To parse the file I first try to open it using fopen  . Then I loop through the file and send the retrieved data to the parser. The main loop stops once the entire file has been read, and the parser is told to stop once the end of the file has been reached.

Test in your Web browser  Figures 14.8  and 14.9 .  ✔ Tips    Remember when working with XML  to always use formal PHP tags  <?php and ?> . The informal PHP tags  <? and ?>  will conflict with XML tags.    There are many PEAR classes specifical-  ly for handling XML data.    For more on the Expat functions, see  www.php.net xml.    The method of parsing the XML data and displaying it in a Web site used in this example is more a demonstration than something you would do on a  live site. In all likelihood, you would  take XML data and either use XSLT  Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation  or different HTML  to display it in a nicer format.    The Expat library can read an XML   document, but it cannot validate one.  555  P a r s i n g X M L      Chapter 14  Using SimpleXML Added in PHP 5 is a great tool for working with XML documents, called SimpleXML. While not as elaborate as other DOM-based parsers, SimpleXML is terrifically easy to use, with several nice built-in features.  To start the process off, use the simplexml_ load_file   function to load an XML file into an object. $xml = simplexml_load_file ➝  ‘filename.xml’ ;  Alternatively, you could use simplexml_load_ string   if you had a bunch of XML stored in a string.  }  From there, there are many ways you could go. To refer to specific elements, you would use the format $xml->elementname. If there are multiple items of the same element, you could treat them like arrays: echo $xml->elementname[0];  Looking at the DOM in Figure 14.7, there is $xml->product[0] and $xml->product[1].  For nested elements, just continue this syntax: echo $xml->product[0]->name; echo $xml->product[1]->price;  Using a foreach loop, it’s easy to access every element in a tree: foreach  $xml->product as $product  {     Do something with:    $product->name    $product->size    etc.  Attributes are easy to access as well, by referring to them like an array: $xml->elementname[‘attribute’];  Let’s parse the books3.xml file using SimpleXML this time. Instead of just print- ing out the tags and the data, we’ll create a better-formatted Web page.     L M X g n i s r a P  556  Modifying XML  The SimpleXML library also makes it easy to modify the XML data. The addChild   and addAttribute   methods let you add new elements and attributes. You can also change the value in an element by using the assignment operator: $xml->product->name = ‘Heavy  ➝ T-Shirt’;   To use SimpleXML: 1. Create a new document in your text edi- tor or IDE, beginning with the standard HTML  Script 14.8 . <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD ➝ XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD  ➝ xhtml1-transitional.dtd”> <html xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999  ➝ xhtml” xml:lang=”en” lang=”en”>  XML and PHP     <meta http-equiv=”content-type”  ➝ content=”text html; charset=iso- ➝ 8859-1”  >   SimpleXML Parser       <?php  Script 14.8 - simplexml.php  continues on page 559  Script 14.8 The SimpleXML library provides an easy, DOM-based way to access all of the data in an XML file.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional  EN"  "http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-transitional.dtd">          SimpleXML Parser   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34      <?php  Script 14.8 - simplexml.php  This script will parse an XML file.

Read the file.  $xml = simplexml_load_file ➝  ‘books3.xml’ ; This one line is all you need to read in the entire XML document.  3. Create a loop that iterates through each  book element. foreach  $xml->book as $book  { The XML file contains several book ele- ments. With each iteration of this loop, another of the book elements will be assigned  as an object  to the $book vari- able. If the XML file is the tree shown in Figure 14.10, then $book at this point is one of the branches of the tree.  continues on next page  P a r s i n g X M L     Figure 14.10 The books XML file as a DOM tree.  559   Chapter 14  4. Print the book’s title.  echo “ $book->title”; Referring to a subelement is this easy. For the first iteration of the loop, this is the equivalent of directly referring to $xml->book[0]->title. The title will be printed within H2 tags, which are started here.  5. Print the book’s edition, if applicable.  if  isset $book->title[‘edition’]   {  echo “  Edition {$book-  ➝ >title[‘edition’]} ”; } echo “  \n”; The isset   function can be used to test if an element or attribute exists, as if it were any other variable. If the edition attribute exists, it’ll be printed in paren- theses:  Edition X . Then the title’s closing H2 tag is printed, followed by a starting P tag  all of a book’s information will be printed between one pair of para- graph tags .  6. Print the author s .  foreach  $book->author as $author  { echo “Author: $author \n”;  } Another foreach loop can iterate through all the authors. Remember that, by defi- nition in the collection.dtd file, each book element has at least one author subelement, but it can also have multiple.  7. Print the year and the page count.  echo “Published: $book->year ➝  \n”; if  isset $book->pages   {  echo “$book->pages Pages  ➝  \n”; }  560     L M X g n i s r a P  8. Begin the process of printing each   chapter. if  isset $book->chapter   {  echo ‘ ’; foreach  $book->chapter as  ➝ $chapter  { A book may or may not have any chap- ter elements in it, but could have multi- ple. The isset   checks if any exist. If so, the chapters will be printed as an unordered list. Another foreach loop will access each chapter.  9. Print the chapter information.  echo ‘ ’; if  isset $chapter[‘number’]   {  echo “Chapter   ➝ {$chapter[‘number’]}: \n”; } echo $chapter; if  isset $chapter[‘pages’]   { echo “  {$chapter[‘pages’]}  ➝ Pages \n”; } echo ‘ ’; The chapter’s name will be printed with- in LI tags. If the chapter has a number or pages attribute, that information should be printed as well.  10. Complete the chapter’s foreach loop and  conditional.  } echo ‘ ’;  }  11. Handle the book’s cover.  if  isset $book->cover   {  $image = @getimagesize   ➝  $book->cover[‘filename’] ;   Figure 14.11 The beginning of the books data, as viewed in Firefox.  Figure 14.12 The second and third book records.  XML and PHP  echo “<img src=\”{$book-  ➝ >cover[‘filename’]}\” $image[3] ➝ border=\”0\”  > \n”; } If a cover element exists, the image’s information is gathered from the file  on the server and the appropriate HTML img tag is generated.  12. Close the P tag for this book and   complete the page.  echo “ \n”;  } ?>      13. Save the file as simplexml.php, place  it in your Web directory, along with books3.xml  Script 14.4 , collection.dtd  Script 14.5 , and the php5adv.jpg image file  downloadable from the book’s Web site, www.dmcinsights.com phpvqp2 ; click Extras .  14. Test in your Web browser  Figures 14.11  and 14.12 .  ✔ Tips    The asXML   method returns the loaded  XML data as an XML string.    Because PHP treats elements and attrib- utes as objects, you’ll need to cast them to strings if you want to use them for comparison or in any standard string functions.    SimpleXML also supports XPath, a lan- guage used to perform queries  search for data  within XML.    The DOM parsers, like SimpleXML, will require more memory on the server than SAX parsers because they load the entire XML data into a variable.  561  P a r s i n g X M L      Chapter 14  Creating an RSS Feed RSS, which stands for Really Simple Syndication  it used to mean Rich Site Summary or RDF Site Summary , is a  way for Web sites to provide listings of the site’s content. Normally this list contains  at least the titles of articles, plus their descriptions  and by “article,” think of any type of content that a site might offer . Users access these feeds using an RSS client  many Web browsers support RSS,  as well . If they want to read more of an  article, there’s a link to click, which takes them to the full Web page. RSS is a great convenience and has become popular for good reasons.  RSS feeds are just XML files that have already- established tags. RSS documents begin with the rss root element, with a mandatory attribute called version. You’ll want to use the latest version of RSS for that value, which is 2.0 at this writing. So an RSS document starts with:      After that, all RSS files contain a single channel element. Nested within this ele- ment are others, like title, description, and link, all of which describe the  RSS feed.    Name of the RSS Feed   Description of the RSS ➝ Feed   Link to the Web site   Those three elements are required within channel. There are many optional ones,  too, like language  e.g., en-us , copyright, managingEditor  an email address , webMaster  also an email address , and so on. See the formal specifications at www.rssboard.org  rss-specification for more.  562        d e e F S S R n a g n i t a e r C      Figure 14.13 My supporting forums.  XML and PHP  The channel also contains multiple item ele- ments, each item being a piece of content  an article . The item elements also have title, description, link, and other nested elements.    Article Title   Article ➝ Description   Link to this article     None of the item subelements are required, except that either a title or description must be present. You might also use author  an email address  and pubDate  the article’s publication date . This last one is tricky because its value must be in the RFC 822–specified format. If you don’t know what that is offhand, it’s: Wed, 01 Nov  2006 16:45:23 GMT.  That’s really all there is to it! Remember: RSS is just formatted XML. If you understand XML, you can create RSS.  For this example, I’ll create something  that may be somewhat particular but is tremendously useful. As part of my Web site  www.DMCinsights.com , I use the Phorum software  www.phorum.org  to create a sup- port forum for readers  Figure 14.13 . Each book I’ve written has its own forum, mean- ing there are quite a few. To simplify looking through all of these forums, I want to create an RSS feed that displays the latest newly created threads across every forum, using the subject and part of the thread’s body as the title and description. If you aren’t using Phorum or don’t care about this fea- ture, you’ll only need to change a wee bit of this code to create the RSS feed you do want.  563     C r e a t i n g a n R S S F e e d         Chapter 14  To create an RSS feed: 1. Begin a new document in your text edi-  tor or IDE  Script 14.9 . <?php  Script 14.9 - forum_rss.php  Script 14.9 This PHP script uses a MySQL query to generate an RSS feed.  <?php  Script 14.9 - forum_rss.php  This script will create an RSS feed. The feed content will be recent Phorum threads.   * * *      Send the Content-type header: header 'Content-type: text xml' ;   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48     Create the initial RSS code: echo '       Larry Ullman&apos;s Recent Forum Threads   The most recent threads started in Larry&apos;s supporting book forums.   http:  www.dmcinsights.com phorum   ';     Connect to the database: $dbc = @mysql_connect  'localhost', 'username', 'password'  OR die  " \n \n" ; @mysql_select_db 'database'  or die  " \n \n" ;     Define the query:    Change this query for different sources! $q = 'SELECT message_id, forum_id, subject, LEFT body, 200 , datestamp FROM p5_messages WHERE status=2 and parent_id=0 order by datestamp desc LIMIT 50';     Retrieve the results: $r = mysql_query $q ; while  $row = mysql_fetch_array $r, MYSQL_NUM   {     Print each record as an item: echo '    ' . htmlentities $row[2]  . '   ' . htmlentities $row[3]  . '...   http:  www.dmcinsights.com phorum read.php?' . $row[1] . ',' . $row[0] . '   http:  www.dmcinsights.com phorum read.php?' . $row[1] . ',' . $row[0] . '   ' . date 'r', $row[4]  . '    ';        d e e F S S R n a g n i t a e r C     }    End of while loop     Complete the channel and rss elements: echo '    ';  ?>  564   Figure 14.14 Firefox, which supports RSS, shows the channel element’s title and description values at the top of the page.  Figure 14.15 A database connection failure still results in a valid RSS feed, but with no articles  being viewed in Safari on Mac OS X here .  XML and PHP  2. Send the Content-type header.  header ‘Content-type: text xml’ ; This page will have a .php extension, because it’s a PHP page that must be properly handled by the Web server. But to create an XML page, a header should be sent with the proper Content-type.  3. Create the initial RSS code.  echo ‘       Larry Ullman&apos;s Recent ➝ Forum Threads   The most recent threads ➝ started in Larry&apos;s supporting ➝ book forums.   http:  www.dmcinsights.com  ➝ phorum   ‘; These lines of XML get the ball rolling. To start, there’s the XML prolog, required in all XML documents. Next is the rss element and the opening channel tag. Within the channel, three tags are used to help describe this feed  Figure 14.14 .  4. Connect to the database.  $dbc = @mysql_connect  ‘localhost’, ➝ ‘username’, ‘password’  OR die ➝  “ \n \n” ; @mysql_select_db ‘database’  or die ➝  “ \n \n” ; If you want to use another database or resource for your feed  like a text file or different database application , you’ll need to change this code. If a database connection couldn’t be made, the XML page is completed, resulting in no articles in an RSS reader  Figure 14.15 .  continues on next page  565     C r e a t i n g a n R S S F e e d         Chapter 14  5. Define the query.  $q = ‘SELECT message_id, forum_id, ➝ subject, LEFT body, 200 , datestamp ➝ FROM p5_messages WHERE status=2 and ➝ parent_id=0 order by datestamp desc ➝ LIMIT 50’; Understanding this query requires a knowledge of the Phorum software and its database design. I’m selecting the message_id and forum_id values, which are used in creating the link to a thread.  I also select the thread’s subject and the first 200 characters in its body, which will be used as the title and description values in the feed. The datetime will be used for the pubDate. If you don’t want to  or can’t  follow this example exactly, just change this query to retrieve any data that’s represented  in your Web site. You could even select something from one of the other data- bases created in this book.  6. Retrieve the results.  $r = mysql_query $q ; while  $row = mysql_fetch_array $r, ➝ MYSQL_NUM   {        d e e F S S R n a g n i t a e r C     566   XML and PHP  7. Print each record as an item.  echo ‘   ’ . htmlentities $row[2]  . ➝ ‘   ’ . ➝ htmlentities $row[3]  . ➝ ‘...   http:  www.dmcinsights.com  ➝ phorum read.php?’ . $row[1] . ‘,’ . ➝ $row[0] . ‘   http:  www.dmcinsights.com  ➝ phorum read.php?’ . $row[1] . ‘,’ . ➝ $row[0] . ‘   ’ . date ‘r’, $row[4]  . ➝ ‘    ‘; This is the most important part of the whole script, where each item is generat- ed. First, you have the opening item tag. Then, there’s the title, which is the sub- ject of the forum thread and becomes the title of the article in the feed. After that is the description, which is what will be printed in the feed describing the article. For that value, I use some of the thread’s body. For both the title and the description, the retrieved value is run through the htmlentities   function because XML does not allow many char- acters that might appear. Next is the link element, which is a link to the actual “article” online. In this case, it’s a link to the thread itself in the forum. After that is an element called a guid, which isn’t required but is a good idea. This is a unique identifier for each item. The URL, which will be unique for each item, can be used here as well. Finally, there’s the pubDate, which needs to be in an exact format. Fortunately, PHP’s date   function has a shortcut for this: r. This makes the formatting a lot easier!  continues on next page 567     C r e a t i n g a n R S S F e e d         9. Complete the channel and rss elements.  Chapter 14  8.

Save the file as forum_rss.php, place  it in your Web directory, and load it in an application that supports RSS feeds  Figures 14.16 and 14.17 .  ✔ Tips    If you want to confirm that you’ve gen-  erated a valid RSS feed, check out http:  feedvalidator.org.    Because of some perceived issues with  RSS, an offshoot format called Atom was created. Meant to define a better standard for feeds, Atom is an open standard  unlike RSS, which is both closed and frozen from further develop- ment . Although Atom is worth consid- ering, many of the largest Web sites  still use RSS 2.0 for their feeds.  Figure 14.16 Viewing the RSS feed in Safari.
