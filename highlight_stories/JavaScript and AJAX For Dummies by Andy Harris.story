As he was  teaching young adults with severe disabilities, he taught himself enough com- puter programming to support his teaching habit with freelance programming.  Those were the exciting days when computers started to have hard drives,  and some computers began communicating with each other over an arcane  mechanism some were calling the Internet.  All this time Andy was teaching computer science part time. He joined the  faculty of the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Computer  Science department in 1995. He serves as a Senior Lecturer, teaching the  introductory course to freshmen as well as numerous courses on Web  development, general programming, and game programming. As manager  of the Streaming Media Laboratory, he developed a number of online video- based courses, and worked on a number of international distance education  projects including helping to start a computer science program in Tetevo,  Macedonia FYR.  Andy is the author of several other computing books including HTML,  XHTML, and CSS All-in-One Desktop Reference For Dummies, Flash Game  Programming For Dummies, and Game Programming: the L Line. He invites  your comments and questions at andy@aharrisbooks.net, You can visit  his main site and fi nd a blog, forum, and links to other books at http:   www.aharrisbooks.net.   Dedication  I dedicate this book to Jesus Christ, my personal savior, and to Heather, the  joy in my life. I also dedicate this project to Elizabeth, Matthew, Jacob, and  Benjamin. I love each of you.  Author’s Acknowledgments  Thank you fi rst to Heather. Even though I type all the words, this book is a  real partnership, like the rest of our life. Thanks for being my best friend and  companion. Thanks also for doing all the work it takes for us to sustain a  family when I’m in writing mode.  Thank you to Mark Enochs. It’s great to have an editor who gets me, and  who’s willing to get excited about a project. I really enjoy working with you.  Thanks a lot to Steve Hayes. It’s been a lot of fun to dream up this idea with  you, and to see it evolve from something a little messy to a project we can all  be proud of. I’m looking forward to working with you more.  Thank you to the copy editors: Barry Childs-Helton, Virginia Sanders, and  Rebecca Whitney. I appreciate your efforts to make my geeky mush turn into  something readable. Thanks for improving my writing.  A special thanks to Jeff Noble for his technical editing. I appreciate your vigi- lance. You have helped to make this book as technically accurate as possible.  Thank you to the many people at Wiley who contribute to a project like this.  The author only gets to meet a few people, but so many more are involved in  the process. Thank you very much for all you’ve done to help make this proj- ect a reality.  A big thank you to the open source community which has created so many  incredible tools and made them available to all. I’d especially like to thank  the creators of Firefox, Firebug, Aptana, HTML Validator, the Web Developer  toolbar, Notepad++, PHP, Apache, jQuery, and the various jQuery plugins.  This is an amazing and generous community effort.  I’d fi nally like to thank the IUPUI computer science family for years of support  on various projects. Thank you especially to all my students, current and  past. I’ve learned far more from you than the small amount I’ve taught. Thank  you for letting me be a part of your education.

Introduction  The World Wide Web officially celebrated its 20th birthday as I began writ-  ing this book. In one sense, it’s hard to believe that the technology has  been around this long already. At another level, it’s amazing how much has  happened in that short time. When I started teaching and writing about the  Internet  long before the Web was practical , none of us had any idea what it  was going to turn into one day.  If you’re reading this book, I don’t have to tell you that the Web is a big deal.  It’s come a long way, and it’s doing very interesting things. What I want to  show in this book is where the Web is going. Web technology is changing  faster than ever, and people who don’t understand these changes are going  to have a hard time staying on top of things.  In the early days of the Web, we talked about Web pages, as if the Internet  were a set of ordinary documents connected by links. This was true  and still  is largely , but I don’t think that’s the best way to think of the Web any more.  Today’s Web is not about documents, but about applications. Users and  developers expect their pages to do things, not just be glorified documents.   This book describes two critical and inter-related technologies: JavaScript  and AJAX. JavaScript has been a part of the Web since the relatively early  days. It is a simple but powerful programming language that was designed  from the beginning to work within the context of a Web document. While  JavaScript has been with us for a long time, it has recently seen a resurgence  of interest in the form of AJAX. This new technology promises a lot of cool  things, but it’s still rooted in the heritage of JavaScript and HTML.  The great thing about JavaScript and AJAX is the amount of power they give  you. If you already know HTML or XHTML, you know how to create Web doc- uments, but those documents are relatively lifeless and static.  JavaScript is a real programming language, and it allows you to add real pro- gramming capabilities to your pages. If you’ve never programmed before,  this is a great place to start. JavaScript is a pleasant and relatively easy lan- guage for beginners. It uses the familiar Web page as a user interface, which  makes it an easy way to develop forms and user interfaces. If you’re already  a programmer, you’ll find that your previous knowledge extends easily to  JavaScript, and you’ll be fluent in this skill in no time.   2  JavaScript & AJAX For Dummies   AJAX extends the capabilities of JavaScript in new ways that are still being  explored. In one sense, the AJAX libraries assist in creating great user experi- ences with new interface elements like menus and sliders. In another sense,  AJAX allows some very important features like the ability to perform client- side includes  a very handy tool for making your pages more efficient  and  direct control of server-side scripts.  If you read this entire book, you’ll be able to do amazing things with your  Web pages. You’ll be able to get input from users, test the validity of user  input, animate your pages, and interact with Web servers.   What You Will Need              One of the great things about JavaScript is how easy it is to get into. You  don’t need a whole lot to get started:  ✓ Any computer will do. If your computer is relatively recent  it can run   Firefox or Safari, for example , you have enough horsepower for Web  development. Netbooks are fine, too. Theoretically you could do Web  development on a cell phone, but I wouldn’t want to do it for long.  ✓ Any operating system is fine. I wrote this book on a combination of   Windows XP and Fedora Core Linux machines. Most of the programs I  recommend have versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.  ✓ All the best tools are free. Don’t bother purchasing any expensive soft-  ware for Web development. All the tools you need are free. You don’t  need a fancy editor like DreamWeaver or expressionWeb. While these  tools have their place, they aren’t necessary. Everything I show in this  book uses entirely free tools.  ✓ No programming experience is necessary. If you already know com-  puter programming in some other language, you’ll have no trouble with  JavaScript and AJAX. But if you have never programmed at all before,  this is a great place to start. If you’re already a programmer, JavaScript  is a pretty easy language to pick up. If not, it’s a great place to start. I’m  expecting you have some familiarity with XHTML and CSS, and you know  how to get your Web pages to a server.  See my book HTML, XHTML,  and CSS All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies if you want more infor- mation on these topics.  I’ve also added two bonus chapters to the Web  site: one on HTML and XHTML, and another on CSS. See them at www. aharrisbooks.net jad and www.dummies.com go javascript andajaxfd if you need a refresher.  So what do you need? Imagination, perseverance, and a little bit of time.    How This Book Is Organized   Introduction  3  I organized this book by renting time on a supercomputer and applying a  multilinear Bayesian artificial intelligence algorithm. No, I didn’t. I don’t even  know what that means. I really just sketched it out during a meeting when I  was supposed to be paying attention. In any case, the book is organized into  a number of sections that describe various aspects of Web development with  JavaScript and AJAX.  Like the other books in the For Dummies series, you can use this reference  in many ways, depending on what you already know and what you want to  learn. Each chapter of this book describes a particular facet of JavaScript or  AJAX programming. You can read the chapters in any order you wish, espe- cially if you already have some knowledge and you’re looking for a particular  skill. However, the chapters do build in complexity from beginning to end,  so if you find you don’t understand something in a later chapter, you might  want to review some earlier chapters.  I’ll point out exactly where you can  find things you might need as we go.  If you’re just starting out, it’s probably  easiest to go from beginning to end, but the main thing is to dig in and have  some fun.   Part I: Programming with JavaScript  If you’ve never written a computer program before, consider this your boot  camp.  But it’s kind of a fun boot camp, with a little more silliness than most —  and no pushups in the rain.  Begin by building your toolkit of powerful but free  tools and applications. Here you learn what programming is all about — with  JavaScript as the language of choice. You’ll be introduced to new friends like  variables, conditions, loops, arrays, and objects.   Part II: Using JavaScript  to Enhance Your Pages  The main reason people use JavaScript is to trick out Web pages. In this sec- tion you learn how to write programs that talk to the Web page they live in.  Your programs will be able to read user input, validate that input, and dance  around on the screen. It’s pretty fun.   4  JavaScript & AJAX For Dummies   Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   If you’ve been hanging around with Web geeks, you’ve probably heard of  AJAX. It’s kind of a big deal, and it has the potential to change the way Web  development works. Learn what this thing is really about. Create some AJAX  requests by hand, and then use the incredible jQuery library to do more pow- erful programming. Learn how jQuery introduces new ways to think about  programming, and how to use the jQuery User Interface extension to build  snappy user experiences. You’ll also learn how to work with various kinds of  data, from PHP programs to XML and JSON. Yummy.   Part IV: The Part of Tens  No Dummies book would be complete without a Part of Tens. I’m really  excited about these chapters. In one, you explore ten of my favorite jQuery  plugins. These amazing tools make it easy to add amazing features to your  sites. You’ll see plugins for automatically sorting tables, translating text into  foreign languages, building graphs, showing image galleries, playing mp3  files, and much more. Another chapter points you toward some amazing  resources on the Web to learn even more.   It’s Even on the Internet!  This book has a couple of companion Web sites that are critical to under- standing the book. Web programming is about making Web pages do things,  and you just won’t be able to see all of that in a book. As you’re going  through this book, I strongly advise you to visit either www.dummies.com  go javascriptandajaxfd or my Web site: www.aharrisbooks.net  jad. A running version of every program in the book is available on both of  these sites. You’ll also be able to view the source code of each program in its  natural habitat — running on the Web.   The www.aharrisbooks.net jad site is also a great place to start when  you’re collecting your tools and libraries. Every tool or library that I describe  in this book is linked from the Web page, so you’ll definitely want to check it  out. I also have a forum where I’m happy to answer your questions and share  projects with you. I’m looking forward to seeing you there.    Introduction  5  Icons Used in This Book  Every once in a while, a concept is important enough to warrant special  attention. This book uses a few margin icons to point out certain special  information.   These are tidbits of additional information you ought to think about or at least  keep in mind.   Occasionally I feel the need to indulge my “self-important computer science  instructor” nature, and I give some technical background on things. These  things are interesting but not critical, so you can skip them if you want. You  might want to memorize a couple of them before you go to your next com- puter science cocktail party. You’ll be the hit of the party.  Tips are suggestions to make things easier.  Be sure to read anything marked with this icon. Failure to do so might result in  a plague of frogs, puffs of black smoke, or your program not working like you  expect.              Where to Go from Here        Before you start banging out some code, let’s take stock of your needs. If  you’ve never dealt with JavaScript or AJAX, you might want to start off in  Part I. If you know JavaScript but not AJAX, skip ahead to Part IV. If you want  to brush up on your JavaScript, go to Parts II and III.   Well, just dig in and have some fun!   ✓ Skim the book. Get an overview, look at the figures, and get a sense of   the fun to be had.  ✓ Visit the Web sites. You can’t taste the recipes in a cookbook, and you   can’t get a real sense of Web programs in a computing book. Go to either  of the companion Web sites at www.aharrisbooks.net jad or www. dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd and play around with the  sample programs. Note that you will also find two bonus chapters on  HTML and CSS programming on these companion sites, as well as all the  code from the programs used throughout the book.    6  JavaScript & AJAX For Dummies            ✓ Check out the Cheat Sheet. The Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com   cheatsheet javascriptandajax is a handy reference of common  programming variables and coding miscellany.   ✓ Pick a spot and dig in. If you’re already comfortable with JavaScript   programming, take a look at Part III on AJAX. If not, you might need to  back up a little bit and find the more appropriate spot. If in doubt, you  could always go from beginning to end  but what’s the fun in that?   ✓ Have fun. Programming is a serious business. You can actually make a  living doing this stuff. But it’s also a lot of fun. Have a good time, relax,  and enjoy making your Web pages do things you never thought they  could do.  A Final Word  Thank you for buying this book. I truly hope you find it fun and useful. I had  a great time writing this book, and I think you’ll have a good time using it.  I’m looking forward to hearing from you and seeing what you can do with the  skills you pick up here. Drop me a line at andy@aharrisbooks.net and let  me know how it’s going!   Part I  Programming with   JavaScript   In this part . . .  You enter the world of JavaScript programming. The   kind of programming you learn in this part is suit- able for any kind of language. You’ll be able to translate  these ideas to any major language without difficulty. Of  course, the examples and emphasis are in JavaScript.  Chapter 1 helps you gather your tools. Most of the tools  you need for professional JavaScript program are com- pletely free. Learn what you need in terms of editors,  browsers, and plugins.  Chapter 2 gets you started in JavaScript. You’ll store data  in variables, work with text data, and do some basic input  and output.  Chapter 3 takes you into the wonderful world of decision  making. You’ll learn how to generate random numbers  and then use them to experiment with several decision- making mechanisms. Your programs will make decisions  like the best of them.  Chapter 4 introduces the powerful idea of loops. Your pro- grams will be able to repeat as many times as you want,  and will stop on a dime. Loops can also cause difficult-to- spot logic problems, so this chapter also describes a num- ber of debugging techniques.  Chapter 5 helps you build more powerful programs by  combining elements. You can combine variables to make  arrays, and you can combine statements to make func- tions. You also learn how to combine both instructions  and data to make objects, including the powerful JSON  object.   Chapter 1   Taking the Web to the Next Level  In This Chapter ▶ Reviewing HTML, XHTML, and CSS ▶ Examining the role of JavaScript and AJAX ▶ Exploring what JavaScript and AJAX can add to Web pages ▶ Choosing an editor ▶ Building your browser toolkit  The Web is a pretty big deal. It’s a lot of fun to build Web pages, and just   about every business needs them. As the Web has grown and changed,  the expectations of what a Web page is and does have also changed. If you  already know HTML or XHTML, you know how to create Web documents — if  you need a refresher, check out Bonus Chapter 1 on either the companion  Web site at www.dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd or my own site  at www.aharrisbooks.net jad.   As the Web has evolved so have the tools that are used to create Web pages  and documents. JavaScript and AJAX are two powerful tools for creating  dynamic Web documents. This chapter gets you started with a look at some  of the primary technologies out there for building Web pages.  Building Something Cool  This book is about adding features to Web pages that you cannot do with  simple HTML and CSS.  Make no mistake; we’re talking about programming here — and programming  is a little bit harder than plain old Web development. However, it’s really  worth it, as the example page in Figure 1-1 illustrates.   To keep this example simple, I’m using some external libraries. They are  explained in Part IV of this book, but for now just appreciate that something  exciting is happening here.       10 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   The text in this box changes.  Figure 1-1:  This page  has some  interesting  features  that would  not be pos- sible in  basic HTML.             This program requires you to have an active Internet connection to work cor- rectly. Check Chapter 10 to see some alternatives for connecting to external  libraries.  If you want to see this page in action  and you really should , please go to the  companion Web sites for this book: www.aharrisbooks.net jad or www. dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd. This program and every other  program and example in the book are available at that site.      At first, the Web page looks pretty simple, but when you open it in your own  browser  as you should  and begin playing with it, you’ll soon discover that it  packs a lot of surprises. This very simple page illustrates a lot of the reasons  why you should learn JavaScript and AJAX.  ✓ The buttons do something. You might already have a handle on creat- ing form elements  such as buttons and text fields  in plain HTML, but  HTML can’t do anything with the buttons and text fields; that’s why you  need a programming language.   If you want something interesting to happen, you need a programming  language. Each of these buttons uses JavaScript to do some interesting     Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  11           work, but the fact that the page is now interactive is a huge change. With  JavaScript, you can build applications, not just pages.  ✓ The Count button dynamically changes the page. When you click the   Count button, new content is added to the page automatically. A pro- gram counts how many times the Count button is pressed and adds text  to the “watch this space” section. As the user interacts with the page,  the page has material that wasn’t originally on the server.   Of course, this example is simple, but you will be able to add any kind of  text to any Web element dynamically. That’s a very powerful capability.  Figure 1-2 shows how the page looks after I click the Count button a few  times.  ✓ The Toggle Visibility button makes things appear and disappear. You  can’t really modify whether things appear or go away in HTML. You can  do so in CSS to some level, but JavaScript gives you a much more power- ful set of tools for changing what parts of the page are visible to the user  at any time. Look at Figure 1-3 to see the page with the output segment  hidden.   The Count button  A new line is added to this section each   time the user clicks the Count button.  Figure 1-2:  The Count  button  changes the  text in part  of the page.        12 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   I clicked the Toggle Visibility button, and the output disappeared.  Figure 1-3:  Click the  Toggle  Visibility  button to  make the  panel with  the output  reappear.                ✓ The Toggle Style button instantly changes the appearance of part of   the page. You can use JavaScript to change the contents of any part  of the page  that is, the HTML  — but you can also use JavaScript to  modify the appearance  the CSS  in real time. In this example, I’ve cre- ated a special CSS class called funky that is added to or removed from  the output box every time the user clicks the button. This approach  works with any CSS class.  Amazing, huh?  Figure 1-4 shows the page  with the funky class applied. If you need a refresher on CSS or XHTML, please look over the bonus  chapters on the Web site: www.dummies.com go javascriptand ajaxfd or www.aharrisbooks.net jad. I’ve added callouts to some of the figures in this chapter to describe  what’s happening. The images in this book are not sufficient to under- stand what the page does. Find the program at www.dummies.com go  javascriptandajaxfd or www.aharrisbooks.net jad and look at  it yourself.        ✓ The Animate button is even more fun. The Animate button makes a  series of gradual changes to the output box, changing its size, shape,  and appearance over time.  You’ve really got to try it; a screen shot  won’t do it justice.         Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  13  The Toggle Style button  Figure 1-4:  You can  dynamically  change the  appearance  of any page  element.              ✓ The Show Code button brings in text from an external file. This button   uses a simple form of AJAX to load an external file into the page in real  time. This is an easy way to build modular pages. In this case, I’m actu- ally pulling in a copy of the JavaScript code so you can see how it works.  Don’t worry if you don’t understand it yet. That’s what this book is for!  Figure 1-5 shows this operation in action.  ✓ Let the user drag the code. The user can pick up the code and move it  wherever she wants. This is another kind of functionality unheard of in  ordinary Web pages.   No, you wouldn’t normally display your code to users. I’m just illustrating that  it’s pretty easy to pull in an arbitrary text file from a server. Since you are a  programmer now, I chose to show you a preview of the code as the text file I  brought in.  These capabilities are profound, and they’re just the beginning. Learning to  program transforms your Web pages from static documents to living applica- tions that can interact with your users in new and exciting ways.   Feel free to look over the code for this project. It’s actually in three files:  demo.html, demo.css, and demo.js. All can be found in the Chapter 1  folder of the book’s companion Web site. Use View Source when the page is  displayed in your browser to see the source code of the HTML file.         14 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Click to see the code from another file.  Figure 1-5:  The Show  Code but- ton pulls  code from  another file  and shows it  on-screen.        I’ve added plenty of comments in the code to help you see what’s going on,  but it’s okay if you don’t have all the intricacies nailed down yet. Think of this  as a preview of things you’ll get to do in this book.  Getting Started  Making your pages do all this stuff looks like fun, and it is. There’s a lot to get  under your belt, but don’t panic; I take you through everything. The first step  is to review the core technologies that JavaScript and AJAX are based on, and  see how they’re related to some other  more advanced  technologies you’ll  eventually need.   Overview of the Core Technologies  Powerful as they are, JavaScript and AJAX do not stand on their own. They  only have meaning in the context of Web pages, so they rely on various Web  technologies. If you want to build a JavaScript application, you’ll need several  other technologies, too:    Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  15                       ✓ HTML: HTML  HyperText Markup Language  is the basic markup lan- guage that describes Web pages. It’s a relatively simple technique for  building Web sites that requires nothing but a plain text editor.  ✓ XHTML: XHTML is often considered the successor to HTML. Because it   doesn’t allow certain kinds of tags, XHTML is actually a smaller language  that’s a bit easier to use. Typically XHTML pages are more dependent on  CSS than HTML, as many of the HTML tags are replaced with CSS tools. ✓ CSS: CSS  Cascading Style Sheets  is a way to add specific style informa- tion to an HTML or XHTML page. HTML and XHTML provide the general  framework, and CSS describes the color and layout.   ✓ JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language embedded in all  modern Web browsers. It’s specially designed to interact with Web  pages; you can use it to extract information from parts of a page, and to  manipulate the page in real time.  ✓ AJAX:  Asynchronous JavaScript And XML  is a technique that allows   JavaScript to communicate more directly with the Web server. It creates  an interesting new relationship between the Web browser and the Web  server. About half of this book is dedicated to AJAX.  ✓ PHP:  PHP Hypertext Preprocessor  is one of several important lan-  guages for working on a Web server. Although it’s not a primary focus  of this book, the PHP language can do things that JavaScript cannot do.  AJAX is frequently used to connect JavaScript applications to PHP pro- grams. You get a brief introduction to PHP in Chapter 14.  ✓ Java: Java is a language that’s entirely different from JavaScript  despite  the similar names . Although Java is useful on both the client and server  sides of the client-server relationship, it’s not a primary focus of this book.  When you’re looking for online help about JavaScript, be sure that you talk to  JavaScript experts and not Java programmers. Although the languages have  similar names, they’re entirely different languages. Java programmers love  to act superior, and they’ll give you grief if you ask a JavaScript question in a  Java forum. If in doubt, ask on my Web site  www.aharrisbooks.net . I can  help you with either language, and I won’t mind  or bug you about it  if you’re  a little confused.     Choosing your computer  Of course, you’ll need a computer. Fortunately, it doesn’t have to be anything  special. Any computer you can use to view Web pages can also be used to  create them. Any of the major operating systems  Windows, Mac, and Linux   is perfectly fine. I do most of my work on a combination of Linux  Fedora  Core  and Windows XP, but all the programs in the book will work exactly the  same on any reasonably modern computer.   16 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   At some point you’ll want your Web pages to be available on the Internet.  Although you can install a server on your home computer, it’s usually better  to use an online hosting service. You can often get very good online hosting  very cheaply or even free. If you want to have a specific name attached to  your Web site  such as www.mySite.com , then you’ll need to pay about  $10 a year to register the domain. Hosting services frequently use Linux, but  you’ll probably use an online interface that hides all the details from you.  The right tools make any job easier, but for Web development, many of the  really great software tools are available entirely free of charge. Because these  tools are open source  available with a license that encourages distribution ,  they are entirely legal to use without paying for them, unlike commercial pro- grams obtained using illicit methods.  You can do basic Web development on any computer with a text editor and  browser. As your Web-tweaking skills get more sophisticated, you might want  more powerful tools. Read on to see some great tools that cost absolutely  nothing.  Picking an Editor  Web pages, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are all ultimately forms of text. You  don’t really need any particular program to write them. Still, having exactly  the right tool can make your life a lot easier. Since you’re going to spend a lot  of time with your Web tools, you should be aware of your options.  Avoiding the problem tools  Using the wrong tool for the job can really make your life difficult. Here are a  few tools that don’t really stand up to the job of Web development:  ✓ Microsoft Word: Word processors are great  I’m using one to write this   book , but they aren’t really designed for creating Web pages. Word   and all other word processors  store lots of information in their files  besides plain text. All the formatting stuff is great for non-Web docu- ments, but HTML and CSS have their own ways of managing this data,  and the other stuff gets in the way. Even the Save as HTML command  is problematic. Although it stores the page in a form of HTML, Word’s  formatting is extremely clunky and difficult to work with. The resulting  pages will not be suitable for adapting to JavaScript.  ✓ Notepad: This is the classic tool built into most versions of Windows. It  saves pages in plain text, so it’s better than Word for Web development,  but Notepad is too simplistic for any sort of serious work. It lacks such           Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  17                 basic features as line numbers — and it can’t handle multiple documents  at once. You’ll quickly outgrow Notepad as a Web-development tool. ✓ TextEdit: The default text editor on the Mac is a very powerful tool,   but it’s more like a word processor than what I’d call a true text editor.  When you save an HTML file in TextEdit, it’s usually not stored the way  you need it to: Rather than seeing the results of the code, you’ll see the  code itself. If you want to use TextEdit for HTML or JavaScript, make  sure you choose Format➪Make Plain Text before saving your file.  ✓ Graphics editors: Some high-end graphics editors like Adobe   Photoshop, Adobe Fireworks, and Gimp also have the ability to export  to HTML, but the code they produce is not easy to work with. It’s really  better to use these programs to edit your graphics and use a dedicated  text editor to handle your code.   Using a WYSIWYG editor  The promise of WYSIWYG  “what you see is what you get”  editing is very  alluring. Word-processing programs have had this capability for years. As  you edit a document on-screen, you can see in real time exactly how it will  look on paper. A number of tools promise this kind of functionality for Web  pages: Adobe Dreamweaver is the most popular, followed by Microsoft  FrontPage and its replacement ExpressionWeb. Although these tools are  popular for traditional Web development, they have some drawbacks when it  comes to the kind of interactive work we do in this book:  ✓ WYSIWYG is a lie. The whole assumption of WYSIWYG works fine when  the output is a paper document printed on a printer. You can predict how  the output will work. Web pages are different, because the output shows  up on a display that belongs to somebody else. You don’t know what  size it will be, what colors it will support, or what fonts are installed.  You also don’t know which browser the user will be viewing pages with,  which can make a major difference in the output of the page.  ✓ The editor hides details you need. A visual editor tries to protect you  from some of the details of Web development. That’s fine at first, but at  some point you’ll need that level of control. Most professionals who use  Dreamweaver spend most of their time in Code view, ignoring the advan- tages of a visual editor. Why pay for features you’re going to ignore?   ✓ Visual editors assume static documents. A visual editor is based on the   idea that a Web page is an ordinary document. The kinds of pages we  build in this book are much more than that. You will  for example  be  writing code that creates and modifies Web documents on the fly. You  need to know how to build Web documents by hand so you can write  code that builds them and changes them dynamically.   18 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Introducing programmer’s editors  A number of specialty editors have propped up which seek to fill the gap  between plain-text editors and the WYSIWYG tools. These editors write in  plain text, but they have additional features for programmers, including:  ✓ Awareness of languages: Programmer’s editors often know what lan-  guage you’re writing in and can adapt, helping you whether you’re writ- ing HTML, JavaScript, or CSS code. Most general-purpose programmer’s  editors can handle all these languages natively, and often can help with  many more languages.   ✓ Syntax highlighting: Various elements are colored in different ways so   you can see what is in plain text, what is part of an HTML tag, and so on.  This simple feature can make it much easier to find problems like miss- ing quotes, and to see the general structure of your page quickly.  ✓ Syntax support: Programmer’s editors often provide some sort of help  for remembering the syntax of your language. This boost can be in the  form of buttons and macros for handling common code, pre-written tem- plates for standard layouts and patterns, and syntax completion  which  looks at what you’re typing and suggests completions based on the cur- rent language you’re using .  ✓ Multiple document support: Advanced Web applications often involve   editing several different documents at once. You might have a dozen  Web pages with a few CSS style sheets and an external JavaScript file or  two. A programmer’s editor allows you to view and edit all these files  simultaneously. Many also allow you to generate a project file so you can  save all the related files automatically and load them in one batch.  ✓ Macro tools: Programming often requires repetitive typing tasks. Having  a feature that records and plays back sequences of keystrokes as macros   short automated operations  can be incredibly helpful.  ✓ Debugging and preview support: Most programmer’s editors have a   tool for previewing your code in a browser  or sometimes directly in the  editor . The editors also often have tools for predicting certain errors,  or responding to errors when they occur. At a minimum, you need the  capability to jump directly to a particular line or section of your code. ✓ Indentation support: Most programmers use indentation as a power- ful tool to help them understand the structure of the Web documents  they’re building. A good editor can assist you with this indentation and  also help you recognize when you’ve made mistakes in the structure of  your document.                         Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  19  Getting familiar with some  important editors  A couple of multi-purpose programmer’s editors immediately come to mind.  You should consider investigating one or more of these free programs:  ✓ vi and emacs: These are the granddaddies of all text editors. Both are  very common on Unix Linux environments. They are also available for  Windows and Mac. Though extremely capable editors, vi and emacs  were developed at a time when modern ideas about usability weren’t  practical. If you already know how to use one of these tools, by all  means investigate a modern variant.  Frankly, I still use emacs as my  primary text editor, though I don’t know if I’d learn it today with all the  easier options out there.  Figure 1-6 shows a Web page being edited  with emacs.  Clean interface without buttons or gadgets  You can have many files open at once or look at two spots in the same file.        Figure 1-6:  Emacs isn’t  pretty, but  it’s very  powerful.  Use it for  extra geek  points.     20 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   ✓ notepad++: This is what Notepad for Windows should be. It starts with  the speed and simplicity of Windows Notepad, but adds tons of features  for programmers. I especially like the built-in support for page valida- tion. This is one of the few programs to earn a permanent shortcut on  my desktop. Unfortunately, it’s only for Windows. Figure 1-7 shows the  same page being edited in notepad++.  ✓ Bluefish: The Bluefish text editor is rapidly becoming a favorite tool   for Web developers. It’s quick and powerful, and it has plenty of great  features for Web developers. One especially powerful tool is the CSS  generator, which helps you develop style sheets with a menu system so  you don’t have to memorize any syntax. It also has a great generator for  default templates, which makes XHTML-strict Web pages much easier  to build. Bluefish is available for all major platforms  for the Windows  version, you’ll also need to install the free GTK library . You can see  Bluefish running in Figure 1-8.   Extensive set of commands and tools for text editing  Support for multiple documents           Figure 1-7:  You’ll find  notepad++  a very  powerful  alternative  to Notepad.    Automatic syntax highlighting in dozen of languages    Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  21  Figure 1-8:  Bluefish is  a very nice  editor for  XHTML and  JavaScript.             ✓ jEdit: This powerful editor is written in Java, so it is available on virtu-  ally every platform. It is a very powerful editor in its basic format, but its  best feature is the extensive plugin library that allows you to customize  it to your own needs. If you install the free XML library, jEdit has incredi- ble support for HTML and XHTML. Figure 1-9 shows the sample program  being edited in jEdit.  ✓ codetch: This editor is unique because rather than being a standalone  editor, it is actually an extension for the popular Firefox browser. It has  most of the same features as the other editors, with the convenience  of being already a part of your browser. It is not quite as configurable  as some of the other tools, but it’s still extremely handy. You can see  codetch in action in Figure 1-10.   22 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Figure 1-9:  jEdit is a fast  and capable  editor writ- ten in Java.       Figure 1-10:  The codetch  plugin for  Firefox is a  complete  Web editor.         Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  23                 Introducing Aptana  One particular programmer’s editor has really taken over the Web develop- ment world in recent years. Aptana is a full-featured programmer’s editor  based on the powerful and popular Eclipse editor for Java programming.  Aptana has a lot to recommend:  ✓ Extensive built-in support for Web languages: Aptana comes out of the   box with support for HTML XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX.   ✓ Syntax highlighting: Most programmer’s editors have syntax highlight- ing, but Aptana is especially capable in this area. Sometimes you’ll have  the same physical document with three or more different languages  active, and Aptana can usually sense by context whether you’re writing  CSS, XHTML, or JavaScript code.  ✓ Code completion: This is one of Aptana’s most impressive features.   When you start writing a line of code, Aptana will pop up a menu of sug- gestions. This helps you avoid mistakes, so you don’t have to memorize  all the various CSS attributes and JavaScript commands exactly.  ✓ Error detection: Aptana can look over your document as you create it  and highlight some areas in real time. This feature can help you write  better code, and can also help hone your skills at writing code.  ✓ AJAX support: AJAX is a relatively new technology, and most editors do   not directly support it. Aptana has a number of features that help you  with AJAX, including built-in support of all the major AJAX libraries.  Aptana is completely free. I’ve placed a link to Aptana  and indeed all the  tools mentioned here  on the Web site for this book. You can see Aptana in  action in Figure 1-11.  My personal setup varies from machine to machine, but generally I use  Aptana for my heavy programming, with notepad++ as a quick editor on  Windows, and emacs as my primary basic text editor on Linux or Mac  machines. Of course, you’ll develop your own preferences as you go. All  these editors are free and available at www.aharrisbooks.net jad, so  they’re worthy of some experimentation.   24 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Automatic syntax highlighting and code completion  Multiple document support  Figure 1-11:  Aptana  might be the  best Web  editor avail- able at any  price.       Intergrated file management tool  Console area for debugging and error messages  Automatically generated map showing the main sections of a page or program  Creating Your Browser Collection  Web pages live within the context of Web browsers. Each browser interprets  HTML and CSS a bit differently, and the differences are magnified when you  start talking about JavaScript and AJAX. Subtle  and sometimes not-so-subtle   differences in the way browsers support your code can be very important.   Setting the standard  Every Web browser has its own particular way of displaying Web pages.  Although those ways are pretty similar, the differences can sometimes be a  problem. Worse, as you begin to write JavaScript code, you’ll find that each  browser has its own interpretation of the code. That can be a real mess.     Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  25        Fortunately, there’s been a big push toward standardization in recent years.  The various browser developers have been getting together and agreeing to  various standards set forth by a centralized team called the World Wide Web  Consortium  W3C . When a browser implements JavaScript, it now agrees   theoretically, at least  to adhere to a set of standards for behavior. As long  as your code follows the same standards, you can expect everything to work  pretty well.  Most of the time, anyway.   In this book, I adhere to accepted JavaScript standards as practiced by most  developers. All the code in this book is tested on IE7 for Windows, Firefox 3 for  Windows, and Firefox 3 for Linux. Any time the code is likely to cause particu- lar browser problems, I try to point out the specific issues.  Picking a browser or two  Here are a few browsers you should be aware of:  ✓ Legacy browsers: You’ll find a lot of older browsers still being used  on the Internet. Some people have continued to stick with whatever  browser was on their machine when they got it, and haven’t upgraded in  years. The browsers earlier than IE6 or Firefox are a particular problem,  because support for Web standards and for JavaScript was very uneven  in the early days of the Web. For the most part, this book assumes that  your users will be using at least a somewhat modern browser.  AJAX in particular won’t work on really old browsers.     ✓ Microsoft Internet Explorer 6: This is a very common browser, still in  popular use. At one point it was the dominant browser on the Internet,  but it has fallen from favor in recent years, being replaced by newer  offerings from Microsoft as well as competitors like Firefox and Opera.  This browser is well-known for a number of “features” that don’t comply  with community standards. Its use is declining, but as of this writing,  you still have to consider supporting it; a lot of users still have it. ✓ Firefox: The Firefox Web browser from Mozilla reopened the so-  called “browser wars” by providing the first significant competition to  Microsoft in many years. Firefox really opened eyes with its impressive  features: tabbed browsing, improved security, and integrated searching.  For developers, Firefox was among the first browsers to truly support  Web standards in a serious way. Firefox is especially important to devel- opers because of its extension architecture, which allows a programmer  to turn Firefox into a high-powered development tool. Look at the next  section of this chapter for suggestions on some great extensions to add  to Firefox.            26 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                  ✓ Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 and 8: IE7 could be considered a tribute  to Firefox, as it incorporates many of the same features. While this book  was being written, IE8 came out, and added a few more improvements.  Although the support for standards is not as complete in IE7 and IE8 as  it is in some of the other current fleet of browsers, they are much better  than in any earlier versions of IE.   ✓ Opera: Opera is an important browser because it was one of the earliest  browsers to actively support Web standards. It’s very popular in certain  circles, but has never gained widespread popularity. Since it supports  Web standards, it will typically run any code written for a standards- compliant browser.  ✓ Safari: Safari is the Web browser packaged with Mac OS. It is a very   capable standards-compliant browser. There is now a Windows version  available. The Web browser built into iPhones uses the same engine as  Safari, so this is an important consideration if you’re building applica- tions for mobile devices.  ✓ Chrome: This newer browser was created by Google. It is highly  standards-compliant, and it’s especially powerful at handling Java Script and AJAX. This is not surprising, considering Google is one of  the companies that pioneered the use of AJAX and is actively promot- ing its use. Chrome has one of the fastest JavaScript interpreters in  common use.  ✓ Other browsers: There are many other browsers in use today, including   specialty browsers on various forms of Linux, cell phones, and PDAs.  It is nearly impossible to support them all, but many browsers now at  least try to support Web standards.  I prefer to do most of my testing with Firefox 3, because it has very good  standards support and an excellent set of tools for improving and debugging  your code. I then check my pages on other browsers including IE6, IE7, and  Chrome.      Turning Firefox into a Development  Machine  Firefox is an especially important browser for Web developers. It has a  number of attractive features including its excellent standards support in  HTML and JavaScript. However, the most important advantage of Firefox  as a developer’s tool might be its support for extensions. Many commercial  browsers keep their code a closely guarded secret, and are very difficult     Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  27                 to extend. Firefox was designed from the beginning to have its capabilities  extended — and a number of very clever programmers have added incredible  extensions to the tool. A few of these extensions have become “must haves”  for Web developers:  Web Developer Toolbar   The Web Developer Toolbar by Chris Pederick is an incredible tool. It adds a  new toolbar to Firefox with a number of extremely useful capabilities:  ✓ Edit CSS: You can pop up a small window and type in CSS code. The CSS   will take effect immediately in real time, so you can see exactly what  effect your CSS has on the view of the page.  ✓ Display Ruler: This incredibly handy tool allows you to draw a ruler on   your page to see exactly how large various elements are. This is really  useful for debugging Web layouts.  ✓ Outline tables: This tool helps you make sense of table-based layouts.   It’s a good way to see how a complex table-based design is created.  It’s best to avoid table-based layout, but sometimes you have to look at  somebody else’s pages.        ✓ Resize menu: The Resize menu lets you see how your page looks in a  number of other standard sizes. This can be very useful when you’re  designing a layout.  ✓ Validation tools: Web Developer includes a number of really handy   tools for validating your Web pages. It includes links for validating HTML  and CSS, as well as the primary accessibility standards.  HTML Validator extension  This incredible extension brings the same validation engine used by the W3C  to your browser. It gives quick feedback on the validity of any page you view.  It also adds much more information to Firefox’s View Source page, including  feedback on exactly which validation errors you have.  Validation informa- tion is not provided by the normal View Source page.  The hints for fixing the  errors are actually helpful, and there’s also a tool for automatically repairing  the code with the excellent HTML Tidy program. HTML is the foundation for  your JavaScript code, and invalid HTML provides a faulty framework. With  the HTML Validator, there’s no reason to have invalid pages. Figure 1-12  shows the improved View Source window with the warnings tab and the but- tons for fixing the code with HTML Tidy.   28 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   View Source window  Figure 1-12:  The HTML  Validator  extension  adds very  useful  features to  the View  Source tool.                Validator errors appear in this window.  The Validor extension provides helpful error messages.  Firebug  The Firebug extension is one of the most important tools in Web develop- ment. It turns Firefox into a complete debugging tool. Firebug has several  especially useful features:  ✓ Inspect Window: This incredible tool allows you to move your mouse  over any element in your page and instantly see the code that created  that section in another panel. This is a very easy way to analyze and  debug pages. You can also see instantly what CSS applies to a particular  snippet of code, and highlight code to see the corresponding output.  ✓ CSS View and Edit: You can look over the CSS of your page in a panel,  see previews of any colors, and edit the values. You’ll see the results in  real time on the page.   ✓ JavaScript Debugging: Even pros make mistakes — and up to now, few  debugger tools have been available for JavaScript programmers. Firebug  has better mechanisms for error-trapping than the browsers do, and it     Chapter 1: Taking the Web to the Next Level  29  also incorporates a very nice debugger that can really help you find your  errors as your program runs.  ✓ AJAX monitoring: AJAX programming is based on a series of requests   back and forth from the server. Firebug helps you to keep track of these  requests and watch your data move.  ✓ Live code view: The ordinary view source menu of most browsers  helps you see the code as it originally comes from the browser. In  JavaScript programming, you’re often changing the page code on the fly.  Firebug shows you the page as it really is, even if it’s being changed by  JavaScript. This is a very useful facility.  ✓ Firebug lite: This is a variation of firebug that works in IE and other   browsers. This adds most of the power of firebug to any browser.   Figure 1-13 shows Firebug in inspect mode. As the user moves over a piece of  the page, the related code segment appears in the code window.              Figure 1-13:  Firebug  being used  to inspect a  Web page.    The inspect mode lets you highlight the page and see the relevant code.  View and edit HTML, CSS, or JavaScript  View the CSS or DOM info for the  currently selected window.   30 Part I: Programming with JavaScript    Chapter 2  Writing Your First Program  In This Chapter ▶ Adding JavaScript code to your pages ▶ Setting up your environment for JavaScript ▶ Creating variables ▶ Input and output with modal dialog boxes ▶ Using concatenation to build text data ▶ Understanding basic data types ▶ Using string methods and properties ▶ Using conversion functions  Web pages begin with XHTML code. This basic code provides the   framework. CSS adds decoration to the basic structure, but to make   your pages literally sing and dance, you’ll need to learn a programming  language.  The JavaScript language is a very popular first language, because it’s  designed to interact with Web pages, and it’s already built into most Web  browsers. It’s reasonably easy to learn, and it’s very powerful.  The whole idea of learning a programming language might seem intimidating,  but don’t worry. Programming isn’t really that hard. I show you exactly how  to get started in this chapter. You’ll be coding like a pro in a very short time.  Becoming a Programmer  JavaScript is a programming language first developed by Netscape commu- nications. It is now standard on nearly every browser. There are a few things  you should know about JavaScript right away:   32 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                  ✓ It’s a real programming language. Sometimes people who program in  other languages such as C++ and VB.NET scoff at JavaScript and claim  it’s not a “real” programming language because it lacks some features.  These features  particularly the ability to communicate with the local  file system  were left out on purpose to keep JavaScript safe.  You’re  introduced to some AJAX alternatives that provide access to these fea- tures in the last half of this book.  JavaScript is a real language, and it’s a  very good place to start programming.  ✓ It’s not Java. There is another popular programming language called   Java  without the script part , which is also used for Web program- ming. JavaScript and Java are completely different languages  despite  the similar names . Make sure you don’t go onto a Java forum and start  asking JavaScript questions. Those Java programmers can be kind of  snooty and superior.  They shouldn’t be; I program in Java, too. It’s  just a language.   ✓ It’s a scripting language. JavaScript is a pretty easy language to get to  know. It isn’t nearly as strict as certain other languages  I’m looking at  you, Java , and it has a relatively relaxed view of things  for one, it’s less  demanding about exactly what sort of data goes where . This lets you  concentrate more on trying to solve your problem than worrying about  exactly how your code is written. It’s still a programming language, so  there are a few rules you must obey, but scripting languages such as  JavaScript tend to be much more forgiving to beginners than the big  monster languages.  Choosing a JavaScript editor  JavaScript  like XHTML and CSS  is really just text. You can modify your  JavaScript code in the same editor you use for XHTML and CSS. If you used  Aptana before  mentioned in Chapter 1  and liked it, you’re going to love the  editor now. Of course, you can continue to use another editor if you prefer.  JavaScript is an entirely different language and uses a different syntax than  HTML and CSS. It isn’t hard to learn, but there’s a lot to learn in any true pro- gramming language. Aptana has a number of really great features that help  you tremendously when writing JavaScript code:  ✓ Syntax highlighting: Just like HTML and CSS, Aptana automatically   adjusts code colors to help you see what’s going on in your program. As  you see later in this chapter, this can be a big benefit when things get  complicated.  ✓ Code completion: When you type in the name of an object, Aptana pro- vides you with a list of possible completions. This can be really helpful,  so you don’t have to memorize all the details of the various functions  and commands.    Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  33           ✓ Help files: The My Aptana page  available from the File menu if you’ve   dismissed it  has links to really great help pages for HTML, CSS, and  JavaScript. The documentation is actually easier to read than some of  what you’ll find on the Web.  ✓ Integrated help: Hover the mouse pointer over a JavaScript command  or method and a nifty little text box pops up, explaining exactly how it  works. Often the box includes an example or two.  ✓ Error warnings: When Aptana can tell something is going wrong, it tries   to give you an error message and places a red squiggly line  like the  ones spellcheckers use  under the suspect code.  I’m unaware of a better JavaScript editor at any price, and Aptana is free, so  there’s just not a good reason to use anything else. Of course, you can use  any text editor you like if you don’t want or need these features.  There’s one strange characteristic I’ve noticed in Aptana: The Preview tab  isn’t as reliable a technique for checking JavaScript code as it is for XHTML  and CSS. I find it better to run the code directly in my browser or use the Run  button to have Aptana run it in the external browser for me.   Picking your test browser  In addition to your editor, you should carefully choose your browser based  on how it works when you’re testing JavaScript code.   All the major browsers support JavaScript, and it works relatively similarly  across the browsers  at least until things get a bit more advanced . However,  all browsers are not equal when it comes to testing your code.  Things will go wrong when you write JavaScript code, and the browser is  responsible for telling you what went wrong. Firefox is way ahead of IE when  it comes to reporting errors. Firefox errors are much easier to read and under- stand, and Firefox supports a feature called the JavaScript console  described  in Chapter 4  that makes it much easier to see what’s going on. If at all pos- sible, use Firefox to test your code, and then check for discrepancies in IE.  Chapter 4 gives you more about finding and fixing errors — and some great  tools in Firefox and Aptana to make this important job easier.  That’s enough preliminaries. Pull out your editor, and start writing a real  program. It’s simple enough to get started. The foundation of any JavaScript  program is a standard Web page.         34 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Adding a script to your page  The context of JavaScript programs is Web pages, so begin your JavaScript  journey by adding some content to a basic Web page. If you aren’t familiar  with XHTML or CSS  the languages used for basic Web development , please  review the bonus chapters available on either of the two Web sites dedicated  to this book  www.dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd or www. aharrisbooks.net jad , or look into a more complete reference like  HTML, XHTML, and CSS All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies  Wiley .  It’s pretty easy to add JavaScript code to your pages. Figure 2-1 shows the  classic first program in any computer language.  This page has a very simple JavaScript program in it that pops up the phrase  “Hello, World!” in a special element called a dialog box. It’s pretty cool.  Here’s an overview of the code, and then I’ll explain all the details step by step.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       HelloWorld.html                <![CDATA[            Hello, world!         alert «Hello, World!» ;         ]]>                          As you can see, there’s nothing in the HTML body in this page at all. You can   and will  incorporate JavaScript with XHTML content later. For now, though,  you can simply place JavaScript code in the head area of your Web page in a  special tag and make it work.     Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  35  Hello, World?  There’s  a  long  tradition  in  programming  lan- guages that your first program in any language  should simply say “Hello, World!” and do noth- ing else. There’s actually a very good practical  reason for this habit. Hello World is the simplest  possible program you can write that you can  prove works. Hello World programs are used to   help you figure out the mechanics of the pro- gramming environment — how the program is  written, what special steps you have to do to  make the code run, and how it works. There’s  no point in making a more complicated program  until you know you can get code to pop up and  say hi.  Figure 2-1:  A  JavaScript  program  caused  this little  dialog box  to pop up!       Embedding your JavaScript code  JavaScript code is placed in your Web page via the   tag. JavaScript  code is placed inside the    pair. The   tag  has one required attribute, type, which will usually be text javascript.   Other types are possible, but they are rarely used.   The other funny thing in the code in the previous section is that crazy CDATA  stuff. Immediately inside the   tag, the next line is    36 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   This bizarre line is a special marker explaining that the following code is  character information, and shouldn’t be interpreted as XHTML. The end of  the script finishes off the character data marker with this code:    <![CDATA[    ]]>  In modern browsers, it’s a good idea to mark off your JavaScript code as  character data. If you don’t, the XHTML validator will sometimes get con- fused and claim you have errors when you don’t.   That CDATA business is bizarre. It’s hard to memorize, I know, but just type it  a few times, and you’ll own it.   A lot of older books and Web sites do not include the character data trick, but  it’s well worth mastering. You’ve invested too much effort into building stan- dards-compliant pages to have undeserved error messages pop up because  the browser mistakes your JavaScript for badly-formatted XHTML.     Creating comments  As with XHTML and CSS, JavaScript comments are important to include.  Because programming code can be more difficult to decipher than XHTML  or CSS, it’s even more important to comment your code in JavaScript than it  is in those other two environments. The comment character in JavaScript is  two slashes     . The browser ignores everything from the two slashes to the  end of the line. You can also use a multi-line comment   *  *   just like the  one in CSS.  Using the alert   method for output  There are a number of ways to output data in JavaScript. In this example, I  use the alert   method. This technique pops up a small dialog box contain- ing text for the user to read. The alert box is an example of a modal dialog  box. Modal dialog boxes interrupt the flow of the program until the user pays  attention to them. Nothing else will happen in the program until the user  acknowledges the dialog box by clicking the OK button. The user can’t inter- act with the page until after clicking the button.  Modal dialog boxes might seem a bit rude. In fact, you probably won’t use  them much once you learn some other input and output techniques. The fact  that the dialog box demands attention makes it a very easy tool to use when  you start programming. When you’ve got the basic programming ideas under  your belt, I show you more elegant ways to communicate with the Web page.    Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  37  Adding the semicolon  Each command in JavaScript ends with a semicolon  ;  character. The semi- colon in most computer languages acts like the period in English: It indicates  the end of a logical thought. Usually each line of code is also one line in the  text editor.     To tell the truth, JavaScript usually works fine if you leave out the semico-  lons, but you should add them anyway because they can clarify your mean- ing. Besides, most other languages  such as PHP, introduced in Chapter 14   require semicolons. You might as well start a good habit now.  Introducing Variables  Computer programs get their power by working with information. Figure 2-2  shows a program that gets data from the user and uses it in a customized  greeting.  This program introduces a new kind of dialog box that allows the user to  enter some data. The information is stored in the program for later use.  Figure 2-3 shows the first part of the response at the top. The user must click  OK to get the rest of the greeting in a second alert dialog box, as shown at the  bottom of Figure 2-3.  Figure 2-2:  The pro- gram asks  for the  user’s  name.    Figure 2-3:  A two- dialog box  response to  user input.           38 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   The output might not seem that incredible, but take a look at the source code  to see what’s happening:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       prompt.html                <![CDATA[              var person = «»;       person = prompt «What is your name?» ;       alert «Hi» ;       alert person ;                ]]>                          Creating a variable for data storage  This program is interesting because it allows user interaction. The user can  enter a name that is stored in the computer and then returned in a greeting.  The key to this program is a special element called a variable. Variables are  simply places in memory for holding data. Any time you want a computer  program to “remember” something, you can create a variable and store your  information in it.  Variables typically have the following characteristics:  ✓ The var statement. Indicates you are creating a variable with the var   command.  ✓ A name. When you create a variable, you are required to give it a name. ✓ An initial value. It’s useful to give each variable a value immediately ✓ A data type. JavaScript automatically determines the type of data in a  variable  more on this later , but you should still be clear in your mind  about what type of data you expect a particular variable to contain.                Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  39              Asking the user for information  Variables are more interesting when they contain information. JavaScript has  a simple tool called the prompt, which allows you to easily ask a question and  store the answer in a variable. Here’s the relevant line from prompt.html:        person = prompt “What is your name?” ;  The prompt statement does several interesting things:  ✓ It pops up a dialog box. The prompt   method creates a modal dialog   box much like the alert technique discussed earlier.  ✓ It asks a question. The prompt command expects you to ask the user a   question.  ✓ It provides space for a response. There is a space in the dialog box for  the user to type a response of some kind, and buttons to indicate that  the user is finished or wants to cancel the operation.  ✓ It passes the information to a variable. The purpose of a prompt com-  mand is to get data from the user, so prompts are nearly always con- nected to a variable. When the code is finished, the variable will contain  the indicated value.  Responding to the user  This program uses the alert   method to begin a greeting to the user. The  first alert works just like the one from the helloWorld program:        alert “Hi” ;  The content of the parentheses is the text you want the user to see. In this  case, you want the user to see the literal value “Hi”.  The second alert statement is a little bit different:        alert person ;  This alert statement has a parameter with no quotes. Since there are  no quotes, JavaScript understands you don’t really want to say the text  “person”. Instead, it looks for a variable named person, and returns the  value of that variable.  So the variable can take any name, store it, and return a customized greeting.   40 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Using Concatenation to Build  Better Greetings  It seems a little awkward to have the greeting and the person’s name on two  different lines. Figure 2-4 shows a better solution. The program asks for a  name again, and stores it in a variable. This time, the greeting is combined  into one alert dialog box, and it looks a lot better:  Figure 2-4:  Now there’s  just one  dialog box  response to  the user’s  input.       The secret to Figure 2-4 is one of those wonderful gems of the computing  world: a really simple idea with a really complicated name. Take a look at  the code and you’ll see that combining variables with text is not all that  complicated:                <![CDATA[          from concat.html        var person = “”;       person = prompt “What is your name?” ;       alert “Hi there, “ + person + “!” ;                ]]>        For the sake of brevity, I’ve only included the   tag and its contents;  the rest of this page is a standard blank XHTML page.  As always, see the  complete document on the Web site: www.aharrisbooks.net jad . I use  this approach throughout this chapter, but I also include a comment in each  JavaScript snippet to indicate where you can get the entire file on the Web  site.       Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  41  Concatenation and your editor  The hard part about concatenation is figuring  out which part of your text is a literal value and  which part is a string. It won’t take long before  you start going cross-eyed trying to understand  where the quotes go.  Modern text editors  like Aptana  have a won- derful  feature  that  can  help  you  here.  They  color different kinds of text in different colors.  By default, Aptana colors variable names black,  and literal text dark green  at least when you’re  in JavaScript — in HTML, literal text is in blue . Personally,  I  find  it  hard  to  differentiate  the  dark green from black, so I changed the Aptana  color scheme: I have it make string literals blue  whether I’m in JavaScript or HTML. With this  setting in place, I can easily see what part of  the statement is literal text and what’s being   read as a variable name. That makes concat- enation a lot easier. To change the color scheme in Aptana, click  Window➪Preferences. You’ll see an expand- able outline in the resulting dialog box. Click  Aptana➪Editors➪JavaScript  Editor➪Colors.  You can then scroll down and find color settings  for any type of data. I found “string”  another  term for text  under “literals” and changed the  color of my text strings from dark green to blue. If you make a mistake, there’s a button to revert  back to the default values. Most editors that have syntax highlighting allow  you to change settings to fit your needs. Don’t  be afraid to use these tools to help you program  better.  Comparing literals and variables  In this program there are really two different kinds of text. The whole expres- sion “Hi there, ” is a literal text value. That is, you really mean to say “Hi  there.” On the other hand, person is a variable; you can put any person’s  name in it. You can combine literal values and variables in one phrase if you  want:        alert “Hi there, “ + person + “!” ;  The secret to this code is to follow the quotes. “Hi there, ” is a literal  value, because it is in quotes. In this line, person is a variable name  because  it is not in quotes  and “!” is a literal value. You can combine any number of  text snippets together with the plus sign as shown in the preceding code.   Using the plus sign to combine text is called concatenation.  I told you it was  a complicated word for a simple idea.   Including spaces in concatenated phrases  You might be curious about the extra space between the comma and the  quote in the output line:   42 Part I: Programming with JavaScript               alert “Hi there, “ + person + “!” ;  This is important because you want the output to look like a normal sen- tence. If you don’t have the space, the computer won’t add one, and the  output would look like:  Hi there,Benjamin!  Be sure to construct the output as it should look on-screen, including spaces  and punctuation.  Understanding the string Object  The person variable used in the previous program is designed to hold text.  Programmers  being programmers  devised their own mysterious term to  refer to text. In programming, text is referred to as string data.   The term string comes from the way text is stored in computer memory. Each  character is stored in its own cell in memory, and all the characters in a word  or phrase reminded the early programmers of beads on a string.  Surprisingly  poetic for a bunch of geeks, huh?   Introducing object-oriented  programming  and cows   JavaScript  and many other modern programming languages  use a powerful  model called object-oriented programming  OOP . This style of programming  has a number of advantages. Most important for beginners, it allows you  access to some very powerful objects that do interesting things out of the box.   Objects are used to describe complicated things that can have a lot of  characteristics — for instance, a cow. You can’t really put an adequate  description of a cow in an integer variable.  In many object-oriented environments, objects can have these characteris- tics  imagine a cow object for the examples :           ✓ Properties: Characteristics about the object, such as breed and age.  ✓ Methods: Things the objects can do, such as moo   and giveMilk  . ✓ Events: Stimuli the object responds to, such as onTip  .    Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  43  Each of these ideas will be described as they are needed, as not all objects  support all these characteristics.   If you have a variable of type cow, it describes a pretty complicated thing.  This thing might have properties, methods, and events. All could be used  together to build a good representation of a cow.  Believe it or not, I’ve built  cow programming constructs more than once in my life — and you thought  programming was dull.   Most variable types in JavaScript are actually objects — and most JavaScript  objects have a full complement of properties and methods  many even have  event handlers . When you get a handle on how all these things work, you’ve  got a powerful and compelling programming environment.  Okay, before somebody sends me some angry e-mails, I know there is some  debate about whether JavaScript is a truly object-oriented language. I’m not  going to get into the  frankly boring and not terribly important  details in this  book. We’re going to call it object-oriented for now, because it’s close enough  for beginners. If that bothers you, you can refer to JavaScript as an object- based language. Nearly everyone agrees with that. More information on this  topic is throughout the book as you learn how to build your own objects in  Chapter 5 and how to use HTML elements as objects in Chapter 6.     Investigating the length of a string  When you assign text to a variable, JavaScript automatically treats the vari- able as a string object. The object instantly takes on the characteristics of a  string object. Strings have a couple of properties, and a bunch of methods.  The one interesting property  at least for beginners  is length. Look at the  example in Figure 2-5 to see the length property in action:  Figure 2-5:  This  program  reports the  length of  any text.       That’s kind of cool. The cooler part is the way it works. As soon as you assign  a text value to a variable, JavaScript treats that variable as a string, and since  it’s a string, it now has a length property. This property returns the length  of the string in characters. Here’s how it’s done in the code:   44 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                 <![CDATA[         from nameLength.html              var person = prompt “Please enter your name.” ;       var length = person.length;              alert “Hi, “ + person + “!” ;       alert “The name “ + person + “ is “ + length + “   characters long.” ;                 ]]>        This code uses the length property as if it were a special subvariable. For  example, person is a variable in the previous example — and person. length is the length property of the person variable. In JavaScript, an  object and a variable are connected by a period  with no spaces .  The string object in JavaScript has only two other properties  constructor  and prototype . Both of these properties are only needed for advanced pro- gramming, so I skip them for now.   Using string methods to manipulate text  The length property is kind of cool, but the string object has a lot more up  its sleeve. Objects also have methods  things the object can do . Strings in  JavaScript have all kinds of methods. Here’s a few of my favorites:              ✓ toUpperCase  : Makes an entirely uppercase copy of the string. ✓ toLowerCase  : Makes an entirely lowercase copy of the string. ✓ substring  : Returns a specific part of the string. ✓ indexOf  : Determines if one string occurs within another.  The string object has many other methods, but I’m highlighting these because  they’re useful for beginners. Many of the string methods — such as big   and  fontColor   — simply add HTML code to text. They aren’t used very often,  because they produce HTML code that won’t validate, and they don’t really  save a lot of effort anyway. Some of the other methods — such as search  ,  replace  , and slice   — use advanced constructs like arrays and regular  expressions that aren’t necessary for beginners.  To learn more about work- ing with arrays, see Chapter 5. You learn more about regular expressions in  Chapter 7.           Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  45  Why are the first three characters  0, 3 ?  The  character  locations  for  JavaScript   and  most  programming  languages   will  prob- ably seem somewhat strange to you until you  know  the  secret.  You  might  expect  text. substring 1,3  to return the first three  characters of the variable text, yet I used  text.substring 0,3   to  do  that  job.  Here’s why: The indices don’t correspond to   character numbers; instead, they are the indi- ces between characters.  abcd 0 1 2 3 4  So if I want the first three characters of the  string “abcd”, I use substring 0,3 . If  I want the “cd” part, it’s substring 2,4 .      Don’t take my word for it. Look up the JavaScript string object in the Aptana  online help  or one of the many other online JavaScript references  and see  what properties and methods it has.  Like properties, methods are attached to an object by using a period. Methods  are distinguished by a pair of parentheses, which sometimes contains special  information called parameters. Parameters are information that will be passed  to the method so it can do its job. Some methods require parameters, and  some do not. It all makes sense once you start using methods.  The best way to see how methods work is to check out some in action. Look  at the code for stringMethods.html:                <![CDATA[         from stringMethods.html        var text = prompt “Please enter some text.” ;              alert “I’ll shout it out:” ;       alert text.toUpperCase   ;              alert “Now in lowercase...” ;       alert text.toLowerCase   ;              alert “The first ‘a’ is at letter...” ;       alert text.indexOf “a”  ;              alert “The first three letters are ...” ;       alert text.substring 0, 3  ;                ]]>        The output produced by this program is shown in Figure 2-6.   46 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Here’s yet another cool thing about Aptana: When you type the term text.   complete with period , Aptana understands that you’re talking about a string  variable and automatically pops up a list of all the possible properties and  methods.  I wish I’d had that when I started doing this stuff.   You can see from this code that methods are pretty easy to use. When you  have a string variable in place, you can invoke the variable’s name, followed  by a period and the method’s name. Some of the methods require more infor- mation to do their job. Here’s a look at the specifics:  ✓ toUpperCase   and toLowerCase  :Takes the value of the variable  and converts it entirely to the given case. This is often used when you  aren’t concerned about the capitalization of a variable.  ✓ indexOf substring : Returns the character position of the substring  within the variable. If the variable doesn’t contain the substring, return  the value -1.  ✓ substring begin, end : Returns the substring of the variable from   the beginning character value to the end.                 Figure 2-6:  String  methods  can be  fun. . . .      Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  47  Understanding Variable Types  JavaScript isn’t too fussy about whether a variable contains text or a number,  but the distinction is still important, because there is a difference in the way  these things are stored in memory, and this difference can cause some sur- prising problems.   Adding numbers  To see what can go wrong when JavaScript misunderstands data types, try  a little experiment. First, take a look at the following program  as usual for  this chapter, I’m only showing the script part because the rest of the page is  blank :            <![CDATA       from addNumbers.html       var x = 5;     var y = 3;     var sum = x + y;          alert x + « plus « + y + « equals « + sum ;        ]]>      This program features three variables. I’ve assigned the value 5 to x, and 3  to y. I then add x + y and assign the result to a third variable, sum. The last  line prints out the results, which are also shown in Figure 2-7.  Figure 2-7:  This  program   correctly   adds two  numbers  together.       Note a few important things from this example:   48 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                  ✓ You can assign values to variables. It’s best to read the equals sign   as “gets” so the first assignment should be read as “variable x gets the  value 5.”      var x = 5;  ✓ Numeric values are not enclosed in quotes. When you refer to a text   literal value, it is always enclosed in quotes. Numeric data  like the value  5  are not placed in quotes.  ✓ You can add numeric values. Since x and y both contain numeric   values, you can add them together.  ✓ The results of an operation can be placed in a variable. The result of   the calculation x + y is placed in a variable called sum.  ✓ Everything works as expected. The program behaves in the way you   intended it to. That’s important because it’s not always true as you’ll see  in the next example — I love writing code that blows up on purpose!  Adding the user’s numbers  The natural extension of the addNumbers.html program would be a feature  that allows the user to input two values and then return the sum. This could  be the basis for a simple adding machine. Here’s the JavaScript code:                <![CDATA[         from addInputWrong.html              var x = prompt “first number:” ;       var y = prompt “second number:” ;       var sum = x + y;              alert x + “ plus “ + y + “ equals “ + sum ;                ]]>        This code seems reasonable enough. It asks for each value and stores them  in variables. It then adds the variables up and returns the results, right? Well,  look at Figure 2-8 and you’ll see a surprise.  Something’s obviously not right here. To understand the problem, you need  to see how JavaScript makes guesses about data types.     Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  49  Figure 2-8:  Wait a  minute . . .  3 + 5 = 35?       The trouble with dynamic data  Ultimately, all the information stored in a computer, from music videos to  e-mails, is stored as a bunch of ones and zeroes. The same value 01000001  could mean all kinds of things: it might mean the number 65 or the character  A.  In fact, it does mean both of those things in the right context.  The same  binary value might mean something entirely different if it’s interpreted as a  real number, a color, or a part of a sound file.   The theory isn’t critical here, but one point is really important: Somehow the  computer has to know what kind of data is stored in a specific variable. Many  languages  like C and Java  have all kinds of rules about this. If you create a  variable in one of these languages, you have to define exactly what kind of  data will go in the variable — and you can’t change it.  JavaScript is much more easygoing about variable types. When you make  a variable, you can put any kind of data in it that you want. In fact, the data  type can change. A variable can contain an integer at one point and the same  variable might contain text in another part of the program.   JavaScript uses the context to determine how to interpret the data in a par- ticular variable. When you assign a value to a variable, JavaScript puts the  data in one of the following categories:   50 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                  ✓ Integer: Integers are whole numbers  no decimal part . They can be   positive or negative values.  ✓ Floating-point number: A floating-point number has a decimal point like   3.14. Floating-point values can also be expressed in scientific notation  like 6.02e23  Avagadro’s number: 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd . Floating- point numbers can also be negative.  ✓ Boolean: A Boolean value can only be true or false. ✓ String: Text is usually referred to as “string” data in programming lan-  guages. String values are usually enclosed in quotes.  ✓ Arrays and objects: These are more complex data types you can ignore   for now. They are covered in depth in Chapter 5.  These different data types are necessary because the computer uses differ- ent techniques to store different types of data into the binary format that  all computer memory ultimately uses. Most of the time, when you make a  variable, JavaScript guesses right and you have no problems. But sometimes  JavaScript makes some faulty assumptions and things go wrong.  The pesky plus sign  I’ve used the plus sign in two different ways throughout this chapter. The fol- lowing code uses the plus sign in one way:  In this code, x and y are text variables. The result = x + y line is inter- preted as “concatenate x and y,” and the result will be “Hi, there!”.  Here’s the strange thing: The following code is almost identical:  var x = “Hi, “; var y = “there!”;  result = x + y; alert result ;  var x = 3; var y = 5;  result = x + y; alert result ;  The behavior of the plus sign is different here, even though the statement  result = x + y is identical!  In this second case, x and y are numbers. The plus operator has two entirely  different jobs. If it’s surrounded by numbers, it adds. If it’s surrounded by  text, it concatenates! Automatically.  Hoo boy.     Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  51  That’s what happens to the first adding-machine program  the one that blows  up : When the user enters data in prompt dialog boxes, JavaScript assumes the  data is text. So when I try to add x and y, it “helpfully” concatenates instead.  There’s a fancy computer-science word for this phenomenon  an operator  doing different things in different circumstances . Those Who Care About  Such Things call this an overloaded operator. Smart people sometimes have  bitter arguments about whether overloaded operators are a good idea or not,  because they can cause problems like the program concatenating when you  think it will add. Overloaded operators can also make things easier in other  contexts. I’m not going to enter into that debate here. It’s not a big deal, as  long as you can see the problem and fix it when it occurs.      Changing Variables to the Desired Type  If JavaScript is having a hard time figuring out what type of data is in a vari- able, you can give it a friendly push in the right direction with some handy  conversion functions as shown in Table 2-1.  Table 2-1  Function parseInt   parseFloat    toString   eval   Math.ceil   Math.floor   Math.round    Variable Conversion Functions  From String String  Any variable Expression Floating- point  To Integer Floating- point String Result Integer  Example parseInt “23”  parseFloat   “21.5”  myVar.toString   eval “5 + 3”  Math.ceil 5.2  Math.floor 5.2  Math.round 5.2   Result 23 21.5  varies 8 6 5 5  Using variable conversion tools  The conversion functions are incredibly powerful, but you only need them if  the automatic conversion causes you problems. Here’s how they work:     ✓ parseInt  : Used to convert text to an integer. If you put a text value   inside the parentheses, the function returns an integer value. If the  string has a floating-point representation  “4.3” for example , an integer  value  4  will be returned.   52 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                     ✓ parseFloat  : Converts text to a floating-point value.  ✓ toString  : Takes any variable type and creates a string representa-  tion. Note that it isn’t usually necessary to use this function, because it’s  usually invoked automatically when needed.  ✓ eval  : This is a special method that accepts a string as input. It then   attempts to evaluate the string as JavaScript code and return the output.  You can use this for variable conversion or as a simple calculator —  eval “5 + 3”  will return the integer 8.  ✓ Math.ceil  : One of several methods of converting a floating-point   number to an integer. This technique always rounds upward, so Math. ceil 1.2  will be 2, and Math.ceil 1.8  will also be 2.   ✓ Math.floor  : Similar to Math.ceil, except it always rounds down-  ward, so Math.floor 1.2  and Math.floor 1.8  will both evaluate  to 1.  ✓ Math.round  : Works like the standard rounding technique used in   grade school. Any fractional value less than .5 will round down, and  greater than or equal to .5 will round up, so Math.round 1.2  is 1, and  Math.round 1.8  is 2.  Fixing the addInput code  With all this conversion knowledge in place, it’s pretty easy to fix up the  addInput program so it works correctly. Just use parseFloat   to force  both inputs into floating-point values before adding them. Note that you  don’t have to convert the result explicitly to a string. That’s done automati- cally when you invoke the alert   method:          <![CDATA[          from addInput.html              var x = prompt “first number:” ;       var y = prompt “second number:” ;       var sum = parseFloat x  + parseFloat y ;              alert x + “ plus “ + y + “ equals “ + sum ;                ]]>   You can see the program works correctly in Figure 2-9.  Conversion methods allow you to ensure the data is in exactly the format you  want.    Chapter 2: Writing Your First Program  53  Figure 2-9:  Now the  program  asks for  input and  correctly  returns  the sum.        54 Part I: Programming with JavaScript    Chapter 3   Changing Program Behavior   with Conditions  In This Chapter ▶ Generating random numbers and converting them to integers ▶ Understanding conditions ▶ Using the if-else structure ▶ Managing multiple conditions ▶ Using the switch structure ▶ Handling unusual conditions  One of the most important aspects of computers is their apparent abil-  ity to make decisions. Computers can change their behavior based on  circumstances. In this chapter you learn how to create random numbers in  JavaScript, and several ways to have your program make decisions based on  the roll of a digital die.  Working with Random Numbers  Random numbers are a big part of computing. They add uncertainty to  games, but they’re also used for serious applications like simulations, secu- rity, and logic. In this chapter, you generate random numbers to simulate  dice and then explore various ways to modify the computer’s behavior based  on the value of the roll.   Most languages have a feature for creating random numbers, and JavaScript  is no exception. The Math.random   function returns a random floating- point value between 0 and 1.   56 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                    Technically, computers can’t create truly random numbers. Instead, they  use a complex formula that starts with one value and creates a second semi- predictable value. In JavaScript, the first value  called the random seed  is  taken from the system clock in milliseconds, so the results of a random  number call seem truly random.  Creating a die to die for  It’s very easy to create a random floating-point number between 0 and 1,  because that’s what the Math.random   function does. What if you want  an integer within a specific range? For example, you might want to simulate  rolling a six-sided die. How do you get from the 0-to-1 floating-point value to a  1-to-6 integer?   Here’s the standard approach:  1.  Get a random floating-point value.     Use the Math.random   function to get a floating-point value between 0  and 1.  2.  Multiply the zero-to-one value by 6.     This gives you a floating-point value between 0 and 5.999  but never 6 .  3.  Use Math.ceil   to round up.     Here’s where you need to convert the number to an integer. In Chapter 2  I mention three functions to convert from a float to an integer. Math. ceil   always rounds up, which means you’ll always get an integer  between 1 and 6.  Rolling the dice  Take a look at the RollDie.html code that rolls your digital dice:   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       rollDie.html                <![CDATA[          from rollDie.html           Chapter 3: Changing Program Behavior with Conditions  57        var number = Math.random  ;       alert number ;              var biggerNumber = number * 6;       alert biggerNumber ;              var die = Math.ceil biggerNumber ;       alert die ;          ]]>                                                            As you can see, I converted the strategy from the previous section directly  into JavaScript code:  1.  Create a random floating-point value.     The Math.random   function creates a random floating-point number  and stores it in the variable number.  2.  Multiply the number by 6.     To move the number into the appropriate range  6 values , I multiplied  by 6, and stored the result in biggerNumber.  3.  Round up.     I used the Math.ceil   function to round the number up to the next  highest integer.  Figure 3-1 shows the program running.

Using if to Control Flow  If you can roll a die, you’ll eventually want different things to happen in dif- ferent circumstances. Figure 3-2 shows two different runs of a simple game  called deuce.html.  Okay, it’s not that exciting. I promise to add dancing hippos in a later version.  In any case, the “You got a deuce” message only happens when you roll a  2.

This powerful command  does a number of important things:  ✓ It sets up a condition. More on conditions in a moment, but the main   idea is this: A condition is a true or false question. if statements always  include some type of condition in parentheses.  ✓ It begins a block of code. if statements set up a chunk of code that  won’t always execute. The end of the if line includes a left brace  { . ✓ It usually has indented code under it. The line or lines immediately   after the if statement are part of the block, so they are indented to indi- cate they are special.  ✓ It ends several lines later. The end of the if statement is actually the  right brace  }  several lines down in the code. In essence, an if state- ment contains other code.   ✓ It’s indented. The convention is to indent all the code between the if   statement and its ending brace.  While not required, it’s common to put a comment indicating that the right  brace ends an if statement. In the C-like languages, the same symbol  }  is  used to end a bunch of things, so it’s nice to remind yourself what you think  you’re ending here.                        60 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Using conditions           A condition is the central part of if statements and several other important  structures. Conditions deserve a little respect of their own. A condition is an  expression that can be evaluated to be true or false. Conditions come in three  main flavors:  ✓ A comparison: This is by far the most common kind of condition. Typically   you compare a variable to a value, or two variables to each other. A  number of different types of comparisons are described in Table 3-1.  ✓ A Boolean variable: Boolean variables are variables that only contain   true or false values. In JavaScript, any variable can be a Boolean,  if you assign it a true or false value. It’s unnecessary to compare a  Boolean to anything else, because it’s already true or false.  ✓ A Boolean function: Sometimes you’ll have a function that returns a true   or false value. This type of function can also be used as a condition.  Incidentally, Boolean variables are the only variable type capitalized in most  languages. This is because they were named after a person, George Boole.  He was a nineteenth-century mathematician who developed a form of binary  arithmetic. He died thinking his logic research a failure. His work eventually  became the foundation of modern computing. Drop a mention of George at  your next computer-science function to earn muchos geek points.     Comparison operators  JavaScript supports a number of different types of comparisons, summarized  in Table 3-1:  Table 3-1  Name Equal  Not equal Less than  Greater than  Less than or  equal to Greater than  or equal to   JavaScript Comparison Operators  Operator ==  Example  x==3   !=  <  >  <=  >=   x != 3    x < 3    x > 3    x <= 3    x >= 3   Notes Works with all variable types,  including strings True if values are not equal Numeric or alphabetical  comparison Numeric or alphabetical  comparison Numeric or alphabetical  comparison Numeric or alphabetical  comparison    Chapter 3: Changing Program Behavior with Conditions  61  You should consider a few things when working with conditions:  ✓ Make sure the variable types are compatible. You’ll get unpredictable   results if you compare a floating-point value to a string.  ✓ You can compare string values. In JavaScript, the inequality operators  can be used to determine the alphabetical order of two values, and you  can use the same equality symbol  ==  with strings that you use with  other variables.  This is not true in all programming languages.   ✓ Equality uses a double equals sign. The single equals sign  =  is used  to indicate assignment. When you’re comparing variables, use a double  equals sign  ==  instead.  Don’t confuse assignment with comparison! If you accidentally say  x = 3   instead of  x == 3 , your code won’t crash, but it won’t work properly. The  first statement simply assigns the value 3 to the variable x. It returns the value  true if the assignment was successful  which it will be . You’ll think you’re  comparing x to 3, but you’re assigning x to 3, and the condition will always be  true. It’s a nightmare. I still do it once in a while.     Do What I Say or Else  The Deuce game is pretty exciting and all, but it would be even better if you  had one comment when the roll is a 2 and another comment when it’s some- thing else. The else-if structure is designed to let you specify one behavior  when a condition is true, and another behavior if the condition is false. Figure  3-3 shows a program with exactly this behavior.              Figure 3-3:  You get one  message  for deuces  and another  message for  everything  else.    This program uses the same type of condition, but it adds an important  section:   62 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                             <![CDATA[          from deuceOrNot.html              var die = Math.ceil Math.random   * 6 ;       if  die == 2 {         alert «You got a deuce!» ;       } else {         alert «It’s only a « + die + «.» ;       }    end if                ]]>        The if statement is unchanged, but now there’s an else clause. Here’s how  it works:   ✓ The if statement sets up a condition: The if indicates the beginning of   a code branch, and it prepares the way for a condition.  ✓ The condition establishes a test: Conditions are true or false expres-  sions, so the condition will indicate something that can be true or false. ✓ If the condition is true: The code between the condition and the else  clause runs. After this code is finished, program control moves past the  end of the if structure.  That is, the computer skips the else clause  and executes then next line of code outside the if structure.   ✓ If the condition is false: The code between else and the end of the if   runs instead.  The else clause acts like a fork in the road. The code will go along one path  or another  depending on the condition , but never both at once.  You can put as much code as you want inside an if or else clause, includ- ing more if statements!  You can only use else in the context of an if statement. You can’t use else  by itself.     Using else-if for more complex interaction  The if-else structure is pretty useful when you have only two branches, but  what if you want to have several different options? Imagine for example that  you want to output a different value for every single possible die value. You’ll  need a variation of the if structure to make this work. I show such a tool next,  but first, look at a program which uses this technique. Figure 3-4 shows a die  only a geek could love. All its values are output in binary notation.    Chapter 3: Changing Program Behavior with Conditions  63  Binary?  Binary notation is the underlying structure of all  data in a computer. It uses 1s and 0s to store  other  numbers,  which  can  be  combined  to  form everything you see on the computer, from  graphics to text to music videos and adventure  games. Here’s a quick conversion chart so you  can read the dice:  001 = 1 010 = 2  011 = 3 100 = 4  101 = 5 110 = 6  You can survive just fine without knowing binary   unless  you’re  a  computer  science  major  —  then you’re expected to dream in binary . Still,  it’s kind of cool to know how things really work.  Figure 3-4:  A die for the  true geek  gamer.       A simple if-else structure won’t be sufficient here, because you have six  different options, and if-else only gives you two choices. Here’s some  code that uses another variation of if and else:                <![CDATA[          from binaryDice.html              var die = Math.ceil Math.random   * 6 ;       if  die == 1 {         alert «001» ;       } else if  die == 2 {         alert «010» ;               } else if  die == 3 {         alert «011» ;       } else if  die == 4 {         alert «100» ;       } else if  die == 5 {         alert «101» ;       } else if  die == 6 {         alert «110» ;       } else {         alert «something strange is happening...» ;       }    end if                ]]>         64 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                  This program begins with an ordinary if statement, but it has a number of  else clauses. You can include as many else clauses as you want if each  includes its own condition.  For example, imagine the computer generates the value 3. The process would  look like this:  1.  The first condition  die == 1  is false, so the program immediately   jumps to the next else.   2.  This sets up another condition  die == 2 , which is also false, so pro-  gram control goes to the next else clause.   3.  This one has yet another condition  die == 3  — which is true! The   code inside this clause is executed  alerting the value “011” .   4.  A condition has finally been triggered — so the computer skips all the   other else conditions and moves to the line after the end if.   5.  This is the last line of code — so the program ends.  The mystery of the unnecessary else  When you use multiple conditions, you can  and should  still indicate an  ordinary else clause without a condition as your last choice. This special  condition sets up code that should happen if none of the other conditions  is triggered. It’s useful as a “garbage collection” function, in case you didn’t  anticipate a condition in the else if clauses.  If you think carefully about the binary dice program, the else clause seems  superfluous. It isn’t really necessary! You went through all that trouble to  create a random number scheme that guarantees you’ll have an integer  between 1 and 6. If you checked for all six values, why have an else clause?  It should never be needed.  There’s a big difference between what should happen and what does happen.  Even if you think you’ve covered every single case, you’re going to be sur- prised every once in a while. If you use a multiple if structure, you should  always incorporate an else clause to check for surprises. It doesn’t need to  do much but inform you that something has gone terribly wrong.  It’s Time to Switch Your Thinking  The dice problem is a special type of branching, where you have one expres- sion  the die  that could have multiple values  1 through 6 . Many program- ming languages include a handy tool for exactly this type of situation. Take a  look at Figure 3-5, where you’ll see yet another variation of the die roller.    Chapter 3: Changing Program Behavior with Conditions  65  Figure 3-5:  Ancient  Roman dice,  useful if  we come  across any  ancient  Romans.       Once again I start with an ordinary 1 through 6 integer and assign a new  value based on the original roll. This time I use another structure specialized  for “one expression with lots of values” situations. Take a look at the code:                <![CDATA[          from RomanDice.html       var die = Math.ceil Math.random   * 6 ;       var output = «»;       switch die {         case 1:           output = «I»;           break;         case 2:           output = «II»;           break;         case 3:           output = «III»;           break;         case 4:           output = «IV»;           break;         case 5:           output = «V»;           break;         case 6:           output = «VI»;           break;         default:           output = «PROBLEM!!!»;       }    end switch  Creating an expression  The switch structure is organized a little bit differently than the if with a  bunch of else ifs business.    66 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                                        The switch keyword is followed immediately by an expression in parenthe- ses. The expression is usually a variable with several possible values. The  switch structure then provides a series of test values and code to execute in  each case.  Here’s how to create a switch statement:  1.  Begin with the switch keyword.     This sets up the structure. You’ll indent everything until the right brace   }  that ends the switch structure.  2.  Indicate the expression.    This is usually a variable you want to compare against several values.  The variable goes inside parentheses and is followed by a left brace { .   3.  Identify the first case.     Indicate the first value you want to compare the variable against. Be  sure the case is the same type as the variable.  4.  End the case description with a colon  : .   Be careful! Case lines end with a colon  indicating the beginning of a  case  rather than the more typical semicolon. It’s easy to forget this.        5.  Write code for the case.     You can write as many lines of code as you want. This code will only be  executed if the expression is equal to the given case. Typically all the  code in a case is indented.  6.  Indicate the end of the case with a break statement.     The break statement tells the computer to jump out of the switch  structure as soon as this case has been evaluated  which is almost  always what you want .  7.  Repeat with other cases.     Build similar code for all the other cases you want to test.  8.  Trap for surprises with the default clause.     The special case default works like the else in an else if struc- ture. It manages any cases that haven’t already been trapped. Even if  you think you’ve got all the bases covered, you should put some default  code in place just in case.  You don’t need to put a break statement in the default clause, because it  always happens at the end of the switch structure anyway.       Chapter 3: Changing Program Behavior with Conditions  67              Switching with style  The switch structure is powerful, but it can be a little tricky, because the  format is a little strange. Here are a few handy tips to keep in mind:  ✓ You can compare any type of expression. If you’ve used another lan- guage  like C or Java  you might have learned that switches only work  on numeric values. JavaScript switches can be used on any data type.  ✓ It’s up to you to get the type correct. If you are working with a numeric  variable and you compare it against string values, you might not get the  results you’re expecting.  ✓ Don’t forget the colons. At the end of most lines, the switch statement  uses semicolons like most other JavaScript commands. The lines describ- ing cases end with colons  :  instead. It’s really easy to get confused.  ✓ Break each case. Use the break statement to end each case, or you’ll   get weird results.  If you’ve got some programming experience, you might argue that another  option involving something called arrays would be a better solution for this  particular problem. I tend to agree, but for that, look ahead to Chapter 5.  Switches and if – else if structures do have their place, too.      Nesting if Statements  It’s possible to combine conditions in all kinds of crazy ways. One decision  might include other decisions, which could incorporate other decisions. You  can put if statements inside each other to manage this kind of  sometimes  complicated  logic.  What’s this L337 stuff?  Leet  L337  is a wacky social phenomenon pri- marily born of the online gaming community.  Originally  it  began  as  people  tried  to  create  unique screen names for multiplayer games.  If  you  wanted  to  call  yourself  “gamer,”  for  example, you’d usually find the name already  taken. Enterprising gamers started substituting  similar-looking letters and numbers  and some- times creative spelling  to make original names   that are still somewhat readable. The practice  spread, and now it’s combined with text mes- saging and online chat shortcuts as a sort of  geek code. Get it? L337 94m3r is “Leet Gamer,”  or “Elite Gamer.” Before you ask, I don’t know  why  the  referee  is  sometimes  a  surfer  and  sometimes  a  L337  94m3r.  It  must  have  been  some sort of bizarre childhood circumstances.    68 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Figure 3-6 shows a particularly bizarre example. Imagine you’re watching the  coin toss at your favorite sporting event. Of course, a coin can be heads or  tails. Just for the sake of argument, the referee also has a complex personal- ity. Sometimes he’s a surfer and sometimes he’s a L337 94m3r  translation:  elite gamer . The figure shows a few tosses of the coin.  This is getting pretty strange, so you might as well look at some code:                <![CDATA[          from coinToss.html       coin = Math.ceil Math.random   * 2 ;       character = Math.ceil Math.random   * 2 ;       if  character == 1 {           It’s a surfer referee         if  coin == 1 {           alert “You got heads, Dude.” ;         } else {           alert “Dude! It’s totally tails!” ;         }    end coin if                } else {           now it’s a L337 Referee         if  coin == 1 {           alert “h34D$ r0xx0r$” ;         } else {           alert “741L$ ruL3” ;         }    end coin if       }    end character if                ]]>        Figure 3-6:  Heads or  tails? Surfer  or gamer?         Chapter 3: Changing Program Behavior with Conditions  69  Building the nested conditions  Once you understand how nested if structures work, you can see how this  all fits together. The following refers to the example in the previous section:  1.  You flip a coin.     I just used a variation of the die-rolling technique. A coin can be only  heads or tails, so I rolled a value that would be 1 or 2 for the coin  variable.  2.  Flip another coin for the personality.     The referee’s persona will be reflected in another random value between  1 and 2.  3.  Check for the surfer.     If the character roll is 1, we have a surfer, so set up an if statement to  handle the surfer’s output.  4.  If it’s the surfer, check the coin toss.     Now that you know it’s a surfer speaking, you’ll need to check the coin  for heads or tails. You’ll need another if statement for this.  5.  Respond to the coin toss in surfer-speak.     Use alert   statements to output the result in the surfer dialect.  6.  Handle the L337 character.     The outer if structure determines which character is speaking. The  else clause of this case will happen if character is not 1, so all the  LEET stuff goes in the else clause.  7.  Check the coin again.     Now you know you’re speaking in gamer code, determine what to say by  consulting the coin in another if statement.  Making sense of nested ifs  As you can see, nested if structures aren’t all that difficult, but they can be  messy, especially as you get several layers deep  as you will, eventually .  Here’s a batch of tips to make sure everything makes sense:  ✓ Watch your indentation. Indentation is a great way to tell what level of   code you’re on, but be vigilant on the indentation scheme you choose. An  editor like Aptana, which automatically indents your code, is a big plus.                                         70 Part I: Programming with JavaScript         ✓ Use comments. It’s easy to get lost in the logic of a nested condition.   Add comments liberally so you can remind yourself where you are in the  logic. Note that in the examples in this chapter I specify which if state- ment is ending.  ✓ Test your code. Just because you think it works doesn’t mean it will.   Surprises happen. Test thoroughly to make sure the code does what you  think it should do.   Chapter 4  Loops and Debugging  In This Chapter ▶ Creating for loops ▶ Learning for loop variations ▶ Building flexible while loops ▶ Making well-behaved while loops ▶ Recognizing troublesome loops ▶ Catching crashes with debugging tools ▶ Catching logic errors ▶ Using the Aptana line-by-line debugger ▶ Using the Firebug debugger ▶ Watching variables and conditions  Computer programs can do repetitive tasks easily. This is accomplished   through a series of constructs called loops. A loop is a structure that   allows you to repeat a chunk of code. In this chapter you learn the two major  techniques for managing loops.   Loops are powerful, but they can be dangerous. It’s possible to create loops  that act improperly, and these problems are very difficult to diagnose. But  don’t worry. I demonstrate a number of very powerful techniques for looking  through your code to find out what’s going on.  Building Counting Loops with for  One very standard type of loop is the for loop. You use these loops when  you want to repeat code a certain number of times. Figure 4-1 shows a for  loop in action:  It looks like ten different alert   statements, but there’s only one. It just got  repeated ten times.   72 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Figure 4-1:  This loop  repeats ten  times before  it stops.       In Figure 4-1, and some of the other looping demos in this chapter, I show the  first few dialog boxes and the last. You should be able to get the idea. Be sure  to look at the actual program on either of the companion Web sites  www. dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd or www.aharrisbooks.net  jad  to see how it really works.     Building a standard for loop  The structure of the for loop can be seen by studying the code:                <![CDATA[         from BasicFor.html       for  lap = 1; lap <= 10; lap++ {         alert “now on lap: “ + lap + “.” ;       }    end for         ]]>        for loops are based on an integer  sometimes called a sentry variable . In  this example, lap is serving as the sentry variable. The sentry variable is nor- mally used to count the number of repetitions through the loop.   The for statement has three distinct parts:  ✓ Initialization: This segment  lap = 1  sets up the initial value of the   sentry.  ✓ Condition: The condition  lap <= 10  is an ordinary condition    although it doesn’t require parentheses in this context . As long as the  condition is evaluated as true, the loop will repeat.  ✓ Modification: The last part of the for structure  lap++  indicates the  sentry will be modified in some way throughout the loop. In this case, I  add one to the lap variable each time through the loop.             Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  73  The for structure has a pair of braces containing the code that will be  repeated. As usual, all code inside this structure is indented. You can have as  much code inside a loop as you want.  The lap++ operator is a special shortcut. It’s very common to add one to  a variable, so the lap++ operation means “add one to lap.” You could also  write lap = lap + 1, but lap++ sounds so much cooler.  When programmers decided to improve on the C language, they called the  new language C++. Get it? It’s one better than C! Those computer scientists are  such a wacky bunch!  for loops are pretty useful when you know how many times something  should happen.   Making a backwards loop  You can modify the basic for loop so it counts backward. Figure 4-2 shows  an example of this behavior.        Figure 4-2:  This pro- gram counts  backward  by using a  for loop.       The backward version of the for loop uses the same general structure as the  forward version, but with slightly different parameters:                <![CDATA[         from backwards.html        for  lap = 10; lap >= 1; lap-- {         alert “Backing up: “ + lap ;       }    end for          ]]>         74 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                     If you want to count backward, just modify the three parts of the for  statement:   ✓ Initialize the sentry to a large number: If you’re counting down, you   need to start with a larger number than 0 or 1.  ✓ Keep going as long as the sentry is larger than some value: The code   inside the loop will execute as long as the condition is true. The number  will continue to get smaller, so make sure you’re doing a “greater than”  or “greater than or equal to” comparison.  ✓ Decrement the sentry: If you want the number to get smaller, you need  to subtract something from it. The -- operator is a quick way to do this.  It subtracts 1 from the variable.  Counting five at a time  You can use the for loop to make other kinds of counting loops. If you want  to count by fives, for example, you can use the following variation:                <![CDATA[                from byFive.html       for  i = 5; i <= 25; i += 5 {         alert i ;       }    end for                ]]>        This code starts i as 5, repeats as long as i is less than or equal to 25, and  adds 5 to i on each pass through the loop. Figure 4-3 illustrates this code in  action.  If you want a for loop to skip numbers, you just make a few changes to the  general pattern.  ✓ Initialize the sentry to 5: I want the loop to start at 5, so that’s the initial   value.  ✓ Compare the sentry to 25: It makes sense for a 5 loop to end at a mul-  tiple of 5. I want this loop to continue until we get to 25, so the loop will  continue as long as i is less than or equal to 25.   ✓ Add 5 to i on each pass: The statement i += 5 adds 5 to i.  It’s just   like saying i = i + 5.     Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  75  Figure 4-3:  A for loop  can also  skip values.        The key to building for loops is to remember these three elements and make  sure they work together: Build a sentry variable, give it a sensible initial  value, check against a condition, and modify the variable on each pass.   This is easy to do in a for loop, because all these elements are in the for  loop structure. Still, if you find your loop isn’t working as expected, you  might need to look into the debugging tricks described later in this chapter.  Looping for a while  The for loop is useful, but it has a cousin that’s even more handy, called the  while loop. A while loop isn’t committed to any particular number of rep- etitions. It simply repeats as long as its condition is true.   Creating a basic while loop  The basic while loop is deceptively simple to build. Here’s an example:                <![CDATA[          from while.html   76 Part I: Programming with JavaScript         answer = “-99”;       while  answer != “5” {         answer = prompt “What is 3 + 2?” ;         if  answer == “5” {           alert “great!” ;         } else {            alert “try again...” ;         }    end if       }    end while                ]]>        This script asks the user a simple math question — and keeps asking until  the user responds correctly. You can see it in action in Figure 4-4.  Figure 4-4:  This loop  continues  until the  user enters  the correct  answer.                          The operation of a while loop is pretty easy to understand. Here’s how the  math program works:  1.  Create a variable called answer.    This will act as a sentry variable for the loop.  2.  Initialize the variable.    The initial value of the variable is set to “-99”, which can’t possibly be  correct. Doing so guarantees that the loop will execute at least one time.  3.  Evaluate what’s in the answer variable.    In this particular program the correct answer is 5. If the value of answer  is anything but 5, the loop continues. I’ve preset the value of answer to  “-99”, so you know it’s going to happen at least once.  4.  Ask the user a challenging math question.    Well, a math question anyway. The important thing is to change the  value of answer so it’s possible to get 5 in answer and then exit the  loop.    Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  77                   5.  Give the user some feedback.    It’s probably good to let the user know how she did, so provide some  sort of feedback.   Avoiding loop mistakes  A while loop seems simpler than a for loop, but while has exactly the  same basic requirements:  ✓ There is usually a critical sentry variable. while loops are usually  but   not always  controlled by some key variable.   ✓ The sentry must be initialized. If the loop is going to behave properly,   the sentry variable must still be initialized properly. In most cases, you’ll  want to guarantee that the loop happens at least one time.  ✓ You must have a condition. Like the for loop, the while loop is based   on conditions. As long as the condition is true, the loop continues.  ✓ There must be a mechanism for changing the sentry. Somewhere in   the loop you need to have a line that changes the value of the sentry. Be  sure that it’s possible to make the condition logically false, or you’ll be  in the loop forever!  If you forget one of these steps, the while loop might not work correctly. It’s  easy to make mistakes with your while loops. Unfortunately, these mistakes  don’t usually result in a crash. Instead, the loop might either refuse to run  altogether or continue indefinitely.  Introducing Some Bad Loops  Sometimes loops don’t behave. Even if you’ve got the syntax correct, it’s pos- sible that your loop just doesn’t do what you want. Two main kinds of loop  errors are common: loops that never happen, and loops that never quit.  Managing the reluctant loop  You might write some code and find that the loop never seems to run. Here’s  some of a program that illustrates this woeful condition:   78 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                 <![CDATA[                from never.html         Warning! this script has a deliberate error!              i = 1;       while  i > 10 {         i++;       }    end while                ]]>        This code looks innocent enough, but if you run it, you’ll be mystified. It  doesn’t crash, but it also doesn’t seem to do anything. If you follow the code  step by step, you’ll eventually see why. I initialize i to 1, and then repeat as  long as i is greater than 10. See the problem? i is less than 10 at the very  beginning, so the condition starts out false, and the loop never executes! I  probably meant for the condition to be  i < 10 . It’s a sloppy mistake, but  exactly the kind of bone-headed error I make all the time.  Managing the compulsive loop  The other kind of bad-natured loop is the opposite of the reluctant loop. This  one starts up just fine, but never goes away!  The following code illustrates an endless loop:                <![CDATA[                from endless.html          Warning: this program has a deliberate          error! You will have to stop the browser          to end the loop.              i = 0;       j = 0;              while  i < 10 {         j++;         alert j ;       }    end while                ]]>          Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  79  If you decide to run endless.html, be aware that it will not work properly.  What’s worse, the only way to stop it will be to kill your browser through the  Task Manager program. I show you later in this chapter how to run such code  in a “safe” environment so you can figure out what’s wrong with it.     This code is just one example of the dreaded endless loop. Such a loop usu- ally has perfectly valid syntax, but a logic error prevents it from running  properly. The logical error is usually one of the following:  ✓ The variable was not initialized properly. The initial value of the sentry   is preventing the loop from beginning correctly.  ✓ The condition is checking for something that cannot happen. Either   the condition has a mistake in it, or something else is preventing it from  triggering.  ✓ The sentry has not been updated inside the loop. If you simply forget  to modify the sentry variable, you’ll get an endless loop. If you modify  the variable, but do it after the loop has completed, you get an endless  loop. If you ask for input in the wrong format, you might also get a diffi- cult-to-diagnose endless loop.           Debugging Your Code  If you’ve been writing JavaScript code, you’ve also been encountering errors.  It’s part of a programmer’s life. Loops are especially troublesome, because  they can cause problems even if there are no syntax errors. Fortunately,  there are some really great tricks you can use to help track down pesky bugs.  Letting Aptana help  If you’re writing your code with Aptana, you already have some great help  available. It gives you the same syntax-highlighting and code-completion fea- tures as you had when writing XHTML and CSS.  Also, Aptana can often spot JavaScript errors on the fly. Figure 4-5 shows a  program with a deliberate error.   80 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   These markers indicate errors in the code.  Figure 4-5:  Aptana  caught my  error and  provides  some help.                   Click an error to be taken to that line in the editor.  The validation pane lists all known errors.  Aptana notifies you of errors in your code with a few mechanisms:  ✓ The suspect code has a red squiggle underneath. It’s just like what a   word-processing spell-checker shows you for a suspect word.  ✓ A red circle indicates the troublesome line. You can scan the margin   and quickly see where the errors are.  ✓ All errors are summarized in the validation pane. You can see the   errors and the line number for each. Double-click an error to be taken to  that spot in the code.  ✓ You can hover over an error to get more help. Hover the mouse   pointer over an error to get a summary of the error.  Aptana can catch some errors, but it’s most useful for preventing errors with  its automatic indentation and code-assist features. The browsers are where  you’ll usually discover logic and errors. Some browsers are more helpful than  others when it comes to finding and fixing problems.    Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  81  Debugging JavaScript on IE  Microsoft Internet Explorer has unpredictable behavior when it comes to  JavaScript errors. IE6 will take you to some type of editor, but the editors  have changed over the years, and are modified  without your knowledge or  permission  when you installed new software. IE7 and IE8  at least by default   simply do nothing. You won’t see an error, or any indication there was an  error.  Denial — my favorite coping mechanism.    Here’s how you can force IE to give you a little bit of help:  1.  Choose Tools➪Internet Options➪Advanced.     You’ll see a dialog box that looks like Figure 4-6.               Figure 4-6:  The Internet  Options  dialog box  allows you  to get error  warnings  in Internet  Explorer.    2.  Choose “Display a Notification about Every Script Error.”     Leave all the other settings alone for now. Yep, we’re going to keep  script debugging disabled, because it doesn’t work very well. I’ll show  you a better technique later in this chapter  see the “Using the Firebug  Debugger” section .  Now, when you reload broken.html in IE, you’ll see something like  Figure 4-7.   82 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Figure 4-7:  I never  thought I’d  be happy to  see an error  message.       This is actually good news, because at least you know there’s a problem, and  you’ve got some kind of clue how to fix it. In this particular case, the error  message is pretty useful. Sometimes that’s the case, and sometimes the error  messages seem to have been written by aliens.   Be sure to have the error notification turned on in IE so you know about  errors right away. Of course, you’ll also need to check your code in Firefox,  which has tons of great tools for checking out your code.  Finding errors in Firefox  Firefox has somewhat better error-handling than IE by default, and you  can use add-ons to turn it into a debugging animal. At its default setting,  error notification is minimal. If you suspect JavaScript errors, open up the  JavaScript Errors window. You can do this by choosing Error Console from  the Tools menu, or by typing javascript: in the location bar. Figure 4-8 shows  the error console after running broken.html.  I generally find the error messages in the Firefox console more helpful than  the ones provided by IE.  The Error console doesn’t automatically clear itself when you load a new  page. When you open it up, there might be a bunch of old error messages in  there. Be sure to clear the history  with the Error Console’s Clear button  and  refresh your page to see exactly what errors are happening on this page.     Catching syntax errors with Firebug  One of the best things about Firefox is the add-on architecture. Some really  clever people have created very useful add-ons that add wonderful function- ality. Firebug is one example. This add-on  available at https:  addons. mozilla.org en-US firefox addon 1843  tremendously expands your  editing bag of tricks.    Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  83  Figure 4-8:  The Firefox  Error  Console  is pretty  useful.    Figure 4-9:  The Firebug  tool shows  an error.  Click the  error line  to see it in  context.          Firebug  first introduced in Chapter 1  is useful for HTML and CSS editing,  but it really comes into its own when you’re trying to debug JavaScript code.  When Firebug is active, it displays a little icon at the bottom of the browser  window. If there are any JavaScript errors, a red error icon will appear. Click  this icon, and the Firebug window appears, describing the problem. Figure  4-9 shows how it works.  If you click the offending code snippet, you can see it in context. This can  be useful, because the error might not be on the indicated line. Generally,  if I’m doing any tricky JavaScript, I’ll have Firebug turned on to catch any  problems.   84 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   The Firebug Lite version of Firebug can be used in other browsers  IE, Chrome,  and Safari . This version is accessed as a bookmarklet, meaning you can put  a link to the code in your bookmarks and use this program to get most of the  features of Firebug in these other browsers. Check http:  getfirebug. com lite.html for details.     Catching Logic Errors  The dramatic kind of error you see in broken.html is actually pretty easy to  fix. It crashes the browser at a particular part of the code, so you get a good  idea what went wrong. Crashes usually result in error messages, which gen- erally give some kind of clue about what went wrong. Most of the time, it’s  a problem with syntax. You spelled something wrong, forgot some punctua- tion, or something else pretty easy to fix once you know what’s wrong.   Loops and branches often cause a more sinister kind of problem, called a  logical error  as opposed to a syntax error . Logical errors happen when your  code doesn’t have any syntax problems, but it’s still not doing what you  want. These errors can be much harder to pin down, because you don’t get  as much information.  Of course, if you have the right tools, you can eventually track down even the  trickiest bugs. The secret is to see exactly what’s going on inside your vari- ables — stuff the user usually doesn’t see.  Logging to the console with Firebug  Firebug has another nifty trick: You can send quick messages to the Firebug  console. Take a look at log.html:                <![CDATA[          from log.html          note this program requires firebug on firefox              for  i = 1; i <= 5; i++ {         console.log i ;       }    end for loop                another loop with a fancier output       for  i = 1; i <= 5; i++ {         console.log “i is now %d.”, i ;       }           Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  85        console.info “This is info” ;       console.warn “This is a warning” ;       console.error “This is an error” ;                ]]>        This code is special, because it contains several references to the console  object. This object is only available to Firefox browsers with the Firebug  extension installed. When you run the program with Firebug and look at the  Console tab, you’ll see something like Figure 4-10.  The console object allows you to write special messages that will only be  seen by the programmer in the console. This is a great way to test your code  and see what’s going on, especially if things aren’t working the way you want.  If you want to test your code in IE, there’s a version of Firebug  called Firebug  Lite  that works on other browsers. Check the Firebug main page to download  and install this tool if you want to use console commands on these browsers.  Note that the syntax for using the console might be a bit different when you’re  using Firebug Lite. Check the main site for details.     Figure 4-10:  The Firebug  console  shows lots  of new  information.        86 Part I: Programming with JavaScript               Looking at console output  Here’s how it works:  ✓ The first loop prints the value of i to the console. Each time through   the first loop, the console.log function prints out the current value of  i. This would be very useful information if  for example  the loop wasn’t  working correctly. You can use the console.log   method to print the  value of any variable.   ✓ The second loop demonstrates a more elaborate kind of printing.   Sometimes you’ll want to make clear exactly what value you’re sending  to the console. Firebug supports a special syntax called formatted print- ing to simplify this process.          console.log “i is now %d.”, i ;  The text string “i is now %d” indicates what you want written in the  console. The special character %d specifies that you will be placing a  numeric variable in this position. After the comma, you can indicate the  variable you want inserted into the text. There are other formatting characters you can use as well. %s is for  string, and %o is for object. If you’re familiar with printf in C, you’ll  find this technique familiar.    ✓ You can specify more urgent kinds of logging. If you want, you can      use alternatives to the console.log if you want to impart more  urgency in your messages. If you compare the code in log.html  with the output of Figure 4-10 you’ll see how info, warning, and error  messages are formatted.  When your program isn’t working properly, try using console commands to  describe exactly what’s going on with each of your variables. This will often  help you see problems and correct them.  When you get your program working properly, don’t forget to take the console  commands out! Either remove them or render them ineffective with comment  characters. The console commands will cause an error in any browser that  does not have Firebug installed. Typically, your users will not have this exten- sion  nor should they need it! You’ve debugged everything for them! .     Using an Interactive Debugger  Traditional programming languages often feature a special debugging tool for  fixing especially troubling problems. A typical debugger has these features:    Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  87              ✓ The capability to pause a program as it’s running: Logic errors are  hard to catch because the program keeps on going. With a debugger,  you can set a particular line as a breakpoint. When the debugger encoun- ters the breakpoint, the program is in a “pause” mode. It isn’t completely  running, and it isn’t completely stopped.  ✓ A mechanism for moving through the code a line at a time: You can  normally step through code one line at a time checking to see what’s  going on.  ✓ A way to view the values of all variables and expressions: It’s usually   important to know what’s happening in your variables.  For example,  is a particular variable changing when you think it should?  A debugger  should let you look at the values of all its variables.  ✓ The capability to stop runaway processes: As soon as you start creating   loops, you’ll find yourself accidentally creating endless loops. In a typi- cal browser, the only way out of an endless loop is to kill the browser  with the task manager  or process manager in some operating systems .  That’s a bit drastic. A debugger can let you stop a runaway loop without  having to access the task manager.  Debuggers are extremely handy, and they’ve been very common in most  programming languages. JavaScript programmers haven’t had much access  to debugging tools in the past, because the technical considerations of an  embedded language made this difficult.  Fortunately, Firebug and Aptana both have interactive debuggers that pro- vide all these features. Even better, they work together to provide you lots of  useful help.  Aptana has a debugger built in. Originally, this involved a special Firefox  plugin that sent information back to Aptana. The developers of Firebug and  Aptana are now working together to give Firebug the ability to work directly  with Aptana. When you use the Aptana debugger, it works automatically with  Firebug.     To test the debuggers, I wrote a program with a deliberate error that would  be hard to find without a debugger:          <![CDATA[         from debug.html         has a deliberate error               var i = 0;       var j = 0;       while  i <= 10 {         console.log i ;         j++;       }    end while          ]]>         88 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   This is another version of the endless.html program from earlier in this  chapter. You might be able to see the problem right away. If not, stay tuned;  you’ll see it as you run the debugger. Even if you can tell what’s wrong, follow  along so you can learn how to use the debugger when you need it.  I used console.log   for output in this program just to avoid jumping back  and forth from the browser to the editor to handle dialog boxes.     To step through a program using the Aptana debugger, begin by loading the  file into the debugger.  Adding a breakpoint  So far your JavaScript programs have been pretty small, but they’re going to  get much larger. You usually won’t want to start the line-by-line debugging  from the beginning, so you need to specify a breakpoint. When you run a pro- gram in Debug mode, it runs at normal speed until it reaches a breakpoint —  and then it pauses so you can control it more immediately.  To set a breakpoint, right-click a line number in the code editor.  Figure 4-11 shows me setting a breakpoint on line 12 of the debug.html  code.  Running the debugger  The debugger requires you to run your program in a different way than you  might be used to. Since your program is normally run by the browser  not  Aptana , somehow you need a mechanism for passing information back from  the browser to Aptana.   1.  Start the debugger by clicking the Debug icon.    It looks like a little bug.  2.  Install the Aptana Firefox plugin automatically.    When you debug a JavaScript program for the first time, Aptana asks  permission to install an additional Firefox plugin. Click Yes to complete  the installation. You will only need to do this once.  3.  Switch to the Debug perspective.    Aptana pops up a message box to ask whether you want to switch to  the Debug perspective. Answer Yes to change Aptana  temporarily  to  Debug configuration.                  Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  89  A breakpoint has been added to line 12.  Figure 4-11:  Use a  breakpoint  to tell the  debugger  where to  pause.             Using the Debug perspective  When Aptana is used for debugging, it introduces a new layout  called a per- spective in Aptana . This changes the way the screen looks, and optimizes the  editor for debugging mode. Figure 4-12 shows the debug.html program in  Debug perspective.  The Debug perspective changes the editor to emphasize debugging:  ✓ The code completion window is gone. This feature isn’t needed when  you’re debugging, so it’s removed. You need the screen space for other  goodies.  ✓ The file management window is also missing. Likewise, you won’t be  doing a lot of file manipulation in Debug mode, so this window is gone  too.  Don’t worry; you’ll get it back when you return to normal edit  mode.    90 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   The Debug panel  The variables panel  Figure 4-12:  Aptana  looks a little  different  in Debug  perspective.                Results of console commands  The ordinary code window where you can set waypoints.  ✓ You have a new debug window. This window shows your active   threads. The most important thing about it is the buttons along the top. ✓ You also have a window showing breakpoints and variables. This pow-  erful new window describes the values of all your variables while the  program is running.  ✓ Most of the other windows are the same. You still have the code   window, console, and outline window, but they are rearranged a little  differently than normal. Of course you can adjust them if you wish.  Once you’ve got the debug mode running one time, you’ll have a little Debug  icon in the upper right of the Aptana interface. When this quick button is  available, you can use it to switch into Debug mode. Use the Aptana button to  move back to ordinary editing mode.       Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  91  Examining Debug mode  with a paused program  When you run your code through the debugger, Aptana fires up a new  instance of Firefox, and loads your program into it. When your program is  paused for debugging, you’ll see a few new details, shown in Figure 4-13.  When your program is paused, you can see several important new indicators:  ✓ The Debug window shows which script is active. Right now your   programs have only one script, but later you’ll have more. The thread  window tells you which script currently has the processor’s attention. ✓ The buttons in the Debug window are active. Mouse over each of the  new buttons to see their tooltips. I explain these buttons in the upcom- ing section on stepping through your code.  Suspend  Terminate  Resume  Step Into           Figure 4-13:  You get a  few new  buttons  and tools  when you’re  debugging a  program.     92 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                                     ✓ The Breakpoints panel has more panes. In addition to the breakpoints   and variables panes, you’ll see some new panes, expressions, and  scripts.   ✓ The Variables panel lets you see all the variables the page knows   about. Even though this program contains only two explicitly defined  variables, there seems to be a lot more than that. Every JavaScript pro- gram has a whole bunch of special variables built in.  I explain how to  use this panel later in this chapter.   ✓ The Breakpoints panel allows you to manage your breakpoints. This   is a good place for you to see all of the breakpoints in your project. You  can enable or disable a breakpoint from this panel.  ✓ The Expressions panel allows you to follow particular variables or   expressions. It’s an extremely powerful tool. I demonstrate its use later  in this chapter.  ✓ The current line of code is highlighted. If you set a breakpoint on line  12, you’ll see that line highlighted.  It might be difficult to see in Figure  4-13.  As you move through the code, you’ll see this highlight move. This  will help you to follow the logic.  In some versions of Aptana, a message that starts TypeError: request. loadGroup has no properties appears sometimes when you are debug- ging a program. This is not an error in your code, and it doesn’t seem to cause  any problems. You can safely ignore this error. I’ve also run across a “socket  connection” error once in a while. Normally you can restart Firefox to fix this  problem.     Walking through your program  Here’s the best part. You can run your program in super slow-mo, seeing  every aspect of its behavior.   1.  Take a step.    Click on the Step Into button on the Debug panel.  It looks like a curved  arrow pointing between two dots, or just use the F5 key.    2.  Look at the code.    The highlighting has moved to the next line  line 13 .  3.  Mouse over the variables.    Hover your mouse pointer over the two variables  i and j  in your code.  You’ll see a dialog box that describes the current value of each variable.  4.  Take a few more steps.    Use the Step Into button a few more times. Watch as the highlight moves  through the program, looping.    Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  93            5.  Check the variables again.    Take another look at the variables after a few times through the loop,  and you’ll begin to see what’s wrong with this code: j is increasing, but  i is still stuck at 0.  6.  Stop the debug session.    If you think you understand the problem, you can stop the debug ses- sion with the red square Terminate button.  You’ll need to do that in  this program, because it’s an endless loop. It will never end on its own.   Aptana will close down the generated Firefox instance.  If the debugger isn’t acting properly, be sure you’ve set a breakpoint. If you  don’t have a breakpoint, the program won’t stop. Also, be sure you’ve used  the Debug button to start the program. Using the Run program or viewing the  page directly in the browser won’t activate the debugger.     Viewing expression data  The whole point of debugging is to find difficult problems. Usually, these  problems are variables that aren’t doing what you expect. Aptana provides  a Variables tab, which shows the value of all variables in a program, but it’s  surprisingly difficult to use. JavaScript programs come bundled with hun- dreds of variables. If you dig around, you can eventually find the i and j vari- ables.  Scroll down in the variables panel to find them.  Every time you take  another step, you have to scroll down again to see the values, or mouse over  the variables in the code.  Fortunately, Aptana provides a much easier way. Select a variable with  the mouse and right-click. In the resulting menu, choose Watch. Figure  4-14 shows the debugger after I’ve chosen to watch both variables and run  through the loop a few times.  In this mode, you can see the exact values of the variables you’ve chosen to  track. When the variable changes value, you can see it happen immediately.  The Expression window has one more cool trick: You can use it to watch  complex expressions, not just variables. In this program, you want to know  why the loop isn’t exiting. Highlight the condition  i <= 10  and add it to  the watch expressions just as you did the variables.  Now step through the program watching the variables and the condition. With  all this information available to you, my coding mistake becomes obvious: I  used the variable i in the condition, but I never changed it inside the loop.  Instead, I changed the value of j, which has nothing at all to do with the loop!   94 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Displays the value of any expression or variable  Figure 4-14:  The ex- pressions  window  highlights  the  variables  I’m inter- ested in.       Hover the mouse over a variable name while the program is  paused to see the current value of the variable.  Whenever you encounter a program that isn’t doing what you want, fire up  the debugger, watch the critical values, and step through the code a line at a  time. This will often help you find even the most difficult errors.  Using the Firebug debugger  The Aptana debugger is very good, but I’ve found it to be a bit cranky. It com- plains if the version of Firebug isn’t exactly right, and sometimes it gives you  trouble with other extensions. Fortunately, Firebug has a debugger that’s just  as good as Aptana  except for one notable limitation . Figure 4-15 shows the  Firebug debugger in action.    Chapter 4: Loops and Debugging  95  Add a breakpoint to Firebug’s script panel.  Watch panel  Figure 4-15:  The Firebug  debugger is  very similar  to the one in  Aptana.                         The currently running line is highlighted.  Firebug’s debugger works in the same general way as the Aptana debugger.  Here’s how to use it:  1.  Open up the suspect file in Firefox.    Of course, you’ll need to load up the file before you do so.   2.  Open the Firebug   tag.    You might need to enable scripts for local files.  3.  Set a breakpoint.    Click the line number where you want the breakpoint to go. A red dot  will appear, indicating the breakpoint.  4.  Reload the page.    Use the F5 key or reload button to reload the page in debug mode.   96 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                  5.  Watch the page pause at the breakpoint.    As with the Aptana debugger, you’re placed in a pause mode with the  program resting at the breakpoint.  6.  Use the Step Into and Step Over buttons to move through the code.    The Firebug debugger has the same Step Into and Step Over buttons as  the Aptana debugger. Use them to walk through your code one line at  a time.  7.  Type in a variable name or condition in the watch expression menu.   This allows you to track any particular variables or conditions that are  giving you trouble.  The Firebug debugger is very easy to use, but it has one significant flaw:  It can only be used after a program has loaded into memory. If a program  immediately goes into an endless loop  as endless.html in this chapter  does , the program never stops executing and you never get access to the  debug sessions.   Most JavaScript programs are written in a way that prevents this problem   look at Chapter 6 for information on how to pre-load JavaScript code .  However, you might not be able to debug every program you encounter using  the Firebug debugger.  Of course, you don’t necessarily need a debugger at all. JavaScript debuggers  are relatively new, and people have been writing JavaScript without them for  years. You can always do it the old-fashioned way: good old alert   state- ments. If you’re not sure what’s going on in your code, alert every variable to  see its value. Of course, don’t forget to remove the alert   statements when  you’re done.      Chapter 5  Functions, Arrays, and Objects  In This Chapter ▶ Making code manageable with functions ▶ Passing parameters into functions ▶ Returning values from functions ▶ Examining functions and variable scope ▶ Producing basic arrays ▶ Retrieving data from arrays ▶ Building a multi-dimensional array ▶ Creating custom objects with properties and methods ▶ Building object constructors ▶ Building JSON data structures  It doesn’t take long for your code to become complex. Soon enough, you’ll   find yourself wanting to write more sophisticated programs. When things   get larger, you need new kinds of organizational structures to handle the  added complexity.   You can bundle several lines of code into one container and give this new  chunk of code a name. That’s called a function. You can also take a whole  bunch of variables, put them into a container, and give it a name. That’s  called an array.   This chapter shows you how to work with more code and more data — in the  form of functions and arrays — without going crazy.  Breaking Code into Functions  It doesn’t take long for code to get complicated. It would be good to have  some sort of tool for managing the complexity and making code easier to  handle. That’s exactly what a concept called functions does for you.    98 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Inviting ants to the picnic  To explain functions better, think back to an old campfire song. Figure 5-1  re-creates this classic song for you in JavaScript format.  You might want to  roast a marshmallow while you view this program.   Figure 5-1:  Nothing  reminds me  of functions  like a clas- sic campfire  song.       If you’re unfamiliar with this song, it simply recounts the story of a bunch of  ants. The littlest one apparently has some sort of attention issues  but we  love him anyway . During each verse, the little one gets distracted by some- thing that rhymes with the verse number. The real song typically has ten  verses, but I’m just doing two for the demo.  Thinking about song  and program   structure  Before you look at the code, think about the structure of the song. Like many  songs, it has two main parts. The chorus is a phrase repeated many times  throughout the song. The song has several verses, which are similar to each  other, but not quite identical.   Think about the song sheet passed around the campfire.  I’m getting hungry  for a s’more.  The chorus is usually listed only one time, and each verse is  listed. Sometimes you’ll have a section somewhere on the song sheet that  looks like this:  Verse 1 Chorus Verse 2 Chorus    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  99  Musicians call this thing a “road map,” and that’s a great name for it. It’s a  higher-level view of how you progress through the song. In the road map,  you don’t worry about the details of the particular verse or chorus. The road  map shows the big picture, and you can look at each verse or chorus for the  details.  Building the antsFunction.html program  Take a look at the code for antsFunction.html and see how it resembles a  song sheet:                <![CDATA[         from antsFunction.html              function chorus   {         var text = “...and they all go marching down\n”;         text += “to the ground \n”;         text += “to get out \n”;         text += “of the rain. \n”;         text += “ \n”;         text += “boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom   \n”;          alert text ;       }    end chorus              function verse1  {         var text = “The ants go marching 1 by 1 hurrah,           text += “The ants go marching 1 by 1 hurrah,           text += “The ants go marching 1 by 1 \n”;         text += “ The little one stops to suck his thumb           alert text ;       }    end verse1              function verse2  {         var text = “The ants go marching 2 by 2 hurrah,           text += “The ants go marching 2 by 2 hurrah,           text += “The ants go marching 2 by 2 \n”;         text += “ The little one stops to tie his shoe   hurrah \n”;  hurrah \n”;  \n”;  hurrah \n”;  hurrah \n”;  \n”;          alert text ;       }    end verse1          100 Part I: Programming with JavaScript           main code       verse1  ;       chorus  ;       verse2  ;       chorus  ;                ]]>                       The program code breaks the parts of the song into the same pieces a song  sheet does. Here are some interesting features of antsFunction.html:  ✓ I created a function called chorus  . Functions are simply collections   of code lines with a name.  ✓ All the code for the chorus goes into this function. Anything I want to  do as part of printing out the chorus goes into the chorus   function.  Later, when I want to print the chorus, I can just call the chorus   func- tion and it will execute all the code I stored there.   ✓ Each verse has a function, too. I broke the code for each verse into its   own function as well.  ✓ The main code is a road map. After all the details are delegated to the   functions, the main part of the code just controls the order in which the  functions are called.  ✓ Details are hidden in the functions. The main code handles the big pic- ture. The details  how to print the chorus or verses  are hidden inside  the functions.  Functions are a very useful tool for controlling complexity. You can take a  large, complicated program and break it into several smaller pieces. Each  piece stands alone and solves a specific part of the overall problem.   You can think of each function as a miniature program. You can define vari- ables in functions, put loops and branches in there, and do anything else you  can do with a program. A program using functions is basically a program full  of subprograms.  When you have your functions defined, they’re just like new JavaScript com- mands. In a sense, when you add functions, you’re adding your own new com- mands to JavaScript.     Passing Data into and out of Functions  Functions are logically separated from the main program. This is a good  thing, because this separation prevents certain kinds of errors. Sometimes,  however, you want to send information into a function. You might also want     Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  101  a function to return some type of value. The antsParam.html page rewrites  the “Ants” song in a way that takes advantage of function input and output:                <![CDATA[         from antsParam.html  I’m not providing a figure showing this program because it looks just like  antsFunction.py to the user. That’s one of the advantages of functions:  You can improve the underlying behavior of a program without imposing a  change in the user’s experience. Here’s what the code looks like now:           function chorus   {         var text = “...and they all go marching down\n”;         text += “to the ground \n”;         text += “to get out \n”;         text += “of the rain. \n”;         text += “ \n”;         text += “boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom   \n”;          return text;       }    end chorus              function verse verseNum {         var distraction = “”;         if  verseNum == 1 {           distraction = “suck his thumb.”;         } else if  verseNum == 2 {           distraction = “tie his shoe.”;         } else {           distraction = “I have no idea.”;         }                  var text = “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum + “ hurrah,           text += “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum + “ hurrah,   hurrah \n”;  hurrah \n”;          text += “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum;         text += “ the little one stops to “;         text += distraction;         return text;       }    end verse1                     main code       alert verse 1  ;       alert chorus   ;       alert verse 2  ;       alert chorus   ;                ]]>         102 Part I: Programming with JavaScript         There are a couple of important new ideas in this code  keep in mind that  this is just the overview — specifics are coming in the next few sections :  ✓ These functions return a value. The functions don’t do their own alert   statements any more. Instead, they create a value and return it to the  main program.  ✓ There’s only one verse function. Because the verses are all pretty simi- lar, it makes sense to have only one verse function. This improved func- tion needs to know what verse it’s working on to handle the differences.  Examining the main code  The main code has been changed in one significant way. In the last program,  the main code called the functions, which did all the work. This time, the  functions don’t actually do the output themselves. Instead, they collect infor- mation and pass it back to the main program. Inside the main code, each  function is treated like a variable.   You’ve seen this behavior before: The prompt   method returns a value.  Now the chorus   and verse   methods also return values. You can do  anything you want to this value, including printing it out or comparing it to  some other value.  It’s often considered a good idea to separate the creation of data from its use  as I’ve done here. That way you have more flexibility. After a function creates  some information, you can print it to the screen, store it on a Web page, put it  in a database, or whatever.     Looking at the chorus line  The chorus has been changed to return a value. Take another look at the  chorus   function to see what I mean:        function chorus   {         var text = “...and they all go marching down\n”;         text += “to the ground \n”;         text += “to get out \n”;         text += “of the rain. \n”;         text += “ \n”;         text += “boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom   \n”;          return text;       }    end chorus    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  103                          Here’s what changed:  ✓ The purpose of the function has changed. The function is no longer   designed simply to output some value to the screen. Instead, it now pro- vides text to the main program, which can do whatever it wants with the  results.  ✓ There’s a variable called text. This variable will contain all the text to   be sent to the main program.  This was true before, but it’s even more  important now.   ✓ The text variable is concatenated over several lines. I used string   concatenation to build a complex value. Note the use of newlines  \n  to  force carriage returns.  ✓ The return statement sends text back to the main program. When  you want a function to return some value, simply use return followed  by a value or variable. Note that return should be the last line of the  function.  Handling the verses  The verse   function is quite interesting: To make the verse so versatile   get it? — VERSE-atile! , it must take input from the primary program and  return output. It has these features:  ✓ It’s more flexible than the previous functions. The same function can   be used to produce many different verses.  ✓ It takes input to determine which verse to print. The road map sends a   verse number to the function.  ✓ It modifies the verse based on the input. The verse umber is used to   determine how the rest of the verse should be created.  ✓ It returns a value, just as chorus   does. The output of this function is  passed back to the main program so it can do something with the newly  minted verse.  Passing data to the verse   function First, notice that the verse   function is always called with a value inside  the parentheses. For example, the main program says verse 1  to call the  first verse, and verse 2  to invoke the second. The value inside the paren- theses is called an argument.   104 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   The verse   function must be designed to accept an argument. Look at the  first line and you’ll see how I did it:        function verse verseNum {  I included a variable name, verseNum, in the function definition. Inside the  function, this variable is known as a parameter.  Don’t get hung up on the  terminology. People often use the terms “parameter” and “argument” inter- changeably.  The important idea is this: Whenever the verse   function is  called, it automatically has a variable called verseNum. Whatever argument  you send to the verse   function from the main program will become the  value of the variable verseNum inside the function.  You can define a function with as many parameters as you want. Each param- eter gives you the opportunity to send a piece of information to the function.  Determining the distraction If you know the verse number, you can determine what distracts “the little  one” in the song. There are a couple of ways to do this, but a simple if    else if structure is sufficient for this example:          var distraction = “”;         if  verseNum == 1 {           distraction = “suck his thumb.”;         } else if  verseNum == 2 {           distraction = “tie his shoe.”;         } else {           distraction = “I have no idea.”;         }  Here I initialized the variable distraction to be empty. If verseNum is 1,  set distraction to “suck his thumb.” If verseNum is 2, distraction  should be “tie his shoe”. Any other value for verseNum is treated as an  error by the else clause.  If you’re an experienced coder, you might be yelling at the program. I know, it  still isn’t optimal. Later in this chapter, I show an even better solution for han- dling this particular situation with arrays.       Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  105  By the time this code segment is complete, there is a legitimate value for  both verseNum and distraction.  Creating the text After you know these variables  verseNum and distraction , it’s pretty  easy to construct the output text:          var text = “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum + “ hurrah,           text += “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum + “ hurrah,   hurrah \n”;  hurrah \n”;          text += “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum;         text += “ the little one stops to “;         text += distraction;         return text;       }    end verse1  There’s a whole lotta concatenatin’ going on, but it’s essentially the same  code as the original verse   function. This one’s just a lot more flexible,  because it can handle any verse.  Well, it can if the function has been pre- loaded to understand how to handle the particular verse number. More on  that soon.   Managing Scope  A function is much like an independent mini-program. Any variable you  create inside a function only has meaning inside that function. When the  function finishes executing, its variables disappear! This is actually a really  good thing. A major program will have hundreds of variables. They can be  very difficult to keep track of. It’s possible to re-use a variable name without  knowing it, or have a value changed inadvertently. When you break your  code into functions, each function has its own independent set of variables.  You don’t have to worry about whether the variables will cause problems  elsewhere.   106 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Introducing local and global variables  You can also define variables at the main  script  level. These variables are  considered global variables. A global variable is available at the main level  and inside each function. A local variable  one defined inside a function  has  meaning only inside the function. The concept of local-versus-global func- tions is sometimes referred to as scope.  Local variables are kind of like local police who have a limited geographical  jurisdiction, but are very useful within that space. They know the neighbor- hood. Sometimes you’ll encounter situations that cross local jurisdictions.  This is the kind of situation that requires a state trooper or the FBI. Local  variables are local cops, and global variables are the FBI.   In general, try to make as many of your variables local as possible. The only  time you really need a global variable is when you want some information to  be used in multiple functions.     Examining variable scope  To understand the implications of variable scope, take a look at scope. html:                <![CDATA[         from scope.html       var globalVar = “I’m global!”;              function myFunction  {         var localVar = “I’m local”;         console.log localVar ;       }              myFunction  ;                ]]>        This program defines two variables. globalVar is defined in the main code,  and localVar is defined inside a function. If you run the program in Debug  mode while watching the variables, you can see how they behave. Figure 5-2  shows what the program looks like early in the run.    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  107  Note that localVar doesn’t have meaning until the function is called,  so it remains undefined until the computer gets to that part of the code.  Step ahead a few lines, and you’ll see localVar has a value, as shown in  Figure 5-3.  Be sure to use the Step Into technique for walking through a program rather  than Step Over for this example. When Step Over encounters a function, it  runs the entire function as one line. If you want to look into the function and  see what’s happening inside it  as you do here , use Step Into. Please look at  Chapter 4 if you need a refresher on using debugging modes.     globalVar has a value, but localVar does not because the program   has not yet reached the funtion containing localVar.  Figure 5-2:  Here  globalVar is  defined, but  localVar  is not.       Control has not been passed to the function yet.   108 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Be sure to step into a function to see what’s going on instead of stepping over the function.  Step Over  Step Into  The global variable still has  meaning and the local variable has a value.  Figure 5-3:  Behold!  localVar has  a value —  because I’m  inside the  function.        Program Control is now inside the function.  Note that globalVar still has a value — and so does localVar, because it’s  inside the function.  If you move down the code a few more steps, you’ll find that localVar no  longer has a value when the function ends. This is illustrated in Figure 5-4.  Variable scope is a good thing because it means you only have to keep track  of global variables and the variables defined inside your current function.  The other advantage of scope is that you can re-use a variable name. You  can have ten different functions all using the same variable name and they  won’t interfere with each other, because each one is an entirely different  variable.    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  109  Now the local variable has no meaning because its function is no longer in memory.  Figure 5-4:  When the  function  ends, once  again local- Var has no  meaning.        Control has moved again outside the function.  Building a Basic Array  If a function is a group of code lines with a name, an array is similar; it’s a  group of variables with a name. An array is actually a special kind of variable  used to manage complexity. Use an array whenever you want to work with a  list of similar data types.   Storing a list of data in an array  The following code shows a basic demonstration of arrays:                <![CDATA[         from genres.html                      creating an empty array       var genre = new Array 5 ;          110 Part I: Programming with JavaScript           storing data in the array       genre[0] = “flight simulation”;       genre[1] = “first-person shooters”;       genre[2] = “driving”;       genre[3] = “action”;       genre[4] = “strategy”;                returning data from the array       alert  “I like “ + genre[4] + “ games.” ;                ]]>         The variable genre is a special variable, because it contains many different  values. In essence, it is a list of game genres. The new Array 5  construct  creates space in memory for five variables, all named genre.   Accessing array data  After you’ve specified an array, you can work with the individual elements  using square brace syntax. Each element of the array is identified by an inte- ger. The index usually begins with 0:         genre[0] = “flight simulation”;  This line means: Assign the text value “flight simulation” to the genre  array variable at position 0.  Most languages require that all array elements be the same type. JavaScript  is very forgiving about this. You can combine all kinds of stuff in a JavaScript  array. This can sometimes be very useful, but be aware this trick won’t work  in all languages. In general, I try to keep all the members of an array the same  type. Don’t forget that array indices usually start with 0.     After you’ve got the data stored in the array, you can use the same square- bracket syntax to read the information.  The line         alert  “I like “ + genre[4] + “ games.” ;  means “find element 4 of the genre array, and include it in an output  message.”  When genre.html is run, it shows what you see in Figure 5-5.    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  111  Figure 5-5:  This data  came from  an array.                Using arrays with for loops  The main reason to use arrays is for convenience. When you have a lot of  information in an array, you can write code to work with the data quickly.  Whenever you have an array of data, you commonly want to do something  with each element in the array. Take a look at games.html to see how this  can be done:                <![CDATA[         from games.html          pre-loading an array       var gameList = new Array “Flight Gear”,   “Sauerbraten”,             “Future Pinball”, “Racer”, “TORCS”, “Orbiter”,            “Step Mania”, “NetHack”,           “Marathon”, “Crimson Fields” ;              var text = “”;           for  i = 0; i < gameList.length; i++ {         text += “I love “ + gameList[i] + “\n”;       }    end for loop       alert text ;                ]]>        This code has some noteworthy things about it:  ✓ It features an array called gameList. This array contains the names of   some of my favorite freeware games.  ✓ The array is pre-loaded with values. If you provide a list of values when  creating an array, JavaScript simply pre-loads the array with the values  you indicated. It isn’t necessary to specify the size of the array if you  pre-load it.  ✓ A for loop steps through the array. Arrays and for loops are natural   companions. The for loop steps through each element of the array.   112 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   ✓ The array’s length is used in the for loop condition. Rather than speci-  fying the value 10, I used the length property of the array in my for  loop. This is good, because the loop will automatically adjust to the size  of the array if I add or remove elements.  ✓ It does something with each element. Because i goes from 0 to 9  and   these are they array indices , I can easily print out each value of the  array. In this example, I simply add to an output string.  ✓ Note the newline characters. The \n combination is a special character.   It tells JavaScript to add a carriage return  which is like pressing the  Enter key .   When games.html runs, it looks like Figure 5-6.  If you want to completely ruin your productivity, you might want to Google  some of these game names shown in Figure 5-6. They are absolutely incred- ible, and every one of them is free. It’s hard to beat that.  See, even if you don’t  learn how to program in this book, you get something good out of it!                   Figure 5-6:  Now I’ve  got a list  of games.  Arrays  and loops  are fun!    Visiting the ants one more time  Just when you got that ant song out of your head, take a look at one more  variation. This one uses arrays and loops to simplify the code even more!                <![CDATA[         from antsArray.html              var distractionList = new Array “”, “suck his   thumb”, “tie his shoe” ;               function chorus   {         var text = “...and they all go marching down\n”;         text += “to the ground \n”;         text += “to get out \n”;         text += “of the rain. \n”;         text += “ \n”;    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  113          text += “boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom   \n”;          return text;       }    end chorus              function verse verseNum {           pull distraction from array         var distraction = distractionList[verseNum];                  var text = “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum + “ hurrah,           text += “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum + “ hurrah,   hurrah \n”;  hurrah \n”;          text += “The ants go marching “;          text += verseNum + “ by “ + verseNum;         text += “ the little one stops to “;         text += distraction;         return text;       }    end verse1                     main code is now a loop       for  verseNum = 1; verseNum < distractionList.  length; verseNum++ {         alert verse verseNum  ;         alert chorus   ;       }    end for loop                ]]>         This code is just a little different from the antsParam program shown  earlier.  ✓ It has an array called distractionList. This array is  despite the   misleading name  a list of distractions. I made the first one  element 0   blank so the verse numbers would line up properly  ✓ The verse   function looks up a distraction. Because distractions   are now in an array, the verseNum can be used as an index to loop up  a particular distraction. Compare this function to the verse   function  in antsParam. Although arrays require a little more planning than code  structures, they can highly improve the readability of your code. ✓ The main program is in a loop. I step through each element of the   distractionList array, printing out the appropriate verse and chorus.   ✓ The chorus   function remains unchanged. There’s no need to   change chorus  .               114 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Working with Two-Dimensional Arrays  Arrays are useful when working with lists of data. Sometimes you’ll encoun- ter data that’s best imagined in a table. For example, consider if you wanted  to build a distance calculator that determines the distance between two  cities. The original data might look like Table 5-1.  Table 5-1   Distances between Major Cities  0  Indianapolis 1  New York 2  Tokyo 3  London  0  Indianapolis 0 648 6476 4000  1  New York 648 0 6760 3470  2  Tokyo 6476 6760 0 5956  3  London 4000 3470 5956 0  Think about how you would use this table to figure out a distance. If you  wanted to travel from New York to London, for example, you’d pick out the  New York row and the London column and figure out where they intersect.  The data in that cell is the distance  3,470 miles .  When you look up information in any kind of a table you’re actually working  with a two-dimensional data structure. That’s a fancy term, but it just means  “table.” If you want to look something up in a table, you need two indices, one  to determine the row, and another to determine the column.  If this is difficult to grasp, think of the old game “Battleship.” The playing field  is a grid of squares. You announce “I-5”  meaning “column I, row 5”  and your  opponent looks in that grid to discover that you’ve sunk his battleship. In  programming, typically you use integers for both indices, but otherwise it’s  exactly the same: Any time you have two-dimensional data, you access it with  two indices.  Often we call these indices row and column to help you think of the  structure as a table. Sometimes there are better names that more clearly  describe how the behavior works. Take a look at Figure 5-7 and you’ll see  that the distance.html program asks for two cities and returns a dis- tance according to the data table.  Yep, it’s possible to have 3-, 4-, and n-dimension arrays in programming, but  don’t worry about that yet.  It might make your head explode.  Most of the  time, 1 or 2 dimensions are all you need.       Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  115  Figure 5-7:  It’s a “Tale  of Two  Cities.” You  even get the  distance  between  them!       This program is a touch longer than some of the others, so I break it into  parts for easy digestion. Be sure to look at the program in its entirety on  either of the companion Web sites: www.dummies.com go javascript andajaxfd or www.aharrisbooks.net jad.  Setting up the arrays  The key to this program is the data organization. The first step is to set up  two arrays, and it looks like this:                <![CDATA[         from distance.html                cityName has the names of the cities       cityName = new Array “Indianapolis”, “New York”,   “Tokyo”, “London” ;          create a 2-dimension array of distances       distance = new Array           new Array  0, 648, 6476, 4000 ,         new Array  648, 0, 6760, 3470 ,         new Array  6476, 6760, 0, 5956 ,         new Array  4000, 3470, 5956, 0         ;   116 Part I: Programming with JavaScript      The first array is an ordinary single-dimension array of city names. I’ve been  careful to always keep the cities in the same order, so whenever I refer to city  0, I’m talking about Indianapolis  my home town.  New York is always going  to be at position 1, and so on.   In your data design, take care that you always keep things in the same order.  Be sure to organize your data on paper before you type it into the computer,  so you’ll understand what value goes where.  The cityNames array has two jobs. First, it reminds me what order all the  cities will be in, and secondly, it gives me an easy way to get a city name when I  know an index. For example, I know that cityName[2] will always be “Tokyo.”  The distance array is very interesting. If you squint at it a little bit, it looks a  lot like Table 5-1. That’s because it is Table 5-1, just in a slightly different format.  Keep in mind that distance is an array. JavaScript arrays can hold just  about everything, including other arrays! That’s what distance does: It  holds an array of rows. Each element of the distance array is another   unnamed  array holding all the data for that row. If you want to extract infor- mation from the array, you need two pieces of information. First you need the  row. Then, because the row is an array, you need the column number within  that array. So distance[1][3] means. “Go to row one  New York  of the  array named distance. Within that row, go to element 3  London  and  return the resulting value  3470 .” Cool, huh?  Getting a city  The program requires that you ask for two cities. You want the user to enter  a city number, not a name, and you want to do this twice. This sounds like a  good time for a function:        function getCity  {            presents a list of cities and gets a number   corresponding             to the city name         var theCity = “”;    will hold the city number                var cityMenu = “Please choose a city by typing a   number: \n”;          cityMenu += “0  Indianapolis \n”;         cityMenu += “1  New York \n”;         cityMenu += “2  Tokyo \n”;         cityMenu += “3  London \n”;                theCity = prompt cityMenu ;         return theCity;       }    end getCity    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  117  Here the getCity   function prints up a little menu of city choices, and asks  for some input. It then returns that input.  There’s all kinds of ways to improve getCity  . For one thing, maybe it  should repeat until you get a valid number, so that users can’t type in the city  name or do something else crazy. I’ll leave it simple for now. The next chapter  shows you how to use the elements of a user interface to help the user submit  only valid input.     Creating a main   function  The main   function handles most of the code for the program. Here’s what  that looks like:       function main  {         var output = “”;         var from = getCity  ;         var to = getCity  ;         var result = distance[from][to];         output = “The distance from “ + cityName[from];         output += “ to “ + cityName[to];         output += “ is “ + result + “ miles.”;         alert output ;       }    end main        main  ;  In this code, the main   function controls traffic. Here’s how it works:  1.  Create an output variable.    The point of this function is to create some text output describing the  distance. I begin by creating a variable called output and setting its ini- tial value to empty.  2.  Get the city of origin.    Fortunately, you’ve got a really great function called getCity   that  handles all the details of getting a city in the right format. Call this func- tion and assign its value to the new variable from.  3.  Get the destination city.    That getCity   function sure is handy. Use it again to get the city  number you’ll call to.  4.  Get the distance.    Because you know two indices, and you know they’re in the right format,  you can simply look them up in the table. Look up distance[from] [to] and store it in the variable result.                       118 Part I: Programming with JavaScript                  5.  Output the response.    Use concatenation to build a suitable response string and send it to the  user.  6.  Get city names from the cityNames array.    The program uses numeric indices for the cities, but these don’t mean  anything to the user. Use the cityNames array to retrieve the two city  names for the output.  7.  Run the main   function.    There’s only one line of code that’s not in a function. That line calls the  main   function and starts the whole thing up.  I didn’t actually write the program in the order in which I showed it to you.  Sometimes it makes more sense to go “inside out” with your programming,  and that was the case here: I actually created the data structure first  as an  ordinary table on paper  and then constructed the main   function. This  made it obvious that I needed a getCity   function, and gave me some clues  about how getCity should work  that is, it should present a list of cities and  then prompt for a numerical input .  Creating Your Own Objects  So far, you’ve used a lot of wonderful objects in JavaScript — but that’s  just the beginning. It turns out you can build your own objects too, and  these objects can be very powerful and flexible. Objects typically have two  important components: properties and methods. A property is like a variable  associated with an object. It describes the object. A method is like a function  associated with an object. It describes things the object can do.   Functions allow you to put code segments together; arrays allow you to put  variables together; objects allow you to put both code segments and variables   and in fact functions and arrays  in the same large construct.   Building a basic object  JavaScript makes it trivially easy to build an object. Because a variable can  contain any value, you can simply start treating a variable like an object and  it becomes one.  Figure 5-8 shows a critter that has a property.          Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  119  Figure 5-8:  This alert  box is actu- ally using an  object.                                Take a look at the following code:      from basicObject.html     create the critter   var critter = new Object  ;      add some properties   critter.name = “Milo”;   critter.age = 5;  The way it works is not difficult to follow:  1.  Create a new object.      view property values   alert “the critter’s name is “ + critter.name + “.” ;    JavaScript has a built-in object called Object. Make a variable with the  new Object   syntax, and you’ll build yourself a shiny new standard  object.  2.  Add properties to the object.     A property is like a subvariable. It’s nothing more than a variable  attached to a specific object. When you assign a value to critter. name, for example, you’re specifying that critter has a property called  name and you’re also giving it a starting value. 3.  An object can have any number of properties.    Just keep adding properties. This allows you to group a number of vari- ables into one larger object.  4.  Each property can contain any type of data.    Unlike arrays — in which it’s common for all the elements to contain  exactly the same type of data — each property can have a different type.  5.  Use the dot syntax to view or change a property.    If the critter object has a name property, you can use critter. name as a variable. Like other variables, you can change the value by  assigning a new value to city.name or you can read the content of  the property.   120 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   If you’re used to a stricter object-oriented language like Java, you’ll find  JavaScript’s easy-going attitude quite strange and maybe a bit sloppy. Other  languages do have a lot more rules about how objects are made and used, but  JavaScript’s approach does have its charms. Don’t get too tied up in the differ- ences. The way JavaScript handles objects is powerful and refreshing.  Adding methods to an object  Objects have other characteristics besides properties. They can also have  methods. A method is simply a function attached to an object. To see what  I’m talking about, take a look at this example:      create the critter     from addingMethods.html   var critter = new Object  ;      add some properties   critter.name = “Milo”;   critter.age = 5;      create a method   critter.talk = function  {     msg = “Hi! My name is “ + this.name;     msg += “ and I’m “ + this.age;     alert msg ;   };    end method       call the talk method   critter.talk  ;  This example extends the critter object described in the last section. In  addition to properties, the new critter has a talk   method. If a prop- erty describes a characteristic of an object, a method describes something  the object can do. Figure 5-9 illustrates the critter showing off its talk    method.  Figure 5-9:  Now the  critter can  talk!    Here’s how it works:  1.  Build an object with whatever properties you need.    Begin by building an object and giving it some properties.               Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  121                           2.  Define a method much like a property.    In fact, methods are properties in JavaScript, but don’t worry too much  about that — it’ll make your head explode.  3.  You can assign a pre-built function to a method.    If you’ve already created a function that you want to use as a method,  you can simply assign it.  4.  You can also create an anonymous function.     More often, you’ll want to create your method right away. You can  create a function immediately with the function  { syntax.  5.  The this keyword refers to the current object.     Inside the function, you might want to access the properties of the  object. this.name refers to the name property of the current object.  6.  You can then refer to the method directly.     After you’ve defined an object with a method, you can invoke it. For  example, if the critter object has a talk   method, use critter. talk   to invoke this method.  Building a re-usable object  These objects are nice, but what if you want to build several objects with  the same definition? JavaScript supports an idea called a constructor, which  allows you to define an object pattern and re-use it.  Here’s an example:    building a constructor   from constructor.html function Critter lName, lAge {   this.name = lName;   this.age = lAge;   this.talk = function  {     msg = “Hi! My name is “ + this.name;     msg += “ and I’m “ + this.age;     alert msg ;   }    end talk method }    end Critter class def  function main  {     build two critters    critterA = new Critter “Alpha”, 1 ;   122 Part I: Programming with JavaScript     critterB = new Critter “Beta”, 2 ;   critterB.name = “Charlie”;   critterB.age = 3;      have ‘em talk   critterA.talk  ;   critterB.talk  ;  }    end main     main  ;  This example involves creating a class  a pattern for generating objects  and  re-using that definition to build two different critters. First, look over how the  class definition works:  1.  Build an ordinary function.    JavaScript classes are defined as extensions of a function. The function  name will also be the class name. Note that the name of a class function  normally begins with an uppercase letter. When a function is used in this  way to describe an object, the function is called the object’s construc- tor. The constructor can take parameters if you wish, but it normally  does not return any values. In my particular example, I add parameters  for name and age.  2.  Use this to define properties.     Add any properties you want, including default values. Note that you’ll  be able to change those values later if you like. Each property should  begin with this and a period, so if you want your object to have a  color property, you’d say something like this.color = “blue”;.  My example uses the local parameters to define the properties. This is  a very common practice, because it’s an easy way to pre-load important  properties.  3.  Use this to define any methods you want.     If you want your object to have methods, define them using the this  operator followed by the function  { keyword. You can add as many  functions as you want.     The way JavaScript defines and uses objects is easy but a little nonstandard.  Most other languages that support object-oriented programming do it in a  different way than the technique described here. Some would argue that  JavaScript is not a true OOP language, as it doesn’t support a feature called  inheritance, but instead uses a feature called prototyping. The difference isn’t  all that critical; most uses of OOP in JavaScript are very simple objects like the  ones described here or JSON, described later in this chapter. Just appreciate  that the introduction to object-oriented programming here is very cursory,  but enough to get you started.                   Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  123  Using your shiny new objects  When you’ve defined a class, you can re-use it. Look again at the main func- tion to see how I use my newly minted Critter class:  function main  {     build two critters    critterA = new Critter “Alpha”, 1 ;    critterB = new Critter “Beta”, 2 ;   critterB.name = “Charlie”;   critterB.age = 3;      have ‘em talk   critterA.talk  ;   critterB.talk  ;  }    end main     main  ;  After a class is defined, you can use it as a new data type. This is a very pow- erful capability. Here’s how it works:  1.  Be sure you have access to the class.    A class isn’t useful unless JavaScript already knows about it. In this  example, the class is defined within the code.  2.  Create an instance of the class with the new keyword.     The new keyword means you want to make a particular critter based  on the definition. Normally you’ll assign this to a variable. My construc- tor expects the name and age to be supplied, so it automatically creates  a critter with the given name and age.  3.  Modify the class properties as you want.     You can change the values of any of the class properties. In my example,  I change the name and age of the second critter just to show how it’s  done.   4.  Call class methods.    Because the Critter class has a talk   method, you can use it when- ever you want a particular critter to talk.                       124 Part I: Programming with JavaScript   Introducing JSON  JavaScript objects and arrays are incredibly flexible. In fact, they are so well- known for their power and ease of use, that a special data format called JSON   JavaScript Object Notation  has now been adopted by many other languages.   JSON is mainly used as a way to store complex data  especially multi- dimension arrays  and pass the data from program to program. JSON is  essentially another way of describing complex data in a JavaScript Object  format. When you describe data in JSON, you generally do not need a con- structor, because the data itself is used to determine the structure of the  class.  JSON data is becoming a very important part of Web programming, because  it allows an easy mechanism for transporting data between programs and  programming languages. Throughout this book  especially in the sections  on AJAX and the jQuery library , you’ll see JSON used extensively to manage  complex data easily.  Storing data in JSON format  To see how JSON works, begin by looking at this simple code fragment:      var critter = {       “name”: “George”,       “age”: 10     };  This code describes a critter with two properties, a name and an age. The  critter looks much like an array, but rather than using a numeric index  as  most arrays do , the critter has string values to serve as indices. It is, in  fact, an object.  You can refer to the individual elements with a variation of array syntax, like  this:  You can also use what’s called dot notation  as used in objects,  like this:  alert critter[“name”] ;  alert critter.age ;  Both notations work in the same way. Most of the built-in JavaScript objects  use the dot notation, but either is acceptable.    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  125                              The reason JavaScript arrays are so useful is that they are in fact objects.  When you create an array in JavaScript, you are building an object with  numerical property names. This is why you can use either array or object  syntax for managing JSON object properties.  Look at jsonDistance.html on my Web site  www.aharrisbooks.net  jad  to see the code from this section in action. I don’t show a figure here,  because all the interesting work happens in the code.         Here’s how to store data in JSON notation:  1.  Create the variable.    You can use the var statement like you do any variable.  2.  Contain the content within braces {} .     This is the same mechanism you use to create a pre-loaded array  as  described earlier in this chapter .  3.  Designate a key.     For the critter, I want the properties to be named “name” and “age” —  that is, with words rather than numeric indices. For each property, I begin  with the property name. The key can be a string or an integer.  4.  Follow the key with a colon  : .     The key is followed by the colon character.  5.  Create the value associated with that key.     You can then associate any type of value you want with the key. In this  case, I associate the value “George” with the key “name”.  6.  Separate each name value pair with a comma  , .    You can add as many name value pairs as you want.  If you’re familiar with other programming languages, you might think of a  JSON structure as being like a hash table or associative array. JavaScript does  use JSON structures in the same way these other structures are used, but it  isn’t quite accurate to say JSON is either a hash or an associative array. It’s  simply an object.  But if you want to think of it as one of those things, I won’t  tell anybody.      Building a more complex JSON structure  JSON is convenient because it can be used to handle quite complex data  structures. For example, look at the following  oddly familiar  data structure  written in JSON format:   126 Part I: Programming with JavaScript       var distance = {       “Indianapolis” :         { “Indianapolis”: 0,           “New York”: 648,           “Tokyo”: 6476,           “London”: 4000 },                  “New York” :          { “Indianapolis”: 648,           “New York”: 0,           “Tokyo”: 6760,           “London”: 3470 },        “Tokyo” :         { “Indianapolis”: 6476,           “New York”: 6760,           “Tokyo”: 0,           “London”: 5956 },        “London” :         { “Indianapolis”: 4000,           “New York”: 3470,           “Tokyo”: 5956,           “London”: 0 },     };                      This data structure is another way of representing the distance data used to  describe two-dimension arrays. This is another two-dimension array, but it is  a little different than the one previously described.  ✓ distance is a JSON object. The entire data structure is stored in a  single variable. This variable is a JSON object with name value pairs.  ✓ The distance object has four keys. These correspond to the four rows   of the original chart.   ✓ The keys are actual city names. The original 2D array used numeric   indices, which are convenient but a bit artificial. In the JSON structure,  the indices are the actual city names.  ✓ The value of each entry is another JSON object. The value of a JSON   element can be anything, including another JSON object. Very complex  relationships can be summarized in a single variable.   ✓ Each row is summarized as a JSON object. For example, the value asso- ciated with “Indianapolis” is a list of distances from Indianapolis to  the various cities.  ✓ The entire declaration is one “line” of code. Although placed on sev-  eral lines in the editor  for clarity , the entire definition is really just one  line of code.    Chapter 5: Functions, Arrays, and Objects  127  Setting up the data in this way seems a bit tedious, but it’s very easy to work  with. The city names are used directly to extract data, so you can find the  distance between two cities with array-like syntax:      alert distance[“Indianapolis”][“London”] ;   If you prefer, you can use the dot syntax:       alert distance.Indianapolis.Tokyo ;  You can even go with some kind of hybrid:      alert distance[“London”].Tokyo ;      JSON has a number of important advantages as a data format:  ✓ It is self-documenting. Even if you see the data structure on its own   without any code around it, you can tell what it means.  ✓ The use of strings as indices makes the code more readable. It’s much  easier to understand distance[“Indianapolis”][“London”] than  to decipher distance[0][3].  ✓ JSON data can be stored and transported as text. This turns out to   have profound implications for Web programming, especially in AJAX   the techniques described elsewhere in this book .  ✓ JSON can describe complex relationships. The example shown here  is a simple two-dimension array, but the JSON format can be used to  describe much more complex relationships — including complete  databases.  ✓ Many languages support JSON format. Many Web languages now offer  direct support for JSON. The most important of these is PHP, which is  very frequently used with JavaScript in AJAX applications.  ✓ JSON is more compact than XML. Another data format called XML is   frequently used to transmit complex data. However, JSON is more com- pact and less “wordy” than XML.  ✓ JavaScript can read JSON natively. Some kinds of must be translated   before they can be used. As soon as your JavaScript program has access  to JSON data, it can be used directly.   You might wonder whether you can embed methods in JSON objects. The  answer is yes, but this isn’t usually done when you’re using JSON to transport  information. In Part III of this book about AJAX, you’ll see that methods are  often added to JSON objects to serve as callback functions, but that usage  won’t make sense until you get more familiar with events. To get a start on  that, flip to Chapter 14.                           128 Part I: Programming with JavaScript    Part II  Using JavaScript   to Enhance  Your Pages   In this part . . .  JavaScript was developed as a language for manipulat-  ing Web pages. Use this part to learn how JavaScript   interacts directly with the Web page.  Chapter 6 describes the powerful Document Object  Model, and how this mechanism lets your JavaScript pro- grams interact with the Web page. You’ll learn how to lis- ten for button events, and how to change parts of the  page on the fly.  Chapter 7 describes ways to get more reliable input. First  you learn how to use specialized user interface elements  like list boxes and radio buttons. Secondly, you learn how  to use regular expressions to ensure the value of text  fields is in the correct format.  Chapter 8 teaches how to animate your page. You learn  how to move page elements around on the page under  user or program control. You learn how to animate ele- ments and how to pre-load images for more efficient ani- mation. You also learn how to read the keyboard and  mouse.   Chapter 6  Talking to the Page  In This Chapter ▶ Introducing the Document Object Model ▶ Responding to form events ▶ Connecting a button to a function ▶ Retrieving data from text fields ▶ Changing text in text fields ▶ Sending data to the page ▶ Working with other text-related form elements ▶ Viewing the source of dynamically generated code  JavaScript is fun and all, but it lives in Web browsers for a reason: to let   you change Web pages. The best thing about JavaScript is how it helps   you control the page. You can use JavaScript to read useful information from  the user and to change the page on the fly.   Understanding the Document  Object Model  JavaScript programs usually live in the context of a Web page. The contents  of the page are available to the JavaScript programs through a mechanism  called the Document Object Model  DOM .   The DOM is a special set of complex variables that encapsulate the entire  contents of the Web page. You can use JavaScript to read from the DOM and  determine the status of an element. You can also modify a DOM variable and  change the page from within JavaScript code.   132 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Navigating the DOM  The easiest way to get a feel for the DOM is to load up a page in Firefox and  look at the Firebug window’s DOM tab. I do just that in Figure 6-1. In order to  see what’s happening with the DOM, I’m using the Firebug extension. Check  back to Chapter 1 if you need a refresher on using Firebug. Note also that  some versions of Firebug  especially on the Mac  are slightly different, but  the general idea is the same.  When you look over the DOM of a very simple page, it’s easy to get over- whelmed. You’ll see a lot of variables listed. Technically, these are all ele- ments of a special object called window. The window object has a huge  number of subobjects, all listed in the DOM view. Table 6-1 describes a few  important window variables.  Primary DOM Objects  Table 6-1  Variable document  location  Description Represents XHTML page Describes current URL  history  A list of recently visited pages  status  The browser status bar  Notes Most commonly scripted element. Change location.href to move to a  new page. Access this to view previous  pages. Change this to set a message in  the status bar.  Changing DOM properties with Firebug  To illustrate the power of the DOM, try this experiment in Firefox:  1.  Load any page.     It doesn’t matter what page you work with. I’ll use simple.html, a very  basic page with only an   header.  2.  Enable the Firebug extension.    You can play with the DOM in many ways, but the Firebug extension is  one of the easiest and most powerful tools for experimentation.  3.  Enable the DOM tab.    This shows you a list of all the top-level variables.                   Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  133  Figure 6-1:  Even a  simple page  has a com- plex DOM.                         You can view the DOM and interact with it in real time.  4.  Scroll down until you see the status element.    When you find the status element, double-click it.  5.  Type in a message to yourself.    In a dialog box that appears, type something in and press Enter.  6.  Look at the bottom of the browser.     The status bar at the bottom of the browser window should now contain  your message!  7.  Experiment on your own.     Play around with the various elements in the DOM list. Many of them  can be modified. Try changing window.location.href to any URL  and watch what happens.  Don’t worry — you can’t permanently break  anything here.     This DOM experiment doesn’t always work. You might have extensions that  block the DOM, or it might not do exactly what you want. If this experiment  does not work, just move on. You’ll never really do it this way again. Once you  learn how easy it is to manipulate the DOM through code, that’s the only way  you’ll want to do it.   134 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                                      Examining the document object  If the window object is powerful, its offspring — the document object — is  even more amazing.  Once again, the best way to get a feel for this thing is to do some exploring:  1.  Reload simple.html again.    If your previous experiments caused things to get really weird, you  might have to restart Firefox. Be sure the Firebug extension is showing  the DOM tab.  2.  Find the document object.     This is usually early in the window list. When you select document, it  expands, showing a huge number of child elements.  3.  Look for the document.body.     Somewhere in the document you’ll see the body. Select this to see what  you discover.  4.  Find the document.body.style.     The document object has a body object, and the body object has a  style subobject. Will it never end? 5.  Look through the style elements.     Some of the styles will be unfamiliar, but keep going and you’ll see some  old friends.  6.  Double-click backgroundColor.     Each CSS style attribute has a matching  but not quite identical  coun- terpart in the DOM. Wow. Type a new color  using a color name or hex  color  and see what happens.  7.  Marvel at your cleverness.     You can navigate the DOM to make all kinds of changes in the page. If  you can manipulate something here, you can write code to do it to.  If you’re lost here, Figure 6-2 shows me modifying the backgroundColor of  the style of the body of the document  on a wing on a bird on a branch on  a tree in a hole in the ground . A figure can’t really do this process justice,  though. You have to experiment for yourself. But don’t be overwhelmed. You  don’t really need to master the details of exactly how the Firebug DOM stuff  works. Just know it’s there, because it’s the foundation of all the cool stuff  you do next.     Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  135  Harnessing the DOM through JavaScript  Sure, using Firebug to trick out your Web page is geeky and all, but why  should you care? The whole purpose of the DOM is to provide JavaScript  magical access to all the inner workings of your page.   Getting the blues, JavaScript-style  It all gets to be fun when you start to write JavaScript code to access the  DOM. Take a look at blue.html in Figure 6-3.  Figure 6-2:  Firebug lets  me modify  the DOM  of my page  directly.        Figure 6-3:  This page is  blue  trust  me, it is .  But where’s  the CSS?        136 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Shouldn’t it be “background-color?”  If you’ve dug through the DOM-style elements,  you’ll notice some interesting things. For open- ers, many of the element names are familiar  but not quite identical: background-color  becomes backgroundColor and font- weight becomes fontWeight. CSS uses  dashes to indicate word breaks, and the DOM   combines  words  and  uses  capitalization  for  clarity. You’ll find all your old favorite CSS ele- ments, but the names change according to this  very  predictable  formula.  Still,  if  you’re  ever  confused, just use the Firebug DOM inspector  to look over various style elements.  The page has white text on a blue background, but there’s no CSS! Instead, it  has a small script that changes the DOM directly, controlling the page colors  through code. The script looks like this:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >      blue.html                 I’ve got the JavaScript Blues                <![CDATA[           use javascript to set the colors       document.body.style.color = «white»;       document.body.style.backgroundColor = «blue»;          ]]>              In the first few chapters of this book I concentrated on JavaScript without  worrying at all about the HTML. The HTML code in those programs was unim- portant, so I didn’t include it in the code listings. This chapter is about how  to integrate code with HTML, so now I incorporate the HTML as well as the        Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  137  JavaScript segments. Sometimes I still print out code in separate blocks, so  as  always  try to look at the code in its natural habitat, on either of the compan- ion Web sites  www.aharrisbooks.net jad or www.dummies.com go  javascriptandajaxfd  through your browser.  Writing JavaScript code to change colors  The page is pretty simple, but it has a few new features:  ✓ It has no CSS. A form of CSS will be dynamically created through the   code.  ✓ The script is in the body. I can’t place this particular script in the   header, because it refers to the body.  When the browser first sees the script, there must be a body for the text  to change. If I put the script in the head, there is no body yet when the  browser reads the code, so it gets confused. If I place the script in the  body, then there is a body, so the script can change it.  It’s really okay if  you don’t get this nuance at first. This is probably the only time you’ll see  this particular trick, because I’ll show a better way in the next example.      ✓ Use a DOM reference to change the style colors. That long “trail of   breadcrumbs” syntax takes you all the way from the document through  the body to the style and finally to the color. It’s tedious but thorough. ✓ Set the foreground color to white. You can change the color property  to any valid CSS color value  a color name or a hex value . It’s just like  CSS, because you are affecting the CSS.  ✓ Set the background color to blue. Again, this is just like setting CSS.                    Managing Button Events  Of course, there’s no good reason to write code such as blue.html. It’s just  as easy to build CSS as it is to write JavaScript. The advantage comes when  you use the DOM dynamically to change the page’s behavior after it has fin- ished loading.  Figure 6-4 shows a page called “backgroundColors.html”.  The page is set up with the default white background color. It has two but- tons on it, which should change the body’s background color. Click the blue  button, and you’ll see that it works, as verified in Figure 6-5.   138 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Figure 6-4:  The page is  white with  two buttons.  I’ve gotta  click blue.    Figure 6-5:  It turned  blue! Joy!            Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  139              Again, the color change isn’t very convincing in a black-and-white book. You  should be able to tell from the figures that the color did indeed change, but  look on the Web site for real color-changing action. Some really exciting  things just happened:  ✓ The page has a form. If you need a refresher on form elements, please  check out Bonus Chapter 1 on either of the companion Web sites  www. dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd or www.aharrisbooks. net jad .  ✓ The button does something. Plain old XHTML forms don’t really do any- thing; you’ve got to write some kind of programming code to accomplish  that. This program does something before your eyes.  ✓ There’s a setColor   function. The page has a function that takes a   color name and applies it to the background style.  ✓ Both buttons pass information to the setColor   function. The color   name will be passed as a parameter to the setColor   function.  Setting up the playground  That’s an overview. Take a closer look at the code:   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=»EN» dir=»ltr» xmlns=»http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml»>          <meta http-equiv=”content-type” content=”text xml;   charset=utf-8”  >       backgroundColors                <![CDATA[          from backgroundColors              function changeColor color {         document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;       }    end changeColor                ]]>             140 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages            Click a button to change the color                        <input type = “button”                value = “blue”                onclick = “changeColor ‘blue’ ” >                       <input type = “button”                value = “white”                onclick = “changeColor ‘white’ ”  >                                           Most Web pages actually treat the XHTML page as the user interface and the  JavaScript as the event-manipulation code that goes underneath. It makes  sense, then, to look at the HTML code that acts as the playground first.   ✓ It contains a form. Note that the form’s action attribute is still empty.  You won’t mess with that until you work with the server in Chapter 14. ✓ The form has a fieldset. The input elements need to be inside some-  thing, and a fieldset seems like a pretty natural choice.  ✓ The page has two buttons. The two buttons on the page are nothing   new, but they’ve never done anything before.  ✓ The buttons both have onclick attributes. This special attribute can   accept one line of JavaScript code. Usually that line calls a function, as I  have done in this program.  ✓ Each button calls the same function, but with a different parameter.   Both buttons call changeColor  , but one sends the value “blue” and  the other “white”.   ✓ Presumably, changeColor will change a color. That’s exactly what it   will do. In fact, it will change the background color.  Generally I write the XHTML code first before the script. As you can see,  the form provides all kinds of useful information that will help me make the  script. Specifically, it’s clear that I need to write a function called change- Color  , this function should take a color name as a parameter, and should  change the background to the indicated color. With that kind of information  established, the function is half-written!                      Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  141  Embedding quotes within quotes  Take a careful look at the onclick lines. There’s one important issue you  might not have noticed: onclick is an XHTML parameter, and its value must  be encased in quotes. The parameter happens to be a function call that sends  a string value. String values must also be in quotes. This could be very con- fusing if you used double quotes everywhere, because the browser has no  way to know the quotes are nested. If your code looks like this . . .                  onclick = “changeColor “white” ”  >  . . . then XHTML will think the onclick parameter contains the value  “changeColor ” and it will have no idea what white” ” is.   Fortunately, JavaScript has an easy fix for this problem: If you want to embed  a quote inside another quote, just switch to single quotes. The line is written  with the parameter inside single quotes:                 onclick = “changeColor ‘white’ ”  >  Writing the changeColor function  The changeColor   function is pretty easy to write. Voilá . . .                 <![CDATA[          from backgroundColors              function changeColor color {         document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;       }    end changeColor                ]]>        It goes in the header area as normal. It’s simply a function accepting one  parameter called color. The body’s backgroundColor property is set to  color.  This time I can write JavaScript in the header that refers to the body because  the header code is all in a function. The function is read before the body is in  place, but it isn’t activated until the user clicks the button. By this time, there’s  a body — and there’s no problem.       142 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Interacting with Text Input and Output  Perhaps the most intriguing application of the DOM is the ability to let the  user communicate with the program through the Web page, without all those  annoying dialog boxes. Figure 6-6 shows a page with a Web form containing  two text boxes and a button.   Figure 6-6:  I’ve typed a  name into  the top  text box.    Figure 6-7:  I got a  greeting!  With no  alert box!                   When you click the button, something exciting happens, as demonstrated by  Figure 6-7.  Clearly, form-based input and output are preferable to the constant interrup- tion of dialog boxes.   Introducing event-driven programming  Graphic user interfaces usually use a technique called event-driven program- ming. The idea is simple:   1.  Create a user interface.    In Web pages, the user interface is usually built of XHTML and CSS.   2.  Identify events the program should respond to.    If you have a button, users will click it.  If you want to guarantee they  click it, put the text “launch the missiles” on the button. I don’t know  why, but it always works.  Buttons almost always have events. Some  other elements do, too.    Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  143                 3.  Write a function to respond to each event.     For each event you want to test, write a function that does whatever  needs to happen.  4.  Get information from form elements.    Now you are accessing the contents of form elements to get information  from the user. You’ll need a mechanism for getting information from a  text field and other form elements.  5.  Use form elements for output.    For this simple example, I also use form elements for output. The output  goes in a second text box, even though I don’t intend for the user to type  any text there.  Creating the XHTML form  The first step is to create the XHTML framework. Here’s the XHTML code:     textBoxes.html      <link rel = “stylesheet”           type = “text css”           href = “textBoxes.css”  >                Text Box Input and Output                         Type your name:           <input type = “text”                id = “txtName”  >                <input type = “button”                value = “click me”                 onclick = “sayHi  ” >                <input type = “text”                id = “txtOutput”  >                         As you look over the code, note a few important ideas:   144 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                        ✓ The page uses external CSS. The CSS style is nice, but it’s not important   in the discussion here. It stays safely encapsulated in its own file. Of  course, you’re welcome to look it over or change it.  ✓ Most of the page is a form. All form elements must be inside a form. ✓ A fieldset is used to contain form elements. input elements need to  be inside some sort of block-level element, and a fieldset is a natural  choice.  ✓ There’s a text field named txtName. This text field will contain the name.   I begin with the phrase txt to remind myself that this is a text box.  ✓ The second element is a button. It isn’t necessary to give the button an   ID  as it won’t be referred to in code , but it does have an onclick    event.  ✓ The button’s onclick   event refers to a  yet undefined  function.   The onclick   event is named “sayHi  ”.  ✓ A second text box will contain the greeting. This second text box is   called txtOutput because it’s the text field meant for output.  After you’ve set up the HTML page, the function becomes pretty easy to  write, because you’ve already identified all the major constructs. You know  you’ll need a function called sayHi  , and this function will read text from  the txtName field and write to the txtOutput field.  Using getElementById   to get  access to the page  XHTML is one thing, and JavaScript is another. You need some way to turn  an HTML form element into something JavaScript can read. The magical  getElementById   method does exactly that. First, look at the first two  lines of the sayHi   function  defined in the header as usual :        function sayHi  {         var txtName = document.getElementById “txtName” ;         var txtOutput = document.  getElementById “txtOutput” ;  Every element created in your Web page can be extracted by digging through  the DOM. In the old days, this is how we used to access form elements. It was  ugly and tedious. Modern browsers have the wonderful getElementById    function instead. This beauty searches through the DOM and returns a refer- ence to an object with the requested ID.    Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  145                     A reference is simply an indicator where the specified object is in memory.  You can store a reference in a variable. Manipulating this variable manipulates  the object it represents. If you want, you can think of it as making the text box  into a variable.  Note that I call the variable txtName, so its name is just like that of the origi- nal text box. This variable refers to the text field from the form, not the value  of that text field. When I have a reference to the text field object, I can use its  methods and properties to extract data from it and send new values to it.   Manipulating the text fields  When you have access to the text fields, you can manipulate the values of  these fields with the value property:          var name = txtName.value;         txtOutput.value = “Hi there, “ + name + “!”  Text fields  and in fact all input fields  have a value property. You can read  this value as an ordinary string variable. You can also write to this property,  and the text field will be updated on the fly.  This code, created by the following steps, handles the data input and output:  1.  Create a variable for the name.    This is an ordinary string variable.  2.  Copy the value of the text box into the variable.    Now that you have a variable representing the text box, you can access  its value property to get the value typed in by the user.  3.  Create a message for the user using ordinary string concatenation. 4.  Send the message to the output text box.    You can also write text to the value property, which will change the  contents of the text field on the screen.  Text fields always return string values  just as prompts do . If you want to  pull a numeric value from a text field, you might have to convert it with the  parseInt   or parseFloat   functions.      146 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages  Writing to the Document  Form elements are great for getting input from the user, but they are not  ideal for output. It really doesn’t make much sense for the output to be  placed in an editable field. It would be much better to actually change the  Web document.  The DOM supports exactly such a technique. Most XHTML elements feature  an innerHTML property. This property describes the HTML code inside the  element. In most cases, it can be read from and written to.  So what are the exceptions? Single-element tags  like   and     don’t contain any HTML, so obviously it doesn’t make sense to read or change  their inner HTML. Table elements can often be read from but not changed  directly.  Figure 6-8 shows a program with a basic form.     Figure 6-8:  Wait —  there’s no  output text  field!    Figure 6-9:  The  page has  changed  itself.          This form doesn’t have a form element for the output. Enter a name and click  the button, and you’ll see the results in Figure 6-9.  Amazingly enough, this page can make changes to itself dynamically. It isn’t  simply changing the values of form fields, but changing the HTML.    Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  147  Preparing the HTML framework  To see how this is done, begin by looking at the XHTML body for  innerHTML.html:           Inner HTML Demo                         Please type your name          <input type = “text”                id = “txtName”  >         <button type = “button”                 onclick = “sayHi  ”>           Click Me                                          Watch this space.            The code body has a couple of interesting features:              ✓ The program has a form. The form is pretty standard. It has a text field   for input and a button, but no output elements.  ✓ The button will call a sayHi   function. The page will require a func-  tion with this name. Presumably it will say hi somehow.  ✓ There’s a div for output. A div element in the main body is designated   for output.   ✓ The div has an ID. The id attribute is often used for CSS styling, but it   can also be used by the DOM.  Any HTML elements that will be dynamically scripted should have an  id field.        Writing the JavaScript  The JavaScript code for modifying inner HTML is pretty easy:                <![CDATA[         from innerHTML.html          148 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages         function sayHi  {         txtName = document.getElementById “txtName” ;         divOutput = document.getElementById “divOutput” ;          name = txtName.value;          divOutput.innerHTML = “ ” + name +  “ ”;         divOutput.innerHTML += “ is a very nice name.”;       }         ]]>        The first step  as usual with Web forms  is to extract data from the input ele- ments. Note that I can create a variable representation of any DOM element,  not just form elements. The divOutput variable is a JavaScript representa- tion of the DOM div element.   Finding your innerHTML   As with form elements, divs have other interesting properties you can  modify. The innerHTML property allows you to change the HTML code  displayed by the div. You can put any valid XHTML code you wish inside  the innerHTML property, even HTML tags. Be sure that you still follow the  XHTML rules so your code will be valid.  Even with the CDATA element in place, validators get confused by forward  slashes  like the one in the   tag . Whenever you want to use a   charac- ter in JavaScript strings, precede it with a backslash    . Doing so helps  the validator understand that you intend to place a slash character at the next  position.     Working with Other Text Elements  When you know how to work with text fields, you’ve mastered about half of  the form elements. Several other form elements work exactly like text fields,  including these:  ✓ Password fields: Recall that a password field obscures the user’s input   with asterisks, but it preserves the text.  ✓ Hidden fields: These allow you to store information in a page without  revealing it to the user.  They’re used a little bit in client-side coding,  but almost never in JavaScript.   ✓ Text areas: These are multi-line text boxes. They can be sized to handle   multiple lines of input.             Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  149  Figure 6-10 is a page with all these elements available on the same form.  When the user clicks the button, the contents of all the fields  even the pass- word and hidden field  are displayed on the bottom of the page, as illustrated  in Figure 6-11.  Figure 6-10:  Passwords,  hidden  fields, and  text areas  all look the  same to  JavaScript.       Figure 6-11:  Now you  can see  what was in  everything.        150 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Building the form  Here’s the XHTML that generates the form:           Text Input Devices                         Normal Text field          <input type = “text”                id = “txtNormal”  >          Password field          <input type = “password”                id = “pwd”  >          Hidden          <input type = “hidden”                id = “hidden”                value = “I can’t tell you”  >         <textarea id = “txtArea”                   rows = “10”                   cols = “40”> This is a big text area. It can hold a lot of text.                             <button type = “button”                 onclick = “processForm  ”>           Click Me                                                    The code should be familiar to you  look over Bonus Chapter 1 if you need  more information on form elements . A few things are worth noting for this  example:  ✓ There’s an ordinary text field. Just for comparison purposes. It has an   id so it can be identified in the JavaScript.  ✓ The next field is a password field. Passwords display asterisks, but   store the actual text that was entered. This password has an id of pwd.  ✓ The hidden field is a bit strange. Hidden fields can be used to store   information on the page without displaying that information to the user.  Unlike the other kinds of text fields, the user cannot modify a hidden  field.  She usually doesn’t even know it’s there.  This hidden field has an  id of secret and a value  “I can’t tell you” .    Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  151           ✓ The text area has a different format. The input elements are all single- tag elements, but the textarea element is designed to contain a large  amount of text, so it has beginning and end tags. The text area’s id is  txtArea.  ✓ A button starts all the fun. As usual, most of the elements just sit there  gathering data, but the button has an onclick event associated with it,  which calls a function.  ✓ External CSS gussies it all up. The page has some minimal CSS to clean  it up.  The CSS isn’t central to this discussion, so I won’t reproduce it.   Note that the page will potentially have a dl on it, so I have a CSS style  for it, even though it doesn’t appear by default.  The password and hidden fields seem secure, but they aren’t. Anybody who  views the page source will be able to read the value of a hidden field, and  passwords transmit their information in the clear. You really shouldn’t be  using Web technology  especially this kind  to transport nuclear launch codes  or the recipe of your secret sauce.  Hmmm — maybe the secret sauce recipe  is the launch code — sounds like a bad spy movie.   When I create a text field, I often suspend my rules on indentation, because  the text field preserves everything inside it, including any indentation.        Writing the function  Now all you need is a function. Here’s the good news: JavaScript treats all  these elements in exactly the same way! The way you handle a password,  hidden field, or text area is identical to the technique for a regular text field.  Here’s the code:                  <![CDATA[           from otherText.html       function processForm  {           grab input from form         var txtNormal = document.  getElementById “txtNormal” ;          var pwd = document.getElementById “pwd” ;         var hidden = document.getElementById “hidden” ;         var txtArea = document.getElementById “txtArea” ;                  var normal = txtNormal.value;         var password = pwd.value;         var secret = hidden.value;         var bigText = txtArea.value;            152 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages             create output         var result = “”         result += “  \n”;         result += “   normal  \n”;         result += “   ” + normal + “  \n”;         result += “ \n”;         result += “   password  \n”;         result += “   ” + password + “  \n”;         result += “ \n”;         result += “   secret  \n”;         result += “   ” + secret + “  \n”;         result += “   \n”;         result += “   big text  \n”;         result += “   ” + bigText + “  \n”;         result += “  \n”;                  var output = document.getElementById “output” ;         output.innerHTML = result;                }    end function   The processForm   function is a bit longer than the others in this chapter,  but it follows exactly the same pattern: It extracts data from the fields, con- structs a string for output, and writes that output to the innerHTML attribute  of a div in the page.  The code has nothing new, but it still has a few features you should consider:  ✓ Create a variable for each form element. Use the document.get  ElementById mechanism.  ✓ Create a string variable containing the contents of each element. Don’t   forget: The getElementById trick returns an object. To see what’s  inside the object, you have to extract the value property.  ✓ Make a big string variable to manage the output. When output gets   long and messy like this, concatenate a big variable and then just output  it in one swoop.  ✓ HTML is your friend. This output is a bit complex, but innerHTML con-  tains HTML, so you can use any HTML styles you want to format your  code. The return string is actually a complete definition list. Whatever  is inside the text box is  in this case  being reproduced as HTML text; if I  want carriage returns or formatting, I’ll have to add them with code. ✓ Don’t forget to escape the slashes. The validator gets confused by   ending tags, so add the backslash character to any ending tags occur- ring in JavaScript string variables    becomes   .                   Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  153                            ✓ Newline characters  \n  clean up the output. If I were writing an ordi-  nary definition list in HTML, I’d put each line on a new line. I try to make  my programs write code just like I do, so I add newline characters every- where I would add a carriage return in ordinary HTML.  Understanding generated source code  When you run the program, your JavaScript code actually changes the page  it lives on. The code that doesn’t come from your server but is created by  your program is sometimes called generated source. The generated-code  technique is powerful, but it can have a significant problem. Try the following  experiment to see what I mean:  1.  Reload the page to view it without the form contents showing.     Now view the source.   2.  Note that everything is as expected.     The source code shows exactly what you wrote.   3.  Click the Click Me button.     Your function will run, and the page will change. You clearly added HTML  to the output div, because you can see the output right on the screen.  4.  View the source again.     You’ll be amazed. The output div will be empty, even though you’ll be  able to clearly see that it has changed.  5.  Validators won’t check generated code.    Using the HTML validator extension or the w3 validator won’t check for  errors in your generated code. You have to check it yourself, but it’s  hard to see the code!  Figure 6-12 illustrates this problem.  Here’s what’s going on: The view source command  on most browsers   doesn’t actually view the source of the page as it currently stands. It goes  back to the server and retrieves the page, but displays it as source rather  than as rendered output. That means the view source command isn’t  useful for telling you how the page has changed dynamically. Likewise, the  page validators check the page as it occurs on the server without taking into  account things that could have happened dynamically.   154 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   The output div in the source code is still empty.  Figure 6-12:  The ordinary  command  to view  source isn’t  showing the  contents of  the div!             The div clearly has contents even though the source code shows it as empty!  When you were building regular Web pages, this wasn’t a problem, because  regular Web pages don’t change. Dynamically generated pages can change  on the fly, and the browser doesn’t expect that. If you made a mistake in the  HTML, you can’t simply view the source to see what you did wrong in the  code generated by your script. Fortunately, two easy solutions are available  with Firefox plugins:  ✓ The Web developer toolbar. This toolbar has a wonderful tool called   view generated source, available on the view source menu. This  allows you to view the source code of the current page in its current  state, including any code dynamically generated by your JavaScript. ✓ Firebug. Open the Firebug window when a page is open and browse    with the HTML tab  around your page. Firebug gives you an accurate  view of the page contents, even when they’re changed dynamically. This  can be extremely useful.    Chapter 6: Talking to the Page  155  These tools will keep you sane when you’re trying to figure out why your gen- erated code isn’t acting right.  I wish I’d had them years ago . . . .   Figure 6-13 shows the Firebug toolbar — with the dynamically generated con- tents showing.  The contents of the div were dynamically changed by the code.  Figure 6-13:  Firebug  shows the  current  status of  the page,  even if it’s  dynamically  modified.       The Firebug inspector shows the code as it currently exists, even if it was   modified by JavaScript code  as it was in this example .   156 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages    Chapter 7  Getting Valid Input  In This Chapter ▶ Extracting data from drop-down lists ▶ Managing multiple-selection lists ▶ Getting data from check boxes ▶ Getting information from radio groups ▶ Validating input with regular expressions ▶ Using character, boundary, and repetition operators ▶ Working with pattern memory  It’s very nice to be able to get input from the user, but sometimes users   make mistakes. It’d be great if some better ways existed to make the   user’s job easier and prevent certain kinds of mistakes.  Of course, there are tools for exactly that purpose. In this chapter, you get  the lowdown on two main strategies for improving user input: specialized  input elements and pattern-matching. Together, these tools can help you  ensure that the data the user enters is useful and valid.  Getting Input from a Drop-Down List  The most obvious way to ensure that the user enters something valid is to  supply valid choices. The drop-down list is an obvious and easy way to do this,  as you can see from Figure 7-1.  The drop-down list box approach has a lot of advantages over text-field  input:  ✓ The user can input with the mouse. This is faster and easier than   ✓ No spelling errors. That’s because the user doesn’t have to type the         typing.  response.   158 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   ✓ All answers are available. The user knows which responses are avail-  able, because they’re in a list.  ✓ You can be sure it’s a valid answer. That’s because you supplied the   possible responses.  ✓ User responses can be mapped to more complex values. For example,  you can show the user “red” and have the list box return the hex value  “FF0000”.              Figure 7-1:  The user  selects  from a pre- defined  list of valid  choices.    If you need a refresher on how to build a list box with the XHTML select  object, please refer to Bonus Chapter 2 on either of the Web sites: www. aharrisbooks.net jad or www.dummies.com go javascriptand ajaxfd.  Building the form  It’s best to create the HTML form first, because it defines all the elements  you’ll need for the function. The code is a standard form:                   Please select a color                               White             Red             Orange             Yellow             Green             Blue             Indigo             Violet                  Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  159          <input type = “button”                value = “change color”                onclick = “changeColor  ”  >                       The select object’s default behavior is to provide a drop-down list. The first  element on the list is displayed, but when the user clicks the list, the other  options appear.  A select object that will be referred to in code should have an id field.  In this and most examples in this chapter, I added external CSS styling to clean  up each form. Be sure to look over the styles on the Web sites  www.aharris books.net jad or www.dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd  if you  want to see how styling was accomplished.  The other element in the form is a button. When the button is clicked, the  changeColor   function will be triggered.  Because the only element in this form is the select object, you might want to  change the background color immediately without requiring a button press.  You can do this by adding an event handler directly onto the select object,  like this:                <select id = “selColor”                 onchange = “changeColor  ”>  This will cause the changeColor   function to be triggered as soon as the  user changes the select object’s value. Typically you only do this if select  is the only element in the form. If there are several elements, processing  doesn’t usually happen until the user signals she’s ready by clicking a button.  Reading the list box  Fortunately, standard drop-down lists are quite easy to read. Here’s the  JavaScript code:                <![CDATA[          from drop-downList.html          160 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages         function changeColor  {         var selColor = document.  getElementById “selColor” ;          var color = selColor.value;         document.body.style.backgroundColor = color;       }    end function         ]]>        As you can see, the process for reading the select object is much like work- ing with a text field:  1.  Create a variable to represent the select object.    The document.getElementById   trick works here just like it does  for text fields.  2.  Extract the value property of the select object.    The value property of the select object will reflect the value  property of the currently selected option. So, if the user has chosen  “yellow”, the value of selColor will be “FFFF00”  3.  Set the document’s background color.    Use the DOM mechanism to set the body’s background color to the  chosen value.                 Managing Multiple Selections  The select object can be used in a more powerful way: Figure 7-2 shows a  page with a multiple-selection list box. To make multiple selection work, you  have to make a few changes both to the HTML and the JavaScript code.  Figure 7-2:  You can  pick multiple  choices  from this  list.         Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  161        Coding a multiple-selection select object  You’ll have to modify the select code in two ways to make multiple  selections:  ✓ Indicate multiple selections are allowed. By default, select boxes  have only one value. You’ll need to set a switch to tell the browser to  allow more than one item to be selected.  ✓ Make it a multi-line select. The standard drop-down behavior   doesn’t make sense when you want multiple selections, because the  user has to see all the options at once. Most browsers switch into a  multi-line mode automatically — but you should control the process  directly just to be sure.  The XHTML code for multiSelect.html is similar to the drop-downList  page, but note a couple of changes:           Multiple Selections                                    Select the language s  you know.             ctrl-click to select multiple lines                    <select id = “selLanguage”                 multiple = “multiple”                 size = “10”>            XHTML             CSS             JavaScript             PHP             MySQL             Java             VB.NET             Python             Flash             perl                            <button type = «button»                 onclick = «showChoices  »>           Submit                                                                 162 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                  The code isn’t shocking, but it does have some important features to recognize:  ✓ The select object is called selLanguage. As usual, the form elements   need an id attribute so you can read it in the JavaScript.  ✓ Add the multiple = “multiple” attribute to your select object.   This tells the browser to accept multiple inputs using Shift-click  for  contiguous selections  or Control-click  for more precise selection .  ✓ Set the size to 10. The size indicates the number of lines that will be   displayed. I set the size to 10 because I have 10 options in the list.  ✓ Make a button. With multiple selection, you probably won’t want to trig- ger the action until the user has finished making selections. A separate  button is the easiest way to do this.  ✓ Create an output div. Something has to hold the response.  Writing the JavaScript code  The JavaScript code for reading a multiple-selection list box is a bit different  than the standard selection code. The value property will only return one  value, but a multiple-selection list box will often return more than one result.   The key is to recognize that a list of option objects inside a select object  is really a kind of array. You can look more closely at the list of objects to see  which ones are selected. That’s essentially what the showChoices   func- tion does:                <![CDATA[          from multi-select.html       function showChoices  {           retrieve data         var selLanguage = document.  getElementById “selLanguage” ;            set up output string         var result = “ Your Languages ”;         result += “  \n”;                    step through options         for  i = 0; i < selLanguage.length; i++ {             examine current option           currentOption = selLanguage[i];               print it if it has been selected           if  currentOption.selected == true {             result += “   ” + currentOption.value +   “  \n”;    Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  163            }    end if         }    end for loop                    finish off the list and print it out         result += “  \n”;                  output = document.getElementById “output” ;         output.innerHTML = result;       }    end showChoices         ]]>        At first the code seems intimidating, but if you break it down, it’s not too  tricky.   1.  Create a variable to represent the entire select object.    The standard document.getElementById   technique works fine:          var selLanguage = document.getElementById “selLanguage” ;  2.  Create a string variable to hold the output.    When you’re building complex HTML output, it’s much easier to work  with a string variable than to directly write code to the element:         var result = “ Your Languages ”;  3.  Build an unordered list to display the results.    An unordered list is a good way to spit out the results, so I create one in  my result variable:          result += “  \n”;  4.  Step through selLanguage as if it were an array.   Use a for loop to examine the list box line by line:           for  i = 0; i < selLanguage.length; i++ {    Note that selLanguage has a length property like an array.  5.  Assign the current element to a temporary variable.    The currentOption variable will hold a reference to the each option  element in the original select object as the loop progresses:            currentOption = selLanguage[i];                              164 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                       6.  Check to see if the current element has been selected.    Here currentOption is an object, and it has a selected property.  This property tells you if the object has been highlighted by the user.  selected is a Boolean property, so the only possible values are true  or false.            if  currentOption.selected == true {  7.  If the element has been selected, add an entry to the output list.    If the user has highlighted this object, create an entry in the unordered  list housed in the result variable:              result += “   ” + currentOption.value + “  \n”;  8.  Close up the list.    When the loop has finished cycling through all the objects, you can  close up the unordered list you’ve been building:          result += “  \n”;  9.  Print results to the output div.    The innerHTML property of the output div is a perfect place to print  out the unordered list:          output = document.getElementById “output” ;         output.innerHTML = result;  There’s something strange going on here. The options of a select box act like  an array. An unordered list is a lot like an array, which is a lot like a select box.  Bingo! They are arrays, just in different forms. Any listed data can be thought  of as an array. Sometimes you organize it like a list  for display , sometimes  like an array  for storage in memory,  and sometimes it’s a select group  for  user input . Now you’re starting to think like a programmer!  Check, Please — Reading Check Boxes  Check boxes fulfill another useful data-input function: They’re useful any time  you have Boolean data. If some value can be true or false, a check box is a  good tool. Figure 7-3 illustrates a page responding to check boxes.  It’s important to understand that check boxes are independent of each other.  Although they are often found in groups, any check box can be checked or  unchecked regardless of the status of its neighbors.          Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  165  Select as many boxes as you want.  Order Pizza button  Figure 7-3:  You can  pick your  toppings  here.  Choose as  many as  you like.       When you click the Order Pizza button, the selected output displays here.  Building the checkbox page  As usual, start by looking at the HTML:           What do you want on your pizza?                        <input type = “checkbox”                id = “chkPepperoni”                 value = “pepperoni”  >          Pepperoni                   <input type = “checkbox”                id = “chkMushroom”                 value = “mushrooms”  >          Mushrooms             166 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages           <input type = “checkbox”                id = “chkSausage”                 value = “sausage”  >          Sausage                           <button type = “button”                 onclick = “order  ”>           Order Pizza                              Your order:                          Each check box is an individual input element. Note that checkbox values  are not displayed. Instead, a label  or similar text  is usually placed after the  check box. A button calls an order   function.  Look at the labels. They each have the for attribute set to tie the label to  the corresponding check box. Although this is not required, it’s a nice touch,  because then the user can click the entire label to activate the check box.     Responding to the check boxes  Check boxes don’t require a lot of care and feeding. When you extract a  checkbox object, it has two critical properties:        ✓ The value property: Like other input elements, the value property   can be used to store a value associated with the check box.   ✓ The checked property: This property is a Boolean value, indicating   whether the check box is currently checked.  The code for the order   function shows how it’s done:                <![CDATA[         from checkBoxes.html        function order  {           get variables         var chkPepperoni = document.  getElementById “chkPepperoni” ;          var chkMushroom = document.  getElementById «chkMushroom» ;          var chkSausage = document.  getElementById “chkSausage” ;    Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  167          var output = document.getElementById «output» ;         var result = «  \n»                  if  chkPepperoni.checked {           result += « » + chkPepperoni.value + «    \n»;  \n»;          }    end if                  if  chkMushroom.checked {           result += « » + chkMushroom.value + «            }    end if                  if  chkSausage.checked {           result += « » + chkSausage.value + «    \n»;          }    end if          result += «  \n»                         output.innerHTML = result;               }    end function                      ]]>         For each check box, make sure you use both of its properties:  1.  Determine whether the check box is checked.    Use the checked property as a condition.   2.  If the box is checked, return the value property associated with the   check box.  Often in practice the value property is left out. The important thing is  whether the check box is checked. It’s pretty obvious that if chkMushroom is  checked, the user wants mushrooms, so you may not need to explicitly store  that data in the checkbox itself.        Working with Radio Buttons  Radio-button groups appear to be pretty simple, but they are more complex  than they seem. Figure 7-4 shows a page using radio-button selection.  The most important rule about radio buttons is that — like wildebeests and  power-walkers — they must be in groups. Each group of radio buttons will  have only one button active. The group should be set up so one button is  active at the very beginning, so there is always exactly one active button in  the group.          168 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Figure 7-4:  One and  only one  member  of a radio  group can  be selected  at once.       You specify the radio button group in the XHTML code. Each element of the  group can have an id attribute  although the IDs aren’t really necessary in  this application . What’s more important here is the name attribute. Look  over the code and you’ll notice something interesting: All the radio buttons  have the same name!           With what weapon will you fight the dragon?                        <input type = “radio”                name = “weapon”                id = “radSpoon”                value = “spoon”                checked = “checked”  >          Spoon                   <input type = “radio”                name = “weapon”                id = “radFlower”                value = “flower”  >          Flower                   <input type = “radio”                name = “weapon”                id = “radNoodle”                value = “wet noodle”  >          Wet Noodle          <button type = “button”                 onclick = “fight  ”>           fight the dragon                                                   Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  169           It seems a little odd to have a name attribute when everything else has an id,  but there’s a good reason. The name attribute is used to indicate the group of  radio buttons. Because all the buttons in this group have the same name . . .   ✓ All these buttons are related, and only one of them will be selected.  ✓ The browser recognizes this behavior, and automatically deselects the   other buttons in the group whenever one is selected.  ✓ I added a label to describe what each radio button means.  Very handy   for human beings such as users and troubleshooters.  Labels also  improve usability because now the user can click the label or the button  to activate the button. It’s important to preset one of the radio buttons to true with the  checked = “checked” attribute. If you fail to do so, you’ll have to add  code to account for the possibility that there is no answer at all.         Interpreting radio buttons  Getting information from a group of radio buttons requires a slightly different  technique from what you’d use for most form elements. Unlike the select  object, in this case there’s no container object that can return a simple value.  You also can’t just go through every radio button on the page, because there  could be more than one group.  Imagine, for example, a page with a multiple- choice test.    This is where the name attribute comes in. Although ids must be unique,  multiple elements on a page can have the same name. If they do, these ele- ments can be treated as an array.   Look over the code and I show how it works:                <![CDATA[          from radioGroup.html       function fight  {                  var weapon = document.getElementsByName “weapon” ;                  for  i = 0; i < weapon.length; i++ {           currentWeapon = weapon[i];                    if  currentWeapon.checked {             var selectedWeapon = currentWeapon.value;           }    end if                  }    end for            170 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages           var output = document.getElementById “output” ;         var response = “ You defeated the dragon with a   “;          response += selectedWeapon + “  \n”;         output.innerHTML = response;       }    end function                ]]>        This code looks much like other code in this chapter, but it has a sneaky  difference that emerges in these steps:  1.  Use getElementsByName to retrieve an array of elements with   this name.    Now that you’re comfortable with getElementById, I throw a monkey  wrench in the works. Note that it’s plural =— getElementsByName   Elements with an s  — because this tool is used to extract an array of  elements. It will return an array of elements  in this case, all the radio  buttons in the weapon group .  2.  Treat the result as an array.    The resulting variable  weapon in this example  is an array. As usual,  the most common thing to do with arrays is process them with loops.  Use a for loop to step through each element in the array.  3.  Assign each element of the array to currentWeapon.     This variable holds a reference to the current radio button.  4.  Check to see whether the current weapon is checked.    The checked property indicates whether any radio button is currently  checked.   5.  If the current weapon is checked, retain the value of the radio button.   If the current radio button is checked, its value will be the current value  of the group, so store it in a variable for later use.  6.  Output the results.    You can now process the results as you would with data from any other  resource.                                Working with Regular Expressions  Having the right kinds of form elements can be very helpful, but things can  still go wrong. Sometimes you have to let the user type things in, and that  information must be in a particular format. As an example, take a look at  Figure 7-5.    Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  171  Figure 7-5:  This page  is a mess.  No user  name, and  it’s not a  valid e-mail  or phone  number.                     It would be great to have some mechanism for checking input from a form to  see if it’s in the right format. This can be done with string functions, but that  can be really messy. Imagine how many if statements and string methods it  would take to enforce the following rules on this page:  1.  There must be an entry in each field.    This one is reasonably easy: Just check for non-null values.  2.  The e-mail must be in a valid format.    That is, it must consist of a few characters, an ampersand  @ , a few  more characters, a period, and a domain name of two to four characters.  That would be a real pain to check for.  3.  The phone number must also be in a valid format.    There are multiple formats, but assume you require an area code in  parentheses, followed by an optional space, followed by three digits, a  dash, and four digits. All digits must be entered as numeric characters   seems obvious, but you’d be surprised .  Although it’s possible to enforce these rules, it would be extremely difficult  to do so using ordinary string manipulation tools.  JavaScript strings have a match method, which helps find a substring inside  a larger string. This is good, but we’re not simply looking for specific text,  but patterns of text. For example, we want to know if something’s an e-mail  address  text, an @, more text, a period, and two to four more characters .   Imagine how difficult that code would be to write . . . and then take a look at  the code for the validate.html page:              function validate  {            get inputs         name = document.getElementById “txtName” .value;         email = document.getElementById “txtEmail” .value;         phone = document.getElementById “txtPhone” .value;   172 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages             create an empty error message         errors = “”;                    check name - It simply needs to exist         if  name == “” {           errors += “please supply a name \n”;         }    end if                    check email         emailRE =  ^.+@.+\..{2,4}$ ;         if  email.match emailRE  {             console.log “email match” ;             do nothing.         } else {             console.log “email not a match” ;           errors += “please check email address \n”;         }    end if                    check phone number         phoneRE =  ^\ \d{3}\  *\d{3}-\d{4} ;         if  phone.match phoneRE  {             console.log “phone matches” ;             do nothing         } else {             console.log “phone problem” ;           errors += “please check phone \n”;                 }    end phone if                    check for errors         if  errors == “” {           alert  “now processing data” ;             process the form         } else {           alert errors ;         }    end if          }    end function         I’m only showing the JavaScript code here, to save space. Look on the Web  site to see how the HTML and CSS are written.     Surprise! The code isn’t really all that difficult! Here’s what’s going on:          1.  Let the code extract data from the form in the usual way. 2.  Create a variable to hold error messages.     The error variable begins empty  because there are no errors to begin  with . As I check the code, I’ll add any error text to this variable. If there  are no errors, the error variable will remain empty.    Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  173                                               3.  Do the name check.    That should be very simple; the only way this can go wrong is to have  no name.   4.  If the name is wrong, add a helpful reminder to the error variable.   If the name isn’t there, just add a message to the error variable. We’ll  report this problem  along with any others  to the user later on.  5.  Build a pattern.    All this seems pretty simple — until you look at the line that contains  the emailRE =  ^.+@.+\..{2,4}$ ; business. It looks like a cursing  cartoonist in there. It’s a pattern that indicates whether it’s a legal e-mail  address or not. I explain in the next section how to build it, but for now  just take it on faith so you can see the big picture.  6.  Notice we’re trying to match the e-mail to emailRE.    Whatever emailRE is  and I promise I’ll explain that soon , the next  line makes it clear that we’re trying to match the e-mail address to that  thing. This turns out to be a Boolean operation. If it’s true, the e-mail  matches the pattern.    7.  Do nothing if the pattern is matched.    If the e-mail address is valid, go on with the other processing.  Note that  I originally put a console log command for debugging purposes, but I  commented that code out.   8.  If the pattern match was unsuccessful, add another error message.    The error variable accumulates all the error messages. If the match was  unsuccessful, that means the e-mail address is not in a valid format, so  we’ll add the appropriate hint to the error variable.   9.  Check the phone number.    When again, the phone number check is simple except the phoneRE  business, which is just as mysterious:  \ \d{3}\  *\d{3}-\d{4} .   Seriously, who makes this stuff up?  Again, if the match is successful,  do nothing, but if there’s a problem, add a report to the error variable.  10.  If everything worked, process the form.    The status of the error variable indicates whether there were any prob- lems. If the error variable is still empty, all the input is valid, so it’s time  to process the form.  11.  Report any errors if necessary.    If you wrote anything to the error variable, the form should not be pro- cessed. Instead, display the contents of the error variable to the user.   174 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Frequently you’ll do validation in JavaScript before you pass information to a  program on the server. This way your server program will already know the  data is valid by the time it gets there, which reduces congestion on the server.  JavaScript programs normally pass information to the server through the  AJAX mechanism, which is the focus of part three of this book.     Introducing regular expressions  Of course, the secret is to decode the mystical expressions used in the  match statements. They aren’t really strings at all, but very powerful text  manipulation techniques called regular expression parsing. Regular expres- sions have migrated from the Unix world into many programming languages,  including JavaScript. A regular expression is a powerful mini-language for  searching and replacing — text patterns in particular — even complex ones.  It’s a weird-looking language, but it has a certain charm after you get used to  reading the arcane-looking expressions.  Regular expressions are normally used with the string match   method in  JavaScript, but they can also be used with the replace   method and a few  other places.     Table 7-1 summarizes the main operators in JavaScript regular expressions.  Table 7-1  Operator  .  period   ^  $  \d  \b  Description  Any single char- acter except  newline Beginning of  string End of string Any of a list of  characters in  braces Any character in  the range Any single  numerical digit A word boundary  JavaScript Main Operators  Sample  pattern .  ^a  a$  Matches  E  Doesn’t  match \n  apple  banana  banana A  apple D  \d\d\d-\d\ d\d\d  \bthe\b  123-4567  The-thing  the  theater  [characters]  [abcABC]  [char range]  [a-zA-Z]  F  9    Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  175  Operator  Description  Sample  pattern \d+  Matches  1234  Doesn’t  match text  [a-zA-Z]\d*  B17, g  7  +  *  {digit}  \d{3}-\d{4}  123-4567  999-99-9999  {min, max}  {2,4}  ca, com,  info  watermelon   pattern  segment   ^ . .*\1$  gig,  wallow  Bobby  One or more  occurrences  of the previous  character Zero or more  occurrences  of the previous  character Repeat preced- ing character  digit times Repeat preced- ing character at  least min but  not more than  max times Store results in  pattern memory  returned with  code  Don’t memorize this table! I explain, in the rest of this chapter, exactly how it  works. Just keep this page handy as a reference.  To see an example of how this works, take a look at regex.html in Figure 7-6.  Figure 7-6:  This tool  allows  you to test  regular  expressions.       The top textbox element accepts a regular expression, and the second text  field contains text you will examine. Practice the following examples to see  how regular expressions work. They are really quite useful when you get the  hang of them. As you walk through the examples, try them out in this tester.   I’ve included it on the Web page for you, but I don’t reproduce the code here.    176 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Characters in regular expressions  The main thing you do with a regular expression is search for text. Say you  work for the bigCorp company and you ask for employee e-mail addresses.  You might make a form that only accepts e-mail addresses with the term  bigCorp in them. You could do that with the following code:  if  email.match  bigCorp   {   alert “match” ; } else {   alert “no match” ; }    end if  This is the simplest type of match. I’m simply looking for the existence of the  needle  bigCorp  in a haystack  the e-mail address stored in email  If the  text bigCorp is found anywhere in the text, then the match is true and I can  do what I want  usually I process the form on the server . More often, you’ll  want to trap for an error, and remind the user of what needs to be fixed.  Notice that the text inside the match   method is encased in forward  slashes     rather than quotes. This is important, because the text “bigCorp”  is not really meant to be a string value here. The slashes indicate that the  text is to be treated as a regular expression, which requires extra processing  by the interpreter.     If you accidentally enclose a regular expression in quotes instead of  slashes, the expression will still work most of the time. JavaScript tries  to quietly convert the text into a regular expression for you. However,  this process does not always work as planned. Do not rely on the automatic  conversion process, but instead enclose all regular expressions in slashes  rather than quotes.   Marking the beginning and end of the line  You might want to improve the search, because what you really want is  addresses that end with “bigCorp.com”. You can put a special character  inside the match string to indicate where the end of the line should be:  if  email.match  bigCorp.com$   {   alert “match” ; } else {   alert “no match” ; }    end if    Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  177  The dollar sign at the end of the match string indicates that this part of the  text should occur at the end of the search string, so andy@bigCorp.com  would match, but not “bigCorp.com announces a new Web site”.     If you’re already an ace with regular expressions, you know this example has a  minor problem, but it’s pretty picky; I’ll explain it in a moment. For now, just  appreciate that you can include the end of the string as a search parameter.  Likewise, you can use the caret character  ^  to indicate the beginning of a  string.   If you want to ensure that a text field contains only the phrase oogie  boogie  and why wouldn’t you? , you can tack on the beginning and ending  markers.  ^oogie boogie$  will only be a true match if there is nothing  else in the phrase.   Working with Special Characters  In addition to ordinary text, you can use a bunch of special character sym- bols for more flexible matching.   Matching a character with the period  The most powerful character is the period  . , which represents a single  character. Any single character except the newline  \n  will match against  the period.  This may seem silly, but it’s actually quite powerful. The expression  b.g   will match big, bag, and bug. In fact, it will match any phrase that contains b  followed by any single character then g, so bxg, b g, and b9g would also be  matches.  Using a character class  You can specify a list of characters in square braces, and JavaScript will match  if any one of those characters matches. This list of characters is sometimes  called a character class. For example, b[aeiou]g will match on bag, beg, big,  bog, or bug. This is a really quick way to check a lot of potential matches.  You can also specify a character class with a range. For example, the range  [a-zA-Z] checks all the letters but no punctuation or numerals.   178 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Specifying digits  One of the most common tricks is to look for numbers. The special character  \d represents a number  an integer digit from 0 to 9 . You can check for a  U.S. phone number  without the area code — yet  using this pattern:  \d\d\d-\d\d\d\d  This looks for three digits, a dash, and four digits.  Marking punctuation characters  You can tell that regular expressions use a lot of funky characters, like  periods and braces. What if you’re searching for one of these characters?  Just use a backslash  \  to indicate you’re looking for the actual character,  not using it as a modifier. For example, the e-mail address would be better  searched with  bigCorp\.com , because this specifies there must be a  period. If you don’t use the backslash, the regular expression tool interprets  the period as “any character” and would allow something like bigCorpucom.  Use the backslash trick for most punctuation, like parentheses, braces, peri- ods, and slashes.  If you want to include an area code with parentheses, just use backslashes to  indicate the parentheses:  \ \d\d\d\  \d\d\d-\d\d\d\d .  Finding word boundaries  Sometimes you want to know if something is a word. Say you’re searching for  the word “the,” but you don’t want a false positive on “breathe” or “theater.”  The \b character means “the edge of a word,” so  \bthe\b  will match on  “the” but not on words containing “the” inside them.  Repetition Operations  All the character modifiers refer to one particular character at a time.  Sometimes you want to deal with several characters at a time. There are sev- eral operators that help you with this process.    Chapter 7: Getting Valid Input  179  Finding one or more elements  The plus sign  +  indicates “one or more” of the preceding character, so the  pattern  ab+c  will match on abc, abbbbbbc, or abbbbbbbc, but not on ac   there must be at least one b  or on afc  it’s gotta be b .  Matching zero or more elements  The asterisk means “zero or more” of the preceding character. So  I’m  .* happy  will match on I’m happy  zero occurrences of any character  between I’m and happy . It will also match on I’m not happy  because  there are characters in between .  The .* combination is especially useful, because you can use it to improve  matches like e-mail addresses:  ^.*@bigCorp\.com$  will do a pretty good  job of matching e-mail addresses in our fictional company.  Specifying the number of matches  You can use braces  {}  to indicate the specific number of times the preced- ing character should be repeated. For example, you can re-write the phone  number pattern like this:  \ \d{3}\  *\d{3}-\d{4} . This means “three  digits in parentheses, followed by any number of spaces  zero or more , then  three digits, a dash, and four digits. Using this pattern, you’ll be able to tell if  the user has entered the phone number in a valid format.  You can also specify a minimum and maximum number of matches, so   [aeiou]{1, 3}  means “at least one and no more than three vowels.”  Now you can improve the e-mail pattern so it includes any number of charac- ters, an @ sign, and ends with a period and two to four letters:  ^.*@.*\.. {2,4}$ .  Working with Pattern Memory  Sometimes you’ll want to “remember” a piece of your pattern and re-use it.  The parentheses are used to group a chunk of the pattern and remember it.  For example,   foo {2}  doesn’t match on foo, but it does on foofoo. It’s  the entire segment that’s repeated twice.    180 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Recalling your memories  You can also refer to a stored pattern later in the expression. The pattern   ^ . .*\1$  matches any word that begins and ends with the same char- acter. The \1 symbol represents the first pattern in the string, \2 represents  the second, and so on.  Using patterns stored in memory    When you’ve finished a pattern match, the remembered patterns are still   available in special variables. $1 is the first, $2 is the second, and so on. You  can use this trick to look for HTML tags and report what tag was found: Match   ^ .* $  and then print out $1 to see what the tag was.  There’s much more to learn about regular expressions, but this basic over- view should give you enough to write some powerful and useful patterns.   Chapter 8  Moving and Grooving  In This Chapter ▶ Moving an object onscreen ▶ Responding to keyboard input ▶ Reading mouse input ▶ Running code repeatedly ▶ Bouncing off the walls ▶ Using image-swapping and compound images ▶ Reusing code ▶ Using external script files  JavaScript has a serious side, but it can be a lot of fun, too. You can easily   use JavaScript to make things move, animate, and wiggle. In this chapter,  you get to make your pages dance. Even if you aren’t interested in animation,  you should look over this chapter to find out some important ideas about  how to design your pages and your code more efficiently.  Making Things Move  You might think you need Flash or Java to put animation in your pages, but  that’s not true. You can use JavaScript to create some pretty interesting  motion effects. Begin by taking a look at Figure 8-1.   Because this chapter is about animation, most of the pages feature motion.  You really must see these pages in your browser to get the effect because a  static screen shot can’t really do any of these programs justice.  The general structure of this page provides a foundation for other kinds of  animation:        ✓ The HTML is pretty simple. As you’ll see when you pop the hood, there   really isn’t much to the HTML code. It’s a couple of divs and some  buttons.   182 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Figure 8-1:  Click the  buttons,  and the ball  moves.                      As the ball moves, its coordinates display here.  Press to move the ball.  ✓ The ball is in a special div called sprite. Game developers call the  little images that move around on the screen sprites, so I use the same  term.  ✓ The sprite div has a local style. JavaScript animation requires a   locally defined style.  ✓ The sprite div has absolute positioning. Because I want to move this  thing around on the screen, it makes sense that the sprite div is abso- lutely positioned.  ✓ The code and CSS are as modular as possible. Things can get a little   complicated when you start animating things, so I take care through this  chapter to simplify as much as I can. The CSS styles are defined exter- nally, and the JavaScript code is also imported.  ✓ Code is designed to be reused. Many of the programs in this chapter  are very similar to each other. To save effort, I’ve designed things so I  don’t have to rewrite code if possible.    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  183  Looking over the HTML  The following HTML code for the move.html program provides the basic  foundation:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       movement.html      <link rel = «stylesheet»           type = «text css»           href = «movement.css»  >                <script type = «text javascript»             src = «movement.js»>                    Click buttons to move ball              <div id = «sprite»            style = «position: absolute;            top: 100px;            left: 100px;             height: 25px;            width: 25px;» >         <img src = «ball.gif»               alt = «ball»  >                           <form action = «»           id = «controls»>                 <button type = «button»                 onclick = «moveSprite -5, 0 »>           left                   <button type = «button»                 onclick = «moveSprite 5, 0 »>           right                                     x = 100, y = 100               184 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                     You should notice a few interesting things about this code:  ✓ It has an external style sheet. Most of the CSS  the stuff that defines the   surface and the forms  is moved off-stage into an external style sheet.  Some CSS has to be defined locally, but I have made as much of the CSS  coding external as possible.      <link rel = “stylesheet”           type = “text css”           href = “movement.css”  >  ✓ The JavaScript is also outsourced. The   tag has an src  attribute, which you can use to load JavaScript code from an exter- nal file. The browser loads the specified file and reads it as though it  were directly in the code.  Note that external scripts still require a <  script> tag.  This program gets its scripts from a file called  movement.js.      <script type = “text javascript”             src = “movement.js”>        ✓ The   tag calls a method. In animation  and other advanced   JavaScript , you might have some code you want run right away. The  body has an onload event. You can feed it the name of a function  just  like you do with a button’s onclick event . In this case, I want the func- tion called init   to run as soon as the body finishes loading into the  computer’s memory.       ✓ The yellow box is a div called surface. It isn’t absolutely necessary,  but when you have something moving around on the screen, it’s nice to  have some kind of boundary so the user knows where she can move the  sprite.  ✓ There’s a sprite div inside surface. This sprite will be the thing that   actually moves around.        <div id = “sprite”            style = “position: absolute;            top: 100px;            left: 100px;             height: 25px;            width: 25px;” >         <img src = “ball.gif”               alt = “ball”  >              ✓ The sprite div has a local style. Your code can change only the styles  that have been defined locally. The sprite div has a local style specify- ing absolute position, top, and left properties.    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  185                    ✓ There’s a form for buttons. This particular program uses buttons to dis- cern the user’s intent. When you use buttons, you should place them in  a form  even though in this case the form isn’t absolutely necessary .           <button type = “button”                 onclick = “moveSprite -5, 0 ”>           left            ✓ Each button calls the moveSprite   method. The moveSprite     method is defined in the movement.js file. It accepts two parameters:  dx determines how much the sprite should move in the x  side to side   axis, and dy controls how much the sprite will move in the y  vertical  axis.  Getting an overview of the JavaScript  Because the JavaScript code is getting more complex, I recommend that you  keep the following programming concepts in mind so that you can improve  your programming efficiency:  ✓ Move code to an external file. As with CSS code, when the JavaScript  starts to get complex, it’s a good idea to move it to its own file, so it’s  easier to manage and reuse.  ✓ Encapsulate code in functions. Rather than writing a long, complicated  function, try to break the code into smaller functions that solve individ- ual problems. If you design these functions well, your code will be easier  to write, understand, and recycle.  ✓ Create a few global variables. A few key variables will be reused   throughout your code. Create global variables for these key items, but  don’t make anything global that doesn’t need to be.  ✓ Define constants for clarity. Sometimes it’s handy to have a few key   values stored in special variables. In movement.html, I’ve created some  constants to help me track the boundary of the visual surface.  Creating global variables  The first part of this document simply defines the global variables I use  throughout the program:    movement.js   global variables var sprite; var x, y;      position variables   186 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages     constants var MIN_X = 15; var MAX_X = 365; var MIN_Y = 85; var MAX_Y = 435;  The movement program has three main global variables:            ✓ sprite: Represents the div that will move around on the screen.  ✓ x: Is the x  horizontal  position of the sprite. ✓ y: Is the y  vertical  position of the sprite.   It isn’t necessary to give values to global variables right away, but you should  define them outside any functions so their values will be available to all func- tions.  Check Chapter 5 for more about functions and variable scope.   Note that in computer graphics, the y axis works differently than it does in  math. Zero is the top of the screen, and y values increase as you move down  on the page.  This system is used because it models the top-to-bottom pattern  of most display devices.   This program also features some special constants. A constant is a vari- able  usually global  with a value that doesn’t change as the program runs.  Constants are almost always used to add clarity.   Through experimentation, I found that the ball’s x value should never be  smaller than 15 or larger than 365. By defining special constants with these  values, I can make it clear what these values represent.  Look ahead to the  boundary-checking code in the “Moving the sprite” section to see how this  really works.   Programmers traditionally put constants entirely in uppercase letters. Many  languages have special modifiers for creating constants, but JavaScript  doesn’t. If you want something to be a constant, just make a variable with an  uppercase name and treat it as a constant.  Don’t change it during the run of  the program.         Initializing  The init   function is small but mighty:  function init  {   sprite = document.getElementById “sprite” ; }    end init    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  187  It does a simple but important job: It loads up the sprite div and stores it in  a variable named sprite. Because sprite is a global variable, all other func- tions will have access to the sprite variable and will be able to manipulate it.  You’ll often use the init   function to initialize key variables in your pro- grams. You can also use this function to set up more advanced event han- dlers, as you see in the keyboard and mouse examples later in this chapter.  Moving the sprite  Of course, the most interesting function in the program is the one that moves  sprites around the screen. Take a look at it and then look through my expla- nation for it.  function moveSprite dx, dy {   var surface = document.getElementById “surface” ;     x = parseInt sprite.style.left ;   y = parseInt sprite.style.top ;    x += dx;   y += dy;            checkBounds  ;       move ball to new position   sprite.style.left = x + «px»;   sprite.style.top = y + “px”;              describe position   var output = document.getElementById «output» ;   output.innerHTML = “x: “ + x + “, y: “ + y; }    end MoveSprite       The function essentially works by first determining how much the sprite  should be moved in x and y, and then manipulating the left and top proper- ties of its style.  1.  Accept dx and dy as parameters.     The function expects two parameters: dx stands for delta-x, and dy is  delta-y.  You can read them difference in x, difference in y if you prefer,  but I like sounding like a NASA scientist.  These parameters tell how  much the sprite should move in each dimension:  function moveSprite dx, dy {  You might wonder why I’m working with dx and dy when this object  moves only horizontally. See, I’m thinking ahead. I’m going to reuse this  function in the next few programs. Even though I don’t need to move  vertically yet, I will soon, so I included the capability.         188 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                                 2.  Get a reference to the surface.     Use the normal document.getElementById trick to extract the sprite  from the page. Be sure the sprite you’re animating has absolute position  with top and left properties defined in a local style.    var surface = document.getElementById “surface” ;  3.  Extract the sprite’s x and y parameters.    The horizontal position is stored in the left property. CSS styles are  stored as strings and include a measurement. For example, the original  left value of the sprite is 100px. For the program, we need only the  numeric part. The parseInt   function pulls out only the numeric part  of the left property and turns it into an integer, which is then stored in  x. Do the same thing to get the y value.    x = parseInt sprite.style.left ;   y = parseInt sprite.style.top ;  4.  Increment the x and y variables.    Now that you have the x and y values stored as integer variables, you  can do math on them. It isn’t complicated math. Just add dx to x and  dy to y. This allows you to move the object as many pixels as the user  wants in both x and y axes.    x += dx;   y += dy;  5.  Check the boundaries.    If you have young children, you know this rule: When you have some- thing that can move, it will get out of bounds. If you let your sprite move,  it will leave the space you’ve designated. Checking the boundaries  isn’t difficult, but it’s another task, so I’m just calling a function here.  I describe checkBounds   in the next section, but basically it just  checks to see whether the sprite is leaving the surface and adjusts its  position to stay in bounds.    checkBounds  ;  6.  Move the ball.    Changing the x and y properties doesn’t really move the sprite. To do  that, you need to convert the integers back into the CSS format. If x is  120, you need to set left to 120px. Just concatenate “px” to the end  of each variable.       move ball to new position   sprite.style.left = x + “px”;   sprite.style.top = y + “px”;  7.  Print out the position.    For debugging purposes, I like to know exactly where the x and y posi- tions are, so I just made a string and printed it to an output panel.    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  189      describe position   var output = document.getElementById “output” ;   output.innerHTML = “x: “ + x + “, y: “ + y;  Checking the boundaries  You can respond in a number of ways when an object leaves the playing area.  I’m going with wrapping, one of the simplest techniques. If something leaves  the rightmost border, simply have it jump all the way to the left.   The code handles all four borders:  function checkBounds  {     wrap   if  x > MAX_X {     x = MIN_X;   }    end if   if  x < MIN_X {     x = MAX_X;   }    end if   if  y > MAX_Y {     y = MIN_Y;   }    end if   if  y < MIN_Y {     y = MAX_Y;   }    end if }    end function    if  x > MAX_X {     x = MIN_X;   }    end if  The checkBounds   function depends on the constants. This helps in a  couple of ways. When you look at the code, it’s really easy to see what’s  going on:  If x is larger than the maximum value for x, set it to the minimum value. You  almost can’t write it any more clearly than this. If the size of the playing sur- face changes, you simply change the values of the constants.  All this is very nice, but you probably wonder how I came up with the actual  values for the constants. In some languages, you can come up with nice math- ematical tricks to predict exactly what the largest and smallest values should  be. In JavaScript, this technique is a little tricky because the environment just  isn’t that precise.    190 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Shouldn’t you just get size values from the surface?

It’s a little annoying, but some experimentation   I chose a simple but effective technique. I temporarily took out the  checkbounds   call and just took a look at the output to see what the  values of x and y were. I looked to see how large x should be before the  sprite wraps and wrote the value down on paper. Likewise, I found largest  and smallest values for y.   When I knew these values, I simply placed them in constants. I don’t really  care that the maximum value for x is 365. I just want to know that when I’m  messing around with x I don’t want it to go past the MAX_X value.   If the size of my playing surface changes, I can just change the constants and  everything will work out fine.  If you’re interested, here are the other techniques you can use when a sprite is  about to leave the visual area:  ✓ Bounce: The object bounces off the wall. This is done by inverting the  dx or dy value  depending on whether it’s a vertical or horizontal wall . ✓ Stop: The object simply stops moving when it hits the wall. Set dx and   dy to 0 to achieve this effect.  ✓ Continue: The object keeps moving even though it is out of sight. This is  sometimes used for air-traffic control simulations  where visualizing the  location is part of the game  or orbital simulations  where presumably  the object will return .  ✓ Combinations: Sometimes you’ll see combinations like the civiliza-  tion games that simulate a cylindrical map by stopping on the top and  bottom and scrolling on the sides.                    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  191  Reading Input from the Keyboard  You can use JavaScript to read directly from the keyboard. Reading from the  keyboard can be useful in a number of situations, but it’s especially handy in  animation and simple gaming applications.   Figure 8-2 shows a program with another moving ball.   Figure 8-2:  You can  move the  ball with the  arrow keys.       The keyboard.html page has no buttons because the arrow keys are used  to manage all the input.  You know what I’m going to say. Look this thing over in your browser because  it just doesn’t have any charm unless you run it and mash on some arrow  keys.     Building the keyboard page  The keyboard page is very much like the movement.html page shown earlier  in this chapter.   192 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       keyboard.html       <link rel = «stylesheet»           type = «text css»           href = «keyboard.css»  >                <script type = «text javascript»             src = «movement.js»>           <script type = «text javascript»             src = «keyboard.js»>                          Use arrow keys to move ball                   <div id = «sprite»            style = «position: absolute;            top: 100px;            left: 100px;             height: 25px;            width: 25px;» >         <img src = «ball.gif»               alt = «ball»  >                                    x = 100, y = 100              The keyboard.html page is very similar to the movement.html page  described early in the chapter. This sort of situation is when it really pays  off to build reusable code. I basically copied the movement.html page and  made a couple of small but important changes:        ✓ Import the movement.js script. This page uses the same functions as   the movement.html page, so just import the script.   ✓ Add another script specific to reading the keyboard. You need a   couple of modifications, which are housed in a second script file called  keyboard.js.    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  193        ✓ Keep the rest of the page similar. You still call init   when the body  loads, and you still want the same visual design, except for the buttons.  The surface and sprite divs are identical to the movement.html  design.  ✓ Take out the form. This page responds to the keyboard, so you don’t   need a form any more.  Looking over the keyboard.js script  Remember that this program begins with the movement.js script. As far as  the browser is concerned, that entire script file has been loaded before the  keyboard.js script appears. The basic foundation is already in place from  movement. The keyboard script just handles the modifications to make key- board support work.  Overwriting the init   function  Working with a keyboard still requires some initialization. I need a little more  work in the init   function, so I make a new version that replaces the ver- sion created in movement.js.    assumes movement.js  function init  {   sprite = document.getElementById “sprite” ;   document.onkeydown = keyListener; }    end init  The order in which you import scripts matters. If you duplicate a function, the  browser interprets only the last one it reads.      Setting up an event handler  In my init   function, I still want to initialize the sprite  as I did in  movement.js . When you want to read the keyboard, you need to tap into  the browser’s event-handling facility. Browsers provide basic support for  page-based events  like body.onload and button.onclick , but they also  provide a lower level of support for more fundamental input such as key- board and mouse input.  If you want to read this lower-level input, you need to specify a function that  will respond to the input.     document.onkeydown = keyListener;   194 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                  This line specifies that a special function called keyListener will be called  whenever the user presses a key. Keep the following things in mind when cre- ating this type of event handler:  1.  The event handler should be called in init  .     You probably want keyboard handling to be available immediately, so  you should set up event handlers in the init   function.  2.  The function is called as though it were a variable.     This is a slightly different syntax than you’ve seen before. When you  create function handlers in HTML, you simply feed a string that repre- sents the function name complete with parameters  button onclick  = “doSomething  ” . When you call a function within JavaScript  as  opposed to calling the function in HTML , the function name is actually  much like a variable, so it doesn’t require quotes. If you want to know the truth, functions are variables in JavaScript. Next  time somebody tells you JavaScript is a “toy language,” mention that it  supports automatic dereferencing of function pointers. Then run away  before the person asks you what that means.  That’s what I do.         3.  You need to create a function with the specified name.    If you have this code in init, the browser calls a function called  keyListener   whenever a key is pressed.  You could call the func- tion something else, but keyListener   is a pretty good name for it  because it listens for keystrokes.   Responding to keystrokes  After you’ve set up an event handler, you need to write the function to  respond to keystrokes, which is a pretty easy task. Here is the keyListener  code  found in keyboard.js :  function keyListener e {      if e doesn’t already exist, we’re in IE so make it    if  !e {     e = window.event;   }    end IE-specific code              left   if  e.keyCode == 37 {     moveSprite -10, 0 ;   }    end if    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  195      up   if  e.keyCode == 38 {     moveSprite 0, -10 ;   }    end if      right   if  e.keyCode == 39 {     moveSprite 10, 0 ;   }    end if      down   if  e.keyCode == 40 {     moveSprite 0, 10 ;   }    end if  }    end keyListener   This code grabs an event object if needed, and then analyzes that object to  figure out which key  if any  was pressed. It then calls the moveSprite    function to move the sprite. Here’s the low-down:  1.  Event functions have event objects.    Just knowing that an event has occurred isn’t enough. You need to know  which key the user pressed. Fortunately, the browsers all have an event  object available that tells you what has happened.   2.  Many browsers pass the event as a parameter.    When you create an event function, the browser automatically assigns  a special parameter to the function. This parameter  normally called e   represents the event. Just make the function with a parameter called e,  and most browsers create e automatically.  function keyListener e {  3.  Internet Explorer needs a little more help.    IE doesn’t automatically create an event object for you, so you need to  specifically create it.       if e doesn’t already exist, we’re in IE so make   it    if  !e {     e = window.event;   }    end IE-specific code  4.  You can use e to figure out which key the user pressed.    The e object has some nifty properties, including keyCode. This prop- erty returns a number that tells you which key the user pressed.                       196 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages      Do a quick search on JavaScript event object to find out other kinds of  event tricks. I’m showing the most critical features here, but this is just  an introduction to the many interesting things you can do with events.  5.  Compare the keycode property of the event object to the keycodes      corresponding to keys you’re interested in.   You can figure out the keycodes of any keys on your keyboard, and you  can use basic if statements to respond appropriately.  I explain key- codes in the following section.       left   if  e.keyCode == 37 {     moveSprite -10, 0 ;   }    end if  6.  Call appropriate variations of moveSprite.     If the user pressed the left-arrow key, move the sprite to the left. You  can use the moveSprite   function defined in movement.js for this.  Deciphering the mystery of keycodes  When you look over the code in the keyListener function, you can see  some odd numbers in there. For example, the code that looks for the left  arrow key actually compares the e.keyCode to the value 37. The big mys- tery is where all the numbers in the keyListener function  in the previous  section  came from.   These numbers are called keycodes. They are numeric representations of  the physical keys on the keyboard. Each physical key on the keyboard has  a corresponding keycode. Keycodes are mapped to the physical key, which  means the keycode corresponding to a key is the same even if the keyboard  mapping is changed  to a foreign language or alternate input setting, for  example .  How did I know that the left-arrow key corresponds to the keycode 37? It’s  pretty simple, really. I just wrote a program to tell me. Figure 8-3 shows  readKeys.html in action.                Figure 8-3:  This pro- gram reads  the key- board and  reports the  key codes.      Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  197  Run readKeys and press a few keys. You can then easily determine what  keycode is related to which key. You might also want to look over the code in  this format if you’re a little confused; because all the code’s in one place, you  might it’s easier to read than the movement examples.  If you use a notebook or an international keyboard, be aware that some of the  keycodes can be nonstandard, especially numeric keypad keys. Try to stick to  standard keys if you want to ensure that your program works on all  keyboards.     Following the Mouse  You can create an event handler that reads the mouse. Figure 8-4 shows such  a program.  Figure 8-4:  Now the  sprite stays  with the  mouse.       Achieving this effect is actually quite easy when you know how to read the  keyboard, because it works in almost exactly the same way.   Looking over the HTML  The code for followMouse.html is simple enough that I kept it in one file.    198 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       followMouse.html              var sprite;              function init  {         sprite = document.getElementById «sprite» ;         document.onmousemove = mouseListener;       }    end init              function mouseListener e {         if  !e {           e = window.event;         }    end IE catch                    get width and height         height = parseInt sprite.style.height ;         width = parseInt sprite.style.width ;                    move center of sprite to mouse         x = e.pageX -  width 2 ;         y = e.pageY -  height 2 ;                  sprite.style.left = x + «px»;         sprite.style.top = y + “px”;       }    end function                     Move the mouse and the ball will follow      <div id = «sprite»          style = «position: absolute;                   left: 100px;                   top: 100px;                   width: 50px;                   height: 50px;»>       <img src = «ball.gif»            alt = «ball»  >                Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  199  Setting up the HTML  The HTML page is simple. This time I’m letting the mouse take up the entire  page. No borders are necessary, because the sprite won’t be able to leave the  page.  If the mouse leaves the page, it no longer sends event messages.   Just create a sprite with an image as normal and be sure to call init   when  the body loads.  Initializing the code  The initialization is pretty straightforward:  1.  Create a global variable for the sprite.    Define the sprite variable outside any functions so it will be available  to all of them.        var sprite;  2.  Build the sprite in init  .    The init   function is a great place to create the sprite.        function init  {         sprite = document.getElementById “sprite” ;         document.onmousemove = mouseListener;  3.  Set up an event handler for mouse motion.    Set up an event handler in init  . This time you’re listening for mouse  events, so call this one mouseListener.          document.onmousemove = mouseListener;  Building the mouse listener  The mouse listener works much like a keyboard listener. The mouse listener  is called whenever the mouse moves, and it examines the event object to  determine the mouse’s current position. It then uses that value to place the  sprite:  1.  Get the event object.    Use the cross-platform technique to get the event object.        function mouseListener e {         if  !e {           e = window.event;         }    end IE catch                       200 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                      2.  Determine the sprite’s width and height.    The top and left properties will point to the sprite’s top-left corner. It  looks more natural to have the mouse in the center of the sprite. To cal- culate the center, you need the height and width values. Don’t forget  to add these values to the local style for the sprite.            get width and height         height = parseInt sprite.style.height ;         width = parseInt sprite.style.width ;  3.  Use e.pageX and e.pageY to get the mouse position.    These properties return the current position of the mouse on the page.  4.  Determine x and y under the mouse cursor.    Subtract half of the sprite’s width from the mouse’s x value  e.pageX   so the sprite’s horizontal position is centered on the mouse. Repeat with  the y position.            move center of sprite to mouse         x = e.pageX -  width 2 ;         y = e.pageY -  height 2 ;  5.  Move the mouse to the new x and y coordinates.    Use the conversion techniques to move the sprite to the new position.          sprite.style.left = x + “px”;         sprite.style.top = y + “px”;  Another fun effect is to have the sprite influenced by the mouse. Don’t make it  follow the mouse directly but check to see where the mouse is in relationship  with the sprite. Have the sprite move up if the mouse is above the sprite, for  example.      Automatic Motion  You can make a sprite move automatically by attaching a special timer to the  object. Figure 8-5 shows the ball moving autonomously across the page.  Timer.html is surprisingly simple, because it borrows almost everything  from other code.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       timer.html     Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  201      <link rel = «stylesheet»           type = «text css»           href = «keyboard.css»  >      <script type = «text javascript»             src = «movement.js»>                        function init  {         sprite = document.getElementById «sprite» ;         setInterval «moveSprite 5, 3 », 100 ;       }    end init                            Timer-based movement                   <div id = «sprite»            style = «position: absolute;            top: 100px;            left: 100px;             height: 25px;            width: 25px;» >         <img src = «ball.gif»               alt = «ball»  >                                    x = 100, y = 100                The HTML and CSS are exactly the same as the button.html code. Most of  the JavaScript comes from movement.js. The only thing that’s really new is  a tiny but critical change in the init   method.  JavaScript contains a very useful function called setInterval, which takes  two parameters:        ✓ A function call: Create a string containing a function call including any   of its parameters.  ✓ A time interval in milliseconds: You can specify an interval in 1,000ths  of a second. If the interval is 500, the given function will be called twice  per second; 50 milliseconds is 20 calls per second; and so on.   202 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Figure 8-5:  This sprite  is moving  on its own.   I added  the arrow  to show  motion.              You can set the interval at whatever speed you want, but that doesn’t guar- antee things will work that fast. If you put complex code in a function and tell  the browser to execute it 1,000 times per second, it probably won’t be able to  keep up  especially if the user has a slower machine than you do .  The browser calls the specified function at the specified interval. Put any  code that you want repeated inside the given function.  Don’t put anything in an interval function that doesn’t have to go there.  Because this code happens several times per second, it’s called a critical  path, and any wasteful processing here could severely slow down the entire  program. Try to make the code in an interval function as clean as possible.   That’s why I created the sprite as a global variable. I didn’t want to re- create the sprite 20 times per second, making my program impossible for  slower browsers to handle.   By using automatically moving objects, you get a chance to play with other  kinds of boundary detection. If you want to see how to make something  bounce when it hits the edge, look at bounce.html and bounce.js on  either of the companion Web sites  www.aharrisbooks.net jad or www. dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd  along with the other code fea- tured in this chapter.     Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  203  Image-Swapping Animation  The other kind of animation you can do involves rapidly changing an image.  Look at Figure 8-6 to see one frame of an animated figure.  Animation is never that easy to show in a still screen shot, so Figure 8-7  shows the sequence of images used to build the kicking sprite.  Figure 8-6:  This sprite is  kicking!       Figure 8-7:  I used this  series of  images to  build the  animation.       You can use any series of images you want. I got these images from a site  called Reiner’s Tilesets  http:  reinerstileset.4players.de  englisch.html . It includes a huge number of sprites, each with several  animations. These animations are called Freya.  Preparing the images  You can build your own images, or you can get them from a site like Reiner’s  Tilesets. In any case, there are a few things to keep in mind when building  image animations:   204 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                     ✓ Keep them small. Larger images will take a long time to download and   will not swap as smoothly as small ones. My images are 128 x 128 pixels,  which is a good size.  ✓ Consider adding transparency. The images from Reiner’s Tilesets have   a brown background. I made the background transparent by using my  favorite graphics editor  GIMP .  ✓ Change the file format. The images came in .bmp format, which is inef- ficient and doesn’t support transparency. I saved them as .gif images  to make them smaller and enable the background transparency.  ✓ Consider changing the names. I renamed the images to make the names   simpler and to eliminate spaces from the filenames. I called the images  kick00.gif to kick12.gif.  ✓ Put animation images in a subdirectory. With ordinary page images, I  often find a subdirectory to be unhelpful. When you start building ani- mations, you can easily have a lot of little images running around. This is  a good place for a subdirectory.  ✓ Be sure you have the right to use the images. Just because you can   use an image doesn’t mean you should. Try to get permission from the  owner of the images, cite your source, and host the images on your own  server. It’s just good citizenship.   Building the page  The code for animation just uses variations of things you’ve already done: a  setInterval function and some DOM coding.   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       imageSwap.html                <![CDATA[       var imgList = new Array           «freya kick00.gif»,         «freya kick01.gif»,         «freya kick02.gif»,         «freya kick03.gif»,         «freya kick04.gif»,         «freya kick05.gif»,         «freya kick06.gif»,    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  205          «freya kick07.gif»,         «freya kick08.gif»,         «freya kick09.gif»,         «freya kick10.gif»,         «freya kick11.gif»,         «freya kick12.gif»        ;              var frame = 0;       var spriteImage              function init  {         setInterval «animate  », 100 ;         spriteImage = document.getElementById «image» ;       }    end init              function animate  {         frame += 1;         if  frame > imgList.length {           frame = 0;         }    end if         spriteImage.src = imgList[frame];       }         ]]>                            <img id = «image»            src = «freya kick00.gif»             alt = «kicking sprite»  >              The HTML is incredibly simple:  1.  Set up the body with an init   method.                   As usual, the body’s onclick event calls an init   method to start  things up.  2.  Create a sprite div.  3.  Name the img.    Build a div named sprite. Because you won’t be changing the position  of this div  yet , you don’t need to worry about the local style.    In this program, you want to animate the img inside the div, so you  need to give it an id.                  206 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Building the global variables  The JavaScript code isn’t too difficult, but it requires a little bit of thought:  1.  Create an array of image names.    You have a list of images to work with. The easiest way to support this is  with an array of image names. Each element of the array is the filename  of an image. Put them in the order you want the animation frames to be  shown.        var imgList = new Array           “freya kick00.gif”,         “freya kick01.gif”,         “freya kick02.gif”,         “freya kick03.gif”,         “freya kick04.gif”,         “freya kick05.gif”,         “freya kick06.gif”,         “freya kick07.gif”,         “freya kick08.gif”,         “freya kick09.gif”,         “freya kick10.gif”,         “freya kick11.gif”,         “freya kick12.gif”        ;  2.  Build a frame variable to hold the current frame number.    Because this animation has 12 frames, the frame variable will go from 0  to 11.        var frame = 0;  3.  Set up spriteImage.        var spriteImage    This variable will be a reference to the img tag inside the sprite tag.  Setting up the interval  The init   function attaches the spriteImage variable to the image object  and sets up the animate   method to run ten times per second.        function init  {         setInterval “animate  ”, 100 ;         spriteImage = document.getElementById “image” ;       }    end init    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  207                       The actual animation happens in the  you guessed it  animate   function.  Animating the sprite  The function is straightforward:  1.  Increment the frame counter.   Add one to the frame variable.          frame += 1;  2.  Check for bounds.    Any time you change a variable, you should consider whether it could  go out of bounds. I’m using frame as an index in the imgList array, so I  check to see that frame is always less than the length of imgList.          if  frame > imgList.length {           frame = 0;         }    end if  3.  Reset the frame if necessary.    If the frame counter gets too high, reset it to 0 and start the animation  over.  4.  Copy the image filename from the array to the src property of the   spriteImage object.    This step causes the given file to display.          spriteImage.src = imgList[frame];  Improving the animation with preloading  When you run the image swap program, you will get some delays on the first  pass as all the images load.  Making the images smaller and saving them in  the .gif or .png format helps with the delays.  Most browsers store images  locally, so the images will animate smoothly after the first pass.  If you want smoother animation, you can use a technique called preload- ing. This causes all the images to load before the animation begins. The  Preload.html file makes a few changes to preload the image.  I don’t show  a figure because it looks just like imageswap to the user.   There are no changes in the HTML code. The only changes are in the  JavaScript code:   208 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages         var imgFiles = new Array           “freya kick00.gif”,         “freya kick01.gif”,         “freya kick02.gif”,         “freya kick03.gif”,         “freya kick04.gif”,         “freya kick05.gif”,         “freya kick06.gif”,         “freya kick07.gif”,         “freya kick08.gif”,         “freya kick09.gif”,         “freya kick10.gif”,         “freya kick11.gif”,         “freya kick12.gif”        ;              var frame = 0;       var spriteImage       var images = new Array 12 ;              function init  {         setInterval “animate  ”, 100 ;         spriteImage = document.getElementById “image” ;         loadImages  ;       }    end init              function animate  {         frame += 1;         if  frame >= images.length {           frame = 0;         }    end if         spriteImage.src = images[frame].src;       }    end animate              function loadImages  {           preloads all the images for faster display.         for  i=0; i < images.length; i++ {           images[i] = new Image  ;           images[i].src = imgFiles[i];         }    end for loop       }    end loadImages         Here’s how the preloading works:  1.  Change the array name to imgFiles.         This distinction is subtle but important: The array doesn’t represent  actual images, but the filenames of the images. You need to create  another array to hold the actual image data.    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  209                               2.  Create an array of images.    JavaScript has a data type designed specifically for holding image data.  The images array holds the actual image data  not just filenames, but  the actual pictures . The images array should be global.  3.  Create a function to populate the images array.    The loadImages   function creates the array of image data. Call  loadImages   from init  .  4.  Build a loop that steps through each element of the imgFiles array.    You build an image object to correspond to each filename, so the length  of the two arrays needs to be the same.  5.  Build a new image object for each filename.    Use the new Image   construct to build an image object representing  the image data associated with a particular file.  6.  Attach that image object to the images   array.    This array now contains all the image data.  7.  Modify animate   to read from the images   array.    The animate   function now reads from the images   array. Because  the image data has been preloaded into the array, it should display more  smoothly.  Preloading images doesn’t make the animation faster. It just delays the anima- tion until all the images are loaded into the cache, making it appear smoother.  Some browsers still play the animation before the cache has finished loading,  but the technique still has benefits.   Even if you don’t like animation, these techniques can be useful. You can use  the setInterval   technique for any kind of repetitive code you might  want, including the dynamic display of menus or other page elements. In  fact, before CSS became the preferred technique, most dynamic menus used  JavaScript animation.        Working with Compound Images  Another common approach to image-swapping animation is to combine all  images to a single graphic file and use CSS techniques to display only one  part of that image. Figure 8-8 shows you what I mean.   210 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   This image file contains several images of a helicopter. Each subimage shows  a different position of main rotor and tail rotor. The compound.html page  shows this image, but it shows only one segment of the image at a time. The  part of the image that’s displayed is changed rapidly to give the appearance  of animation. This technique has some advantages:  ✓ A single image loads more efficiently than a number of separate images. ✓ The entire image loads at once, eliminating the lag associated with mul-  ✓ You can combine very complex images with multiple animations in   tiple images  this way.  The completed HTML looks like Figure 8-9  except, of course, you can see the  helicopter’s rotors spinning on the real page .  Figure 8-8:  The chopper  compound  image.    Figure 8-9:  The image  is moved  within the  div to give  the anima- tion effect.                     Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  211              Preparing the image  Preparing an image to be used in this way does require some care. You must  plan to ensure it’s easy to animate the image:  ✓ Combine all images to a single file. Use an image-editing tool, such as   Gimp or Photoshop.  ✓ Make sure all subimages are the same size. Your life will be easier if all  the images are a consistent size. All the chopper images are 64 pixels tall  and 132 pixels wide.  ✓ Make all subimages the same distance apart. The images are all 132   pixels apart.  ✓ Arrange images in rows or columns. If you have a single animation,  place it in a row or column to simplify your math. You can combine  more images for more complex animations  for example, a sequence of  walk cycles in each direction.  The particular image used in this example is from Ari’s SpriteLib  www. flyingyogi.com fun spritelib.html , an excellent resource of open- source game graphics. I modified the image slightly for use in this example.   Setting up the HTML and CSS  As with many animation examples, the HTML code is rather minimal. All  that’s necessary is a div with an id attribute:       Compound Image Demo                As you can see, the div doesn’t even have an image in it. The image is placed  and manipulated through CSS with the background-image property.   The CSS is likewise quite simple:          chopper {       background-image: url “heli.gif” ;       height: 64px;       width: 128px;       background-position: 0px 0px;     }       212 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   The CSS does a number of important tasks:                     1.  Apply the image.  2.  Resize the div.    The entire image is applied as the background image of the div.    The div size is adjusted to reflect the size of a single subimage. If you  look at the HTML at this point, the div looks like an ordinary image,  showing only the first sub-image of the chopper.  3.  Set the initial background position.    Only the first chopper is showing, but the entire image  with four chop- pers  is attached to the div. I use CSS to move the image so different  frames of the animation appear in the div’s visible space. The initial  position is 0px 0px, meaning that the upper-left corner of the image is  aligned with the upper-left corner of the div.    This entire helicopter animation might seem like a lot of unnecessary grief.   You might ask why I bother when I could just use an animated GIF image. The  answer is control. I could use those alternatives, and sometimes they’d be  a better choice. However, if you know how to control the animation directly  through JavaScript, you can do things you can’t do otherwise, like change the  animation speed or freeze on a particular frame.  Writing the JavaScript  The general strategy is to run an ordinary animation loop but to change the  background position of the div every frame so it displays a different frame  of the animation. The second frame of the animation occurs at pixel 132, so  if you move the background image to the left by 132px, you see the second  frame. I stored the position necessary to display each frame in an array called  offset. Much of this program looks like the previous image-swapping code.  Setting up global variables  Begin with some global variables that will be used throughout the  application:        var offsetList = new Array 0, -132, -264, -396 ;       var frame = 0;       var chopper;  1.  Create an offsetList array.    This array holds the coordinates necessary to display each image in the  list. Use an image editor to check the positions.    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  213                      2.  Create a frame variable.    This integer describes which frame of the animation is currently show- ing. It will be used as an array index to display the various animation  frames.  3.  Create a variable to hold the div.    The chopper variable will hold a reference to the div. Changing the  style of the chopper variable will change the visible image.  Building an init   function  The initialization function sets up the animation:        function init  {         chopper = document.getElementById “chopper” ;         setInterval “animate  ”, 100 ;       }    end init  The init   function is called by the body onload event. It has two jobs:  1.  Create a reference to the chopper div.     Remember, the div doesn’t exist until the body has finished loading,  so you must populate the chopper variable in a function. The init    function is a perfect place for this kind of work.  2.  Use setInterval   to create an animation loop.     The program calls the animate   function every 100 milliseconds, or  ten times per second.  Animating the sprite  The actual animation is easier than the preparation.         function animate  {         frame++;         if  frame >= offsetList.length {           frame = 0;         }    end if          offset = offsetList[frame] + “px 0px”;         chopper.style.backgroundPosition = offset;       }    end animate  To make the animation finally work, follow these steps:   214 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                      1.  Increment the frame counter.     This step indicates that you’re going to a new frame.  2.  Check that the frame is within bounds.    The frame variable will be used as an index to the offsetList array,  so you need to ensure that it’s smaller than the length of the array. If it’s  too big, you can just reset it to 0.  3.  Create an offset value.    The offset value is generated from the offsetList array. Note that  the array contains only the x value. Concatenate this with “px 0px” to  create an offset in the legal format for CSS.  Look at the original CSS for  background-position to see the format.   4.  Apply the offset to the chopper variable.    Use the backgroundPosition attribute of the style attribute to  dynamically change the background image’s position.  Movement and Swapping  You can combine motion effects with image-swapping to have an image move  around on the screen with animated motion. Figure 8-10 tries to show this  effect, but you need to use a browser to really see it.  Making this program requires nothing at all new. It’s just a combination of  the techniques used throughout this chapter. Figure 8-11 shows the list of  images used to make Freya run.  I added the arrow again just so you can see  how the movement works.   Building the HTML framework  The HTML is  as usual  pretty minimal here:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >      run.html      <script type = «text javascript»             src = «run.js»>              Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  215          <div id = «sprite»          style = «position: absolute;                   top: 100px;                   left: 100px;»>       <img src = «freya run0.gif»            id = «image»            alt = «running image»  >              Figure 8-10:  Run, Freya,  Run!    Figure 8-11:  These are  the running  images from  Reiner’s  Tilesets.           216 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages                       When you want to create a moving image-swap animation, follow these steps:  1.  Import the script.    You can build the script locally  as I did in the last example , but any  time the script gets complex, it might be better in an external file.  2.  Call an init   method.    Most animation requires an init   method called from body. onload  , and this animation is no exception.  3.  Name the sprite.  4.  Name the image.    The sprite is a div that will move, so it needs absolute position, top,  and left properties all defined as local styles.    You also want to animate the image inside the sprite. The only property  you’ll change here is the src, so no local styles are necessary here.  Building the code  The JavaScript code is familiar because all the elements can be borrowed  from previous programs. Here’s the code for run.js  used by run.html  in  its entirety.    run.js  var frame = 0; var imgList = new Array    “freya run0.gif”,   “freya run1.gif”,   “freya run2.gif”,   “freya run3.gif”,   “freya run4.gif”,   “freya run5.gif”,   “freya run6.gif”,   “freya run7.gif”  ;        var sprite; var spriteImage; var MAX_X = 500;        function init  {   sprite = document.getElementById “sprite” ;   spriteImage = document.getElementById “image” ;       Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  217    setInterval “animate  ”, 100 ; }    end init        function animate  {   updateImage  ;   updatePosition  ; }    end animate        function updateImage  {   frame++;   if  frame > imgList.length {     frame = 0;   }    end if   spriteImage.src = imgList[frame]; }    end updateImage        function updatePosition  {   sprite = document.getElementById “sprite” ;   var x = parseInt sprite.style.left ;   x += 10;   if  x > MAX_X {     x = 0;   }    end if   sprite.style.left = x + “px”; }    end function                 Defining global variables  You have a few global variables in the code from the previous section:  ✓ frame:The frame number. It is an integer from 0 to 11 that serves as the   index for the imgList array.  ✓ imgList: An array of filenames with the animation images. ✓ sprite: The div that will be moved around the screen. ✓ spriteImage: The img element of sprite. This is the image that will   be swapped.  ✓ MAX_X: A constant holding the maximum value of X. In this program, I’m  moving only in one direction, so the only boundary I’m worried about is  MAX_X. If the sprite moved in other directions, I’d add some other con- stants for the other boundary conditions.   218 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages   Initializing your data  The init   function performs its normal tasks: setting up sprite variables  and calling the animate   function on an interval.  function init  {   sprite = document.getElementById “sprite” ;   spriteImage = document.getElementById “image” ;      setInterval “animate  ”, 100 ; }    end init  When you move and swap images, sometimes you’ll have to adjust the ani- mation interval and the distance traveled each frame so the animation looks  right. Otherwise the sprite might seem to skate rather than run.     Animating the image  I really have two kinds of animation happening at once, so in the grand tradi- tion of encapsulation, the animate   function passes off its job to two other  functions:  function animate  {   updateImage  ;   updatePosition  ; }    end animate  Updating the image  The updateImage   function handles the image-swapping duties:  function updateImage  {   frame++;   if  frame > imgList.length {     frame = 0;   }    end if   spriteImage.src = imgList[frame]; }    end updateImage  Moving the sprite  The sprite is moved in the updatePosition   function:    Chapter 8: Moving and Grooving  219  function updatePosition  {   sprite = document.getElementById “sprite” ;   var x = parseInt sprite.style.left ;   x += 10;   if  x > MAX_X {     x = 0;   }    end if   sprite.style.left = x + “px”; }    end function  I know what you’re thinking: You could use this stuff to make a really cool  game. It’s true. You can make games with JavaScript, but you’ll eventually run  into JavaScript’s design limitations. I prefer Flash and Python as languages to  do game development. Now that I mention it, I’ve written other Wiley books  on exactly these topics: Flash Game Programming For Dummies and Game  Programming: The L Line. See you there!      220 Part II: Using JavaScript to Enhance Your Pages    Part III  Moving Up  to AJAX   In this part . . .  Every once in a while, a technology comes along that   threatens to change everything. AJAX is one such   technology. In this part, you learn what all the fuss is about  and why AJAX is such a big deal. You learn how to make  your own AJAX requests by hand, and then you do some  real Web 2.0 work with the fun and powerful jQuery library.  Chapter 9 describes the nuts-and-bolts details of AJAX —  how it works, how meaningless the acronym is, and every- thing. See how to build an AJAX connection by hand  but  after you’ve seen it once, use a library like everyone else  does .  Chapter 10 introduces the spiffy jQuery library. This free  toolkit simplifies AJAX tremendously, and it adds amazing  new capabilities to JavaScript. Learn how to incorporate  jQuery into your pages and get started with this incredible  toolkit.  Chapter 11 shows how to use jQuery’s many cool anima- tion features. You’ll make various elements play hide-and- seek, slide around, fade, and animate. It’s really fun.  Chapter 12 introduces the incredible jQuery user interface  toolkit. This fun tool allows you to create and use beauti- ful CSS themes. You also learn how to add dragging, drop- ping, and resizing behavior to any element on the page.  Chapter 13 describes more of the jQuery user interface,  especially elements that improve usability. You learn how  to easily build accordions and tabbed interfaces, and you  are introduced to automatic calendars, sortable lists,  scrollers, and custom dialogs.  Chapter 14 explains how jQuery helps with more  advanced AJAX functions, especially working with data.  First you get an overview of traditional server-side pro- gramming with PHP. Then you learn how AJAX simplifies  this process, and how to manage data in specialized for- mats like XML and JSON.   Chapter 9  AJAX Essentials  In This Chapter ▶ Understanding AJAX ▶ Using JavaScript to manage HTTP requests ▶ Creating an XMLHttpRequest object ▶ Building a synchronous AJAX request  ▶ Retrieving data from an AJAX request ▶ Managing asynchronous AJAX requests  If you’ve been following the Web trends, you’ve no doubt heard of AJAX.   This technology has generated a lot of interest. Depending on who you   listen to, it’s either going to “change the Internet” or “it’s a lot of overblown  hype.” In this book I show what AJAX really is, how to use it, and how to use  a particular AJAX library to supercharge your Web pages.  AJAX: Return to Troy  Okay, AJAX has nothing to do with a sequel to the Iliad  though that would be  pretty cool . But since I have your attention, let’s discuss AJAX, the mighty  and very real Web technology. The first thing to do is figure out exactly what  AJAX is and what it isn’t. It isn’t . . . :  ✓ A programming language. Nope. It isn’t one more language to cram into   your head  along with the many others you encounter .  ✓ New. No. Most of the technology in AJAX isn’t really all that new. It’s the   way it’s being used that’s different.  ✓ Remarkably different. Not really. For the most part, AJAX is really the  same kinds of things you see in the rest of this book. It’s about building  compliant Web pages that interact with the user.            224 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX               So you’ve got to wonder why people are so excited about AJAX. It’s a rela- tively simple thing, but it has the potential to change the way people think  about Internet development. Here’s what it really is, has, and does:  ✓ Direct control of client-server communication. Rather than relying on  the automatic communication between client and server that happens  with Web sites and server-side programs, AJAX is about managing this  relationship more directly.  ✓ Use of the XMLHttpRequest object. This is a special object that’s been  built into the DOM of all major browsers for some time, but hasn’t been  used heavily. The real innovation of AJAX was finding creative  perhaps  unintentional  uses for this heretofore-obscure utility.  ✓ A closer relationship between client-side and server-side program- ming. Up to now, client-side programs  usually JavaScript  did their  own thing, and server-side programs  PHP  operated without too much  knowledge of each other. AJAX helps these two types of programming  work together better.  ✓ A series of libraries that facilitate this communication. AJAX isn’t all   that hard to use, but it does have a lot of details. Several great libraries  have sprung up to simplify using AJAX technologies. You’ll find AJAX  libraries for both client-side languages  like JavaScript  and server-side  languages  like PHP . As an added bonus, these libraries often include  other great features that make JavaScript programming easier and more  powerful.  Let’s say you’re making an online purchase with a shopping-cart mechanism.  In a typical  pre-AJAX  system, an entire Web page is downloaded to the  user’s computer. There might be a limited amount of JavaScript-based inter- activity, but anything that requires a data request needs to be sent back to  the server. For example, if you’re on a shopping site and you want more infor- mation about that fur-lined fishbowl you’ve had your eye on, you might click  the “More information” button. Doing so sends a request to the server, which  builds an entire new Web page for you, containing your new request.   Every time you make a request, the system builds a whole new page on the  fly. The client and server have a long-distance relationship.   In the old days when you wanted to manage your Web site’s content, you had  to refresh each Web page — time-consuming to say the least. But with AJAX,  you can update the content without refreshing the page. Instead of the server  sending an entire-page response just to update a few words, the server only  sends the words you want to update and nothing else.    Chapter 9: AJAX Essentials  225  AJAX Spelled Out  If you’re using an AJAX-enabled shopping cart, you might still click the fish- bowl image. An AJAX request goes to the server and gets information about  the fishbowl. And here’s the good part: This information appears immedi- ately on the current page, without having to completely refresh the page.  AJAX technology allows you to send a request to the server, which can then  change just a small part of the page. With AJAX, you can have a whole bunch  of smaller requests happening all the time, rather than a few big ones that  rebuild the page in large, distracting flurries of activity.  To the user, this makes the Web page look more like a traditional applica- tion. That’s the big appeal of AJAX: It allows Web applications to act more  like desktop apps, even if the Web apps have complicated features  such as  remote database access .   Google’s Gmail was the first major application to use AJAX, and it blew  people away because it felt so much like a regular application inside a Web  browser.  Technical people love snappy acronyms. There’s nothing more intoxicating  than inventing a term. AJAX is one term that has taken on a life of its own. As  with many computing acronyms, it’s a fun word, but it doesn’t really mean  much. AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. I suspect these  terms were chosen to make a pronounceable acronym rather than for their  accuracy or relevance to how AJAX works.  But what do I know?   A is for asynchronous  An asynchronous transaction  at least in AJAX terms  is one in which more  than one thing can happen at once. For example you can have an AJAX call  process a request while the rest of your form is being processed. AJAX  requests do not absolutely have to be asynchronous, but they usually are.   It’s really okay if you don’t follow this completely. It’s not an important part  of understanding AJAX, but vowels are always nice in an acronym.   When it comes to Web development, asynchronous means you can send and  receive as many different requests as you want — independently. Data might  start transmitting at any time without having any effect on other data trans- missions. You could have a form that saves each field to the database as    226 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   soon as it’s filled out. Or perhaps a series of drop-down lists that generates  another drop-down list based on the value you just selected.  In this chapter, I show you how to implement both synchronous and asyn- chronous versions of AJAX.  J is for JavaScript  If you want to make an AJAX call, you simply write some JavaScript code that  simulates a form. You can then access a special object hidden in the DOM   the XMLHttpRequest object  and use its methods to send that request to  the user. Your program acts like a form, even if there was no form there. In  that sense, when you’re writing AJAX code, you’re really using JavaScript.  Of course, you can also use any other client-side programming language  that can speak with the DOM, including Flash and  to a lesser extent  Java.  JavaScript is the dominant technology, so it’s in the acronym.  A lot of times, you also use JavaScript to decode the response from the AJAX  request.  A is for . . . and?   I think it’s a stretch to use “and” in an acronym, but AJX just isn’t as cool as  AJAX. I guess they didn’t ask me.  And X is for . . . data?  The X is actually for XML, which is one way to send the data back and forth  from the server.   Because the object we’re using is the XMLHttpRequest object, it makes  sense that it requests XML. It can do that, yes, but it can also get any kind of  text data. You can use AJAX to retrieve all kinds of things:  ✓ Plain old text: Sometimes you just want to grab some text from the   server. Maybe you have a text file with a daily quote in it or something. ✓ Formatted HTML: You can have text stored on the server as a snippet   of HTML XHTML code and use AJAX to load this page snippet into your  browser. This gives you a powerful way to build a page from a series  of smaller segments. You can use this to re-use parts of your page  say  headings or menus  without duplicating them on the server.                   Chapter 9: AJAX Essentials  227  ✓ XML data: XML is a great way to pass data around  That’s what it was   invented for.  You might send a request to a program that goes to a  database, makes a request, and returns the result as XML.  ✓ JSON data: A new standard called JSON  JavaScript Object Notation,  introduced in Chapter 5  is emerging as an alternative to XML for for- matted data transfer. It has some interesting advantages.  In this chapter, I stick with plain old text and HTML. Chapter 14 describes  mechanisms for working with XML and JSON data in AJAX.  Making a Basic AJAX Connection    AJAX uses some pretty technical parts of the Web in ways that might be unfa-  miliar to you. Read through the rest of this chapter so you know what AJAX  is doing, but don’t get bogged down in the details. Nobody does it by hand!   Except for people who write AJAX libraries or books about using AJAX.  In  Chapter 10 I show a library that does all the work for you. If all these details  are making you misty-eyed, just skip ahead to the next chapter and come back  here when you’re ready to see how all the magic works.  The basicAJax.html program shown in Figure 9-1 illustrates AJAX at work.  Figure 9-1:  Click the  button and  you’ll see  some AJAX  magic.    Click the link to get a popup.  When the user clicks on the link, a small pop-up shown in Figure 9-2 appears.     If you download this file to your own machine, it will probably not run cor- rectly. That’s because AJAX relies on a Web server for its magic. AJAX code  will only work properly if it is on a Web server. If you want to test AJAX, you’ll  need to post it onto a Web host or install a server on your own machine.  Chapter 14 outlines this process. The examples are working on my Web site,  so you can always look there: www.aharrisbooks.net jad.   228 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 9-2:  This text  came from  the server.                If you don’t get the joke, you need to go rent Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  It’s part of geek culture. Trust me. In fact, you should really own a copy.  It’s very easy to make JavaScript pop up a dialog box, but the interesting  thing here is where that text came from: The data was stored on a text file  on the server. Without AJAX, there’s no easy way to get data from the server  without reloading the entire page.    You might claim that HTML frames allow you to pull data from the server, but  frames have been deprecated  labeled obsolete  in XHTML because they cause  a lot of other problems. You can use a frame to load data from the server, but  you can’t do all the other cool things with frame-based data that you can with  AJAX. Even if frames were allowed, AJAX is a much better solution most of the  time.   This particular example uses a couple of shortcuts to make it easier to  understand:  ✓ It isn’t fully asynchronous. The program will pause while it retrieves  data. As a user, you won’t even notice this, but as you’ll see, this can  have a serious drawback. It’s a bit simpler, so I start with this example  and then extend it to make the asynchronous version.  ✓ It isn’t completely cross-browser. The AJAX technique I use in this   program works fine for IE 7 and 8 and all versions of Firefox  and most  other standards-compliant browsers . It does not work correctly, how- ever, in IE 6 and earlier. I recommend you use jQuery or another library   described in Chapter 10  for cross-browser compatibility.  Look over the code, and you’ll find it reasonable enough:    Chapter 9: AJAX Essentials  229  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC  “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>     <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >   Basic AJAX      <![CDATA[  function getAJAX  {   var request = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   request.open «GET», «beast.txt», false ;   request.send null ;    if  request.status == 200 {       we got a response     alert request.responseText ;   } else {       something went wrong     alert «Error- « + request.status + «: « + request.  statusText ;    }    end if }    end function   ]]>           Basic AJAX              <button type = «button»             onclick = «getAJAX  »>       Summon the vicious beast of Caerbannog                          230 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Building the HTML form  You don’t absolutely need an HTML form for AJAX, but I have a simple one  here, complete with a button. Note that the form is not attached to the server  in any way. Here’s the code:            <button type = “button”             onclick = “getAJAX  ”>       Summon the vicious beast of Caerbannog                    The button is attached to a JavaScript function called getAJAX  .  All you really need is some kind of structure that can trigger a JavaScript  function.    AJAX isn’t a complex technology, but it does draw on several other technolo- gies. You might need to review some earlier JavaScript chapters if this mate- rial is unfamiliar to you. Although these examples don’t require PHP, they do  involve server-side responses like PHP does, so AJAX is usually studied by  people already familiar with both JavaScript and PHP. I give a brief overview  of PHP and how it is used with AJAX in Chapter 14.  Creating an XMLHttpRequest object  The key to AJAX is a special object called the XMLHttpRequest object. All  the major browsers have it, and knowing how to use it in code is what makes  AJAX work. It’s pretty easy to create with the new keyword:    var request = new XMLHttpRequest  ;     Internet Explorer, in versions 5 and 6, had an entirely different way of invoking  the XMLHttpRequest object — involving a technology called ActiveX. If you  want to support these older browsers, use one of the libraries mentioned in  Chapter 10.  I’ve decided not to worry about them in this introductory  chapter.   This line makes an instance of the XMLHttpRequest object. You’ll use meth- ods and properties of this object to control a request to the server  as shown  in Table 9-1 .    Chapter 9: AJAX Essentials  231  AJAX is really nothing more than HTTP, the protocol that your browser and  server quietly use all the time to communicate with each other. You can think  of an AJAX request like this: Imagine you have a basket with a balloon tied to  the handle and a long string. As you walk around the city, you can release the  basket under a particular window and let it rise up. The window  server  will  put something in the basket, and you can then wind the string to bring the  basket back down and retrieve the contents.   Useful Members of the XMLHttpRequest Object  Table 1-1  Member open protocol, URL,  synchronization   send parameters   status  statusText  responseText  readyState  onReadyState Change  Description Opens up a connection  to the indicated file on  the server.

Text form of status  code, a text translation  of the numeric error  code returned by status.  Gets the contents of the  basket. Is the basket empty,  going up, coming down,  or here and ready to get  contents? What should I do when  the state of the basket  changes? For example,  should I do something  when I get the basket  back?   232 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX               Don’t worry about all the details in this table. I describe these things as you  need them in the text. Also, some of these elements only pertain to asynchro- nous connections, so you won’t always need them all.  Opening a connection to the server  The XMLHttpRequest object has several useful methods. One of the most  important is the open   method. Here’s what it looks like in action:    request.open “GET”, “beast.txt”, false ;  The open   method opens up a connection to the server. As far as the  server is concerned, this connection is identical to the connection made  when the user clicks a link or submits a form. The open   method takes  three parameters:  ✓ The request method: The request method describes how the server  should process the request. Typical values are GET and POST. The use  of these values is described in Chapter 14.  ✓ A file or program name: The second parameter is the name of a file   or program on the server. This is usually a program or file in the same  directory as the current page.  ✓ A synchronization trigger: AJAX can be done in synchronous or asyn-  chronous mode.  Yeah, I know, then it’d be AJAX or SJAX, but stay with  me here.  The synchronous form is easier to understand, so I use it first.  The next example  and all the others in this book  will use the asynchro- nous approach.  For this example, I use the GET mechanism to load a file called beast.txt  from the server in synchronized mode.  Sending the request and parameters  Once you’ve opened up a request, you need to pass that request to the  server. The send   method performs this task. It also provides you a mecha- nism for sending data to the server. This arrangement only makes sense if the  request is going to a PHP program  or some other program on the server .  Because I’m just requesting a regular text document, I send the value null to  the server:    request.send null ;    Chapter 9: AJAX Essentials  233  This is a synchronous connection, so the program pauses here until the  server sends the requested file. If the server never responds, the page will  hang.  This is exactly why the normal approach is to use asynchronous con- nections.  Because this is just a test program, however, assume everything  will work okay and motor on.   Returning to the basket analogy, the send   method releases the basket,  which floats up to the window. In a synchronous connection, we’re assum- ing the basket is filled and comes down automatically. The next step won’t  happen until the basket is back on earth.  But if something goes wrong, the  next step might never happen, because the basket will never come back.   Checking the status  The next line of code won’t happen until the server passes some sort of  response back. Any HTTP request is followed by a numeric code. Normally,  your browser checks these codes automatically, and you don’t see them.  Occasionally, in the course of regular Web browsing, you run across an  HTTP error code such as 404  file not found  or 500  internal server error .  If the server was able to respond to the request, it will pass a status code  of 200.  You never see a 200 status code in ordinary browsing, because  that means the page request was successful, so you see the page.  The  XMLHttpRequest object has a property called status that returns the  HTTP status code. If status is 200, then everything went fine and you can  proceed. If status is any other value, some type of error occurred.   Fun with HTTP response codes  Just like the post office stamping success error  messages on your envelope, the server sends  back status messages with your request. You  can see all the possible status codes on the  World  Wide  Web  Consortium’s  Web  site  at  www.w3.org Protocols rfc2616  rfc2616-sec10.html, but the important  ones to get you started are as follows:  ✓  200 = OK: This is a success code. Everything  went  okay,  and  your  response  has  been  returned.   ✓  400 = Bad Request: This is a client error  code. It means that something went wrong   on the user side. The request was poorly  formed and couldn’t be understood.   ✓  404 = Not Found: This is a client error code.  The page the user requested doesn’t exist  or couldn’t be found.   ✓  408  =  Request  Timeout:  This  is  a  client  error code. The server gave up on waiting  for the user’s computer to finish making its  request.   ✓  500 = Internal Server Error: This is a server  error code. It means that the server had an  error and couldn’t fill the request.   234 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   You’ll want to make sure that the status of the request is successful before  you run the code that’s dependant upon the request. You can check for all  the various status codes if you want, but for this simple example I’m just  ensuring that status is 200:    if  request.status == 200 {       we got a response     alert request.responseText ;   } else {       something went wrong     alert “Error- “ + request.status + “: “ + request.  statusText ;    }    end if  The request.status property will contain the server’s response. If this  value is 200, I want to do something with the results. In this case, I simply  display the text in an alert box. If the request is anything but 200, I use the  statusText property to determine what went wrong and pass that informa- tion to the user in an alert.  Using the status property is like looking at the basket after it returns: The  container might have the requested data in it, or it might have some sort of  note  along the lines of “Sorry, the window was closed. I couldn’t fulfill your  request.” . There’s not much point in processing the data if it didn’t return  successfully.  Of course, I could do a lot more with the data. If it’s already formatted as  HTML code, I can use the innerHTML DOM tricks described in Chapter 6 to  display the code in any part of my page. If I’m dealing with some other type  of formatted data  XML or JSON , I can manipulate it with JavaScript and do  whatever I want with it. This technique is described in Chapter 14.  All Together Now: Making the  Connection Asynchronous  The synchronous AJAX connection described in the previous section is easy  to understand, but it has one major drawback: The client’s page completely  stops processing while waiting for a response from the server. This might not  seem like a big problem at first glance, but it is. If aliens attack the Web server,  it won’t make the connection, and the rest of the page will never be activated.  The user’s browser will hang indefinitely. In most cases, the user will have to  shut down the browser process with Ctl+Alt+Del  or the similar procedure on  other OSs . Obviously it would be best to prevent this kind of error.    Chapter 9: AJAX Essentials  235  That’s why most AJAX calls use the asynchronous technique. Here’s the big  difference: When you send an asynchronous request, the client keeps on  processing the rest of the page. When the request is complete, an event han- dler processes the event. If the server goes down, the browser will not hang   although the page probably won’t do what you want .  In other words, the readyState property is like looking at the basket’s prog- ress. The basket could be sitting there empty, because you haven’t begun the  process. It could be going up to the window, being filled, coming back down,  or it could be down and ready to use. You’re only concerned with the last  state  ready , because that means the data is ready.     I didn’t include a figure showing the asynchronous version, because to the  user, it looks exactly the same as the synchronous connection. Be sure to put  this code on your own server and check it out for yourself.  Or of course just  look at it on my server.   The asynchronous version looks exactly the same on the front end, but the  code is structured a little differently:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC  “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN”  “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>     <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >   asynch.html      <![CDATA[  var request;    make request a global variable  function getAJAX  {   request = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   request.open «GET», «beast.txt» ;   request.onreadystatechange = checkData;   request.send null ; }    end function  function checkData  {   if  request.readyState == 4  {        if state is finished     if  request.status == 200  {          and if attempt was successful       alert request.responseText ;     }    end if   }    end if }    end checkData   236 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX     ]]>           Asynchronous AJAX transmission             <button type = «button»             onclick = «getAJAX  »>       Summon the beast of Caerbannogh                  Setting up the program  The general setup of this program is just like the earlier AJAX example. The  HTML is a simple button which calls the getAJAX   function.   The JavaScript code now has two functions. The getAJAX   function sets  up the request, but a separate function  checkData    responds to the  request. In an asynchronous AJAX model, it’s typical to separate the request  and the response in different functions.   Note that in the JavaScript code, I made the XMLHttpRequest object — the  request object — into a global variable by declaring it outside any func- tions. I generally avoid making global variables, but it makes sense in this  case because I have two different functions that require the request object.  Look over Chapter 5 if you need a refresher on the advantages and disadvan- tages of global variables.  Building the getAJAX   function  The getAJAX   function sets up and executes the communication with the  server.     Chapter 9: AJAX Essentials  237                     function getAJAX  {   request = new XMLHttpRequest  ;   request.open “GET”, “beast.txt” ;   request.onreadystatechange = checkData;   request.send null ; }    end function  The code in this function is pretty straightforward. Here’s what you do:  1.  Create the request object.    The request object is created exactly as it was in the first example.  2.  Call the request’s open   method to open a connection.    Note that this time I left the synchronous parameter out, which creates  the  default  asynchronous connection.  3.  Assign an event handler to catch responses.    You can use event handlers much like the ones in the DOM. In this  particular case I’m telling the request object to call a function called  checkData whenever the state of the request changes.   You can’t easily send a parameter to a function when you call it using  this particular mechanism. That’s why I made request a global variable.      4.  Send the request.    As before, the send   method begins the process. Because this is now  an asynchronous connection, the rest of the page will continue to pro- cess. As soon as the request’s state changes  hopefully because there’s  been a successful transfer , the checkData   function will be activated.  Reading the response  Of course, you now need a function to handle the response when it comes  back from the server. This works by checking the ready state of the  response. Any HTTP request has a ready state, which is a simple integer  value describing what state the request is currently in. There are many ready  states, but the only one we’re concerned with is 4, because it means the  request is finished and ready to process.    238 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Ready, set, readyState!  The readyState property of the request  object indicates the ready state of the request.  It has five possible values:  ✓  0 = Uninitialized: The request  object  has been created, but the open   method  hasn’t been called on.   ✓  1 = Loading: The request  object has  been  created,  the  open    method  has  been  called,  but  the  send    method  hasn’t been called.   ✓  2  =  Loaded:  The  request  object  has  been  created,  the  open    method  has  been called, the send   method has been  called, but the response isn’t yet available  from the server.   ✓  3 = Interactive: The request object has  been  created,  the  open    method  has   been called, the send   method has been  called, the response has started trickling  back  from  the  server,  but  not  everything  has been received yet.   ✓  4  =  Completed:  The  request  object  has  been  created,  the  open    method  has been called, the send   method has  been called, the response has been fully  received, and the request object is fin- ished with all its request response tasks.  Each time the readyState property of the  request  changes,  the  function  you  map  to  readyStateChanged is called. In a typi- cal AJAX program, this will happen four times  per transaction. There’s no point in reading the  data until the transaction is completed, which  will happen when readyState is equal to 4.   The basic strategy for checking a response is to check the ready state in the  aptly-named request.readyState property. If the ready state is 4, check  the status code to ensure there’s no error. If ready state is 4 and status is 200,  you’re in business, so you can process the form. Here’s the code:  function checkData  {   if  request.readyState == 4  {        if state is finished     if  request.status == 200  {          and if attempt was successful       alert request.responseText ;     }    end if   }    end if }    end checkData  Once again, you can do anything you want with the text you receive. I’m just  printing it out, but the data can be incorporated into the page or processed  in any way you want.   Chapter 10  Improving JavaScript and   AJAX with jQuery  In This Chapter ▶ Downloading and including the jQuery library ▶ Making an AJAX request with jQuery ▶ Using component selectors ▶ Adding events to components ▶ Creating a simple content management system with jQuery  JavaScript has amazing capabilities. It’s useful on its own and when you add   AJAX, it becomes incredibly powerful. However, JavaScript can be tedious.  There’s a lot to remember, and it can be a real pain to handle multiple platform  issues. Some tasks  like AJAX  are a bit complex and require a lot of steps.  Regardless of the task, there are always browser compatibility issues to deal with.  AJAX libraries have come to the rescue, and the jQuery library in particular  is a powerful tool for simplifying AJAX. This chapter explains what JavaScript  Libraries can do and introduces you to one of the most popular libraries in  current use.  Introducing JavaScript Libraries  For these reasons, Web programmers began to compile commonly used  functions into reusable libraries. These libraries became more powerful over  time, and some of them have now become fundamental to Web development.  As these libraries became more powerful, the libraries not only added AJAX  capabilities, but many library developers also add features to JavaScript  DOM programming that were once available only in traditional programming  languages. Many of these libraries allow for a new visual aesthetic as well as  enhanced technical capabilities. In fact, most applications considered part of  the Web 2.0 revolution are based in part on one of these libraries.   240 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   What is Web 2.0?  I’m almost reluctant to mention the term Web  2.0  here  because  it  isn’t  really  a  very  useful  description. There are actually three main ways  people describe Web 2.0  if such a thing really  exists . Some talk about Web 2.0 as a design paradigm   lots of white space, simple color schemes, and  rounded corners . I believe the visual trends  will evolve to something else, and that other  aspects  of  the  Web  2.0  sensibility  will  have  longer-lasting impact. The technical aspects of Web 2.0  heavy use  of AJAX and libraries to make Web program- ming  more  like  traditional  programming   are  more important than the visual aspects. These  technologies  make  it  possible  to  build  Web   applications  in  much  the  same  way  desktop  applications are now created.  I personally think the most important emerging  model of the Web is the change in the commu- nication paradigm. Web 2.0 is no longer about  a top-down broadcast model of communica- tion, but more of a conversation among users  of  a  site  or  system.  Although  the  visual  and  technical aspects are important, the changing  relationship between producers and users of  information is perhaps even more profound.  The  design  and  communication  aspects  are  fascinating, but this book focuses on the tech- nical aspects. When you can actually work in  Web 2.0 technologies, you can decide for your- self how to express the technology visually and  socially. I can’t wait to see what you produce.  A number of very powerful JavaScript AJAX libraries are available. All make  basic JavaScript easier, and each has its own learning curve. No library will  write code for you, but a good library can handle some of the drudgery and  let you work instead on the creative aspects of your program. JavaScript  libraries can let you work at a higher level than plain JavaScript, so you can  write more elaborate pages in less time.  Several important JavaScript AJAX libraries are available. Here are a few of  the most prominent:  ✓ DOJO  www.dojotoolkit.org  : A very powerful library that includes  a series of user interface widgets  like those in Visual Basic and Java  as  well as AJAX features.  ✓ MochiKit  http:  mochikit.com  : A nice lower-level set of   JavaScript functions to improve JavaScript programming. It makes  JavaScript act much more like the Python language, with an interactive  interpreter.  ✓ Prototype  www.prototypejs.org  : One of the first AJAX libraries   to become popular. Includes great support for AJAX and extensions for  user interface objects  through the scriptaculous extension .              Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  241  ✓ YUI Yahoo! Interface Library  http:  developer.yahoo.com   yui  : This is the library used by Yahoo! for all its AJAX applications. It  has released this impressive library as open source.  ✓ jQuery  http:  jquery.com  : jQuery has emerged as one of the   more popular JavaScript and AJAX libraries. It’s the library I emphasize  in this book.  Getting to Know jQuery  This book focuses on the jQuery library. Although many outstanding AJAX  JavaScript libraries are available, jQuery has quickly become one of the most  prominent. There are many reasons for the popularity of jQuery:  ✓ It’s a powerful library. The jQuery system can do all kinds of impressive   things to make your JavaScript easier to write.  ✓ It’s lightweight. You’ll need to include a reference to your library in  every file that needs it. The entire jQuery library fits in 55K, which is  smaller than many image files. It won’t have a significant impact on  download speed.   ✓ It supports a flexible selection mechanism. jQuery greatly simplifies  and expands the document.getElementById mechanism that’s cen- tral to DOM manipulation.  ✓ It has great animation support. You can use jQuery to make elements   appear and fade, move and slide.  ✓ It makes AJAX queries trivial. You’ll be shocked at how easy AJAX is   with jQuery.  ✓ It has an enhanced event mechanism. JavaScript has very limited sup- port for events. jQuery adds a very powerful tool for adding event han- dlers to nearly any element.  ✓ It provides cross-platform support. The jQuery library tries to manage   browser-compatibility issues for you, so you don’t have to stress so  much about exactly which browser is being used.  ✓ It supports user interface widgets. jQuery comes with a powerful user  interface library including tools HTML doesn’t have, like drag-and-drop  controls, sliders, and date pickers.  ✓ It’s highly extensible. jQuery has a plugin library that supports all kinds   of optional features, including new widgets and tools like audio integra- tion, image galleries, menus, and much more.                                    242 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX            ✓ It introduces powerful new programming ideas. jQuery is a great tool  for learning about some really interesting ideas like functional program- ming and chainable objects. I explain these as you encounter them.  ✓ It’s free and open source. It’s available under an open-source license,   which means it costs nothing to use, and you can look it over and  change it if you want.  ✓ It’s reasonably typical. If you choose to use a different AJAX library,   you’ll still be able to transfer the ideas you learned in jQuery.  Installing jQuery  The jQuery library is easy to install and use. Just go to http:  jquery.com  and download the current version  1.3.2 as of this writing . Store the result- ing .js file  jQuery-1.3.2.min.js  in your working directory.    You might be able to choose from a number of versions of the file. I recom- mend the minimized version. To make this file as small as possible, every  single unnecessary character  including spaces and carriage returns  has  been removed. This file is very compact, but it’s difficult to read. You can  download the nonminimized version if you want to actually read the code, but  it’s generally better to include the minimized version in your programs.  That’s basically all there is to it. Download the file and place it in the direc- tory where you want to work.  To incorporate the library in your pages, simply link it as an external  JavaScript file:      <script type = “text javascript”             src = “jquery-1.3.2.min.js”>   Be sure to include this script before you write or include other code that  refers to jQuery.  Importing jQuery from Google  Easy as it is to download jQuery, there’s another great way to add jQuery   and other AJAX library  support to your pages without downloading any- thing. Google has a publicly available version of several important libraries   including jQuery  that you can download from the Google servers. This  method has a couple of interesting advantages:    Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  243                     ✓ You don’t have to install any libraries. All the library files stay on the   Google servers.  ✓ The library is automatically updated. You always have access to the  latest version of the library without making any changes to your code.  ✓ The library might load faster. The first time one of your pages reads the  library from Google’s servers, you have to wait for the full download, but  then the library is stored in cache  a form of browser memory  so subse- quent requests will be essentially immediate.  Here’s how you do it:  <script type = “text javacript”         src=”http:  www.google.com jsapi”>        <[CDATA[      Load jQuery   google.load “jquery”, “1” ;        your code here      ]]>    Essentially, loading jQuery from Google is a two-step process:  1.  Load the Google API from Google.     Use the first   tag to refer to the Google AJAX API server. This  gives you access to the google.load   function.  2.  Invoke google.load   to load jQuery.     The first parameter is the name of the library you want to load. The  second parameter is the version number. If you leave this parameter  blank, you get the latest version. If you specify a number, Google gives  you the latest variation of that version. In my example, I want the latest  variation of version 1, but not version 2. Although version 2 doesn’t exist  yet, I expect it to have major changes, and I don’t want any surprises.   Note that you don’t need to install any files locally to use the Google  approach.  Using jQuery with Aptana  The Aptana editor is amazing. One of its most impressive features is the way  it helps you build AJAX applications with several libraries. It has built-in    244 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   support for jQuery, which is quite easy to use. Follow these steps to build a  jQuery project within Aptana:  1.  Create a new default Web project.     Many developers ignore the project mechanism in Aptana and simply  create individual files. The project tool allows you to group a series of  files. The Web Project Wizard  invoked when you create a new Web proj- ect  allows automatic integration of an AJAX library.  2.  Select jQuery from the libraries wizard.    After you’ve entered a name for your project, you’re given a list of AJAX  libraries you can add to the project, as shown in Figure 10-1. Pick jQuery  from this list.  3.  Do not create a hosted site.    The hosted site option allows you to simultaneously create an online ver- sion of your site within Aptana’s server structure  the cloud . Although  this is an excellent option for commercial sites, you need to pay for server  access, and that isn’t necessary when you’re just starting out.                     Figure 10-1:  Aptana  has built-in  support for  many AJAX  libraries.      Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  245                      4.  Look over your new project.     Aptana creates a directory structure for your project. It automatically  includes access to the source files for jQuery.  5.  Add a script tag to your index.html document.     As you begin to write the src attribute, the autocomplete feature helps  you include the jQuery files.  6.  jQuery functions are now supported in your editor.     As you write JavaScript code, Aptana gives you code completion hints  for jQuery functions as if they were built into JavaScript. If you’re run- ning an up-to-date version of Aptana, it already has the latest version of  jQuery and attaches it to your project.  7.  Note that now you’re working in a project.     Aptana’s project mechanism allows you to save an entire group of files   including the jQuery library together  so you can open them as one  unit.    All these options for managing jQuery can be dizzying. Use whichever tech-  nique works best for you. I actually prefer using the local code, rather than the  Google or Aptana solutions, because I find it easier, and this method works  even if I’m offline. For smaller projects  like the demonstrations in this chap- ter , I don’t like the overhead of the Aptana solution or the online requirement  of Google. In this chapter, I simply refer to a local copy of the jQuery file.  Writing Your First jQuery App  As an introduction to jQuery, I show you how to build an application that you  can already create in JavaScript DOM. The following sections introduce you  to some powerful features of jQuery. Figure 10-2 illustrates the change.html  page at work, but the interesting stuff  as usual  is under the hood.  Figure 10-2:  The content  of this page  is modified  with jQuery.        246 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Setting up the page  At first, the jQuery app doesn’t look much different than any other HTML  JavaScript code you’ve already written, but the JavaScript code is a bit differ- ent. Take a look at how jQuery simplifies this JavaScript code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >     change.html    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                       <![CDATA[     function changeMe  {       $ «output» .html «I changed» ;     }               ]]>                  Basic jQuery demo              Did this change?               If you’re already knowledgeable about jQuery, you might be horrified at my  use of body onload in this example. jQuery provides a wonderful alternative  to the onload mechanism, but I want to introduce only one big new idea at a  time. The next example illustrates the jQuery alternative to body onload and  explains why it is such an improvement.  The basic features of change.html are utterly unsurprising:        ✓ The HTML has a div named output. This div initially says “Did this   change?” The code should change the content to something else.  ✓ The HTML calls a function called changeme   when the body finishes   loading. This is a mechanism used frequently in DOM programming,  although you see a new way to do this in the next section.    Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  247        ✓ There is a reference to the jQuery library. Any page that uses jQuery must   load it using one of the mechanisms described earlier in this chapter.  ✓ The changeme   function looks really crazy. When you run the pro-  gram, you can tell what it does. The code gets a reference to the output  div and changes its innerHTML property to reflect a new value  “I  changed” . However, the syntax is really new. All that functionality got  packed into one line of  funky looking  code.  Meet the jQuery node object  The secret behind jQuery’s power is the underlying data model. jQuery has  a unique way of looking at the DOM that’s more powerful than the standard  object model. Understanding the way this works is the key to powerful pro- gramming with jQuery.  The jQuery node is a special object that adds a lot of functionality to the  ordinary DOM element. Any element on the Web page  any link, div, head- ing, or whatever  can be defined as a jQuery node. You can also make a list of  jQuery nodes based on tag types, so you can have a jQuery object that stores  a list of all the paragraphs on the page, or all the objects with a particular  class name. The jQuery object has very useful methods like html  , which is  used to change the innerHTML property of an element.    The jQuery node is based on the basic DOM node, so it can be created from   any DOM element. However, it also adds significant new features. This is a  good example of the object-oriented philosophy.   You can create a jQuery object in many ways, but the simplest is through the  special $   function. You can place an identifier  very similar to CSS identi- fiers  inside the function to build a jQuery object based on an element. For  example,  var jQoutput = $ “output” ;   creates a variable called jQoutput, which contains a jQuery object based on  the output element. It’s similar to   var DOMoutput = document.getElementById “output” ;  The jQuery approach is a little cleaner, and it doesn’t get a reference to a  DOM object  as the getElementById technique does , but it makes a new  object called the jQuery object, which is an enhanced DOM object. Don’t  worry if this is a little hard to understand. It gets easier as you get used to it.   248 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Because jQoutput is a jQuery object, it has some powerful methods. You  can change the content of the object with the html   method. The following  two lines are equivalent:  jQoutput.html “I’ve changed” ;   jQuery version DOMoutput.innerHTML = “I’ve changed”;   ordinary JS   DOM  jQuery doesn’t require you to create variables for each object, so the code in  the changeMe   function can look like this:    build a variable and then modify it var jQoutput = $ “output” ;  jQoutput.html “I’ve changed” ;  Or you can shorten it like this:        $ “output” .html “I changed” ;  This last version is how the program is actually written. It’s very common  to refer to an object with the $   mechanism and immediately perform a  method on that object as I’ve done here.  Creating an Initialization Function        Many pages require an initialization function. This is a function that’s run early  to set up the rest of the page. The body onload mechanism is frequently used  in DOM JavaScript to make pages load as soon as the document has begun  loading. I describe this technique in Chapter 8. Although body onload does  this job well, the traditional technique has a couple of problems:  ✓ It requires making a change to the HTML. Really the JavaScript code   should be completely separated from HTML. You shouldn’t have to  change your HTML at all to make it work with JavaScript.  ✓ The timing still isn’t quite right. Code specified in body unload  doesn’t execute until after the entire page is displayed. It would be  better if the code was registered after the DOM is loaded but before the  page displays.  Using $ document .ready    jQuery has a great alternative to body onload that overcomes its draw- backs. Take a look at the code for ready.html to see how it works:    Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  249  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >     ready.html    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                       <![CDATA[     $ document .ready changeMe ;          function changeMe  {       $ «output» .html «I changed» ;     }               ]]>              Using the document.ready mechanism              Did this change?                     This code is much like the change.html, but it uses the jQuery technique  for running initialization code:  ✓ The   tag no longer has an onload attribute. This is a common  feature of jQuery programming. The HTML no longer has direct links to  the JavaScript because jQuery lets the JavaScript code attach itself to  the Web page.  ✓ The initialization function is created with the $ document .ready     function. This technique tells the browser to execute a function when  the DOM has finished loading  so it has access to all elements of the  form  but before the page is displayed  so any effects of the form appear  instantaneous to the user .  ✓ $ document  makes a jQuery object from the whole document.   The entire document can be turned into a jQuery object by specifying  document inside the $   function. Note that you don’t use quotes in  this case.   250 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX      ✓ The function specified is automatically run. In this particular case, I   want to run the changeMe   function, so I place it in the parameter of  the ready   method. Note that I’m referring to changeMe as a variable,  so it has no quotes or parentheses.  Look at Chapter 8 for more discus- sion of referring to functions as variables.     You might see several other places  particularly in event handling  where   jQuery expects a function as a parameter. Such a function is frequently  referred to as a callback function because it is called after some sort of event  has occurred. You might also notice callback functions that respond to key- board events, mouse motion, and the completion of an AJAX request.  Programmers sometimes use shortcuts instead of document.ready because  it’s so common to run initialization code. You can shorten   Discovering alternatives  to document.ready      $ document .ready changeMe ;  to the following code:      $ changeMe ;  If this code isn’t defined inside a function and changeMe is a function defined  on the page, jQuery automatically runs the function directly just like the  document.ready approach.  It’s also possible to create an anonymous function directly:      $ document .ready function  {       $ “output” .html “I changed” ;     } ;  I think this method is cumbersome, but jQuery code frequently uses this  technique.   Investigating the jQuery Object  The jQuery object is interesting because it’s easy to create from a variety of  DOM elements and because it adds wonderful new features to these elements.     Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  251  Changing the style of an element  If you can dynamically change the CSS of an element, you can do quite a lot to  it. jQuery makes this process quite easy. When you have a jQuery object, you  can use the css method to add or change any CSS attributes of the object.  Take a look at styleElement.html shown in Figure 10-3 for an example.  Figure 10-3:  All the  styles here  are applied  dynamically  by jQuery  functions.       The code displays a terseness common to jQuery code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                       <![CDATA[     $ init ;          function init  {       $ «h1» .css «backgroundColor», «yellow» ;              $ «myParagraph» .css {«backgroundColor»:»black»,                              «color»:»white»} ;              $ «.bordered» .css «border», «1px solid black» ;     }       ]]>        styleElements.html    252 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX            I’m a level one heading              I’m a paragraph with the id «myParagraph.»                        I have a border.                        I have a border too.            This program has a few interesting things going on in it. Take a look at the  HTML.  ✓ It contains an   tag. I’m aware that’s not too exciting, but I use it to   show how to target elements by DOM type.  ✓ A paragraph has the ID myParagraph. This paragraph is used to illus-  trate how to target an element by ID.  ✓ Two elements have the class bordered. In ordinary DOM work, you   can’t easily apply code to all elements of a particular class, but jQuery  makes it easy.  ✓ Several elements have custom CSS, but no CSS is defined. The jQuery   code changes all the CSS dynamically.  The init   function is identified as the function to be run when the docu- ment is ready. In this function, I use the powerful CSS method to change each  element’s CSS dynamically. I come back to the CSS in a moment, but first  notice how the various elements are targeted.  Selecting jQuery objects  jQuery gives you several alternatives for creating jQuery objects from the  DOM elements. In general, you use the same rules to select objects in jQuery  as you do in CSS:  ✓ DOM elements are targeted as-is. You can include any DOM element inside   the $ “”  mechanism to target all similar elements. For example, use  $ “h1”  to refer to all h1 objects, or $ “p”  to refer to all paragraphs. ✓ Use the  identifier to target a particular ID. This works exactly the   same as CSS. If you have an element with the ID myThing, use this code:  $ “myThing” .                      Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  253        ✓ Use the . identifier to target members of a class. Again, this is the same   mechanism you use in CSS, so all elements with the class bordered  attached to them can be modified with this code: $ “.bordered” .  ✓ You can even use complex identifiers. You can use complex CSS identi-  fiers like $ “li img” ; this identifier targets only images inside a list  item.   These selection methods  all borrowed from familiar CSS notation  add  incredible flexibility to your code. You can now easily select elements in your  JavaScript code according to the same rules you use to identify elements  in CSS.  Modifying the style  After you’ve identified an object or a set of objects, you can apply jQuery  methods. One very powerful and easy method is the style   method. The  basic form of this method takes two parameters: a style rule and value. For  example, to make the background color of all h1 objects yellow, I used the  following code:        $ “h1” .css “backgroundColor”, “yellow” ;  If you apply a style rule to a collection of objects  like all h1 objects or all  objects with the bordered class , the same rule is instantly applied to all the  objects.  A more powerful variation of the style rule allows you to apply several CSS  styles at once. It takes a single object in JSON notation  JavaScript Object  Notation described in Chapter 5  as its argument:        $ “myParagraph” .css {“backgroundColor”:”black”,                              “color”:”white”} ;  This example uses a JSON object defined as a series of rule value pairs. If you  need a refresher on how JSON objects work, look at Chapter 5.  Adding Events to Objects  The jQuery library adds another extremely powerful capability to JavaScript.  It allows you to easily attach events to any jQuery object. As an example, take  a look at hover.html, shown in Figure 10-4.  When you move the mouse pointer over any list item, a border appears over  the item. This effect would be difficult to achieve in ordinary DOM JavaScript,  but it’s pretty easy to manage in jQuery.    254 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 10-4:  A border  appears  around each  list item  when the  mouse is  over it.       Adding a hover event  Look at the code to see how it works:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>             <![CDATA[     $ init ;          function init  {       $ «li» .hover border, noBorder ;     }    end init          function border  {       $ this .css «border», «1px solid black» ;     }          function noBorder  {       $ this .css «border», «0px none black» ;           }             ]]>         hover.html     Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  255         Hover Demo               alpha         beta         gamma         delta                      The HTML couldn’t be simpler: It’s an unordered list. The JavaScript isn’t  much more complex. It consists of three one-line functions.  ✓ init  : This function is called when the document is ready. It makes   jQuery objects out of all list items and attaches the hover event to  them. hover accepts two parameters. The first is a function to be called  when the mouse hovers over the object. The second parameter is a  function to be called when the mouse leaves the object.  ✓ border  : This function draws a border around the current element.   The $ this  identifier is used to specify the current object. In this  example, I use the css function to draw a border around the object.  ✓ noBorder  : It’s very similar to the border   function, but it removes   a border from the current object.  In this example, I used three different functions. Many jQuery programmers  prefer to use anonymous functions  sometimes called lambda functions  to  enclose the entire functionality in one long line:         $ “li” .hover          function  {           $ this .css “border”, “1px solid black” ;         },         function  {           $ this .css “border”, “0px none black” ;         }        ;  Note that this is still technically a single line of code. Instead of referencing  two functions that have already been created, I build the functions immedi- ately where they’re needed. Each function definition is a parameter to the  hover   method.   256 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   jQuery events  jQuery  supports  a  number  of  other  events.  Any jQuery node can read any of the following  events:  ✓  change:  The  content  of  the  element    ✓  click: The user clicks the element.  ✓  dblClick:  The  user  double-clicks  the   changes.  element.   ✓  focus: The user selects the element.   ✓  keydown: The user presses a key while   the element has the focus.   ✓  hover: The mouse is over the element —  a second function is called when the mouse  leaves the element.   ✓  mouseDown: A mouse button is pressed   over the element.   ✓  select: The user selects text in a text-  style input.  If you’re a computer scientist, you might argue that this isn’t a perfect example  of a lambda function, and you would be correct. The important thing is to notice  that some ideas of functional programming  such as lambda functions  are  creeping into mainstream AJAX programming, and that’s an exciting develop- ment. If you just mutter “lambda” and then walk away, people will assume you’re  some kind of geeky computer scientist. What could be more fun than that?   Although I’m perfectly comfortable with anonymous functions, I often find  the named-function approach easier to read, so I tend to use complete named  functions more often.  Changing classes on the fly  jQuery supports another wonderful feature. You can define a CSS style and  then add or remove that style from an element dynamically. Figure 10-5 shows  a page with the ability to dynamically modify the border of any list item.        Figure 10-5:  Click a list  item to  toggle its  border on  and off.      Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  257  The code for class.html shows how easy this kind of feature is to add:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >           .bordered {        border: 1px solid black;      }         <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>              <![CDATA[     $ init ;          function init  {       $ «li» .click toggleBorder ;     }    end init          function toggleBorder  {       $ this .toggleClass «bordered» ;     }       ]]>         class.html                                       Class Demo               alpha         beta         gamma         delta              Here’s how to make this program:  1.  Begin with a basic HTML page.          All the interesting stuff happens in CSS and JavaScript, so the actual con- tents of the page aren’t that critical.   258 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   2.  Create a class you want to add and remove.     I build a CSS class called bordered, which simply draws a border  around the element. Of course, you can make a much more sophisti- cated CSS class with all kinds of formatting if you prefer.  3.  Link an init   method.     As you’re beginning to see, most jQuery applications require some sort  of initialization. I normally call the first function init  .   4.  Call the toggleBorder   function whenever the user clicks a list   item.    The init   method simply sets up an event handler. Whenever a list  item receives the click event  that is, the list item is clicked , the tog- gleBorder   function should be activated.  5.  The toggleBorder   function, well, toggles the border.     jQuery has several methods for manipulating the class of an element.  addClass   assigns a class to the element, removeClass   removes  a class definition from an element, and toggleClass   switches the  class  by adding the class if it isn’t currently attached or removing it  otherwise .  Making an AJAX Request with jQuery  The primary purpose of an AJAX library like jQuery is to simplify AJAX  requests. It’s hard to believe how easy this can be with jQuery. Figure 10-6  shows ajax.html, a page with a basic AJAX query.                          Figure 10-6:  The text file  is requested  with an  AJAX call.    Including a text file with AJAX  The ajax.html program is very similar in function to the asynch.html pro- gram described in Chapter 9, but the code is much cleaner:    Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  259  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >      ajax.html      <script type = «text javascript»             src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                             <![CDATA[       $ document .ready getAJAX ;              function getAJAX  {         $ «output» .load «hello.txt» ;               }         ]]>                               The HTML is very clean  as you should expect from jQuery examples . It  simply creates an empty div called output.  The JavaScript code isn’t much more complex. A standard $ document . ready function calls the getAJAX   function as soon as the document is  ready. The getAJAX   function simply creates a jQuery node based on the  output div and loads the file hello.txt through a basic AJAX request.    This example does use AJAX, so if it isn’t working, you might need to review   how AJAX works. You should run a program using AJAX through a Web  server, not just from a local file. Also, the file being read should be on the  same server as the program making the AJAX request.   I cover more sophisticated AJAX techniques in Chapter 14. The load    mechanism is suitable for a basic situation where you want to load a plain  text or HTML code snippet into your pages.   260 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Building a poor man’s CMS with AJAX  AJAX and jQuery can be a very useful way to build efficient Web sites even  without server-side programming. Frequently a Web site is based on a series  of smaller elements that can be swapped and reused. Such a technique is  called a CMS  content management system . You can use AJAX to build a  framework that allows easy reuse and modification of Web content.   As an example, take a look at cmsAJAX shown in Figure 10-7.  Figure 10-7:  This page  is actually  created  dynamically  with AJAX  and jQuery.       Although there’s nothing all that shocking about the page from the user’s  perspective, a look at the code shows some surprises:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>          <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  261       CMS Standard Template      <link rel = «stylesheet»           type = «text css»           href = «cmsStd.css»  >     <script type = «text javascript»             src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                <![CDATA[       $ init ;              function init  {         $ «heading» .load «head.html» ;         $ «menu» .load «menu.html» ;         $ «content1» .load «story1.html» ;         $ «content2» .load «story2.html» ;         $ «footer» .load «footer.html» ;       };         ]]>                                                                                     <div class = «content»            id = «content1»>                        <div class = «content»            id = «content2»>                                                         The code has these interesting features:     ✓ The page has no content! All the divs are empty. None of the text   shown in Figure 10-7 is present in this document, but all is pulled from  smaller files dynamically.   262 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                  ✓ The page consists of empty, named divs. Rather than any particular   content, the page consists of placeholders with IDs.  ✓ It uses jQuery. The jQuery library is used to vastly simplify loading data   through AJAX calls.  ✓ All contents are in separate files. The directory has very simple HTML   files containing small parts of the page. For example, story1.html  looks like this:   HTML   XHTML CSS All in One for Dummies     This book begins at the very beginning, teaching you how to build great web pages with XHTML and CSS. You’ll learn how to build  standards-compliant pages, and how to dress them up with CSS.  You also learn how to add interactivity with JavaScript, how to  harness the power of server-side programming with PHP, and how to build databases with MySQL. All the tools necessary are included free on the CD-ROM.             http:  www.aharrisbooks.net xfd      ✓ The init   method runs on document.ready. When the document is   ready, the page runs the init   method.  ✓ The init   method uses AJAX calls to dynamically load content. It’s   nothing more than a series of jQuery load   methods.  This approach might seem like a lot of work, but it has some very interesting  characteristics. If you’re building a large site with several pages, you usu- ally want to design the visual appearance once and re-use the same general  template over and over again. Also, you’ll probably have some elements   such as the menu and heading  that will be consistent over several pages.  You could simply create a default document and copy and paste it for each  page, but this approach gets messy. What happens if you have created 100  pages according to a template and then need to add something to the menu  or change the header? You would need to make the change on 100 different  pages.  The advantage of the template-style approach is code reuse. Just like use of  an external style allows you to multiply a style sheet across hundreds of doc- uments, designing a template without content allows you to store code snip- pets in smaller files and reuse them. All 100 pages point to the same menu     Chapter 10: Improving JavaScript and AJAX with jQuery  263                           file, so if you want to change the menu, you change one file and everything  changes with it.  Here’s how you use this sort of approach:  1.  Create a single template for your entire site.     Build basic HTML and CSS to manage the overall look and feel for your  entire site. Don’t worry about content yet. Just build placeholders for  all the components of your page. Be sure to give each element an ID and  write the CSS to get things positioned as you wish.  2.  Add jQuery support.     Make a link to the jQuery library, and make a default init   method.  Put code to handle populating those parts of the page that will always  be consistent.  I use the template shown here exactly as it is.   3.  Duplicate the template.     When you have a sense how the template will work, make a copy for  each page of your site.   4.  Customize each page by changing the init   function.     The only part of the template that changes is the init   function. All  your pages will be identical, except they will have customized init    functions that load different content.   5.  Load custom content into the divs with AJAX.     Use the init   function to load content into each div. Build more con- tent as small files to create new pages.    This is a great way to manage content, but it isn’t quite a full-blown content   management system. Even AJAX can’t quite allow you to store content on the  Web. More complex content management systems use databases rather than  files to handle content. You need some sort of server-side programming  like  PHP  and usually a database  like mySQL  to handle this sort of work. I intro- duce these topics in Chapter 14.   264 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX    Chapter 11  Animating jQuery  In This Chapter ▶ Setting up for animation ▶ Hiding and showing elements with jQuery ▶ Fading elements in and out ▶ Adding a callback function to a transition ▶ Understanding object chaining ▶ Modifying elements ▶ Using selection filters  The jQuery library simplifies a lot of JavaScript coding. One of its biggest   advantages is how it allows you to add features that would be difficult to   achieve in ordinary JavaScript and DOM  document object model  programming.  This chapter teaches you to shake and bake your programs by identifying spe- cific objects; moving them around; and making them appear, slide, and fade.  Getting Prepared for Animation  To get your jQuery animation career started, take a look at hideShow.html,  shown in Figure 11-1.  The hideShow program looks simple at first, but it does some very interest- ing things. All of the level-two headings are actually buttons, so when you  click them, fun stuff happens:   ✓ The Show button displays a previously hidden element. Figure 11-2   demonstrates the new content.  ✓ The Hide button hides the content. The behavior of the hide button   is pretty obvious. If the content is showing, clicking the button makes it  disappear instantly.  ✓ The Toggle button swaps the visibility of the content. If the content is   currently visible, clicking the button hides it. If it is hidden, a click of the  button makes it show up.            266 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 11-1:  At first, the  page shows  nothing  much.                            ✓ The Slide Down button makes the content transition in. The slide   down transition acts like a window shade being pulled down to make the  content visible through a basic animation.  ✓ The Slide Up button transitions the content out. This animation looks   like a window shade being pulled up to hide the content.  ✓ The Fade In button allows the element to dissolve into visibility. This  animation looks much like a fade effect used in video. As in the sliding  animations, you can control the speed of the animation.  A special function is called when the fade in is complete. In this example,  I call a function named present as soon as the fade in is complete. This  is a callback function, which I explain in just a bit.   ✓ The Fade Out button fades the element to the background color. This  technique gradually modifies the opacity of the element so it gradually  disappears.  Here are a couple of details for you to keep in mind:  ✓ You can adjust how quickly the transition animation plays. For example,   the hideShow program plays the slide down at a slow speed, and slide  up faster. You can even specify exactly how long the transition takes in  milliseconds  1 1000ths of a second .  ✓ Any transition can have a callback function attached. A callback func- tion is a function that will be triggered when the transition is complete.    Of course, the showHide example relies on animation, which isn’t easy to see  in a static book. Please be sure to look at this and all other example pages on  my Web site: www.aharrisbooks.net. Better yet, install them on your own  machine and play around with my code until they make sense to you.    Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  267  Figure 11-2:  The content  element is  now visible.       The animations shown in this example are useful when you want to selectively  hide and display parts of your page. Being able to show and hide elements is  useful in a number of situations. Menus are one obvious use. You might choose  to store your menu structure as a series of nested lists, displaying parts of the  menu only when the parent is activated. Another common use of this technology  is to have small teaser sentences that expand to show more information when  the user clicks or hovers the mouse pointer over them. This technique is com- monly used on blog and news sites to let users preview a large number of topics,  kind of like a text-based thumbnail image.  The jQuery library has built-in support for transitions that make these effects  pretty easy to produce. Look over the entire hideShow.html program  before digging in on the details.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=»EN» dir=»ltr» xmlns=»http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml»>      <meta http-equiv=”content-type” content=”text xml;   charset=utf-8”  >       content {   268 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX       width: 300px;     height: 200px;     font-size: 200%;     background-color: yellow;     position: absolute;     left: 300px;     top: 100px;   }   h2 {     width: 10em;     border: 5px double black;     background-color: lightgray;     text-align: center;     font-family: sans-serif   }          <script type = “text javascript”           src = “jquery-1.3.2.min.js”>                       <![CDATA[     $ init ;          function init  {       $ “content” .hide  ;       $ “show” .click showContent ;       $ “hide” .click hideContent ;       $ “toggle” .click toggleContent ;       $ “slideDown” .click slideDown ;       $ “slideUp” .click slideUp ;       $ “fadeIn” .click fadeIn ;       $ “fadeOut” .click fadeOut ;     }    end init              function showContent  {       $ “content” .show  ;     }    end showContent          function hideContent  {       $ “content” .hide  ;     }    end hideContent          function toggleContent  {       $ “content” .toggle  ;     }    end toggleContent          function slideDown  {       $ “content” .slideDown “medium” ;     }    end slideDown         Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  269      function slideUp  {       $ “content” .slideUp 500 ;     }    end slideUp          function fadeIn  {       $ “content” .fadeIn “slow”, present ;     }    end fadeIn          function fadeOut  {       $ “content” .fadeOut “fast” ;     }    end fadeOut.          function present  {       alert “I’m here” ;     }    end present       ]]>        hideShow.html         Hide and show     Show     Hide     Toggle     Slide Down     Slide Up     Fade In     Fade Out             This is the content. It is hidden at first, but it is   hidden and      shown with jQuery techniques.             This example might look long and complicated when you view it all at once,  but it isn’t hard to understand when you break it into pieces. The following  sections help you get comfortable with this example.  Writing the HTML and CSS foundation  The HTML used in this example is minimal, as is common in jQuery develop- ment. It consists of a single level-one heading, a series of level-two headings,  and a paragraph. The level-two headings will be used as buttons in this  example. I use a CSS style to make the   tags look more like buttons   adding a border and background color . I added an id attribute to every  button so I can add jQuery events later.    270 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                If I wanted the h2 elements to look and act like buttons, why didn’t I just make  them with button tags in the first place? That’s a very good question. At one  level, I probably should use the semantically clear button tag to make a  button. However, in this example, I want to focus on the jQuery and keep the  HTML as simple as possible. jQuery can help you make any element act like a  button, so that’s what I did. Users don’t expect h2 elements to be clickable, so  you need to do some styling  as I did  to help the users understand that they  can click the element. For comparison purposes, the other two examples in  this chapter use actual HTML buttons.    The other interesting part of the HTML is the content div. In this example,  the actual content isn’t really important, but I did add some CSS to make  the content very easy to see when it pops up. The most critical part of the  HTML from a programming perspective is the inclusion of the id attribute.  This attribute makes it easy for a jQuery script to manipulate the component  so that it hides and reappears in various ways. Note that the HTML and CSS  does nothing to hide the content. It will be hidden  and revealed  entirely  through jQuery code.  Initializing the page  The initialization sequence simply sets the stage and assigns a series of event  handlers:      $ init ;          function init  {       $ “content” .hide  ;       $ “show” .click showContent ;       $ “hide” .click hideContent ;       $ “toggle” .click toggleContent ;       $ “slideDown” .click slideDown ;       $ “slideUp” .click slideUp ;       $ “fadeIn” .click fadeIn ;       $ “fadeOut” .click fadeOut ;     }    end init  The pattern for working with jQuery should now be familiar:  1.  Set up an initialization function.     Use the $ document .ready   mechanism described in Chapter 12 or  this cleaner shortcut to specify an initialization function.  2.  Hide the content div.     When the user first encounters the page, the content div should be  hidden.     Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  271                 3.  Attach event handlers to each h2 button.     This program is a series of small functions. The init   function attaches  each function to the corresponding button. Note how I carefully named  the functions and buttons to make all the connections easy to understand.  Working with callback functions  As you look through the JavaScript and jQuery code in hideShow.html, you’ll  probably spot a pattern. The init   function adds event handlers to several  of the elements on the page. These event handlers specify the names of  various functions. The rest of the JavaScript code is simply the definitions  of these functions.  This technique is heavily used in jQuery programming. When you define an  event, you will often specify a function that should be called when that event  is triggered. Such a function is often referred to as a callback function.  In this context, the function name is treated as a variable, so it doesn’t need  the parentheses you normally use when referring to functions.  Hiding and Showing the Content  All the effects on the page shown earlier in Figure 11-1 are based on hiding  and showing the content div. The hide   and show   methods illustrate  how jQuery animation works.      function showContent  {       $ “content” .show  ;     }    end showContent          function hideContent  {       $ “content” .hide  ;     }    end hideContent  Each of these functions works in the same basic manner:  1.  Identify the content div.    Create a jQuery node based on the content div. If you need more infor- mation on creating jQuery node objects, please check Chapter 10.  2.  Hide or show the node.    The jQuery object has built-in methods for hiding and showing.   272 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   The hide   and show   methods act instantly. If the element is currently  visible, the show   method has no effect. Likewise, hide   has no effect on  an element that’s already hidden.  The following sections describe some fun tricks for revealing or concealing  elements.  Toggling visibility  In addition to hide   and show  , the jQuery object supports a toggle    method. This method takes a look at the current status of the element and  changes it. If the element is currently hidden, clicking the button makes it  visible. If it’s currently visible, clicking the button hides it. The toggle Content   function illustrates how to use this method:      function toggleContent  {       $ “content” .toggle  ;     }    end toggleContent  Sliding an element  jQuery supports a window blind effect that allows you to animate the appear- ance and disappearance of your element. The general approach is very similar  to hide   and show  , but the effect has one additional twist:      function slideDown  {       $ “content” .slideDown “medium” ;     }    end slideDown          function slideUp  {       $ “content” .slideUp 500 ;     }    end slideUp  The slideDown   method makes an element appear like a window shade  being pulled down. The slideUp   method makes an element disappear  in a similar manner. These functions take a speed parameter that indicates  how quickly the animation occurs. The speed can be a string value  “fast”,  “medium”, or “slow”  or a numeric value in milliseconds  measured in  1,000th of a second . The value 500 means 500 milliseconds, or half a second.  If you leave out the speed parameter, the default value is “medium”.  The show  , hide  , and toggle   methods also accept a speed parameter.  In these functions, the object shrinks and grows at the indicated speed.      There is also a slideToggle   function available that toggles the visibility  of the element, but using the sliding animation technique.    Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  273  Fading an element in and out  Another type of animation is provided by the fade methods. These techniques  adjust the opacity of the element. The code should look quite familiar by now:      function fadeIn  {       $ “content” .fadeIn “slow”, present ;     }    end fadeIn          function fadeOut  {       $ “content” .fadeOut “fast” ;     }    end fadeOut.      function present  {       alert “I’m here” ;     }    end present  fadeIn   and fadeout   work just like the hide   and slide   tech- niques. The fading techniques adjust the opacity of the element and then  remove it, rather than dynamically changing the size of the element as the  slide and show techniques do.  I’ve added one more element to the fadeIn   function. If you supply the  fadeIn   method  or indeed any of the animation methods described in this  section  with a function name as a second parameter, that function is a call- back function, meaning it is called upon completion of the animation. When  you click the fade in button, the content div slowly fades in, and then when  it is completely visible, the present   function gets called. This function  doesn’t do a lot in this example — it simply pops up an alert — but it could  be used to handle some sort of instructions after the element is visible.   If the element is already visible, the callback method will be triggered  immediately.  Changing an Element’s  Position with jQuery  The jQuery library also has interesting features for changing any of an element’s  characteristics, including its position. The animate.html page featured in  Figure 11-3 illustrates a number of interesting animation techniques.    You know what I’m going to say, right? This program moves things around. You   can’t see that in a book. Be sure to look at the actual page. Trust me; it’s a lot  more fun than it looks in this screen shot.   274 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 11-3:  Click the  buttons, and  the element  moves.  I  added the  arrow to  indicate  motion.        This page  animate.html  illustrates how to move a jQuery element by  modifying its CSS.  Check Bonus Chapter 2 on the Web site if you’re unfamil- iar with CSS.  It also illustrates an important jQuery technique called object  chaining as well as a very useful animation method that allows you to create  smooth motion over time. Look over the entire code first, and then in the fol- lowing sections I break it into sections for more careful review:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >        content {     width: 300px;     height: 200px;     font-size: 200%;     background-color: yellow;     position: absolute;     left: 300px;     top: 100px;     padding-left: .5em;   }    Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  275           <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                       <![CDATA[     $ init ;          function init  {       $ «move» .click move ;       $ «glide» .click glide ;       $ «left» .click left ;       $ «right» .click right ;     }    end init      function move  {       $ «content» .css «left», «50px»        .css «top», «100px» ;     }    end move                function glide  {         move to initial spot       $ «content» .css «left», «50px»        .css «top», «100px» ;                slide to new spot       $ «content» .animate {         «left»: «400px»,         «top»: «200px»       }, 2000 ;     }    end glide            function left  {       $ «content» .animate {«left»: «-=10px»}, 100 ;     }    end left          function right  {       $ «content» .animate {«left»: «+=10px»}, 100 ;     }    end left       ]]>           Animate.html       Animation Demo            <button type = «button»             id = «move»>       move   276 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX             <button type = «button»             id = «glide»>       glide                <button type = «button»             id = «left»>        &lt;--                   <button type = «button»              id = «right»>        -->                        This content will move in response to the controls.        Creating the HTML framework  The HTML always forms the foundation of a JavaScript program. The animate. html page is similar to the hideShow page  shown earlier in the chapter ,  but I decided to use a real form with buttons as the control panel. Buttons  aren’t difficult to use, but they’re a little more tedious to code because they  must be inside a form element as well as a block-level element, and they  require more coding to produce than h2 elements.  Note that I use &lt; in one of the button captions.  You can find it near the  end of the animate.html listing.  This HTML attribute displays the less-than  symbol. Had I used the actual symbol  <  the browser would have thought I  was beginning a new HTML tag and would have been confused.  The buttons all have id attributes, but I didn’t attach functions to them with  the onclick attribute. When you’re using jQuery, it makes sense to commit  to a jQuery approach and use the jQuery event techniques.   The only other important HTML element is the content div. Once again, this  element is simply a placeholder, but I added CSS styling to make it obvious  when it moves around. It’s important that you set this element to be absolutely  positioned, because the position will be changed dynamically in the code.     Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  277  Setting up the events  The initialization is all about setting up the event handlers for the various but- tons. Begin with an init   function called when the document is ready. That  function contains callback functions  such as move and glide  for the various  events, directing traffic to the right functions when a user presses a button:      function init  {       $ “move” .click move ;       $ “glide” .click glide ;       $ “left” .click left ;       $ “right” .click right ;     }    end init  As usual, naming conventions make it easy to see what’s going on.   Don’t go chaining . . .  jQuery supports a really neat feature called node chaining that allows you to  put several steps into one single line. This makes your code a lot easier to  write, and it allows you to do several things to a particular element or group  of elements at once. As an example, take another look at the move   function  defined in animate.html.   The move function isn’t really that radical. All it really does is use the css    method described in Chapter 10 to alter the position of the element. After  all, position is just a CSS attribute, right? Well, it’s a little more complex than  that. The position of an element is actually stored in two attributes, top and  left. Your first attempt at a move function would probably look like this:      function move  {       $ “content” .css “left”, “50px” ;       $ “content” .css “top”, “100px” ;     }    end move        Although this approach certainly works, it has a subtle problem. It moves the  element in two separate steps. Although most browsers are fast enough to  prevent this from being an issue, node chaining allows you to combine many  jQuery steps into a single line.  Almost all jQuery methods return a jQuery object as a side effect. So, the line        $ “content” .text “changed” ;  not only changes the text of the content node, but actually makes a new  node. You can attach that node to a variable like this if you want:   278 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX         var newNode = $ “content” .text “changed” ;  However, what most jQuery programmers do is simply attach new functionality  onto the end of the previously defined node, like this:        $ “content” .text “changed” .click hiThere ;  This new line takes the node created by $ “content”  and changes its  text value. It then takes this new node  the one with changed text  and adds  a click event to it, calling the hiThere   function when the content ele- ment is clicked. In this way, you build an ever-more complex node by chain- ing nodes on top of each other.    These node chains can be hard to read because they can result in a lot of code   on one physical line. JavaScript doesn’t really care about carriage returns,  though, because it uses the semicolon to determine the end of a logical line.  You can change the complex chained line so it fits on several lines of the text  editor like this:        $ “content”        .text “changed”        .click hiThere ;  Note that only the last line has a semicolon because what’s shown is all one  line of logic even though it occurs on three lines in the editor.  Building the move   function  with chaining  Object chaining makes it easy to build the move function so that it moves the  content’s left and top properties simultaneously:      function move  {       $ “content” .css “left”, “50px”        .css “top”, “100px” ;     }    end move        This function uses the css   method to change the left property to 50px.  The resulting object is given a second css   method call to change the top  property to 100px. The top and left elements are changed at the same  time as far as the user is concerned.     Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  279  Building time-based animation  with animate    Using the css   method is a great way to move an element around on the  screen, but the motion is instantaneous. jQuery supports a powerful method  called animate  , which allows you to change any DOM characteristics over  a specified span of time. The glide button on animate.html smoothly  moves the content div from  50, 100  to  400, 200  over two seconds.      function glide  {         move to initial spot       $ “content” .css “left”, “50px”        .css “top”, “100px” ;                slide to new spot       $ “content” .animate {         “left”: “400px”,         “top”: “200px”       }, 2000 ;     }    end glide           The function begins by moving the element immediately to its initial spot  with chained css   methods. It then uses the animate   method to control  the animation. This method can have up to three parameters:  ✓ A JSON object describing attributes to animate: The first parameter  is an object in JSON notation describing name value attribute pairs. In  this example, I’m telling jQuery to change the left attribute from its  current value to 400px and the top value to 200px. Any numeric value  that you can change through the DOM can be included in this JSON  object. Instead of a numerical value, you can use “hide”, “show”, or  “toggle” to specify an action. Review Chapter 5 for more on JSON  objects if you’re unfamiliar with them.  ✓ A speed attribute: The speed parameter is defined in the same way as   the speed for fade and slide animations. There are three predefined  speeds: “slow”, “medium”, and “fast”; speed can also be indicated in  milliseconds  so 2000 means 2 seconds .  ✓ A callback function: This optional parameter describes a function to   be called when the animation is complete. I describe the use of callback  functions earlier in this chapter in the section called “Fading an element  in and out.”   280 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Move a little bit: Relative motion  You can use the animation mechanism to move an object relative to its current  position. The arrow buttons and their associated functions perform this task:      function left  {       $ “content” .animate {“left”: “-=10px”}, 100 ;     }    end left          function right  {       $ “content” .animate {“left”: “+=10px”}, 100 ;     }    end left  These functions also use the animate   method, but there’s a small differ- ence in the position parameters. The += and -= modifiers indicate that I want  to add to or subtract from the value rather than indicating an absolute posi- tion. Of course, you can add as many parameters to the JSON object as you  want, but these are a good start.  Note that since I’m moving a small amount  ten pixels  I want the motion to  be relatively quick. Each motion lasts 100 milliseconds.    The jQuery animation   method supports one more option: easing. The term   easing refers to the relative speed of the animation throughout its lifespan. If  you watch the animations on the animate.html page carefully, you’ll see that  the motion begins slowly, builds up speed, and slows down again at the end.  This provides a natural-feeling animation. By default, jQuery animations use  what’s called a swing easing style  slow on the ends, fast in the middle, like a  child on a swing . If you want to have a more consistent speed, you can specify  “linear” as the fourth parameter, and the animation will work at a constant  speed. You can also install plugins for more advanced easing techniques.  Modifying Elements on the Fly  The jQuery library supports a third major way of modifying the page: the abil- ity to add and remove contents dynamically. This is a powerful way to work  with a page. The key to this feature is another of jQuery’s most capable tools:  its flexible selection engine. You’ve already seen how you can select jQuery  nodes using the standard CSS-style selectors, but you can also use numerous  attributes to modify nodes. The changeContent.html page demonstrates  some of the power of these tools  see Figure 11-4 .  Of course, the buttons allow the user to make changes to the page dynamically.  Pressing the Add Text button adds more text to the content area, as you can  see in Figure 11-5.    Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  281  Click here to add more text to the Content area.  Figure 11-4:  The default  state of  change- Content is a  little dull.    Figure 11-5:  More text  can be  appended  inside any  content  area.           282 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   The Clone button is interesting because it allows you to make a copy of an  element and place it somewhere else in the document hierarchy. Pressing the  Clone button a few times can give you a page like Figure 11-6.  It’s possible to wrap an HTML element around any existing element. The Wrap  in Div button puts a div  with a red border  around every cloned element.  You can press this multiple times to add multiple wrappings to any element.  Figure 11-7 shows what happens after I wrap a few times.  For readability, sometimes you want to be able to alternate styles of lists and  tables. jQuery offers an easy way to select every other element in a group and  give it a style. The Change Alternate Paragraphs button activates some code  that turns all odd-numbered paragraphs into white text with a green back- ground. Look at Figure 11-8 for a demonstration.  Finally, the Reset button demonstrates how you can reset all the changes you  made with the other buttons.  Click the Clone button to copy content.  Figure 11-6:  I’ve made  several  clones of  the original  content.         Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  283  Click to add a div.  A div is added to each clone.  I clicked the button three times in this example.      Click this button to alternate styles.  Figure 11-7:  Now there’s  a red- bordered  div around  all the  cloned  elements.  Figure 11-8:  All odd- numbered  paragraphs  have a new  style.           284 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   The code for changeContent.html seems complex, but it follows the same  general patterns in jQuery programming that I show you earlier in this chapter.  As always, look over the entire code first, and then I break it down.  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >        content {     width: 300px;     background-color: yellow;     left: 300px;     top: 100px;     padding-left: .5em;      border: 0px none black;   }      div {     border: 2px solid red;     padding: 3px;   }          <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                       <![CDATA[     $ init ;          function init  {       $ «reset» .click reset ;       $ «addText» .click addText ;       $ «wrap» .click wrap ;       $ «clone» .click clone ;       $ «oddGreen» .click oddGreen ;     }    end init          function reset  {              remove all but the original content       $ «p:gt 0 » .remove  ;       $ «div:not content » .remove  ;         reset the text of the original content    Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  285        $ «content» .html « This is the original   content » ;      }    end reset          function addText  {       $ «p:first» .append « ...and this was added   later.» ;      }    end addContent          function wrap  {       $ «p:gt 0 » .wrap «  » ;     }    end wrap          function clone  {      $ «p:first» .clone        .insertAfter «p:last»       .css «backgroundColor», «lightblue» ;     }    end clone      function oddGreen  {         turn alternate  odd numbered  paragraph elements   green        $ «p:odd» .css «backgroundColor», «green»        .css «color», «white» ;     }    end oddGreen       ]]>        changeContent.html         Adding Content Demo                  <button type = «button»               id = «reset»>         reset                      <button type = «button»               id = «addText»>         add text                      <button type = «button»               id = «clone»>         clone                  286 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX         <button type = «button»               id = «wrap»>         wrap in div                      <button type = «button»               id = «oddGreen»>         change alternate paragraphs                                            This is the original content                I admit, this program has a lot of code, but when you consider how much  functionality this page has, it really isn’t too bad. Look at it in smaller pieces,  and it all make sense.   Building the basic page  As usual, begin by inspecting the HTML. The basic code for this page sets up  the playground.  1.  Create a form with buttons.     This form becomes the control panel. Add a button for each function  you want to add. Make sure each button has an ID, but you don’t need  to specify an onclick function, because the init   function will take  care of that.  2.  Build a prototype content div.    Build a div called content, and add a paragraph to the div.     It’s very important to be careful with your initial HTML structure. The manipu- lation and selection tricks that you experiment with in this chapter rely on a  thorough understanding of the beginning page structure. Be sure you under- stand exactly how the page is set up so that you’ll understand how to manipu- late it. If your standard XHTML page  before any JavaScript jQuery code is  added  doesn’t validate, it’s unlikely your code will work as expected.              Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  287  Initializing the code  The initialization section is pretty straightforward. Set up an init   function  and use it to assign event handlers to all the buttons:      $ init ;          function init  {       $ “reset” .click reset ;       $ “addText” .click addText ;       $ “wrap” .click wrap ;       $ “clone” .click clone ;       $ “oddGreen” .click oddGreen ;     }    end init  Adding text  Adding text to a component is pretty easy. The append   method attaches  text to the end of a jQuery node. Table 11-1 shows a number of other  methods for adding text to a node.  Table 11-1  Method append text   prepend text   insertAfter text   insertBefore text   Adding Content to jQuery Nodes  Description Adds the text  or HTML  to the end of the  selected element s . Adds the content at the beginning of the  selected element s . Adds the text after the selected element   outside the element . Adds the text before the selected element   outside the element .    More methods are available, but these are the ones I find most useful. Be sure  to check out the official documentation at http:  docs.jquery.com to see  the other options.      function addText  {       $ “p:first” .append “ ...and this was added   later.” ;      }    end addContent   288 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   The append   method adds the new text to the end of the text already inside  the element, so it becomes part of the paragraph contained inside the content  div. For example, if you have this element:  one  and you  append two to the div, you’ll get  onetwo , not  one<  div>two.   The more interesting part of this code is the selector. It could read like this:  $ “p” .append “ ...and this was added later.” ;  That would add the text to the end of the paragraph. The default text has  only one paragraph, so that makes lots of sense. If there are more paragraphs   and there will be , the p selector will select them all, adding the text to all  the paragraphs simultaneously. By specifying p:first, I’m using a special  filter to determine exactly which paragraph should be affected. Many of the  examples on this page use jQuery filters, so I describe them elsewhere in this  section. For now, note that p:first means the first paragraph. Of course,  there are also p:last and many more. Read on. . . .  Attack of the clones  You can clone  copy  anything you can identify as a jQuery node. This cloning  makes a copy of the node without changing the original. The cloned node isn’t  immediately visible on the screen. You need to place it somewhere, usually with  an append  , prepend  , insertBefore  , or insertAfter   method.  Take a look at the clone   function to see how it works:      function clone  {      $ “p:first” .clone        .insertAfter “p:last”       .css “backgroundColor”, “lightblue” ;     }    end clone                 1.  Select the first paragraph.    The first paragraph is the one I want to copy.  In the beginning, there’s  only one, but that will change soon.   2.  Use the clone   method to make a copy.    Even though this step makes a copy, it still isn’t visible. Use chaining to  do some interesting things to this copy.  I explain chaining earlier in the  chapter, in the section “Don’t go chaining . . .”   3.  Add the new element to the page after the last paragraph.    The p:last identifier is the last paragraph, so insertAfter  “p:last”  means put the new paragraph after the last paragraph  available in the document.    Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  289       4.  Change the CSS.    Just for grins, chain the css   method onto the new element and change  the background color to light blue. This just reinforces that you can  continue adding commands to a node through chaining.   Note that the paragraphs are still inside the content div. Of course, I  could have put them elsewhere with careful use of selectors, but that’s  where I want them.       Keeping track of changes to the page is difficult because a standard View  Source command shows you the original source code, not the code that’s  been changed by your jQuery magic. jQuery changes the HTML of your page in  memory, but doesn’t change the text file that contains your page. If your page  isn’t doing what you expect, you need to look at the script-generated source  code to see what’s really going on. Firefox plugins are the key to headache-free  debugging. The Web developer toolbar has a wonderful feature called View  Generated Source  available under the View Source menu , which shows the  page source as it currently exists in memory. If you prefer the Firebug exten- sion, its inspect mode also inspects the page as it currently is displayed. Both  tools are described in Chapter 1.  Note that the content of the first paragraph is cloned with its current content  and style information copied to the new element. If you clone the paragraph  and then add content to it and clone it again, the first clone has the default  text, and the second clone contains the additional text. If you modify the CSS  of an element and then clone it, the clone also inherits any of the style char- acteristics of the original node.  It’s a wrap  Sometimes you want to embed an object inside another element  or two .  For example, the wrap button on the changeContent page surrounds each  cloned paragraph with a    pair. I’ve defined the  tag in my  CSS to include a red border. Repeatedly clicking the Wrap button surrounds  all cloned paragraphs with red borders. This would be a very tedious effect to  achieve in ordinary DOM and JavaScript, but jQuery makes it pretty easy to do.      function wrap  {       $ “p:gt 0 ” .wrap “  ” ;     }    end wrap  The wrap method is pretty easy to understand. If you feed it any container  tag, it wraps that container around the selected node. You can also use mul- tiple elements, so if you want to enclose a paragraph into a single item list,  you can do something like this:        $ “p” .wrap “    ” ;   290 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   The resulting code would surround each paragraph with an unordered list  and list item.  Returning to the wrap function, I’ve decided not to wrap every paragraph  with a div, just the ones that have been cloned.  Mainly I’m doing this so  I can show you some other cool selection filters.  The selector p:gt 0   means “select all paragraphs with an index greater than zero.” In other  words, ignore the first paragraph but apply the following methods to all other  paragraphs. There is also a less-than filter  :lt , which isolates elements  before a certain index, and an equals filter  :eq , which isolates an element  with a certain index.   Alternating styles  People commonly alternate background colors on long lists or tables of data,  but this can be a tedious effect to achieve in ordinary CSS and JavaScript. Not  surprisingly, jQuery selectors make this a pretty easy job:      function oddGreen  {         turn alternate  odd numbered  paragraph elements   green        $ “p:odd” .css “backgroundColor”, “green”        .css “color”, “white” ;     }    end oddGreen  The :odd selector only chooses elements with an odd index and returns a  jQuery node that can be further manipulated with chaining. Of course, you  can use an :even selector for handling the even-numbered nodes. The rest of  this code is simply CSS styling.  Resetting the page  If you can do all this modification to the page, you’ll also need to be able to  restore it to its pristine state. A quick jQuery function can easily do the trick:      function reset  {              remove all but the original content       $ “p:gt 0 ” .remove  ;       $ “div:not content ” .remove  ;         reset the text of the original content       $ “content” .html “ This is the original   content ” ;      }    end reset  This function reviews many of the jQuery and selection tricks shown in this  chapter.    Chapter 11: Animating jQuery  291                 1.  Remove all but the first paragraph.    Any paragraphs with an index greater than zero is a clone, so it needs to  go away. The remove   method removes all jQuery nodes associated  with the current selector.  2.  Remove all divs but the original content.     I could have used the :gt selector again, but instead I use another inter- esting selector: :not. This selector means “remove every div that isn’t  the primary content div.” Using this selector removes all divs added  through the wrap function.  3.  Reset the original content div to its default text.    Set the default text back to its original status so the page is reset.    Truthfully, all I really need here is the last line of code. Changing the HTML of   the content div replaces the current contents with whatever is included,  so the first two lines aren’t entirely necessary in this particular context. Still,  it’s very useful to know how to remove elements when you need to do so.  More fun with selectors and filters  The jQuery selectors and filters are really fun and powerful. Table 11-2  describes a few more filters and how you can use them.  Table 11-2  Filter :header  :animated  :empty  :parent  :contains text   :attribute=value  :Input, :text,  :radio, :image,  :button, and so on   Common jQuery Filters  Description Any header tag  h1, h2, h3 . Any element that is currently being animated. Any element that contains the indicated text. The element is empty. This element contains some other element. The element has an attribute with the specified  value. Matches on the specific element type  especially  useful for form elements that are all variations of the  input tag .  Note that this is a representative list. Be sure to check out the official docu- mentation at http:  docs.jquery.com for a more complete list of filters.   292 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX    Chapter 12  Using the jQuery User   Interface Toolkit  In This Chapter ▶ Exploring the jQuery user interface ▶ Installing the UI and templates ▶ Adding date pickers, dialog boxes, and icons ▶ Dragging and dropping ▶ Working with scrollbars ▶ Building a sorting mechanism ▶ Creating an accordion page ▶ Building a tab-based interface  The jQuery library is an incredible tool for simplifying JavaScript program-  ming. The library is so popular and powerful that developers began adding  new features to make it even more useful. Among the most important of these  is the jQuery UI  user interface  framework. This tool adds these welcome  features to Web development:  ✓ New user interface elements: As a modern user interface tool, HTML is   missing some important tools. Most modern visual languages include  built-in support for devices such as scrollbars, dedicated date pickers,  and multiple tab tools. jQuery UI adds these features and more.  ✓ Advanced user interaction: The jQuery widgets give users new and  exciting ways to interact with your page. Using the UI toolkit, you can  easily let users make selections by dragging and dropping elements and  expanding and contracting parts of the page.  ✓ Flexible theme templates: jQuery UI includes a template mechanism   that controls the visual look and feel of your elements. You can choose  from dozens of prebuilt themes or use a tool to build your own particular  look. You can reuse this template library to manage the look of your  other page elements, too  not just the ones defined by the library .            294 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                              ✓ A complete icon library: The jQuery UI has a library of icons for use in  your Web development. It has arrows and buttons and plenty of other  doodads that you can change to fit your template.  ✓ A clean, modern look: You can easily build forward-looking visual designs  with jQuery UI. It supports rounded corners and plenty of special visual  effects.  ✓ The power of jQuery: As an extension of jQuery, the jQuery UI adds to   the incredible features of the jQuery language.  ✓ Open source values: The jQuery UI  like jQuery itself  is an open-source  project with quite an active community. You can modify its free library  to suit your needs.  Looking Over the ThemeRoller  The jQuery UI Web site  http:  jqueryui.com  is a helpful place to find the  latest information about jQuery, and it also features the marvelous Theme Roller tool. Figure 12-1 shows the main Web page, which demonstrates many  of the excellent jQuery features.  Before you use ThemeRoller to change themes, use it to become acquainted  with the UI elements. Several useful tools are visible in the figure:  ✓ Accordion: The upper-left segment of the page has three segments    Section 1, Section 2, and Section 3 . By clicking a section heading, the  user can expand that section and collapse others.  ✓ Slider: Sliders  or scrollbars  are an essential user interface element  that lets a user choose a numeric value by using an easy visual tool.  You can adjust jQuery sliders in many ways to allow easy and error-free  input.  ✓ Date picker: Ensuring that users enter dates properly is difficult. The   phenomenally useful date picker control automatically pops a calendar  onto the page and lets the user manipulate the calendar to pick a date.  ✓ Progress bar: Always design your code so that little delay occurs, but if  a part of your program takes some time to complete, a progress bar is a  useful reminder that something is happening.  ✓ Tabs: The accordion technique is one way to hide and show parts of  your page, and tabs are another popular technique. You can use this  mechanism to build a powerful multi-tab document without having to do  much work.    Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  295  Tabs allow you to organize a large amount of content.  The slider is a scroll bar.  The datepicker is an automatic calendar.  Figure 12-1:  ThemeRoller  lets you look  over many  jQuery UI  elements  and modify  their look.                 The progress bar allows you to view an event’s progress.  This section is an accordion.  Scrolling down the page, you see even more interesting tools. Figure 12-2  shows some of these widgets in action.  These widgets demonstrate even more of the power of the jQuery UI library:  ✓ Dialog: Pressing the Open Dialog button pops up what appears to be  a dialog box. It acts much like the JavaScript alert, but it’s much nicer  looking and has features that make it much more advanced.  ✓ Formatting tools: The jQuery UI includes special tools for setting apart   certain parts of your page as warnings, as highlighted text, or with  added shadows and transparency.  ✓ Icons: jQuery UI ships with a large collection of icons you can use in your  page. Hover the mouse over each icon on the ThemeRoller to see a descrip- tion. You can easily use these icons to allow various user interactions.   296 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Pop-up dialog  Figure 12-2:  Even more  exciting  widgets.        Custom icons  Elements with shadows and highlights.  Visiting the Theme Park  Impressive as all the jQuery UI widgets are, they’re just a part of the story.  jQuery supports the concept of themes, which are simply visual rule sets. A  theme is essentially a complex CSS document  and some associated graphics files  designed to be used with the UI library. Go back to the top of the Theme Roller page and look at the left column. If you click the Gallery tab  yes, it’s  using a jQuery UI tab interface , you can see a list of prebuilt themes. Figure 12-3  shows the ThemeRoller page with an entirely different theme in place.  The built-in themes are impressive, but of course you can make your own.  Though you’re always free to edit the CSS manually, the whole point of the  ThemeRoller application is to make this process easier.    Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  297  Figure 12-3:  Now,  ThemeRoller  is using  the Le Frog  theme.       If you go back to the Roll Your Own tab, you see an accordion selection that  you can use to pick various theme options. You can change fonts, choose  rounded corners, select various color schemes, and much more. You can  mess around with these options all you want and create your own visual  style. You can then save that theme and use it in your own projects.  Wanna Drag? Dragging and  Dropping Elements  It’s time to build something. The first example I show you is a simple applica- tion that lets someone use the mouse to pick up a page element and move  it. Although I tell you how to use JavaScript and the document object model   DOM  to do this in Chapter 8, you’ll find that you can quite easily create the  same effect by using jQuery UI. Figure 12-4 shows this page in action.   298 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 12-4:  The user  can simply  drag the box  anywhere  on the page.       This example is a good starting place for using the jQuery UI library because  it’s easy to get the project working. Often, the hardest part of writing jQuery  UI applications is making the connections to the library. After you do that   and it’s not that hard , the rest of the programming is ridiculously easy. Take  a look at the following chunk of code to see what I’m talking about:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >       dragMe {     width: 100px;     height: 100px;     border: 1px solid blue;     text-align: center;   }       <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»    Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  299            src = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js»>          $ init ;     function init  {       $ «dragMe» .draggable  ;     }        drag.html          Drag Demo          Drag me          The basic idea of this program is completely consistent with the jQuery  concepts I describe in Chapter 13. The page uses simple HTML code. An ini- tialization function creates a special jQuery node and gives it functionality.  That’s all there is to it.  Here are the basic steps:  1.  Create a basic HTML document.    You can use a standard document. I created one div with the ID  dragMe, which is the div I want to make draggable.  You can, of course,  apply dragging functionality to any element you can select with jQuery.   2.  Add the standard jQuery library.     The first   tag imports the standard jQuery library. The UI  library requires jQuery to be loaded first.            A ThemeRoller example  ThemeRoller gives you a good overview of the  jQuery  UI  library  and  also  serves  as  a  great  example  of  where  the  Web  is  going.  It’s  not  really a Web page as much as it’s an applica- tion that happens to be written in Web tech- nologies. Notice that the functionality of the  page  changing styles dynamically  uses many  jQuery and jQuery UI tricks: tabs, accordions,   and dialog boxes, for example. This kind of pro- gramming, which is almost certainly the direc- tion  in  which  Web  development  is  heading,  might indeed be the primary form of application  in the future. Certainly, it appears that appli- cations using this style of user interface, and  AJAX, for data communication and storage will  be important for quite some time.   300 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                       3.  Add a link to the jQuery UI library.    A second   tag imports the jQuery UI library.  See the section  called “Downloading the Library” for details on how to obtain this library.   4.  Create an initialization function.    Use the standard jQuery techniques to build an initialization function for  your page.  As usual, I named mine init  .   5.  Build a draggable node.    Use standard jQuery selection techniques to isolate the elements you  want to make draggable. Use the draggable   method to make the  element draggable.  6.  Test.    Believe it or not, that’s all there is to it. As long as everything is set  up properly, your element can be dragged! A user can drag it with the  mouse and place it anywhere on the screen.  Downloading the Library  Writing jQuery UI code isn’t difficult, but getting access to the parts of the  library you need can be a bit confusing. The jQuery UI library is much larger  than the standard jQuery package, so you might not want to include the  entire package if you don’t need it. Previous versions of jQuery UI let you  download the entire package but stored each of the various elements in a  separate JavaScript file. You would commonly have a half-dozen different  script tags active just to put the various elements in place. Worse, there  were some dependency issues, so you had to ensure that certain packages  were installed before you could use other packages — all of which made a  simple library quite complex to use.  Fortunately, the latest versions of the jQuery UI make this process quite a  bit simpler. Whenever you begin to work on a project, you pick  or create   a visual theme, choose the widgets and tools you want, and download  a custom form of the library that’s tailored to your exact needs. Using  this mechanism, you have much simpler code because you link only one  JavaScript library for the UI no matter how many interface tools and gadgets  you use  though you still need to link the standard jQuery library first .    Use this technique also to build in multiple themes so that you can easily   switch the look of your program by changing the theme files.    Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  301  Resizing on a Theme  This section demonstrates two important ideas in the jQuery UI package:  ✓ Resizable elements: The user can drag an element’s bottom or right   border to change its size. Making an element resizable is similar to  making it draggable.  ✓ Themes: jQuery features a series of customized visual styles.   You can see in Figure 12-5 that the page has a definite visual style. The ele- ments have distinctive fonts and backgrounds, and the headers are in a  particular visual style. Though these styles aren’t earth-shattering  after all,  it’s just CSS , the exciting news is that they’re defined by the theme. You can  easily select another theme  created by hand or by using ThemeRoller , and  the visual look of all these elements will reflect the new theme. Themes pro- vide a further level of abstraction to your Web site that makes changing the  overall visual style much easier than modifying the CSS by hand.   The widget can be resized by dragging the edges or corner.           Figure 12-5:  A user can  change the  size of this  lovely  element.     An ordinary div styled to use the same widget format.   302 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 12-6 shows the page after the Resize Me element has changed sizes,  and you can see that the rest of the page reformats itself to fit the newly  resized element.  Figure 12-6:  When the  element is  resized, the  remainder  of the page  adjusts.       The following chunk of code reveals that most of the interesting visual effects  in Figure 12-6 are simple CSS coding, and the resizing is just more jQuery UI  magic:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»         href = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css»  >        h1 {     text-align: center;   }    Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  303    resizeMe {     width: 300px;     height: 300px;     text-align: center;   }   sample {     width: 200px;     height: 200px;     margin: 1em;   }        <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js»>            <![CDATA[     $ init ;     function init  {       $ «resizeMe» .resizable  ;       themify  ;     }    end init      function themify  {         add theme-based CSS to the elements       $ «div» .addClass «ui-widget»        .addClass «ui-widget-content»        .addClass «ui-corner-all» ;       $ «:header» .addClass «ui-widget-header»        .addClass «ui-corner-all» ;       $ «resizeMe»        .append ‘ <   span>’ ;      }       ]]>        resize.html          Resize Demo           Resize me              Drag the right or bottom to resize.                     Sample Widget          304 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX         This is made to look like a widget       with the theme css code.                 Examining the HTML and standard CSS  As usual, the HTML used in the code example in the preceding section is the  foundation of the entire page. It’s clean, and it shows the general structure of  the page. The HTML consists of only three primary elements: a heading and  two divs. Each div contains its own Level 2 heading and a paragraph. The  divs are given IDs to make them easier to style.  I also included a basic CSS section in the example to handle the general  layout of the page. Because I wanted the widgets to have specific initial sizes,  I used ordinary CSS to create this effect.  Importing files  jQuery applications require the importation of JavaScript code libraries. In  this  and most  jQuery UI applications, I import these three files:  ✓ The main jQuery library: This essential jQuery base library is imported   as described in Chapter 11, as an ordinary JavaScript file.  ✓ The jQuery UI library: This file is also a standard JavaScript library. To   obtain a custom version of this file, see the section “Downloading the  Library,” earlier in this chapter.  ✓ The theme CSS file: When you create a theme with ThemeRoller, you’re   provided with a CSS file. This file is your theme. Because it’s a CSS file  rather than a chunk of JavaScript code, use the link tag to attach it to  your page.    Not all jQuery UI examples require a theme, but most do. As you see in this   example, themes provide some other excellent effects too, so it’s worthwhile  to include a theme CSS file whenever you want to use jQuery UI.             Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  305  Making a resizable element  Surprisingly, the easiest part of the project is making the resizable element  take on the resizable behavior, as shown in this example:                $ init ; function init  {   $ “resizeMe” .resizable  ;   themify  ; }    end init  It’s a standard jQuery UI trick. Follow these steps:  1.  Begin with an initialization function.    Like all good jQuery code, this example begins with standard initialization.  2.  Make an element resizable.    Identify the resizeMe div as a jQuery node, and use the resizable    method to make it resizable. That’s all there is to it.  3.  Call a second function to add theming to the elements.    Though the resizable method doesn’t require the use of jQuery themes,  the themes improve the look of the element.  Adding themes to your elements  The jQuery Theme tool helps you quite easily decorate your elements by  using CSS. The outstanding feature of jQuery themes is that they’re semantic:  You specify the general purpose of the element and then let the theme apply  the appropriate specific CSS. You can use the ThemeRoller application to  easily create new themes or modify existing ones. In this way, you can create  quite a sophisticated look and feel for your site and write a minimal amount  of CSS on your own. Many jQuery interface elements  such as the Accordion  and Tab tools, described elsewhere in this chapter  automatically use the  current CSS theme. You can also apply the theme to any of your own ele- ments, of course, to create a consistent look.  Themes are simply a set of predefined CSS classes. To apply a CSS theme to  an element, you can just add a special class to the object. For example, you  can make a paragraph look like the current definition of the ui-widget by  adding this bit of code to it:    My div now looks like a widget     306 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Of course, adding classes into the HTML violates one principle of semantic  design, so you can more efficiently do the work in JavaScript by using jQuery:  function themify  {     add theme-based CSS to the elements   $ “div” .addClass “ui-widget”    .addClass “ui-widget-content”    .addClass “ui-corner-all” ;   $ “:header” .addClass “ui-widget-header”    .addClass “ui-corner-all” ;   $ “resizeMe”    .append ‘  ’ ; }  The themify   function adds all the themes to the elements on my page,  using the CSS defined by the theme. I use jQuery tricks to simplify the process.  1.  Identify all divs by using jQuery.    To style all divs in your page as widgets, use jQuery to identify all div  elements.  2.  Add the ui-widget class to all divs.    This class is defined in the theme. All jQuery themes have this class  defined, but the specific characteristics  colors and font sizes, for exam- ple  vary by theme. In this way, you can swap out a theme to change its  appearance and the code still works. The ui-widget class defines an  element as a widget.  3.  Add ui-widget-content.    The divs need two classes attached, so I use chaining to specify that  divs should also be members of the ui-widget-content class. This  class indicates that the contents of the widget  and not just the class  itself  should be styled.  4.  Specify rounded corners.    Rounded corners have become a standard feature of Web 2.0 visual  design. This effect is extremely easy to achieve by using jQuery: Just  add the ui-corner-all class to any element that you want to have  rounded corners.   Rounded corners use CSS3, which isn’t yet supported by all browsers.  Your page won’t show rounded corners in most versions of Internet  Explorer, but the page will still work fine otherwise.     5.  Make all headlines conform to the widget-header style.    The jQuery themes include an attractive headline style. You can easily  make all heading tags  from   to    follow this theme. Use the  :header filter to identify all headings, and apply the ui-widget- header and ui-corner-all classes to these headers.                             Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  307  The jQuery UI package supports a number of interesting classes, as  described in Table 12-1.  Table 12-1  Class ui-widget  ui-widget- header  ui-widget- content  ui-state- default  ui-state- hover  ui-state- focus  ui-state- active  ui-state- highlight  ui-state- error  ui-state- error text  ui-state- disabled  ui- corner- all,  ui-corner- tl  etc   ui-widget- shadow  Classes Supported by the jQuery UI Package  Used On Outer container  of widget Heading  element Widget  Clickable  elements Clickable  elements Clickable  elements  Clickable  elements Any widget or  element Any widget or  element Text elements  Any widget or  element Any widget or  element  What It Does Makes the element look like a widget   Applies a distinctive heading  appearance Applies widget content style to an ele- ment and its children Displays standard  unclicked  state  Displays hover state  Displays focus state when element has  keyboard focus Display active state when mouse is  clicked on element Specifies that element is highlighted  Specifies that an element contain an  error message or a warning message Allows error highlighting without chang- ing other elements  mainly used in form  validation  Demonstrates that widget is disabled  Adds current corner size to element;  corners specified by using tl, tr, bl, br,  top, bottom, left, right  Any widget  Applies shadow effect to widget   308 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Note there a few other classes are defined in UI themes, but the ones in this  table are the most commonly used. Please see the current jQuery UI docu- mentation for more details.  Adding an icon  Note the small star that appears inside the resizeMe element in Figure 12-6.  This element is an example of a jQuery UI icon. All jQuery themes support  a standard set of icons, which are small images  16 pixels square . The icon  set includes standard icons for arrows as well as images commonly used in  menus and toolbars  Save and Load or New File, for example . Some jQuery  UI elements use icons automatically, but you can also add them directly.  To use an icon in your programs, follow these steps:  1.  Include a jQuery UI theme.    The icons are part of the theme package. Include the CSS style sheet that  corresponds with the theme  as you did if you followed the instructions  in Chapter 10 .  2.  Ensure that the images are accessible.    When you download a theme package, it includes a directory of images.  The images included in it are used to create custom backgrounds as well  as icons. The CSS file expects a directory named images to be in the  same directory as the CSS. This directory should contain several images  that begin with ui-icons. These images contain all necessary icons. If  the icon image files aren’t available, the icons aren’t displayed.  3.  Create a span where you want the icon to appear.    Place an empty span element wherever you want the icon to appear  in the HTML. You can place the span directly in the HTML or add it by  using jQuery. I prefer to add UI elements by using jQuery, to keep the  HTML as pristine as possible.  4.  Attach the ui-icon class to the span.    This step tells jQuery to treat the span as an icon. The contents of the  span are hidden and the span is resized to hold a 16-pixel-square icon  image.  5.  Attach a second class to identify the specific icon.    Look at the ThemeRoller page to see the available icons. When you hover  the mouse over an icon on this page, you see the class name associated  with the icon.                             Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  309  You can add the code directly in your HTML:      This is my text         Or, you can use jQuery to add the appropriate code to your element:  $ “myPara” .append ‘<span class = “ui-icon ui-icon-  star”> ’ ;  Dragging, Dropping, and Calling Back  JQuery elements look good, but they also have interesting functionality.  Most jQuery UI objects can respond to specialized events. As an example,  look over the dragDrop.html page shown in Figure 12-7.  These elements are all draggable.  This element is the target.  Figure 12-7:  The page  has a group  of draggable  elements  and a target.       When you drop an element on the target, the color and content of the target  change, as shown in Figure 12-8.   310 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   When a draggable element is dropped on the   target, the target takes on a new style.  Figure 12-8:  The target  “knows”  when  something  has been  dropped  on it.       The program demonstrates how jQuery simplifies the task of working with a  number of elements.  Take a look at the entire program before you see its smaller segments:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»         href = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css»  >       .dragMe {     width: 100px;     height: 100px;     border: 1px solid blue;     text-align: center;     background-color: white;     position: absolute;     z-index: 100;   }   target {     width: 200px;     height: 200px;     border: 1px solid red;     text-align: center;     position: absolute;    Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  311      left: 300px;     top: 100px;     z-index: 0;   }       <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js»>          <![CDATA[     $ init ;      function init  {          make some clones of dragMe       cloneDragMe  ;          make all drag me elements draggable       $ «.dragMe» .draggable  ;          set target as droppable       $ «target» .droppable  ;          bind events to target       $ «target» .bind «drop», changeTarget ;       $ «target» .bind «dropout», resetTarget ;      }    end init      function cloneDragMe  {       for  i = 1; i <=4; i++ {         zValue =  101 + i  + «»;         yPos = 100 +  i * 20  + «px»;          $ «div:first» .clone           .insertAfter «div:first»          .css «top», yPos          .css «zIndex», zValue          .append « » + i ;       }    end for loop     }    end cloneDragMe      function changeTarget event, ui {       $ «target» .addClass «ui-state-highlight»        .html «Dropped «        .append ui.draggable.text   ;     }    end changeTarget      function resetTarget event, ui {         $ «target» .removeClass «ui-state-highlight»          .html «Drop on me» ;     }    end reset   312 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX       ]]>        dragDrop.html          Drag and Drop Demo          Drag me             Drop on me          Building the basic page  As is typical with jQuery, the HTML code on this page is misleadingly simple.  It has, strikingly, only a single dragMe element, for example. It’s simpler to  build a single element in HTML and then use jQuery and JavaScript to make  as many copies as you need than it would be to build all the elements by  hand in straight HTML. The page also has a single target element. I added  basic CSS  borders  to make the elements easy to see and set all the elements  as absolutely positioned so that I can control their initial positions. Note that  I attached an ID to the target  as there will be a single target on the page ,  and made dragMe a class  as I want the capability to have several draggable  elements on the page .  Initializing the page  The initialization process is somewhat elaborate, but it still isn’t too difficult  to follow. The main addition is its capability to respond to some specialty  events:  $ init ;  function init  {      make some clones of dragMe   cloneDragMe  ;      make all drag me elements draggable   $ “.dragMe” .draggable  ;      set target as droppable   $ “target” .droppable  ;    Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  313                               bind events to target   $ “target” .bind “drop”, changeTarget ;   $ “target” .bind “dropout”, resetTarget ;  }    end init  Follow these steps:  1.  Make copies of the dragme element.    This step isn’t critical.  In fact, I added it after testing a single element.   However, if you want to have multiple copies of the draggable element,  use a method to encapsulate the process.  2.  Make all dragme elements draggable.    Use the jQuery draggable   method on all elements with the dragMe  class.  3.  Establish the target as a droppable element.    The droppable   method sets up an element so that it can receive  events whenever a draggable element is dropped on it. Note that making  something droppable doesn’t have any particular effect on its own. The  interesting part happens when you bind events to the element.  4.  Bind a drop event to the target.    Droppable elements can have events attached to them, just like any  jQuery object can. However, the mechanism for attaching an event to a  user interface object is a little different from the standard jQuery event  mechanism, which involved a custom function for each event. Use the  bind method to specify a function to be called whenever a particular  event occurs. When the user drops a draggable element on the target  element  the drop event , call the changeTarget   function.  5.  Bind a dropout event to the target.    You can bind another event, dropout, to occur whenever the user  removes all draggable elements from the target. I told the sample pro- gram to call the resetTarget   function whenever this event is  triggered.    You often see programmers using shortcuts for this process. Sometimes   the functions are defined anonymously in the bind call, or sometimes the  event functions are attached as a JSON object directly in the droppable    method assignment. Feel free to use these techniques if you’re comfortable  with them. I chose my technique based on its being the clearest model to  understand.   314 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Handling the drop  When the user drags a dragMe element and drops it on the target, the tar- get’s background color changes and the program reports the text of the ele- ment that was dragged. The code is easy to follow:  function changeTarget event, ui {   $ “target” .addClass “ui-state-highlight”    .html “Dropped “    .append ui.draggable.text   ; }    end changeTarget  To respond to a drop event, follow these steps:  1.  Create a function to correspond to the drop event.    The drop event is bound to the function changeTarget, so you need to  create such a function.  2.  Include two parameters.    Bound event functions require two parameters. The first is an object  that encapsulates the event  much like the one in regular DOM program- ming  and a second element, named ui, which encapsulates information  about the user interface. You use the ui object to determine which drag- gable element was dropped on the target.  3.  Highlight the target.    You should signal that the target’s state has changed. You can change  the CSS directly  using jQuery  or use jQuery theming to apply a pre- defined highlight class. I chose to use the jQuery theme technique to  simply add the ui-state-highlight class to the target object.  4.  Change the text to indicate the new status.    You normally want to do something to indicate what was dropped. If it’s  a shopping application, for example, add the element to an array so that  you can remember what the user wants to purchase. In this example, I  simply changed the text of the target to indicate that the element has  been dropped.  5.  Use ui.draggable to gain access to the element that was dropped.    The ui object contains information about the user interface. The  ui.draggable attribute is a link to the draggable element that trig- gered the current function. It’s a jQuery element, so you can use what- ever jQuery methods you want on it. In this case, I extract the text from  the draggable element and append it to the end of the target’s text.                             Chapter 12: Using the jQuery User Interface Toolkit  315  Dropping out can be fun  Another function is used to handle the dropout condition, which occurs  when draggable elements are no longer sitting on the target. I bound the  resetTarget function to this event:  function resetTarget event, ui {     $ “target” .removeClass “ui-state-highlight”      .html “Drop on me” ; }    end reset            1.  Remove the highlight class from the target.    The theme classes are easily removed. Remove the highlight class and  the target reverts to its original appearance.  2.  Reset the HTML text.    Now that the target is empty, reset its HTML so that it prompts the user  to drop a new element.  Cloning the elements  You can simply run the program as-is  with a single copy of the dragMe class ,  but drag-and-drop is more often used with a number of elements. For example,  you might allow users to drag various icons from your catalog to a shopping  cart. The basic jQuery library provides all the functionality necessary to  make as many copies of an element as you want. Copying an element is a  simple matter of using the jQuery clone   method. The more elaborate  code is used to ensure that the various elements display properly:  function cloneDragMe  {   for  i = 1; i <=4; i++ {     zValue =  101 + i  + “”;     yPos = 100 +  i * 20  + “px”;      $ “div:first” .clone       .insertAfter “div:first”      .css “top”, yPos      .css “zIndex”, zValue      .append “ ” + i ;   }    end for loop }    end cloneDragMe   316 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                                           To build multiple copies of the draggable element, follow these steps:  1.  Create a for loop.    Any time you’re doing something repetitive, a for loop is a likely tool  for the job. To make four clones numbered 1 through 4, as shown in the  example, you name a variable I, which varies from 1 to 4.  2.  Create a zValue variable for the element.    The CSS zIndex property is used to indicate the overlapping of ele- ments. Higher values appear to be closer to the user. In the example, I  gave each element a zOrder of over 100, to ensure that each element  appears over the target.  If you don’t specify zIndex, dragged elements  might be placed under the target and become invisible. The zValue  variable is mapped to zIndex.   3.  Determine the Y position of the element.    I want each successive copy of the dragMe element to be a bit lower  than the previous one. Multiplying i by 20 ensures that each element is  separated from the previous one by 20 pixels. Add 100 pixels to move  the new stack of elements near the original.  4.  Make a clone of the first element.    Use the clone   method to make a clone of the first div.  Use the  :first filter to specify which div you want to copy.   5.  Remember to insert the newly cloned element.    The cloned element exists only in memory until it’s added somehow to  the page. I chose to add the element right after the first element.  6.  Set the top of the element with the yPos variable.    Use the yPos variable you calculated earlier in this function to set the  vertical position of the newly minted element. Use the css   method to  apply the yPos variable to the element’s left CSS rule.  7.  Set zIndex.    As with the y position, the zValue variable you created is mapped to a  CSS value. In this case, zValue is mapped to the zIndex property.  8.  Add the index to the element’s text.    Use the append   method to add the value of i to the element’s HTML.  This way, you can tell which element is which.   Chapter 13  Improving Usability with jQuery  In This Chapter ▶ Creating an accordion page ▶ Building a tab-based interface ▶ Working with scrollbars ▶ Managing selectable items ▶ Building a sorting mechanism ▶ Using the dialog box tool  The jQuery UI adds some outstanding capabilities to your Web pages.   Some of the most interesting tools are widgets, which are user interface   elements not supplied in standard HTML. Some of these elements supple- ment HTML by providing easier input options. For example, getting users to  enter dates in a predictable manner can be quite difficult. The datePicker  widget’s interface is easy for programmers to add and easy for users to use.  Another important class of tools provided by the jQuery UI helps manage  complex pages by hiding content until it is needed.  Multi-Element Designs  The issue of how to handle page complexity has been constant in Web devel- opment. As a page grows longer and more complex, navigating it becomes  difficult. Early versions of HTML had few solutions to this problem. The use  of frames was popular because it lets programmers place navigation informa- tion in one frame and content in another. Frames added usability problems,  however, so they have fallen from favor. Although dynamic HTML and AJAX  seem like perfect replacement technologies, they can be difficult to imple- ment, especially in a reliable cross-browser manner.   318 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   The jQuery UI provides two incredible tools for the management of larger  pages:        ✓ Accordion tool: Creates a large page but display only smaller parts of it   at a time.  ✓ Tabs tool: Easily turns a large page into a page with a tab menu.  These tools are incredibly easy to use, and they add tremendously to your  page development options. Both tools help automate and simplify the task of  working with the DOM  document object model  and AJAX, which is neces- sary to build a large page with dynamic content.  Using the Accordion widget  Some of the most powerful jQuery tools are the easiest to use. The Accordion  widget has become an extremely popular part of the jQuery UI toolset. Take a  look at accordion.html in Figure 13-1 to see how it works.  Figure 13-1:  The original  chapter  outline of  a familiar- sounding  book.         Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  319  When you look at Figure 13-1, you see headings for the first three chapters of  this book. The details for the first chapter are available, but the other chap- ters’ details are hidden. If you click the heading for Chapter 2, you see the  screen shown in Figure 13-2, where the Chapter 1 TOC is minimized and the  Chapter 2 TOC is expanded.  Figure 13-2:  The Chapter  1 TOC is  minimized;  the Chapter  2 TOC is  expanded.       This marvelous effect lets a user focus on a particular part of a larger context  while seeing the overall outline. It’s called an accordion because the various  pieces expand and contract to let a user focus on a part of the page without  losing track of its position in the whole. Collapsible content has become an  important usability tool made popular by the system bar in the Mac OS and  by other popular usability tools.  The accordion effect is strikingly easy to achieve with jQuery:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»   320 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX           href = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css»  >            <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ «accordion» .accordion  ;     }       ]]>             accordion.html       Accordion Demo         1 - Gathering Your Tools                    Picking your computer           Choosing an editor           Working with Internet Explorer           Using Firefox           Adding extensions to Firefox           Using other Browsers              2 Getting Started with JavaScript<   a>                    Writing your first JavaScript program           Introducing variables           Using concatenation           Understanding String objects           Managing variable types                3 Making Decisions with Conditions<   a>                    Working with random numbers           Using  if  to control flow           Using the  else  clause           Using  switch  for more complex   branching            Nesting  if  statements                   Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  321                                As you can see by looking over this chunk of code, it consists mainly of  HTML. The accordion effect is easy to accomplish — follow these steps:  1.  Import all the usual suspects.    Import the jQuery and jQuery UI JavaScript files and a theme CSS file.   See Chapter 12 for a refresher.  Also, make sure that the CSS can access  the images directory, with icons and backgrounds, because the CSS uses  some of these images automatically.  2.  Build your HTML page in the normal way.    Build an HTML page, and pay attention to the sections you want to col- lapse. You should normally have a heading tag for each element, all at  the same level  Level 2 headings, in my case .  3.  Create a div containing the entire collapsible content.    Put all collapsible content in a single div with an id. You’ll turn this  div into an accordion jQuery element.  4.  Add an anchor around each heading you want to specify as collapsible.   Place an empty anchor tag      around each head- ing you want to use as a collapsible heading. The  sign indicates that  the anchor will call the same page and is used as a placeholder by the  jQuery UI engine. You can add the anchor directly in the HTML or by  using jQuery code.  5.  Create a jQuery init   function.    Use the normal techniques  described in Chapter 10  to build a jQuery  initializer.  6.  Apply the accordion   method to the div.    Use jQuery to identify the div containing collapsible content and apply  accordion   to it:  function init  {   $ “accordion” .accordion  ; }  The accordion tool automatically breaks the page into sections based on the  header elements. Look into the jQuery UI documentation for details on other  options. You can set some other element to indicate section breaks, allow for  all elements to be collapsed at the same time, and other interesting effects.   322 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Building a tabbed interface  Another important technique in Web development is the use of a tabbed  interface. A user can then change the contents of a segment by selecting one  of a series of tabs. Figure 13-3 shows an example.  Figure 13-3:  Another  way to  look at that  hauntingly  familiar  table of  contents.       In a tabbed interface, only one element is visible at a time, but all tabs are  visible. The tabbed interface is a little more predictable than the accordion  because the tabs  unlike the accordion’s headings  remain in place. The tabs  change colors to indicate which tab is highlighted, and a tab changes state  to indicate that a user is hovering the mouse over it. Whenever you click  another tab, the main content area of the widget is replaced with the corre- sponding content. Figure 13-4 shows you what happens when the user clicks  the Chapter 3 tab.    Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  323  Figure 13-4:  Clicking a  tab changes  the main  content and  the appear- ance of the  tabs.       Like the accordion, the tab effect is incredibly easy to achieve. Look over the  following chunk of code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»         href = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css»  >            <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {   324 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX         $ «tabs» .tabs  ;     }       ]]>             tabs.html       Tab Demo               Chapter 1         Chapter 2         Chapter 3                   1 - Gathering Your Tools                   Picking your computer           Choosing an editor           Working with Internet Explorer           Using Firefox           Adding extensions to Firefox           Using other Browsers                        2 Getting Started with JavaScript                   Writing your first JavaScript program           Introducing variables           Using concatenation           Understanding String objects           Managing variable types                          3 Making Decisions with Conditions                   Working with random numbers           Using  if  to control flow           Using the  else  clause           Using  switch  for more complex   branching            Nesting  if  statements                       Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  325                                   The mechanism for building a tab-based interface is quite similar to the one  for accordions. Follow these steps:  1.  Add all appropriate files.    As with most jQuery UI effects, you need jQuery and jQueryUI and a  theme CSS file. You also need to have access to the images directory for  the theme’s background graphics.  2.  Build HTML as normal.    If you’re building a well-organized Web page anyway, you’re already  close to the organization you’ll need for tabs.  3.  Build a div containing all tabbed data.    This element is the one you perform the jQuery “magic” on.  4.  Place main content areas in named divs.    Place each piece of content to be displayed as a page in a div with a  descriptive id. Place each div in the tab div.  See the preceding code  listing for organization if you’re confused.   5.  Add a list of local links to the content.    Build a menu of links and place it at the top of the tabbed div. Each link  should be a local link to one of the divs. For example, my index looks  like this:        Chapter 1       Chapter 2       Chapter 3      6.  Build an init function as usual.    Use the normal jQuery techniques.  7.  Call the tabs   method on the main div.    Incredibly, one line of jQuery code does all the work!  Using tabs with AJAX  You have an even easier way to work with the jQuery tab interface. Rather  than place all your code in a single file, place the HTML code for each panel  in a separate HTML file. You can then use a simplified form of the tab mecha- nism to automatically import the various code snippets by using AJAX calls.  The following AJAXtabs.html code is an example:   326 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >    <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»         href = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css»  >    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js»>            <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ «tabs» .tabs  ;     }       ]]>           AJAXtabs.html         AJAX tabs                        Chapter 1             Chapter 2             Chapter 3                    Note: I didn’t provide a figure for the AJAXtabs.html page because it looks  to the user exactly like tabs.html  refer to Figure 13-4 .  This version of the code contains none of the actual content. Instead, jQuery  builds the tab structure and then uses the links to make AJAX requests to  load the content. As a default, it finds the content specified by the first tab   chap1.html  and loads it into the display area. This chunk of code shows  you what chap1.html contains:    Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  327       1 - Gathering Your Tools                   Picking your computer           Choosing an editor           Working with Internet Explorer           Using Firefox           Adding extensions to Firefox           Using other Browsers           As you can see, chap1.html is simply a code snippet. It doesn’t need the  complete trappings of a Web page  such as a doctype or header  because it’s  meant to be pulled in as part of a larger page.  This technique is marvelous because it lets you build a modular system  quite easily — you can build these code pages separately and include them  in a larger page. You then have a good foundation for a content management  system.  Improving Usability  Although the UI widgets are good looking and fun to use, another important  aspect of these tools is how they can improve usability. Often, Web pages are  used to get information from users. Certain kinds of information can be dif- ficult for users to enter correctly. The jQuery UI elements include a number  of tools to help you with this specific problem. The UItools.html page,  shown in Figure 13-5, illustrates some of these techniques.  A great deal is happening on this page, but the tabbed interface truly cleans  it up and lets users concentrate on one idea at a time. Using the tabbed inter- face can simplify your users’ lives.  This page is a bit long because it has a number of sections. I demonstrate  the code in chunks to make it easier to manage. Be sure to look on either  of the Web site  www.dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd or www. aharrisbooks.net jad  for the complete code.   328 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 13-5:  The UITools  page uses  a tabbed  interface to  demonstrate  a few input  tools.       Here’s the main HTML code so that you can see the general structure of the  page:   UI tools              datePicker         slider         selectable         sortable         dialog        A main div, named tabs, contains a list of links to the various divs that  will contain the demonstrations. I describe each of these divs in the section  that demonstrates it, later in this chapter. The page also imports jQuery,  jQueryUI, and the theme CSS. The init   method contains most of the  jQuery code:    Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  329  $ init ;  function init  {   $ “h1” .addClass “ui-widget-header” ;    $ “tabs” .tabs  ;   $ “datePicker” .datepicker  ;    $ “slider” .slider     .bind “slide”, reportSlider ;    $ “selectable” .selectable  ;    $ “sortable” .sortable  ;    $ “dialog” .dialog  ;      initially close dialog   $ “dialog” .dialog “close” ;  }    end init  The details of the init   function are described in the following sections.  The dating game  Imagine that you’re writing a program requiring a birth date or other date  information. Getting date information from a user can be an especially messy  problem because so many variations exist. Users might use numbers, month  names, or abbreviations to indicate the month, for example. Some people use  the format month day year, and others use day month year. Some people  indicate the year by entering two characters, and other people use four.  Worse, picking a date without a calendar in front of you is difficult.  The Date Picker dialog box is one of the coolest elements in the entire jQuery  UI library. When you add datepicker   functionality to a text box, the text  box becomes a date picker. When a user selects the date box, a calendar  automatically pops up, like the one shown in Figure 13-6.   330 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 13-6:  The  datePicker  element  turns any  text field  into a  calendar.  The user clicks a date in the calendar...     ...and the date appears in the text field.  After a user selects a date on the calendar, the date is placed in the text box  in a standard format — there’s no better way to get date input from the user.  Building a date picker couldn’t be easier. Follow these steps:  1.  Begin with a jQuery UI page.  2.  Build a form with a text field.    You need jQuery and jQuery UI and a theme to use datePicker.    Any standard text input element will work. Be sure to give the element  an id so that you can refer to it in JavaScript:       date picker    <input type = “text”          id = “datePicker”  >    3.  Isolate the text input element by using jQuery.    Build a standard jQuery node from the input element.                     Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  331            4.  Add datepicker   functionality.    Use the datePicker   method to convert the text node into a date  picker. The rest of the magic happens automatically. When the user  selects the text area, it is automatically converted to the calendar. When  the user has selected a date on the calendar, the element converts back  to a text area with the appropriate date in place.  $ “datePicker” .datepicker  ;  5.  Retrieve data from the form element in the normal way.    When a user selects a date, it’s placed in the text field automatically. As  far as your program is concerned, the text field is still an ordinary text  field. Retrieve the data as you do for a normal text field.    The date picker is a powerful tool with a large number of additional options.   Look at the jQuery UI documentation to see how to use it to select date  ranges, produce specific date formats, and do much more.  Picking numbers with the slider  Numeric input is another significant usability problem. When you want users  to enter numeric information, ensuring that the data is truly a number, and  that it’s in the range you want, can be quite difficult. Traditional program- mers often use sliders  sometimes called scrollbars  to simplify the accep- tance of numeric input. Figure 13-7 shows a slider in action.  The slider is, like many jQuery UI objects, easy to set up. Here’s the relevant  chunk of HTML code:       slider          0     The slider tab is a basic div. It contains two other divs. The slider div is  empty. It’s replaced by the slider element when the jQuery is activated. The  other div in this section is used to output the current value of the slider.  Create the slider element in the init   function with some predictable  jQuery code:  $ “slider” .slider  ;  The slider   method turns any jQuery element into a slider, replacing the  contents with a visual slider.   332 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 13-7:  Using a  slider to  choose a  number with  the mouse.         Note that you can add a JSON object as a parameter to set up the slider   with various options. See rgbSlider.html on this book’s Web site  www. dummies.com go javascriptandajaxfd or www.aharrisbooks.net  jad  for an example of sliders with customization.  You can set up a callback method to be called whenever the slider is moved.  In my example, I chained this callback code to the code that created the  slider in the first place:  $ “slider” .slider   .bind “slide”, reportSlider ;  Use the bind method to bind the reportSlider function  described next   to the slide event.  The reportSlider   function reads the slider’s value and reports it in an  output div:  function reportSlider  {   var sliderVal = $ “slider” .slider “value” ;   $ “slideOutput” .html sliderVal ; }    end reportSlider    Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  333  To read the value of a slider, identify the jQuery node and invoke its  slider   method again. This time, pass the single word value and you get  the value of the slider. You can pass the resulting value to a variable, as I did,  and then do anything you want with that variable.  Selectable elements  You may have a situation where you want users to choose from a list of ele- ments. The selectable widget is a useful way to create this functionality  from an ordinary list. Users can drag or Control-click items to select them.  Special CSS classes are automatically applied to indicate that the item is  selected or being considered for selection. Figure 13-8 illustrates the selec- tion in process.  Figure 13-8:  You can  easily  choose  selectable  items with  the mouse.       Dragging the mouse over these elements changes their style and marks them as selected.  To make a selectable element, follow these steps:   334 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   1.  Begin with an unordered list. 2.  Build a standard unordered list in your HTML. Give the ul an id so   that it can be identified as a jQuery node:                  3.  Add CSS classes for selecting and selected states.    If you want to have a specific appearance when the items are being  selected or have been selected, add CSS classes:       selectable           alpha       beta       gamma       delta             h1 {     text-align: center;   }    selectable .ui-selecting {     background-color: gray;   }   selectable .ui-selected {     background-color: black;     color: white;   }    4.  In the init   function, specify the list as a selectable node. Use the   standard jQuery syntax: selectable  : $ “selectable” .selectable  ;    The ui-selected class is attached to all elements when they have  been selected. Be sure to add some kind of CSS to this class or else you  can’t tell that items have been selected.  If you want to do something with all the items that have been selected, just  create a jQuery group of elements with the ui-selected class:  var selectedItems = $ “.ui-selected” ;    Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  335  Building a sortable list  Sometimes, you want users to be able to change the order of a list, which is  easily done by using the sortable widget. The top of Figure 13-9 shows the  sortable list in its default configuration. The user can “grab” members of the  list and change their order  see the bottom of Figure 13-9 .  Figure 13-9:  Users can  drag the  elements of  an ordinary  list  top  into  different  orders   bottom .              Making a sortable list is easy. Follow these steps:  1.  Build a regular list. 2.  Add an id.    Sortable elements are usually lists. The list is a regular list, but with an id:       sortable           alpha       beta       gamma       delta          336 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX      3.  Turn it into a sortable node by adding the following code to the   init   method:  $ “sortable” .sortable  ;  Creating a custom dialog box  Although JavaScript supplies a few dialog boxes  the alert and prompt dialog  boxes , they’re quite ugly and relatively inflexible. The jQuery UI includes a  technique for turning any div into a virtual dialog box. The dialog box fol- lows the theme and can be resized and moved. Figure 13-10 shows a dialog  box in action.  Figure 13-10:  This dialog  box is a  jQuery UI  node.         Chapter 13: Improving Usability with jQuery  337  Building the dialog box isn’t difficult, but you need to be able to turn it on  and off by using code. Follow these steps:  1.  Create the div you intend to use as a dialog box.    Create a div and give it an id so that you can turn it into a dialog box  node. Add the title attribute, and the title shows up on the title bar of  the dialog box:  <div id = “dialog”      title = “my dialog”>         The dialog class allows you to have a movable,       customized dialog box consistent with the   sizable  installed      page theme.        2.  Turn the div into a dialog box.    Use the dialog   method to turn the div into a jQuery dialog box node  in the init   function:  $ “dialog” .dialog  ;  3.  Hide the dialog box by default.    Usually, you don’t want the dialog box visible until an event takes place.  In this particular example, I don’t want the dialog box to appear until the  user clicks a button. I added some code that will close the dialog box  in the init   function so that the dialog box doesn’t appear until it’s  summoned.  4.  Close the dialog box.    Refer to the dialog box node and call the dialog   method on it again.  This time, send the single value “close” as a parameter, and the dialog  box immediately closes:    initially close dialog $ “dialog” .dialog “close” ;  5.  Click the x to close the dialog box.    The dialog box has a small x icon that looks like the Close icon in most  windowing systems. Users can close the dialog box by clicking this icon.                            338 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX        6.  Write code to manage opening and closing the dialog box.    My Open and Close buttons call functions that control the behavior of  the dialog box. For example, here’s the function attached to the Open  Dialog button:  function openDialog  {   $ “dialog” .dialog “open” ; }    end openDialog   Chapter 14  Working with AJAX Data  In This Chapter ▶ Understanding the advantages of server-side programming ▶ Getting to know PHP ▶ Writing a form for standard PHP processing ▶ Building virtual forms with AJAX ▶ Submitting interactive AJAX requests ▶ Working with XML data ▶ Responding to JSON data  AJAX and jQuery are incredibly useful, but perhaps the most important   use of AJAX is to serve as a conduit between the Web page and pro-  grams written on the server. In this chapter, you get an overview of how pro- gramming works on the Web server. First you look at traditional server-side  programs, and then I explain how AJAX changes the equation. You find out  the main forms of data sent from the server and how to interpret this data  with jQuery and JavaScript.  Getting an Overview of Server-Side  Programming  The JavaScript programming you do throughout this book primarily works  on the Web browser — the client. However, all Web programming also has  a relationship with the machine that hosts Web pages — the server. In the  examples so far, the Web page is retrieved from the server, and then the  JavaScript programs inside the page are executed by the client machine. This  is a very powerful approach, but it does have limitations. Most importantly,  client-side code cannot store data or access external programs for security  reasons.   340 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Fortunately, there’s a solution. You can also write programs that reside on  the Web server. They work a little differently than client-side programs. A  server-side program runs on the Web server, and when it’s done, it produces  an ordinary Web page. The Web page is then sent to the client, where it’s  interpreted by the browser.    Server-side programs are processed before the data is transmitted to the  browser, and client-side programs are processed after the transmission.  You can do things on the server that aren’t allowed on the client, including  storing data and accessing external programs. These are the two things that  client-side programs can’t do, so server-side programming is a perfect match  for the client-side skills described in this book.  Introducing PHP  Several languages are used for server-side programming. The most popular  of these are PHP, Java, and ASP.NET. For the examples in this book, I concen- trate on PHP:  ✓ It’s very popular. PHP is used on thousands of Web sites and has a mas-  sive following among programmers.  ✓ It’s quite powerful. Although PHP isn’t quite as powerful as some   languages, it’s robust enough to support some very large sites  like  Facebook and Flickr .  ✓ It’s entirely free. PHP is an open-source language, which means it   doesn’t cost anything and can be freely modified. You also don’t need to  purchase any special editor to write PHP — the text editors you already  use are perfectly fine.  ✓ It’s readily available. Pretty much every commercial server and even  some free servers support PHP. You generally have to pay more for a  custom server to handle Java or ASP.NET.  ✓ It’s pretty easy. Although PHP isn’t exactly like JavaScript, it’s quite   similar. You’ll be able to transfer much of your programming knowledge  to PHP with only a few details to worry about.  Although you can practice JavaScript on a standalone computer, PHP only  works through a Web server. If you want to experiment with PHP, you must  have access to a Web server with PHP installed. There are two main ways to  do this:                   Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  341        ✓ Get an online account. If you have a hosting account for your Web  pages, you probably already have support for PHP. You might need  to check your control panel to see whether there are any restrictions  or details you need to know. Many free accounts include PHP access,  so you can try PHP without any cost to see if you like it.  The hosting  service I use offers quite a good free service with PHP access. Check  http:  freehostia.com.   ✓ Install your own Web server. If you want to practice on your own com- puter, you can install your own Web server. The best way to do this is  with a complete installation like XAMPP  www.apachefriends.org  en xampp.html . The XAMPP package is a complete installation of  all the tools you need including a Web server  Apache  programming  languages  PHP and Perl  a database package  MySQL  and some other  goodies, all configured to work together. XAMPP is available for all  major operating systems, but if you’re running Linux, you might already  have everything you need.   Note that you can write PHP programs on any computer with the same text  editor you use for other Web programming, but you can test PHP programs  only when your program runs directly through a Web server. This is neces- sary because the Web server actually runs PHP before the user sees the page.  If there is no Web server  or it is not configured properly , the PHP code will  not execute.     Aptana  see Chapter 1  has a great PHP mode, but you’ll have to download  a free add-on to get this capability. Go to the My Aptana window  from the  Window menu  and click the Plugins tab. You should see a link to download  and install the PHP plugin. With the plugin installed, you’ll have the same fea- tures  syntax highlighting, syntax completion, integrated help, and so on  with  PHP that you already have for the other Web languages.  Writing a form for PHP processing  The best way to see how server-side programming  and PHP  works is to look  at a simple example. Figure 14-1 illustrates a basic XHTML Web page with a  form.  The page doesn’t look too scary, but it does have an interesting twist.  There is no JavaScript code in this form. When the user clicks the button,  information is sent to the server, which finds a new program. This program   greetUser.php  examines the contents of the form and composes a new  page in reply, which is shown in Figure 14-2.   342 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 14-1:  This Web  page has  a form.    Figure 14-2:  In server- side pro- gramming,  the result is  an entirely  different  page.          This example points out a key difference between client-side and server-side  processing: On the client  in JavaScript , your code resides on the Web page  and modifies the same page. In server-side programming  like PHP , the  request form and the response are entirely different pages. Typical PHP code  involves building an entirely new page from scratch for the result.  Begin by looking at the XHTML source code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=»EN» dir=»ltr» xmlns=»http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml»>                                      <meta http-equiv=”content-type”   content=”text xml; charset=utf-8”  >       nameForm.html          Typical HTML Form    <form action = “greetUser.php”         method = “get”>          Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  343        <input type = “text”              name = “userName”              value = “Andy”  >                 submit                        It’s nothing too shocking, but if you’re used to writing forms for JavaScript,  you’ll see there are a few differences when you write a form for server-side  processing:  1.  No JavaScript is necessary.     It’s possible to use client and server programming techniques together   in fact that is the point of AJAX , but it isn’t necessary. For this first  example, all code will be processed on the server.  2.  Designate a target program in the form’s action attribute.     When you create a form for JavaScript use, the action attribute is  empty, indicating that all processing will happen on the current page.  For server-side processing, indicate the name of the program that will  read the form data  in this case, greetUser.php  in the action  attribute.  3.  Determine the transfer method.    There are two main ways to transmit form data to the receiving pro- gram. The get mechanism embeds data in the URL. This technique is  useful for debugging  as the data is visible , but gets awkward for large  forms. The post technique is preferred for larger forms, as it sends the  data through a less visible mechanism.  4.  Add a name attribute to form fields.     In client-side programming, you typically use the id attribute to identify  fields. Server-side programs prefer the name identifier. You can  and  often will  use both. For this example, I’ve named the single text field  userName.  5.  Include a submit button.     For client-side processing, you normally use a standard button. Server- side programming typically requires a submit button instead. When the  user clicks the submit button, all the data in the form is automatically  packaged and sent to the program indicated in the form’s action  attribute.                            344 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                   If you get an error message when you submit this program, make sure you’re  running it correctly. If the URL in your browser begins with file:  , you’re  bypassing the server. This method is fine in client-side programming, but  it doesn’t work when you’re messing with the server. You need to have an  address that begins with http:   in order for server-side programs to work  correctly.  Responding to the request  When the user clicks the submit button of nameForm.html, the form infor- mation is bundled and passed to the greetUser.php program. If you look  over the code for this program, you might find it surprisingly familiar:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>                                      <meta http-equiv=»content-type»   content=»text xml; charset=utf-8»  >       greetUser.php          Greet user Response    <?php   $userName = $_REQUEST[«userName»];   print « Hi, $userName!  «;   ?>      For the most part, a PHP program looks a lot like an XHTML page, because  mostly that’s what it is. The general structure is just like XHTML. There are  only a few key differences.  1.  The filename must end with .php.     This indicates to the server that the page isn’t ordinary HTML but will  need to be passed through the PHP interpreter before being sent to the  user.  2.  The <?php marker indicates a switch to PHP syntax.     Most of this page is standard XHTML  and can include CSS and  JavaScript, too . In the middle of the page, I indicate that a section of  code should be processed by PHP. I signify this with the <?php symbol.   Occasionally you’ll see other variations, but this almost always works.   3.  Make a variable called $userName.     Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  345                                PHP supports variables just like JavaScript, but PHP variable names  always begin with the dollar sign  $ . This turns out to be quite useful   as you’ll see in a moment .    $userName = $_REQUEST[“userName”];  4.  Grab the value of the userName field from the previous form.    PHP has a structure called $_REQUEST, which is a package of all the  data sent from the form. You can find the data in the field called  userName by looking for $_REQUEST[“userName”].   5.  Copy the form data into a PHP variable.    Now I have a variable called $userName that contains the data from the  userName field in the previous form. Repeat this process for each form  variable you want to retrieve from the form.  6.  Print some new content.    The print statement in PHP prints text to the current spot in the HTML.  In essence, it allows you to customize parts of the page on the fly. In this  case, I want to add a paragraph with a greeting. Note that you should  still strive for valid XHTML in your print statements.    print “ Hi, $userName!  “;  7.  Interpolate variables.    Notice how I added the $userName variable directly in the print state- ment. This technique is called interpolation. If PHP sees a term beginning  with a dollar sign being printed, it knows it’s looking at a variable and  replaces the variable name with its value.   8.  End the PHP segment with ?>.    This symbol indicates the end of PHP processing and takes you back to  XHTML mode.    Obviously this is a very cursory overview of PHP. It’s a complete language   with a lot more potential than I’m showing in this basic example. If you want  to know more, there are many books on PHP that can take you farther  includ- ing some I have written.  Take a look at www.php.net or my own site  www. aharrisbooks.net  for much more information on the PHP language. You  can also visit www.wiley.com to find more great books packed with PHP info.  Sending Requests AJAX-Style  So far all the AJAX work in this book has involved importing a preformatted  HTML file. That’s a great use of AJAX, but the really exciting aspect of AJAX  is how it tightens the relationship between the client and server. Figure 14-3  shows a page called AJAXtest.html, which uses a JavaScript function to  call a PHP program and incorporates the results into the same page.   346 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 14-3:  This page  gets data  from PHP  with no  form!       Sending the data  The AJAX version of this program is interesting because it has no form, uses  exactly the same PHP program as nameForm.html, and incorporates the  results of the PHP program directly onto the same page. Begin by looking  over the code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >             <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>       Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  347                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $.get «greetUser.php», { «userName»: «Andy» },   processResult ;      }          function processResult data, textStatus {       $ «output» .html data ;     }       ]]>             AJAXTest.html       AJAX Test      This is the default output         This program uses a jQuery function to simulate a form. It generates its own  virtual form and passes it directly to the PHP program. The PHP program  then processes the form data and produces text results, which are avail- able for JavaScript to handle directly. In essence, JavaScript and jQuery are  directly managing the server request  rather than allowing the browser to do  it automatically , so the programmer has more control over the process.  Here’s how it works:  1.  Begin with an XHTML framework.     As always, XHTML forms the spine of any Web program. The XHTML  here is quite simple: a heading and a div for output. Note that this  example doesn’t include a form.  2.  Include the jQuery library.     It’s possible to do AJAX without jQuery, but there’s not much reason to  do that. The jQuery library makes life much easier and manages cross- browser issues to boot. You can also incorporate the jQuery UI and a  theme if you choose, but they aren’t absolutely necessary.             348 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                            3.  Initialize as usual.     As soon as this program runs, it’s going to get data from the server.  In  the next example, I show you how to make this process more interac- tive.  Set up an init   function in the normal way to handle immediate  execution once the page has loaded.  4.  Use the .get   function to set up an AJAX call.     jQuery has a number of interesting AJAX functions. The .ajax func- tion is a very powerful tool for managing all kinds of AJAX requests, but  jQuery also includes a number of utility functions that simplify particu- lar kinds of requests. The .get   function used here sets up a request  that looks to the server just like a form submitted with the get method.   Yep, there’s also a post   function that acts like a post form.   5.  Indicate the program to receive the request.     Typically your AJAX requests will specify a program, which should  respond to the request. I’m using greetUser.php, the exact same pro- gram called by the simpler nameForm.html page.  6.  Pass form data as a JSON object.    Encapsulate all the data you want to send to the program as a JSON  object.  Check Chapter 5 for a refresher on JSON.  Typically this is a  series of name value pairs. In this example, I’m simply indicating a field  named userName with the value “Andy”.  7.  Specify a callback function.    Normally you’ll want to do something with the results of an AJAX call.  Use a callback function to indicate which function should execute when  the AJAX call is completed. In this example, I call the processResult  function as soon as the server has finished returning the form data.  Responding to the results  The greetUser.php program on the server will be run by the AJAXTest. html page. As far as greetUser.php knows, the data came from an ordi- nary form. This means I can use exactly the same program to work with the  AJAX request that I used for the previous example. I don’t re-create the PHP  code here because it hasn’t changed.  Back in the HTML, I need a function to process the results of the AJAX  request after it has returned from the server. The processResult   func- tion has been designated as the callback function, so take another look at  that function:    Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  349      function processResult data, textStatus {       $ “output” .html data ;     }  This function is pretty simple with jQuery:  1.  Accept two parameters.     AJAX callback functions accept two parameters. The first is a string con- taining whatever output was sent by the server  in this case, the greet- ing from processResult.php . The second parameter contains the  text version of the HTTP status result. The status is useful for testing in  case the AJAX request was unsuccessful.  2.  Identify an output area.    I just make a jQuery node from the output div.  3.  Pass the data to the output.    You’ll sometimes do more elaborate work with AJAX results, but for now  my results are plain HTML that I can just copy straight to the div.                Building a More Interactive Form   Although AJAX can replace the form mechanism, it’s usually used in conjunc- tion with ordinary forms to produce effects that would otherwise be difficult  to achieve. For example, you might see a form that fills in some information  for you by guessing at your data based on the first few characters of input.  While it’s pretty easy to get real-time interaction on the client, it’s much more  difficult to achieve this effect with server-side programs, because the server  typically rebuilds the entire page at each pass. With AJAX, you can have the  quick interaction of client-side programming along with the power of server- side programming. The interactiveForm.html demo, shown in Figure  14-4 shows a simple variation of this concept.    This example produces a complete round-trip to the server on each keystroke.   That’s a lot of overkill for this simple example  which could be achieved with  ordinary JavaScript  but imagine how powerful it could be. On each trip to the  server, the program can check my name against a list of hundreds of names,  and it can provide a hint as soon as it has enough letters. A server-side pro- gram can perform data searches against huge databases. You’ve probably  seen this effect on pages you’ve used. You need a little more knowledge of  server-side programming and databases than I can provide in this book to  achieve the entire effect, but you can clearly see from this example how the  AJAX part works.   350 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Figure 14-4:  This page  has a form.  As the user  types data  in, that data  is copied to  the output.       Creating an AJAX form  You can create a form for AJAX use much like any other form. Here’s the full  code for interactiveForm.html:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >             <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                  <![CDATA[         function getGreeting  {       var userName = $ «userName» .val  ;    Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  351        $.get «simpleGreet.php», { «userName»: userName },   processResult ;      }              function processResult data, textStatus {       $ «output» .html data ;     }       ]]>             InteractiveForm.html       Interactive Form                   <input type = “text”              id = “userName”              value = “Andy”               onkeyup = “getGreeting  ”  >               This is the default output                       As you look over the XHTML code, you’ll notice that the form is set up more  for JavaScript than server-side processing:  1.  Include jQuery.    Have I mentioned how cool jQuery is?  2.  The form action can be null.     This time you’re going to read the form in JavaScript and produce an  AJAX request. The form action can  and should  be null, because you  want JavaScript to submit the request, not the browser.  3.  You don’t need to specify a transmission method in the form.    As far as the form is concerned, it’s a client-side form, so you don’t need  to specify whether it is sent as a get or post request.  The AJAX call  takes care of that.    352 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                           4.  The input element has an id attribute but no name.    It can have a name, but it isn’t necessary, because the server won’t pro- cess it directly. You use the id attribute to get access to this element  and then package your own JSON object to send to the PHP program  through AJAX.  5.  The event is called when the text field changes.    Often AJAX requests are meant to happen automatically, without requir- ing the user to press a submit button. To get this effect, you can use the  onkeyup event handler. This event handler calls a function whenever  the specified element has the focus and a key has been pressed and  released.   Writing the JavaScript code  The JavaScript code is even simpler than normal. For one thing, this particu- lar program doesn’t require an init   because nothing needs to be initial- ized. Of course, it’s likely that you’ll have a more elaborate project that might  involve initialization  with jQuery UI elements, for example , but I kept this  example simple for clarity.  The getGreeting   function extracts data from the form and uses it to  send an AJAX request:      function getGreeting  {       var userName = $ “userName” .val  ;       $.get “simpleGreet.php”, { “userName”: userName },   processResult ;      }    The getGreeting   function encapsulates the process of sending a form.  1.  Extract the value of the userName field.    Create a jQuery node from the userName field and use the val    method to extract its value.   2.  Store the value in a variable.    Store the value in a variable also called userName.  3.  Use the get   method to set up an AJAX call.    The jQuery get   method simulates sending a form through the get  method.  Of course, there’s also a post   method, if you prefer.     Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  353                 4.  Indicate the program that will respond to the data.    For this example, I use a variation of the greetUser.php program  called simpleGreet.php. Look at the next section to see how AJAX can  simplify your PHP code.  5.  Send form fields as a JSON object.    The virtual form  which in this case is based on a real form  has one  field called userName. I send it the value of the userName variable.  6.  Specify a callback function.    Most AJAX calls have a callback function that should be executed  when the data transmission is complete. In this example, I’m using the  processResult function.  Processing the result  The processing is quite easy in this case because I simply want to copy the  results of the PHP program directly to the output div:      function processResult data, textStatus {       $ “output” .html data ;     }  The data parameter contains the text data returned from the AJAX call. I  simply grab that text and pass it to the output div.  Simplifying PHP for AJAX  One of the nice things about AJAX is how it simplifies your server-side pro- gramming. If you look back at greetUser.php, you’ll see that it creates an  entire XHTML page. Most PHP programs work that way, creating an entire  page every time. However, because you’re using AJAX, the PHP result doesn’t  have to be an entire Web page. The PHP can simply create a small snippet of  HTML.  Take a look at simpleGreet.php and you’ll see it’s very stripped down:    <?php   $userName = $_REQUEST[“userName”];   print “ Hi, $userName!  “;   ?>   354 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX   Although this program works just like greetUser.php, it’s a lot simpler.  All it needs to do is grab the user name and print it back out. The JavaScript  function takes care of making the code go in the right place. Without AJAX,  each PHP program has to re-create the entire page. When you’re using AJAX,  the HTML page stays on the client, and JavaScript makes smaller calls to the  server. The PHP is simpler, and the code transmission is generally smaller  and faster, because there’s less repeated structural information.  Working with XML Data  Server-side work normally involves storage of data, as that’s one thing that’s  easy to do on the server and difficult to do on the client. Data can be stored  in many ways: plain text files, HTML, or XHTML, or in a specialized system  called a relational database  a specialized program that allows you to store  and query data efficiently . The database approach is most common because  it’s incredibly powerful and flexible. Normally programmers use a PHP pro- gram to request information from a Web page, and then use this informa- tion to prepare a request for the database in a special language called SQL   Structured Query Language . The data request is passed to the database  management system, which returns some kind of result set to the PHP pro- gram. The PHP program then typically builds an HTML page and passes the  page back to the browser.    Data management is beyond the scope of this book. See my Web site for more   information about creating your own databases: www.aharrisbooks.net.  The process can be easier when you use AJAX because the PHP program  doesn’t have to create an entire Web page. All that really needs to be passed  back to the JavaScript program are the results of the data query. Normally,  you do this using a special data format so the JavaScript program can easily  manage the data.  Review of XML  The XML format has become an important tool for encapsulating data for  transfer between the client and the server. If you’re using XHTML, you are  already familiar with XML. XHTML is simply HTML following the stricter XML  standard.   However, XML is much more than XHTML. It can actually be used to store  any kind of data. For example, take a look at the following file  pets.xml :    Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  355               cat       Lucy       American Shorthair       She raised me               cat       Homer       unknown       Named after a world-famous bassoonist               dog       Muchacha       mutt       One of the ugliest dogs I’ve ever met         If you look over pets.xml, you can see it looks a lot like HTML. HTML  XHTML tags are very specific  only a few are legal  but XML tags can be any- thing as long as they follow a few simple  but familiar  rules:  1.  Begin with a doctype.    Formal XML declarations often have doctypes as complex as the XHTML  doctype definition, but basic XML data usually uses a much simpler  definition:          Any time you make your own XML format  as I’m doing in this example ,  you can use this generic doctype.   2.  Create a container for all elements.    The entire structure must have one container tag. I’m using pets as my  container. If you don’t have a single container, your programs will often  have trouble reading the XML data.  3.  Build your basic data nodes.    In my simple example, each pet is contained inside a pet node. Each pet  has the same data elements  but that isn’t a requirement .  4.  Tags are case-sensitive.    Be consistent in your tag names. Use camel case and single words for  each element.                       356 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX             5.  You can add attributes.    You can add attributes to your XML elements just like the ones in  XHTML. As in XHTML, attributes are name value pairs separated by an  equal sign  = , and the value must always be encased in quotes.  6.  Nest elements as in XHTML.    Be careful to carefully nest elements inside each other like you do with  XHTML.  You can get an XML file in a number of ways. Most databases can export data  in XML format. More often, a PHP program reads data from a database and  creates a long string of XML for output. For this simple introduction, I just  wrote the XML file in a text editor and saved it as a file.  You can manipulate XML in the same way with JavaScript whether it comes  directly from a file or is passed from a PHP program.  Manipulating XML with jQuery  XML data is actually familiar because you can use the tools you used to work  with XHTML. Better, the jQuery functions normally used to extract elements  from an XHTML page work on XML data with few changes. You can use all the  standard jQuery selectors and tools to manage an XML file in the same way  you use them to manage parts of an HTML page.  The readXML.html page featured in Figure 14-5 shows a JavaScript jQuery  program that reads the pets.xml file and does something interesting with  the data. In this case, it extracts all the pet names and puts them in an unor- dered list.  See the following code.   Figure 14-5:  The pet  names  came from  the XML file.

This one is especially simple: a heading and a list. The list  has an id attribute  so it can be recognized through jQuery easily  and a  single element  which will be replaced by data from the XML file .  Retrieving the data  The init   function sets up an AJAX request:       $ init ;      function init  {       $.get “pets.xml”, processResult ;     }    end init  This function uses the get   function to request data:                 1.  Use the jQuery get   mechanism to set up the request.     Because I’m just requesting a static file  as opposed to a PHP program ,  the get   function is the best AJAX tool to use for setting up the  request.  2.  Specify the file or program.    Normally you call a PHP program to retrieve data, but for this example,  I pull data straight from the pets.xml file. The get   mechanism can  be used to retrieve plain text, HTML, or XML data. My program will be  expecting XML data, so I should call an XML file or a program that pro- duces XML output.  3.  Set up a callback function.    When the AJAX is complete, specify a function to call. My example calls  the processResult function after the AJAX transmission is complete.  Processing the results  The processResult   function accepts two parameters: data and  textStatus.     Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  359                              function processResult data, textStatus {         clear the output       $ “output” .html “” ;         find the pet nodes...       $ data .find “pet” .each printPetName ;      }    end processResult  The processResult   function does a few simple tasks:  1.  Clear the output ul.    The output element is an unordered list  ul . Use its html   method  to clear the default list item.  2.  Make a jQuery node from the data.    The data  passed as a parameter  can be turned into a jQuery node. Use  $ data  for this process.  3.  Find each pet node.    Use the find   method to identify the pet nodes within the data.  4.  Specify a command to operate on each element.    Use the each   method to specify you want to apply a function sepa- rately to each of the pet elements. Essentially, this creates a loop that  calls the function once per element. The each mechanism is an example  of a concept called functional programming.  Drop that little gem at your  next computer science function.   5.  Run the printPetName function once for each element.    The printPetName is a callback function.   Printing out the pet name  The printPetName function will be called once for each pet element in the  XML data. Within the function, the $ this  element refers to the current ele- ment as a jQuery node.      function printPetName  {         isolate the name text of the current node       thePet = $ this .find “name” .text  ;          add list item elements around it       thePet = “ ” + thePet + “ ”;          add item to the list       $ “output” .append thePet ;     }    end printPetName   360 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                             Working with JSON Data  1.  Retrieve the pet’s name.    Use the find   method to find the name element of the current pet  node.  2.  Pull the text from the node.    The name is still a jQuery object. To find the actual text, use the text    method.  3.  Turn the text into a list item.    I just used string concatenation to convert the plain text of the pet name  into a list item.  4.  Append the pet name list item to the list.    The append   method is perfect for this task.  Of course, you can do more complex things with the data, but it’s just a  matter of using jQuery to extract the data you want and then turning it into  HTML output.   A new data format called JSON is becoming increasingly important. In fact,  some are suggesting that JSON will replace XML as the standard data trans- mission format for AJAX.   XML has been considered the standard way of working with data in AJAX  in  fact, the X in AJAX stands for XML.  Although XML is easy for humans  and  computer programs  to read, it’s a little verbose. All those ending tags can  get a bit tedious and can add unnecessarily to the file size of the data block.  Although XML isn’t difficult to work with on the client, it does take some get- ting used to.  Understanding JSON  AJAX programmers are beginning to turn to JSON  JavaScript Object  Notation  as a data transfer mechanism. JSON is nothing more than the  JavaScript object notation described in Chapter 5 and used throughout this  book. JSON has a number of very interesting advantages:  ✓ Data is sent in plain text. Like XML, JSON data can be sent in a plain text   format that’s easy to transmit, read and interpret.  ✓ The data is already usable. Client programs are usually written in   JavaScript. Because the data is already in a JavaScript format, it’s ready  to use immediately, without the manipulation required by XML.    Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  361                       ✓ The data is a bit more compact than XML. JavaScript notation doesn’t   have ending tags, so it’s a bit smaller. It can also be written to save even  more space  at the cost of some readability  if needed.  ✓ Lots of languages can use it. Any language can send JSON data as a long  string of text. You can then apply the JavaScript eval   function on the  JSON data to turn it into a variable.  ✓ PHP now has native support for JSON. PHP version 5.2 and later sup-  ports the json_encode   function, which automatically converts a  PHP array  even a very complex one  into a JSON object.  ✓ jQuery has a getJSON   method. This method works like the get   or   post   methods, but it’s optimized to receive a JSON value.     If a program uses the eval   function to turn a result string to a JSON  object, there’s a potential security hazard: Any code in the string is treated  as JavaScript code, so bad guys could sneak some ugly code in there. Be sure  you trust whoever is providing you the JSON data.    The pet data described in pets.xml looks like this when it’s organized as a  JSON variable:  {   “Lucy”: { “animal”: “Cat”,             “breed”: “American Shorthair”,             “note”: “She raised me”},   “Homer”: { “animal”: “Cat”,             “breed”: “unknown”,             “note”: “Named after a world-famous   bassoonist”},    “Muchacha”: { “animal”: “Dog”,            “breed”: “mutt”,            “note”: “One of the ugliest dogs I’ve ever   met”}  }  Note that the data is a bit more compact in JSON format than it is in XML.  Also, note that there’s no need for an overarching variable type  like pets  in the XML data  because the entire entity is one variable  most likely called  pets . JSON takes advantages of JavaScript’s flexibility when it comes to  objects:  1.  An object is encased in braces  {} .    The main object is denoted by a pair of braces.  2.  The object consists of key value pairs.    In my data, I used the animal name as the node key. Note that the key is  a string value.   362 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX             3.  The contents of a node can be another node.     Each animal contains another JSON object, which holds the data about  that animal. You can nest JSON nodes  like XML nodes , so they have  the potential for complex data structures. 4.  The entire element is one big variable.     JavaScript will see the entire element as one big JavaScript object that  can be stored in a single variable. This makes it quite easy to work with  JSON objects on the client.   Reading JSON data with jQuery  As you might expect, jQuery has some features for simplifying the  already  easy  process of managing JSON data.   Figure 14-6 shows readJSON.html, a program that reads JSON data and  returns the results in a nice format.  Figure 14-6:  This pro- gram got the  data from  a JSON  request.         Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  363  Here’s the complete code of readJSON.html:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”> <html lang=”EN” dir=”ltr” xmlns=”http:  www.w3.org 1999   xhtml”>      <meta http-equiv=»content-type» content=»text xml;   charset=utf-8»  >         dt {       font-weight: bold;       float: left;       width: 5em;       margin-left: 1em;       clear: left;     }           <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>                  <![CDATA[      $ init ;          function init  {       $.getJSON «pets.json», processResult ;     }    end init          function processResult data {       $ «output» .text «» ;       for petName in data {         var pet = data[petName];         $ «output» .append « » + petName + « » ;         $ «output» .append « » ;         for  detail in pet {           $ «output» .append «   » + detail +   « » ;            $ «output» .append «   » + pet[detail] +   « » ;         }    end for         $ «output» .append « » ;                }    end for     }    end processResults            ]]>             readJSON.html      364 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX      Reading JSON      This is the default output         Managing the framework  The foundation of this program is the standard XTML and CSS. Here are the  details:  1.  Build a basic XHTML page.     Much of the work happens in JavaScript, so an h1 and an output div  are all you really need.  2.  Put default text in the output div.     Put some kind of text in the output div. If the AJAX doesn’t work, you  see this text. If the AJAX does work, the contents of the output div are  replaced by a definition list.  3.  Add CSS for a definition list.    I will print out each pet’s information as a definition list, but I don’t like the  default formatting for  . I add my own CSS to tighten up the appearance  of the definitions.  I like the   and   on the same line of output.   Retrieving the JSON data  The jQuery library has a special AJAX function for retrieving JSON data. The  getJSON   function makes an AJAX call and expects JSON data in return.       $ init ;          function init  {       $.getJSON “pets.json”, processResult ;     }    end init  It isn’t difficult to get JSON data with jQuery:  1.  Set up the standard init   function.     In this example, I’m pulling the JSON data in as soon as the page has  finished loading.                        Chapter 14: Working with AJAX Data  365                          2.  Use the getJSON   function.     This tool gets JSON data from the server.  3.  Pull data from pets.json.    Normally you make a request to a PHP program, which does some kind  of database request and returns the results as a JSON object. For this  simple example, I’m just grabbing data from a JSON file I wrote with a  text editor.  4.  Specify a callback function.    Like most AJAX methods, getJSON   allows you to specify a callback  function that is triggered when the data has finished transferring to the  client.  Processing the results  The data returned by a JSON request is already in a valid JavaScript format,  so all you need is some for loops to extract the data. Here’s the process:      function processResult data {       $ “output” .text “” ;       for petName in data {         var pet = data[petName];         $ “output” .append “ ” + petName + “ ” ;         $ “output” .append “ ” ;         for  detail in pet {           $ “output” .append “   ” + detail +   “ ” ;            $ “output” .append “   ” + pet[detail] +   “ ” ;         }    end for         $ “output” .append “ ” ;                }    end for     }    end processResults  1.  Create the callback function.    This function expects a data parameter  like most AJAX requests . In  this case, the data object will contain a complete JSON object encapsu- lating all the data from the request.  2.  Clear the output.     I will replace the output with a series of definition lists.  $ “output” .text “” ;   366 Part III: Moving Up to AJAX                                           3.  Step through each petName in the list.    This special form of for loop finds each element in a list. In this case, it  gets each pet name found in the data element.  for petName in data {  4.  Extract the pet as a variable.    The special form of for loop doesn’t actually retrieve the pets, but the  key associated with each pet. Use that pet name to find a pet and make  it into a variable using an array lookup.  var pet = data[petName];  5.  Build a heading with the pet’s name.    Surround the pet name with   tags to make a heading and append  this to the output.  $ “output” .append “ ” + petName + “ ” ;  6.  Create a definition list for each pet.    Begin the list with a   tag. Of course, you can use whichever format- ting you prefer, but I like the definition list for this kind of name value  data.  $ “output” .append “ ” ;  7.  Get the detail names from the pet.    The pet is itself a JSON object, so use another for loop to extract each  of its detail names  animal, breed, and note .   for  detail in pet {  8.  Set the detail name as the definition term.    Surround each detail name with a    pair.  $ “output” .append “   ” + detail + “ ” ;  9.  Surround the definition value with   .    This step provides appropriate formatting to the definition value.  $ “output” .append “   ” + pet[detail] + “ ” ;  10.  Close up the definition list.     After the inner for loop is complete, you’re done describing one pet, so  close up the definition list.  $ “output” .append “   ” + pet[detail] + “ ” ;  As you can see, JSON is pretty easy to work with, so it’s becoming much  more common as a data transfer mechanism.   Part IV  The Part of Tens   In this part . . .  The Part of Tens feature is a staple of For Dummies   books, but I’ve saved some of the best treats for   the end.  Chapter 15 highlights a number of jQuery plugins. These  tools add incredible features to JavaScript, like the ability  to automatically translate your page to a foreign language,  image galleries, graphing plugins, and much more.  Chapter 16 lists a number of other great places to get fur- ther information. Learn about other libraries, online com- munities, and great reference sites.   Chapter 15  Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins The jQuery library is amazing enough on its own, but it has yet another   wonderful surprise up its sleeve: a marvelous plugin interface that makes   new plugins or extensions to the library easy to add.   The plugins do many things, from changing the way your page looks to  including audio and simplifying certain AJAX calls. This chapter contains a  sampling of jQuery plugins I’ve found useful, but there are many more avail- able at the jQuery main site  http:  plugins.jquery.com  .  Using the Plugins                      Each plugin is different, but the general approach to using them is the same:  1.  Visit the appropriate Web page.    Check the jQuery main site for a list of jQuery plugins  http:   plugins.jquery.com . You can download each plugin from the  jQuery site or get a link to the plugin’s home page, where you’ll gener- ally find more complete help information.  2.  Download the plugin.    Most plugins are simply JavaScript files. Often other support material is  available as well, including documentation, CSS files, and examples. Be  sure to install the files you need in the working directory.  3.  Create a basic XHTML page.    Check the documentation to see what elements you need. Most jQuery  plugins modify or replace some existing element in the Web page.  4.  Add an init   function.    Most jQuery functions  including plugins  require some sort of initializa- tion function.   370 Part IV: The Part of Tens             5.  Call the appropriate jQuery function.    Most plugins just add new functions to jQuery. For the most part, you’ll  apply these functions to jQuery nodes just as you would for a normal  use of jQuery.  6.  Customize.    In this introduction, I tend to show the most basic form of each plugin  for simplicity’s sake. Be sure to check the documentation for each plugin  to see how you can customize it; many plugins do far more than I have  the space to show you in this chapter.     I’ve tended to include the simpler and more representative plugins in this  chapter. I’ve omitted a number of especially useful plugins because they either  require a special license  as the Google Maps plugin does  or require support  for a database or PHP  as many of the cooler AJAX plugins do . Spend some  time at http:  plugins.jquery.com  to see the astonishing variety of  plugins available.  ipwEditor  One very popular AJAX technique is to make a portion of the Web page edit- able. The ipwEditor plugin  www.spacebug.com IPWEditor_In-Place_ WYSIWYG_Editor  combines two different approaches to this issue, making  it easy to turn ordinary pages into a simple content management system.  First, take a look at the editable plugin  included with ipwedit or avail- able on its own .  Adding a basic editor with editable  First, take a look at a very basic editor in Figure 15-1.  When you click the paragraph, it turns into an editable text area. The user  can place her own text or HTML in the area and click the Done button to save  the text. See Figure 15-2 for the editor in action.  The changes made are not permanent, but you could easily add an AJAX  function to send the new data to a server-side script to make a permanent  change to the page.     You obviously don’t want to allow just anybody to make page changes. You’ll   probably want to have some sort of login system to ensure that only autho- rized people get access to the version of the page with editing enabled.    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  371    Click here to see the hidden feature.  Figure 15-1:  This page  has a hid- den feature.   Figure 15-2:  The editor  automati- cally pops  up and lets  the user  change the  page.          <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>                    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.editable.wysiwyg-1.3.3.1.js»>            <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {                create the simple editor       $ «basicEdit» .editable {submit: ‘done’} ;     }         372 Part IV: The Part of Tens         ]]>             basicEditor.html       Basic Editing Demo    Basic Edit    Click me for a basic edit                             Here’s what you do to incorporate the simple editor:  1.  Include the jquery.editable or jquery.editable.wysiwyg script.    All the functionality you need for this example is provided in the  jquery.editable plugin. However, the jquery.editable.wysiwyg  plugin includes both this script and the more elaborate wysiwyg editor  as well.  2.  Create an HTML area to edit.    In this example, I edit a div called basicEdit. In a production example,  you might make each div or paragraph editable.  3.  Apply the editable function.    After the editable plugin is available, you can simply apply the  editable function to all the jQuery elements you want to have editable  behavior.  4.  Specify the button text.    The second parameter of the plugin is the text that will go on the sup- plied button.    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  373       5.  Save the data.    This particular example does nothing with the changed text, so it has  limited functionality. In a production version of the program, you’ll  probably write some sort of AJAX code to package up all the new text  and send it to a server-side program for processing and saving.  Incorporating more advanced  editing with FCKedit  The ipwEditor includes the simple plugin  called the jquery editable plugin   and a second more sophisticated plugin. This second plugin allows a much  more sophisticated editor to appear, with a word-processor-like user inter- face. If you’ve played around with content management systems, the chances  are you’ve seen this interface, shown in Figure 15-3.   Figure 15-3:  Now the  page has  two editable  areas.       This example keeps the basic editor, but if you click the second paragraph, a  much more elaborate editor appears, shown in Figure 15-4.   374 Part IV: The Part of Tens   Figure 15-4:  This editor  looks a lot  like a word  processor.       The wysiwyg plugin adds the functionality of another very popular library  called FCKedit  www.fckeditor.net  . This popular editor is used in many  content management systems, and it’s quite powerful and easy to modify.  The FCKedit library is included with the ipwEditor plugin. The editable. wysiwyg plugin makes it easy to add FCKedit to your pages. Here’s the code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>                    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.editable.wysiwyg-1.3.3.1.js»>    <script type=»text javascript»            src=»fckeditor fckeditor.js»>               <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  375          create an instance of fckeditor  only needed for wysiwyg version               var myFCKeditor = new FCKeditor ‘editor’ ;       myFCKeditor.BasePath = «. fckeditor »;                create the simple editor       $ «basicEdit» .editable {submit: ‘done’} ;                set up the wysiwyg version       $ «wysiwygEdit» .editable          {type: «wysiwyg»,          editor: myFCKeditor,          onSubmit: finished,          submit: «done»         } ;                 }    end init          function finished content {       alert content.current ;     }    end finished            ]]>             editor.html       In-Place Editing Demo    Basic Edit    Click me for a basic edit     WYSIWYG Edit    Click me to edit with a complete editor         This code is a bit more elaborate than the standard editable plugin,  because it requires initialization of the  included  fckEdit library. Here’s how  it works:       1.  Be sure to have the fckeditor folder in your working directory.   This library is included with the jquery.editable.wysiwyg  download.   376 Part IV: The Part of Tens                                               2.  Build a Web page with editable areas.    Build your XHTML page as normal, considering which segments you  want editable.  3.  Include the fckeditor script.    The fckeditor script is a js file available in the fckeditor folder.  Include this script so your page will have access to the editor.  4.  Create an instance of the fckeditor class.    In your initialization function, create a single fckeditor variable. This  will initialize fckeditor.  5.  Indicate the fckeditor base path.    This helps fckeditor find all its helper files in the subdirectory.  6.  Apply the editable function to any elements you want to make   editable.   This process works exactly the same as the basic editable plugin.  7.  Set the type to wysiwyg.    The wysiwyg version of the editable plugin adds the capability to  change your editor type.  8.  Apply the editor.    Set the editor parameter to the fckeditor variable you created in  Step 4.  9.  Set the text of the Submit button.    As in the simpler editable area, a Submit button appears automati- cally. Set the text of this button with this parameter.  10.  Set a callback function if you want.    You can apply a callback function to editable objects; it indicates a func- tion to send after submission is complete. Usually this function does  some error-checking and then sends the new contents to a server-side  script via AJAX. My version just displays the new contents.  The results of any edit are still HTML, which is ultimately plain text. You  should be cautious with any changes you allow the user to make, because  malicious users can cause you some major headaches.   jQuery Cookies  Cookies are a useful Web tool, even if they are somewhat misunderstood. A  cookie is a simple text message that can be stored and received on the client     Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  377                 by either the client or server programs. The type of data is severely limited,  but this can still be a very useful tool:  ✓ Each cookie is a name   value pair: You can think of a cookie as a vari-  able you can save on the client.  ✓ Cookies are simply text data: If you want another kind of data, convert   it to text for storage.  ✓ Cookies are saved in a large text file: Different browsers have different  mechanisms, but in essence all the cookies saved by a particular user on  a particular browser are saved in one text file.  ✓ Cookies have size limits: It’s not appropriate to store  for example  an   entire database in a cookie. It’s more common to keep login status so  the system can make a request to a server-side database.  ✓ Cookies are mainly used to store state data: The most common use of  cookies is to keep track of a user’s status with the application. Usually  the server does all the heavy lifting.  Managing cookies is not difficult, but it’s made even easier by a couple of  tools. There’s an amazing plugin called jquery.cookies  http:  code. google.com p cookies  , which makes this job extremely painless.   Take a look at the code for cookies.html, which uses this plugin:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>                   <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.cookies.2.1.0.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $.cookies.set «myCookie», «Hi there!» ;       $ «output» .html $.cookies.get «myCookie»  ;     }       ]]>             cookies.html        378 Part IV: The Part of Tens    jQuery cookies Demo     default content         The process is painless:  1.  Include the jquery.cookies script.    As always, include jQuery and the script for this plugin.  2.  Use the $.cookies function to manage cookies.    This function encapsulates the content of the cookies library. 3.  Use $.cookies.set   to create a cookie and set its value.    If the cookie does not exist, it is created, and the specified value is  added to the cookie.  4.  Use $.cookies.get   to retrieve the value of the cookie.    The get   function is an easy way to retrieve data from a cookie.  5.  Look over the documentation for more options.    The cookies library has more features — including the capability to  check whether the browser is accepting cookies, to determine whether a  cookie exists, to delete cookies, and more.     I didn’t provide a screen shot for this program, because all the interesting  stuff happens under the hood. Take a look at cookies.html on the Web page  for the book to see it in action.                        flot  Sometimes your Web pages need to display some kind of data. You can use  any of various powerful graphing plugins for that purpose. One easy and  powerful option is called flot, available at http:  code.google.com p  flot . Figure 15-5 shows this tool in action.  To build a graph with flot, you’ll need to have a data set available. I just  made up a data set in this simple example, but often you’ll pull data from a  database or other application. Look over the code first:    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  379  Figure 15-5:  This chart  was created  automati- cally with  a jQuery  plugin.       <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>                 simpleChart{       height: 300px;       width: 600px;     }       <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = “jquery.flot.js”>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       var myData = {         data: [[1,10], [2,12], [3,9], [4, 14], [5, 13]],         color: «red»       };       $.plot $ «simpleChart» , [myData] ;     }       ]]>             flot.html      380 Part IV: The Part of Tens      flot charting demo           Here’s the general process:  1.  Import the libraries.                                      It won’t surprise you that you need jQuery. You’ll also need to bring  in the jquery.flot script. Note that flot also includes some other  scripts, which you’ll need to make available  notably excanvas, which  simulates the   tag on IE browsers .  2.  Build your page.    As usual, the page doesn’t require a lot. Just add an empty div that will  become your chart.  3.  Generate the data.    The data sets in flot are jQuery objects. Each object must have some  data, but it can also have other attributes.  4.  Note that the data itself is a 2D array.    Each data point is an array of two integers, and the data set is an array  of these objects.  5.  You can also specify the color and other attributes for the data.    See the flot documentation for many more attributes you can modify.  6.  Use the $.plot   function to draw the graph.    Note that the syntax is not exactly what you’ve used before. Use the  jQuery $.plot   function to draw a plot on a particular jQuery node.  7.  Add as many data sets as you want.    My example has only one data set, but the plot   function expects an  array of data ranges, so you can add more if you wish.  As you might guess, the flot plugin features many more incredible effects.  Tag Cloud  In recent years it has become popular to offer data visualizations, or ways  to illustrate data. One such mechanism is the tag cloud. Essentially this tool  places a number of words in semi-random positions. In a typical tag cloud,  the position, size, and color of the words are used to represent the relative     Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  381  strength and relationship of the terms. See Figure 15-6 for a simple example  of a tag cloud. Here the text was originally in an unordered list. The tag cloud  changes the size and darkness of each element based on a ranking value.  Figure 15-6:  This tag  cloud fea- tures the  main topics  of this book.       The jquery tagcloud plugin  http:  code.google.com p jquery- tagcloud   makes it quite easy to build your own basic tag clouds. Here’s  the code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>           <link rel = “stylesheet”         type = “text css”         href = “jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css”  >            <script type = “text javascript”           src = “jquery-1.3.2.min.js”>    <script type = “text javascript”           src = “jquery.tagcloud.min.js”>    <script type = “text javascript”           src = “jquery.tinysort.min.js”>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ “techList” .tagcloud {height: 100,                                 width: 100}        .css “width”, “200px” ;     }       ]]>             tagCloud.html    382 Part IV: The Part of Tens   head>    Tag Cloud Demo        HTML     XHTML     CSS     JavaScript     DOM     AJAX     PHP     MySQL                                A tag cloud is a pretty fun element to build:  1.  Import the libraries.  2.  Build a list.    You’ll need the jquery and jquery.tagcloud scripts.    The tagcloud library works on ordered lists and unordered lists.  3.  Add numeric values to list items if you wish.    If you want the elements to have different weights, add a value attri- bute to each. Those with small values will be very lightly colored and  show up in a very small font size. Larger values will be darker colors and  have larger fonts.  4.  Add the tagcloud   function to the ul with jQuery.    Use the standard mechanism to transform the jQuery node based on the  ul into a tag cloud.  Note that the value attribute is not standard XHTML, so your page will no  longer validate as strict XHTML. Most of the time, the value will be assigned  through JavaScript code.  For example, count the number of times a word  appears in a document and use that as the term’s value.  Because primary  validation happens before the code executes, you won’t see any validation  problems.     Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  383  Tablesorter  AJAX programs often involve retrieving data, which is frequently displayed  in an HTML table. The tablesorter plugin  http:  tablesorter.com  docs   allows the user to sort a table easily by clicking a heading. The top  part of Figure 15-7 shows a standard HTML table. When the user clicks the  “first name” header, the table is sorted by first names alphabetically, as  shown in the bottom part of Figure 15-7.  Figure 15-7:  Here is a  basic table.       Click the “first name” header again to sort by first name in inverse order.  The default behavior of the tablesorter plugin allows you to sort by any  header field. Here’s the code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>           <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»   384 Part IV: The Part of Tens           href = «jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.css»  >            <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.tablesorter.min.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ «myTable» .tablesorter  ;     }       ]]>             tablesorter.html       Table Sorter Demo   <table id = “myTable”         border = “1”>                  last name         first name                                Fred         Flintstone                      Barney         Rubble                      Scooby         Doo                      George         Jetson     Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  385                                              The process is standard jQuery magic:  1.  Import jquery and the jquery.tablesorter scripts.    The tablesorter plugin can also work with the jQuery UI for better- looking tables. 2.  Build a table.    The plugin requires that your table headings be surrounded by a     pair and the body be surrounded by    . Otherwise you can build your table however you like.  3.  Add tablesorter   to the table’s jQuery node.    In the init   function, just specify the table as a tablesorter node,  and you’re ready to go.  The tablesorter plugin has dozens of options that make it a real power- house. Check the official documentation at http:  tablesorter.com  docs .  Note that a form of tablesorter was previously included in the jQuery UI,  but now it’s a separate plugin.  Jquery-translate  The jQuery translate plugin  http:  code.google.com p jquery- translate   is an incredibly useful tool for language translation. Take a  look at the basic page shown in the top half of Figure 15-8. When the user  clicks the paragraph, watch what happens  see the bottom half of Figure 15-8 .   386 Part IV: The Part of Tens   Figure 15-8:  The user  can change  this para- graph from  English to  Spanish!       The translate plugin connects to the Google language API and automati- cally translates the text of its node to one of several languages. The code that  does the trick looks like this:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>                    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.translate-1.3.9.min.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ «contents» .bind «click», translate ;     }    end init          function translate  {       $ «contents» .translate «Spanish» ;    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  387      }    end translate            ]]>             translate.html       Translate Demo     This div contains some text in English. Click it to change it to  Spanish.         Considering how powerful this trick can be, it’s almost embarrassingly easy  to do:  1.  Include the jquery and jquery.translate scripts.    As usual, this program uses jQuery and an additional plugin to perform  its magic.  2.  Create content to translate.    The translate API can only handle a limited number of characters at a  time, so don’t try to translate the entire page in one pass. Instead, send  smaller chunks  such as a div or paragraph . In this example, I’m trans- lating only one div.  3.  Bind the click event to your elements.    In this example, I want my div to begin in English and switch to Spanish  when the user clicks it. I bind the click event to a function called  translate  .  4.  The translate   function calls the language API, sending the   contents.   You can determine the original language as well as the translated lan- guage. Dozens of languages are available. The contents of the div are  replaced with translated text.    Machine-generated translation only goes so far. Often the general intent of the   message will be discernable, but the translation will not be nearly as reliable  as a human translation. The API has a particularly difficult time with colloqui- alism and technical language.                        388 Part IV: The Part of Tens   Droppy  This plugin has many useful parameters. Check the documentation at  http:  code.google.com p jquery-translate  and experiment!  Drop-down menus have become an important usability tool in Web sites.  There are hundreds of jQuery plugins to handle this feature. I like droppy   http:  onehackoranother.com projects jquery droppy   because  it’s very easy to use.  Figure 15-9 shows a simple version of droppy in action.  Figure 15-9:  The droppy  plugin turns  a list of links  into a nice  menu.       Most navigation systems are ultimately nested lists of links. The droppy  plugin simply takes an unordered list with a bunch of links  nested as deeply  as you want  and turns it into a nicely formatted drop-down menu. Take a  look at the code:    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  389  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>           <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»         href = «droppy.css»  >            <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.droppy.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ «nav» .droppy  ;           }       ]]>             droppy.html       Droppy drop-down menu demo         English                One           Two           Three                Japanese               Ichi           Ni           San                   - lorem ipsum filler text deleted for space -          390 Part IV: The Part of Tens                                     The general process should be familiar to you by now, but here it is anyway:  1.  Include the necessary scripts.    This plugin requires jquery.js and jquery.droppy.js. It also  requires an  included  CSS file called droppy.css.   2.  Create an unordered list for navigation.    In your HTML code, place the unordered list where you want the menu  to be  typically this will be at the top of your page; droppy creates hori- zontal menus.    3.  Make each top-level element an anchor.    The droppy plugin uses the anchor    tags for formatting, so  make sure the top-level elements  in my example, the language names   are embedded in anchors. It doesn’t matter where the anchor goes, so  set the anchor to link back to the page with the  character.  4.  Make each interior element a link as well.    Typically the interior elements will be links to other places in your  system  or external pages . In my example, I made them empty links, but  the important thing is that they contain link elements.  5.  Be sure your lists validate.    If you’re sloppy with your nested lists, the plugin will have a hard time  figuring out what you’re trying to accomplish, and will probably fail.  6.  Build another level of menus if you like.    You can build the navigation structure as deep as you want.  7.  Modify the CSS for customization.    You can change the droppy.css file to make the menus fit your needs  more closely. The most common changes are colors and fonts, to fit the  overall look of the site where the menu will be installed.   galleria  Image galleries are another very popular plugin topic. There are many image  galleries available to play with. I’m demonstrating galleria  http:   devkick.com lab galleria   because it’s popular, powerful, and doesn’t  require any server-side scripting. Figure 15-10 shows this beautiful tool in  action.    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  391  Figure 15-10:  The galleria  plugin auto- matically  turns a list  of images  into a  gallery.                         The default image gallery has some great features:  ✓ Images are pre-loaded. Each image is loaded into memory when the   page initializes, so there will be no delay when the user switches  between images.  ✓ The galleria tool automatically creates thumbnail images. The   smaller index  thumbnail  images are automatically created and added  to the page.  ✓ Clicking a thumbnail expands it into the viewing area. The larger view-  ing area contains a larger version of the current image.  ✓ Click the viewing area to view the next image. The default behavior   lets you easily cycle through images with mouse clicks.  ✓ The output is based on CSS. Use the included CSS file to manage the   display of your page, including how and where the thumbnails go, how  large the display image is, and more.  ✓ It has many options. The galleria plugin is very customizable. It fea-  tures many advanced options. Check the documentation for more.   392 Part IV: The Part of Tens   My favorite part of the galleria plugin is how easy it is to use. Take a look  at the code:  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>               body {     color: white;     background-color: black;   }          <link rel = «stylesheet»         type = «text css»         href = «galleria.css»  >            <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.galleria.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ «ul.gallery» .galleria  ;     }       ]]>             galleria.html       Galleria Image Viewer Demo                                       Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  393  Using galleria is much like any other jQuery plugin. Add the appropriate  scripts, write some basic HTML, and add a magical jQuery node:  1.  Import the scripts.    You’ll need jquery as always, as well as jquery.galleria and the  galleria.css CSS stylesheet.  2.  Create a list of images.    Make each list item an image.  3.  Add the galleria   node to the list.    That’s really all you need to do!  4.  Play with the options.    Look over the documentation for some great options, including the abil- ity to use custom thumbnails, specify your own output container, and  run callback functions when the user selects an image or thumbnail.                    Jmp3  The Web has become a phenomenal multimedia experience, but some impor- tant tools are missing. HTML 5 promises  at long last  an audio tag that will  allow you to add audio directly to Web pages. Integrating audio  and other  multimedia elements  into Web pages has been very complex so far. Most  pages use some sort of plugin technology  such as Flash or various media  players . The jmp3 plugin  www.sean-o.com jquery jmp3   is a wonder- ful compromise. It uses a very small Flash component  pre-built — you don’t  need to know anything about Flash  to load an audio file you specify and  place that file in your page.  Figure 15-11 illustrates a page with an mp3 file embedded in it.  The mp3 files are actually played by a small Flash program, which you can  configure in a number of ways — setting the colors and width, and determin- ing whether the player includes a Download button. Take a look at the code  to see how it works:   394 Part IV: The Part of Tens   Figure 15-11:  This page  has an  attractive  and func- tional MP3  player.       <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-  W3C  DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict  EN” “http:  www.w3.org TR xhtml1 DTD xhtml1-strict.dtd”>                    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery-1.3.2.min.js»>    <script type = «text javascript»           src = «jquery.jmp3.js»>                <![CDATA[      $ init ;      function init  {       $ «song» .jmp3  ;             $ «external» .jmp3 {         filepath: «http:  www.aharrisbooks.net jad »,         backcolor: «000066»,         forecolor: «ffffff»,         showdownload: «true»,         width: 300    Chapter 15: Ten Amazing jQuery Plugins  395        } ;     }    end init       ]]>             jmp3.html       jmp3 Demo        Do You Know Him.mp3          This song was written and performed by a friend of mine - Daniel Rassum.     He’s earned the right to sing the blues - He sings about hard life and      redemption.  If you like this song, I encourage you to check out his      album at  www.      It’s a «free trade» music site where you pay what you think is fair for an   noisetrade.com .   artist’s work.         External link version       Do You Know Him.mp3           Using jmp3 follows a familiar pattern:  1.  Include the necessary files.                   jmp3 uses jquery and jquery.jmp3. It also requires the  included   singlemp3player.swf file be available in the working directory. It’s  easiest if the mp3 files are also in the current directory, but not  absolutely necessary.  2.  Create elements containing the file name.    The plugin uses the text of the element to determine the song file. The  node can contain nothing except the filename of the mp3 file. Be sure to  use appropriate capitalization.  3.  Apply the jmp3   method to appropriate elements.    Apply the jmp3   method to jquery nodes that contain the mp3 file.   It’s perfectly feasible to apply this method to an entire class, as the  filename is determined by the contents of the element rather than a  jquery parameter.    396 Part IV: The Part of Tens   4.  Add any parameters you prefer.    You can add parameters by attaching a JSON object to the jmp3   call.  5.  Change colors.  6.  Set the width.    You can specify foreground and background colors  but note the non- standard color syntax: forecolor instead of color, and no  symbol  on color numbers .     You can also determine the width of the Flash element. Non-default  widths will also include a small scrubber so the user can find a particu- lar part of the song.  7.  Specify a file path.    The filepath parameter allows you to link to a file on a remote server.  Be sure you have the permission of the file owner to do this. When the  user plays the file, the Flash player will begin a progressive download  of the file and begin playing as soon as a sufficient fraction of the file is  available.  8.  Allow downloads.    The showdownload feature allows you to add a small widget to the  Flash player. If the user clicks this button, she is given the option to save  the mp3 file.    As always, ensure you have the rights to distribute the file before using  this option.                                 Chapter 16  Ten Great Resources  JavaScript and AJAX are phenomenal tools, but one of the most interesting    and frustrating  aspects of Web development is how fast it’s changing —   and how much there is to learn. Here’s a list of ten interesting resources for  further exploration. Some are reference sites; some are other libraries and  frameworks you may want to investigate. All are resources I think you might  enjoy.  Have fun!  jQuery PHP library  http:  jquery.hohli.com   Very frequently you’ll write AJAX code with a server-side language, often  PHP. This library adds a jquery object to PHP. You can use jQuery-style  syntax within PHP, and the library automatically writes the jQuery code and  sends it to your browser.  JSAN — JavaScript Archive Network  www.openjsan.org index.html  This repository for JavaScript code offers a library that simplifies importing  multiple scripts. If you want to try something in JavaScript, check here to see  whether somebody’s already done it. If you come up with a clever new trick,  post it here for the community to share.   398 Part IV: The Part of Tens   W3Schools tutorials and examples  www.w3schools.com default.asp  W3Schools has become a go-to site for tutorials. There are a lot of tutorials  about a lot of topics. The quality varies, but most are quite good. Note that  some of the tutorials are out of date. Standards have changed over the years,  and it’s hard to tell which tutorials are following standards from several  years ago, and which are using the current best practices. Still, this is a site  worth bookmarking, and if you can’t find what you’re looking for in this book,  you might find it there.  Google AJAX APIs  http:  code.google.com apis ajax   Google has been extremely committed to the AJAX and open-source move- ment. The company has released a number of incredible APIs that allow  developers access to powerful Google tools. Investigate how to connect to  Google Maps, Google searching, visualization tools, and even Google Earth!  Aflax  www.aflax.org   MochiKit  http:  mochikit.com   This really promising Flash JavaScript project brings the functionality of  Flash into the JavaScript environment.  A complete JavaScript library heavily influenced by Python. Support for  functional programming, simplified syntax, and an interactive interpreter. If  you’re a Python programmer, you’ll love MochiKit. If not, you might still look  it over to see what the buzz is all about.     Chapter 16: Ten Great Resources  399  Dojo  www.dojotoolkit.org   A powerful alternative to jQuery, Dojo has a very strong user interface  library. Dojo widgets  dijits  are the Dojo answer to user-interface objects.  The many very powerful dijits in Dojo include tools for date and time input,  data tables  which automatically retrieve data from an AJAX request and  then populate an HTML table , and menu systems.  Ext JS  YUI   DZone  http:  extjs.com products extjs   If you outgrow the capabilities of jQuery  hard to believe, but it happens ,  extJS will likely serve your needs. This extremely powerful JavaScript AJAX  toolkit is a bit more complex than jQuery, but it does just about everything.  http:  developer.yahoo.com yui   As Yahoo has built cutting-edge AJAX applications, it has also released its  own development library for programmers. The Yahoo User Interface  YUI   is an incredibly powerful application tool with DOM support, event manage- ment, and a huge number of components.  www.dzone.com links index.html  My favorite feature of this very nice developers’ news site is its reference  cards. The site has a huge library of quick-reference cards on just about  any development topic you might consider. Each card is available as a free,  downloadable PDF.  I actually wrote the XHTML reference card.     400 Part IV: The Part of Tens    Index    A      tag, B1–12 absolute positioning,   B2–31, B2–32, B2–33,  B2–34  accordion effect, 319–321 Accordion tool, 294,   318–321  accordion.html   program, 318–320  account, PHP, 341 action attribute, 343 action button, B1–27 active state, 307 ActiveX technology, 230 addClass   method, 258 addInput program, 52 additive color, B2–13 Adobe graphics editor, 17 AJAX  about this book, 4–5 asynchronous   transaction, 225–228,  234–235  basic description of, 15 client-server   communication, 224  CMS  content   management system ,  260–263  connection, 227–229 overview, 224.225 technological   advancement, 1–2  uses for, 226 what it is, 224 what it’s not, 223  ajax.html program,   AJAXtabs.html program,   258–259  325–327    Symbols and  Numerics    @  ampersand , 171 *  asterisk , 179 \  backward slash , 148, 178 ^  beginning of string   character , 174, 176–177  :  colon , 66–67     comment character , 36 { }  curly brace , 179 $  end of string character ,   174, 176–177  ==  equal operator , 60–61    forward slash , 148, 176 $   function, 247–249 >  greater than operator ,   60  >=  greater than or equal to   operator , 60 {  left brace , 59 <  less than operator , 60 <=  less than or equal to   operator , 60   * *   multi-line comment   character , 36  !=  not equal operator , 60 .  period , 174, 177 +  plus sign , 50–51, 179 }  right brace , 59 ;  semicolon , 37 [ ]  square bracket , 110 200 HTTP response code,   400 HTTP response code,   404 HTTP response code,   408 HTTP response code,   500 HTTP response code,   233  233  233  233  233  alert dialog box, 37 alert   method, 36, 52, 96 Alfax Web site, 398 alignment, text, B2–19 alphabetical comparison,   60  ampersand  @ , 171 Animate button, 12 animate   method,  206–207, 218, 279 :animated fi lter, 291 animation  compound image, 209–213 fading technique, 272 image-swapping, 203–209 natural-feeling, 280 positioning technique,   273–277  relative motion, 280 sliding animation  technique, 272  speed parameter, 272, 279 swing easing style, 280 time-based, 279  append   method, 287–288 Aptana editor  basic description of, 23 code completion, 32 Debug perspective, 89–93 directory structure, 245 error warning, 33, 79–80 example of, 24 help fi le, 33 integrated help option, 33 jQuery library with,   243–245  syntax highlighting, 32 Web Project Wizard, 244  archive, 397 argument, function,   103–104  Ari SpriteLib Web site, 211   402 JavaScript & AJAX For Dummies   array  accessing data in, 110 defi ned, 97, 109 length, 112 with for loop, 111–113 pre-loaded value in, 111 storing list of data in,   109–110  two-dimensional, 114–118  assignment operator, 61 asterisk  * , 179 asynch.html program,   258  Asynchronous JavaScript   And XML.

If you're starting out with JavaScript for the first time, as most dummies book readers probably are, do NOT buy this one. I don't understand how the editors of the company could allow such a complex, incoherent book to be described as one for dummies [beginners]. The only people whom I think would benefit are those who are already somewhat proficient in JavaScript. In sum, the author is an expert on his subject matter but doesn't have a clue when it comes to communicating. This happens all too often in the world of software, where programmers who become authors, have no idea how to communicate with non-programmers [beginners], the target audience of this book.

The author commits a classic error when writing about topics he knows inside out. He assumes the reader understands and/or is familiar with a wide array of JavaScript/Programming related concepts that are of course 2nd nature to him. So instead of starting out with the absolute basics of JavaScript, explaining them, and progressing accordingly in an organized manner from simple to more difficult, he quickly jumps into somewhat complex programming concepts and procedures. I found this scattered approach a little baffling.

To compound the classic error described above, he states that each element of the scripts he uses as examples, will be explained in detail, but that didn't always happen.

There was another problem that confused me. Maybe the concept was clear to others, but it certainly wasn't for me. On page 36 he said using //
