Praise for Previous Editions of The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book  “The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book is a great way to get you started with Ubuntu, giving  you enough information to be productive without overloading you.”  —John Stevenson, DZone book reviewer  “OUB is one of the best books I’ve seen for beginners.”  —Bill Blinn, TechByter Worldwide  “This book is the perfect companion for users new to Linux and Ubuntu. It  covers the basics in a concise and well-organized manner. General use is cov- ered  separately  from  troubleshooting  and  error-handling,  making  the  book  well suited both for the beginner as well as the user who needs extended help.” —Thomas Petrucha, Austria Ubuntu User Group  “I have recommended this book to several users who I instruct regularly on the  use of Ubuntu. All of them have been satisﬁ ed with their purchase and have  even been able to use it to help them in their journey along the way.”  —Chris Crisafulli, Ubuntu LoCo Council,  Florida Local Community Team  “This text demystiﬁ es a very powerful Linux operating system. . . . In just a few  weeks of having it, I’ve used it as a quick reference a half-dozen times, which  saved me the time I would have spent scouring the Ubuntu forums online.”  —Darren Frey, Member, Houston Local User Group  “This is a book that the new Ubuntu user would ﬁ nd helpful in getting started  and the more experienced computer user would ﬁ nd informative enough to  keep as a reference manual. I also enjoyed the computing humor.”  —Dr. Gregory Chapelle, General Atomics,  Electromagnetics Division, San Diego, California  “In short, this book is something that I can honestly recommend to anyone  using Ubuntu. It works great as a reference and equally well as a how-to guide.  I respect the work that’s been done, and I can’t overstate how knowledgeable  the authors are, as well as the reviewers.”  —Paul Tagliamonte, Ubuntu Member, and Debian Developer   This page intentionally left blank    The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book Ninth Edition   This page intentionally left blank    The Ofﬁ cial  Ubuntu Book Ninth Edition  Matthew Helmke Elizabeth K.

Like Ubuntu, it has evolved in a steady ca- dence of regular releases, and this sixth edition reﬂ ects the cumulative in- sight gained from prior editions, as well as some of the latest innovations  driving Ubuntu forward.  2011 is a critical year of change for Ubuntu, as we move towards the new,  uniﬁ ed interface called Unity. Our goal is to deliver what people have long  wished for: the world’s cleanest, most elegant desktop experience, as free  software. 11.04 is the ﬁ rst major step in that process as we introduce Unity  by default on the desktop, retaining the Classic GNOME desktop for those  who cannot yet make the leap to Unity.  Our broader goal is to challenge the free software ecosystem to invest as  much creativity and energy in design as it does in engineering. We know  that free software can be the best in the world for performance, reliability,  and security; now it’s time to bring ease-of-use and stylishness into the  mix too.  I hope you enjoy 11.04, and love this book. My thanks to the many folks  who have made both Ubuntu and The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book possible. It’s a  great privilege to be part of this community.  —Mark Shuttleworth Ubuntu Founder April 2011        xix   This page intentionally left blank    Foreword to the First Edition  IT’S A SMALL CELEBRATION for me to write this foreword—almost exactly  two years after the ﬁ rst meeting of a small group of free software profes- sionals  that  turned  into  the  Ubuntu  project. A  celebration  because  two  years ago none of us would have predicted that our dream would spawn  several  million  CDs,  three  or  four  million  enthusiastic  users,  hundreds  of  commitments  of  support  from  companies  large  and  small,  a  minor  prime-time television reference, and now The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book.  The dream that brought us together can be simply expressed:  To build a world-class operating system for ordinary desktop computer  users, that is genuinely free and freely available, that is immediately use- ful,  and  that  represents  the  very  best  that  the  free  software  world  can  achieve today.  In setting out to build a platform for “ordinary desktop computer users,” I  had no idea that I would have the privilege of meeting and working with  so many extraordinary desktop computer users. Some of those extraordi- nary individuals are the authors of this book, people who both understand  the importance of the free software movement and have the talent to have  been real contributors to its success. Others make up the backbone of the  Ubuntu  community—the  small  but  dedicated  army  of  a  few  hundred  people that works to produce a new release of Ubuntu every six months.  They are at the heart of a network that reaches out through the global free  software  community—through  the  world  of  Debian,  an  extraordinary  project in its own right and without which Ubuntu could not exist, and on  out to the thousands of projects, large and small, that produce the code  and documentation that we pull together and call Ubuntu.  While this huge extended community can often appear to be fractured  and  divided  along  inﬁ nitesimal  ideological  lines,  we  are  all  broadly  in         xxi   xxii   Foreword to the First Edition  agreement about four key ideas, and it is those ideas that are central to the  Ubuntu promise:    That our software should not come with a license fee. That we should    be able to share our software, modify it, and then share our modiﬁ ca- tions, too.    That this free software should be the best version available, including     regular security updates, and not a tease for a better, commercial  product.    That full-scale, high-quality commercial support from local and     global companies should be available for this free platform.    That this software should be usable in as many languages as possible     and usable by as many people as possible regardless of disability.  The 17 of us who met in London two years ago come from a very wide va- riety of countries and backgrounds, but we all agreed that the goal of pro- ducing a platform that could live up to that promise was a worthy one, one  that we would devote ourselves to wholeheartedly.  For several months we worked quietly. We wanted to come to the world not  only with a manifesto but also with a clear demonstration of work done  toward our goals, something that people could test and comment on. We  had no name  though industry insiders called us the “Super-Secret Debian  Startup”  and, as a result, we hosted most of our work at www.no-name-yet .com. We were looking for a name that could express the beauty of the free  software  community  development  process—collaboration,  interdepen- dence, sharing, standing gently on the shoulders of giants, and reaching for  lofty goals. The only word that comes close to that, of which I’m aware, is  the African word ubuntu. It is found in many forms in many different Afri- can languages. And so we adopted it as the name of our project.   We knew that our ﬁ rst release would have blemishes—warts—and gave it  the codename “The Warty Warthog.” We called ourselves “the warthogs”  and coordinated our work on the warthogs IRC channel. Today, for bet- ter or worse, that’s turned into a tradition of codenames such as “Breezy  Badger” and “Dapper Drake.” As lighthearted as they sound, these code- names come to embody the spirit of our community as it works toward a       Foreword to the First Edition   xxiii  particular release. This next one—Dapper—is exactly that: a man emerg- ing from youth, professional, bold, conﬁ dent, and energetic. This is our  ﬁ rst release that is designed to meet the needs of large organizations as  much as developers and engineers. In the same way, the Ubuntu commu- nity has moved from being something of a rebellion against the “Linux  establishment” to a strong and professionally organized group.  What Makes Ubuntu So Popular? First, this is the time for free software to come to the forefront, and Ubuntu  is very much the beneﬁ ciary of the vast amount of work that has gone into  building up a huge body of work in the GNU Linux world. That work has  been under way for nearly 30 years, in one form or another, but Ubuntu is  one  way  in  which  it  is  suddenly  becoming “visible”  to  the  nonspecialist  computer user. We are in the middle of a great overturning of the industry  status quo. The last time that happened, in the mid-1990s, was when the  world  suddenly  found  itself  connected  to  itself—by  the  Internet.  Every  major company, especially those in the ﬁ eld of technology, had to examine  itself and ask the question, “How do we adapt to an Internet world?” To- day, every major technology company has to ask itself the question, “How  do we adapt to a free software world?”  I would speculate and say that Ubuntu represents an idea whose time has  come. We did not invent the free software movement—that honor goes to  Richard Stallman and many others who had a vision far more profound at a  time when it was hard to see how it could ever become reality. But Ubuntu  has perhaps the honor of bringing that vision to a very wide audience in a  form that we can all appreciate. I hope that the real visionaries—those who  have led the way—will appreciate the decisions and the choices we make in  bringing you this project. Some will take exception—I know Linus prefers  KDE to GNOME, for example, so he’s likely to be more of a fan of Kubuntu  than Ubuntu. But in general, the ideas that others have had, the principles  of the free software movement, are well expressed in Ubuntu.  Second, Ubuntu is a project on which you can have a real impact. It has the  beneﬁ t of deep and reliable ﬁ nancial backing and a corporate team to give  it muscle, but it is in every regard an open project, with participation at the  highest levels by true volunteers. We work in a ﬁ shbowl—our meetings    xxiv   Foreword to the First Edition  take place online, in a public forum. That can be tricky. Building an oper- ating system is a fast-paced business full of compromise and tough deci- sions in the face of little information. There are disagreements and dirty  laundry, and mistakes are made.  I should know; some of them are mine.  You should hear the one about the Warty Warthog desktop artwork.  The  transparency of our environment, however, means that we can count on  having  robust  conversations  about  our  options—all  of  them,  even  the  ones the core team would never have dreamed up. It also means that mis- takes are identiﬁ ed, discussed, and ultimately addressed faster than they  would be if we lived and worked behind closed doors. You get a better plat- form as a result.  We work hard as a community to recognize the contributions of all sorts  of individuals—advocates, artists, Web forum moderators, channel opera- tors, community event organizers, writers, translators, people who ﬁ le and  triage bugs . . . whatever your particular interest or talent, we will ﬁ nd a  way to integrate your contribution.  Perhaps most important is the way our approach to community differenti- ates Ubuntu from other free software projects with similar vision. We try to  do all of this in a way that recognizes that disagreements are important but  prevents those disagreements from creating deep divides in our commu- nity. Our code of conduct may not be perfect, but it reminds each of us to  remember the meaning of the word ubuntu—that each of us has our best  impact through the relationships we maintain with one another. Finding  common ground and maintaining healthy communication are more im- portant for us as a community in the long run than a particular technical  decision or the speciﬁ c choice of words with which to translate “File” into  Spanish.  Our  community  governance  structures—our  Technical  Board  and Community Council—exist to ensure that debates don’t become per- sonal and that decisions can be taken after all sides have been heard.  If you are a software professional or curious about Linux, this book and this  platform are an excellent choice. You will learn about the world of Ubuntu  and, indirectly, Debian and GNU Linux. These are great foundations for  working with the tools that I believe will come to deﬁ ne the “standard,” the  everyday computing base upon which we build our homes and ofﬁ ces.      Foreword to the First Edition   xxv  I once heard a proprietary software vendor say, “Linux is more expensive  because skilled Linux professionals are more costly.” This is true. It means,  of course, that Linux skills are more valuable! It won’t be true forever be- cause the world of Linux is expanding so rapidly that sooner or later we  will have to accept a position in the mainstream, and that takes off some of  the “geek points” associated with being part of the “future of technology.”  But right now, without a doubt, being ahead of the curve on Linux and on  Ubuntu is the right place to be. If you’re this far into this foreword, you are  clearly going to make it. ;-    It’s  difﬁ cult  for  me  to  speculate  on  what  the  future  might  hold  for  the  Ubuntu project. I know that I along with many others are loving the op- portunity to be at the center of such an exciting initiative and are commit- ted to seeing where it leads us over the coming years. I believe that it will  become  a  pervasive  part  of  our  everyday  computing  environment,  so  I  would like to help make sure that we don’t make too many mistakes along  the way! Please, come and join us in the ﬁ shbowl to help ensure we do a  very, very good job.  —Mark Shuttleworth Ubuntu Founder April 2006   This page intentionally left blank    Preface  WE HOPE YOU ENJOY The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book. There are many changes we  made for this edition, which we believe takes an already good book to a  new level.   Because Ubuntu has increased in popularity and is better known, we have  expanded the intended audience from pure beginners to also include those  who know a bit about Ubuntu but who want to improve their skills and  become power users. These individuals are not necessarily focused on be- coming programmers or systems administrators, but regular people who  want to make their day-to-day use of Ubuntu more efﬁ cient or who want  to better harness Ubuntu’s potential.  A large part of this book has been rewritten—not because the earlier edi- tions were bad, but because so much has happened since the previous edi- tion  was  published.  This  book  chronicles  the  major  changes  that  affect  typical users and will help anyone learn the foundations, the history, and  how to harness the potential of the free software in Ubuntu.  As we write this, it has been several years since we penned the ﬁ rst edi- tion of The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book. Over that time, we have seen Ubuntu  continue its explosive growth. Updating this book drives this fact home  in  striking  ways.  For  example,  the  numbers  of  users  and  posts  in  the  Ubuntu Forums and the Ask Ubuntu Web sites continues to rise.   Once again, we feel blessed that The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book has been able to  beneﬁ t from, and perhaps in a small way even contribute to, that success.  Ultimately, that success paved the way for several subsequent editions, and  now the ninth edition, of the book that you’re reading now.        xxvii   xxviii   Preface  In the process, this book, like Ubuntu, continues to mature. Our job as  authors, like that of the Ubuntu developers, now involves more updating  and polishing than it used to. Distributed under a free license, a once-risky  book on a once-risky operating system is, just a few short years later, as  close to a sure thing as an author, publisher, and, if we have done our job  well, a reader could hope for.  And yet with success comes responsibility to our readers and to our users  with high expectations. Ubuntu’s success is built in part of maturity and  excellence, and it cannot sacriﬁ ce these qualities if it will succeed. We can- not either. Our job as writers is complicated because we need to accurately  reﬂ ect and represent both qualities while catering to an increasing and in- creasingly diverse group of users.  As we’ve noted in the prefaces to previous editions of this book, being Of- ﬁ cial has carried with it a set of rights and responsibilities. Our book’s title  means that we must attempt to reﬂ ect and represent the whole Ubuntu  community. While we, as authors, are expected to put ourselves into the  book, it is understood that it can never be to the detriment of the values,  principles, technologies, or structures of the Ubuntu community.  Doing this has been complicated as Ubuntu has grown. In each edition, we  have added new information, because the Ubuntu community has grown  to include new projects. In each revision of this book, we have needed to  add to the list of related projects, tools, and community initiatives. As the  Ubuntu community grows, it is impossible to give a complete accounting  of what Ubuntu has to offer. Creating a summary requires some hard deci- sions. At the end of the day, we are constrained by page count and our own  limited schedules.  Meanwhile, as with earlier editions, we needed to write this book about a  new release of Ubuntu while that version was under active development  and was being redesigned, rethought, and rebuilt. Every day, Ubuntu grows  in different, unpredictable ways, and this growth has increased exponen- tially with the size of the community and the diversity of the user base. Our  book’s development process had to both match and track this process as  our content was crafted, rewritten, adjusted, and allowed to mature itself.      Preface   xxix  As in the previous edition, the contributors to this book go well beyond  those listed on the book’s cover. Invisible to most readers, dozens of mem- bers of the community left their mark on different parts of the text of this  book. Although this degree of participation led to a writing process that  was as hectic, and at times frustrating, as the process that builds Ubuntu,  we hope we can remind readers of the level of quality that this process in- spires in our book’s subject. In the places where we achieve this, we have  earned our book’s title. With that goal in mind, we look forward to future  versions of Ubuntu and editions of this book wrought through the same  community-driven process.

In recent years, the Ubuntu operating system has taken the open source  and IT world by storm. From out of nowhere, the Little Operating System  That Could has blossomed into a full-featured desktop and server offering  that has won over the hearts of users everywhere. Aside from the strong  technical  platform  and  impressive  commitment  to  quality,  Ubuntu  also  enjoys success because of its sprawling community of enthusiastic users  who have helped to support, document, and test every millimeter of the  Ubuntu landscape.  In your hands you are holding the ofﬁ cial, authorized guide to this impres- sive operating system. Each of the authors selected to work on this book  has demonstrated a high level of technical competence, an unbridled com- mitment to Ubuntu, and the ability to share this knowledge in a simple  and clear manner. These authors gathered together to create a book that  offers a solid grounding to Ubuntu and explains how the many facets and  features of Ubuntu work.  About This Book At the start of every book, on every bookshelf, in every shop, is a para- graph that sums up the intentions and aims for the book. We have one  very  simple,  down-to-earth  aim:  to  make  the  Ubuntu  experience  even  more  pleasant  for  users.  The  Ubuntu  developers  and  community  have  gone to great lengths to produce an easy-to-use, functional, and ﬂ exible  operating system for doing, browsing, and creating all kinds of interesting  things. This book augments that effort. With such an integrated and ﬂ exi- ble operating system, this guide acts as a tour de force for the many things  you can do with Ubuntu.        xxxv   xxxvi   Introduction  The Scope of the Book With so much to cover, we had our work cut out to write a book that could  cover the system in sufﬁ cient detail. However, if we were to write in depth  about  every  possible  feature  in  Ubuntu,  you  would  need  to  buy  a  new  bookcase to store the sheer amount of content.  Part of the challenge in creating The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Book was selecting the  topics and content that can be covered within a reasonably sized book. We  have identiﬁ ed the most essential content and written only about it. These  chosen topics not only cover installation, use of the desktop, applications,  multimedia, system administration, and software management, but also  include a discussion of the community, online resources, and the philoso- phy behind Ubuntu and open source software. As a bonus, we expanded  our discussion of projects related to Ubuntu that will be of interest to you.  We believe this book provides an ideal one-stop shop for getting started  with Ubuntu.  The Menu Here is a short introduction to each chapter and what it covers.    Chapter 1: The Ubuntu Story. This spirited introduction describes    the Ubuntu project, its distribution, its development processes, and  some of the history that made it all possible.    Chapter 2: Installing Ubuntu. We walk through the installation     process one step at a time to clearly describe how anyone interested  may begin using Ubuntu on their own computer.    Chapter 3: Getting Started with Ubuntu. This is an informative and     enjoyable introductory tour of Ubuntu, and the reader’s ﬁ rst intro- duction to the more practical content of the book.    Chapter 4: Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications. Here you     will learn about the vast contents of the Ubuntu software repositories  and discover how to take advantage of them. Several examples of  useful software that is not installed by default are highlighted.      Introduction   xxxvii    Chapter 5: Customizing Ubuntu for Performance, Accessibility, and     Fun. Learn how to bend Ubuntu to better ﬁ t your needs or whims.     Chapter 6: Becoming an Ubuntu Power User. We explore some of    the advanced ways to use Ubuntu. This is the chapter for users who  want to move up from basic use, but who do not intend to become  programmers or professional systems administrators.    Chapter 7: Welcome to the Command Line. Begin to take advantage    of the power and efﬁ ciency of the command line with the clear, easy-to- use examples in our brief introduction.    Chapter 8: The Ubuntu Server. This introduction to Ubuntu Server    installation and administration includes coverage of command-line  package management, basic security topics, and advanced installer  features like logical volume management and RAID.    Chapter 9: Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives. There are a    number of Linux distributions based on Ubuntu that you will ﬁ nd  interesting and possibly useful. We discuss some of these as well as  projects that are integral to the creation of Ubuntu, such as Launch- pad and Bazaar.    Chapter 10: Ubuntu, Convergence, and Devices of the Future. A     signiﬁ cant effort is under way to make Ubuntu more useful not only  on devices such as phones, but also in some surprisingly useful and  cool ways.    Chapter 11: The Ubuntu Community. The Ubuntu community is     larger and more active than many people realize. We discuss many of  its facets, including what people like you do to build, promote,  distribute, support, document, translate, and advocate Ubuntu—and  we tell you how you can join in the fun.  The Ubuntu team offers several installation options for Ubuntu users, in- cluding CDs for desktop, alternate install, and server install. These three  CD  images  are  conveniently  combined  onto  one  DVD  included  in  the  back of this book, allowing you to install Ubuntu for different conﬁ gura- tions from just one disk. There is also an option to test the DVD for defects  as well as a memory test option to check your computer.   xxxviii   Introduction  The  ﬁ rst  boot  option  on  the  DVD, “Start  or  Install  Ubuntu,”  will  cover  most users’ needs. For more comprehensive information, check the Help  feature by selecting F1 on the boot menu. You can also refer to Chapter 2,  which covers the Ubuntu installation process in detail.

Ubuntu Promises and Goals      Sustaining the Vision: Canonical and the  Ubuntu Foundation    Beyond the Vision: Ubuntu Subprojects, Flavors,     and Spin-Offs Summary           1           THIS  CHAPTER  BRINGS THE history  of  the  Ubuntu  Project  to  life,  explores  that history, and looks to its future. If you are looking to jump right in and  get  started  with  Ubuntu,  you  can  skip  this  and  proceed  immediately  to  Chapter 2, Installing Ubuntu. If you are interested in ﬁ rst learning about  where Ubuntu comes from and where it is going, this chapter provides a  good introduction.  The Vision In April 2004, Mark Shuttleworth brought together a dozen developers from  the Debian, GNOME, and GNU Arch projects to brainstorm. Shuttleworth  asked the developers if a better type of operating system  OS  was possible.  Their answer was “Yes.” He then asked them what this OS would look like.  Finally, he asked them to describe the community that would build such an  OS. That group worked with Shuttleworth to come up with answers to these  questions, and then they decided to try to make the answers a reality. The  group named itself the Warthogs and gave itself a six-month deadline to  build a proof-of-concept OS. The developers nicknamed their ﬁ rst release  the Warty Warthog, making the reasonable assumption that their ﬁ rst prod- uct would have its warts. Then they got down to business.  It’s fulﬁ lling, particularly for those of us who were privileged to be among  those  early Warthogs,  to  see  the  progress  made  by  this  project  over  the  years. We had a strong beginning when, far from being warty, the Warty  Warthog surpassed our most optimistic expectations and everyone’s pre- dictions. Within six months, Ubuntu was in the number 1 spot on several  popularity  rankings  of  GNU Linux  distributions.  Ubuntu  has  demon- strated the most explosive growth of any GNU Linux distribution in re- cent memory and had one of the most impressive ﬁ rst years and continued  growth of any free or open source software project in history.  It is staggering to think that after so few years, millions of individuals are  using Ubuntu. As many thousands of these users give back to the Ubuntu  community by developing documentation, translation, and code, Ubuntu  improves  every  day.  As  many  thousands  of  these  users  contribute  to  a  thriving advocacy and support community—both online and in their lo- cal  communities—Ubuntu’s  growth  remains  unchecked.  Ubuntu  sub-  2   Free Software, Open Source, and GNU Linux   3  projects, a list of efforts that includes Kubuntu and Ubuntu Studio, along  with other projects like Ubuntu on mobile phones, are extending the reach  and goals of the Ubuntu project into new realms.  Meanwhile, millions of Ubuntu installations have occurred and continue  to happen at universities, Internet cafés, computer shops, and community  centers around the world. You can ﬁ nd Ubuntu almost anywhere people  use  computers.  The  authors  have  personally  seen  strangers  running  Ubuntu on trains in Spain, in libraries in Boston, in museums in Croatia,  in high schools in Mexico, across North Africa in Morocco and Tunisia,  and in many more places too numerous to list here.  Over the years, Ubuntu has continued to mature. The public took even  more notice of Ubuntu beginning with the release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, the  ﬁ rst polished release with long-term support for both desktops and serv- ers; it was followed by a new release every six months and a new LTS re- lease  every  two  years  up  to  the  current  16.04  LTS.  With  these  releases,  Ubuntu has proved it intends to stick around for the long term, while also  improving consistently and on a predictable schedule. Even with this mat- uration, the project maintains its youthful vigor, its ambitious attitude, its  commitment to its principles, and its community-driven approach. As the  project ages, it is proving that it can learn from its failures as well as its suc- cesses and that it can maintain growth without compromising stability.  We’ve come a long way—and we’re still only getting started.  Free Software, Open Source, and GNU Linux While thousands of individuals have contributed in some form to Ubuntu,  the  project  has  succeeded  only  through  the  efforts  of  many  thousands  more who have indirectly laid the technical, social, and economic ground- work  for  Ubuntu’s  success.  While  introductions  to  free  software,  open  source, and GNU Linux can be found in many other places, no introduc- tion to Ubuntu is complete without a brief discussion of these concepts  and the people and history behind them. It is around these concepts and  within  these  communities  that  Ubuntu  was  motivated  and  born.  Ulti- mately, it is through these ideas that it is sustained.   4   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  Free Software and GNU In a series of events that have almost become legend through constant rep- etition, Richard M. Stallman created the concept of free software in 1983.  Stallman grew up with computers in the 1960s and 1970s, when computer  users purchased very large and extremely expensive mainframe comput- ers, which were then shared among large numbers of programmers. Soft- ware was, for the most part, seen as an add-on to the hardware, and every  user had the ability and the right to modify or rewrite the software on his  or her computer and to freely share this software. As computers became  cheaper and more numerous in the late 1970s, producers of software be- gan to see value in the software itself. Producers of computers began to ar- gue that their software could be copyrighted and was a form of intellectual  property much like a music recording, a ﬁ lm, or a book’s text. They began  to distribute their software under licenses and in forms that restricted its  users’ abilities to use, redistribute, or modify the code. By the early 1980s,  restrictive software licenses had become the norm.  Stallman, then a programmer at MIT’s Artiﬁ cial Intelligence Laboratory,  became increasingly concerned with what he saw as a dangerous loss of  the freedoms that software users and developers had previously enjoyed.  He was concerned with computer users’ ability to be good neighbors and  members of what he thought was an ethical and efﬁ cient computer-user  community. To ﬁ ght against this negative tide, Stallman articulated a vi- sion for a community that developed liberated code—in his words, “free  software.”  He  deﬁ ned  free  software  as  software  that  had  the  following  four  characteristics—labeled  as  freedoms  0  through  3  instead  of  1  through 4 as a nod to computer programming tradition and a bit of an  inside joke:    The freedom to run the program for any purpose  freedom 0       The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your     needs  freedom 1    freedom 2     The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor       The freedom to improve the program and release your improvements     to the public so that the whole community beneﬁ ts  freedom 3       Free Software, Open Source, and GNU Linux   5  Access to source code—the human-readable and modiﬁ able blueprints of  any  piece  of  software,  which  can  be  distinguished  from  the  computer- readable version of the code that most software is distributed as—is a pre- requisite to freedoms 1 and 3. In addition to releasing this deﬁ nition of free  software, Stallman created a project with the goal of creating a completely  free OS to replace the then-popular UNIX. In 1984, Stallman announced  this project and called it GNU—also in the form of common programmer  humor, a recursive acronym that stands for “GNU’s Not UNIX.”  Linux By the early 1990s, Stallman and a collection of other programmers work- ing  on  GNU  had  developed  a  near-complete  OS  that  could  be  freely  shared. They were, however, missing a ﬁ nal essential piece in the form of a  kernel—a complex system command processor that lies at the center of  any OS. In 1991, Linus Torvalds wrote an early version of just such a ker- nel, released it under a free license, and called it Linux. Torvalds’s kernel  was paired with the GNU project’s development tools and OS and with  the  graphical  windowing  system  called  X.  With  this  coupling,  a  com- pletely free OS was born—free both in terms of price and in Stallman’s  terms of freedom.  All systems referred to as Linux today are, in fact, built on the work of this  collaboration. Technically, the term Linux refers only to the kernel. Many  programmers  and  contributors  to  GNU,  including  Stallman,  argue  em- phatically  that  the  full  OS  should  be  referred  to  as  GNU Linux  to  give  credit  not  only  to  Linux  but  also  to  the  GNU  project,  and  to  highlight  GNU’s goals of spreading software freedom—goals not necessarily shared  by Linus Torvalds. Many others ﬁ nd this name cumbersome and prefer  calling the system simply Linux. Yet others, such as those working on the  Ubuntu project, attempt to avoid the controversy altogether by referring  to GNU Linux only by using their own project’s name.  Open Source Disagreements over labeling did not end with discussions about the naming  of the combination of GNU and Linux. In fact, as the list of contributors to  GNU and Linux grew, a vibrant world of new free software projects sprouted    6   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  up, facilitated in part by growing access to the Internet. As this community  grew and diversiﬁ ed, a number of people began to notice an unintentional  side effect of Stallman’s free software. Because free software was built in an  open way, anyone could contribute to software by looking through the code,  ﬁ nding bugs, and ﬁ xing them. Because software ended up being examined  by larger numbers of programmers, free software was higher in quality, per- formed better, and offered more features than similar software developed  through proprietary development mechanisms. It turned out that in many  situations, the development model behind free software led to software that  was inherently better than proprietary alternatives.  As the computer and information technology industry began to move into  the  dot-com  boom,  one  group  of  free  software  developers  and  leaders,  spearheaded by two free software developers and advocates—Eric S. Ray- mond and Bruce Perens—saw the important business proposition offered  by a model that could harness volunteer labor or interbusiness collabora- tion and create intrinsically better software. However, they worried that  the term free software was problematic for at least two reasons. First, it was  highly ambiguous—the English word free means both gratis, or at no cost   e.g., free as in free beer , and liberated in the sense of freedom  e.g., free as  in free speech . Second, there was a feeling, articulated most famously by  Raymond, that all this talk of freedom was scaring off the very business  executives and decision makers whom the free software movement needed  to impress if it was to succeed.  To tackle both of these problems, this group coined a new phrase—open  source—and created a new organization called the Open Source Initiative.  The group set at its core a deﬁ nition of open source software that over- lapped completely and exclusively with both Stallman’s four-part deﬁ ni- tion of free software and with other community deﬁ nitions that were also  based on Stallman’s.  One  useful  way  to  understand  the  split  between  the  free  software  and  open source movements is to think of it as the opposite of a schism. In  religious schisms, churches separate and do not work or worship together  because of relatively small differences in belief, interpretation, or motiva- tion. For example, most contemporary forms of Protestant Christianity       How the Vision Became Ubuntu   7  agree on almost everything but have separated over some small but irrec- oncilable differences. However, in the case of the free software and open  source  movements,  the  two  groups  have  fundamental  disagreements  about  their  motivation  and  beliefs.  One  group  is  focused  on  freedom,  while the other is focused on pragmatics. Free software is most accurately  described as a social movement, whereas open source is a development  methodology. However, the two groups have no trouble working on proj- ects hand in hand.  In terms of the motivations and goals, open source and free software di- verge greatly. Yet in terms of the software, the projects, and the licenses  they  use,  they  are  completely  synonymous.  While  people  who  identify  with either group see the two movements as being at odds, the Ubuntu  project sees no conﬂ ict between the two ideologies. People in the Ubuntu  project identify with either group and often with both. In this book, we  may  switch  back  and  forth  between  the  terms  as  different  projects,  and  many people in the Ubuntu community identify more strongly with one  term  or  the  other.  For  the  purposes  of  this  book,  though,  either  term  should be read as implying the other unless it is stated otherwise.  How the Vision Became Ubuntu There was a time when writing a history of Ubuntu might have seemed  premature; however, that is no longer the case, as the last several years have  been busy ones for Ubuntu. With its explosive growth, it is difﬁ cult even  for those involved most closely with the project to track and record some  of the high points. Importantly, there are some key ﬁ gures whose own his- tory must be given to fully understand Ubuntu. This brief summary pro- vides some of the high points of Ubuntu’s history to date and the necessary  background knowledge to understand where Ubuntu comes from.  Mark Shuttleworth No history of Ubuntu can call itself complete without a history of Mark  Shuttleworth. Shuttleworth is, undeniably, the most visible and important  person in the Ubuntu world. More important from the point of view of  history, Shuttleworth is also the originator and initiator of the project; he    8   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  made the snowball that would eventually roll on and grow to become the  Ubuntu project.  Shuttleworth was born in 1973 in Welkom, Free State, in South Africa. He  attended Diocesan College and obtained a business science degree in ﬁ - nance and information systems at the University of Cape Town. During  this period, he was an avid computer hobbyist and became involved with  the free and open source software community. He was at least marginally  involved in both the Apache project and the Debian project and was the  ﬁ rst person to upload the Apache Web server, perhaps the single most im- portant piece of server software on GNU Linux platforms, into the Debian  project’s archives.  Seeing an opportunity in the early days of the Web, Shuttleworth founded  a certiﬁ cate authority and Internet security company called Thawte in his  garage. Over the course of several years, he built Thawte into the second  largest certiﬁ cate authority on the Internet, trailing only the security behe- moth VeriSign. Throughout this period, Thawte’s products and services  were built and served almost entirely from free and open source software.  In  December  1999,  Shuttleworth  sold  Thawte  to VeriSign  for  an  undis- closed amount that reached into the hundreds of millions in U.S. dollars.  With his fortune made at a young age, Shuttleworth might have enjoyed a  life of leisure—and he probably considered it. Instead, he decided to pur- sue his lifelong dream of space travel. After paying approximately US$20  million to the Russian space program and devoting nearly a year to prepa- ration, including learning Russian and spending seven months training in  Star City, Russia, Shuttleworth realized his dream as a civilian cosmonaut  aboard the Russian Soyuz TM-34 mission. On this mission, Shuttleworth  spent two days on the Soyuz rocket and eight days on the International  Space Station, where he participated in experiments related to AIDS and  genome research. In early May 2002, Shuttleworth returned to Earth.  In addition to engaging in space exploration and an only slightly less im- pressive jaunt to Antarctica, Shuttleworth has played an active role as both  a philanthropist and a venture capitalist. In 2001, Shuttleworth founded  The  Shuttleworth  Foundation   TSF ,  a  nonproﬁ t  organization  based  in  South Africa. The foundation was chartered to fund, develop, and drive       How the Vision Became Ubuntu   9  social innovation in the ﬁ eld of education. Of course, the means by which  TSF  attempts  to  achieve  these  goals  frequently  involve  free  software.  Through these projects, the organization has been one of the most visible  proponents of free and open source software in South Africa and even the  world. In the venture capital area, Shuttleworth worked to foster research,  development, and entrepreneurship in South Africa with strategic injec- tions of cash into start-ups through a new venture capital ﬁ rm called HBD,  an acronym for “Here Be Dragons.” During this period, Shuttleworth was  busy brainstorming his next big project—the project that would eventu- ally become Ubuntu.  The Warthogs There has been no lack of projects attempting to wrap GNU, Linux, and  other pieces of free and open source software into a neat, workable, and  user-friendly  package.  Mark  Shuttleworth,  like  many  other  people,  be- lieved that the philosophical and pragmatic beneﬁ ts offered by free soft- ware put it on a course destined for widespread success. While each had its  strengths,  none  of  the  offerings  was  particularly  impressive  as  a  whole.  Something was missing from each version. Shuttleworth saw this as an op- portunity. If someone could build the great free software distribution that  helped push GNU Linux into the mainstream, he would come to occupy a  position of strategic importance.  Shuttleworth, like many other technically inclined people, was a huge fan of  the  Debian  project   discussed  in  depth  later  in  this  chapter .  However,  many things about Debian did not ﬁ t with Shuttleworth’s vision of an ideal  OS. For a period of time, Shuttleworth considered the possibility of run- ning for Debian project leader as a means of reforming the Debian project  from within. With time, though, it became clear that the best way to bring  GNU Linux  into  the  mainstream  would  not  be  from  within  the  Debian  project, which in many situations had very good reasons for being the way  it  was.  Instead,  Shuttleworth  would  create  a  new  project  that  worked  in  symbiosis with Debian to build a new, better GNU Linux system.  To kick off this project, Shuttleworth invited a dozen or so free and open  source software developers he knew and respected to his ﬂ at in London in  April 2004. It was in this meeting  alluded to in the ﬁ rst paragraphs of this    10   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  introduction  that the groundwork for the Ubuntu project was laid. By that  point, many of those individuals involved were excited about the possibility  of the project. During the London meeting, the members of the team— which would in time grow into the core Ubuntu team—brainstormed a  large list of the things that they would want to see in their ideal OS. That list  is now a familiar list of features to most Ubuntu users. Many of these traits  are covered in more depth later in this chapter. The group wanted    Predictable and frequent release cycles      A strong focus on localization and accessibility      A strong focus on ease of use and user-friendliness on the desktop      A strong focus on Python as the single programming language     through which the entire system could be built and expanded    A community-driven approach that worked with existing free     software projects and a method by which the groups could give back  as they went along, not just at the time of release    A new set of tools designed around the process of building distribu-    tions that allowed developers to work within an ecosystem of  different projects and that allowed users to give back in whatever  way they could  There  was  consensus  among  the  group  that  actions  speak  louder  than  words, so there were no public announcements or press releases. Instead,  the group set a deadline for itself—six short months in the future. Shuttle- worth agreed to ﬁ nance the work and pay the developers full-time salaries  to work on the project. After six months, they would both announce their  project and reveal the ﬁ rst product of their work. They made a list of goals  they wanted to achieve by the deadline, and the individuals present took  on tasks. Collectively, they called themselves the Warthogs.  What Does Ubuntu Mean? At this point, the Warthogs had a great team, a set of goals, and a decent  idea of how to achieve most of them. The team did not, however, have a  name for the project. Shuttleworth argued strongly that they should call  the project Ubuntu.      How the Vision Became Ubuntu   11  Ubuntu is a concept and a term from several South African languages, in- cluding Zulu and Xhosa. It refers to a South African ideology or ethic that,  while difﬁ cult to express in English, might roughly be translated as “hu- manity toward others” or “I am what I am because of who we all are.” Oth- ers have described Ubuntu as “the belief in a universal bond of sharing  that  connects  all  humanity.”  The  famous  South  African  human  rights  champion Archbishop Desmond Tutu explained Ubuntu in this way:  A person with Ubuntu is open and available to others, afﬁ rming of others,  does not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a  proper self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a  greater  whole  and  is  diminished  when  others  are  humiliated  or  dimin- ished, when others are tortured or oppressed.  Ubuntu  played  an  important  role  as  a  founding  principle  in  post- apartheid  South Africa  and  remains  a  concept  familiar  to  most  South  Africans today.  Shuttleworth liked Ubuntu as a name for the new project for several rea- sons. First, it is a South African concept. While the majority of the people  who work on Ubuntu are not from South Africa, the roots of the project  are, and Shuttleworth wanted to choose a name that represented this ori- gin. Second, the project emphasizes relationships with others and provides  a framework for a profound type of community and sharing—exactly the  attitudes of sharing, community, and collaboration that are at the core of  free software. The term represented the side of free software that the team  wanted to share with the world. Third, the idea of personal relationships  built  on  mutual  respect  and  connections  describes  the  fundamental  ground rules for the highly functional community that the Ubuntu team  wanted to build. Ubuntu was a term that encapsulated where the project  came from, where the project was going, and how the project planned to  get there. The name was perfect. It stuck.  Beyond the Vision To pay developers to work on Ubuntu full time, Shuttleworth needed a  company to employ them. He wanted to pick some of the best people for  the jobs from within the global free and open source communities. These  communities,  inconveniently  for  Shuttleworth,  know  no  national  and    12   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  geographic boundaries. Rather than move everyone to a single locale and  ofﬁ ce, Shuttleworth made the decision to employ these developers through  a  virtual  company.  While  this  had  obvious  drawbacks  in  the  form  of  high-latency  and  low-bandwidth  connections,  different  time  zones,  and  much more, it also introduced some major beneﬁ ts in the particular con- text  of  the  project.  For  one  thing,  the  distributed  nature  of  employees  meant  that  the  new  company  could  hire  individuals  without  requiring  them to pack up their lives and move to a new country. More important, it  meant that everyone in the company was dependent on IRC, mailing lists,  and online communication mechanisms to do their work. This uninten- tionally and automatically solved the water-cooler problem that plagued  many other corporately funded free software projects—namely, that de- velopers  would  casually  speak  about  their  work  in  person,  and  cut  the  community and anyone else who didn’t work in the ofﬁ ce out of the con- versation  completely.  For  the  ﬁ rst  year,  the  closest  thing  that  Canonical  had to an ofﬁ ce was Shuttleworth’s ﬂ at in London. While the company has  grown and now has several ofﬁ ces around the world, it remains distrib- uted and a large number of the engineers work from home. The group re- mains highly dependent on Internet collaboration.  With time, the company was named Canonical. The name was a nod to the  project’s optimistic goals of becoming the canonical place for services and  support for free and open source software and for Ubuntu in particular.  Canonical, of course, refers to something that is accepted as authoritative.  It is a common word in the computer programmer lexicon. It’s important  to note that being canonical is like being standard; it is not coercive. Unlike  holding a monopoly, becoming the canonical location for something im- plies a similar sort of success—but never one that cannot be undone, and  never one that is exclusive. Other companies support Ubuntu and build  operating systems based on it, but as long as Canonical is doing a good job,  its role will remain central.  What Is Ubuntu? The Warthogs’ goal and Canonical’s ﬂ agship project is Ubuntu. Ubuntu is  a free and open source GNU Linux distribution and operating system.      What Is Ubuntu?   13  What Is a Distribution? It’s clear to most people that Ubuntu is an OS. The full story is a little more  complex. Ubuntu is what is called a distribution of GNU Linux—a distro  for short. Understanding exactly what that means requires, once again, a  little bit of history. In the early days of GNU and Linux, users needed a  great deal of technical knowledge; only geeks needed to apply. There were  no Linux operating systems in the sense that we usually use the term; there  was no single CD or set of disks that one could use to install Ubuntu. In- stead, the software consisted of dozens and even hundreds of individual  programs, each built differently by a different individual, and each distrib- uted separately. Installing each of the necessary applications would be in- credibly time consuming at best. In many cases, incompatibilities and the  technical trickery necessary to install software made getting a GNU Linux  system on a hard disk prohibitively difﬁ cult. A great deal of knowledge of  conﬁ guration and programming was necessary just to get a system up and  running. As a result, very few people who were not programmers used the  early GNU Linux systems.  Early distributions were projects that collected all of the necessary pieces  of software from all of the different places and put them together in an  easier-to-install  form  with  the  most  basic  conﬁ guration  already  done.  These  distributions  aimed  to  make  using  GNU Linux  more  convenient  and to bring it to larger groups of users. Today, almost no one uses GNU  Linux without using a distribution. As a result, distribution names are well  known. Ubuntu is one such project; other popular distros include Red Hat  and Fedora, SUSE, Gentoo, and, of course, Debian.  Most distributions contain a similar collection of software. For example,  they all contain most of the core pieces of GNU and a Linux kernel. Almost  all contain the X Window System and a set of applications on top of it that  may include a Web browser, a desktop environment, and an ofﬁ ce suite.  While distributions started out distributing only the core pieces of the OS,  they have grown to include an increasingly wide array of applications as  well. A modern distribution includes all of the software that “comes with an  OS”—that is, several CDs or DVDs containing anything that most users  might want and that the distribution is legally allowed to distribute.   14   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  Ubuntu,  like  other  contemporary  distros,  offers  a  custom  installer,  a  framework including software and servers to install new software once the  system has been installed, a standard conﬁ guration method through which  many programs can be conﬁ gured, a standard method through which us- ers can report bugs in their software, and much more. Frequently, distri- butions  also  contain  large  repositories  of  software  on  servers  accessible  through the Internet. To get a sense of scale, Ubuntu includes more than  40,000 pieces of software on its central servers; each piece of software is  customized slightly and tested to work well with all of the other software  on the system. The number of software fragments grows daily.  What’s important to realize is that the creators of distributions do not, for  the most part, write or create the applications you use. The Ubuntu team  did not write Linux, and it did not write GNU—although individuals on  the  team  have  contributed  to  both  projects.  Instead,  the  Ubuntu  team  takes  GNU,  Linux,  and  many  thousands  of  other  applications  and  then  tests and integrates them to be accessible under a single installer. Ubuntu  is the glue that lets you take a single CD, install hundreds of separate pieces  of software, and have those fragments work together as a single, integrated  desktop system. If you were to pick up a CD of another distribution such  as Debian, Red Hat, or Novell, the software installed would be nearly iden- tical to the software in Ubuntu. The difference would be in the way the  software is installed, serviced, upgraded, and presented and the way it inte- grates with other pieces of software on the system.  An Ecosystem of Distributions Many  hundreds  of  GNU Linux  distributions  are  in  active  use  today.  A  quick look at Distrowatch’s database  distrowatch.com  demonstrates the  staggering  number  and  growth  of  distributions.  One  of  the  ﬁ rst  GNU   Linux  distributions  was  called  Softlanding  Linux  System   SLS .  For  a  number of reasons, a programmer named Patrick Volkerding thought he  could improve on SLS. Because SLS was free software, Volkerding had the  freedom to make a derivative version of SLS and distribute it. Volkerding  did  just  this  when  he  took  SLS’s  code  and  used  it  as  the  framework  or  model  upon  which  to  create  his  own  variant  called  Slackware.  Subse- quently, Slackware became the ﬁ rst widely successful GNU Linux distri- bution and is maintained to this day.      What Is Ubuntu?   15  With time, the landscape of GNU Linux distribution has changed. How- ever, the important role of derivation that made Slackware possible has re- mained fully intact and is still shaping this landscape. Today, the hundreds  of GNU Linux distributions serve a multitude of users for a myriad of pur- poses: There are distributions specially designed for children, for dentists,  and for speakers of many of the world’s languages. There are distributions  for science, for business, for servers, for personal digital assistants  PDAs ,  for nonproﬁ t organizations, for musicians, and for countless other groups.  Despite this diversity, the vast majority of derivatives can be traced back to  one of two parent distributions: Red Hat or Debian. While it is not neces- sary  to  understand  the  details  of  how  these  projects  differ,  it’s  useful  to  know that Red Hat and Debian offer two compelling, but frequently dif- ferent, platforms. Each project has strengths and weaknesses. For almost  every group making a Linux-based OS, one of these projects acts as square  one  with a few notable exceptions, such as the Gentoo project .  However,  while  the  process  of  deriving  distributions  has  allowed  for  a  proliferation of OS platforms serving a vast multiplicity of needs, the de- rivative process has, historically, been largely a one-way process. New dis- tributions  based  on  Red  Hat—CentOS  and  SUSE,  for  example—begin  with Red Hat or a subset of Red Hat technology and then customize and  diverge from there. Very few of these changes ever make it back into Red  Hat and, with time, distributions tend to diverge to the point of irrecon- cilable incompatibility. While the software that each system includes re- mains largely consistent across all distributions, the way that it is packaged,  presented, installed, and conﬁ gured becomes increasingly differentiated.  As a result of this process, interdistribution sharing and collaboration be- come increasingly difﬁ cult.  This growing divergence indicates a more general problem faced by distri- bution teams in getting changes upstream. Frequently, the users of GNU  Linux distributions ﬁ nd and report problems in their software. Frequently,  distribution teams ﬁ x the bugs in question. While sometimes these bugs  arise from changes introduced by the distribution, they often exist in the  upstream version of the software and the ﬁ x applies to every distribution.  What  is  not  uncommon,  but  is  unfortunately  much  less  frequent,  is  for  these bug ﬁ xes to be pushed upstream so that all distributions and users    16   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  get to use them. This lack of collaboration is rarely due to malice, incom- petence, or any tactical or strategic decision made by developers or their  employers. Instead, tracking and monitoring changes across distributions  and in relation to upstream developers is complicated and difﬁ cult. It’s a  fact of life that sometimes changes fall on the ﬂ oor. These failures are sim- ply the product of distribution-building processes, policies, and tools that  approach distributions as products in and of themselves—not processes  within an ecosystem.  Like many other distributions, Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian. Unlike  the creators of many derivatives, the Ubuntu community has made it one  of its primary goals to explore the possibility of a better derivation process  with Debian, with Debian’s and Ubuntu’s common upstreams  e.g., proj- ects such as Linux or GNU , and with Ubuntu’s own derivatives. A more  in-depth discussion of Debian can help explain how Ubuntu positions it- self within the free software world.  The Debian Project and the Free Software Universe Debian is a distribution backed by a volunteer project of many hundreds of  ofﬁ cial members and many more volunteers and contributors. It has ex- panded to encompass more than 45,000 packages of free and open source  applications  and  documentation.  Debian’s  history  and  structure  make  it  very good at certain things. For example, Debian has a well-deserved repu- tation for integrated package management and access to a large list of free  software applications. However, as a voluntary and largely nonhierarchical  organization, Debian had a challenging time providing frequent and reli- able releases, corporate support and liability, and a top-down consistency.  Each  new  distribution  exists  for  a  reason.  Creating  a  new  distribution,  even a derivative, is far from easy. In large part, Ubuntu exists to build off  of  the  many  successes  of  the  Debian  project  while  solving  some  of  the  problems it struggles with. The goal is to create a synthetic whole that ap- peals to users who had previously been unable or unwilling to use Debian.  In building off the great work of the Debian project, as well as GNU,  Linux,  and other projects that Debian is built on, the Ubuntu team wanted to ex- plore  a  new  style  of  derivation  that  focused  on  a  tighter  interproject       Ubuntu Promises and Goals   17  relationship within an ecosystem of different developers. While Ubuntu  tries to improve and build on Debian’s success, the project is in no way  trying to replace Debian. On the contrary, Ubuntu couldn’t exist without  the Debian project and its large volunteer and software base, as well as the  high degree of quality that Debian consistently provides. This symbiotic  relationship between Ubuntu and Debian is mirrored in the way that both  Ubuntu and Debian depend heavily on projects such as GNU and Linux to  produce great software, which they can each package and distribute. The  Ubuntu project sets out explicitly to build a symbiotic relationship with  both Debian and their common “upstream.”  The relationship between Ubuntu and Debian has not been simple, straight- forward, or painless, but rather has involved patience and learning on both  sides. While the relationship has yet to be perfected, with time it has im- proved consistently, and both groups have found ways to work together that  seem to offer major beneﬁ ts over the traditional derive-and-forget model. It  is through a complex series of technological, social, and even political pro- cesses—many  of  which  are  described  in  the  rest  of  this  chapter—that  Ubuntu tries to create a better way to build a free software distribution.  The Ubuntu Community Ubuntu would not be what it is today without the Ubuntu community.  Even the deﬁ nition of the word Ubuntu is one that revolves around people  interacting in a community. The Ubuntu community and how it is orga- nized as well as how those who choose to do so can get involved are dis- cussed in detail in Chapter 11.  Ubuntu Promises and Goals So far, this book has examined the prehistory, history, and context of the  Ubuntu project. After this chapter, the book focuses on the distribution  itself. Before proceeding, it’s important to understand the goals that moti- vated the project.  Philosophical Goals The most important goals of the Ubuntu project are philosophical in na- ture. The Ubuntu project lays out its philosophy in a series of documents    18   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  on its Web site. In the most central of these documents, the team summa- rizes the charter and the major philosophical goals and underpinnings.    Our philosophy    Our  work  is  driven  by  a  philosophy  of  software  freedom  that  aims  to  spread and bring the beneﬁ ts of software to all parts of the world. At the  core of the Ubuntu Philosophy are these core ideals:    1.   Every computer user should have the freedom to download, run,   copy, distribute, study, share, change and improve their software for  any purpose, without paying licensing fees.    2.   Every computer user should be able to use their software in the   language of their choice.    3.   Every computer user should be given every opportunity to use   software, even if they work under a disability.  Our philosophy is reﬂ ected in the software we produce and included in our  distribution. As a result, the licensing terms of the software we distribute  are measured against our philosophy, using the Ubuntu License Policy.  When you install Ubuntu, almost all of the software installed already meets  these ideals, and we are working to ensure that every single piece of soft- ware you need is available under a license that gives you those freedoms.  Currently, we make a speciﬁ c exception for some “drivers” that are avail- able only in binary form, without which many computers will not com- plete the Ubuntu installation. We place these in a restricted section of your  system, which makes them easy to remove if you do not need them.     Free software  For Ubuntu, the “free” in free software is used primarily in reference to  freedom and not to price—although we are committed to not charging for  Ubuntu. The most important thing about Ubuntu is that it confers rights  of software freedom on the people who install and use it. These freedoms  enable the Ubuntu community to grow and to continue to share its collec- tive experience and expertise to improve Ubuntu and make it suitable for  use in new countries and new industries.  Quoting the Free Software Foundation’s “What Is Free Software?” the free- doms at the core of free software are deﬁ ned as    The freedom to run the program for any purpose     The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to     your needs        Ubuntu Promises and Goals   19    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others     The freedom to improve the program and release your improvements     to the public so that everyone beneﬁ ts    Open source    Open  source  is  a  term  coined  in  1998  to  remove  the  ambiguity  in  the  English word free. The Open Source Initiative described open source soft- ware  in  the  Open  Source  Deﬁ nition.  Open  source  continues  to  enjoy  growing success and wide recognition.  Ubuntu is happy to call itself open source. While some refer to free and  open source as competing movements with different ends, we do not see  free and open source software as either distinct or incompatible. Ubuntu  proudly includes members who identify with both movements.  Here, the Ubuntu project makes explicit its goals that every user of soft- ware should have the freedoms required by free software. This is impor- tant for a number of reasons. First, it offers users all of the practical beneﬁ ts  of software that runs better, faster, and more ﬂ exibly. More important, it  gives every user the capability to transcend his or her role as a user and a  consumer of software. Ubuntu wants software to be empowering and to  work in the ways that users want it to work. Ubuntu wants all users to have  the ability to make sure it works for them. To do this, software must be free,  so Ubuntu makes this a requirement and a philosophical promise.  Of course, the core goals of Ubuntu do not end with the free software deﬁ - nition.  Instead,  the  project  articulates  two  new  but  equally  important  goals. The ﬁ rst of these, that all computer users should be able to use their  computers in their chosen languages, is a nod to the fact that the majority  of the world’s population does not speak English, while the vast majority  of software interacts only in that language. To be useful, source code com- ments, programming languages, documentation, and the texts and menus  in computer programs must be written in some language. Arguably, the  world’s most international language is a reasonably good choice. However,  there is no language that everyone speaks, and English is not useful to the  majority of the world’s population that does not speak it. A computer can  be a great tool for empowerment and education, but only if the user can  understand the words in the computer’s interface. As a result, Ubuntu be- lieves that it is the project’s—and community’s—responsibility to ensure    20   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  that every user can easily use Ubuntu to read and write in the language  with which he or she is most comfortable.  The ability to make modiﬁ cations—a requirement of free software and of  Ubuntu’s ﬁ rst philosophical point—makes this type of translation possi- ble. This book is a case in point. While it helps explain Ubuntu to only the  relatively small subset of the world that already speaks English, the choice  to write this book in English was made to enable it to have the widest im- pact. More important, it is distributed under a Creative Commons license  that allows for translation, modiﬁ cation, and redistribution. The authors  of  this  book  cannot  write  this  book  in  all  of  the  world’s  languages—or  even more than one of them. Instead, we have attempted to eliminate un- necessary legal restrictions and other barriers that might keep the commu- nity from taking on the translation work. As a result, the complete text of  the several editions have been translated into other languages like German,  Japanese, Polish, and Spanish.  Finally, just as no person should be blocked from using a computer simply  because he or she does not know a particular language, so no user should  be blocked from using a computer because of a disability. Ubuntu must be  accessible to users with motor disabilities, vision disabilities, and hearing  disabilities. It should provide input and output in a variety of forms to ac- count for each of these situations and for others. A signiﬁ cant percentage  of the world’s most intelligent and creative individuals also have disabili- ties. Ubuntu’s usefulness should not be limited when it can be inclusive.  More important, Ubuntu wants to welcome and to be able to harness the  ability of these individuals as community members to build a better and  more effective community.  Conduct Goals and Code of Conduct If Ubuntu’s philosophical commitments describe the why of the Ubuntu  project,  the  Code  of  Conduct   CoC   describes  Ubuntu’s  how.  Ubuntu’s  CoC is, arguably, the most important document in the day-to-day opera- tion of the Ubuntu community and sets the ground rules for work and  cooperation within the project. Explicit agreement to the document is the  only criterion for becoming an ofﬁ cially recognized Ubuntu activist and is  an essential step toward membership in the project. Signing the Ubuntu       Ubuntu Promises and Goals   21  Code of Conduct and becoming an Ubuntu member is described in more  depth in Chapter 11.  The CoC covers “behavior in public or in private whenever the project will  be judged by our actions.” The CoC goes into some degree of depth on a  series of points that fall under the following headings:    Be considerate.      Be respectful.      Be collaborative.      When you disagree, consult others.      When you are unsure, ask for help.       Step down considerately.  Many of these headings seem like common sense or common courtesy to  many, and that is by design. Nothing in the CoC is controversial or radical,  and it was never designed to be.  More difﬁ cult is that nothing is easy to enforce or decide because acting  considerately,  respectfully,  and  collaboratively  is  often  very  subjective.  There  is  room  for  honest  disagreements  and  occasional  hurt  feelings.  These are accepted shortcomings. The CoC was not designed to be a law  with explicit prohibitions on phrases, language, or actions. Instead, it aims  to provide a constitution and a reminder that considerate and respectful  discussion is essential to the health and vitality of the project. In situations  where there is a serious disagreement on whether a community member  has  violated  or  is  violating  the  code,  the  Community  Council—a  body  that is discussed in depth in Chapter 11—is available to arbitrate disputes  and decide what action, if any, is appropriate.  No one involved in the Ubuntu project, including Mark Shuttleworth and  the  other  members  of  the  Community  Council,  is  above  the  CoC.  The  CoC is never optional and never waived. Of course, in no way was the Code  of Conduct designed to eliminate conﬂ ict or disagreement. Arguments are  at  least  as  common  in  Ubuntu  as  they  are  in  other  projects  and  online  communities.  However,  there  is  a  common  understanding  within  the      22   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  project that arguments should happen in an environment of collaboration  and mutual respect. This allows for better arguments with better results,  and with fewer hurt feelings and fewer bruised egos.  While it has been sometimes incorrectly used as such, the CoC is not a  stick to be wielded against an opponent in an argument. Instead, it offers  useful points of reference upon which we can assume consensus within  the Ubuntu community. Much more frequently, if a group in the commu- nity feels a member is acting in a way that is out of line with the code, the  group will gently remind the community member, often privately, that the  CoC is in effect. In almost all situations, this is enough to avoid any further  action  or  conﬂ ict. Very  few  CoC  violations  are  ever  brought  before  the  Community Council.  Technical Goals While  a  respectful  community  and  adherence  to  a  set  of  philosophical  goals  provide  an  important  frame  in  which  the  Ubuntu  project  works,  Ubuntu is, at the end of the day, a technical project. As a result, it only  makes sense that in addition to philosophical goals and a project constitu- tion, Ubuntu has a set of technical goals.  The  ﬁ rst  technical  goal  of  the  project,  and  perhaps  the  most  important  one, is the coordination of regular and predictable releases. In April 2004,  at  the  Warthogs  meeting,  the  project  set  a  goal  for  its  initial  proof-of- concept release six months out. In part due to the resounding success of  that project, and in larger part due to the GNOME release schedule, the  team has stuck to a regular and predictable six-month release cycle and has  only once chosen to extend the release schedule—by six weeks for the ﬁ rst  LTS  release  to  ensure  it  was  done  right—and  only  then  after  obtaining  community consensus on the decision. The team then doubled its efforts  and made the next release in a mere four and a half months, putting its re- lease schedule back on track. Frequent releases are important because us- ers can then use the latest and greatest free software available—something  that  is  essential  in  a  development  environment  as  vibrant  and  rapidly  changing and improving as the free software community. Predictable re- leases are important, especially to businesses, because it means that they       Ubuntu Promises and Goals   23  can organize their business plans around Ubuntu. Through consistent re- leases, Ubuntu can provide a platform that businesses and derivative dis- tributions can rely upon to grow and build.  While releasing frequently and reliably is important, the released software  must also be supported. Ubuntu, like all distributions, must deal with the  fact that all software has bugs. Most bugs are minor, but ﬁ xing them may  introduce even worse issues. Therefore, ﬁ xing bugs after a release must be  done carefully or not at all. The Ubuntu project engages in major changes,  including bug ﬁ xes, between releases only when the changes can be exten- sively tested. However, some bugs risk the loss of users’ information or pose  a serious security vulnerability. These bugs are ﬁ xed immediately and made  available as updates for the released distribution. The Ubuntu community  works hard to ﬁ nd and minimize all types of bugs before releases and is  largely successful in squashing the worst. However, because there is always  the possibility that more of these bugs will be found, Ubuntu commits to  supporting every release for nine months after it is released. In the case of  LTS releases such as the original LTS  Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, released in 2006 ,  the project went well beyond even this and committed to support the re- lease for three full years on desktop computers and for ﬁ ve years in a server  conﬁ guration. This policy proved so popular with businesses, institutions,  and the users of Ubuntu servers that in 2008 and 2010, Ubuntu 8.04 LTS  and 10.04 LTS were released with similar three- and ﬁ ve-year desktop and  server extended support commitments. Starting with the 12.04 LTS release  and continuing with the 16.04 LTS release, both the desktop and server edi- tions are today supported for ﬁ ve years from the date of release.  This bipartite approach to servers and desktops implies the third major  technical  commitment  of  the  Ubuntu  project:  support  for  both  servers  and desktop computers in separate but equally emphasized modes. While  Ubuntu continues to be more well known, and perhaps more popular, in  desktop conﬁ gurations, there exist teams of Ubuntu developers focused  both on server and desktop users. The Ubuntu project believes that both  desktops and servers are essential, so it provides installation methods on  every DVD for desktop release, and on every CD for server release. Ubuntu  provides tested and supported software appropriate to the most common  actions  in  both  environments  and  documentation  for  each.  This  book    24   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  contains information on running Ubuntu both on the desktop and on a  server. The release of 6.06 LTS with long-term support successfully helped  pave the way for reliable long-term server support for Ubuntu and helped  grow the now-vibrant Ubuntu server community. The 8.04 LTS release re- peated this success with a more up-to-date platform, then 10.04 LTS, con- tinuing to now and 16.04 LTS.  Finally, the Ubuntu project is committed to making it as easy as possible  for users to transcend their role as consumers and users of software and to  take advantage of each of the freedoms central to our philosophy. As a re- sult, Ubuntu has tried to focus its development around the use and pro- motion  of  a  single  programming  language,  Python.  The  project  has  worked to ensure that Python is widely used throughout the system. By  ensuring  that  desktop  applications,  text-based  or  console  applications,  and many of the “guts” of the system are written in or extensible in Py- thon, Ubuntu intends that users need learn only one language to take ad- vantage of, automate, and tweak many parts of their computer systems.  Bug 1 Of course, Ubuntu’s goals are not just to build an OS that lives up to our  philosophy  or  technical  goals  and  to  do  it  on  our  terms—although  we  probably would be happy if we achieved only that outcome. Our ultimate  goal,  the  one  that  supersedes  and  inﬂ uences  all  others,  is  to  spread  our  great software, our frequent releases, and the freedoms enshrined in our  philosophy to as many computer users in as many countries as possible.  Ubuntu’s ultimate goal is not to become the most used GNU Linux distri- bution in the world; it is to become the most widely used OS in the world.  The ﬁ rst bug recorded for Ubuntu illustrates this fact. The bug, ﬁ led by  Shuttleworth and marked as severity critical, remains open today and can  be viewed online at https:  launchpad.net ubuntu +bug 1. The text of the  bug reads as follows.  Microsoft has a majority market share  Non-free software is holding back  innovation in the IT industry, restricting access to IT to a small part of the  world’s population and limiting the ability of software developers to reach  their full potential, globally. This bug is widely evident in the PC industry.      Ubuntu Promises and Goals   25  Steps to repeat:    1.  Visit a local PC store.  What happens:  preinstalled.  What should happen:  Ubuntu.    2.  Observe that a majority of PCs for sale have non-free software     3.  Observe very few PCs with Ubuntu and free software preinstalled.    1.  A majority of the PCs for sale should include only free software such as     2.  Ubuntu should be marketed in a way such that its amazing features and   beneﬁ ts would be apparent and known by all.    3.  The system shall become more and more user friendly as time passes.  Many have described Ubuntu’s success in the last several years as amazing.  For a new GNU Linux distribution, the level and speed of success have  been unprecedented. During this period, Ubuntu has lived up to both its  philosophical and technical commitments, achieved many of its goals, and  built  a  vibrant  community  of  users  and  contributors  who  have  accom- plished monumental amounts while collaborating in a culture of respect  and understanding fully in line with the Ubuntu Code of Conduct. How- ever, Bug 1 demonstrates that the Ubuntu project will be declared a com- plete  success  only  when  Ubuntu’s  standards  of  freedom,  technical  excellence, and conduct are the norm everywhere in the software world.  On May 30, 2013, Mark Shuttleworth ofﬁ cially closed Bug 1 with these  words, which end this section:  Personal computing today is a broader proposition than it was in 2004:  phones, tablets, wearables and other devices are all part of the mix for our  digital  lives.  From  a  competitive  perspective,  that  broader  market  has  healthy  competition,  with  IOS  and  Android  representing  a  meaningful  share   see  www.zdnet.com windows-has-fallen-behind-apple-ios-and -google-android-7000008699   and  in  particular  http:  cdn-static.zdnet .com i r story 70 00 008699 meeker620-620x466-620x466.jpg?hash =ZQxmZmDjAz&upscale=1 .  Android may not be my or your ﬁ rst choice of Linux, but it is without  doubt an open source platform that offers both practical and economic    26   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  beneﬁ ts  to  users  and  industry.  So  we  have  both  competition,  and  good  representation for open source, in personal computing.  Even  though  we  have  only  played  a  small  part  in  that  shift,  I  think  it’s  important for us to recognize that the shift has taken place. So from Ubun- tu’s perspective, this bug is now closed.  There is a social element to this bug report as well, of course. It served for  many as a sort of declaration of intent. But it’s better for us to focus our  intent on excellence in our own right, rather than our impact on someone  else’s product. In the  many  years since this bug was ﬁ led, we’ve ﬁ gured  out how to be amazing on the cloud, and I hope soon also how to be amaz- ing for developers on their desktops, and perhaps even for everyday users  across that full range of devices. I would rather we ﬁ nd a rallying call that  celebrates those insights, and leadership.   It’s worth noting that today, if you’re into cloud computing, the Microsoft  IAAS team are both technically excellent and very focused on having ALL  OS’s  including  Linux  guests  like  Ubuntu  run  extremely  well  on  Azure,  making them a pleasure to work with. Perhaps the market shift has played  a role in that. Circumstances have changed, and institutions have adapted;  so should we.  Along  those  lines,  it’s  good  to  reﬂ ect  on  how  much  has  changed  since  2004, and how fast it’s changed. For Ubuntu, our goal remains to deliver  fantastic experiences: for developers, for people building out production  infrastructure, and for end-users on a range of devices. We are doing all of  that in an environment that changes completely every decade. So we have  to be willing to make big changes ourselves—in our processes, our prac- tices, our tools, and our relationships. Changing this bug’s status is but a  tiny example.  Sustaining the Vision: Canonical and  the Ubuntu Foundation While Ubuntu is driven by a community, several groups play an important  role in its structure and organization. Foremost among these are Canonical,  Ltd., a for-proﬁ t company introduced as part of the Ubuntu history descrip- tion, and the Ubuntu Foundation, which is introduced later in this section.  Canonical, Ltd. Canonical, Ltd. is a company founded by Mark Shuttleworth with the pri- mary goal of developing and supporting the Ubuntu distribution. Many       Sustaining the Vision: Canonical and the Ubuntu Foundation    27  of  the  core  developers  on  Ubuntu—although  no  longer  a  majority  of  them—work full time or part time as employees of Canonical, Ltd. This  funding by Canonical allows Ubuntu to make the type of support com- mitments that it does. Ubuntu can claim that it will release in six months  because  releasing,  in  one  form  or  another,  is  something  that  the  paid  workers at Canonical can ensure. As an all-volunteer organization, Debian  suffered  from  an  inability  to  set  and  meet  deadlines—volunteers  might  become busy or have other deadlines in their paying jobs that take prece- dence. By offering paying jobs to a subset of developers, Canonical can set  support and release deadlines and ensure that they are met.  In this way, Canonical ensures that Ubuntu’s bottom-line commitments  are kept. Of course, Canonical does not fund all Ubuntu work, nor could  it. Canonical can release a distribution every six months, but that distribu- tion  will  be  made  much  better  and  more  usable  through  contributions  from the community of users. Most features, most new pieces of software,  almost all translations, almost all documentation, and much more are cre- ated outside of Canonical. Instead, Canonical ensures that deadlines are  met and that the essential work, regardless of whether it’s fun, gets done.  Canonical, Ltd. was incorporated on the Isle of Man—a tiny island nation  between Wales and Ireland that is mostly well known as a haven for inter- national businesses. Since much of Canonical’s staff is sprinkled across the  globe and no proper ofﬁ ce is necessary, the Isle of Man seemed like as good  a place as any for the company to hang its sign.  In early 2010, Mark Shuttleworth, Canonical’s ﬁ rst CEO, stepped down,  and the company’s long-time chief operating ofﬁ cer, Jane Silber, became  the new CEO. Shuttleworth retains his position as the head of the Ubuntu  Community Council. He focuses his energy on product design and work- ing  with  enterprise  customers  and  partners,  and  leaves  the  day-to-day  running of Canonical to Silber. Silber has been with Canonical since be- fore the ﬁ rst release, and the company is expected to continue expanding  and operating on its current path.  Canonical’s Service and Support While it is surprising to many users, fewer than half of Canonical’s em- ployees work on the Ubuntu project. The rest of the employees fall into    28   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  several  categories:  business  development,  support  and  administration,  and development of other projects.  Individuals involved in business development help create strategic deals  and  certiﬁ cation  programs  with  other  companies—primarily  around  Ubuntu.  In  large  part,  these  are  things  that  the  community  is  either  ill  suited for or uninterested in as a whole. One example of business develop- ment work is the process of working with companies to ensure that their  software  usually proprietary  is built and certiﬁ ed to run on Ubuntu. For  example, Canonical worked with IBM to ensure that its popular DB2 data- base would run on Ubuntu and, when this was achieved, worked to have  Ubuntu certiﬁ ed as a platform that would run DB2. Similarly, Canonical  worked with Dell to ensure that Ubuntu could be installed and supported  on Dell laptops and desktops as an option for its customers. A third exam- ple  is  the  production  of  this  book,  which,  while  published  by  Pearson’s  Prentice Hall imprint, was a product of work with Canonical.  Canonical also plays an important support role in the Ubuntu project in  three ways. First, it supports the development of the Ubuntu project. For  example, Canonical system administrators keep servers up that support de- velopment and distribution of Ubuntu. Second, Canonical helps Ubuntu  users and businesses directly by offering phone and e-mail support. Addi- tionally, Canonical has helped build a large commercial Ubuntu support  operation by arranging for support contracts with larger companies and  organizations. This support is over and above the free  i.e., gratis  sup- port offered by the community; this commercial support is offered at a  fee and is either part of a longer-term ﬂ at-fee support contract or is deliv- ered  on  a  pay-per-instance  basis.  By  offering  commercial  support  for  Ubuntu in a variety of ways, Canonical has made a business for itself and  helps make Ubuntu a more palatable option for the businesses, large and  small, that are looking for an enterprise or enterprise-class GNU Linux  product with support contracts like those offered by other commercial  GNU Linux distributions.  Finally, Ubuntu supports other support organizations. Canonical does not  seek or try to enforce a monopoly on Ubuntu support; it proudly lists hun- dreds of other organizations offering support for Ubuntu on the Ubuntu  Web pages. Instead, Canonical offers what is called second-tier support to       Sustaining the Vision: Canonical and the Ubuntu Foundation    29  these organizations. Because Canonical employs many of the core Ubuntu  developers, the company is very well suited to take action on many of the  tougher problems that these support organizations may encounter. With  its concentrated expertise, Canonical can offer this type of backup, or sec- ondary support, to these organizations.  Bazaar and Launchpad In addition to support and development on Ubuntu, Canonical, Ltd. funds  the  development  of  Bazaar,  a  distributed  version  control  tool,  and  the  Launchpad project. Bazaar is a tool for developing software that is used  heavily in Ubuntu and plays an important role in the technical processes  through which Ubuntu is forged. However, the software, which is similar  in functionality to other version control systems such as CVS, Subversion,  or BitKeeper, is useful in a variety of other projects as well. More impor- tant, Bazaar acts as the workhorse behind Launchpad.  More than half of Canonical’s technical employees work on the Launch- pad project. Launchpad is an ambitious Web-based superstructure appli- cation that consists of several highly integrated tools. The software plays a  central role in Ubuntu development but is also used for the development  of other distributions, especially those based on Ubuntu.  Launchpad and its components are discussed in more depth in Chapter 9.  The importance of Launchpad in the Ubuntu project cannot be overstated.  In  addition  to  handling  bugs,  translations,  and  distribution  building,  Launchpad handles Web site authentication and codiﬁ es team membership  in the Ubuntu project. It is the place where all work in Ubuntu is tracked  and recorded. Any member of the Ubuntu community and any person who  contributes to Ubuntu in almost any way will, in due course, create an ac- count in Launchpad.  The Ubuntu Foundation Finally,  in  addition  to  Canonical  and  the  full  Ubuntu  community,  the  Ubuntu project is supported by the Ubuntu Foundation, which was an- nounced by Shuttleworth with an initial funding commitment of $10 mil- lion.  The  foundation,  like  Canonical,  is  based  on  the  Isle  of  Man.  The  organization is advised by the Ubuntu Community Council.   30   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  Unlike Canonical, the Ubuntu Foundation does not play an active role in  the  day-to-day  life  of  Ubuntu.  At  the  moment,  the  Foundation  is  little  more than a pile of money that exists to endow and ensure Ubuntu’s fu- ture. Because Canonical is a young company, some companies and indi- viduals found it difﬁ cult early on to trust that Canonical would be able to  provide support for Ubuntu for the time frames  e.g., three to ﬁ ve years   that it claims it can. The Ubuntu Foundation exists to allay those fears.  Time and consistency have also contributed greatly to building the conﬁ - dence of companies and individuals in Ubuntu, and the foundation will  remain to ensure that consistency in the future.  If something unexpected were to happen to Shuttleworth or to Canonical  that  caused  either  to  be  unable  to  support  Ubuntu  development  and  maintain the distribution, the Ubuntu Foundation exists to carry on many  of Canonical’s core activities well into the future. Through the existence of  the  Foundation,  the  Ubuntu  project  can  make  the  types  of  long-term  commitments and promises it does.  The one activity that the Foundation can and does engage in is receiving  donations  on  behalf  of  the  Ubuntu  project.  These  donations,  and  only  these donations, are then put into action on behalf of Ubuntu in accor- dance with the wishes of the development team and the Technical Board.  For the most part, these contributions are spent on “bounties” given to  community members who have achieved important feature goals for the  Ubuntu project.  Beyond the Vision: Ubuntu Subprojects,  Flavors, and Spin-Offs No introduction to Ubuntu would be complete without an acknowledg- ment of the growing list of Ubuntu subprojects and ﬂ avors. While Ubuntu  was derived from Debian, the project has also developed a number of ﬂ a- vors of its own.  First among these is Kubuntu—a version of Ubuntu that uses KDE instead  of Unity as the default desktop environment. As a ﬂ avor rather than a de- rivative, the relationship between Kubuntu and Ubuntu is different from  the relationship between Ubuntu and Debian. From a technical perspec-      Beyond the Vision: Ubuntu Subprojects, Flavors, and Spin-Offs    31  tive, Kubuntu resides fully within the Ubuntu distribution. Organization- ally, the Kubuntu team works fully within Ubuntu as well.  A similar organization exists with the Edubuntu project, which aims to  help develop Ubuntu so that a conﬁ guration of the distribution can be  easily and effectively put into use in schools. Although the project has un- dergone a few changes in recent years, it remains focused on both educa- tional and school-related software and on a Linux Terminal Server Project   LTSP  setup that allows schools to run many students’ computers using  one or more powerful servers and many “dumb” terminals that connect to  the  server  and  run  software  off  it.  This  relatively  simple  technical  trick  translates into huge cost savings in educational settings.  The Xubuntu project is based on the lightweight window manager Xfce.  Xubuntu is designed to be appropriate on older or less powerful comput- ers with less memory or slower processors—or just for people who prefer  a  more  responsive  environment  and  a  slimmer  set  of  features. While  it  originated as an unofﬁ cial project, Xubuntu has enjoyed great popularity  and has become integrated as an ofﬁ cial part of the core distribution.  These and other ﬂ avors are discussed in Chapter 9.  In a way, it is through these ﬂ avors that the work and goals of the Ubuntu  project come together and are crystallized. It is only through the free and  open source software movements’ commitment to freely accessible source  code that Ubuntu could be built at all. Similarly, it is only through Ubun- tu’s  continued  commitment  to  these  ideals  that  derivatives  can  spring  from Ubuntu. As a ﬂ avor with a view of distributions within an ecosys- tem, Ubuntu does not see the process of creating ﬂ avors as an insult or  criticism. Far from it—Ubuntu thinks ﬂ avor creation is the highest form  of compliment.  Outside  of  Ubuntu,  Canonical’s  work  is  largely  based  around  software  projects such as Launchpad and Bazaar that are designed to facilitate pre- cisely this sort of derivative process. This process, when practiced right, is  one that describes an ecosystem of development in which everyone bene- ﬁ ts—the derivative, Ubuntu, and Ubuntu’s upstreams. Only through this  ﬂ avor creation process does everyone get what they want. The creation of    32   Chapter 1       The Ubuntu Story  ﬂ avors,  when  done  correctly,  allows  groups  to  diverge  where  necessary  while working together where possible. Ultimately, it leads to more work  done, more happy users, and more overall collaboration. Through this en- hanced collaboration, Ubuntu’s philosophical and technical goals will be  achieved. Through this type of meaningful cooperation, internal and ex- ternal to the project itself, the incredible growth of Ubuntu will be sus- tained into the future.  Summary This chapter has looked at how the vision of a better distribution and OS  became the phenomenon that is Ubuntu. It moved through the relation- ship Ubuntu has with Canonical, Ltd. and the Ubuntu Foundation and  ﬁ nished with some discussion of the various Ubuntu subprojects, ﬂ avors,  and spin-offs that go beyond its original vision.   2  C H A P T E R   2 Installing Ubuntu    Choosing Your Ubuntu Version     Getting Ubuntu     Booting and Installing      Installing from the Minimal CD Summary           33       IF YOU ARE READING THIS, it is probably safe to assume that you have decided  to give Ubuntu a try. You will ﬁ nd that Ubuntu is ﬂ exible and powerful not  only as an operating system, but also in how you evaluate and install it.  Trying  Ubuntu  is  simple.  The  Ubuntu  desktop  DVD  is  a  special “live”  DVD. You can use this disk to run Ubuntu from the DVD itself without  Ubuntu removing or even interacting with your hard disk. This is ideal if  you are already using another operating system such as Windows or Mac  OS X; you can try Ubuntu by running it from the DVD, and you don’t  have to worry about it overwriting the data on your hard drive or chang- ing  any  part  of  your  current  operating  system  unless  you  intentionally  choose to do so.  Choosing Your Ubuntu Version The developers behind Ubuntu have worked to make the software as easy  and ﬂ exible to install as possible. They understand that people will be in- stalling Ubuntu on computers with varying purposes  desktops, servers,  laptops, and so on  and using different types of computers  PCs and Macs,  32-bit and 64-bit computers, and so on . To cater to as many people as  possible, two different Ubuntu DVDs can be used. The DVD that accom- panies this book is equivalent to the downloadable desktop DVD but with  additional packages included for your convenience.    Desktop: The desktop DVD is the one recommended for desktops and     laptops. With this DVD, you can boot Ubuntu from the DVD and, if  you like it, you have the option to install it to your hard drive. Note  that running from the disk without installing directly to the hard  drive is the default option to help prevent accidental data loss, and  that anything you do during the disk session will not be saved  unless  you know what you are doing and how to make that happen . This  makes the desktop installation a great way to test Ubuntu on your  machine without doing anything permanent.    Minimal CD: The minimal install CD is recommended for use in any     scenario where the desktop version is unusable  e.g., not enough  RAM  or for those with more advanced needs  e.g., automated  deployments or special partitioning requirements . With this CD, you   34   Choosing Your Ubuntu Version   35  boot into an installer, which will download the packages as you install  the OS, and then run Ubuntu when the installation is complete. Since  packages are downloaded, you will need an Internet connection  during installation if you use this method.  For standard users, it’s valuable to know that Ubuntu 16.04 ofﬁ cially sup- ports two main desktop computer types, or architectures.     i386: This supports all Intel or compatible processors except those  that require AMD64; it includes current Apple hardware. If you are  not certain which version you need, use this one. It will work on  either 32-bit or 64-bit systems, so it is the default choice.    AMD64: If you know you are using a processor based on the AMD64     or EM64T architecture  e.g., Athlon64, Opteron, EM64T Xeon, or  Core2 , you should choose this version because it will be a bit more  efﬁ cient on your hardware.  TIP   Where to Download If you lose the installation disk that accompanies this book, or if you want to use some of the  other options available, such as installation from a USB drive  discussed later in the chap- ter , you will ﬁ nd what you need at http:  help.ubuntu.com community GettingUbuntu.  Other Ubuntu Flavors In addition to the ofﬁ cial Ubuntu release, some ﬂ avors and editions are  based on Ubuntu but are slightly different. Here are some examples.    Kubuntu: Kubuntu is Ubuntu, but instead of using the default     interface, Kubuntu uses the KDE desktop. See http:  kubuntu.org or  Chapter 9 for more information.    Ubuntu Server: Ubuntu Server makes Ubuntu easy to install and use     on servers. It initially focused on making certain that the highest-quality  server applications were available for easy installation and conﬁ gura- tion, including MySQL, Apache, and others. The most recent work has  improved the cloud computing capabilities of Ubuntu Server via the  Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud. See Chapter 8 for more information.     36   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu    Xubuntu: The Xubuntu distribution replaces the default interface     with the Xfce 4 environment. Xubuntu is particularly useful for those  users who want to run Ubuntu on older hardware, as it has lighter  system requirements. See http:  xubuntu.org or Chapter 9 for more  information.  With a range of different ﬂ avors and options available, Ubuntu is ﬂ exible  enough to be used in virtually all situations.  Is It Still Ubuntu? Some of you may be reading about Kubuntu, Ubuntu Server, and Xubuntu  and wondering how different they are from the regular Ubuntu release.  These  ﬂ avors  differ  mainly  in  which  applications  and  user  interface  are  included. As such, they may differ quite a bit from the main Ubuntu re- leases, especially in the user interface look and feel, but the underlying OS  and software install system are the same.  Getting Ubuntu Ubuntu is an entirely free OS. When you have a copy of it, you can give it  to as many people as you like. This free characteristic of Ubuntu means  that it is simple to get a copy. If you have a high-speed Internet connection,  go to www.ubuntu.com download, and follow the instructions. You can  select a desktop DVD or minimal CD image and download it.  TIP   See the Burning a DVD section for details on how to create your Ubuntu DVD from the ﬁ le  you just downloaded. You can also create a bootable USB stick, as described in the Creating  a Bootable USB Stick section, just after Burning a DVD.  If you are willing to wait, you can buy authorized Ubuntu DVDs at http:   shop.canonical.com .  Burning a DVD When you download an Ubuntu DVD, you download a special .iso ﬁ le.  This ﬁ le is an “image” of the installation DVD. When you burn the .iso ﬁ le  to a DVD-ROM, you have a complete installation DVD all ready to go.      TIP   Getting Ubuntu   37  Which Image? When you are reading about .iso ﬁ les, you will often see them referred to as DVD images.  The term image here does not refer to a visual image such as a photo or picture, but rather to  an exact digital copy of the contents of a DVD.  You need to use a DVD-burning application to burn your .iso ﬁ le to the  DVD  correctly.  Inside  the  application  should  be  a  menu  option  called  Burn from Disk Image or something similar. The wording and details will  vary according to the program you use to burn the image. You should se- lect the .iso ﬁ le and insert a blank DVD; after a few minutes, out will pop a  fresh Ubuntu installation DVD.  To give you a head start, the following subsections present instructions for  burning a DVD in some popular tools.  In Windows 7, 8, or 10  To burn your image using Windows 7, 8, or 10,  follow these steps.  1.  Right-click on the icon for your downloaded .iso image and then  select either Burn Disk Image, Open with > Windows Disc Image  Burner, or Burn disc image  depending on your version of Windows .  2.  Select a writable DVD DVD drive from the drop-down box.  3.  Click Burn.  In Older Versions of Windows with ISO Recorder  To burn your .iso ﬁ le  with  the  freely  available  ISO  Recorder,  ﬁ rst  go  to  http:  isorecorder .alexfeinman.com, and then download and install ISO Recorder. To burn  your image, follow these steps.  1.  Insert a blank DVD into your DVD writer.  2.  Locate the .iso ﬁ le you downloaded, right-click it, and select Copy   Image to DVD.  3.  Click Next, and the recording process begins.  4.  When the image has been written, click Finish to exit ISO Recorder.   38   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  In Mac OS X  To burn your image using Mac OS X, follow these steps.  1.  Load the Disk Utility application  found in your Utilities folder .  2.  Insert a blank DVD, and then choose Images > Burn and select the   .iso ﬁ le.  In Ubuntu  To burn your image using Ubuntu, follow these steps.  1.  Insert a blank DVD into your DVD writer.  2.  In the File Browser, right-click on the ﬁ le you just downloaded, and   choose Write to Disk. The Write to Disk dialog box opens.  3.  In the dialog box, choose your DVD writer and speed, and then click   on Write. The Writing Files to Disk Progress dialog box opens, and  File Browser begins writing the disk.  TIP   Use the Right Option Be sure to use the Burn from Disk Image or similar option rather than just copy the .iso im- age onto the DVD to be burned. If you just burn the ﬁ le directly, you will have a DVD contain- ing the single .iso ﬁ le. This won’t work.  The Burn from Disk Image function takes the .iso ﬁ le and restores all the original ﬁ les from  the installation DVD onto the disk. This ensures you have a proper installation DVD.  Creating a Bootable USB Stick To create a bootable USB stick, follow these directions for your current  operating system.  TIP   Use the Right-Size USB Stick Use a USB stick with at least 2GB of free space.  In Windows  To create your bootable USB stick using Windows, follow  these steps.  1.  Download the Rufus bootable USB drive creator from https:  rufus  .akeo.ie . Note that it is a .exe ﬁ le and does not require additional  installation steps to run it.      Booting and Installing   39  2.  Insert your USB stick into the computer and launch Rufus.  3.  Click the optical drive button  and select the Ubuntu .iso image you   downloaded.  4.  Click the Start button and click OK when it warns you that data on   the USB stick will be destroyed  In Mac OS X  The Ubuntu download page recommends that Mac users  install the OS using a DVD because the workarounds required to create a  bootable USB stick on OS X are complex.  In Ubuntu  To create your bootable USB stick using Ubuntu, follow these  steps.  1.  Insert your USB stick into the computer.  2.  Open the Dash  see Chapter 3 if you don’t yet know what the Dash is    and search for Startup Disk Creator. Click the icon for Startup Disk  Creator to run the program.  3.  Select your downloaded Ubuntu .iso image. If your downloaded .iso   image does not automatically appear in the list in Startup Disk  Creator, click Other to select it.  4.  Select the USB stick in the bottom box.  5.  Click Make Startup Disk.  NOTE   You will need to have administrative privileges on your computer to use the USB Startup  Disk Creator.  Booting and Installing This section begins with instructions for running Ubuntu from the desk- top  DVD  that  you  burned  earlier,  from  the  DVD  that  came  with  this  book,  or  from  a  bootable  USB  stick. You  can  explore  and  test  Ubuntu  without making any changes to your hard drive. If you don’t like it, re- boot your computer and remove the DVD USB stick to return to what  you already have.   40   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  TIP   Try before You Buy Take some time to test the new OS before you make the permanent decision to erase your  hard drive and current operating system and install Ubuntu. Once you do so, you cannot re- cover old ﬁ les or return to how things were. This is why you are given the opportunity to test  from the DVD or USB stick. Take advantage of this opportunity and make sure you like what  you see.  Place your DVD into your DVD drive or your bootable USB stick into a  USB port and then reboot your computer. If your computer does not boot  from the DVD, you should enter your computer’s BIOS and change the  boot order to ensure that the boot medium you are using is ﬁ rst in the  boot order. Save your BIOS changes, and then restart the computer.  TIP   BIOS Problems If you have problems conﬁ guring your BIOS to boot from the DVD, you should consult the  manual. If you don’t have the manual, visit the manufacturer’s Web site, and see if you can  download the manual.  After a few seconds, the Ubuntu logo and boot screen appear. You can then  select a language from the menu on the left and decide whether you want  to Try Ubuntu, which allows you to try out Ubuntu without making any  changes to your computer and install it later if you decide you want to, or  whether you want to Install Ubuntu, which causes your computer to jump  straight into the installer. Select the ﬁ rst option, and Ubuntu will begin to  boot. After a minute or so, the Ubuntu desktop will appear, and you can  use the system right away. Under this scenario, the system is running from  the DVD and will not touch your hard disk. Do bear in mind that because  Ubuntu is running from the DVD, it will run more slowly than if it were  installed to your hard disk.  NOTE  DVD USB Stick  It takes a lot of space to write “DVD USB stick” over and over. For simplicity and easier read- ing, unless explicitly stated, assume we mean either one throughout the remainder of this  chapter when we refer to the live or install DVD.  If you decide you want to install the system permanently on your comput- er’s hard disk, there are two ways you can do so:      Booting and Installing   41  1.  Double-click the Install icon located on the left side of the desktop.  2.  Reboot and select Install Ubuntu from the initial menu.  TIP   If you choose to install from the live DVD while running Ubuntu, you can continue to use the  computer while the installation is happening. If you choose to reboot, the process will go a  bit faster.  Using  either  option,  an  installer  application  will  walk  you  through  the  steps to permanently install your Ubuntu system. The remainder of this  chapter describes each part of the process.  TIP   It is recommended that you back up any important ﬁ les before you perform the installation.  Although Ubuntu installations can safely resize Windows partitions, this is not guaranteed,  and installations can result in data loss, so it is wise to be careful.  Language The ﬁ rst screen you are presented with when you boot the computer in- troduces you to the installation program and asks you to select your lan- guage, as shown in Figure 2-1, and whether you want to Try Ubuntu  run  the operating system from the DVD without changing anything on your  hard drive, which we suggest for ﬁ rst-time users before committing to an  installation  or whether you want to Install Ubuntu.  Ubuntu supports a huge range of languages. Select your language from the  list, and then click Install Ubuntu to continue with the installation.  Preparing to Install Ubuntu You will be informed of the install requirements, as shown in Figure 2-2.  We strongly suggest selecting the option to Download Updates While In- stalling because this will end your installation with an up-to-the-minute  current system that includes any existing security updates or bug ﬁ xes. A  nice feature is that these updates will be downloaded while the installation  is in process, in parallel to other operations, so the updating happens with  great efﬁ ciency.   42   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  Figure 2-1  Pick your language.  Figure 2-2  Prepare to install Ubuntu.  You may also choose to install third-party software to enable your com- puter to play certain media ﬁ les immediately after installation. This will  also save you time later, although some users may not want to install closed  source software and will choose not to enable this option. Click Continue  after making your selection s .      Booting and Installing   43  Allocate Drive Space To prepare your hard disk to store the Ubuntu system and your ﬁ les, hard  disks are divided into partitions. Each partition reserves a speciﬁ c portion  of the hard disk for use by a particular operating system. As an example,  you may use the entire hard disk for your new Ubuntu system, or you may  share the disk so that both Windows and Ubuntu are installed. This shared  scenario is known as dual-booting. In a dual-booting situation, your hard  disk typically contains Windows partitions as well as Linux partitions, and  when it boots it gives you a menu so you can select whether to boot Win- dows or Linux.  In this part of the installer, you create the partitions for your new system.  This can be the trickiest part of the installation as well as the most danger- ous. If you have existing partitions  such as a Windows installation  on the  disk, it is highly recommended that you back up your important ﬁ les.  TIP   Seriously, We Mean It Really, really, really do back up any important ﬁ les. If you make a mistake in this part of the  installation, you could lose your ﬁ les and stop your system from booting.  Deciding How You Would Like to Set Up Your Partitions Before You   Create Them  If you have a clear idea of how your hard disk should be  partitioned, it is easier to get everything up and running quickly.  There are two especially common methods of partitioning:    Only Ubuntu on the disk: If you are installing only Ubuntu on the     disk and are happy to wipe the entire disk, your life is simple. Ubuntu  can do all the work for you.    Dual-booting: If you are installing to a computer that will have     multiple operating system options, you will partition your hard drive  and install each operating system to its own partition.  Regardless of whether you will install only Ubuntu on the disk or you will  dual-boot, you need to either conﬁ rm that Ubuntu may use the entire disk  or enter your desired partitioning scheme, beginning in Figure 2-3.   44   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  Figure 2-3  Allocate all drive space to Ubuntu.  Ubuntu Only  If you are happy to erase your entire hard disk, select Erase  disk and install Ubuntu and click Install Now. A dialog may pop up asking  you to Write the changes to disks; you can click Continue if you don’t see  any problems. If you choose this option, skip ahead to the next section of  the book, Installation Begins.  Encryption  You also have the option to Encrypt the new Ubuntu installa- tion for security, which will require you to set up a security key  Figure 2-4 .  This option conﬁ gures encryption on your entire Ubuntu installation and  requires a password or “key” when booting up to unlock your system. Using  encryption requires LVM  Linux Volume Manager  to be set up, which the  installer will select automatically.  Linux Volume Management  LVM   If you are interested in taking snap- shots  or  resizing  your  partitions  after  installation,  you  can  set  up  LVM  from within the installer by selecting the Use LVM with the new Ubuntu  installation option.  Manual  Partitioning  If  you  will  install  only  Ubuntu  or  will  dual-boot  with an existing operating system but want more control over the process,  you must set the partitions manually. To do this, select Something else and  click Continue. You will see the screen shown in Figure 2-5.      Booting and Installing   45  Figure 2-4  Choose a security key.  Figure 2-5  Create partitions manually.  The main part of this screen displays available drives and conﬁ gured parti- tions. Clicking on a drive or partition changes the actions available to you  below the list. Select the relevant disk to which you want to add partitions.  The disks are listed by device name in the order they are connected within  your computer.   46   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  Before you begin, you should prepare the disk for your partitions. If you  want to completely wipe a disk, click on the name of the device   dev sda  in Figure 2-6 , and then click New Partition Table. You’ll be asked if you’re  sure, so click Continue. The disk is now ﬁ lled with unallocated data and  you can add your Ubuntu partitions.  To add a partition, click a free space entry in the list and then click the Plus   +  button. A new window appears like that shown in Figure 2-7.  Figure 2-6  Conﬁ gure a partition.  Figure 2-7  Create a partition.      Booting and Installing   47  Set the values according to your requirements. The Type combo box lets  you select which one of the many ﬁ lesystem types you want the partition  to use. The default ﬁ lesystem included with Ubuntu is ext4, and it is rec- ommended that you use ext4 for any Ubuntu partitions.  Use  the  Mount  Point  combo  box  to  select  one  of  the  different  mount  points, which tells Ubuntu where the partition should be used. You need  to have a root partition, which has a mount point of  . Click OK to ﬁ nish  conﬁ guring this partition. You should also set up a swap partition; the in- staller will warn you if you do not.  Once you’ve completed conﬁ guring all your partitions, click Forward to  proceed with the installation. Please note that if you have read all of these  comments on partitioning and feel a bit overwhelmed or confused, you  don’t need to worry. You may simply use the default settings given by the  installer and all will work well.  Installation Begins At  this  point,  the  installation  begins. While  it  progresses,  you  are  asked  some questions to customize your installation appropriately. Customizing  your OS while installing it concurrently saves time.  Tell the installer where in the world you live  Figure 2-8 .  You can select your location in one of several ways. First, you can hover  your mouse over the time zone on your part of the world map to select  your location. When you are happy with the time zone selection, click it,  and  select  the  city  nearest  to  you.  Alternatively,  use  the  Selected  City  drop-down list to ﬁ nd the city nearest to you.  When you are done, click Continue.  Conﬁ guring Your Keyboard The next screen  shown in Figure 2-9  conﬁ gures your keyboard.  The installer will suggest a keyboard option for you based on your location  choice, but you may choose a different one if you desire. You can also use    48   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  Figure 2-8  Click the map to select a location.  Figure 2-9  Select the correct keyboard to ensure the symbols on the keys  work correctly.      Booting and Installing   49  the box at the bottom of the window to test whether your keyboard layout  works. Try typing some of the symbols on your keyboard  such as “,  ,   to  make sure they work. If you press a symbol key and a different one appears  on the screen, you have selected the wrong keyboard layout.  Identiﬁ cation The next step is to enter some details about you that can be used to create a  user account on the computer  Figure 2-10 .  In the ﬁ rst box, enter your full name. The information from this box is  used in different parts of the system to indicate who the user is behind  the account.  Enter a computer name in the last box. Also called a “hostname,” this is a  single word that identiﬁ es your current machine. It is used on a local net- work so that you can identify which machine is which.  Figure 2-10  Enter your personal details to create your user account.   50   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  Hostnames  can  be  great  fun.  Many  people  pick  themes  for  their  host- names, such as superheroes, and name each computer on their network  after a superhero  Superman, Batman, Spiderman, and so on . Think of a  fun hostname theme you can use. For many people, this ends up being the  hardest part of the installation process!  In the next box, set a username for yourself  the installer will provide a  suggestion based on your full name . Your username should be something  easy to remember. Many people either use their ﬁ rst name or add an initial  to their ﬁ rst or last name  such as jbacon or jonob . Each username on  your computer must be unique—you cannot have two accounts with the  same username. Usernames must begin with a lowercase letter—only low- ercase letters and numbers are permitted after that.  In the next two boxes, add a password and then conﬁ rm it. This password  is used when you log in to your computer with the username you just cre- ated. When choosing a password, follow these simple guidelines.    Make sure you can remember your password. If you need to write it    down, keep it somewhere secure. Don’t make the mistake of putting  the password somewhere easily accessible and known to others.    Avoid using dictionary words  “real words”  such as “chicken” or    “beard” when choosing a password, and try to input numbers and  punctuation.    Your password should ideally be longer than six letters and contain a     combination of letters, symbols, and numbers. The longer the  password and the more it mixes uppercase and lowercase letters,  numbers, and symbols, the more secure it is.  Here you also have a couple of other options. The ﬁ rst decision is whether  you wish to log in automatically or to require a password to log in each  time you boot up your computer. By default, it’s recommended that you  require a password, so that option is selected. You also have the option to  encrypt your home folder. Select this option to make the contents unread- able without a password. This option can make your system more secure,  but note that if you lose the password, your data will be unrecoverable.      Booting and Installing   51  When you have added all the information, click Continue.  To learn more about the cool things in your new operating system, view  the slide show that appears as installation ﬁ nishes  Figure 2-11 .  Finishing Up From here, as the Ubuntu software continues to be installed on your com- puter, you are shown a slide show containing useful and interesting infor- mation  about  the  operating  system. At  the  end  of  this  process,  you  are  asked to restart your computer. You are now ﬁ nished and can skip ahead to  Chapter 3 to get started with using Ubuntu.  TIP   Better Use of Your Valuable, Valuable Time One of the great beneﬁ ts of the desktop live DVD installer is that while the ﬁ les are being  copied from the disk, you can still use the system. Instead of sitting at your computer star- ing at the progress bar, you can play a few games to while away the time.  Figure 2-11  Slide show users can watch as installation ﬁ nishes to ﬁ nd out more  about Ubuntu.   52   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  Installing from the Minimal CD Although the desktop DVD is ideal for installing Ubuntu, you may want to  use the traditional installer method to install the system. This .iso ﬁ le is  smaller  typically 40–50MB  and downloads the components required for  Ubuntu during installation.  You can ﬁ nd the download link for the latest Minimal CD by visiting help .ubuntu.com community Installation MinimalCD.  This method involves booting the Minimal CD, running through the in- staller, selecting what you wish to install  i.e., Ubuntu desktop , and then  starting  the  system.  This  kind  of  installer  is  ideal  for  installation  of  the  Ubuntu OS on older hardware.  To get started, put the CD in the drive and restart your computer.  Select the Install option with the arrow keys, and press Enter. After a few  moments, the installation process begins by asking you to choose a lan- guage. Select from the different languages by using the up and down arrow  keys,  and  then  use  the  Tab  key  to  jump  to  the  red  buttons  to  continue  through the setup.  TIP   Installing a Server You can obtain a third version of Ubuntu that is especially tailored for server environments.  For more information about this version, see www.ubuntu.com server, or read Chapter 8 for  more details about running Ubuntu as a server.  Choosing Your Spot in the World Next you need to pick which country you are in, again pressing Enter to  accept your choice.  Now  you  need  to  select  your  keyboard  layout.  Keyboard  layouts  vary  across the world to take into account the many and varied symbols and  letters used in different countries. Even if you are using the typical Latin  character  set   as  used  in  most  European  countries,  the  United  States,   Africa, and  Australia , there are variations and additions  e.g., German       Installing from the Minimal CD   53   umlauts .  You  can  let  Ubuntu  detect  your  layout  for  you,  or  you  can  choose from a list of options. If you want your layout detected, you will be  asked a series of questions until a guess can be made. If the guess is wrong,  you can repeat the process. Otherwise, choose your keyboard layout from  the options available.  Hardware Next, the system will attempt to load the rest of the installer and to detect  hardware.  In  most  situations,  this  happens  without  prompting  you  for  anything, although sometimes you might need to provide input such as  choosing a primary network device. Once this is set up, your computer  will also conﬁ gure itself with your local network—if possible. If it cannot  conﬁ gure itself with a local network, it will inform you of this failure and  you’ll have the option of conﬁ guring the network connection manually or  choosing to not conﬁ gure it at that time. A network connection is required  to complete this install, but you can always come back and change the net- work conﬁ guration later once the installation is done.  Setting the Hostname and Time Zone You are next asked for a hostname for the computer.  Use the text box to add your own hostname, or use the default Ubuntu  hostname if required. Feel free to let your imagination go wild, and create  a theme for your hostnames  such as superheroes .  After choosing a hostname, you will be asked to select an Ubuntu mirror  and deﬁ ne your HTTP proxy information—if you don’t know what that is,  you likely don’t have a proxy. Once this step is complete, the install program  will download some components required to continue the installation.  Conﬁ guring a User The next part of the installation routine conﬁ gures a user for the com- puter. This user role is important because it not only can be used as a  normal user, but also has the ability to use sudo to perform system admin- istrator tasks.   54   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  You are ﬁ rst asked to enter a full name for the user  such as Elizabeth K.  Joseph . Next you are asked for a username, or one will be picked for you  from your full name  such as elizabeth . If you want another username,  enter it here. Finally, you are asked to enter a password for the user and  asked to repeat the password for veriﬁ cation.  QUICK TIP  A good password will contain at least eight characters, will use both uppercase and lower- case letters, will include at least one number, will include at least one nonletter character   such as & or @ , will not spell a word that can be found in a dictionary, and will be easy for  you to remember while being difﬁ cult for others to guess. A modiﬁ ed phrase can work well;  for example, something like Gimme@x3ss could work well, although that one may still be a  bit too obvious  “give me access” is not much better than “password” .  The next screen will give you the option to encrypt your home folder. Say  “yes” to make the contents of that folder unreadable without a password.  Note that if you lose the password, your data will be unrecoverable.  Time Zone Using the network, the installer will then attempt to detect your time zone.  Select Yes if this is correct, or No to manually select a city from your time  zone from a list.  Creating Partitions The system will then read your disks to ﬁ nd out the current partition in- formation. You will be asked to create or select partitions for Ubuntu to  install on to. Creating partitions is the most challenging part of the instal- lation routine. Before you partition your disk, think about how your parti- tions should be organized.  You are given a number of partition options:    Guided—Use Entire Disk      Guided—Use Entire Disk and Set Up LVM      Guided—Use Entire Disk and Set Up Encrypted LVM      Manual        Installing from the Minimal CD   55  In most cases, you probably want to use the Guided—Use Entire Disk op- tion. This will erase everything on the hard drive in your computer and set  everything up for you. The second option, Guided—Use Entire Disk and  Set  Up  LVM,  allows  you  to  use  the  Logical Volume  Manager.  The  third  choice is identical to the second option but also employs disk encryption,  which will keep your data safer and more secure in some circumstances.  Finally, if you want to set up speciﬁ c partitions, use the Manual option.  Let’s look at each of these options in turn and how they are used.  Guided—Use Entire Disk  When you select this option, your entire disk  is partitioned automatically. The installer tells you that a primary and log- ical partition will be created, and then it asks if you want to go ahead and  create the partitions. Click Yes, and you are done.  Guided—Use Entire Disk and Set Up LVM  Conﬁ guring LVM is covered  in Chapter 8.  Guided—Use Entire Disk and Set Up Encrypted LVM  Conﬁ guring LVM  is identical to the previous option except that it also uses a secure encryp- tion layer to provide additional security and protection for your data. If  you choose this option, during the process you will be asked to provide a  passphrase. Be very careful to choose one that is impossible to guess but  that you will also remember. You will need to use this passphrase to access  your data every time you boot the computer; if you lose or forget the pass- phrase, all your data will be permanently inaccessible. There is no way to  recover a lost or forgotten encryption passphrase.  TIP   Disk Encryption You may also decide to encrypt speciﬁ c partitions manually. Simply choose “Use Physical  Volume for Encryption” in the “Use As:” option. Note: You never want to encrypt the boot  partition.  Manual  Select  this  option  if  you  want  to  create  your  own  partitions  manually. Here you can create a number of different types of partitions,  set their sizes, and conﬁ gure their properties. Creating these partitions is  not done in the same graphical way as the live CD installer, so it is a little    56   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  more  complex.  However,  doing  so  is  still  largely  a  process  of  selecting  something and pressing Enter.  Depending on your conﬁ guration  and the options you selected , you are  given a number of options from which to choose:    Conﬁ gure Software RAID      Conﬁ gure the Logical Volume Manager      Conﬁ gure Encrypted Volumes      Conﬁ gure ISCSI Volumes      Guided Partitioning    QUICK TIP  Software RAID and the Logical Volume Manager are covered in Chapter 8.  Your disk is listed below these options, and it may display a few existing  partitions.  If  you  want  to  delete  the  existing  partitions,  select  each  one,  press Enter, and select Delete the Partition. When you have deleted some  partitions, you should see a free space line. The free space line is used to  create new partitions. If the disk was empty already and you don’t see a  free space line, select the hard disk and press Enter. When asked if you  want to create an empty partition table, click Yes. You should now see the  free space line.  To create a new partition, select the free space line and press Enter. In the  next screen, click Create a New Partition and press Enter. Now enter the  size the partition should be. You can use gigabytes  GB  and megabytes   MB  to indicate size. For example, 4.2GB is 4.2 gigabytes, and 100MB is  100 megabytes. You can also use a percentage or just add  max to use the  entire disk. Add the size, and then press the Tab key to select Continue.  Press Enter. You are next asked whether the partition should be primary or  logical. It is likely that you will want a primary partition. Make your choice  and continue.      Installing from the Minimal CD   57  If this is the ﬁ rst partition, you are asked if the partition should appear at  the beginning or the end of the disk. It is recommended that when creat- ing the root partition  known as    on older computers, it should be placed  at the beginning of the disk. This gets around some potential BIOS prob- lems on older hardware. On newer computers, this is no longer a problem,  and you can put the partition anywhere you like on the disk.  On  the  next  screen,  you  can  conﬁ gure  some  settings  for  the  partition.   Table 2-1 describes these settings.  When the partition is conﬁ gured, choose the Done Setting Up the Parti- tion option.  Table 2-1  Partition Settings  Setting   Use as     Description   This is the type of ﬁ lesystem. For a normal   Ubuntu system, ext4 is recommended.   Format the partition     This setting appears when editing an   existing partition.   This speciﬁ es which part of the ﬁ lesystem will   live on the partition. See the earlier discussion  in this chapter for details about the kind of  partitions you should set up.   A number of options can be passed to the  mount point, although the default setting should be ﬁ ne.   A text label describes the partition. Usually   it is set to the same value as the mount point.         Reserved blocks     This is the percentage of the ﬁ lesystem   reserved for the superuser; 5% is a good default.   5.00%  This option can be used to optimize how the   ﬁ lesystem is organized, although the standard  setting is typically used.   Does this partition contain the kernel and   bootloader? If this is the root partition   known as   , set this ﬂ ag to on.  standard  on  Mount point         Mount options       Label     Typical usage       Bootable ﬂ ag       Example  ext4  yes   defaults   58   Chapter 2       Installing Ubuntu  You can now select free space again  if there is free space left, of course   to create another partition on the disk. When you have ﬁ nished partition- ing, click the Finish Partitioning and Write Changes to Disk option.  The system will now install the minimal Ubuntu base system to your newly  partitioned disk. Because this operation involves downloading software,  its  speed  will  depend  on  the  speed  of  your  network,  in  addition  to  the  speed of your disk drive and computer. Once this process is complete, you  will be asked whether you want to have updates installed automatically.  You will now be presented with the Software Selection screen, which will  determine what you wish to install. To install the standard Ubuntu operat- ing system, scroll down through the list and select Ubuntu desktop. If you  would rather install a server version of Ubuntu, or one of the ﬂ avors like  Xubuntu instead, you can do it from this screen.  Finishing Up The installer will now download all of the packages required for your se- lection and install them. Depending on the speed of your network, com- puter, and disk drive, this installation could take some time.  Once this process is complete, you will be prompted to install the GRUB  bootloader and to decide whether your system clock will be set to UTC. It’s  typically ﬁ ne to accept both of these choices without altering them. The  install is complete at this point, and you can follow the instructions to re- move the CD and reboot your computer.  Summary In this chapter, we outlined several methods for installing Ubuntu. Once  this task is complete, you are ready to move on to more interesting topics.  The next chapter will help you get started.   3  C H A P T E R   3 Getting Started with Ubuntu    Getting Acquainted with Unity     Using Applications     Using Ubuntu in Your Language      Conﬁ guring a Printer     Keeping Your Computer Updated     Adding and Removing Programs and Packages     Upgrading to the Next Ubuntu Release     Ubuntu and Multimedia     Backing Up     Customizing Ubuntu’s Look and Feel      Unity in Other Devices      Summary        59     WITH UBUNTU INSTALLED AND ready to go, it’s time to get started using your  new operating system. Unlike other operating systems, such as Microsoft  Windows  or  Mac  OS  X,  Ubuntu  includes  everything  you  need  to  get  started: an ofﬁ ce suite, media tools, a Web browser, an e-mail client, and  more. Now that the installation is complete, you are up and running with- out having to install any additional software.   Different people use their computers in different ways, and every user has  his or her own personal preference for look and feel. Recognizing this de- sire, Linux has the capability to use any of a number of different graphical  interfaces.  This  ﬂ exibility,  combined  with  the  ballooning  popularity  of   Linux and open source software, has resulted in literally hundreds of dif- ferent graphical environments springing up, each covering these different  types of users and ways of working.  Even though there is a huge range of environments available, there are  two clear leaders: KDE and GNOME. Both of these environments pro- vide a good-looking, comprehensive, and easy-to-use desktop, but they  differ in how that desktop is used as well as in how further personaliza- tion can take place.   The  KDE  system  aims  for  complete  control  and  conﬁ gurability  of  the  desktop. Any desktop conﬁ guration options that exist are available to the  user, who has easy access and can change the behavior and look of almost  everything.   The competing GNOME desktop takes its inspiration from both Windows  and Mac OS X and sets a priority on simplicity and ease of use. GNOME is  also easy to customize, but the less common options are either eliminated  or well hidden to prevent user overload.   Ubuntu  users  are  blessed  with  the  choice  of  either  desktop,  along  with   several  other  options.  Many  of  these  environments  are  mentioned  in  Chapter 9.  TIP   The Ubuntu Desktop Is Unity When reading about Ubuntu, you may see terms like Unity and Ubuntu desktop used inter- changeably.  The  Ubuntu  community,  with  sponsorship  from  Canonical,  has  created  the   60   Getting Acquainted with Unity   61  Unity desktop as the next stage in graphical interface evolution. Time will tell if other Linux  distributions follow suit or if they choose to use one of the other existing options.  The Ubuntu desktop is called Unity. The intention behind Unity was to  create a user interface that would be similar in design terms between dif- ferent devices: desktop, phone, tablet, and TV. This will help with the ulti- mate purpose of Ubuntu—that is, achieving convergence between all of  these devices.  In this chapter, we help you get started with Unity, the default desktop for  Ubuntu, and show how you can use it to do the normal things you face  every day with your computer and a few not-so-normal things. This in- cludes opening and running applications, managing your ﬁ les, adjusting  the look and feel, using applications, managing your media, and more.  Getting Acquainted with Unity When you start your Ubuntu system, you are presented with a list of users.  Once you select your name from the list, you are asked for a password to  log in with. In the last chapter, you speciﬁ ed a user account when installing  the system, so use that account to log in. First select your name, and then  type your password and press Enter. Your password will appear as a series  of asterisks  * . This is a security feature.  After a few seconds you will see the Ubuntu desktop appear. Your desktop  will look like Figure 3-1.  You may have noticed that, unlike with other operating systems, there are  no icons on the Unity desktop. The reason for this is that desktop icons  typically are presented by applications, and, as such, you can’t get at them.  Finding and Running Applications with the Launcher To ﬁ nd or run an application, you use the Launcher. The Launcher sits on  the left of the screen. This icon bar shows icon links for applications and  indicates with a small arrow which applications are currently open. The  Launcher also has a few other handy features.   62   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Figure 3-1  Ubuntu Unity  Figure 3-2  The  Unity Launcher  with the Ubuntu  logo at the top  To ﬁ nd an application in Unity, click the Ubuntu logo at the top  of the Launcher at the left side of the desktop  Figure 3-2  or  press the Super  Windows  key.  This opens the Dash, which is the main method for ﬁ nding pro- grams,  folders,  and  ﬁ les  on  your  computer,  as  well  as  many  other  things  such  as  music  ﬁ les,  videos,  or Wikipedia  articles  and other online sources. At the bottom of the Dash is a row of  icons called Lenses. Each Lens helps you focus your search in a  different way. Any time the Dash is open, you can begin to type  the name of a program, folder, or ﬁ le, and it will automatically  search for matches as you type  Figure 3-3 . You don’t even have  to know the exact name because the search also looks for near  matches and similar names; it even does some semantic match- ing by searching program descriptions and some ﬁ le contents.  Some of the Dash Lenses include predeﬁ ned ﬁ lters to further  narrow your search  Figure 3-4 . Click Filter Results at the up- per right of the Dash Lens to view the available ﬁ lters.      Getting Acquainted with Unity   63  Figure 3-3  The Dash with sorted results from a partial search  Figure 3-4  The Dash Applications Lens with Filter Results shown    64   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Other Lenses are available beyond those installed by default. Later in this  chapter, you will learn how to use the Ubuntu Software Center. You can  ﬁ nd additional Lenses there by searching with the terms unity lens.  Other Icons in the Launcher In addition to the Ubuntu logo icon described earlier, the Launcher in- cludes several useful entries by default. Most are obvious in their intent  and use. Even so, they deserve a quick mention. They are listed here in the  order  they  appear  in  the  Launcher  from  top  to  bottom,  albeit  skipping  some more obvious entries.    Home Folder: This icon opens your home folder using the ﬁ le     manager, which is described next. Your home folder is where all of  your personal ﬁ les and folders should be placed.    GNOME Software Center: This icon opens your primary software     management system for Ubuntu, which is described later in the  chapter.    Workplace Switcher: Once enabled, this tool allows you to have four     different screens open on your desktop, with different programs  active in each, and switch between them. This feature is very helpful if  you tend to have many things open at once and run out of space on  your screen. Click it to show all of your desktop workspaces  it also  shows you what is open in each, which is convenient . As an example,  you may be using your Web browser and e-mail client while talking to  your friends in a chat client on the ﬁ rst desktop and working on a  document on the second desktop. You can just click each virtual  desktop to switch to it to access your different applications. Click the  desktop you want to use. Essentially, this expands the screen real  estate you have available and creates an easy way to keep many  programs open without their blocking one another. To enable  workspaces on your system, go to the Dash and search for Appear- ance. On the behavior tab, click the checkbox for Enable Workspaces.    Trash: This is where ﬁ les you throw away go until you empty the     Trash to remove them permanently. Files dragged onto this icon or  right-clicked and moved to trash are destined to be deleted. To fully  delete these ﬁ les, right-click the Trash and select Empty Trash.      Getting Acquainted with Unity   65  TIP   You can switch between multiple applications in Ubuntu just like in Windows by pressing  Alt-Tab. When you press this key combination, a small window appears that can be used to  switch between active applications on the current workspace. You can also use Alt+Tilde  ~   to switch between different windows of the current application.  Using Applications When applications are loaded, the window border has three buttons on  the top on the left-hand side:    Orange button with a black X: This button closes the application.      Gray button with a black –: This button minimizes the application,     taking it off of your screen, and puts it in the Launcher for easy access  when you need it again.    Gray button with a black square: This button is used to maximize    the window so that it takes up the full desktop area. Not all applica- tion windows use this button, so don’t be surprised if you don’t see it  for an application that has a small window.  Every application that is currently in use has an entry in the Launcher on  the left of the desktop. You can click these entries to minimize or restore  the application, and you can right-click to see some other options, such as  one to keep the program icon listed in the Launcher at all times. This is  available so that you simply need to click the icon to start the program  rather than search for it in the Dash, which makes it convenient for fre- quently used programs.  Any menus with options that exist for a program currently in use in the  foreground will appear in the top panel of the desktop. When you switch  programs,  the  contents  of  the  top  panel  will  change  accordingly.  Hover  over the name of the program at the top of a screen and wait for a list of  menus to appear. Click any one to see a drop-down list of options.   TIP   You can change the settings of the menus, so menus of nonmaximized applications appear  on the top border of their respective windows. To modify these settings, search for Appear- ance on the Dash. On the Behavior tab, change the selected option from “In top bar” to “In  window tile bars.”   66   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Managing Files and Folders When using your computer, you often need to open and save ﬁ les and  folders,  move  them  around,  and  perform  other  tasks.  Click  the  Home  Folder icon from the Launcher to open the ﬁ le manager. Here are some  of the main folders you will ﬁ nd contained in your home folder by de- fault  Figure 3-5 :    Desktop: This folder contains ﬁ les that visually appear on your     desktop as icons. If you drag a ﬁ le onto your desktop, it appears in the  Desktop folder. Similarly, moving a ﬁ le out of this folder or deleting it  removes it from your desktop.    Documents: This folder is intended to contain word processing ﬁ les     and other documents you create.    Downloads: This folder is intended to contain items you download     from the Internet.    Music: This folder is intended to contain music ﬁ les.      Pictures: This folder is intended to contain image ﬁ les.    Figure 3-5  The main ﬁ le manager window, open to the home folder      Getting Acquainted with Unity   67    Public: This folder holds ﬁ les that you want other users on your     system or network to be able to access. The permissions on this folder  are set differently, as by default all the other folders and their contents  may be accessed and opened only by you.    Templates: This folder is intended to contain templates for applica-    tions like your word processor.    Videos: This folder is intended to contain visual media ﬁ les.    To the left of the ﬁ le manager is a menu with several options. Most are re- peats of commonly used folders listed previously. These deserve further  mention:    Computer: Allows you to browse the other ﬁ les and folders on your    system that are not contained in your home folder and that you have  permission to view.    Trash: Where ﬁ les you throw away go, until you empty the Trash to     remove them permanently.    Connect to Server: Runs a wizard to create a connection to a     network server; you will need to know the name of the server you  want to connect to, and some details about it like the port being  used. Use this feature to add an icon to the desktop that, when  clicked, provides a list of remote ﬁ les in the desktop ﬁ le manager. You  can then treat this window like any other ﬁ le manager window and  drag ﬁ les back and forth. This is really useful for copying ﬁ les to and  from other computers.  TIP   Usability and the Ubuntu Desktop Throughout the development of the Ubuntu desktop, great care and attention have gone into  ensuring usability. As an example, the corners of the screen are established as areas that are  simple to access—you don’t need to carefully mouse over the area, but instead can just  throw your mouse to the appropriate corner. This is why important features are found in  corners; this approach makes accessing each feature a little bit easier.  Ubuntu is ﬁ lled with tiny usability improvements such as this that help make using it as intu- itive and powerful as possible. Canonical has created a collective project called Ayatana to  spearhead  this  development.  More  on  Ayatana  can  be  found  at  https:  wiki.ubuntu.com  Ayatana.   68   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Adding Additional Users Many  computers  these  days  are  used  by  more  than  one  person.  Rather  than  forcing  everyone  to  use  the  same  desktop  settings  or  making  the  computer less secure by allowing everyone who uses it to have access to  administrative functions, it is easy and recommended to create an account  for every person who will use the computer. This allows each user to cus- tomize how the computer works and looks without interfering with any- one else’s preferences, and it allows you to grant administrator privileges  to only certain users to prevent others from accessing functions that may  affect everyone or even damage the installation if used incorrectly.  Open the Dash and search for User Accounts. The dialog box that appears  contains a list of current users. Click Unlock at the upper-right corner of  the window to make changes. Next, click the “+” symbol at the bottom of  the user list or Add to create a new account, as in Figure 3-6.  TIP   A password is required to make changes to users and groups, and only those users with  administrative access are able to do so. Click the Lock Unlock button to enter your password  and make changes.  You must now provide a full name for the new user and a short username  that will be used by that user to log in. Click OK, and in the next dialog   Figure 3-6  The User Settings dialog      Getting Acquainted with Unity   69  box, enter a password for that user, conﬁ rm the password by entering it a  second time, and click OK again.   Once your user account is created, you may customize your login options  and click the Password ﬁ eld to set a password, allow the user to log in with- out a password, or enable the account without setting a password. Allow- ing a user to log in without a password or automatically is not generally a  good idea but can be useful. For example, if the users are small children  who are not expected to perform administrative tasks, the children could  have an account that automatically logs in at boot time, and the adminis- trator would have an additional account, accessed by a password, to per- form changes and updates when necessary.  Finally, now that the account is created, you can customize its settings. To  do so, highlight the account name in the list, and click the ﬁ eld at the right  next to Account Type.  If you prefer to do this from the terminal, use the adduser command while  logged in to an account with administrative privileges:  matt@laptop:~$ sudo adduser corey  After you enter your password, this command will add a new user named  corey. You will be asked several questions in this process. Answer them,  and at the end, the account will be created.  To  delete  a  user  from  the  command  line,  use  the  deluser  command  in  place of adduser in the preceding example. You will learn more about deal- ing with users from the command line in Chapter 7.  The Notiﬁ cation Area On the right-hand side of the top of the desktop is the notiﬁ cation area  and the clock. The notiﬁ cation area is similar to the Windows system tray  in that it provides a series of small icons that indicate something speciﬁ c. A  good example of this is Network Manager, which looks after your network  connections—both wired and wireless—for you.   70   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  You can adjust the notiﬁ cation area items by right-clicking them to view a  context  menu.  Some  icons   such  as  the  volume  control   allow  you  to  left-click  on  them  to  view  them.  As  an  example,  try  clicking  the  little  speaker icon and adjusting the slider.  TIP   Select Sound Settings to access a large number of sound settings. These settings conﬁ gure  the speakers, microphone, line-in, any other sound card inputs or outputs, and more.  Network  Manager  Network  Manager  is  a  network  interface  that  helps  you manage your network devices and connections; it is accessed using the  network manager applet. The goal is to make networking “just work” eas- ily and without requiring users to know how to hand-conﬁ gure the set- tings  although that functionality is still available for those who want to do  so . A left-click of the mouse on the applet shows you the dialog box and  enables  quick  changes  between  network  types.  It  even  provides  an  easy  way  to  set  up  access  through  a  virtual  private  network   VPN ,  such  as  many of us are required to use to securely access ﬁ les from work or school.  You can also enable or disable both wired and wireless networking, see in- formation about your current connection, and edit connections quickly  and easily  Figure 3-7 .  The Clock  Next to the notiﬁ cation area is the clock. Click on the clock to  view a calendar.  Figure 3-7  The Network Manager applet, left-clicked to show connections menu      Getting Acquainted with Unity   71  TIP   Customize your clock by clicking it and selecting Time & Date Settings.  The Gear Menu  Click the Gear at the top right of the screen to access  these options  Figure 3-8 :    About This Computer: This button displays a window that provides     information about your computer, such as the Ubuntu version it  runs, its RAM size, processor, OS type, and more.    Ubuntu Help: Here you will ﬁ nd the Ubuntu Desktop Guide, which     provides help guides for most system applications.           System Settings: This option opens a window from which you can  adjust your computer according to your needs or preferences.  Options include Keyboard Layouts, Screen and Display settings,  Printers, Power, Sound, and much more.  Log Out: This option lets you log out of the current session and go  back to the main login screen.  Suspend: If your computer supports it, this option will be included in  the list, and you can click it to save the current state of your system in  RAM. Then, the next time your computer is turned on, the desktop  session will be resumed at the point where you left off. This option  continues to use power, but only a minimal amount.    Restart: Click this to restart your computer.       Shut Down: Click this to shut down your computer.  Figure 3-8  Ahh, the possibilities . . .           72   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Using Applications Now that you have become familiar with the desktop, let’s explore some of  the many applications included on your new system. By default, Ubuntu  comes with a wide range of popular and established applications to listen  to music, watch videos, create documents, browse the Web, manage your  appointments, read your e-mail, create images, and much more. These ap- plications have been vetted by the developers to ensure they are the best- of-breed Linux applications available.  Although Ubuntu includes a range of software applications, it is likely you  will want to install extra applications and explore other available software.  Fortunately,  the  Ubuntu  system  is  built  on  a  powerful  foundation  that  makes  software  installation  as  simple  as  pointing  and  clicking  in  the  Ubuntu Software Center, covered later in this chapter.  TIP   Another Way to Run Applications Although you will most typically start your applications by selecting them from the Applica- tions menu, you can also press Alt-F2  on Mac hardware, press Fn-Alt-F2  to bring up the  “Run a command” box where you can type in the name of an application and run it.  Browsing the Web with Firefox Firefox is the default Ubuntu Web browser and provides you with a sim- ple, safe, and powerful browsing experience. Firefox was developed by Mo- zilla and has become one of the most successful open source projects in  the world; it continues to garner huge popularity. With hundreds of mil- lions of downloads and rapidly increasing browser share, Firefox has been  an unparalleled success.  TIP   You can learn more about Mozilla and Firefox, as well as their other software products, at  www.mozilla.org.  Click the Firefox icon in the Launcher or open the Dash and search for  Firefox to begin. This will open the main Firefox window  Figure 3-9 .      Using Applications   73  Figure 3-9  The Firefox interface is sleek but extensible.  Firefox looks similar to most Web browsers and includes the usual back,  forward, reload, and stop buttons; an address bar; and some menus. These  familiar-looking  elements  help  you  become  acquainted  with  Firefox.  If  you have used Internet Explorer, Opera, Chrome, or Safari before, you will  have no problems using Firefox.  Navigating your way around the Internet is no different in Firefox than in  any other browser: just type the Web address into the address bar and press  Enter. Firefox also has a few nice features that make it easy to access your  favorite sites. As an example, if you want to visit the Ubuntu Web site, you  can just enter www.ubuntu.com  you can leave off http:   . Alternatively,  you can just type in Ubuntu, and Firefox will do the equivalent of going to  the Google Web site, entering Ubuntu as the search term, and taking you to  the ﬁ rst result for the search. This feature is incredibly handy for popular  sites that are likely to appear at the top of the search results page.   74   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  TIP   The search box next to the address bar can be used to do searches. By default, these searches  take place on Google. To do a Google search, just type in your search term and press Enter.  You can also click the down arrow next to the Google box next to the address bar and select  from a variety of other sites to search, including sites like Amazon.com and Wikipedia.  This search box can be used to search just about anything. To add more search engines,  click the small icon and then select Manage Search Engines.  Bookmarking Your Favorite Sites  To bookmark the page you are view- ing,  hover  over  Firefox  Web  Browser  to  display  the  menu.  Click  Book- marks > Bookmark This Page or press Ctrl-D. In the drop-down box that  pops up, use the combo box to select the folder to store the bookmark in.  You also have the option to add “tags” to your bookmark, which are like  keywords that can be used to sort and search for your bookmarks in the  future. When you have ﬁ nished naming and tagging your bookmark, click  Done to save the bookmark.  TIP   Save Time with Live Bookmarks Firefox also includes a special feature called live bookmarks that automatically grabs content  from a Web site without your needing to visit it. As an example, go to http:  fridge.ubuntu .com  a popular Ubuntu news site , and select the Bookmarks menu, Subscribe to This Page,  and Subscribe to Ubuntu Fridge >> Feed. You will be taken to a new page that previews the  feed and gives you the option of what you would like to use to subscribe to it. Use the default  option  Live Bookmarks , and click Subscribe Now. A dialog box will pop up. Use the default  values provided and click OK. If you enable the Bookmarks Toolbar, you will see that a new  toolbar button is added; when you click on it, a list of the items from the Web site is dis- played. Each time you start Firefox, it will quietly go away and update this list so that you  don’t need to visit the site yourself. The “Latest Headlines” toolbar entry is an example of  this functionality.  TIP   If You Liked the Fridge You may also like Planet Ubuntu at http:  planet.ubuntu.com. This site collects the per- sonal blogs of a number of different Ubuntu developers and other community members.  Planet Ubuntu gives a unique insight into what the developers are working on and or inter- ested in.  Bolt It on, Make It Cool  Although Firefox is already a powerful and ﬂ exi- ble Web browser, it can be extended even further using special plug-in ex-      Using Applications   75  tensions. These extensions cover not only typical browsing needs but also  other more specialized extras that extend the browser itself.  If you visit a site that requires a normal Web plug-in, a pop-up will appear,  indicating that you are missing a plug-in necessary to take full advantage  of the page you are visiting. Click the Install Missing Plug-ins button to  grab the required plug-in. For example, Ubuntu does not come with the  Adobe Flash plug-in because it does not live up to Ubuntu software free- dom requirements. As a result, you will have the option to install either  Adobe Flash or the free software version Gnash if you want to use Flash.  To extend the browser itself with additional features, go to https:  addons .mozilla.org and browse for an extension that you are interested in. When  you  ﬁ nd  something  you  would  like  to  install,  select Add  to  Firefox  and  then click the Install Now button. A dialog box will pop up, asking you to  conﬁ rm  the  installation.  Click  Install  Now.  Your  new  extension  will  be  downloaded and installed automatically. Typically, after you restart Fire- fox, your new extension is available.  TIP   Be Careful When Choosing Sites from Which to Download Extensions It is recommended that you download extensions only from http:  addons.mozilla.org. If you  do need to install an extension from another site, make sure it is a site you trust. Otherwise,  the extension may contain unsafe software, viruses, or spyware.  Creating Documents with LibreOfﬁ ce Included with Ubuntu is a full ofﬁ ce suite called LibreOfﬁ ce. This compre- hensive collection contains applications for creating word processing docu- ments, spreadsheets, and presentations installed by default with the ability to  easily manipulate and create databases, drawings, and mathematical equa- tions—all just a click away. The suite provides an extensive range of func- tionality, including reading and writing Microsoft Ofﬁ ce ﬁ le formats, and  can also export documents as Web pages, PDF ﬁ les, and even animations.  TIP   History of LibreOfﬁ ce Years ago, a company called Sun Microsystems acquired an ofﬁ ce suite called StarOfﬁ ce  when it bought the company that developed it, StarDivision. Sun Microsystems continued  to develop StarOfﬁ ce as a proprietary ofﬁ ce suite, but a few years later released an open    76   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  source version called OpenOfﬁ ce.org. OpenOfﬁ ce.org had slightly fewer features, but was  still very mature and gathered a large following. When Sun Microsystems was bought by  Oracle, some developers were unhappy with the direction in which the new company was  leading development. Because the code was open source, these developers were able to  create what is called a fork—a project that is based on the same open source code up to  that  point,  but  that  then  diverges  for  all  future  development.  This  new  ofﬁ ce  suite  is  called LibreOfﬁ ce.  Let’s give LibreOfﬁ ce a whirl by creating a letter with it. Start LibreOfﬁ ce’s  word processor, LibreOfﬁ ce Writer, by clicking Dash Home in the Launcher  and  then  searching  for LibreOfﬁ ce. When  it  has  loaded,  you  will  be  pre- sented with the interface shown in Figure 3-10.  If you have used a word processing program before, you will notice that  many of the interface elements, such as the buttons for setting font type   Figure 3-10  LibreOfﬁ ce looks similar to Microsoft Ofﬁ ce, so if you are familiar with Ofﬁ ce,  you will ﬁ nd it quite a simple matter to adjust to the LibreOfﬁ ce interface.      Using Applications   77  and size, bold, italic, underline, and alignment, look and behave the same  as in other programs. The LibreOfﬁ ce developers have designed the suite  to be easy to migrate to if you have used a program like Microsoft Ofﬁ ce in  the past. After a few minutes spent playing with LibreOfﬁ ce, you will be  conﬁ dent that you can ﬁ nd the functions you need.  Start your letter by ﬁ rst choosing a nice font. In the font combo box, you  should  see  Liberation  Serif   which  is  a  free-as-in-liberty  font  similar  to  Times  selected as the default. You can click the box and choose another  font  if  you  prefer,  such  as  the  lovely  DejaVu  Sans  or  the  Ubuntu  font.  Change the font size by clicking the combo box to the right of the font box  and selecting 10  points  as the size. With the cursor on the left side of the  page, add your home address to the letter.  Now press Enter to leave a blank line under the address, and click the Align  Right toolbar button  the icon looks like some lines aligned to the right . If  you are unsure of what a button does, hover your mouse over it to pop up  a tool tip. Now add the address of the recipient to your letter.  Press Enter again to leave a blank line, and type the main body of the letter.  Feel free to use the bold, italic, and underline buttons to add emphasis to  your words. You can also use other toolbar buttons to add items such as  bullet points and numbered lists and to change the color of the font. If you  want  to  add  features  such  as  graphics,  tables,  special  characters,  and  frames, click the Insert menu and select the relevant item. You can custom- ize each item added to the page by right-clicking the item and using the  options shown in the context menu.  When your letter is complete, you can save it by selecting File > Save, by  clicking the ﬂ oppy disk toolbar icon, or by pressing Ctrl-S. The default ﬁ le  format used by LibreOfﬁ ce is the OpenDocument Format. This ﬁ le format  is an ofﬁ cial open standard that is used across the world. The ﬁ le format is  slightly different for different types of applications  .odt for word proces- sor [Writer] ﬁ les, .ods for spreadsheets [Calc], and so on , but each format  provides  an  open  standard  free  from  vendor  lock-in. You  can  also  save  your ﬁ les in a variety of other formats, including the default formats for  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce.   78   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  TIP   Vendor Lock-In? In the proprietary software world, it is common for each application to have its own closed  ﬁ le format that only the vendor knows how to implement. When a person uses the software  to create documents, the closed format means that only that speciﬁ c tool can read and write  the  format.  As  long  as  you  want  to  access  your  documents,  you  need  that  tool.  This  is  known as vendor lock-in.  To combat this problem, the LibreOfﬁ ce suite  and the vast majority of other open source  applications  uses an open ﬁ le format that is publicly documented. In fact, the format is a  published standard under ISO IEC 26300:3006. As a consequence, other applications can  implement the OpenDocument ﬁ le format, and you can be safe in the knowledge that your  documents will always be available and you are not locked in to any speciﬁ c tool.  Another  useful  feature  wedged  into  LibreOfﬁ ce  is  the  capability  to  save  your documents in the Adobe PDF format. PDF ﬁ les have become increas- ingly used in the last few years and are useful for sending people docu- ments that they should not change  such as invoices . PDF ﬁ les provide a  high-quality copy of the document and are well supported across all oper- ating  systems.  This  makes  PDFs  ideal  for  creating  catalogs,  leaﬂ ets,  and  ﬂ yers. To save a document as a PDF ﬁ le, click the PDF button on the main  toolbar  next to the printer icon . Click the button, enter a ﬁ lename, and  you are done. Simple.  Managing Your E-Mail with Thunderbird Thunderbird is a traditional desktop e-mail client created by Mozilla, the  same  people  responsible  for  the  Firefox  Web  browser.  It  is  the  default  choice  in  Ubuntu  and  works  the  same  as  the  Thunderbird  versions  for  other operating systems. Here is how you set it up.  Open the Dash and search for Thunderbird to get started. When it opens  for the ﬁ rst time, you are presented with an opportunity to create a new  e-mail  address  using  speciﬁ c  services.  If  you  already  have  an  e-mail  ac- count you want to use, select Skip this. A wizard will appear to help you  conﬁ gure Thunderbird  Figure 3-11 .   Enter  your  name,  e-mail  address,  and  password  to  begin.  Thunderbird  performs  a  search  of  a  Mozilla  database  of  Internet  service  providers   ISPs  and attempts to set up the technical aspects for you  Figure 3-12 .  Click Create Account.       Using Applications   79  Figure 3-11  Thunderbird start-up wizard  Figure 3-12  Thunderbird found the details for my domain.  If all goes well, you won’t need to do anything else. If Thunderbird does  not ﬁ nd your ISP, you will need to know your mail server information,  available from your service provider, so that you can conﬁ gure Thunder- bird manually.  From here on, Thunderbird works as e-mail clients have worked for the  last 15 years or so. You can download your e-mail, reply to messages or  send  new  messages,  sort  messages  into  folders,  conﬁ gure  multiple  ac- counts, and so on, all using a clear, standard interface  Figure 3-13 .   80   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Figure 3-13  Thunderbird’s interface is easy to use.   Using Ubuntu in Your Language When you installed Ubuntu, you were asked which language the system  should use. Although this sets the initial language for the system, you may  want to change the language at a later date. To do this, search the Dash for  Language Support.  Ubuntu supports a huge range of different languages, and many applica- tions include a Translate This Application menu option in the Help menu  so that all Ubuntu users can contribute translations in their language s . If  you would like to help with this effort, it is a fantastic contribution to the  Ubuntu project.  When the language selector ﬁ rst loads, it may ask you to update your lan- guage packs. Just click Yes to continue. Inside the dialog box, you will ﬁ nd  a list of the currently installed language packs. Also, a number of languages  are available for installation. To install or remove language packs, click the       Conﬁ guring a Printer   81  Install Remove  Languages  button. You  will  then  see  a  list  of  languages,  each of which has a Support checkbox listed next to it. For each language  that you want to install remove on the system, check the relevant boxes.  When you have selected the boxes, click the Apply button, and the appro- priate language packs are downloaded and installed. Now, choose the lan- guage you want to use as a default from the list, and click Apply System- Wide. You need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.  TIP   Choosing a New Language When you see the login screen, you can use the Language button to choose a language for  that speciﬁ c login session. When you select the language, you are asked if you want to make  it the default language or use it just for that speciﬁ c session.  Conﬁ guring a Printer In  the  Linux  world,  conﬁ guring  a  printer  has  traditionally  been  a  chal- lenge. For years, newcomers to Linux have been repeatedly challenged and  even  bludgeoned  with  scary  terms,  commands,  and  phrases  that  sound  like a language from another planet. Users often had to edit fairly complex  text ﬁ les by hand and spend a good deal of time learning how to insert ar- cane  instructions  just  to  get  a  printer  to  work.  However,  things  have  changed with Ubuntu.  Most  of  the  time  it  is  possible  to  add  or  conﬁ gure  a  printer  easily  and  quickly.  Even  better,  printers  are  sometimes  conﬁ gured  automatically  when plugged in to the system. The one caveat is that not all printer man- ufacturers provide Linux drivers for their devices. While the Linux com- munity works very hard to write drivers, often the newest printer models  do not have adequate software to interact with Linux. Most printer models  that are older than 6 or 9 months seem to work quite well, though.   TIP   You can check before buying a printer to see what other people have experienced by look- ing at the list of models and the state of their drivers at www.openprinting.org printers.  The Linux Foundation maintains that list, which is a pretty good gauge for determining  how well your model should work out of the box with Ubuntu, making this an excellent  resource when shopping for new hardware as well as useful for troubleshooting when  problems are encountered.   82   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  To get started installing your printer, click on the Dash and search for Print- ers. This option brings up the Printers window, as shown in Figure 3-14.  The Printer conﬁ guration window lets you add printers and modify their  settings. In the upcoming example, you will add a new printer and then  view its settings.  Gathering Information The most important thing to remember when conﬁ guring a printer is to  not get ahead of yourself. Before you start clicking on icons and running  anything, make sure you have completed the following steps.  1.  Note the make and model of the printer. This information is usually  printed clearly on the hardware itself. In our example, we add an HP  Photosmart C4700.  2.  Plug the printer in to your computer or to the network, and turn it on.  Launching the Wizard Once you have properly prepared to install your printer, click Add to bring  up  the  New  Printer  window.  The  system  automatically  searches  for  any  new  connected  printers  and  launches  a  New  Printer  wizard,  shown  in   Figure 3-15.  In  most  cases,  the  wizards  can  detect  an  attached  printer  automatically  and will include it in a list of devices on the left. If your printer is plugged   Figure 3-14  The Printers window      Conﬁ guring a Printer   83  Figure 3-15  Selecting a printer  directly into a router, you can have the printer wizard look for it by select- ing Find Network Printer.  Select the device with your printer’s name, and then click Forward.  At this point, you must choose a printer manufacturer. If your printer  has been automatically detected, the wizard will choose a manufacturer.  Click Forward.  In the next screen, you are asked to choose both a model and a driver. For  autodetected printers, both should be automatically selected and the de- fault driver should work. You can always change these choices later. If no  driver is selected, scroll through the list of options, which is organized by  manufacturer.   Sometimes you may not ﬁ nd the exact model or driver for your speciﬁ c  printer. Generally, if the driver does not exist for your exact model, choose  the closest one and then test it. If that doesn’t work, you can try other driv- ers intended for printers from the same manufacturer.   84   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Click Forward to proceed with the installation. If you need to install a cus- tom driver, click the Install Driver button.  Finally, you can enter a description and location for your printer, as shown  in Figure 3-16. Click Apply to complete the process and set up your printer.  Mission Accomplished! After  you  click Apply,  you  will  see  your  printer’s  name  under  the  Local  Printers heading. You can click on it and then print out a test page. Do so,  and make sure the page prints correctly. If you ﬁ nd that the page prints  well, you are ﬁ nished. You can now print from the applications you have  installed, such as LibreOfﬁ ce.  Remote Printing You can also conﬁ gure your Ubuntu system to send print jobs to a remote  print server. If, for example, you have a Windows system with a printer at- tached on your network, simply choose the Network Printer radio button  during conﬁ guration and specify the hostname or IP address of the Win- dows system. You will then have to specify a connection protocol.  Figure 3-16  Entering printer location and description      Keeping Your Computer Updated   85  If  your  Windows  system  is  sharing  a  printer,  you  will  have  to  specify  Samba, which is the standard way to get Linux and Windows systems to  communicate with each other. You will still have to specify a print driver,  as described earlier.  Keeping Your Computer Updated While Ubuntu already includes the things most people need, sometimes  you want or need something extra, such as a desktop publishing applica- tion for school or a game to pass the time. The easiest way to add these ap- plications is with GNOME Software Center, which is extremely simple to  use but has a few limitations. This section also highlights a couple of other  options. Work done using one tool to add or remove software is recognized  by the related tools, so it is okay to mix and match which ones you use.  Using the GNOME Software Center Like the other tools discussed later in this chapter, the GNOME Software  Center installs software from the online Ubuntu software repositories.  To launch the GNOME Software Center, click the Ubuntu Software Center  icon in the Launcher. When it is run for the ﬁ rst time, and occasionally af- terward, it will take a few moments to initialize itself and the list of avail- able  and  installed  applications.  Once  this  is  complete,  you  will  see  the  main screen, shown in Figure 3-17.  Scroll down and click a category to help you reﬁ ne the listing of available  software for speciﬁ c applications, or use the search box at the top center to  ﬁ nd programs using keywords or program names.  The icons at the top of the window give you access to other features or in- formation. You can sort software by source by changing All Software to  one  of  the  other  options,  such  as  Installed.  Click  Installed  to  list  all  in- stalled software.  You can change your software sources by using the menu in the top panel  and selecting Software > Software Sources.   86   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Figure 3-17  GNOME Software Center main screen  By  default,  the  GNOME  Software  Center  shows  all  applications  that  are  supported  by  Ubuntu,  including  those  supported  by  community  volun- teers called MOTUs—short for Masters of the Universe  more on them in  Chapter 11 . Although using the GNOME Software Center to install new  applications from both the ofﬁ cially supported Ubuntu-provided reposito- ries and the community repositories is perfect for most users, sometimes a  more conservative approach to software choices may be appropriate. In this  case, you can limit the number of applications shown from the View menu  by selecting Canonical-Maintained Applications to see only those pieces of  software that are actively watched over and updated by Canonical, the com- pany behind Ubuntu. This restriction is sometimes preferred in corporate  environments that desire or require a stronger guarantee of support.  For many people, this is all you need to know to install or uninstall soft- ware. Chapter 4 goes into a bit more detail for those individuals who are  interested in the technological aspects.      Adding and Removing Programs and Packages   87  Adding and Removing Programs and Packages No operating system or piece of software is perfect. In addition, new fea- tures may be added that users want or need. Because of this, Ubuntu de- velopers periodically release security and other updates to software. These  updates are placed into the Ubuntu repositories and are easy to install.  Most  of  the  updates  to  your  machine  will  be  security  related.  In  other  words, the developers have found a weakness in a particular program in  Ubuntu and have released a ﬁ x for it. A small number of updates also are  released to ﬁ x some critical bugs. For a home user, there is generally no  reason not to install these updates right away, as not installing them might  leave your computer open to security breaches.   TIP   Although Ubuntu is signiﬁ cantly more secure from the main concerns of some operating  systems,  such  as  fears  involving  viruses  and  spyware,  no  computer  is  perfectly  secure  because no software is perfect.   When problems are discovered that could lead to security issues, like buf- fer overﬂ ows or remote exploits, they are ﬁ xed and the updates are released  as quickly as possible, even though the danger is usually remote. Ubuntu  developers also have a very strict policy about not putting newly released  versions of programs with signiﬁ cant and untested function changes or  new features into stable versions of Ubuntu. This practice keeps your sys- tem more stable by not introducing new problems.  Installing Updates Ubuntu checks the Ubuntu repositories once a day to see if there are any  new versions of software you have installed, and it tells you when you need  to update your machine. If security updates exist, a pop-up window will  appear. If other updates are found, they will also be made available. You  can  check  whether  updates  are  available  by  using  the  Software  Updater  application, which can be found on the Dash. The entry there either will  say “Software Up to Date” or will inform you of available updates.  Ubuntu  16.04  handles  package  updates  by  launching  Software  Updater.  Users are notiﬁ ed of security updates on a daily basis and are also notiﬁ ed    88   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  when  new  Ubuntu  versions  are  released.  Because  16.04  is  a  Long-Term  Support  LTS  release, by default it notiﬁ es users about only new LTS re- leases, meaning that it will likely remain silent until April 2018. This be- havior  may  be  changed  by  clicking  Settings  at  the  bottom  left  of  the  Software Updater window.  NOTE   LTS  stands  for  Long-Term  Support,  a  label  that  designates  speciﬁ c  Ubuntu  releases  intended to provide extreme stability and complete support for a longer amount of time  than regular biannual releases. More information about Ubuntu releases is coming later in  this chapter.  Learning about What Was Updated The update window, shown in Figure 3-18, shows you what will be changed.  In the details pane, it indicates what got ﬁ xed and how. It might also list a  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  CVE  number. The CVE number  is  a  unique  identiﬁ er  for  a  security  vulnerability. You  can  look  it  up  on  http:  cve.mitre.org to see what the exact ﬂ aw was. However, most people  don’t need to worry  and really don’t care  about these details.  Figure 3-18  The update window      Adding and Removing Programs and Packages   89  Installing an Application That Is Not in the Repositories Although the repositories contain a huge selection of packages, sometimes  the  package  you  need  is  not  available  there.  The  ﬁ rst  thing  you  should  check is that you have enabled the additional repositories such as universe  and multiverse. You can do this from Software Updater by searching for  these repositories on the Dash. Hover over the GNOME Software Center  to view its menu. Under Software, select Software Sources to ensure that  the boxes are checked for main, universe, restricted, and multiverse.  See  help.ubuntu.com community Repositories Ubuntu for more details.   TIP   The Repository Rundown The universe repository contains the thousands of packages that are part of the Debian dis- tribution upon which Ubuntu is based. All of these packages are entirely free and supported  by a community of Ubuntu contributors.  The multiverse repository contains a number of packages that are freely available to down- load but are not fully open source. If you want to run only open source software, you may  not want to use this repository.  If you have enabled these extra repositories and your package is still not  there, do a quick hunt with a search engine to see if you can ﬁ nd a reposi- tory  known as a Debian or APT repository  for your package. If you ﬁ nd  one, use the Repositories dialog box you have just played with to add the  new repository, and then use Synaptic to install the package.   One common type of extra repository you may encounter is called a per- sonal package archive  PPA . Good information about using PPAs is avail- able at https:  help.launchpad.net Packaging PPA InstallingSoftware.  If no repository is available, look for a Debian package  .deb  for the appli- cation, most likely available from the software company’s Web site. For ex- ample, as Adobe provides a Debian package for its Reader software on its  Web site, and Skype does the same for its VOIP software. If you ﬁ nd such a  .deb package, download it and double-click it to install.  Finally,  if  all  else  fails,  you  may  need  to  download  the  source  code  and  compile it using instructions found at https:  help.ubuntu.com community  CompilingSoftware.   90   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Upgrading to the Next Ubuntu Release One of the original goals for Ubuntu was to have frequent releases. With  only one notable exception  the 6.06 LTS release, which was delayed by  two months , six months has separated each release since 4.10.   This book has been revised to match the latest version—16.04—but an- other release will be along soon. Release 16.04, like the earlier 14.04, 12.04,  10.04, 8.04, and 6.06, is an LTS version of Ubuntu; it will be supported for  ﬁ ve years on both the desktop and the server.   All other versions, such as 15.10, are supported for nine months, yet also  superseded by a new version every six months. Essentially, if you are run- ning the LTS version, you might not be too interested in moving to the  latest and greatest release until the next LTS version comes out. In contrast,  if you are running a regular release version, you might be the sort of per- son who is more interested in the latest and greatest software updates. In  either case, this is how you perform the upgrade.  TIP   All Ubuntu releases are intended to be stable. The LTS releases are intended to be extra sta- ble, as they represent the culmination of two years of planning and feature changes. The  intermediate releases include incremental changes that are stable but that may not be fea- ture-complete. For example, the Unity desktop was ﬁ rst released in 10.10, the ﬁ rst release  after  10.04  LTS,  but  its  features  became  more  complete  and  development  more  mature  for 12.04 LTS.  Doing the Actual Upgrade A graphical tool called Software Updater tells you when a new version of  Ubuntu is available and walks you through the upgrade process. Note that  if you already know or want to learn the manual method, that is ﬁ ne, too.  Both means will achieve the same result.  When a new release is available, Software Updater alerts you, as shown in  Figure 3-19. All you need to do is click on the Upgrade button to start the  process. You are ﬁ rst shown the release notes, which mention new fea- tures or any outstanding bugs. After you click the Upgrade button on this  screen, the necessary changes to your software repositories are made, and       Ubuntu and Multimedia   91  Figure 3-19  Upgrading from Ubuntu 15.10 using Software Updater and an  Internet connection  then the program downloads and installs the new distribution. You may  be prompted if you have changed any conﬁ guration ﬁ les. After the actual  installation is complete, you are told which, if any, packages are no longer  ofﬁ cially supported by Ubuntu  i.e., have moved to the universe reposi- tory . All you need to do is restart your computer when prompted, and  you will begin enjoying the new release.  Ubuntu and Multimedia In recent years, multimedia capabilities have become an essential part of  computing. Watching DVDs and Web videos and listening to music have  become an integral part of modern computer use. These multimedia ca- pabilities have been further bolstered by the huge popularity of legal mu- sic downloading. With a range of online stores for a variety of music, it is  not uncommon to listen to most of your music without ever seeing a little  shiny silver disk.  Installing Codecs Multimedia ﬁ les and disks come in a variety of different types, and each  type uses a special codec, or coder decoder software, to compress the con- tent to a smaller size while retaining a particular level of quality. To play  such media, you need to ensure that you have the relevant codecs installed.  Ubuntu now makes this easier by suggesting packages that provide a suit- able codec when you open a ﬁ le that isn’t supported by the codecs that are  currently installed. Simply double-click the ﬁ le you want to open, and you  should be provided with a list of packages that you can install to enable  support for the ﬁ le you have tried to open. Select the packages that seem  appropriate, and click Install.   92   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  TIP   If you double-click a ﬁ le but no packages are suggested, you may need to change the pack- age ﬁ lter in the upper-right corner to All Available Applications.  Codecs remain a problem for open source software because of the legal  restrictions placed upon them. Certain codecs  including MP3, Windows  Media Format, QuickTime, and RealMedia  are proprietary and, as such,  have restrictions placed on their use, distribution, and licensing.  Although developers in the open source community have created free im- plementations of some of these codecs, the licensing issues that surround  them conﬂ ict with the legal and philosophical position that Ubuntu has  taken. These codecs are excluded not only because they are legally dubious,  but also because they disagree with Ubuntu’s ethic of creating a distribu- tion that consists entirely of free software in the most free sense of the word.  TIP   If you want to ﬁ nd out more about installing these codecs, see https:  help.ubuntu.com  community RestrictedFormats.  To  work  toward  resolving  these  problems,  a  number  of  developers  are  working on free codecs, such as Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora, that provide  high-quality results and open licensing. The Ogg Vorbis codec is used for  audio ﬁ les and can provide better results than MP3 at a smaller ﬁ le size.  The  Ogg  Theora  codec  is  used  for  video  ﬁ les  and  competes  with  the  MPEG-4 codec. Ubuntu includes the Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora codecs  by default, and you can encode and play back any media that use those  codecs out of the box.  Although the world would be a better place if all codecs were free, the real- ity  is  different,  and  many  Ubuntu  users  still  want  to  play  media  com- pressed with proprietary codecs. Table 3-1 shows the most typical codecs  used to encode and play back media and lists their support in Ubuntu.  Listening to Audio Files Ubuntu includes a powerful music player called Rhythmbox Music Player  to organize and play your music ﬁ le collection. By default, Ubuntu will  look for music in the Music directory accessible in the Places menu.      Ubuntu and Multimedia   93  Table 3-1  Codec Support  File Type   Included   Supported  Windows Media Audio   Codec   MP3   Ogg   Flac   Wave   MPEG-1   MPEG-2   Raw DV   Quicktime   Windows Media Video   AAC Audio   .mp3   .ogg   .ﬂ ac   .wma   .wav   .mpg   .mpg   .dv   .mov   .wmv   .m4a   No   Yes   Yes   No   Yes   No   No   Yes   No   No   No   Yes  N A  N A  Yes*  N A  Yes  Yes  N A  Yes*  Yes*  Yes*  * These codecs involve the installation of nonfree software that may or may not be legal in  your country.  Using Rhythmbox  Load Rhythmbox  Figure 3-20  by searching the Dash  to ﬁ nd Rhythmbox Music Player. You can also access Rhythmbox quickly  using the Sound icon in the Notiﬁ cation area at the right of the top panel.  Click the icon for quick access to open or minimize the Rhythmbox win- dow, where you will ﬁ nd volume controls, playlists, and the Sound Set- tings menu.  The Rhythmbox window is split into a number of different panes, each  displaying  different  details  about  your  music  collection.  The  left  pane   Source  lets you select the source of the music, such as your media library,  podcasts,  and  Internet  radio.  Each  of  these  options  has  a  browser  pane  available to display the source of the content.  Listening to Podcasts  Podcasts are audio shows that you can subscribe  to, and they are increasingly becoming the new way to listen to audio ﬁ les  and music. When you subscribe to a podcast, each new release is automat- ically downloaded for you. This makes it extremely convenient to regularly  listen to audio shows.   94   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Figure 3-20  Rhythmbox is a great place to manage your music collection.  Rhythmbox has good support for podcast feeds, and subscribing to a feed  is simple. In the sidebar, right-click the Podcasts entry and click New Pod- cast Feed. Paste in the feed by right-clicking the box and selecting Paste.  The  ﬁ les  are  automatically  downloaded,  and  you  can  listen  to  them  by  double-clicking on them. Each time you start Rhythmbox, a check is made  to see if any new episodes exist; if so, those podcasts are downloaded.  NOTE  Rhythmbox and iPods and Other Media Players  Rhythmbox can also read songs from your iPod: just plug your iPod in, and the device infor- mation will be displayed in Rhythmbox. Rhythmbox can read from the iPod but may not be  able to write to all iPods. Support is quite good for most other media players, including the  author’s Android-based phone.  Playing and Ripping CDs If you insert a music CD into your computer, Ubuntu will respond by dis- playing a pop-up box that gives you the option to rip  copy  the music to  your hard drive or play the CD. If you rip the CD, you can adjust the meta- data during the process, such as the song titles or artist names.      Ubuntu and Multimedia   95  Interacting with Photos Shotwell is a photo management program that you can use to import your  pictures, organize them, and perform basic touch-ups like removing red  eye, cropping, or simple color adjustment. When Shotwell imports photos,  it reads the metadata embedded in the image ﬁ le and then sorts the images  by date. Once done, it creates a timeline that allows you to view photos  easily as a group, individually, and even as a full-screen slideshow. You can  export  your  photos  individually  or  in  groups  directly  from  Shotwell  to  well-known Web services like Flickr or Google’s Picasa, to a folder, or even  to a CD you could give to a friend or family member.  Watching Videos To watch videos in Ubuntu, you need to ensure that you have the correct  codecs installed. As discussed earlier, some of these codecs are available  separately due to the legal implications of including them with the Ubuntu  system.  Although  the  new  process  for  suggesting  and  installing  codecs  should  cover  the  most  popular  types  of  ﬁ les,  you  should  refer  to  the  Ubuntu Wiki at http:  wiki.ubuntu.com for details of how to install ones  that are not recognized.  Using Videos  To watch videos in Ubuntu, you use Videos  Figure 3-21 .  Load  it  by  clicking  Dash  Home  from  the  Launcher  and  searching  for  Videos.  To watch a video on your hard disk, click Movie > Open, and select the ﬁ le  from the disk.  TIP   Another Way to Load Files into Videos You can also load multimedia ﬁ les into Videos by double-clicking them on your desktop or in  the ﬁ le manager.  Videos  also  supports  video  streams.  To  watch  a  stream,  click  Movie  >  Open Location, and enter the Internet address for the stream. The video  feed is then loaded and displayed.  Getting  DVDs  to  Work  Ubuntu  comes  with  DVD  support  for  unen- crypted DVDs. With the DVD industry being what it is, the majority of    96   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Figure 3-21  Videos is a simple and ﬂ exible media player.  DVDs come encrypted. If you want to watch them, you need to ensure that  a software library that can decrypt these DVDs is installed. Unfortunately,  this software library needs to be installed separately and is not included  with Ubuntu. Refer to the Ubuntu restricted formats page at https:  help. ubuntu.com community RestrictedFormats for details.  With the library installed, insert a disk into your computer, and Ubuntu  will automatically start Movie Player to view the disk. Alternatively, ﬁ re up  Movie Player and then click Movie > Play Disk to play the DVD. Movie  Player doesn’t support DVD menus but you can still use it to play a DVD.  If you are settling down to watch a movie, you may want to conﬁ gure a few  other settings. First click View > Aspect Ratio to select the correct aspect  ratio for your screen, and then select View > Fullscreen to switch to full- screen mode. To exit full-screen mode, just move your mouse, and some  on-screen controls will appear.  Backing Up Everyone who has used a computer for any length of time has heard the  advice, “Back up, back up often, test the backups, repeat.” Few people actu-      Backing Up   97  ally follow this advice, but ignoring it is dangerous and can cause the loss  of important documents, ﬁ les, pictures, and more.  To prevent this loss, prudent computer users, regardless of which operat- ing system they use, pick a method of copying their ﬁ les to a safe location  for storage and use that method on a regular basis. To help you devise the  strategy that best suits you, we have come up with a few options to con- sider. This topic is a big one, and how you deal with it is a very personal  decision. Rather than give step-by-step instructions, we mention a few op- tions to consider and leave it to you to research them further and decide  on one that looks appropriate and inviting.  Some users ﬁ nd that the easiest thing for them to do is buy an external  hard drive and copy all of their ﬁ les to it every week or two. Others look at  this and think to themselves, “There has to be a better way.” Perhaps they  noticed  that  these  methods  require  every  single  ﬁ le  to  be  copied  every  time, even if the ﬁ le has not changed in ages. In these cases, an incremental  backup is ideal, where the computer is told to compare the ﬁ les in the orig- inal location with stored ﬁ les in a backup location  like an external hard  drive  and copy only new or changed ﬁ les.  Several GUI programs for backing up are available from the Ubuntu re- positories. Each comes with a basic and useful graphic interface that is easy  to ﬁ gure out and use, and each can be conﬁ gured to allow you to do full or  incremental backups. A backup program is installed by default and can be  found by searching for backups in the Dash. The program lets you conﬁ g- ure automatic or manual backups, specify the location for those backups,  specify what will be backed up, set scheduling for automatic backups, re- store ﬁ les from the backup, and more  Figure 3-22 .  For those users who are a little more advanced  or a little braver  and  who  love  the  raw  power  available  from  a  command-line  program,  the  best two programs for backups are rar and rsync, which are both avail- able from the Ubuntu repositories. Once they are installed, you can read  the manual pages and learn how to use them by typing  man  rar or  man  rsync from a terminal. Although rar and rsync are complicated, they are  also fast and amazingly effective at both making the backups and restor- ing them.   98   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  Figure 3-22  The main Backups settings window  TIP   Manpages Manual pages  or manpages for short  are instructions on how to use a piece of software.  They contain information about using the software from the command line, options, and  some tips. To access them, open a Terminal and type in man command, where command is  the one you would normally execute to run the software.  Unfortunately,  this  quick  mention  in  a  small  section  of  a  very  diverse  chapter can merely get you thinking about the need for good backups and  help guide you in your search for the perfect method for you. However  you decide to back up your data, we strongly encourage you not to ignore  the need to do so, but rather to ﬁ nd a way that works for you. If you have  any questions about this or other topics, the Ubuntu community has a  large number of very helpful people you can ask for advice, and we rec- ommend  you  start  by  searching  or  asking  questions  in Ask  Ubuntu  at  http:  askubuntu.com.  Customizing Ubuntu’s Look and Feel  Click the Gear icon at the right of the top panel and select System Settings  to conﬁ gure and customize your system. You can ﬁ nd other settings in the  Dash using the Applications Lens and the System ﬁ lter. Feel free to cus-      Summary   99  tomize anything you like, but pay attention to what you are doing so you  know how to change it back if you don’t like the result. Chapter 5 has more  information on customizing Ubuntu.  TIP     Feel the Power When you installed Ubuntu, you were asked for a username and password for the system.  That ﬁ rst user account  and its password  has access to not just your normal user account  but also to the all-powerful administration features. Therefore, when you access the menu  options while using this account and are asked for a password, just enter this user account’s  password to use those features.  This feature applies only to the user account created during installation. If you add other  users, you need to explicitly allow them access to administration options.  Unity in Other Devices As mentioned earlier on this chapter, one of the main design goals in Unity  was having a user interface that was similar between devices, allowing con- vergence as a ﬁ nal goal.  Unity is currently featured across four devices. Its form changes on each  device, but the visual concept is the same. As an example, the Launcher is  always on the left side of the screen. Unity also features the Dash, Lenses,  and Scopes.  Information on other device forms that use Unity can be found here:    Phone: www.ubuntu.com phone      Tablet: www.ubuntu.com tablet      TV: www.ubuntu.com tv    Summary In this chapter, you learned how to start using the core features of your  new  desktop.  These  concepts  should  allow  you  to  perform  most  of  the  day-to-day  tasks  when  using  your  computer  and  provide  a  base  from  which  to  explore  the  other  applications  installed  on  your  system.  This  solid grounding in the desktop paves the way for you to meander through    100   Chapter 3       Getting Started with Ubuntu  the rest of the book, learning about the more advanced uses of your new  system and exploring the enormous ﬂ exibility that Ubuntu provides.  A wealth of help and documentation is available online. If you ever ﬁ nd  yourself stuck, take a look at the Ubuntu Web site at www.ubuntu.com or  the Ubuntu documentation at http:  help.ubuntu.com and make use of  the community assistance available, as described in Chapter 11.   4  C H A P T E R   4 Finding and Installing  Ubuntu Applications  Learning Terminology and Foundations    Using the GNOME Software Center       Using Synaptic     Useful Software Packages to Explore     Playing to Learn with Educational Programs      Summary        101       IN  ADDITION  TO  THOSE  applications  installed  by  default,  Ubuntu  offers  a  wealth of other applications to help you make the most of your computer.  Different people use their machines in different ways, and it is for that rea- son that we wanted to help you discover how to enable your Ubuntu com- puter to do even more.  Chapter 3 included a brief introduction to the GNOME Software Center  as one way to install or remove software. In this chapter, we cover this ap- proach and other methods as well. Work done using one tool to add or re- move software is recognized by the related tools, so it is okay to mix and  match which ones you use.  Additionally, we show you just a few of the thousands of additional appli- cations that you can install on your Ubuntu system. Each section show- cases one application, starting with the name of the package you need to  install and the various Windows OS X equivalents that might exist.  Using the GNOME Software Center Like other tools discussed later in this chapter, the GNOME Software Cen- ter installs programs from the online Ubuntu software repositories.  TIP   GNOME Software Center vs. Ubuntu Software or Ubuntu Software Store? Even though the program is called the GNOME Software Center, it may be referenced as  “Ubuntu Software” or the “Ubuntu Software Store” in the Dash and various other menus.  But don’t worry, these are both the same program.  To  launch  the  GNOME  Software  Center,  click  the  Dash  icon  in  the  Launcher at the left of the desktop. In the search box at the top of the menu  that appears, type Software and the search will begin automatically. Click  the Software icon that appears in the box. When it runs for the ﬁ rst time,  and occasionally afterward, it will take a few moments to initialize itself  and the list of available and installed applications. Once this is complete,  you will see the main screen shown in Figure 4-1.  We introduced the basics of the GNOME Software Center earlier in Chap- ter 3. Let’s look at some of the other aspects now.  102   Using the GNOME Software Center   103  Figure 4-1  GNOME Software Center main screen  Sorting Click a category name at the bottom of the GNOME Software Center win- dow to sort the listed packages by category. Some of them are further bro- ken down into smaller subcategories, such as the Games listing shown in  Figure 4-2. Note that books and magazines are now available instantly in  their digital format via the application.  Searching Type search terms in the search box at the top center of the window to ﬁ nd  related software. The search conducted is a live search, meaning that the  results are updated as you type; you do not have to press Enter ﬁ rst, and  you can change the terms and get new results as they load, as in Figure 4-3.  Learning More about a Package and Installing It Click  the  package  name,  icon,  or  description  to  learn  more  about  the  package. You can click Install to install the software. There is also a Web    104   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Figure 4-2  A wide variety of games are available.

Removing a Package from the GNOME Software Center If you decide that you no longer want an installed package, just search for  it using the search bar. Once you ﬁ nd its listing, click on the Remove but- ton, located next to the package’s description, remove the package from  your computer.  Figure 4-4  Users tend to be honest in their software reviews.   106   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  No-Cost Software The software available from the GNOME Software Center is free, in terms  of the cost and the code that is available for people to view, modify, and  edit. You pay nothing for this software, and it is completely legal for you to  copy it, use it, share it, and so on.  Learning Terminology and Foundations Learning the meaning of a few terms will help you better understand how  the software gets installed on your machine as well as how the system works.    APT: Advanced Package Tool  APT  describes the entire system of     online repositories and the parts that download them and install them.  The APT is not highly visible when using graphic interface–based  systems like the GNOME Software Center, but it is very obvious when  you are using command-line tools like apt-get  described in greater  depth in Chapter 8 . Whether you use a graphical interface or the  command line to deal with Ubuntu software packages, APT is at work.    Repositories or software channels: In the Ubuntu world, these giant     online warehouses of software are divided between ofﬁ cial Ubuntu  repositories and unofﬁ cial ones.    Packages: Applications are stored in packages that not only describe    the program you want to install, but also tell your package manager  what the program needs to run and how to safely install and uninstall  it. This makes the process of dealing with software dependencies  smooth and easy for end users.    Dependencies: Dependencies comprise the software that is needed as     a foundation for other software to run. For example, APT is needed  for the GNOME Software Center to run, because the APT takes care  of many of the details behind the scenes.  Using Synaptic Synaptic is a powerful graphical tool for managing packages. It is not in- stalled by default. While the GNOME Software Center deals with packages  that contain applications, Synaptic deals with all packages, including ap-      Using Synaptic   107  plications, system libraries, and other pieces of software. Changing the sys- tem on this level is more complicated but also allows you to exert more  detailed control. For instance, you can choose to install a speciﬁ c library if  you need it for a program that is not available in a package format.  TIP   What’s a Library? In this context, a library is a collection of software functions that may be useful to more than  one program. This collection is put into a separate package that saves space by not forcing  multiple programs to include the same code but instead simply refer to the library when a cer- tain function the library contains is needed. It also makes updates easier, such as when a secu- rity  issue  is  ﬁ xed,  because  the  programming  code  may  be  changed  in  one  place  while  beneﬁ ting all programs that use the function. Libraries streamline software support to be more  efﬁ cient. But be careful: Installing unwanted libraries may cause some software failures.  Synaptic  may  be  installed  from  the  GNOME  Software  Center  and  then  found by searching in the Dash for Synaptic Package Manager. Launch it  and you will see the main window, as shown in Figure 4-5.  TIP   What’s in a Name? Why the name Synaptic? Synaptic is a play on words based on your brain’s synapses and  the word APT.  Figure 4-5  Synaptic main window   108   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Installing a Package As with using the GNOME Software Center, installing packages with Syn- aptic is fairly easy. You can browse through the package list and click on  the package name to expand its description. You will be able to see it in the  box located at the bottom of the Synaptic window. After you ﬁ nd the pack- age you wish to install, click the checkbox to the right of the name of the  package and select Mark for Installation. A dialog box may pop up  Fig- ure 4-6  showing you which dependencies  if any  need to be installed;  you can accept these dependencies by clicking the Mark button. After you  have selected all the desired packages, click Apply on the Synaptic toolbar  to begin installation.  Removing a Package To remove a package, click on the box next to the name of an installed  package, and choose Mark for Removal. As with installing a package, you  may be asked to mark additional packages for removal  Figure 4-7 . These  are generally packages that depend on the presence of the main package  you are marking for removal. If you wish to remove all the conﬁ guration  ﬁ les as well, choose Mark for Complete Removal. Bear in mind that if you  decide  to  reinstall  the  package  at  a  later  date,  your  settings  will  not  be  saved, as all the conﬁ guration ﬁ les will be reset. After you have selected the  package s  you wish to remove, click Apply on the toolbar to start the pro- cess of removing the package s .  Figure 4-6  Pop-up on Mark for Installation      Using Synaptic   109  Figure 4-7  Pop-up on Mark for Removal  Finding That Package So you are looking for a package but don’t know where to start? Just click  the Search button on the toolbar and enter the search term. By default, the  regular search looks at both the package name and the description, but it  can also search just by name or a number of other ﬁ elds.  If you know the section where the package is found, select it in the left  pane  you may need to go back to the Sections pane . Select the button in  the lower-left corner labeled Sections, and browse through the packages in  that section.  In  addition  to  Sections,  other  package  listing  and  sorting  options  are  worth exploring. You can access them using the buttons at the bottom left  of the Synaptic window. Status lets you sort according to installation sta- tus. Origin sorts according to the repository from which the software was  installed  or no repository for manually installed software; see the section  later in this chapter on installing software that is not in a repository . You  can even create custom ﬁ lters to aid your search.  NOTE   If you want to learn how to install software from the command line, see Chapter 8.   110   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Useful Software Packages to Explore The software discussed in this section of the chapter is not installed by de- fault  but  is  known  to  be  useful  and  well  respected.  These  packages  are  identiﬁ ed here as recommendations to help those users who have speciﬁ c  needs narrow their search for programs that meet their requirements.  Creating Graphics with GIMP and Inkscape GIMP Package name: gimp Windows equivalent: Adobe Photoshop or GIMP  The GNU Image Manipulation Program, affectionately known as GIMP  to its friends, is a powerful graphics package. GIMP provides a compre- hensive range of functionality for creating different types of graphics. It  includes  tools  for  selecting,  drawing,  paths,  masks,  ﬁ lters,  effects,  and  more.  It  also  includes  a  range  of  templates  for  different  types  of  media  such as Web banners, different paper sizes, video frames, CD covers, ﬂ oppy  disk labels, and even toilet paper.  NOTE   In early versions of Ubuntu, GIMP was installed by default, but it has not been installed in  this way for several years, mainly because it is a large package with a speciﬁ c audience and  room was desired for more general-use packages.   GIMP has a separate set of toolbars that appear above the application’s  workspace when the application is opened. This can be a little confusing at  ﬁ rst for new users—especially those used to Photoshop. If you want the  toolbars to be docked in the workspace, you can go to Windows > Single  Window Mode. This mode can help you become more familiar with the  GIMP tools. To get you started, let’s run through a simple session in GIMP.  An Example  Start GIMP by searching for it in the Dash.  When GIMP loads, you will see a collection of different windows, as shown  in Figure 4-8.      Useful Software Packages to Explore   111  Figure 4-8  GIMP does not put everything in one window like Adobe Photoshop.  You now have two windows. The window on the left in Figure 4-8 is the  main tool palette. This window provides you with a variety of tools that  can be used to create your images. The window on the right provides de- tails  of  layers,  brushes,  and  other  information.  GIMP  provides  a  huge  range of windows that are used for different things, and these are just the  two shown by default.  To create a new image, click File > New. The window shown in Figure 4-9  will appear.  The easiest way to get started is to select one of the many templates. Click  the Template combo box and select 640 × 480. If you click the Advanced  Options  expander,  you  can  also  select  whether  to  use  RGB  or  grayscale  with the Colorspace box. You can also choose a background ﬁ ll color or  having a transparent background.   112   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Figure 4-9  Lots of templates are available, including one for toilet paper!  Click OK, and you will see your new image window  Figure 4-10 .  To work on your image, use the tool palette to select which tool you want to  use on the new image window. Each time you click on a tool in the palette,  options for that tool will appear at the bottom half of the palette window.  When you click the button that looks like an “A” in the toolbox, it selects  the text tool. At the bottom of the toolbox, you will see the different op- tions. Click the Font button that looks like an uppercase and a lowercase   Figure 4-10  Use the right mouse button on the image to access lots  of GIMP options and features.      Useful Software Packages to Explore   113  case “A”  like “Aa”  and select the Sans Bold font. Now click the up arrow  on the Size box, and select the size as 60 px. Move your mouse over to the  empty image window, and you will see the mouse pointer change to a text  carat. Click in the image, and a box pops up in which you can enter the text  to add to the image. Type in “Ubuntu.” With the text entry still open, click  the up arrow on the Size box so the text ﬁ lls most of the window. As you  can see, you can adjust the text while it is in the image. When you are happy  with the formatting, click Close on the text entry box. Your image should  resemble Figure 4-11.  Now, in the toolbox, click the button that has a cross with an arrow on  each end. You can use this tool to move the text around. Click the black  text, and move the mouse. Let’s add an effect ﬁ lter. GIMP comes with a  wide variety of built-in ﬁ lters. You can access these by right-clicking the  image and selecting the Filters submenu.   For our image, right-click the image and select Filters > Blur > Gaussian  Blur. In the Horizontal and Vertical boxes, select 5 as the value. Click OK,   Figure 4-11  Ubuntu comes with a range of attractive fonts for use in your images.   114   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  and the blur is applied to your text.  Anything in GIMP can be undone by  clicking  Edit  >  Undo  or  typing  Ctrl-Z.   Your  image  should  now  look  like Figure 4-12.   Now we will create another layer and put some text over our blurred text  to create an interesting effect. If the Layers window isn’t open yet, open  it  with  Windows  >  Dockable  Dialogues  >  Layers.  The  Layers  window  will appear.  Layers are like clear plastic sheets that can be stacked on top of each other.  They allow you to create some imagery on one layer and then create an- other layer on top with some other imagery. When combined, layers can  create complex-looking images that are easily modiﬁ ed because you can  edit layers individually. Currently, our blurred text is one layer. We can add  a new layer by clicking the paper icon in the Layers dialog box. Another  window appears, in which you can conﬁ gure the new layer. The defaults  are  ﬁ ne   they  create  a  transparent  layer  that  matches  the  size  of  your   Figure 4-12  Several ﬁ lters and effects are bundled with GIMP in Ubuntu.

You can do this by moving the mouse in  the color range and then clicking OK when you ﬁ nd a color you like. Click  the text button from the palette and again add the “Ubuntu” text. When  the text is added, it will be the same size as before. Use the move tool and  position it over the blurred text. Now you have the word “Ubuntu” with a  healthy glow, as shown in Figure 4-13.  The  ﬁ nal  step  is  to  crop  the  image  to  remove  the  unused  space.  Click  Tools > Transform Tools > Crop, and use the mouse to draw around the  “Ubuntu” word. You can click in the regions near the corners of the selec- tion to adjust the selection more precisely. Click inside the selection, and  the image will be cropped.   To save your work, click File > Save, and enter a ﬁ lename. You can use the  Select File Type expander to select from one of the many different ﬁ le  formats.  Figure 4-13  Combining steps can result in interesting effects.   116   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  TIP   How do you save a ﬁ le in GIMP? A change in GIMP has modiﬁ ed the process for saving ﬁ les. Your options are either to save  the ﬁ le in the native .xcf format or to instead export the ﬁ le to save it in a more familiar for- mat such as .jpg or .png.  Further Resources  If you want to investigate other capabilities found in  GIMP,  a  great  starting  point  is  GIMP’s  own  help  function.  It  is  not  in- stalled by default, but if you are connected to the Internet, the help viewer  will download it automatically. You can also install it by searching for gimp  help in the GNOME Software Center. GIMP’s own Web site  www.gimp.org   has all the help plus tutorials and more.  Inkscape Package name: inkscape Windows OS X equivalents: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Freehand, Inkscape  Inkscape is also a drawing and graphic creation tool, much like GIMP, but  one that has a slightly different focus. Unlike GIMP, which works with ras- ter graphics, Inkscape is a vector drawing tool. This means that rather than  using a grid of pixels, each assigned a color, drawings are mathematically  described using angles and arbitrary units.  To  get  started  with  Inkscape,  launch  it  by  searching  for  it  in  the  Dash.  Very shortly you will see the default window with the basic canvas of ei- ther Letter or A4, with the default depending on where in the world you  live. At the top of the screen, below the menus, are three sets of toolbars.  The topmost contains common tools like save and zoom, the second pre- sents  a  series  of  snapping  options,  and  the  third’s  content  changes  de- pending on the tool selected.   All the tools are listed on the left-hand side of the menu, starting with  the selection tool and running down to the eyedropper or paint color  selector tool. Let’s get started by drawing a simple shape and coloring it  in  Figure 4-14 .  Figure 4-14  Inkscape’s toolbar  First, select the rectangle tool on the left, just below the zoom icon. Draw a  rectangle anywhere on the screen. Now let’s change the color of the ﬁ ll and  outside line or stroke.      Useful Software Packages to Explore   117  NOTE  With any of the drawing tools, pressing the Shift key causes objects to grow from the center   of where you clicked and pressing Ctrl enables you to constrain dimensions and rotation.  With  your  rectangle  still  selected,  right-click  and  select  Fill  and  Stroke.  Over  on  the  right,  you  will  see  the  window  appear,  with  three  different  tabs: Fill, Stroke Paint, and Stroke Style. Let’s ﬁ ll that rectangle with a gra- dient from orange to white. Immediately below the Fill tab, change from  Flat color to Linear Gradient  Figure 4-15 .  Look back at your rectangle and see the gradient and a new line running  horizontally across the rectangle. Moving either the square or the circle  allows  you  to  deﬁ ne  where  the  gradient  starts  and  stops.  To  change  the  colors, click the Edit… button. Once the Edit dialog appears, each end of  the gradient is called a stop and can be edited separately  Figure 4-16 .  Now that we have a rectangle, let’s add some text to our image. Select the  Text tool, which is found near the bottom on the left, and click anywhere.   Figure 4-15  Your rectangle, now with gradient-ﬁ lled goodness   118   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Figure 4-16  Gradient editing dialog  A cursor appears, and you can start typing. Type “Ubuntu.” Next we will  change the color and size of that text. Let’s make the text 56 point; this size  can be selected in the upper right, beside the Font name.  The Fill and Stroke dialog should still be open on the right, but if it isn’t,  reopen it. Change the text color to Red, and then choose the selection tool  again. Drag a box around both the text and the rectangle, and you should  see both selected  Figure 4-17 .  Next open the Alignment dialog, which is found near the bottom of the  Object menu. Like the Fill and Stroke dialog, it appears on the right-hand  side. To center the text in the box, locate the middle two icons with a line  and some blue lines on the side of them. Click both the Horizontal and  Vertical alignment options, and both the text and image will be centered  on the page  Figure 4-18 .  Now that you have created an image, what can you do with it? By default,  Inkscape saves ﬁ les in the SVG  Scalable Vector Graphics  format, an open  standard for vector graphics. If you want to take your work elsewhere and  display it on another computer or print it, Inkscape can also save the ﬁ le in  the  PDF  format.  If  you  choose  to  turn  the  image  into  a  PDF  ﬁ le,  make       Useful Software Packages to Explore   119  Figure 4-17  Text and rectangle selected  Figure 4-18  Your ﬁ nal drawing   120   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  certain you also save a copy as an SVG so you can edit the image later if you  wish. Both SVG and PDF are options in the Save dialog. One key advantage  of using the PDF format is that it embeds fonts and graphics, meaning your  image will look the same on nearly any computer you show it on. You can  also export your image as a PNG ﬁ le for embedding in a text document or  uploading  to  the Web.  Many  modern Web  browsers  such  as  Firefox  and  Chrome can also display SVG ﬁ les directly, although most don’t support  the full SVG standard. To export your image, choose File > Export, which  allows you to decide whether to export just the objects selected, the whole  document, or some portion of it. At the point, you have seen just how pow- erful Inkscape can be. There are many more things you can do with Ink- scape, so play around with the various options, dialogs, and shapes.  Further Resources  If you want to investigate other capabilities found in  Inkscape, a great starting point is always Inkscape’s own help, which is in  SVG format, so you can see how the original authors created the tutorials.  Inkscape’s Web site  http:  inkscape.org  has some great tutorials and arti- cles. If you want a book, Tav Bah’s Inkscape: Guide to Vector Drawing Pro- gram, third edition, is a good place to start.  Desktop Publishing with Scribus Package name: scribus Windows equivalents: Adobe InDesign, Scribus  For more powerful document creation than is possible with LibreOfﬁ ce,  Scribus is just the ticket. A desktop publishing application, Scribus is built  for designing and laying out documents of various sizes and sorts. As such,  it makes a few different assumptions that might catch you off-guard if you  typically use LibreOfﬁ ce to create your documents.  When you ﬁ rst launch Scribus, it asks you which kind of document you  want to create or whether you want to open an existing document. Let’s  create a single-page document and take Scribus for a spin  Figure 4-19 .  The ﬁ rst thing to remember about Scribus is that it is a desktop publishing  program—which means it is not designed for the direct editing of images  and text. Ideally, you will edit and create your images in applications like       Useful Software Packages to Explore   121  Figure 4-19  Scribus’s opening dialog with lots of options  GIMP or Inkscape and your text in word processors like LibreOfﬁ ce and  then import them into Scribus.  For starters, let’s create a pair of text frames. For our example, we will use  a  document found in the Welcome_to_Ubuntu.odt ﬁ le. To create a text  frame, you use the Insert Text Frame tool, which is found near the middle  of the toolbar. After you draw the text frame, you need to add text to it.  Right-click on the frame and choose Get Text. A dialog very similar to the  Open dialog appears. Choose the Welcome_to_Ubuntu.odt ﬁ le, and then  select OK. You will be asked a few options; for now, accept the defaults. You  should see the text appear on the screen  Figure 4-20 .  NOTE   Scribus currently cannot import Microsoft Word documents, so you need to open them in  LibreOfﬁ ce and convert them to .odt ﬁ les so Scribus can import them.   As you can see, the text overﬂ ows the frame. To ensure that the rest of the  text is visible, you need to create another text frame and then link the two  text frames, allowing the overﬂ ow to appear in the second frame. Go up to    122   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Figure 4-20  The imported text in a frame  the toolbar again, select the Insert Text Frame, and draw another frame  roughly on the bottom of the page. Then select the ﬁ rst frame and choose  the Link Text Frames icon on the toolbar; this icon looks like two columns  with an arrow between them. Next click on the second text box. An arrow  should appear and, more importantly, your text should now ﬂ ow from one  frame to the next  Figure 4-21 .  Next let’s insert an image at the bottom of the screen. As with text, you need  to create an image frame and then add the image to that frame. Draw the  image frame below the two text frames, and then right-click and choose  Get Image. Just as in the text import step, choose your ﬁ le—this time an  image ﬁ le—in the Open dialog, and it will appear in the frame. Let’s choose  the Ubuntu logo, which is found within the Logo folder in Example Con- tent. It will appear in your image frame  Figure 4-22 .      Useful Software Packages to Explore   123  Figure 4-21  Text now ﬂ ows from frame to frame.  NOTE   Scribus can import gif, jpg, png, xpm, psd, tiff, eps, and pdf ﬁ les. It cannot yet import ﬁ les in  GIMP’s XCF format, so you will need to export any images you create in GIMP in one of the  supported formats.  Now that you have added some text and an image, let’s export your cre- ation to PDF so you can share it with the world. On the toolbar near the  left-hand edge, you will see the PDF logo, just to the left of the trafﬁ c  light icon. Select that, and ignore the error message about the DPI of the  image. Select Ignore Errors, and you will see a large dialog with many  options for embedding fonts and the like. Don’t worry too much about  them right now, as the document you have created isn’t that complicated.  Choose a good name for your document, and then save it to your Docu- ments folder.    124   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Figure 4-22  Your document with an image added  Now let’s take a look at your creation in the Document Viewer. Open the  File Manager and load your new document  Figure 4-23 .  Now let’s go back to Scribus and save the image in Scribus’s own SLA for- mat so that you can edit it later if you wish. Enter the name you chose for  the PDF ﬁ le and save it in the Documents folder as well. You have now  created your ﬁ rst document in Scribus. There is a lot more to explore, so  go and try things out. Just remember to save every now and again.  Further Resources  As always, Scribus’s own help is a great place to start  your investigation of this program’s other capabilities. The Scribus Web  site   www.scribus.net   has  a  help  wiki,  further  documentation,  and  more. There is also an ofﬁ cial book, which isn’t out as of this writing but       Useful Software Packages to Explore   125  Figure 4-23  Your document as a PDF  should be very shortly.

Editing Videos with OpenShot Package name: openshot Windows Equivalents: Final Cut, Adobe Premiere  OpenShot is an excellent video editor for your home videos. It has a simple  to understand user interface, so why not give it a try now?   126   Chapter 4       Finding and Installing Ubuntu Applications  Go to the Dash and search for OpenShot. Once it has loaded, you are free  to start your project.   To begin, go to File > New Project; a box titled “Create a Project” will ap- pear. Change the title from Default Project to any name you would like.  Now click Save Project, and the project box will close.   At this point, you have several options from which you can choose. The  most common practice is to import a video by clicking the Plus button at  the top of the screen. In the box that appears, you can choose any video  ﬁ les that you deem ﬁ t to edit and that OpenShot supports.   Once you have imported your video, you have many options at your dis- posal. You can do your usual cropping, fading, and custom effects. You  can also add 3D effects with Blender, making your videos come alive for  the viewer.  For example, if you have recorded a video with a green screen, you can go  to the Effects tab and apply a Chroma Key. You can also distort your image,  echo your sound, and ﬁ nally mirror it. Then, go to the Transitions tab and  select one of the dozens of transition effects that can be applied when you  are changing from clip to clip. These are just a few examples of what you  can do with OpenShot.  OpenShot, seen in Figure 4-24, has many options for the amateur video  editor and anyone interested in making their home videos look better than  ever.

Here are brief descriptions of three of them.    Tux Paint: Tux Paint is a drawing package for younger children.     Although geared toward a younger audience, Tux Paint still packs in  some of the more advanced features of drawing packages and enables  users to draw shapes, paint with different brushes, use a stamp, and  add text to the image. The Magic feature offers many of the more  advanced tools normally found in full-ﬂ edged photo editors, such as  smudge, blur, negative, tint, and many more. There is also the facility  to save as well as print.    GCompris: GCompris is a set of small educational activities aimed at    children between 2 and 10 years old and is translated into more than  40 languages. Some of the activities are game oriented and simultane- ously educational. Among the activities, there are tasks to educate  children in computer use, algebra, science, geography, reading, and  more. More than 80 activities are available in the latest release.    Anagramarama: Anagramarama is a game designed to improve     children’s vocabulary. Players are presented with a set of letters, which  they have to put in order to create several words. Players can shufﬂ e  the letters, as well as ask for a new puzzle. There is also a time limit  involved, so the challenge is even bigger. Apart from being a great  pastime, Anagramarama can help users learn new words.  Summary In this chapter, you learned how to install and use just a few of the addi- tional  applications  available  for  Ubuntu.  Although  this  chapter  merely  scratched the surface of what each application can do, you should have  enough of an understanding of each to get started with them, and the Fur- ther  Resources  sections  should  help  you  become  an  expert.  Beyond  the  packages described in this chapter, a vast universe of programs is available.       Summary   133  Go and explore—try out something new. At worst, you will have wasted a  few hours, but you might ﬁ nd something that will change your life.  Always  remember  that  a  wealth  of  help  and  documentation  is  available  online.

In this chapter, we look at the many ways the Unity desktop can be  adapted to different users. Unity is a relatively new desktop, so we start by  reviewing the terminology for the desktop. We then look at the default  settings, including various ways to tweak them. Lenses were introduced in  the Ubuntu 11.04 release; in the 16.04 LTS, a wide variety of Lenses are  available. We examine some popular Lenses and how to use them. Differ- ent people use their computers in different ways, and for that reason we  want to help you discover how to tweak your Unity desktop to best suit  your needs.  While tweaking your desktop is a fun way to personalize your desktop ex- perience, we also want to caution you about making changes without un- derstanding what those changes will do. If you are unsure about making  those changes, take some time to research them. At the end of this chapter,  we  identify  some  more  resources  to  further  your  understanding  of  the  Unity desktop.  In this chapter, we show you just a few of the Lenses that are available and  explain how you can install them. At the end, we point out the resources  that will get you started writing those Lenses as you go from novice to su- peruser. Let’s get ready to supercharge your Unity desktop!  Unity Terminology When the Unity Launcher was introduced in the Ubuntu 11.04 release, a  number of design goals were established. Speciﬁ cally, the icons needed to  be easy to ﬁ nd, running applications needed to be always visible, the fo- cused application needed to be easily accessible, and the interface needed  to be touch friendly. The Unity desktop certainly met with a mixed range  of highly charged emotions from early adopters, and due to their passion  and feedback, the desktop and its functionality have improved. Providing  user feedback is one of the most important things an Ubuntu user can do  for the project. At the end of this chapter, you will be given a list of re- sources to get you started on providing the developers with feedback.  136      Unity Terminology   137  In Ubuntu 16.04 Unity desktop, many new Unity Scopes are installed by  default. These new Scopes allow the Dash to search in many more places,  and they provide you with results from a wide variety of sources.  Unity  also  features  the  HUD   Heads  Up  Display   that  users  can  use  to  search  the  menus  of  a  focus   active   window  or  full  application.  HUD  doesn’t replace your global menu, but rather is a feature that can be ac- cessed by pressing the Alt key.   As we look at the parts that make up the Unity desktop, we’ll also explore  the Unity Tweak Tool  Figure 5-1 . Unity Tweak Tool is a third-party tool  that allows users to conﬁ gure and tune their Unity desktops. It also allows  users to return to the default desktop settings, thereby undoing changes  made earlier. To install Unity Tweak Tool through the GNOME Software   Figure 5-1  Unity Tweak Tool   138   Chapter 5       Customizing Ubuntu for Performance, Accessibility, and Fun  Center, click the Software icon located in the Launcher. Once the software  center opens, type Unity Tweak Tool into the search box and click Install   Figure 5-2 .  You can also install the Unity Tweak Tool from the command line with the  command sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool.  Following is the list of user interface  UI  terms for the parts of your Unity  desktop; numbers 1 to 7 correspond to the numbers in Figure 5-3 and the  words to Figure 5-4. Finally, Figure 5-5 shows the HUD.  3.  Dash Icon, which opens what is shown in Figure 5-4, including:  1.  Windows Tile  2.  Application Menu  a.  Applications Lens  b.  Files and Folders Lens  c.

The Ubuntu 16.04 release uses the 4.4 Linux kernel, based on the 4.4 up- stream stable kernel.   The  applications  included  in  this  release  by  default,  but  not  necessarily  locked to the Launcher, are Nautilus, GNOME Software Center, Firefox,  Thunderbird, LibreOfﬁ ce, Rhythmbox, Deja Dup Backup Tool, Shotwell,  Transmission, Remmina  remote desktop client , GNOME Control Cen- ter  system settings , Gedit, and Totem.      Appearance Tool   141  Figure 5-6  Locating the Appearance icon from the Dash  As mentioned earlier, tweaking your Unity desktop can be done easily with  tools like the Unity Tweak Tool, and some tweaks can be made using the  Appearance tool. To get to the Appearance tool, click the Super key once  and the Dash will open. In the search box, type “Appearance,” and then  click on the Appearance icon to open this tool  Figure 5-6 .  Appearance Tool The Appearance tool is available by default and allows users to change the  look and behavior of their Unity desktop. It opens to the Look tab  Fig- ure 5-7  and allows you to change the background, theme, and Launcher  icon size. The Behavior tab  Figure 5-8  allows you to change autohiding  of the Launcher, the reveal location  where you need to put your mouse  for the Launcher to reappear , and the reappear sensitivity levels. It also  allows you to enable Workspaces as well as add a Show Desktop icon to  the Launcher.   142   Chapter 5       Customizing Ubuntu for Performance, Accessibility, and Fun  Figure 5-7  Appearance tool: Look tab  Figure 5-8  Appearance tool: Behavior tab      Unity Tweak Tool   143  Unity Tweak Tool As mentioned earlier, Unity Tweak Tool is a third-party tool, which was  created  by  the  Freyja  Development  Team.  To  ﬁ nd  out  more  about  the  team, go to https:  launchpad.net ~freyja-dev.  If you followed the instructions to download the Unity Tweak Tool earlier  in this chapter, great. If not, you may want to do so now. This tool allows  users to tweak four different areas of the Unity desktop.  Unity Here, you will be able to change settings for the Launcher, Search, Panel,  Switcher, Web Apps. and more.  The Launcher tab  Figure 5-9  allows you to change the color, transpar- ency, icon size, autohiding, animations, and more.  Figure 5-9  Unity Tweak Tool: Launcher tab   144   Chapter 5       Customizing Ubuntu for Performance, Accessibility, and Fun  The Search tab  Figure 5-10  allows you to change the blur of the Dash,  and some other features as the display of suggestions, as well as recently  used applications.  The Panel tab  Figure 5-11  allows you to change settings for the top panel.  It includes transparency and the display of certain system-based indicators.  The Shifter tab  Figure 5-12  allows you to specify settings and shortcuts  for the applications switcher.  On the Web Apps tab  Figure 5-13 , you can decide whether you want to  enable prompts for Web Apps and specify the preauthorized domains.  The Additional tab  Figure 5-14  allows you to change keyboard shortcuts  as well as enable the HUD to remember previous commands.  Window Manager The  Window  Manager  allows  you  to  customize  how  Ubuntu  manages  windows.  Figure 5-10  Unity Tweak Tool: Search tab      Unity Tweak Tool   145  Figure 5-11  Unity Tweak Tool: Panel tab  Figure 5-12  Unity Tweak Tool: Shifter tab   146   Chapter 5       Customizing Ubuntu for Performance, Accessibility, and Fun  Figure 5-13  Unity Tweak Tool: Web Apps tab  Figure 5-14  Unity Tweak Tool: Additional tab      Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager   147  Appearance The  Appearance  section  allows  you  to  change  the  system  theme,  icons,  cursors, and default fonts, as well as the side where the close, minimize, and  maximize buttons are located.  System The  System  section  allows  you  to  set  the  default  desktop  icons,  disable  some features for security reasons, and set some scrolling options.  Play around with all these settings. Unity Tweak Tool is a very forgiving  tool. If you don’t like the tweaks you are making, simply click the Restore  Defaults button found on every tab, and you’ll be able to start your tweak- ing adventure all over again.  Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager is a conﬁ guration tool for Compiz with  which you may want to become familiar. To get started with the Compiz  Conﬁ g  Settings  Manager,  you  will  need  to  install  it  from  the  GNOME  Software Center, launch it from the Launcher by clicking the Super key to  bring up the Dash, and type “Compiz.” Click on the Compiz Conﬁ g Set- tings Manager icon to launch this tool. The ﬁ rst time you open this man- ager, you will get a warning  Figure 5-15 . Although it is an incredible tool,  Compiz  Conﬁ g  Settings  Manager  is  not  as  forgiving  as  the Appearance  and Unity Tweak tools. Users are cautioned to use Compiz  Figure 5-16   with care, as you may end up with an unusable desktop if you make too  many errors.  When you open Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager, you’ll notice that some  of the categories have the boxes beside them checked. This is because those  areas have been integrated with the Unity desktop.  Let’s take a closer look at the features offered with Compiz Conﬁ g Settings  Manager.  In the upper-left corner of the Main view, you’ll notice a search box  Fig- ure 5-17 . It can be used for quick and easy ﬁ ltering of the plug-ins list    148   Chapter 5       Customizing Ubuntu for Performance, Accessibility, and Fun  Figure 5-15  Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager warning  Figure 5-16  Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager main view  Figure 5-17  Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager search box      Compiz Conﬁ g Settings Manager   149  using the text you type in the search box. The search box can also be used  like a ﬁ lter for the options on various plug-in pages.  The Advanced Search button at the lower-left corner of the Main view  as  seen in Figure 5-18  allows you to ﬁ lter through all the options of all the  plug-ins. Please note this may take a while to load. Advanced Search allows  you to search by name, long description, and the values you have set. Once  you have a list, you can click on the plug-in and see which groups contain  the option you searched for.  The  plug-ins  for  the  Compiz  Conﬁ g  Settings  Manager  are  divided  into  eight categories:   1.  General: Contains the core plug-ins  Figure 5-18 . 2.  Accessibility: Contains plug-ins to make the desktop easier to use,   especially for those individuals who have a reading or viewing  disability  Figure 5-19 . The Enhanced Zoom plug-in magniﬁ es the  whole screen on demand.   3.  Desktop: Contains plug-ins to conﬁ gure how the desktop behaves    Figure 5-20 .

Unity Lenses and Scopes The Dash is one of Unity’s main features. It allows users to search for in- formation both locally and remotely using Lenses. Each Lens is responsi- ble for one category of search results for the Dash.  By itself, the Lens is not very useful, because it doesn’t perform the search.  Instead, the Lens relies on one or more Scopes, which are the actual search  engines, to return the search results.  In the terminology section of Chapter 3, we looked at the music Lens. This  Lens  has  two  Scopes,  which  means  that  four  processes  are  involved  in  searching the music category for content: the Dash, the Lens daemon, ﬁ rst  Scope daemon, and second Scope daemon.   154   Chapter 5       Customizing Ubuntu for Performance, Accessibility, and Fun  As a user, you won’t even notice the complex process the Lens performs to  keep everything in sync. You can just enjoy the beneﬁ ts of being able to  quickly search various categories of information.  NOTE   For more information on how Lenses work and are created, see the Lens Guidelines wiki at  https:  wiki.ubuntu.com Unity Lenses Guidelines.  It seems that everyone has a favorite Unity Lens. By default, Unity comes  with the following Lenses: Applications, Files, Music, and Video.  Additional Resources In this chapter, we looked at three tools you can use to tweak your Unity  desktop:  Appearance,  Unity  Tweak  Tool,  and  Compiz  Conﬁ g  Settings  Manager. Other tools and resources are available to help you personalize  your desktop environment. A wealth of help and documentation is also  available online. If you ever ﬁ nd yourself stuck, take a look at the Ubuntu  Web  site  at  www.ubuntu.com  or  the  Ubuntu  documentation  at  https:   help.ubuntu.com, and make use of Ask Ubuntu, the forums, wiki, mailing  lists, and IRC channels.  Summary In this chapter we outlined several ways to customize your Ubuntu experi- ence. Changing the Unity desktop from its default settings is not some- thing everyone will want or need to do, but knowing how to do so is both  useful and sometimes necessary.   6  C H A P T E R   6 Becoming an Ubuntu Power User  Learning Unity Keyboard Shortcuts    Administering System and User Settings     Understanding How Linux Stores and Organizes Files       Using the Terminal     Working with Windows Programs       Compiling Software from Source      Installing Software from PPAs  Summary        155         UBUNTU  IS  RELATIVELY  STRAIGHTFORWARD  to  set  up  and  use  for  common  day-to-day tasks. With time, though, most users want to learn how to be  more efﬁ cient in performing their tasks on that computer. It is this efﬁ - ciency—this elegance in the way tasks are performed—that forms the ba- sis of the separation between beginners and power users. Those who are  content to learn just enough to get a task done need not read this chapter.  Those who want to perform these tasks more easily, more quickly, or more  smoothly  and  with  a  deeper  understanding  of  what  they  are  doing  and  why are the target audience here. This chapter is not about customization;  for that, see Chapter 5. This chapter is about understanding and learning  how to use what you already have to its fullest potential.  Administering System and User Settings To  begin,  search  for  Settings  in  the  Dash  and  open  System  Settings   Figure  6-1 .  From  here  you  can  adjust  many  aspects  of  your  system,  as  shown  in   Figure 6-2.  Click an item to select it and modify its settings.

Some settings require you to unlock them by clicking  the Unlock button at the upper-right corner and entering a password be- fore you can modify their settings  Figure 6-3 . You must have administra- tive privileges to do this.   User Settings Let’s begin by taking a look at available user settings. Once you unlock the  window shown in Figure 6-3, you can click the + symbol at the bottom left  to add a new user, click the – symbol to delete a user, or click on a user ac- count to modify its settings. Click on any item shown at the right to mod- ify its settings, as in Figure 6-4.  Security & Privacy Settings The Security & Privacy menu allows you to carefully manage which infor- mation is recorded about you when you use Ubuntu  Figure 6-5 . For ex- ample,  when  you  open  programs,  Ubuntu  records  what  you  use  most  often and will list it ﬁ rst in the Dash as you search.

Click the Details icon in the System Settings menu to change from the de- fault settings, as in Figure 6-6. Select different items from the menu at the  left for other options.  TIP   There are lots of settings available. Feel free to change any of them to suit your needs or  preferences. You may want to take note of the current settings before you make changes,  just in case you change your mind and want to restore your original settings.   160   Chapter 6       Becoming an Ubuntu Power User  Figure 6-6  Changing your default applications is easy: just make sure you install  what you want to use before you try to tell Ubuntu to use it.  Understanding How Linux Stores and Organizes Files If you have not used Linux before, the way that Linux stores and organizes  ﬁ les is likely to be new to you, because the layout is quite different from  Windows and Mac OS X.  TIP   Folders and Directories When reading about ﬁ le management, don’t get confused by the terms folders and directo- ries—both words describe the same thing.  In the Windows world, each disk drive is labeled with an identifying letter  such as C: for your hard disk and D: for the CD DVD drive. In the Linux  world, however, everything is part of the same ﬁ lesystem organization. As  such, if you have two or three hard disks, a CD drive, and a USB stick all  plugged in, they will all be part of the same folder structure.  The diagram shown in Figure 6-7 should give you an idea of how every- thing hangs together.  Right at the top of the tree is the root folder, referred to as  . Inside this  folder are a number of special system folders, each with a speciﬁ c use. As       Understanding How Linux Stores and Organizes Files   161  Figure 6-7  Linux ﬁ lesystem organization  an example, the  home folder contains a number of home directories for  each  user  on  the  system. As  such,  the  user  account  may  have  the  home  folder set to  home jono  if your username is jono! .  Which Folder Does What?  The folder structure in a modern Linux dis- tribution such as Ubuntu was largely inspired by the original UNIX foun- dations that were created by men with large beards. Although you don’t  really need to know what these folders do, because Ubuntu looks after the  housekeeping for you, some of you may be interested in the more impor- tant folders. To help, we present the Linux folder hit list in Table 6-1.  Conﬁ guration Files  In Table 6-1,  etc is described as storing systemwide  conﬁ guration ﬁ les for your computer. Aside from these ﬁ les that affect ev- eryone,  there  are  also  conﬁ guration  ﬁ les  for  each  speciﬁ c  user.  Earlier,  when  you  customized  Ubuntu’s  look  and  feel,  the  settings  were  applied  only to your current user account. So where are those settings stored?  Inside your home directory are a number of folders that begin with a dot   . , such as .conﬁ g and .mozilla. These folders contain the conﬁ guration  settings for user-speciﬁ c applications. By default, these dot folders are hid- den in the graphical ﬁ le viewer because you rarely need to access them.  You can view these hidden ﬁ les and folders when you are viewing your  home  folder  by  clicking View  >  Show  Hidden  Files  in  the  menu  or  by  pressing Ctrl-H.   162   Chapter 6       Becoming an Ubuntu Power User  Table 6-1  Linux Folders  Folder   Use    boot    dev     etc    lib    mnt    opt    root    bin    sbin    usr     var     This folder contains important ﬁ les to boot the computer, including the  bootloader conﬁ guration and the kernel.    Each device on your system  e.g., sound cards, Webcams  has an entry in  this folder. Each application accesses the device by using the relevant items  inside  dev.   Systemwide conﬁ guration ﬁ les for the software installed on your system are  stored here.   home    Each user account on the system has a home directory that is stored here.   Important system software libraries are stored here. You should never need  to delve into this world of the unknown.   media    Media devices such as CD drives and USB sticks are referenced here when  they are plugged in.  More on this later.    Other devices can be mounted, too.  Again, more on this later.    Optional software can be installed here. This folder is typically used when  you want to build your own software. If you don’t build your own software,  you ignore this folder.   proc sys    Information about the current running status of the system is stored here.   This is the home directory for the main superuser.   Software that is vital for the system to be able to boot is stored here.   Software that should be run only by the superuser is stored here.    General software is installed here.    This folder contains log ﬁ les generated by software on your computer, spool  ﬁ les for your printer, temporary e-mail ﬁ les, and other “variable” data.   Using Windows Files on Another Partition For those of you who spend a considerable amount of your life on Win- dows partitions, you may want to be able to access these partitions from  Ubuntu. This is no problem, although you will need to edit a special con- ﬁ guration ﬁ le to do this. Luckily, you need to edit this ﬁ le only once, and  then everything will be set up.  Ubuntu should automatically recognize any Windows partitions you have  on your computer and set them up for you in the ﬁ le manager; however,       Understanding How Linux Stores and Organizes Files   163  you may need to modify them or add your own. Search for Disks in the  Dash and write down the partition numbers and ﬁ lesystem for your Win- dows partitions. The partition number will look something like  dev hdb1  or  dev sdb1, and the ﬁ lesystem will be either FAT, VFAT, or NTFS.  The next step is to create some mount points. When your Windows par- titions are enabled, they are accessed via a particular folder in Ubuntu.  This is called a mount point. As an example, if you have a mount point as    media win1  and  on  your  Windows  partition  you  want  to  access  your  Work folder, you would access it from Ubuntu as  media win1 work.  Mount points usually live in the  media folder. You can create a different  mount point for each Windows partition. As an example, if you have three  Windows partitions, run the following commands:  foo@bar:~$ sudo mkdir  media win1 foo@bar:~$ sudo mkdir  media win2 foo@bar:~$ sudo mkdir  media win3  Now open up the following conﬁ guration ﬁ le:  foo@bar:~$ sudo gedit  etc fstab  The  etc fstab ﬁ le maps partition numbers to mount points. At the bottom  of the ﬁ le, add a line like this for each mount point:   dev hdb1 media win1 vfat users,rw,owner,umask=000 0 0  You will need to change the partition number  the ﬁ rst column , mount  point  second column , and ﬁ lesystem  third column  for your relevant  partitions.  Now reload  etc fstab to enable the partitions:  foo@bar:~$ sudo mount -a  Some hard disk icons for the new partitions now appear.  TIP   You can ﬁ nd more about fstab at https:  help.ubuntu.com community Fstab.   164   Chapter 6       Becoming an Ubuntu Power User  Learning Unity Keyboard Shortcuts Using a mouse or touchscreen is intuitive because of the direct interaction  between your hand, your eyes, and the cursor, but for repeated actions, key- board shortcuts enable you to work  and play  faster. There’s no need to  take the time to pick up your hand, move it to a different spot on the desk  or screen, click or tap something, move your hand back to the keyboard to  type a few letters, go back to the mouse or screen, and so on. The more you  can do from one place, the more efﬁ cient your actions will be. Here is a list  of things you can do with Unity without moving your hands away from the  keyboard. Of course, you don’t have to do things this way, but power users  love to save time and energy, even if it means spending a little more time up  front learning how; in the long term, the savings add up.  The Super key is used for several of the shortcuts. It is sometimes known  as the Windows key. In the following tables, it is simply called Super.

Using the Terminal Although Ubuntu is a desktop-driven OS, the system runs on a powerful  and incredibly ﬂ exible command-line core. Inspired by more than 30 years  of  UNIX  heritage,  the  command-line  environment  present  on  Linux    168   Chapter 6       Becoming an Ubuntu Power User  systems enables you to perform some incredibly powerful tasks by string- ing together different commands in different ways.  The philosophy behind UNIX is to create a large number of small tools,  each of which is designed to do one task but do it incredibly well. As a  quick example to whet your appetite, there is a command called  ls that  does nothing more than list ﬁ les in a folder. Although listing ﬁ les is its sin- gular function in life, it has every option imaginable for listing ﬁ les.  Now, ls is limited by itself, but it can be combined with other commands  that have equal levels of ﬂ exibility to create impressively powerful combi- nations. To do this, a pipeline is created using the  symbol to connect these  different commands. Pipelines can be constructed in any number of ways,  and once the user has even a basic knowledge of what a few different com- mands do, stringing together a pipeline of commands can solve virtually  any task you can imagine in quick and powerful ways.  It should be made 100 percent clear that using the command line is not an  essential skill required to use Ubuntu, but it is a skill that can increase the  ﬂ exibility of your computer for more advanced, customized tasks. Rather  than cover the use of the Terminal here, we have included an excellent in- troduction to it in Chapter 7, and we strongly recommend that all who  seek to become power users read it.  Working with Windows Programs Although Linux offers an increasingly compelling platform for the desktop,  some situations arise in which there is just no alternative other than an ap- plication written for Windows. This is generally the case with speciﬁ c busi- ness applications, some educational tools, and many games. Luckily, there  is a way you can run many of these applications on your Ubuntu desktop.  For more than 20 years, the Wine project team members have been work- ing to create a free way to run Windows applications on Linux. While not  every application works perfectly, and some don’t work at all, the number  of programs that do work in Wine has dramatically increased and contin- ues to do so. However, it is recommended that you thoroughly test the ap- plications you want to run in Wine before you use them for important       Installing Software from PPAs   169  work. If you run into trouble, try consulting help resources, use virtualiza- tion to run Windows on top of Ubuntu, or search for a different applica- tion to use.  TIP   You can ﬁ nd some useful help resources for Wine at www.winehq.org help , and you can  learn more about alternatives to Wine at www.winehq.org docs wineusr-guide alternatives.  You can also check whether the program you want to run has been tested for application  compatibility with Wine at http:  appdb.winehq.org.  Install  the  Wine  package  from  the  GNOME  Software  Center  or  simply  double-click an .exe ﬁ le, and you will be prompted to install the package.  You can conﬁ gure Wine by searching for Wine Applications in the Appli- cations Dash after clicking the Applications icon in the Launcher. Your  C:\ drive will appear in your Places menu for easy access, and you will be  able to uninstall Wine from the GNOME Software Center.  To run an application, simply double-click on the install .exe ﬁ le. Once it is  installed you will be able to search for Wine in the Dash.  TIP   You  can  ﬁ nd  even  more  about  Wine  from  the  Ubuntu  perspective  at  https:  help.ubuntu .com community Wine.  Installing Software from PPAs Sometimes software is not available in the Ubuntu repositories; perhaps it  is too new, perhaps there is a new version available, or perhaps it is soft- ware that no one has had the opportunity to build and get approved for  inclusion in the Ubuntu repositories. You can often ﬁ nd this software in a  Personal Package Archive  PPA . The main Launchpad page for PPAs says,  “Personal  Package  Archives   PPA   allow  you  to  upload  Ubuntu  source  packages  to  be  built  and  published  as  an  apt  repository  by  Launchpad”   see https:  launchpad.net ubuntu +ppas .  In  short,  a  PPA  is  a  small  repository  that  contains  software  that  is  not  found  in  the  main  Ubuntu  repositories,  perhaps  for  one  of  the  reasons  listed earlier or for other reasons. If a software package or version you want  to install is not available from the main Ubuntu repositories, use your Web    170   Chapter 6       Becoming an Ubuntu Power User  browser to search the main Launchpad site for the software and see if a  PPA exists.  TIP   Be Careful! Some PPAs are created for development or for beta or even alpha testing. They are not guar- anteed to include stable or well-tested software. Anyone is allowed to create a PPA and there  is no review procedure, so you’ll also want to install only PPAs from sources you trust. Use  at your own risk.  For our example, we install a bleeding-edge testing version of LibreOfﬁ ce.  Unless you absolutely need something offered from a PPA, we suggest you  stick with packages from the Ubuntu repositories.  To add the PPA to your system, make a note of its location from the spe- ciﬁ c PPA’s Web page in Launchpad. In this case, the PPA is at ppa:libreof- ﬁ ce ppa, as seen in Figure 6-8.  The easiest way to add the PPA is to use the terminal. Enter the following  commands at the command line to add the LibreOfﬁ ce PPA and to update  your package manager’s listing:  $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreofﬁ ce ppa $ sudo apt-get update  Then, you can access the contents of the PPA from your preferred pack- age  manager:  GNOME  Software  Center,  Synaptic,  the  command  line,  and so on.  Figure 6-8  You can ﬁ nd technical details and installation instructions on  all PPA pages.      Compiling Software from Source   171  If you later wish to remove the PPA, you can use this tool again but with  the --remove option.  $ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:libreofﬁ ce ppa $ sudo apt-get update  Finally, if you want to remove the PPA and downgrade back to the version  of software you had before using the PPA, you can install and use the  ppa-purge tool.  $ sudo apt-get install ppa-purge $ sudo ppa-purge ppa:libreofﬁ ce ppa  Compiling Software from Source Some software cannot be found in any repository. The traditional way of  installing software on Linux works just as well on Ubuntu. Download your  software and put it in an otherwise empty directory. Sometimes, it will in- clude installation instructions. If so, follow them. Most instructions will be  the same as those listed here.  Before you can install a source code package, it must be compiled into a  binary  that  your  computer  can  run.  For  that,  you  need  to  install  some  packages that are not included by default. All you should need is included  as a dependency of one package. Install it, and you should be all set.  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential  Next, browse to the directory where you placed the downloaded source  code. It was most likely provided as a compressed archive, with a ﬁ lename  extension like tar.gz or tar.bz2. Decompress the archive with the appropri- ate command, depending on the ﬁ lename extension:  $ tar -zxvf ﬁ le.tar.gz $ tar -xvjf ﬁ le.tar.bz2  Next, build the package. This step checks whether you have the required  dependencies installed and will tell you if you don’t—if not, you need to    172   Chapter 6       Becoming an Ubuntu Power User  install them separately, by using Synaptic or via the command line with  apt. This step will also build the package from source code into some- thing installable.  $ make  $ sudo make install  Next, install the package. The traditional way is to use this command:  Although  this  technique  works,  there  is  a  better  method.  Using  make  install will install the package, but it will not use your package manager  to do so. If you ever want to remove the package from your system, it can  be quite a chore to ﬁ gure out how. Instead, install the software with the  following command:  $ sudo apt-get install checkinstall  Like any software installed from an ofﬁ cial repository, it can be removed  using your package manager:  $ sudo checkinstall  Summary In this chapter, we looked at a variety of advanced subjects related to run- ning and managing your Ubuntu system. Changing settings on your desk- top,  including  addition  of  users  and  changes  to  security  and  privacy  settings, was discussed. We then covered the basic structure of the ﬁ le sys- tem and saw how to manually add windows ﬁ les to be accessible from your  desktop. Unity keyboard shortcuts were then covered in depth, and exam- ples demonstrated how you can use them to be more efﬁ cient with your  actions. We also touched upon installation of software from PPAs, which  include newer versions, development versions, and other unpackaged soft- ware that does not come with Ubuntu. Finally, we looked at a possibility of  running certain programs written for Microsoft Windows under Ubuntu  and even compiling software from source code.   7  C H A P T E R   7 Welcome to the Command Line  Starting Up the Terminal       Getting Started     Building Pipelines     Running Commands as Superuser       Moving around the Filesystem     Manipulating Files and Folders   System Information Commands   Searching and Editing Text Files  Finding Help  Searching for Man Files      Dealing with Users and Groups     Getting Help on the Command Line       Using Wildcards       Moving to More Advanced Uses of the Command Line      Executing Multiple Commands  Summary        173                 ONE OF THE MOST powerful parts of any Ubuntu system is the command  line. It can also be one of the most daunting to dive into. It seems there is  often little help, and that the commands are not easy to ﬁ nd or ﬁ gure out.  If you are willing to learn, the power of the command line will speed up  your work and will be a great education that serves you for years by in- creasing your ability to do exactly what you want to do with your com- puter with greater efﬁ ciency.  While  the  command  line  is  a  nice  addition  to  a  desktop  user’s  life,  it  is  completely invaluable if you run a server. The Ubuntu server installs with- out any graphical user interface  GUI , so the tools explained in this chap- ter and other books are absolutely critical to success. And hey, remember  to have fun!  Starting Up the Terminal The  terminal  can  be  found  by  clicking  the  tooltip  or  Dash  Home  icon   Figure 7-1 —it has the Ubuntu symbol on it and should be the ﬁ rst icon  found at the top of your Launcher. This opens the Dash. In the Dash, type  terminal to ﬁ nd Terminal  Figure 7-2 . When it ﬁ rst launches, you will see  something similar to what Figure 7-3 shows.  Figure 7-1  The Dash Home icon  Figure 7-2  The Dash with the Terminal search  174      Getting Started   175  Figure 7-3  The Terminal window  You will see a blinking cursor immediately preceded by some letters, and  perhaps  numbers  and  symbols,  ending  with  a  $.  The  ﬁ rst  word  in  that  string of characters is your username, followed by the @ symbol. After the  @, the hostname of your computer is listed, followed by a colon and the  name of the directory you are currently in  you always start in your home  directory, which is represented by a ~ symbol .  There are many dozens of commands. This chapter presents just a few use- ful ones in a narrative style to get you started, then lists some more with  just a basic description and organized by category.  Getting Started First have a look at the ﬁ les in your home folder by running the following  command:  username@computer:~$ ls  The  ls command lists the ﬁ les in your current folder. The default com- mand just displays a collection of items that are in your current directory,    176   Chapter 7       Welcome to the Command Line  meaning your location in the ﬁ lesystem. To make ls more useful, you can  type it with options:  username@computer:~$ ls -al  The -al parts are options that can be passed to the command. In this ex- ample, two options, a  list all ﬁ les  and l  use a long display format to dis- play ﬁ le permissions, dates, sizes, and more , are used with ls to display all  of the ﬁ les  including hidden ﬁ les  and their details.  TIP   To Dash or Not to Dash? In many command-line tools, options are added after a dash  - . Some tools, however, don’t  need the dash. Use of the dash isn’t particularly consistent across the various tools, so you  must pay attention as you learn new commands.  Now move to a different directory:  username@computer:~$ cd Desktop  The  cd command changes the directory to the place you specify after the  command  in this case, the desktop directory . A nice shortcut that you can  use when typing ﬁ les and folders is to type the ﬁ rst few letters and then press  the Tab key to ﬁ ll in the remainder of the ﬁ le folder name. As an example, in  the previous command, you could type cd Des and press the Tab key to ﬁ ll in  the rest of Desktop  with the   added automatically because it is a directory .  When inside a directory, you may want to have a quick look at the contents  of a text ﬁ le. To do this, use the cat command:  username@computer:~$ cat myﬁ le.txt  This command prints the contents of the ﬁ le on the screen  a more correct  way to say this in computer geek jargon would be “outputs to the screen” .  Building Pipelines The power of the command line really comes into its own when you start  to pass the output of one command so that it serves as the input of the       Running Commands as Superuser   177  next command, combining commands by using pipelines. A pipeline uses  the pipe symbol    to string together a number of commands to perform  a speciﬁ c task. As an example, if you use the cat command to display the  contents of a ﬁ le to the screen, but the ﬁ le scrolls past you too fast, create a  pipeline and use the less command so you can browse the ﬁ le:  username@computer:~$ cat foo.txt  less  To see how this works, break the command into parts, each separated by  the pipe. The output of the part on the left  cat’ing the ﬁ le  is fed into the  less command on the right, which allows you to browse the ﬁ le with the  arrow keys.  Pipelines can be useful for ﬁ nding speciﬁ c information on the system. As  an  example,  if  you  want  to  ﬁ nd  out  how  many  particular  processes  are  running, you could run a command like this:  username@computer:~$ ps ax  grep getty  wc -l  Here you count how many getty processes are running  getty is the soft- ware that runs a console session . The ps ax command on the left lists the  processes on the system, and then the grep command searches through the  process list and returns only the lines that contain the text “getty.” Finally,  these lines are fed into wc, which is a small tool that counts the number of  words or lines. The -l option speciﬁ es that the number of lines should be  counted. Cool, huh?  Running Commands as Superuser When you log in to your computer, the account you use is a normal user  account.  This  account  is  restricted  from  performing  various  system  ad- ministration tasks. The security model behind Ubuntu has you run as a  normal user all the time and dip into the system administrator account  only when you need to. This prevents accidental changes or malicious in- stallation of unwanted programs and similar things.  To jump to this superuser account when using the terminal, put the sudo command before the command you want to run. As an example, if you    178   Chapter 7       Welcome to the Command Line  want to restart the networking system from the command line, give this  command:  username@computer:~$ sudo apt-get install byobu  The command to the right of sudo is the command that should be run as  the administrator, but sudo lets you run it as the current user. When you  run this command, you are asked for the administrator password. This is  the same password that you established for the ﬁ rst user you added when  you installed Ubuntu on the computer. If you are using that user’s account,  just enter your normal password. In this instance, you are installing byobu,  which you can use to make your life in the terminal easier.  TIP   Byobu Byobu is a Japanese term for decorative, multipanel screens that serve as folding room di- viders. As an open source project, byobu is an elegant enhancement of the otherwise func- tional, plain, practical GNU screen. Byobu includes an enhanced proﬁ le and conﬁ guration  utilities for the GNU screen window manager, such as toggle-able system status notiﬁ ca- tions. More about byobu can be found at http:  manpages.ubuntu.com manpages xenial en  man1 byobu.1.html.  When you have authenticated yourself to sudo using the terminal, you will  not be asked for the password again for another 15 minutes.  Finding Help Each  command  on  your  computer  includes  a  manual  page—or  man  page—that contains a list of the options available. Man pages are tradi- tionally rather terse and intended only for referencing the different ways  the command should be used. For a friendlier introduction to using com- mands, we recommend a Google search.  To view a man page  such as the man page for ls , run this command:  username@computer:~$ man ls  The man page command itself has a number of options  run man man to see  them , and one of the most useful is -k. This option allows you to search  the man pages for a particular word. This is useful when you don’t remem-      Moving around the Filesystem   179  ber the command. As an example, you could ﬁ nd all commands related to  processes by giving this command:  username@computer:~$ man -k processes  TIP   Ubuntu Manpage Repository This  site  contains  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dynamically  generated  manuals  from  every  package of every supported version of Ubuntu, and it’s updated on a daily basis. Manpages,  as described earlier, are traditionally viewed from the command line, but thanks to Dustin  Kirkland, Ubuntu users now have all the manuals included in Ubuntu in an HTML, Web- browsable format. This repository can be found at http:  manpages.ubuntu.com.  The  remainder  of  this  chapter  gives  a  brief  introduction  to  some  of  the  more common and useful commands you will encounter and want to learn,  organized in categories based on how they are used. We end with a short list  of some other resources for further research.  Moving around the Filesystem Commands for navigating in the ﬁ lesystem include the following.        pwd: The pwd command allows you to know the directory in which  you’re located  pwd stands for “print working directory” . For example,  pwd in the desktop directory will show ~ Desktop. Note that the GNOME  terminal also displays this information in the title bar of its window.  cd: The cd command allows you to change directories. When you  open a terminal, you will be in your home directory. To move around  the ﬁ lesystem, use cd.     Use cd ~ Desktop to navigate to your desktop directory.     Use cd   to navigate into the root directory.     Use cd to navigate to your home directory.     Use cd .. to navigate up one directory level.     Use cd - to navigate to the previous directory  or back .       If you want to go directly to a speciﬁ c, known directory location  at once, use cd  directory otherdirectory. For example, cd   var www will take you directly to the  www subdirectory of  var.         180   Chapter 7       Welcome to the Command Line  Manipulating Files and Folders You can manipulate ﬁ les and folders with the following commands.     cp: The cp command makes a copy of a ﬁ le for you. For example, cp ﬁ le  foo makes an exact copy of the ﬁ le whose name you entered and names  the copy foo, but the ﬁ rst ﬁ le will still exist with its original name.    mv: The mv command moves a ﬁ le to a different location or renames a    ﬁ le. Examples are as follows: mv ﬁ le foo renames the original ﬁ le to foo.  mv foo ~ Desktop moves the ﬁ le foo to your desktop directory but does  not rename it. You must specify a new ﬁ lename to rename a ﬁ le. After  you use mv, the original ﬁ le no longer exists, but after you use cp, as  noted previously, that ﬁ le continues to exist and a new copy is made.    To save on typing, you can substitute ~ in place of the home directory,     so  home username pictures is the same as ~ pictures.  NOTE   If you are using mv with sudo, which is often necessary outside of your home directory,  you will not be able to use the ~ shortcut. Instead, you will have to use the full pathnames  to your ﬁ les.           rm: Use this command to remove or delete a ﬁ le in your directory, as in  rm ﬁ le.txt. It does not work on directories that contain ﬁ les, which  must ﬁ rst be emptied and may then be deleted using the rmdir com- mand. There are some advanced cases where you may use rm to remove  directories, but discussing those are beyond the intent of this chapter.  ls: The ls command shows you the ﬁ les in your current directory.  Used with certain options, it lets you see ﬁ le sizes, when ﬁ les where  created, and ﬁ le permissions. For example, ls ~ shows you the ﬁ les  that are in your home directory.    mkdir: The mkdir command allows you to create directories. For     example, mkdir music creates a music directory.  chmod: The chmod command changes the permissions on the ﬁ les  listed. Permissions are based on a fairly simple model. You can set  permissions for user, group, and world, and you can specify whether  each can read, write, and or execute the ﬁ le. For example, if               System Information Commands   181  everybody is allowed to read a ﬁ le but only the user can write to that  ﬁ le, the permissions would read rwxr—r—. To add or remove a permis- sion, you append a plus sign  +  or a minus sign  -  in front of the  speciﬁ c permission. For example, to allow the group to edit the ﬁ le in  the previous example, you could type chmod g+w ﬁ le.  chown: The chown command allows the user to change the user and  group ownerships of a ﬁ le. For example, sudo chown jim ﬁ le changes  the ownership of the ﬁ le to Jim.  System Information Commands System information commands include the following.  df: The df command displays ﬁ lesystem disk space usage for all  partitions. The command df -h is probably the most useful. It uses  megabytes  M  and gigabytes  G  instead of blocks to report.  -h means  “human-readable.”   free: The free command displays the amount of free and used memory  in the system. For example, free -m gives the information using mega- bytes, which is probably most useful for current computers.  top: The top command displays information on your Linux system,  running processes, and system resources, including the CPU, RAM,  swap usage, and total number of tasks being run. To exit top, press Q.    uname -a: The uname command with the -a option prints all system    information, including machine name, kernel name, version, and a  few other details. This command is most useful for checking which  kernel you’re using.  lsb_release -a: The lsb_release command with the -a option prints  version information for the Linux release you’re running. For example:                 username@computer:~$ lsb_release -a  No LSB modules are available. Distributor ID:  Ubuntu Description:  Release:  Codename:   Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 16.04 xenial             182   Chapter 7       Welcome to the Command Line                          ifconﬁ g: The ifconﬁ g command reports on your system’s net- work interfaces. iwconﬁ g: The iwconﬁ g command shows you any wireless network  adapters and the wireless-speciﬁ c information from them, such  as speed and network connected. ps: The ps command allows you to view all the processes running  on the machine.  The following commands list the hardware on your computer, either of a  speciﬁ c type or with a speciﬁ c method. They are most useful for debug- ging when a piece of hardware does not function correctly.  lspci: The lspci command lists all PCI buses and devices connected  to them. This commonly includes network cards and sound cards. lsusb: The lsusb command lists all USB buses and any connected  USB devices, such as printers and thumb drives.  lshal: The lshal command lists all devices the hardware abstraction  layer  HAL  knows about, which should be most hardware on  your system.   Searching and Editing Text Files Search and edit text ﬁ les by using the following commands.  grep: The grep command allows you to search inside a number of  ﬁ les for a particular search pattern and then print matching lines. For  example, grep blah ﬁ le will search for the text “blah” in the ﬁ le and  then print any matching lines. sed: The sed  or Stream EDitor  command allows you to search for  and replace a particular string in a ﬁ le. For example, if you want to  ﬁ nd the string “cat” and replace all the instances of it with “dog” in a  ﬁ le named pets, type sed s cat dog g pets. In contrast, typing sed  s cat dog  pets  without the “g” after the ﬁ nal slash  will replace  only the ﬁ rst instance of the word “cat” in the pets ﬁ le.  Both grep and sed are extremely powerful programs. Many excellent tuto- rials are available that explain how to use them, but here are a couple of  good Web sites to get you started:                      Dealing with Users and Groups   183                    https:  help.ubuntu.com community grep http:  manpages.ubuntu.com manpages xenial man1 9base-sed.1.html  Five other commands are useful for dealing with text.  cat: The cat command, short for “concatenate,” is useful for viewing  and adding to text ﬁ les. The simple command cat filename displays  the contents of the ﬁ le. Using cat filename ﬁ le adds the contents of  the ﬁ rst ﬁ le to the second and displays both on the screen, one after  the other. You could also use cat ﬁ le1 >> ﬁ le2 to append the contents  of ﬁ le1 to the end of ﬁ le2.    nano: Nano is a simple text editor for the command line. To open a    ﬁ le, use nano filename. Commands listed at the bottom of the screen  are accessed via pressing Ctrl followed by the letter. To close and save  a ﬁ le you are working on, use Ctrl-X. less: The less command is used for viewing text ﬁ les as well as  standard output. A common usage is to pipe another command  through less to be able to see all the output, such as ls  less.       head: The head command is used for viewing the ﬁ rst 10 lines of text     ﬁ les as well as standard output. A common usage is to pipe another  command through head to be able to see varying lines of output, such  as ls  head. tail: The tail command is used for viewing the last 10 lines of text ﬁ les  as well as standard output. A common usage is to pipe another  command through tail to be able to see varying lines of output, such  as ls  tail.  Dealing with Users and Groups You can use the following commands to administer users and groups.  adduser: The adduser command creates a new user. To create a new  user, simply type sudo adduser loginname. This creates the user’s home  directory and default group. It prompts for a user password and then  further details about the user. passwd: The passwd command changes the user’s password. If run by  a regular user, it will change his or her password. If run using sudo, it                  184   Chapter 7       Welcome to the Command Line  can change any user’s password. For example, sudo passwd joe changes  Joe’s password.    who: The who command tells you who is currently logged into the     machine.               addgroup: The addgroup command adds a new group. To create a  new group, type sudo addgroup groupname.  deluser: The deluser command removes a user from the system. To  remove the user’s ﬁ les and home directory, you need to add the  -remove-home option.  delgroup: The delgroup command removes a group from the system.  You cannot remove a group that is the primary group of any users.  chgrp: The chgrp command changes group ownership of ﬁ les and  directories.   Getting Help on the Command Line This section provides you with some tips for getting help on the command  line. The commands —help and man are the two most important tools at the  command line.  Virtually all commands understand the -h  or --help  option, which pro- duces a short usage description of the command and its options, then exits  back to the command prompt. Try man -h or man --help to see this in action.  Every command and nearly every application in Linux has a man  man- ual  ﬁ le, so ﬁ nding such a ﬁ le is as simple as typing man command to bring up  a  longer  manual  entry  for  the  speciﬁ ed  command.  For  example,  man  mv  brings up the mv  move  manual.  Some helpful tips for using the man command include the following.    Arrow keys: Move up and down the man ﬁ le by using the arrow keys.       q: Quit back to the command prompt by typing q.    man man: man man brings up the manual entry for the man command,     which is a good place to start!                Using Wildcards   185    man intro: man intro is especially useful. It displays the Introduction    to User Commands, which is a well-written, fairly brief introduction  to the Linux command line.  There are also info pages, which generally offer more in-depth informa- tion than man pages. Try info info for the introduction to info pages.  Searching for Man Files If you aren’t sure which command or application you need to use, you can  try searching the man ﬁ les.    man -k foo: This searches the man ﬁ les for foo. Try man -k nautilus to     see how it works.  NOTE   man -k foo is the same as the apropos command.    man -f foo: This searches only the titles of your system’s man ﬁ les. Try     man -f unity, for example.  NOTE   man -f foo is the same as the whatis command.  Using Wildcards Sometimes you need to look at or use multiple ﬁ les at the same time. For  instance, you might want to delete all .rar ﬁ les or move all .odt ﬁ les to an- other directory. Thankfully, you can use a series of wildcards to accom- plish such tasks.         * matches any number of characters. For example, *.rar matches any  ﬁ le with the ending .rar.  ? matches any single character. For example, ?.rar matches a.rar but  not ab.rar.       186   Chapter 7       Welcome to the Command Line        [characters] matches any of the characters within the brackets. For  example, [ab].rar matches a.rar and b.rar but not c.rar.  *[!characters] matches any characters that are not listed. For exam- ple, *[!ab].rar matches c.rar but not a.rar or b.rar.  Executing Multiple Commands Often  you  may  want  to  execute  several  commands  together,  either  by  running them one after another or by passing output from one command  to another.   Running Sequentially If you need to execute multiple commands in sequence but don’t need to  pass output between them, there are two options based on whether the  subsequent commands should run only if the previous commands suc- ceed  or not . If you want the commands to run one after the other regard- less  of  whether  preceding  commands  succeed,  place  a  semicolon   ;   between  the  commands.  For  example,  if  you  want  to  get  information  about your hardware, you could run  lspci;  lsusb, which would output  information on your PCI buses and USB devices in sequence.  However, if you need to conditionally run the commands based on whether  the  previous  command  has  succeeded,  insert  &&  between  commands.  An   example of this is building a program from source, which is traditionally  done  with  . conﬁ gure,  make,  and  sudo  make  install.  The  commands  make and sudo make install require that the previous commands have completed  successfully, so you would use . conﬁ gure && make && sudo make install.  Using Byobu to Manage Your Terminal One of the challenges of using the terminal is the difﬁ culty of managing  multiple screens. If you are in a desktop environment, you can launch an- other terminal window or use the GNOME terminal’s tabs, but if you are  on a server or another machine that doesn’t have a desktop environment  installed, that strategy won’t work.  Thankfully, such a tool to help you does exist: byobu. Japanese for “screen,”  byobu  is  a  set  of  default  conﬁ gurations  for  the  GNU  screen  command.           Executing Multiple Commands   187  Essentially, screen is a window manager for the command line. To install  byobu, type sudo apt-get install byobu.  After byobu is started, you will notice you are back at a terminal prompt,  but  with  a  few  differences. At  the  bottom  are  two  lines  of  information.  From left to right, the bottom line shows the version of Ubuntu you are  currently running, the number of packages to update  if there are none,  this won’t appear , how long the system has been running, the system load,  the CPU speed, the current memory usage, and the current date and time.  The upper bar shows the list of open windows, the current logged-in user,  the system name, and the menu option  Figure 7-4 .  You can now use your terminal exactly as you normally would, just with a  few added pieces of information. Advanced use of byobu  and screen  is a  topic too large for this chapter, but a few commands are described here to  get you started:           F2: Open new terminal window.  F3 F4: Move backward forward through the list of windows.  F6: Detach from the current byobu session. To reattach, use byobu -x.  Figure 7-4  Byobu in GNOME terminal         188   Chapter 7       Welcome to the Command Line  F7: Scroll back through the output. Press Esc to exit this mode and  return to the command prompt.           F8: Set the window title to a custom title.  F9: Launch the menu.  Using Byobu by Default in GNOME Terminal To have the GNOME terminal launch byobu by default when it starts, you  need to edit the preferences, which can be found at Edit > Proﬁ le Prefer- ences  under  the  Title  and  Command  tab.  Tick  the  box  Run  a  Custom  Command Instead of My Shell, and enter byobu in the line below. Now  when you launch the GNOME terminal, byobu will launch with it, and  closing byobu will close the GNOME terminal as well.  Moving to More Advanced Uses  of the Command Line There are a great number of good books out there for working the com- mand  line.  In  addition,  because  most  of  the  command  line  has  not  changed in many years, a large body of information is available on the In- ternet.  If  you  need  help  with  something,  often  simply  searching  for  the  command will turn up what you need.  As you can imagine, there are hundreds and hundreds of different com- mands available on the system, and we don’t have the space to cover them  here. A number of superb Web sites and books can help you ﬁ nd out about  the many different commands.  To get you started, here are some recommendations.    The Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Server Book, third edition, by Kyle Rankin and    Benjamin Mako Hill  Prentice Hall, 2013  is an excellent resource for  learning all things server related, including the effective use of the  command line to accomplish administration tasks.    A Practical Guide to Linux® Commands, Editors, and Shell Pro-    gramming, third edition, by Mark G. Sobell  Prentice Hall, 2012  is             Summary   189  an excellent book for any user of the shell in Linux to have on his or  her bookshelf.    Ubuntu Unleashed 2016, by Matthew Helmke  SAMS 2015 , who is     also the lead author of this book, is the premier broad-scoped,  Ubuntu-focused book for intermediate to advanced users or those  who want to become one.     LinuxCommand.org, found at http:  linuxcommand.org, is a useful  Web site designed to help people new to using the command line.    The Linux Documentation Project, found at www.tdlp.org, is     another quality free resource.  Summary The command line is a bit intimidating for newcomers, but it doesn’t need  to be. When you take the time to understand its power and the logic be- hind  the  commands  you  have  available,  you  begin  to  discover  the  true  power of Linux. Elegance, efﬁ ciency, and the ability to combine commands  in new ways make the command line something that, once you learn the  basics, you will ﬁ nd indispensable.

Installing Ubuntu Server     Ubuntu Package Management     Ubuntu Server Security     Advanced Topics      Summary         191       UBUNTU 4.10 WAS THE ﬁ rst public version of Ubuntu. Its installation media  provided no obvious way to install the bare-bones OS without a full desk- top  environment.  The  system  administrator  crowds,  easily  irritable  and  feisty by nature, were greatly annoyed: they proclaimed Ubuntu was just a  desktop distribution and sauntered back to their caves in contempt.   The next release of Ubuntu that came out, Ubuntu 5.04, rectiﬁ ed the prob- lem and allowed for trivial installation of a minimal Ubuntu version suit- able  for  servers.  Yet  the  myth  of  Ubuntu  as  a  purely  desktop-oriented  distribution stuck.  Luckily, the sentiment is just that—a myth. Ubuntu is a world-class server  platform today, providing everything you’d expect from a server OS and  with the human ﬂ avor that makes Ubuntu different. The dedicated hack- ers on the Ubuntu Server Team tend to the minutiae of hardware support  and  testing,  mercilessly  beat  on  the  latest  version  of  server  software  to  make sure it’s up to snuff for inclusion in the distribution, look for ways  to  push  innovation  into  the  server  ﬁ eld,  and  are  available  to  users  like  you to ﬁ eld feedback, questions, and cries of anguish.  That said, setting up a server is no small task. Server administrators con- stantly deal with complex issues such as system security, fault tolerance,  and  data  safety,  and  while  Ubuntu  makes  these  issues  more  pleasant  to  deal with, they’re not to be taken lightly. The aim of this chapter is thus not  to teach you how to be a system administrator—we could easily ﬁ ll a dozen  books attempting to do that—but rather to give you a quick crash course.  We also highlight the speciﬁ c details that set Ubuntu Server apart from  other  server  platforms,  offer  tips  on  some  of  the  most  common  server  uses, and give you pointers on where to ﬁ nd other relevant information.   What Is Ubuntu Server? By far the most common reaction from users ﬁ rst encountering Ubuntu  Server is one of utter and hopeless confusion. People are foggy on whether  Ubuntu Server is a whole new distribution, an Ubuntu ﬂ avor like Kubuntu   only for servers , or perhaps something else entirely.  192   What Is Ubuntu Server?   193  Let’s clear things up a bit. The primary software source for Ubuntu and its  ﬂ avors is called the Ubuntu archive. The archive is merely a collection of  software  packages  in  Debian “deb”  format,  and  it  contains  every  single  package  that  makes  up  ﬂ avors  such  as  Ubuntu,  Edubuntu,  Xubuntu,  Kubuntu,  and  Ubuntu  Server.  What  makes  Kubuntu  separate  from  Ubuntu, then, is only the set of packages from the archive that its installer  installs by default and that its DVDs carry.  Ubuntu Server is no different. It depends on the very same archive as the  standard  Ubuntu  distribution,  but  it  installs  a  distinctive  set  of  default  packages. Notably, the set of packages that make up Ubuntu Server is very  small. The installer will not install things such as a graphical environment  or many user programs by default. But because all the packages for Ubuntu  Server come from the same ofﬁ cial Ubuntu archive, you can install any  package you like later. In theory, there’s nothing stopping you from trans- forming an Ubuntu Server installation into a regular Ubuntu desktop in- stallation, or vice versa  in practice, this is tricky, and we don’t recommend  that  you  try  it .  You  can  even  go  from  running  Kubuntu  to  running  Ubuntu Server. The archive paradigm gives you maximum ﬂ exibility.  We’ve established that Ubuntu Server just provides a different set of de- fault packages than Ubuntu. But what’s important about that different set?  What makes Ubuntu Server a server platform?  The  most  signiﬁ cant  difference  is  the  custom  server  kernel.  This  kernel  employs an internal timer frequency of 100Hz instead of the desktop de- fault of 250Hz, uses the deadline I O scheduler instead of the desktop’s  CFQ scheduler, and contains a batch of other minor tweaks for virtualiza- tion, memory support, and routing. We’ll spare you the OS theory: The  idea is to offer some extra performance and throughput for server applica- tions. In addition, the server kernel supports basic NUMA, a memory de- sign used in some multiprocessor systems that can dramatically increase  multiprocessing performance.  So what else is different in Ubuntu Server? Other than the server kernel  and a minimal set of packages, not too much. Although Ubuntu has sup- ported a minimal installation mode for a number of releases, spinning off    194   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  Ubuntu Server into a separate product that truly stands on its own is still a  young effort, but one that’s moving along very quickly.  Starting with Ubuntu Server 6.06 LTS, Ubuntu Server offers ofﬁ cially sup- ported packages for the Red Hat Cluster Suite, Red Hat’s Global File Sys- tem   GFS ,  Oracle’s  OCFS2  ﬁ lesystem,  and  the  Linux  Virtual  Server  utilities:  keepalived  and  ipvsadm.  Combined  with  the  specialized  server  kernel, these bits already let you use your Ubuntu Server for some heavy  lifting.  And  there’s  a  growing  lineup  of  compelling  features,  including  built-in  virtualization,  interoperability  with  Windows  machines  on  the  network through Samba, automatic version control for conﬁ guration ﬁ les,  support for LDAP directory services, hard drive replication over the net- work, and even a healthy dose of the latest buzzword—cloud computing.  Installing Ubuntu Server So you’ve downloaded your server package from http:  releases.ubuntu. com 16.04  and burned it, eagerly placed it in your CD drive, and rebooted  the machine to be greeted by the friendly Ubuntu menu. The ﬁ rst option,  Install Ubuntu Server, marks the beginning of a journey toward your very  own system administrator cave.  A while ago, the process of installing Ubuntu Server was identical to in- stalling  a  desktop.  Both  installations  were  performed  with  a  textual  in- staller, a charmingly quaint combination of red and blue screens with text  all over. Since then, the desktop version’s installer has been replaced by a  beautiful  graphical  environment  that  lets  you  play  with  a  fully  usable  Ubuntu setup right off the install CD. But the Server CD retained its red  and blue colors; because the textual installer doesn’t rely on automatically  detecting ﬁ nicky graphics cards, it’s just about certain to work on most any  piece of hardware you can get your hands on. And when you’re installing a  server, that’s worth more than all the eye candy in the world.  Here, we look at some of the advanced textual installer gadgetry that is  particularly geared toward server users.   The neat stuff begins when you arrive at the partitioning section of the  installer. With a desktop machine, you’d probably let the installer conﬁ g-      Installing Ubuntu Server   195  ure a basic set of partitions by itself and go on its merry way. But with  servers, things get a bit more complicated.   A Couple of Installer Tricks As we’ll explore below, in terms of partitioning and storage, server installa- tions can be quite a bit more complex than desktop ones. There’s a small  bag of useful tricks with the installer that can help when things get hairy.   The installer itself runs on virtual console 1. If you switch to console 2 by  pressing Alt-F2, you’ll be able to activate the console by pressing Enter and  land in a minimalistic  busybox  shell. This will let you explore the com- plete installer environment and take some matters into your own hands if  necessary. You can switch back to the installer console by pressing Alt-F1.  Console 4 contains a running, noninteractive log ﬁ le of the installation,  which you can inspect by pressing Alt-F4. Finally, it’s sometimes useful to  be able to connect to another server during installation, perhaps to upload  a log ﬁ le or to gain access to your mailbox or other communication. By  default, the shell on console 2 will not provide you with an ssh client, but  you can install one by running anna-install  openssh-client-udeb  after  the installer has conﬁ gured the network. Now you can use the ssh and scp binaries to log in or copy data to the server of your choice.  Partitioning Your Ubuntu Server Deciding how to partition the storage in your server is a tricky affair and  certainly no exact science. Generally, it’s a good idea to have at least three  partitions separate from the rest of the system:            home: where all the user ﬁ les will live  tmp: temporary scratch space for running applications  var: mail spools and log ﬁ les  TIP   Partition Security and Separating Logs and Spools There are several options that you can turn on for speciﬁ c system partitions that afford you  extra security. We explain them later in this chapter, in the section dealing with security.  As an aside, if your server will keep extensive mail and news spools, you might want to fur- ther separate  var into partitions for  var log and  var spool. Having them both on the same  partition might cause severe I O congestion under heavy use.         196   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  Keeping data on separate partitions gives you, the administrator, an ex- pansive choice of ﬁ lesystems you use for particular purposes. For instance,  you  might  choose  to  put   tmp  on  ReiserFS  for  its  superior  handling  of  many ﬁ les in a directory and excellent performance on small ﬁ les, but you  might keep  home and  var on ext3 for its rock-solid robustness or on the  default ext4 ﬁ lesystem as a good compromise between the two.  In addition, a dedicated  home partition lets you use special options when  mounting  it  to  your  system,  such  as  imposing  disk  space  quotas  or  en- abling extended security on user data. The reason to keep  tmp and  var  separate from the rest of your system is much more prosaic: these directo- ries are prone to ﬁ lling up. This is the case with  tmp because it’s a scratch- pad, and administrators often give users very liberal quotas there  but have  a policy, for example, of purging all user data in  tmp older than two days ,  which means  tmp can easily get clogged up.  var, in contrast, stores log  ﬁ les and mail spools, both of which can take up massive amounts of disk  space either as a result of malicious activity or due to a signiﬁ cant spike in  normal system usage.  Becoming a system administrator means you have to learn how to think like  one. If  tmp and  var are easy to ﬁ ll up, you compartmentalize them so that  they can’t eventually consume all the disk space available on your server.   The Story of RAID If you’ve got only one hard drive in your server, feel free to skip ahead.  Otherwise, let’s talk about putting those extra drives to use. The acronym  RAID stands for redundant array of inexpensive disks, although if you’re a  businessperson, you can substitute the word “independent” for “inexpen- sive.” We forgive you. And if you’re in France, RAID is short for “recherche  assistance intervention dissuasion,” which is an elite commando unit of  the  National  Police—but  if  that’s  the  RAID  you  need  help  with,  you’re  reading the wrong book. We think RAID is just a really awesome idea for  data: when dealing with your information, it provides extra speed, fault  tolerance, or both.  At its core, RAID is just a way to replicate the same information across  multiple physical drives. The process can be set up in a number of ways,       Installing Ubuntu Server   197  and speciﬁ c kinds of drive conﬁ gurations are referred to as RAID levels.  These days, even low- to mid-range servers ship with integrated hardware  RAID controllers, which operate without any support from the OS. If your  new server doesn’t come with a RAID controller, you can use the software  RAID functionality in the Ubuntu kernel to accomplish the same goal.   Setting up software RAID while installing your Linux system was difﬁ cult  and  unwieldy  only  a  short  while  ago,  but  it  is  a  breeze  these  days.  The  Ubuntu installer provides a nice, convenient interface for it and then han- dles all the requisite backstage magic. You can choose from three RAID  levels: 0, 1, and 5.  RAID 0  A so-called striped set, RAID 0 allows you to pool the storage  space of a number of separate drives into one large, virtual drive. The im- portant thing to keep in mind is that RAID 0 does not actually concatenate  the physical drives—instead, it spreads the data across them evenly, which  means that no more space will be used on each physical drive than can ﬁ t  on the smallest one. In practical terms, if you had two 250GB drives and a  200GB drive, the total amount of space on your virtual drive would equal  600GB; 50GB on each of the two larger drives would go unused. Spreading  data in this fashion provides amazing performance but also signiﬁ cantly  decreases reliability. If any of the drives in your RAID 0 array fails, the en- tire array will come crashing down, taking your data with it.  RAID 1  This level provides very straightforward data replication. It will  take the contents of one physical drive and multiplex it to as many other  drives as you’d like. A RAID 1 array does not grow in size with the addition  of extra drives; instead, it grows in reliability and read performance. The  size of the entire array is limited by the size of its smallest constituent drive.  RAID 5  When the chief goal of your storage is fault tolerance, and you  want to use more space than is provided by the single physical drive in  RAID 1, this is the level you want to use. RAID 5 lets you use identically  sized physical drives  if different-sized drives are present, no more space  than the size of the smallest one will be used on each drive  to construct  an array whose total available space is that of n – 1 drives, and the array  tolerates the failure of any one—but no more than one—drive without  data loss.   198   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  TIP   The Mythical Parity Drive If you toss ﬁ ve 200GB drives into a RAID 5 array, the array’s total usable size will be 800GB,  or that of four drives. This makes it easy to mistakenly believe that a RAID 5 array “sacri- ﬁ ces”  one  of  the  drives  for  maintaining  redundancy  and  parity,  but  this  is  not  the  case.  Through some neat mathematics of polynomial coefﬁ cients over Galois ﬁ elds, the actual  parity information is striped across all drives equally, allowing any single drive to fail without  compromising the data. Don’t worry, though. We won’t quiz you on the math.  Which RAID to Choose?  If you’re indecisive by nature, the past few para- graphs may have left you awkwardly hunched in your chair, mercilessly  chewing a No. 2 pencil, feet tapping the ﬂ oor nervously. Luckily, the initial  choice of RAID level is often a no-brainer, so you’ll have to direct your in- decision elsewhere. If you have one hard drive, no RAID for you. Do not  pass Go, do not collect $200. Two drives? Toss them into RAID 1, and sleep  better at night. Three or more? RAID 5. Unless you really know what you’re  doing, avoid RAID 0 like the plague. If you’re not serving mostly read-only  data without a care about redundancy, RAID 0 isn’t what you want.  TIP   Other RAID Modes Although the installer offers only the most common RAID modes—0, 1, and 5—many  other RAID modes exist and can be conﬁ gured after the installation. Take a look at http:   en.wikipedia.org wiki RAID for a detailed explanation of all the modes.  Setting Up RAID After carefully studying the last section, maybe reading a few books on ab- stract algebra and another few on ﬁ nite ﬁ eld theory, you ﬁ nally decided on  a RAID level that suits you. Since books can’t yet read your mind, we’ll as- sume you chose RAID 1. So how do you set it up?  Back to the installer. When prompted about partitioning disks, you’ll want  to bravely select the last option, Manually Edit Partition Table.   Below the top two options on the screen  Guided Partitioning and Help ,  you’ll ﬁ nd a list of the physical drives in your server that the Ubuntu in- staller detected.      TIP   Installing Ubuntu Server   199  Avoiding the “Oh, No!” Moment We’ve said this before, and we’ll say it again: It’s very easy to mistakenly erase valuable data  when partitioning your system. Because you’re installing a server, however, we’ll assume  you’re comfortable deleting any data that might already exist on the drives. If this is not the  case, back up all data you care about now! We mean it.  Indented below each drive, you’ll ﬁ nd the list of any preexisting partitions,  along with their on-disk ordinal number, size, bootable status, ﬁ lesystem  type, and, possibly, their mount point. Using the arrow keys, highlight the  line summarizing a physical drive  not any of its partitions , and press En- ter. You’ll be asked to conﬁ rm replacing any existing partition table with a  new one. Select Yes, and the only entry listed below that drive will be free  space. In our ﬁ ctional server, we have two 80GB drives—hda and hdb—so  we’d follow this process for both drives, giving each a fresh partition table.  Say we’ve decided on a 20GB  home partition. Arrow over to free space,  press Enter, and create the partition. Once you’ve entered the size for the  new  partition,  you’ll  be  brought  to  a  dialog  where  you  can  choose  the  ﬁ lesystem and mount options. Instead of plopping a ﬁ lesystem on the raw  partition, however, you’ll want to enter the Use As dialog and set the new  partition to be a physical volume for RAID.  Still with us? Now rinse and repeat for the other drive: create the exact  same partition, of the same size, and set it as a RAID volume. When you’re  done, you should be back at the initial partitioning screen, and you should  have an identically sized partition under each drive. At this point, choose  Conﬁ gure  Software  RAID  at  the  top  of  the  screen,  agree  to  write  out  changes to the storage devices if need be, and then choose to create an MD   multidisk   device.  After  selecting  RAID  1,  you’ll  be  asked  to  enter  the  number of active devices for the array. In our ﬁ ctional two-drive server, it’s  two. The next question concerns the number of spare devices in the array,  which you can leave at zero. Now simply use the spacebar to put a check  next to both partitions that you’ve created  hda1 and hdb1 , and click Fin- ish in the Multidisk dialog to return to the basic partitioner.  If you look below the two physical drives that you used to have there, you’ll  notice a brand-new drive, the Software RAID device that has one partition  below it. That’s your future  home partition, sitting happily on a RAID    200   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  array. If you arrow over to it and press Enter, you can now conﬁ gure it just  as you would a real partition.  The  process  is  the  same  for  any  other  partitions  you  want  to  toss  into  RAID. Create identical-sized partitions on all participating physical drives,  select to use them as RAID space, enter the multidisk conﬁ gurator  soft- ware RAID , and ﬁ nally, create an array that uses the real partitions. Then  create a ﬁ lesystem on the newly created array.  TIP   Array Failure and Spare Devices When a physical drive fails in a RAID array that’s running in a level that provides redun- dancy—such as 1 or 5—the array goes into so-called degraded mode  never verbally abuse  or be cruel to your RAID arrays! . Depending on the number of devices in the array, running  in degraded mode might just have performance downsides, but it might also mean that an- other physical drive failure will bring down the whole array and cause total data loss. To re- cover the array from degraded mode, you need to add a working physical drive to the system   the old one can be removed  and instruct the array to use the new device to “rebuild.”  To minimize the amount of time an array spends in degraded mode, and to prevent having to  power off the machine to insert new physical drives if the server doesn’t support hot-swap- ping, you can put extra physical drives into the machine and ﬂ ag them as hot spares, which  means the system will keep them active but unused until there’s a drive failure. Cold spares,  as the name implies, are just extra drives that you keep around on a shelf until there’s a fail- ure, at which point you manually add them to the array.  That’s it! The Ubuntu installer will take care of all the pesky details of con- ﬁ guring the system to boot the RAID arrays at the right time and use them,  even if you’ve chosen to keep your root partition on an array. Now let’s  look at another great feature of the Ubuntu installer: logical volume man- agement  LVM .  The Story of the Logical Volume Manager Let’s take a step back from our RAID adventure and look at the bigger pic- ture  in  data  storage.  The  entire  situation  is  unpleasant.  Hard  drives  are  slow and fail often, and though abolished for working memory ages ago,  ﬁ xed-size partitions are still the predominant mode of storage space allo- cation. As if worrying about speed and data loss weren’t enough, you also  have  to  worry  about  whether  your  partition  size  calculations  were  just  right when you were installing a server or whether you’ll wind up in the       Installing Ubuntu Server   201  unenviable position of having a partition run out of space, even though  another partition is maybe mostly unused. And if you might have to move  a partition across physical volume boundaries on a running system, well,  woe is you.  RAID helps to some degree. It’ll do wonders for your worries about per- formance and fault tolerance, but it operates at too low a level to help with  the partition size or ﬂ uidity concerns. What we’d really want is a way to  push the partition concept up one level of abstraction, so it doesn’t oper- ate directly on the underlying physical media. Then we could have parti- tions that are trivially resizable or that can span multiple drives, we could  easily take some space from one partition and tack it on another, and we  could juggle partitions around on physical drives on a live server. Sounds  cool, right?  Very cool, and very doable via LVM, a system that shifts the fundamental  unit of storage from physical drives to virtual or logical ones  although we  harbor our suspicions that the term logical is a jab at the storage status  quo, which is anything but . LVM has traditionally been a feature of ex- pensive, enterprise UNIX operating systems or was available for purchase  from third-party vendors. Through the magic of free software, a guy by the  name of Heinz Mauelshagen wrote an implementation of a logical volume  manager  for  Linux  in  1998.  LVM  has  undergone  tremendous  improve- ments since then and is widely used in production today, and just as you  expect, the Ubuntu installer makes it easy for you to conﬁ gure it on your  server during installation.  LVM Theory and Jargon  Wrapping your head around LVM is a bit more  difﬁ cult than with RAID because LVM rethinks the whole way of dealing  with storage, which expectedly introduces a bit of jargon that you need to  learn. Under LVM, physical volumes  PVs  are seen just as providers of  disk space without any inherent organization  such as partitions mapping  to a mount point in the OS . We group PVs into volume groups  VGs ,  which are virtual storage pools that look like good old cookie-cutter hard  drives. We carve those up into logical volumes  LVs  that act like the nor- mal partitions we’re used to dealing with. We create ﬁ lesystems on these  LVs and mount them into our directory tree. And behind the scenes, LVM    202   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  splits up physical volumes into small slabs of bytes  4MB by default , each  of which is called a physical extent  PE .   Okay, so that was a mouthful of acronyms, but as long as you understand  the progression, you’re in good shape. You take a physical hard drive and  set up one or more partitions on it that will be used for LVM. These parti- tions are now physical volumes, which are split into physical extents and  then grouped in volume groups, on top of which you ﬁ nally create logical  volumes.  It’s  the  LVs—these  virtual  partitions,  and  not  the  ones  on  the  physical hard drive—that carry a ﬁ lesystem and are mapped and mounted  into the OS. And if you’re really confused about what possible beneﬁ t we  get  from  adding  all  this  complexity  only  to  wind  up  with  the  same  ﬁ xed-size partitions in the end, hang in there. It’ll make sense in a second.  The reason LVM splits physical volumes into small, equally sized physical  extents is that the deﬁ nition of a volume group  the space that’ll be carved  into  logical  volumes   then  becomes  “a  collection  of  physical  extents”  rather than “a physical area on a physical drive,” as with old-school parti- tions. Notice that “a collection of extents” says nothing about where the  extents are coming from and certainly doesn’t impose a ﬁ xed limit on the  size of a volume group. We can take PEs from a bunch of different drives  and toss them into one volume group, which addresses our desire to ab- stract partitions away from physical drives. We can take a VG and make it  bigger simply by adding a few extents to it, maybe by taking them from  another VG, or maybe by tossing in a new physical volume and using ex- tents from there. And we can take a VG and move it to different physical  storage simply by telling it to relocate to a different collection of extents.  Best of all, we can do all this on the ﬂ y, without any server downtime.   Do you smell that? That’s the fresh smell of the storage revolution.  Setting Up LVM By now, you must be convinced that LVM is the best thing since sliced  bread. Which it is—and, surprisingly enough, setting it up during in- stallation is no harder than setting up RAID. Create partitions on each  physical drive you want to use for LVM just as you did with RAID, but       Installing Ubuntu Server   203  tell the installer to use them as physical space for LVM. Note that in this  context, PVs are not actual physical hard drives; they are the partitions  you’re creating.   You don’t have to devote your entire drive to partitions for LVM. If you’d  like, you’re free to create actual ﬁ lesystem-containing partitions alongside  the storage partitions used for LVM, but make sure you’re satisﬁ ed with  your  partitioning  choice  before  you  proceed.  Once  you  enter  the  LVM  conﬁ gurator in the installer, the partition layout on all drives that contain  LVM partitions will be frozen.  Let’s look back to our ﬁ ctional server, but let’s give it four drives, which are  10GB, 20GB, 80GB, and 120GB in size. Say we want to create an LVM par- tition, or PV, using all available space on each drive, and then combine the  ﬁ rst two PVs into a 30GB volume group and the latter two into a 200GB  one. Each VG will act as a large virtual hard drive on top of which we can  create logical volumes just as we would normal partitions.  As with RAID, arrowing over to the name of each drive and pressing Enter  will let us erase the partition table. Then pressing Enter on the free space  entry lets us create a physical volume—a partition that we set to be used as  a physical space for LVM. Once all three LVM partitions are in place, we  select Conﬁ gure the Logical Volume Manager on the partitioning menu.   After a warning about the partition layout, we get to a rather spartan LVM  dialog that lets us modify VGs and LVs. According to our plan, we choose  the former option and create the two VGs we want, choosing the appropri- ate PVs. We then select Modify Logical Volumes and create the LVs corre- sponding to the normal partitions we want to put on the system—say, one  for each of  ,  var,  home, and  tmp.  You can already see some of the partition ﬂ uidity that LVM brings. If you  decide you want a 25GB logical volume for  var, you can carve it out of the  ﬁ rst VG  you  created,  and   var  will  magically  span  the  two  smaller  hard  drives. If you later decide you’ve given  var too much space, you can shrink  the ﬁ lesystem and then simply move over some of the storage space from  the ﬁ rst VG to the second. The possibilities are endless.   204   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  Last but not least, recent Ubuntu versions support encrypting your LVM  volumes right from the installer, which is music to paranoid ears: It means  you can now have full-disk encryption from the moment you install your  machine. Encrypted LVM is offered as one of the “guided” options in the  partitioning menu, but you can also accomplish the same result by hand.  TIP   LVM Doesn’t Provide Redundancy The point of LVM is storage ﬂ uidity, not fault tolerance. In our example, the logical volume  containing the  var ﬁ lesystem is sitting on a volume group that spans two hard drives. Un- fortunately, this means that failure of either drive will corrupt the entire ﬁ lesystem, and LVM  intentionally doesn’t contain functionality to prevent this problem.  Instead, when you need fault tolerance, build your volume groups from physical volumes  that are sitting on RAID! In our example, we could have made a partition spanning the entire  size of the 10GB hard drive and allocated it to physical space for a RAID volume. Then, we  could have made two 10GB partitions on the 20GB hard drive and made the ﬁ rst one also a  physical space for RAID. Entering the RAID conﬁ gurator, we would create a RAID 1 array  from the 10GB RAID partitions on both drives, but instead of placing a regular ﬁ lesystem on  the RAID array as before, we’d actually designate the RAID array to be used as a physical  space for LVM. When we get to LVM conﬁ guration, the RAID array would show up as any  other physical volume, but we’d know that the physical volume is redundant. If a physical  drive fails beneath it, LVM won’t ever know, and no data loss will occur. Of course, standard  RAID array caveats apply, so if enough drives fail and shut down the array, LVM will still  come down kicking and screaming.  Encrypted Home and Software Selection After you have partitioned the disk, the installer will install the base system  and ask you for user information, much like with the desktop install. You’ll  then be asked a question you might not have seen before: do you wish to  encrypt your home directory?  If you answer in the afﬁ rmative, your account password will take on a sec- ond purpose. Rather than just allowing you to log in, it will also be used to  transparently  encrypt  every  ﬁ le  in  your  home  directory,  turning  it  into  gibberish for anyone without the password. This means that if your com- puter gets stolen, your data remains safe from prying eyes as long as your  password isn’t too easy to guess. If this sounds familiar, it’s because the  same functionality exists as FileVault on Apple’s Mac OS X and is also a  subset of the BitLocker system that debuted in Windows Vista.  The direc- tory encryption system used in Ubuntu is called ecryptfs, which is a decid- edly less punchy name. We’re working on it.       TIP   Installing Ubuntu Server   205  Encrypted Swap and Remote Login If you use a swap partition, protecting your home directory isn’t enough; sensitive data can get  swapped out to disk in the clear. The solution is to use encrypted swap, which you can manu- ally enable with the ecryptfs-setup-swap command, but this will presently take away your  computer’s ability to enter the hibernate power-saving mode. Suspend mode is unaffected.   Note also that encrypting your home directory makes all the data in it, including special di- rectories such as .ssh, unavailable until after you log in. If you’re logging into a machine  where your home directory is encrypted and hasn’t yet been unlocked, and the machine al- lows only SSH public key authentication, there is no way for the system to consult your   authorized_keys ﬁ le, and you’re locked out. You can ﬁ x this by physically logging in, un- mounting your encrypted home directory with ecryptfs-umount-private, then creat- ing a .ssh directory in your “underlying” home directory left behind by ecryptfs. Stick your  public keys into an authorized_keys ﬁ le under that .ssh directory as normal, and you’ll be all  set to log in remotely, at which point you can use ecryptfs-mount-private to enter  your password and unlock your actual home directory.   After the installer downloads some updated software sources, though, you  will see a new menu that lists a number of common server types, including  DNS, LAMP, Mail, OpenSSH, PostgreSQL, Print, and Samba servers. Se- lect  one  or  more  of  these  options  and  the  installer  will  automatically  download the standard set of packages you will need for that server as well  as perform some basic conﬁ guration of the services for you. For instance,  if  you  wanted  to  install  a  LAMP  environment,  but  you  also  wanted  to  make sure you could ssh into the machine from another computer, you  could select both LAMP and OpenSSH server from the menu.  TIP   Software Installer Prompts Depending on which servers you select, you may be asked a number of questions as the  packages install. For instance, when you select the LAMP environment, the installer will  recommend you choose a password for the root MySQL user.  You’re Done: Now Watch Out for Root! Whew. With the storage and software stuff out of the way, the rest of your  server installation should go no differently than installing a regular Ubuntu  workstation. And now that your server is installed, we can move on to the  fun stuff. From this point on, everything we do will happen in a shell.   When your Ubuntu server ﬁ rst boots, you’ll have to log in with the user  you  created  during  installation.  Here’s  an  important  point  that  bites  a    206   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  number of newcomers to Ubuntu: unlike most distributions, Ubuntu does  not enable the root account during installation! Instead, the installer adds  the user you’ve created during installation to the sudo group, which lets  you use a mechanism called  sudo to perform administrative tasks. We’ll  show you how to use sudo in a bit. In the meantime, if you’re interested in  the rationale for the decision to disable direct use of the root account, sim- ply run man sudo_root after logging in.  TIP   Care and Feeding of RAID and LVM Arrays If you’ve set up some of these arrays during installation, you’ll want to learn how to manage  them after the server is installed. We recommend the respective how-to documents from  The  Linux  Documentation  Project  at  www.tldp.org HOWTO Software-RAID-HOWTO.html  and www.tldp.org HOWTO LVM-HOWTO.  The how-tos sometimes get technical, but most of the details should sound familiar if you’ve  understood the introduction to the subject matter that we gave in this chapter.  Ubuntu Package Management Once your server is installed, it contains only the few packages it requires  to boot and run properly plus whatever software you selected at the soft- ware select screen. In the comfort of the GNOME graphical environment  on an Ubuntu desktop, we could launch Synaptic and point and click our  way  through  application  discovery  and  installation.  But  on  a  server,  we  must be shell samurai.  The Ubuntu Archive Before we delve into the nitty-gritty of package management, let’s brieﬂ y  outline  the  structure  of  the  master  Ubuntu  package  archive,  which  we  mentioned in the introduction to this chapter. Each new release has ﬁ ve  repositories in the archive, called main, restricted, backports, universe, and  multiverse. A newly installed system comes with only the ﬁ rst two enabled  plus the security update repository. Here’s the repository breakdown.    Main: This includes all packages installed by default; these packages     have ofﬁ cial support.  hardware drivers.    Restricted: These are packages with restricted copyright, often         Ubuntu Package Management   207    Backports: These are newer versions of packages in the archive,     provided by the community.    Universe: The universe includes packages maintained by the Ubuntu     community.  sense of freedom .    Multiverse: The multiverse includes packages that are not free  in the     The term ofﬁ cial support is a bit of a misnomer, as it doesn’t refer to techni- cal support that one would purchase or obtain but speaks instead to the  availability of security updates after a version of Ubuntu is released. Stan- dard Ubuntu releases are supported for nine months, which means that  Ubuntu’s parent company, Canonical, Ltd., guarantees that security up- dates will be provided, free of charge, for any vulnerabilities discovered in  software in the main repository for nine months after a release. No such  guarantee is made for software in the other repositories.  Of particular note is that certain Ubuntu releases have longer support cy- cles. These releases are denoted by the acronym LTS  Long-Term Support   in their version number. The latest Ubuntu LTS, version 16.04, will be sup- ported for ﬁ ve years.  APT Sources and Repositories You’re now aware of the structure of the Ubuntu archive, but we didn’t  explain how to actually modify the list of repositories you want to use on  your system. In Debian package management parlance, the list of reposi- tories is part of the list of Advanced Package Tool  APT  sources.  Keep  your  eyes  peeled:  many  of  the  package  tools  we’ll  discuss  below  begin  with the preﬁ x apt.  These sources tell APT where to ﬁ nd available pack- ages: in the Ubuntu archive on the Internet, on your CD-ROM, or in a  third-party archive.  The APT sources are speciﬁ ed in the ﬁ le  etc apt sources.list. Let’s open  this ﬁ le in an editor.  If you’re not used to vim, substitute nano for it, which  is an easier-to-use, beginner-friendly editor.   $ vim  etc apt sources.list   208   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  The  lines  beginning  with  a  hash,  or  ,  denote  comment  lines  and  are  skipped over by APT. At the top, you’ll see the CD-ROM source that the in- staller added, and following it these two lines  or something very similar :  deb http:  us.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu  xenial main restricted deb-src http:  us.archive.ubuntu.com ubuntu  xenial main restricted  We can infer the general format of the APT sources list by looking at these  lines. The ﬁ le is composed of individual sources, one per line, and each  line of several space-separated ﬁ elds. The ﬁ rst ﬁ eld tells us what kind of a  source the line is describing, such as a source for binary packages  deb  or  source code packages  deb-src . The second ﬁ eld is the actual URI of the  package source, the third names the distribution whose packages we want   xenial , and the remaining ﬁ elds tell APT which components to use from  the source we’re describing—by default, main and restricted.   If you look through the rest of the ﬁ le, you’ll ﬁ nd it’s nicely commented to  let you easily enable two extra repositories: the very useful universe and  the bleeding-edge backports. In general, now that you understand the for- mat of each source line, you have complete control over the repositories  you use, and while we strongly recommend against using the backports  repository on a server, enabling universe is usually a good idea.  There is also a directory called  etc apt sources.list.d  where more sources  can be found. This is typically where you will ﬁ nd the lists for third-party  software  e.g., Google Chrome  or for PPAs that you install.  With  that  in  mind,  let’s  get  you  acquainted  with  some  of  the  basic  command-line package management tools on an Ubuntu system. Ubuntu  inherits its package management from Debian, so if you’re familiar with  Debian, the utilities we’ll discuss are old friends.   dpkg Our ﬁ rst stop is the Debian package manager, dpkg, which sits around the  lowest levels of the package management stack. Through a utility called  dpkg-deb,  dpkg deals with individual Debian package ﬁ les, referred to as  debs for their .deb ﬁ lename extension.      Ubuntu Package Management   209  dpkg is extensively documented in the system manual pages, so you can  read about the various options it supports by entering man dpkg in the shell.  We’ll point out the most common dpkg operations: listing and installing  packages. Of course, dpkg can also remove packages, but we’ll show you  how to do that with the higher-level tool called apt-get instead.  Listing  Packages  Running  dpkg  -l    less  in  the  shell  will  list  all  the  packages on your system that dpkg is tracking, in a six-column format. The  ﬁ rst three columns are one letter wide each, signifying the desired package  state,  current  package  status,  and  error  status,  respectively.  Most  of  the  time, the error status column will be empty.  The top three lines of dpkg output serve as a legend to explain the letters  you can ﬁ nd in the ﬁ rst three columns. This lets you use the grep tool to  search through the package list, perhaps to look only at removed packages  or those that failed conﬁ guration.  Installing a Package Manually There are more than 17,000 packages in the Ubuntu archive for each re- lease. Only a small percentage of those are ofﬁ cially supported, but all the  other  packages  are  still  held  to  reasonably  rigorous  inclusion  require- ments. Packages in the Ubuntu archive are thus almost universally of high  quality and are known to work well on your Ubuntu system.  Because of this, the archive should be the very ﬁ rst place you look when  you choose to install new software. In rare instances, however, the software  you want to install won’t be available in the archive because it’s new or be- cause redistribution restrictions prevent it from being included. In those  cases, you might have to either build the software from source code, run  binaries that the vendor provides, or ﬁ nd third-party Ubuntu or Debian  packages to install.  TIP   Practice Safe Hex! That’s a terrible pun. We apologize. But it probably got your attention, so follow closely: be  very, very cautious when dealing with third-party packages. Packages in the Ubuntu archive  undergo  extensive  quality  assurance  and  are  practically  certain  to  be  free  from  viruses,  worms, Trojan horses, or other computer pests. If you install software only from the archive,  you’ll never have to worry about viruses again.   210   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  With third-party packages, you just don’t know what you could be installing. If you install a  malicious package, you’ve given the package creator full control of your system. So ideally,  don’t install third-party packages at all. And if you must, make absolutely sure you trust the  source of the packages!  Impatience is a hallmark virtue of programmers and system administrators  alike, so if you were too impatient to read the warning note, do it now. This  is serious business. Let’s continue. Say you’ve downloaded a package called  myspecial-server.deb. You can install it simply by giving this command:  $ sudo dpkg -i myspecial-server.deb  dpkg  will  unpack  the  deb,  make  sure  its  dependencies  are  satisﬁ ed,  and  proceed to install the package. Remember what we said about the root ac- count being unusable by default? Installing a package requires administra- tor privileges, which we obtained by preﬁ xing the command we wanted to  execute with sudo and entering our user password at sudo’s prompt.   TIP   A Quick Note on Shell Examples In the dpkg example, the dollar sign is the standard UNIX shell symbol, so you don’t need to  actually type it. We’ll use it in the rest of the chapter to indicate things that need to be entered  in a shell. On your Ubuntu system, the shell prompt won’t be just a dollar sign but will look  like this:   user@server:~$  user and server will be replaced by your username and the hostname you gave the server  during installation, respectively, and the part between the colon and dollar sign will show  your working directory. A tilde is UNIX shorthand for your home directory.  apt-get and apt-cache Now  let’s  jump  higher  up  in  the  stack. Whereas  dpkg  deals  mostly  with  package ﬁ les, apt-get knows how to download packages from the Ubuntu  archive  or  fetch  them  from  your  Ubuntu  CD.  It  provides  a  convenient,  succinct interface, so it’s no surprise it’s the tool that most system adminis- trators use for package management on Ubuntu servers.   While apt-get deals with high-level package operations, it won’t tell you  which packages are actually in the archive and available for installation. It       Ubuntu Package Management   211  knows how to get this information behind the scenes from the package  cache, which you can manipulate by using a simple tool called apt-cache.  Let’s see how these two commands come together with an example. Say  we’re trying to ﬁ nd and then install software that lets us work with ex- tended ﬁ lesystem attributes.  Searching the Package Cache and Showing Package Information  We  begin by telling apt-cache to search for the phrase “extended attributes.”  $ apt-cache search “extended attributes” attr - Utilities for manipulating ﬁ lesystem extended attributes libattr1 - Extended attribute shared library libattr1-dev - Extended attribute static libraries and headers python-pyxattr - module for manipulating ﬁ lesystem extended     attributes python2.4-pyxattr - module for manipulating ﬁ lesystem extended     attributes rdiff-backup - remote incremental backup xfsdump - Administrative utilities for the XFS ﬁ lesystem xfsprogs - Utilities for managing the XFS ﬁ lesystem  The  parameter  to  apt-cache  search  can  be  either  a  package  name  or  a  phrase describing the package, as in our example. The lines following our  invocation are the output we received, composed of the package name on  the left and a one-line description on the right. It looks like the attr pack- age is what we’re after, so let’s see some details about it.  $ apt-cache show attr Package: attr Priority: optional Section: utils Installed-Size: 240 Maintainer: Ubuntu Core Developers <ubuntu-deel-discuss@lists    .ubuntu.com> Original-Maintainer: Nathan Scott   Architecture: i386 Version: 1:2.4.39-1 Depends: libattr1  >= 2.4.4-1 , libc6  >= 2.6.1-1  Conﬂ icts: xfsdump  << 2.0.0  Filename: pool main a attr attr_2.4.39-1_i386.deb Size: 31098 MD5sum: 84457d6edd44983bba3dcb50495359fd SHA1: 8ae3562e0a8e8a314c4c6997ca9aced0fb3bea46   212   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  SHA256: f566a9a57135754f0a79c2efd8fcec626cde10d2533c10c1660bf7064    a336c82 Description: Utilities for manipulating ﬁ lesystem extended     attributes    A set of tools for manipulating extended attributes on ﬁ lesystem    objects, in particular getfattr 1  and setfattr 1 .

Extracting the useful bits turns  out to be pretty simple. We can already see from the description ﬁ eld that  this is, in fact, the package we’re after. We can also see the exact version of  the packaged software, any dependencies and conﬂ icting packages it has,  and an e-mail address to which we can send bug reports. And looking at  the ﬁ lename ﬁ eld, the  pool main snippet tells us this is a package in the  main repository.   Installing a Package  So far, so good. Let’s perform the actual installation:  $ sudo apt-get install attr  apt-get will track down a source for the package, such as an Ubuntu CD or  the Ubuntu archive on the Internet, fetch the deb, verify its integrity, do the  same for any dependencies the package has, and, ﬁ nally, install the package.  Removing a Package  For didactic purposes, we’re going to keep assum- ing that you’re very indecisive and that right after you installed the attr  package, you realized it wasn’t going to work out between the two of you.  To the bit bucket with attr!  $ sudo apt-get remove attr  One conﬁ rmation later and attr is blissfully gone from your system, except  for any conﬁ guration ﬁ les it may have installed. If you want those gone,  too, you’d have to instead run the following command:  $ sudo apt-get --purge remove attr      Ubuntu Package Management   213  Performing System Updates  Installing and removing packages is a com- mon system administration task, but not as common as keeping the sys- tem up to date. This doesn’t mean upgrading to newer and newer versions  of the software  well, it does, but not in the conventional sense , because  once a given Ubuntu version is released, no new software versions enter  the repositories except for the backports repository. On a server, however,  you’re strongly discouraged from using backports because they receive a  very limited amount of quality assurance and testing and because there’s  usually no reason for a server to be chasing new software features. New  features bring new bugs, and as a system administrator, you should value  stability and reliability miles over features. Ubuntu’s brief, six-month de- velopment cycle means that you’ll be able to get all the new features in half  a year anyway. But by then they will be in the main repositories and will  have received substantial testing. Keeping a system up to date thus means  making sure it’s running the latest security patches, to prevent any vulner- abilities discovered after the release from endangering your system.  Luckily, apt-get makes this process amazingly easy. You begin by obtain- ing an updated list of packages from the Ubuntu archive:  $ sudo apt-get update  and then you simply run the upgrade:  $ sudo apt-get upgrade  After this, apt-get will tell you either that your system is up to date or what  it’s planning to upgrade, and it will handle the upgrade for you automati- cally. How’s that for cool?  Running a Distribution Upgrade When  a  new  Ubuntu  release  comes  out  and  you  want  to  upgrade  your  server to it, you’ll use a new tool, do-release-upgrade. The upgrade tool  will switch over your sources.list to the new distribution and will ﬁ gure  out which packages are needed and whether they have any known issues.  After it has done this, it will ask you to conﬁ rm the update by pressing y or  to  view  the  updated  packages  by  pressing  d.  If  you  choose  to  view  the    214   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  updates, merely type y to continue the update, as the tool will not prompt  you again.   NOTE   The  update  process  may  take  a  couple  of  hours  and  should  not  be  interrupted  during   that time.  Building Packages from Source  The Ubuntu archive, unlike Debian’s,  doesn’t permit direct binary uploads. When Ubuntu developers want to  add a piece of software to the archive, they prepare its source code in a cer- tain way and put it in a build queue. From there it’s compiled, built auto- matically, and—if those steps succeed—pushed into the archive.   Why go through all the trouble? Why not just have the developers build  the software on their machines? They could upload binaries to the archive,  bypassing the build queue, which can take hours to build software. Here’s  the catch: Ubuntu ofﬁ cially supports three hardware platforms  Intel x86,  AMD64, and ARMHF . Without the build queue, developers would have  to build separate binaries of their software for each platform, which entails  owning  a  computer  running  on  each  platform   expensive!   or  creating  complicated cross-compilation toolchains. And even then, sitting through  three software builds is an enormous waste of precious developer time.  The  build  queue  approach  solves  this  problem  because  the  automatic  build system takes a single source package and builds it for all the neces- sary platforms. And it turns out that the approach provides you, the sys- tem  administrator,  with  a  really  nifty  beneﬁ t:  It  lets  you  leverage  the  dependency-solving  power  and  ease  of  use  of  apt-get  and  apply  it  to  building packages from source!  Now  that  you’re  excited,  let’s  backtrack  a  bit.  Building  packages  from  source is primarily of interest to developers, not system administrators.  In fact, as a sysadmin, you should avoid hand-built packages whenever  possible and instead beneﬁ t from the quality assurance that packages in  the Ubuntu archive received. Sometimes, though, you might just have to  apply a custom patch to a piece of software before installing it. We’ll use  the  attr  package  example,  as  before.  What  follows  is  what  a  session  of  building  attr  from  source  and  installing  the  new  package  might  look       Ubuntu Package Management   215  like—if you want to try it, make sure you install the dpkg-dev, devscripts,  and fakeroot packages.  $ mkdir attr-build $ cd attr-build $ apt-get source attr $ sudo apt-get build-dep attr $ cd attr-2.4.39   $ dch -i $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot $ cd .. $ sudo dpkg -i *.deb  All of the commands we invoked are well documented in the system man  pages, and covering them in detail is out of the scope of this chapter. To  brieﬂ y orient you as to what we did, though, here’s a quick description.  1.  We made a scratch directory called attr-build and changed into it.  2.  apt-get source attr fetched the source of the attr package and   unpacked it into the current directory.  3.  apt-get build-dep attr installed all the packages required to build   the attr package from source.  4.  We changed into the unpacked attr-2.4.39 directory, applied a patch,  and edited the package changelog with dch to describe our changes to  the source.  5.  dpkg -buildpackage -rfakeroot built one or more installable debs   from our package.  we just built.  6.  We ascended one directory in the ﬁ lesystem and installed all the debs   This is a super-compressed cheat sheet for a topic that takes a long time to  master. We left a lot of things out, so if you need to patch packages for pro- duction use, ﬁ rst go and read the man pages for the tools we mentioned  and  get  a  better  understanding  of  what’s  going  on!  Two  good  places  to  start are Ubuntu’s packaging guide at http:  packaging.ubuntu.com html   and  Debian’s  packaging  guide  at  https:  debian-handbook.info browse  stable debian-packaging.html.   216   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  aptitude Around the highest levels of the package management stack hangs apti- tude, a neat, colorful textual front end that can be used interchangeably  with apt-get. We won’t go into detail about aptitude use here; plenty of  information is available from the system manual pages and the online ap- titude help system  if you launch it as aptitude from the shell . It’s worth  mentioning, though, that one of the chief reasons some system adminis- trators prefer aptitude over apt-get is its better handling of so-called or- phan  packages.  Orphan  packages  are  packages  that  were  installed  as  a  dependency of another package that has since been removed, leaving the  orphan installed for no good reason. apt-get provides no automatic way  to  deal  with  orphans,  instead  relegating  the  task  to  the  deborphan  tool,  which you can install from the archive. By contrast, aptitude will remove  orphan packages automatically.  Tips and Tricks Congratulations. If you’ve gotten this far, you’re familiar with most aspects  of  effectively  dealing  with  packages  on  your  Ubuntu  server.  Before  you  move on to other topics, though, we want to present a few odds and ends  that will probably come in handy to you at one point or another.  Listing  Files  Owned  by  a  Package  Sometimes  it’s  really  useful  to  see  which ﬁ les on your system belong to a speciﬁ c package—say, cron. dpkg to  the rescue:  $ dpkg -L cron  Be careful, though, as dpkg -L output might contain directories that aren’t  exclusively owned by this package but are shared with others.  Finding Which Package Owns a File  The reverse of the previous opera- tion is just as simple:  $ dpkg -S  etc crontab cron:  etc crontab  The one-line output tells us the name of the owner package on the left.      Ubuntu Server Security   217  Finding Which Package Provides a File  Both dpkg -S and dpkg -L oper- ate on the database of installed packages. Sometimes, you might need to  ﬁ gure  out  which—potentially  uninstalled—package  provides  a  certain  ﬁ le. We might be looking for a package that would install the bzr binary, or   usr bin bzr. To do this, ﬁ rst install the package apt-ﬁ le  requires the uni- verse repository , then execute:  $ apt-ﬁ le update $ apt-ﬁ le search  usr bin bzr  Voila! apt-ﬁ le will tell you that the package you want is bzr, with output in  the same format as dpkg -S.   That’s it for our package management tricks—now it’s time to talk about  security.  Ubuntu Server Security As a system administrator, one of your chief tasks is dealing with server  security. If your server is connected to the Internet, for security purposes  it’s in a war zone. If it’s only an internal server, you still need to deal with   accidentally  malicious users, disgruntled employees, and the guy in ac- counting who really wants to read the boss’s secretary’s e-mail.  In general, Ubuntu Server is a very secure platform. The Ubuntu Security  Team—the  team  that  produces  all  ofﬁ cial  security  updates—has  one  of  the best turnaround times in the industry. Ubuntu ships with a “no open  ports” policy, meaning that after you install Ubuntu on your machine—be  it an Ubuntu desktop or a server installation—no applications will be ac- cepting connections from the Internet by default. Like Ubuntu desktops,  Ubuntu  Server  uses  the  sudo  mechanism  for  system  administration,  es- chewing the root account. And ﬁ nally, security updates are guaranteed for  at least ﬁ ve years for the recommended LTS releases and are free.  In  this  section,  we  want  to  take  a  look  at  user  account  administration,  ﬁ lesystem security, system resource limits, logs, and ﬁ nally some network  security. But Linux security is a difﬁ cult and expansive topic; remember  that we’re giving you a crash course here and leaving out a lot of things. To  be a good administrator, you’ll want to learn more.   218   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  User Account Administration Many  aspects  of  user  administration  on  Linux  systems  are  consistent  across distributions. Debian provides some convenience tools, such as the  useradd command, to make things easier for you. But since Ubuntu fully  inherits Debian’s user administration model, we won’t go into detail about  it here. Instead, let us refer you to www.oreilly.com catalog debian chap- ter book ch07_01.html for the basics. After reading that page, you’ll have  full knowledge of the standard model, and we can brieﬂ y talk about the  Ubuntu difference: sudo.  As we mentioned at the end of the installation section  “You’re Done: Now  Watch Out for Root!” , Ubuntu doesn’t enable the root, or administrator,  account by default. There is a great deal of security beneﬁ t to this approach  and  incredibly  few  downsides,  all  of  which  are  documented  at  the  man  pages for sudo_root.   The user that you added during installation is the one who, by default, is  placed into the sudo group and may use sudo to perform system adminis- tration tasks. After adding new users to the system, you may add them to  the sudo group like this:  $ sudo adduser username sudo  Simply use deluser in place of adduser in this command to remove a user  from the group.  Adding the --encrypt-home option to adduser will auto- matically set up home directory encryption for the new user.   One thing to keep in mind is that sudo isn’t just a workaround for giving  people root access. sudo can also handle ﬁ ne-grained permissions, such as  saying, “Allow this user to execute only these three commands with super- user privileges.”  Documentation about specifying these permissions is available in the su- doers man page, which can be a bit daunting—feel free to skip close to the  end of it, until you reach the EXAMPLES section. It should take you maybe  10 or 15 minutes to learn it, and the examples cover the vast majority of       Ubuntu Server Security   219  the situations in which you’ll want  sudo. When you’re ready to put your  new knowledge to use, simply run this command:  $ visudo  Be careful here—the sudoers database, which lives in  etc sudoers, is not  meant to just be opened in an editor because an editor won’t check the  syntax for you! If you mess up the sudoer’s database, you might ﬁ nd your- self with no way to become an administrator on the machine.   Filesystem Security The security model for ﬁ les is standardized across most UNIX-like operat- ing systems and is called the POSIX model. The model calls for three broad  types of access permissions for every ﬁ le and directory: owner, group, and  other. It works in exactly the same way on any Linux distribution, which is  why we won’t focus on it here. For a refresher, consult the man pages for  chmod and chown, or browse around the Internet.   We instead want to look at securing partitions through mount options, an  oft-neglected aspect of dealing with system security that’s rather powerful  when used appropriately. When explaining how to partition your system,  we extolled the virtues of giving, at the very least, the  home,  tmp, and   var directories their own partitions, mentioning how it’s possible to use  special options when mounting these to the ﬁ lesystem.  Many of the special mount options are ﬁ lesystem-dependent, but the ones  we want to consider are not. Here are the ones that interest us.  nodev  A ﬁ lesystem mounted with the nodev option will not allow the use  or creation of special “device” ﬁ les. There’s usually no good reason to allow  most ﬁ lesystems to allow interpretation of block or character special de- vices, and allowing them poses potential security risks.  nosuid  If you read up about UNIX ﬁ le permissions, you know that cer- tain ﬁ les can be ﬂ agged in a way that lets anyone execute them with the    220   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  permissions of another user or group, often that of the system administra- tor. This ﬂ ag is called the setuid  suid  bit or the setgid bit, respectively,  and allowing this behavior outside of the directories that hold the system  binaries is often unnecessary and decreases security. If a user is able to, in  any way, create or obtain a setuid binary of his or her own choosing, the  user has effectively compromised the system.  noexec  any executables located on it.   If a ﬁ lesystem is ﬂ agged as noexec, users will not be able to run   noatime  This ﬂ ag tells the ﬁ lesystem not to keep a record of when ﬁ les  were last accessed. If used indiscriminately, it lessens security by limiting  the amount of information available in the event of a security incident,  particularly  when  computer  forensics  is  to  be  performed.  However,  the  ﬂ ag does provide performance beneﬁ ts for certain use patterns, so it’s a  good candidate to be used on partitions where security is an acceptable  tradeoff for speed.  Deciding which mount options to use on which partition is another fuzzy  science, and you’ll often develop preferences as you become more accus- tomed to administering machines. Here’s a basic proposal, though, that  should be a good starting point:            home: nosuid, nodev   tmp: noatime, noexec, nodev, nosuid   var: noexec, nodev, nosuid  System Resource Limits By default, Linux will not impose any resource limits on user processes.  This means any user is free to ﬁ ll up all of the working memory on the ma- chine, or spawn processes in an endless loop, rendering the system unus- able in seconds. The solution is to set up some of your own resource limits  by editing the  etc security limits.conf ﬁ le:  $ sudoedit  etc security limits.conf            Ubuntu Server Security   221  The possible settings are all explained in the comment within the ﬁ le, and  there are no silver bullet values to recommend, though we do recommend  that you set up at least the nproc limit and possibly also the as data memlock  rss settings.  TIP   A Real-Life Resource Limit Example Just to give you an idea of what these limits look like on production servers, here is the  conﬁ guration from the general login server of the Harvard Computer Society at Harvard  University:  *  *  *  *  *   -  -  -  -  hard   as  data  memlock  rss  nproc   2097152 131072 131072 1013352 128  This limits regular users to 128 processes, with a maximum address space of 2GB, maxi- mum data size and locked-in-memory address space of 128MB, and maximum resident set  size of 1GB.  If you need to set up disk quotas for your users, install the quota package,  and take a look at its man page.  System Log Files As  a  system  administrator,  the  system  log  ﬁ les  are  some  of  your  best  friends. If you watch them carefully, you’ll often know in advance when  something  is  wrong  with  the  system,  and  you’ll  be  able  to  resolve  most  problems before they escalate.  Unfortunately, your ability to pay close attention to the log ﬁ les dwindles  with every server you’re tasked with administering, so administrators often  use log-processing software that can be conﬁ gured to alert them on certain  events, or they write their own tools in languages such as Perl and Python.  Logs usually live in  var log, and after your server runs for a while, you’ll  notice there are a lot of increasingly older versions of the log ﬁ les in that  directory, many of them compressed with gzip  ending with the .gz ﬁ le- name extension .   222   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  Here are some log ﬁ les of note:   var log syslog: general system log   var log auth.log: system authentication logs   var log mail.log: system mail logs   var log messages: general log messages                  var log dmesg: kernel ring buffer messages, usually since system  bootup  Your Log Toolbox  When it comes to reviewing logs, you should become  familiar with a few tools of choice. The tail utility prints, by default, the  last 10 lines of a ﬁ le, which makes it a neat tool to get an idea of what’s  been happening last in a given log ﬁ le:  $ tail  var log syslog  With the -f parameter, tail launches into follow mode, which means it will  open the ﬁ le and keep showing you changes on the screen as they’re hap- pening. If you want to impress your friends with your new system admin- istrator prowess, you can now easily recreate the Hollywood hacker movie  staple: text furiously blazing across the screen.  Also invaluable are zgrep, zcat, and zless, which operate like their ana- logues that don’t begin with a z, but on gzip-compressed ﬁ les. For instance,  to  get  a  list  of  lines  in  all  your  compressed  logs  that  contain  the  word  “warthog” regardless of case, you would issue the following command:  $ zgrep -i warthog  var log *.gz  Your toolbox for dealing with logs will grow with experience and based on  your preferences, but to get an idea of what’s already out there, do an apt- cache search for “log ﬁ les.”  A Sprinkling of Network Security Network  security  administration  is  another  feature  provided  largely  by  the OS, so it’s no different on Ubuntu than on any other modern Linux                 Ubuntu Server Security   223  distribution. That means we won’t cover it here but will leave you with  a pointer.  The iptables command is the front end to the very powerful Linux ﬁ re- wall tables. Unfortunately, dealing with  iptables can be rather difﬁ cult,  particularly if you’re trying to set up complex ﬁ rewall policies. To whet  your appetite, here’s iptables in action, dropping all packets coming from  a notorious time-sink domain:  $ sudo iptables -A INPUT -s www.slashdot.org -j DROP  Tutorials, how-tos, and articles about iptables are available on the Inter- net in large numbers, and the system man pages provide detailed informa- tion about all the possible options. Spending some time to learn iptables is well worth it because it will let you set up network security on any Linux  machine and will make it pretty easy for you to learn other operating sys- tems’ ﬁ rewall systems if need be.  If you want to just manage a basic ﬁ rewall on Ubuntu Server, you don’t  necessarily even need to venture into iptables. Ubuntu provides an excel- lent front end called ufw that makes it very easy to add new ﬁ rewall rules.  For more information on ufw, check out the man page for that tool, or if  you want a more complete reference, look at the security section of The  Ofﬁ cial Ubuntu Server Book.  Final Words on Security We’ve barely even scratched the surface of system security in this subsec- tion, though we’ve tried to give you good pointers on where to start and  where to get the information you need to learn more. But let us give you  some sage advice on security in general, since it’s a painful truth to learn:  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  fully  secure  system.  Securing  systems  isn’t  about making it impossible for a breach to occur. It’s about making the  breach so difﬁ cult that it’s not worth it to the attacker. This deﬁ nition is  pretty  ﬂ uid  because  if  your  attacker  is  a  bored  14-year-old  sitting  in  a  basement  somewhere  chewing  on  cold  pizza,  you  can  bet  that  kid  will  leave your system alone if it’s even marginally secure. But if you’re keep- ing  around  top-secret  information,  it’s  a  lot  more  difﬁ cult  to  have  the    224   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  system be secure enough that breaking into it isn’t worth it, from a cost– beneﬁ t point of view, to the attackers.  Security  is  also  neat  because,  as  a  concept,  it  permeates  the  entire  idea  space of computer science. Getting really good at security requires an in- credibly deep understanding of the inner workings of computer systems,  which  has  the  nonobvious  advantage  that  if  you’re  trying  to  get  a  deep  understanding of computer systems but don’t know where to start, you  can start with security and simply follow the trail. Use this to your advan- tage! Good luck.

Advanced Topics A single book chapter isn’t the right place to go into great detail on all the  features packed into Ubuntu Server. There isn’t enough space, and many  of the features are quite specialized. But that doesn’t stop us from taking  you on a whirlwind tour. Our goal here is to give just enough information  to let you know what’s there and interest you in ﬁ nding out more about  those features that may be relevant to how you use Ubuntu.  Virtualization If there’s been one buzzword ﬁ lling out the server space for the past couple  of years, it’s virtualization. In August 2007, a virtualization company called  VMware raised about $1 billion in its initial public offering, and the term  “virtualization” ﬁ nally went supernova, spilling from the technology realm  into the ﬁ nancial mainstream, and soon to CIOs and technology manag- ers everywhere.      Advanced Topics   225  Fundamentally, virtualization is a way to turn one computer into many.   Erudite readers will note this is precisely the opposite of the Latin motto  on the Seal of the United States, “E Pluribus Unum,” which means “out of  many, one.” Some technologies match that description, too, like Single Sys- tem Image [SSI] grids. But if we talked about virtualization in Latin, our  motto would be “Ex Uno Plura.”  Why is it useful to turn one computer  into many?  Back in the 1960s, servers were huge and extremely expensive, and no one  wanted to buy more of them than were absolutely necessary. It soon be- came clear that a single server, capable of running different operating sys- tems  at  once,  would  allow  the  same  hardware  to  be  used  by  different  people  with  different  needs,  which  meant  fewer  hardware  purchases,  which meant happier customers with less devastated budgets. IBM was the  ﬁ rst company to offer this as a selling point, introducing virtualization in  its IBM 7044 and IBM 704 models, and later in the hardware of its Model  67 mainframe. Later, the industry largely moved away from mainframes  and toward small and cheap rack servers, which meant the need to virtual- ize mostly went away: If you needed to run separate operating systems in  parallel, you just bought two servers. But eventually Moore’s law caught  up with us, and even small rack machines became so powerful that organi- zations  found  many  of  them  underutilized,  while  buying  more  servers   though a relatively cheap strategy in itself  meant sizable auxiliary costs  for  cooling  and  electricity.  This  set  the  stage  for  virtualization  to  once  again become in vogue. Maybe you want to run different Linux distribu- tions on the same machine. Maybe you need a Linux server side by side  with Windows. Virtualization delivers.  There are four key types of virtualization. From the lowest level to highest,  they  are  hardware  emulation,  full  virtualization,  paravirtualization,  and  OS virtualization. Hardware emulation means running different operat- ing systems by emulating, for each, all of a computer’s hardware in soft- ware. This approach is very powerful and painfully slow. Full virtualization  instead uses a privileged piece of software called a hypervisor as a broker  between  operating  systems  and  the  underlying  hardware,  and  it  offers  good performance but requires special processor support on instruction  sets like the ubiquitous x86. Paravirtualization also uses a hypervisor but  supports only executing operating systems that have been modiﬁ ed in a    226   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  special way, offering high performance in return. Finally, OS virtualization  is more accurately termed “containerization” or “zoning” and refers to op- erating systems that support multiple user spaces utilizing a single run- ning kernel. Containerization provides near-native performance but isn’t  really comparable to the other virtualization approaches because its focus  isn’t  running  multiple  operating  systems  in  parallel  but  carving  one  up  into isolated pieces.  The most widely used hardware emulators on Linux are QEMU and Bochs,  available in Ubuntu as the packages qemu and bochs. respectively. The big  players in full virtualization on Linux are the commercial offerings from  VMware, IBM’s z VM, and most recently, a technology called KVM that’s  become part of the Linux kernel. In paravirtualization, the key contender is  Xen; the Linux OS virtualization space is dominated by the OpenVZ and  Linux-VServer projects, though many of the needed interfaces for OS vir- tualization have gradually made their way into the Linux kernel proper.  Now that we’ve laid the groundwork, let’s point you in the right direction  depending  on  what  you’re  looking  for.  If  you’re  a  desktop  Ubuntu  user  and want a way to safely run one or more other Linux distributions  in- cluding different versions of Ubuntu!  or operating systems  BSD, Win- dows, Solaris, and so forth  for testing or development, all packaged in a  nice interface, the top recommendation is an open source project out of  Sun Microsystems called VirtualBox. It’s available in Ubuntu as the pack- age virtualbox-ose, and its home page is www.virtualbox.org.  If you want to virtualize your server, the preferred solution in Ubuntu is  KVM, a fast full virtualizer that turns the running kernel into a hypervisor.  Due to peculiarities of the x86 instruction set, however, full virtualizers  can work only with a little help from the processor, and KVM is no excep- tion. To test whether your processor has the right support, try:  $ egrep ‘ vmxsvm ’  proc cpuinfo  If that line produces any output, you’re golden. Head on over to https:   help.ubuntu.com community KVM  for  instructions  on  installing  and  conﬁ guring KVM and its guest operating systems.       TIP   Advanced Topics   227  Point-and-Click Xen One Xen-related project to point out is MIT’s open source XVM  not to be confused with Sun  Microsystems’ xVM , which is a set of tools built on top of Debian that allow users to create  and bring up Xen guests through a Web browser, complete with serial console redirection,  ssh access, and a variety of other goodies. MIT uses the system to offer point-and-click vir- tual machines to any MIT afﬁ liate; the project home page is http:  xvm.mit.edu.  Disk Replication We’ve discussed the role of RAID in protecting data integrity in the case of  disk failures, but we didn’t answer the follow-up question: what happens  when  a  whole  machine  fails?  The  answer  depends  entirely  on  your  use  case, and giving a general prescription doesn’t make sense. If you’re Goo- gle, for instance, you have automated cluster management tools that no- tice a machine going down and don’t distribute work to it until a technician  has been dispatched to ﬁ x the machine. But that’s because Google’s infra- structure makes sure that  except in pathological cases  no machine holds  data that isn’t replicated elsewhere, so the failure of any one machine is ul- timately irrelevant.  If you don’t have Google’s untold thousands of servers on a deeply redun- dant  infrastructure,  you  may  consider  a  simpler  approach:  Replicate  an  entire hard drive to another computer, propagating changes in real time,  just like RAID1 but over the network.  This functionality is called Distributed Replicated Block Device  DRBD ,  and it isn’t limited to hard drives: it can replicate any block device you like.  Ubuntu 9.04 and newer ships with DRBD, and the user space utilities you  need are in the drbd8-utils package. For the full documentation, see the  DRBD Web site at www.drbd.org.  Cloud Computing Cloud computing builds on the most interesting aspect of virtualization:  you can easily create, pause, and tear down multiple virtual computers, all  running on one real bare-metal machine. To the user, those virtual com- puters behave just like real computers.   228   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  With  cloud  computing,  computing  power  becomes  a  commodity.  You  don’t need to plan, budget for, and install new computing power months  in advance. Instead, ask the cloud for a machine and it’s there within sec- onds. When you’re done, throw it away.  It’s like the difference between digging a well and turning on a tap. If you  have running water from a tap, water remains a precious resource, but it’s  no  longer  something  you  need  to  invest  time  in  to  obtain.  If  you  have  cloud  computing,  computing  power  may  remain  limited,  but  it’s  much  easier to get hold of, share, and repurpose.  If you want cloud computing power, there are a couple of ways to get it:  build your own private cloud or buy computing power as and when you  need it from one of the big cloud providers, such as Amazon or RackSpace.  Actually, with Ubuntu you can mix and match between using your own  private cloud and buying additional resources when you need them.  Ubuntu is at the heart of the cloud computing revolution. It serves both as  the base OS running cloud compute clusters—the machines that provide  the computing power to the cloud—and as the OS that people choose to  run in the virtual machines they run in the cloud.  Because it’s so new, cloud computing is fast moving, but two dominant  approaches to running a cloud have already emerged: Amazon’s EC2 and  the open source project OpenStack. Ubuntu is at the heart of both. That’s  great news if you want to experiment, because Ubuntu gives you a range of  tools to set up and manage your own cloud.  The  two  main  tools  you’ll  come  across  are  MAAS   otherwise  known  as  Metal as a Service  and Juju. MAAS helps you set up and manage a cluster  of servers, and Juju makes it easy to get services running either directly on  bare-metal servers or in the cloud.  Using MAAS, you can treat a group of bare-metal servers like a cloud: in- stead of a bunch of individual servers, you have a computing resource to  which you can deploy different services. Using MAAS’s Web UI, you can  quickly get an overview of how your computing cluster is being used and       Advanced Topics   229  what’s available. Even with just a handful of servers, MAAS is a great way  to start treating real machines in a similar way to a cloud.  You can think of Juju as similar to apt-get but for services that run on serv- ers. Juju uses scripts, called charms, that do all the setup necessary to get a  particular service running. Let’s say you want to run a WordPress server.  All you need to do is deploy the correct Juju charm to the server and every- thing should get set up correctly.  By combining MAAS and Juju, you can relatively easily set up your own  private cloud. MAAS helps you manage the real machines, and Juju helps  you set up the services you need to run that cloud.  Let’s say you want to deploy a speciﬁ c service to the cloud using Juju. We use  Zookeeper in our example. Deploying a service normally begins like this:  $ juju bootstrap $ juju deploy zookeeper $ juju expose zookeeper  At this point, Juju creates a virtual machine instance, installs Zookeeper,  and conﬁ gures it. Use the following command to determine the status of  the instance:  $ juju status  When you get the notiﬁ cation that your instance is up and running, you  will learn its IP address and can start using it. This process is amazingly  quick and easy!  One useful tool that was brand new for version 12.04 is the Juju charm store.  When Juju started, it was much more difﬁ cult to ﬁ nd and deploy services  using charms, but with the charm store as a central repository, the process  has become much more elegant. Just as APT and related software reposito- ries have made ﬁ nding and installing software easy, so the Juju charm store is  designed to make launching and conﬁ guring servers in the cloud easy. There  is an interesting difference between how APT and Juju work.   230   Chapter 8       The Ubuntu Server  In an APT repository, the software is generally frozen—that is, it will not  receive updates for a speciﬁ c release cycle except perhaps for security up- dates or minor bug ﬁ x updates, and even then the updates are often stored  in another repository  e.g., precise-main or precise-security . With Juju,  charms can be written by anyone and can be updated within a release cycle  for the charm store. The charm store isn’t frozen the way APT repositories  are. This is important, especially for those users who  wisely  choose to  run an LTS release of Ubuntu for their servers and who otherwise might  need to wait several years before they can install a new version of desirable  software or until they upgrade their Ubuntu release version to the next  LTS or ﬁ nd a PPA with the software in it.  So, let’s say you are working on a development version of Zookeeper and  want to quickly create a cloud server instance with the development ver- sion deployed to it instead of the stable version. You could simply use the  following series of commands instead of the previous set:  $ juju bootstrap $ juju deploy zookeeper $ juju set zookeeper source=dev $ juju expose zookeeper  By adding only one line, you are deploying the development version! The  ability to easily specify the source from which to deploy is useful.  Charm authors are given the ability to write these details into their charms.  Speciﬁ cs like versions, sources, and so on are all in there. If you want to  install nodejs, there is no need to search all over for someone’s install script  in a blog post or a pastebin code snippet; in stead, you just use that person’s  Juju charm. Simple. The charm includes information like which PPA to  use and the install script necessary.  Allowing anyone to give you a charm to install software could be danger- ous, so some safety and security mechanisms are built in. This is the second  reason for the store  after convenience for end users . Charms included in  the Juju store go through a community peer review process and an auto- mated build process to test for failures. Anyone can write charms for their       Summary   231  own use or to share directly with people, but it takes a little more effort and  scrutiny before a charm is included in the store.  There is so much more to be said about Juju, MAAS, and charms that is  beyond the scope of this book.

Summary If you’ve never administered a system before, the transition from being a  regular user will be difﬁ cult, regardless of which OS you choose to learn to  administer. The difﬁ culty stems from the wider shift in thinking that’s re- quired. Instead of just making sure your room is clean, now you have to  run and protect the whole apartment building. But the difﬁ culty is also  educational and rewarding.  We realize they also told you this in your the- oretical physics class in college, but we are not lying.  Learning to maintain  Ubuntu servers is a great choice for you because you’ll beneﬁ t from a vi- brant and helpful user community, and you’ll be working with a top-notch  OS every step of the way.  If you’re a seasoned administrator who came to see what all the Ubuntu  Server fuss is about, stay tuned. The project, though rock solid as far as  stability goes, is still in its feature infancy, and the Server Team is working  very hard at making it the best server platform out there. We’re emphasiz- ing advanced features and we’re being very fussy about getting all the little  details just right.  In both cases, if you’re installing a new server, give Ubuntu Server a try. It’s  a state-of-the-art system, and we’re sure you’ll enjoy using it. Get in touch,  tell us what to do to make it better, and lend a hand.

Some,  referred  to  as  the  partner  projects, work closely with and within Ubuntu. Others prefer to work on  the edges of the Ubuntu project by developing ofﬁ cial Flavors, which share  the Ubuntu software sources but are created to highlight a speciﬁ c selec- tion of software or use case, such as the Ubuntu Studio project, which fo- cuses  on  multimedia  creation  and  editing.  Others,  like  the  Lubuntu  project, are created by a community of users with speciﬁ c desires.  Still others are created for reasons connected to the international nature of  Linux and open source software. While most Ubuntu development hap- pens in English, there are large developer and user communities in other  languages and countries. Thus, a derived distribution might spring up to  satisfy  that  need.  There  are  derived  distributions  targeted  at  Christians,  children, people with slow computers, and people who prefer to have an  Ubuntu system optimized for any of several alternative user interfaces or  for use in several different schools and government bureaucracies around  the world. Should you use any of these over Ubuntu? We can’t answer that  question for you. Some of these projects are fully within and, as a result,  not mutually exclusive from Ubuntu; others are based on Ubuntu, but dis- tinct projects. One may be more appropriate than another depending on  your preferences or circumstances. You can mix, match, and sample these  distributions until you ﬁ nd one that works well for you. As we mentioned  in Chapter 1, Ubuntu sees these derivatives as a sign of a healthy and vi- brant community. One of the goals of the project is to make it easier for  this type of distribution to appear. We can all expect to see more of them  in the future.  Recognized Flavors Recognized ﬂ avors  Figure 9-1  release on the same schedule, share a com- mon repository of packages, and work in close relation with Ubuntu. At  the time of this book’s publication, there were nine ofﬁ cially recognized  ﬂ avors—Xubuntu,  Ubuntu  Studio,  Mythbuntu,  Kubuntu,  Edubuntu,  Lubuntu, Ubuntu Kylin, Ubuntu GNOME, and Ubuntu MATE—which  are discussed in more depth later in this chapter. Canonical supplies these   234      Recognized Flavors   235  Figure 9-1  Ubuntu.com Flavors download page  recognized  ﬂ avors  with  infrastructure,  daily  ISO  build  and  publish  re- sources, coordination with the Ubuntu release, and support after the re- lease. However, there are also certain services that Canonical does not offer  for these recognized ﬂ avors: automated ISO or upgrade testing, ﬁ xing of  packages  not  in  Ubuntu  desktop  or  server  images,  security  updates  of  packages not in main, publishing on http:  releases.ubuntu.com, and mas- tering of the CD or USB images. It is now the responsibility of each of the  recognized ﬂ avor communities to take ownership of those services.  Like  Ubuntu,  each  of  these  recognized  ﬂ avors  has  vibrant  communities  that help develop it, maintain it, test it, support it, advocate on its behalf,  and more. Each has Internet Chat Relay  IRC  channels on freenode.net,  mailing lists, Launchpad teams, forums, wiki pages, and Web sites for users  to actively participate in.

First  released alongside Ubuntu 5.04, Kubuntu, which means “toward human- ity”  in  Bemba,  builds  on  the  strengths  of  the  K  Desktop  Environment   KDE  rather than on Unity as Ubuntu does. It strives to take the best of  Ubuntu and the best of the KDE to produce a great Linux distribution.   Like Ubuntu, Kubuntu makes the following commitments: Kubuntu will  provide the very best translations and accessibility infrastructure that the  free  software  community  has  to  offer;  Kubuntu  will  always  be  free  of  charge, and there is no extra cost for an “enterprise” version; and Kubuntu  will always provide the latest and best software from the KDE community.   Kubuntu  is  a  complete  desktop  but  one  built  around  KDE  and  Qt.  Kubuntu opts for a more traditional blue and makes only a few other vis- ual changes. The project is led by the Kubuntu Council  an elected group  of developers  and an army of volunteers. The current Kubuntu Council  members can be found at https:  launchpad.net ~kubuntu-council.

Edubuntu Edubuntu  Figure 9-3  is a version of Ubuntu for use in schools and other  educational environments. It uses the thin client technology of the Linux  Terminal Server Project  LTSP  as well as a number of programs aimed at  the educational market, such as GCompris and the KDE Education suite.  In 2016, instead of doing a 16.04 release, the Edubuntu project committed   Figure 9-3  Edubuntu 14.04 desktop   238   Chapter 9       Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives   only to continuing support for release 14.04 through the end of its life cy- cle in 2017.  One  of  Edubuntu’s  unique  features  is  the  inclusion  of  the  LTSP  in  an  easy-to-use, out-of-the-box installer. LTSP uses a different method of de- ploying clients over a network than is used in traditional computer deploy- ments. Instead of full-powered computers, LTSP uses thin clients—that is,  less capable, cheaper computers that connect to a larger server and have it  do all the processing work. LTSP is covered in greater detail in The Ofﬁ cial  Ubuntu Server Book, also available from Prentice Hall.  For most readers of this book, Ubuntu is an alternative operating system  for  an  extraordinarily  exciting  generation  of  users.  No  team  or  project  within Ubuntu has done more to target, support, and grow this group of  users than the Edubuntu project.  While the Ubuntu, Kubuntu, and other desktop-focused ﬂ avors highlight  the products of the GNOME, KDE, and other communities, the Edubuntu  project aims to provide the best of everything in Ubuntu—properly tai- lored for use in schools and as easy to use as possible.

While LXDE can be built on many cur- rent Linux distributions, it is the native environment of Lubuntu alone.   Lubuntu is targeted at “normal” PC and laptop users who are running on  low-spec  hardware  and  who  may  not  know  how  to  use  command-line  tools. In most cases, they just don’t have enough resources for all the bells  and whistles of the “full-featured” mainstream distributions.

In Xubuntu, Xfce and its associated applications play a  role analogous to KDE in the context of Kubuntu. Xfce is small and light- weight compared to the much fancier Unity, GNOME, and KDE. It uses  less memory and fewer CPU cycles than any of the alternatives in a normal  conﬁ guration.  While  this  means  that  Xubuntu  is  often  seen  as  having  fewer features or being less user-friendly than Ubuntu or Kubuntu, it also  means that it runs faster, is more responsive, and tends to run very quickly  on older or less powerful computers. Xubuntu is also more ﬂ exible when it  comes to full customization of the desktop, from placement of menus and  panels to inclusion of a variety of panel applets. As a result, Xubuntu has  been used frequently by computer recyclers, by the owners of old comput- ers, and by those who just want to squeeze out better performance from  their hardware using a more efﬁ cient interface.  Like Kubuntu, Xubuntu is community driven and began outside the proj- ect in the universe repository of Ubuntu. In releases 5.04 and 5.10, Xfce 4   Figure 9-5  Xubuntu 16.04 desktop      Recognized Flavors   241  was supported by a special Xfce Team in Ubuntu. Due to the great work  done on Xfce, Xubuntu was brought into the fold and became Ubuntu’s  third partner project and a part of the main Ubuntu repository, where it  has remained since release 6.10.

Ubuntu Studio Ubuntu Studio  Figure 9-6  is a ﬂ avor of Ubuntu that is designed and op- timized for multimedia production. The system includes a wide variety of  applications useful to those engaging in audio and video recording, mix- ing, editing, synthesis, and production as well as graphics production and  manipulation. It contains a modiﬁ ed kernel that allows the system to re- duce latency for audio in ways that dramatically improve performance in  professional audio recording and manipulation, but the kernel may be in- appropriate in other environments. Its ﬁ rst release was based on Ubuntu  7.04. The Studio team puts a focus on LTS releases.

A great deal of  effort has been put into developing the default applications for this proj- ect. An innovative swipe-driven interface has been developed that is spe- ciﬁ cally tailored to smaller-form touchscreen devices.  At the time of writing, this is a separate project from Ubuntu desktop.

Explored more in Chapter 10, it aims to be a very small server image that is  well suited for Internet of Thing devices and containers. Ubuntu Core re- lies on transactional updates and application isolation, which allows for  easy updates and rollbacks. To do so, it uses the new Snappy package man- agement system, which also allows for easier packaging than with the tra- ditional  Debian  packages  that  the  standard  Ubuntu  desktop  and  server  editions use.

Other Distributions   249  Other Distributions Some distributions generally work outside of the Ubuntu community and  usually have their own package repositories. They may not be released at  the same time as Ubuntu. In the past, several of these derived distributions  have been built directly upon other distributions, such as Debian, which is  also the base for Ubuntu. The changes that Ubuntu developers make in the  process of creating the distribution have been seen as positive and useful  as a foundation for others with custom needs or desires. The list of deriva- tive distributions has grown rapidly, and as distributions come and go, the  list is constantly in ﬂ ux. In the ﬁ rst edition of this book, our list was nearly  comprehensive; since then, the size of the derivative distribution commu- nity has grown so much that compiling a complete list for this ninth edi- tion is no longer possible. Instead, we provide a bit of the ﬂ avor of the  diversity of derived distributions with some examples of the oldest and  most visible derived distributions to give you an idea of the scope of the  community.  Guadalinex Guadalinex is the GNU Linux distribution developed and promoted by  the regional government of Andalusia, the most populated autonomous  community in Spain with almost 8 million inhabitants. It is currently one  of the largest free software implementations worldwide, with more than  200,000  desktops—and  increasing.  The  project  is  a  consequence  of  the  unanimous support of the Andalusian Parliament on the Information So- ciety and Innovation policies approved in 2002 and 2003, urging all the  regional institutions to promote and use free software and open licenses.  This makes the Guadalinex initiative unique in the world.  Guadalinex  was  initially  released  in  2003,  and  the  ﬁ rst  two  versions  were  based on Debian. In 2005, the Guadalinex project decided to develop the  third version deriving from Ubuntu. Guadalinex version 3 was released in  January 2006 based on Ubuntu 5.10, making it the ﬁ rst major Ubuntu de- rivative. The project is part of a government plan to implement free software  as the default option in the public schools. At the beginning of 2006, this  project involved 500 schools and approximately 200,000 desktops equipped  with Guadalinex and free software only. These numbers increase every year    250   Chapter 9       Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives   as  new  courses  start  every  September  and  new  computers  are  purchased   about 40,000 in 2006 . This initiative alone puts Guadalinex in the top po- sition as the biggest free software implementation worldwide. Additionally,  the software is used in public Internet access centers, senior centers, libraries,  and women’s associations, as well as citizens’ homes. Guadalinex is merely  one example of many Ubuntu derivatives created by or in cooperation with  governments for use in schools and bureaucracies. It is now only one among  many massive deployments of Ubuntu in these settings.  TIP   Guadalinex Guadalinex can be found at www.guadalinex.org.  Linux Mint Because Ubuntu is dedicated to using free software by default as much as  possible, it does not come with proprietary media codecs installed. That  was the reason Linux Mint was originally created. Over time, it has devel- oped  a  community  that  focuses  on  creating  an  easy-to-use-and-install   Linux desktop that is nice to look at with a focus on making things as sim- ple and enjoyable as possible, especially for newcomers. The distribution is  completely  compatible  with  and  uses  the  Ubuntu  software  repositories.  The main differences are in the look and feel as well as choices for software  installed by default. Linux Mint also produces a Debian-based version.

Launchpad As we mentioned in Chapter 1, most of Canonical’s technical employees  do not work on Ubuntu. Rather, they work on infrastructure. The major- ity of this infrastructure comprises a large collection of services that work       Launchpad   251  together to provide the framework through which Ubuntu is built. This  superstructure of related applications is collectively referred to as Launch- pad. While it has several non–Web-based systems, it is almost wholly ac- cessible over the Web.  While Launchpad  Figure 9-12  is primarily used to develop Ubuntu, the  open source  AGPLv3  infrastructure was designed to be useful for any free  software project and is becoming more popular, with several non-Ubuntu  projects now being hosted on Launchpad. It aims to provide these projects  with the code tracking, bug tracking, and translation tracking software nec- essary to more easily and more powerfully collaborate with others and to  develop free and open source software. Each of these functions  code, bug,  and translation tracking  is highly integrated, making it much more ambi- tious,  and  potentially  much  more  powerful,  than  traditional  Web-based   Figure 9-12  Ubuntu project in Launchpad   252   Chapter 9       Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives   solutions with similar goals. Early on, the Launchpad Web page described  the project as follows:  A collection of services for projects in the Open Source universe. You can  register your project, and then collaborate with the Open Source commu- nity on translations, bug tracking, and code.  That description continues to be valid even as the project has expanded  with  support  and  speciﬁ cation  modules.  In  addition  to  code,  bug,  and  translation tracking, Launchpad provides the ability to deal with code, not  just on a per-package or per-project level but on the distribution level as  well. If a bug has been reported against a piece of software in Ubuntu, it is  visible  to  both  the  upstream  and  downstream  projects.  The  project  can  track how its software evolves over time and see, at a glance, whether bugs  apply. Developers can track translations in a similar way.  The best way to understand Launchpad is to see it in action. This section  walks through the individual pieces of Launchpad in more depth. Much of  the Ubuntu infrastructure is highly integrated into Launchpad. If you have  created an account for reporting bugs or joining Ubuntu teams, you al- ready have a Launchpad account.

It  handles  all  of  the  automatic  building  of  software  in  Ubuntu on each of the architectures and the integration of successfully  built software into the archive. Soyuz means “union” in Russian and is the  name of the spacecraft that Mark Shuttleworth traveled in during his voy- age to space.  Soyuz  works  almost  entirely  behind  the  scenes.  It  was  ﬁ rst  activated  in  early February 2006, but had no initial effect on the way software was up- loaded or downloaded in Ubuntu. What Soyuz does is integrate the pro-      Launchpad   253  cess  by  which  software  is  built  and  inserted  into  different  parts  of  the  Ubuntu  archive.  The  building  of  software  cannot  be  tracked  using  the  Launchpad Web infrastructure.

Launchpad Translations Translations is a Web-based translation system integrated into Launchpad   Figure 9-13 . It was the ﬁ rst piece of Launchpad to be publicly released. It  is codenamed Rosetta after the Rosetta Stone, the famous piece of dark  gray granite with the same text in three scripts that led to the deciphering  of Egyptian hieroglyphics.  Figure 9-13  Ubuntu translations in Launchpad   254   Chapter 9       Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives   Rosetta is a Web-based version of a “PO” ﬁ le editor. In other words, it pro- vides a simple mechanism by which translators can view a list of untrans- lated phrases or strings and then translate each of them into their language.  At the moment, the system works only with translations from English. Ro- setta’s non–Web-based predecessors include Kbabel and Gtranslate, both  of  which  can  be  downloaded  and  installed  on  Ubuntu.  By  putting  this  functionality on the Web and integrating it into the archive management  scripts, Rosetta lowers the barrier of entry for translation and increases the  chance that a translation will make it into the distribution.  Rosetta includes each of the translatable strings contained in every appli- cation in Ubuntu. When new software is uploaded into Ubuntu, Rosetta  will check to see if any strings have changed or been added. Changes to a  string that has previously been translated will result in the translation be- ing marked as fuzzy until a translator can check the translation and the  new string, make any necessary changes, and then mark the translation as  no longer fuzzy. By tracking new strings, Rosetta can easily prompt trans- lators with new strings to translate as they appear as well as provide statis- tics on the percentage of strings within a particular application or within  all of Ubuntu that have been translated into a particular language.  As users translate strings, they build up positive “karma” within the sys- tem—an innovation that has now been deployed to many other parts of  Launchpad. Users can also work together in localization teams  called l10n  teams because the word localization has 10 letters between its ﬁ rst and last  letters . Rosetta provides a great way for Ubuntu users to get involved in  the distribution. Anybody who knows English and another language can  begin contributing. Because the system is integrated into Launchpad, us- ers do not need to submit their translations a second time to have them  included in Ubuntu—the project already has them. After they are submit- ted in Rosetta and approved, new translations are automatically pushed  out to users who use Ubuntu in those languages.  TIP   Translations Translations can be found at https:  translations.launchpad.net.      Launchpad   255  Launchpad Bugs Launchpad Bugs  Figure 9-14  is a Web-based bug system like the Mozilla  project Bugzilla, which might be familiar to some users. It provides a loca- tion where users can ﬁ le bugs they ﬁ nd in their Ubuntu software by using  easily accessible pieces of software such as Apport, by suing the command- line tool ubuntu-bug, or by reporting over the Web.  Launchpad Bugs’ ﬁ rst role is to provide a location where users can sub- mit bugs. Launchpad Bugs is not just a way to collect complaints, though.  Rather, its job is to track and record a bug through its full life cycle, from  report to close. Bugs can be assigned to a particular developer or reas- signed. If the bug is, in fact, the result of another application, the bug can   Figure 9-14  Ubuntu Bugs in Launchpad   256   Chapter 9       Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives   be reassigned to another package. Bugs can be rated according to sever- ity, or tagged and categorized in any number of useful manners. Infor- mation, ﬁ les, and patches that ﬁ x a bug can be uploaded into Launchpad  Bugs. When the bug has been resolved, it can be closed. The bug report  provides  a  single  venue  in  which  to  collect  information  from  the  bug  submitter, the bug ﬁ xer, the upstream maintainer if necessary, and any  other involved party.  All of this, of course, is exactly what you would expect from any usable  modern  bug  tracker.  Where  Launchpad  Bugs  aims  to  distinguish  itself  from its competitors is through its integration in Launchpad and ability to  track multiple pieces of software with a single bug report. First and fore- most, this means that users of Launchpad Bugs can track the status of a  bug as it relates to a particular patch or a particular piece of code. Because  Ubuntu supports every release for nine months and some releases, such as  Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, for much longer, it’s important that Ubuntu be able to  track which bugs show up in which releases. As derivative works of Ubuntu  are created in Launchpad, Launchpad Bugs also allows these derivatives to  use  Launchpad  Bugs  to  see  whether  bugs  submitted  against  Ubuntu  or  other distributions apply to their code and, if so, to quickly grab a ﬁ x.  As with Rosetta, Launchpad karma can be built up by ﬁ xing, reporting,  and interacting with bugs over time. Bug triage that involves closing irre- producible  bugs  and  merging  duplicate  bugs  is  one  way  that  users  can  build up their karma. Of course, simply running developer versions and  submitting new bugs is another great way to build good karma.  TIP   Bugs Bugs can be found at https:  bugs.launchpad.net ubuntu.  Launchpad Blueprint Tracker The Launchpad Blueprint Tracker  Figure 9-15 , or Blueprints, is Ubun- tu’s custom speciﬁ cation and feature-tracking system. Blueprints provides  a  way  that  users  can  create  speciﬁ cation  pages,  linked  into  the  existing  Ubuntu wiki, for features they would like to see in Ubuntu. Other inter- ested parties can use Blueprints to subscribe to speciﬁ cations or proposals       Launchpad   257  Figure 9-15  Launchpad Blueprint Tracker  they are interested in to collaborate on the development of the speciﬁ ca- tion and to track progress. Over time, users working in the wiki and in  Blueprints  help  new  ideas  through  a  process  that  starts  with  “brain  dump”—a very rough collection of ideas and brainstorming—and ends  with an implemented feature. In Ubuntu, this process involves  1  review  by  the  community  and  trusted  members  and   2   approval  by  decision  makers and the Ubuntu Technical Board or by appropriate team leaders  and councils. Blueprint provides technology to support this process and  ensure that nothing important is dropped on the ﬂ oor.  In  particular,  Blueprints  helps  leaders  and  decision  makers  on  Ubuntu  prioritize features and speciﬁ cations and ensure that work is progressing  on necessary features toward on-time completion for releases. As a result,  Blueprint is used as both the primary speciﬁ cation tracker and the major  release management tool for Ubuntu.   258   Chapter 9       Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives   While Blueprints is extremely useful for technical speciﬁ cations, it is also  used heavily for developing and tracking community-related proposals as  well as for brainstorming stages into implementation. Blueprints also has  features designed around sprints and conferences to help organize sessions  and  coordinate  groups  to  bring  forward  speciﬁ cations. As  a  ﬁ nal  bit  of  trivia, it’s interesting to note that Blueprints was written largely by Ubuntu  founder and ﬁ nancier Mark Shuttleworth himself!  TIP   Blueprints Blueprints can be found at https:  blueprints.launchpad.net.  Other Functionality In  addition  to  the  visible  ﬂ agship  products  within  Launchpad  just  dis- cussed,  Launchpad  has  several  other  important  uses.  Launchpad  inte- grates  with  Ubuntu  One  to  hold  a  username  and  other  important  information valuable to participating in the community, including a GNU  Privacy Guard encryption key, contact information, and more. More im- portant,  Launchpad  contains  representations  of  every  team  and  group  within Ubuntu and handles permission within the entire Ubuntu world.  For example, the only people who are allowed to upload core packages to  Ubuntu are people who are part of the Ubuntu Core Developers Team in  Launchpad.  Bazaar Bazaar  Figure 9-16  is a distributed revision control system. What does  that really mean? First, a revision control system is a program that tracks  how the source code of a program changes. It tracks what each speciﬁ c  change was, such as the addition of a new piece of code, as well as who  made the change. It also allows a developer to roll back to a previous ver- sion or create a branch, or a separate and parallel code version, to try a new  idea without forcing the change on the main code.  The second key piece about Bazaar is that it is distributed, much like the  popular revision control software Git. Traditional revision control systems       Bazaar   259  Figure 9-16  Bazaar Explorer  can be installed from the GNOME Software Center   have a single place where the code is stored. Only certain people can access  this place and change the code there. A distributed revision control system  is different in that there is no single place for code storage. Each branch a  developer is working on is considered equal, and they all take code from  each other. This system is much like a number of equal merchants at a ba- zaar—hence the name.  Bazaar started out as a fork of the Arch distributed revision control sys- tem.  A fork means that the developers disagree on where to take the pro- gram, and they break into different groups to work toward each group’s  different  goals.   However,  Bazaar  2  was  completely  rewritten,  as  it  was  found that the then-current code did not work in the long term.   TIP   Bazaar Bazaar can be found at http:  bazaar.canonical.com.   260   Chapter 9       Ubuntu-Related Projects and Derivatives   Ubuntu One  Ubuntu One is a single sign-on service. Ubuntu One accounts are used to  handle  authentication  for  services  throughout  the  Ubuntu  community,  including the wikis and Launchpad.  Summary In addition to building a great OS that many people use, the Ubuntu proj- ect has developed an OS that those building other operating systems use as  a basis to build from. This has come in the form of both internal partner  projects  and  external  derivative  distributions.  Together,  these  span  lan- guages, continents, and markets. Also, Ubuntu is tightly linked to Canoni- cal’s other projects: Launchpad and Bazaar. Bazaar provides a compelling  version control system, and Launchpad provides a one-stop show for bugs,  translations, and much more.   10  C H A P T E R   1 0 Ubuntu, Convergence,  and Devices of the Future  The Convergence Vision      Unity     Ubuntu Devices      The Internet of Things and Beyond The Future of the Ubuntu Desktop Summary              261           UBUNTU IS A QUICKLY evolving platform. It all started with the Desktop. As  we learned in Chapter 8, beginning with Ubuntu’s second release, a mini- mal Ubuntu version was released that could be used as a server. Later years  brought a Netbook Remix, which gave users their ﬁ rst taste of an early ver- sion of the software now widely distributed as Unity. Today, one of the most  exciting  developments  in  the  Ubuntu  ecosystem  is  the  move  to  devices.  Phones, tablets, and various Internet of Things  IoT  devices, ranging from  refrigerators to drones, have started cropping up in the Ubuntu ecosystem.  These devices are driven by innovations within the Ubuntu software com- munity in the form of more advanced package managers that lend them- selves to smaller devices and power-saving formats. Users in this market  also  have  expectations  that  move  beyond  the  installation  of  software  through a Linux Software Center and have inspired the development of  app stores within the Ubuntu community. The vision and software that  are leading the Ubuntu community down this path are changing rapidly  and carving out an exciting new Ubuntu-powered future.  The Convergence Vision Imagine a world where your centralized device is a single smartphone. Not  only that, but the exact same applications that you can run on your smart- phone also work on the screen of your refrigerator and can be loaded up in  your drone. There are no special versions for different devices that lag be- hind because developers haven’t updated them yet; instead, the same ap- plication is used on all of your devices. Now imagine that this system is all  open source and running Ubuntu at its core.  Nowadays, our mobile devices are very powerful on the inside. As an ex- ample, consider the Nexus 5x, a device that came out at the end of 2015.  This 5-inch handheld smartphone has 2GB of RAM and a quad-core pro- cessor.  Many  laptop  computers  have  similar—or  even  lower—speciﬁ ca- tions. Additionally, it’s becoming increasingly common for people to rely  on a smartphone as their sole computing device, using the phone’s rela- tively small interface to respond to e-mail, stay in contact with friends on  social media, and read the latest news. Our phones are becoming replace- ments for our computers, and the Ubuntu community believes we should  work to use them to their full potential.  262      Unity   263  With that point in mind, the ﬁ nal concept for both phone and tablet seeks  to provide a device that truly harnesses the power of the phone but also  gives us the screens and input devices of a desktop compute. This idea of  melding the two forms is known as convergence. With convergence, you  could connect your device to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, and have a  full Ubuntu Desktop experience powered by your phone. Late for a meet- ing? Free yourself from all those cables and continue editing your docu- ment while on the move. Taking matters a step further, you might envision  putting the same applications on devices in the Internet of Things so that  you  could  move  your  applications  beyond  the  traditional  computing  environment.  Unity Unity is both a graphical shell and an enticing idea. As with the prospect of  Ubuntu on phones and tablets, you might begin to wonder whether this  thing we call Ubuntu could really be used on everything from desktops  and servers to phones, tablets, appliances, drones, and more. The devices  themselves are just an evolution of what we have already enjoyed on the  desktop,  yet  their  code  bases  have  evolved  to  be  very  different  in  many  ways. Smartphones and tablets use a new display manager developed by  Canonical called Mir, whereas the 16.04 Ubuntu release on the desktop  continues to use Xorg. The versions of Unity differ as well, with 16.04 run- ning  what  has  been  called  Unity  7  and  the  phones  and  tablets  using  Unity 8, which requires the Mir display manager.  The operating system itself and applications on these devices are also han- dled differently. The early releases of Ubuntu phones and tablets have been  built with Click packages, which are a simpliﬁ ed version of Debian pack- ages speciﬁ cally used on the phones and available through an app store. As  described later in this chapter, these packages will soon be replaced by the  innovations made with Snaps.  Bringing unity to these versions of Unity, as well as a consolidated plat- form for all computers and devices, is an ongoing effort. There is a push to  make Ubuntu desktops ship with a default of Mir and Unity 8. For now,  16.04 is the ﬁ rst Ubuntu release where we can see how Snaps work on an  Ubuntu desktop.   264   Chapter 10       Ubuntu, Convergence, and Devices of the Future  Ubuntu Devices  Personal computers and servers are not the only devices running Ubuntu.  In 2013, the ﬁ rst Ubuntu Phone was announced; since then, all kinds of  devices have been introduced that are running Ubuntu. These Ubuntu- based devices range from a smart refrigerator that was recently showcased  at an Internet of Things conference to an artiﬁ cial intelligence device that  helps turn your house into a “smart home.”  The First Ubuntu Phones and Tablets In early 2013, it was announced that Ubuntu would have an operating sys- tem available for smartphones. Initially, three devices were supported: the  Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 4, and the Nexus 7  2012 . All of these devices  had the Android operating system preinstalled from the factory, so soft- ware then known as Ubuntu Touch was made available for download and  ﬂ ashing into the devices.  The major innovation offered by this software was its ability to solve the  problem  of  updating  thousands  of  mobile  devices  with  the  standard  Ubuntu tooling, which otherwise would have required updating devices  on a piecemeal basis with apt. The Ubuntu developers created a frame- work for Ubuntu that used read-only system snapshot images, which were  tested as they were so they could be validated before shipping. The images  could then be atomically updated using the Click packaging format, which  provided sandboxing for applications and worked with the read-only base  system.  This  process  led  to  unbreakable  updates  on  tested  hardware,  smaller  updates,  better  security,  and  more  freedom  for  individual  apps,  owing to their isolation. The evolution of this packaging from Clicks to  Snappy is discussed in greater detail later in this chapter.  Since these ﬁ rst images were made available, the Ubuntu community has  actively  worked  to  make  images  available  for  other  devices,  such  as  the  Nexus 5 and the OnePlus One. Naturally, the list of “ofﬁ cially supported”  devices  for  which  Canonical  maintains,  builds,  and  hosts  images  has  changed  over  time.  A  growing  number  of  images  have  also  been  made  available by third parties; these “community images” are typically hosted  and  developed  by  parties  that  are  interested  in  seeing  support  for  even       Ubuntu Devices    265  more devices on the market. The community images can be made by any- one—from a manufacturer to a community member. Be aware, however,  that these community images may not make all Ubuntu features available  in the devices. Porting takes time and effort, so developers may be working  on only small sets of features at a time.  The Ubuntu Edge Crowdfunding  is  a  phenomenon  in  which  people  all  around  the  world  support a project by donating a certain amount of money to it. Web sites  such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo serve as forums for crowdfunding, al- lowing applicants to set a fund-raising goal and then reward donors for  their generosity, depending on the amount donated.  Shortly  after  the  Ubuntu  mobile  operating  system  was  announced,  Ca- nonical launched a crowdsourced project to build a device that would sur- pass all the industry standards at the time: the Ubuntu Edge. This phone  was expected to have the fastest multicore processor, 4GB of RAM, 128GB  of storage, a Sapphire crystal display, and an ability to boot Ubuntu and  Android. When people opened the Indiegogo page to check on and donate  to the project, they were struck by an interesting fact: For the campaign to  be successful and for the devices to be produced, enthusiasts would have to  raise $32 million in a month. Priced at $695 per device, the Ubuntu Edge  promised to be the phone that would revolutionize the mobile industry.  Ultimately, the Ubuntu Edge project did not meet its fund-raising goal,  collecting pledges of only $12.8 million. That sum, while impressive  and a  record for crowdfunding , was not enough to launch the project. In the  end, all donations were returned to contributors. Despite its failure, this  exciting campaign set a very high bar for upcoming handheld devices and  brought a tangible level of excitement to the Ubuntu community. It was  clear that a strong demand existed for a device like the Ubuntu Edge.  Commercial Phone and Tablet Although  Ubuntu  Edge  campaign  did  not  succeed  in  getting  adequate  funding, the buzz generated by the attempt and the progressive speciﬁ ca- tions outlined attracted vendors’ interest. With the race for mobile devices    266   Chapter 10       Ubuntu, Convergence, and Devices of the Future  going  strong,  Ubuntu  was  clearly  poised  to  become  a  key  player  in  this  market. People continued asking when would they be able to buy a device  that had Ubuntu preinstalled. Behind the scenes, Canonical was working  with  device  manufacturers  to  bring  a  product  to  market.  Soon,  rumors  started spreading that two companies would be producing these phones:  BQ  headquartered in Spain  and Meizu  located in China .  The next step in the journey to the Ubuntu phone occurred when a small  group of people from the Ubuntu community were invited to join a closed  community called Ubuntu Insiders, whose members would be the ﬁ rst to  know what was happening with Ubuntu on the phone. In February 2015, at  an Insiders-only event in London, the ﬁ rst Ubuntu device was released: the  Aquaris  E4.5  Ubuntu  Edition.  Soon  thereafter,  the  Meizu  MX4  Ubuntu  Edition was released. Both of these devices came with Ubuntu preinstalled,  and the hardware worked right out of the box. Later in 2015, the Aquar- ius E5 Ubuntu Edition  Figure 10-1  was released. All of these early com-  Figure 10-1  Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition      Ubuntu Devices    267  mercial  devices  had  some  restrictions  in  terms  of  which  networks  they  worked on, since the phones were originally designed to work only in cer- tain regions.   In 2016, the release announcements continued. The Meizu Pro 5, released  in early 2016, offered the largest screen and most memory of an Ubuntu  phone yet, along with global coverage.   Finally, the ﬁ rst Ubuntu tablet was announced: the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu  Edition  Figure 10-2 . In addition to being a tablet, this 10.1-inch BQ de- vice achieved an important milestone: It was the ﬁ rst commercial Ubuntu  device  to  feature  full  convergence  out  of  the  box.  You  can  connect  the  Aquaris M10 to a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, as well as a monitor, to  achieve the full desktop experience. In contrast to some of the convergence  previews on other devices made available prior to 2016, the Aquaris M10  offered  convergence  capabilities  as  soon  as  you  turn  it  on  for  the  ﬁ rst  time—a feat not hitherto achieved by any commercial devices.  Figure 10-2  Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition, converging with a Bluetooth keyboard  and mouse   268   Chapter 10       Ubuntu, Convergence, and Devices of the Future  The near future will certainly bring more innovations centered on phones,  tablets, and their move toward convergence.

The Internet of Things and Beyond The  technologies  that  are  now  a  pervasive  presence  in  our  lives  have  evolved  quickly.  Our  lives  are  enriched  by  smartwatches  that  track  our  steps and heartbeats and share them with our friends, light bulbs that turn  on and off or dim with control from a smartphone, and intelligent ther- mostats that learn from residents’ typical behaviors, among many other  innovations. We are constantly surrounded by technology, and there is a  growing desire for this technology to be connected to how we live. We ex- pect our light bulbs to turn on as we enter the house, and our thermostat  to save energy when no one is home. We envision a world in which appli- ances share information to learn how their users interact with them.  The ﬁ rst step toward achieving this vision with Ubuntu was the develop- ment of a very lightweight version, that, despite its small size, would still of- fer the same power as a regular image. Ubuntu Core, a minimal version that  installed only those components required for the system to work, was the  ﬁ rst foray into this space. The technology that allows for this slim image is  driven today by Snaps. Snaps can be seen as the next evolution of the Click  packages used on the Ubuntu version running on phones and tablets today.   Snaps  behave  differently  than  the  traditional  Debian  packages  that  have  been used to built Ubuntu since the beginning of the project. Instead of  being a packaged set of ﬁ les that is unpackaged to install, the Snap package  is essentially mounted onto the ﬁ le system. Snaps then have a writable space  for user data, which is conﬁ ned by applying security proﬁ les. Snaps also  ship with everything they need to run, instead of calling out to external li- braries to obtain resource. Individual Snaps for apps do not manipulate the  Snappy Ubuntu Core operating system—which, it should be mentioned, is  also  a  Snap  itself!  Between  this  isolation  and  the  combination  of  logical  separation, AppArmor proﬁ les, seccomp, and kernel namespaces, this ar- rangement creates a secure barrier between the operating system and apps.  Nevertheless, Snaps are not completely isolated; a series of interfaces allow       The Internet of Things and Beyond   269  them to communicate, share speciﬁ cally deﬁ ned resources, and access par- ticular hardware. In the resulting ecosystem, making packages for Snappy  Ubuntu Core is considerably easier than creating traditional Debian pack- ages. In fact, using the tool called Snapcraft, a package can be made from  existing software in a matter of minutes. In turn, it is now considerably eas- ier to create appliances and devices with Ubuntu at the core.  Major Devices While Snappy Ubuntu Core remains under aggressive development, many  members of the Ubuntu community have begun to get very creative with  even the most basic implementations of slim Ubuntu installs. To date, de- vices relying on these lightweight versions have included drones, robots,  toys, and home appliances.  Drones  Drones have become very popular in recent years. Whether the  user is a law enforcement agency in the United States that is putting a cam- era on a drone to know when to step in with crowd control or a postal ser- vice in southeast Asia that is experimenting with delivering packages to a  nearby island, a wide variety of uses for drones are popping up worldwide.  Hobbyist use has grown as well, with consumers taking advantage of this  technology in myriad ways, from recording video from an angle that they  were not able to reach before, to delivering messages to their neighbors. As  interest in drones continues to grow, the creative uses for them have like- wise exploded.  Ubuntu drones are keeping pace with this evolution. Erle Robotics in Spain  was the ﬁ rst to publicly announce the commercial availability of a drone   user assembly required  that is based on Ubuntu Core. The Chinese com- pany DJI has launched Manifold, an Ubuntu-based platform on which the  user can build their own application with DJI’s developer drone platform,  Matrice  100.  UAVIA,  a  French  company,  has  unveiled  remote-controlled  Ubuntu drones, which are used for inspection and surveillance.  Refrigerators  and  Beyond  On  the  domestic  front,  appliances  have  quickly embraced Ubuntu. GE Appliances, a division of General Electric,  has developed ChillHub, a smart refrigerator running on Ubuntu. Devel- opment  has  been  considerably  open  for  such  a  product  from  a  large    270   Chapter 10       Ubuntu, Convergence, and Devices of the Future  company, so there is even the ability to make modiﬁ cations to and extend  this device’s capabilities via USB. For example, you might want to build an  extension that is a milk jug weight sensor. When this sensor is active, your  refrigerator can alert you when you are running low on milk.  The commercial availability of a refrigerator equipped with Ubuntu opens  up  a  wealth  of  opportunities  to  extend  the  functionality  of  such  appli- ances. This is only the beginning—just imagine what might emerge next!  Robots  When  you  hear  the  word “robot,”  you  might  imagine  a  small  person-shaped  machine  or  perhaps  a  mechanized  assembly  line.  More  prosaically, robots can be found in an enormous number of venues today.  From surgery to mining to military operations, robots are increasingly do- ing jobs that are either unsatisfying or unsafe for humans to perform.  Naturally, a robot has to run software—and this is precisely where Ubuntu  comes in. Released in 2015, the ﬁ rst publicly showcased Ubuntu-based ro- bot was the Erle Spider. This walking toy runs with an ARM-based hard- ware board with Snappy Ubuntu Core and is controlled by a joystick. The  toy is open source, so you can build your own applications for it. In the  future, perhaps we’ll see some interesting work coming out of it.  TIP   Initially,  the  Erle  Spider  was  intended  to  have  eight  legs—that’s  the  source  of  its  name.  Because of technical constraints, the number of legs was eventually reduced to six, but the  name was already set. So, if you see a six-legged spider out in the wild, you can rest assured  it is an Ubuntu spider.  Another early device is Mycroft  Figure 10-3 , an artiﬁ cial intelligence de- vice that is intended to connect to all your other appliances and make your  life easier. It begins with simple reporting tasks such as giving the weather,  reminders, or alarms, but can also set your thermostat to a speciﬁ c tem- perature or dim your lights. The Mycroft project was crowdfunded  just  like the Ubuntu Edge , but reached its goal  unlike the ill-fated Ubuntu  Edge .  Based  on  Snappy  Ubuntu  Core,  Mycroft  demonstrates  how  we  want to see the Internet of Things work—that is, one device, linked to oth- ers over the Internet, helping you with your daily duties.      The Internet of Things and Beyond   271  Figure 10-3  Mycroft device, based on Snappy Ubuntu Core  As these types of Ubuntu-based devices continue to reach the market and  developers  considering  using  Snappy  Ubuntu  Core  for  a  base,  it  bears   noting that one of the major advantages of devices using Snappy Ubuntu  Core is the use of the same operating system image across all devices. Ev- ery time Canonical puts out a new version of the operating system, any of  those devices could be updated to use it. Given recent headlines about se- curity vulnerabilities and the number of out-of-date and insecure IoT de- vices proliferating in the wild, this consistency is a valuable asset to anyone  seeking to develop and run a device securely.  The Cloud Snappy Ubuntu Core is also available for servers running in the cloud. With  a focus on containers, its slim initial image and transactional updates allow  for a complementary solution for these non-local resources. Cloud servers  tend to be ephemeral, easily replaced by identical servers, and readily scaled  up and down as demand dictates. The small size of Snappy Ubuntu Core  lends itself well to this environment and has the potential to make automa- tion  based  on  these  cloud  images  even  easier.  The  diff-style  approach,  which relies on incremental updates of packages rather than full downloads  of packages, also helps with the speed of updates to deployments.   272   Chapter 10       Ubuntu, Convergence, and Devices of the Future  Security also plays an important role in the cloud. Given how easy it is to  create Snaps, third parties can readily make packages themselves and up- date those packages in a timely manner. As a consequence, they need not  rely upon a skilled Debian packager they’ve hired or found in the commu- nity to do the work for them; rather, the third parties can handle these  tasks  themselves.  Since  the  main  archive  is  the  only  one  ofﬁ cially  sup- ported  by  the  Ubuntu  Security  Team,  we  envision  a  future  where  users  may be less likely to use an older version of software included in the Uni- verse repository and beyond that may not have security ﬁ xes because it  was too difﬁ cult to make that package available. If the implementation of  Snaps continues on its present path, then it should be possible to ensure  signiﬁ cant isolation of applications from one another and thereby avoid  problems with the operating system as well. This protection comes at the  expense  of  larger  package  sizes,  however:  Libraries  are  not  shared,  but  rather bundled in. In addition, it means that applications are no longer  required to use the version of a library that is in a repository. Finally, Snaps  embody the concept of a known state, since they are largely read-only. In  turn, it is easy to determine whether your system has been tampered with.  Undoubtedly, audit tools will begin to pop up in the near future to assist  with making this determination.  The Future of the Ubuntu Desktop Given the proliferation of devices that use Snaps rather than Debian pack- ages, you might be wondering when and if Snaps are coming to your desk- top. As mentioned earlier in the chapter, the 16.04 release was the ﬁ rst to  offer a preview of how this convergence would work. The 16.04 Ubuntu  release  continues  to  support  the  presence  of  Ubuntu  on  desktops  and  servers  built  with  Debian-based  packages,  but  also  reserves  a  segment   “dimension”  of the system speciﬁ cally for Snaps. Thus, the same security  seen in the devices discussed in this chapter is available on the desktop in  the form of read-only system images and apps as sandboxed Snaps. These  Snaps are available for installation through the GNOME Software Center,  which has been equipped for this release to support them. Snaps are not  yet  central  to  the  operation  of  an  Ubuntu  Desktop,  but  may  be  a  good  solution  for  applications  that  are  subject  to  frequent  updates  and  take  large amounts of time to package for the archives, or apps that developers  wish to offer on an alternative channel. Time will tell which kinds of appli-      Summary   273  cations end up as Snaps and which remain in the traditional Debian-based  repositories. Looking further into the future, the vision is to have some- thing like a Snappy Ubuntu Personal version that is built with a focus on  using Snaps throughout the system.  NOTE   For those who are worried in the face of all this innovation around Snaps, rest easy: There  are no plans to stop offering the traditional Debian package-based Ubuntu Desktop.  Summary Ubuntu is no longer restricted to the conﬁ nes of desktops, laptops, and  servers: Ubuntu-driven devices are starting to make their way into every  nook and cranny of our lives. Smartphones are central to many things we  do every day, and Ubuntu-based phones are making great strides as evi- denced by the multiple well-received commercial launches of Ubuntu de- vices. Whether it be an Ubuntu-powered smartphone, a smart refrigerator,  or a robot that can carry your glass back into the kitchen, the technology  used in all of these products promises to pave the way to a better Ubuntu.

Early articles  about  Ubuntu  bore  subtitles  asking, “Would  you  like  some  community  with that?” The earliest press releases and communiqués from the project  emphasized a “community-driven approach” to operating system devel- opment  and  distribution.  In  fact,  the  highest-level  governance  board  in  Ubuntu is called the Community Council and Canonical, Ltd. and em- ploys a full-time community team. It is to that end that we have made a  very conscious decision to spend an entire chapter of this book describing  the Ubuntu community. In fact, every edition has been dedicated to the  Ubuntu community!  Still, while the Ubuntu community is important, it is not always easy to  succinctly describe it. Ubuntu is, in large part, developed and funded by  Canonical. The community, almost by deﬁ nition, extends far beyond Ca- nonical. The Ubuntu project has Members and self-declared activists, but  the Ubuntu community is more than even those with such explicitly de- clared relationships. The project contains a wide variety of venues for par- ticipation.  But  while  the  community  is  active  in  each  of  these  areas,  its  scope is even wider.  The Ubuntu community is the collection of individuals who build, pro- mote, distribute, support, document, translate, and advocate Ubuntu—in  myriad ways and in myriad venues. Most people in the Ubuntu commu- nity have never met, talked with, or heard of each other. Members of the  community are linked by their contributions, both technical and nontech- nical, and by Ubuntu itself. These contributions have built Ubuntu as a  distribution, as a social movement, as a set of support infrastructures, and  as a project. In short, they have built Ubuntu as a community. While any  active software development project has a number of people making con- tributions, not every project has a community.  Community is also a term that represents a promise by the Ubuntu project  to remain inclusive. The focus on community means that volunteers are  not  only  welcome  but  also  essential.  It  means  that  Ubuntu  is  a “place”  where individuals can come together to create something greater than the  sum of its parts. The word community gives a nod to the fact that while  much development work is paid for by Canonical, and while some people  contribute more hours, more effort, more code, more translations, more   276   Venues and Events   277  documentation, or more advocacy work to Ubuntu than others, no indi- vidual  or  subgroup  can  take  credit  for  everything  that  Ubuntu  has  be- come.  In  Ubuntu,  no  contribution  is  expendable.  Having  a  community  also reﬂ ects Ubuntu’s goal to provide a low barrier for entry for these con- tributions. Anyone who cares about Ubuntu can contribute to the project  and can, in whatever ways are most appropriate, become a participant in  the Ubuntu community.  This  chapter  provides  a  bird’s-eye  view  of  the  venues  and  processes  in  which the Ubuntu community is active. First, it takes a tour through the  venues through which the Ubuntu community both consumes and com- municates information. It continues by looking at the way the community  is organized and the processes by which that organization works. Finally, it  walks you through the ways you can participate in the Ubuntu community  and contribute to its success.  Venues and Events As we described in Chapter 1, transparent and public communication was  an early goal of the Ubuntu project. Technical and community decisions  are made publicly and are accessible to all interested parties. When this is  impossible  e.g., when there is a face-to-face meeting and it’s simply not  possible  for  everyone  interested  to  attend ,  the  community  attempts  to  publish summaries and minutes and to provide avenues for feedback. The  Ubuntu community contains no “member only,” “developer only,” or “de- cision maker only” back-channels except to preserve individual privacy or  security—and the Ubuntu community refuses to create them. All work in  Ubuntu occurs in places where everyone can view the work, and anyone  who agrees to engage constructively and respectfully can participate.  Of course, this activity is public only to those who know where to ﬁ nd it.  This section tries to document the venues for communication in Ubuntu  as completely as possible. It describes the places where discussions of de- velopment, support, and advocacy take place. While nobody can engage in  communication in all of the venues described, knowledge of what exists  allows  participants  to  be  more  informed  when  they  need  to  choose  the  right place to ask a question or to make a suggestion.   278   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  Ubuntu Community Web Site The Ubuntu Community Web site  http:  community.ubuntu.com  is the  main portal for learning about the Ubuntu community. This site provides  links that explain how you can contribute to various parts of the project.  Areas for collaboration include current programs in which the commu- nity is participating, such as the Google Summer of Code. The Web site  shares details about speciﬁ c areas in which you can get involved, such as  Documentation and Translations.  An overview of community structure is also provided on this Web site, ex- plaining the governance structure and the councils and boards. Finally, the  site provides an overview of the support and documentation options for  users of Ubuntu.  Mailing Lists The  single  most  important  venue  for  communication  in  Ubuntu  is  the  Ubuntu mailing lists. These lists provide the space where all important an- nouncements  are  made  and  where  development  discussions  take  place.  There are, at the time of this writing, more than 300 active, public e-mail  lists. This number is constantly growing. However, great care is taken by  the Ubuntu Community Council to ensure that this list stays current as  the community continues to enjoy its growth.  An up-to-date, full page of mailing lists for Ubuntu can be found at https:   lists.ubuntu.com, where users can see a list of available mailing lists, view  archived discussions, and subscribe to lists through a Web interface.  Lists are one of the oldest forms of communication by e-mail. A mailing  list provides a single e-mail address that, when mailed to, will then relay  the received message to a large number of people. In Ubuntu, lists are top- ical, and individuals can subscribe to a mailing list if they want to receive  information on the list’s topic. All mailing lists at Ubuntu are hosted at  http:  lists.ubuntu.com.  With a few exceptions  e.g., the e-mail list for the Community Council ,  anybody can subscribe to any Ubuntu list. In most cases, the capability to  send e-mail to lists is restricted to list members  membership in lists is, of       Venues and Events   279  course,  open  to  anyone .  This  means  that  all  e-mail  sent  to  a  list  from  someone who is not a member of that list is put into a queue to be re- viewed by a human moderator before it is broadcast to list members. This  is done as an antispam measure. Users can subscribe to lists and then con- ﬁ gure the system to never send e-mail. For several e-mail lists, all messages  are moderated. This is largely to ensure that lists remain “low volume” or  “announcement only.”  Ubuntu’s mailing lists are run by the popular Mailman software, which  may be familiar to some users. Mailman makes it simple to subscribe to  lists, to unsubscribe, and to conﬁ gure any number of options about mail  delivery. One popular option is to receive a daily digest of messages rather  than a separate e-mail each time a new message is sent. This is all available  through a Web interface at https:  lists.ubuntu.com. Users can also sub- scribe to lists by sending an e-mail with “subscribe” in the subject line to   -REQUEST@lists.ubuntu.com.  While each list plays an important role in the Ubuntu community, the fol- lowing central lists warrant a little more detail. You might ﬁ nd it a good  idea to subscribe to them.  ubuntu-announce  This  fully  moderated  list  relays  all  important  an- nouncements for the Ubuntu project and usually contains less than one  e-mail  per  week.  It  is  the  place  where  new  releases  are  announced  and  where other important information can be found ﬁ rst. If you use Ubuntu,  you may want to consider subscribing to this list. If you subscribe to only  one list, this should be it.  community-announce  This  fully  moderated  list  provides  announce- ments  that  the  general  community  may  ﬁ nd  valuable.  Announcements  may  include  details  about  when  the  next  Ubuntu  Developer  Summit  is  being held and how to get involved or details of upcoming community  elections, like that of the Ubuntu Community Council. No technical ex- pertise is required to read this list, and it’s recommended you subscribe to  keep track of events in the community.  ubuntu-devel-announce  This  fully  moderated  list  contains  announce- ments related to the development of Ubuntu. It is low volume and contains    280   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  one to three e-mails per week. If you work with code in Ubuntu, use a de- velopment release, or contribute on any technical level, you should be on  this list. This is the list that everyone involved in development for Ubuntu  is expected to read.  ubuntu-devel-discuss  This  list  is  the  primary  open  list  for  general- purpose discussion of Ubuntu development. If you are looking to contrib- ute to Ubuntu in any technical way, you should subscribe to this list and  begin  to  follow  the  discussion.  The  list  has  a  relatively  high  volume  of e-mails.  ubuntu-devel  This  list  is  a  moderated  list  for  discussion  of  Ubuntu.  While  subscribing  remains  free,  posting  to  the  list  is  restricted  to  those  who  are  Ubuntu  developers  or  to  chosen  other  developers.  Others  may  post, but all posts are checked by a moderation team.  Internet Relay Chat While mailing lists provide the primary venue for asynchronous commu- nication  i.e., not at the same time , there is still an important need for  synchronous, or real-time, collaboration. Internet Relay Chat  IRC  ﬁ lls  this niche. While it was designed primarily for group  i.e., many-to-many   communication in channels, it is also equipped with private messaging ca- pabilities that facilitate one-to-one communication—all instantaneously.  IRC  is  very  similar  to  instant  messaging  or  chat  room  communication.  While time zones and a round globe make it difﬁ cult for the global Ubuntu  community to meet at the same time, many users and developers take ad- vantage of IRC’s capability to let anyone chat about an issue in real time or  to ask a question and have it answered immediately.  Like mailing lists, IRC channels provide a venue for many different types  of communication in many different subcommunities in Ubuntu. There  are many different channels, including channels in a variety of languages.   All ofﬁ cial Ubuntu IRC channels are located on the freenode IRC network,  which also hosts a range of other free and open source software projects.  Users can connect to IRC using several pieces of software in Ubuntu, in- cluding Empathy, Hexchat  successor to XChat; Figure 11-1 , Irssi, and a       Venues and Events   281  Figure 11-1  Hexchat is an IRC client that allows Ubuntu users to connect to the  Ubuntu IRC channels.  freenode webchat client is available for users who aren’t using a local appli- cation on their machine for IRC but would like to join the channels from  time to time  Figure 11-2 . Mailing lists such as ubuntu-users@lists.ubuntu .com will assist users in ﬁ nding the right help and support; ubuntu is de- signed  for  help  and  support.  When  joining  any  channel,  users  should   Figure 11-2  The freenode webchat client sign-in screen and view of the  ubuntu-community-team IRC channel on freenode.net   282   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  carefully read the topic, as many frequently asked questions are answered  there,  and  moderators  of  the  channel  can  be  annoyed  by  users  who  ask  questions  the  moderators  have  already  taken  the  time  to  answer  in  the  channel’s topic.  Currently, the ubuntu channel is usually the biggest channel on the free- node network, with more than 1,500 simultaneous users at most times,  and it’s continuing to grow—especially around releases. Another impor- tant channel is ubuntu-devel, which is reserved for discussion of Ubuntu  development. Support for development releases has moved to ubuntu+1.  Maintaining  channels  with  speciﬁ c  purposes  has  allowed  the  support  community to stay focused and help as many people as possible. A full list  of channels can be found at https:  wiki.ubuntu.com IRC ChannelList.  Web Forums The ofﬁ cial Ubuntu forums are the most frequently used venues for com- munication in Ubuntu. For a number of reasons, many users prefer com- munication through a Web-based forum or bulletin board over mailing  lists. The Ubuntu forums were created to satisfy this group and have done  so with amazing success.  The  forums  are  accessible  online  at  http:  ubuntuforums.org  and  have  shown an impressive amount of usage.  The forums boast more than 2 mil- lion registered users, with approximately 5,000 online at any given moment.   The topics discussed in the forums run the gamut in categories like these:        Support discussions, including spaces for questions about speciﬁ c  hardware  e.g., computers with Ubuntu preinstalled, or networking  and multimedia cards  and speciﬁ c use cases  e.g., desktop or  server users     Ubuntu community discussions, including spaces for discussions by     people working on art for Ubuntu, those working in science and  education, and those developing new documentation and tutorials Forum-speciﬁ c community discussion spaces, including several social  spaces and places for administrative and community governance  discussions          Venues and Events   283  By covering such ground, the Ubuntu forums provide an impressive sup- port resource. They offer an excellent venue for both asking questions and  answering questions, and both receiving support and making important  contributions to the Ubuntu community. If you are interested in any of  these, the forums are a good place to begin.  The only caveat regarding the forums worth mentioning is that they are  not frequently used by those developing Ubuntu—although there are ex- ceptions to that rule. If users want to get involved in technical contribu- tions  to  the  project,  they  will,  in  all  likelihood,  have  to  augment  their  forums’ patronage with the use of mailing lists or Launchpad.   The forums were founded by and are moderated and maintained entirely  by volunteers, and are governed by the Forums Council  discussed later in  this chapter .  Wikis Since nearly day one, a large chunk of Ubuntu documentation and sup- port has taken place in the ofﬁ cial Ubuntu wiki. In case you don’t already  know, a wiki—pronounced “wik-ee”—is a Web site where any viewer can  add, remove, or edit content.  There are several Ubuntu wikis, but two are central to the community. The  ﬁ rst is the Community Help wiki at https:  help.ubuntu.com community   Figure  11-3 .  It  is  edited  and  directed  by  the  Ubuntu  Documentation  Team and focuses on issues of community-produced technical documen- tation for Ubuntu. The second wiki is at https:  wiki.ubuntu.com and is  meant to be used for everything else. The Community Help wiki can be  thought of as a project to build an expansive manual through community  contributions and editing. The general-purpose wiki is used for speciﬁ ca- tion  writing  and  trafﬁ c,  conference  organization,  meet-ups,  pages  for  teams and individuals involved in Ubuntu, and absolutely anything else  that is in written form and relevant to the Ubuntu community. Both wikis  can be edited, added to, or reorganized by anyone in the community who  creates  an  account,  and  edits  are  unrestricted.  Since  registration  is  re- quired, each change can be traced to a particular user.   284   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  Figure 11-3  Front page of the Ubuntu community support and documentation wiki  Unlike other documentation that ships with Ubuntu, anyone can ﬁ x an  error, inaccuracy, or out-of-date fact in the wiki. As a result, there is no  good way to determine whether information in the wiki is correct. It can- not  be  subjected  to  the  same  type  of  quality  assurance  workﬂ ow  that  a  document such as this book might be. However, it is also much more likely  to be up-to-date in the quickly changing world of Ubuntu development,  where there is a new release every six months. The wiki provides a venue  for this level of up-to-date information with a low barrier to entry and, as  a result, acts as an invaluable resource for the community.  The Fridge The Fridge  https:  fridge.ubuntu.com  is the quirky community portal  for Ubuntu. In many Western cultures, refrigerators provide a central sort  of “bulletin board” in a family’s home. Because refrigerators are magnetic,  children and parents can use magnets to hang pieces of paper that they  want to share with the community of people who come in contact with  that fridge. For children, this often includes good grades, news reports, or       Venues and Events   285  other information that someone is proud of or wants to share. The Fridge  tries to create such a shared resource within the Ubuntu community. The  Fridge home page is shown in Figure 11-4.  The Fridge is perhaps best described as the community portal for Ubuntu.  It is part news site, part grassroots marketing and advocacy site. It hosts  news, interviews, calendars with lists of upcoming events, polls, and much  more. The core content on the site is arranged as a Weblog. Users frequently  set The Fridge as their home page or subscribe to the site via its RSS feed.  The Fridge is unique in the community in that it appeals to a wide variety  of  Ubuntu  participants—developers,  advocates,  translators,  users—and  provides  a  venue  where  each  group  can  share  information  with  others.  There is a story every two to three days on The Fridge. Users can comment  and discuss each story in the comments section on The Fridge.  Anyone can contribute content to The Fridge. If you would like to contrib- ute,  you  can  do  so  by  sending  your  suggestions  for  features,  articles,  or  even a piece of original work  such as an article, photo, or event review  to   Figure 11-4  The Fridge home page   286   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  editor.ubuntu.news@ubuntu.com  or  by  following  any  of  the  suggested  ways on the https:  wiki.ubuntu.com Fridge Submit.  AskUbuntu.com Ask  Ubuntu  at  http:  askubuntu.com  is  a  free  and  community-driven  question-and-answer site designed to make it easy for users to get answers  to Ubuntu-related questions. It’s also a place for users to share their knowl- edge about the Ubuntu platform.  The site concentrates on answers that are voted on by the community and  peer reviewed by other members of the site, which can keep the informa- tion up-to-date and topical.  The Ask Ubuntu Web site features the ability for users to ask and answer  questions,  and,  through  membership  and  active  participation,  to  vote  questions and answers up or down and edit questions and answers in a  wiki  fashion.  Users  of  Stack  Overﬂ ow  can  earn  reputation  points  and  “badges”; for example, a person is awarded 10 reputation points for receiv- ing an “up” vote on an answer given to a question, and can receive badges  for their valued contributions. All user-generated content is licensed un- der a Creative Commons license.  From here users will have access to answer or ask questions as well as search  and view all the questions that have already been asked. Users do not have  to register or log in to have access to the site. For those users who wish to  register, there are several ways this can be accomplished. If you have an ac- count  on  Google,  Yahoo!,  myOpenID,  Facebook,  your  Ubuntu  account,  AOL, or OpenID, you can associate that account to your AskUbuntu ac- count and sign in using any of those accounts.  Social Media Social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ are also used to  disseminate information to the community as well.   Facebook: http:  facebook.com ubuntulinux Twitter: http:  twitter.com ubuntu Google+: https:  google.com +Ubuntu      Venues and Events   287  Online Summits and Sprints Since Ubuntu was ﬁ rst released, there have been several public developer  summits  and  sprints  organized  and  funded  by  Canonical.  Highlights  include:    The Mataró Sessions in Mataró, Catalonia, Spain, in December     2004—the ﬁ rst Ubuntu development summit    The two named Ubuntu conferences in 2005: Ubuntu Down Under     in Sydney, Australia, in April and the Ubuntu Below Zero in Mon- treal, Canada, in November    Ubuntu Developer Summit Mountain View at Google Headquarters     in Mountain View, California, in November 2006    Ubuntu Developer Summit-R in Copenhagen, Denmark, in Octo-    ber 2012  As  the  community  has  grown,  it  has  become  increasingly  difﬁ cult  for  Ubuntu Developer Summit  UDS  events to accommodate everyone who  wants to attend in person. In 2013, the Ubuntu Developer Summits moved  to being online-only events that are held over video chat. These new events  are called Ubuntu Online Summits  UOS .  With the support of Canonical, Ubuntu tries to organize the Ubuntu On- line Summits so that they occur twice per release. Usually the ﬁ rst occurs  toward the very beginning of a release cycle, so that the speciﬁ cations and  goals for the forthcoming release can be discussed, thrashed out, and de- cided upon. A second UOS then takes place mid-cycle so that tasks can be  formally reviewed and plans adjusted prior to release as needed. While the  format changes slightly each time, these meetings have been between three  days and two weeks in length.   At UOS, attendees describe features that they would like to see in the next  Ubuntu release. At an arranged time or in a series of meetings, a small set of  interested community contributors and developers work to draft a written  speciﬁ cation. This process of drafting involves brainstorming and ends up  with a formal, approved spec that describes a problem or need and provides  a detailed description of how it will be ﬁ xed or implemented. While these    288   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  speciﬁ cations are often technical in nature, they are also used to describe  goals  that  may  pertain  to  localization,  documentation,  or  community  building. For example, both The Fridge and the planning of each summit  began as a speciﬁ cation. With time, these speciﬁ cations are categorized in  terms of priority for the upcoming release. Later, individuals will claim or  be assigned some set of these specs. Each speciﬁ cation is written up and  improved  as  a  blueprint  on  Launchpad  so  that  Ubuntu  developers  and  contributors who cannot attend the summit are still able to participate.  These summits also address issues within the community. For example,  many of the Ubuntu leaders participate to discuss how they could help  grow not only their own leadership abilities but those of the Ubuntu com- munity as well.  In addition to these summits, Canonical organizes a number of in-person,  invitation-only sprints each year. These sprints tend to be one- to three- week  intense  collocated  work  sessions  that  involve  a  team  or  subteam  tasked with a well-deﬁ ned goal. They provide a time when team members  can write code, write documentation, make plans, or do whatever else is  necessary to fulﬁ ll that goal. The sprints tend to involve fewer than 100  people, and their attempts to squeeze large amounts of work into a short  period of time have earned them a reputation for being exhausting, fulﬁ ll- ing,  amazingly  productive,  fun  experiences.  These  sprints  are  work  ses- sions and are usually limited to a group of Canonical employees; however,  on occasion, they may also include volunteer attendees.  UbuCons Online summits and sprints are effective but are primarily of interest to  technically minded people or individuals who are already very actively in- volved  in  the  Ubuntu  community.  Their  goal  is  to  accomplish  work  through high-bandwidth interaction among existing teams. User confer- ences,  known  as  UbuCons,  try  to  provide  an  alternative  space  for  users  who are not yet actively involved in the community. These conferences at- tempt to bring people up to speed on Ubuntu and to provide a space for  community building, support, and networking.      Venues and Events   289  While many local community teams have regular meetings and their own  Ubuntu events, several larger-scale UbuCons have been held to date, and  several  more  are  currently  being  planned.  The  ﬁ rst  two  UbuCons  took  place at Google headquarters, in Mountain View and in New York City,  and  others  are  designed  to  coincide  with  the  much  larger  Linux World  conferences that many other Ubuntu users attend.  Attended by a group of  a few hundred users and a handful of developers, UbuCons have provided  a simple way for users to connect with one another. Additionally, some  UbuCons  have  provided  space  for  “installfests”  where  users  can  bring  computers and have Ubuntu installed on their machines by other Ubuntu  users, developers, and aﬁ cionados.  Any active group of Ubuntu users can plan a UbuCon, and UbuCons have  taken place in a variety of locations around the world. For example, Ubu- Cons now take place in conjunction with such events as the Southern Cal- ifornia  Linux  Expo,  Ohio  Linux  Fest,  Southeast  Linux  Fest,  and  others.  This piggybacking onto the larger events worked so well that in 2010, sev- eral other organizations permitted a UbuCon to be organized as a smaller  part of their larger event, and the practice is expected to continue in the  future. When these UbuCons are collocated with conferences, they are well  attended because Ubuntu users are already attending the larger events. Lo- cal Community teams  LoCos, covered later in this chapter  can afford to  organize  these  UbuCons  because  the  venue  costs  are  quite  low  and  can  usually be covered by only one sponsor. Such gatherings are free events,  and popular Ubuntu speakers often are already attending the larger event  and are willing and happy to add some participation in the UbuCon to  their schedule.  With the move to online-only summits, community-organized UbuCons  became even more popular. In 2016, the ﬁ rst UbuCon Summit was held in  Pasadena, California. A collaboration between a LoCo and Canonical, the  UbuCon Summit grew out of an existing UbuCon that had been hosted by  the  California  LoCo  in  the  past.  The  UbuCon  Summit  featured  a  user  track and a developer track on the ﬁ rst day, and an unconference for devel- opers and other Ubuntu contributors on the second day. This was the ﬁ rst  summit-type  event  to  have  strong  funding,  planning,  and  collaboration    290   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  between Canonical and the community, and also featured external spon- sors, including GitHub, Dell, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.  While conferences and summits act as a site for major technical advances  in brainstorming and development, they are also fun and enjoyable expe- riences. They provide a venue for users to put faces to names, IRC nick- names, and e-mail addresses, and they provide for enjoyable, humorous,  and productive interaction.   Planet Ubuntu For a window into the people and teams who make Ubuntu what it is, the  blog aggregator Planet Ubuntu  http:  planet.ubuntu.com  is a great place  to start  Figure 11-5 . A blog aggregator is basically a blog of blogs that re- trieves  the  latest  posts  from  Ubuntu  members  who  have  chosen  to  add  their  blogs  to  the  system  and  then  publishes  a  single  blog  in  reverse  chronological order. Although much of the content in Planet Ubuntu is  about Ubuntu, as a window into the Ubuntu membership, Planet Ubuntu  also includes information from the personal lives of community members.  In this way, Planet Ubuntu provides a good way for participants to put   Figure 11-5  Planet Ubuntu      Teams, Processes, and Community Governance   291  their  stamp  on  the  Ubuntu  community  and  for  others  to  see  what  the  Ubuntu community is doing.  Teams, Processes, and Community Governance Ubuntu operates under the famous hacker mantra of “rough consensus  and running code.” The project attempts to forge consensus, to make good  technical decisions, and to move forward. It attempts to minimize politici- zation wherever possible and to distribute power to those who are best at  getting good work done. Mark Shuttleworth explains, “This is not a de- mocracy, it’s a meritocracy. We try to operate more on consensus than on  votes, seeking agreement from the people who will have to do the work.”  The project attempts to keep disagreements from spiraling out of control  by  enforcing  mutual  respect  at  all  times  with  its  Code  of  Conduct,  de- scribed in Chapter 1. Disagreements, of course, are inevitable and can be  technical or nontechnical in nature. The community needs to be able to  deal with these and, toward that end, has created a lightweight governance  system that aims to ensure that disagreements are resolved carefully and  that the project always has a strong, fair, and responsive direction.  The  Ubuntu Web  site  describes  the  goals  of  its  community  governance  system as threefold.  1.  Ensure that a process is deﬁ ned that allows people to contribute to   decisions regarding the Ubuntu community and distribution.  2.  Ensure that decisions regarding the Ubuntu distribution and   community are made in a fair and transparent fashion.  3.  Ensure that necessary decisions are actually made, even when there is   no clear consensus among the community.  With these goals in mind, Ubuntu’s system is based on the delegation of  decision-making  power  to  small  and  medium-sized  teams.  When  dis- agreements arise, they are handled within a relevant team. In the cases of  some larger teams, team councils handle a variety of dispute resolutions  in a very structured fashion. When teams cannot resolve their own dis- agreements  or  when  there  are  disagreements  between  teams,  issues  are    292   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  forwarded to the council or board governing that area of the community  and at times can and may be escalated to either the Community Council  or the Technical Board, depending on whether the issue is technical in  nature. As the ﬁ nancier and the project’s progenitor, Shuttleworth sits on  the  Community  Council  and  occupies  a  special  position  as  the  self- appointed benevolent dictator for life  SABDFL . Users can participate in  the  Ubuntu  governance  structure  by  serving  on  teams,  and  as  Ubuntu  members and maintainers, they have a voice in approving members of  both the Community Council and the Technical Board.  Teams Most work in Ubuntu is delegated to a set of teams, each responsible for a  particular area of work in Ubuntu. A sample of important teams  which is  by no means complete  might include the forums, news, documentation,  kernel, server, laptop, and translation teams. Anyone with an interest in a  particular aspect of the Ubuntu project can join a team’s discussion and  contribute to its decisions.  When participants feel that a particular area is under-served, they can go  ahead  and  build  a  new  team  by  drafting  the  details  of  the  team  in  the  Ubuntu wiki and recruiting contributors to help with their efforts. Teams  should always involve the participation of several individuals. There are no  one-man or one-woman teams in Ubuntu.  Several teams are so large and important that they have built their own  more advanced governance structures in the forms of team councils. These  councils  are  either  appointed  by  the  Community  Council  from  active  members and leaders within the team and act as delegates of the Commu- nity  Council  for  that  team  and  its  domain  in  the  project,  or  they  are  completely-self  run.  These  team  councils  have  regular  meetings,  resolve  conﬂ icts, report to the Community Council each cycle, and in some cases  even grant Membership on behalf of the Community Council.  The Ubuntu Community Team at Canonical As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, Canonical understands and  appreciates  what  an  important  part  the  Ubuntu  community  plays  in  the       Teams, Processes, and Community Governance   293  success and growth of each Ubuntu release. The Ubuntu community team  at Canonical is made up of several Ubuntu community managers, employed  by Canonical, who work directly on various segments of the Ubuntu com- munity, including developer relations, quality assurance, and the cloud.  The  community  team  members  each  specialize  in  and  work  with  their  area of the community to help educate, encourage, and ignite greater par- ticipation.  This  also  helps  establish  trust  relationships  with  Canonical,  upstream software projects, news and blog writers, and the wider com- munity, which helps maintain a healthy and inclusive community that is  empowered to develop, design, and inﬂ uence the direction and growth of  the Ubuntu project.  The Ubuntu community team has implemented the following new oppor- tunities to engage the Ubuntu community:   For the Ubuntu Developer Community Ubuntu Packaging Guide: http:  packaging.ubuntu.com  Ubuntu App Developer Web site: http:  developer.ubuntu.com Facebook: www.facebook.com ubuntudev Twitter: www.twitter.com ubuntudev Google +: https:  plus.google.com u 1 107265043789873157543 posts  For the Cloud Community Ubuntu Cloud Web site: www.ubuntu.com cloud Juju Charms: https:  jujucharms.com  Twitter: www.twitter.com ubuntucloud  Local Community Teams Local community teams, affectionately referred to as LoCos in the com- munity, are an extremely important type of team. Each LoCo is responsi- ble for promoting, supporting, and representing Ubuntu in a particular  locale. These locales are usually geographical and frequently countrywide,  although in some situations they may overlap geographically. Ubuntu tries  to encourage LoCos to work together whenever possible.   294   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  LoCos  are  like  Linux  User  Groups   LUGs   and  may  often  work  closely  with or be associated with a LUG. LoCos are often involved in localization  or translations of Ubuntu into local languages and in advocacy in local  schools, public administrations, and communities. The best LoCos meet  regularly for social events, talks, and discussion. Often, they meet for in- stallfests, where team members help new users install Ubuntu onto their  computers. Representatives of LoCos are asked to assist with localization  matters, to speak on behalf of the Ubuntu project at local conferences and  trade shows, and to organize a booth or presence at such events.  Canonical, Ltd., provides each team with a mailing list and a domain name   usually  in  the  form  of  ubuntu- .org,  where  CC  is  the  country’s  two-letter  country  code .  Canonical  also  is  willing  to  host  LoCo  Web  pages, wikis, forums, blogs, download areas, and additional mailing lists.  LoCos are open to participation by anyone.  Want to ﬁ nd a Local Community team near you? All you have to do is go  to the Ubuntu Local Community Team Portal at http:  loco.ubuntu.com   and begin by selecting your region of the world on the map or clicking the  teams tab at the top of the page. Either action will bring up a list of current  LoCo teams.  MOTUs Another very special type of team that deserves an in-depth description in  this book is the MOTU. The MOTUs are the maintainers of Ubuntu’s Uni- verse software package repository, and the acronym stands, jokingly, for  Masters of the Universe. MOTUs call themselves “the brave souls who try  to keep the Universe section of Ubuntu in shape.” They are community  members who spend their time adding, maintaining, and supporting as  much as possible the software found in Universe.   MOTUs are package maintainers. They maintain, as a group, the vast ma- jority of packages in the Ubuntu archive. Several of the packages that have  been well maintained by the MOTUs have, with time, migrated into the  main component and become an ofﬁ cial part of the Ubuntu distribution.  Because Ubuntu does not make support or quality promises regarding the       Teams, Processes, and Community Governance   295  packages in universe, the MOTU team provides a way for maintainers to  sharpen their teeth and  since it’s sometimes unavoidable  make mistakes  before jumping into the higher-responsibility packages in main.  The roles and responsibilities of the MOTUs are many. Some important  ones are that MOTUs    Understand packaging concepts and have substantial experience     uploading packages through a sponsor.    Apply this knowledge by uploading new packages and updating     existing packages in the universe component.     May contribute to the main component in cooperation with a     core developer.   of packaging work.   technical issues.     Answer questions of other developers to expand their understanding       Provide guidance for prospective Ubuntu developers regarding     MOTU contributors are the people who are interested in contributing to  Ubuntu and are learning how to package and work in the Ubuntu devel- opment community. They primarily work by using MOTUs as sponsors  for their work. There are no requirements or exams to pass to become a  MOTU contributor, just a willingness to learn and a commitment to the  Ubuntu  Code  of  Conduct.  Many  of  these  contributors  do  graduate  to  full-ﬂ edged MOTUs, and many MOTUs eventually are granted full-core  developer status. This three-step system is the process by which almost all  new maintainers learn to maintain packages in Ubuntu.  The Community Council The  Community  Council  and  the  Technical  Board  are  the  highest-level  governance structures within Ubuntu. The Community Council, as it per- tains to all Ubuntu members and activities, is arguably the most powerful  team within the Ubuntu project. The Community Council is charged with  supervising the social structures, venues, and processes of the project.   296   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  The Community Council’s day-to-day work involves ﬁ ve major areas in  Ubuntu. The ﬁ rst, and the most straightforward, is the maintenance of the  Ubuntu Code of Conduct. The Community Council is the only body that  can approve revisions to the code. Because the Community Council does  not ask each member to “reagree” to the code when it is changed, each of  these revisions must be fully within the spirit of the previous drafts.   The second charge of the Community Council is the arbitration of dis- putes that cannot be handled within a particular team or that arise be- tween teams. These are generally disputes about the Code of Conduct that  may require clariﬁ cation of a part of the Code of Conduct or a description  of whether any of the code was, in fact, violated by a particular action or  behavior. However, the Community Council’s purview is not limited to  Code of Conduct violations, and the Community Council is available to  handle  disputes  in  any  nontechnical  situation.  In  most  situations,  the  Community Council does not take action against individuals, but rather  helps group members come to agreement or consensus among themselves.  If this fails, the Community Council can ask a maintainer or other mem- ber of the community to apologize and refrain from particular behavior or  to leave the community. The Council promises that no one will be asked to  leave without a substantial review and an opportunity to defend himself  or herself.  A third area of Council work is assisting teams with any blockers they may  encounter in the running of their team. This may include, but is not lim- ited to, assisting with getting access to resources lost due to a contributor  stepping away, moving away blockers that the team may have in the com- munity, and assisting with appointment of new leadership should the need  arise.  To  this  end,  the  Community  Council  works  to  meeting  with  key  teams in the community each cycle during their regular meetings to see if  they can assist the teams in any way.   Fourth, the Community Council is ultimately responsible for approving  and welcoming new members to the project, described in more depth in  the upcoming subsection on membership.  Finally, the Community Council is responsible for all community-related  structures and processes. New types of teams, requirements for member-      Teams, Processes, and Community Governance   297  ship, and core philosophical documents should ﬁ rst be approved by the  Community  Council.  Community  members  who  wish  to  suggest  new  structures  or  processes  can  submit  their  proposal  to  the  Community  Council for discussion and approval.  The Community Council meets twice a month on IRC. Any community  participant can submit an item or proposal for discussion by the Commu- nity Council. Meetings are open to the community, but the Council seeks  only  consensus  or  votes  from  Council  members—although  it  consults  representatives from the team that submitted the proposal and other com- munity members. If an open meeting becomes too noisy, the Council re- serves  the  right  to  moderate  the  channel  so  as  to  regain  order.  Full  transcripts  of  meetings  are  published  following  a  Community  Council  meeting. The current members of the Community Council can always be  found  at  https:  launchpad.net ~communitycouncil.  Appointments  to  the  Council  are  overseen  by  Shuttleworth,  and  a  ﬁ nal  vote  among  all  Ubuntu Members is taken to select nominees from a list. Appointments  last for a period of two years.  The Technical Board The  Ubuntu  Technical  Board  is  responsible  for  the  Ubuntu  project’s  technical  direction.  By  handling  all  technical  matters,  the  Technical  Board complements the Community Council as Ubuntu’s highest rung  of project governance. In particular, the Technical Board is responsible  for three major areas of Ubuntu policy: package policy, release feature  goals, and package selection. Also, the Technical Board is available to ar- bitrate any technical disagreements or issues within or between teams in  a manner similar to the one described earlier in relation to the Commu- nity Council.  The Technical Board’s ﬁ rst responsibility is Ubuntu’s package policy. The  Technical Board maintains the policy document, which describes the pro- cesses and standards to which all Ubuntu packages are held. Since the pol- icy is constantly evolving, each Ubuntu release is associated with a speciﬁ c  version  of  the  Ubuntu  package  policy  as  determined  by  the  Technical  Board.  Any  suggestions  or  proposals  about  policy  are  suggested  to  and  considered by the Technical Board.   298   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  Also, the Technical Board is responsible for maintaining Ubuntu’s feature  goals for each release. During each release cycle, there is a date deﬁ ned as  Feature  Freeze,  after  which  no  new  features  are  added.  The  Technical  Board sets these dates and decides when and if the rules can be bent for a  particular feature or piece of software.  Finally, the Technical Board is responsible for maintaining the list of pieces  of software  i.e., packages  in Ubuntu. In this capacity, the Technical Board  determines which software is installed in the default desktop installation  and which packages qualify for full support as part of the main compo- nent of Ubuntu. Users and developers can propose a particular piece of  software for inclusion in main, the base install, or a desktop install. In all  cases, the ultimate decision will be made by the Technical Board.  Like the Community Council, the Technical Board meets at least twice a  month on IRC. Also like the Community Council, any user can submit an  item or proposal for discussion by the Technical Board prior to the sched- uled meeting. Meetings are open to all interested parties, although deci- sion making and voting are restricted to Technical Board members. Full  transcripts  and  rules  about  noise,  as  they  pertain  to  the  Community  Council, also apply to the Technical Board. You can always ﬁ nd the current  list of the Technical Board members at https:  launchpad.net ~techboard.  Appointments are made by Shuttleworth but are subject to conﬁ rmation  by a vote among the maintainers instead of all members. Appointments  are made for a period of two years.  Other Councils and Boards Ubuntu Forum Council  The Ubuntu Forums  http:  ubuntuforums.org   are led by the Forum Council, which sets rules, manages moderators and  administrators, and can grant Ubuntu Membership to key contributors.   Launchpad team: https:  launchpad.net ~forum-council Wiki page: https:  wiki.ubuntu.com ForumCouncil Mailing list: ubuntu-forums-council@lists.ubuntu.com  Ubuntu IRC Council  The  IRC  Council  is  the  group  that  is  ultimately  responsible for governing the IRC channels and interfacing between IRC       Teams, Processes, and Community Governance   299  and  the  rest  of  the  Ubuntu  community  and  governance  systems.  The  IRC  Council  also  has  the  ability  to  grant  Ubuntu  Membership  to  key  contributors.  Launchpad Team: https:  launchpad.net ~ubuntu-irc-council Wiki page: https:  wiki.ubuntu.com IrcTeam IrcCouncil Mailing list: irc-council@lists.ubuntu.com  Ubuntu LoCo Council  The LoCo Council governs the LoCo community,  makes  decisions  on  resource  allocations,  deals  with  conﬂ ict  resolution,  and makes decisions about where the project should move forward.  Launchpad team: https:  launchpad.net ~ubuntu-lococouncil Wiki page: http:  loco.ubuntu.com loco-council  Mailing list:loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com  Ubuntu  Developer  Membership  Board  The  Ubuntu  Developer  Mem- bership Board is the group responsible for considering and approving ap- plications to become Members of the Ubuntu Core Developer team.  Launchpad team: https:  launchpad.net ~developer-membership-board Wiki page: https:  wiki.ubuntu.com DeveloperMembershipBoard Mailing list: developer-membership-board@lists.ubuntu.com  Ubuntu  Membership  Approval  Board  The  Ubuntu  Membership  Ap- proval Board is made up of a geographically distributed team that is re- sponsible for considering applications for Ubuntu Membership.  Launchpad team: https:  launchpad.net ~ubuntu-membership-board Wiki page: https:  wiki.ubuntu.com Membership Boards Mailing list: ubuntu-membership-boards@lists.ubuntu.com  The Ubuntu ﬂ avors  e.g., Kubuntu, Edubuntu  may also be governed by a  council, but this is determined by each project and may change over time  as the projects change and evolve.  The SABDFL Mark  Shuttleworth  jokingly  refers  to  himself  as  Ubuntu’s  SABDFL— self-appointed  benevolent  dictator  for  life.  He  plays  an  admittedly    300   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  undemocratic role as the sponsor of the Ubuntu project and the founder  of Canonical, Ltd. Shuttleworth has the ability, with regard to Canonical  employees, to ask people to work on speciﬁ c projects, feature goals, and  bugs. He does exactly this.  Shuttleworth also maintains a tie-breaking vote on the Community Coun- cil and has publicly said that he will not use it lightly. In situations where  the boards are split and there is no one “right” answer, the SABDFL will  provide a decision instead of more debate. The SABDFL exists to provide  clear leadership on difﬁ cult issues and to set the pace and direction for the  project. In exchange for this power, he has the responsibility to listen to the  community and to understand that the use of his SABDFL authority can  weaken the project.  Ubuntu Members Membership in the Ubuntu project is one ofﬁ cial way that the project rec- ognizes  sustained  and  signiﬁ cant  contributions.  Ofﬁ cial  Membership  is  available to anyone who has signed the Ubuntu Code of Conduct and has  demonstrated  a  signiﬁ cant  and  sustained  set  of  contributions  to  the  Ubuntu community. These contributions can be of any kind—technical or  nontechnical—but  need  to  be  of  a  form  that  can  be  represented  to  the  Ubuntu Membership Board, under the authority of the Community Coun- cil. The Membership Board before which a candidate appears will consider  each application individually. A non-exhaustive list of some of the types of  contributions that qualify appears in the following section on getting in- volved. The Membership Boards try to be ﬂ exible in the various types of  contributions that will be accepted in consideration of Membership.  Ubuntu Members are responsible for conﬁ rming, by voting, all nomina- tions to the Ubuntu Community Council. They also may be asked by the  Community Council to vote on resolutions put to the general member- ship. In exchange, Members gain the right to an @ubuntu.com e-mail  address and the right to carry Ubuntu business cards. Membership lasts  for  two  years  and  is  self-renewable.  Members  who  fail  to  renew  their  membership will be marked as inactive but, with renewed activity and a  simple procedure that involves approval of the Membership board, can  be easily reactivated.      Getting Involved   301  The process to become a Member is relatively straightforward and is docu- mented  in  depth  at  https:  wiki.ubuntu.com Membership.  Most  impor- tant, it requires that users document their contributions on a wiki page  that includes links to code, mailing list messages, speciﬁ c forms of docu- mentation that clearly demonstrate their involvement, and or other rele- vant material. Membership applications also need to include testimonials  on work and involvement in Ubuntu.  Getting Involved Users can participate in the Ubuntu community on a variety of levels and  in a multitude of ways. The following subsections, adapted largely from a  page with links to relevant resources online on the Ubuntu Web site  http:   community.ubuntu.com contribute ,  provides  a  good  list  of  ways  in  which people can get a running start in the Ubuntu community.  Ubuntu Online Events A series of video-based events are regularly organized by the Ubuntu On  Air! team, which often include interviews and question-and-answer ses- sions with key members of the community. Details about current and up- coming Ubuntu on Air! events can be found at http:  ubuntuonair.com .  Advocacy The easiest way for someone to contribute to the Ubuntu community is  simply by telling others about Ubuntu. Advocacy frequently occurs in a  variety  of  ways.  One  good  method  involves  joining  or  starting  a  LoCo  team. LoCos, described earlier in this chapter, provide a method through  which you can get involved in Ubuntu activities. If users do not have a  LoCo and do not have the critical mass of users to start one, they might  help build support by giving a talk about Ubuntu to a local Linux User  Group or other technical group. Through these and other means, advo- cacy provides a great way to spread the word about Ubuntu and offers a  low-barrier opportunity to make contributions to the community. Many  community  members  share  resources  such  as  ﬂ iers,  posters,  CD  covers,  and banners on the Spread Ubuntu Web site  http:  spreadubuntu.org .  Spread Ubuntu is an ofﬁ cial Ubuntu resource that is community driven    302   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  and  dedicated  to  helping  provide  various  tools  and  resources  to  users,  teams, and community members to aid in advocacy efforts.  Support One of the most meaningful ways that users can contribute to Ubuntu is  by  helping  others  use  the  software.  Users  can  do  this  by  joining  the  support-oriented mailing lists, IRC channels, or forums, as described in  detail earlier in this chapter. By responding to requests for help in each of  these venues, users can help other users get up and running on Ubuntu.  Even if users are themselves beginners, the knowledge they gain in solving  even simple problems enables them to help users who run into the same  issues. Community member Fabián Rodríguez sums this ethos up quite  nicely: “Every user is someone’s guru.”  Ideas and Feedback Another way to contribute to Ubuntu is by helping steer the direction of  the project by describing a vision or providing ideas. This can be done by  participating in discussion and brainstorming sessions at conferences and  on the Ubuntu wiki. By monitoring speciﬁ cations as they are written and  creating  feedback,  especially  at  early  stages,  users  can  make  meaningful  contributions. However, users contributing ideas should remember that  talk is cheap. Users are wise to work with others to help turn their visions  into reality.  Documentation When a user is stumped by a problem, chances are good that other users  will also be frustrated by it. If users are not in a position to write code to  change the situation, they may be able to help others by writing up their  experiences and documenting the solution. Ubuntu has a vibrant docu- mentation team and community, and writing documentation is a great low- barrier way to make meaningful contributions to the Ubuntu community.  Users aiming to contribute to Ubuntu’s documentation would be advised  to take notes as they puzzle through problems and to document solutions  when they ﬁ nd them. Before writing, users should also check to see whether       Getting Involved   303  documentation for a particular problem already exists. When it does, users  would be wise to choose to improve or augment existing documentation  rather than write a new document. Similarly, users can make meaningful  contributions by reading through existing documentation and ﬁ xing fac- tual, technical, stylistic, spelling, and grammar errors. Users who spend a  large amount of time working on documentation may, with time, also want  to join the Ubuntu Documentation Team, which can help organize and co- ordinate this work in terms of Ubuntu documentation goals.  Translation and Localization The discussion of LoCos should have already made it clear that translation  is a great way that anyone with a ﬁ rm understanding of English and an- other  language  can  contribute  to  the  Ubuntu  community.  Translation  tools  described in Chapter 9  allow users to translate as little as a single  string or as much as an entire application. Through its easy interface and  Web-based  nature,  translation  provides  a  low-barrier  road  to  contribu- tion.  Serious  translators  should  join  a  local  community  team  and  the  ubuntu-translators mailing list so that they can stay in touch with other  Ubuntu translators.  Quality Assurance and Bugs Quality assurance  QA  is something for which many companies hire spe- cial engineers. In Ubuntu, the Development Team relies on the Canonical  QA team and the community to test software before it is released to let  developers know about problems so that the bugs can be squashed before  the vast majority of users ever see it. Users can contribute to testing of soft- ware in a variety of ways, from testing the latest builds of ISOs for an up- coming release, to testing packages individually before updates are released  to the wider community.   Trackers for ISOs and packages are available through the Ubuntu Qual- ity team. When users helping out with QA ﬁ nd bugs, they should report  them in the Ubuntu bug-tracking system. They can also help by “triag- ing” bugs, closing or merging duplicates, or verifying bugs and adding  information to a bug’s description. If you intend to become involved in  QA,  you  should  subscribe  to  the  ubuntu-devel-announce  mailing  list    304   Chapter 11       The Ubuntu Community  and the ubuntu-quality mailing list, consider monitoring ubuntu-devel,  and join the ubuntu-quality IRC channel on irc.freenode.net.  Programming and Packaging The  ﬁ nal  way  that  users  can  contribute  to  the  Ubuntu  community  is  through the production of code. Because Ubuntu is free and open source  software, users can get access to every piece of software that Ubuntu sup- ports.  This  allows  users  to  package  additional  software  for  inclusion  in  Ubuntu, to ﬁ x bugs, and to add features. Developers, like people testing  software, should subscribe to the ubuntu-devel-announce mailing list and  should  consider  monitoring  ubuntu-devel,  too.  The  best  way  to  begin  making contributions is then through the MOTU team as a MOTU hope- ful, as described earlier. Users can also look through a list of speciﬁ cations  to ﬁ nd a project that they ﬁ nd personally interesting.  With  the  rise  of  cloud-based  software,  infrastructure  packaging  is  also  available  in  the  form  of  Juju  Charms   https:  jujucharms.com  .  Juju  Charms use the Juju service to specify and orchestrate dependencies and  relationships among speciﬁ c services that run on a server. For instance, a  piece of blogging software may require a Web server and a database; these  can be deﬁ ned in Juju and launched on separate servers or with additional  features, thereby making them highly available.  Summary Ubuntu is a vibrant and diverse community that is active around the world  and in many languages. Its activities happen primarily online in a variety of  virtual venues, including mailing lists, IRC, Web forums, wikis, social me- dia, upstream videocasts, developer and cloud portals, as well as two special  Web-based community portals known as The Fridge and Planet Ubuntu.  Ubuntu complements this virtual activity with real-life meetings and con- ferences. The Ubuntu community is broken down into a variety of teams  and processes. At the top of this government structure is the Ubuntu Com- munity  Council,  the  Technical  Board,  and  SABDFL  Mark  Shuttleworth.  Through a variety of ways, this community is designed to facilitate contri- butions  easily.  Ultimately,  these  contributions  are  recognized  through  a  process culminating in ofﬁ cial project membership and enfranchisement.
