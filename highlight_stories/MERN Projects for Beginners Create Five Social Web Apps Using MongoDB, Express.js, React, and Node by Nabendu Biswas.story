This stack is in high  demand in the startup sector because you can make a fully functional web app using it.  A front-end engineer who knows HTML, CSS, and React can quickly learn Node.js and  MongoDB and build a fully production-ready web app.  In this book, you learn how to host a back end using Node.js code in Heroku. The  front-end site uses React code and Firebase hosting. It is also hosted through a cloud  database called MongoDB Atlas. Most of the hosting setups are the same in the next five  chapters, so it won’t be repeated in most chapters.   The MERN Stack at a Glance Before installing Firebase, let’s discuss the basics of the technologies involved in the  MERN stack.     MongoDB is an open source document based on the NoSQL database.   It is different from traditional relational databases that store data in  tables. It stores data in JSON-like documents. It is highly scalable and  performance-oriented and thus suited for modern-day web apps.     React is the most popular open source JavaScript library for building   a website’s or web app’s front end or user interface. It is developed  and maintained by Facebook.     Node.js lets developers write server-side code using JavaScript. It   integrates very well with React or Angular at the front end and with  MongoDB for databases.     Express is a framework of Node.js, and through it, you can create API   endpoints, which are the basis of any back-end server-side code.    Nabendu Biswas 2021  N.

Install Node.js and npm Let’s go over installing Node.js and npm  node package manager  if they are not already  installed on your system. Most of the code in this book requires Node.js and npm. The  React front-end code also requires Node.js. Through npm, you can install many small  open sourced programs, which adds functionality to both React and Node.js.  When you install Node.js, npm is also automatically installed on your system. The   following instructions are for a Windows-based system, although macOS users can find a  similar guide on the Internet.  In your web browser, enter https:  nodejs.org en download  and click Windows   Installer, as seen in Figure 1-30. Again, it also installs npm.  25   Chapter 1    MerN DeployMeNt Setup  Figure 1-30.

We have also learnt how to deploy  them in different environments and we will be using them in the next chapters.  31   CHAPTER 2  Building a Dating App  with MERN  Welcome to Chapter 2, where you build a dating app using the MERN  MongoDB,  Express, React, Node.js  framework. The back end is hosted in Heroku, and the front-end  site uses Firebase hosting. The icons in the project come from Material-UI.  The web app has simple functionality and is the first MERN stack project. A   screenshot of the finished app, which is deployed in Firebase, is shown in Figure 2-1.   All the data comes from a MongoDB database, with API endpoints set in Node.js.  Figure 2-1.  Finished app    Nabendu Biswas 2021  N. Biswas, MERN Projects for Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7138-4_2  33   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Let’s review the React front end and then move to the back end. Open your terminal  and create a dating-app-mern folder. Inside it, use create-react-app to create a new app  called dating-app-frontend. The following are the commands to do this.  mkdir dating-app-mern cd dating-app-mern npx create-react-app dating-app-frontend   Firebase Hosting Initial Setup Since the front-end site is hosted through Firebase, let’s create the basic setting while  create-react-app creates the React app. Following the same setup instructions in  Chapter 1, I created dating-app-mern in the Firebase console.   React Basic Setup Return to the React project and cd to the dating-app-frontend directory. Start the React  app with npm start.  cd dating-app-frontend npm start  looks on localhost.  Next, let’s delete some of the files that you don’t need. Figure 2-2 shows how the app   34   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Let’s remove all the unnecessary boilerplate code. The index.js file should look like   Figure 2-2.  Delete files  the following.  import React from 'react'; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; import '. index.css'; import App from '. App'; ReactDOM.render               ,   document.getElementById 'root'   ;  35   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  App.js contains only the text Dating App MERN. All the content from the App.css   file has been removed.  import '. App.css';  function App   {   return                Dating App MERN            ; }  export default App;  * {        margin: 0;   }  In index.css, update the CSS to have margin: 0 at the top.  Figure 2-3 shows how the app looks on localhost.  Figure 2-3.  Initial app   Creating a Header Component Let’s create a header component. First, you must install Material-UI  https:  material- ui.com , which provides the icons. You need to do two npm installs, as per the Material- UI documentation. Install the core through the integrated terminal in the dating-app- frontend folder.  npm i @material-ui core @material-ui icons  36   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Next, create a components folder inside the src folder. Create two files—Header.js    and Header.css—inside the components folder. Header.js has three things: a person  icon, a logo, and a forum icon. The logo is taken from the project’s public directory,  which contains the React logo by default.  The following is the Header.js file’s content.  import React from 'react' import '. Header.css' import PersonIcon from '@material-ui icons Person' import IconButton from '@material-ui core IconButton' import ForumIcon from '@material-ui icons Forum'  const Header =    => {     return                                                                                                                                       }  Include the Header component in the App.js file and on localhost. The updated   export default Header  code is marked in bold.  import '. App.css'; import Header from '. components Header';  function App   {   return    37   The Header.css file contains the following content, including simple styles, which   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern                         ; }  export default App;  completes the header.  .header{     display: flex;     align-items: center;     justify-content: space-between;     z-index: 100;     border-bottom: 1px solid f9f9f9; }  .header__logo{     object-fit: contain;     height: 40px; }  .header__icon{     padding: 20px; }  Figure 2-4.  Header component  38  Figure 2-4 shows how the app looks now on localhost.   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern   Creating the Dating Cards Component Let’s now work on the second component. Create two files—DatingCards.js and  DatingCards.css—inside the components folder. Then include the DatingCards  component in the App.js file. The updated code is marked in bold.  import '. App.css'; import Header from '. components Header'; import DatingCards from '. components DatingCards';  function App   {   return                                 ; }  export default App;  npm i react-tinder-card  Before moving forward, you need to install a react-tinder-card package. This   package has a feature that provides the swipe effect.  Next, put the content in DatingCards.js. Here, inside a people state variable, you store   the name and images of four people. Next, import DatingCard and use it as a component.  Here, you use the props mentioned in the react-tinder-card documentation.  The swiped and outOfFrame functions are required. When looping through each   person, use the imgUrl background image and display the name in the h3 tag.  import React, { useState } from 'react' import DatingCard from 'react-tinder-card' import '. DatingCards.css'  const DatingCards =    => {     const [people, setPeople] = useState [  39   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern          { name: "Random Guy", imgUrl: "https:  images.unsplash.com photo-  1520409364224-63400afe26e5?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVu fDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=658&q=80" },          { name: "Another Guy", imgUrl: "https:  images.unsplash.com photo-  1519085360753-af0119f7cbe7?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90b y1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=634&q=80" },          { name: "Random Girl", imgUrl: "https:  images.unsplash.com photo-  1494790108377-be9c29b29330?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90b y1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=634&q=80" },          { name: "Another Girl", imgUrl: "https:  images.unsplash.com photo- 1529626455594-4ff0802cfb7e?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVu fDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=634&q=80" }   ]      const swiped =  direction, nameToDelete  => {         console.log "receiving " + nameToDelete      }     const outOfFrame =  name  => {         console.log name + " left the screen!!"      }     return                                           {people.map  person  =>                       <DatingCard                         className="swipe"                         key={person.name}                         preventSwipe={['up', 'down']}                         onSwipe={ dir  => swiped dir, person.name }                         onCardLeftScreen={   => outOfFrame person.name } >                          <div style={{ backgroundImage: `url ${person.                               {person.name}   imgUrl} `}} className="card">  40   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern                                                                    }                               }  export default DatingCards  Localhost shows four “people,” as seen in Figure 2-5, but you need to style   everything.  Figure 2-5.  All people  Add the first styles in the DatingCards.css file, and make datingCards__container  a flexbox. Next, style each card to contain the image and other things. Note that you are  setting position: relative for each card, which offsets the element relative to itself and  provides width and height.  .datingCards__container{     display: flex;     justify-content: center;     margin-top: 10vh; }  .card{     position: relative;     background-color: white;     width: 600px;     padding: 20px;  41   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern      max-width: 85vw;     height: 50vh;     box-shadow: 0px 18px 53px 0px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.3 ;     border-radius: 20px;     background-size: cover;     background-position: center; }  Figure 2-6 shows how this looks on localhost.  Let’s add three more styles, and out of this swipe is a class within the card class.   Use position: absolute to create the magic of the swipe effect. Add the following  content in the DatingCards.css file.  Figure 2-6.  Images appear  .swipe{     position: absolute; }  42   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  .cardContent{     width: 100%;     height: 100%; } .card h3{     position: absolute;     bottom: 0;     margin: 10px;     color: white; }  The front end is almost complete, as seen in Figure 2-7. It contains the right swipe  and left swipe functionality. Everything is done except the footer, which contains the  swipe buttons.  Figure 2-7.  Almost complete  43   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern   Creating the Swipe Buttons Component Let’s now create the SwipeButtons component, which are the buttons in the footer.  These buttons add to the app’s styling. They won’t be functional since it’s a simple app.  Create two files—SwipeButtons.js and SwipeButtons.css—inside the components  folder. You also need to include it in the App.js file.  The updated content is marked in bold.  import '. App.css'; import Header from '. components Header'; import DatingCards from '. components DatingCards'; import SwipeButtons from '. components SwipeButtons';  function App   {   return                                        ; } export default App;  The content of the SwipeButtons.js file is straightforward. There are five icons from   Material-UI wrapped inside IconButton.  import React from 'react' import '. SwipeButtons.css' import ReplayIcon from '@material-ui icons Replay' import CloseIcon from '@material-ui icons Close' import StarRateIcon from '@material-ui icons StarRate' import FavoriteIcon from '@material-ui icons Favorite' import FlashOnIcon from '@material-ui icons FlashOn' import IconButton from '@material-ui core IconButton' const SwipeButtons =    => {  44   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern      return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   } export default SwipeButtons  Next, style the buttons in the SwipeButtons.css file. First, style the swipeButtons  class and make it flex with position: fixed. In a fixed position, an element remains  attached where stated  at the bottom in this case , even as the user scrolls. You are also  styling the MuiIconButton-root class, which was created by the package. In the SwipeButtons.css file, style each button with a different color.  .swipeButtons{     position: fixed;     bottom: 10vh;     display: flex;     width: 100%;     justify-content: space-evenly; }  45   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  .swipeButtons .MuiIconButton-root{     background-color: white;     box-shadow: 0px 10px 53px 0px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.3  !important; }  .swipeButtons__repeat{     padding: 3vw !important;     color: f5b748 !important; }  .swipeButtons__left{     padding: 3vw !important;     color: ec5e6f !important; }  .swipeButtons__star{     padding: 3vw !important;     color: 62b4f9 !important; }  .swipeButtons__right{     padding: 3vw !important;     color: 76e2b3 !important; }  .swipeButtons__lightning{     padding: 3vw !important;     color: 915dd1 !important; }  Figure 2-8 shows the project on localhost.  46   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Figure 2-8.  Front end complete  Initial Back-End Setup Let’s move to the back end by starting with the Node.js code. Open a new terminal  window and create a new dating-app-backend folder in the root directory. Enter git  init because it is required later for Heroku.  mkdir dating-app-backend cd dating-app-backend git init  Next, create a package.json file by entering the npm init command in the terminal.   You are asked several questions; for most of them, press the Enter key. You can enter a  description and the author, but it is not mandatory. You can generally make the entry  point at server.js because it is the standard  see Figure 2-9 .  47   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Figure 2-9.  Back-end initial setup  Once package.json is created, you need to create the .gitignore file with node_  modules in it since you don’t want to push node_modules to Heroku later. The following is  the content of the .gitignore file.  node_modules  Next, open package.json. The line "type": "module" is required to have React-like   imports enabled in Node.js. These modules are known as ECMA modules. The initial  modules with require statements are known as CommonJS modules. You can read more  about it at https:  blog.logrocket.com how-to-use-ecmascript-modules-with- node-js .  You also need to include a start script to run the server.js file. The updated content   is marked in bold.  48   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  {   "name": "dating-app-backend",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "The dating app backend",   "main": "server.js",   "type": "module",   "scripts": {     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",     "start": "node server.js"   },   "author": "Nabendu Biswas",   "license": "ISC" }  You need to install two packages before starting. Open the terminal and install   Express and Mongoose in the dating-app-backend folder.  npm i express mongoose   MongoDB Setup The MongoDB setup is the same as described in Chapter 1. You need to follow it and  create a new project named dating-app-mern.  Before moving forward, install nodemon in the dating-app-backend folder. Whenever   you make any changes to the code in the server.js file, the Node server restarts  instantaneously.  npm i nodemon   Initial Route Setup Let’s create the initial route, which generally checks whether everything is set up  correctly. The Express package in Node.js allows you to create routes, which is how most  of the Internet works. Most back-end languages like Node.js, Java offer capabilities to  create these routes, which interact with the databases. The initial route doesn’t interact  with the database and simply returns a text when you go to it, using a GET request.   49   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Create a server.js file in the dating-app-backend folder. Here, you import the Express  and the Mongoose packages first. Next, use Express to create a port variable to run on  port 8001.  The first API endpoint is a simple GET request created by app.get  , which shows   Hello TheWebDev text if successful.  Then you listen on port 8001 with app.listen  .  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose'    App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  8001    Middleware    DB Config    API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"      Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    In the terminal, type nodemon server.js. You can see the Listening on localhost:   8001 console log. To check that the route is working correctly, go to http:   localhost:8001  to see the endpoint text  see Figure 2-10 .  Figure 2-10.  Initial route   Database User and Network Access In MongoDB, you need to create a database user and provide network access. The  process is the same as in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions and get the user  credentials and connection URL.  50   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  In server.js, create a connection_url variable and paste the URL within the string   that you got from MongoDB. Enter the password that you saved earlier and provide a  database name. The updated code is marked in bold.  ...   App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  8001 const connection_url = 'mongodb+srv:  admin:yourpassword@cluster0.lggjc. mongodb.net datingDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority'    Middleware    DB Config mongoose.connect connection_url, {     useNewUrlParser: true,     useCreateIndex: true,     useUnifiedTopology: true }     API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    ...   MongoDB Schema and Routes MongoDB stores data in a JSON format instead of the regular table structure found in a  traditional database like Oracle. You create the schema file required by MongoDB. It tells  you how fields are stored in MongoDB.  Here, cards is considered a collection name, and you store a value like cardSchema in   the database. It consists of an object with a name and imgUrl keys. These are the names  that you use in MongoDB. Create a dbCards.js file and put the following content in it.  51   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  import mongoose from 'mongoose' const cardSchema = mongoose.Schema {     name: String,     imgUrl: String }   export default mongoose.model 'cards', cardSchema   You now use the schema to create the endpoint that adds data to the database. The  MVC pattern is followed here; it is the traditional flow of a web application. Read more  about it at https:  medium.com createdd-notes understanding-mvc-architecture- with-react-6cd38e91fefd.  Next, use a POST request that takes any data from the user and sends it to the   database. You can use any endpoint. For example, if you write an article on Facebook  and hit the POST button, your article is saved in the Facebook database once the POST  request is made.  The GET endpoints fetch all the data from the database. Again, you can give any   endpoint. For example, when you browse through the feed in Facebook, a GET request is  sent to the endpoint, which in turn fetches all posts from the Facebook database.  In server.js, create a POST request to the  dating cards endpoint. The load is  in req.body to MongoDB. Then you use create   to send dbCard. If it’s a success, you  receive status 201; otherwise, you receive status 500. The updated content is marked in  bold.  Next, create the GET endpoint to  dating cards to get the data from the database.  You are using find   here and receive a status 200 on success  otherwise, status 500 .  The updated content is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Cards from '. dbCards.js' ...    API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    app.post ' dating cards',  req, res  => {     const dbCard = req.body  52   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern      Cards.create dbCard,  err, data  => {         if err  {             res.status 500 .send err          } else {             res.status 201 .send data          }     }  }   app.get ' dating cards',  req, res  => {     Cards.find  err, data  => {         if err  {             res.status 500 .send err          } else {             res.status 200 .send data          }     }  }     Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    To check the routes, let’s use the Postman app. Download and install it. Send a GET request to http:  localhost:8001 to check that it’s working in   Postman, as seen in Figure 2-11.  53   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Figure 2-11.  Initial route check  Before moving forward with the POST request, you need to complete two things.   First, implement CORS; otherwise, you get cross-origin errors later when you deploy the  app. CORS  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing  is the mechanism that restricts access from  one domain to another. Suppose you are on http:  example.com and want to access  http:  mybank.com accountdetails. CORS won’t allow you to do so. It is only allowed  if http:  mybank.com allows cross-origin sharing with http:  example.com.  Open the terminal and install CORS in the dating-app-backend folder.  npm i cors  In server.js, import CORS and use it in with app.use  . You also need to use the  express.json   middleware. It is required because you need it to parse the incoming  JSON object from MongoDB to read the body.  The updated code is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Cors from 'cors' import Cards from '. dbCards.js'  ...  54   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern    Middleware app.use express.json    app.use Cors     ...  dating cards endpoint.  In Postman, change the request to POST, and then add the http:  localhost:8001   Next, click Body and select raw. Select JSON application json  from the drop-down  menu. In the text editor, copy the data from DatingCards.js file. Make the data JSON by  adding double quotes to the keys.  Next, click the Send button. If everything is correct, you get Status: 201 Created  see   Figure 2-12 .  Figure 2-12.  POST route  You need to test the GET endpoint. Change the request to GET and click the Send   button. If everything is right, you get Status: 200 OK  see Figure 2-13 .  55   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Figure 2-13.  GET route   Integrating the Back End with the Front End Let’s hook the back end to the front end. Use the axios package to call from the front  end. Axios is a JavaScript library that makes the API request to the REST endpoint. You  just created two endpoints in the back end. To access them, you need Axios. Open the  dating-app-frontend folder and install it.  npm i axios  Next, create a new axios.js file inside the components folder, and then create an   instance of axios. The base URL is http:  localhost:8001.  import axios from 'axios' const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: "http:  localhost:8001" }   export default instance  56   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  In DatingCards.js, get rid of the hard-coded stuff in the people state. Then import   the local axios and use the useEffect hook to do the API call to the  dating cards  endpoint. Once you receive the data, reset it using the setPeople   function. The  updated code is marked in bold.  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react' import DatingCard from 'react-tinder-card' import '. DatingCards.css' import axios from '. axios'  const DatingCards =    => {     const [people, setPeople] = useState []      useEffect    => {         async function fetchData   {             const req = await axios.get " dating cards"              setPeople req.data          }         fetchData       }, []       const swiped =  direction, nameToDelete  => {         console.log "receiving " + nameToDelete      } ...  Go to http:  localhost:3000  to see the data. The app is now complete  see    Figure 2-14 .  57   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern  Figure 2-14.  App complete  Deploying the Back End to Heroku Go to www.heroku.com to deploy the back end. You followed the same procedure in  Chapter 1 to create an app named dating-mern-backend.  Return to axios.js and change the endpoint to https:  dating-mern-backend.  herokuapp.com. If everything is working fine, your app should run.  import axios from 'axios' const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: https:  dating-mern-backend.herokuapp.com }   export default instance  58   Chapter 2    Building a dating app with Mern   Deploying the Front End to Firebase It’s time to deploy the front end in Firebase. Follow the same procedure that you did in  Chapter 1. After this process, the site should be live and working properly, as seen in  Figure 2-15.  Figure 2-15.  Deployed app   Summary In this chapter, we have created a dating app in MERN stack. We build the frontend  in ReactJS and hosted it in Firebase.  The backend was build in NodeJS and hosted in  Heroku. The database was build in MongoDB.  59   CHAPTER 3  Building a Short Video  App with MERN  Welcome to your next MERN project, where you build an awesome short video app  using the MERN  MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js  framework. On the back end,  it is hosted in Heroku, and the front-end site uses Firebase hosting. Material-UI   https:  material- ui.com  supplies the icons in the project.  This web app shows short videos stored in MongoDB, which can be played by   clicking on it. You can pause it by clicking it again. This web app also has very smooth  vertical scrolling to show more videos. In Figure 3-1, you can see the final deployed  version of the app.    Nabendu Biswas 2021  N. Biswas, MERN Projects for Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7138-4_3  61   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Figure 3-1.  Deployed version  Work with React first and then move to the back end. Open your terminal and create   a short-video-mern folder. Inside it, use create-react-app to create a new app called  short-video-frontend. The following are the commands.  mkdir short-video-mern cd short-video-mern npx create-react-app short-video-frontend   Firebase Hosting Initial Setup Since the front-end site is hosted through Firebase, you can create the basic setting while  create-react-app creates the React app. Following the setup instructions in Chapter 1,   I created short-video-mern in the Firebase console.  62   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern   React Basic Setup Go back to the React project and cd to the short-video-frontend directory. Start the  React app with npm start.  cd short-video-frontend npm start  The deleting of the files and basic setup in index.js, App.js, and App.css is like   what was done in Chapter 2. Follow those instructions.  Figure 3-2 shows how the app looks on localhost.  Figure 3-2.  Initial app   Creating a Video Component Next, create a components folder inside the src folder. Create two files—Video.js and  Video.css—inside the components folder. In the Video.js file, add a video tag and a  vertical video link. I used the link to my YouTube short video on my channel.  The following is the Video.js content.  import React from 'react' import '. Video.css' const Video =    => {     return                         <video                  src="https:  res.cloudinary.com dxkxvfo2o video upload   v1608169738 video1_cvrjfm.mp4"                  className="video__player"                 loop  63   Include the Video component in the App.js file and on localhost. The updated code   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern              >                               } export default Video  is marked in bold.  import '. App.css'; import Video from '. components Video';  function App   {   return                                                                                  ; }  export default App;  html{     scroll-snap-type: y mandatory; }  .app{     height: 100vh;     background-color: black;  64  Next, put the basic styles in the App.css file, including the styles for scroll-snap-  type, which are for scrolling. You also need to center everything. Next, put some more  styles for the app__videos class and hide the scrollbar.   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern      display: grid;     place-items: center; }  .app__videos{     position:relative;     height: 800px;     border-radius: 20px;     overflow: scroll;     width: 80%;     max-width: 500px;     scroll-snap-type: y mandatory; }  .app__videos::-webkit-scrollbar{     display: none; }  .app__videos{     -ms-overflow-style: none;     scrollbar-width: none; }  Figure 3-3 shows how the app looks on localhost.  65   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Figure 3-3.  Video shown  You need to style the video and video__player classes in the Video.css file also.   You are again using scroll-snap-type here.  .video{     position: relative;     background-color: white;     width: 100%;     height:100%;     scroll-snap-align: start; }  .video__player{     object-fit: fill;     width: 100%;     height: 100%; }  66   The snap feature is done. It smoothly takes you to the next video as you scroll, as  seen in Figure 3-4. Also, the edges have been made perfect on all sides through CSS.  Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Figure 3-4.  Snap feature  Right now, the videos won’t play. To make them play, you must use a reference   or ref . React works on a virtual DOM. Generally, you only need to access the DOM   Document Object Model  in special cases, and you use refs to access DOM elements.  In this case, you need to access the   HTML element so that you can access the  play   and pause   properties, which are only available through refs.  First, import the useRef and useState hooks to get the videoRef variable, which   is used inside the video element, where you create an onClick handler to fire a  handleVideoPress function.  Inside the handleVideoPress function, use the playing state variable to check if the   video plays, and then set it to pause with videoRef.current.pause   and change the  playing state to false. You do the reverse in the else block.  67   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  The updated Video.js content is marked in bold.  import React , { useRef, useState } from 'react' import '. Video.css'  const Video =    => {     const [playing, setPlaying] = useState false      const videoRef = useRef null      const handleVideoPress =    => {         if playing {             videoRef.current.pause               setPlaying false          } else {             videoRef.current.play               setPlaying true          }     }     return                         <video                  src="https:  res.cloudinary.com dxkxvfo2o video upload   v1608169738 video1_cvrjfm.mp4"                  className="video__player"                 loop                 ref={videoRef}                 onClick={handleVideoPress}             >                               }  export default Video  Click the video to play it on localhost. Click it again to pause.  68   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern   Creating a Video Footer Component Let’s work on the second component, which shows the username, video title, and a  rolling ticker in the video’s footer.  Create two files—VideoFooter.js and VideoFooter.css—inside the components   folder. Then include the VideoFooter component in the Video.js file. The updated code  is marked in bold.  import React , { useRef, useState } from 'react' import '. Video.css' import VideoFooter from '. VideoFooter'  const Video =    => {     ...     return                         <video                  src="https:  res.cloudinary.com dxkxvfo2o video upload   v1608169738 video1_cvrjfm.mp4"                  className="video__player"                 loop                 ref={videoRef}                 onClick={handleVideoPress}             >                                             }  export default Video  69   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Next, add an h3 tag containing the username and a p tag containing the description   in the VideoFooter.js file.  import React from 'react' import '. VideoFooter.css'  const VideoFooter =    => {     return                                            @nabendu82                   Macbook Air to new Windows editing beast                                }  export default VideoFooter  Next, style them in the VideoFooter.css file.  .videoFooter{     position: relative;     color: white;     bottom: 150px;     margin-left: 40px;     display: flex; }  .videoFooter__text{     flex: 1; }  .videoFooter__text > h3{     padding-bottom: 20px; }  .videoFooter__text > p{     padding-bottom: 20px; }  70   Figure 3-5 shows the text on localhost.  Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Figure 3-5.  Initial footer  Let’s first install Material-UI, which provides the icons. Do two npm installs as per  the Material-UI documentation. Install the core through the integrated terminal in the  short-video-frontend folder.  npm i @material-ui core @material-ui icons  It’s time to use it in the VideoFooter.js file. Include the music note icon,   MusicNoteIcon, inside the videoFooter__ticker div, which you imported from  Material-UI.  The updated content is marked in bold.  import React from 'react' import '. VideoFooter.css' import MusicNoteIcon from '@material-ui icons MusicNote'  71   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  const VideoFooter =    => {     return                                            @nabendu82                   Macbook Air to new Windows editing beast                                                                                          }  The project features a nice ticker. For this, you install a package called react-ticker   export default VideoFooter  in the short-video-frontend folder.  npm i react-ticker  Next, include the ticker as per the documentation and a record  or rotating disc   image in the VideoFooter.js file. As you can see at the bottom of the news channels,  the ticker is moving text across the screen. A record rotating disc image is also shown, to  which you add nice animations very shortly. The updated content is marked in bold.  import React from 'react' import '.

Here, you align the ticker with the music icon and add animation to move the  recorded image.  Add the following content to the VideoFooter.css file.  .videoFooter__icon{     position: absolute; }  .videoFooter__ticker > .ticker{     height: fit-content;     margin-left: 30px;     width: 60%; }  .videoFooter__record{     animation: spinTheRecord infinite 5s linear;     height: 50px;     filter: invert 1 ;  73   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern      position: absolute;     bottom: 0;     right: 20px; }  @keyframes spinTheRecord {     from {         transform: rotate 0deg      }     to {         transform: rotate 360deg      } }  Figure 3-6 shows the footer component, including a scrolling ticker and rotating disc,   on localhost.  Figure 3-6.  Footer complete 74   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern   Creating a Video Sidebar Component Let’s now create a sidebar component, which shows icons on the right side of the video. Create two files—VideoSidebar.js and VideoSidebar.css—inside the components   folder. You also need to include the Video.js file.   The updated code is marked in bold.  import React , { useRef, useState } from 'react' import '. Video.css' import VideoFooter from '. VideoFooter' import VideoSidebar from '. VideoSidebar'  const Video =    => {     ...     return                         <video                  src="https:  res.cloudinary.com dxkxvfo2o video upload   v1608169738 video1_cvrjfm.mp4"                  className="video__player"                 loop                 ref={videoRef}                 onClick={handleVideoPress}             >                                                           }  export default Video  Next, update the VideoSidebar.js file. Here, you are using different Material-UI   icons. You also use a state variable that saves whether the like icon has been pressed; if  so, it changes from a hollow icon to a filled icon, and the count also changes.  75   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  import React, { useState } from 'react' import '.

Figure 3-7.  Sidebar completed  77   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern   Making Components Dynamic All the data from the App.js file is passed to child components. You make the  components dynamic so that you can pass props to them. Like in React, you pass data  from a parent component to a child component with props. The video sidebar is the first  component to work on. In VideoSidebar.js, pass the numbers as props.

Initial Back-End Setup Let’s move to the back end, starting with the Node.js code. Open a new terminal window  and create a new short-video-backend folder in the root directory. After moving to the  short-video-backend directory, enter the git init command, which is required for  Heroku later.  mkdir short-video-backend cd short-video-backend git init  Next, create the package.json file by entering the npm init command in the   terminal. You are asked a bunch of questions; for most of them, simply press the Enter  key. You can provide the description and the author, but they are not mandatory. You  generally make the entry point at server.js, which is standard  see Figure 3-8 .  81   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Figure 3-8.  Initial server setup  Once package.json is created, you need to create the .gitignore file with node_  modules in it since you don’t want to push node_modules to Heroku later. The following is  the content of the .gitignore file.  node_modules  Next, open package.json. The line "type" : "module" is required to have React-like   imports enabled in Node.js. Include a start script to run the server.js file.  The updated content is marked in bold.  {   "name": "short-video-backend",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": " The short video app backend",   "main": "server.js",  82   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern    "type": "module",   "scripts": {     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",     "start": "node server.js"   },   "author": "Nabendu Biswas",   "license": "ISC" }  You need to install two packages before starting. Open the terminal and install   Express and Mongoose in the short-video-backend folder. As discussed in Chapter 2,  Express is the Node.js framework through which you can easily build back-end code.  Mongoose is the library required to bind Node.js and MongoDB, so it is the bridge  responsible for creating schemas in Node.js code.  npm i express mongoose   MongoDB Setup The MongoDB setup is the same as described in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions  and create a new project named short-video-mern.  Before moving forward, install nodemon in the short-video-backend folder. It helps   the changes in server.js to restart the Node server instantaneously.  npm i nodemon   Initial Route Setup Next, create a server.js file in the short-video-backend folder. Here, you import the  Express and Mongoose packages. Then use Express to create a port variable to run on  port 9000.  The first API endpoint is a simple GET request created by app.get  , which shows   the text Hello TheWebDev if successful.  83   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Then, listen on port with app.listen  .  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose'    App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000    Middleware    DB Config    API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"      Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    In the terminal, type nodemon server.js to see the Listening on localhost: 9000   console log. To check that the route is working correctly, go to http:  localhost:9000   to see the endpoint text, as shown in Figure 3-9.  Figure 3-9.  localhost   Database User and Network Access In MongoDB, you need to create a database user and give network access. The process  is the same as explained in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions, and then get the user  credentials and connection URL.  In server.js, create a connection_url variable and paste the URL within the string  from MongoDB. You need to provide the password that you saved earlier and a database  name.  84   The updated code is marked in bold.  Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern    App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000 const connection_url = ' mongodb+srv:  admin:yourpassword@cluster0.ryj4g. mongodb.net shortVideoDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority'  ...  ...    Middleware    DB Config mongoose.connect connection_url, {     useNewUrlParser: true,     useCreateIndex: true,     useUnifiedTopology: true }     API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"     MongoDB Schema and Routes Next, let’s create the schema file required by MongoDB. It tells you about the way fields  are stored in MongoDB. Create a dbModel.js file inside the short-video-backend folder.  Here, shortVideos is considered a collection name, and you store a value like   shortVideoSchema in the database. It consists of an object with a URL, channel,  description, song, likes, shares, and message keys.  import mongoose from 'mongoose' const shortVideoSchema = mongoose.Schema {     url: String,     channel: String,     description: String,     song: String,     likes: String,  85   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern      shares: String,     messages: String }   export default mongoose.model 'shortVideos', shortVideoSchema   You can now use the schema to create the endpoint that adds data to the database. In server.js, create a POST request to the  v2 posts endpoint. The load is in req.  body to MongoDB. Then use create   to send dbVideos. If it’s a success, you receive  status 201; otherwise, you receive status 500.  Next, create the GET endpoint to  v2 posts to get the data from the database. You   are using find   here. You receive status 200 if successful  otherwise, status 500 .    API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    The updated code is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Videos from '. dbModel.js' ...  app.post ' v2 posts',  req, res  => {     const dbVideos = req.body     Videos.create dbVideos,  err, data  => {         if err              res.status 500 .send err          else             res.status 201 .send data      }  }   app.get ' v2 posts',  req, res  => {     Videos.find  err, data  => {         if err  {             res.status 500 .send err          } else {  86   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern              res.status 200 .send data          }     }  }     Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    To check the routes, let’s use the awesome Postman app. Send a GET request to   http:  localhost:9000 to check if it’s working in Postman  see Figure 3-10 .  Figure 3-10.  Get request  Before moving forward with the POST request, you need to complete two things.   First, implement CORS. Open the terminal and install CORS in the short-video-  backend folder.  npm i cors  87   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  In server.js, import CORS and then use it with app.use  . You also need to use the   express.json   middleware.  The updated code is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Cors from 'cors' import Videos from '. dbModel.js'    Middleware app.use express.json    app.use Cors     ...  ...  v2 posts endpoint.  In Postman, change the request to POST and then add the http:  localhost:9000   Next, click Body and select raw. Select JSON application json  from the drop-   down menu. In the text editor, copy the data from the App.js file. Make the data JSON by  adding double quotes to the keys.  Then, click the Send button. If everything is correct, you get Status: 201 Created, as   seen in Figure 3-11.  88   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Figure 3-11.  Success Message POST  I inserted other data similarly. You need to test the GET endpoint. Change the   request to GET and click the Send button. If everything is correct, you get Status: 200  OK, as seen in Figure 3-12.  89   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  Figure 3-12.  Success Message GET  Integrating the Back End with the Front End Let’s hook the back end to the front end with the axios package. Open the short-video-  frontend folder and install it.  npm i axios  Next, create a new axios.js file inside the components folder and create an instance   of axios. The base URL is http:  localhost:9000.  import axios from 'axios'  const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: "http:  localhost:9000" }   export default instance  90   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  In App.js, import the local axios. Then use the useEffect hook to do the API call to   v2 posts endpoint. Once you receive the data, store it in the videos state variable using  setVideos  .  In the return statement, get rid of the hard-coded stuff. After that, map through the   videos array and pass the props to the video component.  The updated content is marked in bold.  import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; import '. App.css'; import Video from '. components Video'; import axios from '. components axios';  function App   {   const [videos, setVideos] = useState []    useEffect    => {     async function fetchData   {         const res = await axios.get " v2 posts"          setVideos res.data          return res     }     fetchData     }, []     return                          {videos.map  { url, channel, description, song, likes, shares,   messages }  =>                <Video               key={url}               url={url}               channel={channel}               description={description}               song={song}               likes={likes}               shares={shares}               messages={messages}  91   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern               >             }                  ; }  export default App;  You can see the data at http:  localhost:3000 . The app is now complete. But there   is a small issue with the number of likes; it shows 3451 instead of 346  see Figure 3-13 .  This issue occurs because string numbers are being passed from the database. In   VideoSidebar.js, add a + in front of the likes to change the string to a number.  Figure 3-13.  92   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern  ...  '''                                 { liked ?     setLiked false }  > : <FavoriteBorderIcon fontSize="large"  onClick={e => setLiked true }  > }                  {liked ? +likes + 1 : likes}                  Deploying the Back End to Heroku Go to www.heroku.com to deploy the back end. Follow the same procedure that you did  in Chapter 1 and create an app named short-video-backend.  After successfully deploying, go to the link. Figure 3-14 shows the correct text.  Figure 3-14.  In axios.js, change the endpoint to https:  short-video-backend.herokuapp.com.    If everything is working fine, your app should run.  import axios from 'axios' const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: " https:  short-video-backend.herokuapp.com" }  export default instance  93   Chapter 3    Building a Short Video app with Mern   Deploying the Front End to Firebase It’s time to deploy the front end in Firebase. Follow the same procedure that you did in  Chapter 1. After this process, the site should be live and working properly, as seen in  Figure 3-15 .  Figure 3-15.   Summary In this chapter, we have created a short video sharing app. We build the frontend in  ReactJS and hosted it in Firebase. The backend was build in NodeJS and hosted in  Heroku. The database was build in MongoDB.  94   CHAPTER 4  Building a Messaging   App with MERN  Welcome to your third MERN project, where you build an awesome messaging app using  the MERN framework. The back end is hosted in Heroku, and the front-end site is hosted  in Firebase.  Material-UI provides the icons in the project. Pusher is used since MongoDB is not  a real-time database like Firebase and a chat application requires real-time data. It is a  functional chat application with Google authentication so that different users can log  in with their Google accounts to chat. Figure 4-1 shows a fully functional hosted and  finished app.    Nabendu Biswas 2021  N. Biswas, MERN Projects for Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7138-4_4  95   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-1.  Final hosted app  Go to your terminal and create a messaging-app-mern folder. Inside it, use the   create-react-app to create a new app called messaging-app-frontend.  mkdir messaging-app-mern cd messaging-app-mern npx create-react-app messaging-app-frontend   Firebase Hosting Initial Setup Since the front-end site is hosted through Firebase, you can create the basic setting while  create-react-app creates the React app. Following the setup instructions from Chapter 1,  I created messaging-app-mern in the Firebase console.  96   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern    React Basic Setup Let’s return to the React project and cd to the messaging-app-frontend directory. Start  the React app with npm start.  cd messaging-app-frontend npm start  The deleting of the files and basic setup in index.js, App.js, and App.css is like   what was done in Chapter 2. Follow those instructions.  Figure 4-2 shows how the app looks on localhost.  Figure 4-2.  Initial app   Creating a Sidebar Component Let’s create a sidebar component that shows the avatar of the logged-in user and other  icons, including a search bar. Before creating the sidebar component, add the basic  styles in the App.js file. In App.js, create an app__body class that contains all the code.  The updated content is marked in bold.  import '. App.css';  function App   {   return                                   ; }  export default App;  97   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Next, style the container in App.css to get a centered container with a box-shadow.  .app{     display: grid;     place-items: center;     height: 100vh;     background-color: dadbd3; }  .app__body{     display: flex;     background-color: ededed;     margin-top: -50px;     height: 90vh;     width: 90vw;     box-shadow: -1px 4px 20px -6px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.75 ; }  Go to localhost. You should see the big shadow box shown in Figure 4-3.  98   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-3.  Initial background  Next, create a components folder inside the src folder. Then create two files—  Sidebar.js and Sidebar.css—inside the components folder. Put the content in the  Sidebar.js file. The following is the content for the Sidebar.js file.  import React from 'react' import '. Sidebar.css'  const Sidebar =    => {     return                                                                          }  export default Sidebar  99   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Next, install Material-UI  https:  material- ui.com  to get the icons. Do two   npm installs according to the Material-UI documentation. Install the core through the  integrated terminal in the messaging-app-frontend folder.  npm i @material-ui core @material-ui icons  Next, let’s use these icons in the Sidebar.js file. Import them and then use them   inside the sidebar__header class. The updated content is marked in bold.  import React from 'react' import '.

SidebarChat'  const Sidebar =    => {     return                                          ...                                            ...                                                                                                            }  export default Sidebar  .sidebar__chats{     flex: 1;     background-color: white;     overflow: scroll; }  Before coding the sidebar chat component, let’s style the sidebar__chats div, which   contains the SidebarChat component in the Sidebar.css file. Add this new content to  the existing content.  105   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   In the SidebarChat.js file, there is a simple, functional component. An API   endpoint provides random avatars if you pass random stings to it. The seed state variable  is used; it changes each time with a random string from within useEffect.  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react' import { Avatar } from '@material-ui core' import '. SidebarChat.css'  const SidebarChat =    => {     const [seed, setSeed] = useState ""       useEffect    => {         setSeed Math.floor Math.random   * 5000       }, []       return                          <Avatar src={`https:  avatars.dicebear.com api human    b${seed}.svg`}  >                                 Room name                   Last message...                                }  export default SidebarChat  a flexbox and a bit of padding.  .sidebarChat{     display: flex;     padding: 20px;     cursor: pointer;     border-bottom: 1px solid f6f6f6; }  106  Next, let’s style the rooms a bit in the SidebarChat.css file. Here, you are again using    Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   .sidebarChat:hover{     background-color: ebebeb; } .sidebarChat__info > h2 {     font-size: 16px;     margin-bottom: 8px; } .sidebarChat__info {     margin-left: 15px; }  Figure 4-6 shows the sidebar chat component on localhost.  Figure 4-6.  Sidebar chat  107   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern    Creating a Chat Component Let’s start working on the chat component. Create two files—Chat.js and Chat.css— inside the components folder. Put this basic structure in the Chat.js file. Random strings  are used to show a random avatar icon.  import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react' import { Avatar, IconButton } from '@material-ui core' import { AttachFile, MoreVert, SearchOutlined } from '@material-ui icons' import '. Chat.css'  const Chat =    => {     const [seed, setSeed] = useState ""      useEffect    => {         setSeed Math.floor Math.random   * 5000       }, []       return                                            <Avatar src={`https:  avatars.dicebear.com api human   b${seed}.svg`}  >                                         Room Name                       Last seen at...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        108   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Next, style the chat header in the Chat.css file, and add a nice background image to                                                 }  export default Chat  the chat__body class.  .chat{     display: flex;     flex-direction: column;     flex: 0.65; }  .chat__header{     padding: 20px;     display: flex;     align-items: center;     border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; }  .chat__headerInfo {     flex: 1;     padding-left: 20px; }  .chat__headerInfo > h3 {     margin-bottom: 3px;     font-weight: 500; }  .chat__headerInfo > p {     color: gray; } .chat__body{     flex: 1;  109   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern        background-image: url "https:  user-images.githubusercontent.com    15075759 28719144-86dc0f70-73b1-11e7-911d-60d70fcded21.png" ;  Render the chat component from the App.js file.

Note the chat__receiver class for the chat user. The updated content is marked    in bold.  ... const Chat =    => {     const [seed, setSeed] = useState ""      useEffect    => {         setSeed Math.floor Math.random   * 5000       }, []       return                            111   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern                 ...

Chat messages   Creating a Chat Footer Component Let’s complete the chat__footer div. There are two more icons and an input box inside a  form. The updated code for Chat.js is marked in bold.  ... import { AttachFile, MoreVert, SearchOutlined, InsertEmoticon } from   '@material-ui icons' import MicIcon from '@material-ui icons Mic' import '. Chat.css' ... const Chat =    => { ...     return    114   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern                                         ...                                           ...                                                                                     <input                         placeholder="Type a message"                         type="text"                      >                      Send a message                                                                    }  export default Chat  It’s time to style the chat__footer div. Note display: none for the button. Since it is  wrapped in a form, you can use enter in it. Add the following content in the Chat.css file.  .chat__footer{     display: flex;     justify-content: space-between;     align-items:center;     height: 62px;     border-top: 1px solid lightgray; }  115   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   .chat__footer > form {     flex: 1;     display: flex; }  .chat__footer > form > input {     flex: 1;     outline-width: 0;     border-radius: 30px;     padding: 10px;     border: none; }  .chat__footer > form > button {     display: none; }  .chat__footer > .MuiSvgIcon-root {     padding: 10px;     color: gray; }  Figure 4-9 shows the footer on localhost.  116   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-9.  Footer complete  Initial Back-End Setup Let’s move to the back end, starting with the Node.js code. Open a new terminal window  and create a new messaging-app-backend folder in the root directory. After moving to  the messaging-app-backend directory, enter the git init command, which is required  for Heroku later.  mkdir messaging-app-backend cd messaging-app-backend git init  Next, create the package.json file by entering the npm init command in the   terminal. You are asked a bunch of questions; for most of them, simply press the Enter  key. You can provide the description and the author, but they are not mandatory. You  generally make the entry point at server.js, which is standard  see Figure 4-10 .  117   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-10.  Initial back-end setup  Once package.json is created, you need to create the .gitignore file with node_  modules in it since you don’t want to push node_modules to Heroku later. The following  is the .gitignore file content.  node_modules  Next, open package.json. The line "type": "module is required to have React-like   imports enabled in Node.js. Include a start script to run the server.js file. The updated  content is marked in bold.  {   "name": "messaging-app-backend",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "Messaging app backend",   "main": "server.js",  118   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern     "type": "module",   "scripts": {     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",     "start": "node server.js"   },   "author": "Nabendu Biswas",   "license": "ISC" }  Finally, you need to install two packages before starting. Open the terminal and   install Express and Mongoose in the messaging-app-backend folder.  npm i express mongoose   MongoDB Setup The MongoDB setup is the same as described in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions  and create a new project named messaging-app-mern.  Before moving forward, install nodemon in the messaging-app-backend folder. It   helps the changes in server.js to restart the Node server instantaneously.  npm i nodemon   Initial Route Setup Create a server.js file in the messaging-app-backend folder, where you import the  Express and Mongoose packages. Then use Express to create a port variable to run on  port 9000.  The first API endpoint is a simple GET request created by app.get  , which shows   the text Hello TheWebDev if successful.  Then, listen on port with app.listen  .  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose'    App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000  119   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern     Middleware    DB Config    API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"      Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    In the terminal, type nodemon server.js to see the Listening on localhost: 9000   console log. To check that the route is working correctly, go to http:  localhost:9000   to see the endpoint text, as shown in Figure 4-11.  Figure 4-11.  Initial route   Database User and Network Access In MongoDB, you need to create a database user and give network access. The process  is the same as explained in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions, and then get the user  credentials and connection URL.  In the server.js file, create a connection_url variable and paste the URL within the   string from MongoDB. You need to provide the password that you saved earlier and a  database name.  The updated code is marked in bold.    App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000 const connection_url = ' mongodb+srv:  admin: @cluster0.ew283. mongodb.net messagingDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority'  ...    Middleware    DB Config  120   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   mongoose.connect connection_url, {     useNewUrlParser: true,     useCreateIndex: true,     useUnifiedTopology: true }     API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    ...   MongoDB Schema and Routes Let’s now create the schema file required by MongoDB. It tells you about the way fields  are stored in MongoDB. Create a dbMessages.js file inside the messaging-app-backend  folder.  Here, messagingmessages is considered a collection name, and you store a value  like messagingSchema in the database. It consists of an object with a message, name,  timestamp, and received keys.  import mongoose from 'mongoose' const messagingSchema = mongoose.Schema {     message: String,     name: String,     timestamp: String,     received: Boolean }   export default mongoose.model 'messagingmessages', messagingSchema   You can now use the schema to create the endpoint that adds data to the database. In server.js, create a POST request to the  messages new endpoint. The load is  in req.body to MongoDB. Then use create   to send dbMessage. If it’s a success, you  receive status 201; otherwise, you receive status 500.  Next, create the GET endpoint to  messages sync to get the data from the database.   You are using find   here. You receive status 200 if successful  otherwise, status 500 .  121   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   The updated code is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Messages from '. dbMessages.js' ...   API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    app.post ' messages new',  req, res  => {     const dbMessage = req.body     Messages.create dbMessage,  err, data  => {         if err              res.status 500 .send err          else             res.status 201 .send data      }  }   app.get ' messages sync',  req, res  => {     Messages.find  err, data  => {         if err  {             res.status 500 .send err          } else {             res.status 200 .send data          }     }  }     Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    To check the routes, use the Postman app. Download it and install it. Send a GET request to http:  localhost:9000 to check if it’s working from   Postman, as seen in Figure 4-12.  122   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-12.  Initial GET request  Before moving forward with the POST request, you need to complete two things.   First, implement CORS; otherwise, you get cross-origin errors when you deploy the app.  Open the terminal and install CORS in the messaging-app-backend folder.  npm i cors  In server.js, import CORS and then use it with app.use  . You also need to use the   express.json   middleware. The updated code is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Cors from 'cors' import Messages from '. dbMessages.js'  ...  123   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern     Middleware app.use express.json    app.use Cors     ...  In Postman, you need to change the request to POST and then add the http:    localhost:9000 messages new endpoint.  Next, click Body and select raw. Select JSON application json  from the drop-down   menu. In the text editor, enter the data as shown in Figure 4-13. Make the data JSON by  adding double quotes to the keys.  Next, click the Send button. If everything is correct, you get Status: 201 Created, as   seen in Figure 4-13.  Figure 4-13.  POST request  124   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   I similarly inserted other data, but with received as true. You need to test the GET    messages sync endpoint. Change the request to GET and click the Send button. If  everything is correct, you get Status: 200 OK, as seen in Figure 4-14.  Figure 4-14.  GET request  Sometimes you get a server error with POST requests. The error is   UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: MongooseServerSelectionError: connection.  If you get this error, go to your Network Access tab, and click the ADD IP ADDRESS  button. After that, click the ADD CURRENT IP ADDRESS button, and then click  Confirm, as seen in Figure 4-15.  125   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-15.  Network error fix  Configuring Pusher Since MongoDB is not a real-time database, it’s time to add a pusher to the app to get  real-time data. Go to https:  pusher.com and sign up. The Pusher app dashboard is  shown in Figure 4-16. Click the Manage button.  126   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-16.  Pusher dashboard  On the next screen, click the Create app button, as seen in Figure 4-17.  127   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-17.  Create app in Pusher  In the popup window, name the app messaging-app-mern. The front end is React,   and the back end is Node.js, as seen in Figure 4-18.  128   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-18.  Front end and back end  In the next screen, you get the code for both the front end and the back end of   Pusher, as seen in Figure 4-19.  129   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-19.  Back-end code   Adding Pusher to the Back End As explained in the previous section, you need to stop the server and install Pusher. In  the messaging-app-backend folder, install it with the following command.  In the server.js file, import it and then use the Pusher initialization code. Get the   initialization code from the Pusher website  https:  pusher.com . To add the code,  open a database connection with db.once. Then watch the message collection from  MongoDB with watch  .  npm i pusher  130   Inside changeStream, if operationType is inserted, you insert the data in the pusher.   The updated code is marked in bold.  Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   ... import Pusher from 'pusher' ...   App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000 const connection_url = ' mongodb+srv:  admin: @cluster0.ew283. mongodb.net messagingDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority' const pusher = new Pusher {     appId: "11xxxx",     key: "9exxxxxxxxxxxxx",     secret: "b7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",     cluster: "ap2",     useTLS: true } ;    API Endpoints const db = mongoose.connection db.once "open",    => {     console.log "DB Connected"      const msgCollection = db.collection "messagingmessages"      const changeStream = msgCollection.watch       changeStream.on 'change', change => {         console.log change          if change.operationType === "insert"  {             const messageDetails = change.fullDocument             pusher.trigger "messages", "inserted", {                 name: messageDetails.name,                 message: messageDetails.message,                 timestamp: messageDetails.timestamp,                 received: messageDetails.received             }   131   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern           } else {             console.log 'Error trigerring Pusher'          }     }  }   app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"      Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    To test this, you need to send a POST request from Postman. At the same time, you   need to be in the Debug console in Pusher.  Figure 4-20 shows the message displayed in the Debug console log.  Figure 4-20.  Message in Pusher  In the server, the console logs show the same, as seen in Figure 4-21.  ...  132   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-21.  Server logs   Adding Pusher to the Front End It’s time to move back to the front end and use Pusher. First, you need to install the  pusher-js package in the messaging-app-frontend folder.  npm i pusher-js  Use the following code and insert the new data in the front end in the App.js file.   The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react' import Pusher from 'pusher-js'  function App   {   const [messages, setMessages] = useState []     useEffect    => {     const pusher = new Pusher '9exxxxxxxxxxxx', {       cluster: 'ap2'     } ;      const channel = pusher.subscribe 'messages' ;     channel.bind 'inserted',  data  => {  133   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern         setMessages [...messages, data]      } ;      return    => {       channel.unbind_all         channel.unsubscribe       }   }, [messages]     console.log messages     return               ...          ; }  export default App;  console log on localhost.  134  Go to Postman and send another POST request. Figure 4-22 shows the data from the    Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-22.  Console log   Integrating the Back End with the Front End You want to get all the messages when the app initially loads, and then push the  messages. You must hit the GET endpoint, and you need Axios for that. Open the  messaging-app-frontend folder and install it.  npm i axios  Next, create a new axios.js file inside the components folder and create an instance   of axios. The base URL is http:  localhost:9000.  import axios from 'axios'  const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: "http:  localhost:9000" }   export default instance  135   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Next, return to App.js and include the local axios first. Then use axios in the   useEffect hook to get all the data from the  messages sync endpoint. After receiving  the messages, you set it through setMessages  . Finally, pass the messages as props to  the chat component.

If you post a new message through   Postman, you get it in the chat, as seen in Figure 4-23.  137   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern   Figure 4-23.  New messages  Add the logic to POST directly from the message box. First, import the local axios   and then create an input state variable.  Then do the value and onChange React thing on input and attach a sendMessage   function to the onClick event handler of the button.  Inside the sendMessage function, do a POST call to the  messages new endpoint with   the required data.

After clicking the username, you see all the information about the  logged-in user in the console, as seen in Figure 4-36.  154   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern    Using Redux and Context API Let’s dispatch the user data into the data layer, and here the Redux Context API comes  into play.  Figure 4-36.  Google authentication success  You want the user information to be stored in a global state. First, create a new   StateProvider.js file. Use the useContext API to create a StateProvider function. The  following is the content. You can learn more about the useContext hook in my React  hooks YouTube video at www.youtube.com watch?v=oSqqs16RejM.  import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from "react"  export const StateContext = createContext    export const StateProvider =  { reducer, initialState, children }  =>    155   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern                 {children}          export const useStateValue =    => useContext StateContext   Next, create a reducer.js file inside the components folder. This is a concept similar  to the reducer in a Redux component. You can learn more about it at www.youtube.com  watch?v=m0G0R0TchDY. The following is the content.  export const initialState = { user: null }  export const actionTypes = {     SET_USER: "SET_USER" }  const reducer =  state, action  => {     console.log action      switch action.type  {         case actionTypes.SET_USER:             return {                 ...state,                 user: action.user             }         default:             return state     } }  export default reducer  In the index.js file, wrap the app component with the StateProvider component   after importing the required files.

App complete   Deploying the Back End to Heroku Go to www.heroku.com to deploy the back end. Follow the same procedure that you did  in Chapter 1 and create an app named messaging-app-backend.  After successfully deploying, go to https:  messaging- app- backend.herokuapp.com.    Figure 4-41 shows the correct text.  Figure 4-41.  Initial route check  166   In axios.js, change the endpoint to https:  messaging- app- backend.herokuapp.  com. If everything is working fine, your app should run.

Follow the same procedure that you did in  Chapter 1. After this process, the site should be live and working properly, as seen in  Figure 4-42.  Figure 4-42.  Final app  167   Chapter 4    Building a Messaging app with Mern    Summary In this chapter, you created a simple but functional chat app. Firebase hosted it on the  Internet. You learned to add Google authentication, by which you can log in with a  Google account. You also learned to store the chats in a MongoDB database with API  routes created using Node.js.  168   CHAPTER 5  Building a Photo-Based  Social Network with MERN  In this chapter, you are going to build an awesome photo-based social network using the  MERN framework. The back end is hosted in Heroku, and the front-end site is hosted  using Firebase. The authentication functionality is also handled by Firebase.  Material-UI provides the icons in the project. Pusher is used since MongoDB is not a  real-time database like Firebase. You want the posts to reflect the moment someone hits  the Submit button.  With this functional photo-based social network, you can upload pictures from your  computer and write a description. The user login is through email. The final hosted app  is shown in Figure 5-1.

Final app  First, go to your terminal and create a photo-social-mern folder. Inside, it uses the  create-react-app to create a new app called photo-social-frontend. The following are  the commands.  mkdir photo-social-mern cd photo-social-mern npx create-react-app photo-social-frontend   Firebase Hosting Initial Setup Since the front-end site is hosted through Firebase, you can create the basic setting while  create-react-app creates the React app. Following the setup instructions from Chapter 1,  I created photo-social-mern in the Firebase console.  170   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Since authentication functionality is used, you need to do the additional configuration  mentioned in Chapter 4 and use firebaseConfig, which you need to copy  see Figure 5-2 .  Figure 5-2.  Config  Open the code in Visual Studio Code  VSCode  and create a firebase.js file inside   the src folder and paste the config content there.  const firebaseConfig = {     apiKey: "AIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxY",     authDomain: "photo-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.com",     projectId: "photo-xxxxxxxxxxx",     storageBucket: "photo-xxxxxxxxxxxx",     messagingSenderId: "52xxxxxxx",     appId: "1:52xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" };  171   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern   React Basic Setup Return to the React project and cd to the photo-social-frontend directory. Start the  React app with npm start.  cd photo-social-frontend npm start  The deleting of the files and basic setup in index.js, App.js, and App.css is like  what was done in Chapter 2. Follow those instructions. Figure 5-3 shows how the app  looks on localhost.  Figure 5-3.  Initial app   Creating a Header Component Let’s create the app header, which is a nice logo. In the App.js file, create a div with the  app__header class name and use the React logo from the public folder, which comes  with every React project. The updated content is marked in bold.  import '. App.css';  function App   {   return                                            ; }  export default App;  172   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Next, start writing styles in the App.css file. Here, you are writing styles for the app,   app__header, and the app__headerImage class.  .app {   background-color: fafafa; }  .app__header{   background-color: white;   padding: 20px;   border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;   object-fit: contain; }  .app__headerImage {   object-fit: contain;   margin-left: 10px;   height: 40px; }  Figure 5-4 shows the logo on localhost.  Figure 5-4.  Perfect logo   Creating a Post Component Let’s now create the post component, which contains the logged-in user’s avatar,  including a photo and a brief description. Create a components folder inside the src  folder. Then, create two files—Post.js and Post.css—inside the components folder. The Post.js file is a simple functional component that contains the username,   image, and post.  173   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  import React from 'react' import '. Post.css' const Post =    => {     return                          TWD               <img className="post__image" src="https:  www.techlifediary. com wp-content uploads 2020 06 react-js.png" alt="React"  >                 thewebdev 🔥Build a   Messaging app with MERN  MongoDB, Express, React JS, Node JS    🔥                   }  export default Post  marked in bold.  In the App.js file, include the Post component three times. The updated content is   import '. App.css'; import Post from '. components Post';  function App   {   return                                                                         ; }  export default App;  174   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  The icons come from Material-UI  https:  material- ui.com . First, do two npm   installs as per the documentation. Install the core through the integrated terminal in the  photo-social-frontend folder.  npm i @material-ui core @material-ui icons  In Post.js, add an avatar icon from Material-UI. You are using it along with the h3   tag inside a post__header div. The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import { Avatar } from '@material-ui core'  const Post =    => {     return                                          <Avatar                     className="post__avatar"                     alt="TWD"                     src=" static images avatar 1.jpg"                  >                  TWD                             <img className="post__image" src="https:  www.techlifediary. com wp-content uploads 2020 06 react-js.png" alt="React"  >              ...                 }  export default Post  175   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Next, add the styles in the Post.css file.  .post {     background-color: white;     max-width: 800px;     border: 1px solid lightgray;     margin-bottom: 45px; } .post__image {     width: 100%;     object-fit: contain;     border-top: 1px solid lightgray;     border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray; } .post__text {     font-weight: normal;     padding: 20px; }  .post__header {     display: flex;     align-items: center;     padding: 20px; } .post__avatar {     margin-right: 10px; }  Figure 5-5 shows how the app now looks on localhost.  176   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-5.  Styled post   Making Components Dynamic Let’s make everything dynamic and pass the username, caption, and image URL as  props. In Post.js, make the following changes. The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import { Avatar } from '@material-ui core'  const Post =  { username, caption, imageUrl }  => {     return                                          <Avatar                     className="post__avatar"                     alt= {username}  177   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern                      src=" static images avatar 1.jpg"                  >                   {username}                                             {username}    {caption}                   }  export default Post  Next, let’s optimize the code in App.js. Here, you use the useState hook to create   new state posts. The posts here are objects inside an array.  Inside the return statement, map through the posts array and show each post. The   updated content is marked in bold.  ... import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';  function App   {   const [posts, setPosts] = useState [     {       username: "TWD",        caption: "🔥Build a Messaging app with MERN Stack🔥",         imageUrl: "https:  www.techlifediary.com wp-content uploads 2020 06   react-js.png"      },     {       username: "nabendu82",       caption: "Such a beautiful world",        imageUrl: "https:  quotefancy.com media wallpaper 3840x2160 126631-   Charles- Dickens-Quote-And-a-beautiful-world-you-live-in-when-it-is.jpg"       }   ]    return    178   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern                                          {posts.map post =>                <Post username={post.username} caption={post.caption}   imageUrl={post.imageUrl}  >            }          ; }  export default App;  Figure 5-6 shows it on localhost.  Figure 5-6.  Everything dynamic  179   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern   Firebase Authentication Setup Let’s work on the Firebase authentication, which allows you to log in to the app and  post. This project uses email-based authentication, which is different from the Google  authentication in the previous chapter.  You need to return to Firebase. Click the Authentication tab and then the Get   started button, as seen in Figure 5-7.  Figure 5-7.  Get started  On the next screen, click the Edit icon for Email Password, as seen in Figure 5-8.  180   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-8.  Email and password  In the popup window, click the Enable button, and then click the Save button, as   seen in Figure 5-9.  181   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-9.  Enable email and password   Creating a Modal for Signup Now, let’s show a sign-up modal from Material-UI . The code for this is from https:   material- ui.com components modal modal.  First, import several dependencies and two styles in the App.js file. After that you   have the constant of classes and modalStyle. The open state is initially set to false.  Inside return, set the open state to true for the modal and sign-up button . The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import { makeStyles } from '@material-ui core styles'; import Modal from '@material-ui core Modal'; import { Button, Input } from '@material-ui core'; function getModalStyle   {   const top = 50;   const left = 50;   return {     top: `${top}%`,     left: `${left}%`,  182   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern      transform: `translate -${top}%, -${left}% `,   }; } const useStyles = makeStyles  theme  =>  {   paper: {     position: 'absolute',     width: 400,     backgroundColor: theme.palette.background.paper,     border: '2px solid 000',     boxShadow: theme.shadows[5],     padding: theme.spacing 2, 4, 3 ,   }, }  ;  function App   {   const classes = useStyles  ;   const [modalStyle] = React.useState getModalStyle ;   const [open, setOpen] = useState false    ...   return                 setOpen false }>                      Modal Code                           ...          setOpen true }>Sign Up          {posts.map post =>                <Post ={post.username} caption={post.caption} imageUrl={post.  imageUrl}  >            }          ; }  export default App;  183   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  On localhost, click the SIGN UP button to get the modal with text  see Figure 5-10 .  Figure 5-10.  Modal popup  Before creating the form, you need to create three state variables—username, email,   and password—in the App.js file.  Fields for the username, email, and password are inside the modal in the App.js file.   There is also a button that includes an onClick handler calling a signUp function.  The updated content is marked in bold.  ...  184  function App   {  ...   const [username, setUsername] = useState ''    const [email, setEmail] = useState ''    const [password, setPassword] = useState ''    Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern    ...   const signUp = e => {     e.preventDefault     }    return                 setOpen false }>                                                        <img className="app__headerImage" src="logo192.png"          alt="Header"  >                                  <Input placeholder="username"                   type="text"                   value={username}                   onChange={e => setUsername e.target.value }                  >                 <Input placeholder="email"                   type="text"                   value={email}                   onChange={e => setEmail e.target.value }                  >                 <Input placeholder="password"                   type="password"                   value={password}                   onChange={e => setPassword e.target.value }                  >                  Sign Up                                   185   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern         ...        ...          ; }  export default App;  In the App.css file, add styles for the app__signup class.  .app__signup {   display: flex;   flex-direction: column; }  Figure 5-11 shows that clicking the SIGN UP button on localhost opens a form.  Figure 5-11.  Sign-up form  186   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern   Sign up with Firebase Let’s start with the Firebase setup for authentication. First, install all dependencies for  Firebase in the photo-social-frontend folder.  Next, update the firebase.js file to use the config to initialize the app. The updated   npm i firebase  content is marked in bold.  import firebase from 'firebase';  const firebaseConfig = {     ... };  const firebaseApp = firebase.initializeApp firebaseConfig  const db = firebaseApp.firestore   const auth = firebase.auth   const storage = firebase.storage    export { db, auth, storage }  Let’s add authentication to the app. First, import auth from the local Firebase, and   then add a new user state variable in the App.js file.  Add code to the signUp function that uses createUserWithEmailAndPassword from   Firebase and passes the email and password. After that, update the user and set the  displayName as the username. Use the useEffect hook to monitor any user changes,  and use setUser   to update the user variable.  Inside the return, check if the user is logged in and then show either the Log out   button or the Sign up button.  The updated content is marked in bold.  import { auth } from '. firebase' ...  function App   {  ...   const [user, setUser] = useState null    ...  187   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern    useEffect    => {     const unsubscribe = auth.onAuthStateChanged authUser => {       if authUser  {         console.log authUser          setUser authUser        } else {         setUser null        }     }      return    => {       unsubscribe       }   }, [user, username]    const signUp =  e  => {     e.preventDefault       auth.createUserWithEmailAndPassword email, password        .then authUser => authUser.user.updateProfile { displayName: username }         .catch error => alert error.message        setOpen false    }   return                 setOpen false }>...         ...         {user ?   auth.signOut  }>Logout  :     setOpen true }>Sign Up }  The authentication is working properly on localhost. You can sign up a new user, as         ...          ; }  export default App;  seen in Figure 5-12.  188   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-12.  User sign-up   Sign in with Firebase Now let’s work on the sign-in functionality by creating a new sign-in button and a new  modal component in the App.js file.  First, create the openSignIn state variable and function in the App.js file. The   function contains signInWithEmailAndPassword from Firebase.  Note that only email and a password are used, but there is a new openSignIn state   variable and its setOpenSignIn setter. The updated content is marked in bold.  ... function App   {  ...   const [openSignIn, setOpenSignIn] = useState false   189   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  ...   const signIn = e => {     e.preventDefault       auth.signInWithEmailAndPassword email, password        .catch error => alert error.message       setOpenSignIn false    }    return                 setOpen false }>...          setOpenSignIn false }>                                                    <img className="app__headerImage" src="logo192.png"   alt="Header"  >                              <Input placeholder="email" type="text" value={email}                 onChange={e => setEmail e.target.value }   >                <Input placeholder="password" type="password"   value={password}                  onChange={e => setPassword e.target.value }   >                Sign In                                       ...        {user ?   auth.signOut  }>Logout  :                              setOpenSignIn true }>Sign In                setOpen true }>Sign Up                       }}       ...        190   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern     ; }  export default App;  There is a new SIGN IN button on localhost. It opens a popup window to enter   credentials  see Figure 5-13 . Use the same credentials that you entered for the SIGN IN  button, and you can log in successfully.  Figure 5-13.  Sign-in popup   Adding Posts and Images The Firebase user authentication is complete. Add the code for the posts and upload the  images. You return to this part once you start the back end.  191   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Create new files—ImageUpload.js and ImageUpload.css—inside the components   folder and import them into the App.js file. Next, pass the prop username from  ImageUpload in the App.js file.  In App.js, create a new div with an app__posts class name, and contain the posts in   it. The updated content of the App.js file is marked in bold.  ... import ImageUpload from '. components ImageUpload'; ... function App   { ...   return                 ...         {user ?   auth.signOut  }>Logout  :              ...          }                     {posts.map post =>                  <Post username={post.username} caption={post.caption}   imageUrl={post.imageUrl}  >              }                    {user?.displayName ?   :    Need to login to upload }  In the ImageUpload.js file, start with the basic content. There is an input box for the   caption and another for the image. There is also a button and a progress bar.  The following is the content of the ImageUpload.js file.           ; }  export default App;  192   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  import React, { useState } from 'react' import '.

First, add   styles in the ImageUpload.css file. The following is the content for this file.  193   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  .imageUpload {     display: flex;     flex-direction: column;     max-width: 800px;     width: 100%;     margin: 10px auto; }  .imageUpload__progress{     width: 100%;     margin-bottom: 10px; }  .imageUpload__input{     padding: 10px;     margin-bottom: 10px; }  .imageUpload__file {     margin-bottom: 10px; }  .imageUpload__button {     border: none;     color: lightgray;     background-color: 6082a3;     cursor: pointer;     padding: 10px;     font-weight: bolder;     font-size: 0.9rem; }  .imageUpload__button:hover {     color: 6082a3;     background-color: lightgray; }  Figure 5-14 shows the image upload on localhost.  194   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-14.  Image upload  Add the styles in the App.css file. The updated code is marked in bold. It keeps the   existing code for app__signup and app__headerImage.  .app {   display:grid;   place-items: center;   background-color: fafafa; }  .app__header{   display: flex;   justify-content: space-between;   position: sticky;   top: 0;   z-index: 1;   width: 100%;   background-color: white;   padding: 20px;   border-bottom: 1px solid lightgray;   object-fit: contain; }  .app__notLogin{   margin-bottom: 20px; }  195   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  .app__loginContainer{   margin-right: 10px; }  .app__posts {   padding: 20px; }  There is a small fix in App.js to move the user code inside the app__header div. The   updated code is marked in bold.  ... function App   { ...   return               ...                           {user ?   auth.signOut  }>Logout  :                            setOpenSignIn true }>Sign In                setOpen true }>Sign Up                       }              ...          ; }  export default App;  Figure 5-15 shows the app in desktop view on localhost.  196   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-15.  Front-end complete   Initial Back-End Setup Let’s move to the back end, starting with the Node.js code. Open a new terminal window  and create a new photo-social-backend folder in the root directory. After moving to the  photo-social-backend directory, enter the git init command, which is required for  Heroku later.  mkdir photo-social-backend cd photo-social-backend git init  197   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Next, create the package.json file by entering the npm init command in the   terminal. You are asked a bunch of questions; for most of them, simply press the Enter  key. You can provide the description and the author, but they are not mandatory. You  generally make the entry point at server.js, which is standard  see Figure 5-16 .  Figure 5-16.  Initial back end  Once package.json is created, you need to create the .gitignore file with node_  modules in it since you don’t want to push node_modules to Heroku later. The following  is the .gitignore file content.  Next, open package.json. The line “type”: “module is required to have React-like   imports enabled in Node.js. Include a start script to run the server.js file. The updated  content is marked in bold.  node_modules  198   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  {   "name": "messaging-app-backend",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "Messaging app backend",   "main": "server.js",   "type": "module",   "scripts": {     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",     "start": "node server.js"   },   "author": "Nabendu Biswas",   "license": "ISC" }  Finally, you need to install two packages before starting. Open the terminal, and   install Express and Mongoose in the photo-social-backend folder.  npm i express mongoose   MongoDB Setup The MongoDB setup is the same as described in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions  and create a new project named photo-social-mern.  Before moving forward, install nodemon in the photo-social-backend folder. It helps   the changes in server.js to restart the Node server instantaneously.  npm i nodemon   Initial Route Setup Create a server.js file in the photo-social-backend folder. Here, you import the  Express and Mongoose packages. Then use Express to create a port variable to run on  port 9000.  The first API endpoint is a simple GET request created by app.get  , which shows   the text Hello TheWebDev if successful.  Then listen on port with app.listen  .  199   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose'    App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000    Middleware    DB Config    API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"      Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    In the terminal, type nodemon server.js to see the Listening on localhost: 9000   console log. To check that the route is working correctly, go to http:  localhost:9000   to see the endpoint text, as shown in Figure 5-17.  Figure 5-17.  Initial route   Database User and Network Access In MongoDB, you need to create a database user and give network access. The process  is the same as explained in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions, and then get the user  credentials and connection URL.  In the server.js file, create a connection_url variable and paste the URL within the   string from MongoDB. You need to provide the password that you saved earlier and a  database name.  The updated code is marked in bold.  200   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern    App Config const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000 const connection_url = ' mongodb+srv:  admin: @cluster0.giruc. mongodb.net photoDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority'  ...  ...    Middleware    DB Config mongoose.connect connection_url, {     useNewUrlParser: true,     useCreateIndex: true,     useUnifiedTopology: true }     API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"     MongoDB Schema and Routes Let’s create the model for the post. Create a postModel.js file inside the   photo-social- backend folder.  First, create a schema with the required parameters to be passed, and then export it.  import mongoose from 'mongoose'  const postsModel = mongoose.Schema {     caption: String,     user: String,     image: String }   export default mongoose.model 'posts', postsModel   201   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  You now use the schema to create the endpoint that adds data to the database. In server.js, create a POST request to the  upload endpoint. The load is in   req.body to MongoDB. Then use create   to send dbPost. If it’s a success, you   receive status 201; otherwise, you receive status 500.  Next, create the GET endpoint to  sync to get the data from the database. You are   using find   here. You receive status 200 if successful  otherwise, status 500 .    API Endpoints app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    The updated code is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Posts from '. postModel.js' ...  app.post ' upload',  req, res  => {     const dbPost = req.body     Posts.create dbPost,  err, data  => {         if err              res.status 500 .send err          else             res.status 201 .send data      }  }   app.get ' sync',  req, res  => {     Posts.find  err, data  => {         if err  {             res.status 500 .send err          } else {             res.status 200 .send data          }     }  }     Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    202   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Before moving forward with the POST request, you need to complete two things.   First, implement CORS; otherwise, you get cross-origin errors later when you deploy the  app. Open the terminal and install CORS in the photo-social-backend folder.  npm i cors  In server.js, import CORS and then use it with app.use  . You also need to use the   express.json   middleware. The updated code is marked in bold.  import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import Cors from 'cors' import Posts from '. postModel.js'    Middleware app.use express.json    app.use Cors     ...  ...  In Postman, you need to change the request to POST and then add the http:    localhost:9000 upload endpoint.  After that, click Body and then select raw. Change to JSON  application json  from  drop-down menu. In the text editor, enter the data as shown in Figure 5-18. One thing to  change is to make the data JSON by adding double quotes to keys also.  Next, click the Send button. If everything is correct, you get Status: 201 Created, as   seen in Figure 5-18.  203   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-18.  Postman POST  I inserted other data in a similar way. You need to test the GET  sync endpoint.   Change the request to GET and click the Send button. If everything is correct, you get  Status: 200 OK, as seen in Figure 5-19.  204   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-19.  Postman GET  Sometimes you get an error in the server while POST requests. The error is   UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: MongooseServerSelectionError: connection. If you get this error, go to your Network Access tab, and click the ADD IP ADDRESS  button. After that, click ADD CURRENT IP ADDRESS button, and click Confirm, as seen  in Figure 5-20.  205   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-20.  Add current IP   Integrating the Back End with the Front End You want to get all the messages when the app initially loads, and then push the  messages. You need to hit the GET endpoint, and for that you need Axios. Open the  photo-social-frontend folder and install it.  Next, create a new axios.js file inside the src folder and then create an instance of   axios. The base URL is http:  localhost:9000.  npm i axios  206   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  import axios from 'axios'  const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: "http:  localhost:9000" }   export default instance  In the ImageUpload.js file, import storage from Firebase and Axios. Update   handleUpload  , which fires after you click the Upload button.  First, take the uploaded image path in the uploadTask variable and put it in the  database. Check state_changed because the snapshot changes. Depending on how  much hass uploaded, update the progress bar in setProgress.  After that, you need to do error management. Get the image URL from Firebase. Next, take the caption, username, and URL and do an axios.post to  upload to push   it in MongoDB.  The updated code is marked in bold.  ... import { storage } from ".. firebase"; import axios from '.. axios' const ImageUpload =  { username }  => {     ...     const [url, setUrl] = useState "" ;     const handleChange = e => {...}     const handleUpload =    => {         const uploadTask = storage.ref `images ${image.name}` .put image ;         uploadTask.on              "state_changed",              snapshot  => {                 const progress = Math.round                       snapshot.bytesTransferred   snapshot.totalBytes  * 100                  ;                 setProgress progress ;             },  207   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern               error  => {                 console.log error ;             },                => {                 storage                     .ref "images"                      .child image.name                      .getDownloadURL                       .then  url  => {                         setUrl url ;                         axios.post ' upload', {                             caption: caption,                             user: username,                             image: url                         }                          setProgress 0 ;                         setCaption "" ;                         setImage null ;                     } ;             }          ;     };     return  ...  }  export default ImageUpload  208  You need to set up storage in the Firebase console before testing. First, click the   Storage tab and then the Get started button, which opens the popup window shown in  Figure 5-21. Then, click the Next button.   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-21.  Firebase storage  On the next screen, click the Done button, as shown in Figure 5-22.  209   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-22.  Cloud storage  Go to localhost, upload any images, enter captions, and hit the Upload button. You   can see the post being saved to MongoDB  see Figure 5-23 .  210   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-23.  MongoDB save  In App.js, you need to fetch the posts from MongoDB. First, import the local axios.   Then create a new useEffect hook and make the GET request to the  sync endpoint.  Next, update App.js with the data you received from MongoDB. The updated code is marked in bold.  ... import axios from '. axios' ... function App   {   ...   const fetchPosts = async    => {     await axios.get " sync" .then response => setPosts response.data     }  211   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern    useEffect    => {     fetchPosts     },[]    ...   return                 ...                     {posts.map post =>               <Post               key={post._id}               username={post.user}               caption={post.caption}               imageUrl={post.image}              >             }                   ...          ; }  export default App;  Figure 5-24 shows the post from the MongoDB database on localhost.  212   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-24.  Post from MongoDB   Configuring Pusher Since MongoDB is not a real-time database, it’s time to add a pusher to the app to  get real-time data. Since you already did the setup in Chapter 4, follow the same  instructions, and create an app named photo-social-mern.   Adding Pusher to the Back End Again, you need to stop the server and install Pusher. In the photo-social-backend  folder, install it with the following command.  npm i pusher  213   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  In the server.js file, import it and then use the Pusher initialization code. Get the   initialization code from the Pusher website  https:  pusher.com . To add the code,  open a database connection with db.once. Then watch the message collection from  MongoDB with watch  .  Inside changeStream, if operationType is inserted, you insert the data in the pusher.   The updated code is marked in bold.  ... import Pusher from 'pusher' ...   App Config ... const pusher = new Pusher {     appId: "11xxxx",     key: "9exxxxxxxxxxxxx",     secret: "b7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",     cluster: "ap2",     useTLS: true } ;    API Endpoints mongoose.connect connection_url, {  ...}   mongoose.connection.once 'open',    => {     console.log 'DB Connected'      const changeStream = mongoose.connection.collection 'posts' .watch       changeStream.on 'change', change => {         console.log change          if change.operationType === "insert"  {             console.log 'Trigerring Pusher'              pusher.trigger 'posts','inserted', {                 change: change            }          } else {             console.log 'Error trigerring Pusher'          }     }  }   214   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"   ...   Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    To test this, you need to upload a new image from the front end. At the same time,   you need to be in the Debug console in Pusher.  Figure 5-25 shows the message displayed in the Debug console log.  Figure 5-25.  Pusher log   Adding Pusher to the Front End It’s time to move to the front end and use Pusher. First, you need to install the pusher-js  package in the photo-social-frontend folder.  npm i pusher-js  215   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Get the code from www.pusher.com to put in the front end of the app. Import Pusher   and then use the code in the App.js file, where you have a new useEffect   hook for  Pusher. The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import Pusher from 'pusher-js'  const pusher = new Pusher '56xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx', {   cluster: 'ap2' } ;  function App   {   ...   const fetchPosts = async    => {     await axios.get " sync" .then response => setPosts response.data     }    useEffect    => {     const channel = pusher.subscribe 'posts' ;     channel.bind 'inserted',  data  => {       fetchPosts       } ;   }, []     useEffect    => {     fetchPosts     },[]    ...   return               ...          ; }  export default App;  216  Go to Postman and send another POST request. You see the data from the console log  on localhost. The app is complete. Whenever you post something, it is shown in real time.   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern   Hiding Secrets You can hide the secrets before deploying the app to Heroku or pushing it to GitHub,  which is a best practice. Install dotenv in the photo-social-backend folder using the  following command.  npm i dotenv  Then create an .env file in the photo-social-backend folder and add all secrets to it.  DB_CONN='mongodb+srv:  admin: @cluster0.giruc.mongodb.net photoDB? retryWrites=true&w=majority' PUSHER_ID="11xxxx" PUSHER_KEY="56xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" PUSHER_SECRET="90xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  In server.js, import dotenv and then use the values from it in place of all secrets.  ... import Posts from '. postModel.js' import dotenv from 'dotenv';    App Config dotenv.config   const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000 const connection_url = process.env.DB_CONN  const pusher = new Pusher {     appId: process.env.PUSHER_ID,     key: process.env.PUSHER_KEY,     secret: process.env.PUSHER_SECRET,     cluster: "ap2",     useTLS: true } ;    Middleware ...  217   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Add the .env file in the .gitignore file in the back end. The updated content is   marked in bold.  node_modules .env   Deploying the Back End to Heroku Go to www.heroku.com to deploy the back end. Follow the same procedure that you did  Chapter 1 and create an app named photo-social-backend.  Since you have environment variables this time, you must add them in Settings ➤  Config Vars. Note that you don’t put any quotes around the keys, as seen in Figure 5-26.  Figure 5-26.  Environment variables in Heroku  218   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  After successfully deploying, go to https:  photo- social- backend.herokuapp.com.   Figure 5-27 shows the correct text.  Figure 5-27.  Back end deployed  Go to axios.js and change the endpoint to https:  photo- social- backend.  herokuapp.com. If everything is working fine, your app should run.  import axios from 'axios' const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: " https:  photo-social-backend.herokuapp.com " }   export default instance   Deploying the Front End to Firebase It’s time to deploy the front end in Firebase. Follow the same procedure that you did in  Chapter 1. After this process, the site should be live and working properly, as seen in  Figure 5-28.  219   Chapter 5    Building a photo-Based soCial network with Mern  Figure 5-28.  Final app   Summary In this chapter, you created a simple but functional photo-based social network. Firebase  hosted it on the Internet. You learned to add email authentication, by which you can log  in with email. You also learned how to store images in Firebase and store links to images  and posts in a MongoDB database with API routes created using Node.js.  220   CHAPTER 6  Build a Popular Social  Network with MERN  Welcome to the final MERN project, where you build an awesome popular social  network using the MERN framework. The back end is hosted in Heroku, and the front-  end site is hosted in Firebase. Firebase also handles the authentication functionality.  Material-UI provides the icons in this project. You also use styled components and CSS.  Pusher is used since MongoDB is not a real-time database like Firebase, and you   want the posts to reflect the moment someone hits the submit.  In this project, you build a social media app that has Google authentication. The   app’s look and feel are similar to a popular social network. In it, you can post an image  along with descriptive text. The final hosted app is shown in Figure 6-1.    Nabendu Biswas 2021  N. Biswas, MERN Projects for Beginners, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-7138-4_6  221   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Figure 6-1.  Final app  Go to your terminal and create a popular-social-mern folder. Inside it,    use create- react- app to create a new app called popular-social-frontend. The  commands are as follows.  mkdir popular-social-mern cd popular-social-mern npx create-react-app popular-social-frontend   Firebase Hosting Initial Setup Since the front-end site is hosted through Firebase, you can create the basic setting while  create-react-app creates the React app. Following the setup instructions from Chapter 1,  I created popular-social-mern in the Firebase console.  Since you also are using authentication functionality, you need to do the additional  configuration mentioned in Chapter 4 and get firebaseConfig, which you need to copy.  222   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Open the code in Visual Studio Code  VSCode  and create a firebase.js file inside   the src folder and paste the config content there.  const firebaseConfig = {     apiKey: "AIxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxY",     authDomain: "popular-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.com",     projectId: "popular-xxxxxxxxxxx",     storageBucket: "popular-xxxxxxxxxxxx",     messagingSenderId: "19xxxxxxx",     appId: "1:59xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" };   React Basic Setup Go back to the React project and cd to the popular-social-frontend directory. Then,  start the React app with npm start.  cd popular-social-frontend npm start  The deleting of the files and basic setup in index.js, App.js, and App.css is like  what was done in Chapter 2. Follow those instructions. Figure 6-2 shows how the app  looks on localhost.  Figure 6-2.  Initial app   Adding a Styled Component You are going to use the famous CSS-in-JS library styled-components    https:  styled-components.com  to style the project. This is one of the most popular  alternative ways to use CSS in React projects. Open the integrated terminal and install it  in the popular- social- frontend folder.  npm i styled-components  223   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Then, import the styled components in the App.js file. In place of the div, there is the  AppWrapper component. You style AppWrapper after the function. The updated content is  marked in bold.  import styled from 'styled-components'  function App   {   return                Popular Social Network MERN           ; }  const AppWrapper = styled.div`   background-color: f1f2f5; ` export default App;   Creating a Header Component Let’s create a component that displays a nice header in the app. To do this, create a  components folder inside the src folder, and then create a Header.js file inside the  components folder.  The icons are from Material- UI  https:  material- ui.com . You need to do two  npm installs, and then install the core and the icons in the popular-social-frontend  folder.  npm i @material-ui core @material-ui icons  A lot of code is placed in Header.js, but it is mainly static code and uses Material UI   icons. Note that styled components are used in all the files.  The styled components are like SCSS, where you can nest the internal div inside the   parent element. For example, the HeaderCenter styled component contains styles for the  header__option div. Also, note that pseudo-elements like hover are given by &:hover.  224   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  import React from 'react' import styled from 'styled-components' import SearchIcon from '@material-ui icons Search' import HomeIcon from '@material-ui icons Home' import FlagIcon from '@material-ui icons Flag' import SubscriptionsOutlinedIcon from '@material-ui icons  SubscriptionsOutlined' import StorefrontOutlinedIcon from '@material-ui icons StorefrontOutlined' import SupervisedUserCircleIcon from '@material-ui icons  SupervisedUserCircle' import { Avatar, IconButton } from '@material-ui core' import AddIcon from '@material-ui icons Add' import ForumIcon from '@material-ui icons Flag' import NotificationsActiveIcon from  '@material-ui icons  NotificationsActive' import ExpandMoreIcon from '@material-ui icons ExpandMore'  const Header =    => {     return                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        225   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN                                                                                                                                                                                         <Avatar src="https:  pbs.twimg.com profile_  images 1020939891457241088 fcbu814K_400x400.jpg "  >                      Nabendu                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          }  const HeaderWrapper = styled.div`         display: flex;         padding: 15px 20px;         justify-content: space-between;         align-items: center;         position: sticky;  226   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN          background-color: white;         z-index: 100;         top: 0;         box-shadow: 0px 5px 8px -9px rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.75 ;     `  const HeaderLeft = styled.div`         display: flex;         justify-content: space-evenly;         img {             height: 40px;         }     `  const HeaderInput = styled.div`         display: flex;         align-items: center;         background-color: eff2f5;         padding: 10px;         margin-left: 10px;         border-radius: 33px;         input {             border: none;             background-color: transparent;             outline-width: 0;         }     ` const HeaderCenter = styled.div`         display: flex;         flex: 1;         justify-content: center;         .header__option{             display: flex;             align-items: center;             padding: 10px 30px;             cursor: pointer;  227   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN              .MuiSvgIcon-root{                 color: gray;             }             &:hover{                 background-color: eff2f5;                 border-radius: 10px;                 align-items: center;                 padding: 0 30px;                 border-bottom: none;                 .MuiSvgIcon-root{                     color: 2e81f4;                 }             }         }          .header__option--active{             border-bottom: 4px solid 2e81f4;             .MuiSvgIcon-root{                 color: 2e81f4;             }         }     ` const HeaderRight = styled.div`         display: flex;         .header__info {             display: flex;             align-items: center;             h4 {                 margin-left: 10px;             }         }     ` export default Header  228   Include the Header component in the App.js file.

Posts shown   Google Authentication Setup Let’s work on the Google authentication, which allows you to log in to the app and post.  Here, you use the process from Chapter 4 and add it to the Firebase console.  Inside the firebase.js file, initialize the app and use auth, provider and the   database. The updated content is marked in bold.  import firebase from 'firebase' const firebaseConfig = {    ... }; const firebaseApp = firebase.initializeApp firebaseConfig  const db = firebaseApp.firestore   const auth = firebase.auth   const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider    250   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  export { auth, provider } export default db  npm i firebase  You also need to install all dependencies for Firebase in the terminal. But make sure   you are in the popular-social-frontend folder.   Creating a Login Component Let’s create a Login.js file inside the components folder. The Login.js file is a simple,  functional component showing a logo and a sign-in button. As before, you are using  styled components.  import React from 'react' import styled from 'styled-components' import { Button } from '@material-ui core'  const Login =    => {     const signIn =    => {}     return                                                              Popular Social                             <Button type='submit' className="login__btn"   onClick={signIn}>Sign In                   }  const LoginWrapper = styled.div`     display: grid;     place-items: center;     height: 100vh;     .login__logo {         display: flex;  251   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN          flex-direction: column;         img {             object-fit: contain;             height: 150px;             max-width: 200px;         }     }     .login__btn {         width: 300px;         background-color: 2e81f4;         color: eff2f5;         font-weight: 800;         &:hover {             background-color: white;             color: 2e81f4;         }     } ` export default Login  ... import { useState } from 'react' import Login from '. components Login'  function App   {   const [user, setUser] = useState null     return               {user ?                                                         252  Next, show the Login component if there is no current user. You create a temporary   state variable to show it in the App.js file. The updated content is marked in bold.   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN                                     :                    }          ; } const AppWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default App;  Figure 6-11 shows the login screen on localhost.  Figure 6-11.  Login screen  253   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  In the Login.js file, you need to import auth, provider from the local Firebase   file. Then use a signInWithPopup   method to get the results. The updated content is  marked in bold.  ... import { Button } from '@material-ui core' import { auth, provider } from '.. firebase'  const Login =    => {     const signIn =    => {         auth.signInWithPopup provider              .then result => console.log result               .catch error => alert error.message       }     return  ...  } const LoginWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default Login  Click the SIGN IN button on localhost, and a Gmail authentication window pops up.  After clicking the Gmail username, you see all the logged-in user details in the console,  as seen in Figure 6-12.  254   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Figure 6-12.  Login details  Using Redux and Context API Let’s dispatch the user data into the data layer, and here the Redux Context API comes  into play.  You want the user information to be stored in a global state. First, create a new   StateProvider.js file. Use the useContext API to create a StateProvider function.  The following is the content. Again, learn more about the useContext hook in my React  hooks YouTube video at www.youtube.com watch?v=oSqqs16RejM.  import React, { createContext, useContext, useReducer } from 'react' export const StateContext = createContext    export const StateProvider =  { reducer, initialState, children }  =>                 {children}         export const useStateValue =    => useContext StateContext   255   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Next, create a Reducer.js file inside the src folder. This is a concept similar to the   reducer in a Redux component. Again, you can learn more about it at www.youtube.com  watch?v=m0G0R0TchDY.  export const initialState = {     user: null, }  export const actionTypes = {     SET_USER: 'SET_USER' }  const reducer =  state, action  => {     console.log action      switch  action.type  {         case actionTypes.SET_USER:             return {                 ...state,                 user: action.user             }         default:             return state     } }  export default reducer  In the index.js file, wrap the app component with the StateProvider component   after importing the required files. The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import { StateProvider } from '. StateProvider'; import reducer, { initialState } from '.

Here, useStateValue is a custom hook. The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import { auth, provider } from '.. firebase' import { useStateValue } from '.. StateProvider' import { actionTypes } from '.. Reducer'  const Login =    => {     const [{}, dispatch] = useStateValue        const signIn =    => {         auth.signInWithPopup provider              .then result => {                 console.log result                  dispatch {                     type: actionTypes.SET_USER,                     user: result.user                 }              }              .catch error => alert error.message       }      return  ...  } const LoginWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default Login  Return to the App.js file and use the useStateValue hook. Extract the global user   from it and base it on your login. The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import { useStateValue } from '. StateProvider';  257   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  function App   {   const [{ user }, dispatch] = useStateValue     return  ... ; }  const AppWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default App;  If you sign in on localhost, it takes you to the app, as seen in Figure 6-13.  Figure 6-13.  Logged in   Using Redux Data in Other Components You have access to the user’s data, so you can use it anywhere. Let’s use the user’s Google  image as the avatar and the Google username instead of the hard-coded one in the  Header.js file. The updated content is marked in bold.  258   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  ... import { useStateValue } from '.. StateProvider'  const Header =    => {     const [{ user }, dispatch] = useStateValue        return                         ...                          ...                                                                                          {user.displayName}                               ...                               }  const HeaderWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default Header  ... import { useStateValue } from '.. StateProvider'  const Messenger =    => {     const [input, setInput] = useState ''      const [image, setImage] = useState null      const [{ user }, dispatch] = useStateValue           ...     return                            Also, use the user’s Google image as the avatar in the Messenger.js file.  259   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN                                              ...                                                      ...                               }  const MessengerWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default Messenger  The Sidebar.js file includes the user’s username and an avatar.  ... import { useStateValue } from '.. StateProvider'  const Sidebar =    => {     const [{ user }, dispatch] = useStateValue        return                                        <SidebarRow Icon={LocalHospitalIcon} title="COVID-19   Information Center"  >                 ...                 }  const SidebarWrapper = styled.div` ` export default Sidebar  localhost.  260  Figure 6-14 shows the user’s Google image and username in all the correct places on    Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Figure 6-14.  Login details   Initial Back End Setup Let’s move to the back end, starting with the Node.js code. Open a new terminal window  and create a new photo-social-backend folder in the root directory. After moving to the  photo-social-backend directory, enter the git init command, which is required for  Heroku later.  mkdir popular-social-backend cd popular-social-backend git init  Next, create the package.json file by entering the npm init command in the   terminal. You are asked a bunch of questions; for most of them, simply press the Enter  key. You can provide the description and the author, but they are not mandatory. You  generally make the entry point at server.js, which is standard  see Figure 6-15 .  261   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Figure 6-15.  Initial back-end setup  Once package.json is created, you need to create the .gitignore file with node_  modules in it since you don’t want to push node_modules to Heroku later. The following  is the .gitignore file content.  node_modules  Next, open package.json. The line "type": "module is required to have React-like   imports enabled in Node.js. Include a start script to run the server.js file. The updated  content is marked in bold.  {   "name": "popular-social-backend",   "version": "1.0.0",   "description": "Popular Social App Backend",   "main": "server.js",   "type": "module",   "scripts": {     "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",  262   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN      "start": "node server.js"   },   "author": "Nabendu Biswas",   "license": "ISC" }  You need to install some packages before starting. Open the terminal and install  cors, express, gridfs-stream, mongoose, multer, multer-gridfs-storage, nodemon,  path, body-parser, and pusher in the popular-social-backend folder.  npm i body-parser cors express gridfs-stream mongoose multer multer-gridfs-  storage nodemon path pusher   MongoDB Setup The MongoDB setup is the same as explained in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions  and create a new project named popular-social-mern.   Initial Route Setup Create a server.js file in the photo-social-backend folder. Here, you import the Express  and Mongoose packages. Then use Express to create a port variable to run on port 9000. The first API endpoint is a simple GET request created by app.get  , which shows   the text Hello TheWebDev if successful.  Then listen on port 9000 with app.listen  .    imports import express from 'express' import mongoose from 'mongoose' import cors from 'cors' import multer from 'multer' import GridFsStorage from 'multer-gridfs-storage' import Grid from 'gridfs-stream' import bodyParser from 'body-parser' import path from 'path' import Pusher from 'pusher'  263   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN    app config Grid.mongo = mongoose.mongo const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000    middleware app.use bodyParser.json    app.use cors       DB Config    api routes app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"      listen app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    In the terminal, type nodemon server.js to see the Listening on localhost: 9000   console log. To check that the route is working correctly, go to http:  localhost:9000   to see the endpoint text, as seen in Figure 6-16.  Figure 6-16.  Route test   Database User and Network Access In MongoDB, you need to create a database user and give network access. The process  is the same as explained in Chapter 1. Follow those instructions, and then get the user  credentials and connection URL.  In the server.js file, create a connection_url variable and paste the URL within the   string from MongoDB. You need to provide the password that you saved earlier and a  database name.  The updated code is marked in bold.    imports ...  264   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN    app config Grid.mongo = mongoose.mongo const app = express   const port = process.env.PORT  9000 const connection_url =  'mongodb+srv:  admin: @cluster0.quof7. mongodb.net myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority'    middleware ...   Storing Images in MongoDB You are using GridFS to store the images. You installed it earlier through the multer-  gridfs- storage package. The gridfs-stream package is responsible for reading and  rendering to the user’s stream.  Two connections are used in the project. The first one is for image upload, and the  second one does other GET and POSTs. The updated code in server.js is marked in  bold.  ...   middleware app.use bodyParser.json    app.use cors       DB Config const connection = mongoose.createConnection connection_url, {     useNewUrlParser: true,     useCreateIndex: true,     useUnifiedTopology: true }   mongoose.connect connection_url, {     useNewUrlParser: true,     useCreateIndex: true,     useUnifiedTopology: true }     api routes ...  265   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Complete the code to upload the image. First, create a gfs variable, and then use the  conn variable to connect to the database. Next, use Grid to connect to the database and  then create a collection of images to store the pics.  Next, create the storage variable, which calls a GridFsStorage function with an  object. Here, the connection_url variable is used. Inside a promise, create a unique  filename by appending the current date to it. Create a fileInfo object containing the  filename and the bucketName as the earlier create collection images.  Use the multer package to upload the image by passing the variable created earlier. Build the endpoint to upload the image using POST requests, and upload the   variable created earlier. The updated code in server.js is marked in bold.  ...   DB Config const connection = mongoose.createConnection connection_url, { ... }   let gfs  connection.once 'open',    => {     console.log 'DB Connected'      gfs = Grid connection.db, mongoose.mongo      gfs.collection 'images'  }   const storage = new GridFsStorage {     url: connection_url,     file:  req, file  => {         return new Promise  resolve, reject  => {  originalname }`              const fileInfo = {                 filename: filename,                 bucketName: 'images'             }             resolve fileInfo          }      } }   266               const filename = `image-${Date.now  }${path.extname file.   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  const upload = multer { storage }   mongoose.connect connection_url, {   ... }     api routes app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    app.post ' upload image', upload.single 'file' , req, res  => {     res.status 201 .send req.file  }     listen ...  upload image.  Check the endpoint in Postman. Open a POST request to http:  localhost:9000   Select Body and then form-data. Next, select a file from the File drop-down menu  and then click Select Files. This opens a popup window in which you must choose an  image file  see Figure 6-17 .  Figure 6-17.  POST request  267   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Click the Send button. If everything is successful, you see the image details in   Postman, as shown in Figure 6-18.  Figure 6-18.  Post image  You can also check in MongoDB, where the image is saved as images.chunks and the   details are in images.files, as seen in Figure 6-19.  268   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Figure 6-19.  Image chunk  Create the route to get the file. To do this, create a  images single GET route, which   takes a parameter filename. Then use the findOne method to find the file.  If the file is present, use the gfs.createReadStream   to read the file. Then pass the   res to this read stream using a pipe. The updated code in server.js is marked in bold.  ...   api routes app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"    app.post ' upload image', upload.any 'file' , req, res  => {     res.status 201 .send req.file  }   app.get ' images single', req, res  => {     gfs.files.findOne { filename: req.query.name },  err, file  => {         if err  {             res.status 500 .send err          } else {             if !file  file.length === 0  {  269   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN                  res.status 404 .json { err: 'file not found' }              } else {                 const readstream = gfs.createReadStream file.filename                  readstream.pipe res              }         }     }  }     listen ...  Next, let’s test the GET route to receive an image in Postman. In Postman, open a GET request to http:  localhost:9000 images single. Under  Params, the KEY is name and the VALUE is the image from the MongoDB record. Once  you hit the Send button, the image is returned  see Figure 6-20 .  Figure 6-20.  GET request  270   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN   MongoDB Schema and Routes Until now, the process was to get the image and save it in MongoDB. Now that you have  the image details, you can save it in MongoDB with other post details.  To do this, you need to create the route to save the post. First, create the model for  the post. Then create a postModel.js file inside the popular-social-backend folder.  Here, you create a schema with the required parameters to be passed and then   export it.  import mongoose from 'mongoose'  const postsModel = mongoose.Schema {     user: String,     imgName: String,     text: String,     avatar: String,     timestamp: String }   export default mongoose.model 'posts', postsModel   You now use the schema to create the endpoint that adds data to the database. In server.js, create a POST request to the  upload endpoint. The load is in req.  body to MongoDB. Then use create   to send dbPost. If it’s a success, you receive status  201; otherwise, you receive status 500.  Next, create the GET endpoint to  sync to get the data from the database. You   are using find   here. You receive status 200 if successful  otherwise, status 500 . A  timestamp sorts the posts.  The updated code is marked in bold.  ... import Posts from '. postModel.js' ... app.post ' upload post',  req, res  => {     const dbPost = req.body     Posts.create dbPost,  err, data  => {         if err              res.status 500 .send err   271   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN          else             res.status 201 .send data      }  }   app.get ' posts',  req, res  => {     Posts.find  err, data  => {         if err  {             res.status 500 .send err          } else {             data.sort  b,a  => a.timestamp - b.timestamp              res.status 200 .send data          }     }  }     listen app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`     Integrating the Back End with the Front End You want to get all the messages when the app initially loads and then push the  messages. You need to hit the GET endpoint, and for that you need Axios. Open the  photo-social-frontend folder and install it.  npm i axios  Next, create a new axios.js file inside the src folder and create an instance of   axios. The base URL is http:  localhost:9000.  import axios from 'axios'  const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: "http:  localhost:9000" }   export default instance  272   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Do the necessary imports in the Feed.js file. After that, you have a postsData state   variable. Next, call a syncFeed function from useEffect once.  The syncFeed function does the GET call to the posts endpoint and sets postsData   with the res.data with setPostsData.  ... import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react' import axios from '.. axios'  const Feed =    => {     const [postsData, setPostsData] = useState []      const syncFeed =    => {         axios.get ' posts'              .then res => {                 console.log res.data                  setPostsData res.data              }      }      useEffect    => {         syncFeed       }, []       return                                                     {                 postsData.map entry =>                       <Post                         profilePic={entry.avatar}                         message={entry.text}                         timestamp={entry.timestamp}                         imgName={entry.imgName}                         username={entry.user}                      >                                }  273   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN                  }  const FeedWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default Feed  In Messenger.js, add the imports for axios and FormData, which append the new   image.  Update handleSubmit  . Here, check for the image that you already uploaded—and   then append the image and the image name in the form.  Use axios.post to send the image to the  upload image endpoint. In the then part,  create a postData object to take the text from the user-entered input. imgName contains  the name of the image from res.data.filename. The user and avatar are taken from the  Firebase data and the timestamp is from Date.now  .  Call the savePost   with the postData object. Note that there is an else, where you  are not sending the image to savePost  . This is for cases where the user creates a post  without any image.  In savePost  , you take postData and do a POST call to the  upload post endpoint.   The updated content is marked in bold.  ... import axios from '.. axios' import FormData from 'form-data'  const Messenger =    => {    ...     const handleSubmit = e => {         e.preventDefault           if image  {             const imgForm = new FormData               imgForm.append 'file',image, image.name              axios.post ' upload image', imgForm, {                 headers: {                     'accept': 'application json',                     'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.8',  274   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN                       'Content-Type': `multipart form-data;   boundary=${imgForm._boundary}`                  }             } .then res => {                 const postData = {                     text: input,                     imgName: res.data.filename,                     user: user.displayName,                     avatar: user.photoURL,                     timestamp: Date.now                   }                 savePost postData              }          } else {             const postData = {                 text: input,                 user: user.displayName,                 avatar: user.photoURL,                 timestamp: Date.now               }             savePost postData          }         setInput ''          setImage null      }      const savePost = async postData => {         await axios.post ' upload post', postData              .then res => {                 console.log res              }      } return  ...  }  const MessengerWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default Messenger  275   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  The next change is in the Post.js file, where you show the image you get from the   http:  localhost:9000 images single endpoint by passing the image name as a  parameter. The updated content in the Post.js file is marked in bold.  ... const Post =  { profilePic, message, timestamp, imgName, username }  => {     return              ...             {                 imgName ?                                                  <img src={`http:  localhost:9000 images  single?name=${imgName}`} alt="Posts"  >                                          :                           console.log 'DEBUG >>> no image here'                                    }            ...                 } ...  You now have a working application in which you can upload an image and post   messages. It is stored in MongoDB and shown on the homepage. But you have a  problem, and the posts are not reflected in real time. You must refresh the app  see  Figure 6-21 .  276   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Figure 6-21.  Problem  Configuring Pusher Since MongoDB is not a real-time database, it’s time to add a pusher to the app for real-  time data. Since you already did the setup in Chapter 4, follow the same instructions, and  create an app named photo-social-mern.   Adding Pusher to the Back End Since Pusher is already installed on the back end, you just need to add the code for it  in the server.js file. Use the Pusher initialization code, which you get from the Pusher  website. You use it by creating a new Mongoose connection in server.js. Here, you use  changeStream to monitor all changes in the posts. If there is any change, trigger a pusher.  277   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  ...   App Config ... const pusher = new Pusher {     appId: "11xxxx",     key: "9exxxxxxxxxxxxx",     secret: "b7xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",     cluster: "ap2",     useTLS: true } ;    API Endpoints mongoose.connect connection_url, {  ...}   mongoose.connection.once 'open',    => {     console.log 'DB Connected for pusher'      const changeStream = mongoose.connection.collection 'posts' .watch       changeStream.on 'change', change => {         console.log change          if change.operationType === "insert"  {             console.log 'Trigerring Pusher'              pusher.trigger 'posts','inserted', {                 change: change            }          } else {             console.log 'Error trigerring Pusher'          }     }  }   app.get " ",  req, res  => res.status 200 .send "Hello TheWebDev"   ...   Listener app.listen port,    => console.log `Listening on localhost: ${port}`    278   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN   Adding Pusher to the Front End It’s time to move to the front end and use Pusher. First, you need to install the pusher-js  package in the photo-social-frontend folder.  npm i pusher-js  Import Pusher into Feed.js and then use the unique code. Then use useEffect to   subscribe to the posts. If it changes, call syncFeed  , which gets all the posts again from  the  posts endpoint. The updated code is marked in bold.  ... import Pusher from 'pusher-js'  const pusher = new Pusher 'e6xxxxxxxxxxxxxx', {     cluster: 'ap2' } ;  const Feed =    => {     const [postsData, setPostsData] = useState []       const syncFeed =    => {         axios.get ' posts'              .then res => {                 console.log res.data                  setPostsData res.data              }      }      useEffect    => {         const channel = pusher.subscribe 'posts' ;         channel.bind 'inserted',  data  => {             syncFeed           } ;     },[]      useEffect    => {         syncFeed       }, []   279   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN      return  ...  }  const FeedWrapper = styled.div`...`  export default Feed  And now back in the app, you can post anything in real time.   Deploying the Back End to Heroku Go to www.heroku.com to deploy the back end. Follow the same procedure that you did  Chapter 1 and create an app named popular-social-backend.  After successfully deploying, go to https:  popular- social- backend.herokuapp.  com. Figure 6-22 shows the correct text.  Figure 6-22.  Back end deployed  Go back to axios.js and change the endpoint to https:  popular- social-   backend.herokuapp.com. If everything is working fine, your app should run.  import axios from 'axios' const instance = axios.create {     baseURL: "https:  popular-social-backend.herokuapp.com" }   export default instance   Deploying the Front End to Firebase It’s time to deploy the front end in Firebase. Follow the same procedure that you did in  Chapter 1.  280   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  You need to update the Post.js file. The updated content is marked in bold.      ...             {                 imgName ?                                                  <img src={` https:  popular-social-backend.  herokuapp.com images single?name=${imgName}`}  alt="Posts"  >                                          :                           console.log 'DEBUG >>> no image here'                                    }     ...  After this process, the site is live and working properly.   Deploying the Front End to Firebase It’s time to deploy the front end in Firebase. Follow the same procedure that you did in  Chapter 1. After this process, the site should be live and working properly, as seen in  Figure 6-23.  281   Chapter 6    Build a popular SoCial Network with MerN  Figure 6-23.  Final deployed site   Summary In this chapter, you created a simple but functional social network. Firebase hosted it on  the Internet. You learned to add Google authentication, by which you can log in with the  Google account.

Learn how to use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node) to build five fully functioning web apps for dating, video sharing, messaging, and social media. While creating these web apps, you’ll learn key development concepts including how to use React hooks, Redux, MongoDB, Express, Heroku, Firebase, Material UI, and Google authentication. By expanding your portfolio with the projects you create, you will be well equipped as front-end developer. You will first create a dating site with a swiping feature and chat functionality. You will then build a video sharing app with videos displaying vertically. Next, you will learn to build an awesome messaging web app. Users will be able to chat in real time, as well as log in to their account using Google authentication. You will also create a photo sharing app and social media web apps with the ability to post images with captions and log in using email and password authentication. Most MERN tutorials out there today cover basic web apps but it is capable of so much more – learn how to use this stack to its full potential and build projects that can be converted into full scaled start-ups with additional features
