Like Atlas, they go largely unno- ticed in supporting the digital world we’ve come to inhabit. It’s easy to forget that our digital interactions, from commenting and tweeting to searching and sorting, are in essence  interactions  with  a  database.  Because  of  this  fundamental  yet  hidden  func- tion, I always experience a certain sense of awe when thinking about databases, not unlike  the  awe  one  might  feel  when  walking  across  a  suspension  bridge  normally reserved for automobiles.    The database has taken many forms. The indexes of books and the card catalogs that once stood in libraries are both databases of a sort, as are the ad hoc structured text  files  of  the  Perl  programmers  of  yore.  Perhaps  most  recognizable  now  as  data- bases proper are the sophisticated, fortune-making relational databases that underlie much of the world’s software. These relational databases, with their idealized third- normal  forms  and  expressive  SQL  interfaces,  still  command  the  respect  of  the  old guard, and appropriately so.    But as a working web application developer a few years back, I was eager to sample the  emerging  alternatives  to  the  reigning  relational  database.  When  I  discovered MongoDB, the resonance was immediate. I liked the idea of using a JSON-like struc- ture to represent data. JSON is simple, intuitive, and human-friendly. That MongoDB also based its query language on JSON lent a high degree of comfort and harmony to the usage of this new database. The interface came first. Compelling features like easy replication and sharding made the package all the more intriguing. And by the time  xvii  www.it-ebooks.info   xviii  PREFACE  I’d  built  a  few  applications  on  MongoDB  and  beheld  the  ease  of  development  it imparted, I’d become a convert.     Through  an  unlikely  turn  of  events,  I  started  working  for  10gen,  the  company spearheading the development of this open source database. For two years, I’ve had the opportunity to improve various client drivers and work with numerous customers on their MongoDB deployments. The experience gained through this process has, I hope, been distilled faithfully into the book you’re reading now.    As a piece of software and a work in progress, MongoDB is still far from perfection. But it’s also successfully supporting thousands of applications atop database clusters small and large, and it’s maturing daily. It’s been known to bring out wonder, even happiness, in many a developer. My hope is that it can do the same for you.   This is the second edition of MongoDB in Action and I hope that you enjoy read-  ing the book!   KYLE BANKER  www.it-ebooks.info   acknowledgments  Thanks are due to folks at Manning for helping make this book a reality. Michael Stephens helped conceive the first edition of this book, and my development editors for this second edition, Susan Conant, Jeff Bleiel, and Maureen Spencer, pushed the book to completion while being helpful along the way. My thanks go to them.   Book writing is a time-consuming enterprise. I feel I wouldn’t have found the time to finish this book had it not been for the generosity of Eliot Horowitz and Dwight Merriman. Eliot and Dwight, through their initiative and ingenuity, created MongoDB, and they trusted me to document the project. My thanks to them.    Many of the ideas in this book owe their origins to conversations I had with col- leagues at 10gen. In this regard, special thanks are due to Mike Dirolf, Scott Hernandez, Alvin Richards, and Mathias Stearn. I’m especially indebted to Kristina Chowdorow, Richard Kreuter, and Aaron Staple for providing expert reviews of entire chapters for the first edition.   The following reviewers read the manuscript of the first edition at various stages during  its  development:  Kevin  Jackson,  Hardy  Ferentschik,  David  Sinclair,  Chris Chandler, John Nunemaker, Robert Hanson, Alberto Lerner, Rick Wagner, Ryan Cox, Andy  Brudtkuhl,  Daniel  Bretoi,  Greg  Donald,  Sean  Reilly,  Curtis  Miller,  Sanchet Dighe, Philip Hallstrom, and Andy Dingley. And I am also indebted to all the review- ers who read the second edition, including Agustin Treceno, Basheeruddin Ahmed, Gavin  Whyte,  George  Girton,  Gregor  Zurowski,  Hardy  Ferentschik,  Hernan  Garcia, Jeet  Marwah,  Johan  Mattisson,  Jonathan  Thoms,  Julia  Varigina,  Jürgen  Hoffmann, Mike Frey, Phlippie Smith, Scott Lyons, and Steve Johnson. Special thanks go to Wouter Thielen for his work on chapter 10, technical editor Mihalis Tsoukalos, who devoted  xix  www.it-ebooks.info   xx  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  many hours to whipping the second edition into shape, and to Doug Warren for his thorough technical review of the second edition shortly before it went to press.   My amazing wife, Dominika, offered her patience and support, through the writing of both editions of this book, and to my wonderful son, Oliver, just for being awesome.   KYLE BANKER  www.it-ebooks.info   about this book  This book is for application developers and DBAs wanting to learn MongoDB from the ground up. If you’re new to MongoDB, you’ll find in this book a tutorial that moves at a comfortable pace. If you’re already a user, the more detailed reference sections in the book will come in handy and should fill any gaps in your knowledge. In terms of depth, the material should be suitable for all but the most advanced users. Although the book is about the latest MongoDB version, which at the time of writing is 3.0.x, it also covers the previous stable MongoDB version that is 2.6.   The code examples are written in JavaScript, the language of the MongoDB shell, and Ruby, a popular scripting language. Every effort has been made to provide simple but  useful  examples,  and  only  the  plainest  features  of  the  JavaScript  and  Ruby  lan- guages are used. The main goal is to present the MongoDB API in the most accessible way possible. If you have experience with other programming languages, you should find the examples easy to follow.    One more note about languages. If you’re wondering, “Why couldn’t this book use language X?” you can take heart. The officially supported MongoDB drivers feature consistent and analogous APIs. This means that once you learn the basic API for one driver, you can pick up the others fairly easily.  How to use this book This book is part tutorial, part reference. If you’re brand-new to MongoDB, then read- ing through the book in order makes a lot of sense. There are numerous code exam- ples that you can run on your own to help solidify the concepts. At minimum, you’ll  xxi  www.it-ebooks.info   xxii  ABOUT THIS BOOK  need to install MongoDB and optionally the Ruby driver. Instructions for these instal- lations can be found in appendix A.   If you’ve already used MongoDB, then you may be more interested in particular topics. Chapters 8 to 13 and all of the appendixes stand on their own and can safely be read in any order. Additionally, chapters 4 to 7 contain the so-called “nuts and bolts” sections, which focus on fundamentals. These also can be read outside the flow of the surrounding text.  Roadmap This book is divided into three parts.    Part 1 is an end-to-end introduction to MongoDB. Chapter 1 gives an overview of MongoDB’s history, features, and use cases. Chapter 2 teaches the database’s core con- cepts through a tutorial on the MongoDB command shell. Chapter 3 walks through the design of a simple application that uses MongoDB on the back end.    Part 2 is an elaboration on the MongoDB API presented in part 1. With a specific focus on application development, the four chapters in part 2 progressively describe a schema and its operations for an e-commerce app. Chapter 4 delves into documents, the  smallest  unit  of  data  in  MongoDB,  and  puts  forth  a  basic  e-commerce  schema design. Chapters 5, 6, and 7 then teach you how to work with this schema by covering queries and updates. To augment the presentation, each of the chapters in part 2 con- tains a detailed breakdown of its subject matter.    Part 3 focuses on MongoDB mastery. Chapter 8 is a thorough study of indexing and query optimization. The subject of Chapter 9 is text searching inside MongoDB. Chapter 10, which is totally new in this edition, is about the WiredTiger storage engine and pluggable storage, which are unique features of MongoDB v3. Chapter 11 concen- trates on replication, with strategies for deploying MongoDB for high availability and read scaling. Chapter 12 describes sharding, MongoDB’s path to horizontal scalability. And chapter 13 provides a series of best practices for deploying, administering, and troubleshooting MongoDB installations.   The book ends with three appendixes. Appendix A covers installation of MongoDB and Ruby  for the driver examples  on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. Appendix B presents a series of schema and application design patterns, and it also includes a list of  anti-patterns.  Appendix  C  shows  how  to  work  with  binary  data  in  MongoDB and how to use GridFS, a spec implemented by all the drivers, to store especially large files in the database.   Code conventions and downloads All  source  code  in  the  listings  and  in  the  text  is  presented  in  a  fixed-width  font, which separates it from ordinary text.     Code  annotations  accompany  some  of  the  listings,  highlighting  important  con-  cepts. In some cases, numbered bullets link to explanations that follow in the text.   www.it-ebooks.info   ABOUT THIS BOOK  xxiii   As an open source project, 10gen keeps MongoDB’s bug tracker open to the com- munity at large. At several points in the book, particularly in the footnotes, you’ll see references  to  bug  reports  and  planned  improvements.  For  example,  the  ticket  for adding full-text search to the database is SERVER-380. To view the status of any such ticket, point your browser to http:  jira.mongodb.org, and enter the ticket ID in the search box.   You can download the book’s source code, with some sample data, from the book’s site  at  http:  mongodb-book.com  as  well  as  from  the  publisher’s  website  at http:   manning.com MongoDBinAction.  Software requirements To get the most out of this book, you’ll need to have MongoDB installed on your sys- tem. Instructions for installing MongoDB can be found in appendix A and also on the official MongoDB website  http:  mongodb.org .   If you want to run the Ruby driver examples, you’ll also need to install Ruby. Again,  consult appendix A for instructions on this.

The illustration is taken from a nineteenth-century collection of works by many artists, edited by Louis Curmer and published  in  Paris  in  1841.  The  title  of  the  collection  is  Les  Français  peints  par  eux- mêmes,  which  translates  as  The  French  People  Painted  by  Themselves.  Each  illustration  is finely drawn and colored by hand, and the rich variety of drawings in the collection reminds  us  vividly  of  how  culturally  apart  the  world’s  regions,  towns,  villages,  and neighborhoods were just 200 years ago. Isolated from each other, people spoke differ- ent dialects and languages. In the streets or in the countryside, it was easy to identify where they lived and what their trade or station in life was just by their dress.   Dress codes have changed since then and the diversity by region, so rich at the time,  has  faded  away.  It  is  now  hard  to  tell  apart  the  inhabitants  of  different  conti- nents, let alone different towns or regions. Perhaps we have traded cultural diversity for a more varied personal life—certainly for a more varied and fast-paced technolog- ical life.   At a time when it is hard to tell one computer book from another, Manning cele- brates  the  inventiveness  and  initiative  of  the  computer  business  with  book  covers based on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life by pictures from collections such as this one.  xxiv  www.it-ebooks.info   Part 1  Getting started  Part 1 of this book provides a broad, practical introduction to MongoDB. It  also introduces the JavaScript shell and the Ruby driver, both of which are used in examples throughout the book.     We’ve written this book with developers in mind, but it should be useful even if you’re a casual user of MongoDB. Some programming experience will prove helpful  in  understanding  the  examples,  though  we  focus  most  on  MongoDB itself. If you’ve worked with relational databases in the past, great! We compare these to MongoDB often.     MongoDB version 3.0.x is the most recent MongoDB version at the time of writing,  but  most  of  the  discussion  applies  to  previous  versions  of  MongoDB  and presumably later versions . We usually mention it when a particular feature wasn’t available in previous versions.   You’ll use JavaScript for most examples because MongoDB’s JavaScript shell makes it easy for you to experiment with these queries. Ruby is a popular lan- guage among MongoDB users, and our examples show how the use of Ruby in real-world  applications  can  take  advantage  of  MongoDB.  Rest  assured,  even  if you’re not a Ruby developer you can access MongoDB in much the same way as in other languages.   In chapter 1, you’ll look at MongoDB’s history, design goals, and application use cases. You’ll also see what makes MongoDB unique as you compare it with other databases emerging in the “NoSQL” space.    In chapter 2, you’ll become conversant in the language of MongoDB’s shell. You’ll  learn  the  basics  of  MongoDB’s  query  language,  and  you’ll  practice  by  www.it-ebooks.info   2  PART 1 Getting started  creating, querying, updating, and deleting documents. The chapter also features some advanced shell tricks and MongoDB commands.    Chapter 3 introduces the MongoDB  drivers  and  MongoDB’s data format,  BSON. Here  you’ll  learn  how  to  talk  to  the  database  through  the  Ruby  programming  lan- guage, and you’ll build a simple application in Ruby demonstrating MongoDB’s flexi- bility and query power.    To get the most out of this book, follow along and try out the examples. If you don’t have MongoDB installed yet, appendix A can help you get it running on your machine.  www.it-ebooks.info   A database for the modern web  This chapter covers   MongoDB’s history, design goals, and key   features    A brief introduction to the shell and drivers   Use cases and limitations   Recent changes in MongoDB  If you’ve built web applications in recent years, you’ve probably used a relational database as the primary data store. If you’re familiar with SQL, you might appreci- ate the usefulness of a well-normalized1 data model, the necessity of transactions, and the assurances provided by a durable storage engine. Simply put, the relational database is mature and well-known. When developers start advocating alternative datastores,  questions  about  the  viability  and  utility  of  these  new  technologies arise.  Are  these  new  datastores  replacements  for  relational  database  systems? Who’s using them in production, and why? What trade-offs are involved in moving  1 When we mention normalization we’re usually talking about reducing redundancy when you store data. For example, in a SQL database you can split parts of your data, such as users and orders, into their own tables to reduce redundant storage of usernames.  3  www.it-ebooks.info   4  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  to a nonrelational database? The answers to those questions rest on the answer to this one: why are developers interested in MongoDB?   MongoDB is a database management system designed to rapidly develop web appli- cations  and  internet  infrastructure.  The  data  model  and  persistence  strategies  are built for high read-and-write throughput and the ability to scale easily with automatic failover. Whether an application requires just one database node or dozens of them, MongoDB can provide surprisingly good performance. If you’ve experienced difficul- ties scaling relational databases, this may be great news. But not everyone needs to operate at scale. Maybe all you’ve ever needed is a single database server. Why would you use MongoDB?    Perhaps  the  biggest  reason  developers  use  MongoDB  isn’t  because  of  its  scaling strategy, but because of its intuitive data model. MongoDB stores its information in documents rather than rows. What’s a document? Here’s an example:  This is a pretty simple document; it’s storing a few fields of information about a user  he sounds cool . What’s the advantage of this model? Consider the case where you’d like to store multiple emails for each user. In the relational world, you might create a separate table of email addresses and the users to which they’re associated. MongoDB gives you another way to store these:  {   _id: 10,   username: 'peter',   email: 'pbbakkum@gmail.com' }  {   _id: 10,   username: 'peter',   email: [     'pbbakkum@gmail.com',     'pbb7c@virginia.edu'   ] }  And just like that, you’ve created an array of email addresses and solved your problem. As a developer, you’ll find it extremely useful to be able to store a structured docu- ment  like  this  in  your  database  without  worrying  about  fitting  a  schema  or  adding more tables when your data changes.   MongoDB’s document format is based on JSON, a popular scheme for storing arbi- trary data structures. JSON is an acronym for JavaScript Object Notation. As you just saw, JSON structures consist of keys and values, and they can nest arbitrarily deep. They’re analogous to the dictionaries and hash maps of other programming languages.   A document-based data model can represent rich, hierarchical data structures. It’s often possible to do without the multitable joins common to relational databases. For example, suppose you’re modeling products for an e-commerce site. With a fully  www.it-ebooks.info   Built for the internet  5  normalized  relational  data  model,  the  information  for  any  one  product  might  be divided among dozens of tables. If you want to get a product representation from the database shell, you’ll need to write a SQL query full of joins.   With a document model, by contrast, most of a product’s information can be rep- resented  within  a  single  document.  When  you  open  the  MongoDB  JavaScript  shell, you can easily get a comprehensible representation of your product with all its infor- mation hierarchically organized in a JSON-like structure. You can also query for it and manipulate it. MongoDB’s query capabilities are designed specifically for manipulat- ing structured documents, so users switching from relational databases experience a similar level of query power. In addition, most developers now work with object-oriented languages, and they want a data store that better maps to objects. With MongoDB, an object defined in the programming language can often be persisted as is, removing some of the complexity of object mappers. If you’re experienced with relational data- bases, it can be helpful to approach MongoDB from the perspective of transitioning your existing skills into this new database.   If the distinction between a tabular and object representation of data is new to you, you probably have a lot of questions. Rest assured that by the end of this chapter you’ll have a thorough overview of MongoDB’s features and design goals. You’ll learn the history  of  MongoDB  and  take  a  tour  of  the  database’s  main  features.  Next,  you’ll explore  some  alternative  database  solutions  in  the  NoSQL2  category  and  see  how MongoDB fits in. Finally, you’ll learn where MongoDB works best and where an alter- native datastore might be preferable given some of MongoDB’s limitations.   MongoDB has been criticized on several fronts, sometimes fairly and sometimes unfairly. Our view is that it’s a tool in the developer’s toolbox, like any other database, and you should know its limitations and strengths. Some workloads demand relational joins  and  different  memory  management  than  MongoDB  provides.  On  the  other hand, the document-based model fits particularly well with some workloads, and the lack of a schema means that MongoDB can be one of the best tools for quickly devel- oping and iterating on an application. Our goal is to give you the information you need to decide if MongoDB is right for you and explain how to use it effectively.  Built for the internet The history of MongoDB is brief but worth recounting, for it was born out of a much more ambitious project. In mid-2007, a startup in New York City called 10gen began work on a platform-as-a-service  PaaS , composed of an application server and a data- base, that would host web applications and scale them as needed. Like Google’s App Engine,  10gen’s  platform  was  designed  to  handle  the  scaling  and  management  of hardware and software infrastructure automatically, freeing developers to focus solely on  their  application  code.  10gen  ultimately  discovered  that  most  developers  didn’t feel comfortable giving up so much control over their technology stacks, but users did  1.1  2 The umbrella term NoSQL was coined in 2009 to lump together the many nonrelational databases gaining in popularity at the time, one of their commonalities being that they use a query language other than SQL.  www.it-ebooks.info   6  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  want 10gen’s new database technology. This led 10gen to concentrate its efforts solely on the database that became MongoDB.   10gen has since changed its name to MongoDB, Inc. and continues to sponsor the database’s development as an open source project. The code is publicly available and free to modify and use, subject to the terms of its license, and the community at large is encouraged to file bug reports and submit patches. Still, most of MongoDB’s core developers  are  either  founders  or  employees  of  MongoDB,  Inc.,  and  the  project’s roadmap  continues  to  be  determined  by  the  needs  of  its  user  community  and  the overarching goal of creating a database that combines the best features of relational databases and distributed key-value stores. Thus, MongoDB, Inc.’s business model isn’t unlike that of other well-known open source companies: support the development of an open source product and provide subscription services to end users.    The  most  important  thing  to  remember  from  its  history  is  that  MongoDB  was intended to be an extremely simple, yet flexible, part of a web-application stack. These kinds of use cases have driven the choices made in MongoDB’s development and help explain its features.  1.2 MongoDB’s key features  A database is defined in large part by its data model. In this section, you’ll look at the document data model, and then you’ll see the features of MongoDB that allow you to operate effectively on that model. This section also explores operations, focusing on MongoDB’s flavor of replication and its strategy for scaling horizontally.  1.2.1 Document data model  MongoDB’s data model is document-oriented. If you’re not familiar with documents in the context of databases, the concept can be most easily demonstrated by an exam- ple. A  JSON  document  needs  double  quotes  everywhere  except  for  numeric  values. The following listing shows the JavaScript version of a JSON document where double quotes aren’t necessary.  Listing 1.1 A document representing an entry on a social news site  _id field,  primary key  {    _id: ObjectID '4bd9e8e17cefd644108961bb' ,           title: 'Adventures in Databases',   url: 'http:  example.com databases.txt',   author: 'msmith',   vote_count: 20,   tags: ['databases', 'mongodb', 'indexing'],                 image: {                                          url: 'http:  example.com db.jpg',     caption: 'A database.',     type: 'jpg',     size: 75381,     data: 'Binary'   },  b  c  Tags stored  as array of  strings  Attribute pointing to  another document  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s key features  7  Comments stored  as array of  comment objects  d    comments: [                               {        user: 'bjones',       text: 'Interesting article.'     },     {        user: 'sverch',       text: 'Color me skeptical!'     }   ] }  This listing shows a JSON document representing an article on a social news site  think Reddit or Twitter . As you can see, a document is essentially a set of property names and their values. The values can be simple data types, such as strings, numbers, and dates. But these values can also be arrays and even other JSON documents c. These latter constructs permit documents to represent a variety of rich data structures. You’ll see that the sample document has a property, tags B, which stores the article’s tags in an array. But even more interesting is the comments property d, which is an array of comment documents.  Internally, MongoDB stores documents in a format called Binary JSON, or BSON. BSON has a similar structure but is intended for storing many documents. When you query MongoDB and get results back, these will be translated into an easy-to-read data structure. The MongoDB shell uses JavaScript and gets documents in JSON, which is what we’ll use for most of our examples. We’ll discuss the BSON format extensively in later chapters.   Where relational databases have tables, MongoDB has collections. In other words, MySQL  a popular relational database  keeps its data in tables of rows, while MongoDB keeps its data in collections of documents, which you can think of as a group of documents. Collections are an important concept in MongoDB. The data in a collection is stored to disk, and most queries require you to specify which collection you’d like to target.    Let’s  take  a  moment  to  compare  MongoDB  collections  to  a  standard  relational database representation of the same data. Figure 1.1 shows a likely relational analog. Because tables are essentially flat, representing the various one-to-many relationships in your post document requires multiple tables. You start with a posts table containing the core  information  for  each  post.  Then  you  create  three  other  tables,  each  of  which includes a field, post_id, referencing the original post. The technique of separating an object’s data into multiple tables like this is known as normalization. A normalized data set, among other things, ensures that each unit of data is represented in one place only.   But strict normalization isn’t without its costs. Notably, some assembly is required. To display the post you just referenced, you’ll need to perform a join between the post and  comments  tables.  Ultimately,  the  question  of  whether  strict  normalization  is required depends on the kind of data you’re modeling, and chapter 4 will have much more to say about the topic. What’s important to note here is that a document-oriented data model naturally represents data in an aggregate form, allowing you to work with an object holistically: all the data representing a post, from comments to tags, can be fitted into a single database object.  www.it-ebooks.info   8  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  id  author_id  title  url  posts  int 11   int 11   varchar 255   text  vote_count  smallint 5   id  post_id  tag_id  post_tags  int 11   int 11   int 11   id  post_id  user_id  text  comments  int 11   int 11   int 11   text  id  post_id  caption  type  size  location  images  int 11   int 11   int 11   varchar 255   mediumint 8   varchar 255   id  text  tags  int 11   varchar 255   Figure 1.1 A basic relational data model for entries on a social news site. The line  terminator that looks like a cross represents a one-to-one relationship, so there’s only  one row from the images table associated with a row from the posts table. The line  terminator that branches apart represents a one-to-many relationship, so there can be  many rows in the comments table associated with a row from the posts table.  You’ve probably noticed that in addition to providing a richness of structure, docu- ments  needn’t  conform  to  a  prespecified  schema.  With  a  relational  database,  you store rows in a table. Each table has a strictly defined schema specifying which col- umns and types are permitted. If any row in a table needs an extra field, you have to alter the table explicitly. MongoDB groups documents into collections, containers that don’t impose any sort of schema. In theory, each document in a collection can have a completely different structure; in practice, a collection’s document will be relatively uniform. For instance, every document in the posts collection will have fields for the title, tags, comments, and so forth. SCHEMA-LESS MODEL ADVANTAGES This lack of imposed schema confers some advantages. First, your application code, and not the database, enforces the data’s structure. This can speed up initial applica- tion development when the schema is changing frequently.    Second, and more significantly, a schema-less model allows you to represent data with truly variable properties. For example, imagine you’re building an e-commerce  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s key features  9  catalog_product_entity  entity_id  entity_type_id  attribute_set_id  int 11   int 5   int 5   type_id  sku  varchar 32   ivarchar 64   catalog_product_entity_datetime  catalog_product_entity_decimal  value_id  entity_type_id  attribute_id  store_id  entity_id  value  value_id  entity_type_id  attribute_id  store_id  entity_id  value  value_id  entity_type_id  attribute_id  store_id  entity_id  value  value_id  entity_type_id  attribute_id  store_id  entity_id  value  value_id  entity_type_id  attribute_id  store_id  entity_id  value  int 11   smallint 5   smallint 5   smallint 5   int 10   datetime  int 11   smallint 5   smallint 5   smallint 5   int 10   decimal 12, 4   int 11   smallint 5   smallint 5   smallint 5   int 10   int 11   int 11   smallint 5   smallint 5   smallint 5   int 10   text  int 11   smallint 5   smallint 5   smallint 5   int 10   varchar 255   catalog_product_entity_int  catalog_product_entity_text  catalog_product_entity_varchar  www.it-ebooks.info  Figure 1.2 A portion of the  schema for an e-commerce  application. These tables  facilitate dynamic attribute  creation for products.  product catalog. There’s no way of knowing in advance what attributes a product will have, so the application will need to account for that variability. The traditional way of handling this in a fixed-schema database is to use the entity-attribute-value pattern,3 shown in figure 1.2.   3 For more information see http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Entity-attribute-value_model.   10  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  1.2.2  Ad hoc queries    What  you’re  seeing  is  one  section  of  the  data  model  for  an  e-commerce  frame- work. Note the series of tables that are all essentially the same, except for a single attri- bute,  value,  that  varies  only  by  data  type.  This  structure  allows  an  administrator  to define additional product types and their attributes, but the result is significant com- plexity. Think about firing up the MySQL shell to examine or update a product mod- eled in this way; the SQL joins required to assemble the product would be enormously complex.  Modeled  as  a  document,  no  join  is  required,  and  new  attributes  can  be added dynamically. Not all relational models are this complex, but the point is that when  you’re  developing  a  MongoDB  application  you  don’t  need  to  worry  as  much about what data fields you’ll need in the future.  To say that a system supports ad hoc queries is to say that it isn’t necessary to define in advance  what  sorts  of  queries  the  system  will  accept.  Relational  databases  have  this property;  they’ll  faithfully  execute  any  well-formed  SQL  query  with  any  number  of conditions. Ad hoc queries are easy to take for granted if the only databases you’ve ever  used  have  been  relational.  But  not  all  databases  support  dynamic  queries.  For instance, key-value stores are queryable on one axis only: the value’s key. Like many other  systems,  key-value  stores  sacrifice  rich  query  power  in  exchange  for  a  simple scalability  model.  One  of  MongoDB’s  design  goals  is  to  preserve  most  of  the  query power that’s been so fundamental to the relational database world.   To see how MongoDB’s query language works, let’s take a simple example involv- ing posts and comments. Suppose you want to find all posts tagged with the term poli- tics having more than 10 votes. A SQL query would look like this:  SELECT * FROM posts   INNER JOIN posts_tags ON posts.id = posts_tags.post_id   INNER JOIN tags ON posts_tags.tag_id == tags.id   WHERE tags.text = 'politics' AND posts.vote_count > 10;  The equivalent query in MongoDB is specified using a document as a matcher. The special $gt key indicates the greater-than condition:  db.posts.find {'tags': 'politics', 'vote_count': {'$gt': 10}} ;  Note that the two queries assume a different data model. The SQL query relies on a strictly normalized model, where posts and tags are stored in distinct tables, whereas the MongoDB query assumes that tags are stored within each post document. But both queries demonstrate an ability to query on arbitrary combinations of attributes, which is the essence of ad hoc query ability.  1.2.3  Indexes  A  critical  element  of  ad  hoc  queries  is  that  they  search  for  values  that  you  don’t know when you create the database. As you add more and more documents to your  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s key features  11  database,  searching  for  a  value  becomes  increasingly  expensive;  it’s  a  needle  in  an ever-expanding haystack. Thus, you need a way to efficiently search through your data. The solution to this is an index.    The  best  way  to  understand  database  indexes  is  by  analogy:  many  books  have indexes matching keywords to page numbers. Suppose you have a cookbook and want to find all recipes calling for pears  maybe you have a lot of pears and don’t want them to go bad . The time-consuming approach would  be  to  page  through  every  recipe, checking each ingredient list for pears. Most people would prefer to check the book’s index for the pears entry, which would give a list of all the recipes containing pears. Database indexes are data structures that provide this same service.   Indexes in MongoDB are implemented as a B-tree data structure. B-tree indexes, also used in many relational databases, are optimized for a variety of queries, includ- ing  range  scans  and  queries  with  sort  clauses.  But  WiredTiger  has  support  for  log- structured merge-trees  LSM  that’s expected to be available in the MongoDB 3.2 pro- duction release.   Most databases give each document or row a primary key, a unique identifier for that datum. The primary key is generally indexed automatically so that each datum can be efficiently accessed using its unique key, and MongoDB is no different. But not every database allows you to also index the data inside that row or document. These are called secondary indexes. Many NoSQL databases, such as HBase, are considered key- value stores because they don’t allow any secondary indexes. This is a significant feature in MongoDB; by permitting multiple secondary indexes MongoDB allows users to opti- mize for a wide variety of queries.    With  MongoDB,  you  can  create  up  to  64  indexes  per  collection.  The  kinds  of indexes supported include all the ones you’d find in an RDMBS; ascending, descend- ing, unique, compound-key, hashed, text, and even geospatial indexes4 are supported. Because MongoDB and most RDBMSs use the same data structure for their indexes, advice for managing indexes in both of these systems is similar. You’ll begin looking at indexes in the next chapter, and because an understanding of indexing is so crucial to efficiently operating a database, chapter 8 is devoted to the topic.  1.2.4 Replication  MongoDB provides database replication via a topology known as a replica set. Replica sets  distribute  data  across  two  or  more  machines  for  redundancy  and  automate failover in the event of server and network outages. Additionally, replication is used to scale database reads. If you have a read-intensive application, as is commonly the case on the web, it’s possible to spread database reads across machines in the replica set cluster.  4 Geospatial indexes allow you to efficiently query for latitude and longitude points; they’re discussed later in  this book.  www.it-ebooks.info   12  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  1.2.5  Speed and durability   Replica sets consist of many MongoDB servers, usu- ally  with  each  server  on  a  separate  physical  machine; we’ll  call  these  nodes.  At  any  given  time,  one  node serves as the replica set primary node and one or more nodes serve as secondaries. Like the master-slave repli- cation that you may be familiar with from other data- bases,  a  replica  set’s  primary  node  can  accept  both reads  and  writes,  but  the  secondary  nodes  are  read- only. What makes replica sets unique is their support for  automated  failover:  if  the  primary  node  fails,  the cluster  will  pick  a  secondary  node  and  automatically promote  it  to  primary.  When  the  former  primary comes back online, it’ll do so as a secondary. An illus- tration of this process is provided in figure 1.3.    Replication  is  one  of  MongoDB’s  most  useful  fea-  tures and we’ll cover it in depth later in the book.  1. A working replica set  Secondary  Secondary  2. Original primary node fails and  a secondary is promoted to primary.  Secondary  Primary  Primary  X  To  understand  MongoDB’s  approach  to  durability,  it pays  to  consider  a  few  ideas  first.  In  the  realm  of database  systems  there  exists  an  inverse  relationship between write speed and durability. Write speed can be understood  as  the  volume  of  inserts,  updates,  and deletes  that  a  database  can  process  in  a  given  time frame. Durability refers to level of assurance that these write operations have been made permanent.  3. Original primary comes  back online as a secondary.  Secondary  Primary  Secondary   For instance, suppose you write 100 records of 50 KB  each  to  a  database  and  then  immediately  cut  the power on the server. Will those records be recoverable when you bring the machine back online? The answer depends  on  your  database  system,  its  configuration, and  the  hardware  hosting  it.  Most  databases  enable good  durability  by  default,  so  you’re  safe  if  this  hap- pens.  For  some  applications,  like  storing  log  lines,  it might make more sense to have faster writes, even if you risk data loss. The problem is that writing to a magnetic hard drive is orders of magnitude slower than writing to RAM. Certain databases, such as Memcached, write exclusively to RAM, which makes them extremely fast but completely volatile. On the other hand, few databases write exclusively to disk because the low performance of such an operation is unacceptable. Therefore, database designers often need to make compromises to provide the best balance of speed and durability.  Figure 1.3 Automated failover  with a replica set  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s key features  13  Transaction logging One  compromise  between  speed  and  durability  can  be  seen  in  MySQL’s  InnoDB. InnoDB is a transactional storage engine, which by definition must guarantee durabil- ity. It accomplishes this by writing its updates in two places: once to a transaction log and again to an in-memory buffer pool. The transaction log is synced to disk imme- diately, whereas the buffer pool is only eventually synced by a background thread. The reason for this dual write is because generally speaking, random I O is much slower than sequential I O. Because writes to the main data files constitute random I O, it’s faster to write these changes to RAM first, allowing the sync to disk to happen later. But some sort of write to disk is necessary to guarantee durability and it’s important that the write be sequential, and thus fast; this is what the transaction log provides. In  the  event  of  an  unclean  shutdown,  InnoDB  can  replay  its  transaction  log  and update the main data files accordingly. This provides an acceptable level of perfor- mance while guaranteeing a high level of durability.  In MongoDB’s case, users control the speed and durability trade-off by choosing write semantics  and  deciding  whether  to  enable  journaling.  Journaling  is  enabled  by default since MongoDB v2.0. In the drivers released after November 2012 MongoDB safely guarantees that a write has been written to RAM before returning to the user, though this characteristic is configurable. You can configure MongoDB to fire-and-forget, sending off a write to the server without waiting for an acknowledgment. You can also configure  MongoDB  to  guarantee  that  a  write  has  gone  to  multiple  replicas  before considering  it  committed.  For  high-volume,  low-value  data   like  clickstreams  and logs , fire-and-forget-style writes can be ideal. For important data, a safe mode setting is  necessary.  It’s  important  to  know  that  in  MongoDB  versions  older  than  2.0,  the unsafe fire-and-forget strategy was set as the default, because when 10gen started the development of MongoDB, it was focusing solely on that data tier and it was believed that the application tier would handle such errors. But as MongoDB was used for more and more use cases and not solely for the web tier, it was deemed that it was too unsafe for any data you didn’t want to lose.    Since MongoDB v2.0, journaling is enabled by default. With journaling, every write is flushed to the journal file every 100 ms. If the server is ever shut down uncleanly  say, in a power outage , the journal will be used to ensure that MongoDB’s data files are restored to a consistent state when you restart the server. This is the safest way to run MongoDB.    It’s  possible  to  run  the  server  without  journaling  as  a  way  of  increasing  perfor- mance for some write loads. The downside is that the data files may be corrupted after an unclean shutdown. As a consequence, anyone planning to disable journaling should run with replication, preferably to a second datacenter, to increase the likelihood that a pristine copy of the data will still exist even if there’s a failure.   MongoDB was designed to give you options in the speed-durability tradeoff, but we highly recommend safe settings for essential data. The topics of replication and dura- bility are vast; you’ll see a detailed exploration of them in chapter 11.  www.it-ebooks.info   14  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  1.2.6  Scaling  The easiest way to scale most databases is to upgrade the hardware. If your application is running on a single node, it’s usually possible to add some combination of faster disks, more memory, and a beefier CPU to ease any database bottlenecks. The tech- nique of augmenting a single node’s hardware for scale is known as vertical scaling, or scaling up. Vertical scaling has the advantages of being simple, reliable, and cost-effective up to a certain point, but eventually you reach a point where it’s no longer feasible to move to a better machine.   It then makes sense to consider scaling horizontally, or scaling out  see figure 1.4 . Instead of beefing up a single node, scaling horizontally means distributing the data- base across multiple machines. A horizontally scaled architecture can run on many smaller, less expensive machines, often reducing your hosting costs. What’s more, the distribution of data across machines mitigates the consequences of failure. Machines will  unavoidably  fail  from  time  to  time.  If  you’ve  scaled  vertically  and  the  machine fails, then you need to deal with the failure of a machine on which most of your system depends. This may not be an issue if a copy of the data exists on a replicated slave, but it’s still the case that only a single server need fail to bring down the entire system. Contrast that with failure inside a horizontally scaled architecture. This may be less catastrophic because a single machine represents a much smaller percentage of the system as a whole.   MongoDB was designed to make horizontal scaling manageable. It does so via a range-based partitioning mechanism, known as sharding, which automatically manages  Original database  68 GB of RAM  1690 GB of storage  Scaling up increases the  capacity of a single machine.

There’s  also  a  hash-  and  tag-based  sharding mechanism, but it’s just another form of the range-based sharding mechanism.    The  sharding  system  handles  the  addition of  shard  nodes,  and  it  also  facilitates automatic failover. Individual shards are made up of a replica set consisting of at least two nodes, ensuring automatic recovery with no single point of failure. All this means that no application code has to handle these logistics; your application code commu- nicates with a sharded cluster just as it speaks to a single node. Chapter 12 explores sharding in detail.   You’ve seen a lot of MongoDB’s most compelling features; in chapter 2, you’ll begin to see how some of them work in practice. But at this point, let’s take a more pragmatic look at the database. In the next section, you’ll look at MongoDB in its environment, the tools that ship with the core server, and a few ways of getting data in and out.   1.3 MongoDB’s core server and tools  MongoDB  is  written  in  C++  and  actively  developed  by  MongoDB,  Inc.  The  project compiles on all major operating systems, including Mac OS X, Windows, Solaris, and most flavors of Linux. Precompiled binaries are available for each of these platforms at http:  mongodb.org. MongoDB is open source and licensed under the GNU-Affero General Public License  AGPL . The source code is freely available on GitHub, and contributions from the community are frequently accepted. But the project is guided by the MongoDB, Inc. core server team, and the overwhelming majority of commits come from this group.  About the GNU-AGPL The GNU-AGPL is the subject of some controversy. In practice, this licensing means that the source code is freely available and that contributions from the community are encouraged. But GNU-AGPL requires that any modifications made to the source code must be published publicly for the benefit of the community. This can be a con- cern for companies that want to modify MongoDB but don’t want to publish these changes to others. For companies wanting to safeguard their core server enhance- ments, MongoDB, Inc. provides special commercial licenses.  MongoDB v1.0 was released in November 2009. Major releases appear approximately once every three months, with even point numbers for stable branches and odd num- bers for development. As of this writing, the latest stable release is v3.0.5   What follows is an overview of the components that ship with MongoDB along with a high-level description of the tools and language drivers for developing applications with the database.  5 You should always use the latest stable point release; for example, v3.0.6. Check out the complete installation  instructions in appendix A.  www.it-ebooks.info   16  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  1.3.1  Core server  The core database server runs via an executable called mongod  mongodb.exe on Win- dows . The mongod server process receives commands over a network socket using a custom binary protocol. All the data files for a mongod process are stored by default in  data db on Unix-like systems and in c:\data\db on Windows. Some of the examples in this text may be more Linux-oriented. Most of our MongoDB production servers are run on Linux because of its reliability, wide adoption, and excellent tools.  mongod can be run in several modes, such as a standalone server or a member of a replica set. Replication is recommended when you’re running MongoDB in produc- tion, and you generally see replica set configurations consisting of two replicas plus a mongod running in arbiter mode. When you use MongoDB’s sharding feature, you’ll also run mongod in config server mode. Finally, a separate routing server exists called mongos, which is used to send requests to the appropriate shard in this kind of setup. Don’t worry too much about all these options yet; we’ll describe each in detail in the replication  11  and sharding  12  chapters.   Configuring a mongod process is relatively simple; it can be accomplished both with command-line arguments and with a text configuration file. Some common configu- rations to change are setting the port that mongod listens on and setting the directory where it stores its data. To see these configurations, you can run mongod --help.  1.3.2  JavaScript shell The MongoDB command shell is a JavaScript6-based tool for administering the data- base and manipulating data. The mongo executable loads the shell and connects to a specified mongod process, or one running locally by default. The shell was developed to be similar to the MySQL shell; the biggest differences are that it’s based on Java- Script and SQL isn’t used. For instance, you can pick your database and then insert a simple document into the users collection like this:  > use my_database > db.users.insert {name: "Kyle"}   The  first  command,  indicating  which  database  you  want  to  use,  will  be  familiar  to users of MySQL. The second command is a JavaScript expression that inserts a simple document. To see the results of your insert, you can issue a simple query:  > db.users.find   { _id: ObjectId "4ba667b0a90578631c9caea0" , name: "Kyle" }  6 If  you’d  like  an  introduction  or  refresher  to  JavaScript,  a  good  resource  is  http:  eloquentjavascript.net. JavaScript has a syntax similar to languages like C or Java. If you’re familiar with either of those, you should be able to understand most of the JavaScript examples.   www.it-ebooks.info   1.3.3 Database drivers  MongoDB’s core server and tools  17  The find method returns the inserted document, with an object ID added. All docu- ments require a primary key stored in the _id field. You’re allowed to enter a custom _id as long as you can guarantee its uniqueness. But if you omit the _id altogether, a MongoDB object ID will be inserted automatically.   In addition to allowing you to insert and query for data, the shell permits you to run administrative commands. Some examples include viewing the current database operation, checking the status of replication to a secondary node, and configuring a collection  for  sharding.  As  you’ll  see,  the  MongoDB  shell  is  indeed  a  powerful  tool that’s worth getting to know well.   All that said, the bulk of your work with MongoDB will be done through an applica- tion written in a given programming language. To see how that’s done, we must say a few things about MongoDB’s language drivers.  If the notion of a database driver conjures up nightmares of low-level device hacking, don’t  fret;  the  MongoDB  drivers  are  easy  to  use.  The  driver  is  the  code  used  in  an application to communicate with a MongoDB server. All drivers have functionality to query, retrieve results, write data, and run database commands. Every effort has been made  to  provide  an  API  that  matches  the  idioms  of  the  given  language  while  also maintaining  relatively  uniform  interfaces  across  languages.  For  instance,  all  of  the drivers implement similar methods for saving a document to a collection, but the rep- resentation of the document itself will usually be whatever is most natural to each lan- guage. In Ruby, that means using a Ruby hash. In Python, a dictionary is appropriate. And in Java, which lacks any analogous language primitive, you usually represent doc- uments as a  Map object or something similar. Some developers like using an object- relational mapper to help manage representing their data this way, but in practice, the MongoDB drivers are complete enough that this isn’t required.  Language drivers As of this writing, MongoDB, Inc. officially supports drivers for C, C++, C, Erlang, Java, Node.js, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Scala, and Ruby—and the list is always growing. If you need support for another language, there are probably community- supported drivers for it, developed by MongoDB users but not officially managed by MongoDB, Inc., most of which are pretty good. If no community-supported driver exists for your language, specifications for building a new driver are documented at http:  mongodb.org. Because all of the officially supported drivers are used heavily in production and provided under the Apache license, plenty of good examples are freely available for would-be driver authors.  Beginning  in  chapter  3,  we  describe  how  the  drivers  work  and  how  to  use  them  to write programs.  www.it-ebooks.info   18  1.3.4  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  Command-line tools MongoDB is bundled with several command-line utilities:    mongodump and mongorestore—Standard utilities for backing up and restoring a database. mongodump saves the database’s data in its native BSON format and thus is best used for backups only; this tool has the advantage of being usable for hot backups, which can easily be restored with mongorestore.    mongoexport and mongoimport—Export and import JSON, CSV, and TSV7 data; this is useful if you need your data in widely supported formats. mongoimport can also be good for initial imports of large data sets, although before importing, it’s often desirable to adjust the data model to take best advantage of MongoDB. In such cases, it’s easier to import the data through one of the drivers using a custom script.    mongosniff—A wire-sniffing tool for viewing operations sent to the database. It essentially  translates  the  BSON  going  over  the  wire  to  human-readable  shell statements.    mongostat—Similar  to  iostat,  this  utility  constantly  polls  MongoDB  and  the system to provide helpful stats, including the number of operations per second  inserts, queries, updates, deletes, and so on , the amount of virtual memory allocated, and the number of connections to the server.    mongotop—Similar to top, this utility polls MongoDB and shows the amount of  time it spends reading and writing data in each collection.    mongoperf—Helps you understand the disk operations happening in a running  MongoDB instance.    mongooplog—Shows what’s happening in the MongoDB oplog.   Bsondump—Converts BSON files into human-readable formats including JSON.  We’ll cover BSON in much more detail in chapter 2.  1.4 Why MongoDB?  You’ve seen a few reasons why MongoDB might be a good choice for your projects. Here, we’ll make this more explicit, first by considering the overall design objectives of the MongoDB project. According to its creators, MongoDB was designed to combine the best features of key-value stores and relational databases. Because of their simplic- ity, key-value stores are extremely fast and relatively easy to scale. Relational databases are more difficult to scale, at least horizontally, but have a rich data model and a pow- erful query language. MongoDB is intended to be a compromise between these two designs, with useful aspects of both. The end goal is for it to be a database that scales easily, stores rich data structures, and provides sophisticated query mechanisms.  7 CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values, meaning data split into multiple fields, which are separated by com- mas. This is a popular format for representing tabular data, since column names and many rows of values can be listed in a readable file. TSV stands for Tab-Separated Values—the same format with tabs used instead of commas.  www.it-ebooks.info   Why MongoDB?  19   In terms of use cases, MongoDB is well-suited as a primary datastore for web appli- cations, analytics and logging applications, and any application requiring a medium- grade cache. In addition, because it easily stores schema-less data, MongoDB is also good for capturing data whose structure can’t be known in advance.   The preceding claims are bold. To substantiate them, we’re going to take a broad look at the varieties of databases currently in use and contrast them with MongoDB. Next, you’ll see some specific MongoDB use cases as well as examples of them in produc- tion. Then, we’ll discuss some important practical considerations for using MongoDB.  1.4.1 MongoDB versus other databases  The number of available databases has exploded, and weighing one against another can be difficult. Fortunately, most of these databases fall under one of a few catego- ries. In table 1.1, and in the sections that follow, we describe simple and sophisticated key-value stores, relational databases, and document databases, and show how these compare with MongoDB.  Table 1.1 Database families  Examples  Data model  Scalability model  Use cases  Simple key-value  stores  Memcached   Key-value, where  the value is a  binary blob.  Caching. Web ops.  Variable.

Limited support  for clustering and  manual partition- ing.  System requiring  transactions   banking, finance   or SQL. Normal- ized data model.  SIMPLE KEY-VALUE STORES Simple key-value stores do what their name implies: they index values based on a sup- plied key. A common use case is caching. For instance, suppose you needed to cache an HTML page rendered by your app. The key in this case might be the page’s URL, and the value would be the rendered HTML itself. Note that as far as a key-value store  www.it-ebooks.info   20  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  is concerned, the value is an opaque byte array. There’s no enforced schema, as you’d find in a relational database, nor is there any concept of data types. This naturally lim- its the operations permitted by key-value stores: you can insert a new value and then use its key either to retrieve that value or delete it. Systems with such simplicity are generally fast and scalable.   The best-known simple key-value store is Memcached, which stores its data in mem- ory only, so it trades durability for speed. It’s also distributed; Memcached nodes run- ning across multiple servers can act as a single datastore, eliminating the complexity of maintaining cache state across machines.    Compared  with  MongoDB,  a  simple  key-value  store  like  Memcached  will  often allow for faster reads and writes. But unlike MongoDB, these systems can rarely act as primary datastores. Simple key-value stores are best used as adjuncts, either as caching layers atop a more traditional database or as simple persistence layers for ephemeral services like job queues. SOPHISTICATED KEY-VALUE STORES It’s possible to refine the simple key-value model to handle complicated read write schemes or to provide a richer data model. In these cases, you end up with what we’ll term a sophisticated key-value store. One example is Amazon’s Dynamo, described in a  widely  studied  white  paper  titled  “Dynamo:  Amazon’s  Highly  Available  Key-Value Store”  http:  allthingsdistributed.com files amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf . The aim of Dynamo is to be a database robust enough to continue functioning in the face of network failures, datacenter outages, and similar disruptions. This requires that the system always be read from and written to, which essentially requires that data be auto- matically replicated across multiple nodes. If a node fails, a user of the system—per- haps in this case a customer with an Amazon shopping cart—won’t experience any interruptions  in  service.  Dynamo  provides  ways  of  resolving  the  inevitable  conflicts that arise when a system allows the same data to be written to multiple nodes. At the same time, Dynamo is easily scaled. Because it’s masterless—all nodes are equal—it’s easy to understand the system as a whole, and nodes can be added easily. Although Dynamo is a proprietary system, the ideas used to build it have inspired many systems falling under the NoSQL umbrella, including Cassandra, HBase, and Riak KV.   By looking at who developed these sophisticated key-value stores, and how they’ve been used in practice, you can see where these systems shine. Let’s take Cassandra, which implements many of Dynamo’s scaling properties while providing a column- oriented  data  model  inspired  by  Google’s  BigTable.  Cassandra  is  an  open  source version  of  a  datastore  built  by  Fac  for  its  inbox  search  feature.  The  system scales horizontally to index more than 50 TB of inbox data, allowing for searches on inbox keywords and recipients. Data is indexed by user ID, where each record consists of  an  array  of  search  terms  for  keyword  searches  and  an  array  of  recipient  IDs  for recipient searches.8  8 See “Cassandra: A Decentralized Structured Storage System,” at http:  mng.bz 5321.  www.it-ebooks.info   Why MongoDB?  21   These sophisticated key-value stores were developed by major internet companies  such  as  Amazon,  Google,  and  Fac  to  manage  cross-sections  of  systems  with extraordinarily large amounts of data. In other words, sophisticated key-value stores manage a relatively self-contained domain that demands significant storage and avail- ability.  Because  of  their  masterless  architecture,  these  systems  scale  easily  with  the addition of nodes. They opt for eventual consistency, which means that reads don’t necessarily reflect the latest write. But what users get in exchange for weaker consis- tency is the ability to write in the face of any one node’s failure.    This  contrasts  with  MongoDB,  which  provides  strong  consistency,  a  rich  data model, and secondary indexes. The last two of these attributes go hand in hand; key- value  stores  can  generally  store  any  data  structure  in  the  value,  but  the  database  is unable to query them unless these values can be indexed. You can fetch them with the primary key, or perhaps scan across all of the keys, but the database is useless for que- rying these without secondary indexes. RELATIONAL DATABASES Much has already been said of relational databases in this introduction, so in the inter- est of brevity, we need only discuss what RDBMSs  Relational Database Management Systems  have in common with MongoDB and where they diverge. Popular relational databases  include  MySQL,  PostgreSQL,  Microsoft  SQL  Server,  Oracle  Database,  IBM DB2, and so on; some are open-source and some are proprietary. MongoDB and rela- tional databases are both capable of representing a rich data model. Where relational databases use fixed-schema tables, MongoDB has schema-free documents. Most rela- tional databases support secondary indexes and aggregations.   Perhaps the biggest defining feature of relational databases from the user’s per- spective is the use of SQL as a query language. SQL is a powerful tool for working with data; it’s not perfect for every job, but in some cases it’s more expressive and easier to work with than MongoDB’s query language. Additionally, SQL is fairly portable between databases, though each implementation has its own quirks. One way to think about it is that SQL may be easier for a data scientist or full-time analyst who writes queries to explore data. MongoDB’s query language is aimed more at developers, who write a query  once  to  embed  it  in  their  application.  Both  models  have  their  strengths  and weaknesses, and sometimes it comes down to personal preference.   There are also many relational databases intended for analytics  or as a “data ware- house”  rather than as an application database. Usually data is imported in bulk to these  platforms  and  then  queried  by  analysts  to  answer  business-intelligence  ques- tions. This area is dominated by enterprise vendors with HP Vertica or Teradata Data- base, which both offer horizontally scalable SQL databases.    There  is  also  growing  interest  in  running  SQL  queries  over  data  stored  in Hadoop. Apache Hive is a widely used tool that translates a SQL query into a Map- Reduce job, which offers a scalable way of querying large data sets. These queries use the relational model, but are intended only for slower analytics queries, not for use inside an application.  www.it-ebooks.info   22  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  1.4.2 Use cases and production deployments  DOCUMENT DATABASES Few databases identify themselves as document databases. As of this writing, the clos- est open-source database comparable to MongoDB is Apache’s CouchDB. CouchDB’s document  model  is  similar,  although  data  is  stored  in  plain  text  as  JSON,  whereas MongoDB uses the BSON binary format. Like MongoDB, CouchDB supports secondary indexes; the difference is that the indexes in CouchDB are defined by writing map- reduce  functions,  a  process  that’s  more  involved  than  using  the  declarative  syntax used by MySQL and MongoDB. They also scale differently. CouchDB doesn’t partition data across machines; rather, each CouchDB node is a complete replica of every other.  Let’s be honest. You’re not going to choose a database solely on the basis of its fea- tures. You need to know that real businesses are using it successfully. Let’s look at a few broadly defined use cases for MongoDB and some examples of its use in production.9 WEB APPLICATIONS MongoDB is well-suited as a primary datastore for web applications. Even a simple web application will require numerous data models for managing users, sessions, app-specific data, uploads, and permissions, to say nothing of the overarching domain. Just as this aligns well with the tabular approach provided by relational databases, so too it bene- fits from MongoDB’s collection and document model. And because documents can represent rich data structures, the number of collections needed will usually be less than the number of tables required to model the same data using a fully normalized relational model. In addition, dynamic queries and secondary indexes allow for the easy  implementation  of  most  queries  familiar  to  SQL  developers.  Finally,  as  a  web application grows, MongoDB provides a clear path for scale.   MongoDB can be a useful tool for powering a high-traffic website. This is the case with The Business Insider  TBI , which has used MongoDB as its primary datastore since January 2008. TBI is a news site, although it gets substantial traffic, serving more than a million unique page views per day. What’s interesting in this case is that in addition to handling the site’s main content  posts, comments, users, and so on , MongoDB processes and stores real-time analytics data. These analytics are used by TBI to gener- ate dynamic heat maps indicating click-through rates for the various news stories. AGILE DEVELOPMENT Regardless of what you may think about the agile development movement, it’s hard to deny  the  desirability  of  building  an  application  quickly.  A  number  of  development teams,  including  those  from  Shutterfly  and  The  New  York  Times,  have  chosen MongoDB  in  part  because  they  can  develop  applications  much  more  quickly  on  it than  on  relational  databases.  One  obvious  reason  for  this  is  that  MongoDB  has  no fixed schema, so all the time spent committing, communicating, and applying schema changes is saved.  9 For an up-to-date list of MongoDB production deployments, see http:  mng.bz z2CH.   www.it-ebooks.info   Why MongoDB?  23   In addition, less time need be spent shoehorning the relational representation of data into an object-oriented data model or dealing with the vagaries and optimizing the SQL produced by object-relational mapping  ORM  technology. Thus, MongoDB often complements projects with shorter development cycles and agile, mid-sized teams. ANALYTICS AND LOGGING We alluded earlier to the idea that MongoDB works well for analytics and logging, and the number of applications using MongoDB for these is growing. Often, a well- established company will begin its forays into the MongoDB world with special apps dedicated  to  analytics.  Some  of  these  companies  include  GitHub,  Disqus,  Justin.tv, and Gilt Groupe, among others.   MongoDB’s relevance to analytics derives from its speed and from two key features: targeted atomic updates and capped collections. Atomic updates let clients efficiently increment  counters  and  push  values  onto  arrays.  Capped  collections  are  useful  for logging because they store only the most recent documents. Storing logging data in a database, as compared with the filesystem, provides easier organization and greater query power. Now, instead of using grep or a custom log search utility, users can employ the MongoDB query language to examine log output. CACHING Many  web-applications  use  a  layer  of  caching  to  help  deliver  content  faster.  A  data model that allows for a more holistic representation of objects  it’s easy to shove a doc- ument  into  MongoDB  without  worrying  much  about  the  structure ,  combined  with faster average query speeds, frequently allows MongoDB to be run as a cache with richer query capabilities, or to do away with the caching layer all together. The Business Insider, for example, was able to dispense with Memcached, serving page requests directly from MongoDB. VARIABLE SCHEMAS You can get some sample JSON data from https:  dev.twitter.com rest tools console, provided  that  you  know  how  to  use  it.  After  getting  the  data  and  saving  it  as  sam- ple.json, you can import it to MongoDB as follows:  $ cat sample.json  mongoimport -c tweets 2015-08-28T11:48:27.584+0300       connected to: localhost 2015-08-28T11:48:27.660+0300       imported 1 document  Here you’re pulling down a small sample of a Twitter stream and piping that directly into a MongoDB collection. Because the stream produces JSON documents, there’s no need to alter the data before sending it to the database. The mongoimport tool directly translates  the  data  to  BSON.  This  means  that  each  tweet  is  stored  with  its  structure intact, as a separate document in the collection. This makes it easy to index and query its content with no need to declare the structure of the data in advance.   If your application needs to consume a JSON API, then having a system that so eas- ily translates JSON is invaluable. It’s difficult to know the structure of your data before you store it, and MongoDB’s lack of schema constraints may simplify your data model.   www.it-ebooks.info   24  1.5  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  Tips and limitations For all these good features, it’s worth keeping in mind a system’s trade-offs and limita- tions. We’d like to note some limitations before you start building a real-world applica- tion on MongoDB and running it in production. Many of these are consequences of how  MongoDB  manages  data  and  moves  it  between  disk  and  memory  in  memory- mapped files.    First, MongoDB should usually be run on 64-bit machines. The processes in a 32-bit system are only capable of addressing 4  GB of memory. This means that as soon as your data set, including metadata and storage overhead, hits 4 GB, MongoDB will no longer  be  able  to  store  additional  data.  Most  production  systems  will  require  more than this, so a 64-bit system will be necessary.10   A second consequence of using virtual memory mapping is that memory for the data will be allocated automatically, as needed. This makes it trickier to run the data- base in a shared environment. As with database servers in general, MongoDB is best run on a dedicated server.    Perhaps  the  most  important  thing  to  know  about  MongoDB’s  use  of  memory- mapped files is how it affects data sets that exceed the size of available RAM. When you query such a data set, it often requires a disk access for data that has been swapped out of memory. The consequence is that many users report excellent MongoDB perfor- mance until the working set of their data exceeds memory and queries slow signifi- cantly.  This  problem  isn’t  exclusive  to  MongoDB,  but  it’s  a  common  pitfall  and something to watch.   A related problem is that the data structures MongoDB uses to store its collections and  documents  aren’t  terribly  efficient  from  a  data-size  perspective.  For  example, MongoDB stores the document keys in each document. This means that every docu- ment with a field named ‘username’ will use 8 bytes to store the name of the field.    An oft-cited pain-point with MongoDB from SQL developers is that its query lan- guage isn’t as familiar or easy as writing SQL queries, and this is certainly true in some cases. MongoDB has been more explicitly targeted at developers—not analysts—than most databases. Its philosophy is that a query is something you write once and embed in your application. As you’ll see, MongoDB queries are generally composed of JSON objects rather than text strings as in SQL. This makes them simpler to create and parse programmatically, which can be an important consideration, but may be more diffi- cult to change for ad-hoc queries. If you’re an analyst who writes queries all day, you’ll probably prefer working with SQL.   Finally, it’s worth mentioning that although MongoDB is one of the simplest data- bases to run locally as a single node, there’s a maintenance cost to running a large cluster. This is true of most distributed databases, but it’s acute with MongoDB because it requires a cluster of three configuration nodes and handles replication separately  10 64-bit architectures can theoretically address up to 16 exabytes of memory, which is for all intents and pur-  poses unlimited.  www.it-ebooks.info   1.6  History of MongoDB  25  with sharding. In some databases, such as HBase, data is grouped into shards that can be replicated on any machine of the cluster. MongoDB instead allows shards of replica sets,  meaning  that  a  piece  of  data  is  replicated  only  within  its  replica  set.  Keeping sharding and replication as separate concepts has certain advantages, but also means that each must be configured and managed when you set up a MongoDB cluster.   Let’s have a quick look at the other changes that have happened in MongoDB.   History of MongoDB When the first edition of MongoDB in Action was released, MongoDB 1.8.x was the most recent stable version, with version 2.0.0 just around the corner. With this second edi- tion, 3.0.x is the latest stable version.11    A list of the biggest changes in each of the official versions is shown below. You should always use the most recent version available, if possible, in which case this list isn’t particularly useful. If not, this list may help you determine how your version dif- fers from the content of this book. This is by no means an exhaustive list, and because of space constraints, we’ve listed only the top four or five items for each release.  VERSION 1.8.X  NO LONGER OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED     Sharding—Sharding was moved from “experimental” to production-ready status.    Replica sets—Replica sets were made production-ready.    Replica pairs deprecated—Replica set pairs are no longer supported by MongoDB, Inc.   Geo search—Two-dimensional geo-indexing with coordinate pairs  2D indexes   was introduced.   VERSION 2.0.X  NO LONGER OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED      Journaling  enabled  by  default—This  version  changed  the  default  for  new  data- bases to enable journaling. Journaling is an important function that prevents data corruption.     $and queries—This version added the $and query operator to complement the  $or operator.    Sparse indexes—Previous versions of MongoDB included nodes in an index for every document, even if the document didn’t contain any of the fields being tracked by the index. Sparse indexing adds only document nodes that have rel- evant fields. This feature significantly reduces index size. In some cases this can improve performance because smaller indexes can result in more efficient use of memory.     Replica set priorities—This version allows “weighting” of replica set members to  ensure that your best servers get priority when electing a new primary server.     Collection  level  compact repair—Previously  you  could  perform  compact repair  only on a database; this enhancement extends it to individual collections.   11 MongoDB actually had a version jump from 2.6 straight to 3.0, skipping 2.8. See http:  www.mongodb.com   blog post announcing-mongodb-30 for more details about v3.0.  www.it-ebooks.info   26  CHAPTER 1 A database for the modern web  VERSION 2.2.X  NO LONGER OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED      Aggregation  framework—This  version  features  the  first  iteration  of  a  facility  to make analysis and transformation of data much easier and more efficient. In many respects this facility takes over where map reduce leaves off; it’s built on a pipeline paradigm, instead of the map reduce model  which some find diffi- cult to grasp .     TTL collections—Collections in which the documents have a time-limited lifespan are introduced to allow you to create caching models such as those provided by Memcached.     DB level locking—This version adds database level locking to take the place of the global lock, which improves the write concurrency by allowing multiple opera- tions to happen simultaneously on different databases.     Tag-aware sharding—This version allows nodes to be tagged with IDs that reflect their physical location. In this way, applications can control where data is stored in clusters, thus increasing efficiency  read-only nodes reside in the same data center   and  reducing  legal  jurisdiction  issues   you  store  data  required  to remain in a specific country only on servers in that country .   VERSION 2.4.X  OLDEST STABLE RELEASE     Enterprise version—The first subscriber-only edition of MongoDB, the Enterprise version of MongoDB includes an additional authentication module that allows the use of Kerberos authentication systems to manage database login data. The free version has all the other features of the Enterprise version.    Aggregation framework performance—Improvements are made in the performance of the aggregation framework to support real-time analytics; chapter 6 explores the Aggregation framework.     Text search—An enterprise-class search solution is integrated as an experimental  feature in MongoDB; chapter 9 explores the new text search features.     Enhancements to geospatial indexing—This version includes support for polygon intersection queries and GeoJSON, and features an improved spherical model supporting ellipsoids.

To  summarize,  MongoDB  is  an  open  source,  document-based database management system. Designed for the data and scalability requirements of modern  internet  applications,  MongoDB  features  dynamic  queries  and  secondary indexes, fast atomic updates and complex aggregations, and support for replication with automatic failover and sharding for scaling horizontally.   That’s a mouthful, but if you’ve read this far, you should have a good feel for all these capabilities. You’re probably itching to code. It’s one thing to talk about a data- base’s features, but another to use the database in practice. Fortunately, that’s what you’ll  do  in  the  next  two  chapters.  First,  you’ll  get  acquainted  with  the  MongoDB JavaScript shell, which is incredibly useful for interacting with the database. Then, in chapter  3  you’ll  start  experimenting  with  the  driver  and  build  a  simple  MongoDB- based application in Ruby.  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  This chapter covers   Using CRUD operations in the MongoDB shell   Building indexes and using explain     Understanding basic administration   Getting help  The  previous  chapter  hinted  at  the  experience  of  running  MongoDB.  If  you’re ready for a more hands-on introduction, this is it. Using the MongoDB shell, this chapter teaches the database’s basic concepts through a series of exercises. You’ll learn how to create, read, update, and delete  CRUD  documents and, in the pro- cess, get to know MongoDB’s query language. In addition, we’ll take a preliminary look  at  database  indexes  and  how  they’re  used  to  optimize  queries.  Then  we’ll explore  some  basic  administrative  commands  and  suggest  a  few  ways  of  getting help as you continue working with MongoDB’s shell. Think of this chapter as both an elaboration of the concepts already introduced and as a practical tour of the most common tasks performed from the MongoDB shell.    The  MongoDB  shell  is  the  go-to  tool  for  experimenting  with  the  database, running ad-hoc queries, and administering running MongoDB instances. When you’re writing an application that uses MongoDB, you’ll use a language driver  like  29  www.it-ebooks.info   30  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  MongoDB’s Ruby gem  rather than the shell, but the shell is likely where you’ll test and refine these queries. Any and all MongoDB queries can be run from the shell.   If you’re completely new to MongoDB’s shell, know that it provides all the features that you’d expect of such a tool; it allows you to examine and manipulate data and administer the database server itself. MongoDB’s shell differs from others, however, in its query language. Instead of employing a standardized query language such as SQL, you interact with the server using the JavaScript programming language and a simple API. This means that you can write JavaScript scripts in the shell that interact with a MongoDB database. If you’re not familiar with JavaScript, rest assured that only a super- ficial knowledge of the language is necessary to take advantage of the shell, and all examples in this chapter will be explained thoroughly. The MongoDB API in the shell is similar to most of the language drivers, so it’s easy to take queries you write in the shell and run them from your application.   You’ll benefit most from this chapter if you follow along with the examples, but to do that, you’ll need to have MongoDB installed on your system. You’ll find installation instructions in appendix A.  Diving into the MongoDB shell MongoDB’s JavaScript shell makes it easy to play with data and get a tangible sense of documents,  collections,  and  the  database’s  particular  query  language.  Think  of  the following walkthrough as a practical introduction to MongoDB.   You’ll begin by getting the shell up and running. Then you’ll see how JavaScript represents documents, and you’ll learn how to insert these documents into a MongoDB collection. To verify these inserts, you’ll practice querying the collection. Then it’s on to updates. Finally, we’ll finish out the CRUD operations by learning to remove data and drop collections.  2.1  2.1.1  Starting the shell Follow the instructions in appendix A and you should quickly have a working MongoDB installation  on  your  computer,  as  well  as  a  running  mongod  instance.  Once  you  do, start the MongoDB shell by running the mongo executable:  mongo  If the shell program starts successfully, your screen will look like figure 2.1. The shell heading displays the version of MongoDB you’re running, along with some additional information about the currently selected database.  Figure 2.1 MongoDB  JavaScript shell on startup  www.it-ebooks.info   Diving into the MongoDB shell  31  If you know some JavaScript, you can start entering code and exploring the shell right away. In either case, read on to see how to run your first operations against MongoDB.  2.1.2 Databases, collections, and documents  As you probably know by now, MongoDB stores its information in documents, which can be printed out in JSON  JavaScript Object Notation  format. You’d probably like to store different types of documents, like users and orders, in separate places. This means  that  MongoDB  needs  a  way  to  group  documents,  similar  to  a  table  in  an RDBMS. In MongoDB, this is called a collection.    MongoDB  divides  collections  into  separate  databases.  Unlike  the  usual  overhead that databases produce in the SQL world, databases in MongoDB are just namespaces to distinguish between collections. To query MongoDB, you’ll need to know the data- base   or  namespace   and  collection  you  want  to  query  for  documents.  If  no  other database is specified on startup, the shell selects a default database called test. As a way of keeping all the subsequent tutorial exercises under the same namespace, let’s start by switching to the tutorial database:  > use tutorial switched to db tutorial  You’ll see a message verifying that you’ve switched databases.   Why does MongoDB have both databases and collections? The answer lies in how MongoDB writes its data out to disk. All collections in a database are grouped in the same files, so it makes sense, from a memory perspective, to keep related collections in the same database. You might also want to have different applications access the same collections  multitenancy  and, it’s also useful to keep your data organized so you’re prepared for future requirements.  On creating databases and collections You may be wondering how you can switch to the tutorial database without explicitly creating it. In fact, creating the database isn’t required. Databases and collections are created only when documents are first inserted. This behavior is consistent with MongoDB’s dynamic approach to data; just as the structure of documents needn’t be defined in advance, individual collections and databases can be created at run- time. This can lead to a simplified and accelerated development process. That said, if you’re concerned about databases or collections being created accidentally, most of the drivers let you enable a strict mode to prevent such careless errors.  It’s time to create your first document. Because you’re using a JavaScript shell, your documents will be specified in  JSON. For instance, a simple document describing a user might look like this:  {username: "smith"}  www.it-ebooks.info   32  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  The document contains a single key and value for storing Smith’s username.   2.1.3  Inserts and queries  To save this document, you need to choose a collection to save it to. Appropriately enough, you’ll save it to the users collection. Here’s how:  > db.users.insert {username: "smith"}  WriteResult { "nInserted" : 1 }   NOTE Note that in our examples, we’ll preface MongoDB shell commands with a > so that you can tell the difference between the command and its output.  You may notice a slight delay after entering this code. At this point, neither the tuto- rial database nor the users collection has been created on disk. The delay is caused by the allocation of the initial data files for both.   If the insert succeeds, you’ve just saved your first document. In the default MongoDB configuration, this data is now guaranteed to be inserted even if you kill the shell or suddenly restart your machine. You can issue a query to see the new document:  > db.users.find    Since the data is now part of the users collection, reopening the shell and running the query will show the same result. The response will look something like this:  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith" }  _ID FIELDS IN MONGODB Note  that  an  _id  field  has  been  added  to  the  document.  You  can  think  of  the  _id value as the document’s primary key. Every MongoDB document requires an _id, and if one isn’t present when the document is created, a special MongoDB ObjectID will be generated and added to the document at that time. The ObjectID that appears in your console won’t be the same as the one in the code listing, but it will be unique among all _id values in the collection, which is the only requirement for the field. You can set your own  _id by setting it in the document you insert, the  ObjectID is just MongoDB’s default.   We’ll have more to say about ObjectIDs in the next chapter. Let’s continue for now  by adding a second user to the collection:  > db.users.insert {username: "jones"}  WriteResult { "nInserted" : 1 }   There should now be two documents in the collection. Go ahead and verify this by running the count command:  > db.users.count   2   www.it-ebooks.info   Diving into the MongoDB shell  33  PASS A QUERY PREDICATE Now  that  you  have  more  than  one  document  in  the  collection,  let’s  look  at  some slightly  more  sophisticated  queries.  As  before,  you  can  still  query  for  all  the  docu- ments in the collection:  > db.users.find   { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith" } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e542a58cd52bcb257c325" , "username" : "jones" }  You can also pass a simple query selector to the  find method. A query selector is a document that’s used to match against all documents in the collection. To query for all documents where the username is jones, you pass a simple document that acts as your query selector like this:  > db.users.find {username: "jones"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e542a58cd52bcb257c325" , "username" : "jones" }  The  query  predicate  {username:  "jones"}  returns  all  documents  where  the  user- name is jones—it literally matches against the existing documents.   Note that calling the find method without any argument is equivalent to passing in  an empty predicate; db.users.find   is the same as db.users.find {} .    You  can  also  specify  multiple  fields  in  the  query  predicate,  which  creates  an  implicit AND among the fields. For example, you query with the following selector:  > db.users.find { ... _id: ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , ... username: "smith" ... }  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith" }  The three dots after the first line of the query are added by the MongoDB shell to indi- cate that the command takes more than one line.   The query predicate is identical to the returned document. The predicate ANDs the fields, so this query searches for a document that matches on both the _id and username fields.   You can also use MongoDB’s $and operator explicitly. The previous query is identi-  cal to  > db.users.find { $and: [ ... { _id: ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324"  }, ... { username: "smith" } ... ] }  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith" }  Selecting documents with an OR is similar: just use the $or operator. Consider the fol- lowing query:  > db.users.find { $or: [ ... { username: "smith" },  www.it-ebooks.info   34  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  ... { username: "jones" } ... ]}  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith" } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e542a58cd52bcb257c325" , "username" : "jones" }  The query returns both the smith and jones documents, because we asked for either a username of smith or a username of jones.    This  example  is  different  than  previous  ones,  because  it  doesn’t  just  insert  or search for a specific document. Rather, the query itself is a document. The idea of rep- resenting commands as documents is used often in MongoDB and may come as a sur- prise if you’re used to relational databases. One advantage of this interface is that it’s easier  to  build  queries  programmatically  in  your  application  because  they’re  docu- ments rather than a long SQL string.    We’ve presented the basics of creating and reading data. Now it’s time to look at  how to update that data.  2.1.4 Updating documents  All  updates  require  at  least  two  arguments.  The  first  specifies  which  documents  to update, and the second defines how the selected documents should be modified. The first few examples demonstrate modifying a single document, but the same operations can be applied to many documents, even an entire collection, as we show at the end of this  section.  But  keep  in  mind  that  by  default  the update   method  updates  a sin- gle document.   There are two general types of updates, with different properties and use cases. One type of update involves applying modification operations to a document or docu- ments, and the other type involves replacing the old document with a new one.   For the following examples, we’ll look at this sample document:  > db.users.find {username: "smith"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith" }  OPERATOR UPDATE The  first  type  of  update  involves  passing  a  document  with  some  kind  of  operator description as the second argument to the update function. In this section, you’ll see an example of how to use the $set operator, which sets a single field to the spec- ified value.   Suppose that user Smith decides to add her country of residence. You can record  this with the following update:  > db.users.update {username: "smith"}, {$set: {country: "Canada"}}  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }   This  update  tells  MongoDB  to  find  a  document  where  the  username  is  smith,  and then to set the value of the country property to Canada. You see the change reflected  www.it-ebooks.info   Diving into the MongoDB shell  35  in the message that gets sent back by the server. If you now issue a query, you’ll see that the document has been updated accordingly:  > db.users.find {username: "smith"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith",   "country" : "Canada" }  REPLACEMENT UPDATE Another way to update a document is to replace it rather than just set a field. This is sometimes mistakenly used when an operator update with a $set was intended. Con- sider a slightly different update command:   > db.users.update {username: "smith"}, {country: "Canada"}  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }   In this case, the document is replaced with one that only contains the country field, and the username field is removed because the first document is used only for match- ing and the second document is used for replacing the document that was previously matched. You should be careful when you use this kind of update. A query for the doc- ument yields the following:  > db.users.find {country: "Canada"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "country" : "Canada" }  The _id is the same, yet data has been replaced in the update. Be sure to use the $set operator if you intend to add or set fields rather than to replace the entire document. Add the username back to the record:  > db.users.update {country: "Canada"}, {$set: {username: "smith"}}  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }  > db.users.find {country: "Canada"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "country" : "Canada",   "username" : "smith" }  If you later decide that the country stored in the profile is no longer needed, the value can be removed as easily using the $unset operator:  > db.users.update {username: "smith"}, {$unset: {country: 1}}  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }  > db.users.find {username: "smith"}  { "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" , "username" : "smith" }  UPDATING COMPLEX DATA Let’s enrich this example. You’re representing your data with documents, which, as you saw in chapter 1, can contain complex data structures. Let’s suppose that, in addi- tion to storing profile information, your users can store lists of their favorite things. A good document representation might look something like this:  {    username: "smith",   favorites: {  www.it-ebooks.info   36  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell      cities: ["Chicago", "Cheyenne"],     movies: ["Casablanca", "For a Few Dollars More", "The Sting"]   } }  The favorites key points to an object containing two other keys, which point to lists of favorite cities and movies. Given what you know already, can you think of a way to modify the original smith document to look like this? The $set operator should come to mind:  > db.users.update  {username: "smith"}, ...   { ...     $set: { ...       favorites: { ...         cities: ["Chicago", "Cheyenne"], ...         movies: ["Casablanca", "For a Few Dollars More", "The Sting"] ...      } ...     } ...   }  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }   Please note that the use of spacing for indenting isn’t mandatory, but it helps avoid errors as the document is more readable this way.   Let’s modify jones similarly, but in this case you’ll only add a couple of favorite movies:  > db.users.update  {username: "jones"}, ...   { ...     $set: { ...       favorites: { ...         movies: ["Casablanca", "Rocky"] ...       } ...     } ...   }  WriteResult { "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 }   If you make a typo, you can use the up arrow key to recall the last shell statement.   Now query the users collection to make sure that both updates succeeded:  > > db.users.find  .pretty   {     "_id" : ObjectId "552e458158cd52bcb257c324" ,     "username" : "smith",     "favorites" : {         "cities" : [             "Chicago",             "Cheyenne"         ],         "movies" : [             "Casablanca",             "For a Few Dollars More",             "The Sting"         ]     } }  www.it-ebooks.info   Diving into the MongoDB shell  37  {     "_id" : ObjectId "552e542a58cd52bcb257c325" ,     "username" : "jones",     "favorites" : {         "movies" : [             "Casablanca",             "Rocky"         ]     } }  Strictly speaking, the find   command returns a cursor to the returning documents. Therefore, to access the documents you’ll need to iterate the cursor. The find   com- mand  automatically  returns  20  documents—if  they’re  available—after  iterating  the cursor 20 times.   With a couple of example documents at your fingertips, you can now begin to see the power of MongoDB’s query language. In particular, the query engine’s ability to reach into nested inner objects and match against array elements proves useful in this situation. Notice how we appended the pretty operation to the find operation to get nicely formatted results returned by the server. Strictly speaking, pretty   is actually cursor.pretty  , which is a way of configuring a cursor to display results in an easy- to-read format.   You can see an example of both of these concepts demonstrated in this query to  find all users who like the movie Casablanca:   > db.users.find {"favorites.movies": "Casablanca"}   The dot between favorites and movies instructs the query engine to look for a key named  favorites  that  points  to  an  object  with  an  inner  key  named  movies  and then to match the value of the inner key. Thus, this query will return both user doc- uments because queries on arrays will match if any element in the array matches the original query.   To see a more involved example, suppose you know that any user who likes Casa- blanca also likes The Maltese Falcon and that you want to update your database to reflect this fact. How would you represent this as a MongoDB update?  MORE ADVANCED UPDATES You could conceivably use the $set operator again, but doing so would require you to rewrite and send the entire array of movies. Because all you want to do is to add an ele- ment to the list, you’re better off using either $push or $addToSet. Both operators add an item to an array, but the second does so uniquely, preventing a duplicate addition. This is the update you’re looking for:  > db.users.update  {"favorites.movies": "Casablanca"}, ...     {$addToSet: {"favorites.movies": "The Maltese Falcon"} }, ...           false, ...           true   WriteResult { "nMatched" : 2, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 2 }   www.it-ebooks.info   38  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  2.1.5 Deleting data  Most of this should be decipherable by now. The first argument is a query predicate that matches against users who have Casablanca in their movies list. The second argu- ment adds The Maltese Falcon to that list using the $addToSet operator.   The third argument, false, controls whether an upsert is allowed. This tells the update  operation  whether  it  should  insert  a  document  if  it  doesn’t  already  exist, which has different behavior depending on whether the update is an operator update or a replacement update.   The fourth argument, true, indicates that this is a multi-update. By default, a Mon- goDB update operation will apply only to the first document matched by the query selector. If you want the operation to apply to all documents matched, you must be explicit about that. You want your update to apply to both smith and jones, so the multi-update is necessary.   We’ll cover updates in more detail later, but try these examples before moving on.  Now you know the basics of creating, reading, and updating data through the Mon- goDB shell. We’ve saved the simplest operation, removing data, for last.   If given no parameters, a remove operation will clear a collection of all its docu-  ments. To get rid of, say, a foo collection’s contents, you enter:  > db.foo.remove    You often need to remove only a certain subset of a collection’s documents, and for that, you can pass a query selector to the remove   method. If you want to remove all users whose favorite city is Cheyenne, the expression is straightforward:  > db.users.remove {"favorites.cities": "Cheyenne"}  WriteResult { "nRemoved" : 1 }   Note  that  the  remove    operation  doesn’t  actually  delete  the  collection;  it  merely removes documents from a collection. You can think of it as being analogous to SQL’s DELETE command.   If your intent is to delete the collection along with all of its indexes, use the drop    method:  > db.users.drop    Creating, reading, updating, and deleting are the basic operations of any database; if you’ve followed along, you should be in a position to continue practicing basic CRUD operations in MongoDB. In the next section, you’ll learn how to enhance your que- ries, updates, and deletes by taking a brief look at secondary indexes.   2.1.6 Other shell features  You may have noticed this already, but the shell does a lot of things to make working with  MongoDB  easier.  You  can  revisit  earlier  commands  by  using  the  up  and  down  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating and querying with indexes  39  arrows, and use autocomplete for certain inputs, like collection names. The autocom- plete feature uses the tab key to autocomplete or to list the completion possibilities.1 You can also discover more information in the shell by typing this:  > help  A lot of functions print pretty help messages that explain them as well. Try it out:  > db.help   DB methods:     db.adminCommand nameOrDocument  - switches to 'admin' db, and runs   command [ just calls db.runCommand ...  ]      db.auth username, password      db.cloneDatabase fromhost      db.commandHelp name  returns the help for the command     db.copyDatabase fromdb, todb, fromhost  …  Help on queries is provided through a different function called explain, which we’ll investigate  in  later  sections.  There  are  also  a  number  of  options  you  can  use  when starting the MongoDB shell. To display a list of these, add the help flag when you start the MongoDB shell:  $ mongo --help  You don’t need to worry about all these features, and we’re not done working with the shell yet, but it’s worth knowing where you can find more information when you need it.  2.2  Creating and querying with indexes It’s common to create indexes to enhance query performance. Fortunately, MongoDB’s indexes can be created easily from the shell. If you’re new to database indexes, this section  should  make  the  need  for  them  clear;  if  you  already  have  indexing  experi- ence, you’ll see how easy it is to create indexes and then profile queries against them using the explain   method.  2.2.1  Creating a large collection An indexing example makes sense only if you have a collection with many documents. So you’ll add 20,000 simple documents to a numbers collection. Because the MongoDB shell is also a JavaScript interpreter, the code to accomplish this is simple:  > for i = 0; i < 20000; i++  {     db.numbers.save {num: i} ;   } WriteResult { "nInserted" : 1 }   1 For  the  full  list  of  keyboard  shortcuts,  please  visit  http:  docs.mongodb.org v3.0 reference program   mongo mongo-keyboard-shortcuts.   www.it-ebooks.info   40  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  That’s a lot of documents, so don’t be surprised if the insert takes a few seconds to complete. Once it returns, you can run a couple of queries to verify that all the docu- ments are present:  > db.numbers.count   20000 > db.numbers.find   { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac830a" , "num": 0 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac830b" , "num": 1 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac830c" , "num": 2 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac830d" , "num": 3 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac830e" , "num": 4 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac830f" , "num": 5 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8310" , "num": 6 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8311" , "num": 7 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8312" , "num": 8 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8313" , "num": 9 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8314" , "num": 10 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8315" , "num": 11 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8316" , "num": 12 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8317" , "num": 13 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8318" , "num": 14 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8319" , "num": 15 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac831a" , "num": 16 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac831b" , "num": 17 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac831c" , "num": 18 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac831d" , "num": 19 } Type "it" for more  The  count    command  shows  that  you’ve  inserted  20,000  documents.  The  subse- quent query displays the first 20 results  this number may be different in your shell . You can display additional results with the it command:  > it { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac831e" , "num": 20 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac831f" , "num": 21 } { "_id": ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac8320" , "num": 22 } ...  The it command instructs the shell to return the next result set.2   With a sizable set of documents available, let’s try a couple queries. Given what you know about MongoDB’s query engine, a simple query matching a document on its num attribute makes sense:  > db.numbers.find {num: 500}  { "_id" : ObjectId "4bfbf132dba1aa7c30ac84fe" , "num" : 500 }  2 You may be wondering what’s happening behind the scenes here. All queries create a cursor, which allows for iteration over a result set. This is somewhat hidden when using the shell, so it isn’t necessary to discuss in detail at the moment. If you can’t wait to learn more about cursors and their idiosyncrasies, see chapters 3 and 4.  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating and querying with indexes  41  RANGE QUERIES More  interestingly,  you  can  also  issue  range  queries  using  the  special  $gt  and  $lt operators.  They  stand  for  greater  than  and  less  than,  respectively.  Here’s  how  you query for all documents with a num value greater than 199,995:  > db.numbers.find  {num: {"$gt": 19995 }}   { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660b58cd52bcb2581142" , "num" : 19996 } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660b58cd52bcb2581143" , "num" : 19997 } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660b58cd52bcb2581144" , "num" : 19998 } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660b58cd52bcb2581145" , "num" : 19999 }  You can also combine the two operators to specify upper and lower boundaries:  > db.numbers.find  {num: {"$gt": 20, "$lt": 25 }}   { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660558cd52bcb257c33b" , "num" : 21 } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660558cd52bcb257c33c" , "num" : 22 } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660558cd52bcb257c33d" , "num" : 23 } { "_id" : ObjectId "552e660558cd52bcb257c33e" , "num" : 24 }  You  can  see  that  by  using  a  simple  JSON  document,  you’re  able  to  specify  a  range query in much the same way you might in SQL. $gt and $lt are only two of a host of operators that comprise the MongoDB query language. Others include $gte for greater than or equal to, $lte for  you guessed it  less than or equal to, and $ne for not equal to. You’ll see other operators and many more example queries in later chapters.   Of course, queries like this are of little value unless they’re also efficient. In the next  section,  we’ll  start  thinking  about  query  efficiency  by  exploring  MongoDB’s indexing features.  If you’ve spent time working with relational databases, you’re probably familiar with SQL’s  EXPLAIN,  an  invaluable  tool  for  debugging  or  optimizing  a  query.  When  any database  receives  a  query,  it  must  plan  out  how  to  execute  it;  this  is  called  a  query plan.  EXPLAIN  describes  query  paths  and  allows  developers  to  diagnose  slow  opera- tions by determining which indexes a query has used. Often a query can be executed in  multiple  ways,  and  sometimes  this  results  in  behavior  you  might  not  expect. EXPLAIN explains. MongoDB has its own version of EXPLAIN that provides the same ser- vice. To get an idea of how it works, let’s apply it to one of the queries you just issued. Try running the following on your system:  > db.numbers.find {num: {"$gt": 19995}} .explain "executionStats"   The result should look something like what you see in the next listing. The "execution- Stats" keyword is new to MongoDB 3.0 and requests a different mode that gives more detailed output.  2.2.2  Indexing and explain     www.it-ebooks.info   42  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  Listing 2.1 Typical explain "executionStats"  output for an unindexed query  {     "queryPlanner" : {         "plannerVersion" : 1,         "namespace" : "tutorial.numbers",         "indexFilterSet" : false,         "parsedQuery" : {             "num" : {                     "$gt" : 19995             }         },         "winningPlan" : {             "stage" : "COLLSCAN",             "filter" : {                 "num" : {                     "$gt" : 19995                 }             },             "direction" : "forward"         },         "rejectedPlans" : [ ]     },     "executionStats" : {         "executionSuccess" : true,         "nReturned" : 4,         "executionTimeMillis" : 8,         "totalKeysExamined" : 0,         "totalDocsExamined" : 20000,         "executionStages" : {             "stage" : "COLLSCAN",             "filter" : {                 "num" : {                     "$gt" : 19995                 }             },             "nReturned" : 4,             "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,             "works" : 20002,             "advanced" : 4,             "needTime" : 19997,             "needFetch" : 0,             "saveState" : 156,             "restoreState" : 156,             "isEOF" : 1,             "invalidates" : 0,             "direction" : "forward",             "docsExamined" : 20000         }     },     "serverInfo" : {         "host" : "rMacBook.local",         "port" : 27017,         "version" : "3.0.6",  www.it-ebooks.info   Creating and querying with indexes  43          "gitVersion" : "nogitversion"     },     "ok" : 1 }  Upon examining the explain   output,3 you may be surprised to see that the query engine  has  to  scan  the  entire  collection,  all  20,000  documents   docsExamined ,  to return  only  four  results   nReturned .  The  value  of  the  totalKeysExamined  field shows the number of index entries scanned, which is zero. Such a large difference between the number of documents scanned and the number returned marks this as an inefficient query. In a real-world situation, where the collection and the documents themselves would likely be larger, the time needed to process the query would be sub- stantially greater than the eight milliseconds  millis  noted here  this may be differ- ent on your machine .   What this collection needs is an index. You can create an index for the  num key within the documents using the createIndex   method. Try entering the following index creation code:  > db.numbers.createIndex {num: 1}  {     "createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,     "numIndexesBefore" : 1,     "numIndexesAfter" : 2,     "ok" : 1 }  The  createIndex   method replaces the ensureIndex   method in MongoDB 3. If you’re  using  an  older  MongoDB  version,  you  should  use  ensureIndex    instead  of createIndex  . In MongoDB 3, ensureIndex   is still valid as it’s an alias for create- Index  , but you should stop using it.   As with other MongoDB operations, such as queries and updates, you pass a docu- ment to the createIndex   method to define the index’s keys. In this case, the {num: 1} document  indicates  that  an  ascending  index  should  be  built  on  the  num  key  for  all documents in the numbers collection.    You  can  verify  that  the  index  has  been  created  by  calling  the  getIndexes    method:  > db.numbers.getIndexes   [     {         "v" : 1,         "key" : {             "_id" : 1         },  3 In these examples we’re inserting “hostname” as the machine’s hostname. On your platform this may appear as localhost, your machine’s name, or its name plus .local. Don’t worry if your output looks a little dif- ferent than ours‘; it can vary based on your platform and your exact version of MongoDB.  www.it-ebooks.info   44  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell          "name" : "_id_",         "ns" : "tutorial.numbers"     },     {         "v" : 1,         "key" : {             "num" : 1         },         "name" : "num_1",         "ns" : "tutorial.numbers"     } ]                                        The collection now has two indexes. The first is the standard _id index that’s automat- ically  built  for  every  collection;  the  second  is  the  index  you  created  on  num.  The indexes for those fields are called _id_ and num_1, respectively. If you don’t provide a name, MongoDB sets hopefully meaningful names automatically.   If you run your query with the explain   method, you’ll now see the dramatic dif-  ference in query response time, as shown in the following listing.

This reduces the total time to serve the query from 8 ms to 0 ms!    Indexes  don’t  come  free;  they  take  up  some  space  and  can  make  your  inserts slightly more expensive, but they’re an essential tool for query optimization. If this example intrigues you, be sure to check out chapter 8, which is devoted to indexing and  query  optimization.  Next  you’ll  look  at  the  basic  administrative  commands required to get information about your MongoDB instance. You’ll also learn tech- niques for getting help from the shell, which will aid in mastering the various shell commands.  Basic administration This  chapter  promised  to  be  an  introduction  to  MongoDB  via  the  JavaScript  shell. You’ve  already  learned  the  basics  of  data  manipulation  and  indexing.  Here,  we’ll present techniques for getting information about your mongod process. For instance, you’ll probably want to know how much space your various collections are taking up, or how many indexes you’ve defined on a given collection. The commands detailed here can take you a long way in helping to diagnose performance issues and keep tabs on your data.   We’ll also look at MongoDB’s command interface. Most of the special, non-CRUD operations that can be performed on a MongoDB instance, from server status checks to data file integrity verification, are implemented using database commands. We’ll explain what commands are in the MongoDB context and show how easy they are to use. Finally, it’s always good to know where to look for help. To that end, we’ll point out  places  in  the  shell  where  you  can  turn  for  help  to  further  your  exploration  of MongoDB.  2.3.1 Getting database information  You’ll often want to know which collections and databases exist on a given installation. Fortunately, the MongoDB shell provides a number of commands, along with some syntactic sugar, for getting information about the system.  show dbs prints a list of all the databases on the system:  > show dbs admin      empty  local     0.078GB tutorial  0.078GB  www.it-ebooks.info   Basic administration  47  show  collections  displays  a  list  of  all  the  collections  defined  on  the  current  data- base.4 If the tutorial database is still selected, you’ll see a list of the collections you worked with in the preceding tutorial:  > show collections numbers system.indexes users  The one collection that you may not recognize is  system.indexes. This is a special collection  that  exists  for  every  database.  Each  entry  in  system.indexes  defines  an index for the database, which you can view using the getIndexes   method, as you saw  earlier.  But  MongoDB  3.0  deprecates  direct  access  to  the  system.indexes  collec- tions; you should use createIndexes and listIndexes instead. The getIndexes   Java- Script method can be replaced by the db.runCommand  {"listIndexes": "numbers"}   shell command.   For lower-level insight into databases and collections, the stats   method proves  useful. When you run it on a database object, you’ll get the following output:  > db.stats   {     "db" : "tutorial",     "collections" : 4,     "objects" : 20010,     "avgObjSize" : 48.0223888055972,     "dataSize" : 960928,     "storageSize" : 2818048,     "numExtents" : 8,     "indexes" : 3,     "indexSize" : 1177344,     "fileSize" : 67108864,     "nsSizeMB" : 16,     "extentFreeList" : {         "num" : 0,         "totalSize" : 0     },     "dataFileVersion" : {         "major" : 4,         "minor" : 5     },     "ok" : 1 }                                             You can also run the stats   command on an individual collection:  > db.numbers.stats   {     "ns" : "tutorial.numbers",     "count" : 20000,  4 You can also enter the more succinct show tables.  www.it-ebooks.info   48  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell      "size" : 960064,     "avgObjSize" : 48,     "storageSize" : 2793472,     "numExtents" : 5,     "nindexes" : 2,     "lastExtentSize" : 2097152,     "paddingFactor" : 1,     "paddingFactorNote" : "paddingFactor is unused and unmaintained in 3.0.   It remains hard coded to 1.0 for compatibility only.",      "systemFlags" : 1,     "userFlags" : 1,     "totalIndexSize" : 1169168,     "indexSizes" : {         "_id_" : 654080,         "num_1" : 515088     },     "ok" : 1 }                                      Some of the values provided in these result documents are useful only in complicated debugging or tuning situations. But at the very least, you’ll be able to find out how much space a given collection and its indexes are occupying.   2.3.2 How commands work  A certain set of MongoDB operations—distinct from the insert, update, remove, and query operations described so far in this chapter—are known as database commands. Database commands are generally administrative, as with the  stats   methods just presented, but they may also control core MongoDB features, such as updating data.   Regardless of the functionality they provide, what all database commands have in common is their implementation as queries on a special virtual collection called $cmd. To  show  what  this  means,  let’s  take  a  quick  example.  Recall  how  you  invoked  the stats   database command:  > db.stats    The stats   method is a helper that wraps the shell’s command invocation method. Try entering the following equivalent operation:  > db.runCommand  {dbstats: 1}    The  results  are  identical  to  what’s  provided  by  the  stats    method.  Note  that  the command  is  defined  by  the  document  {dbstats:  1}.  In  general,  you  can  run  any available command by passing its document definition to the runCommand   method. Here’s how you’d run the collection stats command:  > db.runCommand  {collstats: "numbers"}    The output should look familiar.  www.it-ebooks.info   Getting help  49    But  to  get  to  the  heart  of  database  commands,  you  need  to  see  how  the  run- Command   method works. That’s not hard to find out because the MongoDB shell will print the implementation of any method whose executing parentheses are omitted. Instead of running the command like this  > db.runCommand    you can execute the parentheses-less version and see the internals:  > db.runCommand   function   obj, extra  {     if   typeof  obj   == "string"  {         var n = {};         n[obj] = 1;         obj = n;         if   extra && typeof  extra   == "object"   {             for   var x in extra   {                 n[x] = extra[x];             }         }     }     return this.getCollection  "$cmd"  .findOne  obj  ;   }  The last line in the function is nothing more than a query on the $cmd collection. To define it properly, then, a database command is a query on a special collection, $cmd, where the query selector defines the command itself. That’s all there is to it. Can you think of a way to run the collection stats command manually? It’s this simple:  > db.$cmd.findOne  {collstats: "numbers"}  ;  Using the runCommand helper is easier but it’s always good to know what’s going on beneath the surface.   2.4  Getting help By now, the value of the MongoDB shell as a testing ground for experimenting with data  and  administering  the  database  should  be  evident.  But  because  you’ll  likely spend a lot of time in the shell, it’s worth knowing how to get help.   The built-in help commands are the first place to look. db.help   prints a list of commonly used methods for operating on databases. You’ll find a similar list of meth- ods for operating on collections by running db.numbers.help  .   There’s also built-in tab completion. Start typing the first characters of any method and then press the Tab key twice. You’ll see a list of all matching methods. Here’s the tab completion for collection methods beginning with get:  > db.numbers.get db.numbers.getCollection           db.numbers.getIndexes               db.numbers.getShardDistribution   www.it-ebooks.info   50  CHAPTER 2 MongoDB through the JavaScript shell  db.numbers.getDB                   db.numbers.getIndices               db.numbers.getShardVersion  db.numbers.getDiskStorageStats     db.numbers.getMongo                 db.numbers.getSlaveOk  db.numbers.getFullName             db.numbers.getName                  db.numbers.getSplitKeysForChunks  db.numbers.getIndexKeys            db.numbers.getPagesInRAM            db.numbers.getWriteConcern  db.numbers.getIndexSpecs           db.numbers.getPlanCache  db.numbers.getIndexStats           db.numbers.getQueryOptions    The official MongoDB manual is an invaluable resource and can be found at http:   docs.mongodb.org. It has both tutorials and reference material, and it’s kept up-to- date  with  new  releases  of  MongoDB.  The  manual  also  includes  documentation  for each  language-specific  MongoDB  driver  implementation,  such  as  the  Ruby  driver, which is necessary when accessing MongoDB from an application.   If you’re more ambitious, and are comfortable with JavaScript, the shell makes it easy  to  examine  the  implementation  of  any  given  method.  For  instance,  suppose you’d like to know exactly how the save   method works. Sure, you could go trolling through the MongoDB source code, but there’s an easier way: enter the method name without the executing parentheses. Here’s how you’d normally execute save  :  > db.numbers.save {num: 123123123} ;  And this is how you can check the implementation:  > db.numbers.save                                                function   obj , opts  {     if   obj == null           throw "can't save a null";      if   typeof  obj   == "number"  typeof  obj  == "string"           throw "can't save a number or string"      if   typeof  obj._id   == "undefined"  {         obj._id = new ObjectId  ;         return this.insert  obj , opts  ;     }     else {         return this.update  { _id : obj._id } , obj , Object.merge {   upsert:true }, opts  ;      } }                                                                 Read the function definition closely, and you’ll see that save   is merely a wrapper for insert   and update  . After checking the type of the  obj argument, if the object you’re trying to save doesn’t have an _id field, then the field is added, and insert   is invoked. Otherwise an update is performed.   This trick for examining the shell’s methods comes in handy. Keep this technique  in mind as you continue exploring the MongoDB shell.  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary  51  2.5  Summary You’ve now seen the document data model in practice, and we’ve demonstrated a vari- ety of common MongoDB operations on that data model. You’ve learned how to cre- ate  indexes  and  have  seen  an  example  of  index-based  performance  improvements through the use of explain  . In addition, you should be able to extract information about the collections and databases on your system, you now know all about the clever $cmd collection, and if you ever need help, you’ve picked up a few tricks for finding your way around.   You can learn a lot by working in the MongoDB shell, but there’s no substitute for the experience of building a real application. That’s why we’re going from a carefree data playground to a real-world data workshop in the next chapter. You’ll see how the drivers work, and then, using the Ruby driver, you’ll build a simple application, hitting MongoDB with some real, live data.  www.it-ebooks.info   Writing programs using MongoDB  This chapter covers   Introducing the MongoDB API through Ruby   Understanding how the drivers work   Using the BSON format and MongoDB network   protocol    Building a complete sample application  It’s time to get practical. Though there’s much to learn from experimenting with the MongoDB  shell,  you  can  see  the  real  value  of  this  database  only  after  you’ve built something with it. That means jumping into programming and taking a first look at the MongoDB drivers. As mentioned before, MongoDB, Inc. provides offi- cially supported, Apache-licensed MongoDB drivers for all of the most popular pro- gramming languages. The driver examples in the book use Ruby, but the principles we’ll  illustrate  are  universal  and  easily  transferable  to  other  drivers.  Throughout the book we’ll illustrate most commands with the JavaScript shell, but examples of using MongoDB from within an application will be in Ruby.   We’re going to explore programming in MongoDB in three stages. First, you’ll install the MongoDB Ruby driver and we’ll introduce the basic CRUD  create, read, update, delete  operations. This process should go quickly and feel familiar because  52  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB through the Ruby lens  53  the driver API is similar to that of the shell. Next, we’re going to delve deeper into the driver, explaining how it interfaces with MongoDB. Without getting too low-level, this section will show you what’s going on behind the scenes with the drivers in general. Finally, you’ll develop a simple Ruby application for monitoring Twitter. Working with a real-world data set, you’ll begin to see how MongoDB works in the wild. This final section will also lay the groundwork for the more in-depth examples presented in part 2 of the book.  New to Ruby? Ruby is a popular and readable scripting language. The code examples have been designed to be as explicit as possible so that even programmers unfamiliar with Ruby can benefit. Any Ruby idioms that may be hard to understand will be explained in the book. If you’d like to spend a few minutes getting up to speed with Ruby, start with the official 20-minute tutorial at http:  mng.bz THR3.  3.1 MongoDB through the Ruby lens  Normally when you think of drivers, what comes to mind are low-level bit manipula- tions and obtuse interfaces. Thankfully, the MongoDB language drivers are nothing like that; instead, they’ve been designed with intuitive, language-sensitive APIs so that many applications can sanely use a MongoDB driver as the sole interface to the data- base.  The  driver  APIs  are  also  fairly  consistent  across  languages,  which  means  that developers can easily move between languages as needed; anything you can do in the JavaScript API, you can do in the Ruby API. If you’re an application developer, you can expect to find yourself comfortable and productive with any of the MongoDB drivers without having to concern yourself with low-level implementation details.   In this first section, you’ll install the MongoDB Ruby driver, connect to the data- base, and learn how to perform basic CRUD operations. This will lay the groundwork for the application you’ll build at the end of the chapter.  Installing and connecting You can install the MongoDB Ruby driver using RubyGems, Ruby’s package manage- ment system.    Many newer operating systems come with Ruby already installed. You can check if you already have Ruby installed by running  ruby  -–version from your shell. If you don’t have Ruby installed on your system, you can find detailed installation instruc- tions at www.ruby-lang.org en downloads.    You’ll also need Ruby’s package manager, RubyGems. You may already have this as well; check by running gem -–version. Instructions for installing RubyGems can be  found  at  http:  docs.rubygems.org read chapter 3.  Once  you  have  RubyGems installed, run:  gem install mongo  3.1.1  www.it-ebooks.info   54  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  This should install both the mongo and bson1 gems. You should see output like the fol- lowing  the version numbers will likely be newer than what’s shown here :  Fetching: bson-3.2.1.gem  100%  Building native extensions.  This could take a while... Successfully installed bson-3.2.1 Fetching: mongo-2.0.6.gem  100%  Successfully installed mongo-2.0.6 2 gems installed  We also recommend you install the bson_ext gem, though this is optional. bson_ext is an official gem that contains a C implementation of BSON, enabling more efficient handling of BSON in the MongoDB driver. This gem isn’t installed by default because installation  requires  a  compiler.  Rest  assured,  if  you’re  unable  to  install  bson_ext, your programs will still work as intended.    You’ll start by connecting to MongoDB. First, make sure that mongod is running by running the mongo shell to ensure you can connect. Next, create a file called connect.rb and enter the following code:  require 'rubygems' require 'mongo'  $client = Mongo::Client.new [ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'tutorial'  Mongo::Logger.logger.level = ::Logger::ERROR $users = $client[:users] puts 'connected!'  The first two require statements ensure that you’ve loaded the driver. The next three lines instantiate the client to localhost and connect to the tutorial database, store a ref- erence to the users collection in the $users variable, and print the string connected!. We place a $ in front of each variable to make it global so that it’ll be accessible out- side of the connect.rb script. Save the file and run it:  $ ruby connect.rb D, [2015-06-05T12:32:38.843933 33946] DEBUG -- : MONGODB  Adding   127.0.0.1:27017 to the cluster.  runtime: 0.0031ms  D, [2015-06-05T12:32:38.847534 33946] DEBUG -- : MONGODB  COMMAND    namespace=admin.$cmd selector={:ismaster=>1} flags=[] limit=-1 skip=0  project=nil  runtime: 3.4170ms  connected!  If no exceptions are raised, you’ve successfully connected to MongoDB from Ruby and you should see connected! printed to your shell. That may not seem glamorous, but connecting is the first step in using MongoDB from any language. Next, you’ll use that connection to insert some documents.  1 BSON, explained in the next section, is the JSON-inspired binary format that MongoDB uses to represent doc-  uments. The bson Ruby gem serializes Ruby objects to and from BSON.  www.it-ebooks.info   3.1.2  MongoDB through the Ruby lens  55  Inserting documents in Ruby To run interesting MongoDB queries you first need some data, so let’s create some  this is the C in CRUD . All of the MongoDB drivers are designed to use the most natu- ral document representation for their language. In JavaScript,  JSON objects are the obvious choice, because  JSON is a document data structure; in Ruby, the hash data structure makes the most sense. The native Ruby hash differs from a JSON object in only a couple of small ways; most notably, where JSON separates keys and values with a colon, Ruby uses a hash rocket  => .2    If  you’re  following  along,  you  can  continue  adding  code  to  the  connect.rb  file. Alternatively,  a  nice  approach  is  to  use  Ruby’s  interactive  shell,  irb.  irb  is  a  REPL  Read,  Evaluate,  Print  Loop   console,  in  which  you  can  type  Ruby  code  to  have  it dynamically executed, making it ideal for experimentation. Anything you write in irb can be put in a script, so we recommend using it to learn new things, then copying your commands when you’d like them executed in a program. You can launch  irb and require connect.rb so that you’ll immediately have access to the connection, data- base,  and  collection  objects  initialized  therein.  You  can  then  run  Ruby  code  and receive immediate feedback. Here’s an example:  $ irb -r . connect.rb irb main :017:0> id = $users.insert_one {"last_name" => "mtsouk"}  =>  1, "n"=>1}]>  irb main :014:0> $users.find  .each do user irb main :015:1* puts user irb main :016:1> end  {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId '55e3ee1c5ae119511d000000' , "last_name"=>"knuth"} {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId '55e3f13d5ae119516a000000' , "last_name"=>"mtsouk"} => <Enumerator: <Mongo::Cursor:0x70275279317980  @view=<Mongo::Collection::View:0x70275279322740 namespace='tutorial.users  @selector={} @options={}>>:each>   irb gives you a command line shell with a prompt followed by >  this may look a little different on your machine . The prompt allows you to type in commands, and in the previous code we’ve highlighted the user input in bold. When you run a command in irb it will print out the value returned by the command, if there is one; that’s what is shown after => above.   Let’s build some documents for your users’ collection. You’ll create two documents representing two users, Smith and Jones. Each document, expressed as a Ruby hash, is assigned to a variable:  smith = {"last_name" => "smith", "age" => 30} jones = {"last_name" => "jones", "age" => 40}  2 In Ruby 1.9, you may optionally use a colon as the key-value separator, like hash = {foo: 'bar'}, but we’ll  stick with the hash rocket in the interest of backward compatibility.  www.it-ebooks.info   56  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  To save the documents, you’ll pass them to the collection’s insert method. Each call to insert returns a unique ID, which you’ll store in a variable to simplify later retrieval:  smith_id = $users.insert_one smith  jones_id = $users.insert_one jones   You can verify that the documents have been saved with some simple queries, so you can query with the user collection’s find   method like this:  irb main :013:0> $users.find "age" => {"$gt" => 20} .each.to_a do row irb main :014:1* puts row irb main :015:1> end => [{"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId '55e3f7dd5ae119516a000002' , "last_name"=>"smith",   "age"=>30}, {"_id"=>BSON::ObjectId '55e3f7e25ae119516a000003' ,  "last_name"=>"jones", "age"=>40}]   The return values for these queries will appear at the prompt if run in  irb. If the code is being run from a Ruby file, prepend Ruby’s p method to print the output to the screen:  p $users.find  :age => {"$gt" => 20} .to_a  You’ve successfully inserted two documents from Ruby. Let’s now take a closer look at queries.  Now that you’ve created documents, it’s on to the read operations  the R in CRUD  provided by MongoDB. The Ruby driver defines a rich interface for accessing data and handles most of the details for you. The queries we show in this section are fairly sim- ple selections, but keep in mind that MongoDB allows more complex queries, such as text searches and aggregations, which are described in later chapters.    You’ll see how this is so by looking at the standard find method. Here are two pos-  sible find operations on your data set:  $users.find {"last_name" => "smith"} .to_a $users.find {"age" => {"$gt" => 30}} .to_a  The first query searches for all user documents where the last_name is smith and that the second query matches all documents where age is greater than 30. Try entering the second query in irb:  2.1.4 :020 > $users.find {"age" => {"$gt" => 30}}   => <Mongo::Collection::View:0x70210212601420 namespace='tutorial.users  @selector={"age"=>{"$gt"=>30}} @options={}>  The  results  are  returned  in  a  Mongo::Collection::View  object,  which  extends Iterable and makes it easy to iterate through the results. We’ll discuss cursors in  3.1.3 Queries and cursors  www.it-ebooks.info   3.1.4 Updates and deletes  MongoDB through the Ruby lens  57  more  detail  in  Section  3.2.3.  In  the  meantime,  you  can  fetch  the  results  of  the $gt query:  cursor = $users.find {"age" => {"$gt" => 30}}  cursor.each do doc   puts doc["last_name"] end  Here  you  use  Ruby’s  each  iterator,  which  passes  each  result  to  a  code  block.  The last_name  attribute  is  then  printed  to  the  console.  The  $gt  used  in  the  query  is  a MongoDB operator; the $ character has no relation to the $ placed before global Ruby variables  like  $users.  Also,  if  there  are  any  documents  in  the  collection  without last_name, you might notice that nil  Ruby’s null value  is printed out; this indicates the lack of a value and it’s normal to see this.    The fact that you even have to think about cursors here may come as a surprise given  the  shell  examples  from  the  previous  chapter.  But  the  shell  uses  cursors  the same way every driver does; the difference is that the shell automatically iterates over the first 20 cursor results when you call find  . To get the remaining results, you can continue iterating manually by entering the it command.  Recall from chapter 2 that updates require at least two arguments: a query selector and an update document. Here’s a simple example using the Ruby driver:  $users.find {"last_name" => "smith"} .update_one {"$set" => {"city" =>  "Chicago"}}   This update finds the first user with a last_name of smith and, if found, sets the value of city to Chicago. This update uses the $set operator. You can run a query to show the change:  $users.find {"last_name" => "smith"} .to_a  The view allows you to decide whether you only want to update one document or all documents  matching  the  query.  In  the  preceding  example,  even  if  you  had  several users with the last name of smith, only one document would be updated. To apply the update to a particular smith, you’d need to add more conditions to your query selec- tor.  But  if  you  actually  want  to  apply  the  update  to  all  smith  documents,  you  must replace the update_one with the update_many method:  $users.find {"last_name" => "smith"} .update_many {"$set" => {"city" =>  "Chicago"}}   Deleting data is much simpler. We’ve discussed how it works in the MongoDB shell and the Ruby driver is no different. To review: you simply use the  remove method. This method  takes  an  optional  query  selector  that  will  remove  only  those  documents matching the selector. If no selector is provided, all documents in the collection will  www.it-ebooks.info   58  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  be  removed.  Here,  you’re  removing  all  user  documents  where  the  age  attribute  is greater than or equal to 40:  $users.find {"age" => {"$gte" => 40}} .delete_one  This will only delete the first one matching the matching criteria. If you want to delete all documents matching the criteria, you’d have to run this:  $users.find {"age" => {"$gte" => 40}} .delete_many  With no arguments, the drop method deletes all remaining documents:  $users.drop  3.1.5 Database commands  In  the  previous  chapter  you  saw  the  centrality  of  database  commands.  There,  we looked at the two stats commands. Here, we’ll look at how you can run commands from the driver using the listDatabases command as an example. This is one of a number of commands that must be run on the admin database, which is treated spe- cially  when  authentication  is  enabled.  For  details  on  the  authentication  and  the admin database, see chapter 10.    First, you instantiate a Ruby database object referencing the admin database. You  then pass the command’s query specification to the command method:  $admin_db = $client.use 'admin'  $admin_db.command {"listDatabases" => 1}   Note  that  this  code  still  depends  on  what  we  put  in  the  connect.rb  script  above because it expects the MongoDB connection to be in $client. The response is a Ruby hash listing all the existing databases and their sizes on disk:   [ {     "name"=>"local",      "sizeOnDisk"=>83886080.0,      "empty"=>false },  {     "name"=>"tutorial",  "sizeOnDisk"=>83886080.0,  "empty"=>false },  {     "name"=>"admin",      "sizeOnDisk"=>1.0, "empty"=>true }], "totalSize"=>167772160.0, "ok"=>1.0}]>  => nil  www.it-ebooks.info   3.2  How the drivers work  59  This may look a little different with your version of irb and the MongoDB driver, but it should still be easy to access. Once you get used to representing documents as Ruby hashes, the transition from the shell API is almost seamless.    Most drivers provide you convenient functionality that wraps database commands. You may recall from the previous chapter that remove doesn’t actually drop the collec- tion. To drop a collection and all its indexes, use the drop_collection method:  db = $client.use 'tutorial'  db['users'].drop  It’s okay if you’re still feeling shaky about using MongoDB with Ruby; you’ll get more practice in section 3.3. But for now, we’re going to take a brief intermission to see how the MongoDB drivers work. This will shed more light on some of MongoDB’s design and prepare you to use the drivers effectively.  How the drivers work At this point it’s natural to wonder what’s going on behind the scenes when you issue commands through a driver or via the MongoDB shell. In this section, you’ll see how the drivers serialize data and communicate it to the database.    All  MongoDB  drivers  perform  three  major  functions.  First,  they  generate  Mon- goDB object IDs. These are the default values stored in the _id field of all documents. Next, the drivers convert any language-specific representation of documents to and from BSON, the binary data format used by MongoDB. In the previous examples, the driver serializes all the Ruby hashes into BSON and then deserializes the BSON that’s returned from the database back to Ruby hashes.   The drivers’ final function is to communicate with the database over a TCP socket using the MongoDB wire protocol. The details of the protocol are beyond the scope of this discussion. But the style of socket communication, in particular whether writes on the socket wait for a response, is important, and we’ll explore the topic in this section.   Every MongoDB document requires a primary key. That key, which must be unique for all documents in each collection, is stored in the document’s _id field. Developers are free to use their own custom values as the _id, but when not provided, a MongoDB object  ID  will  be  used.  Before  sending  a  document  to  the  server,  the  driver  checks whether the _id field is present. If the field is missing, an object ID will be generated and stored as _id.   MongoDB object IDs are designed to be globally unique, meaning they’re guaran- teed to be unique within a certain context. How can this be guaranteed? Let’s exam- ine this in more detail.     You’ve  probably  seen  object  IDs  in  the  wild  if  you’ve  inserted  documents  into MongoDB, and at first glance they appear to be a string of mostly random text, like 4c291856238d3b19b2000001.  You  may  not  have  realized  that  this  text  is  the  hex  3.2.1 Object ID generation  www.it-ebooks.info   60  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  4-byte timestamp  Process ID  4c291856 238d3b 19b2 000001  Machine ID  Counter  Figure 3.1 MongoDB  object ID format  representation of 12 bytes, and actually stores some useful information. These bytes have a specific structure, as illustrated in figure 3.1.   The most significant four bytes carry a standard Unix  epoch  timestamp3. The next three bytes store the machine ID, which is followed by a two-byte process ID. The  final three bytes store a process-local counter that’s incremented each time an object ID is generated. The counter means that ids generated in the same process and second won’t be duplicated.   Why does the object ID have this format? It’s important to understand that these IDs are generated in the driver, not on the server. This is different than many RDBMSs, which increment a primary key on the server, thus creating a bottleneck for the server generating  the  key.  If  more  than  one  driver  is  generating  IDs  and  inserting  docu- ments, they need a way of creating unique identifiers without talking to each other. Thus, the timestamp, machine ID, and process ID are included in the identifier itself to make it extremely unlikely that IDs will overlap.   You may already be considering the odds of this happening. In practice, you would encounter other limits before inserting documents at the rate required to overflow the counter for a given second  224 million per second . It’s slightly more conceivable  though still unlikely  to imagine that ifyou had many drivers distributed across many machines,  two  machines  could  have  the  same  machine  ID.  For  example,  the  Ruby driver uses the following:  @@machine_id = Digest::MD5.digest Socket.gethostname [0, 3]  For this to be a problem, they would still have to have started the MongoDB driver’s process with the same process ID, and have the same counter value in a given second. In practice, don’t worry about duplication; it’s extremely unlikely.   One of the incidental benefits of using MongoDB object IDs is that they include a timestamp. Most of the drivers allow you to extract the timestamp, thus providing the document creation time, with resolution to the nearest second, for free. Using the Ruby  3 Many Unix machines  we’re including Linux when we say Unix machine  store time values in a format called Unix Time or POSIX time; they just count up the number of seconds since 00:00 on January 1st, 1970, called the epoch. This means that a timestamp can be stored as an integer. For example, 2010-06-28 21:47:02 is rep- resented as 1277761622  or 0x4c291856 in hexadecimal , the number of seconds since the epoch.  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a simple application  61  driver, you can call an object ID’s generation_time method to get that ID’s creation time as a Ruby Time object:  irb> require 'mongo' irb> id = BSON::ObjectId.from_string '4c291856238d3b19b2000001'  => BSON::ObjectId '4c291856238d3b19b2000001'  irb> id.generation_time => 2010-06-28 21:47:02 UTC  Naturally, you can also use object IDs to issue range queries on object creation time. For instance, if you wanted to query for all documents created during June 2013, you could  create  two  object  IDs  whose  timestamps  encode  those  dates  and  then  issue  a range query on _id. Because Ruby provides methods for generating object IDs from any Time object, the code for doing this is trivial:4  jun_id = BSON::ObjectId.from_time Time.utc 2013, 6, 1   jul_id = BSON::ObjectId.from_time Time.utc 2013, 7, 1   @users.find {'_id' => {'$gte' => jun_id, '$lt' => jul_id}}   As mentioned before, you can also set your own value for _id. This might make sense in  cases  where  one  of  the  document’s  fields  is  important  and  always  unique.  For instance, in a collection of users you could store the username in _id rather than on object ID. There are advantages to both ways, and it comes down to your preference as a developer.  Building a simple application Next you’ll build a simple application for archiving and displaying Tweets. You can imagine this being a component in a larger application that allows users to keep tabs on search terms relevant to their businesses. This example will demonstrate how easy it is to consume JSON from an API like Twitter’s and convert that to MongoDB docu- ments. If you were doing this with a relational database, you’d have to devise a schema in advance, probably consisting of multiple tables, and then declare those tables. Here, none of that’s required, yet you’ll still preserve the rich structure of the Tweet docu- ments, and you’ll be able to query them effectively.    Let’s  call  the  app  TweetArchiver.  TweetArchiver  will  consist  of  two  components: the archiver and the viewer. The archiver will call the Twitter search API and store the relevant Tweets, and the viewer will display the results in a web browser.  3.3  3.3.1  Setting up This application requires four Ruby libraries. The source code repository for this chap- ter includes a file called Gemfile, which lists these gems. Change your working directory  4 This example will actually not work; it’s meant as a thoughtful exercise. By now you should have enough knowledge to create meaningful data for the query to return something. Why not take the time and try it out?  www.it-ebooks.info   62  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  to chapter3 and make sure an ls command shows the Gemfile. You can then install them from your system command line like this:  gem install bundler bundle install  This  will  ensure  the  bundler  gem  is  installed.  Next,  install  the  other  gems  using Bundler’s package management tools. This is a widely used Ruby tool for ensuring that the gems you use match some predetermined versions: the versions that match our code examples.     Our  Gemfile  lists  the  mongo,  twitter,  bson  and  sinatra  gems,  so  these  will  be installed. The mongo gem we’ve used already, but we include it to be sure we have the right version. The twitter gem is useful for communicating with the Twitter API. The sinatra gem is a framework for running a simple web server in Ruby, and we discuss it in more detail in section 3.3.3.    We provide the source code for this example separately, but introduce it gradually to help you understand it. We recommend you experiment and try new things to get the most out of the example.   It’ll be useful to have a configuration file that you can share between the archiver and viewer scripts. Create a file called config.rb  or copy it from the source code  that looks like this:  DATABASE_HOST   = 'localhost'         DATABASE_PORT   = 27017               DATABASE_NAME   = "twitter-archive"   COLLECTION_NAME = "tweets"            TAGS = ["MongoDB", "Mongo"]          CONSUMER_KEY    = "replace me" CONSUMER_SECRET = "replace me" TOKEN           = "replace me"  TOKEN_SECRET    = "replace me"   First you specify the names of the database and collection you’ll use for your applica- tion. Then you define an array of search terms, which you’ll send to the Twitter API.   Twitter requires that you register a free account and an application for accessing the  API,  which  can  be  accomplished  at  http:  apps.twitter.com.  Once  you’ve  regis- tered an application, you should see a page with its authentication information, per- haps on the API keys tab. You will also have to click the button that creates your access token. Use the values shown to fill in the consumer and API keys and secrets.  3.3.2 Gathering data  The  next  step  is  to  write  the  archiver  script.  You  start  with  a  TweetArchiver  class. You’ll instantiate the class with a search term. Then you’ll call the update method on the TweetArchiver instance, which issues a Twitter API call, and save the results to a MongoDB collection.  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a simple application  63   Let’s start with the class’s constructor:  def initialize tag                                                       connection = Mongo::Connection.new DATABASE_HOST, DATABASE_PORT        db         = connection[DATABASE_NAME]                                 @tweets    = db[COLLECTION_NAME]                                       @tweets.ensure_index [['tags', 1], ['id', -1]]                         @tag = tag                                                             @tweets_found = 0                                                       @client = Twitter::REST::Client.new do config                          config.consumer_key        = API_KEY                                   config.consumer_secret     = API_SECRET                                config.access_token        = ACCESS_TOKEN                              config.access_token_secret = ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET                     end                                                                  end                                                                     The initialize method instantiates a connection, a database object, and the collec- tion object you’ll use to store the Tweets.    You’re creating a compound index on tags ascending and id descending. Because you’re going to want to query for a particular tag and show the results from newest to oldest, an index with tags ascending and id descending will make that query use the index both for filtering results and for sorting them. As you can see here, you indicate index direction with 1 for ascending and -1 for descending. Don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense now—we discuss indexes with much greater depth in chapter 8.   You’re also configuring the Twitter client with the authentication information from config.rb. This step hands these values to the Twitter gem, which will use them when calling the Twitter API. Ruby has somewhat unique syntax often used for this sort of con- figuration; the config variable is passed to a Ruby block, in which you set its values.    MongoDB  allows  you  to  insert  data  regardless  of  its  structure.  With  a  relational database, each table needs a well-defined schema, which requires planning out which values you would like to store. In the future, Twitter may change its API so that different values are returned, which will likely require a schema change if you want to store these additional values. Not so with MongoDB. Its schema-less design allows you to save the document you get from the Twitter API without worrying about the exact format.     The  Ruby  Twitter  library  returns  Ruby  hashes,  so  you  can  pass  these  directly  to your MongoDB collection object. Within your TweetArchiver, you add the following instance method:  def save_tweets_for term                 @client.search term .each do tweet     @tweets_found += 1                     tweet_doc = tweet.to_h                 tweet_doc[:tags] = term                tweet_doc[:_id] = tweet_doc[:id]       @tweets.insert_one tweet_doc               end                                  end                                     www.it-ebooks.info   64  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  Before saving each Tweet document, make two small modifications. To simplify later queries, add the search term to a tags attribute. You also set the _id field to the ID of the Tweet, replacing the primary key of your collection and ensuring that each Tweet is added only once. Then you pass the modified document to the save method.    To use this code in a class, you need some additional code. First, you must config- ure the MongoDB driver so that it connects to the correct mongod and uses the desired database  and  collection.  This  is  simple  code  that  you’ll  replicate  often  as  you  use MongoDB. Next, you must configure the Twitter gem with your developer credentials. This  step  is  necessary  because  Twitter  restricts  its  API  to  registered  developers.  The next listing also provides an update method, which gives the user feedback and calls save_tweets_for.   Listing 3.1 archiver.rb—A class for fetching Tweets and archiving them in MongoDB  $LOAD_PATH << File.dirname __FILE__  require 'rubygems'  require 'mongo' require 'twitter' require 'config'  class TweetArchiver  Create a new instance of Tweet- Archive.  def initialize tag                                                              client =   Mongo::Client.new ["{DATABASE_HOST}:{DATABASE_PORT}"],:database =>  "{DATABASE_NAME}"                                                         @tweets    = client["{COLLECTION_NAME}"]                                   @tweets.indexes.drop_all                                                    @tweets.indexes.create_many [                                                 { :key => { tags: 1 }},                                                     { :key => { id: -1 }}                                                       ]                                                                         @tag = tag                                                                  @tweets_found = 0                                                            @client = Twitter::REST::Client.new do config                 config.consumer_key        = "{API_KEY}"                     config.consumer_secret     = "{API_SECRET}"                  config.access_token        = "{ACCESS_TOKEN}"                config.access_token_secret = "{ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET}"       end                                                         end                                                          Configure the  Twitter client  using the values  found in config.rb.    def update                                               puts "Starting Twitter search for '{@tag}'..."        save_tweets_for @tag                                   print "{@tweets_found} Tweets saved.\n\n"           end                                                   A user facing  method to wrap  save_tweets_for    private  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a simple application  65    def save_tweets_for term                       @client.search term .each do tweet           @tweets_found += 1                           tweet_doc = tweet.to_h                       tweet_doc[:tags] = term                      tweet_doc[:_id] = tweet_doc[:id]             @tweets.insert_one tweet_doc               end   end end  Search with the  Twitter client and  save the results  to Mongo.  All that remains is to write a script to run the TweetArchiver code against each of the search terms. Create a file called update.rb  or copy it from the provided code  con- taining the following:  $LOAD_PATH << File.dirname __FILE__  require 'config' require 'archiver'  TAGS.each do tag   archive = TweetArchiver.new tag    archive.update end  Next, run the update script:  ruby update.rb  > use twitter-archive switched to db twitter-archive > db.tweets.count   30  You’ll see some status messages indicating that Tweets have been found and saved. You can verify that the script works by opening the MongoDB shell and querying the col- lection directly:  What’s important here is that you’ve managed to store Tweets from Twitter searches in only a few lines of code.5 Next comes the task of displaying the results.  3.3.3  Viewing the archive You’ll use Ruby’s Sinatra web framework to build a simple app to display the results. Sinatra allows you to define the endpoints for a web application and directly specify the  response.  Its  power  lies  in  its  simplicity.  For  example,  the  content  of  the  index page for your application can be specified with the following:   get ' ' do    "response" end  5 It’s possible to accomplish this in far fewer lines of code. Doing so is left as an exercise to the reader.  www.it-ebooks.info   66  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  This code specifies that GET requests to the   endpoint of your application return the value of response to the client. Using this format, you can write full web applications with many endpoints, each of which can execute arbitrary Ruby code before returning a response. You can find more information, including Sinatra’s full documentation, at http:  sinatrarb.com.   We’ll now introduce a file called viewer.rb and place it in the same directory as the other scripts. Next, make a subdirectory called views, and place a file there called tweets.erb. After these steps, the project’s file structure should look like this:  - config.rb - archiver.rb - update.rb - viewer.rb -  views   - tweets.erb  Again, feel free to create these files yourself or copy them from the code examples. Now edit viewer.rb with the code in the following listing.  Listing 3.2 viewer.rb—Sinatra application for displaying the Tweet archive  $LOAD_PATH << File.dirname __FILE__  require 'rubygems' require 'mongo' require 'sinatra'                  require 'config' require 'open-uri'  b  Required  libraries  configure do   client = Mongo::Client.new ["{DATABASE_HOST}:{DATABASE_PORT}"], :database   => "{DATABASE_NAME}"     TWEETS = client["{COLLECTION_NAME}"]      end  Instantiate collection  for tweets  c  get ' ' do   if params['tag']     selector = {:tags => params['tag']}         else     selector = {}                                   end  d  Dynamically build  query selector…   …or use  blank selector  e    @tweets = TWEETS.find selector .sort ["id", -1]         erb :tweets                               end  Render   f  viewg  Issue  query  The  first  lines  require  the  necessary  libraries  along  with  your  config  file  B.  Next there’s a configuration block that creates a connection to MongoDB and stores a refer- ence to your tweets collection in the constant TWEETS c.   The real meat of the application is in the lines beginning with  get  ' '  do. The code in this block handles requests to the application’s root URL. First, you build your  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a simple application  67  query selector. If a tags URL parameter has been provided, you create a query selector that restricts the result set to the given tags d. Otherwise, you create a blank selector, which returns all documents in the collection e. You then issue the query f. By now, you should know that what gets assigned to the @tweets variable isn’t a result set but a cursor. You’ll iterate over that cursor in your view.   The last line g renders the view file tweets.erb  see the next listing .  Listing 3.3 tweets.erb—HTML with embedded Ruby for rendering the Tweets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             body {                                                                    width: 1000px;                                                          margin: 50px auto;                                                      font-family: Palatino, serif;                                           background-color: dbd4c2;                                              color: 555050;                                                       }                                                                       h2 {                                                                      margin-top: 2em;                                                        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;                                         font-weight: 100;                                                     }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Tweet Archive                                                                                                       ">                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ">                                                                                                                  on                                                                                                                 " width="48"  >                                                                                                                                         Most of the code is just HTML with some ERB  embedded Ruby  mixed in. The Sinatra app runs the tweets.erb file through an ERB processor and evaluates any Ruby code between   in the context of the application.    The important parts come near the end, with the two iterators. The first of these cycles through the list of tags to display links for restricting the result set to a given tag.  www.it-ebooks.info   68  CHAPTER 3 Writing programs using MongoDB  The  second  iterator,  beginning  with  the  @tweets.each  code,  cycles  through  each Tweet to display the Tweet’s text, creation date, and user profile image. You can see results by running the application:  $ ruby viewer.rb  If the application starts without error, you’ll see the standard Sinatra startup message that looks something like this:  $ ruby viewer.rb [2013-07-05 18:30:19] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1   [2013-07-05 18:30:19] INFO  ruby 1.9.3  2012-04-20  [x86_64-darwin10.8.0]  == Sinatra 1.4.3 has taken the stage on 4567 for development with backup from   WEBrick  [2013-07-05 18:30:19] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServerstart: pid=18465 port=4567   You can then point your web browser to http:  localhost:4567. The page should look something like the screenshot in figure 3.2. Try clicking on the links at the top of the screen to narrow the results to a particular tag.  Figure 3.2 Tweet Archiver output rendered in a web browser  www.it-ebooks.info   3.4  Summary  69  That’s the extent of the application. It’s admittedly simple, but it demonstrates some of the ease of using MongoDB. You didn’t have to define your schema in advance, you took advantage of secondary indexes to make your queries fast and prevent duplicate inserts, and you had a relatively simple integration with your programming language.   Summary You’ve just learned the basics of talking to MongoDB through the Ruby programming language. You saw how easy it is to represent documents in Ruby, and how similar Ruby’s CRUD API is to that of the MongoDB shell. We dove into some internals, exploring how the drivers in general are built and looking in detail at object IDs, BSON, and the Mon- goDB network protocol. Finally, you built a simple application to show the use of Mon- goDB  with  real  data.  Though  using  MongoDB  in  the  real  world  often  requires  more complexity, the prospect of writing applications with the database should be in reach.   Beginning with chapter 4, we’re going to take everything you’ve learned so far and drill down. Specifically, you’ll investigate how you might build an e-commerce applica- tion in MongoDB. That would be an enormous project, so we’ll focus solely on a few sections on the back end. We’ll present some data models for that domain, and you’ll see how to insert and query that kind of data.  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Part 2  Application development in MongoDB  Part 2 of this book is a deep exploration of MongoDB’s document data model,  query language, and CRUD  create, read, update, and delete  operations.    We’ll make these topics concrete by progressively designing an e-commerce data model and the CRUD operations necessary for managing such data. Each chapter will present its subject matter in a top-down fashion, first by present- ing examples within the sample e-commerce application’s domain, and then by systematically filling in the details. On your first reading, you may want to read the e-commerce examples only and save the detailed material for later, or vice versa.    In chapter 4, you’ll learn some schema design principles and then construct a basic e-commerce data model for products, categories, users, orders, and prod- uct  reviews.  Then  you’ll  learn  how  MongoDB  organizes  data  on  the  database, collection,  and  document  levels.  This  chapter  includes  a  summary  of  BSON’s core data types.    Chapter 5 covers MongoDB’s query language. You’ll learn how to issue com- mon queries against the data model developed in the previous chapter. Then, in the nuts and bolts sections, you’ll see the semantics of query operators presented in detail.   Chapter 6 is all about aggregations. We’ll show you how to do some simple  groupings, and also go in depth into MongoDB’s aggregation framework.  www.it-ebooks.info   72  PART 2 Application development in MongoDB   In presenting MongoDB’s update and delete operations, chapter 7 brings us full circle by showing the rationale for the e-commerce data model. You’ll learn how to maintain  the  category  hierarchy  and  how  to  manage  inventory  transactionally.  In addition, the update operators will be covered in detail along with the powerful find- AndModify command.   www.it-ebooks.info   Document-oriented data  This chapter covers   Schema design   Data models for e-commerce   Nuts and bolts of databases, collections, and   documents  This chapter takes a close look at document-oriented data modeling and how data is organized at the database, collection, and document levels in MongoDB. We’ll start with  a  brief,  general  discussion  of  how  to  design  schemas  to  use  with  MongoDB. Remember, MongoDB itself doesn’t enforce a schema, but every application needs some basic internal standards about how its data is stored. This exploration of princi- ples sets the stage for the second part of the chapter, where we examine the design of an e-commerce schema in MongoDB. Along the way, you’ll see how this schema dif- fers from an equivalent RDBMS schema, and you’ll learn how the typical relation- ships  between  entities,  such  as  one-to-many  and  many-to-many,  are  represented  in MongoDB. The e-commerce schema presented here will also serve as a basis for our discussions of queries, aggregation, and updates in subsequent chapters.    Because documents are the raw materials of MongoDB, we’ll devote the final portion of this chapter to some of the many details you might encounter when  73  www.it-ebooks.info   74  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  4.1  thinking through your own schemas. This involves a more detailed discussion of data- bases, collections, and documents than you’ve seen up to this point. But if you read to the end, you’ll be familiar with most of the obscure features and limitations of docu- ment data in MongoDB. You may also find yourself returning to this final section of the chapter later on, as it contains many of the “gotchas” you’ll encounter when using MongoDB in the wild.  Principles of schema design Database schema design is the process of choosing the best representation for a data set, given the features of the database system, the nature of the data, and the applica- tion  requirements.  The  principles  of  schema  design  for  relational  database  systems are well established. With RDBMSs, you’re encouraged to shoot for a normalized data model,1 which helps to ensure generic query ability and avoid updates to data that might result in inconsistencies. Moreover, the established patterns prevent developers from wondering how to model, say, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. But schema design is never an exact science, even with relational databases. Application functionality  and  performance  is  the  ultimate  master  in  schema  design,  so  every “rule” has exceptions.   If you’re coming from the RDBMS world, you may be troubled by MongoDB’s lack of hard schema design rules. Good practices have emerged, but there’s still usually more than one good way to model a given data set. The premise of this section is that principles can drive schema design, but the reality is that those principles are pliable. To get you thinking, here are a few questions you can bring to the table when model- ing data with any database system:    What are your application access patterns? You need to pin down the needs of your application, and this should inform not only your schema design but also which database  you  choose.  Remember,  MongoDB  isn’t  right  for  every  application. Understanding  your  application  access  patterns  is  by  far  the  most  important aspect of schema design.  The idiosyncrasies of an application can easily demand a schema that goes against firmly held data modeling principles. The upshot is that you must ask numerous questions about the application before you can determine the ideal data model. What’s the read write ratio? Will queries be simple, such as looking up a key, or more complex? Will aggregations be necessary? How much data will be stored?    What’s the basic unit of data? In an RDBMS, you have tables with columns and rows. In a key-value store, you have keys pointing to amorphous values. In MongoDB, the basic unit of data is the BSON document.  1 A simple way to think about a “normalized data model” is that information is never stored more than once.  Thus, a one-to-many relationship between entities will always be split into at least two tables.  www.it-ebooks.info   Designing an e-commerce data model  75    What are the capabilities of your database? Once you understand the basic data type, you need to know how to manipulate it. RDBMSs feature ad hoc queries and joins, usually written in SQL while simple key-value stores permit fetching val- ues only by a single key. MongoDB also allows ad hoc queries, but joins aren’t supported.  Databases also diverge in the kinds of updates they permit. With an RDBMS, you  can  update  records  in  sophisticated  ways  using  SQL  and  wrap  multiple updates in a transaction to get atomicity and rollback. MongoDB doesn’t sup- port transactions in the traditional sense, but it does support a variety of atomic update operations that can work on the internal structures of a complex docu- ment. With simple key-value stores, you might be able to update a value, but every update will usually mean replacing the value completely.    What makes a good unique id or primary key for a record? There are exceptions, but many  schemas,  regardless  of  the  database  system,  have  some  unique  key  for each record. Choosing this key carefully can make a big difference in how you access your data and how it’s stored. If you’re designing a user’s collection, for example,  should  you  use  an  arbitrary  value,  a  legal  name,  a  username,  or  a social security number as the primary key? It turns out that neither legal names nor social security numbers are unique or even applicable to all users within a given dataset.  In MongoDB choosing a primary key means picking what should go in the _id  field.  The  automatic  object  ids  are  good  defaults,  but  not  ideal  in  every case.  This  is  particularly  important  if  you  shard  your  data  across  multiple machines  because  it  determines  where  a  certain  record  will  go.  We’ll  discuss this in much greater detail in chapter 12.  The best schema designs are always the product of deep knowledge of the database you’re using, good judgment about the requirements of the application at hand, and plain old experience. A good schema often requires experimentation and iteration, such as when an application scales and performance considerations change. Don’t be afraid to alter your schema when you learn new things; only rarely is it possible to fully plan  an  application  before  its  implementation.  The  examples  in  this  chapter  have been designed to help you develop a good sense of schema design in MongoDB. Hav- ing  studied  these  examples,  you’ll  be  well-prepared  to  design  the  best  schemas  for your own applications.  4.2  Designing an e-commerce data model The  Twitter  example  application  provided  in  chapter  3  demonstrated  the  basic MongoDB features, but didn’t require much thought about its schema design. That’s why, in this and in subsequent chapters, we’ll look at the much richer domain of e-commerce.  E-commerce  has  the  advantage  of  including  a  large  number  of  famil- iar data modeling patterns. Plus, it’s not hard to imagine how products, categories, product  reviews,  and  orders  are  typically  modeled  in  an  RDBMS.  This  should  make  www.it-ebooks.info   76  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  the upcoming examples more instructive because you’ll be able to compare them to your preconceived notions of schema design.   E-commerce has typically been done with RDBMSs for a couple of reasons. The first is that e-commerce sites generally require transactions, and transactions are an RDBMS staple. The second is that, until recently, domains that require rich data models and sophisticated queries have been assumed to fit best within the realm of the RDBMS. The following examples call into question this second assumption.    Building  an  entire  e-commerce  back  end  isn’t  practical  within  the  space  of  this book. Instead, we’ll pick out a handful of common and useful e-commerce entities, such  as  products  and  customer  reviews,  and  show  how  they  might  be  modeled  in MongoDB. In particular, we’ll look at products and categories, users and orders, and product reviews. For each entity, we’ll show an example document. Then, we’ll show some of the database features that complement the document’s structure.   For many developers, data model goes hand in hand with object mapping, and for that purpose you may have used an object-relational mapping library, such as Java’s Hiber- nate  framework  or  Ruby’s  ActiveRecord.  Such  libraries  can  be  useful  for  efficiently building applications with a RDBMS, but they’re less necessary with MongoDB. This is due in part to the fact that a document is already an object-like representation. It’s also partly due to the MongoDB drivers, which already provide a fairly high-level inter- face to MongoDB. Without question, you can build applications on MongoDB using the driver interface alone.   Object mappers can provide value by helping with validations, type checking, and associations between models, and come standard in frameworks like Ruby on Rails. Object mappers also introduce an additional layer of complexity between the program- mer and the database that can obscure important query characteristics. You should evaluate this tradeoff when deciding if your application should use an object mapper; there are plenty of excellent applications written both with and without one.2 We don’t use an object mapper in any this book’s examples, and we recommend you first learn about MongoDB without one.   Schema basics Products and categories are the mainstays of any e-commerce site. Products, in a nor- malized RDBMS model, tend to require a large number of tables. There’s a table for basic product information, such as the name and SKU, but there will be other tables to relate shipping information and pricing histories. This multitable schema will be facil- itated by the RDBMS’s ability to join tables.    Modeling  a  product  in  MongoDB  should  be  less  complicated.  Because  collec- tions don’t enforce a schema, any product document will have room for whichever dynamic attributes the product needs. By using arrays in your document, you can typically condense a multitable RDBMS representation into a single MongoDB collection.  4.2.1  2 To find out which object mappers are most current for your language of choice, consult the recommenda-  tions at mongodb.org.  www.it-ebooks.info   Designing an e-commerce data model  77  More concretely, listing 4.1 shows a sample product from a gardening store. It’s advis- able to assign this document to a variable before inserting it to the database using db.products.insert yourVariable  to be able to run the queries discussed over the next several pages.   Unique object ID  Listing 4.1 A sample product document  Unique slug  b  c  d  Nested  document  {    _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,        slug: "wheelbarrow-9092",                       sku: "9092",   name: "Extra Large Wheelbarrow",   description: "Heavy duty wheelbarrow...",   details: {                                      weight: 47,     weight_units: "lbs",     model_num: 4039283402,     manufacturer: "Acme",     color: "Green"   },   total_reviews: 4,   average_review: 4.5,   pricing: {     retail: 589700,     sale: 489700,   },   price_history: [                                {                        retail: 529700,       sale: 429700,       start: new Date 2010, 4, 1 ,       end: new Date 2010, 4, 8      },     {       retail: 529700,       sale: 529700,       start: new Date 2010, 4, 9 ,       end: new Date 2010, 4, 16      },   ],   primary_category: ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,      category_ids: [                                               ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,     ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000049"    ],   main_cat_id: ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,   tags: ["tools", "gardening", "soil"], }  f  e  One-to-many  relationship  Many-to-many  relationship  The document contains the basic name, sku, and description fields. There’s also the standard MongoDB object ID B stored in the _id field. We discuss other aspects of this document in the next section.  www.it-ebooks.info   78  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  UNIQUE SLUG In  addition,  you’ve  defined  a  slug  c,  wheelbarrow-9092,  to  provide  a  meaningful URL. MongoDB users sometimes complain about the ugliness of object IDs in URLs. Naturally, you don’t want URLs that look like this:  http:  mygardensite.org products 4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981  Meaningful IDs are so much better:  http:  mygardensite.org products wheelbarrow-9092  These user-friendly permalinks are often called slugs. We generally recommend build- ing a slug field if a URL will be generated for the document. Such a field should have a unique index on it so that the value has fast query access and is guaranteed to be unique. You could also store the slug in _id and use it as a primary key. We’ve chosen not to in this case to demonstrate unique indexes; either way is acceptable. Assuming you’re storing this document in the products collection, you can create the unique index like this:  db.products.createIndex {slug: 1}, {unique: true}   If you have a unique index on slug, an exception will be thrown if you try to insert a duplicate value. That way, you can retry with a different slug if necessary. Imagine your gardening  store  has  multiple  wheelbarrows  for  sale.  When  you  start  selling  a  new wheelbarrow,  your  code  will  need  to  generate  a  unique  slug  for  the  new  product. Here’s how you’d perform the insert from Ruby:  @products.insert_one {   :name => "Extra Large Wheelbarrow",   :sku  => "9092",   :slug => "wheelbarrow-9092"}   Unless  you  specify  otherwise,  the  driver  automatically  ensures  that  no  errors  were raised. If the insert succeeds without raising an exception, you know you’ve chosen a unique slug. But if an exception is raised, your code will need to retry with a new value for the slug. You can see an example of catching and gracefully handling an exception in section 7.3.2. NESTED DOCUMENTS Say you have a key, details d, that points to a subdocument containing various prod- uct details. This key is totally different from the _id field because it allows you to find things inside an existing document. You’ve specified the weight, weight units, and the manufacturer’s model number. You might store other ad hoc attributes here as well. For instance, if you were selling seeds, you might include attributes for the expected yield  and  time  to  harvest,  and  if  you  were  selling  lawnmowers,  you  could  include horsepower, fuel type, and mulching options. The details attribute provides a nice container for these kinds of dynamic attributes.  www.it-ebooks.info   Designing an e-commerce data model  79   You can also store the product’s current and past prices in the same document. The pricing key points to an object containing retail and sale prices. price_history, by contrast, references a whole array of pricing options. Storing copies of documents like this is a common versioning technique.   Next, there’s an array of tag names for the product. You saw a similar tagging exam- ple in chapter 1. Because you can index array keys, this is the simplest and best way of storing relevant tags on an item while at the same time assuring efficient queryability.  ONE-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIPS What about relationships? You often need to relate to documents in other collections. To start, you’ll relate products to a category structure e. You probably want to define a taxonomy of categories distinct from your products themselves. Assuming a separate categories collection, you then need a relationship between a product and its primary category f. This is a one-to-many relationship, since a product only has one primary category, but a category can be the primary for many products.  MANY-TO-MANY RELATIONSHIPS You also want to associate each product with a list of relevant categories other than the primary category. This relationship is many-to-many, since each product can belong to more than one category and each category can contain multiple products. In an RDMBS, you’d use a join table to represent a many-to-many relationship like this one. Join tables store all the relationship references between two tables in a single table. Using a SQL join, it’s then possible to issue a single query to retrieve a product with all its categories, and vice versa.    MongoDB  doesn’t  support  joins,  so  you  need  a  different  many-to-many  strategy. We’ve defined a field called category_ids f containing an array of object IDs. Each object ID acts as a pointer to the _id field of some category document.  A RELATIONSHIP STRUCTURE  The next listing shows a sample category document. You can assign it to a new variable and insert it into the categories collection using db.categories.insert newCategory . This will help you using it in forthcoming queries without having to type it again.  Listing 4.2 A category document  {     _id: ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,     slug: "gardening-tools",     name: "Gardening Tools",     description: "Gardening gadgets galore!",     parent_id: ObjectId "55804822812cb336b78728f9" ,       ancestors: [             {                  name: "Home",                 _id: ObjectId "558048f0812cb336b78728fa" ,                 slug: "home"             },      www.it-ebooks.info   80  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data          {                  name: "Outdoors",                 _id: ObjectId "55804822812cb336b78728f9" ,                 slug: "outdoors"             }       ] }  If  you  go  back  to  the  product  document  and  look  carefully  at  the  object  IDs  in  its category_ids field, you’ll see that the product is related to the Gardening Tools cate- gory just shown. Having the category_ids array key in the product document enables all the kinds of queries you might issue on a many-to-many relationship. For instance, to query for all products in the Gardening Tools category, the code is simple:  db.products.find {category_ids: ObjectId '6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048' }   To query for all categories from a given product, you use the $in operator:  db.categories.find {_id: {$in: product['category_ids']}}   The previous command assumes the product variable is already defined with a com- mand similar to the following:  product = db.products.findOne {"slug": "wheelbarrow-9092"}   You’ll  notice  the  standard  _id,  slug,  name,  and  description  fields  in  the  category document. These are straightforward, but the array of parent documents may not be. Why are you redundantly storing such a large percentage of each of the document’s ancestor categories?    Categories are almost always conceived of as a hierarchy, and there are many ways of representing this in a database. For this example, assume that “Home” is the category of products, “Outdoors” a subcategory of that, and “Gardening Tools” a subcategory of that. MongoDB doesn’t support joins, so we’ve elected to denormalize the parent cate- gory names in each child document, which means they’re duplicated. This way, when querying for the Gardening Products category, there’s no need to perform additional queries to get the names and URLs of the parent categories, Outdoors and Home.   Some developers would consider this level of denormalization unacceptable. But for the moment, try to be open to the possibility that the schema is best determined by the demands of the application, and not necessarily the dictates of theory. When you see more examples of querying and updating this structure in the next two chapters, the rationale will become clearer.  4.2.2 Users and orders  If you look at how you model users and orders, you’ll see another common relation- ship: one-to-many. That is, every user has many orders. In an RDBMS, you’d use a for- eign key in your orders table; here, the convention is similar. See the following listing.  www.it-ebooks.info   Designing an e-commerce data model  81  Listing 4.3 An e-commerce order, with line items, pricing, and a shipping address  Denormalized  product  information  {   _id: ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,   user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,   state: "CART",   line_items: [                                       {        _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,       sku: "9092",       name: "Extra Large Wheelbarrow",       quantity: 1,       pricing: {         retail: 5897,         sale: 4897,       }     },     {        _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003982" ,       sku: "10027",       name: "Rubberized Work Glove, Black",       quantity: 2,       pricing: {         retail: 1499,         sale: 1299       }     }   ],   shipping_address: {     street: "588 5th Street",     city: "Brooklyn",     state: "NY",     zip: 11215   },   sub_total: 6196              }  Denormalized  sum of sale  prices  The second order attribute, user_id, stores a given user’s _id. It’s effectively a pointer to the sample user, which will be discussed in listing 4.4. This arrangement makes it easy to query either side of the relationship. Finding all orders for a given user is simple:  db.orders.find {user_id: user['_id']}   The query for getting the user for a particular order is equally simple:  db.users.findOne {_id: order['user_id']}   Using an object ID as a reference in this way, it’s easy to build a one-to-many relation- ship between orders and users. THINKING WITH DOCUMENTS We’ll  now  look  at  some  other  salient  aspects  of  the  order  document.  In  general, you’re  using  the  rich  representation  afforded  by  the  document  data  model.  Order  www.it-ebooks.info   82  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  documents include both the line items and the shipping address. These attributes, in a  normalized  relational  model,  would  be  located  in  separate  tables.  Here,  the  line items are an array of subdocuments, each describing a product in the shopping cart. The shipping address attribute points to a single object containing address fields.    This  representation  has  several  advantages.  First,  there’s  a  win  for  the  human mind.  Your  entire  concept  of  an  order,  including  line  items,  shipping  address,  and eventual payment information, can be encapsulated in a single entity. When querying the database, you can return the entire order object with one simple query. What’s more, the products, as they appeared when purchased, are effectively frozen within your order document. Finally, as you’ll see in the next two chapters, you can easily query and modify this order document.    The  user  document   shown  in  listing  4.4   presents  similar  patterns,  because  it stores a list of address documents along with a list of payment method documents. In addition, at the top level of the document, you find the basic attributes common to any user model. As with the slug field on your product, it’s smart to keep a unique index on the username field.  Listing 4.4 A user document, with addresses and payment methods  {    _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,   username: "kbanker",   email: "kylebanker@gmail.com",   first_name: "Kyle",   last_name: "Banker",   hashed_password: "bd1cfa194c3a603e7186780824b04419",   addresses: [     {       name: "home",       street: "588 5th Street",       city: "Brooklyn",       state: "NY",       zip: 11215     },     {       name: "work",       street: "1 E. 23rd Street",       city: "New York",       state: "NY",       zip: 10010     }   ],   payment_methods: [     {       name: "VISA",       payment_token: "43f6ba1dfda6b8106dc7"     }   ] }  www.it-ebooks.info   Designing an e-commerce data model  83  4.2.3 Reviews  We’ll close the sample data model with product reviews, shown in the following listing. Each  product  can  have  many  reviews,  and  you  create  this  relationship  by  storing  a product_id in each review.  Listing 4.5 A document representing a product review  {    _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000041" ,   product_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,   date: new Date 2010, 5, 7 ,   title: "Amazing",   text: "Has a squeaky wheel, but still a darn good wheelbarrow.",   rating: 4,   user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000042" ,   username: "dgreenthumb",   helpful_votes: 3,   voter_ids: [      ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000033" ,     ObjectId "7a4f0376238d3b4dd5000003" ,     ObjectId "92c21476238d3b4dd5000032"    ] }  Most of the remaining attributes are self-explanatory. You store the review’s date, title, and text; the rating provided by the user; and the user’s ID. But it may come as a sur- prise that you store the username as well. If this were an RDBMS, you’d be able to pull in the username with a join on the users table. Because you don’t have the join option with MongoDB, you can proceed in one of two ways: either query against the user col- lection  for  each  review  or  accept  some  denormalization.  Issuing  a  query  for  every review might be unnecessarily costly when username is extremely unlikely to change, so here we’ve chosen to optimize for query speed rather than normalization.   Also noteworthy is the decision to store votes in the review document itself. It’s common for users to be able to vote on reviews. Here, you store the object ID of each voting user in an array of voter IDs. This allows you to prevent users from voting on a review more than once, and it also gives you the ability to query for all the reviews a user has voted on. You cache the total number of helpful votes, which among other things allows you to sort reviews based on helpfulness. Caching is useful because Mon- goDB doesn’t allow you to query the size of an array within a document. A query to sort reviews by helpful votes, for example, is much easier if the size of the voting array is cached in the helpful_votes field.   At this point, we’ve covered a basic e-commerce data model. We’ve seen the basics of a schema with subdocuments, arrays, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and  how  to  use  denormalization  as  a  tool  to  make  your  queries  simpler.  If  this  is your first time looking at a MongoDB data model, contemplating the utility of this model may require a leap of faith. Rest assured that the mechanics of all of this—from  www.it-ebooks.info   84  4.3  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  adding votes uniquely, to modifying orders, to querying products intelligently—will be explored and explained in the next few chapters.  Nuts and bolts: On databases, collections,  and documents We’re going to take a break from the e-commerce example to look at some of the core details of using databases, collections, and documents. Much of this involves defini- tions, special features, and edge cases. If you’ve ever wondered how MongoDB allo- cates data files, which data types are strictly permitted within a document, or what the benefits of using capped collections are, read on.  4.3.1 Databases  A database is a namespace and physical grouping of collections and their indexes. In this  section,  we’ll  discuss  the  details  of  creating  and  deleting  databases.  We’ll  also jump down a level to see how MongoDB allocates space for individual databases on the filesystem.  MANAGING DATABASES There’s no explicit way to create a database in MongoDB. Instead, a database is cre- ated automatically once you write to a collection in that database. Have a look at this Ruby code:  connection = Mongo::Client.new  [ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'garden'   db = connection.database  Recall that the JavaScript shell performs this connection when you start it, and then allows you to select a database like this:  use garden  Assuming that the database doesn’t exist already, the database has yet to be created on disk even after executing this code. All you’ve done is instantiate an instance of the class Mongo::DB, which represents a MongoDB database. Only when you write to a col- lection are the data files created. Continuing on in Ruby,  products = db['products'] products.insert_one {:name => "Extra Large Wheelbarrow"}   When you call insert_one on the products collection, the driver tells MongoDB to insert  the  product  document  into  the  garden.products  collection.  If  that  collec- tion doesn’t exist, it’s created; part of this involves allocating the garden database on disk.   You can delete all the data in this collection by calling:  products.find {} .delete_many  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: On databases, collections, and documents  85  This removes all documents which match the filter {}, which is all documents in the collection. This command doesn’t remove the collection itself; it only empties it. To remove a collection entirely, you use the drop method, like this:  To delete a database, which means dropping all its collections, you issue a special com- mand. You can drop the garden database from Ruby like so:  From the MongoDB shell, run the dropDatabase   method using JavaScript:  products.drop  db.drop  use garden db.dropDatabase  ;  Be careful when dropping databases; there’s no way to undo this operation since it erases the associated files from disk. Let’s look in more detail at how databases store their data. DATA FILES AND ALLOCATION When you create a database, MongoDB allocates a set of data files on disk. All collec- tions, indexes, and other metadata for the database are stored in these files. The data files reside in whichever directory you designated as the dbpath when starting mongod. When left unspecified, mongod stores all its files in  data db.3 Let’s see how this direc- tory looks after creating the garden database:  $ cd  data db $ ls -lah drwxr-xr-x  81 pbakkum  admin   2.7K Jul  1 10:42 .    drwxr-xr-x   5 root     admin   170B Sep  19 2012 ..   -rw-------   1 pbakkum  admin    64M Jul  1 10:43 garden.0     -rw-------   1 pbakkum  admin   128M Jul  1 10:42 garden.1     -rw-------   1 pbakkum  admin    16M Jul  1 10:43 garden.ns    -rwxr-xr-x   1 pbakkum  admin     3B Jul  1 08:31 mongod.lock  These  files  depend  on  the  databases  you’ve  created  and  database  configuration,  so they will likely look different on your machine. First note the mongod.lock file, which stores the server’s process ID. Never delete or alter the lock file unless you’re recover- ing from an unclean shutdown. If you start mongod and get an error message about the lock file, there’s a good chance that you’ve shut down uncleanly, and you may have to initiate a recovery process. We discuss this further in chapter 11.   The database files themselves are all named after the database they belong to. gar- den.ns is the first file to be generated. The file’s extension, ns, stands for namespaces. The metadata for each collection and index in a database gets its own namespace file,  3 On Windows, it’s c:\data\db. If you install MongoDB with a package manager, it may store the files elsewhere.  For example using Homebrew on OS X places your data files in  usr local var mongodb.  www.it-ebooks.info   86  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  which is organized as a hash table. By default, the .ns file is fixed to 16 MB, which lets it store approximately 26,000 entries, given the size of their metadata. This means that the  sum  of  the  number  of  indexes  and  collections  in  your  database  can’t  exceed 26,000. There’s usually no good reason to have this many indexes and collections, but if you do need more than this, you can make the file larger by using the  --nssize option when starting mongod.   In addition to creating the namespace file, MongoDB allocates space for the collec- tions and indexes in files ending with incrementing integers starting with 0. Study the directory listing and you’ll see two core data files, the 64 MB garden.0 and the 128 MB garden.1.  The  initial  size  of  these  files  often  comes  as  a  shock  to  new  users.  But MongoDB  favors  this  preallocation  to  ensure  that  as  much  data  as  possible  will  be stored contiguously. This way, when you query and update the data, those operations are more likely to occur in proximity rather than being spread across the disk.   As you add data to your database, MongoDB continues to allocate more data files. Each new data file gets twice the space of the previously allocated file until the largest preallocated size of 2 GB is reached. At that point, subsequent files will all be 2  GB. Thus, garden.2 will be 256 MB, garden.3 will use 512 MB, and so forth. The assump- tion  here  is  that  if  the  total  data  size  is  growing  at  a  constant  rate,  the  data  files should be allocated increasingly, which is a common allocation strategy. Certainly one consequence is that the difference between allocated space and actual space used can be high.4   You can always check the amount of space used versus the amount allocated by  using the stats command in the JavaScript shell:  > db.stats   {                                 "db" : "garden",          "collections" : 3,        "objects" : 5,            "avgObjSize" : 49.6,      "dataSize" : 248,         "storageSize" : 12288,    "numExtents" : 3,         "indexes" : 1,            "indexSize" : 8176,       "fileSize" : 201326592,   "nsSizeMB" : 16,          "dataFileVersion" : {       "major" : 4,        "minor" : 5       },                        "ok" : 1                }                                4 This may present a problem in deployments where space is at a premium. For those situations, you may use  some combination of the --noprealloc and --smallfiles server options.  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: On databases, collections, and documents  87  In this example, the fileSize field indicates the total size of files allocated for this database. This is simply the sum of the sizes of the garden database’s two data files, garden.0 and garden.1. The difference between dataSize and storageSize is trick- ier.  The  former  is  the  actual  size  of  the  BSON  objects  in  the  database;  the  latter includes  extra  space  reserved  for  collection  growth  and  also  unallocated  deleted space.5 Finally, the indexSize value shows the total size of indexes for this database.    It’s important to keep an eye on total index size; database performance will be best when all utilized indexes can fit in RAM. We’ll elaborate on this in chapters 8 and 12 when presenting techniques for troubleshooting performance issues.     What  does  this  all  mean  when  you  plan  a  MongoDB  deployment?  In  practical terms, you should use this information to help plan how much disk space and RAM you’ll  need  to  run  MongoDB.  You  should  have  enough  disk  space  for  your  expected data size, plus a comfortable margin for the overhead of MongoDB storage, indexes, and room to grow, plus other files stored on the machine, such as log files. Disk space is gen- erally cheap, so it’s usually best to allocate more space than you think you’ll need.   Estimating how much RAM you’ll need is a little trickier. You’ll want enough RAM to comfortably fit your “working set” in memory. The working set is the data you touch regularly  in  running  your  application.  In  the  e-commerce  example,  you’ll  probably access the collections we covered, such products and categories collections, frequently while your application is running. These collections, plus their overhead and the size of their indexes, should fit into memory; otherwise there will be frequent disk accesses and  performance  will  suffer.  This  is  perhaps  the  most  common  MongoDB  perfor- mance  issue.  We  may  have  other  collections,  however,  that  we  only  need  to  access infrequently, such as during an audit, which we can exclude from the working set. In general, plan ahead for enough memory to fit the collections necessary for normal application operation.  Collections Collections are containers for structurally or conceptually similar documents. Here, we’ll  describe  creating  and  deleting  collections  in  more  detail.  Then  we’ll  present MongoDB’s  special  capped  collections,  and  we’ll  look  at  examples  of  how  the  core server uses collections internally. MANAGING COLLECTIONS As you saw in the previous section, you create collections implicitly by inserting docu- ments into a particular namespace. But because more than one collection type exists, MongoDB  also  provides  a  command  for  creating  collections.  It  provides  this  com- mand from the JavaScript shell:  db.createCollection "users"   4.3.2  5 Technically, collections are allocated space inside each data file in chunks called extents. The storageSize  is the total space allocated for collection extents.  www.it-ebooks.info   88  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  When creating a standard collection, you have the option of preallocating a specific number of bytes. This usually isn’t necessary but can be done like this in the Java- Script shell:  db.createCollection "users", {size: 20000}   Collection names may contain numbers, letters, or . characters, but must begin with a  letter  or  number.  Internally,  a  collection  name  is  identified  by  its  namespace name, which includes the name of the database it belongs to. Thus, the products collection is technically referred to as garden.products when referenced in a mes- sage to or from the core server. This fully qualified collection name can’t be longer than 128 characters.   It’s sometimes useful to include the . character in collection names to provide a kind of virtual namespacing. For instance, you can imagine a series of collections with titles like the following:  products.categories products.images products.reviews  Keep in mind that this is only an organizational principle; the database treats collec- tions named with a . like any other collection.   Collections can also be renamed. As an example, you can rename the products col-  lection with the shell’s renameCollection method:  db.products.renameCollection "store_products"   CAPPED COLLECTIONS In  addition  to  the  standard  collections  you’ve  created  so  far,  it’s  possible  to  create what’s known as a capped collection. Capped collections are originally designed for high-performance logging scenarios. They’re distinguished from standard collections by their fixed size. This means that once a capped collection reaches its maximum size, subsequent inserts will overwrite the least-recently-inserted documents in the col- lection.  This  design  prevents  users  from  having  to  prune  the  collection  manually when only recent data may be of value.    To  understand  how  you  might  use  a  capped  collection,  imagine  you  want  to keep track of users’ actions on your site. Such actions might include viewing a prod- uct, adding to the cart, checking out, and purchasing. You can write a script to sim- ulate  logging  these  user  actions  to  a  capped  collection.  In  the  process,  you’ll  see some of these collections’ interesting properties. The next listing presents a simple demonstration.  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: On databases, collections, and documents  89  Listing 4.6 Simulating the logging of user actions to a capped collection  require 'mongo'  VIEW_PRODUCT = 0      action type constants    ADD_TO_CART  = 1 CHECKOUT     = 2 PURCHASE     = 3  Action  types  b  client = Mongo::Client.new [ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'garden'  client[:user_actions].drop actions = client[:user_actions, :capped => true, :size => 16384]  actions.create  garden.user _actions  collection  500.times do n              loop 500 times, using n as the iterator   doc = {             :username => "kbanker",     :action_code => rand 4 ,  random value between 0 and 3, inclusive     :time => Time.now.utc,     :n => n   }   actions.insert_one doc  end              Sample document  First, you create a 16 KB capped collection called user_actions using client.6 Next, you  insert  500  sample  log  documents  B.  Each  document  contains  a  username,  an action code  represented as a random integer from 0 through 3 , and a timestamp. You’ve included an incrementing integer, n, so that you can identify which documents have aged out. Now you’ll query the collection from the shell:  > use garden > db.user_actions.count  ; 160  Even though you’ve inserted 500 documents, only 160 documents exist in the collec- tion.7 If you query the collection, you’ll see why:  db.user_actions.find  .pretty  ; {     "_id" : ObjectId "51d1c69878b10e1a0e000040" ,     "username" : "kbanker",     "action_code" : 3,     "time" : ISODate "2013-07-01T18:12:40.443Z" ,     "n" : 340 }   6 The  equivalent  creation  command  from  the  shell  would  be  db.createCollection "user_actions",  7 This number may vary depending on your version of MongoDB; the notable part is that it’s less than the num-  {capped: true, size: 16384} .  ber of documents inserted.  www.it-ebooks.info   90  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  {     "_id" : ObjectId "51d1c69878b10e1a0e000041" ,     "username" : "kbanker",     "action_code" : 2,     "time" : ISODate "2013-07-01T18:12:40.444Z" ,     "n" : 341 }  {     "_id" : ObjectId "51d1c69878b10e1a0e000042" ,     "username" : "kbanker",     "action_code" : 2,     "time" : ISODate "2013-07-01T18:12:40.445Z" ,     "n" : 342 } ...   The documents are returned in order of insertion. If you look at the n values, it’s clear that  the  oldest  document  in  the  collection  is  the  collection  where  n  is  340,  which means that documents 0 through 339 have already aged out. Because this capped col- lection has a maximum size of 16,384 bytes and contains only 160 documents, you can  conclude  that  each  document  is  about  102  bytes  in  length.  You’ll  see  how  to confirm this assumption in the next subsection. Try adding a field to the example to observe how the number of documents stored decreases as the average document size increases.   In addition to the size limit, MongoDB allows you to specify a maximum number of documents for a capped collection with the max parameter. This is useful because it allows finer-grained control over the number of documents stored. Bear in mind that  the  size  configuration  has  precedence.  Creating  a  collection  this  way  might look like this:  > db.createCollection "users.actions",      {capped: true, size: 16384, max: 100}   Capped collections don’t allow all operations available for a normal collection. For one,  you  can’t  delete  individual  documents  from  a  capped  collection,  nor  can  you perform any update that will increase the size of a document. Capped collections were originally designed for logging, so there was no need to implement the deletion or updating of documents. TTL COLLECTIONS MongoDB  also  allows  you  to  expire  documents  from  a  collection  after  a  certain amount of time has passed. These are sometimes called time-to-live  TTL  collections, though this functionality is actually implemented using a special kind of index. Here’s how you would create such a TTL index:  > db.reviews.createIndex {time_field: 1}, {expireAfterSeconds: 3600}   This  command  will  create  an  index  on  time_field.  This  field  will  be  periodically checked for a timestamp value, which is compared to the current time. If the difference  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: On databases, collections, and documents  91  between time_field and the current time is greater than your expireAfterSeconds setting,  then  the  document  will  be  removed  automatically.  In  this  example,  review documents will be deleted after an hour.   Using a TTL index in this way assumes that you store a timestamp in time_field.  Here’s an example of how to do this:  > db.reviews.insert {       time_field: new Date  ,       ...     }   This insertion sets time_field to the time at insertion. You can also insert other time- stamp values, such as a value in the future. Remember, TTL indexes just measure the difference between the indexed value and the current time, to compare to expire- AfterSeconds. Thus, if you put a future timestamp in this field, it won’t be deleted until  that  timestamp  plus  the  expireAfterSeconds  value.  This  functionality  can  be used to carefully manage the lifecycle of your documents.  TTL indexes have several restrictions. You can’t have a TTL index on _id, or on a field  used  in  another  index.  You  also  can’t  use  TTL  indexes  with  capped  collections because they don’t support removing individual documents. Finally, you can’t have com- pound TTL indexes, though you can have an array of timestamps in the indexed field. In that case, the TTL property will be applied to the earliest timestamp in the collection.  In practice, you may never find yourself using TTL collections, but they can be a  valuable tool in some cases, so it’s good to keep them in mind. SYSTEM COLLECTIONS Part of MongoDB’s design lies in its own internal use of collections. Two of these spe- cial  system  collections  are  system.namespaces  and  system.indexes.  You  can  query the former to see all the namespaces defined for the current database:  > db.system.namespaces.find  ; { "name" : "garden.system.indexes" }                  { "name" : "garden.products.$_id_" }                                { "name" : "garden.products" }                             { "name" : "garden.user_actions.$_id_" }                             { "name" : "garden.user_actions", "options" : { "create" : "user_actions",  "capped" : true, "size" : 1024 } }                              The  first  collection,  system.indexes,  stores  each  index  definition  for  the  current database. To see a list of indexes you’ve defined for the garden database, query the collection:  > db.system.indexes.find  ; { "v" : 1, "key" : { "_id" : 1 }, "ns" : "garden.products", "name" : "_id_" } { "v" : 1, "key" : { "_id" : 1 }, "ns" : "garden.user_actions", "name" :  "_id_" } { "v" : 1, "key" : { "time_field" : 1 }, "name" : "time_field_1", "ns" :  "garden.reviews", "expireAfterSeconds" : 3600 }  www.it-ebooks.info   92  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  system.namespaces  and  system.indexes  are  both  standard  collections,  and  access- ing them is a useful feature for debugging. MongoDB also uses capped collections for replication, a feature that keeps two or more mongod servers in sync with each other. Each member of a replica set logs all its writes to a special capped collection called oplog.rs. Secondary nodes then read from this collection sequentially and apply new operations to themselves. We’ll discuss replication in more detail in chapter 10.  4.3.3 Documents and insertion  We’ll round out this chapter with some details on documents and their insertion. DOCUMENT SERIALIZATION, TYPES, AND LIMITS All  documents  are  serialized  to  BSON  before  being  sent  to  MongoDB;  they’re  later deserialized from BSON. The driver handles this process and translates it from and to the appropriate data types in its programming language. Most of the drivers provide a simple interface for serializing from and to  BSON; this happens automatically when reading and writing documents. You don’t need to worry about this normally, but we’ll demonstrate it explicitly for educational purposes.    In the previous capped collections example, it was reasonable to assume that the sample document size was roughly 102 bytes. You can check this assumption by using the Ruby driver’s BSON serializer:  doc = {   :_id => BSON::ObjectId.new,   :username => "kbanker",   :action_code => rand 5 ,   :time => Time.now.utc,   :n => 1 } bson = doc.to_bson puts "Document {doc.inspect} takes up {bson.length} bytes as BSON"  The serialize method returns a byte array. If you run this code, you’ll get a BSON object 82 bytes long, which isn’t far from the estimate. The difference between the 82-byte  document  size  and  the  102-byte  estimate  is  due  to  normal  collection  and document overhead. MongoDB allocates a certain amount of space for a collection, but  must  also  store  metadata.  Additionally,  in  a  normal   uncapped   collection, updating a document can make it outgrow its current space, necessitating a move to a new location and leaving an empty space in the collection’s memory.8 Characteris- tics like these create a difference in the size of your data and the size MongoDB uses on disk.  8 For more details take a look at the padding factor configuration directive. The padding factor ensures that there’s some room for the document to grow before it has to be relocated. The padding factor starts at 1, so in the case of the first insertion, there’s no additional space allocated.  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: On databases, collections, and documents  93  Deserializing BSON is as straightforward with a little help from the StringIO class.  Try running this Ruby code to verify that it works:  string_io = StringIO.new bson  deserialized_doc = String.from_bson string_io  puts "Here's our document deserialized from BSON:" puts deserialized_doc.inspect  Note that you can’t serialize just any hash data structure. To serialize without error, the key names must be valid, and each of the values must be convertible into a BSON type. A valid key name consists of a string with a maximum length of 255 bytes. The string may  consist  of  any  combination  of  ASCII  characters,  with  three  exceptions:  it  can’t begin with a $, it must not contain any . characters, and it must not contain the null byte, except in the final position. When programming in Ruby, you may use symbols as hash keys, but they’ll be converted into their string equivalents when serialized.   It may seem odd, but the key names you choose affect your data size because key names are stored in the documents themselves. This contrasts with an RDBMS, where column  names  are  always  kept  separate  from  the  rows  they  refer  to.  When  using BSON, if you can live with dob in place of date_of_birth as a key name, you’ll save 10 bytes per document. That may not sound like much, but once you have a billion such documents,  you’ll  save  nearly  10  GB  of  data  size  by  using  a  shorter  key  name.  This doesn’t mean you should go to unreasonable lengths to ensure small key names; be sensible. But if you expect massive amounts of data, economizing on key names will save space.   In addition to valid key names, documents must contain values that can be serial- ized into BSON. You can view a table of BSON types, with examples and notes, at http:   bsonspec.org. Here, we’ll only point out some of the highlights and gotchas.  STRINGS All string values must be encoded as  UTF-8. Though  UTF-8 is quickly becoming the standard for character encoding, there are plenty of situations when an older encod- ing is still used. Users typically encounter issues with this when importing data gener- ated by legacy systems into MongoDB. The solution usually involves either converting to UTF-8 before inserting, or, bearing that, storing the text as the BSON binary type.9  NUMBERS BSON specifies three numeric types: double, int, and long. This means that BSON can encode any IEEE floating-point value and any signed integer up to 8 bytes in length. When serializing integers in dynamic languages, such as Ruby and Python, the driver will automatically determine whether to encode as an int or a long. In fact, there’s only  one  common  situation  where  a  number’s  type  must  be  made  explicit:  when you’re inserting numeric data via the JavaScript shell. JavaScript, unhappily, natively  9 Incidentally, if you’re new to character encodings, you owe it to yourself to read Joel Spolsky’s well-known  introduction  http:  mng.bz LVO6 .   www.it-ebooks.info   94  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  supports only a single numeric type called Number, which is equivalent to an IEEE 754 Double. Consequently, if you want to save a numeric value from the shell as an integer, you need to be explicit, using either NumberLong   or NumberInt  . Try this example:  db.numbers.save {n: 5} ; db.numbers.save {n: NumberLong 5 } ;  You’ve saved two documents to the numbers collection, and though their values are equal, the first is saved as a double and the second as a long integer. Querying for all documents where n is 5 will return both documents:  > db.numbers.find {n: 5} ; { "_id" : ObjectId "4c581c98d5bbeb2365a838f9" , "n" : 5 } { "_id" : ObjectId "4c581c9bd5bbeb2365a838fa" , "n" : NumberLong  5   }  You can see that the second value is marked as a long integer. Another way to see this is to query by BSON type using the special  $type operator. Each BSON type is identified  by  an  integer,  beginning  with  1.  If  you  consult  the  BSON  spec  at  http:   bsonspec.org, you’ll see that doubles are type 1 and 64-bit integers are type 18. Thus, you can query the collection for values by type:  > db.numbers.find {n: {$type: 1}} ; { "_id" : ObjectId "4c581c98d5bbeb2365a838f9" , "n" : 5 } > db.numbers.find {n: {$type: 18}} ; { "_id" : ObjectId "4c581c9bd5bbeb2365a838fa" , "n" : NumberLong  5   }  This verifies the difference in storage. You might never use the $type operator in pro- duction, but as seen here, it’s a great tool for debugging.   The only other issue that commonly arises with BSON numeric types is the lack of decimal  support.  This  means  that  if  you’re  planning  on  storing  currency  values  in MongoDB, you need to use an integer type and keep the values in cents. DATETIMES The BSON datetime type is used to store temporal values. Time values are represented using a signed 64-bit integer marking milliseconds since the Unix epoch. A negative value marks milliseconds prior to the epoch.10   A couple usage notes follow. First, if you’re creating dates in JavaScript, keep in mind that months in JavaScript dates are 0-based. This means that new Date 2011, 5, 11  will create a date object representing June 11, 2011. Next, if you’re using the Ruby driver to store temporal data, the BSON serializer expects a Ruby Time object in UTC. Consequently, you can’t use date classes that maintain a time zone because a  BSON datetime can’t encode that data.  10 The Unix epoch is defined as midnight, January 1, 1970, coordinated universal time  UTC . We discuss epoch  time briefly in section 3.2.1.  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: On databases, collections, and documents  95  VIRTUAL TYPES What if you must store your times with their time zones? Sometimes the basic BSON types don’t suffice. Though there’s no way to create a custom BSON type, you can compose the various primitive BSON values to create your own virtual type in a sub- document. For instance, if you wanted to store times with zone, you might use a docu- ment structure like this, in Ruby:  {   time_with_zone: {     time: new Date  ,     zone: "EST"   } }  It’s not difficult to write an application so that it transparently handles these compos- ite  representations.  This  is  usually  how  it’s  done  in  the  real  world.  For  example, Mongo-Mapper, an object mapper for MongoDB written in Ruby, allows you to define to_mongo and from_mongo methods for any object to accommodate these sorts of cus- tom composite types.   LIMITS ON DOCUMENTS BSON documents in MongoDB v2.0 and later are limited to 16 MB in size.11 The limit exists  for  two  related  reasons.  First,  it’s  there  to  prevent  developers  from  creating ungainly data models. Though poor data models are still possible with this limit, the 16 MB limit helps discourage schemas with oversized documents. If you find yourself needing  to  store  documents  greater  than  16  MB,  consider  whether  your  schema should split data into smaller documents, or whether a MongoDB document is even the right place to store such information—it may be better managed as a file.   The second reason for the 16 MB limit is performance-related. On the server side, querying a large document requires that the document be copied into a buffer before being  sent  to  the  client.  This  copying  can  get  expensive,  especially   as  is  often  the case   when  the  client  doesn’t  need  the  entire  document.12  In  addition,  once  sent, there’s the work of transporting the document across the network and then deserializ- ing it on the driver side. This can become especially costly if large batches of multi- megabyte documents are being requested at once.   MongoDB documents are also limited to a maximum nesting depth of 100. Nesting occurs whenever you store a document within a document. Using deeply nested docu- ments—for  example,  if  you  wanted  to  serialize  a  tree  data  structure  to  a  MongoDB  11 The number has varied by server version and is continually increasing. To see the limit for your server version, run db.isMaster   in the shell and examine the maxBsonObjectSize field. If you can’t find this field, then the limit is 4 MB  and you’re using a very old version of MongoDB . You can find more on limits like this at http:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference limits.  12 As you’ll see in the next chapter, you can always specify which fields of a document to return in a query to  limit response size. If you’re doing this frequently, it may be worth reevaluating your data model.  www.it-ebooks.info   96  CHAPTER 4 Document-oriented data  document—results in documents that are difficult to query and can cause problems during access. These types of data structures are usually accessed through recursive function calls, which can outgrow their stack for especially deeply nested documents.  If you find yourself with documents hitting the size or nesting limits, you’re proba- bly better off splitting them up, modifying your data model, or using an extra collec- tion or two. If you’re storing large binary objects, like images or videos, that’s a slightly different case. See appendix C for techniques on handling large binary objects.  BULK INSERTS As soon as you have valid documents, the process of inserting them is straightforward. Most of the relevant details about inserting documents, including object ID genera- tion, how inserts work on the network layer, and checking for exceptions, were cov- ered in chapter 3. But one final feature, bulk inserts, is worth discussing here.   All of the drivers make it possible to insert multiple documents at once. This can be extremely handy if you’re inserting lots of data, as in an initial bulk import or a migra- tion from another database system. Here’s a simple Ruby example of this feature:  docs = [                        define an array of documents   { :username => 'kbanker' },   { :username => 'pbakkum' },   { :username => 'sverch' } ]  @col = @db['test_bulk_insert'] @ids = @col.insert_many docs         pass the entire array to insert  puts "Here are the ids from the bulk insert: {@ids.inspect}"  Instead of returning a single object ID, a bulk insert returns an array with the object IDs of all documents inserted. This is standard for MongoDB drivers.    Bulk inserts are useful mostly for performance. Inserting this way means only a sin- gle roundtrip of communication to the server, rather than three separate roundtrips. This method has a limit, however, so if you want to insert a million documents, you’ll have to split this into multiple bulk inserts of a group of documents.13    Users  commonly  ask  what  the  ideal  bulk  insert  size  is,  but  the  answer  to  this  is dependent  on  too  many  factors  to  respond  concretely,  and  the  ideal  number  can range from 10 to 200. Benchmarking will be the best counsel in this case. The only limitation imposed by the database here is a 16 MB cap on any one insert operation. Experience shows that the most efficient bulk inserts will fall well below this limit.  4.4  Summary We’ve covered a lot of ground in this chapter; congratulations for making it this far!   We began with a theoretical discussion of schema design and then proceeded to outline the data model for an e-commerce application. This gave you a chance to see  13 The limit for bulk inserts is 16 MB.  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary  97  what documents might look like in a production system, and it should have started you  thinking  in  a  more  concrete  way  about  the  differences  between  schemas  in RDMBSs and MongoDB.   We ended the chapter with a harder look at databases, documents, and collections; you may return to this section later on for reference. We’ve explained the rudiments of MongoDB, but we haven’t started moving data around. That will all change in the next chapter, where you’ll explore the power of ad hoc queries.  www.it-ebooks.info   Constructing queries  This chapter covers   Querying an e-commerce data model   The MongoDB query language in detail   Query selectors and options  MongoDB  doesn’t  use  SQL.  It  instead  features  its  own  JSON-like  query  language. You’ve  explored  this  language  throughout  the  book,  but  now  let’s  turn  to  some meatier, real-world examples. You’ll revisit the e-commerce data model introduced in the previous chapter and present a variety of queries against it. Among the que- ries you’ll practice are _id lookups, ranges, ordering, and projections. This chapter then  surveys  the  MongoDB  query  language  as  a  whole,  looking  at  each  available query operator in detail.   Keep in mind as you’re reading this chapter that MongoDB’s query language and aggregation functions  which chapter 6 covers  are still works in progress, and refine- ments are being added with each release. As it stands, mastering queries and aggre- gations  in  MongoDB  isn’t  so  much  a  matter  of  mapping  out  every  nook  as  it  is finding the best ways to accomplish everyday tasks. Through the examples in this chapter, you’ll learn the clearest routes to take. By the end of the chapter, you should have a good intuitive understanding of queries in MongoDB, and you’ll be ready to apply these tools to the design of application schemas.  98  www.it-ebooks.info   5.1  5.1.1  E-commerce queries  99  E-commerce queries This section continues our exploration of the e-commerce data model sketched out in the previous chapter. You’ve defined a document structure for products, categories, users, orders, and product reviews. Now, with that structure in mind, we’ll show you how you might query these entities in a typical e-commerce application. Some of these queries are simple. For instance, _id lookups shouldn’t be a mystery at this point. But we’ll also show you a few more sophisticated patterns, including querying for and dis- playing a category hierarchy, as well as providing filtered views of product listings. In addition,  we’ll  keep  efficiency  in  mind  by  looking  at  possible  indexes  for  some  of these queries.  Products, categories, and reviews Most e-commerce applications provide at least two basic views of products and catego- ries.  First  is  the  product  home  page,  which  highlights  a  given  product,  displays reviews, and gives some sense of the product’s categories. Second is the product listing page, which allows users to browse the category hierarchy and view thumbnails of all the products within a selected category. Let’s begin with the product home page, in many ways the simpler of the two.   Imagine that your product page URLs are keyed on a product slug  you learned about these user-friendly permalinks in chapter 4 . In that case, you can get all the data you need for your product page with the following three queries:  product = db.products.findOne {'slug': 'wheel-barrow-9092'}  db.categories.findOne {'_id': product['main_cat_id']}  db.reviews.find {'product_id': product['_id']}   The first query finds the product with the slug  wheel-barrow-9092. Once you have your product, you query for its category information with a simple _id query on the categories collection. Finally, you issue another simple lookup that gets all the reviews associated with the product. FINDONE VS. FIND QUERIES  You’ll notice that the first two queries use the findOne method but the last uses find instead. All of the MongoDB drivers provide these two methods, so it’s worth reviewing the difference between them. As discussed in chapter 3, find returns a cursor object, whereas findOne returns a document. The findOne method is similar to the following, though a cursor is returned even when you apply a limit:  db.products.find {'slug': 'wheel-barrow-9092'} .limit 1   If you’re expecting a single document, findOne will return that document if it exists. If you need to return multiple documents, use find. You’ll then need to iterate over that cursor somewhere in your application.   If your findOne query matches multiple items in the database, it’ll return the first item in the natural sort order of the documents in the collection. In most cases  but  www.it-ebooks.info   100  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  not always  this is the same order that the documents were inserted into the collec- tion, and for capped collections, it’s always the case. If you expect multiple result doc- uments, you should almost always use a find query or explicitly sort the results.   Now look again at the product page queries. See anything unsettling? If the query for reviews seems a bit liberal, you’re right. This query says to return all reviews for the given product, but doing so wouldn’t be prudent in cases where a product had hun- dreds of reviews.  SKIP, LIMIT, AND SORT QUERY OPTIONS Most applications paginate reviews, and for enabling this MongoDB provides skip and limit options. You can use these options to paginate the review document like this:  db.reviews.find {'product_id': product['_id']} .skip 0 .limit 12   Notice  how  you  set  these  options  by  calling  the  skip  and  limit  methods  on  the returned value of find. This can be confusing because it’s a different pattern than you usually see, even in other MongoDB drivers. They appear to be called after the query, but the sorting and limiting parameters are sent with the query and handled by the MongoDB server. This syntax pattern, called method chaining, is intended to make it easier to build queries.    You also want to display reviews in a consistent order, which means you have to sort your query results. If you want to sort by the number of helpful votes received by each review, you can specify that easily:  db.reviews.find {'product_id': product['_id']} .                    sort {'helpful_votes': -1} .                    limit 12   In short, this query tells MongoDB to return the first 12 reviews sorted by the total number  of  helpful  votes  in  descending  order.  Now,  with  skip,  limit,  and  sort  in place, you need to decide whether to paginate in the first place. For this, you can issue a count query. You then use the results of the count in combination with the page of reviews you want. Your queries for the product page are complete:  page_number = 1 product  = db.products.findOne {'slug': 'wheel-barrow-9092'}  category = db.categories.findOne {'_id': product['main_cat_id']}  reviews_count = db.reviews.count {'product_id': product['_id']}  reviews = db.reviews.find {'product_id': product['_id']} .                            skip  page_number - 1  * 12 .                            limit 12 .                            sort {'helpful_votes': -1}   The order in which you call skip, limit, and sort in the JavaScript shell doesn’t matter.   These lookups should use indexes. You’ve already seen that slugs should have a unique  index  on  them  because  they  serve  as  alternate  primary  keys,  and  you  know that all _id fields will automatically have a unique index for standard collections. But  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce queries  101  it’s also important that you have an index on any fields acting as references. In this case, that would include the user_id and product_id fields on the reviews collection.  PRODUCT LISTING PAGE With the queries for the product home pages in place, you can now turn to the prod- uct listing page. Such a page will display a given category with a browsable listing of products. Links to parent and sibling categories will also appear on the page.   A product listing page is defined by its category; thus, requests for the page will use  the category’s slug:  page_number = 1 category = db.categories.findOne {'slug': 'gardening-tools'}  siblings = db.categories.find {'parent_id': category['_id']}  products = db.products.find {'category_id': category['_id']}                             .skip  page_number - 1  * 12                             .limit 12                             .sort {'helpful_votes': -1}   Siblings are any other categories with the same parent ID, so the query for siblings is straightforward. Because products all contain an array of category IDs, the query for finding all products in a given category is also trivial. You can imagine providing alter- native sort methods  by name, price, and so forth . For those cases, you change the sort field.   It’s important to consider whether these sorts will be efficient. You may choose to rely on your index to handle sorting for you, but as you add more sort options, the number of indexes grows, and the cost of maintaining those indexes may not be rea- sonable because each index makes writes slightly more expensive. We’ll discuss this further in chapter 8, but start thinking about these trade-offs now.   The product listing page has a base case, where you’re viewing the root-level cate- gories but no products. A query against the categories collection for a null parent ID is all that’s required to get these root-level categories:  categories = db.categories.find {'parent_id': null}   5.1.2 Users and orders  The queries in the previous section were generally limited to _id lookups and sorts. In looking  at  users  and  orders,  we’ll  dig  deeper  because  you’ll  want  to  generate  basic reports on orders. The example queries search documents that look like those from chapter 4, listing 4.1  products  and listing 4.4  users .   Let’s start with something simpler: user authentication. Users log in to the applica- tion by providing a username and password. Thus, you’d expect to see the following query frequently:  db.users.findOne {     'username': 'kbanker',     'hashed_password': 'bd1cfa194c3a603e7186780824b04419'}   www.it-ebooks.info   102  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  If the user exists and the password is correct, you’ll get back an entire user document; otherwise, the query will return nothing. This query is acceptable, but why should you return the entire user document if you only want to check that the user exists? You can limit the fields returned using a projection:  db.users.findOne {   'username': 'kbanker',   'hashed_password': 'bd1cfa194c3a603e7186780824b04419'},   {'_id': 1}   In the JavaScript shell you do a projection by passing in an additional argument: a hash of the fields you want with their values set to 1. We discuss projections more in section  5.2.2.  If  you’re  already  familiar  with  SQL  and  RDBMS,  this  is  the  difference between SELECT * and SELECT ID. The response now consists exclusively of the docu- ment’s _id field:  { "_id": ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001"  }  PARTIAL MATCH QUERIES IN USERS You might want to query the users collection in a few other ways, such as searching by name. Often you’ll want to perform a lookup on a single field, such as last_name:  db.users.find {'last_name': 'Banker'}   This approach works, but there are limits to searching for an exact match. For one, you might not know how to spell a given user’s name. In this case, you’ll want some way of querying for a partial match. Suppose you know that the user’s last name starts with Ba. MongoDB allows you to query using regular expressions:  db.users.find {'last_name':  ^Ba }   The regular expression  ^Ba  can be read as “the beginning of the line followed by a B followed by an a.” A prefix search like this one can take advantage of an index, but not all regular expression queries can use an index. QUERYING SPECIFIC RANGES When it comes to marketing to your users, you’ll most likely want to target ranges of users. For instance, if you want to query for all users residing in Upper Manhattan, you issue this range query on a user’s zip code:  db.users.find {'addresses.zip': {'$gt': 10019, '$lt': 10040}}   Recall that each user document contains an array of one or more addresses. This query will match a user document if any zip code among those addresses falls within the given range. You can use the $gte  greater than  and $lt  less than  operators to define this range. To make this query efficient, you’ll want an index defined on addresses.zip.   You’ll see more examples of querying this data in the next chapter, and later on, you’ll learn how to get insight from the data using MongoDB’s aggregation functions.  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s query language  103  But with this introduction under your belt, we’ll now look at MongoDB’s query language in some depth, explaining the syntax in general and each operator in particular.  5.2 MongoDB’s query language  It’s time we explore MongoDB’s query language in all its glory. We’ve already walked through some real-world query examples; this section is intended as a more compre- hensive reference of MongoDB query capabilities. If you’re learning about MongoDB queries for the first time, it may be easier to skim this section and revisit it when you need to write more advanced queries for your application.   5.2.1 Query criteria and selectors  Query  criteria  allow  you  to  use  one  or  more  query  selectors  to  specify  the  query’s results. MongoDB gives you many possible selectors. This section provides an overview. SELECTOR MATCHING The  simplest  way  to  specify  a  query  is  with  a  selector  whose  key-value  pairs  literally match against the document you’re looking for. Here are a couple of examples:  db.users.find {'last_name': "Banker"}  db.users.find {'first_name': "Smith", birth_year: 1975}   The second query reads, “Find me all users such that the first_name is Smith and was born in 1975.” Note that whenever you pass more than one key-value pair, both must match; the query conditions function as a Boolean AND. If you want to express a Bool- ean OR, see the upcoming section on Boolean operators.   In MongoDB all text string matches are case sensitive. If you need to perform case- insensitive  matches,  consider  using  a  regex  term   explained  later  in  this  chapter, when we discuss the use of the i regex flag  or investigate the use of text search intro- duced in chapter 9.  RANGES You frequently need to query for documents the values of which span a certain range. In most languages, you use  , and >=. With MongoDB, you get the analogous set of  operators  $lt,  $lte,  $gt,  and  $gte.  You’ve  used  these  operators  throughout  the book, and they work as you’d expect. Table 5.1 shows the range query operators most commonly used in MongoDB.  Table 5.1 Summary of range query operators  Operator  Description  $lt  $gt  $lte  $gte  Less than  Greater than  Less than or equal  Greater than or equal  www.it-ebooks.info   104  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  Beginners sometimes struggle with combining these operators. A common mistake is to repeat the search key:  db.users.find {'birth_year': {'$gte': 1985}, 'birth_year': {'$lte': 2015}}   The aforementioned query only takes into account the last condition. You can prop- erly express this query as follows:  db.users.find {'birth_year': {'$gte': 1985, '$lte': 2015}}   You  should  also  know  how  these  work  with  different  data  types.  Range  queries  will match values only if they have the same type as the value to be compared against.1 For example, suppose you have a collection with the following documents:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4caf82011b0978483ea29ada" , "value" : 97 } { "_id" : ObjectId "4caf82031b0978483ea29adb" , "value" : 98 } { "_id" : ObjectId "4caf82051b0978483ea29adc" , "value" : 99 } { "_id" : ObjectId "4caf820d1b0978483ea29ade" , "value" : "a" } { "_id" : ObjectId "4caf820f1b0978483ea29adf" , "value" : "b" } { "_id" : ObjectId "4caf82101b0978483ea29ae0" , "value" : "c" }  You then issue the following query:  db.items.find {'value': {'$gte': 97}}   You may think that this query should return all six documents because the strings are numerically equivalent to the integers 97, 98, and 99. But this isn’t the case. As MongoDB is schemaless, this query returns the integer results only because the crite- ria supplied was an integer itself. If you want the string results, you must query with a string instead:  db.items.find {'value': {'$gte': "a"}}   You won’t need to worry about this type restriction as long as you never store multiple types for the same key within the same collection. This is a good general practice, and you should abide by it. SET OPERATORS Three query operators—$in, $all, and $nin—take a list of one or more values as their predicate, so these are called set operators. $in returns a document if any of the given values matches the search key. You might use this operator to return all products  belonging  to  some  discrete  set  of  categories.  Table  5.2  shows  these  set query operators.  1 Note that the numeric types—integer, long integer, and double—have type equivalence for these queries.  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s query language  105  Table 5.2 Summary of set operators  Operator  Description  $in  $all  $nin  Matches if any of the arguments are in the referenced set  Matches if all of the arguments are in the referenced set and is used in documents  that contain arrays  Matches if none of the arguments are in the referenced set  corresponds to the lawnmowers, hand tools, and work clothing categories, the query to find all products belonging to these categories looks like this:  If the following list of category IDs  [   ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,   ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000051" ,   ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000057"  ]  db.products.find {     'main_cat_id': {        '$in': [         ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,         ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000051" ,         ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000057"        ]     }   }   Another way of thinking about the $in operator is as a kind of Boolean inclusive OR against a single attribute. Expressed this way, the previous query might be read, “Find me all products of which the category is lawnmowers or hand tools or work clothing.” Note that if you need a Boolean OR over multiple attributes, you’ll want to use the $or operator, described in the next section:     $in is frequently used with lists of IDs.    $nin   not  in    returns  a  document  only  when  none  of  the  given  elements matches. You might use $nin to find all products that are neither black nor blue:  db.products.find {'details.color': {'$nin': ["black", "blue"]}}     $all matches if every given element matches the search key. If you wanted to  find all products tagged as gift and garden, $all would be a good choice:  db.products.find {'tags': {'$all': ["gift", "garden"]}}   www.it-ebooks.info   106  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  Naturally, this query makes sense only if the tags attribute stores an array of terms, like this:  {    'name': "Bird Feeder",   'tags': [ "gift", "birds", "garden" ] }  Selectivity is the ability of a query to narrow results using the index. The problem is that both $ne and $nin operators aren’t selective. Therefore, when using the set oper- ators, keep in mind that $in and $all can take advantage of indexes, but $nin can’t and thus requires a collection scan. If you use $nin, try to use it in combination with another query term that does use an index. Better yet, find a different way to express the query. You may, for instance, be able to store an attribute whose presence indi- cates a condition equivalent to your $nin query. For example, if you commonly issue a query  for  {timeframe:  {$nin:  ['morning',  'afternoon']}},  you  may  be  able  to express this more directly as {timeframe: 'evening'}.  BOOLEAN OPERATORS MongoDB’s Boolean operators include $ne, $not, $or, $and, $nor, and $exists. Table 5.3 summarizes the Boolean operators.  Table 5.3 Summary of Boolean operators  Operator  Description  $ne  $not  $or  $nor  $and  Matches if the argument is not equal to the element  Inverts the result of a match  Matches if any of the supplied set of query terms is true  Matches if none of the supplied set of query terms are true  Matches if all of the supplied set of query terms are true  $exists  Matches if the element exists in the document.  $ne, the not equal to operator, works as you’d expect. In practice, it’s best used in com- bination with at least one other operator; otherwise, it’s likely to be inefficient because it can’t take advantage of indexes. For example, you might use $ne to find all products manufactured by Acme that aren’t tagged with gardening:  db.products.find {'details.manufacturer': 'Acme', tags: {$ne: "gardening"} }   $ne works on keys pointing to single values and to arrays, as shown in the example where you match against the tags array.   Whereas $ne matches the negation of a specified value, $not negates the result of another MongoDB operator or regular expression query. Most query operators already  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s query language  107  have a negated form  $in and $nin, $gt and $lte, and so on ; $not is useful because it includes documents that aren’t evaluated by the given expression. Consider the fol- lowing example:  db.users.find {'age': {'$not': {'$lte': 30}}}   As you’d expect, this query returns documents where age is greater than 30. It also returns documents with no age field, which makes it distinct from using the $gt oper- ator in this case.  $or expresses the logical disjunction of two values for two different keys. This is an important point: if the possible values are scoped to the same key, use  $in instead. Trivially, finding all products that are either blue or green looks like this:  db.products.find {'details.color': {$in: ['blue', 'Green']}}   But finding all products that are either blue or made by Acme requires $or:  db.products.find {     '$or': [       {'details.color': 'blue'},        {'details.manufacturer': 'Acme'}     ]   }   $or takes an array of query selectors, where each selector can be arbitrarily complex and may itself contain other query operators. $nor works much the same as $or but is logically true only when none of its query selectors are true.   Like $or, the $and operator takes an array of query selectors. Because MongoDB interprets all query selectors containing more than one key by ANDing the conditions, you should use $and only when you can’t express an AND in a simpler way. For exam- ple,  suppose  you  want  to  find  all  products  that  are  tagged  with  gift  or  holiday  and either gardening or landscaping. The only way to express this query is with the conjunc- tion of two $in queries:   db.products.find {     $and: [       {         tags: {$in: ['gift', 'holiday']}       },       {         tags: {$in: ['gardening', 'landscaping']}       }     ]   }   QUERYING FOR A DOCUMENT WITH A SPECIFIC KEY The final operator we’ll discuss in this section is $exists. This operator is necessary because collections don’t enforce a fixed schema, so you occasionally need a way to query  for  documents  containing  a  particular  key.  Recall  that  you’d  planned  to  use  www.it-ebooks.info   108  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  each product’s details attribute to store custom fields. You might, for instance, store a color field inside the details attribute. But if only a subset of all products specify a set of colors, then you can query for the ones that don’t like this:  db.products.find {'details.color': {$exists: false}}   The opposite query is also possible:  db.products.find {'details.color': {$exists: true}}   Here  you’re  checking  whether  the  field  exists  in  a  document  at  all.  Even  if  a  field exists, it can still be set to null. Depending on your data and query, you may want to filter those values as well. MATCHING SUBDOCUMENTS Some of the entities in this book’s e-commerce data model have keys that point to a single embedded object. The product’s details attribute is one good example. Here’s part of the relevant document, expressed as JSON:  {    _id:  ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,   slug: "wheel-barrow-9092",   sku:  "9092",   details: {     model_num: 4039283402,     manufacturer: "Acme",     manufacturer_id: 432,     color:  "Green"   } }  You can query such objects by separating the relevant keys with a .  dot . For instance, if you want to find all products manufactured by Acme, you can use this query:  db.products.find {'details.manufacturer': "Acme"} ;  Such  queries  can  be  specified  arbitrarily  deep.  Supposing  you  had  the  following slightly modified representation  {    _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,   slug: "wheel-barrow-9092",   sku: "9092",   details: {     model_num: 4039283402,     manufacturer: {        name: "Acme",       id: 432     },     color:  "Green"   } }  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s query language  109  the key in the query selector would contain two dots:  db.products.find {'details.manufacturer.id': 432} ;  But  in  addition  to  matching  against  an  individual  subdocument  attribute,  you  can match  an  object  as  a  whole.  For  example,  imagine  you’re  using  MongoDB  to  store stock market positions. To save space, you forgo the standard object ID and replace it with a compound key consisting of a stock symbol and a timestamp. Here’s how a rep- resentative document might look:2  {    _id: {     sym: 'GOOG',     date: 20101005   }   open:  40.23,   high:  45.50,   low:   38.81,   close: 41.22 }  You could then find the summary of GOOG for October 5, 2010 with the following _id query:  db.ticks.find {'_id': {'sym': 'GOOG', 'date': 20101005}}   It’s important to realize that a query matching an entire object like this will perform a strict byte-by-byte comparison, which means that the order of the keys matters. The following query isn’t equivalent and won’t match the sample document:  db.ticks.find {'_id': {'date': 20101005, 'sym': 'GOOG'}}   Though  the  order  of  keys  will  be  preserved  in  JSON  documents  entered  via  the shell, this isn’t necessarily true for other programming languages, and it’s safer to assume  that  order  won’t  be  preserved.  For  example,  hashes  in  Ruby  1.8  aren’t order-preserving. To preserve key order in Ruby 1.8, you must use an object of class BSON::OrderedHash instead:  doc = BSON::OrderedHash.new doc['sym']  = 'GOOG' doc['date'] = 20101005 @ticks.find doc   Be sure to check whether the language you’re using supports ordered dictionaries; if not, the language’s MongoDB driver will always provide an ordered alternative.   2 In a potential high-throughput scenario, you’d want to limit document size as much as possible. You could  accomplish this in part by using short key names. Thus you might use the key name o in place of open.  www.it-ebooks.info   110  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  ARRAYS Arrays give the document model much of its power. As you’ve seen in the e-commerce example, arrays are used to store lists of strings, object  IDs, and even other docu- ments.  Arrays  afford  rich  yet  comprehensible  documents;  it  stands  to  reason  that MongoDB would let you query and index the array type with ease. And it’s true: the simplest array queries look like queries on any other document type, as you can see in table 5.4.  Table 5.4 Summary of array operators  Operator  Description  $elemMatch  Matches if all supplied terms are in the same subdocument  $size  Matches if the size of the array subdocument is the same as the supplied literal value  Let’s  look  at  these  arrays  in  action.  Take  product  tags  again.  These  tags  are  repre- sented as a simple list of strings:  {    _id:  ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,   slug: "wheel-barrow-9092",   sku:  "9092",   tags: ["tools", "equipment", "soil"] }  Querying for products with the tag "soil" is trivial and uses the same syntax as query- ing a single document value:  db.products.find {tags: "soil"}   Importantly, this query can take advantage of an index on the tags field. If you build the required index and run your query with explain  , you’ll see that a B-tree cursor3 is used:  db.products.ensureIndex {tags: 1}  db.products.find {tags: "soil"} .explain    When  you  need  more  control  over  your  array  queries,  you  can  use  dot  notation  to query for a value at a particular position within the array. Here’s how you’d restrict the previous query to the first of a product’s tags:  db.products.find {'tags.0': "soil"}   3 The WiredTiger storage engine can support additional data structures for indexing. You can find more infor-  mation about it in chapter 10.  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s query language  111  It might not make much sense to query tags in this way, but imagine you’re dealing with user addresses. You might represent these with an array of subdocuments:  {    _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001"    username: "kbanker",   addresses: [     {       name:    "home",       street:  "588 5th Street",       city:    "Brooklyn",       state:   "NY",       zip:     11215     },     {       name:   "work",       street: "1 E. 23rd Street",       city:   "New York",       state   "NY",       zip     10010     },   ] }  You might stipulate that the zeroth element of the array always be the user’s primary shipping  address.  Thus,  to  find  all  users  whose  primary  shipping  address  is  in  New York, you could again specify the zeroth position and combine that with a dot to target the state field:  db.users.find {'addresses.0.state': "NY"}   As you can easily understand, you shouldn’t stipulate when writing production code.   You  can  just  as  easily  omit  the  position  and  specify  a  field  alone.  The  following  query will return a user document if any of the addresses in the list is in New York:  db.users.find {'addresses.state': "NY"}   As before, you’ll want to index this dotted field:  db.users.ensureIndex {'addresses.state': 1}   Note that you use the same dot notation regardless of whether a field points to a sub- document  or  to  an  array  of  subdocuments.  The  dot  notation  is  powerful,  and  the consistency is reassuring. But ambiguity can arise when querying against more than one attribute within an array of subobjects. For example, suppose you want to fetch a list of all users whose home address is in New York. Can you think of a way to express this query?  db.users.find {'addresses.name': 'home', 'addresses.state': 'NY'}   www.it-ebooks.info   112  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  The problem with this query is that the field references aren’t restricted to a single address. In other words, this query will match as long as one of the addresses is desig- nated as “home” and one is in New York, but what you want is for both attributes to apply to the same address. Fortunately, there’s a query operator for this. To restrict multiple conditions to the same subdocument, you use the $elemMatch operator. You can properly satisfy the query like this:  db.users.find {     'addresses': {       '$elemMatch': {         'name': 'home',          'state': 'NY'       }     }   }   Logically, use $elemMatch only when you need to match two or more attributes in a subdocument. QUERYING FOR AN ARRAY BY SIZE The only array operator left to discuss is the $size operator. This operator allows you to query for an array by its size. For example, if you want to find all users with exactly three addresses, you can use the $size operator like this:  db.users.find {'addresses': {$size: 3}}   As  of  this  writing,  the  $size  operator  doesn’t  use  an  index  and  is  limited  to  exact matches  you can’t specify a range of sizes .4 Therefore, if you need to perform queries based on the size of an array, you should cache the size in its own attribute within the document and update it manually as the array changes. For instance, you might con- sider adding an address_length field to your user document. You could then build an index on this field and issue all the range and exact match queries you require. A possi- ble solution is to use the aggregation framework, which is described in chapter 6.  JAVASCRIPT QUERY OPERATORS If you can’t express your query with the tools described thus far, you may need to write some JavaScript. You can use the special $where operator to pass a JavaScript expres- sion to any query, as summarized here:    $where         Execute some arbitrary JavaScript to select a document  Within a JavaScript context, the keyword this refers to the current document. Let’s take a contrived example:  db.reviews.find {     '$where': "function   { return this.helpful_votes > 3; }"   }   4 See https:  jira.mongodb.org browse SERVER-478 for updates on this issue.  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s query language  113  There’s also an abbreviated form for simple expressions like this one:  db.reviews.find {'$where': "this.helpful_votes > 3"}   This query works, but you’d never want to use it because you can easily express it using other query operators. The problem is that JavaScript expressions can’t use an index, and  they  incur  substantial  overhead  because  they  must  be  evaluated  within  a  Java- Script interpreter context and are single-threaded. For these reasons, you should issue JavaScript queries only when you can’t express your query using other query opera- tors. If you do need JavaScript, try to combine the JavaScript expression with at least one  other  query  operator.  The  other  query  operator  will  pare  down  the  result  set, reducing  the  number  of  documents  that  must  be  loaded  into  a  JavaScript  context. Let’s look at a quick example to see how this might make sense.    Imagine  that  for  each  user,  you’ve  calculated  a  rating  reliability  factor.  This  is essentially an integer that, when multiplied by the user’s rating, results in a more nor- malized  rating.  Also  suppose  that  you  want  to  query  a  particular  user’s  reviews  and return only a normalized rating greater than 3. Here’s how that query would look:  db.reviews.find {     'user_id': ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,     '$where': " this.rating * .92  > 3"   }   This query meets both recommendations: it uses a standard query on a presumably indexed user_id field, and it employs a JavaScript expression that’s absolutely beyond the  capabilities  of  other  query  operators.  Keep  in  mind  that  sometimes  using  the Aggregation framework can make your life easier.   In addition to recognizing the attendant performance penalties, it’s good to be aware of the possibility of JavaScript injection attacks. An injection attack becomes pos- sible  whenever  a  user  is  allowed  to  enter  code  directly  into  a  JavaScript  query.  An example is when the user submits a web form and the values are used directly in this sort of query. If the user sets the values of attribute or value, this query is unsafe:  @users.find {'$where' => "this.{attribute} == {value}"}   In this case, the values of attribute and value are inserted into a string, which is then evaluated to JavaScript. This approach is dangerous because users could potentially include JavaScript code in the values they send, giving them access to other data in the collection. This would result in a serious security breach if a malicious user was able to see data about other users. In general, you should always assume that your users can and will send you malicious data and plan accordingly.  REGULAR EXPRESSIONS You saw near the beginning of the chapter that you can use a regular expression within a  query.  In  that  example,  you  used  a  prefix  expression,   ^Ba ,  to  find  last  names  www.it-ebooks.info   114  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  beginning  with  Ba,  and  I  pointed  out  that  this  query  would  use  an  index.  In  fact, much more is possible. MongoDB is compiled with Perl Compatible Regular Expres- sions  PCRE; http:  mng.bz hxmh , which supports a huge gamut of regular expres- sions. The $regex operator is summarized here:    $regex         Match the element against the supplied regex term   With the exception of the prefix-style query just described, regular expressions que- ries can’t use an index and take longer to execute than most selectors. We recom- mend using them sparingly. Here’s how you might query a given user’s reviews for text containing the words best or worst. Note that you use the i regex flag 5 to indicate case-insensitivity:  db.reviews.find {     'user_id': ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,     'text':  bestworst i   }   Using the case-insensitive flag has penalties; it excludes the use of any indexes, which in MongoDB are always case-sensitive. If you want to use case-insensitive searches on large numbers of documents, you should use the new text search capability supplied in version 2.4 or later, or integrate an external text search engine. See chapter 9 for an explanation of MongoDB’s searching capabilities.    If the language you’re using has a native regex type, you can use a native regex  object to perform the query. You can express an identical query in Ruby like this:  @reviews.find {     :user_id => BSON::ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,     :text =>  bestworst i   }   Even though the regex is defined locally, it’s evaluated on the MongoDB server.   If you’re querying from an environment that doesn’t support a native regex type, you can use the special $regex and $options operators. Using these operators from the shell, you can express the query in yet another way:  db.reviews.find {     'user_id': ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,     'text': {       '$regex': "bestworst",        '$options': "i"}   }   5 The case-insensitive option will always prevent an index from being used to serve the query, even in the case  of a prefix match.  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB’s query language  115  MongoDB  is  a  case-sensitive  system,  and  when  using  a  regex,  unless  you  use  the   i modifier  that is,  bestworst i , the search will have to exactly match the case of the fields being searched. But one caveat is that if you do use  i, it will disable the use of indexes. If you want to do indexed case-insensitive search of the contents of string fields in documents, consider either storing a duplicate field with the contents forced to lowercase specifically for searching or using MongoDB’s text search capabili- ties, which can be combined with other queries and does provide an indexed case- insensitive search.  MISCELLANEOUS QUERY OPERATORS Two more query operators aren’t easily categorized and thus deserve their own sec- tion. The first is $mod, which allows you to query documents matching a given modulo operation, and the second is $type, which matches values by their BSON type. Both are detailed in table 5.5.  Table 5.5 Summary of miscellaneous operators  Operator  Description  $mod [ quotient , result ]  Matches if the element matches the result when divided by  the quotient  $type  $text  Matches if the element type matches a specified BSON type  Allows you to performs a text search on the content of the  fields indexed with a text index  For instance, $mod allows you to find all order subtotals that are evenly divisible by 3 using the following query:   db.orders.find {subtotal: {$mod: [3, 0]}}   You can see that the $mod operator takes an array having two values. The first is the divisor and the second is the expected remainder. This query technically reads, “Find all documents with subtotals that return a remainder of 0 when divided by 3.” This is a contrived example, but it demonstrates the idea. If you end up using the $mod opera- tor, keep in mind that it won’t use an index.    The second miscellaneous operator, $type, matches values by their BSON type. I don’t recommend storing multiple types for the same field within a collection, but if the situation ever arises, you have a query operator that lets you test against type.     Table  5.6  shows  the  type  numbers  associated  with  each  element  type  used  in MongoDB.  The  example  shown  is  how  a  member  of  that  type  would  appear  in  the JavaScript console. For example, other MongoDB drivers may have a different way of storing the equivalent of an ISODate object.  www.it-ebooks.info   116  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  Table 5.6 BSON types  BSON type  $type number  Example  Double  String  UTF-8   Object  Array  Binary  ObjectId  Boolean  Date  Null  Regex  JavaScript  Symbol  Scoped JavaScript  32-bit integer  Timestamp  64-bit integer  Maxkey  Minkey  Maxkey  1  2  3  4  5  7  8  9  10  11  13  14  15  16  17  18  127  255  128  123.456   “Now is the time”   { name:"Tim",age:"myob" }  [123,2345,"string"]  BinData 2,"DgAAAEltIHNvbWUgYmluYXJ5"   ObjectId "4e1bdda65025ea6601560b50"   ISODate "2011-02-24T21:26:00Z"   true  null   test i  function   {return false;}  Not used; deprecated in the standard  function   {return false;}  10  {  "t" : 1371429067,   "i" : 0 }  NumberLong 10   {"$maxKey": 1}  { "$minKey" : 1}  {"maxkey" : { "$maxKey" : 1 }}  There are a couple of elements in table 5.6 worth mentioning. maxkey and minkey are used to insert a “virtual” value that’s the same as the maximum or minimum value in the index. This means that it can be used to force the document to be sorted out as the first or last item when using a sort index. Gone are the days of adding a field with “aardvark” in it to the collection to force a document to sort to the front. Most of the language drivers have a means for adding a minkey or maxkey type.     Scoped  JavaScript  and  JavaScript  look  identical  in  the  table,  but  this  is  only because the console doesn’t display the scope, which is a dictionary of key-value pairs supplied  with  the  JavaScript  code  fragment.  Scope  means  the  context  under  which the function is executed. In other words, the function will be able to see the variables defined in the scope dictionary and use them during execution.  www.it-ebooks.info   5.2.2 Query options  MongoDB’s query language  117   Finally, the symbol type has no representation. That’s because in most languages it’s  not  used—it’s  only  used  where  the  language  has  a  distinct  type  for  “keys.”  For instance, in Ruby there’s a difference between "foo" and :foo—the latter is a symbol. The Ruby driver will store any key as a symbol.   BSON symbol types As far as querying is concerned, the MongoDB server will treat a BSON symbol type in the same way it treats a string; it’s only when the document is retrieved that a dis- tinct symbol type mapping to the language key type is done. Note also that the sym- bol  type  is  deprecated  in  the  latest  BSON  spec   http:  bsonspec.org   and  may disappear at any moment. Regardless of the language you write your data with, you’ll be able to retrieve it in any other language with a BSON implementation.  All  queries  require  a  query  selector.  Even  if  empty,  the  query  selector  essentially defines the query. But when issuing a query, you have a variety of query options to choose  from  that  allow  you  to  further  constrain  the  result  set.  Let’s  look  at  those options next. PROJECTIONS You can use a projection to select a subset of fields to return from each document in a query result set. Especially in cases where you have large documents, using a projec- tion will minimize the costs of network latency and deserialization. The only operator, $slice, is summarized here:    $slice         Select a subset of a document to be returned  Projections are most commonly defined as a set of fields to return:  db.users.find {}, {'username': 1}   This query returns user documents excluding all but two fields: the username and the _id field, which is a special case and always included by default.   In some situations you may want to specify fields to exclude instead. For instance, this  book’s  user  document  contains  shipping  addresses  and  payment  methods,  but you don’t usually need these. To exclude them, add those fields to the projection with a value of 0:  db.users.find {}, {'addresses': 0, 'payment_methods': 0}   In your projection you should either do inclusions or exclusions, though the _id field is a special case. You can exclude the _id field in the same way, by setting the value to 0 in the projection document.    In  addition  to  including  and  excluding  fields,  you  can  return  a  range  of  values stored in an array. For example, you might want to store product reviews within the  www.it-ebooks.info   118  CHAPTER 5 Constructing queries  product  document  itself.  In  this  case,  you’d  still  want  to  be  able  to  paginate  those reviews, and for that you could use the $slice operator. To return the first 12 reviews, or the last 5, you’d use $slice like this:  db.products.find {}, {'reviews': {$slice: 12}}  db.products.find {}, {'reviews': {$slice: -5}}   $slice can also take a two-element array the values of which represent numbers to skip and limit, respectively. Here’s how to skip the first 24 reviews and limit the num- ber of reviews to 12:  db.products.find {}, {'reviews': {$slice: [24, 12]}}   Finally, note that using $slice won’t prevent other fields from being returned. If you want to limit the other fields in the document, you must do so explicitly. For example, here’s  how  you  can  modify  the  previous  query  to  return  only  the  reviews  and  the review rating :  db.products.find {}, {'reviews': {'$slice': [24, 12]}, 'reviews.rating': 1}   SORTING As we touched on early in this chapter, you can sort any query result by one or more fields in ascending or descending order. A simple sort of reviews by rating, descending from highest to lowest, looks like this:  db.reviews.find {} .sort {'rating': -1}   Naturally, it might be more useful to sort by helpfulness and then by rating:  db.reviews.find {} .sort {'helpful_votes':-1, 'rating': -1}   In compound sorts like this, the order does matter. As noted elsewhere, JSON entered via the shell is ordered. Because Ruby hashes aren’t ordered, you indicate sort order in Ruby with an array of arrays, which is ordered:  @reviews.find {} .sort [['helpful_votes', -1], ['rating', -1]]   The way you specify sorts in MongoDB is straightforward; understanding how indices can help improve sorting speeds is critical to using them well. We’ll get to that in chap- ter 8, but feel free to skip ahead if you’re using sorts heavily now. SKIP AND LIMIT There’s  nothing  mysterious  about  the  semantics  of  skip  and  limit.  These  query options should always work as you expect. But you should beware of passing large val- ues  say, values greater than 10,000  for skip because serving such queries requires scanning over a number of documents equal to the skip value. For example, imagine you’re paginating a million documents sorted by date, descending, with 10 results per page. This means that the query to display the 50,000th page will include a skip value  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary  119  of 500,000, which is incredibly inefficient. A better strategy is to omit the  skip alto- gether and instead add a range condition to the query that indicates where the next result set begins. Thus, this query   db.docs.find {} .skip 500000 .limit 10 .sort {date: -1}   becomes this:   previous_page_date = new Date 2013, 05, 05  db.docs.find {'date': {'$gt': previous_page_date}} .limit 10 .sort {'date': -1}   This second query will scan far fewer items than the first. The only potential problem is that if date isn’t unique for each document, the same document may be displayed more than once. There are many strategies for dealing with this, but the solutions are left as exercises for the reader.    There’s another set of query types that you can perform on MongoDB data: geo- spatial queries, which are used to index and retrieve geographical or geometric data and are typically used for mapping and location-aware applications.  Summary Queries make up a critical corner of the MongoDB interface. Once you’ve skimmed this chapter’s material, you’re encouraged to put the query mechanisms to the test. If you’re ever unsure of how a particular combination of query operators will serve you, the shell is always a ready test bed.    MongoDB  also  supports  query  modifiers  that  are  meta-operators  that  let  you modify the output or behavior of a query. You can find more about them at http:   docs.mongodb.org manual reference operator query-modifier .   You’ll use MongoDB queries consistently from now on, and the next two chapters are  a  good  reminder  of  that.  You’ll  tackle  aggregation,  document  updates,  and deletes. Because queries play a key role in most updates, you can look forward to yet more exploration of the query language.   5.3  www.it-ebooks.info   Aggregation  This chapter covers   Aggregation on the e-commerce data model   Aggregation framework details   Performance and limitations   Other aggregation capabilities  In the previous chapter, you saw how to use MongoDB’s JSON-like query language to perform common query operations, such as lookup by ID, lookup by name, and sorting. In this chapter, we’ll extend that topic to include more complex queries using the MongoDB aggregation framework. The aggregation framework is MongoDB’s advanced query language, and it allows you to transform and combine data from multiple documents to generate new information not available in any single docu- ment. For example, you might use the aggregation framework to determine sales by month, sales by product, or order totals by user. For those familiar with relational databases, you can think of the aggregation framework as MongoDB’s equivalent to the SQL GROUP BY clause. Although you could have calculated this information pre- viously  using  MongoDB’s  map  reduce  capabilities  or  within  program  code,  the aggregation  framework  makes  this  task  much  easier  as  well  as  more  efficient  by  120  www.it-ebooks.info   Aggregation framework overview  121  allowing  you  to  define  a  series  of  document  operations  and  then  send  them  as  an array to MongoDB in a single call.    In this chapter, we’ll show you a number of examples using the e-commerce data model that’s used in the rest of the book and then provide a detailed look at all the aggregation framework operators and various options for each operator. By the end of  this  chapter,  we’ll  have  examples  for  the  key  aspects  of  the  aggregation  frame- work, along with examples of how to use them on the e-commerce data model. We won’t cover even a fraction of the types of aggregations you might want to build for an e-commerce data model, but that’s the idea of the aggregation framework: it pro- vides you with the flexibility to examine your data in more ways than you could have ever foreseen.    Up to now, you’ve designed your data model and database queries to support fast and responsive website performance. The aggregation framework can also help with real-time information summarization that may be needed for an e-commerce website, but it can do much more: providing answers to a wide variety of questions you might want to answer from your data but that may require crunching large amounts of data.  Aggregation in MongoDB v2.6 and v3.0 The MongoDB aggregation framework, first introduced in MongoDB v2.2, has contin- ued  to  evolve  over  subsequent  releases.  This  chapter  covers  the  capabilities included  in  MongoDB  v2.6,  first  available  in  April  2014;  MongoDB  v3.0  uses  the same aggregation framework as the 2.6 version of MongoDB. Version 2.6 incorpo- rates  a  number  of  important  enhancements  and  new  operators  that  improve  the capabilities of the aggregation framework significantly. If you’re running an earlier ver- sion of MongoDB, you should upgrade to v2.6 or later in order to run the examples from this chapter.  6.1  Aggregation framework overview A  call  to  the  aggregation  framework  defines  a  pipeline   figure  6.1 ,  the  aggregation pipeline, where the output from each step in the pipeline provides input to the next step. Each step executes a single operation on the input documents to transform the input and generate output documents.   Aggregation pipeline operations include the following:   $project—Specify fields to be placed in the output document  projected .   $match—Select documents to be processed, similar to find  .  Input  documents  Operation 1  Operation 2  …  Operation n  Output  documents  Figure 6.1 Aggregation pipeline: the output of each operation is input to the next operation.  www.it-ebooks.info   122  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation    $limit—Limit the number of documents to be passed to the next step.   $skip—Skip a specified number of documents.   $unwind—Expand an array, generating one output document for each array  entry.    $group—Group documents by a specified key.   $sort—Sort documents.   $geoNear—Select documents near a geospatial location.   $out—Write the results of the pipeline to a collection  new in v2.6 .   $redact—Control access to certain data  new in v2.6 .  Most of these operators will look familiar if you’ve read the previous chapter on con- structing MongoDB queries. Because most of the aggregation framework operators work similarly to a function used for MongoDB queries, you should make sure you have a good understanding of section 5.2 on the MongoDB query language before continuing.   This code example defines an aggregation framework pipeline that consists of a  match, a group, and then a sort:    db.products.aggregate [ {$match: …}, {$group: …}, {$sort: …} ]    This series of operations is illustrated in figure 6.2.  Products  $match …  $group …  $sort …  1  2  3  1  2  3  Output  documents  Select documents to be processed.  Group documents by a specific key.  Sort documents.  Figure 6.2 Example aggregation framework pipeline  As the figure illustrates, the code defines a pipeline where    The entire products collection is passed to the $match operation, which then  selects only certain documents from the input collection.     The output from $match is passed to the $group operator, which then groups the  output by a specific key to provide new information such as sums and averages.     The output from the $group operator is then passed to a final $sort operator  to be sorted before being returned as the final result.   If you’re familiar with the SQL GROUP BY clause, you know that it’s used to provide sum- mary information similar to the summaries outlined here. Table 6.1 provides a detailed comparison of SQL commands to the aggregation framework operators.  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce aggregation example  123  Table 6.1 SQL versus aggregation framework comparison  SQL command  Aggregation framework operator  $group functions: $sum, $min, $avg, etc.  db.collectionName.aggregate ...   SELECT  $project  FROM  JOIN  WHERE  GROUP BY  HAVING  $unwind  $match  $group  $match  6.2  In the next section, we’ll take a close look at how the aggregation framework might be used  on  the  e-commerce  data  model.  First,  you’ll  see  how  to  use  the  aggregation framework to provide summary information for the product web page. You’ll then see how  the  aggregation  framework  can  be  used  outside  the  web  page  application  to crunch large amounts of data and provide interesting information, such as finding the highest-spending Upper Manhattan customers.  E-commerce aggregation example In this section you’ll produce a few example queries for your e-commerce database, illustrating how to answer a few of the many questions you may want to answer from your data using aggregation. Before we continue, let’s revisit the e-commerce data model.    Figure 6.3 shows a data model diagram of our e-commerce data model. Each large box represents one of the collections in our data model: products, reviews, categories, orders, and users. Within each collection we show the document structure, indicating any arrays as separate objects. For example, the products collection in the upper left of  the  figure  contains  product  information.  For  each  product  there  may  be  many price_history objects, many category_id objects, and many tags.    The  line  between  products  and  reviews  in the  center  of  the  figure  shows  that  a product may have many reviews and that a review is for one product. You can also see that a review may have many  voter_id objects related to it, showing who has voted that the review is helpful.    A  model  such  as  this  becomes  especially  helpful  as  the  data  model  grows  and  it becomes  difficult  to  remember  all  the  implied  relationships  between  collections,  or even the details of what the structure is for each collection. It can also be useful in help- ing you determine what types of questions you might want to answer from your data.  www.it-ebooks.info   124  Products  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  Reviews  0.. cid:2   products  reviews  1  1  1  0..   cid:2   0..   cid:2   0.. cid:2   1  0.. cid:2   price_history  category_ids  tags  voter_ids  0.. cid:2   Categories  Orders  1  categories   cid:2   orders   cid:2   1  1  0.. cid:2   1  1  0.. cid:2   ancestor  0..1 – parent   cid:2   0.. cid:2   Users  1  0.. cid:2   line_items  users  1  1  1  1  0..   cid:2   0..   cid:2   addresses  payment_methods  Figure 6.3 Data model summarizing e-commerce  collections and relationships  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce aggregation example  125  6.2.1  Products, categories, and reviews Now let’s look at a simple example of how the aggregation framework can be used to summarize information about a product. Chapter 5 showed an example of counting the number of reviews for a given product using this query:  product  = db.products.findOne {'slug': 'wheelbarrow-9092'}  reviews_count = db.reviews.count {'product_id': product['_id']}   Let’s see how to do this using the aggregation framework. First, we’ll look at a query that will calculate the total number of reviews for all products:   db.reviews.aggregate [       {$group : { _id:'$product_id',                 count:{$sum:1} }}   ] ;  Group the input  documents by product_id.  Count the number of  reviews for each product.  This single operator pipeline returns one document for each product in your data- base that has a review, as illustrated here:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003982" , "count" : 2 }  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" , "count" : 3 }  Outputs one  document for  each product  In this example, you’ll have many documents as input to the $group operator but only one  output  document  for  each  unique  _id  value—each  unique  product_id  in  this case. The $group operator will add the number 1 for each input document for a prod- uct,  in  effect  counting  the  number  of  input  documents  for  each  product_id.  The result is then placed in the count field of the output document.   An important point to note is that, in general, input document fields are specified by preceding them with a dollar sign  $ . In this example, when you defined the value of the _id field you used $product_id to specify that you wanted to use the value of the input document’s product_id field.   This example also uses the $sum function to count the number of input documents for each product by adding 1 to the count field for each input document for a given product_id. The $group operator supports a number of functions that can calculate various aggregated results, including average, minimum, and maximum as well as sum. These functions are covered in more detail in section 6.3.2 on the $group operator.   Next, add one more operator to your pipeline so that you select only the one prod-  uct you want to get a count for:  product  = db.products.findOne {'slug': 'wheelbarrow-9092'}   ratingSummary = db.reviews.aggregate [  {$match : { product_id: product['_id']} },   {$group : { _id:'$product_id',              count:{$sum:1} }}  ] .next  ;              Return the first  document in the results.  Select only a  single product.  www.it-ebooks.info   126  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  This example returns the one product you’re interested in and assigns it to the vari- able ratingSummary. Note that the result from the aggregation pipeline is a cursor, a pointer to your results that allows you to process results of almost any size, one docu- ment at a time. To retrieve the single document in the result, you use the next   func- tion to return the first document from the cursor:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" , "count" : 3 }  Aggregation cursors: New in MongoDB v2.6 Prior to MongoDB v2.6, the result from the aggregation pipeline was a single docu- ment with a maximum size of 16 MB. Starting with MongoDB v2.6, you can process results of any size using the cursor. Returning a cursor is the default when you’re run- ning shell commands. But to avoid breaking existing programs, the default for pro- grams is still a single 16 MB limited document. To use cursors in a program, you override this default explicitly to specify that you want a cursor. See “Aggregation cur- sor option” in section 6.5 to learn more and to see other functions available on the cursor returned from the aggregation pipeline.  The  parameters  passed  to  the  $match  operator,  {'product_id':  product['_id']}, should look familiar. They’re the same as those used for the query taken from chap- ter 5 to calculate the count of reviews for a product:   db.reviews.count {'product_id': product['_id']}   These parameters were covered in detail in the previous chapter in section 5.1.1. Most query operators we covered there are also available in the $match operator.   It’s important to have $match before $group. You could’ve reversed the order, put- ting  $match  after  $group,  and  the  query  would’ve  returned  the  same  results.  But doing so would’ve made MongoDB calculate the count of reviews for all products and then throw away all but one result. By putting  $match first, you greatly reduce how many documents have to be processed by the $group operator.    Now that you have the total number of reviews for a product, let’s see how to calcu- late the average review for a product. This topic takes you beyond the capabilities of the query language covered in chapter 5. CALCULATING THE AVERAGE REVIEW To calculate the average review for a product, you use the same pipeline as in the pre- vious example and add one more field:  product  = db.products.findOne {'slug': 'wheelbarrow-9092'}   ratingSummary  = db.reviews.aggregate [     {$match : {'product_id': product['_id']}},     {$group : { _id:'$product_id',         average:{$avg:'$rating'},             count: {$sum:1}}} ] .next  ;   Calculate the  average rating  for a product.  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce aggregation example  127  The previous example returns a single document and assigns it to the variable rating- Summary with the content shown here:  {     "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,     "average" : 4.333333333333333,     "count" : 3 }   This example uses the $avg function to calculate the average rating for the product. Notice also that the field being averaged, rating, is specified using '$rating' in the $avg function. This is the same convention used for specifying the field for the $group _id value, where you used this:   _id:'$product_id'.  COUNTING REVIEWS BY RATING Next  let’s  extend  the  product  summary  further  and show  a  breakdown  of  review  counts  for  each  rating. This is probably something you’ve seen before when shopping  online  and  is  illustrated  in  figure  6.4.  You can see that five reviewers have rated the product a 5, two have rated it a 4, and one has rated it a 3.   Using the aggregation framework, you can calcu- late  this  summary  using  a  single  command.  In  this case, you first use $match to select only reviews for the product  being  displayed,  as  we  did  in  the  previous example. Next, you group the $match results by rating and  count  the  number  of  reviews  for  each  rating. Here’s the aggregation command needed to do this:  Figure 6.4 Reviews summary  countsByRating = db.reviews.aggregate [     {$match : {'product_id': product['_id']}},     {$group : { _id:'$rating',                                 count:{$sum:1}}}                   ] .toArray  ;                   Convert resulting  cursor to an array  Select  product  Group by value  of rating:  '$rating'   Count number  of reviews for  each rating  As shown in this snippet, you’ve once again produced a count using the  $sum func- tion; this time you counted the number of reviews for each rating. Also note that the result  of  this  aggregation  call  is  a  cursor  that  you’ve  converted  to  an  array  and assigned to the variable countsByRating.  www.it-ebooks.info   128  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  SQL query  For those familiar with SQL, the equivalent SQL query would look something like this:   SELECT RATING, COUNT *  AS COUNT   FROM REVIEWS  WHERE PRODUCT_ID = '4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981'  GROUP BY RATING  This aggregation call would produce an array similar to this:  [ { "_id" : 5, "count" : 5 },    { "_id" : 4, "count" : 2 },   { "_id" : 3, "count" : 1 } ]  JOINING COLLECTIONS Next, suppose you want to examine the contents of your database and count the num- ber of products for each main category. Recall that a product has only one main cate- gory. The aggregation command looks like this:  db.products.aggregate [     {$group : { _id:'$main_cat_id',                 count:{$sum:1}}} ] ;  This command would produce a list of output documents. Here’s an example:  { "_id" : ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" , "count" : 2 }  This result alone may not be very helpful, because you’d be unlikely to know what cat- egory is represented by ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" . One of the limita- tions  of  MongoDB  is  that  it  doesn’t  allow  joins  between  collections.  You  usually overcome this by denormalizing your data model—making it contain, through group- ing  or  redundancy,  attributes  that  your  e-commerce  application  might  normally  be expected to display. For example, in your order collection, each line item also con- tains the product name, so you don’t have to make another call to read the product name for each line item when you display an order.   But keep in mind that the aggregation framework will often be used to produce ad hoc summary reports that you may not always be aware of ahead of time. You may also want to limit how much you denormalize your data so you don’t end up replicating too much data, which can increase the amount of space used by your database and complicate updates  because it may require updating the same information in multi- ple documents .     Although  MongoDB  doesn’t  allow  automatic  joins,  starting  with  MongoDB  2.6, there are a couple of options you can use to provide the equivalent of a SQL join. One  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce aggregation example  129  option is to use the forEach function to process the cursor returned from the aggre- gation command and add the name using a pseudo-join. Here’s an example:  db.mainCategorySummary.remove {} ;        Remove existing documents  from mainCategorySummary  collection  db.products.aggregate [     {$group : { _id:'$main_cat_id',                 count:{$sum:1}}} ] .forEach function doc {     var category = db.categories.findOne {_id:doc._id} ;      if  category !== null  {                                doc.category_name = category.name;     }     else {         doc.category_name = 'not found';     }     db.mainCategorySummary.insert doc ;    }   Insert combined  result into your  summary collection  You aren’t guaranteed the  category actually exists!  Read category  for a result  In this code, you first remove any existing documents from the existing mainCategory- Summary collection, just in case it already existed. To perform your pseudo-join, you process  every  result  document  and  execute  a  findOne    call  to  read  the  category name. After adding the category name to the aggregation output document, you then insert  the  result  into  a  collection  named  mainCategorySummary.  Don’t  worry  too much about the insert function; we’ll cover it in the next chapter.    A  find    on  the  collection  mainCategorySummary  then  will  provide  you  with  a result for each category. The following findOne   command shows the attributes of the first result:  > db.mainCategorySummary.findOne  ; {         "_id" : ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,         "count" : 2,         "category_name" : "Gardening Tools" }  Caution: Pseudo-joins can be slow As mentioned earlier, starting with MongoDB v2.6 the aggregation pipeline can return a  cursor.  But  be  careful  when  using  a  cursor  to  perform  this  type  of  pseudo-join. Although you can process almost any number of output documents, running the find- One   command for each document, as you did here to read the category name, can still be time consuming if done millions of times.  $OUT AND $PROJECT In a moment you’ll see a much faster option for doing joins using the $unwind opera- tor, but first you should understand two other operators: $out and $project. In the  www.it-ebooks.info   130  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  previous example, you saved the results of your aggregation pipeline into a collection named mainCategorySummary using program code to process each output document. You then saved the document using the following:  db.mainCategorySummary.insert doc ;  With the $out operator, you can automatically save the output from a pipeline into a collection.  The  $out  operator  will  create  the  collection  if  it  doesn’t  exist,  or  it’ll replace the collection completely if it does exist. In addition, if the creation of the new collection fails for some reason, MongoDB leaves the previous collection unchanged. For  example,  the  following  would  save  the  pipeline  results  to  a  collection  named mainCategorySummary:  db.products.aggregate [     {$group : { _id:'$main_cat_id',                 count:{$sum:1}}},      {$out : 'mainCategorySummary'}  ]   Save pipeline  results to collection  mainCategorySummary  The $project operator allows you to filter which fields will be passed to the next stage of the pipeline. Although $match allows you to limit how much data is passed to the next stage by limiting the number of documents passed, $project can be used to limit the size of each document passed to the next stage. Limiting the size of each docu- ment can improve performance if you are processing large documents and only need part of each document. The following is an example of a $project operator that lim- its the output documents to just the list of category IDs used for each product:  > db.products.aggregate [ ... {$project : {category_ids:1}} ... ] ; { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,    "category_ids" : [ ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,                       ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000049"  ] } { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003982" ,    "category_ids" : [ ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,                       ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000049"  ] }  Now  let’s  see  how  to  use  these  operators  with  the  $unwind  operator  to  perform faster joins. FASTER JOINS WITH $UNWIND Next we’ll look at another powerful feature of the aggregation framework, the $unwind operation. This operator allows you to expand an array, generating one output docu- ment for every input document array entry. In effect, it provides another type of Mon- goDB join, where you can join a document with each occurrence of a subdocument.   Earlier you counted the number of products for each main category, where a prod- uct  had  only  one  main  category.  But  suppose  you  want  to  calculate  the  number  of products for each category regardless of whether it was the main category. Recall in  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce aggregation example  131  the data model shown at the beginning of the chapter  figure 6.4  that each product can have an array of category_ids. The $unwind operator will then allow you to join each product with each entry in the array, producing one document for each product and category_id. You can then summarize that result by the category_id. The aggre- gation command for this is shown in the next listing.  Listing 6.1 $unwind, which joins each product with its category id array  db.products.aggregate [     {$project : {category_ids:1}},          {$unwind : '$category_ids'},               {$group : { _id:'$category_ids',                 count:{$sum:1}}},     {$out : 'countsByCategory'}      ] ;  Pass only the array of category  IDs to the next step. The _id  attribute is passed by default.  Create an output document for  every array entry in category_ids.  $out writes aggregation  results to the named  collection countsByCategory.  The first operator in your aggregation pipeline, $project, limits attributes that will be passed to the next step in the pipeline and is often important for pipelines with the $unwind operator. Because $unwind will produce one output document for each entry in the array, you want to limit how much data is being output. If the rest of the document is large and the array includes a large number of entries, you’ll end up with a huge result being passed on to the next step in the pipeline. Before MongoDB v2.6, this could cause your command to fail, but even with MongoDB v2.6 and later, large documents will slow down your pipeline. If a stage requires more than 100 MB of RAM, you’ll also have to use a disk to store the stage output, further slowing down the pipeline.   The last operator in the pipeline, $out, saves the results to the collection named  countsByCategory. Here’s an example of the output saved in countsByCategory:   > db.countsByCategory.findOne   { "_id" : ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000049" , "count" : 2 }  Once  you’ve  loaded  this  new  collection,  countsByCategory,  you  can  then  process each row in the collection to add the category name if needed. The next chapter will show you how to update a collection.   You’ve seen how you can use the aggregation framework to produce various sum- maries based on products and categories. The previous section also introduced two key operators for the aggregation pipeline: $group and $unwind. You’ve also seen the $out operator, which can be used to save the results of your aggregation. Now, let’s take a look at a few summaries that might be useful for analyzing information about users and orders. We’ll also introduce a few more aggregation capabilities and show you examples.  www.it-ebooks.info   132  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  6.2.2 User and order  When the first edition of this book was written, the aggregation framework, first intro- duced in MongoDB v2.2, hadn’t yet been released. The first edition used the MongoDB map-reduce  function  in  two  examples,  grouping  reviews  by  users  and  summarizing sales by month. The example grouping reviews by user showed how many reviews each reviewer had and how many helpful votes each reviewer had on average. Here’s what this  looks  like  in  the  aggregation  framework,  which  provides  a  much  simpler  and more intuitive approach:  db.reviews.aggregate [     {$group :          {_id : '$user_id',          count : {$sum : 1},           avg_helpful : {$avg : '$helpful_votes'}}     } ]   The result from this call looks like this:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000003" ,      "count" : 1, "avg_helpful" : 10 } { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000002" ,      "count" : 2, "avg_helpful" : 4 } { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,      "count" : 2, "avg_helpful" : 5 }  SUMMARIZING SALES BY YEAR AND MONTH The following is an example that summarizes orders by month and year for orders beginning in 2010. You can see what this looks like using MongoDB map-reduce in sec- tion 6.6.2, which requires 18 lines of code to generate the same summary. Here’s how it looks in the aggregation framework:  db.orders.aggregate [      {$match: {purchase_data: {$gte: new Date 2010, 0, 1 }}},       {$group: {             _id: {year : {$year :'$purchase_data'},                   month: {$month :'$purchase_data'}},              count: {$sum:1},              total: {$sum:'$sub_total'}}},      {$sort: {_id:-1}} ] ;  Running this command, you’d see something like the results shown here:  { "_id" : { "year" : 2014, "month" : 11 },      "count" : 1, "total" : 4897 } { "_id" : { "year" : 2014, "month" : 10 },      "count" : 2, "total" : 11093 } { "_id" : { "year" : 2014, "month" : 9 },      "count" : 1, "total" : 4897 }  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce aggregation example  133  In this example, you’re using the $match operator to select only orders on or after Jan- uary 1, 2010. Note that in JavaScript, January is month 0, and your match therefore looks for dates on or after Date 2010,0,1 . The matching function $gte should look familiar, as it was introduced in the previous chapter, in section 5.1.2.   For the $group operator, you’re using a compound key to group the orders by year and month. Although compound keys are less frequently used in a typical collection, they often become useful in the aggregation framework. In this case, the compound key is composed of two attributes:  year and  month. You’ve also used the  $year and $month  functions  to  extract  the  year  and  month  from  your  purchase  date.  You’re counting the number of orders, $sum:1, as well as summing the order totals,  $sum: $sub_total.   The final operation in the pipeline then sorts the result from most recent to oldest month.  The  values  passed  to  the  $sort  operation  should  also  look  familiar  to  you: they’re  the  same  ones  used  in  the  MongoDB  query  sort    function.  Note  that  the order of the fields in the compound key field, _id does matter. If you’d placed the month before the year within the group for _id, the sort would’ve sorted first by month, and then by year, which would’ve looked very strange, unless you were trying to determine trends by month across years.   Now that you’re familiar with the basics of the aggregation framework, let’s take a  look at an even more complex query.  FINDING BEST MANHATTAN CUSTOMERS In section 5.1.2, you found all customers in Upper Manhattan. Now let’s extend that query to find the highest spenders in Upper Manhattan. This pipeline is summarized in figure 6.5. Notice that the $match is the first step in the pipeline, greatly reducing the number of documents your pipeline has to process.  Order  $match  orders shipped  to Upper Manhattan  $group  sum  orders by customer  $match customer  total greater than $100  $sort  by desending customer order  total  Targeted customer  Figure 6.5 Selecting targeted customers  The query includes these steps:    $match—Find orders shipped to Upper Manhattan.    $group—Sum the order amounts for each customer.   $match—Select those customers with order totals greater than $100.   $sort—Sort the result by descending customer order total.  www.it-ebooks.info   134  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  Let’s develop this pipeline using an approach that may make it easy to develop and test our pipelines in general. First we’ll define the parameters for each of the steps:  upperManhattanOrders = {'shipping_address.zip': {$gte: 10019, $lt: 10040}};  sumByUserId = {_id: '$user_id',                 total: {$sum:'$sub_total'}, };  orderTotalLarge = {total: {$gt:10000}};  sortTotalDesc = {total: -1};  These commands define the parameters you’ll be passing to each of the steps of the aggregation pipeline. This makes the overall pipeline easier to understand, because an array of nested JSON objects can be difficult to decipher. Given these definitions, the entire pipeline call would appear as shown here:  db.orders.aggregate [     {$match: upperManhattanOrders},     {$group: sumByUserId},     {$match: orderTotalLarge},     {$sort: sortTotalDesc} ] ;  db.orders.aggregate [     {$group: sumByUserId},     {$match: orderTotalLarge},     {$limit: 10} ] ;  You can now easily test the individual steps in this process by including one or more of the steps to verify that they run as expected. For example, let’s run just the part of the pipeline that summed all customers:  This code would show you a list of 10 users using the following format:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000002" , "total" : 19588 }  Let’s say you decide to keep the count of the number of orders. To do so, modify the sumByuserId value:  sumByUserId = {_id: '$user_id',                 total: {$sum:'$sub_total'},                count: {$sum: 1}};  Rerunning the previous aggregate command, you’ll see the following:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000002" ,      "total" : 19588, "count" : 4 }  www.it-ebooks.info   Aggregation pipeline operators  135  Building an aggregation pipeline this way allows you to easily develop, iterate, and test your pipeline and also makes it much easier to understand. Once you’re satisfied with the result, you can add the $out operator to save the results to a new collection and thus make the results easily accessible by various applications:  db.orders.aggregate [     {$match: upperManhattanOrders},     {$group: sumByUserId},     {$match: orderTotalLarge},     {$sort: sortTotalDesc},     {$out: 'targetedCustomers'} ] ;  You’ve now seen how the aggregation framework can take you far beyond the limits of your original database design and allow you to extend what you learned in the previ- ous chapter on queries to explore and aggregate your data. You’ve learned about the aggregation  pipeline  and  the  key  operators  in  that  pipeline,  including  $group  and $unwind. Next we’ll look in detail at each of the aggregation operators and explain how to use them. As we mentioned earlier, much of this will be familiar if you’ve read the previous chapter.  6.3  Aggregation pipeline operators The aggregation framework supports 10 operators:    $project—Specify document fields to be processed.   $group—Group documents by a specified key.   $match—Select documents to be processed, similar to find … .   $limit—Limit the number of documents passed to the next step.   $skip—Skip  a  specified  number  of  documents  and  don’t  pass  them  to  the    $unwind—Expand  an  array,  generating  one  output  document  for  each  array  next step.  entry.    $sort—Sort documents.   $geoNear—Select documents near a geospatial location.   $out—Write the results of the pipeline to a collection  new in v2.6 .   $redact—Control access to certain data  new in v2.6 .  The following sections describe using these operators in detail. Two of the operators, $geoNear and $redact, are used less often by most applications and won’t be covered in  this  chapter.  You  can  read  more  about  them  here: http:  docs.mongodb.org  manual reference operator aggregation .  www.it-ebooks.info   136  6.3.1  6.3.2  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  $project The $project operator contains all of the functionality available in the query projec- tion  option  covered  in  chapter  5  and  more.  The  following  is  a  query  based  on  the example in section 5.1.2 for reading the user’s first and last name:  db.users.findOne    {username: 'kbanker',    hashed_password: 'bd1cfa194c3a603e7186780824b04419'},   {first_name:1, last_name:1}                               Projection object  that returns first  name and last name  You can code the previous query as shown here using the same find criteria and pro- jection objects as in the previous example:  db.users.aggregate [     {$match: {username: 'kbanker',               hashed_password: 'bd1cfa194c3a603e7186780824b04419'}},     {$project: {first_name:1, last_name:1}}    ]   Project pipeline operator  that returns first name  and last name  In addition to using the same features as those previously covered for the query pro- jection option, you can use a large number of document reshaping functions. Because there are so many of these, and they can also be used for defining the _id of a $group operator, they’re covered in a section 6.4, which focuses on reshaping documents.  $group The $group operator is the main operator used by most aggregation pipelines. This is the operator that handles the aggregation of data from multiple documents, provid- ing  you  with  summary  statistics  using  functions  such  as  min,  max,  and  average.  For those familiar with SQL, the $group function is equivalent to the SQL GROUP BY clause. The complete list of $group aggregation functions is shown in table 6.2.    You tell the $group operator how to group documents by defining the _id field. The $group operator then groups the input documents by the specified _id field, pro- viding aggregated information for each group of documents. The following example was shown in 6.2.2, where you summarized sales by month and year:  > db.orders.aggregate [ ...   {$match: {purchase_data: {$gte: new Date 2010, 0, 1 }}}, ...   {$group: { ...     _id: {year : {$year  :'$purchase_data'}, ...           month: {$month :'$purchase_data'}}, ...     count: {$sum:1}, ...     total: {$sum:'$sub_total'}}}, ...   {$sort: {_id:-1}} ... ] ; { "_id" : { "year" : 2014, "month" : 11 },    "count" : 1, "total" : 4897 }  www.it-ebooks.info   Aggregation pipeline operators  137  { "_id" : { "year" : 2014, "month" : 8 },    "count" : 2, "total" : 11093 } { "_id" : { "year" : 2014, "month" : 4 },    "count" : 1, "total" : 4897 }  When defining the _id field for the group, you can use one or more existing fields, or you  can  use  one  of  the  document  reshaping  functions  covered  in  section  6.4.  This example illustrates the use of two reshaping functions: $year and $month. Only the _id field definition can use reshaping functions. The remaining fields in the $group output documents are limited to being defined using the $group functions shown in table 6.2.  Table 6.2 $group functions  $addToSet  Creates an array of unique values for the group.  $group functions  The first value in a group. Makes sense only if preceded by a $sort.  Last value in a group. Makes sense only if preceded by a $sort.  $first  $last  $max  $min  $avg  $push  $sum  Maximum value of a field for a group.  Minimum value of a field for a group.  Average value for a field.  Sum of all values in a group.  Returns an array of all values for the group. Doesn’t eliminate duplicate values.  Although most of the functions are self-explanatory, two are less obvious: $push and $addToSet. The following example creates a list of customers, each with an array of products ordered by that customer. The array of products is created using the $push function:  db.orders.aggregate [     {$project: {user_id:1, line_items:1}},     {$unwind: '$line_items'},     {$group: {_id: {user_id:'$user_id'},                purchasedItems: {$push: '$line_items'}}}  ] .toArray  ;  $push function  adds object to  purchasedItems array  The previous example would create something like the output shown here:   [     {         "_id" : {             "user_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000002"          },  www.it-ebooks.info   138  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation          "purchasedItems" : [             {                 "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,                 "sku" : "9092",                 "name" : "Extra Large Wheel Barrow",                 "quantity" : 1,                 "pricing" : {                     "retail" : 5897,                     "sale" : 4897                 }             },             {                 "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,                 "sku" : "9092",                 "name" : "Extra Large Wheel Barrow",                 "quantity" : 1,                 "pricing" : {                     "retail" : 5897,                     "sale" : 4897                 }             },        …  $addToSet vs. $push Looking  at  the  group  functions,  you  may  wonder  about  the  difference  between $addToSet and $push. The elements in a set are guaranteed to be unique. A given value doesn’t appear twice in the set, and this is enforced by $addToSet. An array like one created by the $push operator doesn’t require each element to be unique. Therefore,  the  same  element  may  appear  more  than  once  in  an  array  created by $push.  Let’s continue with some operators that should look more familiar.  6.3.3  $match, $sort, $skip, $limit These four pipeline operators are covered together because they work identically to the query functions covered in chapter 5. With these operators, you can select certain documents, sort the documents, skip a specified number of documents, and limit the size of the number of documents processed.    Comparing these operators to the query language covered in chapter 5, you’ll see that  the  parameters  are  almost  identical.  Here’s  an  example  based  on  the  paging query shown in section 5.1.1:  page_number = 1 product = db.products.findOne {'slug': 'wheelbarrow-9092'}   reviews = db.reviews.find {'product_id': product['_id']} .                      skip  page_number - 1  * 12 .                      limit 12 .                      sort {'helpful_votes': -1}   www.it-ebooks.info   Aggregation pipeline operators  139  The identical query in the aggregation framework would look like this:  reviews2 = db.reviews.aggregate [     {$match: {'product_id': product['_id']}},     {$skip :  page_number - 1  * 12},     {$limit: 12},     {$sort:  {'helpful_votes': -1}} ] .toArray  ;  As you can see, functionality and input parameters for the two versions are identical. One exception to this is the find   $where function, which allows you to select docu- ments using a JavaScript expression. The $where can’t be used with the aggregation framework $match operator.  6.3.4  $unwind You  saw  the  $unwind  operator  in  section  6.2.1  when  we  discussed  faster  joins.  This operator expands an array by generating one output document for every entry in an array. The fields from the main document, as well as the fields from each array entry, are put into the output document. This example shows the categories for a product before and after a $unwind:  > db.products.findOne {},{category_ids:1}  {     "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,     "category_ids" : [         ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,         ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000049"      ] }  > db.products.aggregate [ ...     {$project : {category_ids:1}}, ...     {$unwind : '$category_ids'}, ...     {$limit : 2} ... ] ; { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,    "category_ids" : ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048"  } { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,    "category_ids" : ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000049"  }  Now let’s look at an operator new in MongoDB v2.6: $out.  6.3.5  $out In section 6.2.2 you created a pipeline to find the best Manhattan customers. We’ll use that example again here, but this time the final output of the pipeline is saved in the collection  targetedCustomers using the  $out operator. The  $out operator must be the last operator in your pipeline:  db.orders.aggregate [     {$match: upperManhattanOrders},     {$group: sumByUserId},  www.it-ebooks.info   140  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation      {$match: orderTotalLarge},     {$sort: sortTotalDesc},     {$out: 'targetedCustomers'} ] ;  The result of the pipeline creates a new collection or, if the collection already exists, completely replaces the contents of the collection,  targetedCustomers in this case, keeping any existing indexes. Be careful what name you use for the $out operation or you could inadvertently wipe out an existing collection. For example, what would hap- pen if by mistake you used the name users for the $out collection name?    The loaded results must comply with any constraints the collection has. For exam- ple, all collection documents must have a unique _id. If for some reason the pipeline fails,  either  before  or  during  the  $out  operation,  the  existing  collection  remains unchanged. Keep this in mind if you’re using this approach to produce the equivalent of a SQL materialized view.  Materialized views MongoDB style Most relational databases provide a capability known as a materialized view. Materi- alized views are a way of providing pregenerated results in an efficient and easy-to- use manner. By pregenerating this information, you save the time and overhead that would be required to produce the result. You also make it easier for other applica- tions to use this preprocessed information. The failsafe nature of the $out operation is critical if you use it to generate the equivalent of a materialized view. If the regen- eration  of  the  new  collection  fails  for  any  reason,  you  leave  the  previous  version intact, an important characteristic if you expect a number of other applications to be dependent on this information. It’s better that the collection be a bit out of date than missing entirely.  You’ve now seen all of the main aggregation pipeline operators. Let’s return to a pre- viously mentioned subject: reshaping documents.  6.4  Reshaping documents The MongoDB aggregation pipeline contains a number of functions you can use to reshape a document and thus produce an output document that contains fields not in the  original  input  document.  You’ll  typically  use  these  functions  with  the  $project operator, but you can also use them when defining the _id for the $group operator.    The simplest reshaping function is renaming a field to create a new field, but you can also reshape a document by altering or creating a new structure. For example, going  back  to  a  prior  example  where  you  read  a  user’s  first  and  last  name,  if  you wanted to create a subobject called name with two fields, first and last, you could use this code:  www.it-ebooks.info   Reshaping documents  141  db.users.aggregate [     {$match: {username: 'kbanker'}},     {$project: {name: {first:'$first_name',                         last:'$last_name'}}     } ]   The results from running this code look like this:   { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,       "name" : { "first" : "Kyle",                  "last" : "Banker" }     }  In addition to renaming or restructuring existing document fields, you can create new fields using a variety of reshaping functions. The reshaping function descriptions are divided into groups based on the type of function they perform: string, arithmetic, date, logical, sets, and a few others that have been grouped into a miscellaneous cate- gory. Next, we’ll take a closer look at each group of functions, starting with those that perform string manipulations.    Aggregation framework reshaping functions There are a number of functions—more in each release, it seems—that allow you to perform a variety of operations on the input document fields to produce new fields. In this section we’ll provide an overview of the various types of operators, along with an idea of what some of the more complex functions can accomplish. For the latest list of available functions, see the MongoDB documentation at http:  docs.mongodb .org manual reference operator aggregation group .  6.4.1  String functions The string functions shown in table 6.3 allow you to manipulate strings.  Table 6.3 String functions  Strings  $concat  Concatenates two or more strings into a single string  $strcasecmp Case-insensitive string comparison that returns a number  $substr  Creates a substring of a string  $toLower  Converts a string to all lowercase  $toUpper  Converts a string to all uppercase  www.it-ebooks.info   142  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  This example uses three functions, $concat, $substr, and $toUpper:  db.users.aggregate [     {$match: {username: 'kbanker'}},     {$project:          {name: {$concat:['$first_name', ' ', '$last_name']},            firstInitial: {$substr: ['$first_name',0,1]},                    usernameUpperCase: {$toUpper: '$username'}           }     } ]   Change the  username to  uppercase.  Concatenate first  and last name with  a space in between  Set firstInitial  to the first  character in  the first name.  The results from running this code look like this:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,    "name" : "Kyle Banker",    "firstInitial" : "K",    "usernameUpperCase" : "KBANKER"  }  Most of the string functions should look familiar.    Next we’ll take a look at the arithmetic-related functions.  6.4.2  Arithmetic functions  Arithmetic  functions  include  the  standard  list  of  arithmetic  operators  shown  in table 6.4.  Table 6.4 Arithmetic functions   $add  $divide  $mod  $multiply  $subtract  Arithmetic  Adds array numbers  Divides the first number by the second number  Divides remainder of the first number by the second number  Multiplies an array of numbers  Subtracts the second number from the first number  In general, arithmetic functions allow you to perform basic arithmetic on numbers, such as add, subtract, divide, and multiply.   Next let’s take a look at some of the date-related functions.  6.4.3 Date functions  The date functions shown in table 6.5 create a new field by extracting part of an exist- ing date time field, or by calculating another aspect of a date such as day of year, day of month, or day of week.  www.it-ebooks.info   Reshaping documents  143  Table 6.5 Date functions  Dates  $dayOfYear  The day of the year, 1 to 366  $dayOfMonth  The day of month, 1 to 31  $dayOfWeek  The day of week, 1 to 7, where 1 is Sunday  The year portion of a date  The month portion of a date, 1 to 12  The week of the year, 0 to 53  The hours portion of a date, 0 to 23  The minutes portion of a date, 0 to 59  The seconds portion of a date, 0 to 59  60 for leap seconds   $millisecond  The milliseconds portion of a date, 0 to 999  You already saw one example of using  $year and  $month in section 6.2.2 that dealt with summarizing sales by month and year.   The rest of the date functions are straightforward, so let’s move on to a detailed  look at the logical functions.  6.4.4  Logical functions  The logical functions, shown in table 6.6, should look familiar. Most are similar to the find query operators summarized in chapter 5, section 5.2.  Table 6.6 Logical functions  Logical  true if all of the values in an array are true.  Returns a number from the comparison of two values, 0 if they’re equal.  $ifNull  Converts a null value expression to a specified value.  if… then… else conditional logic.  Are two values equal?  Is value 1 greater than value 2?  Is value 1 greater than or equal value 2?  Is value 1 less than value 2?  Is value 1 less than or equal value 2?  www.it-ebooks.info  $year  $month  $week  $hour  $minute  $second  $and  $cmp  $cond  $eq  $gt  $gte  $lt  $lte   144  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  Table 6.6 Logical functions  continued   Logical  Is value 1 not equal to value 2?  $ne  $not  $or  Returns opposite condition of value: false if value is true, true if value  is false.  true if any of the values in an array are true.  The  $cond  function  is  different  from  most  of  the  functions  you’ve  seen  and  allows complex if, then, else conditional logic. It’s similar to the ternary operator  ?  found in many languages. For example x ? y : z, which, given a condition x, will evaluate to the value y if the condition x is true and otherwise evaluate to the value z.    Next  up  are  set  functions,  which  allow  you  to  compare  sets  of  values  with  each  other in various ways.  6.4.5  Set Operators Set  operators,  summarized  in  table  6.7,  allow  you  to  compare  the  contents  of  two arrays.  With  set  operators,  you  can  compare  two  arrays  to  see  if  they’re  exactly  the same, what elements they have in common, or what elements are in one but not the other. If you need to use any of these functions, the easiest way to see how they work is to visit the MongoDB documentation at http:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference  operator aggregation-set .   Table 6.7 Set functions  Sets  $setEquals  true if two sets have exactly the same elements  $setIntersection  Returns an array with the common elements in two sets  $setDifference  Returns elements of the first set that aren’t in the second set  $setUnion  Returns a set that’s the combination of two sets  $setIsSubset  true if the second set is a subset of the first set: all elements in the  second are also in the first  $anyElementTrue  true if any element of a set is true  $allElementsTrue  true if all elements of a set are true  Here’s one example using the $setUnion function. Given that you have the follow- ing products:  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,    "productName" : "Extra Large Wheel Barrow",   "tags" : [ "tools", "gardening", "soil" ]}  www.it-ebooks.info   Reshaping documents  145  { "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003982" ,   "productName" : "Rubberized Work Glove, Black",   "tags" : [ "gardening" ]}  If  you  union  the  tags  in  these  products,  you’ll  get  the  array  named  testSet1  as shown here:    testSet1 = ['tools']    db.products.aggregate [     {$project:          {productName: '$name',           tags:1,           setUnion: {$setUnion:['$tags',testSet1]},        }     } ]   The results will contain tags as shown here:  {   "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,     "productName" : "Extra Large Wheel Barrow",     "tags" : ["tools", "gardening", "soil"],     "setUnion" : ["gardening","tools","soil"]  }  {   "_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003982" ,     "productName" : "Rubberized Work Glove, Black",     "tags" : ["gardening"],     "setUnion" : ["tools", "gardening"]  }  Union of tools and  gardening, tools, soil  Union of tools  and gardening  We’re  almost  done  with  the  various  document  reshaping  functions,  but  there’s  still one more category to cover: the infamous “miscellaneous” category, where we group everything that didn’t fit a previous category.  6.4.6 Miscellaneous functions  The last group, miscellaneous functions, are summarized in table 6.8. These functions perform a variety of functions, so we’ll cover them one at a time. The $meta function relates to text searches and won’t be covered in this chapter. You can read more about text searches in chapter 9.  Table 6.8 Miscellaneous functions  Miscellaneous  $meta  $size  $map  $let  Accesses text search–related information. See chapter 9 on text search  Returns the size of an array  Applies an expression to each member of an array  Defines variables used within the scope of an expression  $literal  Returns the value of an expression without evaluating it  www.it-ebooks.info   146  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  The $size function returns the size of an array. This function can be useful if, for exam- ple, you want to see whether an array contains any elements or is empty. The $literal function allows you to avoid problems with initializing field values to 0, 1, or $.    The $let function allows you to use temporarily defined variables without having to use multiple  $project stages. This function can be useful if you have a complex series of functions or calculations you need to perform.     The  $map  function  lets  you  process  an  array  and  generate  a  new  array  by  per- forming one or more functions on each element in the array. $map can be useful if you want to reshape the contents of an array without using the $unwind to first flat- ten the array.   That wraps up our overview of reshaping documents. Next, we’ll cover some per-  formance considerations.   6.5  Understanding aggregation pipeline performance In this section you’ll see how to improve the performance of your pipeline, under- stand why a pipeline might be slow, and also learn how to overcome some of the limits on  intermediate  and  final  output  size,  constraints  that  have  been  removed  starting with MongoDB v2.6.     Here  are  some  key  considerations  that  can  have  a  major  impact  on  the  perfor-  mance of your aggregation pipeline:    Try to reduce the number and size of documents as early as possible in your  pipeline. Indexes  can  only  be  used  by  $match  and  $sort  operations  and  can  greatly speed up these operations.    You can’t use an index after your pipeline uses an operator other than $match  or $sort. If you use sharding  a common practice for extremely large collections , the $match and $project operators will be run on individual shards. Once you use any other operator, the remaining pipeline will be run on the primary shard.         Throughout this book you’ve been encouraged to use indexes as much as possible. In chapter 8 “Indexing and Query Optimization,” you’ll cover this topic in detail. But of these four key performance points, two of them mention indexes, so hopefully you now have the idea that indexes can greatly speed up selective searching and sorting of large collections.   There are still cases, especially when using the aggregation framework, where you’re going to have to crunch through huge amounts of data, and indexing may not be an option. An example of this was when you calculated sales by year and month in sec- tion 6.2.2. Processing large amounts of data is fine, as long as a user isn’t left waiting for a web page to display while you’re crunching the data. When you do have to show summarized data—on a web page, for example—you always have the option to pre- generate the data during off hours and save it to a collection using $out.  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding aggregation pipeline performance  147   That said, let’s move on to learning how to tell if your query is in fact using an  index via the aggregation framework’s version of the explain   function.  6.5.1  Aggregation pipeline options  Until now, we’ve only shown the aggregate   function when it’s passed an array of pipeline operations. Starting with MongoDB v2.6, there’s a second parameter you can pass to the aggregate   function that you can use to specify options for the aggrega- tion call. The options available include the following:    explain  —Runs the pipeline and returns only pipeline process details   allowDiskUse—Uses disk for intermediate results   cursor—Specifies initial batch size  The options are passed using this format  db.collection.aggregate pipeline,additionalOptions   where pipeline is the array of pipeline operations you’ve seen in previous examples and additionalOptions is an optional JSON object you can pass to the aggregate   function. The format of the additionalOptions parameter is as follows:      {explain:true, allowDiskUse:true, cursor: {batchSize: n} }  Let’s  take  a  closer  look  at  each  of  the  options  one  at  a  time,  starting  with  the explain   function.  6.5.2  The aggregation framework’s explain    function  The MongoDB explain   function, similar to the EXPLAIN function you might have seen in SQL, describes query paths and allows developers to diagnose slow operations by  determining  indexes  that  a  query  has  used.  You  were  first  introduced  to  the explain   function when we discussed the find   query function in chapter 2. We’ve duplicated  listing  2.2  in  the  next  listing,  which  demonstrates  how  an  index  can improve the performance of a find   query function.   Listing 6.2 explain   output for an indexed query  > db.numbers.find {num: {"$gt": 19995 }} .explain "executionStats"  {     "queryPlanner" : {         "plannerVersion" : 1,         "namespace" : "tutorial.numbers",         "indexFilterSet" : false,         "parsedQuery" : {             "num" : {                 "$gt" : 19995             }         },  www.it-ebooks.info   148  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  Using num_1 index          "winningPlan" : {             "stage" : "FETCH",             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "IXSCAN",                 "keyPattern" : {                     "num" : 1                 },                 "indexName" : "num_1",                   "isMultiKey" : false,                 "direction" : "forward",                 "indexBounds" : {                     "num" : [                         " 19995.0, inf.0]"                     ]                 }             }         },         "rejectedPlans" : [ ]     },     "executionStats" : {         "executionSuccess" : true,         "nReturned" : 4,                        "executionTimeMillis" : 0,                                    "totalKeysExamined" : 4, Four documents         "totalDocsExamined" : 4,       returned         "executionStages" : {             "stage" : "FETCH",             "nReturned" : 4,                        "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,                            "works" : 5,             "advanced" : 4,             "needTime" : 0,             "needFetch" : 0,             "saveState" : 0,             "restoreState" : 0,             "isEOF" : 1,             "invalidates" : 0,             "docsExamined" : 4,             "alreadyHasObj" : 0,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "IXSCAN",                 "nReturned" : 4,                 "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,                            "works" : 4,                 "advanced" : 4,                 "needTime" : 0,                 "needFetch" : 0,                 "saveState" : 0,                 "restoreState" : 0,                 "isEOF" : 1,                 "invalidates" : 0,                 "keyPattern" : {                     "num" : 1                 },                 "indexName" : "num_1",      Only four  documents  scanned  Using num_1 index  Much  faster!  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding aggregation pipeline performance  149                  "isMultiKey" : false,                 "direction" : "forward",                 "indexBounds" : {                     "num" : [                         " 19995.0, inf.0]"                     ]                 },                 "keysExamined" : 4,                 "dupsTested" : 0,                 "dupsDropped" : 0,                 "seenInvalidated" : 0,                 "matchTested" : 0             }         }     },     "serverInfo" : {         "host" : "rMacBook.local",         "port" : 27017,         "version" : "3.0.6",         "gitVersion" : "nogitversion"     },     "ok" : 1   }  The  explain    function  for  the  aggregation  framework  is  a  bit  different  from  the explain   used in the find   query function but it provides similar capabilities. As you might expect, for an aggregation pipeline you’ll receive explain output for each operation in the pipeline, because each step in the pipeline is almost a call unto itself  see the following listing .   Listing 6.3 Example explain   output for aggregation framework  $match  first  explain  option true  > countsByRating = db.reviews.aggregate [ ...  {$match : {'product_id': product['_id']}},   ...  {$group : { _id:'$rating', ...            count:{$sum:1}}} ... ],{explain:true}      {     "stages" : [         {             "$cursor" : {                 "query" : {                         "product_id" : ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981"                  },                 "fields" : {                         "rating" : 1,                         "_id" : 0                 },                 "plan" : {                     "cursor" : "BtreeCursor ",                       "isMultiKey" : false,                     "scanAndOrder" : false,                     "indexBounds" : {  Uses BTreeCursor, an  index-based cursor  www.it-ebooks.info   150  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  Range used is for single product                          "product_id" : [                                [                                 ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,                                 ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981"                              ]                         ]                     },                     "allPlans" : [                         ...                     ]                 }             }         },         {             "$group" : {                 "_id" : "$rating",                 "count" : {                         "$sum" : {                                 "$const" : 1                         }                 }             }         }     ],     "ok" : 1 }  Although  the  aggregation  framework  explain  output  shown  in  this  listing  isn’t  as extensive as the output that comes from find  .explain  shown in listing 6.2, it still provides some critical information. For example, it shows whether an index is used and the range scanned within the index. This will give you an idea of how well the index was able to limit the query.   Aggregation explain   a work in progress? The explain   function is new in MongoDB v2.6. Given the lack of details compared to the find  .explain   output, it could be improved in the near future. As explained in the online MongoDB documentation at http:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference  method db.collection.aggregate example-aggregate-method-explain-option,  “The intended readers of the explain output document are humans, and not machines, and the output format is subject to change between releases.” Because the documenta- tion states that the format may change between releases, don’t be surprised if the output you see begins to look closer to the find  .explain   output by the time you read this. But the find  .explain   function has been further improved in Mon- goDB v3.0 and includes even more detailed output than the find  .explain   func- tion in MongoDB v2.6, and it supports three modes of operation: "queryPlanner", "executionStats", and "allPlansExecution".  Now let’s look at another option that solves a problem that previously limited the size of the data you could process.  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding aggregation pipeline performance  151    As  you  already  know,  depending  on  the  exact  version  of  your  MongoDB  server,  your output of the explain   function may vary.  6.5.3  allowDiskUse option Eventually, if you begin working with large enough collections, you’ll see an error sim- ilar to this:   assert: command failed: {         "errmsg" : "exception: Exceeded memory limit for $group,          but didn't allow external sort. Pass allowDiskUse:true to opt in.",         "code" : 16945,         "ok" : 0 } : aggregate failed  Even more frustrating, this error will probably happen after a long wait, during which your  aggregation  pipeline  has  been  processing  millions  of  documents,  only  to  fail. What’s happening in this case is that the pipeline has intermediate results that exceed the 100 MB of RAM limit allowed by MongoDB for pipeline stages. The fix is simple and is even specified in the error message: Pass allowDiskUse:true to opt in.    Let’s see an example with your summary of sales by month, a pipeline that would  need this option because your site will have huge sales volumes:   db.orders.aggregate [     {$match: {purchase_data: {$gte: new Date 2010, 0, 1 }}},        {$group: {         _id: {year : {$year :'$purchase_data'},               month: {$month :'$purchase_data'}},         count: {$sum:1},          total: {$sum:'$sub_total'}}},     {$sort: {_id:-1}} ], {allowDiskUse:true} ;     Allow MongoDB  to use the disk for  intermediate storage.  Use a $match  first to reduce  documents to  process.  Generally speaking, using the allowDiskUse option may slow down your pipeline, so  we  recommend  that  you  use  it  only  when  needed.  As  mentioned  earlier,  you should also try to limit the size of your pipeline intermediate and final document counts and sizes by using $match to select which documents to process and $project to select which fields to process. But if you’re running large pipelines that may at some future date encounter the problem, sometimes it’s better to be safe and use it just in case.   Now for the last option available in the aggregation pipeline: cursor.  6.5.4  Aggregation cursor option  Before MongoDB v2.6, the result of your pipeline was a single document with a limit of 16 MB. Starting with v2.6, the default is to return a cursor if you’re accessing MongoDB via  the  Mongo  shell.  But  if  you’re  running  the  pipeline  from  a  program,  to  avoid  www.it-ebooks.info   152  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  “breaking” existing programs the default is unchanged and still returns a single docu- ment limited to 16 MB. In programs, you can access the new cursor capability by cod- ing something like that shown here to return the result as a cursor:  countsByRating = db.reviews.aggregate [     {$match : {'product_id': product['_id']}},   {$group : { _id:'$rating',             count:{$sum:1}}}  ],{cursor:{}}                              Return a  cursor.  The cursor returned by the aggregation pipeline supports the following calls:    cursor.hasNext  —Determine whether there’s a next document in the results.   cursor.next  —Return the next document in the results.   cursor.toArray  —Return the entire result as an array.   cursor.forEach  —Execute a function for each row in the results.   cursor.map  —Execute a function for each row in the results and return an  array of function return values.    cursor.itcount  —Return a count of items  for testing only .   cursor.pretty  —Display an array of formatted results.  Keep in mind that the purpose of the cursor is to allow you to stream large volumes of data. It can allow you to process a large result set while accessing only a few of the out- put documents at one time, thus reducing the memory needed to contain the results being processed at any one time. In addition, if all you need are a few of the docu- ments, a cursor can allow you to limit how many documents will be returned from the server. With the methods toArray   and pretty  , you lose those benefits and all the results are read into memory immediately.    Similarly, itcount   will read all the documents and have them sent to the cli- ent, but it’ll then throw away the results and return just a count. If all your applica- tion  requires  is  a  count,  you  can  use  the  $group  pipeline  operator  to  count  the output documents without having to send each one to your program—a much more efficient process.    Now  let’s  wrap  up  by  looking  at  alternatives  to  the  pipeline  for  performing  aggregations.  6.6  Other aggregation capabilities Although the aggregation pipeline is now considered the preferred method for aggre- gating data in MongoDB, a few alternatives are available. Some are much simpler, such as the .count   function. Another, more complex alternative is the older MongoDB map-reduce function.   Let’s start with the simpler alternatives first.  www.it-ebooks.info   Other aggregation capabilities  153  6.6.1  .count    and .distinct    You’ve already seen the .count   function earlier in section 6.2.1. Here’s an excerpt from code in that section:  product = db.products.findOne {'slug': 'wheelbarrow-9092'}  reviews_count = db.reviews.count {'product_id': product['_id']}      Count reviews  for a product  Now  let’s  see  an  example  of  using  the  distinct    function.  The  following  would return an array of the zip codes that we’ve shipped orders to:  db.orders.distinct 'shipping_address.zip'   The  size  of  the  results  of  the  distinct    function  is  limited  to  16  MB,  the  current maximum size for a MongoDB document.   Next, let’s take a look at one of the early attempts at providing aggregation: map-  reduce.  6.6.2 map-reduce  map-reduce was MongoDB’s first attempt at providing a flexible aggregation capabil- ity. With map-reduce, you have the ability to use JavaScript in defining your entire process. This provides a great deal of flexibility but generally performs much slower than the aggregation framework.1 In addition, coding a map-reduce process is much more complex and less intuitive than the aggregation pipelines we’ve been build- ing.  Let’s  see  an  example  of  how  a  previous  aggregation  framework  query  would appear in map-reduce.  NOTE For background on map-reduce as explained by two Google research- ers, see the original paper on the MapReduce programming model at  http:   static.googleusercontent.com media research.google.com en us archive  mapreduce-osdi04.pdf.  In section 6.2.2, we showed you an example aggregation pipeline that provided sales summary information:  db.orders.aggregate [     {"$match": {"purchase_data":{"$gte" : new Date 2010, 0, 1 }}},     {"$group": {         "_id": {"year" : {"$year" :"$purchase_data"},                "month" : {"$month" : "$purchase_data"}},         "count": {"$sum":1},         "total": {"$sum":"$sub_total"}}},     {"$sort": {"_id":-1}}] ;  1 Although JavaScript performance has been improving in MongoDB, there are still some key reasons why map- reduce is still significantly slower than the aggregation framework. For a good synopsis of these issue see the wonderful write-up by William Zola in StackOverflow at http:  stackoverflow.com questions 12678631 map- reduce-performance-in-mongodb-2-2-2-4-and-2-6 1268016512680165.   www.it-ebooks.info   154  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  Let’s create a similar result using map-reduce. The first step, as the name implies, is to write a map function. This function is applied to each document in the collection and, in the process, fulfills two purposes: it defines the keys that you’re grouping on, and it packages all the data you’ll need for your calculation. To see this process in action, look closely at the following function:  map = function   {     var shipping_month =  this.purchase_data.getMonth  +1  +         '-' + this.purchase_data.getFullYear  ;      var tmpItems = 0;     this.line_items.forEach function item  {         tmpItems += item.quantity;     } ;      emit shipping_month, {order_total: this.sub_total,                            items_total: tmpItems} ; };  First, know that the variable this always refers to a document being iterated over— orders, in this case. In the function’s first line, you get an integer value specifying the month the order was created. You then call emit  , a special method that every map function must invoke. The first argument to emit   is the key to group by, and the sec- ond is usually a document containing values to be reduced. In this case, you’re group- ing by month, and you’re going to reduce over each order’s subtotal and item count. The corresponding reduce function should make this clearer:  reduce = function key, values  {     var result = { order_total: 0, items_total: 0 };     values.forEach function value {         result.order_total += value.order_total;         result.items_total += value.items_total;     } ;     return   result  ; };  The reduce function will be passed a key and an array of one or more values. Your job in writing a reduce function is to make sure those values are aggregated together in the desired way and then returned as a single value. Because of map-reduce’s itera- tive nature, reduce may be invoked more than once, and your code must take this into account. In addition, if only one value is emitted by the map function for a partic- ular key, the reduce function won’t be called at all. As a result, the structure returned by the reduce function must be identical to the structure emitted by the map func- tion. Look closely at the example map and reduce functions and you’ll see that this is the case. ADDING A QUERY FILTER AND SAVING OUTPUT The shell’s map-reduce method requires a map and a reduce function as arguments. But this example adds two more. The first is a query filter that limits the documents  www.it-ebooks.info   Other aggregation capabilities  155  involved in the aggregation to orders made since the beginning of 2010. The second argument is the name of the output collection:  filter = {purchase_data: {$gte: new Date 2010, 0, 1 }}; db.orders.mapReduce map, reduce, {query: filter, out: 'totals'} ;  The process, as illustrated in figure 6.6, includes these steps:   1 filter will select only certain orders. 2 map then emits a key-value pair, usually one output for each input, but it can  emit none or many as well.  3 reduce is passed a key with an array of values emitted by map, usually one array for each key, but it may be passed the same key multiple times with different arrays of values.  Figure 6.6 map-reduce process  One important point illustrated in figure 6.6 is that if the map function produces a sin- gle result for a given key, the reduce step is skipped. This is critical to understanding why you can’t change the structure of the value output by the map output during the reduce step.   In the example, the results are stored in a collection called totals, and you can query this collection as you would any other. The following listing displays the results of querying one of these collections. The _id field holds your grouping key, the year, and the month, and the value field references the reduced totals.   Listing 6.4 Querying the map-reduce output collection  > db.totals.find   { "_id" : "11-2014", "value" : {"order_total" : 4897, "items_total" : 1 } } { "_id" : "4-2014", "value" : {"order_total" : 4897, "items_total" : 1 } } { "_id" : "8-2014", "value" : {"order_total" : 11093, "items_total" : 4 } }  The examples here should give you some sense of MongoDB’s aggregation capabilities in practice. Compare this to the aggregation framework version of the equivalent pro- cess and you’ll see why map-reduce is no longer the preferred method for this type of functionality.    But  there  may  be  some  cases  where  you  require  the  additional  flexibility  that JavaScript provides with  map-reduce. We won’t cover the topic further in this book,  www.it-ebooks.info   156  CHAPTER 6 Aggregation  but you can find references and examples for map-reduce on the MongoDB website at http:  docs.mongodb.org manual core map-reduce .  map-reduce—A good first try At the first MongoDB World conference held in New York City in 2014, a group of MongoDB engineers presented results from benchmarks comparing different server configurations for processing a collection in the multi-terabyte range. An engineer pre- sented a benchmark for the aggregation framework but none for map-reduce. When asked about this, the engineer replied that map-reduce was no longer the recom- mended option for aggregation and that it was “a good first try.”  Although map-reduce provides the flexibility of JavaScript it’s limited in being single threaded and interpreted. The Aggregation Framework, on the other hand, is executed as  native  C++  and  multithreaded.  Although  map-reduce  isn’t  going  away,  future enhancements will be limited to the Aggregation Framework.  6.7  Summary This chapter has covered quite a bit of material. The $group operator provides the key functionality for the aggregation framework: the ability to aggregate data from multi- ple documents into a single document. Along with $unwind and $project, the aggre- gation framework provides you with the ability to generate summary data that’s up to the minute or to process large amounts of data offline and even save the results as a new collection using the $out command.   Queries and aggregations make up a critical part of the MongoDB interface. So once you’ve read this chapter, put the query and aggregation mechanisms to the test. If you’re ever unsure of how a particular combination of query operators will serve you, the MongoDB shell is always a ready test bed. So try practicing some of the key features  of  the  aggregation  framework,  such  as  selecting  documents  via  the  $match operator,  or  restructuring  documents  using  $project,  and  of  course  grouping  and summarizing data using $group.    We’ll use MongoDB queries pretty consistently from now on, and the next chapter is a good reminder of that. We’ll tackle the usual document CRUD operations: create, read, update, and delete. Because queries play a key role in most updates, you can look forward to yet more exploration of the query language elaborated here. You’ll also learn how updating documents, especially in a database that’s designed for high volumes of updates, requires more capabilities than you may be familiar with if you’ve done similar work on a relational database.  www.it-ebooks.info   Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  This chapter covers   Updating documents   Processing documents atomically   Applying complex updates to a real-world   example    Using update operators   Deleting documents  To update is to write to existing documents. Doing this effectively requires a thor- ough  understanding  of  the  kinds  of  document  structures  available  and  of  the query expressions made possible by MongoDB. Having studied the e-commerce data model in the last two chapters, you should have a good sense of the ways in which schemas are designed and queried. We’ll use all of this knowledge in our study of updates.   Specifically, we’ll look more closely at why we model the category hierarchy in such a denormalized way, and how MongoDB’s updates make that structure reason- able.  We’ll  explore  inventory  management  and  solve  a  few  tricky  concurrency issues in the process. You’ll get to know a host of new update operators, learn some tricks that take advantage of the atomicity of update operations, and experience  157  www.it-ebooks.info   158  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  the power of the findAndModify command. In this case atomicity refers to MongoDB’s ability  to  search  for  a  document  and  update  it,  with  the  guarantee  that  no  other operation will interfere, a powerful property. After numerous examples, there will be a section devoted to the nuts and bolts of each update operator, which will expand on the examples to give you the full range of options for how you update. We’ll also discuss  how  to  delete  data  in  MongoDB,  and  conclude  with  some  notes  on  concur- rency and optimization.   Most of the examples in this chapter are written for the JavaScript shell. The sec- tion where we discuss atomic document processing, though, requires a good bit more application-level logic, so for that section we’ll switch over to Ruby.   By the end of the chapter, you’ll have been exposed to the full range of MongoDB’s CRUD operations, and you’ll be well on your way to designing applications that best take advantage of MongoDB’s interface and data model.  7.1  A brief tour of document updates If you need to update a document in MongoDB, you have two ways of going about it. You can either replace the document altogether, or you can use update operators to modify specific fields within the document. As a way of setting the stage for the more detailed examples to come, we’ll begin this chapter with a simple demonstration of these two techniques. We’ll then provide reasons for preferring one over the other.   To start, recall the sample user document we developed in chapter 4. The docu- ment  includes  a  user’s  first  and  last  names,  email  address,  and  shipping  addresses. Here’s a simplified example:  {    _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,   username: "kbanker",   email: "kylebanker@gmail.com",   first_name: "Kyle",   last_name: "Banker",   hashed_password: "bd1cfa194c3a603e7186780824b04419",   addresses: [     {       name: "work",       street: "1 E. 23rd Street",       city: "New York",       state: "NY",       zip: 10010     }   ] }  You’ll undoubtedly need to update an email address from time to time, so let’s begin with that.   Please note that your ObjectId values might be a little different. Make sure that you’re using valid ones and, if needed, manually add documents that will help you  www.it-ebooks.info   A brief tour of document updates  159  follow the commands of this chapter. Alternatively, you can use the following method to find a valid document, get its ObjectId, and use it elsewhere:  doc = db.users.findOne {username: "kbanker"}  user_id = doc._id  7.1.1 Modify by replacement  To replace the document altogether, you first query for the document, modify it on the client side, and then issue the update with the modified document. Here’s how that looks in the JavaScript shell:  user_id = ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981"  doc = db.users.findOne {_id: user_id}  doc['email'] = 'mongodb-user@mongodb.com' print 'updating ' + user_id  db.users.update {_id: user_id}, doc   With the user’s _id at hand, you first query for the document. Next you modify the document locally, in this case changing the email attribute. Then you pass the modi- fied document to the update method. The final line says, “Find the document in the users collection with the given _id, and replace that document with the one we’ve provided.” The thing to remember is that the update operation replaces the entire document, which is why it must be fetched first. If multiple users update the same doc- ument, the last write will be the one that will be stored.  7.1.2 Modify by operator  That’s how you modify by replacement; now let’s look at modification by operator:  user_id = ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001"  db.users.update {_id: user_id},    {$set: {email: 'mongodb-user2@mongodb.com'}}   The example uses $set, one of several special update operators, to modify the email address  in  a  single  request  to  the  server.  In  this  case,  the  update  request  is  much more  targeted:  find  the  given  user  document  and  set  its  email  field  to  mongodb- user2@mongodb.com.  Syntax note: updates vs. queries Users new to MongoDB sometimes have difficulty distinguishing between the update and query syntaxes. Targeted updates always begin with the update operator, and this operator is almost always a verb-like construct  set, push, and so on . Take the $addToSet operator, for example:  db.products.update {}, {$addToSet: {tags: 'Green'}}   www.it-ebooks.info   160  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes   continued  If you add a query selector to this update, note that the query operator is semantically adjectival  less than, equal to, and so on  and comes after the field name to query on  price, in this case :  db.products.update {price: {$lte: 10}},     {$addToSet: {tags: 'cheap'}}   This last query example only updates documents with a price ? 10 where it adds 'cheap' to their tags.  Update operators use the prefix notation whereas query operators usually use the infix notation, meaning that $addToSet in the update operator comes first, and $lte in the query operator is within the hash in the price field.  7.1.3 Both methods compared  How about another example? This time you want to increment the number of reviews on a product. Here’s how you’d do that as a document replacement:  product_id = ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003982"  doc = db.products.findOne {_id: product_id}  doc['total_reviews'] += 1          add 1 to the value in total_reviews db.products.update {_id: product_id}, doc   And here’s the targeted approach:   db.products.update {_id: product_id}, {$inc: {total_reviews: 1}}   The  replacement  approach,  as  before,  fetches  the  user  document  from  the  server, modifies it, and then resends it. The update statement here is similar to the one you used  to  update  the  email  address.  By  contrast,  the  targeted  update  uses  a  different update operator, $inc, to increment the value in total_reviews.  7.1.4 Deciding: replacement vs. operators  Now that you’ve seen a couple of updates in action, can you think of some reasons why you might use one method over the other? Which one do you find more intuitive? Which do you think is better for performance? What happens when multiple threads are updating simultaneously—are they isolated from one another?   Modification by replacement is the more generic approach. Imagine that your appli- cation presents an HTML form for modifying user information. With document replace- ment, data from the form post, once validated, can be passed right to MongoDB; the code to perform the update is the same regardless of which user attributes are modi- fied. For instance, if you were going to build a MongoDB object mapper that needed  www.it-ebooks.info   A brief tour of document updates  161  to generalize updates, then updates by replacement would probably make for a sensi- ble default.1    But  targeted  modifications  generally  yield  better  performance.  For  one  thing, there’s no need for the initial round-trip to the server to fetch the document to mod- ify. And, just as important, the document specifying the update is generally small. If you’re updating via replacement and your documents average 200 KB in size, that’s 200 KB received and sent to the server per update! Recall chapter 5 when you used projections  to  fetch  only  part  of  a  document.  That  isn’t  an  option  if  you  need  to replace the document without losing information. Contrast that with the way updates are specified using $set and $push in the previous examples; the documents specify- ing these updates can be less than 100 bytes each, regardless of the size of the docu- ment being modified. For this reason, the use of targeted updates frequently means less time spent serializing and transmitting data.    In  addition,  targeted  operations  allow  you  to  update  documents  atomically.  For instance, if you need to increment a counter, updates via replacement are far from ideal. What if the document changes in between when you read and write it? The only way to make your updates atomic is to employ some sort of optimistic locking. With targeted updates, you can use $inc to modify a counter atomically. This means that even with a large number of concurrent updates, each $inc will be applied in isola- tion, all or nothing.2  Optimistic locking Optimistic  locking,  or  optimistic  concurrency  control,  is  a  technique  for  ensuring  a clean update to a record without having to lock it. The easiest way to understand this technique is to think of a wiki. It’s possible to have more than one user editing a wiki page at the same time. But you never want a situation where a user is editing and updating an out-of-date version of the page. Thus, an optimistic locking protocol is used. When users try to save their changes, a timestamp is included in the attempted update. If that timestamp is older than the latest saved version of the page, the user’s update can’t go through. But if no one has saved any edits to the page, the update is allowed. This strategy allows multiple users to edit at the same time, which is much better than the alternative concurrency strategy of requiring each user to take out a lock to edit any one page. With pessimistic locking, a record is locked from the time it’s first accessed in a transaction until the transaction is finished, making it inaccessible to other transac- tions during that time.  1 This is the strategy employed by most MongoDB object mappers, and it’s easy to understand why. If users are given the ability to model entities of arbitrary complexity, then issuing an update via replacement is much easier than calculating the ideal combination of special update operators to employ.  2 The MongoDB documentation uses the term atomic updates to signify what we’re calling targeted updates. This new terminology is an attempt to clarify the use of the word atomic. In fact, all updates issued to the core server occur atomically, isolated on a per-document basis. The update operators are called atomic because they make it possible to query and update a document in a single operation.   www.it-ebooks.info   162  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  Now that you understand the kinds of available updates, you’ll be able to appreciate the strategies we’ll introduce in the next section. There, we’ll return to the e-commerce data model to answer some of the more difficult questions about operating on that data in production.  7.2  E-commerce updates It’s easy to provide stock examples for updating this or that attribute in a MongoDB document. But with a production data model and a real application, complications will arise, and the update for any given attribute might not be a simple one-liner. In the following sections, we’ll use the e-commerce data model you saw in the last two chapters to provide a representative sample of the kinds of updates you’d expect to make  in  a  production  e-commerce  site.  You  may  find  certain  updates  intuitive  and others not so much. But overall, you’ll develop a better understanding of the schema developed in chapter 4 and an improved understanding of the features and limita- tions of MongoDB’s update language.  7.2.1  Products and categories  Here you’ll see a couple of examples of  targeted  updates  in  action,  first  looking  at how you calculate average product ratings and then at the more complicated task of maintaining the category hierarchy.  AVERAGE PRODUCT RATINGS Products are amenable to numerous update strategies. Assuming that administrators are  provided  with  an  interface  for  editing  product  information,  the  easiest  update involves  fetching  the  current  product  document,  merging  that  data  with  the  user’s edits,  and  issuing  a  document  replacement.  At  other  times,  you  may  only  need  to update a couple of values, where a targeted update is clearly the way to go. This is the case with average product ratings. Because users need to sort product listings based on average product rating, you store that rating in the product document itself and update the value whenever a review is added or removed.   Here’s one way of issuing this update in JavaScript:  product_id = ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981"  count = 0 total = 0 db.reviews.find {product_id: product_id}, {rating: 4} .forEach    function review  {     total += review.rating     count++   }  average = total   count db.products.update {_id: product_id},    {$set: {total_reviews: count, average_review: average}}    www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce updates  163  This code aggregates and produces the  rating field from each product review and then produces an average. You also use the fact that you’re iterating over each rating to  count  the  total  ratings  for  the  product.  This  saves  an  extra  database  call  to  the count function. With the total number of reviews and their average rating, the code issues a targeted update, using $set.   If you don’t want to hardcode an ObjectId, you can find a specific ObjectId as fol-  lows and use it afterwards:  product_id = db.products.findOne {sku: '9092'}, {'_id': 1}   Performance-conscious  users  may  balk  at  the  idea  of  re-aggregating  all  product reviews for each update. Much of this depends on the ratio of reads to writes; it’s likely that more users will see product reviews than write their own, so it makes sense to re-aggregate on a write. The method provided here, though conservative, will likely be acceptable  for  most  situations,  but  other  strategies  are  possible.  For  instance,  you could  store  an  extra  field  on  the  product  document  that  caches  the  review  ratings total, making it possible to compute the average incrementally. After inserting a new review, you’d first query for the product to get the current total number of reviews and the ratings total. Then you’d calculate the average and issue an update using a selector like the following:  db.products.update {_id: product_id},   {     $set: {       average_review: average,       ratings_total: total     },     $inc: {       total_reviews: 1     }   }   This  example  uses  the  $inc  operator,  which  increments  the  field  passed  in  by  the given value—1, in this case.    Only by benchmarking against a system with representative data can you say whether this  approach  is  worthwhile.  But  the  example  shows  that  MongoDB  frequently  pro- vides  more  than  one  valid  path.  The  requirements  of  the  application  will  help  you decide which is best. THE CATEGORY HIERARCHY With many databases, there’s no easy way to represent a category hierarchy. This is true  of  MongoDB,  although  the  document  structure  does  help  the  situation  some- what. Documents encourage a strategy that optimizes for reads because each category can contain a list of its denormalized ancestors. The one tricky requirement is keep- ing all the ancestor lists up to date. Let’s look at an example to see how this is done.  www.it-ebooks.info   164  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes   First you need a generic method for updating the ancestor list for any given cate-  gory. Here’s one possible solution:  var generate_ancestors = function _id, parent_id  {   ancestor_list = []   var cursor = db.categories.find {_id: parent_id}    while cursor.size   > 0  {     parent = cursor.next       ancestor_list.push parent      parent_id = parent.parent_id     cursor = db.categories.find {_id: parent_id}    }   db.categories.update {_id: _id}, {$set: {ancestors: ancestor_list}}  }  This method works by walking backward up the category hierarchy, making successive queries  to  each  node’s  parent_id  attribute  until  reaching  the  root  node   where parent_id is null . All the while, it builds an in-order list of ancestors, storing that result in the  ancestor_list array. Finally, it updates the category’s  ancestors attri- bute using $set.   Now that you have that basic building block, let’s look at the process of inserting a new category. Imagine you have a simple category hierarchy that looks like the one in figure 7.1.  Home  Outdoors  Tools  Seedlings  Planters  Lawn care  Figure 7.1 An initial  category hierarchy  Suppose  you  want  to  add  a  new  category  called  Gardening  and  place  it  under  the Home category. You insert the new category document and then run your method to generate its ancestors:  parent_id = ObjectId "8b87fb1476238d3b4dd50003"  category = {   parent_id: parent_id,   slug: "gardening",   name: "Gardening",   description: "All gardening implements, tools, seeds, and soil." } db.categories.save category  generate_ancestors category._id, parent_id   www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce updates  165  Home  Outdoors  Gardening  Tools  Seedlings  Planters  Lawn care  Figure 7.2 Adding a  Gardening category  Note that save   puts the ID created for it into the original document. The ID is then used in the call to generate_ancestors  . Figure 7.2 displays the updated tree.    That’s  easy  enough.  But  what  if  you  now  want  to  place  the  Outdoors  category underneath Gardening? This is potentially complicated because it alters the ancestor lists of a number of categories. You can start by changing the parent_id of Outdoors to  the  _id  of  Gardening.  This  turns  out  to  be  not  too  difficult  provided  that  you already have both an outdoors_id and a gardening_id available:  db.categories.update {_id: outdoors_id}, {$set: {parent_id: gardening_id}}   Because you’ve effectively moved the Outdoors category, all the descendants of Out- doors are going to have invalid ancestor lists. You can rectify this by querying for all categories  with  Outdoors  in  their  ancestor  lists  and  then  regenerating  those  lists. MongoDB’s power to query into arrays makes this trivial:  db.categories.find {'ancestors.id': outdoors_id} .forEach    function category  {     generate_ancestors category._id, outdoors_id    }   That’s how you handle an update to a category’s parent_id attribute, and you can see the resulting category arrangement in figure 7.3.   But what if you update a category name? If you change the name of Outdoors to The Great Outdoors, you also have to change Outdoors wherever it appears in the ancestor lists of other categories. You may be justified in thinking, “See? This is where denormalization comes to bite you,” but it should make you feel better to know that you can perform this update without recalculating any ancestor list. Here’s how:  doc = db.categories.findOne {_id: outdoors_id}  doc.name = "The Great Outdoors" db.categories.update {_id: outdoors_id}, doc  db.categories.update    {'ancestors._id': outdoors_id},   {$set: {'ancestors.$': doc}},   {multi: true}   www.it-ebooks.info   166  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  Home  Gardening  Outdoors  Tools  Seedlings  Planters  Lawn care  Figure 7.3 The category  tree in its final state  You first grab the Outdoors document, alter the name attribute locally, and then update via replacement. Now you use the updated Outdoors document to replace its occur- rences  in  the  various  ancestor  lists.  The  multi  parameter  {multi:  true}  is  easy  to understand; it enables multi-updates causing the update to affect all documents match- ing the selector—without {multi: true} an update will only affect the first matching document. Here, you want to update each category that has the Outdoors category in its ancestor list.   The positional operator is more subtle. Consider that you have no way of knowing where in a given category’s ancestor list the Outdoors category will appear. You need a way for the update operator to dynamically target the position of the Outdoors cate- gory in the array for any document. Enter the positional operator. This operator  here the $ in ancestors.$  substitutes the array index matched by the query selector with itself, and thus enables the update.   Here’s another example of this technique. Say you want to change a field of a user address   the  example  document  shown  in  section  7.1   that  has  been  labeled  as “work.” You can accomplish this with a query like the following:  db.users.update {       _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,       'addresses.name': 'work'},       {$set: {'addresses.$.street': '155 E 31st St.'}}   Because of the need to update individual subdocuments within arrays, you’ll always want to keep the positional operator at hand. In general, these techniques for updat- ing the category hierarchy will be applicable whenever you’re dealing with arrays of subdocuments.  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce updates  167  7.2.2 Reviews  Not all reviews are created equal, which is why this application allows users to vote on them.  These  votes  are  elementary;  they  indicate  that  the  given  review  is  helpful. You’ve modeled reviews so that they cache the total number of helpful votes and keep a list of each voter’s ID. The relevant section of each review document looks like this:  {   helpful_votes: 3,   voter_ids: [      ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000041" ,     ObjectId "7a4f0376238d3b4dd5000003" ,     ObjectId "92c21476238d3b4dd5000032"    ] }  You  can  record  user  votes  using  targeted  updates.  The  strategy  is  to  use  the  $push operator to add the voter’s ID to the list and the $inc operator to increment the total number of votes, both in the same JavaScript console update operation:  db.reviews.update {_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000041" }, {     $push: {       voter_ids: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001"      },     $inc: {       helpful_votes: 1     }   }   This is almost correct. But you need to ensure that the update happens only if the vot- ing user hasn’t yet voted on this review, so you modify the query selector to match only when the voter_ids array doesn’t contain the ID you’re about to add. You can easily accomplish this using the $ne query operator:  query_selector = {   _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000041" ,   voter_ids: {     $ne: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001"    } } db.reviews.update query_selector, {     $push: {       voter_ids: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001"      },     $inc : {       helpful_votes: 1     }   }   This is an especially powerful demonstration of MongoDB’s update mechanism and how  it  can  be  used  with  a  document-oriented  schema.  Voting,  in  this  case,  is  both  www.it-ebooks.info   168  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  atomic and efficient. The update is atomic because selection and modification occur in the same query. The atomicity ensures that, even in a high-concurrency environ- ment, it will be impossible for any one user to vote more than once. The efficiency lies in the fact that the test for voter membership and the updates to the counter and the voter list all occur in the same request to the server.   Now, if you do end up using this technique to record votes, it’s especially impor- tant  that  any  other  updates  to  the  review  document  also  be  targeted—updating  by replacement could result in an inconsistency. Imagine, for instance, that a user updates the content of their review and that this update occurs via replacement. When updat- ing by replacement, you first query for the document you want to update. But between the time that you query for the review and replace it, it’s possible that a different user might vote on the review. This is called a race condition. This sequence of events is illus- trated in figure 7.4.  Review documents  T1  Processes  {:text => "Awesome", :votes => 3}  {:text => "Awesome", :votes => 4}  {:text => "Incredible!", :votes => 3}  T2  T3  Process 1 at T1  queries for a review  Process 2 at T2  updates votes on review  Process 1 at T3 replaces review  Figure 7.4 When a review is updated concurrently via targeted and replacement updates, data can  be lost.  It should be clear that the document replacement at T3 will overwrite the votes update happening at T2. It’s possible to avoid this by using the optimistic locking technique described earlier, but doing so requires additional application code to implement and it’s probably easier to ensure that all updates in this case are targeted.  7.2.3 Orders  The atomicity and efficiency of updates that you saw in reviews can also be applied to orders. Specifically, you’re going to see the MongoDB calls needed to implement an add_to_cart function using a targeted update. This is a three-step process. First, you construct the product document that you’ll store in the order’s line-item array. Then you issue a targeted update, indicating that this is to be an upsert—an update that will insert a new document if the document to be updated doesn’t exist.  We’ll describe upserts in detail in the next section.  The upsert will create a new order object if it  www.it-ebooks.info   E-commerce updates  169  doesn’t  yet  exist,  seamlessly  handling  both  initial  and  subsequent  additions  to  the shopping cart.3   Let’s begin by constructing a sample document to add to the cart:  cart_item = {   _id:  ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,   slug: "wheel-barrow-9092",   sku:  "9092",   name: "Extra Large Wheel Barrow",   pricing: {     retail: 5897,     sale:   4897   } }  You’ll most likely build this document by querying the products collection and then extracting whichever fields need to be preserved as a line item. The product’s  _id, sku,  slug,  name,  and  price  fields  should  suffice.  Next  you’ll  ensure  that  there’s  an order for the customer with a status of 'CART' using the parameter {upsert: true}. This operation will also increment the order sub_total using the $inc operator:  selector = {   user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,   state: 'CART' } update = {   $inc: {     sub_total: cart_item['pricing']['sale']     } } db.orders.update selector, update, {upsert: true}   INITIAL UPSERT TO CREATE ORDER DOCUMENT To make the code clearer, you’re constructing the query selector and the update doc- ument  separately.  The  update  document  increments  the  order  subtotal  by  the  sale price of the cart item. Of course, the first time a user executes the add_to_cart func- tion, no shopping cart will exist. That’s why you use an upsert here. The upsert will construct the document implied by the query selector including the update. There- fore, the initial upsert will produce an order document like this:  {   user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,   state: 'CART',   subtotal: 9794 }  3 We’re using the terms shopping cart and order interchangeably because they’re both represented using the same document. They’re formally differentiated only by the document’s state field  a document with a state of CART is a shopping cart .  www.it-ebooks.info   170  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  You then perform an update of the order document to add the line item if it’s not already on the order:  selector = {user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,     state: 'CART',     'line_items._id':         {'$ne': cart_item._id}     }  update = {'$push': {'line_items': cart_item}} db.orders.update selector, update   ANOTHER UPDATE FOR QUANTITIES  Next you’ll issue another targeted update to ensure that the item quantities are cor- rect. You need this update to handle the case where the user clicks Add to Cart on an item that’s already in the cart. In this case the previous update won’t add a new item to the cart, but you’ll still need to adjust the quantity:   selector = {   user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,   state: 'CART',   'line_items._id': ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981"  } update = {   $inc: {     'line_items.$.quantity': 1     } } db.orders.update selector, update   We  use  the  $inc  operator  to  update  the  quantity  on  the  individual  line  item.  The update is facilitated by the positional operator,  $, introduced previously. Thus, after the user clicks Add to Cart twice on the wheelbarrow product, the cart should look like this:  {   user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,   state: 'CART',   line_items: [     {       _id:  ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,       quantity:  2,       slug: "wheel-barrow-9092",       sku:  "9092",       name: "Extra Large Wheel Barrow",       pricing: {         retail: 5897,         sale:   4897       }     }   ],   subtotal: 9794 }  www.it-ebooks.info   7.3  Atomic document processing  171  There are now two wheelbarrows in the cart, and the subtotal reflects that.   There are still more operations you’ll need in order to fully implement a shopping cart. Most of these, such as removing an item from the cart or clearing a cart alto- gether, can be implemented with one or more targeted updates. If that’s not obvious, the upcoming subsection describing each query operator should make it clear. As for  the actual order processing, that can be handled by advancing the order docu- ment through a series of states and applying each state’s processing logic. We’ll dem- onstrate this in the next section, where we explain atomic document processing and the findAndModify command.  Atomic document processing One  tool  you  won’t  want  to  do  without  is  MongoDB’s  findAndModify  command.4 This  command  allows  you  to  atomically  update  a  document  and  return  it  in  the same round-trip. An atomic update is one where no other operation can interrupt or interleave itself with the update. What if another user tries to change the docu- ment after you find it but before you modify it? The find might no longer apply. An atomic update prevents this case; all other operations must wait for the atomic update to finish.   Every update in MongoDB is atomic, but the difference with findAndModify is that it also atomically returns the document to you. Why is this useful? If you fetch and then update a document  or update then fetch it , there can be changes made to the document by another MongoDB user in between those operations. Thus it’s impossi- ble to know the true state of the document you updated, before or after the update, even though the update is atomic, unless you use findAndModify. The other option is to use the optimistic locking mentioned in section 7.1, but that would require addi- tional application logic to implement.   This atomic update capability is a big deal because of what it enables. For instance, you can use findAndModify to build job queues and state machines. You can then use these primitive constructs to implement basic transactional semantics, which greatly expand the range of applications you can build using MongoDB. With these transac- tion-like  features,  you  can  construct  an  entire  e-commerce  site  on  MongoDB—not just the product content, but the checkout mechanism and the inventory manage- ment as well.    To  demonstrate,  we’ll  look  at  two  examples  of  the  findAndModify  command  in action.  First,  we’ll  show  how  to  handle  basic  state  transitions  on  the  shopping  cart. Then we’ll look at a slightly more involved example of managing a limited inventory.  4 The  way  this  command  is  identified  can  vary  by  environment.  The  shell  helper  is  invoked  camel  case  as db.orders.findAndModify,  whereas  Ruby  uses  underscores:  find_and_modify.  To  confuse  the  issue even more, the core server knows the command as findandmodify. You’ll use this final form if you ever need to issue the command manually.  www.it-ebooks.info   172  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  Checkout  Totals  recalculated  Credit card authorization  CART  PRE-AUTHORIZE  AUTHORIZING  PRE-SHIPPING  Totals changed  Authorization failed  Figure 7.5 Order state transitions  7.3.1 Order state transitions  All state transitions have two parts: a query ensuring a valid initial state, and an update that effects the change of state. Let’s skip forward a few steps in the order process and assume that the user is about to click the Pay Now button to authorize the purchase. If you’re going to authorize the user’s credit card synchronously on the application side, you need to ensure these four things:  1 You authorize for the amount that the user sees on the checkout screen. 2 The cart’s contents never change while in the process of authorization. 3 Errors in the authorization process return the cart to its previous state. 4 If the credit card is successfully authorized, the payment information is posted  to the order, and that order’s state is transitioned to PRE-SHIPPING.  The state transitions that you’ll use are shown in figure 7.5. PREPARE THE ORDER FOR CHECKOUT The first step is to get the order into the new PRE-AUTHORIZE state. You use find- AndModify to find the user’s current order object and ensure that the object is in a CART state:   newDoc = db.orders.findAndModify {      query: {        user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,        state: 'CART'      },      update: {        $set: {          state: 'PRE-AUTHORIZE'        }      },      'new': true    }   If successful, findAndModify will return the modified order object to newDoc.5 Once the order is in the PRE-AUTHORIZE state, the user won’t be able to edit the cart’s  5 By default, the findAndModify command returns the document as it appears prior to the update. To return  the modified document, you must specify 'new': true as in this example.  www.it-ebooks.info   Atomic document processing  173  contents. This is because all updates to the cart always ensure a state of CART. find- AndModify is useful here because you want to know the state of the document exactly when you changed its state to PRE-AUTHORIZE. What would happen to the total cal- culations if another thread was also attempting to move the user through the check- out process?  VERIFY THE ORDER AND AUTHORIZE Now, in the preauthorization state, you take the returned order object and recalculate the various totals. Once you have those totals, you issue a new findAndModify  that only transitions the document’s state to AUTHORIZING if the new totals match the old totals. Here’s what that findAndModify looks like:   oldDoc = db.orders.findAndModify {      query: {        user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,        total: 99000,        state: "PRE-AUTHORIZE"      },      update: {        '$set': {          state: "AUTHORIZING"        }      }    }   If this second findAndModify fails, then you must return the order’s state to CART and report the updated totals to the user. But if it succeeds, you know that the total to be authorized is the same total that was presented to the user. This means you can move on to the actual authorization API call. Thus, the application now issues a credit card authorization request on the user’s credit card. If the credit card fails to authorize, you record the failure and, as before, return the order to its CART state.  FINISHING THE ORDER If the authorization is successful, you write the authorization information to the order and transition it to the next state. The following strategy does both in the same find- AndModify call. Here, the example uses a sample document representing the authori- zation receipt, which is attached to the original order:   auth_doc = {    ts: new Date  ,    cc: 3432003948293040,    id: 2923838291029384483949348,    gateway: "Authorize.net"  }  db.orders.findAndModify {      query: {        user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,        state: "AUTHORIZING"      },  www.it-ebooks.info   174  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes       update: {        $set: {          state: "PRE-SHIPPING",          authorization: auth_doc        }      }    }   7.3.2  Inventory management  It’s important to be aware of the MongoDB features that facilitate this transactional process. There’s the ability to modify any one document atomically. There’s the guar- antee of consistent reads along a single connection. And finally, there’s the document structure itself, which allows these operations to fit within the single-document atom- icity that MongoDB provides. In this case, that structure allows you to fit line items, products,  pricing,  and  user  ownership  into  the  same  document,  ensuring  that  you only ever need to operate on that one document to advance the sale.   This ought to strike you as impressive. But it may lead you to wonder, as it did us, whether any multi-object transaction-like behavior can be implemented with MongoDB. The answer is a cautious affirmative and can be demonstrated by looking into another e-commerce centerpiece: inventory management.  Not every e-commerce site needs strict inventory management. Most commodity items can be replenished in enough time to allow any order to go through regardless of the actual number of items on hand. In cases like these, managing inventory is easily han- dled by managing expectations; as soon as only a few items remain in stock, adjust the shipping estimates.   One-of-a-kind items present a different challenge. Imagine you’re selling concert tickets with assigned seats or handmade works of art. These products can’t be hedged; users  will  always  need  a  guarantee  that  they  can  purchase  the  products  they’ve selected. Here we’ll present a possible solution to this problem using MongoDB. This will further illustrate the creative possibilities in the findAndModify command and the judicious  use  of  the  document  model.  It  will  also  show  how  to  implement  transac- tional semantics across multiple documents. Although you’ll only see a few of the key MongoDB calls used by this process, the full source code for the InventoryFetcher class is included with this book.   The way you model inventory can be best understood by thinking about a real store.  If  you’re  in  a  gardening  store,  you  can  see  and  feel  the  physical  inventory; dozens of shovels, rakes, and clippers may line the aisles. If you take a shovel and place it in your cart, that’s one less shovel available for the other customers. As a cor- ollary,  no  two  customers  can  have  the  same  shovel  in  their  shopping  carts  at  the same time. You can use this simple principle to model inventory. For every physical piece of inventory in your warehouse,  you store a corresponding document in an  www.it-ebooks.info   Atomic document processing  175  inventory collection. If there are 10 shovels in the warehouse, there are 10 shovel doc- uments in the database. Each inventory item is linked to a product by sku, and each of these items can be in one of four states: AVAILABLE  0 , IN_CART  1 , PRE_ORDER  2 , or PURCHASED  3 .   Here’s a method that inserts three shovels, three rakes, and three sets of clippers as available  inventory.  The  examples  in  this  section  are  in  Ruby,  since  transactions require more logic, so it’s useful to see a more concrete example of how an applica- tion would implement them:  3.times do   $inventory.insert_one {:sku => 'shovel',   :state => AVAILABLE}    $inventory.insert_one {:sku => 'rake',     :state => AVAILABLE}    $inventory.insert_one {:sku => 'clippers', :state => AVAILABLE}  end  We’ll  handle  inventory  management  with  a  special  inventory  fetching  class.  We’ll first look at how this fetcher works and then we’ll peel back the covers to reveal its implementation.  INVENTORY FETCHER The inventory fetcher can add arbitrary sets of products to a shopping cart. Here you create a new order object and a new inventory fetcher. You then ask the fetcher to add three shovels and one set of clippers to a given order by passing an order ID and two documents  specifying  the  products  and  quantities  you  want  to  the  add_to_cart method. The fetcher hides the complexity of this operation, which is altering two col- lections at once:  $order_id = BSON::ObjectId '561297c5530a69dbc9000000'  $orders.insert_one {     :_id => $order_id,     :username => 'kbanker',      :item_ids => []   }   @fetcher = InventoryFetcher.new {     :orders => $orders,     :inventory => $inventory   }   @fetcher.add_to_cart @order_id,     [       {:sku => "shovel", :quantity => 3},       {:sku => "clippers", :quantity => 1}     ]   $orders.find {"_id" => $order_id} .each do order     puts "\nHere's the order:"     p order end  www.it-ebooks.info   176  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  The add_to_cart method will raise an exception if it fails to add every item to a cart. If it succeeds, the order should look like this:  {   "_id" => BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e3200000a' ,   "username" => "kbanker",   "item_ids" => [     BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e32000001' ,     BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e32000004' ,     BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e32000007' ,     BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e32000009'       ]    }  The _id of each physical inventory item will be stored in the order document. You can query for each of these items like this:  puts "\nHere's each item:" order['item_ids'].each do item_id   item = @inventory.find {"_id" => item_id} .each do myitem     p myitem   end end  Looking at each of these items individually, you can see that each has a state of 1, cor- responding to the  IN_CART state. You should also notice that each item records the time  of  the  last  state  change  with  a  timestamp. You can later use this timestamp to expire items that have been in a cart for too long. For instance, you might give users 15 minutes to check out from the time they add products to their cart:  {   "_id" => BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e32000001' ,   "sku"=>"shovel",    "state"=>1,    "ts"=>"Sun Nov 14 01:07:52 UTC 2010" } {   "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e32000004' ,   "sku"=>"shovel",   "state"=>1,   "ts"=>"Sun Nov 14 01:07:52 UTC 2010" } {   "_id"=>BSON::ObjectId '4cdf3668238d3b6e32000007' ,   "sku"=>"shovel",   "state"=>1,    "ts"=>"Sun Nov 14 01:07:52 UTC 2010" }  INVENTORY MANAGEMENT If this InventoryFetcher’s API makes any sense, you should have at least a few hunches about how you’d implement inventory management. Unsurprisingly, the findAndModify  www.it-ebooks.info   Atomic document processing  177  command  resides  at  its  core.  The  full  source  code  for  the  InventoryFetcher  is included with the source code of this book. We’re not going to look at every line of code, but we’ll highlight the three key methods that make it work.   First, when you pass a list of items to be added to your cart, the fetcher attempts to transition each item from the state of AVAILABLE to IN_CART. If at any point this opera- tion fails  if any one item can’t be added to the cart , the entire operation is rolled back. Have a look at the add_to_cart method that you invoked earlier:   def add_to_cart order_id, *items     item_selectors = []    items.each do item      item[:quantity].times do        item_selectors   item[:sku]}      end    end    transition_state order_id, item_selectors,         {:from => AVAILABLE, :to => IN_CART}   end  The *items syntax in the method arguments allows the user to pass in any number of objects, which are placed in an array called items. This method doesn’t do much. It takes the specification for items to add to the cart and expands the quantities so that one  item  selector  exists  for  each  physical  item  that  will  be  added  to  the  cart.  For instance, this document, which says that you want to add two shovels  {:sku => "shovel", :quantity => 2}  becomes this:  [{:sku => "shovel"}, {:sku => "shovel"}]  You need a separate query selector for each item you want to add to your cart. Thus, the method passes the array of item selectors to another method called transition _state. For example, the previous code specifies that the state should be transitioned from AVAILABLE to IN_CART:    def transition_state order_id, selectors, opts={}      items_transitioned = []     begin  use a begin end block so we can do error recovery        for selector in selectors do         query = selector.merge {:state => opts[:from]}          physical_item = @inventory.find_and_modify {             :query => query,             :update => {               '$set' => {                 :state => opts[:to],           target state                 :ts => Time.now.utc            get the current client time               }             }           }   www.it-ebooks.info   178  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes          if physical_item.nil?           raise InventoryFetchFailure         end          items_transitioned << physical_item['_id']    push item into array         @orders.update_one {:_id => order_id}, {             '$push' => {               :item_ids => physical_item['_id']             }           }        end  of for loop      rescue Mongo::OperationFailure, InventoryFetchFailure       rollback order_id, items_transitioned, opts[:from], opts[:to]        raise InventoryFetchFailure, "Failed to add {selector[:sku]}"     end      return items_transitioned.size   end  To transition state, each selector gets an extra condition, {:state => AVAILABLE}, and the selector is then passed to  findAndModify, which, if matched, sets a timestamp and  the  item’s  new  state.  The  method  then  saves  the  list  of  items  transitioned  and updates the order with the ID of the item just added. GRACEFUL FAILURE If the findAndModify command fails and returns nil, then you raise an Inventory- FetchFailure exception. If the command fails because of networking errors, you res- cue the inevitable Mongo::OperationFailure exception. In both cases, you rescue by rolling  back  all  the  items  transitioned  thus  far  and  then  raise  an  InventoryFetch- Failure, which includes the SKU of the item that couldn’t be added. You can then res- cue this exception on the application layer to fail gracefully for the user.   All that now remains is to examine the rollback code:   def rollback order_id, item_ids, old_state, new_state     @orders.update_one {"_id" => order_id},                   {"$pullAll" => {:item_ids => item_ids}}      item_ids.each do id      @inventory. find_one_and_update {          :query => {            "_id" => id,            :state => new_state          }        },        {          :update => {            "$set" => {              :state => old_state,               :ts => Time.now.utc            }          }        }     end  end  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes  179  You  use  the  $pullAll  operator  to  remove  all  of  the  IDs  just  added  to  the  order’s item_ids array. You then iterate over the list of item IDs and transition each one back to its old state. The $pullAll operator as well as many other array update operators are covered in further detail in section 7.4.2.   The transition_state method can be used as the basis for other methods that move  items  through  their  successive  states.  It  wouldn’t  be  difficult  to  integrate  this into  the  order  transition  system  that  you  built  in  the  previous  subsection,  but  that must be left as an exercise for the reader.   One scenario ignored in this implementation is the case when it’s impossible to roll back all the inventory items to their original state. This could occur if the Ruby driver was unable to communicate with MongoDB, or if the process running the roll- back halted before completing. This would leave inventory items in an IN_CART state, but the orders collection wouldn’t have the inventory. In such cases managing transac- tions  becomes  difficult.  These  could  eventually  be  fixed,  however,  by  the  shopping cart  timeout  mentioned  earlier  that  removes  items  that  have  been  in  the  shopping cart longer than some specified period.   You may justifiably ask whether this system is robust enough for production. This question can’t be answered easily without knowing more particulars, but what can be  stated  assuredly  is  that  MongoDB  provides  enough  features  to  permit  a  usable solution when you need transaction-like behavior. MongoDB was never intended to support transactions with multiple collections, but it allows the user to emulate such behavior  with  find_one_and_update  and  optimistic  concurrency  control.  If  you find yourself attempting to manage transactions often, it may be worth rethinking your  schema  or  even  using  a  different  database.  Not  every  application  fits  with MongoDB, but if you carefully plan your schema you can often obviate your need for such transactions.  7.4  Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes To understand updates in MongoDB, you need a holistic understanding of MongoDB’s document model and query language, and the examples in the preceding sections are great for helping with that. But here, as promised in this chapter’s introduction, we get down to brass tacks. This mostly involves brief summaries of each feature of the MongoDB  update  interface,  but  we  also  include  several  notes  on  performance.  For brevity’s sake, most of the upcoming examples will be in JavaScript.  7.4.1 Update types and options  As we’ve shown in our earlier examples, MongoDB supports both targeted updates and updates via replacement. The former are defined by the use of one or more update operators; the latter by a document that will be used to replace the document matched by the update’s query selector.   Note that an update will fail if the update document is ambiguous. This is a com- mon gotcha with MongoDB and an easy mistake to make given the syntax. Here, we’ve  www.it-ebooks.info   180  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  combined an update operator, $addToSet, with replacement-style semantics,  {name: "Pitchfork"}:  db.products.update_one {}, {name: "Pitchfork", $addToSet: {tags: 'cheap'}}   If your intention is to change the document’s name, you must use the $set operator:  db.products.update_one {},   {$set: {name: "Pitchfork"}, $addToSet: {tags: 'cheap'}}   MULTIDOCUMENT UPDATES An update will, by default, only update the first document matched by its query selec- tor.  To  update  all  matching  documents,  you  need  to  explicitly  specify  a  multidocu- ment update. In the shell, you can express this by adding the parameter multi: true. Here’s how you’d add the cheap tags to all documents in the products collection:  db.products.update {}, {$addToSet: {tags: 'cheap'}}, {multi: true}   Updates  are  atomic  at  a  document  level,  which  means  that  a  statement  that  has  to update 10 documents might fail for some reason after updating the first 3 of them. The application has to deal with such failures according to its policy.   With the Ruby driver  and most other drivers , you can express multidocument  updates in a similar manner:  @products.update_one {},      {'$addToSet' => {'tags' => 'cheap'}},     {:multi => true}   UPSERTS It’s common to need to insert an item if it doesn’t exist but update it if it does. You can handle this normally tricky-to-implement pattern using upserts. If the query selector matches,  the  update  takes  place  normally.  But  if  no  document  matches  the  query selector, a new document will be inserted. The new document’s attributes will be a log- ical merging of the query selector and the targeted update document.6    Here’s  a  simple  example  of  an  upsert  using  the  shell,  setting  the  upsert:  true  parameter to allow an upsert:  db.products.update {slug: 'hammer'},                     {$addToSet: {tags: 'cheap'}}, {upsert: true}   And here’s an equivalent upsert in Ruby:  @products.update_one {'slug' => 'hammer'},   {'$addToSet' => {'tags' => 'cheap'}}, {:upsert => true}   6 Note that upserts don’t work with replacement-style update documents.  www.it-ebooks.info   7.4.2 Update operators  Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes  181  As you’d expect, upserts can insert or update only one document at a time. You’ll find upserts incredibly valuable when you need to update atomically and when there’s uncer- tainly about a document’s prior existence. For a practical example, see section 7.2.3, which describes adding products to a cart.  MongoDB  supports  a  host  of  update  operators.  Here  we  provide  brief  examples  of each of them. STANDARD UPDATE OPERATORS This first set of operators is the most generic, and each works with almost any data type.  $INC You use the $inc operator to increment or decrement a numeric value:  db.products.update {slug: "shovel"}, {$inc: {review_count: 1}}  db.users.update {username: "moe"}, {$inc: {password_retries: -1}}   You can also use $inc to add or subtract from numbers arbitrarily:  db.readings.update {_id: 324}, {$inc: {temp: 2.7435}}   $inc is as efficient as it is convenient. Because it rarely changes the size of a document, an $inc usually occurs in-place on disk, thus affecting only the value pair specified.7 The previous statement is only true for the MMAPv1 storage engine. The WiredTiger storage engine works differently as it uses a write-ahead transaction log in combina- tion with checkpoints to ensure data persistence.   As demonstrated in the code for adding products to a shopping cart, $inc works with upserts. For example, you can change the preceding update to an upsert like this:  db.readings.update {_id: 324}, {$inc: {temp: 2.7435}}, {upsert: true}   If no reading with an _id of 324 exists, a new document will be created with that _id and a temp with the value of the $inc, 2.7435. $SET AND $UNSET If you need to set the value of a particular key in a document, you’ll want to use $set. You can set a key to a value having any valid BSON type. This means that all of the fol- lowing updates are possible:  db.readings.update {_id: 324}, {$set: {temp: 97.6}}  db.readings.update {_id: 325}, {$set: {temp: {f: 212, c: 100}}}  db.readings.update {_id: 326}, {$set: {temps: [97.6, 98.4, 99.1]}}   If the key being set already exists, then its value will be overwritten; otherwise, a new key will be created.  7 Exceptions to this rule arise when the numeric type changes. If the $inc results in a 32-bit integer being con-  verted to a 64-bit integer, then the entire BSON document will have to be rewritten in-place.  www.it-ebooks.info   182  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  $unset  removes  the  provided  key  from  a  document.  Here’s  how  to  remove  the  temp key from the reading document:  db.readings.update {_id: 324}, {$unset: {temp: 1}}   You can also use $unset on embedded documents and on arrays. In both cases, you specify the inner object using dot notation. If you have these two documents in your collection  {_id: 325, 'temp': {f: 212, c: 100}} {_id: 326, temps: [97.6, 98.4, 99.1]}  then you can remove the Fahrenheit reading in the first document and the “zeroth” element in the second document like this:  db.readings.update {_id: 325}, {$unset: {'temp.f': 1}}  db.readings.update {_id: 326}, {$pop: {temps: -1}}   This dot notation for accessing subdocuments and array elements can also be used with $set.  Using $unset with arrays Note that using $unset on individual array elements may not work exactly as you want it to. Instead of removing the element altogether, it merely sets that element’s value to null. To completely remove an array element, see the $pull and $pop operators:  db.readings.update {_id: 325}, {$unset: {'temp.f': 1}}  db.readings.update {_id: 326}, {$unset: {'temps.0': 1}}    $RENAME If you need to change the name of a key, use $rename:  db.readings.update {_id: 324}, {$rename: {'temp': 'temperature'}}   You can also rename a subdocument:  db.readings.update {_id: 325}, {$rename: {'temp.f': 'temp.fahrenheit'}}   $SETONINSERT During an upsert, you sometimes need to be careful not to overwrite data that you care about. In this case it would be useful to specify that you only want to modify a field  when  the  document  is  new,  and  you  perform  an  insert,  not  when  an  update occurs. This is where the $setOnInsert operator comes in:  db.products.update {slug: 'hammer'}, {     $inc: {       quantity: 1     },   www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes  183      $setOnInsert: {       state: 'AVAILABLE'     }   }, {upsert: true}   You want to increment the quantity for a certain inventory item without interfering with state, which has a default value of 'AVAILABLE'. If an insert is performed, then qty will be set to 1, and state will be set to its default value. If an update is performed, then  only  the  increment  to  qty  occurs.  The  $setOnInsert  operator  was  added  in MongoDB v2.4 to handle this case. ARRAY UPDATE OPERATORS The centrality of arrays in MongoDB’s document model should be apparent. Naturally, MongoDB provides a handful of update operators that apply exclusively to arrays. $PUSH, $PUSHALL, AND $EACH If you need to append values to an array, $push is your friend. By default, it will add a single element to the end of an array. For example, adding a new tag to the shovel product is easy enough:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'}, {$push: {tags: 'tools'}}   If you need to add a few tags in the same update, you can use $each in conjunction with $push:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'},   {$push: {tags: {$each: ['tools', 'dirt', 'garden']}}}   Note you can push values of any type onto an array, not just scalars. For an example, see the code in section 7.3.2 that pushed a product onto the shopping cart’s line items array.   Prior to MongoDB version 2.4, you pushed multiple values onto an array by using the $pushAll operator. This approach is still possible in 2.4 and later versions, but it’s considered deprecated and should be avoided if possible because  $pushAll may be removed completely in the future. A $pushAll operation can be run like this:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'},   {$pushAll: {'tags': ['tools', 'dirt', 'garden']}}   $SLICE The $slice operator was added in MongoDB v2.4 to make it easier to manage arrays of values with frequent updates. It’s useful when you want to push values onto an array but  don’t  want  the  array  to  grow  too  big.  It  must  be  used  in  conjunction  with  the $push and $each operators, and it allows you to truncate the resulting array to a cer- tain size, removing older versions first. The argument passed to $slice is an integer that must be less than or equal to zero. The value of this argument is -1 times the num- ber of items that should remain in the array after the update.  www.it-ebooks.info   184  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes   These semantics can be confusing, so let’s look at a concrete example. Suppose  you want to update a document that looks like this:  You update this document with this command:  {   _id: 326,    temps: [92, 93, 94] }  db.temps.update {_id: 326}, {     $push: {       temps: {         $each: [95, 96],         $slice: -4       }     }   }   {   _id: 326,    temps: [93, 94, 95, 96] }  Beautiful syntax. Here you pass -4 to the $slice operator. After the update, your doc- ument looks like this:  After pushing values onto the array, you remove values from the beginning until only four are left. If you’d passed -1 to the $slice operator, the resulting array would be [96]. If you’d passed 0, it would have been [], an empty array. Note also that starting with  MongoDB  2.6  you  can  pass  a  positive  number  as  well.  If  a  positive  number  is passed to $slice, it’ll remove values from the end of the array instead of the begin- ning.  In  the  previous  example,  if  you  used  $slice:  4  your  result  would’ve  been temps: [92, 93, 94, 95]. $SORT Like $slice, the $sort operator was added in MongoDB v2.4 to help with updating arrays. When you use $push and $slice, you sometimes want to order the documents before slicing them off from the start of the array. Consider this document:  {   _id: 300,   temps: [       { day: 6, temp: 90 },     { day: 5, temp: 95 }   ] }  You have an array of subdocuments. When you push a subdocument onto this array and slice it, you first want to make sure it’s ordered by day, so you retain the higher day values. You can accomplish this with the following update:  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes  185  db.temps.update {_id: 300}, {     $push: {       temps: {         $each: [           { day: 7, temp: 92 }         ],         $slice: -2,         $sort: {           day: 1         }       }     }   }   {   _id: 300,   temps: [       { day: 6, temp: 90 },     { day: 7, temp: 92 }   ] }  When this update runs, you first sort the temps array on day so that the lowest value is at the beginning. Then you slice the array down to two values. The result is the two subdocuments with the higher day values:  Used in this context, the $sort operator requires a $push, an $each, and a $slice. Though useful, this definitely handles a corner case, and you may not find yourself using the $sort update operator often.  $ADDTOSET AND $EACH $addToSet also appends a value to an array, but it does so in a more discerning way: the value is added only if it doesn’t already exist in the array. Thus, if your shovel has already been tagged as a tool, then the following update won’t modify the document at all:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'}, {$addToSet: {'tags': 'tools'}}   If you need to add more than one value to an array uniquely in the same operation, you must use $addToSet with the $each operator. Here’s how that looks:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'},   {$addToSet: {tags: {$each: ['tools', 'dirt', 'steel']}}}   Only those values in $each that don’t already exist in tags will be appended. Note that $each can only be used with the $addToSet and $push operators. $POP The most elementary way to remove an item from an array is with the $pop operator. If  $push appends an item to an array, a subsequent  $pop will remove that last item pushed. Though it’s frequently used with $push, you can use $pop on its own. If your  www.it-ebooks.info   186  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  tags array contains the values ['tools', 'dirt', 'garden', 'steel'], then the fol- lowing $pop will remove the steel tag:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'}, {$pop: {'tags': 1}}   Like  $unset,  $pop’s syntax is  {$pop:  {'elementToRemove':  1}}. But unlike  $unset, $pop  takes  a  second  possible  value  of  -1  to  remove  the  first  element  of  the  array. Here’s how to remove the tools tag from the array:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'}, {$pop: {'tags': -1}}   One possible point of frustration is that you can’t return the value that $pop removes from the array. Thus, despite its name, $pop doesn’t work exactly like the stack opera- tion you might have in mind. $BIT If you ever use bitwise operations in your application code, you may find yourself wish- ing that you could use the same operations in an update. Bitwise operations are used to perform logic on a value at the individual bit level. One common case  particularly in  C  programming   is  to  use  bitwise  operations  to  pass  flags  through  a  variable.  In other words, if the fourth bit in an integer is 1, then some condition applies. There’s often a clearer and more usable way to handle these operations, but this kind of stor- age does keep size to a minimum and matches how existing systems work. MongoDB includes the $bit operator to make bitwise OR and AND operations possible in updates.  Let’s look at an example of storing bit-sensitive values in MongoDB and manipulat- ing them in an update. Unix file permissions are often stored in this way. If you run ls –l in a Unix system, you’ll see flags like drwxr-xr-x. The first flag, d, indicates the file is a directory. r denotes read permissions, w denotes write permissions, and x denotes execute permissions. There are three blocks of these flags, denoting these permissions for the user, the user’s group, and everyone, respectively. Thus the example given says that the user has all permissions but others have only read and execute permissions.   A permission block is sometimes described with a single number, according to the spacing of these flags in the binary system. The x value is 1, the w value is 2, and the r value is 4. Thus you can use 7 to indicate a binary 111, or rwx. You can use 5 to indi- cate a binary 101, or r-x. And you can use 3 to indicate a binary 011, or –wx.    Let’s store a variable in MongoDB that uses these characteristics. Start with the  document:  {   _id: 16,   permissions: 4 }  The 4 in this case denotes binary 100, or r--. You can use a bitwise OR operation to add write permissions:  db.permissions.update {_id: 16}, {$bit: {permissions: {or: NumberInt 2 }}}   www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes  187  In the JavaScript shell you must use NumberInt   because it uses doubles for number by  default.  The  resulting  document  contains  a  binary  100  ORed  with  a  binary  010, resulting in 110, which is decimal 6:  {   _id: 16,   permissions: 6 }  You can also use and instead of or, for a bit-wise AND operation. This is another corner- case operator, which you might not use often but that can be useful in certain situations. $PULL AND $PULLALL $pull is $pop’s more sophisticated cousin. With $pull, you specify exactly which array element to remove by value, not by position. Returning to the tags example, if you need to remove the tag dirt, you don’t need to know where in the array it’s located; you simply tell the $pull operator to remove it:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'}, {$pull: {tags: 'dirt'}}   $pullAll works similarly to $pushAll, allowing you to provide a list of values to remove. To remove both the tags dirt and garden, you can use $pullAll like this:  db.products.update {slug: 'shovel'},    {$pullAll: {'tags': ['dirt', 'garden']}}   A powerful feature of $pull is the fact that you can pass in a query as an argument to choose which elements are pulled. Consider the document:  {_id: 326, temps: [97.6, 98.4, 100.5, 99.1, 101.2]}  Suppose you want to remove temperatures greater than 100. A query to do so might look like this:  db.readings.update {_id: 326}, {$pull: {temps: {$gt: 100}}}   This alters the document to the following:  {_id: 326, temps: [97.6, 98.4, 99.1]}  POSITIONAL UPDATES It’s common to model data in MongoDB using an array of subdocuments, but it wasn’t so easy to manipulate those subdocuments until the positional operator came along. The positional operator allows you to update a subdocument in an array identified by using dot notation in your query selector. For example, suppose you have an order document that looks like this:  {    _id: ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,   line_items: [  www.it-ebooks.info   188  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes      {        _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003981" ,       sku: "9092",       name: "Extra Large Wheelbarrow",       quantity: 1,       pricing: {         retail: 5897,         sale: 4897       }     },     {        _id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5003982" ,       sku: "10027",       name: "Rubberized Work Glove, Black",       quantity: 2,       pricing: {         retail: 1499,         sale: 1299       }     }   ] }  query  = {   _id: ObjectId "6a5b1476238d3b4dd5000048" ,   'line_items.sku': "10027" } update = {   $set: {     'line_items.$.quantity': 5   } } db.orders.update query, update   You want to be able to set the quantity of the second line item, with the SKU of 10027, to 5. The problem is that you don’t know where in the line_items array this particu- lar subdocument resides. You don’t even know whether it exists. You can use a simple query selector and the positional operator to solve both these problems:   The positional operator is the $ that you see in the line_items.$.quantity string. If  the  query  selector  matches,  then  the  index  of  the  document  having  a  SKU  of 10027 will replace the positional operator internally, thereby updating the correct document.    If your data model includes subdocuments, you’ll find the positional operator use-  ful for performing nuanced document updates.   7.4.3  The findAndModify command With so many fleshed-out examples of using the findAndModify command earlier in this chapter, it only remains to enumerate its options when using it in the JavaScript shell. Here’s an example of a simple findAndModify:  www.it-ebooks.info   Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes  189  doc = db.orders.findAndModify {      query: {        user_id: ObjectId "4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001" ,      },      update: {        $set: {          state: "AUTHORIZING"        }      }    }   There are a number of options for altering this command’s functionality. Of the fol- lowing, the only options required are query and either update or remove:    query—A document query selector. Defaults to {}.   update—A document specifying an update. Defaults to {}.   remove—A Boolean value that, when true, removes the object and then returns  it. Defaults to false.    new—A Boolean that, if true, returns the modified document as it appears after the  update  has  been  applied.  Defaults  to  false,  meaning  the  original  docu- ment is returned.    sort—A  document  specifying  a  sort  direction.  Because  findAndModify  will modify only one document at a time, the sort option can be used to help con- trol  which  matching  document  is  processed.  For  example,  you  might  sort  by {created_at: -1} to process the most recently created matching document.    fields—If you only need to return a subset of fields, use this option to specify them. This is especially helpful with larger documents. The fields are specified as they’d be in any query. See the section on fields in chapter 5 for examples.    upsert—A Boolean that, when true, treats findAndModify as an upsert. If the document  sought  doesn’t  exist,  it  will  be  created.  Note  that  if  you  want  to return the newly created document, you also need to specify {new: true}.  You’ll  be  relieved  to  learn  that  removing  documents  poses  few  challenges.  You  can remove an entire collection or you can pass a query selector to the remove method to delete only a subset of a collection. Deleting all reviews is simple:  db.reviews.remove {}   But it’s much more common to delete only the reviews of a particular user:  db.reviews.remove {user_id: ObjectId '4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001' }   All calls to remove take an optional query specifier for selecting exactly which docu- ments to delete. As far as the API goes, that’s all there is to say. But you’ll have a few questions surrounding the concurrency and atomicity of these operations. We’ll explain that in the next section.  7.4.4 Deletes  www.it-ebooks.info   190  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  7.4.5  Concurrency, atomicity, and isolation  It’s important to understand how concurrency works in MongoDB. Prior to MongoDB v2.2, the locking strategy was rather coarse; a single global reader-writer lock reigned over the entire mongod instance. What this meant that at any moment in time, MongoDB permitted either one writer or multiple readers  but not both . In MongoDB v2.2 this was changed to a database-level lock, meaning these semantics apply at the database level rather than throughout the entire MongoDB instance; a database can have either one writer or multiple readers. In MongoDB v3.0, the WiredTiger storage engine works on the collection level and offers document-level locking. Other storage engines may offer other characteristics.    The  locking  characteristics  sound  a  lot  worse  than  they  are  in  practice  because quite a few concurrency optimizations exist around this lock. One is that the database keeps an internal map of which documents are in RAM. For requests to read or write documents not in RAM, the database yields to other operations until the document can be paged into memory.   A second optimization is the yielding of write locks. The issue is that if any one write  takes  a  long  time  to  complete,  all  other  read  and  write  operations  will  be blocked for the duration of the original write. All inserts, updates, and removes take a write lock. Inserts rarely take a long time to complete. But updates that affect, say, an entire collection, as well as deletes that affect a lot of documents, can run long. The current solution to this is to allow these long-running ops to yield periodically for other readers and writers. When an operation yields, it pauses itself, releases its lock, and resumes later.   Despite these optimizations, MongoDB’s locking can affect performance in work- loads  where  there  are  both  heavy  reads  and  heavy  writes.  A  good  but  naive  way  to avoid trouble is to place heavily trafficked collections in separate databases, especially when you’re using the MMAPv1 storage engine. But as mentioned earlier, the situation with MongoDB v3.0 is a lot better because WiredTiger works on the collection level instead of the database level.   When you’re updating and removing documents, this yielding behavior can be a mixed  blessing.  It’s  easy  to  imagine  situations  where  you’d  want  all  documents updated or removed before any other operation takes place. For these cases, you can use a special option called $isolated to keep the operation from yielding. You add the $isolated operator to the query selector like this:  db.reviews.remove {user_id: ObjectId '4c4b1476238d3b4dd5000001' ,   $isolated: true}   The same can be applied to any multi-update. This forces the entire multi-update to complete in isolation:  db.reviews.update {$isolated: true}, {$set: {rating: 0}}, {multi: true}   www.it-ebooks.info   7.4.6 Update performance notes  Nuts and bolts: MongoDB updates and deletes  191  This update sets each review’s rating to 0. Because the operation happens in isolation, the operation will never yield, ensuring a consistent view of the system at all times.    Note  that  if  an  operation  using  $isolated  fails  halfway  through,  there’s  no implicit rollback. Half the documents will have been updated while the other half will still  have  their  original  value.  Prior  to  MongoDB  v2.2  the  $isolated  operator  was called  $atomic,  a  name  that  was  deprecated  presumably  because  these  operations aren’t classically atomic in this failure scenario. This, combined with the fact that the $isolated operator doesn’t work in sharded collections, means that you should use it with care.  The following information only applies to the MMAPv1 storage engine, which is cur- rently the default storage engine. Chapter 10 talks about WiredTiger, which works dif- ferently and more efficiently than MMAPv1. If you’re curious about WiredTiger, you’re free to read chapter 10 right now!   Experience shows that having a basic mental model of how updates affect a docu- ment on disk helps users design systems with better performance. The first thing you should understand is the degree to which an update can be said to happen “in-place.” Ideally, an update will affect the smallest portion of a BSON document on disk because this leads to the greatest efficiency. But this isn’t always what happens.   There are essentially three kinds of updates to a document on disk. The first, and most efficient, takes place when only a single value is updated and the size of the over- all  BSON  document  doesn’t  change.  This  often  happens  with  the  $inc  operator. Because  $inc  is  only  incrementing  an  integer,  the  size  of  that  value  on  disk  won’t change. If the integer represents an int, it’ll always take up four bytes on disk; long integers and doubles will require eight bytes. But altering the values of these numbers doesn’t require any more space and, therefore, only that one value within the docu- ment must be rewritten on disk.    The  second  kind  of  update  changes  the  size  or  structure  of  a  document.  A BSON document is literally represented as a byte array, and the first four bytes of the document always store the document’s size. Thus, if you use the $push opera- tor on a document, you’re both increasing the overall document’s size and chang- ing its structure. This requires that the entire document be rewritten on disk. This isn’t  going  to  be  horribly  inefficient,  but  it’s  worth  keeping  in  mind.  But  if  you have  extremely  large  documents—say,  around  4  MB—and  you’re  pushing  values onto arrays in those documents, that’s potentially a lot of work on the server side. This means that if you intend to do a lot of updates, it’s best to keep your docu- ments small.   The final kind of update is a consequence of rewriting a document. If a document is enlarged and can no longer fit in its allocated space on disk, not only does it need to be rewritten, but it must also be moved to a new space. This moving operation can be  www.it-ebooks.info   192  CHAPTER 7 Updates, atomic operations, and deletes  potentially expensive if it occurs often. MongoDB attempts to mitigate this by dynami- cally adjusting a padding factor on a per-collection basis. This means that if, within a given collection, lots of updates are taking place that require documents to be relo- cated, the internal padding factor will be increased. The padding factor is multiplied by  the  size  of  each  inserted  document  to  get  the  amount  of  extra  space  to  create beyond the document itself. This may reduce the number of future document reloca- tions. As of MongoDB 2.6, power of 2 is used to size the initial allocation of a new document,  which  is  more  efficient  than  the  method  described  in  this  paragraph. Additionally, MongoDB 3.0 uses the power of 2 sizes allocation as the default record allocation strategy for MMAPv1.   To see a given collection’s padding factor, run the collection stats command:  db.tweets.stats   {   "ns" : "twitter.tweets",   "count" : 53641,   "size" : 85794884,   "avgObjSize" : 1599.4273783113663,   "storageSize" : 100375552,   "numExtents" : 12,   "nindexes" : 3,   "lastExtentSize" : 21368832,   "paddingFactor" : 1.2,   "flags" : 0,   "totalIndexSize" : 7946240,   "indexSizes" : {     "_id_" : 2236416,     "user.friends_count_1" : 1564672,     "user.screen_name_1_user.created_at_-1" : 4145152   },   "ok" : 1 }  This collection of tweets has a padding factor of 1.2, which indicates that when a 100- byte document is inserted, MongoDB will allocate 120 bytes on disk. The default pad- ding value is 1, which indicates that no extra space will be allocated.   Now, a brief word of warning. The considerations mentioned here apply especially to deployments where the data size exceeds RAM or where an extreme write load is expected. In these cases, rewriting or moving a document carries a particularly high cost. As you scale your MongoDB applications, think carefully about the best way to use update operations like $inc to avoid these costs.   7.5  Reviewing update operators Table 7.1 lists the update operators we’ve discussed previously in this chapter.  www.it-ebooks.info   193  Table 7.1 Operators  Summary  Operators  $inc  $set  $unset  $rename  Increment fields by given values.  Set fields to the given values.  Unset the passed-in fields.  Rename fields to the given values.  $setOnInsert  In an upsert, set fields only when an insert occurs.  $bit  It performs a bitwise update of a field.  $  $push  $pop  $pull  $each  $slice  $sort  Array Operators  Update the subdocument at the position discovered by the query selector.  Add a value to an array.  $pushAll  Add an array of values to an array. Deprecated in favor of $each.  $addToSet  Add a value to an array but do nothing if it’s a duplicate.  Remove first or last item from an array.  Remove values from an array that match a given query.  $pullAll  Remove multiple values from an array.  Array Operator Modifiers  Used with $push and $addToSet to apply these operators to multiple values.  Used with $push and $each to slice the updated array down to a certain size.  Used with $push, $each, and $slice to sort subdocuments in an array  before slicing.  Isolation Operators  $isolated  Don’t allow other operations to interleave with an update of multiple documents.  7.6  Summary We’ve covered a lot in this chapter. The variety of updates may at first feel like a lot to take in, but the power that these updates represent should be reassuring. The fact is that  MongoDB’s  update  language  is  as  sophisticated  as  its  query  language.  You  can update  a  simple  document  as  easily  as  you  can  a  complex,  nested  structure.  When needed, you can atomically update individual documents and, in combination with findAndModify, build transactional workflows.   If you’ve finished this chapter and feel like you can apply the examples here on  your own, you’re well on your way to becoming a MongoDB guru.  www.it-ebooks.info   www.it-ebooks.info   Part 3  MongoDB mastery  Having read the first two parts of the book, you should understand Mon-  goDB quite well from a developer’s perspective. Now it’s time to switch roles. In this final part of the book, we’ll look at MongoDB from the database administra- tor’s perspective. This means we’ll cover all the things you need to know about performance, deployments, fault tolerance, and scalability.     To  get  the  best  performance  from  MongoDB,  you  have  to  design  efficient queries and then ensure that they’re properly indexed. This is what you’ll learn in chapter 8. You’ll see why indexes are important, and you’ll learn how they’re chosen and then traversed by the query optimizer. You’ll also learn how to use helpful tools like the query explainer and the profiler.    You’ll find that many of the queries you’re creating and optimizing have to do with searching for text. To make this easier and more powerful, MongoDB has some text search–specific features that we’ll cover in chapter 9. These features will allow you to write queries that intelligently search for words and phrases sim- ilar to your search term, among other things.   Chapter 10 is about the WiredTiger storage engine. Chapter 11 is devoted to replication. You’ll spend most of this chapter learning how replica sets work and how to deploy them intelligently for high availability and automatic failover. In addition,  you’ll  learn  how  to  use  replication  to  scale  application  reads  and  to customize the durability of writes.    Horizontal scalability is the Holy Grail for modern database systems; MongoDB scales horizontally by partitioning data in a process known as sharding. Chapter 12 presents sharding theory and practice, showing you when to use it, how to design schemas around it, and how to deploy it.   www.it-ebooks.info   196  PART 3 MongoDB mastery   The last chapter describes the niceties of deployment and administration. In chap- ter 13 we’ll look at specific hardware and operating system recommendations. You’ll then learn how to back up, monitor, and troubleshoot live MongoDB clusters.   www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing and query optimization  This chapter covers   Basic indexing concepts and theory   Practical advice for managing indexes   Using compound indexes for more complex   queries    Optimizing queries   All the MongoDB indexing options  Indexes are enormously important. With the right indexes in place, MongoDB can use  its  hardware  efficiently  and  serve  your  application’s  queries  quickly.  But  the wrong indexes produce the opposite result: slow queries, slow writes, and poorly utilized hardware. It stands to reason that anyone wanting to use MongoDB effec- tively must understand indexing.   But for many developers, indexes are a topic shrouded in mystery. This need not be the case. Once you’ve finished this chapter, you should have a good mental model for thinking clearly about indexes. To introduce the concepts of indexing, we’ll  begin  with  a  modest  thought  experiment.  We’ll  then  explore  some  core indexing concepts and provide an overview of the B-tree data structure underlying MongoDB indexes.  197  www.it-ebooks.info   198  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization    Then  it’s  on  to  indexing  in  practice.  We’ll  discuss  unique,  sparse,  and  multikey indexes, and provide a number of pointers on index administration. Next, we’ll delve into  query  optimization,  describing  how  to  use  explain    and  work  harmoniously with the query optimizer.   In versions 2.0, 2.4, 2.6, and 3.0, MongoDB gained more advanced indexing tech- niques. Most queries only require indexes that match a field’s value or a range of val- ues. But you may also want to run a query for words that are similar to a given word. This requires a text index, which is covered in chapter 9. Or perhaps you’d like to use a  spatial  index  to  find  documents  with  latitude  and  longitude  values  near  a  given point. This chapter is intended to give you a good understanding of indexing funda- mentals so that you’ll be able to create indexes and use them effectively to optimize your queries.  8.1  Indexing theory We’ll  proceed  gradually,  beginning  with  an  extended  analogy  and  ending  with  an exposition  of  some  of  MongoDB’s  key  implementation  details.  Along  the  way,  we’ll define and provide examples of a number of important terms. If you’re not familiar with compound-key indexes, virtual memory, and index data structures, you should find this section helpful.  8.1.1  A thought experiment  To understand indexing, you need a picture in your head. Imagine a cookbook. And not just any cookbook—a massive cookbook: 5,000 pages long with the most deli- cious recipes for every occasion, cuisine, and season, with all the good ingredients you might find at home. This is the cookbook to end them all. Let’s call it The Cook- book Omega.    Although  this  might  be  the  best  of  all  possible  cookbooks,  there  are  two  tiny problems with The Cookbook Omega. The first is that the recipes are in random order. On page 3,475 you have Australian Braised Duck, and on page 2 you’ll find Zacate- can Tacos.    That  would  be  manageable,  were  it  not  for  the  second  problem:  The  Cookbook  Omega has no index.   Here’s the first question to ask yourself: with no index, how do you find the recipe for  Rosemary  Potatoes  in  The  Cookbook  Omega?  Your  only  choice  is  to  scan  through every page of the book until you find the recipe. If the recipe is on page 3,973, that’s how many pages you have to look through. In the worst case, where the recipe is on the last page, you have to look at every single page.   That would be madness. The solution is to build an index.  A SIMPLE INDEX There are several ways you can imagine searching for a recipe, but the recipe’s name is probably a good place to start. If you create an alphabetical listing of each recipe  www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing theory  199  name followed by its page number, you’ll have indexed the book by recipe name. A few entries might look like this:    Tibetan Yak Soufflé: 45   Toasted Sesame Dumplings: 4,011   Turkey à la King: 943  As long as you know the name of the recipe  or even the first few letters of that name , you can use this index to quickly find any recipe in the book. If that’s the only way you expect to search for recipes, your work is done.   But this is unrealistic because you can also imagine wanting to find recipes based on, say, the ingredients you have in your pantry. Or perhaps you want to search by cui- sine. For those cases, you need more indexes.   Here’s a second question: with only one index on the recipe name, how do you find all the cauliflower recipes? Again, lacking the proper indexes, you’d have to scan the entire book, all 5,000 pages. This is true for any search on ingredients or cuisine.  You need to build another index, this time on ingredients. In this index, you have an alphabetical listing of ingredients, each pointing to all the page numbers of recipes containing that ingredient. The most basic index on ingredients would look like this:    Cashews: 3; 20; 42; 88; 103; 1,215…   Cauliflower: 2; 47; 88; 89; 90; 275…   Currants: 1,001; 1,050; 2,000; 2,133…  Is this the index you thought you were going to get? Is it even helpful?  A COMPOUND INDEX This index is good if all you need is a list of recipes for a given ingredient. But if you want to include any other information about the recipe in your search, you still have some scanning to do—once you know the page numbers where cauliflower is refer- enced, you then need to go to each of those pages to get the name of the recipe and what type of cuisine it is. This is better than paging through the whole book, but you can do better.   For example, imagine that you randomly discovered a great cauliflower recipe in The Cookbook Omega several months ago but you’ve forgotten its name; you suspect that you’ll recognize it when you see it. As of now, you have two indexes, one on recipe name and the other on ingredients. Can you think of a way to use these two indexes in combination to find your long-lost cauliflower recipe?   In fact, this is impossible. If you start with the index on recipe name, but don’t remember the name of the recipe, then searching this index is little better than pag- ing through the entire book. If you start with the index on ingredients, then you’ll have  a  list  of  page  numbers  to  check,  but  those  page  numbers  can  in  no  way  be plugged into the index on recipe name. Therefore, you can only use one index in this case, and it happens that the one on ingredients is more helpful.  www.it-ebooks.info   200  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  One index per query Users commonly believe that a query on two fields can be resolved using two sepa- rate indexes on those fields. An algorithm exists for this: look up the page numbers in each index matching each term, and then scan the intersection of those pages for the  individual  recipes  matching  both  terms.  A  number  of  pages  won’t  match,  but you’ll still narrow down the total number of scanned items. Index intersection was first supported by version 2.6 of MongoDB. Note that whether the use of a compound index or the use of an index intersection is more efficient depends on the particular query and the system. Also, keep in mind that the database will use a single index per query if possible and that if you’re going to be querying on more than one field frequently, ensure that a compound index for those fields exists.  What can you do? Happily, there’s a solution to the long-lost cauliflower recipe, and its answer lies in the use of compound indexes.   The two indexes you’ve created so far are single-key  indexes:  they  both  order  only  one key  from  each  recipe.  You’re  going  to  build yet another index for The Cookbook Omega, but this time, instead of using one key per index, you’ll  use  two.  Indexes  that  use  more  than one key like this are called compound indexes.   This compound index uses both ingredi- ents  and  recipe  name,  in  that  order.  You’ll notate the index like this: ingredient-name. Part  of  this  index  would  look  like  what  you see in figure 8.1.    The  value  of  this  index  for  a  human  is obvious.  You  can  now  search  by  ingredient and probably find the recipe you want, even if you  remember  only  the  initial  part  of  the name. For a machine, it’s still valuable for this use case and will keep the database from hav- ing to scan every recipe name listed for that ingredient.  This  compound  index  would  be especially useful if, as with The Cookbook Omega, there  were  several  hundred   or  thousand  cauliflower recipes. Can you see why?    One  thing  to  notice:  with  compound indexes,  order  matters.  Imagine  the  reverse compound index on name-ingredient. Would this index be interchangeable with the com- pound index we just explored?  Figure 8.1 A compound index inside a  cookbook  www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing theory  201   Definitely not. With the new index, once you have the recipe name, your search is already limited to a single recipe; a single page in your cookbook. If this index were used on a search for the recipe Cashew  Marinade and the ingredient Bananas, the index could confirm that no such recipe exists. But this use case is the opposite one: you know the ingredient, but not the recipe name.   The cookbook now has three indexes: one on recipe name, one on ingredient, and one on ingredient-name. This means that you can safely eliminate the single-key index on ingredient. Why? Because a search on a single ingredient can use the index on ingredient-name. That is, if you know the ingredient, you can traverse this com- pound index to get a list of all page numbers containing said ingredient. Look again at the sample entries for this index to see why this is so. INDEXING RULES The goal of this section was to present an extended metaphor to provide you with a bet- ter mental model of indexes. From this metaphor, you can derive a few simple concepts: 1 Indexes significantly reduce the amount of work required to fetch documents. Without the proper indexes, the only way to satisfy a query is to scan all docu- ments linearly until the query conditions are met. This frequently means scan- ning entire collections.  2 Only one single-key index will be used to resolve a query.1 For queries contain- ing multiple keys  say, ingredient and recipe name , a compound index con- taining those keys will best resolve the query.  3 An index on  ingredient can and should be eliminated if you have a second index on ingredient-name. More generally, if you have a compound index on a-b, then a second index on a alone will be redundant, but not one on b.  4 The order of keys in a compound index matters.  Bear in mind that this cookbook analogy can be taken only so far. It’s a model for understanding indexes, but it doesn’t fully correspond to the way MongoDB’s indexes work. In the next section, we’ll elaborate on the rules of thumb just presented, and we’ll explore indexing in MongoDB in detail.  8.1.2  Core indexing concepts The preceding thought experiment hinted at a number of core indexing concepts. Here and throughout the rest of the chapter, we’ll unpack those ideas.  SINGLE-KEY INDEXES With a single-key index, each entry in the index corresponds to a single value from each of the documents indexed. The default index on _id is a good example of a single-key index. Because this field is indexed, each document’s _id also lives in an index for fast retrieval by that field.  1 One exception is queries using the $or operator. But as a general rule, this isn’t possible, or even desirable,  in MongoDB.  www.it-ebooks.info   202  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  COMPOUND-KEY INDEXES Although when starting with MongoDB 2.6 you can use more than one index for a query, it’s best if you use only a single index. But you often need to query on more than one attribute, and you want such a query to be as efficient as possible. For exam- ple, imagine that you’ve built two indexes on the products collection from this book’s e-commerce  example:  one  index  on  manufacturer  and  another  on  price.  In  this case,  you’ve  created  two  entirely  distinct  data  structures  that,  when  traversed,  are ordered like the lists you see in figure 8.2.  Ace  Acme  Acme  Acme  Acme  Biz  Traversal  7999  7500  7500  7500  7499  7499  Ox12  OxFF  OxA1  Ox0B  Ox1C  OxEE  OxFF  Ox12  OxEE  OxA1  Ox0B  Ox1C  Manufacturers and disk locations  Sale prices and disk locations  Figure 8.2 Single-key index traversal  Now, imagine your query looks like this:  db.products.find {     'details.manufacturer': 'Acme',     'pricing.sale': {       $lt: 7500     }   }   This query says to find all Acme products costing less than $75.00. If you issue this query with single-key indexes on manufacturer and price,  only  one  of  them  will  be  used.  The query optimizer will pick the more efficient of the  two,  but  neither  will  give  you  an  ideal result. To satisfy the query using these indexes, you’d  have  to  traverse  each  structure  sepa- rately and then grab the list of disk locations that match and calculate their intersection.  Acme – 7500  Acme – 7499  Acme – 7999  Ace – 8000  Acme – 7499  Ox1C  OxA1  Ox0B  OxFF  Ox12  Traversal   A compound index is a single index where each entry is composed of more than one key. If you were to build a compound-key index on manufacturer and price, the ordered repre- sentation would look like figure 8.3.  Biz – 8999  OxEE  Manufacturers and prices,  with disk locations  Figure 8.3 Compound-key index traversal  www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing theory  203  Traversal   To fulfill your query, the query optimizer only needs to find the first entry in the index where  manufacturer  is  Acme  and  price  is 7500. From there, the results can be retrieved with  a  simple  scan  of  the  successive  index entries, stopping when the value of the man- ufacturer no longer equals Acme.  7999 – Acme  7500 – Ace  7500 – Acme  7500 – Biz  7499 – Acme  OxFF  OxEE  Ox12  OxA1  Ox0B  Ox1C  7499 – Acme  with disk locations  Prices and manufacturers,  Figure 8.4 A compound-key index with the  keys reversed    There  are  two  things  you  should  notice about  the  way  this  index  and  query  work together.  The  first  is  that  the  order  of  the index’s  keys  matters.  If  you’d  declared  a compound  index  where  price  was  the  first key and manufacturer the second, then your query  would’ve  been  far  less  efficient.  Can you see why? Take a look at the structure of the entries in such an index in figure 8.4.  Keys must be compared in the order in which they appear. Unfortunately, this index doesn’t provide an easy way to jump to all the Acme products, so the only way to  fulfill  your  query  would  be  to  look  at  every  product  whose  price  is  less  than $75.00 and then select only those products made by Acme. To put this in perspec- tive, imagine that your collection had a million products, all priced under $100.00 and  evenly  distributed  by  price.  Under  these  circumstances,  fulfilling  your  query would require that you scan 750,000 index entries. By contrast, using the original compound  index,  where  manufacturer  precedes  price,  the  number  of  entries scanned would be the same as the number of entries returned. This is because once you’ve arrived at the entry for   Acme  -  7500 , it’s a simple, in-order scan to serve the query.   The order of keys in a compound index matters. If that seems clear, the second thing you should understand is why we’ve chosen the first ordering over the second. This may be obvious from the diagrams, but there’s another way to look at the prob- lem. Look again at the query: the two query terms specify different kinds of matches. On  manufacturer,  you  want  to  match  the  term  exactly.  But  on  price,  you  want  to match a range of values, beginning with 7500. As a general rule, a query where one term demands an exact match and another specifies a range requires a compound index  where  the  range  key  comes  second.  We’ll  revisit  this  idea  in  the  section  on query optimization.  INDEX EFFICIENCY Although indexes are essential for good query performance, each new index imposes a small maintenance cost. Whenever you add a document to a collection, each index on that collection must be modified to include the new document. If a particular col- lection has 10 indexes, that makes 10 separate structures to modify on each insert, in addition to writing the document itself. This holds for any write operation, whether  www.it-ebooks.info   204  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  you’re removing a document, relocating a document because the allocated space isn’t enough, or updating a given document’s indexed keys.   For read-intensive applications, the cost of indexes is almost always justified. Just realize  that  indexes  do  impose  a  cost  and  that  they  therefore  must  be  chosen  with care. This means ensuring that all your indexes are used and that none are redun- dant. You can do this in part by profiling your application’s queries; we’ll describe this process later in the chapter.   But there’s a second consideration. Even with all the right indexes in place, it’s still possible that those indexes won’t result in faster queries. This occurs when indexes and a working data set don’t fit in RAM.   You may recall from chapter 1 that MongoDB tells the operating system to map all data files to memory using the mmap   system call when the MMAPv1 default storage engine is used. As you’ll learn in chapter 10, the WiredTiger storage engine works dif- ferently. From this point on, the data files, which include all documents, collections, and their indexes, are swapped in and out of  RAM by the operating system in 4  KB chunks called pages.2 Whenever data from a given page is requested, the operating system must ensure that the page is available in RAM. If it’s not, a kind of exception known as a page fault is raised, and this tells the memory manager to load the page from disk into RAM.   With sufficient RAM, all the data files in use will eventually be loaded into mem- ory. Whenever that memory is altered, as in the case of a write, those changes will be flushed to disk asynchronously by the OS. The write, however, will be fast because it occurs directly in RAM; thus the number of disk accesses is reduced to a minimum. But if the working data set can’t fit into RAM, page faults will start to creep up. This means  that  the  operating  system  will  be  going  to  disk  frequently,  greatly  slowing read and write operations. In the worst case, as data size becomes much larger than available RAM, a situation can occur where for any read or write, data must be paged to  and  from  disk.  This  is  known  as thrashing,  and  it  causes  performance  to  take  a severe dive.   Fortunately, this situation is relatively easy to avoid. At a minimum, you need to make sure that your indexes will fit in RAM. This is one reason why it’s important to avoid cre- ating any unneeded indexes. With extra indexes in place, more RAM will be required to maintain those indexes. Along the same lines, each index should have only the keys it needs. A triple-key compound index might be necessary at times, but be aware that it’ll use more space than a simple single-key index. One example of where it might be valuable to create an index with more than one or two fields is if you can create a cov- ering index for a frequent query. A covering index is one where the entire query can be satisfied from reading only the index, making queries very fast. Covering indexes are discussed more at the end of section 8.3.  2 The 4 KB page size is standard but not universal.  www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing theory  205   Bear in mind that indexes are stored separately in RAM from the data they index and aren’t clustered. In a clustered index, the order of the index corresponds directly to the order of the underlying data; if you index recipes by name in a clustered index, then all of the recipes starting with A will be stored together, followed by B, C, and so on.  This  isn’t  the  case  in  MongoDB.  Every  name  in  the  recipe  index  is  essentially duplicated in the index, and the order of these names has no bearing on the order of the data. This is important when you scan through a collection sorted with an index because  it  means  that  every  document  fetched  could  be  anywhere  in  the  data  set. There’s no guaranteed locality with the previously fetched data.   Ideally, indexes and a working data set fit in RAM. But estimating how much RAM this requires for any given deployment isn’t always easy. You can always discover total index size by looking at the results of the stats command. The working set is the sub- set of total data commonly queried and updated, which is different for every applica- tion. Suppose you have a million users for which you have data. If only half of them are active  thus half the user documents are queried , then your working set for the user  collection  is  half  the  total  data  size.  If  these  documents  are  evenly  distributed throughout the entire data set, though, it’s likely that untouched user documents are also being loaded into memory, which imposes a cost.   In chapter 10, we’ll revisit the concept of the working set, and we’ll look at spe- cific  ways  to  diagnose  hardware-related  performance  issues.  For  now,  be  aware  of the potential costs of adding new indexes, and keep an eye on the ratio of index and working set size to RAM. Doing so will help you to maintain good performance as your data grows.  As  mentioned,  MongoDB  represents  most  indexes  internally  as  B-trees.  B-trees  are ubiquitous, having remained in popular use for database records and indexes since at least the late 1970s.3 If you’ve used other database systems, you may already be familiar with the various aspects of using B-trees. This is good because it means you can effec- tively transfer most of your knowledge of indexing. If you don’t know much about B-trees, that’s okay, too; this section will present the concepts most relevant to your work with MongoDB.    B-trees  have  two  overarching  traits  that  make  them  ideal  for  database  indexes. First,  they  facilitate  a  variety  of  queries,  including  exact  matches,  range  conditions, sorting, prefix matching, and index-only queries. Second, they’re able to remain bal- anced in spite of the addition and removal of keys.   We’ll look at a simple representation of a B-tree and then discuss some principles that you’ll want to keep in mind. Imagine that you have a collection of users and that  8.1.3 B-trees  3 The MMAPv1 storage engine uses B-trees for its indexes only; collections are stored as doubly linked lists. As you’ll see in chapter 10, the WiredTiger storage engine works a little differently despite the fact that it also uses B-trees. But MMAPv1 remains the default MongoDB storage engine.  www.it-ebooks.info   206  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  ["Edwards", 21]  ["Perry", 18]   Preallocated space   Bucket  ["Adams", 17]  ["Banks", 27]   Preallocated space   ["Richards", 19]  ["Ryan", 20]   Empty   Bucket  Bucket  Figure 8.5 Sample B-tree structure  ["Grant", 19]  ["Morton", 27]   Preallocated space   Bucket  you’ve created a compound index on last name and age. An abstract representation of the resulting B-tree might look something like figure 8.5.   A B-tree, as you might guess, is a tree-like data structure. Each node in the tree can contain multiple keys. You can see in the example that the root node contains two keys, each of which is in the form of a  BSON object representing an indexed value from the users collection. In reading the contents of the root node, you can see the keys for two documents, indicating last names Edwards and Perry, with ages of 21 and 18,  respectively.  Each  of  these  keys  includes  two  pointers:  one  to  the  data  file  it belongs  to  and  another  to  the  child  node.  Additionally,  the  node  itself  points  to another node with values less than the node’s smallest value.   In MongoDB’s B-tree implementation, a new node is allocated 8,192 bytes, which means that in practice, each node may contain hundreds of keys. This depends on the  average  index  key  size;  in  this  case,  that  average  key  size  might  be  around  30 bytes. The maximum key size since MongoDB v2.0 is 1024 bytes. Add to this a per-key overhead of 18 bytes and a per-node overhead of 40 bytes, and this results in about 170 keys per node.4 One thing to notice is that each node has some empty space  not to scale .    This is relevant because users frequently want to know why index sizes are what they are. You now know that each node is 8 KB, and you can estimate how many keys will fit into each node. To calculate this, keep in mind that B-tree nodes are usually intentionally kept around 60% full by default.   Given this information, you should now see why indexes aren’t free, in terms of space or time required to update them. Use this information to help decide when to create indexes on your collections and when to avoid them.  4  8192 – 40     30 + 18  = 169.8  www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing in practice  207  8.2  8.2.1  Indexing in practice With most of the theory behind us, we’ll now look at some refinements on our con- cept  of  indexing  in  MongoDB.  We’ll  then  proceed  to  some  of  the  details  of  index administration.  Index types MongoDB uses B-trees for indexes and allows you to apply several characteristics to these indexes. This section should give you an overview of your options when creat- ing indexes. UNIQUE INDEXES Often you want to ensure that a field in your document, such as _id or username, is unique to that document. Unique indexes are a way to enforce this characteristic, and in fact are used by MongoDB to ensure that _id is a unique primary key.   To create a unique index, specify the unique option:  db.users.createIndex {username: 1}, {unique: true}   Unique indexes enforce uniqueness across all their entries. If you try to insert a docu- ment into this book’s sample application’s users collection with an already-indexed username value, the insert will fail with the following exception:  E11000 duplicate key error index:   gardening.users.$username_1  dup key: { : "kbanker" }  If  using  a  driver,  this  exception  will  be  caught  only  if  you  perform  the  insert  using your  driver’s  safe  mode,  which  is  the  default.  You  may  have  also  encountered  this error if you attempted to insert two documents with the same _id—every MongoDB collection has a unique index on this field because it’s the primary key.   If you need a unique index on a collection, it’s usually best to create the index before  inserting  any  data.  If  you  create  the  index  in  advance,  you  guarantee  the uniqueness constraint from the start. When creating a unique index on a collection that already contains data, you run the risk of failure because it’s possible that dupli- cate keys may already exist in the collection. When duplicate keys exist, the index cre- ation fails.   If you do find yourself needing to create a unique index on an established collec- tion,  you  have  a  couple  of  options.  The  first  is  to  repeatedly  attempt  to  create  the unique index and use the failure messages to manually remove the documents with duplicate keys. But if the data isn’t so important, you can also instruct the database to drop  documents  with  duplicate  keys  automatically  using  the  dropDups  option.  For example, if your users collection already contains data, and if you don’t care that doc- uments with duplicate keys are removed, you can issue the index creation command like this:  db.users.createIndex {username: 1}, {unique: true, dropDups: true}   www.it-ebooks.info   208  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  Be careful using dropDups Note that the choice of duplicate key documents to be preserved is arbitrary, so use this feature with extreme care. Typically you’ll want to decide which duplicates to drop instead of having MongoDB choose for you.  The dropDups option was removed starting with MongoDB 3.x and there’s no direct replacement for the dropDups option. You can either create a new collection, create the unique index on this new collection, and copy all the documents from the old col- lection to the new one  while making sure that you’re ignoring duplicated key errors during the process , or deal with duplicate key documents manually.  SPARSE INDEXES Indexes are dense by default. This means that for every document in an indexed col- lection,  a  corresponding  entry  exists  in  the  index,  even  if  the  document  lacks  the indexed key. For example, recall the products collection from your e-commerce data model, and imagine that you’ve built an index on the product attribute category_ids. Now suppose that a few products haven’t been assigned to any categories. For each of these  category-less  products,  there  will  still  exist  a  null  entry  in  the  category_ids index. You can query for those null values like this:  db.products.find {category_ids: null}   Here, when searching for all products lacking a category, the query optimizer will still be able to use the index on category_ids to locate the corresponding products.   But in two cases a dense index is undesirable. The first is when you want a unique index on a field that doesn’t appear in every document in the collection. For instance, you definitely want a unique index on every product’s sku field. But suppose that, for some reason, products are entered into the system before a  SKU is assigned. If you have a unique index on sku and attempt to insert more than one product without a SKU, the first insert will succeed, but all subsequent inserts will fail because there will already be an entry in the index where sku is null. This is a case where a dense index doesn’t serve your purpose. Instead you want a unique and sparse index.   In a sparse index, only those documents having some value for the indexed key will appear. If you want to create a sparse index, all you have to do is specify  {sparse: true}. For example, you can create a unique sparse index on sku like this:  db.products.createIndex {sku: 1}, {unique: true, sparse: true}   There’s another case where a sparse index is desirable: when a large number of docu- ments  in  a  collection  don’t  contain  the  indexed  key.  For  example,  suppose  you allowed  anonymous  reviews  on  your  e-commerce  site.  In  this  case,  half  the  reviews might  lack  a  user_id  field,  and  if  that  field  were  indexed,  half  the  entries  in  that index would be null. This would be inefficient for two reasons. First, it would increase  www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing in practice  209  the size of the index. Second, it’d require updates to the index when adding and remov- ing documents with null user_id fields.   If you rarely  or never  expect queries on anonymous reviews, you might elect to  build a sparse index on user_id. Again, setting the sparse option is simple:  db.reviews.createIndex {user_id: 1}, {sparse: true, unique: false}   Now only those reviews linked to a user via the user_id field will be indexed. MULTIKEY INDEXES In  earlier  chapters  you  saw  several  examples  of  indexing  fields  whose  values  are arrays.5 This is made possible by what’s known as a multikey index, which allows multi- ple entries in the index to reference the same document. This makes sense if we look at a simple example. Suppose you have a product document with a few tags like this:  {    name: "Wheelbarrow",   tags: ["tools", "gardening", "soil"] }  If  you  create  an  index  on  tags,  then  each  value  in  this  document’s  tags  array  will appear in the index. This means that a query on any one of these array values can use the index to locate the document. This is the idea behind a multikey index: multiple index entries, or keys, end up referencing the same document.   Multikey indexes are always enabled in MongoDB, with a few exceptions, such as with hashed indexes. Whenever an indexed field contains an array, each array value will be given its own entry in the index.   The intelligent use of multikey indexes is essential to proper MongoDB schema design. This should be evident from the examples presented in chapters 4 through 6; several more examples are provided in the design patterns section of appendix B. But creating,  updating,  or  deleting  multikey  indexes  is  more  expensive  than  creating, updating, or deleting single-key indexes. HASHED INDEXES In  the  previous  examples  of  B-tree  indexes,  we  showed  how  MongoDB  builds  the index tree out of the values being indexed. Thus, in an index of recipes, the “Apple Pie” entry is near the “Artichoke Ravioli” entry. This may seem obvious and natural, but MongoDB also supports hashed indexes where the entries are first passed through a hash function.6 This means the hashed values will determine the ordering, so these recipes will likely not be near each other in the index.  5 Think of category IDs, for instance. 6 Recall that a hash function takes some input and maps it to an output value of fixed length. For a given input, the hash output will always be consistent. A good hash function in this context will evenly distribute the output values so that they appear to be random.  www.it-ebooks.info   210  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization   Indexes of this kind can be created in MongoDB by passing 'hashed' as the index  sorting direction. For example:  db.recipes.createIndex {recipe_name: 'hashed'}   Because  the  indexed  value  is  a  hash  of  the  original,  these  indexes  carry  some restrictions:    Equality queries will work much the same, but range queries aren’t supported.    Multikey hashed indexes aren’t allowed.    Floating-point values are cast to an integer before being hashed; thus, 4.2 and  4.3 will have the same value in a hashed index.  Given these restrictions and peculiarities, you may wonder why anyone would use a hashed index. The answer lies in the fact that the entries in a hashed index are evenly distributed. In other words, when you have a non-uniform distribution of key data, then a hashed index will create uniformity if you can live with its restrictions. Recall that  “Apple  Pie”  and  “Artichoke  Ravioli”  are  no  longer  next  to  each  other  in  the hashed index; the data locality of the index has changed. This is useful in sharded col- lections  where  the  shard  index  determines  which  shard  each  document  will  be assigned to. If your shard index is based on an increasing value, such as a MongoDB OIDs,7 then new documents created will only be inserted to a single shard—unless the index is hashed.   Let’s dig into that statement. Unless explicitly set, a MongoDB document will use  an OID as its primary key. Here are a few sequentially generated OIDs:  5247ae72defd45a1daba9da9 5247ae73defd45a1daba9daa 5247ae73defd45a1daba9dab  Notice how similar the values are; the most significant bits are based on the time when they were generated. When new documents are inserted with these IDs, their index entries are likely to be near eachother. If the index using these IDs is being used to decide which shard  and thus machine  a document should reside on, these docu- ments are also likely to be inserted on to the same machine. This can be detrimental if a collection is receiving heavy write load, because only a single machine is being used. Hashed  indexes  solve  this  issue  by  distributing  these  documents  evenly  in  a  name- space, and thus across shards and machines. To fully understand this example, wait until you read chapter 12.   If you’re not familiar with sharding, it’s described in much greater detail in chap- ter 11, and this example will make more sense once we describe sharding in detail.  7 MongoDB object IDs  OIDs  are the default ids used for MongoDB documents. We discussed them in more  detail in chapter 3, section 3.2.1.  www.it-ebooks.info   8.2.2  Indexing in practice  211  For now, the important thing to remember is that hashed indexes change the locality of index entries, which can be useful in sharded collections. GEOSPATIAL INDEXES Another useful query capability is to find documents “close” to a given location, based on latitude and longitude values stored in each document. If you store a directory of restaurants in a MongoDB collection, for example, users are probably most eager to find restaurants located near their home. One answer to this is to run a query to find every restaurant within a 10-mile radius. Executing this query requires an index that can  efficiently  calculate  geographic  distances,  including  the  curvature  of  the  earth. Geospatial indexes can handle this and other types of queries.  Index administration We’ve discussed simple index administration, such as creating indexes, in this and in previous chapters. When you use indexes in real-world applications, however, it’s use- ful to understand this topic in greater depth. Here we’ll see index creation and dele- tion in detail and address questions surrounding compaction and backups. CREATING AND DELETING INDEXES By now you’ve created quite a few indexes, so this should be easy. Simply call create- Index   either in the shell or with your language of choice. Please note that in Mon- goDB v3.0, ensureIndex  , which was previously used for creating indexes, has been replaced by the createIndex   command and shouldn’t be used anymore. What you may  not  know  is  that  this  method  works  by  creating  a  document  defining  the  new index and putting it into the special system.indexes collection.   Though it’s usually easier to use a helper method to create an index, you can also insert an index specification manually  this is what the helper methods do . You need to  be  sure  you’ve  specified  the  minimum  set  of  keys:  ns,  key,  and  name.  ns  is  the namespace, key is the field or combination of fields to index, and name is a name used to refer to the index. Any additional options, like sparse, can also be specified here. For example, let’s create a sparse index on the users collection:  use green spec = {ns: "green.users", key: {'addresses.zip': 1}, name: 'zip'} db.system.indexes.insert spec, true   If no errors are returned on insert, the index now exists, and you can query the sys- tem.indexes collection to prove it:  db.system.indexes.find  .pretty   {    "ns" : "green.users",    "key" : {      "addresses.zip" : 1    },    "name" : "zip",    "v" : 1 }  www.it-ebooks.info   212  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  The v field was added in MongoDB v2.0 to store the version of the index. This version field allows for future changes in the internal index format but should be of little con- cern to application developers.   To delete an index, you might think that all you need to do is remove the index document from system.indexes, but this operation is prohibited. Instead, you must delete indexes using the database command deleteIndexes. As with index creation, there are helpers for deleting indexes, but if you want to run the command itself, you can do that, too. The command takes as its argument a document containing the col- lection name and either the name of the index to drop or * to drop all indexes. To manually drop the index you created, issue the command like this:  use green db.runCommand {deleteIndexes: "users", index: "zip"}   In most cases, you’ll use the shell’s helpers to create and drop indexes:   use green db.users.createIndex {zip: 1}   You can then check the index specifications with the getIndexSpecs   method:   > db.users.getIndexes   [   {     "v" : 1,     "key" : {       "_id" : 1     },     "ns" : "green.users",      "name" : "_id_"   },   {     "v" : 1,     "key" : {       "zip" : 1     },     "ns" : "green.users",     "name" : "zip_1"   } ]  use green db.users.dropIndex "zip_1"   Finally, you can drop the index using the dropIndex   method. Note that you must supply the index’s name as specified in the spec:   You can also supply your own name while creating an index using the name parameter.  Those are the basics of creating and deleting indexes. For what to expect when an  index is created, read on.  www.it-ebooks.info   Indexing in practice  213  BUILDING INDEXES Most of the time, you’ll want to declare your indexes before putting your application into production. This allows indexes to be built incrementally, as the data is inserted. But there are two cases where you might choose to build an index after the fact. The first case occurs when you need to import a lot of data before switching into produc- tion. For instance, you might be migrating an application to MongoDB and need to seed the database with user information from a data warehouse. You could create the indexes on your user data in advance, but doing so after you’ve imported the data will ensure an ideally balanced and compacted index from the start. It’ll also minimize the net time to build the index.   The second  and more obvious  case for creating indexes on existing data sets is when you have to optimize for new queries. This occurs when you add or change func- tionality in your application, and it happens more than you might think. Suppose you allow users to log in using their username, so you index that field. Then you modify your application to also allow your users to log in using their email; now you probably need a second index on the email field. Watch out for cases like these because they require rethinking your indexing.   Regardless of why you’re creating new indexes, the process isn’t always pleasing. For large data sets, building an index can take hours, even days. But you can monitor the progress of an index build from the MongoDB logs. Let’s take an example from a data set that we’ll use in the next section. First, you declare an index to be built:  db.values.createIndex {open: 1, close: 1}   Be careful declaring indexes Because it’s so easy to declare indexes, it’s also easy to inadvertently trigger an index build. If the data set is large enough, the build will take a long time. And in a production situation, this can be a nightmare because there’s no easy way to kill an index build. If this ever happens, you may have to fail over to a backup or secondary. The most prudent advice is to treat an index build as a kind of database migration.  The index builds in two steps. In the first step, the values to be indexed are sorted. A sorted data set makes for a much more efficient insertion into the B-tree. If you look at the MongoDB server log, you’ll see the progress printed for long index builds. Note that  the  progress  of  the  sort  is  indicated  by  the  ratio  of  the  number  of  documents sorted to the total number of documents:  [conn1] building new index on { open: 1.0, close: 1.0 } for stocks.values     1000000 4308303  23%     2000000 4308303  46%     3000000 4308303  69%     4000000 4308303  92%     Tue Jan  4 09:59:13 [conn1]    external sort used : 5 files  in 55 secs  www.it-ebooks.info   214  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  For step two, the sorted values are inserted into the index. Progress is indicated in the same way, and when complete, the time it took to complete the index build is indi- cated as the insert time into system.indexes:  1200300 4308303  27%     2227900 4308303  51%     2837100 4308303  65%     3278100 4308303  76%     3783300 4308303  87%     4075500 4308303  94% Tue Jan  4 10:00:16 [conn1] done building bottom layer, going to commit Tue Jan  4 10:00:16 [conn1] done for 4308303 records 118.942secs Tue Jan  4 10:00:16 [conn1] insert stocks.system.indexes 118942ms  In addition to examining the MongoDB log, you can check the index build progress by running the shell’s currentOp   method. This command’s output varies from ver- sion to version, but it will probably look something like the next listing.8  Listing 8.1 Checking the index build process with the shell currentOP   method  Shows this is using  indexes in the query  Operation ID   > db.currentOp   {   "inprog" : [     {       "opid" : 83695,                  "active" : true,       "secs_running" : 55,       "op" : "insert",        "ns" : "stocks.system.indexes",          "insert" : {                         "v" : 1,         "key" : {           "desc" : 1         },         "ns" : "stocks.values",         "name" : "desc_1"       },       "client" : "127.0.0.1:56391",       "desc" : "conn12",       "threadId" : "0x10f20c000",       "connectionId" : 12,       "locks" : {                             "^" : "w",         "^stocks" : "W"       },       "waitingForLock" : false,       "msg" : "index:  1 3  external sort Index:  1 3                 External Sort Progress: 3999999 4308303 92%",  Locks associated  with the operation  Stocks  database  8 Note that if you’ve started the index build from the MongoDB shell, you’ll have to open a new instance of the  shell to run currentOp concurrently.

Note also the locks element, which indi- cates that the index build takes a write lock on the stocks database. This means that no other client can read or write from the database at this time. If you’re running in production, this is obviously a bad thing, and it’s the reason why long index builds can be so vexing. Let’s explore two possible solutions to this problem.  BACKGROUND INDEXING If you’re running in production and can’t afford to halt access to the database, you can specify that an index be built in the background. Although the index build will still take a write lock, the job will yield to allow other readers and writers to access the database. If your application typically exerts a heavy load on MongoDB, a background index build will degrade performance, but this may be acceptable under certain cir- cumstances. For example, if you know that the index can be built within a time win- dow  where  application  traffic  is  at  a  minimum,  background  indexing  in  this  case might be a good choice.   To build an index in the background, specify {background: true} when you declare  the index. The previous index can be built in the background like this:  db.values.createIndex {open: 1, close: 1}, {background: true}   OFFLINE INDEXING Building an index in the background may still put an unacceptable amount of load on a production server. If this is the case, you may need to index the data offline. This will usually involve taking a replica node offline, building the index on that node by itself, and then allowing the node to catch up with the master replica. Once it’s caught up, you can promote the node to primary and then take another secondary offline and build its version of the index. This tactic presumes that your replication oplog is large enough  to  prevent  the  offline  node  from  becoming  stale  during  the  index  build. Chapter 10 covers replication in detail and should help you plan for a migration such as this.  www.it-ebooks.info   216  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  BACKUPS Because indexes are hard to build, you may want to back them up. Unfortunately, not all backup methods include indexes. For instance, you might be tempted to use mongodump and mongorestore, but these utilities preserve collections and index decla- rations only. This means that when you run mongorestore, all the indexes declared for any collections you’ve backed up will be re-created. As always, if your data set is large, the time it takes to build these indexes may be unacceptable.   Consequently, if you want your backups to include indexes, you’ll want to opt for backing up the MongoDB data files themselves. More details about this, as well as gen- eral instructions for backups, can be found in chapter 13.  DEFRAGMENTING If your application heavily updates existing data or performs a lot of large deletions, you may end up with a highly fragmented index. B-trees will coalesce on their own somewhat, but this isn’t always sufficient to offset a high delete volume. The primary symptom of a fragmented index is an index size much larger than you’d expect for the given data size. This fragmented state can result in indexes using more RAM than necessary. In these cases, you may want to consider rebuilding one or more indexes. You  can  do  this  by  dropping  and  re-creating  individual  indexes  or  by  running  the reIndex command, which will rebuild all indexes for a given collection:  db.values.reIndex  ;  Be careful about reindexing: the command will take out a write lock for the duration of the rebuild, temporarily rendering your MongoDB instance unusable. Reindexing is best done offline, as described earlier  for  building  indexes  on  a  secondary.  Note that the compact command, discussed in chapter 10, will also rebuild indexes for the collection on which it’s run.   We’ve discussed how to create and manage your indexes, but despite this knowl- edge, you may still find yourself in a situation where your queries aren’t fast enough. This  can  occur  as  you  add  data,  traffic,  or  new  queries.  Let’s  learn  how  to  identify these queries that could be faster and improve the situation.  8.3  Query optimization Query optimization is the process of identifying slow queries, discovering why they’re slow, and then taking steps to speed them up. In this section, we’ll look at each step of the query optimization process in turn so that by the time you finish reading, you’ll have a framework for addressing problematic queries on any MongoDB installation.   Before diving in, we must warn you that the techniques presented here can’t be used to solve every query performance problem. The causes of slow queries vary too much. Poor application design, inappropriate data models, and insufficient physical hardware  are  all  common  culprits,  and  their  remedies  require  a  significant  time investment. Here we’ll look at ways to optimize queries by restructuring the queries  www.it-ebooks.info   8.3.1  Query optimization  217  themselves and by building the most useful indexes. We’ll also describe other avenues for investigation when these techniques fail to deliver.  Identifying slow queries If your MongoDB-based application feels sluggish, it’s time to start profiling your que- ries. Any disciplined approach to application design should include a query audit, and MongoDB makes this easy. Though the requirements vary per application, it’s safe to assume  that  for  most  apps,  queries  shouldn’t  take  much  longer  than  100  ms.  The MongoDB logger has this assumption ingrained because it prints a warning whenever any operation, including a query, takes longer than 100 ms. The logs, therefore, are the first place you should look for slow queries.   It’s unlikely that any of the data sets we’ve worked with up until now have been large enough to generate queries lasting longer than 100 ms. For the following exam- ples, we’ll use a data set consisting of daily NASDAQ summaries. If you want to follow along, you’ll need to have this data locally. To import it, first download the archive using http:  mng.bz ii49. Then unzip the file to a temporary folder. You’ll see the fol- lowing output:  $ unzip stocks.zip Archive:  stocks.zip    creating: dump stocks    inflating: dump stocks system.indexes.bson   inflating: dump stocks values.bson  Finally, after starting the mongod process if necessary, restore the dump like this:   $ mongorestore -d stocks dump stocks  This process may take a few minutes. You may also receive some warning messages at the beginning and end of the process. Don’t worry about those.    The stocks data set is large and easy to work with. For a certain subset of the NASDAQ stock exchange’s symbols, there’s a document for each day’s high, low, close, and vol- ume for a 25-year period beginning in 1983. Given the number and size of the docu- ments in this collection, it’s easy to generate one of the log warnings. Try querying for the first occurrence of Google’s stock price:  use stocks db.values.find {"stock_symbol": "GOOG"} .sort {date: -1} .limit 1   You’ll  notice  that  this  takes  some  time  to  run,  and  if  you  check  the  MongoDB  log, you’ll see the expected slow query warning. Here’s a sample of the output to expect from MongoDB v2.6:  Mon Sep 30 21:48:58.066 [conn20] query stocks.values query: { query: {   stock_symbol: "GOOG" }, orderby: { date: -1.0 } }             ntoreturn:1 ntoskip:0 nscanned:4308303 scanAndOrder:1 keyUpdates:0   numYields: 3 locks micros  r:4399440             nreturned:1 reslen:194 4011ms   www.it-ebooks.info   218  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  A similar log message from MongoDB v3.0 using another collection has the follow- ing format:  2015-09-11T21:17:15.414+0300 I COMMAND  [conn99] command green.$cmd command:  insert { insert: "system.indexes", documents: [ { _id:  ObjectId '55f31aab9a50479be0a7dcd7' , ns: "green.users", key: {  addresses.zip: 1.0 }, name: "zip" } ], ordered: false } keyUpdates:0  writeConflicts:0 numYields:0 reslen:40 locks:{ Global: { acquireCount: { r:  1, w: 1 } }, MMAPV1Journal: { acquireCount: { w: 9 } }, Database: {  acquireCount: { W: 1 } }, Collection: { acquireCount: { W: 1 } }, Metadata: {  acquireCount: { W: 5 } } } 102ms  There’s a lot of information here, and we’ll go over the meaning of all of it when we discuss explain  . For now, if you read the message carefully, you should be able to extract the most important parts: that it’s a query on stocks.values; that the query selector consists of a match on stock_symbol and that a sort is being performed; and, maybe  most  significantly,  that  the  query  takes  a  whopping  four  seconds   4011  ms . The exact time may vary quite a bit depending on the speed of your computer.   Warnings like this must be addressed. They’re so critical that it’s worth your while to occasionally search for them in your MongoDB logs. This can be accomplished eas- ily with grep:  grep -E '[0-9]+ms' mongod.log  If 100 ms is too high a threshold, you can lower it with the  --slowms server option when you start MongoDB. If you define slow as taking longer than 50 ms, then start mongod with --slowms 50.   Of course, using grep to search through logs isn’t very systematic. You can use the MongoDB  logs  to  check  for  slow  queries,  but  the  procedure  is  rather  coarse  and should be reserved as a kind of sanity check in a staging or production environment. To  identify  slow  queries  before  they  become  a  problem,  you  want  a  precision  tool. MongoDB’s built-in query profiler is exactly that.  USING THE PROFILER For  identifying  slow  queries,  you  can’t  beat  the  built-in  profiler.  Profiling  is  dis- abled by default, so let’s get started by enabling it. From the MongoDB shell, enter the following:  use stocks db.setProfilingLevel 2   First you select the database you want to profile; profiling is always scoped to a particu- lar database. Then you set the profiling level to  2. This is the most verbose level; it directs the profiler to log every read and write. A couple of other options are available. To log only slow  100 ms  operations, set the profiling level to 1. To disable the query profiler altogether, set it to 0. And to log only operations taking longer than a certain  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  219  threshold in milliseconds, pass the number of milliseconds as the second argument like this:  use stocks db.setProfilingLevel 1, 50   Once you’ve enabled the profiler, it’s time to issue some queries. Let’s run another query on the stocks database. Try finding the highest closing price in the data set:  db.values.find {} .sort {close: -1} .limit 1   PROFILING RESULTS The profiling results are stored in a special capped collection called system.profile which  is  located  in  the  database  where  you  executed  the  setProfilingLevel  com- mand. Recall that capped collections are fixed in size and that data is written to them in a circular way so that once the collection reaches its max size, new documents over- write the oldest documents. The system.profile collection is allocated 128 KB, thus ensuring that the profile data never consumes much in the way of resources.   You can query system.profile as you would any capped collection. For instance,  you can find all queries that took longer than 150 ms like this:  db.system.profile.find {millis: {$gt: 150}}   Because capped collections maintain natural insertion order, you can use the $natu- ral operator to sort so that the most recent results are displayed first:  db.system.profile.find  .sort {$natural: -1} .limit 5 .pretty    Returning to the query you just issued, you should see an entry in the result set that looks something like this:  {   "op" : "query",   "ns" : "stocks.values",       "query" : {     "query" : { },     "orderby" : {       "close" : -1     }   },   "ntoreturn" : 1,   "ntoskip" : 0,   "nscanned" : 4308303,          "scanAndOrder" : true,   "keyUpdates" : 0,   "numYield" : 3,   "lockStats" : {     "timeLockedMicros" : {       "r" : NumberLong 12868747 ,       "w" : NumberLong 0      },  Name of  collection  Number of scanned  documents  www.it-ebooks.info   220  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization      "timeAcquiringMicros" : {       "r" : NumberLong 1838271 ,       "w" : NumberLong 5      }   },   "nreturned" : 1,               "responseLength" : 194,   "millis" : 11030,             "ts" : ISODate "2013-09-30T06:44:40.988Z" ,   "client" : "127.0.0.1",   "allUsers" : [ ],   "user" : "" }  Number of returned  documents  Response time  in milliseconds  Another expensive query: this one took about 11 seconds! In addition to the time it took to complete, you get all same information about the query that you saw in the MongoDB log’s slow query warning, which is enough to start the deeper investigation that we’ll cover in the next section.   But before moving on, a few more words about profiling strategy are in order:     A good way to use the profiler is to start it with a coarse setting and work down- ward. First ensure that no queries take longer than 100 ms, then move down to 75 ms, and so on.     While the profiler is enabled, you’ll want to put your application through its  paces; this means testing all of your application’s reads and writes.     To be thorough, those reads and writes should be executed under real condi- tions, where the data sizes, query load, and hardware are representative of the application’s production environment.  The query profiler is useful, but to get the most out of it, you need to be methodical. Better  to  be  surprised  with  a  few  slow  queries  in  development  than  in  production, where the remedies are much more costly.    For  reference,  the  following  output  presents  a  profiling  entry  from  MongoDB  v3.0.6:  > db.system.profile.find  .limit 1 .pretty   {     "op" : "query",     "ns" : "products.system.profile",     "query" : {      },     "ntoreturn" : 0,     "ntoskip" : 0,     "nscanned" : 0,     "nscannedObjects" : 0,     "keyUpdates" : 0,     "writeConflicts" : 0,     "numYield" : 0,  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  221      "locks" : {         "Global" : {             "acquireCount" : {                 "r" : NumberLong 2              }         },         "MMAPV1Journal" : {             "acquireCount" : {                 "r" : NumberLong 1              }         },         "Database" : {             "acquireCount" : {                 "r" : NumberLong 1              }         },         "Collection" : {             "acquireCount" : {                 "R" : NumberLong 1              }         }     },     "nreturned" : 0,     "responseLength" : 20,     "millis" : 1,     "execStats" : {         "stage" : "COLLSCAN",         "filter" : {             "$and" : [ ]         },         "nReturned" : 0,         "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,         "works" : 2,         "advanced" : 0,         "needTime" : 1,         "needFetch" : 0,         "saveState" : 0,         "restoreState" : 0,         "isEOF" : 1,         "invalidates" : 0,         "direction" : "forward",         "docsExamined" : 0     },     "ts" : ISODate "2015-09-11T18:52:08.847Z" ,     "client" : "127.0.0.1",     "allUsers" : [ ],     "user" : "" }  8.3.2  Examining slow queries Finding slow queries is easy with MongoDB’s profiler. Discovering why these queries are slow is trickier and may require some detective work. As mentioned, the causes of slow queries are manifold. If you’re lucky, resolving a slow query may be as easy as  www.it-ebooks.info   222  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  adding an index. In more difficult cases, you might have to rearrange indexes, restruc- ture the data model, or upgrade hardware. But you should always look at the simplest case first, and that’s what we’re going to do here.    In  the  simplest  case,  a  lack  of  indexes,  inappropriate  indexes,  or  less-than-ideal queries  will  be  the  root  of  the  problem.  You  can  find  out  for  sure  by  running  an explain on the offending queries. Let’s explore how to do that now. USING AND UNDERSTANDING EXPLAIN    MongoDB’s  explain command provides detailed information about a given query’s path. Let’s dive right in and see what information can be gleaned from running an explain on the last query you ran in the previous section. To run explain from the shell, you only need to attach the explain   method call:  Number  returned  db.values.find {} .sort {close: -1} .limit 1 .explain   {   "cursor" : "BasicCursor",   "isMultiKey" : false,   "n" : 1,                                 "nscannedObjects" : 4308303,   "nscanned" : 4308303,                    "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 4308303,   "nscannedAllPlans" : 4308303,   "scanAndOrder" : true,   "indexOnly" : false,   "nYields" : 4,    "nChunkSkips" : 0,   "millis" : 10927,    "indexBounds" : { },   "server" : "localhost:27017" }  Number  scanned  The millis field indicates that this query takes about 11 seconds,9 and there’s an obvi- ous reason for this. Look at the nscanned value: this shows that the query engine had to scan 4,308,303 documents to fulfill the query. Now, quickly run a count on the val- ues collection:  db.values.count   4308303  The number of documents scanned is the same as the total number of documents in the  collection,  so  you’ve  performed  a  complete  collection  scan.  If  your  query  were expected to return every document in the collection, this wouldn’t be a bad thing. But you’re returning one document, as indicated by the explain value n, so this is prob- lematic. Furthermore, a full collection scan will only get more expensive if more docu- ments are added. Generally speaking, you want the values of n and nscanned to be as  9 If this doesn’t seem like much, consider the case where a user is waiting on a web page to load because of a  database query in the background. In that context, 11 seconds is an eternity.  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  223  close together as possible. When doing a collection scan, this is almost never the case. The cursor field tells you that you’ve been using a BasicCursor, which only confirms that you’re scanning the collection itself and not an index. If you had used an index, the value would’ve been BTreeCursor.   A second datum here further explains the slowness of the query: the scanAndOrder field. This indicator appears when the query optimizer can’t use an index to return a sorted result set. Therefore, in this case, not only does the query engine have to scan the collection, it also has to sort the result set manually.    The  previous  output  from  the  explain   command is from an older MongoDB version.  Here’s  a  sample  output  from  the  explain    command  using  a  MongoDB v3.0.6 server:  > db.inventory.find {} .sort {"quantity": -1} .limit 1 .   explain "executionStats"   {     "queryPlanner" : {         "plannerVersion" : 1,         "namespace" : "tutorial.inventory",         "indexFilterSet" : false,         "parsedQuery" : {             "$and" : [ ]         },         "winningPlan" : {             "stage" : "SORT",             "sortPattern" : {                 "quantity" : -1             },             "limitAmount" : 1,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "COLLSCAN",                 "filter" : {                     "$and" : [ ]                 },                 "direction" : "forward"             }         },         "rejectedPlans" : [ ]     },     "executionStats" : {         "executionSuccess" : true,         "nReturned" : 1,         "executionTimeMillis" : 0,         "totalKeysExamined" : 0,         "totalDocsExamined" : 11,         "executionStages" : {             "stage" : "SORT",             "nReturned" : 1,             "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,             "works" : 16,             "advanced" : 1,             "needTime" : 13,             "needFetch" : 0,  www.it-ebooks.info   224  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization              "saveState" : 0,             "restoreState" : 0,             "isEOF" : 1,             "invalidates" : 0,             "sortPattern" : {                 "quantity" : -1             },             "memUsage" : 72,             "memLimit" : 33554432,             "limitAmount" : 1,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "COLLSCAN",                 "filter" : {                     "$and" : [ ]                 },                 "nReturned" : 11,                 "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,                 "works" : 13,                 "advanced" : 11,                 "needTime" : 1,                 "needFetch" : 0,                 "saveState" : 0,                 "restoreState" : 0,                 "isEOF" : 1,                 "invalidates" : 0,                 "direction" : "forward",                 "docsExamined" : 11             }         }     },     "serverInfo" : {         "host" : "rMacBook.local",         "port" : 27017,         "version" : "3.0.6",         "gitVersion" : "nogitversion"     },     "ok" : 1 }  The explain   command displays more information when used with the execution- Stats option.  ADD AN INDEX AND RETRY The poor performance is unacceptable, but fortunately the fix is simple. All you need to do is build an index on the close field. Go ahead and do that now:  db.values.createIndex {close: 1}   Note that building the index may take a few minutes. Once built, try the query again:  db.values.find {} .sort {close: -1} .limit 1 .explain   {   "cursor" : "BtreeCursor close_1 reverse",    "isMultiKey" : false,   www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  225    "n" : 1,   "nscannedObjects" : 1,   "nscanned" : 1,   "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 1,   "nscannedAllPlans" : 1,   "scanAndOrder" : false,   "indexOnly" : false,   "nYields" : 0,   "nChunkSkips" : 0,   "millis" : 0,   "indexBounds" : {      "name" : [        [         {            "$maxElement" : 1         },         {            "$minElement" : 1         }       ]     ]   },   "server" : "localhost:27017" }   What a difference! The query now takes less than a millisecond to process. You can see from the cursor field that you’re using a BtreeCursor on the index named close_1 and that you’re iterating over the index in reverse order. In the  indexBounds field, you  see  the  special  values  $maxElement  and  $minElement.  These  indicate  that  the query  spans  the  entire  index.  In  this  case,  the  query  optimizer  walks  the  rightmost edge of the B-tree until it reaches the maximum key and then works its way backward. Because you’ve specified a limit of 1, the query is complete once the maxElement is found.  And  of  course,  the  index  keeps  the  entries  in  order,  so  there’s  no  longer  a need for the manual sort indicated by scanAndOrder.    Similarly,  the  MongoDB  v3.0.6  output  shows  the  improvement  in  the  execution  time and the number of documents that where examined:  > db.inventory.find {} .sort {"quantity": - 1} .limit 1 .explain "executionStats"   {     "queryPlanner" : {         "plannerVersion" : 1,         "namespace" : "tutorial.inventory",         "indexFilterSet" : false,         "parsedQuery" : {             "$and" : [ ]         },         "winningPlan" : {             "stage" : "LIMIT",             "limitAmount" : 0,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "FETCH",  www.it-ebooks.info   226  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization                  "inputStage" : {                     "stage" : "IXSCAN",                     "keyPattern" : {                         "quantity" : 1                     },                     "indexName" : "quantity_1",                     "isMultiKey" : false,                     "direction" : "backward",                     "indexBounds" : {                         "quantity" : [                             "[MaxKey, MinKey]"                         ]                     }                 }             }         },         "rejectedPlans" : [ ]     },     "executionStats" : {         "executionSuccess" : true,         "nReturned" : 1,         "executionTimeMillis" : 0,         "totalKeysExamined" : 1,         "totalDocsExamined" : 1,         "executionStages" : {             "stage" : "LIMIT",             "nReturned" : 1,             "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,             "works" : 2,             "advanced" : 1,             "needTime" : 0,             "needFetch" : 0,             "saveState" : 0,             "restoreState" : 0,             "isEOF" : 1,             "invalidates" : 0,             "limitAmount" : 0,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "FETCH",                 "nReturned" : 1,                 "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,                 "works" : 1,                 "advanced" : 1,                 "needTime" : 0,                 "needFetch" : 0,                 "saveState" : 0,                 "restoreState" : 0,                 "isEOF" : 0,                 "invalidates" : 0,                 "docsExamined" : 1,                 "alreadyHasObj" : 0,                 "inputStage" : {                     "stage" : "IXSCAN",                     "nReturned" : 1,                     "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  227                      "works" : 1,                     "advanced" : 1,                     "needTime" : 0,                     "needFetch" : 0,                     "saveState" : 0,                     "restoreState" : 0,                     "isEOF" : 0,                     "invalidates" : 0,                     "keyPattern" : {                         "quantity" : 1                     },                     "indexName" : "quantity_1",                     "isMultiKey" : false,                     "direction" : "backward",                     "indexBounds" : {                         "quantity" : [                             "[MaxKey, MinKey]"                         ]                     },                     "keysExamined" : 1,                     "dupsTested" : 0,                     "dupsDropped" : 0,                     "seenInvalidated" : 0,                     "matchTested" : 0                 }             }         }     },     "serverInfo" : {         "host" : "rMacBook.local",         "port" : 27017,         "version" : "3.0.6",         "gitVersion" : "nogitversion"     },     "ok" : 1 }  The reason for showing the output from both 2.x and 3.0 MongoDB versions is for you to have it as a reference.

But note the difference in the way the index boundaries  are  specified.  Instead  of  the  $maxElement  and  $minElement  keys,  the boundaries are actual values. The lower bound is 500 and the upper bound is effec- tively infinite. These values must share the same class of data type that you’re querying on; you’re querying on a number, which means the index bounds are numeric. If you were to query on a string range instead, the boundaries would be strings.10   As usual, output from a similar query using MongoDB v3.0 will be presented here:  > db.inventory.find {"quantity":{$gt:   150}} .limit 1 .explain "executionStats"   {     "queryPlanner" : {         "plannerVersion" : 1,         "namespace" : "tutorial.inventory",         "indexFilterSet" : false,         "parsedQuery" : {             "quantity" : {                 "$gt" : 150             }         },         "winningPlan" : {             "stage" : "LIMIT",             "limitAmount" : 0,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "FETCH",                 "inputStage" : {                     "stage" : "IXSCAN",                     "keyPattern" : {                         "quantity" : 1                     },                     "indexName" : "quantity_1",                     "isMultiKey" : false,                     "direction" : "forward",  www.it-ebooks.info  10 If this isn’t making any sense, recall that a given index can contain keys of multiple data types.

Opti- mizing a query in MongoDB v2.x usually means making nscanned as small as possible, but every result must be scanned, so nscanned will never be lower than n, the number of results a query returns. In MongoDB v3.0 the nReturned value indicates the number of  documents  a  query  matches  and  returns.  The  value  of  totalDocsExamined  indi- cates the number of documents that MongoDB scanned. Lastly, totalKeysExamined shows the number of index entries that MongoDB scanned. MONGODB’S QUERY OPTIMIZER  The query optimizer is the piece of software that determines which index, if any, will most  efficiently  serve  a  given  query.  To  select  an  ideal  index  for  your  queries,  the query optimizer uses a fairly simple set of rules:  1 Avoid  scanAndOrder.  If  the  query  includes  a  sort,  attempt  to  sort  using  an  2 Satisfy all fields with useful indexing constraints—attempt to use indexes for the  index.  fields in the query selector.  3 If the query implies a range or includes a sort, choose an index where that last  key used can help satisfy the range or sort.  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  231  If all of these conditions can be met for any one index, that index will be considered optimal and will be used. If more than one index qualifies as optimal, one of the opti- mal indexes will be chosen arbitrarily. There’s a lesson here: if you can build optimal indexes for your queries, you make the query optimizer’s job a lot easier. Strive for that if you can.   Let’s look at a query that satisfies an index  and the query optimizer  perfectly. Go back to the stock symbol data set. Now imagine you want to issue the following query, which fetches all of Google’s closing values greater than 200:  db.values.find {stock_symbol: "GOOG", close: {$gt: 200}}   If you use .explain   with this query, you’ll see that n is 730 but nscanned is 5299. The  previously  created  index  on  close  helps,  but  the  optimal  index  for  this  query includes both keys and places the close key last to allow for the range query:  db.values.createIndex {stock_symbol: 1, close: 1}   You’ll see that if you run the query, both keys are used, and the index bounds are as expected:  db.values.find {stock_symbol: "GOOG", close: {$gt: 200}} .explain   {                                                          "cursor" : "BtreeCursor stock_symbol_1_close_1",   "isMultiKey" : false,                              "n" : 730,                                         "nscannedObjects" : 730,                           "nscanned" : 730,                                  "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 730,                   "nscannedAllPlans" : 730,                          "scanAndOrder" : false,                            "indexOnly" : false,                               "nYields" : 0,                                     "nChunkSkips" : 0,                                 "millis" : 2,   "indexBounds" : {     "stock_symbol" : [       [         "GOOG",         "GOOG"       ]     ],     "close" : [       [         200,         1.7976931348623157e+308        ]     ]   },   "server" : "localhost:27017" }  www.it-ebooks.info   232  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  This is the optimal explain output for this query: the values of n and nscanned are the same. But now consider the case where no one index perfectly serves the query. For example, imagine that you don’t have an index on {stock_symbol: 1, close: 1} but instead, you have a separate index on each of those fields. Using the shorthand get- IndexKeys   to list indexes, you’d see this:  db.values.getIndexKeys   [    {      "_id" : 1   },   {     "close" : 1   },    {      "stock_symbol" : 1    }  ]  Because your query includes both the stock_symbol and close keys, there’s no obvi- ous  index  to  use.  This  is  where  the  query  optimizer  comes  in,  and  the  heuristic  is more  straightforward  than  you  might  imagine.  It’s  based  purely  on  the  value  of nscanned. In other words, the optimizer chooses the index that requires scanning the least  number  of  index  entries.  When  the  query  is  first  run,  the  optimizer  creates  a query plan for each index that might efficiently satisfy the query. The optimizer then runs each plan in parallel.11 Usually, the plan that finishes with the lowest value for nscanned is declared the winner; but in rare occasions, the optimizer may select the full collection scan as the winning plan for a given query. The optimizer then halts any long-running plans and saves the winner for future use.   The following output is from MongoDB v3.0 using a much smaller collection:  > db.inventory.find {"quantity": 500,   "type":"toys"} .limit 1 .explain "executionStats"   {     "queryPlanner" : {         "plannerVersion" : 1,         "namespace" : "tutorial.inventory",         "indexFilterSet" : false,         "parsedQuery" : {             "$and" : [                 {                     "quantity" : {                         "$eq" : 500                     }                 },  11 Technically, the plans are interleaved.  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  233                  {                     "type" : {                         "$eq" : "toys"                     }                 }             ]         },         "winningPlan" : {             "stage" : "LIMIT",             "limitAmount" : 0,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "KEEP_MUTATIONS",                 "inputStage" : {                     "stage" : "FETCH",                     "filter" : {                         "type" : {                             "$eq" : "toys"                         }                     },                     "inputStage" : {                         "stage" : "IXSCAN",                         "keyPattern" : {                             "quantity" : 1                         },                         "indexName" : "quantity_1",                         "isMultiKey" : false,                         "direction" : "forward",                         "indexBounds" : {                             "quantity" : [                                 "[500.0, 500.0]"                             ]                         }                     }                 }             }         },         "rejectedPlans" : [ ]     },     "executionStats" : {         "executionSuccess" : true,         "nReturned" : 1,         "executionTimeMillis" : 1,         "totalKeysExamined" : 2,         "totalDocsExamined" : 2,         "executionStages" : {             "stage" : "LIMIT",             "nReturned" : 1,             "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,             "works" : 3,             "advanced" : 1,             "needTime" : 1,             "needFetch" : 0,             "saveState" : 0,             "restoreState" : 0,             "isEOF" : 1,  www.it-ebooks.info   234  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization              "invalidates" : 0,             "limitAmount" : 0,             "inputStage" : {                 "stage" : "KEEP_MUTATIONS",                 "nReturned" : 1,                 "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,                 "works" : 2,                 "advanced" : 1,                 "needTime" : 1,                 "needFetch" : 0,                 "saveState" : 0,                 "restoreState" : 0,                 "isEOF" : 0,                 "invalidates" : 0,                 "inputStage" : {                     "stage" : "FETCH",                     "filter" : {                         "type" : {                             "$eq" : "toys"                         }                     },                     "nReturned" : 1,                     "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,                     "works" : 2,                     "advanced" : 1,                     "needTime" : 1,                     "needFetch" : 0,                     "saveState" : 0,                     "restoreState" : 0,                     "isEOF" : 1,                     "invalidates" : 0,                     "docsExamined" : 2,                     "alreadyHasObj" : 0,                     "inputStage" : {                         "stage" : "IXSCAN",                         "nReturned" : 2,                         "executionTimeMillisEstimate" : 0,                         "works" : 2,                         "advanced" : 2,                         "needTime" : 0,                         "needFetch" : 0,                         "saveState" : 0,                         "restoreState" : 0,                         "isEOF" : 1,                         "invalidates" : 0,                         "keyPattern" : {                             "quantity" : 1                         },                         "indexName" : "quantity_1",                         "isMultiKey" : false,                         "direction" : "forward",                         "indexBounds" : {                             "quantity" : [                                 "[500.0, 500.0]"                             ]  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  235  The  aforementioned  query  examined  two  documents  to  return  the  desired  docu- ment.

This means that the new index helped the process. SHOWING THE QUERY PLANS AND HINT    You can see this process in action by issuing your query and running explain  . First, drop  the  compound  index  on  {stock_symbol:  1,  close:  1}  and  build  separate indexes on each of these keys:  db.values.dropIndex "stock_symbol_1_close_1"  db.values.createIndex {stock_symbol: 1}  db.values.createIndex  {close: 1}   Then  pass  true  to  the  explain    method,  which  will  include  the  list  of  plans  the query optimizer attempts. You can see the output in listing 8.2. When using MongoDB v3.0 the possible modes are queryPlanner, executionStats, and allPlansExecution. For  backwards  compatibility  with  earlier  versions  of cursor.explain  ,  MongoDB v3.0 interprets  true  as  allPlansExecution  and false as queryPlanner.

Lower down, the allPlans key points to a list that includes two addi- tional query plans: one for the index on {close: 1}, and the other a collection scan with a BasicCursor. MongoDB v3.0 calls this list rejectedPlans.   It’s understandable why the optimizer rejects the collection scan, but it might be less clear why the index on {close: 1} doesn’t satisfy. You can use hint   to find out. hint   forces the query optimizer to use a particular index:  query = {stock_symbol: "GOOG", close: {$gt: 200}} db.values.find query .hint {close: 1} .explain   {                                                         "cursor" : "BtreeCursor close_1",                 "isMultiKey" : false,                             "n" : 730,                                        "nscannedObjects" : 5299,                        "nscanned" : 5299,                               "nscannedObjectsAllPlans" : 5299,                "nscannedAllPlans" : 5299,                       "scanAndOrder" : false,                           "indexOnly" : false,                              "nYields" : 0,                                    "nChunkSkips" : 0,                                "millis" : 22,                                    "indexBounds" : {                                   "close" : [                                   [                                       200,                            1.7976931348623157e+308       ]                                   ]                                         },                                                "server" : "localhost:27017"                    }                                                        Look  at  the  value  for  nscanned:  5,299.  This  is  much  greater  than  the  894  entries scanned previously, and the time it takes to complete the query bears this out.   Running the same query using MongoDB v3.0 and interpreting its output is left as  an exercise for the reader. QUERY PLAN CACHE All that’s left to understand is how the query optimizer caches and expires its choice of query plan. After all, you wouldn’t want the optimizer running all those plans in parallel on each query.   When a successful plan is discovered, the query pattern, the value for nscanned, and the index spec are recorded. For the query we’ve been working with, the recorded structure looks something like this:  {    pattern: {     stock_symbol: 'equality',      close: 'bound',  www.it-ebooks.info   Query optimization  241      index: {       stock_symbol: 1     },     nscanned: 894   } }  The query pattern records the kind of match for each key. Here, you’re requesting an exact  match  on  stock_symbol   equality ,  and  a  range  match  on  close   bound .12 Whenever a new query matches this pattern, the index will be used.   But this shouldn’t hold forever, and it doesn’t. The optimizer automatically expires  a plan after any of the following events:    100 writes are made to the collection.     Indexes are added or removed from the collection.    A query using a cached query plan does a lot more work than expected. Here, what qualifies as “a lot more work” is a value for nscanned exceeding the cached nscanned value by at least a factor of 10.  In  the  last  of  these  cases,  the  optimizer  will  immediately  begin  interleaving  other query plans in case a different index proves more efficient. As you spend time optimiz- ing queries, you’ll likely notice several patterns of queries and indexes that work well together. In the next section, we codify some of these patterns.   If you’re running MongoDB v3.0 you can find more information about query plan cache methods at http:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference method js-plan-cache .  Here we present several common query patterns and the indexes to use with them. This section’s goal is to help you plan out how to pair your application’s queries with MongoDB’s indexes. SINGLE-KEY INDEXES To review single-key indexes, recall the index you created for the stock values collec- tion on closing numbers in section 8.3.2, {close: 1}. This index can be used in the following scenarios. EXACT MATCHES An  exact  match.  The  index  is  used  whether  0,  1,  or  many  results  are  returned.  An exact match is used in this query, returning all entries with a closing value of 100:  8.3.3 Query patterns  db.values.find {close: 100}   SORTING A sort on the indexed field. For example:  db.values.find {} .sort {close: 1}   12 In case you’re interested, three kinds of range matches are stored: upper, lower, and upper-and-lower. The  query pattern also includes any sort specification.  www.it-ebooks.info   242  CHAPTER 8 Indexing and query optimization  In the case of a sort with no query selector, you’ll probably want to tack on a limit unless you actually plan to iterate over the entire collection. RANGE QUERIES A range query with or without a sort on the same field. For example, all closing values greater than or equal to 100:  db.values.find {close: {$gte: 100}}   If you add a sort clause on the same key, the optimizer will still be able to use the same index:  db.values.find {close: {$gte: 100}} .sort {close: 1}   COMPOUND-KEY INDEXES Compound-key indexes are a little more complicated, but their uses are analogous to those  of  single-key  indexes.  The  main  thing  to  remember  is  that  a  compound-key index can efficiently serve only a single range or sort per query. Let’s imagine a triple- compound key index, again for stock values, on {close: 1, open: 1, date: 1}. Let’s look at some possible scenarios. EXACT MATCHES An exact match on the first key, the first and second keys, or the first, second, and third keys, in that order:  db.values.find {close: 1}  db.values.find {close: 1, open: 1}  db.values.find {close: 1, open: 1, date: "1985-01-08"}   RANGE MATCHES An  exact  match  on  any  set  of  leftmost  keys   including  none ,  followed  by  either  a range or a sort using the next key to the right. Thus, all the following queries are ideal for the triple-key index:  db.values.find {} .sort {close: 1}  db.values.find {close: {$gt: 1}}  db.values.find {close: 100} .sort {open: 1}  db.values.find {close: 100, open: {$gt: 1}}  db.values.find {close: 1, open: 1.01, date: {$gt: "2005-01-01"}}  db.values.find {close: 1, open: 1.01} .sort {date: 1}   COVERING INDEXES If you’ve never heard of covering indexes, realize from the start that the term is some- thing of a misnomer. A covering index isn’t, as the name would suggest, a kind of index but  rather  a  special  use  of  an  index.  In  particular,  an  index  can  be  said  to  cover  a query if all the data required by the query resides in the index itself. Covered index queries are also known as index-only queries because these queries are served without having to reference the indexed documents themselves. This can result in increased query performance.  www.it-ebooks.info   8.4  Summary  243   Using a covering index in MongoDB is easy. Simply select a set of fields that reside in  a  single  index  and  exclude  the  _id  field   this  field  likely  isn’t  part  of  the  index you’re using . Here’s an example that uses the triple-compound index you created in the previous section:  db.values.find {close: 1}, {open: 1, close: 1, date: 1, _id: 0}   In earlier versions of MongoDB, cursor.explain   returned the indexOnly field to indicate whether the index covered a query and no actual collection data was used to serve the query. In MongoDB v3.0, when an index covers a query, the explain result has an IXSCAN stage that isn’t a descendant of a FETCH stage, and in the execution- Stats, the value of totalDocsExamined is 0.  Summary This chapter is hefty, as indexing is an admittedly rich subject. If some of the ideas are unclear, that’s okay. You should at least come away with a few techniques for examin- ing indexes and avoiding slow queries, and you should know enough to keep learning.    Query  optimization  is  always  application-specific,  but  our  hope  is  that  the  ideas and techniques provided here will help you tune your queries for the better. Empirical approaches are always useful. Make a habit of profiling and explaining your queries. In the process, you’ll continue learning about the hidden corners of the query opti- mizer, and you’ll ensure efficient queries for your application.   As you write your own applications, here are some things to remember:     Indexes are incredibly useful but carry a cost—they make writes slower.    MongoDB  generally  uses  only  one  index  in  a  query,  so  queries  on  multiple  fields require compound indexes to be efficient.    Order matters when you declare compound indexes.   You  should  plan  for,  and  avoid,  expensive  queries.  Use  MongoDB’s  explain command,  its  expensive  query  logs,  and  its  profiler  to  discover  queries  that should be optimized.    MongoDB gives you several commands for building indexes, but these always include  a  cost  and  may  interfere  with  your  application.  This  means  you should optimize your queries and create indexes early, before you have much traffic or data.    Optimize queries by reducing the number of documents scanned. The explain command is immensely useful for discovering what a query is doing; use it as a guide for optimization.  With the complexity involved in indexing and query optimization, plain old experi- mentation may be your best teacher from here on out.  www.it-ebooks.info   Text search  This chapter covers   Why text search is important   Text search basics   Defining MongoDB text search indexes   Using text search with MongoDB find     Using MongoDB text search with aggregation   Using text search with different languages  In chapters 5 and 6, which explored constructing queries and using aggregation, you learned how to perform database queries using a fairly sophisticated query language.  For  many  applications,  searches  using  these  types  of  queries  may  be sufficient. But when you’re dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, or trying to support users finding the product they want to buy from a huge catalog of possible products, this type of searching may not be enough. Website visitors who  have  become  accustomed  to  using  Google  or  Amazon  for  searches  expect much  more  and  have  come  to  rely  increasingly  on  more  sophisticated  search technology.    In this chapter you’ll see how MongoDB can provide some of the capabilities that more sophisticated text search engines provide—much more than the queries  244  www.it-ebooks.info   Text searches—not just pattern matching  245  you’ve seen so far. These additional capabilities include indexing for fast word searches, matching exact phrases, excluding documents with certain words or phrases, sup- porting  multiple  languages,  and  scoring  search  result  documents  based  on  how well they match a search string. Although MongoDB text search isn’t intended to replace dedicated search engines, it may provide enough capabilities that you won’t need one.    Let’s look at the various types of search capabilities dedicated search engines pro- vide. In section 9.1.3 you’ll see the subset of those capabilities provided by MongoDB.  If you’ve got it, why not use it? On a LinkedIn MongoDB group discussion, someone asked what the benefit was to using MongoDB text search versus a dedicated search engine such as Elasticsearch. Here’s the reply from Kelly Stirman, director of Products at MongoDB:  “In  general  Elasticsearch  has  a  much  richer  set  of  features  than  MongoDB.  This makes sense—it is a dedicated search engine. Where MongoDB text search makes sense is for very basic search requirements. If you’re already storing your data in MongoDB, text indexes add some overhead to your deployment, but in general it is far simpler than deploying MongoDB and Elasticsearch side by side.”  NOTE You  can  read  more  about  Elasticsearch  in  Elasticsearch  in  Action  by Radu Gheorghe et al  Manning Publications, 2015 . You can also read a book on  another  popular  dedicated  search  engine  also  built  on  top  of  Apache Lucene: Solr in Action, by Trey Grainger and Timothy Potter  Manning Publi- cations, 2014 .  9.1  Text searches—not just pattern matching You probably perform some type of search on a daily basis, if not many times every day. As a programmer, you may search the internet for help dealing with particularly vexing programming  bugs.  You  may  then  go  home at  night  and  search  Amazon  or  another website for products; you may have even used the custom search on Manning.com, sup- ported by Google, to find this book.    If you go to Manning.com, you’ll see a “Search manning.com” text search box in the upper-right corner of the site. Type a keyword, such as “java,” into the text box and click the Search button; you’ll see something like the display shown in figure 9.1.   Note that since the search is run against live data, your exact results may vary. Per- haps the book Java 8 in Action, newly published at the time this chapter was written, will be replaced with Java 9, 10, or even 11.  www.it-ebooks.info   246  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Figure 9.1 Search results from search for term “java” at www.manning.com  The point of this search is to illustrate a couple of important features that text search engines provide that you may take for granted:     The search has performed a case-insensitive search, meaning that no matter how you capitalize the letters in your search term, even using “jAVA” instead of “Java” or “java,” you’ll see results for “Java” or any uppercase, lowercase combination spelling of the word.    You won’t see any results for “JavaScript,” even though books on JavaScript con- tain  the  text  string  “Java.”  This  is  because  the  search  engine  recognizes  that there’s a difference between the words “Java” and “JavaScript.”  As you may know, you could perform this type of search in MongoDB using a regular expression, specifying whole word matches only and case-insensitive matches. But in MongoDB, such pattern-matching searches can be slow when used on large collections if they can’t take advantage of indexes, something text search engines routinely do to sift through large amounts of data. Even those complex MongoDB searches won’t pro- vide the capabilities of a true text search.    Let’s illustrate that using another example.  9.1.1  Text searches vs. pattern matching Now try a second search on Manning.com; this time use the search term “script.” You should see something similar to the results shown in figure 9.2.   Notice that in this case the results will include results for books that contain the word “scripting” as well as the word “script,” but not the word “JavaScript.” This is due  www.it-ebooks.info   Text searches—not just pattern matching  247  Figure 9.2 Results from searching for term “script” on www.manning.com  to the ability of search engines to perform what’s known as stemming, where words in both the text being searched, as well as the search terms you entered, are converted to the “stem” or root word from which “scripting” is derived—“script” in this case. This is where search engines have to understand the language in which they’re storing and searching in order to understand that “script” could refer to “scripts,” “scripted,” or “scripting,” but not “JavaScript.”    Although web page searches use many of the same text search capabilities, they also provide additional searching capabilities. Let’s see what those search capabilities are as well as how they might help or hinder your user.  9.1.2  Text searches vs. web page searches  Web page search engines contain many of the same search capabilities as a dedicated text search engine and usually much more. Web page searches are focused on search- ing a network of web pages. This can be an advantage when you’re trying to search the World Wide Web, but it may be overkill or even a disadvantage when you’re trying to search a product catalog. This ability to search based on relationships between docu- ments isn’t something you’ll find in dedicated text search engines, nor will you find it in MongoDB, even with the new text search capabilities.    One  of  the  original  search  algorithms  used  by  Google  was  referred  to  as  “Page Rank,” a play on words, because not only was it intended to rank web pages, but it was developed by the co-founder of Google, Larry Page. Page Rank rates the importance, or weight, of a page based on the importance of pages that link to it. Figure 9.3, based  www.it-ebooks.info   248  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Page B has many lower-ranking pages linking to it, as well as a high-ranking page with only one link, page C.  Page C has only one page linking to it, but it’s from a high-ranking page with only one link, page B.  A  3.3%  D  3.9%  1.6%  B  3.8.4%  C  34.3%  F  3.9%  Page E has lots of links to it, but from relatively low-ranking pages.  E  8.1%  1.6%  1.6%  1.6%  1.6%  Figure 9.3 Page ranking based on importance of pages linking to a page  on the Wikipedia entry for Page Rank, http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki PageRank, illus- trates this algorithm.   As you can see in figure 9.3, page C is almost as important as B because it has a very important page pointing to it: page B. The algorithm, which is still taught in university courses on data mining, also takes into account the number of outgoing links a page has. In this case, not only is B very important, but it also has only one outgoing link, making that one link even more critical. Note also that page E has lot of  links  to  it,  but  they’re  all  from  relatively  low-ranking  pages,  so  page  E  doesn’t have a high rating.   Google today uses many algorithms to weight pages, over 200 by some counts, mak- ing it a full-featured web search engine. But keep in mind that web page searching isn’t the same as the type of search you might want to use when searching a catalog. Web page searches will access the web pages you generate from your database, but not the database itself. For example, look again at the page that searched for “java,” shown in figure 9.4. You’ll see that the first result isn’t a product at all—it’s the list of Man- ning books on Java.   www.it-ebooks.info   Text searches—not just pattern matching  249  Figure 9.4 Searching results in more than just books.  Perhaps having a list of Java books as the first result might not be so bad, but because the Google search doesn’t have the concept of a book, if you search for “javascript,” you don’t have to scroll down very far before you’ll see a web page for errata for a book already in the list. This is illustrated in figure 9.5. This type of “noise” can be dis- tracting if what you’re looking for is a book on JavaScript. It can also require you to scroll down further than you might otherwise have to.  Secrets of JavaScript Ninja book  Secrets of Errata for JavaScript Ninja book  Figure 9.5 A search showing how a book can appear more than once  Although web page search engines are great at searching a large network of pages and ranking results based on how the pages are related, they aren’t intended to solve the problem  of  searching  a  database  such  as  a  product  database.  To  solve  this  type  of problem, you can look to full-featured text search engines that can search a product database, such as the one you’d expect to find on Amazon.  www.it-ebooks.info   250  CHAPTER 9 Text search  9.1.3 MongoDB text search vs. dedicated text search engines  Dedicated text search engines can go beyond indexing web pages to indexing extremely large databases. Text search engines can provide capabilities such as spelling correc- tion, suggestions as to what you’re looking for, and relevancy measures—things many web search engines can do as well. But dedicated search engines can provide further improvements such as facets, custom synonym libraries, custom stemming algorithms, and custom stop word dictionaries.   Facets? Synonym libraries? Custom stemming? Stop word dictionaries? If  you’ve  never  looked  into  dedicated  search  engines,  you  might  wonder  what  all these terms mean. In brief: facets allow you to group together products by a particular characteristic, such as the “Laptop Computer” category shown on the left side of the page in figure 9.6. Synonym libraries allow you to specify different words that have the same meaning. For example, if you search for “intelligent” you might also want to see results for “bright” and “smart.” As previously covered in section 9.1.1, stem- ming allows you to find different forms of a word, such as “scripting” and “script.” Stop words are common words that are filtered out prior to searching, such as “the,” “a,” and “and.”  We won’t cover these terms in great depth, but if you want to find out more about them you can read a book on dedicated search engines such as Solr in Action or Elas- ticsearch in Action.  Faceted search is something that you’ll see almost any time you shop on a modern large  e-commerce  website,  where  results  will  be  grouped  by  certain  categories  that allow the user to further explore. For example, if you go to the Amazon website and search using the term “apple” you’ll see something like the page in figure 9.6.   On the left side of the web page, you’ll see a list of different groupings you might find  for  Apple-related  products  and  accessories.  These  are  the  results  of  a  faceted search. Although we did provide similar capabilities in our e-commerce data model using categories and tags, facets make it easy and efficient to turn almost any field into a type of category. In addition, facets can go beyond groupings based on the different values in a field. For example, in figure 9.6 you see groupings based on weight ranges instead of exact weight. This approach allows you to narrow the search based on the weight range you want, something that’s important if you’re searching for a portable computer.    Facets  allow  the  user  to  easily  drill  down  into  the  results  to  help  narrow  their search results based on different criteria of interest to them. Facets in general are a tremendous aid to help you find what you’re looking for, especially in a product data- base as large as Amazon, which sells more than 200 million products. This is where a faceted search becomes almost a necessity.  www.it-ebooks.info   Text searches—not just pattern matching  251  Show results for different “facets” based on department.

BENEFITS Unfortunately, many of the capabilities available in a full-blown text search engine are beyond the capabilities of MongoDB. But there’s good news: MongoDB can still pro- vide you with about 80% of what you might want in a catalog search, with less com- plexity  and  effort  than  is  needed  to  establish  a  full-blown  text  search  engine  with faceted search and suggestive terms. What does MongoDB give you?     Automatic real-time indexing with stemming   Optional assignable weights by field name   Multilanguage support   Stop word removal   Exact phrase or word matches   The ability to exclude results with a given phrase or word  NOTE Unlike  more  full-featured  text  search  engines,  MongoDB  doesn’t allow you to edit the list of stop words. There’s a request to add this: https:   jira.mongodb.org browse SERVER-10062.  www.it-ebooks.info   252  CHAPTER 9 Text search  All these capabilities are available for the price of defining an index, which then gives you access to some decent word-search capabilities without having to copy your entire database to a dedicated search engine. This approach also avoids the additional admin- istrative  and  management  overhead  that  would  go  along  with  a  dedicated  search engine. Not a bad trade-off if MongoDB gives you enough of the capabilities you need.   Now let’s see the details of how MongoDB provides this support. It’s pretty simple:    First, you define the indexes needed for text searching.    Then,  you’ll  use  text  search  in  both  the  basic  queries  as  well  as  aggregation  framework.   One  more  critical  component  you’ll  need  is  MongoDB  2.6  or  later.  MongoDB  2.4 introduced text search in an experimental stage, but it wasn’t until MongoDB 2.6 that text search became available by default and text search–related functions became fully integrated with the find   and aggregate   functions.  What you’ll need to know to use text searching in MongoDB Although it will help to fully understand chapter 8 on indexing, the text search indexes are fairly easy to understand. If you want to use text search for basic queries or the aggregation framework, you’ll have to be familiar with the related material in chapter 5, which covers how to perform basic queries, and chapter 6, which covers how to use the aggregation framework.   MONGODB TEXT SEARCH: A SIMPLE EXAMPLE Before taking a detailed look at how MongoDB’s text search works, let’s explore an example using the e-commerce data. The first thing you’ll need to do is define an index; you’ll begin by specifying the fields that you want to index. We’ll cover the details of using text indexes in section 9.3, but here’s a simple example using the e-commerce products collection:   db.products.createIndex                 {name: 'text',                description: 'text',         tags: 'text'}           ;  Index name field  Index description  field  Index tags field  This index specifies that the text from three fields in the products collection will be searched: name, description, and tags. Now let’s see a search example that looks for gardens in the products collection:   > db.products     .find {$text: {$search: 'gardens'}},                  {_id:0, name:1,description:1,tags:1}      .pretty    Search for text  field gardens  www.it-ebooks.info   Manning book catalog data download  253  {     "name" : "Rubberized Work Glove, Black",     "description" : "Black Rubberized Work Gloves...",     "tags" : [         "gardening"          ] } {     "name" : "Extra Large Wheel Barrow",     "description" : "Heavy duty wheel barrow...",     "tags" : [         "tools",         "gardening",               "soil"     ] }  gardening  matches search  gardening  matches search  Even this simple query illustrates a few key aspects of MongoDB text search and how it differs from normal text search. In this example, the search for gardens has resulted in a search for the stemmed word garden. That in turn has found two products with the tag gardening, which has been stemmed and indexed under garden.    In the next few sections, you’ll learn much more about how MongoDB text search works. But first let’s download a larger set of data to use for the remaining examples in this chapter.  9.2 Manning book catalog data download  Our e-commerce data has been fine for the examples shown so far in the book. For this chapter, though, we’re going to introduce a larger set of data with much more text in order to better illustrate the use of MongoDB text search and its strengths as well as limitations. This data set will contain a snapshot of the Manning book catalog created at the time this chapter was written. If you want to follow along and run exam- ples yourself, you can download the data to your local MongoDB database by following these steps:     In the source code included with this book, find the chapter9 folder, and copy the  file  catalog.books.json  from  that  folder  to  a  convenient  location  on  your computer.    Run the command shown here. You may have to change the command to prefix the  filename,  catalog.books.json,  with  the  name  of  the  directory  where  you saved the file.   mongoimport --db catalog --collection books --type json --drop  ➥  --file catalog.books.json   You should see something similar to the results shown in the following listing. Please note that the findOne   function returns a randomly selected document.  www.it-ebooks.info   254  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Listing 9.1 Loading sample data in the books collections  Switch to catalog  database  Show a randomly selected  book from catalog  > use catalog                          switched to db catalog > db.books.findOne            {         "_id" : 1, nerat        "title" : "Unlocking Android",         "isbn" : "1933988673",         "pageCount" : 416,         "publishedDate" : ISODate "2009-04-01T07:00:00Z" ,         "thumbnailUrl" : "https:  s3.amazonaws.com AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ .book-thumb-images ableson.jpg",         "shortDescription" : "Unlocking Android: A Developer's Guide  provides concise, hands-on instruction for the Android operating system and development tools.

For each document you’ll have the following:    title—A text field with the book title   isbn—International Standard Book Number  ISBN    pageCount—The number of pages in the book    publishedDate—The  date  on  which  the  book  was  published   only  present  if  the status field is PUBLISH     thumbnailUrl—The URL of the thumbnail for the book cover   shortDescription—A short description of the book   longDescription—A long description of the book   status—The status of the book, either PUBLISH or MEAP   authors—The array of author names   categories—The array of book categories  Now that you have the list of books loaded, let’s create a text index for it.  www.it-ebooks.info   Defining text search indexes  255  9.3  Defining text search indexes Text indexes are similar to the indexes you saw in section 7.2.2, which covered creat- ing and deleting indexes. One important difference between the regular indexes you saw there and text indexes is that you can have only a single text index for a given col- lection. The following is a sample text index definition for the books collection:   db.books.createIndex                 {title: 'text',                      shortDescription: 'text',      longDescription: 'text',      authors: 'text',      categories: 'text'},      {weights:                             {title: 10,          shortDescription: 1,          longDescription:1,          authors: 1,          categories: 5}      }  ;  Specify fields to  be text-indexed.  Optionally  specify weights  for each field.  There are a few other important differences between the regular indexes covered in section 7.2.2 and text indexes:      Instead of specifying a 1 or –1 after the field being indexed, you use text.    You can specify as many fields as you want to become part of the text index and  all the fields will be searched together as if they were a single field.    You can have only one text search index per collection, but it can index as many  fields as you like.  Don’t worry yet about weights assigned to the fields. The weights allow you to specify how important a field is to scoring the search results. We’ll discuss that further and show how they’re used when we explore text search scoring in section 9.4.2.  9.3.1  Text index size  An index entry is created for each unique, post-stemmed word in the document. As you might imagine, text search indexes tend to be large. To reduce the number of index  entries,  some  words   called  stop  words   are  ignored.  As  we  discussed  earlier when  we  talked  about  faceted  searches,  stop  words  are  words  that  aren’t  generally searched for. In English this include words such as “the,” “an,” “a,” and “and.” Trying to perform a search for a stop word would be pretty useless because it would return almost every document in your collection.   The next listing shows the results of a stats   command on our books collection. The stats   command shows you the size of the books collection, along with the size of indexes on the collection.   www.it-ebooks.info   256  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Listing 9.2 books collection statistics showing space use and index name  > db.books.stats   {         "ns" : "catalog.books",         "count" : 431,         "size" : 772368,                 "avgObjSize" : 1792,         "storageSize" : 2793472,         "numExtents" : 5,         "nindexes" : 2,         "lastExtentSize" : 2097152,         "paddingFactor" : 1,         "systemFlags" : 0,         "userFlags" : 1,         "totalIndexSize" : 858480,         "indexSizes" : {                 "_id_" : 24528,  Size of books  collection  "title_text_shortDescription_text_longDescription_text_authors_text _categories_text" : 833952                 },         "ok" : 1 }  Name and size of  text search index  Notice that the size of the books collection  size in listing 9.2  is 772,368. Looking at the  indexSizes  field  in  the  listing,  you’ll  see  the  name  and  size  of  the  text  search index. Note that the size of the text search index is 833,952—larger than the books collection itself! This might startle or concern you at first, but remember the index must contain an index entry for each unique stemmed word being indexed for the document,  as  well  as  a  pointer  to  the  document  being  indexed.  Even  though  you remove stop words, you’ll still have to duplicate most of the text being indexed as well as add a pointer to the original document for each word.   Another important point to take note of is the length of the index name:  "title_text_shortDescription_text_longDescription_text_authors_text _categories_text."  MongoDB namespaces have a maximum length of 123 bytes. If you index a few more text fields, you can see how you might easily exceed the 123-byte limit. Let’s see how you can assign an index a user-defined name to avoid this problem. We’ll also show you a simpler way to specify that you want to index all text fields in a collection.  9.3.2  Assigning an index name and indexing all text fields  in a collection In MongoDB a namespace is the name of an object concatenated with the name of the database and collection, with a dot between the three names. Namespaces can have a maximum length of 123 bytes. In the previous example, you’re already up to 84 char- acters for the namespace for the index.   www.it-ebooks.info   Basic text search  257    There  are  a  couple  of  ways  to  avoid  this  problem.  First,  as  with  all  MongoDB  indexes, you have the option of specifying the name of the index, as shown here:  db.books.createIndex                 {title: 'text',                     shortDescription: 'text',      longDescription: 'text',      authors: 'text',      categories: 'text'},      {weights:                           {title: 10,             categories: 5},       name : 'books_text_index'        }  ;  Specify weights for  fields with weights  other than 1.  User-defined  index name  This example also specifies weights for title and categories, but all other fields will default to a weight of 1. You’ll find out more about how weights affect the sorting of your search results in section 9.4.3 when we cover sorting by text search score.   Please note that if an index already exists, you won’t be able to create it again even if  you’re  using  a  different  name   the  error  message  will  be  "all  indexes  already exist" . In that case, you’ll first need to drop it using dropIndex   and then recreate it with the desired name. WILDCARD FIELD NAME Text search indexes also have a special wildcard field name: $**. This name specifies that you want to index any field that contains a string. For text indexes with the wild- card specification, the default index name is $**_text, thus enabling you to avoid the namespace 123-byte limit problem:    db.books.createIndex                 {'$**': 'text'},           {weights:         {title: 10,                categories: 5},  ;  Index all fields  with strings.  You can also include other fields in the text index to create a compound index, but there are some restrictions on how you can search a compound text index. You can read more about this and other details of the text index at http:  docs.mongodb.org  manual core index-text .   Now that you have a text index, let’s see how to use it for searching.  9.4  Basic text search Let’s start with an example of a simple MongoDB text search:  db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'actions'}},{title:1}   www.it-ebooks.info   258  CHAPTER 9 Text search  This query looks much like the queries covered in chapter 5 using the find   com- mand. The $text operator defines the query as a text search. The $search parameter then defines the string you want to use for the search. This query would return these results or something similar as results are returned in a random order:   { "_id" : 256, "title" : "Machine Learning in Action" } { "_id" : 146, "title" : "Distributed Agile in Action" } { "_id" : 233, "title" : "PostGIS in Action" } { "_id" : 17, "title" : "MongoDB in Action" } …  Even for this simple query there’s quite a bit going on under the covers:     The word actions was stemmed to action.    MongoDB then used an index to quickly find all documents with the stemmed  word action.   Although not noticeable on our relatively small collection, you can see how using an index to find the documents instead of scanning all the text fields for all the docu- ments in the collection can be much faster even for modest-sized collections.    Next, try a more complex search, one using a phrase with more than one word:   db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'MongoDB in Action'}},{title:1}   So far the results will appear the same as for the previous example:  { "_id" : 256, "title" : "Machine Learning in Action" } { "_id" : 146, "title" : "Distributed Agile in Action" } { "_id" : 233, "title" : "PostGIS in Action" } { "_id" : 17, "title" : "MongoDB in Action" } …  For  this  query,  the  search  string  is  split  into  words,  stop  words  are  removed,  the remaining words are stemmed, and MongoDB then uses the text index to perform a case-insensitive compare. This is illustrated in figure 9.7.   In the figure, there’s only one stop word, in, and the stemmed versions of each word are the same as the original word. MongoDB will next use the results to perform a case-insensitive search using the text index twice: once to search for mongodb, and then again to search for action. The results will be any documents that contain either of the two words, the equivalent of an or search.   “MongoDB in Action”  MongoDB in Action  MongoDB  Action  MongoDB  Action  Parse string into words  Remove stop words  Stem words  Figure 9.7 Text search string processing  www.it-ebooks.info   Basic text search  259  Now  that  you’ve  seen  the  basics  of  simple  text  searching,  let’s  move  on  to  more advanced searches.  9.4.1 More complex searches  In addition to searching for any of a number of words, the equivalent of an or search, MongoDB search allows you to do the following:     Specify and word matches instead of or word matches.   Perform exact phrase matches.   Exclude documents with certain words.   Exclude documents with certain phrases.   Let’s start by seeing how to specify that a given word must be in the result document. You’ve already seen a search for mongodb in action, which returned not only books on MongoDB, but also any book with the word action. If you enclose a word in double quotes within the search string, it specifies that the word must always be in the result document. Here’s an example:  db.books.     find {$text: {$search: ' "mongodb" in action'}}      “mongodb” in double  quotes means the  word must be present.  This query returns only the books with titles that include the word mongodb:  { "title" : "MongoDB in Action"} { "title" : "MongoDB in Action, Second Edition" }  EXACT MATCH ON PHRASES Using double quotes also works for phrases, so if you specify the phrase second edition, only the second edition book is shown because multiple phrases make it an “and” search:  > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: ' "mongodb" "second edition" '}},   ...     {_id:0, title:1}  { "title" : "MongoDB in Action, Second Edition" }  Phrase “second edition” required as well as the word “mongodb”  Although  the  exact  match  logic  will  perform  a  case-insensitive  compare,  it  won’t remove stop words, nor will it stem the search terms. You can illustrate this by search- ing using the search string 'books' with and without double quotes:  > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: ' books '}} .    ...     count   414 > > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: ' "books" '}} .  ...     count   21  Stemmed version of  word “books”—414  Exact word  “books”—21  www.it-ebooks.info   260  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Here  you  can  see  that  when  you  specified  the  word  books  without  double  quotes, MongoDB stemmed the word and could find 414 results. When you specify the exact match, using double quotes around the word books, MongoDB returned only the count of  documents  that  contained  the  exact  word  books,  21  documents  in  all.  The  total number of results you will get may vary depending on the input data. EXCLUDING DOCUMENTS WITH SPECIFIC WORDS OR PHRASES To exclude all documents that contain a word, put a minus sign in front of the word. For example, if you wanted all books with the word MongoDB but not those with the word second you could use the following:  > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: ' mongodb -second '}},    ...     {_id:0, title:1 }  { "title" : "MongoDB in Action" }  Exclude documents  with the word  “second.”  Note that the three dots on the second and the third lines are automatically added by the mongo shell to show that the input is longer than one line—in this case it’s three lines long.    Similarly,  you  can  exclude  documents  with  a  particular  phrase  by  enclosing  the  phrase in double quotes and preceding it with a minus sign:  > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: ' mongodb -"second edition" '}},    ...     {_id:0, title:1}  { "title" : "MongoDB in Action" }  Exclude  documents  with the phrase  “second edition.”  MORE COMPLEX SEARCH SPECIFICATIONS You  can  combine  the  text  search  with  most  other  find    search  criteria  to  further limit your search. For example, if you wanted to search for all Java books that still have a status of MEAP, you could use this:  > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: ' mongodb '}, status: 'MEAP' },   ...     {_id:0, title:1, status:1}  { "title" : "MongoDB in Action, Second Edition",   "status" : "MEAP"}  status must  be MEAP  Limits on combining text search criteria There are a few limits as to what you can combine with a text search and how text indexes  are  limited.  These  limits  are  further  defined  at  http:  docs.mongodb.org  manual core index-text  under restrictions. A few key limits include the following:    Multikey compound indexes aren’t allowed.   Geospatial compound key indexes aren’t allowed.   hint   cannot be used if a query includes a $text query expression.   Sort operations cannot obtain sort order from a text field index.  www.it-ebooks.info   Basic text search  261  If you add more stop words, such as the, and change the search terms to use non- stemmed words, you’ll see the same results. This doesn’t prove that the stop words are  in  fact  ignored  or  that  the  nonstemmed  word  is  treated  the  same  as  the stemmed word.    To prove that, you’ll have to look at the text search score to confirm that you’re receiving the same score regardless of extra stop words or different words with the same  stem.  Let’s  see  what  the  text  search  score  is  and  how  you  can  include  it  in your results.  9.4.2  Text search scores  The  text  search  score  provides  a  number  that  rates  the  relevancy  of  the  document based on how many times the word appeared in the document. The scoring also uses any weights assigned to different fields when the index was created, as described in section 9.3.    To show the text search score, you use a projection field such as score: { $meta: "textScore"  }  in  your  find    command.  Note  that  the  name  you  assign  the  text score—score  in  this  case—can  be  any  name  you  want.  The  next  listing  shows  an example of the same search shown earlier but with the text score displayed, followed by the search with a slightly different but equivalent search string. Please note that the output you’re going to get may be different from the one presented here.  Listing 9.3 Displaying text search score  Search for “Mongodb  in Action.”  Include text search  score in results.  > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: 'mongodb in action'}},    ...     {_id:0, title:1, score: { $meta: "textScore" }} .     ...     limit 4 ; { "title" : "Machine Learning in Action", "score" : 16.83933933933934 } { "title" : "Distributed Agile in Action", "score" : 19.371088861076345 } { "title" : "PostGIS in Action", "score" : 17.67825896762905 }     { "title" : "MongoDB in Action", "score" : 49.48653394500073 } > > > db.books. ...     find {$text: {$search: 'the mongodb and actions in it'}},   ...     {_id:0, title:1, score: { $meta: "textScore" }} . ...     limit 4 ; { "title" : "Machine Learning in Action", "score" : 16.83933933933934 } { "title" : "Distributed Agile in Action", "score" : 19.371088861076345 } { "title" : "PostGIS in Action", "score" : 17.67825896762905 }       { "title" : "MongoDB in Action", "score" : 49.48653394500073 }  Text search  scores for first  search string  Second string text scores— identical to first set of scores  Second text string with extra stop words and plural word “actions”  www.it-ebooks.info   262  CHAPTER 9 Text search  In this listing, the search string  "MongoDB  in  Action" is changed to  "the  mongodb and actions in it." This new search string uses the plural form of action, and also adds a number of stop words. As you can see, the text scores are identical in both cases,  illustrating  that  the  stop  words  are  in  fact  ignored  and  that  the  remaining words are stemmed. WEIGHT FIELD TO INFLUENCE WORD IMPORTANCE In  the  index  created  in  section  9.3.2,  you’ll  notice  the  definition  of  a  field  called weights. Weights influence the importance of words found in a particular field, com- pared to the same word found in other fields. The default weight for a field is 1, but as you can see, we’ve assigned a weight of 5 to the categories field and a weight of 10 to the title field. This means that a word found in categories carries five times the weight of the same word found in the short or long description fields. Similarly, a word found in the title field will carry 10 times the weight of the same word found in one of the description fields and twice the weight of the same word found in categories. This will affect the score assigned to a document:  db.books.createIndex       {'$**': 'text'},            {weights:         {title: 10,               categories: 5}     }  ;  Specify weights for  fields with weights  other than 1.  This search is fine if you want to find all the books with the words mongodb or action. But for most searches, you also want to view the most relevant results first. Let’s see how to do that.   9.4.3  Sorting results by text search score To sort the results by relevancy, sort by the same text search score shown in the previ- ous example. In fact, to sort by the text search score, you must also include the $meta function in your find   projection specification. Here’s an example:  db.books.     find {$text: {$search: 'mongodb in action'}},          {title:1, score: { $meta: "textScore" }} .        sort { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }          Projection for  text score  Sort by text score.  This example will result in a list sorted by the text score:  { "_id" : 17, "title" : "MongoDB in Action", "score" : 49.48653394500073 } { "_id" : 186, "title" : "Hadoop in Action", "score" : 24.99910329985653 } { "_id" : 560, "title" : "HTML5 in Action", "score" : 23.02156177156177 }  www.it-ebooks.info   Aggregation framework text search  263  As mentioned earlier, you can name the text search score anything you want. We’ve named it score in our examples, but you may choose something like textSearchScore. But keep in mind that the name specified in the sort   function must be the same as the name specified in the preceding find   function. In addition, you can’t specify the order  ascending or descending  for the sort by text sort field. The sort is always from highest score to lowest score, which makes sense, because you normally want the most relevant results first. If for some reason you do need to sort with least relevant results first, you can use the aggregation framework text search  which is covered in the next section .   Now that you’ve seen how to use the text search with the find   command, let’s  see how you can also use it in the aggregation framework.  The projection field $meta:"textScore" As you learned in chapter 5, section 5.1.2, you use a projection to limit the fields returned from the find   function. But if you specify any fields in the find projection, only those fields specified will be returned.   You can only sort by the text search score if you include the text search meta score results in your projection. Does this mean you must always specify all the fields you want returned if you sort by the text search score?   Luckily, no. If you specify only the meta text score in your find projection, all the other fields in your document will also be returned, along with the text search meta score.  9.5  Aggregation framework text search As you learned in chapter 6, by using the aggregation framework, you can transform and combine data from multiple documents to generate new information not avail- able in any single document. In this section you’ll learn how to use the text search capabilities within the aggregation framework. As you’ll see, the aggregation frame- work provides all the text search capabilities you saw for the find   command and a bit more.     In  section  9.4.3,  you  saw  a  simple  example  in  which  you  found  books  with  the  words mongodb in action and then sorted the results by the text score:  db.books.     find {$text: {$search: 'mongodb in action'}},             {title:1, score: { $meta: "textScore" }} .       sort { score: { $meta: "textScore" } }     Search for documents  with the words  mongodb or action.  Projection for  text score  Sort by  text score.  www.it-ebooks.info   264  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Using the aggregation framework, you can produce the same results using the follow- ing code:  db.books.aggregate     [      { $match: { $text: { $search: 'mongodb in action' } } },       { $sort: { score: { $meta: 'textScore' } } },                    { $project: { title: 1, score: { $meta: 'textScore' } } }      ]    Projection for text score  Search for documents  with the words  mongodb or action.  Sort by  text score.  As expected, this code will produce the same results you saw in the previous section:  { "_id" : 17, "title" : "MongoDB in Action", "score" : 49.48653394500073 } { "_id" : 186, "title" : "Hadoop in Action", "score" : 24.99910329985653 } { "_id" : 560, "title" : "HTML5 in Action", "score" : 23.02156177156177 } { "_id" : 197, "title" : "Erlang and OTP in Action", "score" :  22.069632021922096 }  Notice  that  the  two  versions  of  the  text  search  use  many  of  the  same  constructs  to specify the find match criteria, the projection attributes, and the sort criteria. But as we  promised,  the  aggregation  framework  can  do  even  more.  For  example,  you  can take the previous example and by swapping the $sort and $project operators, sim- plify the $sort operator a bit:  db.books.aggregate      [         { $match: { $text: { $search: 'mongodb in action' } } },         { $project: { title: 1, score: { $meta: 'textScore' } } },         { $sort: { score: -1 } }                                   ]    Sort by  descending  score.  One big difference in the second aggregation example is that, unlike with the find   function,  you  can  now  reference  the  score  attribute  you  defined  in  the  preceding $project operation. Notice, though, that you’re sorting the scores in descending order, and therefore you’re using score: -1 instead of score: 1. But this does provide the option of showing lowest scoring books first if desired by using score: 1.   Using the $text search in the aggregation framework has some limitations:    The $match operator using $text function search must be the first operation in  the pipeline and must precede any other references to $meta:'textScore'.    The $text function can appear only once in the pipeline.   The $text function can’t be used with $or or $not.  www.it-ebooks.info   9.5.1 Where’s MongoDB in Action, Second Edition?  Aggregation framework text search  265  With the $match text search string, use the same format you would with the find   command:     If a word or phrase is enclosed in double quotes, the document must contain an exact match of the word or phrase.    A word or phrase preceded by a minus sign  –  excludes documents with that  word or phrase.  In the next section, you’ll learn how to use the ability to access the text score to fur- ther customize the search.  If  you  look  closely  at  the  results  from  our  previous  text  searches  using  the  string "MongoDB in Action", you may have wondered why the results didn’t include the sec- ond edition of MongoDB in Action as well as the first edition. To find out why, use the same search string but enclose monogdb in double quotes so that you find only those documents that have the word mongodb in them:   > db.books.aggregate  ...     [ ...         { $match: { $text: { $search: ' "mongodb" in action ' } } }, ...         { $project: {_id:0, title: 1, score: { $meta: 'textScore' } } } ...     ] ...   { "title" : "MongoDB in Action", "score" : 49.48653394500073 } { "title" : "MongoDB in Action, Second Edition", "score" : 12.5 }  When  you  see  the  low  text  score  for  the  second  edition  of  MonogDB  in  Action,  it becomes obvious why it hasn’t shown up in the top scoring matches. But now the ques- tion is why the score is so low for the second edition. If you do a find only on the sec- ond edition, the answer becomes more obvious:   > db.books.findOne {"title" : "MongoDB in Action, Second Edition"}  {         "_id" : 755,         "title" : "MongoDB in Action, Second Edition",         "isbn" : "1617291609",         "pageCount" : 0,         "thumbnailUrl" :  "https:  s3.amazonaws.com AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb- images banker2.jpg",          "status" : "MEAP",         "authors" : [                 "Kyle Banker",                 "Peter Bakkum",                 "Tim Hawkins",                 "Shaun Verch",                 "Douglas Garrett"         ],         "categories" : [ ] }  www.it-ebooks.info   266  CHAPTER 9 Text search  As you can see, because this data is from before the second edition was printed, the second edition didn’t have the shortDescription or longDescription fields. This is true for many of the books that hadn’t yet been published, and as a result those books will end up with a lower score.   You can use the flexibility of the aggregation framework to compensate for this somewhat. One way to do this is to multiply the text search score by a factor—say, 3— if a document doesn’t have a longDescription field. The following listing shows an example of how you might do this.  Listing 9.4 Add text multiplier if longDescription isn’t present  > db.books.aggregate      ...     [     ...         { $match: { $text: { $search: 'mongodb in action' } } }, ... ...         { $project: { ...             title: 1, ...             score: { $meta: 'textScore' }, ...             multiplier: { $cond: [ '$longDescription',1.0,3.0] } }   ...         }, ... ...         { $project: { ...             _id:0, title: 1, score: 1, multiplier: 1, ...             adjScore: {$multiply: ['$score','$multiplier']}}     ...         }, ... ...         { $sort: {adjScore: -1}}      ...     ] ...  ;  Sort by descending  adjusted score  Calculate multiplier: 3.0 if longDescription doesn’t exist  Calculate  adjusted  score: score  * multiplier  { "title" : "MongoDB in Action", "score" : 49.48653394500073,    "multiplier" : 1, "adjScore" : 49.48653394500073 } { "title" : "MongoDB in Action, Second Edition", "score" : 12.5,    "multiplier" : 3, "adjScore" : 37.5 }                          { "title" : "Spring Batch in Action", "score" : 11.666666666666666,    "multiplier" : 3, "adjScore" : 35 } { "title" : "Hadoop in Action", "score" : 24.99910329985653,    "multiplier" : 1, "adjScore" : 24.99910329985653 } { "title" : "HTML5 in Action", "score" : 23.02156177156177,    "multiplier" : 1, "adjScore" : 23.02156177156177 }   Second  edition  now second  on list  As you can see in the first $project operator in the pipeline, you’re calculating a mul- tiplier by testing whether  longDescription exists. A condition is considered false if it’s null or doesn’t exist, so you can use the $cond function to set a multiplier of 1.0 if longDescription exists and a multiplier of 3.0 if longDescription doesn’t exist.   You then have a second $project operator in the aggregation pipeline that calcu- lates an adjusted score by multiplying the text search score by the multiplier 1.0 or 3.0. Finally, you sort by the adjusted score in descending order.   As you can see, the MongoDB text search does have its limitations. Missing text fields  can  cause  you  to  miss  some  results.  The  MongoDB  text  search  also  provides  www.it-ebooks.info   Text search languages  267  some ways to improve your search by requiring certain words or phrases to be in the search results, or by excluding documents that contain certain words. The aggrega- tion  framework  offers  additional  flexibility  and  functionality  and  can  be  useful  in extending the value of your text search.   Now that you’ve seen the basics and a few advanced features of MongoDB text search,  you’re ready to tackle another complex issue: searching languages other than English.  9.6  Text search languages Remember that much of MongoDB’s text search power comes from being able to stem words. Searching for the word action will return the same results as searching for the word  actions,  because  they  have  the  same  stem.  But  stemming  is  language-specific. MongoDB won’t recognize the plural or other unstemmed version of a non-English word unless you tell MongoDB what language you’re using.   There are three points at which you can tell MongoDB what language you’re using:      In the index—You can specify the default language for a particular collection.     When you insert a document—You can override this default to tell MongoDB that a particular document or field within the document is a language other than the index-specified default.     When you perform the text search in a find   or aggregate   function—You can tell  MongoDB what language your search is using.  Stemming and stop words: Simple but limited Currently  MongoDB  uses  “simple  language-specific  suffix  stemming”   see  http:   docs.mongodb.org manual core index-text  . Various stemming algorithms, includ- ing suffix stripping, are further described at http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Stemming. If you require processing of a language not supported by the suffix stemming approach, such as Chinese, or wish to use a different or customized stemmer, your best bet is to go to a more full-featured text search engine.  Similarly, although MongoDB will use a different stop word dictionary based on the language, it doesn’t allow you to customize the stop word dictionaries. Again, this is something that dedicated text search engines typically support.  Let’s take a look at how you use each of these options.  9.6.1  Specifying language in the index Returning to the example index you created in section 9.3.2, you can modify the index definition to define a default language. Before changing the language for the books col- lection, run the following text search command. You should find no results because you’re searching for a stop word: in. Remember, stop words aren’t indexed:  > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'in '}} .count   0  www.it-ebooks.info   268  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Now delete the previous index and create the same index, but with the language french:  db.books.dropIndex 'books_text_index' ;     Drop existing text  index on books  db.books.createIndex                 {'$**': 'text'},      {weights:         {title: 10,          categories: 5},        name : 'books_text_index',       default_language: 'french'        }  ;  Add new index with  language french  Now if you rerun the previous find  , you’ll now find some books, because in French, the word in isn’t a stop word:  > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'in '}} .count   334  If you check the indexes on the books collection, you’ll see the language is now French:  > db.books.getIndexes   [         {                 "v" : 1,                 "key" : {                         "_id" : 1                 },                 "name" : "_id_",                 "ns" : "catalog.books"         },         {                 "v" : 1,                 "key" : {                         "_fts" : "text",                         "_ftsx" : 1                 },                 "name" : "books_text_index",                 "ns" : "catalog.books",                 "weights" : {                         "$**" : 1,                         "categories" : 5,                         "title" : 10                 },                 "default_language" : "french",                      "language_override" : "language",                 "textIndexVersion" : 2         } ]   www.it-ebooks.info  Default text index  language is French   Text search languages  269  9.6.2  Specifying the language in the document Before you insert an example document that specifies the document language, change the index back to English by running the following commands:   db.books.dropIndex 'books_text_index' ;      db.books.createIndex                 {'$**': 'text'},      {weights:         {title: 10,          categories: 5},       name : 'books_text_index',        default_language: 'english'        }  ;  Specify default  language of English  Now insert a new document specifying the language as French:  db.books.insert {     _id: 999,     title: 'Le Petite Prince',     pageCount: 85,     publishedDate:  ISODate '1943-01-01T01:00:00Z' ,     shortDescription: "Le Petit Prince est une œuvre de langue française, la plus connue d'Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Publié en 1943 à New York simultanément en anglais et en français. C'est un conte poétique et philosophique sous l'apparence d'un conte pour enfants.",     status: 'PUBLISH',     authors: ['Antoine de Saint-Exupéry'],     language: 'french'      }   Specify language  as ‘french’  MongoDB text search also allows you to change the name of the field used to specify the document language when you define the index, if you want to use something other than language. You can also specify different parts of the document to be in different languages.  You  can  read  more  about  these  features  at http:  docs.mongodb.org  manual tutorial specify-language-for-text-index .   Now that you’ve inserted a document in French, let’s see how you can search for it  in French as well.  9.6.3  Specifying the language in a search What  language  your  text  search  string  represents  can  make  a  big  difference  in  the results. Remember that the language affects how MongoDB interprets your string by defining  the  stop  words  as  well  as  stemming.  Let’s  see  how  the  specified  language affects both how the document was indexed and how MongoDB performs the search. Our first example, shown in the next listing, shows the effect of stemming on our doc- ument indexes as well as on our search terms.  www.it-ebooks.info   270  CHAPTER 9 Text search  Listing 9.5 Example of how language affects stemming  > db.books.find {$text: {$search:   'simultanment',$language:'french'}},{title:1}    { "_id" : 999, "title" : "Le Petit Prince" }  Language French; only  finds "Le Petit Prince"  > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'simultanment'}},{title:1}  { "_id" : 186, "title" : "Hadoop in Action" }    { "_id" : 293, "title" : "Making Sense of Java" } { "_id" : 999, "title" : "Le Petite Prince" }  Same search in  English finds two  different books  > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'prince'}},{title:1}  { "_id" : 145, "title" : "Azure in Action" }    { "_id" : 999, "title" : "Le Petit Prince" }  Search for prince in English  finds both French and  English language books  When you search for simultanment and specify the language as French, you find only the French book Le Petit Prince. Yet when you do the same search without specifying the language—meaning you use the default language English—you return two com- pletely different books.    How can this be? With just this example, you might assume MongoDB is ignoring any  documents  that  aren’t  in  the  specified  language.  But  if  you  look  at  the  third find  , where you search for the word prince you see that MongoDB can indeed find books in either French or English.     What’s  up  with  this?  The  answer  lies  in  stemming.  When  you  specify  a  search string,  MongoDB  will  search  for  the  stemmed  words  in  your  search  string,  not  the actual words from the string. A similar process is used for creating the index for the documents where the index will contain the stemmed versions of words in the docu- ment, not the words themselves. As a result, the stemmed word MongoDB comes up with for simultanment will be different for French and English.    For French, it’s easy to see how MongoDB found the one document because the book description contained the word simultanment. For the English documents, though, the reason is less clear. The next listing helps clarify the situation a bit and also illus- trates some of the limitations of stemming.  Listing 9.6 Results of stemming simultaneous  > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'simultaneous'}},{title:1}  { "_id" : 186, "title" : "Hadoop in Action" }    { "_id" : 293, "title" : "Making Sense of Java" } { "_id" : 999, "title" : "Le Petite Prince" }  English  search for  simultaneous   > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'simultaneous',   $language:'french'}},{title:1}    >                                         French search for  simultaneous; nothing found  In this listing you searched for the word simultaneous in both English and French. As you  expected,  when  you  searched  in  English,  you  found  the  two  books  previously found when you searched for simultanment.   www.it-ebooks.info   Text search languages  271   But if you now search for simultaneous in French, you won’t find the French book. Unfortunately, in this case what MongoDB calculates as the stem word in French isn’t the same as the calculated stem word for simultanment.   This result can be confusing, and the process of calculating the stem for a word  isn’t an exact science. But in most cases you’ll find what you’ll expect.    Fortunately, the effect of language on stop words is much simpler. For stop words, MongoDB can use a dictionary to access a list of known stop words for a given lan- guage. As a result, the effect of language on the interpretation of stop words is much clearer. The next listing shows a simple example.  Listing 9.7 Example of how language affects stop words  > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'de'}},{title:1}  { "_id" : 36, "title" : "ASP.NET 4.0 in Practice" }   { "_id" : 629, "title" : "Play for Java" } { "_id" : 199, "title" : "Doing IT Right" } { "_id" : 10, "title" : "OSGi in Depth" } { "_id" : 224, "title" : "Entity Framework 4 in Action" } { "_id" : 761, "title" : "jQuery in Action, Third Edition" }  > db.books.find {$text: {$search: 'de', $language: 'french'}} .count   0                       Search for “de” finds  only English books  Search for “de” in  French finds nothing  In this example, you search for the word de first in English and then in French. When the search is done in English, you find a number of books. In this case you’re finding books with authors who have the word de in their name. You won’t find the French book because in French de is a stop word and therefore isn’t indexed.   If you perform this same search in French, you won’t find any results because de is a stop word in French. As a result, the parsed search string won’t contain any words to search for once the stop words are removed.   As you can see, language can have a big effect on the results of your text search as well as the text search indexes created for a document. That’s why it’s important to spec- ify the language you’ll be using in your index, document, and search string. If you’re only worried about English, then your task is much simpler. But if not, read on to see which languages MongoDB supports. Hopefully you’ll find the languages you need.  9.6.4  Available languages MongoDB supports quite a few languages, and you can expect the list to grow over time. The following lists the languages supported by MongoDB as of release 2.6  the same languages are also supported by MongoDB v3.0 . The list also shows the two-let- ter abbreviation you can use instead of the full word:     da—danish   nl—dutch   en—english  www.it-ebooks.info   272  CHAPTER 9 Text search        fi—finnish fr—french    de—german   hu—hungarian     it—italian          no—norwegian   pt—portuguese ro—romanian ru—russian   es—spanish sv—swedish tr—turkish        9.7  In addition to this list, you can specify none. When you do, MongoDB skips any pro- cessing for stemming and stop words. For example, a document with the language of none will have an index created for each unique word in the document. Only the exact words will be indexed, without any stemming, and the index won’t exclude any stop words. This approach can be useful if your documents contain words that MongoDB is having a difficult time processing. The downside is that you won’t be able to take advantage of stemming finding “similar” words and your results will contain only exact word matches.  Summary As  you  can  see,  MongoDB  can  provide  a  great  deal  of  capabilities  in  using  a  basic query text search for your database. The aggregation framework provides even more complex search capabilities if needed. But MongoDB text search has its limits and isn’t intended to completely replace dedicated text search engines such as Elasticsearch or Solr.  If  you  can  get  by  with  MongoDB  text  search,  though,  you’ll  save  yourself  the effort and complexity of maintaining a duplicate copy of the data within a dedicated search engine.    Now that you know the full capabilities of MongoDB searches, updates, and index- ing, let’s move on to a topic that’s new to MongoDB v3.0 and has to do with how MongoDB stores, updates, and reads data: the WiredTiger storage engine!  www.it-ebooks.info   WiredTiger and pluggable storage  This chapter covers   WiredTiger   Pluggable storage engines   A comparison between MMAPv1 and WiredTiger  With version 3.0, MongoDB introduced the Pluggable Storage Engine API as one of its major changes. In this chapter, we’ll talk about what exactly it is and why it has been added to MongoDB. We’ll talk about WiredTiger, a pluggable storage engine that’s bundled with MongoDB, and compare it with the default storage engine that MongoDB has used up until version 3.0. We’ll compare the two engines in terms of speed, disk use, and latency. We’ll also introduce several other pluggable storage engines that are expected to become interesting alternatives. For the more advanced readers, we’ll uncover the technology behind pluggable storage engines.  10.1 Pluggable Storage Engine API  An  application  programming  interface   API   is  a  relatively  strict  set  of  routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. As an example, you should be aware by now that MongoDB offers an API that allows other software to interact with  MongoDB  without  using  the  MongoDB  shell:  each  of  the  MongoDB  drivers  273  www.it-ebooks.info   274  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage  that you’ve been using use the API provided by MongoDB to add driver functionality. They allow your application to communicate with the MongoDB database and to per- form the basic CRUD operations on your documents in the database.   A storage engine is an interface between the database and the hardware. A storage engine doesn’t change how you perform your queries in the shell or in the driver, and it doesn’t interfere with MongoDB at the cluster level. But storage engines interfere with how data is written to, deleted from, and read from disk, as well as which data structure will be used for storing the data.   The Pluggable Storage Engine API allows third parties to develop storage engines for MongoDB. Before the Pluggable Storage Engine API, the only storage engine avail- able to MongoDB was MMAPv1.   MongoDB still uses the  MMAPv1 storage engine, and it’s still the default storage engine in version 3.0 and later. The MMAPv1 storage engine is based on memory map- ping, and has been a stable solution for MongoDB so far. One drawback to MMAPv1 that you’ll notice soon if you have a lot of data to store is that it quickly consumes an enormous amount of disk space as your data set grows, to the extent that it preallo- cates 2 GB blocks every time it needs to grow in size. But preallocation is done by most database systems, and MongoDB is no exception. It does this in small, growing incre- ments at first, but once it becomes larger than 2 GB, every next increment will preallo- cate another 2 GB, so as a system administrator you’ll have to keep this in mind when managing disk space for your servers.   The database administrator has to choose from the different storage alternatives, which  dictate  how  data  is  stored  on  disk.  Since  version  3.0,  it’s  now  possible  to  tell MongoDB to use a different module for storage, and that’s what the Pluggable Storage Engine  API  does.  It  provides  functions  that  MongoDB  needs  to  use  to  store  data. MongoDB  3.0  comes  bundled  with  an  alternative  to  MMAPv1,  which  is  WiredTiger. We’ll talk more about WiredTiger and how you can switch to using it in a later section in this chapter, but first let’s consider why MongoDB has offered the ability to use dif- ferent storage engines.  10.1.1 Why use different storages engines?  Let’s consider two different applications:    A news site, like Huffington Post   A social media site, like Twitter or Fac  On news sites you’ll see news articles. The Huffington Post averages 1,200 editorial pieces  per  day,  but  they’re  read  by  tens  of  millions  of  people  around  the  world.1 Bring this into contrast with a social media site where people share their own sto- ries, which are much shorter than news articles. Twitter tweets are at most 140 char- acters, and Fac or Google+ status updates are short as well. These two different  1 According to a 2013 article on DigiDay: http:  digiday.com publishers whos-winning-at-volume-in-publishing .   www.it-ebooks.info   WiredTiger  275  use  cases  have  different  requirements  in  terms  of  database  storage  and  access,  as table 10.1 shows.   News sites have much less data to delve into compared to social media sites, and for many visitors, the front page looks the same. Social media sites, on the other hand, have to go through millions and millions of tweets or status updates. Every visitor has their own feed, which should show only those tweets and updates that matter to the visitor.  In  addition  to  delivering  millions  of  status  updates  for  different  visitors,  the social media platforms also need to be able to store millions of new tweets every day.2  Table 10.1 Different requirements for different cases users   News site  Social media site  Number of documents  Hundreds of articles  Millions of updates  Average size  A few kilobytes  Tens of bytes  Dynamic content  None—same for every visitor  Content depends on visitor  For news sites, the application needs to collect the same articles over and over again for every user visiting the news site at the same time. Many database systems have a query cache that will quickly deliver the data that was requested by the same query a few minutes ago. Such news site applications can also make use of an external in-memory cache system such as Memcached or Redis to deliver the same data at high speeds. But these technologies will not help social media sites where the requested data is differ- ent every time, even per visitor. Such applications need a different kind of storage sys- tem that has much better performance when reading filtered data from a humongous set of records. Social media sites also need a storage system that has excellent write performance to be able to store millions of new records every day. News sites don’t need this kind of performance because their number of write operations only runs in the mere thousands.   To cater to these different kinds of systems, MongoDB has implemented the con- cept of a pluggable storage engine so that the database administrators or system engi- neers can choose the storage engine that gives the best performance for their use case. In  the  next  section  we’ll  introduce  a  storage  plugin  that’s  bundled  with  MongoDB: WiredTiger.  10.2 WiredTiger  WiredTiger is a high-performance, scalable, open source data engine that focuses on multicore  scalability  and  optimal  RAM  use.  Multicore  scaling  is  achieved  by  using  2 According to Domo, in 2014, every minute of the day over 2.4 million pieces of content were shared on Face- book, and over 270,000 tweets were sent on Twitter. These numbers translate to over 3.5 billion shares per day, and 400 million tweets per day.  www.it-ebooks.info   276  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage  modern programming techniques such as hazard pointers3 and lock-free algorithms,4 resulting in more work done by each CPU core than alternative engines.   WiredTiger was developed by Michael Cahill and Keith Bostic, both architects at Sleepycat Software, which was founded by Bostic and his wife. At Sleepycat Software they designed and developed the Berkeley DB, the most widely used embedded data- management software in the world.  10.2.1 Switching to WiredTiger  Before you start using WiredTiger, make sure you’re running a 64-bit system, with a 64-bit OS, because this is required. This should be the case in most modern computer equipment. Also, when setting up MongoDB to use WiredTiger, it’s crucial that you start the MongoDB server with the WiredTiger configuration on a fresh dbPath direc- tory. If you start the server with a dbPath that’s in the MMAPv1 structure, it won’t start. This is because the storage structure of MMAPv1 isn’t compatible with that of Wired- Tiger, and there’s no on-the-fly conversion available between storage structures. But there’s a way to migrate your MMAPv1-based databases to WiredTiger, and vice versa, using  mongodump  and  mongorestore.  See  chapter  13  to  learn  more  about  dumping and restoring your databases.   All you need to do to enable WiredTiger in your MongoDB installation is to set the storage  configuration  in  your  default  YAML  configuration  file   see  appendix  A  for more information about YAML  as follows:  storage:     dbPath: " data db"     journal:         enabled: true     engine: "wiredTiger"     wiredTiger:         engineConfig:             cacheSizeGB: 8             journalCompressor: none         collectionConfig:             blockCompressor: none         indexConfig:             prefixCompression: false  3 In multithreading programming it’s important to keep track of which memory blocks need to be accessible by the threads, and whether any thread is accessing it. Hazard pointers are a list of pointers to such memory blocks that are being accessed by a thread, and other threads are prohibited from modifying or deleting the pointers and the memory blocks they point to, as long as they’re in the hazard pointers list.  4 Resource locking is an important concept in multithreaded programming. Lock-free algorithms are program- ming patterns to avoid a program being stuck because several threads are waiting for each other to release their locks, and to guarantee that the program as a whole makes progress.  www.it-ebooks.info   WiredTiger  277  This is the basic, noncompressed configuration to enable WiredTiger for your MongoDB installation. Table 10.2 shows what the options do.  Table 10.2 Various options of the MongoDB configuration file  Option Name  Description  dbPath  journal.enabled  engine  wiredTiger  engineConfig.cacheSize  engineConfig.journalCompressor  collectionConfig.blockCompressor  indexConfig.prefixCompression  The path where your database files are stored.  Defaults to  data db.  Whether to enable journaling or not. It’s recom- mended to enable this as it may save data that was  lost during a power outage and hasn’t been synchro- nized to disk. Defaults to true on 64-bit systems.  Which storage engine to use. Defaults to mmapv1.  To use WiredTiger, set this to wiredTiger.  This is where WiredTiger-specific options are set.  This is how much RAM memory WiredTiger needs  to reserve for the in-memory data, which would  then serve as a cache to rapidly serve your data.  Defaults to half the physical RAM on your system,  at least 1 GB.  Tells WiredTiger what kind of compressor to use for  the journaling data. Defaults to snappy, but this is  best set to none to achieve the best performance.  This tells WiredTiger what kind of compressor to use  for the collection data. The three supported options  are none, snappy, and zlib. You’ll see in the  benchmarks which is the best option for you.  Defaults to snappy.  This tells WiredTiger whether to use compression for  its index data. Defaults to true.  10.2.2 Migrating your database to WiredTiger  Because you can’t run MongoDB with the WiredTiger set up on a data directory that’s in MMAPv1 format, you’ll need to migrate your database to the WiredTiger installa- tion. This is basically done by creating dumps and restoring from them  see chapter 13 for more information :  1 Create a MongoDB dump of your MMAPv1-based database:  $ mkdir ~ mongo-migration $ cd ~ mongo-migration $ mongodump  This  will  create  a  dump  directory  called  mongo-migration  in  your  home directory.  www.it-ebooks.info   278  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage  2 Stop the mongod instance, and make sure there’s no mongod process running:  $ ps ax  grep mongo  vious section.  3 Update the MongoDB configuration to use WiredTiger, as described in the pre-  4 Move the MMAPv1-based database away. Assuming dbPath is set to  data db:  $ sudo mv  data db  data db-mmapv1  5 Create a fresh directory and give the MongoDB user group  assuming mongodb   permission to write to it:  $ mkdir  data db $ chown mongodb:mongodb  data db $ chmod 755  data db  6 Start your WiredTiger-enabled MongoDB instance. 7 Import your dump into the WiredTiger-enabled MongoDB instance:  $ cd ~ mongo-migration $ mongorestore dump  Now  you  should  have  your  database  in  your  newly  configured  MongoDB  environ- ment. If you examine the WiredTiger-based  data db and compare it with your old MMAPv1-based  data db-mmapv1, you’ll see considerable differences in how they’re managed. For one, if you have large databases, you’ll notice that the disk use of both directories differs greatly. You’ll see that when we do the benchmark testing in the next section.   To convert your WiredTiger-based database back into MMAPv1, repeat the process, but  now  you’ll  make  a  dump  of  the  data  in  your  WiredTiger  storage,  stopping  the MongoDB instance, changing the configuration to use MMAPv1, starting the MongoDB instance  with  this  configuration,  and  restoring  the  data  dump  into  the  MMAPv1- enabled instance.   An alternative method is to run a second MongoDB instance with a WiredTiger configuration, and add this instance to your replica set, together with your existing MMAPv1 instance. Replica sets are covered in chapter 11.  10.3 Comparison with MMAPv1  How does WiredTiger’s performance compare to a MongoDB instance with MMAPv1? In this chapter, you’ll test three WiredTiger configurations against  MMAPv1 using a couple of JavaScript and shell scripts. You’ll test the following configurations:    Default configuration using MMAPv1   Normal WiredTiger, no compression  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparison with MMAPv1  279    WiredTiger with snappy compression   WiredTiger with zlib compression  Zlib  and  snappy  are  compression  algorithms.  The  former  is  an  abstraction  of  the DEFLATE compression algorithm, which is an LZ77 variant that uses Huffman coding. Zlib is very common on many software platforms, and is the basis for the gzip file com- pression program. Snappy is developed by Google and is widely used in Google’s proj- ects such as BigTable. Snappy is more of an intermediate solution, which doesn’t aim for maximum compression, but instead goes for high speeds, along with reasonable compression.   You’re going to test the insert performance first to fill up the test databases. Then you’ll use these test databases to measure the read performance. When going through the benchmark testing in the following sections, please keep in mind that it’s difficult to draw the correct conclusions from these test results. The data sets in these tests are much smaller than real-world examples, and in real-world examples you’d have many more different search filters to collect the data that you need. There would also be a larger variety in the data structures in real-world examples, which will affect the com- pression algorithms in use. The tests in this chapter are only simple examples to give you a general idea. They’ll also hopefully give you some insight into how you’d pro- ceed testing the MongoDB instances with your own data and the filters that your appli- cation uses.  10.3.1 Configuration files  To be able to compare the disk use of the different storage configurations, you’ll use different  database  paths  in  the  storage  configuration  files.  In  a  production  system, however, you’d end up with the common database path for a MongoDB installation on your machine.   The configuration file for the MMAPv1 instance, called mmapv1.conf, is as follows,  in YAML format:  storage:     dbPath: ". data-mmapv1"     directoryPerDB: true     journal:         enabled: true systemLog:     destination: file     path: ". mongodb-server.log"     logAppend: true     timeStampFormat: iso8601-utc net:     bindIp: 127.0.0.1     port: 27017     unixDomainSocket:         enabled : true  www.it-ebooks.info   280  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage  For the WiredTiger configurations, it’s the same as the previous code, except for the storage part. For the no-compression version you’ll use the following storage configu- ration for WiredTiger, naming it wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf:  For the snappy instance, you’ll use the following configuration for storage; what’s dif- ferent from the uncompressed WiredTiger instance is shown in bold. This file is called “wiredtiger-snappy.conf”:  Finally, for the zlib instance, you’ll use the following storage configuration, naming it wiredtiger-zlib.conf:  storage:     dbPath: ". data-wt-uncompressed"     directoryPerDB: true     journal:         enabled: true     engine: "wiredTiger"     wiredTiger:         engineConfig:             cacheSizeGB: 8             journalCompressor: none         collectionConfig:             blockCompressor: none         indexConfig:             prefixCompression: false  storage:     dbPath: ". data-wt-zlib"     directoryPerDB: true     journal:         enabled: true     engine: "wiredTiger"     wiredTiger:         engineConfig:             cacheSizeGB: 8             journalCompressor: none         collectionConfig:             blockCompressor: snappy         indexConfig:             prefixCompression: true  storage:     dbPath: ". data-wt-snappy"     directoryPerDB: true     journal:         enabled: true     engine: "wiredTiger"     wiredTiger:         engineConfig:             cacheSizeGB: 8             journalCompressor: none         collectionConfig:             blockCompressor: zlib  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparison with MMAPv1  281          indexConfig:             prefixCompression: true  If you have a legacy MongoDB installation in some directory, and these configuration files in a configs directory, you can use this MongoDB installation with these configu- rations by, for example running the following for the MMAPv1 configuration:  $ bin mongod --config configs mmapv1.conf &  This should run a MongoDB instance in the background with the given configuration.  10.3.2 Insertion script and benchmark script  You’ll use the following JavaScript code to fill up the benchmark database with docu- ments that have four fields of different types, an array field with eight document ele- ments with four differently typed fields each, and eight subdocuments, also with four differently typed fields each. This is by no means a real-world situation, and compres- sion algorithms will work differently with different data sets that are more heteroge- neous than this test data:  for  var j = 0; j < 10000; j++  {     var r1 = Math.random  ;         A nice date around year 2000     var dateFld = new Date 1.5e12 * r1 ;     var intFld = Math.floor 1e8 * r1 ;        A nicely randomized string of around 40 characters     var stringFld = Math.floor 1e64 * r1 .toString 36 ;     var boolFld = intFld % 2;      doc = {         random_date: dateFld,         random_int: intFld,         random_string: stringFld,         random_bool: boolFld     }      doc.arr = [];      for  var i = 0; i < 16; i++  {         var r2 = Math.random  ;             A nice date around year 2000         var dateFld = new Date 1.5e12 * r2 ;         var intFld = Math.floor 1e8 * r2 ;         var stringFld = Math.floor 1e64 * r2 .toString 36 ;         var boolField = intFld % 2;          if  i < 8  {             doc.arr.push {                 date_field: dateFld,                 int_field: intFld,                 string_field: stringFld,                 bool_field: boolFld             } ;  www.it-ebooks.info   282  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage          } else {             doc["sub" + i] = {                 date_field: dateFld,                 int_field: intFld,                 string_field: stringFld,                 bool_field: boolFld             };         }     }      db.benchmark.insert doc ; }  ! bin bash  export MONGO_DIR= storage mongodb export NUM_LOOPS=16  configs=      mmapv1.conf     wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf     wiredtiger-snappy.conf     wiredtiger-zlib.conf    This piece of JavaScript code, stored in insert.js, will insert 10,000 documents into the benchmark database. This script will be run by the following batch script that will go through all the four configurations, and does the same insert job for each configura- tion, 16 times:  cd $MONGO_DIR for config in "${configs[@]}"; do     echo "===== RUNNING $config ====="     echo "Cleaning up data directory"     DATA_DIR=$ grep dbPath configs $config  awk -F\" '{ print $2 }'      rm -rf $MONGO_DIR $DATA_DIR *      echo -ne "Starting up mongod...

Therefore, you should make sure that you stop your MongoDB instance before running this script.  10.3.3 Insertion benchmark results  After running this batch script, you’ll see output that looks like the following. The tim- ings may be different on each machine, depending on the hardware and even on the operating system’s kernel. This output was generated on a QuadCore i5-3570K run- ning at 3.4 GHz, with 16 GB of RAM, and the storage medium being an ext4-formatted LVM partition, spread over two Hitachi Deskstar T7K250 250 GB disks connected to a SATA port, with a 7200 RPM rotational speed. The system runs on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine with a default Linux kernel 3.13.0 for the Intel 64-bit architecture:  ===== RUNNING mmapv1.conf ===== Cleaning up data directory Starting up mongod... took 102 seconds Running import loop 16 Insert performance for mmapv1.conf: 105 seconds Shutting down server... took 1 seconds Disk usage for mmapv1.conf: 4128.04MB ===== RUNNING wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf ===== Cleaning up data directory Starting up mongod... took 2 seconds Running import loop 16 Insert performance for wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf: 92 seconds Shutting down server... took 3 seconds  www.it-ebooks.info   284  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage  Disk usage for wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf: 560.56MB ===== RUNNING wiredtiger-snappy.conf ===== Cleaning up data directory Starting up mongod... took 1 seconds Running import loop 16 Insert performance for wiredtiger-snappy.conf: 93 seconds Shutting down server... took 2 seconds Disk usage for wiredtiger-snappy.conf: 380.27MB ===== RUNNING wiredtiger-zlib.conf ===== Cleaning up data directory Starting up mongod... took 2 seconds Running import loop 16 Insert performance for wiredtiger-zlib.conf: 104 seconds Shutting down server... took 3 seconds Disk usage for wiredtiger-zlib.conf: 326.67MB  It timed the server startup, the duration of the insert job, and the server shutdown processes, and measured the disk use of the storage directory after shutdown. You can see the results in table 10.3.  Table 10.3 Comparing MMAPv1 and WiredTiger operations  MMAPv1  WT  WT snappy  WT zlib  Starting up  Insert job  Shut down  Disk use  102 sec  105 sec  1 sec  2 sec  92 sec  3 sec  1 sec  93 sec  2 sec  2 sec  104 sec  3 sec  4128.04 MB  560.56 MB  380.27 MB  326.67 MB  From this table it appears that WiredTiger has a tremendous gain in the time to start up the server and initialize the storage directory. But this is a one-time process, and therefore not a crucial measurement. Another test of the startup and shutdown times of  the  MongoDB  instances  with  a  preinitialized  storage  directory  showed  that  the MMAPv1 startup took four seconds. You’ll see this in a test in the next section, where you’ll put the read performance to the test.   There’s little gain to be had for the insert job when using WiredTiger, although the difference can be considerable when dealing with more data than this data set. Also  keep  in  mind  that  this  test  doesn’t  test  running  the  insert  job  using  multiple Mongo client connections simultaneously.   The most striking feature of these test results is the disk use: WiredTiger without compression uses less than 15% of what MMAPv1 uses, and if you add compression, it’s less than 10%! You’ll also see that the snappy compression configuration finds a good middle ground between the insert speeds and the disk use. It’s almost as fast as a bare WiredTiger instance with no compression, but still gains 180 MB on this data set. The zlib configuration has better compression, but in exchange for this, it takes 10 sec- onds more to do the insert job.  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparison with MMAPv1  285  10.3.4 Read performance scripts  Up until now you’ve benchmarked the write performance of the different storage con- figurations, but for some applications you might be more interested in the read perfor- mance.  Here’s  the  simple  JavaScript  that  will  fetch  all  records  in  the  benchmark collection and sequentially go through each of them. Note that this doesn’t benchmark searches and filtering, which would need a predefined set of values to search for:  This simple JavaScript is put in a read.js file and run by the following read.sh shell script, which is similar to the insert script:  c = db.benchmark.find  ; while c.hasNext    c.next  ;  ! bin bash  export MONGO_DIR= storage mongodb export NUM_LOOPS=16  configs=      mmapv1.conf     wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf     wiredtiger-snappy.conf     wiredtiger-zlib.conf    sudo echo "Acquired root permissions"  cd $MONGO_DIR for config in "${configs[@]}"; do     echo "===== RUNNING $config ====="     echo "Clearing memory caches"     sync     echo 3  sudo tee  proc sys vm drop_caches      echo -ne "Starting up mongod...

Because  the  script  needs  to  clear  the  memory  caches  to  get  an accurate timing of cold fetches—that is, fetches that aren’t from the cache, but from the storage system itself—you’ll need to enter your password to give it sudo access so it can flush the memory cache.  10.3.5 Read performance results  When running the script, you’ll see an output similar to the following:  ===== RUNNING mmapv1.conf ===== Clearing memory caches 3 Starting up mongod... took 3 seconds Running read loop 16 Read performance for mmapv1.conf: 33 seconds Shutting down server... took 1 seconds ===== RUNNING wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf ===== Clearing memory caches 3 Starting up mongod... took 2 seconds Running read loop 16 Read performance for wiredtiger-uncompressed.conf: 23 seconds Shutting down server... took 2 seconds ===== RUNNING wiredtiger-snappy.conf ===== Clearing memory caches 3 Starting up mongod... took 3 seconds Running read loop 16 Read performance for wiredtiger-snappy.conf: 21 seconds Shutting down server... took 1 seconds  www.it-ebooks.info   Comparison with MMAPv1  287  ===== RUNNING wiredtiger-zlib.conf ===== Clearing memory caches 3 Starting up mongod... took 2 seconds Running read loop 16 Read performance for wiredtiger-zlib.conf: 21 seconds Shutting down server... took 1 seconds  The 3’s on their own lines are from the echo to clear the memory caches, so you can ignore those. You can now clearly see that the startup and shutdown times are similar for all MongoDB configurations, as shown in table 10.4.  Table 10.4 Comparing shutdown and startup times of various configurations  MMAPv1  WT  WT snappy  WT zlib  Starting up  Read job  Shut down  3 sec  33 sec  1 sec  2 sec  23 sec  2 sec  3 sec  21 sec  1 sec  2 sec  21 sec  1 sec  The read job took at least 10 seconds longer on the MMAPv1 configuration than on the WiredTiger configurations. If you check the timings files, you’ll see why. The tim- ings have been graphed in figure 10.1.   It’s clear that the first iteration took the longest because each subsequent iteration will take the results directly from the memory cache. For the cold fetch, MMAPv1 is clearly the slowest.

You’ve seen the server startup and shutdown times, the insertion of thousands of averagely sized docu- ments, and the fetching and iterating through these documents, repeatedly. You’ve also looked at the disk use of the storage directories.   You haven’t tested how the MongoDB instances perform when there are several cli- ents connecting and making requests at the same time. You also haven’t tested the ran- dom  search  and  filtering  performances.  These  two  are  what  happens  most  in  a  real- world example, and require a more complicated benchmark testing setup than what is used in this chapter. We hope that the benchmark examples give you some insight into how you want to benchmark the other aspects of the MongoDB installations.   From the results in this chapter, you can conclude that there’s a tremendous gain to be had in terms of disk use. For small-scale applications where resource use is a con- cern, this will be the deciding factor, and you should go with a compressed version of WiredTiger. The zlib version will give the best performance-versus-cost ratio. For critical  www.it-ebooks.info   Other examples of pluggable storage engines  289  applications where extra storage cost is worthwhile, the WiredTiger configuration with- out compression, or, if needed, using the snappy compression algorithm, will give slightly better speeds over the zlib configuration.   Even when disk storage isn’t an issue for enterprise users, the speed of cold fetches will often be an important factor. This is especially true for social network sites where every visitor will have specific filters, so that cache misses will often occur.   Again, remember that the benchmarks in this chapter aren’t totally representative of real-world situations, and therefore no hard conclusions should be drawn from the results of these benchmarks. But we hope that these benchmarks will give you a basic idea of what you can do with the data in your application, and that you’ll be able to tune the benchmark scripts to best match the workload in your application. This way you’ll be able to draw better conclusions as to what storage engine is better for your application’s specific use case.   There are also several other environmental factors that depend on the hardware and software  OS kernel  configuration of your system. They haven’t been taken into account in this chapter, but they may affect the performance of these benchmarks. When comparing storage engines, one should remember to fix all the environmental factors, even though some storage systems may perform better with a certain operat- ing system setting, which may have a negative effect on other storage systems. There- fore, you should be cautious when drawing conclusions from such benchmarks.  10.4 Other examples of pluggable storage engines  We  talked  about  WiredTiger  in  the  previous  sections  and  how  it  performs  against MMAPv1 in terms of disk use and read write speeds. In this section we’ll introduce you to several other storage engines that are available.   An example is RocksDB, developed by Fac, and based on Google’s Level  DB with significant inspiration from Apache’s Hbase. RocksDB is a key-value store that was developed  to  exploit  the  full  potential  of  high  read write  rates  offered  by  Flash  or RAM  subsystems  to  offer  low-latency  database  access  by  using  an  LSM  tree  engine.5 This makes RocksDB a good storage plugin for applications that need high write per- formance, such as social media applications. MongoDB can be built with RocksDB sup- port so that you can also enjoy the performance of RocksDB. For more information on how to do this, check out the announcement on the RocksDB blog.6   Tokutek’s TokuFT  formerly known as TokuKV  is another key-value store that uses fractal tree indexing7 instead of the default B-tree data structure used in WiredTiger.  5 Log Structure Merge trees are data structures that outperform B-trees in the most useful record updating sce- narios. The WiredTiger team compared B-trees vs. LSM trees: https:  github.com wiredtiger wiredtiger  wiki Btree-vs-LSM. For more information on LSM trees, see https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Log-structured _merge-tree.   6 See http:  rocksdb.org blog 1967 integrating-rocksdb-with-mongodb-2  for more information. 7 Fractal tree indexing is a Tokutek innovation that keeps write performance consistent while your data set  grows larger. See http:  www.tokutek.com resources technology .   www.it-ebooks.info   290  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage  Before  MongoDB  version  3.0,  Tokutek  offered  a  fork  of  MongoDB  called  TokuMX, which uses their TokuFT technology as the storage engine. Because MongoDB supports pluggable storage engines, Tokutek is offering a storage engine–only solution based on the MongoDB Pluggable Storage API, called TokuMXse,8 where se stands for stor- age  engine.  While  the  TokuMX  fork  incorporates  many  features,  such  as  clustering indexes and fast read-free updates by updating the MongoDB codebase, the TokuMXse version can’t have them because of how the Pluggable Storage Engine API is currently designed. In this sense, TokuMXse will empower your standard MongoDB installation with reliably high-performance storage and compression.   Tokutek has been acquired by Percona, so all the TokuFT-related development will be  done  by  Percona.  Percona  has  announced  an  experimental  build  of  MongoDB using TokuMXse.9   A last example that’s familiar to MySQL users is InnoDB. This engine is used by MySQL as an alternative to the sequential MyISAM storage engine. InnoDB makes use of a transaction log that’s replayed when a crash has occurred to get the latest opera- tions from before the crash synchronized to disk, similar to how journaling works in WiredTiger and MMAPv1. MyISAM has to go through the whole database after a crash to repair any indexes or tables that haven’t been flushed to disk, and as the database grows in size, this has an impact on the availability of the database. InnoDB doesn’t have  that  problem  and  therefore  offers  better  availability  on  bigger  databases.  The InnoDB technology isn’t partial to MySQL. There’s a fork from InnoDB called XtraDB, which is used by MariaDB, and it’s possible that there will be an InnoDB module for MongoDB in the future.  10.5 Advanced topics  In this section we’ll talk about the more advanced topics to get a better understanding of how storage engines work and why there are so many different ones with different technologies out there. The material covered in this section is absolutely not neces- sary to get a MongoDB instance running with one of the storage engines, but provides nice background information for those who are curious to know more.  10.5.1 How does a pluggable storage engine work?  The MongoDB source code comes with special classes to deal with storage modules. At the time of writing, the MongoDB source code was exposing the following classes:    StorageEngine—A virtual class that forms the basis of the storage engines   MMAPV1Engine—The MMAPv1 storage engine plugin class   KVStorageEngine—The key-value-based storage engine class  8 Announced in January 2015 by Tokutek: http:  www.tokutek.com 2015 01 announcing-tokumxse-v1-0-0-rc-0 . 9 Percona  announcement  in  May  2015:  https:  www.percona.com blog 2015 05 08 mongodb-percona-  tokumxse-experimental-build-rc5-available .   www.it-ebooks.info   Advanced topics  291    KVEngine—The key-value engine that’s used by the KVStorageEngine class   MMAPV1DatabaseCatalogEntry—The  catalog  entry  class  for  MMAPv1-based  databases    RecordStore—The base class for record store objects   RecordStoreV1Base—The  base  class  for  MMAPv1  record  store  objects;  the  MMAPV1DatabaseCatalogEntry uses these    WiredTigerKVEngine—The WiredTiger engine   WiredTigerFactory—The  factory  class  that  creates  a  KVStorageEngine  that  uses the WiredTigerKVEngine class for its key-value engine    WiredTigerRecordStore—The  record  store  class  that’s  used  by  the  WiredTi-  gerKVEngine class  You can see these classes in figure 10.2.

The storage engine at the top—This works as the interface for MongoDB to the stor-    The storage management—This is the catalog entry class in the MMAPv1 case, and  the key-value store  KVEngine  in the key-value-based storage engine case.    The  record  store—This  manages  the  actual  MongoDB  data,  such  as  collections and entries. At this level, it communicates with the actual storage engine for the CRUD operations.  Together,  these  levels  form  the  translator,  if  you  will,  between  how  MongoDB  sees their data structures and how the storage engines store them. What MongoDB cares about  is  its  own  data  structure—BSON—and  its  own  scripting  language  based  on JavaScript,  which  is  used  by  the  MongoDB  drivers  to  communicate  with  MongoDB. How the data is stored or collected is left to the storage engine.  In  the  MongoDB  Pluggable  Storage  Engine  API  there  are  base  classes  for  key-value storage  systems.  A  key-value  storage  system  is  a  storage  system  that  guarantees  fast access to the records by looking up the keys in the collection. You can tell the storage system to index certain keys for faster lookup.   A common data structure for storing such key-value data is a B-tree, which is also used in the WiredTiger storage plugin. B-trees were invented by Rudolf Bayer and Ed McCreight while working at Boeing Research Labs. There are speculations that the B in B-tree stands for Bayer, named after Rudolf Bayer, but others say that it stands for Boeing, where it was developed. In any case, the origin of the name is a mystery, but what’s more interesting is how it works.   The power of the B-tree lies in the fact that disk-based storage is done in blocks. Each piece of data that’s stored on disk is put in a block on the filesystem. In a real- world situation, these blocks are usually 4 KB in size, which is the default for many file- systems such as ExtFS and NTFS. A larger block size will allow for much larger files to be stored on the disk, but then we’re talking about files larger than 4 TB.   A B-tree storage system uses these blocks as its nodes to store the indexes to the data elements. Each node can hold at most 4096 bytes of index information, and this index  information  is  basically  sorted.  In  the  following  examples,  assume  that  each node can hold at most three indexes, but keep in mind that in a real-world example that number is much larger.   A B-tree starts with a root node, and within this node, you can store data records using their keys. These data records may have pointers to the actual value assigned to the key, or may have that value inside the data record. The more interesting part is how these records are found, because that’s what needs to be done fast. Each node has several data records, indexed by an index key, and between each record, there’s a diamond  that’s  a  placeholder  for  a  pointer  to  another  node  containing  other  data  www.it-ebooks.info   Advanced topics  293  records. The diamond placeholder to the left of the 12 goes to a whole tree of data records with index values less than 12. Similarly, the whole tree that’s pointed to by the diamond between 12 and 65 contains records with index values all between 12 and 65. This way, when doing a search, an algorithm will quickly know which node to tra- verse into.   For this to work well, it’s important that the index keys in each node of a B-tree structure be sorted. To optimize the disk seek times, it’s preferable to store as much data as you can within a node that’s optimally the same size as a disk block; in most real-world examples this size is 4096 bytes.   Imagine an empty database with an empty root node. You start adding records with certain keys in an arbitrary order, and once the node becomes full, you create new nodes for the next data records to be added. Let’s say you have the following keys to be added in this order:  { 2, 63, 42, 48, 1, 62, 4, 24, 8, 23, 58, 99, 38, 41, 81, 30, 17, 47, 66 }  Remember that you use a maximum node size of three elements. You’ll have a root node with the keys shown in figure 10.3, which are the first three elements from the example sequence, in sorted order.  2  42  63  Figure 10.3 Root node with three elements  When  you  add  the  fourth  element  from  the sequence, which is 48, it will create a new node between 42 and 63, and put 48 there, because 48 is between 42 and 63. The next element, 1, will be in the node before 2, because 1 is less than 2. Then  the  next  element,  62,  will  join  48  in  its node,  because  62  lies  between  42  and  63.  The following three keys—4, 24, and 8—will go into the  node  that’s  pointed  to  between  2  and  42, because  these  numbers  are  all  between  2  and 42. Within this new node, the keys will be sorted, as  is  always  the  case  within  nodes.  After  these first steps, the node tree graph will look like fig- ure  10.4.  Note  how  the  numbers  are  sorted within each node.  2  42  63  1  48  62  4  8  24  Figure 10.4 Early version of B-tree   You continue along the sequence. The next key, 23, is between 2 and 42 and will go into the node containing 4, 8, and 24, but because that node is already full, it will go into a new node between 8 and 24, because 23 is between 8 and 24. Then the next one, 58, will join 48 and 62. Key 99 will be in a new node pointed to after 63, because  www.it-ebooks.info   294  CHAPTER 10 WiredTiger and pluggable storage  99 is more than 63. Key 38, being between 2 and 42, will visit the node containing 4, 8, and 24, but because that node is full, it will go into a new node after 24, because 38 is more than 24. Key 41 joins key 38 in that new node at the second level. Key 81 joins 99, and 30 joins 38 and 41. Key 17 joins key 23 in the second-level node. Key 47 lies between 42 and 63, and so it goes to the node that holds 48, 58, and 62. Because that node is already full, it goes a level deeper, into a node before 48. Finally, key 66 will join 81 and 99, because 66 is more than 63. The final structure will look like figure 10.5, with the keys in each node in a sorted order.   2  42  63  1  48  58  62  47  66  81  99  4  8  24  17  23  30  38  41  Figure 10.5 Final version of B-tree  10.5.3 Locking  Because the nodes contain the data in a sorted order, you will find out where you have to be very quickly. It will also be very fast at adding new records into the tree, as it will traverse through the tree at the same speed as finding a record, until it finds a free slot in a node, or until it needs to create a new node from a full node.  In  the  early  days  of  MongoDB,  locking  was  done  for  every  connection,  on  a  server level, using mutexes  mutual exclusions , a mechanism that ensures that multiple cli- ents or threads can access the same resource—in this case, the database server—but not simultaneously. This is the worst method of locking, especially if you want to be a Big Data database engine, accessed by thousands of clients at the same time.    This  changed  with  version  2.2,  which  is  when  database-level  locking  was  imple- mented. The mutexes were applied on databases instead of on the whole MongoDB server  instance,  which  was  an  improvement.  But  MongoDB  threads  would  try  to acquire subsequent write locks in a queue and deal with them in a serial fashion, let- ting  the  threads  continue  whenever  the  currently  locking  thread  released  its  lock. While in a small-sized database, this can be rather fast, without any significant perfor- mance impact; in larger databases with thousands of write requests per second, this will become problematic and degrade the application’s performance.  www.it-ebooks.info   10.6 Summary  Summary  295   This changed with MongoDB version 3.0, which introduced collection-level lock- ing for the MMAPv1 storage engine. This moved the locking mechanism a level lower, to collections. This means that multiple requests will be served simultaneously, with- out blocking each other, as long as they’re writing into different collections.   With WiredTiger in version 3.0, MongoDB also supports document-level locking. This is an even more granular level of locking—multiple requests can now access the same  collection  simultaneously  without  blocking  each  other,  as  long  as  they  aren’t writing into the same document.  MongoDB version 3.0 introduced the concept of a pluggable storage engine architec- ture, and in this chapter you’ve seen what this entails and what it means for the system administrator or the application developer working with MongoDB. A real-world com- parison has been given between a news site and a social network platform, both having different requirements for their database systems.    We  compared  the  default  engine  that  MongoDB  used  in  previous  versions, MMAPv1,  with  the  newly  bundled  WiredTiger  engine.  WiredTiger  performs  well  in both read and write operations, and offers document-level locking, whereas MMAPv1 doesn’t go further than collection-level locking. WiredTiger isn’t as greedy as MMAPv1 in terms of disk use, and it makes MongoDB a viable database system, even for small- scale applications. While MMAPv1 may be faster in certain situations, the performance versus  cost  ratio  that  WiredTiger  offers  far  outweighs  the  performance  versus  cost ratio for MMAPv1.   While this comparison is based on a simple benchmark kit to give you a general idea of what benchmarking scripts do, it should give you insight into how to do your own benchmarks specific to your application’s use case. The benchmarks are simple without taking into account several environmental factors, such as the hardware and software   OS  kernel   configuration  of  your  system.  Tweaking  these  may  affect  the results of your benchmarks, so be cautious when comparing the results of the differ- ent storage engines.   You also learned about a few other storage engine platforms such as RocksDB and TokuFT, both of which are still in the experimental phase, but offer interesting fea- tures, because RocksDB is based on LSM trees and TokuFT is based on fractal trees. It will be interesting to see how they perform against WiredTiger in different situations.  You also read about some advanced concepts that come into play when designing a storage engine. Maximizing read and write performance, minimizing disk  I O, and offering optimal concurrency by using smart locking mechanisms on higher levels all play a crucial role in developing a storage engine.   Enough with the theory; the topic of the next chapter is used in true production  databases—replication.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replication  This chapter covers   Understanding basic replication concepts   Connecting a driver to a replica set   Administering replica sets and handling failover   Increasing the durability of writes with write   concerns    Optimizing your reads with the read preference   Managing complex replica sets using tagging  Replication is central to most database management systems because of one inevita- ble fact: failures happen. If you want your live production data to be available even after a failure, you need to be sure that your production databases are available on more  than  one  machine.  Replication  provides  data  protection,  high  availability, and disaster recovery.   We’ll begin this chapter by introducing replication and discussing its main use cases.  Then  we’ll  cover  MongoDB’s  replication  through  a  detailed  study  of  replica sets. Finally, we’ll describe how to connect to replicated MongoDB clusters using the drivers, how to use write concerns, and how to load-balance reads across replicas.  296  www.it-ebooks.info   11.1 Replication overview  Replication overview  297  Replication  is  the  distribution  and  maintenance  of  data  across  multiple  MongoDB servers  nodes . MongoDB can copy your data to one or more nodes and constantly keep them in sync when changes occur. This type of replication is provided through a mechanism called replica sets, in which a group of nodes are configured to automati- cally  synchronize  their  data  and  fail  over  when  a  node  disappears.  MongoDB  also supports an older method of replication called master-slave, which is now considered deprecated, but master-slave replication is still supported and can be used in MongoDB v3.0. For both methods, a single primary node receives all writes, and then all second- ary nodes read and apply those writes to themselves asynchronously.   Master-slave replication and replica sets use the same replication mechanism, but replica sets additionally ensure automated failover: if the primary node goes offline for any reason, one of the secondary nodes will automatically be promoted to pri- mary, if possible. Replica sets provide other enhancements too, such as easier recov- ery and more sophisticated deployment topologies. For these reasons you’d rarely want to use simple master-slave replication.1 Replica sets are thus the recommended replication strategy for production deployments; we’ll devote the bulk of this chap- ter to explanations and examples of replica sets, with only a brief overview of master- slave replication.   It’s also important to understand the pitfalls of replication, most importantly the possibility of a rollback. In a replica set, data isn’t considered truly committed until it’s been written to a majority of member nodes, which means more than 50% of the serv- ers; therefore, if your replica set has only two servers, this means that no server can be down. If the primary node in a replica set fails before it replicates its data, other mem- bers will continue accepting writes, and any unreplicated data must be rolled back, meaning it can no longer be read. We’ll describe this scenario in detail next.   11.1.1 Why replication matters  All databases are vulnerable to failures of the environments in which they run. Repli- cation provides a kind of insurance against these failures. What sort of failure are we talking about? Here are some of the more common scenarios:    The network connection between the application and the database is lost.   Planned downtime prevents the server from coming back online as expected. Most hosting providers must schedule occasional downtime, and the results of this downtime aren’t always easy to predict. A simple reboot will keep a data- base server offline for at least a few minutes. Then there’s the question of what happens when the reboot is complete. For example, newly installed software or  1 The only time you should opt for MongoDB’s master-slave replication is when you’d require more than 51 slave nodes, because a replica set can have no more than 50 members, which should never happen under nor- mal circumstances.  www.it-ebooks.info   298  CHAPTER 11 Replication  hardware can prevent MongoDB or even the operating system from starting up properly.    There’s a loss of power. Although most modern datacenters feature redundant power supplies, nothing prevents user error within the datacenter itself or an extended brownout or blackout from shutting down your database server.    A hard drive fails on the database server. Hard drives have a mean time to failure of a few years and fail more often than you might think.2 Even if it’s acceptable to have occasional downtime for your MongoDB, it’s probably not acceptable to lose your data if a hard drive fails. It’s a good idea to have at least one copy of your data, which replication provides.  In addition to protecting against external failures, replication has been particularly important  for  MongoDB’s  durability.  When  running  without  journaling  enabled, MongoDB’s data files aren’t guaranteed to be free of corruption in the event of an unclean shutdown—with journaling enabled data files can’t get corrupted. Without journaling, replication should always be run to guarantee a clean copy of the data files if a single node shuts down hard.   Of course, replication is desirable even when running with journaling. After all, you  still  want  high  availability  and  fast  failover.  In  this  case,  journaling  expedites recovery because it allows you to bring failed nodes back online simply by replaying the journal. This is much faster than resyncing from an existing replica to recover from failure.   It’s important to note that although they’re redundant, replicas aren’t a replace- ment for backups. A backup represents a snapshot of the database at a particular time in the past, whereas a replica is always up to date. There are cases where a data set is large enough to render backups impractical, but as a general rule, backups are pru- dent and recommended even when running with replication. In other words, backups are there in case of a logical failure such as an accidental data loss or data corruption.  We highly recommend running a production MongoDB instance with both repli- cation and journaling, unless you’re prepared to lose data; to do otherwise should be  considered  poor  deployment  practice.  When   not  if   your  application  experi- ences  a  failure,  work  invested  in  thinking  through  and  setting  up  replication  will pay dividends.  11.1.2 Replication use cases and limitations  You may be surprised at how versatile a replicated database can be. In particular, repli- cation facilitates redundancy, failover, maintenance, and load balancing. Let’s take a brief look at each of these use cases.   Replication is designed primarily for redundancy. It ensures that replicated nodes stay in sync with the primary node. These replicas can live in the same datacenter as  2 You can read a detailed analysis of consumer hard drive failure rates in Google’s article “Failure Trends in a  Large Disk Drive Population”  http:  research.google.com archive disk_failures.pdf .  www.it-ebooks.info   Replication overview  299  the primary, or they can be distributed geographically as an additional failsafe. Because replication is asynchronous, any sort of network latency or partition between nodes will  have  no  effect  on  the  performance  of  the  primary.  As  another  form  of  redun- dancy, replicated nodes can also be delayed by a constant number of seconds, min- utes,  or  even  hours  behind  the  primary.  This  provides  insurance  against  the  case where a user inadvertently drops a collection or an application somehow corrupts the database. Normally, these operations will be replicated immediately; a delayed replica gives administrators time to react and possibly save their data.    Another  use  case  for  replication  is  failover.  You  want  your  systems  to  be  highly available, but this is possible only with redundant nodes and the ability to switch over to those nodes in an emergency. Conveniently, MongoDB’s replica sets almost always make this switch automatically.    In  addition  to  providing  redundancy  and  failover,  replication  simplifies  mainte- nance, usually by allowing you to run expensive operations on a node other than the primary. For example, it’s common practice to run backups on a secondary node to keep unnecessary load off the primary and to avoid downtime. Building large indexes is another example. Because index builds are expensive, you may opt to build on a secondary  node  first,  swap  the  secondary  with  the  existing  primary,  and  then  build again on the new secondary.    Finally,  replication  allows  you  to  balance  reads  across  replicas.  For  applications whose workloads are overwhelmingly read-heavy, this is the easiest, or if you prefer, the most naïve, way to scale MongoDB. But for all its promise, a replica set doesn’t help much if any of the following apply:    The  allotted  hardware  can’t  process  the  given  workload.  As  an  example,  we mentioned  working  sets  in  the  previous  chapter.  If  your  working  data  set  is much larger than the available RAM, then sending random reads to the second- aries likely won’t improve your performance as much as you might hope. In this scenario, performance becomes constrained by the number of I O operations per second  IOPS  your disk can handle—generally around 80–100 for non-SSD hard drives. Reading from a replica increases your total IOPS, but going from 100 to 200 IOPS may not solve your performance problems, especially if writes are occurring at the same time and consuming a portion of that number. In this case, sharding may be a better option.    The ratio of writes to reads exceeds 50%. This is an admittedly arbitrary ratio, but it’s a reasonable place to start. The issue here is that every write to the pri- mary must eventually be written to all the secondaries as well. Therefore, direct- ing  reads  to  secondaries  that  are  already  processing  a  lot  of  writes  can sometimes  slow  the  replication  process  and  may  not  result  in  increased  read throughput.    The application requires consistent reads. Secondary nodes replicate asynchro- nously  and  therefore  aren’t  guaranteed  to  reflect  the  latest  writes  to  the  pri- mary node. In pathological cases, secondaries can run hours behind. As we’ll  www.it-ebooks.info   300  CHAPTER 11 Replication  explain later, you can guarantee your writes go to secondaries before returning to the driver, but this approach carries a latency cost.  Replica sets are excellent for scaling reads that don’t require immediate consistency, but they won’t help in every situation. If you need to scale and any of the preceding conditions apply, then you’ll need a different strategy, involving sharding, augmented hardware, or some combination of the two.  11.2 Replica sets  Replica sets are the recommended MongoDB replication strategy. We’ll start by con- figuring a sample replica set. We’ll then describe how replication works because this knowledge  is  incredibly  important  for  diagnosing  production  issues.  We’ll  end  by discussing  advanced  configuration  details,  failover  and  recovery,  and  best  deploy- ment practices.  11.2.1 Setup  The  minimum  recommended  replica  set  configuration  consists  of  three  nodes, because in a replica set with only two nodes you can’t have a majority in case the pri- mary server goes down. A three-member replica set can have either three members that hold data or two members that hold data and an arbiter. The primary is the only member in the set that can accept write operations. Replica set members go through a process in which they “elect” a new master by voting. If a primary becomes unavail- able, elections allow the set to recover normal operations without manual interven- tion. Unfortunately, if a majority of the replica set is inaccessible or unavailable, the replica set cannot accept writes and all remaining members become read-only. You may consider adding an arbiter to a replica set if it has an equal number of nodes in two places where network partitions between the places are possible. In such cases, the arbiter will break the tie between the two facilities and allow the set to elect a new primary.   In the minimal configuration, two of these three nodes serve as first-class, persis- tent mongod instances. Either can act as the replica set primary, and both have a full copy of the data. The third node in the set is an arbiter, which doesn’t replicate data but merely acts as a kind of observer. Arbiters are lightweight mongod servers that par- ticipate in the election of a primary but don’t replicate any of the data. You can see an illustration  of  the  replica  set  you’re  about  to  set  up  in  figure  11.1.  The  arbiter  is located at the secondary data center on the right.   Now let’s create a simple three-node replica set to demonstrate how to do it. Nor- mally you would create a replica set with each member on a separate machine. To keep this tutorial simple, we’re going to start all three on a single machine. Each MongoDB instance  we  start  is  identified  by  its  hostname  and  its  port;  running  the  set  locally means that when we connect, we’ll use the local hostname for all three and start each on a separate port.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  301  Primary datacenter  Secondary datacenter  Replication  Ping  Arbiter  Secondary  Primary  Ping  Ping  Figure 11.1 A basic  replica set consisting of  a primary, a secondary,  and an arbiter  Begin by creating a data directory for each replica set member:  mkdir ~ node1 mkdir ~ node2 mkdir ~ arbiter  Next, start each member as a separate mongod. Because you’ll run each process on the same machine, it’s easiest to start each mongod in a separate terminal window:  mongod --replSet myapp --dbpath ~ node1 --port 40000 mongod --replSet myapp --dbpath ~ node2 --port 40001 mongod --replSet myapp --dbpath ~ arbiter --port 40002  Note how we tell each mongod that it will be a member of the myapp replica set and that we start each mongod on a separate port. If you examine the mongod log output, the first thing you’ll notice are error messages saying that the configuration can’t be found. This is completely normal:  [rsStart] replSet info you may need to run replSetInitiate      -- rs.initiate   in the shell -- if that is not already done [rsStart] replSet can't get local.system.replset config from self      or any seed  EMPTYCONFIG   On MongoDB v3.0 the log message will be similar to the following:  2015-09-15T16:27:21.088+0300 I REPL     [initandlisten] Did not find local  replica set configuration document at startup;  NoMatchingDocument Did not  find replica set configuration document in local.system.replset  To proceed, you need to configure the replica set. Do so by first connecting to one of the  non-arbiter  mongods  just  started.  These  instances  aren’t  running  on  MongoDB’s default port, so connect to one by running  mongo --port 40000  www.it-ebooks.info   302  CHAPTER 11 Replication  These examples were produced running these mongod processes locally, so you’ll see the name of the example machine, iron, pop up frequently; substitute your own hostname.   Connect, and then run the rs.initiate   command:3   > rs.initiate   {     "info2" : "no configuration explicitly specified -- making one",     "me" : "iron.local:40000",     "info" : "Config now saved locally.  Should come online in about a   minute.",      "ok" : 1 }  On MongoDB v3.0 the output will be similar to the following:  {     "info2" : "no configuration explicitly specified -- making one",     "me" : "iron.local:40000",     "ok" : 1 }  Within a minute or so, you’ll have a one-member replica set. You can now add the other two members using rs.add  :   > rs.add "iron.local:40001"  { "ok" : 1 } > rs.add "iron.local:40002", {arbiterOnly: true}  { "ok" : 1 }  On MongoDB v3.0 you can also add an arbiter with the following command:  > rs.addArb "iron.local:40002"  { "ok" : 1 }  Note that for the second node, you specify the arbiterOnly option to create an arbi- ter. Within a minute, all members should be online. To get a brief summary of the rep- lica set status, run the db.isMaster   command:  > db.isMaster   {   "setName" : "myapp",   "ismaster" : true,   "secondary" : false,   "hosts" : [     "iron.local:40001",     "iron.local:40000"   ],  3 Some users have reported trouble with this step because they have the line bind_ip = 127.0.0.1 in their mongod.conf file at  etc mongod.conf or  usr local etc mongod.conf. If initiating the replica set prints an error, look for and remove that configuration.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  303  The same command produces the following output on a MongoDB v3.0 machine:    "arbiters" : [     "iron.local:40002"   ],   "primary" : "iron.local:40000",   "me" : "iron.local:40000",   "maxBsonObjectSize" : 16777216,   "maxMessageSizeBytes" : 48000000,   "localTime" : ISODate "2013-11-06T05:53:25.538Z" ,   "ok" : 1 }  myapp:PRIMARY> db.isMaster   {     "setName" : "myapp",     "setVersion" : 5,     "ismaster" : true,     "secondary" : false,     "hosts" : [         "iron.local:40000",         "iron.local:40001"     ],     "arbiters" : [         "iron.local:40002"     ],     "primary" : "iron.local:40000",     "me" : "iron.local:40000",     "electionId" : ObjectId "55f81dd44a50a01e0e3b4ede" ,     "maxBsonObjectSize" : 16777216,     "maxMessageSizeBytes" : 48000000,     "maxWriteBatchSize" : 1000,     "localTime" : ISODate "2015-09-15T13:37:13.798Z" ,     "maxWireVersion" : 3,     "minWireVersion" : 0,     "ok" : 1 }  > rs.status   {   "set" : "myapp",   "date" : ISODate "2013-11-07T17:01:29Z" ,   "myState" : 1,   "members" : [     {       "_id" : 0,       "name" : "iron.local:40000",       "health" : 1,       "state" : 1,       "stateStr" : "PRIMARY",       "uptime" : 1099,  www.it-ebooks.info  A more detailed view of the system is provided by the rs.status   method.

During this time, the stateStr field of each node should transition from RECOVERING to PRIMARY, SECONDARY, or ARBITER.   Now even if the replica set status claims that replication is working, you may want to see some empirical evidence of this. Go ahead and connect to the primary node with the shell and insert a document:  $ mongo --port 40000 myapp:PRIMARY> use bookstore switched to db bookstore myapp:PRIMARY> db.books.insert {title: "Oliver Twist"}  myapp:PRIMARY> show dbs bookstore 0.203125GB local 0.203125GB  Notice  how  the  MongoDB  shell  prints  out  the  replica  set  membership  status  of  the instance it’s connected to.   www.it-ebooks.info   306  CHAPTER 11 Replication   Initial replication of your data should occur almost immediately. In another termi- nal window, open a new shell instance, but this, time point it to the secondary node. Query for the document just inserted; it should have arrived:  $ mongo --port 40001 myapp:SECONDARY> show dbs bookstore 0.203125GB local 0.203125GB myapp:SECONDARY> use bookstore  switched to db bookstore myapp:SECONDARY> rs.slaveOk   myapp:SECONDARY> db.books.find   { "_id" : ObjectId "4d42ebf28e3c0c32c06bdf20" , "title" : "Oliver Twist" }  If replication is working as displayed here, you’ve successfully configured your rep- lica set. By default, MongoDB attempts to protect you from accidentally querying a secondary  because  this  data  will  be  less  current  than  the  primary,  where  writes occur. You must explicitly allow reads from the secondary in the shell by running rs.slaveOk  .   It should be satisfying to see replication in action, but perhaps more interesting is automated failover. Let’s test that now and kill a node. You could kill the secondary, but that merely stops replication, with the remaining nodes maintaining their current status. If you want to see a change of system state, you need to kill the primary. If the primary is running in the foreground of your shell, you can kill it by pressing Ctrl-C; if it’s running in the background, then get its process ID from the mongod.lock file in ~ node1 and run kill -3  . You can also connect to the primary using the shell and run commands to shut down the server:  $ mongo --port 40000  PRIMARY> use admin PRIMARY> db.shutdownServer    Once you’ve killed the primary, note that the secondary detects the lapse in the pri- mary’s  heartbeat.  The  secondary  then  elects  itself  primary.  This  election  is  possible because a majority of the original nodes  the arbiter and the original secondary  are still able to ping each other. Here’s an excerpt from the secondary node’s log:  Thu Nov  7 09:23:23.091 [rsHealthPoll] replset info iron.local:40000     heartbeat failed, retrying Thu Nov  7 09:23:23.091 [rsHealthPoll] replSet info iron.local:40000      is down  or slow to respond : Thu Nov  7 09:23:23.091 [rsHealthPoll] replSet member iron.local:40000      is now in state DOWN Thu Nov  7 09:23:23.092 [rsMgr] replSet info electSelf 1 Thu Nov  7 09:23:23.202 [rsMgr] replSet PRIMARY  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  307  If you connect to the new primary node and check the replica set status, you’ll see that the old primary is unreachable:  $ mongo --port 40001  > rs.status   ...   {     "_id" : 0,     "name" : "iron.local:40000",     "health" : 0,     "state" : 8,     "stateStr" : " not reachable healthy ",     "uptime" : 0,     "optime" : Timestamp 1383844267, 1 ,     "optimeDate" : ISODate "2013-11-07T17:11:07Z" ,     "lastHeartbeat" : ISODate "2013-11-07T17:30:00Z" ,     "lastHeartbeatRecv" : ISODate "2013-11-07T17:23:21Z" ,     "pingMs" : 0   }, ...  Post-failover,  the  replica  set  consists  of  only  two  nodes.  Because  the  arbiter  has  no data, your application will continue to function as long as it communicates with the primary node only.4 Even so, replication isn’t happening, and there’s now no possibil- ity of failover. The old primary must be restored. Assuming that the old primary was shut down cleanly, you can bring it back online, and it’ll automatically rejoin the rep- lica set as a secondary. Go ahead and try that now by restarting the old primary node.   That’s  a  quick  overview  of  replica  sets.  Some  of  the  details  are,  unsurprisingly, messier. In the next two sections, you’ll see how replica sets work and look at deploy- ment, advanced configuration, and how to handle tricky scenarios that may arise in production.  11.2.2 How replication works  Replica sets rely on two basic mechanisms: an oplog and a heartbeat. The oplog enables the replication of data, and the heartbeat monitors health and triggers failover. You’ll now see how both of these mechanisms work in turn. You should begin to understand and predict replica set behavior, particularly in failure scenarios. ALL ABOUT THE OPLOG At the heart of MongoDB’s replication stands the oplog. The oplog is a capped collec- tion  that  lives  in  a  database  called  local  on  every  replicating  node  and  records  all changes to the data. Every time a client writes to the primary, an entry with enough information  to  reproduce  the  write  is  automatically  added  to  the  primary’s  oplog. Once the write is replicated to a given secondary, that secondary’s oplog also stores a  4 Applications sometimes query secondary nodes for read scaling. If that’s happening, this kind of failure will cause read failures,sSo it’s important to design your application with failover in mind. More on this at the end of the chapter.  www.it-ebooks.info   308  CHAPTER 11 Replication  record of the write. Each oplog entry is identified with a BSON timestamp, and all sec- ondaries use the timestamp to keep track of the latest entry they’ve applied.5   To better see how this works, let’s look more closely at a real oplog and at the oper- ations recorded in it. First connect with the shell to the primary node started in the previous section and switch to the local database:  myapp:PRIMARY> use local switched to db local  The local database stores all the replica set metadata and the oplog. Naturally, this database isn’t replicated itself. Thus it lives up to its name; data in the local database is supposed to be unique to the local node and therefore shouldn’t be replicated.   If you examine the local database, you’ll see a collection called oplog.rs, which is where every replica set stores its oplog. You’ll also see a few system collections. Here’s the complete output:   myapp:PRIMARY> show collections me oplog.rs replset.minvalid slaves startup_log system.indexes system.replset  replset.minvalid  contains  information  for  the  initial  sync  of  a  given  replica  set member, and system.replset stores the replica set config document. Not all of your mongod servers will have the replset.minvalid collection. me and slaves are used to implement write concerns, described at the end of this chapter, and system.indexes is the standard index spec container.   First we’ll focus on the oplog. Let’s query for the oplog entry corresponding to the book  document  you  added  in  the  previous  section.  To  do  so,  enter  the  following query. The resulting document will have four fields, and we’ll discuss each in turn:  > db.oplog.rs.findOne {op: "i"}  {   "ts" : Timestamp 1383844267, 1 ,   "h" : NumberLong "-305734463742602323" ,   "v" : 2,   "op" : "i",   "ns" : "bookstore.books",   "o" : {     "_id" : ObjectId "527bc9aac2595f18349e4154" ,     "title" : "Oliver Twist"   } }  5 The BSON timestamp is a unique identifier consisting of the number of seconds since the epoch and an incre-  menting counter. For more details, see http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Unix_time.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  309  The  first  field,  ts,  stores  the  entry’s  BSON  timestamp.  The  timestamp  includes  two numbers; the first representing the seconds since epoch and the second representing a counter value—1 in this case. To query with a timestamp, you need to explicitly con- struct a timestamp object. All the drivers have their own BSON timestamp construc- tors, and so does JavaScript. Here’s how to use it:  db.oplog.rs.findOne {ts: Timestamp 1383844267, 1 }   Returning to the oplog entry, the op field specifies the opcode. This tells the second- ary node which operation the oplog entry represents. Here you see an i, indicating an insert. After op comes ns to signify the relevant namespace  database and collection  and  then  the  lowercase  letter  o,  which  for  insert  operations  contains  a  copy  of  the inserted document.   As you examine oplog entries, you may notice that operations affecting multiple documents  are  analyzed  into  their  component  parts.  For  multi-updates  and  mass deletes,  a  separate  entry  is  created  in  the  oplog  for  each  document  affected.  For example, suppose you add a few more Dickens books to the collection:  myapp:PRIMARY> use bookstore myapp:PRIMARY> db.books.insert {title: "A Tale of Two Cities"}  myapp:PRIMARY> db.books.insert {title: "Great Expectations"}   Now with four books in the collection, let’s issue a multi-update to set the author’s name:  myapp:PRIMARY> db.books.update {}, {$set: {author: "Dickens {multi:true}   How does this appear in the oplog?  myapp:PRIMARY> use local myapp:PRIMARY> db.oplog.rs.find {op: "u"}  {    "ts" : Timestamp 1384128758, 1 ,    "h" : NumberLong "5431582342821118204" ,    "v" : 2,    "op" : "u",    "ns" : "bookstore.books",    "o2" : {      "_id" : ObjectId "527bc9aac2595f18349e4154"     },    "o" : {      "$set" : {        "author" : "Dickens"      }    }  } {    "ts" : Timestamp 1384128758, 2 ,    "h" : NumberLong "3897436474689294423" ,    "v" : 2,    "op" : "u",    "ns" : "bookstore.books",   www.it-ebooks.info   310  CHAPTER 11 Replication    "o2" : {      "_id" : ObjectId "528020a9f3f61863aba207e7"     },    "o" : {      "$set" : {        "author" : "Dickens"      }    }  } {    "ts" : Timestamp 1384128758, 3 ,    "h" : NumberLong "2241781384783113" ,    "v" : 2,    "op" : "u",    "ns" : "bookstore.books",    "o2" : {      "_id" : ObjectId "528020a9f3f61863aba207e8"     },    "o" : {      "$set" : {        "author" : "Dickens"      }    }  }  As you can see, each updated document gets its own oplog entry. This normalization is done as part of the more general strategy of ensuring that secondaries always end up with the same data as the primary. To guarantee this, every applied operation must be idempotent—it can’t matter how many times a given oplog entry is applied. The result must always be the same. But the secondaries must apply the oplog entries in the same order  as  they  were  generated  for  the  oplog.  Other  multidocument  operations,  like deletes, will exhibit the same behavior. You can try different operations and see how they ultimately appear in the oplog.   To get some basic information about the oplog’s current status, you can run the  shell’s db.getReplicationInfo   method:   myapp:PRIMARY> db.getReplicationInfo   {   "logSizeMB" : 192,   "usedMB" : 0.01,   "timeDiff" : 286197,   "timeDiffHours" : 79.5,   "tFirst" : "Thu Nov 07 2013 08:42:41 GMT-0800  PST ",   "tLast" : "Sun Nov 10 2013 16:12:38 GMT-0800  PST ",   "now" : "Sun Nov 10 2013 16:19:49 GMT-0800  PST " }  Here you see the timestamps of the first and last entries in this oplog. You can find these oplog entries manually by using the $natural sort modifier. For example, the following query fetches the latest entry:   db.oplog.rs.find  .sort {$natural: -1}  .limit 1   www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  311  The only important thing left to understand about replication is how the secondaries keep track of their place in the oplog. The answer lies in the fact that secondaries also keep an oplog. This is a significant improvement upon master-slave replication, so it’s worth taking a moment to explore the rationale.   Imagine you issue a write to the primary node of a replica set. What happens next? First, the write is recorded and then added to the primary’s oplog. Meanwhile, all sec- ondaries have their own oplogs that replicate the primary’s oplog. When a given second- ary node is ready to update itself, it does three things. First, it looks at the timestamp of the latest entry in its own oplog. Next, it queries the primary’s oplog for all entries greater than that timestamp. Finally, it writes the data and adds each of those entries to its own oplog.6 This means that in case of failover, any secondary promoted to pri- mary will have an oplog that the other secondaries can replicate from. This feature essentially enables replica set recovery.   Secondary nodes use long polling to immediately apply new entries from the pri- mary’s oplog. Long polling means the secondary makes a long-lived request to the primary.  When  the  primary  receives  a  modification,  it  responds  to  the  waiting request immediately. Thus, secondaries will usually be almost completely up to date. When they do fall behind because of network partitions or maintenance on second- aries,  the  latest  timestamp  in  each  secondary’s  oplog  can  be  used  to  monitor  any replication lag.   Master-slave replication Master-slave replication is the original replication paradigm in MongoDB. This flavor of replication is easy to configure and has the advantage of supporting any number of slave nodes. But master-slave replication is no longer recommended for production deployments. There are a couple reasons for this. First, failover is completely man- ual.  If  the  master  node  fails,  then  an  administrator  must  shut  down  a  slave  and restart it as a master node. Then the application must be reconfigured to point to the new master. Second, recovery is difficult. Because the oplog exists only on the mas- ter node, a failure requires that a new oplog be created on the new master. This means that any other existing nodes will need to resync from the new master in the event of a failure.   In short, there are few compelling reasons to use master-slave replication. Replica sets are the way forward, and they’re the flavor of replication you should use. If for some reason you must use master-slave replication, consult the MongoDB manual for more information.  6 When journaling is enabled, documents are written to the core data files and to the oplog simultaneously in  an atomic transaction.  www.it-ebooks.info   312  CHAPTER 11 Replication  HALTED REPLICATION Replication will halt permanently if a secondary can’t find the point it’s synced to in the primary’s oplog. When that happens, you’ll see an exception in the secondary’s log that looks like this:  repl: replication data too stale, halting Fri Jan 28 14:19:27 [replsecondary] caught SyncException  Recall that the oplog is a capped collection. This means that the collection can only hold so much data. If a secondary is offline for an extended period of time, the oplog may not be large enough to store every change made in that period. Once a given sec- ondary fails to find the point at which it’s synced in the primary’s oplog, there’s no longer  any  way  of  ensuring  that  the  secondary  is  a  perfect  replica  of  the  primary. Because the only remedy for halted replication is a complete resync of the primary’s data, you’ll want to strive to avoid this state. To do that, you’ll need to monitor second- ary delay, and you’ll need to have a large enough oplog for your write volume. You’ll learn  more  about  monitoring  in  chapter  12.  Choosing  the  right  oplog  size  is  what we’ll cover next. SIZING THE REPLICATION OPLOG The oplog is a capped collection; as such, MongoDB v2.6 doesn’t allow you to resize it once it’s been created. This makes it important to choose an initial oplog size care- fully.  But  in  MongoDB  v3.0  you  can  change  the  size  of  the  oplog.  The  procedure requires you to stop the mongod instance and start it as a standalone instance, modify the oplog size, and restart the member.   The default oplog sizes vary somewhat. On 32-bit systems, the oplog will default to 50 MB, whereas on 64-bit systems, the oplog will be the larger of 1 GB or 5% of free disk space, unless you’re running on Mac OS X, in which case the oplog will be 192 MB. This smaller size is due to the assumption that OS X machines are development machines. For many deployments, 5% of free disk space will be more than enough. One way to think about an oplog of this size is to recognize that once it overwrites itself 20 times, the disk will likely be full  this is true for insert-only workloads .   That said, the default size won’t be ideal for all applications. If you know that your application will have a high write volume, you should do some empirical test- ing before deploying. Set up replication and then write to the primary at the rate you’ll have in production. You’ll want to hammer the server in this way for at least an hour. Once done, connect to any replica set member and get the current replica- tion information:  db.getReplicationInfo    Once you know how much oplog you’re generating per hour, you can then decide how much oplog space to allocate. The goal is to eliminate instances where your sec- ondaries get too far behind the primary to catch up using the oplog. You should prob- ably shoot for being able to withstand at least eight hours of secondary downtime. You  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  313  want to avoid having to completely resync any node, and increasing the oplog size will buy you time in the event of network failures and the like.   If you want to change the default oplog size, you must do so the first time you start each member node using  mongod’s  --oplogSize option. The value is in megabytes. Thus you can start mongod with a 1 GB oplog like this:7   mongod --replSet myapp --oplogSize 1024  HEARTBEAT AND FAILOVER The replica set heartbeat facilitates election and failover. By default, each replica set member pings all the other members every two seconds. In this way, the system can ascertain its own health. When you run rs.status  , you see the timestamp of each node’s last heartbeat along with its state of health  1 means healthy and  0  means unresponsive .    As  long  as  every  node  remains  healthy  and  responsive,  the  replica  set  will  hum along  its  merry  way.  But  if  any  node  becomes  unresponsive,  action  may  be  taken. Every replica set wants to ensure that exactly one primary node exists at all times. But this is possible only when a majority of nodes is visible. For example, look back at the replica set you built in the previous section. If you kill the secondary, then a majority of nodes still exists, so the replica set doesn’t change state but simply waits for the sec- ondary  to  come  back  online.  If  you  kill  the  primary,  then  a  majority  still  exists  but there’s no primary. Therefore, the secondary is automatically promoted to primary. If more than one secondary exists, the most current secondary will be the one elected.   But other possible scenarios exist. Imagine that both the secondary and the arbiter are killed. Now the primary remains but there’s no majority—only one of the three original nodes remains healthy. In this case, you’ll see a message like this in the pri- mary’s log:  [rsMgr] can't see a majority of the set, relinquishing primary     [rsMgr] replSet relinquishing primary state                        [rsMgr] replSet SECONDARY                                          [rsMgr] replSet closing client sockets after relinquishing primary  With no majority, the primary demotes itself to a secondary. This may seem puzzling, but think about what might happen if this node were allowed to remain primary. If the heartbeats fail due to some kind of network partition, the other nodes will still be online.  If  the  arbiter  and  secondary  are  still  up  and  able  to  see  each  other,  then according to the rule of the majority, the remaining secondary will become a primary. If the original primary doesn’t step down, you’re suddenly in an untenable situation: a replica set with two primary nodes. If the application continues to run, it might write to  and  read  from  two  different  primaries,  a  sure  recipe  for  inconsistency  and  truly bizarre application behavior. Therefore, when the primary can’t see a majority, it must step down.  7 For a tutorial on how to resize the oplog, see http:  docs.mongodb.org manual tutorial change-oplog-size .  www.it-ebooks.info   314  CHAPTER 11 Replication  COMMIT AND ROLLBACK One final important point to understand about replica sets is the concept of a com- mit. In essence, you can write to a primary node all day long, but those writes won’t be considered committed until they’ve been replicated to a majority of nodes. What do we mean by committed? The idea can best be explained by example.    Please note that operations on a single document are always atomic with MongoDB  databases, but operations that involve multiple documents aren’t atomic as a whole.   Imagine again the replica set you built in the previous section. Suppose you issue a series of writes to the primary that don’t get replicated to the secondary for some reason  connectivity issues, secondary is down for backup, secondary is lagging, and so on . Now suppose that the secondary is suddenly promoted to primary. You write to the new primary, and eventually the old primary comes back online and tries to replicate  from  the  new  primary.  The  problem  here  is  that  the  old  primary  has  a series of writes that don’t exist in the new primary’s oplog. This situation triggers a rollback.   In a rollback, all writes that were never replicated to a majority are undone. This means  that  they’re  removed  from  both  the  secondary’s  oplog  and  the  collection where they reside. If a secondary has registered a delete, the node will look for the deleted  document  in  another  replica  and  restore  it  to  itself.  The  same  is  true  for dropped collections and updated documents.   The reverted writes are stored in the rollback subdirectory of the relevant node’s data path. For each collection with rolled-back writes, a separate BSON file will be cre- ated the filename of which includes the time of the rollback. In the event that you need to restore the reverted documents, you can examine these BSON files using the bsondump utility and manually restore them, possibly using mongorestore.   If you ever have to restore rolled-back data, you’ll realize that this is a situation you want to avoid, and fortunately you can, to some extent. If your application can tolerate  the  extra  write  latency,  you  can  use  write  concerns,  described  later,  to ensure that your data is replicated to a majority of nodes on each write  or perhaps after every several writes . Being smart about write concerns and about monitoring of replication lag in general will help you mitigate the problem of rollback, or even avoid it altogether.   In this section you learned perhaps a few more replication internals than expected, but the knowledge should come in handy. Understanding how replication works goes a long way in helping you to diagnose any issues you may have in production.  11.2.3 Administration  For all the automation they provide, replica sets have some potentially complicated con- figuration options. In what follows, we’ll describe these options in detail. In the interest of keeping things simple, we’ll also suggest which options can be safely ignored.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  315  CONFIGURATION DETAILS Here  we’ll  present  the  mongod  startup  options  pertaining  to  replica  sets,  and  we’ll describe the structure of the replica set configuration document.  Replication options Earlier, you learned how to initiate a replica set using the shell’s rs.initiate   and rs.add   methods. These methods are convenient, but they hide certain replica set configuration options. Let’s look at how to use a configuration document to initiate and update a replica set’s configuration.    A configuration document specifies the configuration of the replica set. To create one,  first  add  a  value  for  _id  that  matches  the  name  you  passed  to  the  --replSet parameter:  > config = {_id: "myapp", members: []} { "_id" : "myapp", "members" : [ ] }  The individual members can be defined as part of the configuration document as follows:  config.members.push {_id: 0, host: 'iron.local:40000'}  config.members.push {_id: 1, host: 'iron.local:40001'}  config.members.push {_id: 2, host: 'iron.local:40002', arbiterOnly: true}   As noted earlier, iron is the name of our test machine; substitute your own hostname as necessary. Your configuration document should now look like this:  > config {   "_id" : "myapp",   "members" : [     {       "_id" : 0,       "host" : "iron.local:40000"     },     {       "_id" : 1,       "host" : "iron.local:40001"     },     {       "_id" : 2,       "host" : "iron.local:40002",       "arbiterOnly" : true     }   ] }  You can then pass the document as the first argument to rs.initiate   to initiate the replica set.    Technically, the document consists of an _id containing the name of the replica set, an array specifying between 3 and 50 members, and an optional subdocument for specifying certain global settings. This sample replica set uses the minimum required  www.it-ebooks.info   316  CHAPTER 11 Replication  configuration  parameters,  plus  the  optional  arbiterOnly  setting.  Please  keep  in mind that although a replica set can have up to 50 members, it can only have up to 7 voting members.   The document requires an _id that matches the replica set’s name. The initiation command  will  verify  that  each  member  node  has  been  started  with  the  --replSet option with that name. Each replica set member requires an _id consisting of increas- ing integers starting from 0. Also, members require a host field with a hostname and optional port.   Here you initiate the replica set using the rs.initiate   method. This is a simple wrapper for the replSetInitiate command. Thus you could have started the replica set like this:  db.runCommand {replSetInitiate: config} ;  config is a variable holding your configuration document. Once initiated, each set member  stores  a  copy  of  this  configuration  document  in  the  local  database’s system.replset collection. If you query the collection, you’ll see that the document now has a version number. Whenever you modify the replica set’s configuration, you must also increment this version number. The easiest way to access the current config- uration document is to run rs.conf  .    To  modify  a  replica  set’s  configuration,  there’s  a  separate  command,  replSet- Reconfig,  which  takes  a  new  configuration  document.  Alternatively,  you  can  use rs.reconfig   which also uses replSetReconfig. The new document can specify the addition or removal of set members along with alterations to both member-specific and global configuration options. The process of modifying a configuration document, incrementing the version number, and passing it as part of the replSetReconfig can be laborious, so a number of shell helpers exist to ease the way. To see a list of them all, enter rs.help   at the shell.    Bear in mind that whenever a replica set reconfiguration results in the election of a new primary node, all client connections will be closed. This is done to ensure that clients will no longer attempt to send writes to a secondary node unless they’re aware of the reconfiguration.   If you’re interested in configuring a replica set from one of the drivers, you can see how by examining the implementation of rs.add  . Enter rs.add  the method with- out the parentheses  at the shell prompt to see how the method works. Configuration document options Until now, we’ve limited ourselves to the simplest replica set configuration document. But these documents support several options for both replica set members and for the replica set as a whole. We’ll begin with the member options. You’ve seen _id, host, and arbiterOnly. Here are these plus the rest, in all their gritty detail:    _id  required —A unique incrementing integer representing the member’s ID. These _id values begin at 0 and must be incremented by one for each mem- ber added.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  317    host  required —A string storing the hostname of this member along with an optional port number. If the port is provided, it should be separated from the hostname by a colon  for example, iron:30000 . If no port number is specified, the default port, 27017, will be used. We’ve seen it before, but here’s a simple document with a replica set _id and host:    arbiterOnly—A Boolean value, true or false, indicating whether this mem- ber  is  an  arbiter.  Arbiters  store  configuration  data  only.  They’re  lightweight members that participate in primary election but not in the replication itself. Here’s an example of using the arbiterOnly setting:  {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000" }  {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000",   "arbiterOnly": true }    priority—A decimal number from 0 to 1000 that helps to determine the rela- tive eligibility that this node will be elected primary. For both replica set initia- tion  and  failover,  the  set  will  attempt  to  elect  as  primary  the  node  with  the highest priority, as long as it’s up to date. This might be useful if you have a rep- lica set where some nodes are more powerful than the others; it makes sense to prefer the biggest machine as the primary.  There are also cases where you might want a node never to be primary  say, a disaster recovery node residing in a secondary data center . In those cases, set the  priority  to  0.  Nodes  with  a  priority  of  0  will  be  marked  as  passive  in  the results to the isMaster   command and will never be elected primary. Here’s an example of setting the member’s priority:  {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000",   "priority" : 500 }    votes—All  replica  set  members  get  one  vote  by  default.  The  votes  setting  allows you to give more than one vote to an individual member.  This option should be used with extreme care, if at all. For one thing, it’s dif- ficult to reason about replica set failover behavior when not all members have the same number of votes. Moreover, the vast majority of production deploy- ments will be perfectly well served with one vote per member. If you do choose to alter the number of votes for a given member, be sure to think through and  www.it-ebooks.info   318  CHAPTER 11 Replication  simulate the various failure scenarios carefully. This member has an increased number of votes:  {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000",   "votes" : 2 }  {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000",   "hidden" : true }  {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000",   "buildIndexes" : false }    hidden—A Boolean value that, when true, will keep this member from showing up in the responses generated by the isMaster command. Because the MongoDB drivers  rely  on  isMaster  for  knowledge  of  the  replica  set  topology,  hiding  a member keeps the drivers from automatically accessing it. This setting can be used  in  conjunction  with  buildIndexes  and  must  be  used  with  slaveDelay. This member is configured to be hidden:     buildIndexes—A Boolean value, defaulting to true, that determines whether this member will build indexes. You’ll want to set this value to  false only on members that will never become primary  those with a priority of 0 .  This  option  was  designed  for  nodes  used  solely  as  backups.  If  backing  up indexes is important, you shouldn’t use this option. Here’s a member config- ured not to build indexes:     slaveDelay—The number of seconds that a given secondary should lag behind the primary. This option can be used only with nodes that will never become pri- mary. To specify a slaveDelay greater than 0, be sure to also set a priority of 0.  You can use a delayed slave as insurance against certain kinds of user errors. For example, if you have a secondary delayed by 30 minutes and an administra- tor  accidentally  drops  a  database,  you  have  30  minutes  to  react  to  this  event before it’s propagated. This member has been configured with a slaveDelay of one hour:   {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000",   "slaveDelay" : 3600 }  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  319    tags—A document containing a set of key-value pairs, usually used to identify this member’s location in a particular datacenter or server rack. Tags are used for specifying granular write concern and read settings, and they’re discussed in section 11.3.4. In the tag document, the values entered must be strings. Here’s a member with two tags:   That  sums  up  the  options  for  individual  replica  set  members.  There  are  also  two global replica set configuration parameters scoped under a settings key. In the rep- lica set configuration document, they appear like this:  {   "_id" : 0,   "host" : "iron:40000",   "tags" : {     "datacenter" : "NY",     "rack" : "B" }  {   _id: "myapp",   members: [ ... ],   settings: {     getLastErrorDefaults: {       w: 1     },     getLastErrorModes: {       multiDC: {         dc: 2        }     }   } }    getLastErrorDefaults—A  document  specifying  the  default  arguments  to  be used when the client calls getLastError with no arguments. This option should be treated with care because it’s also possible to set global defaults for getLast- Error  within  the  drivers,  and  you  can  imagine  a  situation  where  application developers call getLastError not realizing that an administrator has specified a default on the server.  For  more  details  on  getLastError,  see  its  documentation  at  http:  docs .mongodb.org manual reference command getLastError.  Briefly,  to  specify that all writes are replicated to at least two members with a timeout of 500 ms, you’d specify this value in the config like this:   settings: {    getLastErrorDefaults: {     w: 2,      wtimeout: 500   }  }  www.it-ebooks.info   320  CHAPTER 11 Replication    getLastErrorModes—A document defining extra modes for the getLastError command. This feature is dependent on replica set tagging and is described in detail in section 11.3.4.   REPLICA SET STATUS You can see the status of a replica set and its members by running the replSetGet- Status  command.  To  invoke  this  command  from  the  shell,  run  the  rs.status   helper method. The resulting document indicates the members and their respective states, uptime, and oplog times. It’s important to understand replica set member state. You can see a complete list of possible values in table 11.1.   You can consider a replica set stable and online when all its nodes are in any of states 1, 2, or 7 and when at least one node is running as the primary. You can use the rs.status    or  replSetGetStatus  command  from  an  external  script  to  monitor overall  state,  replication  lag,  and  uptime,  and  this  is  recommended  for  production deployments.8  Table 11.1 Replica set states  State  State string  Notes  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  STARTUP  PRIMARY  SECONDARY  Indicates that the replica set is negotiating with other nodes by pinging all set  members and sharing config data.  This is the primary node. A replica set will always have at most one  primary node.  This is a secondary, read-only node. This node may become a primary in the  event of a failover if and only if its priority is greater than 0 and it’s not  marked as hidden.  RECOVERING This node is unavailable for reading and writing. You usually see this state after  a failover or upon adding a new node. While recovering, a data file sync is often  in progress; you can verify this by examining the recovering node’s logs.  FATAL  A network connection is still established, but the node isn’t responding to  pings. This usually indicates a fatal error on the machine hosting the node  marked FATAL.  STARTUP2  An initial data file sync is in progress.  UNKNOWN  A network connection has yet to be made.  ARBITER  This node is an arbiter.  DOWN  The node was accessible and stable at some point but isn’t currently  responding to heartbeat pings.  ROLLBACK  A rollback is in progress.  10  REMOVED  The node was once a member of the replica set but has since been removed.  8 Note that in addition to running the status command, you can get a useful visual through the web console.  Chapter 13 discusses the web console and shows an example of its use with replica sets.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  321  FAILOVER AND RECOVERY In the sample replica set you saw a couple examples of failover. Here we summarize the rules of failover and provide some suggestions on handling recovery.   A replica set will come online when all members specified in the configuration can communicate  with  one  another.  Each  node  is  given  one  vote  by  default,  and  those votes are used to form a majority and elect a primary. This means that a replica set can be started with as few as two nodes  and votes . But the initial number of votes also decides what constitutes a majority in the event of a failure.   Let’s assume that you’ve configured a replica set of three complete replicas  no arbiters  and thus have the recommended minimum for automated failover. If the pri- mary fails, and the remaining secondaries can see each other, then a new primary can be elected. As for deciding which one, the secondary with the most up-to-date oplog with the higher priority will be elected primary. Failure modes and recovery Recovery is the process of restoring the replica set to its original state following a fail- ure.  There  are  two  overarching  failure  categories  to  be  handled.  The  first  is  called clean  failure,  where  a  given  node’s  data  files  can  still  be  assumed  to  be  intact.  One example of this is a network partition. If a node loses its connections to the rest of the set, you need only wait for connectivity to be restored, and the partitioned node will resume as a set member. A similar situation occurs when a given node’s mongod pro- cess is terminated for any reason but can be brought back online cleanly.9 Again, once the process is restarted, it can rejoin the set.   The second type is called categorical failure, where a node’s data files either no longer exist or must be presumed corrupted. Unclean shutdowns of the mongod process with- out journaling enabled and hard drive crashes are both examples of this kind of failure. The only ways to recover a categorically failed node are to completely replace the data files via a resync or to restore from a recent backup. Let’s look at both strategies in turn.  To completely resync, start a  mongod with an empty data directory on the failed node. As long as the host and port haven’t changed, the new mongod will rejoin the replica set and then resync all the existing data. If either the host or port has changed, then after bringing the mongod back online you’ll also have to reconfigure the replica set. As an example, suppose the node at iron:40001 is rendered unrecoverable and you  bring  up  a  new  node  at  foobar:40000.  You  can  reconfigure  the  replica  set  by grabbing the configuration document, modifying the host for the second node, and then passing that to the rs.reconfig   method:  > config = rs.conf   {   "_id" : "myapp",   "version" : 1,   "members" : [  9 For instance, if MongoDB is shut down cleanly, then you know that the data files are okay. Alternatively, if  running with journaling, the MongoDB instance should be recoverable regardless of how it’s killed.  www.it-ebooks.info   322  CHAPTER 11 Replication      {       "_id" : 0,       "host" : "iron:40000"     },     {       "_id" : 1,       "host" : "iron:40001"     },     {       "_id" : 2,       "host" : "iron:40002",       "arbiterOnly" : true     }   ] } > config.members[1].host = "foobar:40000" foobar:40000 > rs.reconfig config   Now the replica set will identify the new node, and the new node should start to sync from an existing member.    In addition to restoring via a complete resync, you have the option of restoring from  a  recent  backup.  You’ll  typically  perform  backups  from  one  of  the  secondary nodes by making snapshots of the data files and then storing them offline.10 Recovery via  backup  is  possible  only  if  the  oplog  within  the  backup  isn’t  stale  relative  to  the oplogs of the current replica set members. This means that the latest operation in the backup’s  oplog  must  still  exist  in  the  live  oplogs.  You  can  use  the  information  pro- vided by db.getReplicationInfo   to see right away if this is the case. When you do, don’t  forget  to  take  into  account  the  time  it  will  take  to  restore  the  backup.  If  the backup’s latest oplog entry is likely to go stale in the time it takes to copy the backup to a new machine, you’re better off performing a complete resync.   But restoring from backup can be faster, in part because the indexes don’t have to be rebuilt from scratch. To restore from a backup, copy the backed-up data files to a mongod data path. The resync should begin automatically, and you can check the logs or run rs.status   to verify this. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES You now know that a replica set can consist of up to 50 nodes in MongoDB v3.0, and you’ve been presented with a dizzying array of configuration options and considerations regarding failover and recovery. There are a lot of ways you might configure a replica set, but in this section we’ll present a couple that will work for the majority of cases.    The  most  minimal  replica  set  configuration  providing  automated  failover  is  the one  you  built  earlier  consisting  of  two  replicas  and  one  arbiter.  In  production,  the arbiter can run on an application server while each replica gets its own machine. This configuration is economical and sufficient for many production apps.  10 Backups are discussed in detail in chapter 13.  www.it-ebooks.info   Replica sets  323   But for applications where uptime is critical, you’ll want a replica set consisting of three complete replicas. What does the extra replica buy you? Think of the scenario where a single node fails completely. You still have two first-class nodes available while you restore the third. As long as a third node is online and recovering  which may take hours , the replica set can still fail over automatically to an up-to-date node.   Some applications will require the redundancy afforded by two datacenters, and the three-member replica set can also work in this case. The trick is to use one of the datacenters for disaster recovery only. Figure 11.2 shows an example of this. Here, the  primary  datacenter  houses  a  replica  set  primary  and  secondary,  and  a  backup datacenter keeps the remaining secondary as a passive node  with priority 0 .  Primary datacenter  Secondary datacenter  Replication  Ping  Secondary  priority = 0   Secondary  Primary  Ping  Ping  Figure 11.2 A three- node replica set with  members in two  datacenters  In this configuration, the replica set primary will always be one of the two nodes living in datacenter A. You can lose any one node or any one datacenter and still keep the application online. Failover will usually be automatic, except in the cases where both of A’s nodes are lost. Because it’s rare to lose two nodes at once, this would likely rep- resent the complete failure or partitioning of datacenter A. To recover quickly, you could shut down the member in datacenter B and restart it without the  --replSet flag. Alternatively, you could start two new nodes in datacenter B and then force a rep- lica  set  reconfiguration.  You’re  not  supposed  to  reconfigure  a  replica  set  when  the majority of the set is unreachable, but you can do so in emergencies using the force option. For example, if you’ve defined a new configuration document,  config, you can force reconfiguration like this:  > rs.reconfig config, {force: true}   As with any production system, testing is key. Make sure that you test for all the typical failover and recovery scenarios in a staging environment comparable to what you’ll be  www.it-ebooks.info   324  CHAPTER 11 Replication  running in production. Knowing from experience how your replica set will behave in these failures cases will secure some peace of mind and give you the wherewithal to calmly deal with emergencies as they occur.  11.3 Drivers and replication  If  you’re  building  an  application  using  MongoDB’s  replication,  you  need  to  know about  several  application-specific  topics.  The  first  is  related  to  connections  and failover. Next comes the write concern, which allows you to decide to what degree a given  write  should  be  replicated  before  the  application  continues.  The  next  topic, read scaling, allows an application to distribute reads across replicas. Finally, we’ll dis- cuss tagging, a way to configure more complex replica set reads and writes.  11.3.1 Connections and failover  The MongoDB drivers present a relatively uniform interface for connecting to rep- lica sets. SINGLE-NODE CONNECTIONS You’ll always have the option of connecting to a single node in a replica set. There’s no difference between connecting to a node designated as a replica set primary and connecting  to  one  of  the  vanilla  stand-alone  nodes  we’ve  used  for  the  examples throughout the book. In both cases, the driver will initiate a TCP socket connection and then run the isMaster command. For a stand-alone node, this command returns a document like the following:  {   "ismaster" : true,   "maxBsonObjectSize" : 16777216,   "maxMessageSizeBytes" : 48000000,   "localTime" : ISODate "2013-11-12T05:22:54.317Z" ,   "ok" : 1 }  What’s most important to the driver is that the isMaster field be set to true, which indicates that the given node is a stand-alone, a master running master-slave replica- tion, or a replica set primary.11 In all of these cases, the node can be written to, and the user of the driver can perform any CRUD operation.   But when connecting directly to a replica set secondary, you must indicate that you know you’re connecting to such a node  for most drivers, at least . In the Ruby driver, you accomplish this with the:read parameter. To connect directly to the first second- ary you created earlier in the chapter, the Ruby code would look like this:  @con = Mongo::Client.new ['iron: 40001'], {:read => {:mode => :secondary}}   11 The  isMaster command also returns a value for the maximum BSON object size for this version of the  server. The drivers then validate that all BSON objects are within this limit prior to inserting them.  www.it-ebooks.info   Drivers and replication  325  Without  the  :read  argument,  the  driver  will  raise  an  exception  indicating  that  it couldn’t  connect  to  a  primary  node   assuming  that  the  mongod  running  at  port 40001 is the secondary . This check is in place to keep you from inadvertently read- ing from a secondary node. Though such attempts to read will always be rejected by the server, you won’t see any exceptions unless you’re running the operations with safe mode enabled.   The assumption is that you’ll usually want to connect to a primary node master;  the :read parameter is enforced as a sanity check. REPLICA SET CONNECTIONS You can connect to any replica set member individually, but you’ll normally want to connect to the replica set as a whole. This allows the driver to figure out which node is  primary  and,  in  the  case  of  failover,  reconnect  to  whichever  node  becomes  the new primary.   Most of the officially supported drivers provide ways of connecting to a replica set. In Ruby, you connect by creating a new instance of Mongo::Client, passing in a list of seed nodes as well as the name of the replica set:  Mongo::Client.new ['iron:40000', 'iron:40001'], :replica_set => 'myapp'   Internally,  the  driver  will  attempt  to  connect  to  each  seed  node  and  then  call  the isMaster  command.  Issuing  this  command  to  a  replica  set  returns  a  number  of important set details:  > db.isMaster   {   "setName" : "myapp",   "ismaster" : false,   "secondary" : true,   "hosts" : [     "iron:40001",     "iron:40000"   ],   "arbiters" : [     "iron:40002"   ],   "me" : "iron:40000",   "maxBsonObjectSize" : 16777216,   "maxMessageSizeBytes" : 48000000,   "localTime" : ISODate "2013-11-12T05:14:42.009Z" ,   "ok" : 1 }  Once a seed node responds with this information, the driver has everything it needs. Now it can connect to the primary member, again verify that this member is still pri- mary,  and  then  allow  the  user  to  read  and  write  through  this  node.  The  response object also allows the driver to cache the addresses of the remaining secondary and arbiter nodes. If an operation on the primary fails, then on subsequent requests the  www.it-ebooks.info   326  CHAPTER 11 Replication  driver can attempt to connect to one of the remaining nodes until it can reconnect to a primary.   When connecting to a MongoDB replica set in this way, drivers will automatically discover additional nodes. This means that when you’re connecting to a replica set, you  don’t  need  to  explicitly  list  every  member  of  the  set.  The  response  from  the isMaster command alerts the driver of the presence of the other members. If none of the replica set members listed in the connection arguments are active, the connection will fail, so it’s wise to list as many as you can. But don’t sweat it if a few nodes are miss- ing from the connection list; they’ll be found. If you have multiple data centers, it’s considered good practice to include members from all data centers.   It’s important to keep in mind that although replica set failover is automatic, the drivers  don’t  attempt  to  hide  the  fact  that  a  failover  has  occurred.  The  course  of events goes something like this: First, the primary fails or a new election takes place. Subsequent requests will reveal that the socket connection has been broken, and the driver will then raise a connection exception and close any open sockets to the data- base. It’s now up to the application developer to decide what happens next, and this decision will depend on both the operation being performed and the specific needs of the application.   Keeping in mind that the driver will automatically attempt to reconnect on any subsequent request, let’s imagine a couple of scenarios. First, suppose that you only issue reads to the database. In this case, there’s little harm in retrying a failed read because there’s no possibility of changing database state. But now imagine that you also  regularly  write  to  the  database.  You  can  write  to  the  database  with  or  without checking for errors. As discussed in section 11.3.2, with a write concern of 1 or more, the driver will check for problems, including a failure of the write to reach the replica set, by calling the getLastError command. This is the default in most drivers since around MongoDB v2.0, but if you explicitly set the write concern to 0, the driver writes to the TCP socket without checking for errors. If you’re using a relatively recent ver- sion of the drivers or the shell, you don’t have to explicitly call getLastError  ; writes send detailed ACK in any case.   If your application writes with a write concern of 0 and a failover occurs, you’re left in an uncertain state. How many of the recent writes made it to the server? How many were lost in the socket buffer? The indeterminate nature of writing to a TCP socket makes answering these questions practically impossible. How big of a problem this is depends on the application. For logging, non-safe-mode writes are probably accept- able, because losing writes hardly changes the overall logging picture. But for users creating data in the application, non-safe-mode writes can be a disaster.   The important thing to remember is that the write concern is set to 1 by default, meaning the writes are guaranteed to have reached one member of a replica set, and there are risks in setting it to 0. Receiving a response doesn’t eliminate the possibility of a rollback, as we discussed in section 11.2.2. MongoDB gives you some more advanced capabilities for managing this by controlling how writes work with the write concern.   www.it-ebooks.info   11.3.2 Write concern  Drivers and replication  327  It should be clear now that the default write concern of 1 is reasonable for some appli- cations because it’s important to know that writes have arrived error-free at the pri- mary server. But greater levels of assurance are required if you want to eliminate the possibility of a rollback, and the write concern addresses this by allowing developers to specify the extent to which a write should be replicated before getting an acknowledg- ment  and  allowing  the  application  to  continue.  Technically,  you  control  write  con- cerns via two parameters on the getLastError command: w and wtimeout. The first value, w, indicates the total number of servers that the latest write should be replicated to; the second is a timeout that causes the command to return an error if the write can’t be replicated in the specified number of milliseconds.   For example, if you want to make sure that a given write is replicated to at least one server, you can indicate a w value of 2. If you want the operation to time out if this level of replication isn’t achieved in 500 ms, you include a wtimeout of 500. Note that if you don’t specify a value for wtimeout, and the replication for some reason never occurs, the operation will block indefinitely.   When using a driver, you usually pass the write concern value in with the write, but it depends on the specific driver’s API. In Ruby, you can specify a write concern on a single operation like this:  @collection.insert_one doc, {:w => 2, :wtimeout => 200}   Many drivers support setting default write concern values for a given connection or database.  It  can  be  overwritten  for  a  single  operation,  as  shown  earlier,  but  will become the default for the life of the connection:  Mongo::Client.new ['hostname:27017'], :write => {:w => 2}   Even fancier options exist. For instance, if you’ve enabled journaling, you can also force that the journal be synced to disk before acknowledging a write by adding the j option:   @collection.insert_one doc, :write => {:w => 2, :j => true}   To find out how to set the write concern in your particular case, check your driver’s documentation.    Write  concerns  work  with  both  replica  sets  and  master-slave  replication.  If  you examine  the  local  databases,  you’ll  see  a  couple  of  collections,  me  on  secondary nodes and slaves on the primary node. These are used to implement write concerns. Whenever a secondary polls a primary, the primary makes a note of the latest oplog entry  applied  to  each  secondary  in  its  slaves  collection.  Thus,  the  primary  knows what each secondary has replicated at all times and can therefore reliably answer the getLastError command’s write requests.   Keep in mind that using write concerns with values of w greater than 1 will intro- duce  extra  latency.  Configurable  write  concerns  essentially  allow  you  to  make  the  www.it-ebooks.info   328  CHAPTER 11 Replication  trade-off between speed and durability. If you’re running with journaling, then a write concern with w equal to 1 should be fine for most applications. On the other hand, for logging  or  analytics,  you  might  elect  to  disable  journaling  and  write  concerns  alto- gether and rely solely on replication for durability, allowing that you may lose some writes in the event of a failure. Consider these trade-offs carefully and test the differ- ent scenarios when designing your application.   11.3.3 Read scaling  Replicated  databases  are  great  for  read  scaling.  If  a  single  server  can’t  handle  the application’s read load, you have the option to route queries to more than one rep- lica. Most of the drivers have built-in support for sending queries to secondary nodes through a read preference configuration. With the Ruby driver, this is provided as an option on the Mongo::Client constructor:   Mongo::Client.new      ['iron:40000', 'iron:40001'],      {:read => {:mode => :secondary}   Note in the connection code that we configure which nodes the new client will read from.  When  the  :read  argument  is  set  to  {:mode  =>  :secondary},  the  connection object  will  choose  a  random,  nearby  secondary  to  read  from.  This  configuration  is called the read preference, and it can be used to direct your driver to read from cer- tain nodes. Most MongoDB drivers have these available read preferences:    primary—This is the default setting and indicates that reads will always be from the replica set primary and thus will always be consistent. If the replica set is experiencing  problems  and  there’s  no  secondary  available,  an  error  will  be thrown.       primaryPreferred—Drivers with this setting will read from the primary unless for some reason it’s unavailable or there’s no primary, in which case reads will go to a secondary. This means that reads aren’t guaranteed to be consistent. secondary—This setting indicates the driver should always read from the second- ary. This is useful in cases where you want to be sure that your reads will have no impact on the writes that occur on the primary. If no secondaries are available, the read will throw an exception. secondaryPreferred—This is a more relaxed version of the previous setting. Reads will go to secondaries, unless no secondaries are available, in which case reads will go to the primary.       nearest—A driver configured with this setting will attempt to read from the near- est member of the replica set, as measured by network latency. This could be either  a  primary  or  a  secondary.  Thus,  reads  will  go  to  the  member  that  the driver believes it can communicate with the quickest.  Remember, the primary read preference is the only one where reads are guaranteed to be consistent. Writing is always done first on the primary. Because there may be a  www.it-ebooks.info   Drivers and replication  329  lag in updating the secondary, it’s possible that a document that has just been writ- ten won’t be found on a read immediately following the write, unless you’re reading the primary.   It turns out that even if you’re not using the nearest setting, if a MongoDB driver has a read preference that allows it to query secondaries, it will still attempt to commu- nicate with a nearby node. It does this according to its member selection strategy. The driver first ranks all the nodes by their network latency. Then it excludes all the nodes for which network latency is at least 15 ms larger than the lowest latency. Finally, it picks one of the remaining nodes at random. Fifteen milliseconds is the default for this value, but some drivers will allow configuration of the acceptable latency window. For the Ruby driver, this configuration might look like this:  Mongo::Client.new      ['iron:40000', 'iron:40001'],      :read => {:mode => :secondary},:local_threshold => '0.0015'   The :local_threshold option specifies the maximum latency in seconds as a float.   Note that the nearest read preference uses this strategy to pick a node to read from as well, but it includes the primary in the selection process. Overall, the advan- tage of this approach is that a driver will be likely to have lower latency on a query than with totally random selection but is still able to distribute reads to multiple nodes if they have similarly low latency.   Many MongoDB users scale with replication in production, but there are three cases where this sort of scaling won’t be sufficient. The first relates to the number of servers needed. As of MongoDB v2.0, replica sets support a maximum of 12 mem- bers, 7 of which can vote. As of MongoDB v3.0, replica sets support a maximum of 50 members, 7 of which can vote. If you need even more replicas for scaling, you can use  master-slave  replication.  But  if  you  don’t  want  to  sacrifice  automated  failover and you need to scale beyond the replica set maximum, you’ll need to migrate to a sharded cluster.   The second case involves applications with a high write load. As mentioned at the beginning  of  this  chapter,  secondaries  must  keep  up  with  this  write  load.  Sending reads to write-laden secondaries may inhibit replication.     A  third  situation  that  replica  scaling  can’t  handle  is  consistent  reads.  Because replication is asynchronous, replicas aren’t always going to reflect the latest writes to the primary. Therefore, if your application reads arbitrarily from secondaries, the picture presented to end users isn’t always guaranteed to be fully consistent. For some applications, this isn’t an issue, but for others you need consistent reads; in our shop- ping cart example from chapter 4, there would be serious problems if we weren’t reading the most current data. In fact, atomic operations that read and write must be run on the primary. In these cases, you have two options. The first is to separate the  parts  of  the  application  that  need  consistent  reads  from  the  parts  that  don’t. The former can always be read from the primary, and the latter can be distributed to  www.it-ebooks.info   330  CHAPTER 11 Replication  secondaries. When this strategy is either too complicated or doesn’t scale, sharding is the way to go.12  11.3.4 Tagging  If you’re using either write concerns or read scaling, you may find yourself wanting more  granular  control  over  exactly  which  secondaries  receive  writes  or  reads.  For example, suppose you’ve deployed a five-node replica set across two data geographi- cally separate centers, NY and FR. The primary datacenter, NY, contains three nodes, and the secondary datacenter, FR, contains the remaining two. Let’s say that you want to use a write concern to block until a certain write has been replicated to at least one node in datacenter FR. With what you know about write concerns right now, you’ll see that there’s no good way to do this. You can’t use a w value of a majority of nodes  3  because the most likely scenario is that the three nodes in NY will acknowledge first. You could use a value of 4, but this won’t hold up well if, say, you lose one node from each datacenter.    Replica set tagging solves this problem by allowing you to define special write con- cern modes that target replica set members with certain tags. To see how this works, you first need to learn how to tag a replica set member. In the config document, each member can have a key called tags pointing to an object containing key-value pairs. Here’s an example:   {   "_id" : "myapp",   "version" : 1,   "members" : [     {       "_id" : 0,       "host" : "ny1.myapp.com:30000",       "tags": { "dc": "NY", "rackNY": "A" }     },     {       "_id" : 1,       "host" : "ny2.myapp.com:30000",       "tags": { "dc": "NY", "rackNY": "A" }     },     {       "_id" : 2,       "host" : "ny3.myapp.com:30000",       "tags": { "dc": "NY", "rackNY": "B" }     },     {       "_id" : 3,       "host" : "fr1.myapp.com:30000",       "tags": { "dc": "FR", "rackFR": "A" }     },  www.it-ebooks.info  12 Note that to get consistent reads from a sharded cluster, you must always read from the primary nodes of each  shard, and you must issue safe writes.   Drivers and replication  331      {       "_id" : 4,       "host" : "fr2.myapp.com:30000",       "tags": { "dc": "FR", "rackFR": "B" }     }   ],   settings: {     getLastErrorModes: {       multiDC: { dc: 2 } },       multiRack: { rackNY: 2 } },     }   } }  This is a tagged configuration document for the hypothetical replica set spanning two datacenters. Note that each member’s tag document has two key-value pairs: the first identifies  the  datacenter  and  the  second  names  the  local  server  rack  for  the  given node.  Keep  in  mind  that  the  names  used  here  are  completely  arbitrary  and  only meaningful in the context of this application; you can put anything in a tag document  though the value must be a string . What’s most important is how you use it.    That’s where getLastErrorModes comes into play. This allows you to define modes for the getLastError command that implement specific write concern requirements. In the example, we’ve defined two of these. The first, multiDC, is defined as { "dc": 2 }, which indicates that a write should be replicated to nodes tagged with at least two differ- ent values for dc. If you examine the tags, you’ll see this will necessarily ensure that the write has been propagated to both datacenters. The second mode specifies that at least two server racks in NY should’ve received the write. Again the tags should make this clear.   In general, a getLastErrorModes entry consists of a document with one or more keys  in this case, dc and rackNY  the values of which are integers. These integers indi- cate the number of different tagged values for the key that must be satisfied for the getLastError command to complete successfully. Once you define these modes, you can use them as values for w in your application. For example, using the first mode in Ruby looks like this:   @collection.with :write => {:w => "multiDC"} .insert_one doc   In  addition  to  making  write  concerns  more  sophisticated,  tagging  also  works  with most of the read preferences discussed in section 11.3.3. With reads, tagging works by restricting reads to those with a specific tag. For example, if using a read preference of secondary,  the  driver  will  ignore  all  the  nodes  that  don’t  have  the  given  tag  value. Because the primary read preference can only ever read from one node, it’s not com- patible  with  tags,  but  all  the  other  read  preferences  are.  Here’s  an  example  of  this using the Ruby driver:  @collection.find {user: "pbakkum"},  {   :read => :secondary,    :tag_sets => {  www.it-ebooks.info   332  CHAPTER 11 Replication      :dc => "NY"   } }   11.4 Summary  This configuration reads from a secondary node that has the dc:NY tag.   Tagging is an element of MongoDB that you may never use, but it can be incredibly useful in certain situations. Keep it in mind if you’re managing complex replica set configurations.  It should be clear from all that we’ve discussed that replication is essential for most deployments. MongoDB’s replication is supposed to be easy, and setting it up usually is. But when it comes to backing up and failing over, there are bound to be hidden complexities. For these complex cases, let experience, and some help from this chap- ter, breed familiarity.   To finish up, here are some key things to remember as you move on and manage  your own replica sets:    We  recommend  that  every  production  deployment  of  MongoDB  where  data protection is critical should use a replica set. Failing that, frequent backups are especially essential.    A replica set should include at least three members, though one of these can be  an arbiter.    Data isn’t considered committed until it has been written to a majority of rep- lica set members. In a failure scenario, if a majority of members remain they’ll continue to accept writes. Writes that haven’t reached a majority of members in this situation will be placed in the rollback data directory and must be han- dled manually. If a replica set secondary is down for a period of time, and the changes made to the database don’t fit into MongoDB’s oplog, this node will be unable to catch up and must be resynced from scratch. To avoid this, try to minimize the down- time of your secondaries.       The driver’s write concern controls how many nodes must be written to before returning. Increase this value to increase durability. For real durability, we rec- ommend you set it to a majority of members to avoid rollback scenarios, though this approach carries a latency cost.    MongoDB give you fine-grained controls over how reads and writes behave in more  complex  replica  sets  using  read  preferences  and  tagging.  Use  these options to optimize the performance of your replica set, especially if you have set members in multiple datacenters.  As always, think through your deployments and test thoroughly. Replica sets can be an especially valuable tool when used effectively.   www.it-ebooks.info   Scaling your system with sharding  This chapter covers   Sharding motivation and architecture   Setting up and loading a sample shard cluster   Querying and indexing a sharded cluster   Choosing a shard key   Deploying sharding in production  With  the  increasing  scale  of  modern  applications,  it’s  become  more  and  more expensive, and in some cases impossible, to get a single machine powerful enough to handle the load. One solution to the problem is to pool the capacity of a large number  of  less  powerful  machines.  Sharding  in  MongoDB  is  designed  to  do  just that: partition your database into smaller pieces so that no single machine has to store all the data or handle the entire load. On top of that, sharding in MongoDB is transparent to the application, which means the interface for querying a sharded cluster is exactly the same as the interface for querying a replica set or a single mongod server instance.   We’ll begin the chapter with an overview of sharding. We’ll go into detail about what problems it tries to solve and how to know when you need it. Next, we’ll talk  333  www.it-ebooks.info   334  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  about the components that make up a sharded cluster. Then, we’ll cover the two dif- ferent ways to shard, and scratch the surface of MongoDB’s range-based partitioning.  These three sections will give you a basic working knowledge of sharding, but you won’t fully understand how these ideas all come together until you set up your own sharded cluster. That’s what you’ll do in the fourth section, where you’ll build a sam- ple cluster to host data from a massive Google Docs–like application.    We’ll then discuss some sharding mechanics, describing how queries and indexing work across shards. We’ll look at the ever-important choice of shard key, and we’ll end the chapter with some specific advice on running sharding in production.  Google Docs instead of e-commerce We’re using a Google Docs–like application here, rather than the e-commerce appli- cation we've used in the rest of the book, because the schema is simpler and allows us to focus on the sharding itself.   In an e-commerce application, you may have multiple collections. Some of these col- lections may be large, such as a collection storing all user comments, whereas some may be smaller, such as a collection storing all user profiles. In a more complex appli- cation  such  as  this,  you’d  only  shard  the  collections  that  would  benefit  from  the added capacity of sharding while leaving the smaller collections unsharded for sim- plicity. Because sharded and unsharded collections can exist in the same system, all of this will work together, completely transparently to the application. In fact, if later you find that one of the collections that didn’t need to be sharded is becoming larger, you can enable sharding at any time.   The same principles that we’ll see when looking at our Google Docs–like application apply to any sharded collection. We’ll stick with this example to keep things simple and focus on what’s new in this chapter.  12.1 Sharding overview  Before you build your first sharded cluster, it’s useful to have a general understanding of the concepts behind sharding. In this section, we’ll cover what problems sharding solves, discuss some of the challenges inherent in sharding, and then talk about how to know when sharding is the correct solution in practice.  12.1.1 What is sharding?  Sharding is the process of partitioning a large dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces. Until this point in the book, you’ve used MongoDB as a single server, where each mongod instance contains a complete copy of your application’s data. Even when using replication  as we did in chapter 11 , each replica clones every other replica’s data entirely. For the majority of applications, storing the complete data set on each server is perfectly acceptable. But as the size of the data grows, and as an application demands greater read-and-write throughput, commodity servers may not be sufficient. In particular, these servers may not be able to address enough RAM, or they might not  www.it-ebooks.info   Sharding overview  335  have enough CPU cores, to process the workload efficiently. In addition, as the size of the data grows, it may become impractical to store and manage backups for such a large data set on one disk or RAID array. If you’re to continue to use commodity or vir- tualized hardware to host the database, the solution to these problems is to distribute the database across more than one server. The method for doing this in MongoDB is called sharding. Sharding in MongoDB can help your application scale, but remember that it’s a large hammer. It’s a complex system that adds administrative and perfor- mance overhead, so make absolutely sure it’s what your application needs. In the next section we’ll cover how you can tell when sharding is your best option.  Sharding: Learn by doing Sharding is complicated. To get the most out of this chapter, you should run the examples.   You’ll  have  no  trouble  running  the  sample  cluster  entirely  on  one  machine;  once you’ve successfully set up your cluster, start experimenting with it. There’s nothing like having a live, sharded deployment on hand for understanding MongoDB as a dis- tributed system.  12.1.2 When should you shard?  The question of when to shard is straightforward in theory but requires a solid under- standing of how your system is being used. In general, there are two main reasons to shard: storage distribution and load distribution. Keep in mind that sharding doesn’t solve all performance issues, and it adds additional complexity and overhead, so it’s important to understand why you’re sharding. In many cases, sharding may not be the optimal solution. STORAGE DISTRIBUTION Understanding the storage requirements of your system is usually not difficult. Mon- goDB  stores  all  its  data  in  ordinary  files  in  the  directory  specified  by  the  --dbpath option, which you can read more about in appendix A, so you should be able to use whatever utilities are present on your host operating system to monitor the storage usage of MongoDB. In addition, running db.stats   and db.collection.stats   in the mongo shell will output statistics about the storage usage of the current database and the collection within it named collection, respectively.   If you carefully monitor your storage capacity as your application grows, you’ll be able to clearly see when the storage that your application requires exceeds the capac- ity of any one node. In that case, if adding more capacity isn’t possible, sharding may be your best option. LOAD DISTRIBUTION Understanding the load—the CPU, RAM, and I O bandwidth used by requests from clients—that your system must support is a bit more nuanced. In chapter 8 we talked  www.it-ebooks.info   336  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  about the importance of keeping indexes and the working data set in RAM, and this is the  most  common  reason  to  shard.  If  an  application’s  data  set  continues  to  grow unbounded, a moment will come when that data no longer fits in RAM. If you’re run- ning on Amazon’s EC2, you’ll hit that threshold when you’ve exceeded the available RAM on the largest available instance. Alternatively, you may run your own hardware with  much  more  RAM,  in  which  case  you’ll  probably  be  able  to  delay  sharding  for some time. But no machine has infinite capacity for RAM; therefore, sharding eventu- ally becomes necessary.   To be sure, the relationship between the load your servers can handle and the amount of RAM they have available isn’t always straightforward. For instance, using solid-state drives  an increasingly affordable prospect  or arranging your disks in a striped RAID configuration will increase the number of IOPS  input output opera- tions per second  that your disks can handle, which may allow you to push the data- to-RAM ratio without negatively affecting performance. It may also be the case that your  working  set  is  a  fraction  of  your  total  data  size  and  that,  therefore,  you  can operate with relatively little RAM. On the flip side, if you have an especially demand- ing write load, you may want to shard well before data reaches the size of RAM, sim- ply because you need to distribute the load across machines to get the desired write throughput.  Leave some elbow room Although it may be tempting to wait to shard until all your disks are 100% full and all your machines are overloaded, that’s a bad idea. Sharding itself puts some load on your system because the process of automatic balancing has to move data off overloaded shards. If your system is already so overloaded that this can’t happen, your  empty  shards  will  remain  empty,  your  overloaded  shards  will  remain  over- loaded, and your system will grind to a halt. Chapter 13 gives some practical advice for how to keep track of the important metrics, so you can scale up smoothly as your application grows.  Whatever the case, the decision to shard an existing system will always be based on regular analyses of network usage, disk usage, CPU usage, and the ever-important ratio of working set size, or the amount of data actively being used, to available RAM.   Now that you understand the background and theory behind sharding and know when you need it, let’s look at the components that make up a sharded cluster in MongoDB.  12.2 Understanding components of a sharded cluster  Several components need to work together to make sharding possible. When they’re all functioning together, this is known as a sharded cluster. To understand how MongoDB’s sharding works, you need to know about all the components that make up a sharded cluster and the role of each component in the context of the cluster as a whole.  www.it-ebooks.info   Understanding components of a sharded cluster  337  Shards store application data  Shard-a   Replica set   Shard-b   Replica set   Metadata write  two-phase commit   mongos reads writes application data from to shards  mongos routes queries and collects result  mongos router   in-memory copy of cluster metadata   Application sends queries to single mongos  Application  Figure 12.1 Components in a MongoDB shard cluster  Config server 3  Config server 2  Config server 1  Metadata read  single server   A sharded cluster consists of shards, mongos routers, and config servers, as shown in figure 12.1.   Let’s examine each component in figure 12.1:   Shards  upper left  store the application data. In a sharded cluster, only the mongos routers or system administrators should be connecting directly to the shards. Like an unsharded deployment, each shard can be a single node for develop- ment and testing, but should be a replica set in production.    mongos  routers   center   cache  the  cluster  metadata  and  use  it  to  route  opera-  tions to the correct shard or shards.    Config servers  upper right  persistently store metadata about the cluster, includ-  ing which shard has what subset of the data.  Now, let’s discuss in more detail the role each of these components plays in the cluster as a whole.  12.2.1 Shards: storage of application data  A shard, shown at the upper left of figure 12.1, is either a single  mongod server or a replica set that stores a partition of the application data. In fact, the shards are the only places where the application data gets saved in a sharded cluster. For testing, a shard can be a single mongod server but should be deployed as a replica set in produc- tion because then it will have its own replication mechanism and can fail over auto- matically. You can connect to an individual shard as you would to a single node or a  www.it-ebooks.info   338  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  replica set, but if you try to run operations on that shard directly, you’ll see only a por- tion of the cluster’s total data.  12.2.2 Mongos router: router of operations  Because each shard contains only part of the cluster’s data, you need something to route operations to the appropriate shards. That’s where mongos comes in. The mongos process, shown in the center of figure 12.1, is a router that directs all reads, writes, and commands to the appropriate shard. In this way, mongos provides clients with a single point of contact with the cluster, which is what enables a sharded cluster to present the same interface as an unsharded one.  mongos processes are lightweight and nonpersistent.1 Because of this, they’re often deployed on the same machines as the application servers, ensuring that only one net- work hop is required for requests to any given shard. In other words, the application con- nects locally to a mongos, and the mongos manages connections to the individual shards.  12.2.3 Config servers: storage of metadata  mongos processes are nonpersistent, which means something must durably store the metadata needed to properly manage the cluster. That’s the job of the config servers, shown in the top right of figure 12.1. This metadata includes the global cluster config- uration; the locations of each database, collection, and the particular ranges of data therein; and a change log preserving a history of the migrations of data across shards.  The metadata held by the config servers is central to the proper functioning and upkeep of the cluster. For instance, every time a mongos process is started, the mongos fetches a copy of the metadata from the config servers. Without this data, no coherent view of the shard cluster is possible. The importance of this data, then, informs the design and deployment strategy for the config servers.   If you examine figure 12.1, you’ll see there are three config servers, but they’re not deployed as a replica set. They demand something stronger than asynchronous repli- cation; when the mongos process writes to them, it does so using a two-phase commit. This guarantees consistency across config servers. You must run exactly three config servers in any production deployment of sharding, and these servers must reside on separate machines for redundancy.2   Now you know what a shard cluster consists of, but you’re probably still wondering about the sharding machinery itself. How is data actually distributed? We’ll explain that in the next section, first introducing the two ways to shard in MongoDB, and then covering the core sharding operations.  1 The mongos server caches a local copy of the config server metadata in memory. This metadata has a version identifier that changes when the metadata changes, so when a mongos with old metadata tries to contact a shard with a newer metadata version, it receives a notification that it must refresh its local copy.  2 You can also run a single config server, but only as a way of more easily testing sharding. Running with only one config server in production is like taking a transatlantic flight in a single-engine jet: it might get you there, but lose an engine and you’re hosed.  www.it-ebooks.info   Distributing data in a sharded cluster  339  12.3 Distributing data in a sharded cluster  Before discussing the different ways to shard, let’s discuss how data is grouped and organized in MongoDB. This topic is relevant to a discussion of sharding because it illustrates the different boundaries on which we can partition our data.   To illustrate this, we’ll use the Google Docs–like application we’ll build later in the chapter. Figure 12.2 shows how the data for such an application would be structured in MongoDB.  Database: cloud-docs  Collection: spreadsheets  Chunk: all documents with username between “bakkum” and “verch”  Document:{"username":"hawkins",…}  … …  …  Figure 12.2 Levels of  granularity available in  a sharded MongoDB  deployment  Looking at the figure from the innermost box moving outward, you can see there are four different levels of granularity in MongoDB: document, chunk, collection, and database.   These four levels of granularity represent the units of data in MongoDB:   Document—The smallest unit of data in MongoDB. A document represents a sin- gle object in the system and can’t be divided further. You can compare this to a row in a relational database. Note that we consider a document and all its fields to be a single atomic unit. In the innermost box in figure 12.2, you can see a document with a username field with a value of "hawkins".    Chunk—A group of documents clustered by values on a field. A chunk is a con- cept that exists only in sharded setups. This is a logical grouping of documents based on their values for a field or set of fields, known as a shard key. We’ll cover the shard key when we go into more detail about chunks later in this section, and then again in section 12.6. The chunk shown in figure 12.2 contains all the docu- ments that have the field username with values between "bakkum" and "verch".    Collection—A named grouping of documents within a database. To allow users to separate a database into logical groupings that make sense for the applica- tion, MongoDB provides the concept of a collection. This is nothing more than a  named  grouping  of  documents,  and  it  must  be  explicitly  specified  by  the application to run any queries. In figure 12.2, the collection name is spread- sheets. This collection name essentially identifies a subgroup within the cloud- docs database, which we’ll discuss next.    Database—Contains collections of documents. This is the top-level named group- ing  in  the  system.  Because  a  database  contains  collections  of  documents,  a  www.it-ebooks.info   340  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  12.3.1 Ways data can be distributed in a sharded cluster  collection must also be specified to perform any operations on the documents themselves. In figure 12.2, the database name is cloud-docs. To run any que- ries, the collection must also be specified—spreadsheets in our example. The combination of database name and collection name together is unique through- out the system, and is commonly referred to as the namespace. It is usually repre- sented by concatenating the collection name and database together, separated by a period character. For the example shown in figure 12.2, that would look like cloud-docs.spreadsheets.  Databases and collections were covered in section 4.3, and are present in unsharded deployments as well, so the only unfamiliar grouping here should be the chunk.  Now you know the different ways in which data is logically grouped in MongoDB. The next questions are, how does this interact with sharding? On which of these groupings can we partition our data? The quick answer to these questions is that data can be dis- tributed in a sharded cluster on two of these four groupings:    On the level of an entire database, where each database along with all its collec-  tions is put on its own shard.    On the level of partitions or chunks of a collection, where the documents within a collection itself are divided up and spread out over multiple shards, based on values of a field or set of fields called the shard key in the documents.  You may wonder why MongoDB does partitioning based on chunks rather than on individual documents. It seems like that would be the most logical grouping because a document is the smallest possible unit. But when you consider the fact that not only do we have to partition the data, but we also have to be able to find it again, you’ll see that if we partition on a document level—for example, by allowing each spreadsheet in our Google Docs–like application to be independently moved around—we need to store metadata on the config servers, keeping track of every single document inde- pendently. If you imagine a system with small documents, half of your data may end up being metadata on the config servers just keeping track of where your actual data is stored.  Granularity jump from database to partition of collection You may also wonder why there’s a jump in granularity from an entire database to a partition of a collection. Why isn’t there an intermediate step where we can distribute on the level of whole collections, without partitioning the collections themselves?  The real answer to this question is that it’s completely theoretically possible. It just hasn’t been implemented yet. Fortunately, because of the relationship between data- bases and collections, there’s an easy workaround. If you’re in a situation where you  www.it-ebooks.info   Distributing data in a sharded cluster  341  have different collections—say,  files.spreadsheets and files.powerpoints— that you want to be put on separate servers, you can store them in separate data- bases. For example, you could store spreadsheets in files_spreadsheets.spread- sheets and PowerPoint files in files_powerpoints.powerpoints. Because files _spreadsheets  and  files_powerpoints  are  two  separate  databases,  they’ll  be distributed, and so will the collections.  In the next two sections, we’ll cover each of the supported distribution methods. First we’ll discuss distributing entire databases, and then we’ll move on to the more com- mon and useful method of distributing chunks within a collection.  12.3.2 Distributing databases to shards  As you create new databases in a sharded cluster, each database is assigned to a dif- ferent shard. If you do nothing else, a database and all its collections will live forever on the shard where they were created. The databases themselves don’t even need to be sharded.   Because the name of a database is specified by the application, you can think of this as a kind of manual partitioning. MongoDB has nothing to do with how well-partitioned your data is. To see why this is manual, consider using this method to shard the spread- sheets collection in our documents example. To shard this two ways using database distribution, you’d have to make two databases—say files1 and files2—and evenly divide the data between the files1.spreadsheets and the files2.spreadsheets col- lections. It’s completely up to you to decide which spreadsheet goes in which collec- tion and come up with a scheme to query the appropriate database to find them later. This is a difficult problem, which is why we don’t recommend this approach for this type of application.    When  is  the  database  distribution  method  really  useful?  One  example  of  a  real application for database distribution is MongoDB as a service. In one implementation of this model, customers can pay for access to a single MongoDB database. On the backend, each database is created in a sharded cluster. This means that if each client uses roughly the same amount of data, the distribution of the data will be optimal due to the distribution of the databases throughout the cluster.  12.3.3 Sharding  within collections  Now, we’ll review the more powerful form of MongoDB sharding: sharding an individ- ual collection. This is what the phrase automatic sharding refers to, because this is the form of sharding in which MongoDB itself makes all the partitioning decisions, with- out any direct intervention from the application.   To allow for partitioning of an individual collection, MongoDB defines the idea of a chunk, which as you saw earlier is a logical grouping of documents, based on the values  www.it-ebooks.info   342  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  of a predetermined field or set of fields called a shard key. It’s the user’s responsibility to choose the shard key, and we’ll cover how to do this in section 12.8.   For example, consider the following document from a spreadsheet management  application:  {   _id: ObjectId "4d6e9b89b600c2c196442c21"    filename: "spreadsheet-1",   updated_at: ISODate "2011-03-02T19:22:54.845Z" ,   username: "banks",   data: "raw document data" }  If all the documents in our collection have this format, we can, for example, choose a shard key of the _id field and the username field. MongoDB will then use that infor- mation in each document to determine what chunk the document belongs to.   How does MongoDB make this determination? At its core, MongoDB’s sharding is range-based;  this  means  that  each  “chunk”  represents  a  range  of  shard  keys.  When MongoDB looks at a document to determine what chunk it belongs to, it first extracts the values for the shard key and then finds the chunk whose shard key range contains the given shard key values.   To see a concrete example of what this looks like, imagine that we chose a shard key of  username for this  spreadsheets collection, and we have two shards, “A” and “B.” Our chunk distribution may look something like table 12.1.  Table 12.1 Chunks and shards  Start  End  Shard  -  Abbot  Dayton  Harris  Norris  Abbot  Dayton  Harris  Norris    B  A  B  A  B  Looking at the table, it becomes a bit clearer what purpose chunks serve in a sharded cluster. If we gave you a document with a username field of "Babbage", you’d immedi- ately know that it should be on shard A, just by looking at the table above. In fact, if we gave you any document that had a username field, which in this case is our shard key, you’d be able to use table 12.1 to determine which chunk the document belonged to, and from there determine which shard it should be sent to. We’ll look into this pro- cess in much more detail in sections 12.5 and 12.6.   www.it-ebooks.info   12.4 Building a sample shard cluster  Building a sample shard cluster  343  The best way to get a handle on sharding is to see how it works in action. Fortunately, it’s possible to set up a sharded cluster on a single machine, and that’s exactly what we’ll do now.3    The full process of setting up a sharded cluster involves three phases:  1 Starting the mongod and mongos servers—The first step is to spawn all the indi- vidual mongod and mongos processes that make up the cluster. In the cluster we’re  setting  up  in  this  chapter,  we’ll  spawn  nine  mongod  servers  and  one mongos server.  2 Configuring the cluster—The next step is to update the configuration so that the replica sets are initialized and the shards are added to the cluster. After this, the nodes will all be able to communicate with each other.  3 Sharding collections—The last step is to shard a collection so that it can be spread across  multiple  shards.  The  reason  this  exists  as  a  separate  step  is  because MongoDB can have both sharded and unsharded collections in the same clus- ter, so you must explicitly tell it which ones you want to shard. In this chapter, we’ll  shard  our  only  collection,  which  is  the  spreadsheets  collection  of  the cloud-docs database.  We’ll cover each of these steps in detail in the next three sections. We’ll then simu- late  the  behavior  of  the  sample  cloud-based  spreadsheet  application  described  in the previous sections. Throughout the chapter we’ll examine the global shard con- figuration, and in the last section, we’ll use this to see how data is partitioned based on the shard key.  12.4.1 Starting the mongod and mongos servers  The first step in setting up a sharded cluster is to start all the required  mongod and mongos processes. The shard cluster you’ll build will consist of two shards and three config servers. You’ll also start a single mongos to communicate with the cluster. Fig- ure 12.3 shows a map of all the processes that you’ll launch, with their port numbers in parentheses.    You’ll runa bunch of commands to bring the cluster online, so if you find yourself  unable to see the forest because of the trees, refer back to this figure.  3 The idea is that you can run every mongod and mongos process on a single machine for testing. In section 12.7 we’ll look at production sharding configurations and the minimum number of machines required for a viable deployment.  www.it-ebooks.info   344  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  mongod   port 30000   mongod   port 30100   mongod   port 30000   mongod arbiter   port 30002   mongod   port 30101   mongod arbiter   port 30102   Shard-a  Config server   port 27019   Shard-b  mongos router   port 40000   Config server  Config server   port 27020    port 27021   Ruby application  load.rb   Config servers  Application and router  Figure 12.3 A map of processes comprising the sample shard cluster  STARTING THE SHARDING COMPONENTS Let’s start by creating the data directories for the two replica sets that will serve as our shards:  $ mkdir  data rs-a-1 $ mkdir  data rs-a-2 $ mkdir  data rs-a-3 $ mkdir  data rs-b-1 $ mkdir  data rs-b-2 $ mkdir  data rs-b-3  Next, start each mongod. Because you’re running so many processes, you’ll use the --fork option to run them in the background.4 The commands for starting the first replica set are as follows:   $ mongod --shardsvr --replSet shard-a --dbpath  data rs-a-1 \   --port 30000 --logpath  data rs-a-1.log --fork $ mongod --shardsvr --replSet shard-a --dbpath  data rs-a-2 \   --port 30001 --logpath  data rs-a-2.log --fork  4 If you’re running Windows, note that fork won’t work for you. Because you’ll have to open a new terminal  window for each process, you’re best off omitting the logpath option as well.  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a sample shard cluster  345  $ mongod --shardsvr --replSet shard-a  --dbpath  data rs-a-3 \   --port 30002 --logpath  data rs-a-3.log --fork  Here are the commands for the second replica set:  $ mongod --shardsvr --replSet shard-b --dbpath  data rs-b-1 \   --port 30100 --logpath  data rs-b-1.log --fork $ mongod --shardsvr --replSet shard-b --dbpath  data rs-b-2 \   --port 30101 --logpath  data rs-b-2.log --fork $ mongod --shardsvr --replSet shard-b --dbpath  data rs-b-3 \     --port 30102 --logpath  data rs-b-3.log --fork                 Make careful  note of all the  options that  differ between  nodes.  We won’t cover all the command-line options used here. To see what each of these flags means in more detail, it’s best to refer to the MongoDB documentation at http:   docs.mongodb.org manual reference program mongod  for the mongod program. As usual, you now need to initiate these replica sets. Connect to each one individually, run rs.initiate  , and then add the remaining nodes. The first should look like this:  $ mongo localhost:30000 > rs.initiate    You’ll have to wait a minute or so before the initial node becomes primary. During the process,  the  prompt  will  change  from  shard-a:SECONDARY>  to  shard-a:PRIMARY. Using  the  rs.status    command  will  also  reveal  more  information  about  what’s going on behind the scenes. Once it does, you can add the remaining nodes:   > rs.add "localhost:30001"  > rs.addArb "localhost:30002"    addArb means to add this node  to replica set as an arbiter.  Using localhost as the machine name might cause problems in the long run because it only works if you’re going to run all processes on a single machine. If you know your hostname, use it to get out of trouble. On a Mac, your hostname should look some- thing like MacBook-Pro.local. If you don’t know your hostname, make sure that you use localhost everywhere!   Configuring a replica set that you’ll use as a shard is exactly the same as configur- ing a replica set that you’ll use on its own, so refer back to chapter 10 if any of this rep- lica set setup looks unfamiliar to you.    Initiating  the  second  replica  set  is  similar.  Again,  wait  a  minute  after  running  rs.initiate  :  $ mongo localhost:30100 > rs.initiate   > rs.add "localhost:30100"  > rs.addArb "localhost:30101"   Finally, verify that both replica sets are online by running the rs.status   command from the shell on each one. If everything checks out, you’re ready to start the config  www.it-ebooks.info   346  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  servers.5 Now you create each config server’s data directory and then start a mongod for each one using the configsvr option:   $ mkdir  data config-1 $ mongod --configsvr --dbpath  data config-1 --port 27019 \   --logpath  data config-1.log --fork --nojournal $ mkdir  data config-2 $ mongod --configsvr --dbpath  data config-2 --port 27020 \   --logpath  data config-2.log --fork --nojournal $ mkdir  data config-3 $ mongod --configsvr --dbpath  data config-3 --port 27021 \   --logpath  data config-3.log --fork --nojournal  Ensure that each config server is up and running by connecting with the shell, or by tailing the log file  tail –f    and verifying that each process is listen- ing on the configured port. Looking at the logs for any one config server, you should see something like this:  Wed Mar  2 15:43:28 [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port 27020 Wed Mar  2 15:43:28 [websvr] web admin interface listening on port 28020  If each config server is running, you can go ahead and start the mongos. The mongos must be started with the configdb option, which takes a comma-separated list of con- fig database addresses:6  $ mongos --configdb localhost:27019,localhost:27020,localhost:27021 \   --logpath  data mongos.log --fork --port 40000  Once  again,  we  won’t  cover  all  the  command  line  options  we’re  using  here.  If  you want more details on what each option does, refer to the docs for the mongos program at http:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference program mongos .  12.4.2 Configuring the cluster  Now that you’ve started all the mongod and mongos processes that we’ll need for this cluster  see figure 12.2 , it’s time to configure the cluster. Start by connecting to the mongos. To simplify the task, you’ll use the sharding helper methods. These are meth- ods  run  on  the  global  sh  object.  To  see  a  list  of  all  available  helper  methods,  run sh.help  .   You’ll enter a series of configuration commands beginning with the addShard com- mand.  The  helper  for  this  command  is  sh.addShard  .  This  method  takes  a  string consisting of the name of a replica set, followed by the addresses of two or more seed  5 Again, if running on Windows, omit the --fork and --logpath options, and start each mongod in a new  window.  6 Be careful not to put spaces between the config server addresses when specifying them.  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a sample shard cluster  347  nodes for connecting. Here you specify the two replica sets you created along with the addresses of the two non-arbiter members of each set:  $ mongo localhost:40000 > sh.addShard "shard-a localhost:30000,localhost:30001"    { "shardAdded" : "shard-a", "ok" : 1 } > sh.addShard "shard-b localhost:30100,localhost:30101"    { "shardAdded" : "shard-b", "ok" : 1 }  If successful, the command response will include the name of the shard just added. You  can  examine  the  config  database’s  shards  collection  to  see  the  effect  of  your work. Instead of using the use command, you’ll use the getSiblingDB   method to switch databases:   > db.getSiblingDB "config" .shards.find   { "_id" : "shard-a", "host" : "shard-a localhost:30000,localhost:30001" } { "_id" : "shard-b", "host" : "shard-b localhost:30100,localhost:30101" }  As a shortcut, the listshards command returns the same information:  > use admin > db.runCommand {listshards: 1}   While we’re on the topic of reporting on sharding configuration, the shell’s sh.sta- tus   method nicely summarizes the cluster. Go ahead and try running it now.  The next configuration step is to enable sharding on a database. This doesn’t do any- thing on its own, but it’s a prerequisite for sharding any collection within a database. Your application’s database will be called cloud-docs, so you enable sharding like this:  > sh.enableSharding "cloud-docs"   As before, you can check the config data to see the change you just made. The config database  holds  a  collection  called  databases  that  contains  a  list  of  databases.  Each document specifies the database’s primary shard location and whether it’s partitioned  whether sharding is enabled :  > db.getSiblingDB "config" .databases.find   { "_id" : "admin", "partitioned" : false, "primary" : "config" } { "_id" : "cloud-docs", "partitioned" : true, "primary" : "shard-a" }  Now all you need to do is shard the spreadsheets collection. When you shard a col- lection, you define a shard key. Here you’ll use the compound shard key {username: 1, _id: 1} because it’s good for distributing data and makes it easy to view and com- prehend chunk ranges:   > sh.shardCollection "cloud-docs.spreadsheets", {username: 1, _id: 1}   12.4.3 Sharding collections  www.it-ebooks.info   348  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  Again, you can verify the configuration by checking the config database for sharded collections:  > db.getSiblingDB "config" .collections.findOne   {   "_id" : "cloud-docs.spreadsheets",     "lastmod" : ISODate "1970-01-16T00:50:07.268Z" ,   "dropped" : false,   "key" : {            "username" : 1,     "_id" : 1   },   "unique" : false }  Shard key of the  collection we  just sharded  Full namespace of the  collection we just sharded  Don’t  worry  too  much  about  understanding  all  the  fields  in  this  document.  This  is internal  metadata  that  MongoDB  uses  to  track  collections,  and  it  isn’t  meant  to  be accessed directly by users. SHARDING AN EMPTY COLLECTION This sharded collection definition may remind you of something: it looks a bit like an index definition, especially with its unique key. When you shard an empty collection, MongoDB  creates  an  index  corresponding  to  the  shard  key  on  each  shard.7  Verify this  for  yourself  by  connecting  directly  to  a  shard  and  running  the  getIndexes   method. Here you connect to your first shard, and the output contains the shard key index, as expected:  $ mongo localhost:30000 > use cloud-docs > db.spreadsheets.getIndexes   [   {     "name" : "_id_",     "ns" : "cloud-docs.spreadsheets",     "key" : {          "_id" : 1     },     "v" : 0   },   {     "ns" : "cloud-docs.spreadsheets",     "key" : {         "username" : 1,       "_id" : 1     },     "name" : "username_1__id_1",     "v" : 0   } ]  _id index, which is  automatically created  for all collections  Compound index on  username and _id  created, because we  sharded this collection  on that key  7 If you’re sharding an existing collection, you’ll have to create an index corresponding to the shard key before  you run the shardcollection command.  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a sample shard cluster  349  Once you’ve sharded the collection, sharding is ready to go. You can now write to the cluster and data will distribute. You’ll see how that works in the next section.  12.4.4 Writing to a sharded cluster  We’ll insert some documents into the sharded cluster so you can observe the forma- tion and movement of chunks, which is the essence of MongoDB’s sharding. The sam- ple documents, each representing a single spreadsheet, will look like this:  {   _id: ObjectId "4d6f29c0e4ef0123afdacaeb" ,   filename: "sheet-1",   updated_at: new Date  ,   username: "banks",   data: "RAW DATA" }  Note that the data field will contain a 5 KB string to simulate user data.   This book’s source code for this chapter includes a Ruby script you can use to write documents to the cluster. The script takes a number of iterations as its argument, and for each iteration, it inserts one 5  KB document for each of 200 users. The script’s source is here:  Connection to  MongoDB using  the Ruby driver  Function to  actually insert  data into  MongoDB  require 'rubygems' require 'mongo' require 'names' @con  = Mongo::MongoClient.new "localhost", 40000     @col  = @con['cloud-docs']['spreadsheets']            @data = "abcde" * 1000 def write_user_docs iterations=0, name_count=200           iterations.times do iteration                            name_count.times do name_number                          doc = { :filename => "sheet-{iteration}",                       :updated_at => Time.now.utc,                             :username => Names::LIST[name_number],                   :data => @data                                         }                                                  @col.insert doc                                        end                                                    end                                                    end                                                      if ARGV.empty?  ! ARGV[0] =~  ^\d+$     puts "Usage: load.rb [iterations] [name_count]" else   iterations = ARGV[0].to_i   if ARGV[1] && ARGV[1] =~  ^\d+$      name_count = ARGV[1].to_i   else     name_count = 200   end   write_user_docs iterations, name_count  end  www.it-ebooks.info   350  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  If you have the script on hand, you can run it from the command line with no argu- ments to insert the initial iteration of 200 values:  $ ruby load.rb 1  Now connect to mongos via the shell. If you query the spreadsheets collection, you’ll see that it contains exactly 200 documents and that they total around 1 MB. You can also query a document, but be sure to exclude the sample data field  you don’t want to print 5 KB of text to the screen :  $ mongo localhost:40000 > use cloud-docs > db.spreadsheets.count   200 > db.spreadsheets.stats  .size 1019496 > db.spreadsheets.findOne {}, {data: 0}  {   "_id" : ObjectId "4d6d6b191d41c8547d0024c2" ,   "username" : "Cerny",   "updated_at" : ISODate "2011-03-01T21:54:33.813Z" ,   "filename" : "sheet-0" }  CHECK ON THE SHARDS Now you can check out what’s happened sharding-wise. Switch to the config database and check the number of chunks:  > use config > db.chunks.count   1  There’s only one chunk so far. Let’s see how it looks:   > db.chunks.findOne   {   "_id" : "cloud-docs.spreadsheets-username_MinKey_id_MinKey",   "lastmod" : {     "t" : 1000,     "i" : 0   },   "ns" : "cloud-docs.spreadsheets",   "min" : {       "username" : { $minKey : 1 },     "_id" : { $minKey : 1 }   },   "max" : {      "username" : { $maxKey : 1 },     "_id" : { $maxKey : 1 }   },   "shard" : "shard-a" }  max field  min field  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a sample shard cluster  351  Can  you  figure  out  what  range  this  chunk  represents?  If  there’s  only  one  chunk,  it spans the entire sharded collection. That’s borne out by the min and max fields, which show that the chunk’s range is bounded by $minKey and $maxKey.  minKey and maxKey $minKey and $maxKey are used in comparison operations as the boundaries of BSON types. BSON is MongoDB’s native data format. $minKey always compares lower than all BSON types, and $maxKey compares greater than all BSON types. Because the value for any given field can contain any BSON type, MongoDB uses these two types to mark the chunk endpoints at the extremities of the sharded collection.  You can see a more interesting chunk range by adding more data to the spreadsheets collection.  You’ll  use  the  Ruby  script  again,  but  this  time  you’ll  run  100  iterations, which will insert an extra 20,000 documents totaling 100 MB:  $ ruby load.rb 100  Verify that the insert worked:  > db.spreadsheets.count   20200 > db.spreadsheets.stats  .size 103171828  Sample insert speed Note that it may take several minutes to insert this data into the shard cluster. There are two main reasons for the slowness:   1 You’re performing a round-trip for each insert, whereas you might be able to per-  form bulk inserts in a production situation.   2 Most significantly, you’re running all of the shard’s nodes on a single machine. This places a huge burden on the disk because four of your nodes are being writ- ten to simultaneously  two replica set primaries and two replicating secondaries .   Suffice it to say that in a proper production installation, this insert would run much more quickly.  Having  inserted  this  much  data,  you’ll  definitely  have  more  than  one  chunk.  You can  check  the  chunk  state  quickly  by  counting  the  number  of  documents  in  the chunks collection:   > use config > db.chunks.count   10  www.it-ebooks.info   352  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  You  can  see  more  detailed  information  by  running  sh.status  .  This  method prints all of the chunks along with their ranges. For brevity, we’ll only show the first two chunks:  > sh.status   sharding version: { "_id" : 1, "version" : 3 }  shards:  { "_id": "shard-a", "host": "shard-a localhost:30000,localhost:30001" }  { "_id": "shard-b", "host": "shard-b localhost:30100,localhost:30101" }  databases:  { "_id": "admin", "partitioned": false, "primary": "config" }  { "_id": "test",  "partitioned": false, "primary": "shard-a" }  { "_id": "cloud-docs", "partitioned": true,  "primary": "shard-b" }     shard-a 5     shard-b 5   { "username": { $minKey : 1 }, "_id" : { $minKey : 1 } } -->>   {      "username": "Abdul",                                                 "_id": ObjectId "4e89ffe7238d3be9f0000012"  }                      on: shard-a { "t" : 2000, "i" : 0 }                                   { "username" : "Abdul",                                          "_id" : ObjectId "4e89ffe7238d3be9f0000012"  } -->> {          "username" : "Buettner",                                       "_id" : ObjectId "4e8a00a0238d3be9f0002e98"  }               on : shard-a { "t" : 3000, "i" : 0 }                         Second chunk  starting from where  the first chunk ended  First chunk  starting from  the minimum  key  SEEING DATA ON MULTIPLE SHARDS  The picture has definitely changed. As you can see in figure 12.4, you now have 10 chunks. Naturally, each chunk represents a contiguous range of data.   You can see in figure 12.4 that shard-a has a chunk that ranges from one of Abdul’s documents to one of Buettner’s documents, just as you saw in our output. This means that all the documents with a shard key that lies between these two values will either be inserted into, or found on, shard-a.8 You can also see in the figure that shard-b has  Shard-a  Shard-b  {"username":"Abdul","_id"…}->  {"username":"Lee","_id"…}->  {"username":"Hawkins",…}  {"username":"Stewart",…}  Figure 12.4 The chunk distribution of the spreadsheets collection  8 If you’re following along and running all these examples for yourself, note that your chunk distributions may  differ somewhat.  www.it-ebooks.info   Building a sample shard cluster  353  some chunks too, in particular the chunk ranging from one of Lee’s documents to one  of  Stewart’s  documents,  which  means  any  document  with  a  shard  key  between those two values belongs on shard-b. You could visually scan the sh.status   output to see all the chunks, but there’s a more direct way: running a query on the chunks collection that filters on the name of the shard and counting how many documents would be returned:  > db.chunks.count {"shard": "shard-a"}  5 > db.chunks.count {"shard": "shard-b"}  5  As long as the cluster’s data size is small, the splitting algorithm dictates that splits hap- pen often. That’s what you see now. This is an optimization that gives you a good dis- tribution of data and chunks early on. From now on, as long as writes remain evenly distributed across the existing chunk ranges, few migrations will occur.  Splits and migrations Behind  the  scenes,  MongoDB  relies  on  two  mechanisms  to  keep  the  cluster  bal- anced: splits and migrations.  Splitting is the process of dividing a chunk into two smaller chunks. This happens when a chunk exceeds the maximum chunk size, currently 64 MB by default. Splitting is necessary because chunks that are too large are unwieldy and hard to distribute evenly throughout the cluster.  Migrating is the process of moving chunks between shards. When some shards have significantly more chunks than others, this triggers something called a migra- tion round. During a migration round, chunks are migrated from shards with many chunks to shards with fewer chunks until the cluster is more evenly balanced. As you can imagine, of the two operations, migrating is significantly more expensive than splitting.  In practice, these operations shouldn’t affect you, but it’s useful to be aware that they’re happening in case you run into a performance issue. If your inserts are well- distributed, the data set on all your shards should increase at roughly the same rate, meaning that the number of chunks will also grow at roughly the same rate and expen- sive migrations will be relatively infrequent.  Now the split threshold will increase. You can see how the splitting slows down, and how chunks start to grow toward their max size, by doing a more massive insert. Try adding another 800 MB to the cluster. Once again, we’ll use the Ruby script, remem- bering that it inserts about 1 MB on each iteration:  $ ruby load.rb 800  www.it-ebooks.info   354  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  This will take a lot of time to run, so you may want to step away and grab a snack after starting this load process. By the time it’s done, you’ll have increased the total data size by a factor of 8. But if you check the chunking status, you’ll see that there are only around twice as many chunks:  > use config > db.chunks.count   21  Given that there are more chunks, the average chunk ranges will be smaller, but each chunk  will  include  more  data.  For  example,  the  first  chunk  in  the  collection  spans from Abbott to Bender but it’s already nearly 60 MB in size. Because the max chunk size is currently 64 MB by default, you’d soon see this chunk split if you were to con- tinue inserting data.    Another  thing  to  note  is  that  the  distribution  still  looks  pretty  even,  as  it  did  before:  > db.chunks.count {"shard": "shard-a"}  11 > db.chunks.count {"shard": "shard-b"}  10  Although the number of chunks has increased during the last 800 MB insert round, you can probably assume that no migrations occurred; a likely scenario is that each of the original chunks split in two, with a single extra split somewhere in the mix. You can verify this by querying the config database’s changelog collection:  > db.changelog.count {what: "split"}  20 > db.changelog.find {what: "moveChunk.commit"} .count   6  This is in line with these assumptions. A total of 20 splits have occurred, yielding 20 chunks, but only 6 migrations have taken place. For an extra-deep look at what’s going on here, you can scan the change log entries. For instance, here’s the entry recording the first chunk move:  > db.changelog.findOne {what: "moveChunk.commit"}  {   "_id" : "localhost-2011-09-01T20:40:59-2",   "server" : "localhost",   "clientAddr" : "127.0.0.1:55749",   "time" : ISODate "2011-03-01T20:40:59.035Z" ,   "what" : "moveChunk.commit",   "ns" : "cloud-docs.spreadsheets",  www.it-ebooks.info   Querying and indexing a shard cluster  355    "details" : {     "min" : {                                               "username" : { $minKey : 1 },                         "_id" : { $minKey : 1 }                             },                                                    "max" : {                                               "username" : "Abbott",                                "_id" : ObjectId "4d6d57f61d41c851ee000092"         },                                                    "from" : "shard-a",        "to" : "shard-b"       } }  Shard that the  chunk was  moved to  Shard that the  chunk was  moved from  Details about  the chunk that  was moved  Here you see the movement of chunks from shard-a to shard-b. In general, the docu- ments you find in the change log are quite readable. As you learn more about shard- ing and begin prototyping your own shard clusters, the config change log makes an excellent live reference on split and migrate behavior. Refer to it often.  12.5 Querying and indexing a shard cluster  From the application’s perspective, there’s no difference between querying a sharded cluster and querying a single mongod. In both cases, the query interface and the pro- cess of iterating over the result set are the same. But behind the scenes, things are dif- ferent, and it’s worthwhile to understand exactly what’s going on.  12.5.1 Query routing  Imagine  you’re  querying  a  sharded  cluster.  How  many  shards  does  mongos  need  to contact to return a proper query response? If you give it some thought, you’ll see that it depends on whether the shard key is present in the query selector that we pass to find  and  similar  operations.  Remember  that  the  config  servers   and  thus  mongos  maintain a mapping of shard key ranges to shards. These mappings are none other than the chunks we examined earlier in the chapter. If a query includes the shard key, then  mongos  can  quickly  consult  the  chunk  data  to  determine  exactly  which  shard contains the query’s result set. This is called a targeted query.   But if the shard key isn’t part of the query, the query planner will have to visit all shards to fulfill the query completely. This is known as a global or scatter gather query. The diagram in figure 12.5 illustrates both query types.   Figure 12.5 shows a cluster with two shards, two mongos routers, and two applica- tion servers. The shard key for this cluster is {username: 1, _id: 1}. We’ll discuss how to choose a good shard key in section 12.6.  www.it-ebooks.info   356  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  Shard-a   replica set   Shard-b   replica set   Queries only the shard with the chunk containing documents with “Abbott” as the shard key  Query cannot be isolated using chunk information so it is sent to all shards  mongos  mongos  find {username:"Abbott"}   find {filename:"sheet-1"}   Application  Application  Targeted queries  Global queries   query selector has   query selector lacks  shard key   shard key   Figure 12.5 Targeted and global queries against a shard cluster  To the left of the figure, you can see a targeted query that includes the username field in its query selector. In this case, the mongos router can use the value of the username field to route the query directly to the correct shard.   To the right of the figure, you can see a global or scatter gather query that doesn’t include any part of the shard key in its query selector. In this case, the mongos router must broadcast the query to both shards.   The effect of query targeting on performance cannot be overstated. If all your que- ries are global, that means each shard must respond to every single query against your cluster. In contrast, if all your queries are targeted, each shard only needs to handle on average the total number of requests divided by the total number of shards. The implications for scalability are clear.   But targeting isn’t the only thing that affects performance in a sharded cluster. As you’ll see in the next section, everything you’ve learned about the performance of  an  unsharded  deployment  still  applies  to  a  sharded  cluster,  but  to  each  shard individually.  12.5.2 Indexing in a sharded cluster  No matter how well-targeted your queries are, they must eventually run on at least one shard. This means that if your shards are slow to respond to queries, your cluster will be slow as well.  www.it-ebooks.info   Querying and indexing a shard cluster  357   As in an unsharded deployment, indexing is an important part of optimizing per- formance. There are only a few key points to keep in mind about indexing that are specific to a sharded cluster:    Each shard maintains its own indexes. When you declare an index on a sharded collection, each shard builds a separate index for its portion of the collection. For example, when you issue the db.spreadsheets.createIndex   command while  connected  to  a  mongos router, each shard processes the index creation command individually. It  follows  that  the  sharded  collections  on  each  shard  should  have  the  same indexes. If this ever isn’t the case, you’ll see inconsistent query performance.       Sharded collections permit unique indexes on the _id field and on the shard key  only.  Unique  indexes  are  prohibited  elsewhere  because  enforcing  them would  require  inter-shard  communication,  which  is  against  the  fundamental design of sharding in MongoDB.  Once you understand how queries are routed and how indexing works, you should be in a good position to write smart queries and indexes for your sharded cluster. Most of the advice on indexing and query optimization from chapter 8 will apply.   In the next section, we’ll cover the powerful explain   tool, which you can use to  see exactly what path is taken by a query against your cluster.  12.5.3 The explain   tool in a sharded cluster  The explain   tool is your primary way to troubleshoot and optimize queries. It can show you exactly how your query would be executed, including whether it can be tar- geted  and  whether  it  can  use  an  index.  The  following  listing  shows  an  example  of what this output might look like.

Consult  the  documentation  at https:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference method cursor.explain  for your spe- cific version if you see any fields you don’t understand.  12.5.4 Aggregation in a sharded cluster  It’s  worth  noting  that  the  aggregation  framework  also  benefits  from  sharding.  The analysis  of  an  aggregation  is  a  bit  more  complicated  than  a  single  query,  and  may change between versions as new optimizations are introduced. Fortunately, the aggre- gation framework also has an explain   option that you can use to see details about how your query would perform. As a basic rule of thumb, the number of shards that an aggregation operation needs to contact is dependent on the data that the opera- tion needs as input to complete. For example, if you’re counting every document in your  entire  database,  you’ll  need  to  query  all  shards,  but  if  you’re  only  counting  a small range of documents, you may not need to query every shard. Consult the cur- rent  documentation  at  https:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference method db .collection.aggregate  for more details.   12.6 Choosing a shard key  In  section  12.3  you  saw  how  the  shard  key  is  used  to  split  a  collection  into  logical ranges called chunks, and in section 12.5.1 you saw how the mongos can use this infor- mation to figure out where a set of documents might be located.   In this section, we’ll discuss in depth the vitally important process of choosing a  shard  key.  A  poorly  chosen  shard  key  will  prevent  your  application  from  taking  www.it-ebooks.info   360  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  advantage  of  many  of  the  benefits  provided  by  sharding.  In  the  pathological  case, both insert and query performance will be significantly impaired. Adding to the grav- ity of the decision is that once you’ve chosen a shard key, you’re stuck with it. Shard keys are immutable.9   The best way to understand the pitfalls of a bad shard key is to walk through the process of finding a good one step by step and analyze in depth each shard key you consider along the way. That’s exactly what we’ll do now, using the spreadsheet appli- cation as an example.   After we find an optimal shard key for our spreadsheet application, at the end of the chapter we’ll consider how our shard key choice would have been different if we’d instead been designing a system to support an email application. This will highlight how much the optimal shard key depends on the specifics of each application.   As we walk through the process of choosing a shard key for our spreadsheet appli-  cation, you’ll see three main pitfalls:     Hotspots—Some  shard  keys  result  in  situations  where  all  reads  or  writes  are going to a single chunk, on a single shard. This can cause one shard to be com- pletely overwhelmed, while the others are sitting idle.    Unsplittable chunks—A shard key that’s too coarse-grained can result in a situation where there are many documents with the same shard key. Because sharding is based on ranges of shard keys, this means that the documents can’t be split into separate chunks, which can limit MongoDB’s ability to evenly distribute data.    Poor targeting—Even if writes are distributed perfectly in the cluster, if our shard key doesn’t have some relationship to our queries, we’ll have poor query per- formance.  You  saw  this  in  section  12.5.1  when  we  discussed  global  and  tar- geted queries.  Now we’ll begin the process of finding the best shard key for our spreadsheet applica- tion and see firsthand how each of these situations can come up in practice.  12.6.1 Imbalanced writes  hotspots   The first shard key you may consider is { "_id" : 1 }, which will shard on the _id field. The _id field may initially seem like a great candidate: it must be present in every doc- ument, it has an index by default, you may have it in many of your queries, and it’s automatically generated by MongoDB using the BSON Object ID type, which is essen- tially a GUID  globally unique identifier .    But there’s one glaring problem with using an Object ID as a shard key: its values are  strictly  ascending.  This  means  that  every  new  document  will  have  a  shard  key larger than any other document in the collection. Why is this a problem? If the system is already completely balanced, that means every new document will go to the same  9 Note that there’s no good way to alter the shard key once you’ve created it. Your best bet is to create a new sharded collection with the proper key, export the data from the old sharded collection, and then restore the data to the new one.  www.it-ebooks.info   Choosing a shard key  361  Ascending shard key   = document number  n  ["n":1003,…}  ["n":1001,…}  ["n":1002,…}  {"n:{"$minKey":1}}  ->{"n":10}  …  {"n":1000}->  {"n":{$maxKey":}}  Figure 12.6 The ascending shard key causing all writes to go to one chunk.  chunk, which is the chunk that ranges up to $maxKey. This issue is best understood with an example, as shown in figure 12.6.   For simplicity, rather than using a BSON Object ID to illustrate the problem with ascending shard keys, this example uses the document number, which is stored in the field n. As you can see, we’ve already inserted documents 1 to 1000, and we’re about to insert  documents  1001,  1002,  and  1003.  Because  MongoDB  hadn’t  seen  anything above 1000 before that point, it had no reason to split the chunk ranging from 1000 to $maxKey. This means that the three new documents all belong in that chunk, and so will all new documents.    To see how this might affect a real application, consider using the ascending BSON Object id field as the shard key for the spreadsheet application. Practically, what this means is that every new spreadsheet that gets created will belong in the same chunk, which  means  that  every  new  document  will  need  to  be  written  to  the  single  shard responsible  for  storing  that  chunk.  This  is  where  the  performance  issue  becomes clear. Even if you have a hundred shards, all your writes will be sent to a single one while the rest sit idle. On top of that, MongoDB will do its best to migrate data off the overloaded shard, which will slam it even more.   This effectively nullifies one of sharding’s greatest benefits: the automatic distribu- tion of the insert load across machines.10 All that said, if you still want to use the _id field as your shard key, you have two options:    First, you can override the _id field with your own identifier that isn’t ascend- ing. If you choose this approach, however, take care to remember that _id must be unique even in a sharded cluster.    Alternatively,  you  can  make  your  shard  key  on  _id  a  hashed  shard  key.  This instructs MongoDB to use the output of a hash function on the shard key, rather  10 Note that an ascending shard key shouldn’t affect updates as long as documents are updated randomly.  www.it-ebooks.info   362  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  than using the shard key directly. Because the hash function is designed to have an output that appears randomly distributed, this will ensure that your inserts are  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  cluster.  But  this  also  means  that  range queries will have to span multiple shards, because even documents with shard keys that are similar may hash to completely different values.  Uniqueness gotchas MongoDB can only ensure that the shard key is unique. It can’t enforce uniqueness on any other key because one shard can’t check another shard to see if there are duplicates. Surprisingly, this also includes the  _id field, which is required to be unique.  By  default,  MongoDB  generates  the  _id  field  using  a  BSON  Object  ID. Great care was taken in the design of this data type to ensure that, statistically speaking, it would be unique across the cluster. Because of this, beware of overrid- ing the _id field yourself. If you don’t properly enforce uniqueness on the client side, you could lose data when two documents with the same _id field are migrated to the same shard.  12.6.2 Unsplittable chunks  coarse granularity   Now you know that { "_id" : 1 } won’t work as a shard key, but what about { "user- name" : 1 }? This looks like a good candidate because when we’re querying or updat- ing a spreadsheet, we generally already know what user the spreadsheet belongs to, so we can include the username field in our query and get good targeting. Additionally, sharding on the username field will also lead to relatively well-balanced inserts because the distribution of inserts across users should be relatively even.    There’s just one problem with this field: it’s so coarse that we may end up in a sit- uation  where  one  chunk  grows  without  bound.  To  see  this,  imagine  that  the  user “Verch” decides to store 10 GB of spreadsheet data. This would bring the size of the chunk containing the documents with a username of “Verch” well above our 64 MB maximum.   Normally, when a chunk gets too large, MongoDB can split the chunk into smaller pieces and rebalance them across the cluster. However, in this case, there’s no place the chunk can be split, because it already contains only a single shard key value. This causes  a  number  of  technical  problems,  but  the  end  result  is  that  your  cluster  will become imbalanced, and MongoDB won’t be able to rebalance effectively.   12.6.3 Poor targeting  shard key not present in queries   After seeing all these problems, you may want to throw up your hands and say “Fine, I’ll  just  pick  a  completely  random  shard  key.  It’s  unique  and  it’s  not  ascending.” Although that does solve the problem of writes, it isn’t a good shard key if you ever intend to read from your cluster. As you saw in section 12.5.1, queries can only be routed to  the  correct  shard  if  they  include  the  shard  key.  If  your  shard  key  is  completely  www.it-ebooks.info   Choosing a shard key  363  random, then at the time you’re querying for a document, chances are you’ll have no idea what the shard key is. You probably will know the username you’re looking for, or the ID of the document, which is why those fields were so appealing in the first place. This means that the router will have to result to a global broadcast, which can hurt performance.    That said, if you’re writing an application where all you need to do is dump a large amount of data and you don’t need selective queries—for example, in an application where  you’re  collecting  sensor  data  to  analyze  later  in  large  batches   where  you’re processing such a large portion of the data that you’ll need to query all the shards any- way —a random unique shard key may not be a bad idea. In fact, if you can guarantee uniqueness  by making it a GUID using some library that provides this guarantee  and ensure that it’s not ascending, you can even override the _id field.   12.6.4 Ideal shard keys  So far you’ve seen three things that you need to consider when choosing a shard key. One is how reads are targeted, the second is how well writes are distributed, and the last is how effectively MongoDB can split and migrate chunks in your collection. Each key satisfied some of these properties but failed in others. How can you pick a shard key that works for all three? The answer, as you might expect, is using a com- pound  shard  key  that  provides  all  these  benefits.  In  this  case,  that  shard  key  is  { username  :  1,  _id  :  1  }.  This  has  good  targeting  because  the  username  field  will often be present in our reads, has good write balancing because username has values that are evenly distributed throughout the alphabet, and is fine-grained enough for MongoDB to split chunks because it includes the _id field, which is unique. See fig- ure 12.7 for an example.   {"username":"Verch","_id":45}-> {"username":"Versace","_id":3}  {"username":"Verch","_id":45}->  {"username":"Verch","_id":98}  {"username":"Verch","_id":98}-> {"username":"Versace","_id":3}  Figure 12.7 Splitting a chunk that was previously unsplittable when sharding only on username   Here we can see a split on a chunk that we couldn’t split when we sharded only on the username field. Now, because we include the _id field, we can split all the documents from "Verch" into two separate chunks, which we couldn’t have done if our shard key was { "username" : 1 }.   www.it-ebooks.info   364  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  Indexing matters This chapter is all about choosing an effective shard key, but it’s important to keep in mind that indexing is still just as important as it was for a single node. As we dis- cussed in section 12.5.2, even if your shard key is perfect and each query is routed to a single shard, if the performance on each shard is poor, your overall performance will still be poor. For this reason, MongoDB requires an index to be created on the shard key before a collection is sharded. There’s no technical reason for this, other than the fact that it’d be a common mistake to leave this out if it wasn’t done auto- matically. As you design your sharded system, be sure to keep in mind everything you learned about indexing on a single node. It’s just as important in a sharded cluster, and likely more so because you’re operating at a larger scale.   One important factor to consider is index locality. This refers to how close together subsequent inserts are in the index. In this case, random inserts will perform poorly because the entire index must be loaded into memory, whereas sequential inserts will perform well because only the end of the index will need to be in memory at any given time. This is in direct contrast to the requirement that shard keys aren’t ascend- ing and illustrates the fact that proper indexing and optimal shard key choice must be each given dedicated attention when designing a sharded system.   Fortunately, the shard key { "username" : 1, "_id" : 1 } that we chose earlier satisfies  all  the  requirements.  It’s  well-distributed  on  username,  so  it’s  balanced from the cluster perspective, but it’s ascending on _id, so it’s also ascending for each username, thus providing good index locality.  12.6.5 Inherent design trade-offs  email application   Sometimes in sharding there are inherent design trade-offs that must be dealt with. Our spreadsheet example was a clean example of sharding because both the writes  document creation  and reads  document viewing  are correlated by username, so the shard key we chose in the previous section provides good performance on both. But what if we have an application where we need to query based on a field that isn’t correlated with our write patterns? For example, what if we’re building an email appli- cation  where  we  need  to  send  emails  and  read  inboxes?  This  may  not  seem  like  a problem  at  first,  until  you  realize  that  writes  are  correlated  to  the  sender  whereas reads are correlated to the recipient. Because anyone can in theory send an email to anyone else, it’s difficult to predict the relationship between these two fields. In this section,  we’ll  consider  two  approaches.  First,  we’ll  take  the  more  straightforward approach and shard based on sender, and then we’ll see how sharding on recipient can change our usage patterns. These two approaches are shown in figure 12.8. SHARDING ON SENDER Our first tactic may be to shard on sender. This seems to be a sensible choice—each email has exactly one sender. In this case, our write patterns are good: each write will go to one and only one shard. What happens when we need to read a user’s inbox? If we’re sharding based on sender and then piecing together all the emails a user has  www.it-ebooks.info   Sharding in production  365  Send email  Read inbox  Send email  Read inbox  Sharding on sender  Sharding on recipient  Figure 12.8 Overview of two ways an email application might be sharded  received, we need to do a full global broadcast query, as shown in figure 12.8, because we have no idea who any given user has received emails from.  SHARDING ON RECIPIENT Our next tactic may be to shard on recipient. This is a bit more complicated because every email must be written to multiple locations to ensure every recipient gets a copy, as shown in figure 12.8. This unfortunately means that our writes will take longer and put more load on the cluster. But this approach has one nice side effect; the query to read a user’s inbox is well-targeted, so reads will return quickly and scale well.    What’s the right approach? That’s a difficult question to answer precisely, but for this application, the second approach is likely better. This is for two reasons. One is that users may read their inbox more often than they send emails, and the other is that it’s easier for users to conceptualize that taking an action such as sending an email requires real work but may not realize that reading their inbox does, too. How often have you heard “I can’t even load my inbox!” as if that’s somehow the easiest thing for their  email  application  to  do?  In  the  end,  this  is  all  speculation  and,  like  any  real- world application, requires careful measurement and testing to determine what the usage patterns are.    What this example illustrates is the fact that your shard key depends on the specif- ics of your application. There’s no magic bullet shard key that covers all use cases, so remember to think about what your read and write patterns are expected to be.   So far we’ve discussed in great detail the theory behind sharding, as well as how to configure the parameters in a way that will optimize the performance of your system. In the next section, we’ll get to the details of what else you might want to think about when setting up a sharded cluster in the real world.   12.7 Sharding in production  Earlier  in  this  chapter,  we  created  a  fully  functional  sharded  cluster,  all  on  one machine. Although this is great for testing, it’d be a terrible way to deploy sharding in production.  www.it-ebooks.info   366  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding   Fortunately, that’s exactly what we’ll cover in this next section. We’ll look at the three general categories of production concerns and the order in which they arise. The first, provisioning, is how to best allocate machines and resources for use by MongoDB processes. The next, deployment, consists of things that you need to think about before you start running this cluster in production for the first time, and the last, mainte- nance, is how to keep your new cluster running and healthy.  12.7.1 Provisioning  The first thing to consider when thinking about how to deploy your system is provi- sioning, or how to allocate resources and machines to MongoDB. DEPLOYMENT TOPOLOGIES To  launch  the  sample  MongoDB  shard  cluster,  you  had  to  start  a  total  of  nine  pro- cesses  three mongods for each replica set, plus three config servers . That’s a poten- tially  frightening  number.  First-time  users  might  assume  that  running  a  two-shard cluster in production would require nine separate machines. Fortunately, fewer are needed. You can see why by looking at the expected resource requirements for each component of the cluster.   Consider first the replica sets. Each replicating member contains a complete copy of the data for its shard and may run as a primary or secondary node. These processes will always require enough disk space to store their copy of the data, and enough RAM to serve that data efficiently. Thus, replicating mongods are the most resource-intensive processes in a shard cluster and must be given their own machines.   What about replica set arbiters? These processes are like any other member of the replica set, except they don’t store any data besides replica set config data, which is  minimal.  Hence,  arbiters  incur  little  overhead  and  certainly  don’t  need  their own servers.   Next are the config servers. These also store a relatively small amount of data. For instance, the data on the config servers managing the sample replica set totaled only about 30 KB. If you assume that this data will grow linearly with shard cluster data size, then a 1 TB shard cluster might swell the config servers’ data size to a mere 30 MB.11 This means that config servers don’t necessarily need their own machines, either. But given the critical role played by the config servers, some users prefer to place them on a few modestly provisioned machines  or virtual instances .   From what you already know about replica sets and shard clusters, you can con-  struct a list of minimum deployment requirements:     Each  member  of  a  replica  set,  whether  it’s  a  complete  replica  or  an  arbiter,  needs to live on a distinct machine.    Every replicating replica set member needs its own machine.  11 That’s a highly conservative estimate. The real value will likely be far smaller.  www.it-ebooks.info   Sharding in production  367    Replica  set  arbiters  are  lightweight  enough  to  share  a  machine  with  another  process. Refer back to chapter 10 for more on arbiters.    Config servers can optionally share a machine. The only hard requirement is  that all config servers in the config cluster reside on distinct machines.  Satisfying these rules might feel like tackling a logic problem. Fortunately, we’ll apply them  now  by  looking  at  two  reasonable  deployment  topologies  for  the  sample  two- shard cluster. The first requires only four machines. The process layout is illustrated in figure 12.9.   This configuration satisfies all the deployment rules just mentioned. Predominant on each machine are the replicating nodes of each shard. The remaining processes are arranged so that all three config servers and all members of each replica set live on different machines. To speak of fault tolerance, this topology will tolerate the fail- ure of any one machine. No matter which machine fails, the cluster will continue to process reads and writes. If the failing machine happens to host one of the config  Shard-a mongod  27017   Shard-a mongod  27017   Config server  27019   Config server  27019   Shard-b arbiter  30000   Machine 1  Machine 2  Shard-b mongod  27017   Shard-b mongod  27017   Config server  27019   Shard-a arbiter  30000   Machine 3  Machine 4  Figure 12.9 A two-shard cluster deployed across four machines  www.it-ebooks.info   368  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  Shard-a mongod  27017   Config server  27019   Shard-a mongod  27017   Datacenter   main   Machine 1  Machine 2  Shard-b mongod  27017   Config server  27019   Shard-b mongod  27017   Machine 3  Machine 4  Datacenter  recovery   Shard-a mongod  27017  priority 0  Config server  27019   Shard-b mongod  27017  priority 0  Machine 5  Machine 6  Figure 12.10 A two-shard cluster deployed across six machines and two  datacenters  servers, all chunk splits and migrations will be suspended.12 Fortunately, suspending sharding  operations  doesn’t  prevent  the  cluster  from  servicing  operations;  splitting and migrating can wait until the lost machine is recovered.   That’s the minimum recommend setup for a two-shard cluster. But applications demanding the highest availability and the fastest paths to recovery will need some- thing more robust. As discussed in the previous chapter, a replica set consisting of two replicas and one arbiter is vulnerable while recovering. Having three nodes reduces the fragility of the set during recovery and also allows you to keep a node in a second- ary  datacenter  for  disaster  recovery.  Figure  12.10  shows  a  robust  two-shard  cluster topology. Each shard consists of a three-node replica set, where each node contains a complete copy of the data. For disaster recovery, one config server and one node from each shard are located in a secondary datacenter; to ensure that those nodes never become primary, they’re given a priority of 0.   12 All three config servers need to be online for any sharding operations to take place.  www.it-ebooks.info   12.7.2 Deployment  Sharding in production  369   With this configuration, each shard is replicated twice, not just once. Additionally, the secondary datacenter has all the data necessary for a user to completely recon- struct the shard cluster in the event of the failure of the first datacenter.   The decision about which sharding topology is best for your application should always be based on serious considerations about how much downtime you can toler- ate, as measured by your recovery time objective  RTO . Think about the potential failure scenarios and simulate them. Consider the consequences for your application  and business  if a datacenter should fail.  Now that you’ve settled on the topology of your cluster, it’s time to discuss the actual deployment and configuration.   Fortunately, configuration of a production cluster follows exactly the same steps that we took to configure our example cluster in section 12.4. Here, we’ll focus on the additional variables that must be considered in a production deployment.  ADDING NEW SHARDS Users frequently want to know how many shards to deploy and how large each shard should  be.  Naturally,  each  additional  shard  introduces  extra  complexity,  and  each shard also requires replicas. Thus it’s better to have a small number of large shards than  a  large  number  of  small  ones.  But  the  question  remains,  how  large  can  each shard be in practice?   The answer, of course, depends on the circumstances. In fact, the same concepts we discussed in section 12.1.2 for how to know when to shard in the first place apply here as well. Knowing when a single replica set—or, in this case, a shard—is at capacity is a matter of understanding the requirements of your application. Once you reach a point where your application requirements exceed the capacity of the shards you have or plan to have in your cluster, that’s when you need a new shard. As always, make sure you add enough shards before your cluster grinds to a halt, or MongoDB may not be able to rebalance your data quickly enough.  SHARDING AN EXISTING COLLECTION You can shard existing collections, but don’t be surprised if it takes some time to dis- tribute the data across shards. Only one balancing round can happen at a time, and the migrations will move only around 100–200 MB of data per minute. Thus, sharding a 50 GB collection will take around eight hours, and this will likely involve some mod- erate disk activity. In addition, when you initially shard a large collection like this, you may have to split manually to expedite the sharding process because splitting is trig- gered by inserts.   Given this, it should be clear that sharding a collection at the last minute isn’t a good  response  to  a  performance  problem.  If  you  plan  on  sharding  a  collection  at some point in the future, you should do so well in advance of any anticipated perfor- mance degradation.  www.it-ebooks.info   370  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  PRESPLITTING CHUNKS FOR INITIAL LOAD If you have a large data set that you need to load into a sharded collection, and you know something about the distribution of the data, then you can save a lot of time by presplitting  and  then  premigrating  chunks.  For  example,  suppose  you  wanted  to import the spreadsheet data into a fresh MongoDB shard cluster. You can ensure that the data distributes evenly upon import by first splitting and then migrating chunks across shards. You can use the  split and moveChunk commands to accomplish this. These are aliased by the  sh.splitAt    or  sh.splitFind    and  sh.moveChunks   helpers, respectively.   Here’s an example of a manual chunk split. You issue the split command, specify  the collection you want, and then indicate a split point:  > sh.splitAt  "cloud-docs.spreadsheets",   { "username" : "Chen", "_id" : ObjectId "4d6d59db1d41c8536f001453"  }   When run, this command will locate the chunk that logically contains the document where  username  is  Chen  and  _id  is  ObjectId "4d6d59db1d41c8536f001453" .13  It then  splits  the  chunk  at  that  point,  which  results  in  two  chunks.  You  can  continue splitting like this until you have a set of chunks that nicely distribute the data. You’ll want to make sure that you’ve created enough chunks to keep the average chunk size well within the 64 MB split threshold. If you expect to load 1 GB of data, you should plan to create around 20 chunks.    The  second  step  is  to  ensure  that  all  shards  have  roughly  the  same  number  of chunks. Because all chunks will initially reside on the same shard, you’ll need to move them. Each chunk can be moved using the moveChunk command. The helper method simplifies this:  > sh.moveChunk "cloud-docs.spreadsheets", {username: "Chen"}, "shardB"   This says that you want to move the chunk that logically would contain the document {username: "Chen"} to shard B.   12.7.3 Maintenance  We’ll  round  out  this  chapter  with  a  few  words  about  sharding  maintenance  and administration. Note that much of this can be done using MongoDB’s official moni- toring and automation tools, which we’ll discuss in chapter 13, but here we explore the fundamentals of what’s happening in the cluster, because that’s still important to know. The MongoDB automation uses a lot of these commands under the hood to implement its functionality.  13 Note that such a document need not exist. That should be clear from the fact that you’re splitting chunks on  an empty collection.  www.it-ebooks.info   Sharding in production  371  MONITORING A shard cluster is a complex piece of machinery, and you should monitor it closely. The serverStatus and currentOp   commands can be run on any mongos, and their output will reflect aggregate statistics across shards. We’ll discuss these commands in more detail in the next chapter.    In addition to aggregating server statistics, you’ll want to keep an eye on the distri- bution of chunks and on individual chunk sizes. As you saw in the sample cluster, all of this information is stored in the config database. If you ever detect unbalanced chunks or  unchecked  chunk  growth,  you  can  use  the  split  and  movechunk  commands  to address these issues. Alternatively, you can consult the logs to see whether the balanc- ing operation has halted for some reason. MANUAL PARTITIONING There are a couple of cases where you may want to manually split and migrate chunks on a live shard cluster. For example, as of MongoDB v2.6, the balancer doesn’t directly take into account the load on any one shard. Obviously, the more a shard is written to, the larger its chunks become, and the more likely they are to eventually migrate. Nev- ertheless, it’s not hard to imagine situations where you’d be able to alleviate load on a shard by migrating chunks. This is another situation where the movechunk command can be helpful. ADDING A SHARD If you’ve determined that you the need more capacity, you can add a new shard to an existing cluster using the same method you used earlier:  sh.addShard "shard-c rs1.example.net:27017,rs2.example.net:27017"   When adding capacity in this way, be realistic about how long it will take to migrate data to the new shard. As stated earlier, you can expect data to migrate at a rate of 100–200 MB per minute. This means that if you need to add capacity to a sharded clus- ter, you should do so long before performance starts to degrade. To determine when you need to add a new shard, consider the rate at which your data set is growing. Obvi- ously, you’ll want to keep indexes and working set in RAM. A good rule of thumb is to plan to add a new shard at least several weeks before the indexes and working set on your existing shards reach 90% of RAM.   If you’re not willing to play it safe, as described here, then you open yourself up to a world of pain. Once your indexes and working set don’t fit in RAM, your application can come to a halt, especially if the application demands high write and read through- put. The problem is that the database will have to page to and from the disk, which will slow reads and writes, backlogging operations that can’t be served into a read  write  queue.  At  that  point,  adding  capacity  is  difficult  because  migrating  chunks between shards adds read load to existing shards. Obviously, when a database is over- loaded, the last thing you want to do is add load.   All of this is to emphasize that you should monitor your cluster and add capacity  well before you need to.  www.it-ebooks.info   372  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  REMOVING A SHARD You may, in rare cases, want to remove a shard. You can do so using the removeshard command:  > use admin > db.runCommand {removeshard: "shard-1 localhost:30100,localhost:30101"}  {   "msg" : "draining started successfully",   "state" : "started",   "shard" : "shard-1-test-rs",   "ok" : 1 }  The command response indicates that chunks are now being drained from the shard to be relocated to other shards. You can check the status of the draining process by running the command again:  > db.runCommand {removeshard: "shard-1 localhost:30100,localhost:30101"}  {   "msg" : "draining ongoing",   "state" : "ongoing",   "remaining" : {     "chunks" : 376,     "dbs" : 3   },   "ok" : 1 }  Once  the  shard  is  drained,  you  also  need  to  make  sure  that  no  database’s  primary shard is the shard you’re going to remove. You can check database shard membership by querying the config.databases collection:  > use config > db.databases.find    { "_id" : "admin", "partitioned" : false, "primary" : "config" }  { "_id" : "cloud-docs", "partitioned" : true, "primary" : "shardA" }  { "_id" : "test", "partitioned" : false, "primary" : "shardB" }  Here the cloud-docs database is owned by shardB but the test database is owned by shardA. Because you’re removing shardB, you need to change the test database’s pri- mary node. You can accomplish that with the moveprimary command:  > db.runCommand {moveprimary: "test", to: "shard-0-test-rs" } ;  Run this command for each database whose primary is the shard to be removed. Then run the removeshard command again to verify that the shard is completely drained:  > db.runCommand {removeshard: "shard-1 localhost:30100,localhost:30101"}  { "msg": "remove shard completed successfully",   "stage": "completed",   "host": "localhost:30100",   "ok" : 1 }  Once you see that the removal is completed, it’s safe to take the removed shard offline.  www.it-ebooks.info   Sharding in production  373  UNSHARDING A COLLECTION Although you can remove a shard, there’s no official way to unshard a collection. If you do need to unshard a collection, your best option is to dump the collection and then restore the data to a new collection with a different name.14 You can then drop the sharded collection you dumped. For example, suppose that foo is a sharded col- lection. You must dump foo by connecting to mongos with mongodump:  $ mongodump -h localhost --port 40000 -d cloud-docs -c foo connected to: localhost:40000 DATABASE: cloud-docs   to   dump cloud-docs   cloud-docs.foo to dump cloud-docs foo.bson      100 objects  This will dump the collection to a file called foo.bson. You can then restore that file using mongorestore:  $ mongorestore -h localhost --port 40000 -d cloud-docs -c bar Tue Mar 22 12:06:12 dump cloud-docs foo.bson Tue Mar 22 12:06:12    going into namespace [cloud-docs.bar] Tue Mar 22 12:06:12    100 objects found  Once you’ve moved the data into an unsharded collection, you’re then free to drop the old sharded collection, foo. But when dropping collections, you should be extra careful because bad things can happen: first of all, make sure that you’re dropping the correct collection! BACKING UP A SHARDED CLUSTER As you’ll see in chapter 13, there are a few different options for backing up MongoDB. For the most part, these strategies also apply to backing up each shard in a sharded cluster.  But  there  are  two  additional  steps  that  must  be  taken  when  backing  up  a sharded cluster, regardless of which method you’re using to back up the shards:    Disable  chunk  migrations—The  first  thing  to  keep  in  mind  when  backing  up  a sharded  cluster  is  that  chunk  migrations  may  be  occurring.  This  means  that unless you backup everything at exactly the same instant in time, which is essen- tially impossible, you may end up missing some data. We’ll cover exactly how to disable chunk migrations in this section.    Config  server  metadata—When  backing  up  a  sharded  cluster,  the  config  server metadata must also be backed up. To do this, perform a backup of a single con- fig server node, because all config servers should have the same data. Like the backup of the shards, this should also be done after chunk migrations are dis- abled to avoid missing data.  Fortunately, there’s a built-in mechanism to disable automatic chunk migrations. All migration of data between shards is handled by something called the balancer process.  14 The utilities you use to dump and restore, mongodump and mongorestore, are covered in the next chapter.  www.it-ebooks.info   374  CHAPTER 12 Scaling your system with sharding  Once you stop this process, you’re guaranteed that no automatic migrations are hap- pening. You can still trigger migrations manually or create new databases, however, which would disrupt a proper backup, so be sure you have no other processes running that do administrative operations. STOPPING AND STARTING THE BALANCER To disable the balancer, use the sh.stopBalancer   shell helper:  > use config > sh.stopBalancer    Note  that  this  may  take  a  long  time  to  complete.  This  is  because  this  helper  only marks  the  balancer  as  disabled,  and  doesn’t  abort  existing  balancing  rounds.  This means it has to wait for in-progress balancing rounds to complete. Once it returns suc- cessfully, you can be sure that no chunk migrations are in progress. To start the bal- ancer again, you can use the sh.startBalancer   helper:  > use config > sh.startBalancer    You should consult the MongoDB docs for additional balancer configuration, which includes a setting to enable the balancer only in a specified time window. FAILOVER AND RECOVERY Although  we’ve  covered  general  replica  set  failures,  it’s  also  important  to  note  a sharded cluster’s potential points of failure along with best practices for recovery. FAILURE OF A SHARD MEMBER Each shard consists of a replica set. If any member of one of these replica sets fails, a secondary member will be elected primary, and the mongos process will automatically connect to it. Chapter 11 describes the specific steps to take in restoring a failed rep- lica set member. The method you choose depends on how the member has failed, but regardless, the instructions are the same whether  or  not  the  replica  set  is  part  of  a sharded cluster. FAILURE OF A CONFIG SERVER A sharded cluster requires three config servers for normal operation, but up to two of these  can  fail.  Whenever  you  have  fewer  than  three  config  servers,  your  remaining config servers will become read-only, and all splitting and balancing operations will be suspended.  Note  that  this  won’t  negatively  affect  the  cluster  as  a  whole.  Reads  and writes to the cluster will still work, and the balancer will start from where it left off once all three config servers are restored.   To restore a config server, copy the data files from an existing config server to the  failed config server’s machine. Then restart the server.15  15 As always, before you copy any data files, make sure you either lock the mongod  as described in chapter 11   or shut it down cleanly. Never copy data files while the server is live.  www.it-ebooks.info   Summary  375  FAILURE OF A MONGOS The failure of a mongos process is nothing to worry about. If you’re hosting mongos on an application server and mongos fails, it’s likely that your application server has failed, too. Recovery in this case simply means restoring the server.   Regardless of how mongos fails, the process has no state of its own. This means that recovering a mongos is a matter of restarting the mongos process and pointing it at the config servers.  12.8 Summary  Sharding is an effective strategy for maintaining high read-and write-performance on large data sets. MongoDB’s sharding works well in numerous production deployments and can work for you, too. Instead of having to worry about implementing your own half-baked, custom sharding solution, you can take advantage of all the effort that’s been put into MongoDB’s sharding mechanism. If you follow the advice in this chap- ter, paying particular attention to the recommended deployment topologies, the strat- egies  for  choosing  a  shard  key,  and  the  importance  of  keeping  data  in  RAM,  then sharding will serve you well.  www.it-ebooks.info   Deployment and administration  This chapter covers   Provisioning and hardware requirements   Monitoring and diagnostics   Backups and administrative tasks   Security   Performance troubleshooting   Deployment checklist  This book would be incomplete without a few notes on deployment and adminis- tration. After all, it’s one thing to use MongoDB but quite another to keep it run- ning smoothly in production. The goal of this final chapter is to prepare you to make good decisions when deploying and administering MongoDB. You can think of this chapter as providing the wisdom required to keep you from experiencing the unpleasantness of a production database meltdown.   We’ll start this chapter with MongoDB’s hardware requirements, as well as some options for deploying this hardware. Then, we’ll move into a few sections that dis- cuss  how  to  keep  your  system  running,  resilient,  and  secure.  Finally,  we’ll  end with a deployment checklist you can look back on to make sure you’ve covered all your bases.  376  www.it-ebooks.info   Hardware and provisioning  377  13.1 Hardware and provisioning  The  first  question  you  need  to  ask  before  you  deploy  MongoDB  is,  “What  I  should deploy it on?” If you ran an entire production cluster on a single laptop as we did ear- lier in this book, you’d be in big trouble. In this section, we’ll discuss how to choose the right topology for your requirements, how different hardware affects MongoDB, and what options are available for provisioning this hardware.  13.1.1 Cluster topology  This section gives you some basic recommendations on cluster topologies, but for a more complete analysis of different deployment topologies in replicated and sharded setups, you can consult chapters 11 and 12.   Figure 13.1 shows the minimum setup for the three different cluster types, as well  as when you’d want to upgrade to a different type of cluster.   In total, there are three different types of clusters in MongoDB:    Single node—As you can see at the top of figure 13.1, MongoDB can be run as a single server to support testing and staging environments. But for production deployments, a single server isn’t recommended, even if journaling is enabled. Having only one machine complicates backup and recovery, and when there’s a server failure, there’s nothing to fail over to. That said, if you don’t need reli- ability and have a small enough data set, this is always an option.    Replica set—As shown in the middle of figure 13.1, the minimum recommended deployment  topology  for  a  replica  set  is  three  nodes,  at  least  two  of  which should be data-storing nodes rather than arbiters. A replica set is necessary for automatic  failover,  easier  backups,  and  not  having  a  single  point  of  failure. Refer to chapter 10 for more details on replica sets.    Sharded  cluster—As  you  can  see  at  the  bottom  of  figure  13.1,  the  minimum recommended  deployment  for  a  sharded  cluster  has  two  shards  because deploying a sharded cluster with only one shard would add additional over- head  without  any  of  the  benefits  of  sharding.  Each  shard  should  also  be  a replica set and there should be three config servers to ensure that there’s no single point of failure. Note that there are also two mongos processes. Loss of all mongos processes doesn’t lead to any data loss, but it does lead to down- time,  so  we  have  two  here  as  part of  the  minimum  production  topology  to ensure high availability. A sharded cluster is necessary when you want to scale up the capacity of your cluster by pooling together the capacity of a number of less powerful commodity servers. Refer to chapter 12 for more details on sharded clusters.  Now that you have a high-level understanding of the types of clusters that are available, let’s go into more specific details about the deployment of each individual server.  www.it-ebooks.info   378  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  Single node  Increased performance  mongod  mongos  C  Config server  Application  Replica set  Increased performance  C  C  C  Shared cluster  Figure 13.1 The minimum single node, replica set, and sharded cluster setups, as  well as their purpose  13.1.2 Deployment environment  Here  we’ll  present  considerations  for  choosing  good  deployment  environments  for MongoDB. We’ll discuss specific hardware requirements, such as CPU, RAM, and disks, and provide recommendations for optimizing the operating system environment. Fig- ure  13.2  is  a  simplified  visualization  of  the  hardware  and  operating  system  compo- nents  that  MongoDB  needs  to  interact  with  that  we’ll  cover  in  this  section.

ARCHITECTURE Two notes on hardware architecture are in order. First, because MongoDB maps all data files to a virtual address space, all production deployments should be run on 64-bit machines. A 32-bit architecture limits MongoDB to about 2 GB of storage. With jour- naling enabled, the limit is reduced at around 1.5 GB. This is dangerous in production because if these limits are ever surpassed, MongoDB will behave unpredictably.1 Feel free to run on 32-bit machines for unit testing and staging, but in production and for load testing, stick to 64-bit architectures.   Next, the components that ship with the MongoDB servers must be run on little- endian machines.2 This usually isn’t difficult to comply with since the x86 architec- ture, which you’re likely using if you’re not sure, is little endian, but users running SPARC, PowerPC,  PA-RISC, and other big-endian architectures will have to hold off.3 The  client  drivers,  though,  are  maintained  as  separate  projects,  and  they’re  usually built  to  support  both  little-  and  big-endian  byte  orderings.  This  means  that  even  1 In this case “unpredictably” means that the behavior is completely undefined. This essentially means that MongoDB “might” simply crash, or it might make demons fly out of your nose. We just don’t know. The main point here is that you should avoid this scenario because even the maintainers of MongoDB can’t help you. 2 The “endianness” of a machine is a hardware detail referring to the order in which bytes are stored in mem-  ory. See https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Endianness for more information.  3 If you’re interested in big-endian support for the core server, see https:  jira.mongodb.org browse SERVER-  1625.  www.it-ebooks.info   380  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  though the server must run on little endian machines, clients of MongoDB can usually run on either architecture.  CPU MongoDB isn’t particularly CPU-intensive; database operations are rarely CPU-bound, so this isn’t the first place to look when diagnosing a performance issue. Your first pri- ority when optimizing for MongoDB is to ensure operations aren’t I O-bound  we’ll discuss I O-bound issues more in the next two sections on RAM and disks .   But once your indexes and working set fit entirely in RAM, you may see some CPU- boundedness. If you have a single MongoDB instance serving tens  or hundreds  of thousands of queries per second, you can realize performance increases by providing more CPU cores.   If you do happen to see CPU saturation, check your logs for slow query warnings. There may be some types of queries that are inherently more CPU-intensive, or you may have an index issue that the logs will help you diagnose. But if that’s not the case and you’re still seeing CPU saturation, it’s likely due to lock contention, which we’ll briefly touch on here.  RAM As with any database, MongoDB performs best with sufficient RAM. Be sure to select hardware with enough RAM to contain your frequently used indexes, plus your work- ing data set. Then as your data grows, keep a close eye on the ratio of RAM-to–working set size. If you allow working set size to grow beyond RAM, you may start to see signifi- cant performance degradation. Paging from disk in and of itself isn’t a problem—it’s a  necessary  step  in  loading  data  into  memory.  But  if  you’re  unhappy  with  perfor- mance, excessive paging may be your problem.  Chapter 8 discusses the relationship between working set, index size, and RAM in great detail.  By the end of this chapter, you should have enough tools in your arsenal to diagnose RAM deficiencies.   There are a few use cases where you can safely let data size grow well beyond avail- able RAM, but they’re the exception, not the rule. One example is using MongoDB as an archive, where reads and writes seldom happen and you don’t need fast responses. Because RAM is essentially a cache for pages on disk, it only provides a performance boost if a page will be used more than once in a short period of time. In the case of an archive application, this may not be the case, and the page will need to be loaded into memory from disk the first  and possibly only  time it’s used anyway. On top of that, having as much RAM as data for this type of application might be prohibitively expen- sive. For all data sets, the key is testing. Test a representative prototype of your applica- tion to ensure that you get the necessary baseline performance.  DISKS When choosing disks, you need to consider cost, IOPS  input output operations per second , seek time, and storage capacity. The differences between running on a single consumer-grade hard drive, running in the cloud in a virtual disk  say, EBS , and run- ning against a high-performance SAN can’t be overemphasized. Some applications will  www.it-ebooks.info   Hardware and provisioning  381  perform  acceptably  against  a  single  network-attached  EBS  volume,  but  demanding applications will require something more.   Disk performance is important for a few reasons:    High write workloads—As you’re writing to MongoDB, the server must flush the data back to disk. With a write-intensive app and a slow disk, the flushing may be slow enough to negatively affect overall system performance.     A fast disk allows a quicker server warm-up—Any time you need to restart a server, you also have to load your data set into RAM. This happens lazily; each succes- sive read or write to MongoDB will load a new virtual memory page into RAM until the physical memory is full. A fast disk will make this process much faster, which will increase MongoDB’s performance following a cold restart.     A  fast  disk  alters  the  required  ratio  of  working  set  size  to  RAM  for  your  application— Using, say, a solid-state drive, you may be able to run with much less RAM  or much greater capacity  than you would otherwise.  Regardless of the type of disk used, serious deployments will generally use, not a single disk,  but  a  redundant  array  of  disks   RAID   instead.  Users  typically  manage  a  RAID cluster using Linux’s logical volume manager, LVM, with a RAID level of 10. RAID 10 provides redundancy while maintaining acceptable performance, and it’s commonly used in MongoDB deployments.4 Note that this is more expensive than a single disk, which  illustrates  the  tradeoff  between  cost  and  performance.  Even  more  advanced deployments will use a high-performance self-managed SAN, where the disks are all virtual and the idea of RAID may not even apply.   If your data is spread across multiple databases within the same MongoDB server, then you can also ensure capacity by using the server’s --directoryperdb flag. This will create a separate directory in the data file path for each database. Using this, you can conceivably mount a separate volume  RAID’ed or not  for each database. This may  allow  you  to  take  advantage  of  some  performance  increases,  because  you’ll  be able to read from separate sets of spindles  or solid-state drives . LOCKS MongoDB’s locking model is a topic unto itself. We won’t discuss all the nuances of concurrency  and  performance  in  MongoDB  here,  but  we’ll  cover  the  basic  concur- rency models MongoDB supports. In practice, ensuring that you don’t have lock con- tention will require careful monitoring or benchmarking because every workload is different and may have completely different points of contention.   In the early days, MongoDB took a global lock on the entire server. This was soon updated to a global lock on each database and support was added to release the lock before disk operations.   As of v3.0 MongoDB now supports two separate storage engines with different con- currency models. It has collection-level locking in its own native mmap-based storage  4 For an overview of RAID levels, see http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Standard_RAID_levels.  www.it-ebooks.info   382  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  engine, and document-level locking in the newly supported WiredTiger storage engine, which can be used instead of the native storage engine. Consult JIRA, MongoDB’s bug- tracking system, as well as the latest release notes for the status of these improvements.5 FILESYSTEMS You’ll get the best performance from MongoDB if you run it on the right filesystem. Two in particular, ext4 and xfs, feature fast, contiguous disk allocation. Using these filesystems will speed up MongoDB’s frequent preallocations.6   Once you mount your fast filesystem, you can achieve another performance gain by disabling updates to files’ last access time:  atime. Normally, the operating system will update a file’s atime every time the file is read or written. In a database environment, this amounts to a lot of unnecessary work. Disabling atime on Linux is relatively easy:  1 First, make a backup of the filesystem config file:   sudo cp  etc fstab  etc fstab.bak  2 Open the original file in your favorite editor:  sudo vim  etc fstab  3 For each mounted volume you’ll find inside  etc fstab, you’ll see a list of set- tings aligned by column. Under the options column, add the noatime directive:   file-system       mount  type    options  dump  pass UUID=8309beda-bf62-43   ssd   ext4    noatime  0     2  4 Save your work. The new settings should take effect immediately.7  You can see the list of all mounted filesystems with the help of the findmnt command, which exists on Linux machines:  $ findmnt -s TARGET SOURCE    FSTYPE OPTIONS  proc  proc      proc   defaults         dev xvda ext3   noatime,errors=remount-ro none    dev xvdb swap   sw  The –s option makes findmnt get its data from the  etc fstab file. Running findmnt without any command-line parameters shows more details yet more busy output. FILE DESCRIPTORS Some Linux systems cap the number of allowable open file descriptors at 1024. This is occasionally too low for MongoDB and may result in warning messages or even errors  5 Release  notes  can  be  found  at  https:  jira.mongodb.org browse server  and  https:  docs.mongodb.org   6 For  more  detailed  filesystem  recommendations,  see  https:  docs.mongodb.org manual administration   7 Note that these are basic recommendations and by no means comprehensive. See https:  en.wikipedia.org   manual release-notes  for more information.  production-notes kernel-and-file-systems.   wiki Fstab for an overview of mount options.  www.it-ebooks.info   Hardware and provisioning  383  when opening connections  which you’ll see clearly in the logs . Naturally, MongoDB requires a file descriptor for each open file and network connection.   Assuming you store your data files in a folder with the word “data” in it, you can see  the number of data file descriptors using lsof and a few well-placed pipes:  lsof  grep mongo  grep data  wc -l  Counting the number of network connection descriptors is just as easy:  lsof  grep mongo  grep TCP  wc -l  When it comes to file descriptors, the best strategy is to start with a high limit so that you never run out in production. You can check the current limit temporarily with the ulimit command:  ulimit -Hn  To raise the limit permanently, open your limits.conf file with your editor of choice:  sudo vim  etc security limits.conf  Then set the soft and hard limits. These are specified on a per-user basis. This exam- ple assumes that the mongodb user will run the mongod process:  mongodb soft nofile 2048 mongodb hard nofile 10240  The new settings will take effect when that user logs in again.8 CLOCKS It turns out that replication is susceptible to “clock skew,” which can occur if the clocks on the machines hosting the various nodes of a replica set get out of sync. Replication depends heavily on time comparisons, so if different machines in the same replica set disagree on the current time, that can cause serious problems. This isn’t ideal, but for- tunately  there’s  a  solution.  You  need  to  ensure  that  each  of  your  servers  uses  NTP  Network  Time  Protocol 9  or  some  other  synchronization  protocol  to  keep  their clocks synchronized:     On Unix variants, this means running the ntpd daemon.    On Windows, the Windows Time Services fulfills this role.   JOURNALING MongoDB v1.8 introduced journaling, and since v2.0 MongoDB enables journaling by default.  When  journaling  is  enabled,  MongoDB  will  commit  all  writes  to  a  journal  8 This may not apply if the user is purely a daemon. In that case restarting the mongodb service using something  like sudo service mongodb restart should do the trick.  9 Make sure to verify that NTP is working correctly using diagnostic commands such as ntpstat.  www.it-ebooks.info   384  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  before writing to the core data files. This allows the MongoDB server to come back online quickly and cleanly in the event of an unclean shutdown.    In the event of an unclean shutdown of a nonjournaled mongod process, restoring the  data  files  to  a  consistent  state  requires  running  a  repair.  The  repair  process rewrites  the  data  files,  discarding  anything  it  can’t  understand   corrupted  data . Because downtime and data loss are generally frowned upon, repairing in this way is usually part of a last-ditch recovery effort. Resyncing from an existing replica is almost always easier and more reliable. Being able to recover in this way is one of the reasons why it’s so important to run with replication.   Journaling obviates the need for database repairs because MongoDB can use the journal to restore the data files to a consistent state. In MongoDB v2.0 as well as v3.0, journaling is enabled by default, but you can disable it with the --nojournal flag:  $ mongod --nojournal  When enabled, the journal files will be kept in a directory called journal, located just below the main data path.   If you run your MongoDB server with journaling enabled, keep a of couple points  in mind:    First, journaling adds some additional overhead to writes.    One way to mitigate this is to allocate a separate disk for the journal, and then either  create  a  symlink10  between  the  journal  directory  and  the  auxiliary  vol- ume or simply mount this disk where the journal directory should be. The aux- iliary  volume  needn’t  be  large;  a  120  GB  disk  is  more  than  sufficient,  and  a solid-state drive  SSD  of this size is affordable. Mounting a separate SSD for the journal files will ensure that journaling runs with the smallest possible per- formance penalty.    Second, journaling by itself doesn’t guarantee that no write will be lost. It guar- antees only that MongoDB will always come back online in a consistent state. Journaling works by syncing a write buffer to disk every 100 ms, so an unclean shutdown can result in the loss of up to the last 100 ms of writes. If this isn’t acceptable for any part of your application, you can change the write concern of operations through any client driver. You’d run this as a safe mode option  just like w and wtimeout . For example, in the Ruby driver, you might use the j option like this in order to have safe mode enabled all the time for one of the servers:  client = Mongo::Client.new  ['127.0.0.1:27017'], :write => {:j =>  true}, :database => 'garden'   10 A symlink, or symbolic link, is essentially an object that looks like a file but is actually a reference to another location. Using this here means that MongoDB can still find the journal directory in the same place despite the fact that it’s on a completely different disk. See https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Symbolic_link for more details.  www.it-ebooks.info   13.1.3 Provisioning  Hardware and provisioning  385  Be aware that running this after every write is unwise because it forces every write to wait for the next journal sync.11 Even then, these writes are subject to rollbacks in a replicated  setup  because  journal  acknowledged  writes  only  wait  until  the  primary writes to its journal and doesn’t wait for replication to secondaries. Therefore, a more commonly used way to ensure your writes are durable is to use the “majority” write concern option. This ensures that the write reaches a majority of the replica set, which is usually sufficient and resilient to failures. See chapter 10 for more details on replica- tion and write concern options.12  You  can  certainly  deploy  on  your  own  hardware,  and  that  approach  does  have  its advantages, but this section will focus mostly on cloud deployments and automation. In-house deployments require a lot of specialized administration and setup that’s out- side the scope of this book. THE CLOUD More and more users are running MongoDB in hosted, virtualized environments, col- lectively known as the cloud. Among these, Amazon’s EC2 has become a deployment environment  of  choice  because  of  its  ease  of  use,  wide  geographic  availability,  and competitive pricing. EC2, and other environments like it, can be adequate for deploy- ing  MongoDB. At a high level, there are three  main components to consider when thinking about deploying on any cloud provider:    The hosts themselves, which will actually run MongoDB   The persistent storage system, which will store MongoDB’s data files   The network that MongoDB will use to communicate internally and with clients  First, EC2 hosts are convenient, because they’re easy to provision and can be allocated as you need them, so the cost will scale with your needs. But one disadvantage of an EC2  host  is  that  it’s  essentially  a  black  box.  You  may  experience  service  blips  or instance slowdowns and have no way of diagnosing or remedying them. Sometimes you  might  get  a  “bad  box,”  which  means  your  virtual  instance  got  allocated  on  a machine with slow hardware or several other active users.13   Second, EC2 allows you to mount virtual block devices known as EBS volumes as your persistent storage. EBS volumes provide a great deal of flexibility, allowing you to add storage and move volumes across machines as needed. EBS also lets you take snap- shots, which you can use for backups.  11 Recent versions of MongoDB allow changing the journal commit interval to reduce the latency on journal-  acknowledged writes, using the commitIntervalMs option.  12 For more details on the behavior of specific write concern levels, see https:  docs.mongodb.org manual   core write-concern.  13 Note that EC2 has many different instance types and purchasing options that may suffer more or less from these problems. Check with EC2 or your cloud provider to find out exactly how they provision your machine.  www.it-ebooks.info   386  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration   The problem with the cheapest EBS volumes is that they may not provide a high level of throughput compared to what’s possible with physical disks. Be sure to check with your hosting provider to learn what their current offerings are. As of this writing, EBS  volumes  can  be  SSD-backed,  and  Amazon  also  provides  an  option  to  use  disks local to the node. On top of that, another way to increase performance is to run what- ever disks you’re using with a RAID 10 for increased read throughput.   Finally, EC2’s network is sufficient for most users, but like the storage and the hosts themselves, you give up a great deal of control by using EC2’s network rather than one you set up yourself. You’re sharing the same network with many others, so high traffic from other applications have the potential to affect your network performance. Like disks and instance types, this is “pay to play” when dealing with a hosting provider, so you may be able to pay more to mitigate these problems.    In summary, deploying on EC2 has many advantages, but it clearly has some nota- ble drawbacks. For these reasons, rather than dealing with some of EC2’s limitations and unpredictability, many users prefer to run MongoDB on their own physical hard- ware. Then again, EC2 and the cloud in general are convenient and perfectly accept- able for a wide variety of users. In the end, the best way to approach deploying in any environment  is  careful  testing.  Benchmarking  the  cloud  platform  that  you  want  to deploy on will ultimately help you make the decision more than anything else. MMS AUTOMATION Another provisioning option that is relatively new is the MongoDB Management Sys- tem  MMS  Automation. MMS Automation can provision instances from EC2 and setup of your entire cluster with the press of a button.14 The MMS team at MongoDB is con- stantly adding new features to simplify MongoDB operations, so if you’re interested in using this, refer to the current documentation at https:  docs.mms.mongodb.com to find out what’s available.  13.2 Monitoring and diagnostics  Once you’ve deployed MongoDB in production, you’ll want to keep an eye on it. If performance is slowly degrading, or if failures are occurring frequently, you’ll want to be apprised of these. That’s where monitoring comes in.    Let’s start with the simplest kind of monitoring: logging. Then we’ll explore the built-in commands that provide the most information about the running MongoDB server; these commands underlie the mongostat utility and the web console, both of which we’ll describe in brief.    Then we’ll look at the MMS Monitoring provided by the MongoDB company. We’ll make a couple of recommendations on external monitoring tools and end the section by presenting two diagnostic utilities: bsondump and mongosniff.  14 MMS Automation can also deploy MongoDB onto preprovisioned hardware if you’re not using EC2.  www.it-ebooks.info   13.2.1 Logging  Monitoring and diagnostics  387  Logging is the first level of monitoring; as such, you should plan on keeping logs for all your deployments. This usually isn’t a problem because MongoDB requires that you specify the --logpath option when running it in the background. But there are a few extra settings to be aware of. To enable verbose logging, start the mongod process with the -vvvvv option  the more vs, the more verbose the output . This is handy if, for instance, you need to debug some code and want to log every query. But do be aware that  verbose  logging  will  make  your  logs  quite  large  and  may  affect  server  perfor- mance. If your logs become too unwieldy, remember that you can always store your logs on a different partition.   Next you can start  mongod with the  --logappend option. This will append to an existing log rather than moving it and appending a timestamp to the filename, which is the default behavior.    Finally,  if  you  have  a  long-running  MongoDB  process,  you  may  want  to  write  a script that periodically rotates the log files. MongoDB provides the  logrotate com- mand for this purpose. Here’s how to run it from the shell:  > use admin > db.runCommand {logrotate: 1}   Sending  the  SIGUSR115  signal  to  the  process  also  runs  the  logrotate  command. Here’s how to send that signal to process number 12345:   $ kill -SIGUSR1 12345  $ ps –ef  grep mongo  You can find the process ID of the process you want to send the signal to using the ps command, like this:  Note that the kill command isn’t always as dire as it sounds. It only sends a signal to a running process, but was named in the days when most or all signals ended the pro- cess.16 But running kill with the -9 command-line option will end a process in a bru- tal way and should be avoided as much as possible on production systems.  13.2.2 MongoDB diagnostic commands  MongoDB has a number of database commands used to report internal state. These underlie all MongoDB monitoring applications. Here’s a quick reference for a few of the commands that you might find useful:    Global server statistics: db.serverStatus     Stats for currently running operation: db.currentOp    15 Unix-like systems support sending “signals” to running processes, which can trigger certain actions if the pro- cess that receives the signal is written to handle it. MongoDB is configured to handle receiving the SIGUSR1 signal and rotates the logs when it receives it.  16 There’s no Windows equivalent for this, so you’ll have to rely on the logrotate command in that case.  www.it-ebooks.info   388  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration     Include stats for idle system operations: db.currentOp true     Per database counters and activity stats: db.runCommand {top:1}    Memory and disk usage statistics: db.stats    The output for all of these commands improves with each MongoDB release, so docu- menting it in a semi-permanent medium like this book isn’t always helpful. Consult the documentation for your version of MongoDB to find out what each field in the output means.  13.2.3 MongoDB diagnostic tools  In addition to the diagnostic commands listed previously, MongoDB ships with a few handy diagnostic tools. Most of these are built on the previous commands and could be easily implemented using a driver or the mongo shell.   Here’s a quick introduction to what we’ll cover in this section:   mongostat—Global system statistics   mongotop—Global operation statistics   mongosniff  advanced —Dump MongoDB network traffic   bsondump—Display BSON files as JSON  MONGOSTAT The  db.currentOp   method shows only the operations queued or in progress at a particular moment in time. Similarly, the serverStatus command provides a point-in- time snapshot of various system fields and counters. But sometimes you need a view of the  system’s  real-time  activity,  and  that’s  where  mongostat  comes  in.  Modeled  after iostat and other similar tools, mongostat polls the server at a fixed interval and dis- plays an array of statistics, from the number of inserts per second to the amount of res- ident memory, to the frequency of B-tree page misses.   You can invoke the mongostat command on localhost, and the polling will occur  once a second:  $ mongostat  It’s also highly configurable, and you can start it with --help to see all the options. For example, you can use the  –-host option to connect to a host and port besides the default  of  localhost:27017.  One  of  the  more  notable  features  is  cluster  discovery; when you start mongostat with the --discover option, you can use the --host option to point it to a single node, and it’ll discover the remaining nodes in a replica set or sharded cluster. It then displays the entire cluster’s statistics in aggregate.  MONGOTOP Similar to the way mongostat is the external tool for the db.currentOp   and server- Status commands, mongotop is the external tool for the top command. You can run this in exactly the same way as mongostat, assuming you have a server running on the local machine and listening on the default port:  $ mongotop  www.it-ebooks.info   Monitoring and diagnostics  389  As with mongostat, you can run this command with –help to see a number of useful configuration options.  MONGOSNIFF The next command we’ll cover is mongosniff, which sniffs packets from a client to the MongoDB server and prints them intelligibly. If you happen to be writing a driver or debugging an errant connection, then this is your tool. You can start it up like this to listen on the local network interface at the default port:  sudo mongosniff --source NET I0  Then when you connect with any client—say, the MongoDB shell—you’ll get an easy- to-read stream of network chatter:  127.0.0.1:58022  -->> 127.0.0.1:27017 test.$cmd 61 bytes id:89ac9c1d   2309790749 query: { isMaster: 1.0 }  ntoreturn: -1 127.0.0.1:27017  <<--  127.0.0.1:58022   87 bytes reply n:1 cursorId: 0 { ismaster: true, ok: 1.0 }  Here you can see a client running the isMaster command, which is represented as a query for { isMaster: 1.0 } against the special test.$cmd collection. You can also see that the response document contains ismaster: true, indicating that the node that this  command  was  sent  to  was  in  fact  the  primary.  You  can  see  all  the  mongosniff options by running it with --help.  BSONDUMP Another useful command is bsondump, which allows you to examine raw BSON files. BSON files are generated by the mongodump command  discussed in section 13.3  and by replica set rollbacks.17 For instance, let’s say you’ve dumped a collection with a sin- gle document. If that collection ends up in a file called users.bson, then can examine the contents easily:  $ bsondump users.bson { "_id" : ObjectId  "4d82836dc3efdb9915012b91"  , "name" : "Kyle" }  As you can see, bsondump prints the BSON as JSON by default. If you’re doing serious debugging, you’ll want to see the real composition of BSON types and sizes. For that, run the command in debug mode:  $ bsondump --type=debug users.bson --- new object --- size : 37 _id type:  7 size: 17 name type:  2 size: 15  17 MongoDB writes replica set rollback files to the rollback directory inside the data directory.  www.it-ebooks.info   390  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  This gives you the total size of the object  37 bytes , the types of the two fields  7 and 2 , and those fields’ sizes.   THE WEB CONSOLE Finally,  MongoDB  provides  some  access  to  statistics  via  a  web  interface  and  a  REST server. As of v3.0, these systems are old and under active development. On top of that, they report the same information available via the other tools or database commands presented earlier. If you want to use these systems, be sure to look at the current docu- mentation and carefully consider the security implications.  13.2.4 MongoDB Monitoring Service  MongoDB, Inc. provides MMS Monitoring for free, which not only allows you to view dashboards to help you understand your system, but also provides an easy way to share your  system  information  with  MongoDB  support,  which  is  indispensable  if  you  ever need help with your system. MMS Monitoring can also be licensed as a self-hosted ver- sion for large enterprises with paid contracts. To get started, all you need to do is cre- ate an account on the MMS Monitoring website at https:  mms.mongodb.com. Once you create an account, you’ll see instructions to walk you through the process of set- ting up MMS, which we won’t cover here.  13.2.5 External monitoring applications  Most serious deployments will require an external monitoring application. Nagios and Munin are two popular open source monitoring systems used to keep an eye on many MongoDB deployments. You can use each of these with MongoDB by installing a sim- ple open source plug-in.   Writing a plug-in for any arbitrary monitoring application isn’t difficult. It mostly involves running various statistics commands against a live MongoDB database. The serverStatus,  dbstats,  and  collstats  commands  usually  provide  all  the  informa- tion you might need, and you can get all of them straight from the HTTP REST inter- face, avoiding the need for a driver.   Finally, don’t forget the wealth of tools available for low-level system monitoring. For example, the  iostat command can be helpful in diagnosing MongoDB perfor- mance issues. Most of the performance issues in MongoDB deployments can be traced to a single source: the hard disk.     In  the  following  example,  we  use  the  -x  option  to  show  extended  statistics  and  specify 2 to display those stats at two-second intervals:  $ iostat -x 2 Device:  rsec s   wsec s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await  svctm  %util sdb       0.00   3101.12    10.09    32.83  101.39   1.34  29.36 Device:  rsec s   wsec s avgrq-sz avgqu-sz   await  svctm  %util sdb       0.00   2933.93     9.87    23.72  125.23   1.47  34.13  www.it-ebooks.info   Backups  391  For a detailed description of each of these fields, or for details on your specific version of iostat, consult your system’s man18 pages. For a quick diagnostic, you’ll be most interested in two of the columns shown:     The  await column indicates the average time in milliseconds for serving  I O requests.  This  average  includes  time  spent  in  the  I O  queue  and  time  spent actually servicing I O requests.    %util is the percentage of CPU during which I O requests were issued to the  device, which essentially translates to the bandwidth use of the device.  The preceding iostat snippet shows moderate disk usage. The average time waiting on I O is around 100 ms  hint: that’s a lot! , and the utilization is about 30%. If you were to investigate the MongoDB logs on this machine, you’d likely see numerous slow operations   queries,  inserts,  or  otherwise .  In  fact,  it’s  those  slow  operations  that would initially alert you to a potential problem. The iostat output can help you con- firm the problem. We’ve covered a lot of ways to diagnose and monitor a running sys- tem  to  keep  it  running  smoothly,  but  now  let’s  get  into  an  unavoidable  aspect  of  a production deployment: backups.  13.3 Backups  Part  of  running  a  production  database  deployment  is  being  prepared  for  disasters. Backups play an important role in this. When disaster strikes, a good backup can save the day, and in these cases, you’ll never regret having invested time and diligence in a regular backup policy. Yet some users still decide that they can live without backups. These users have only themselves to blame when they can’t recover their databases. Don’t be one of these users.   Three general strategies for backing up a MongoDB database are as follows:     Using mongodump and mongorestore    Copying the raw data files   Using MMS Backups  We’ll go over each of these strategies in the next three sections.  13.3.1 mongodump and mongorestore  mongodump writes the contents of a database as BSON files. mongorestore reads these files and restores them. These tools are useful for backing up individual collections and databases as well as the whole server. They can be run against a live server  you don’t have to lock or shut down the server , or you can point them to a set of data files,  18 The man pages, or “manual” pages, are the way many programs on Unix-based systems provide documenta-  tion. For example, type man iostat in a terminal to get the iostat man page.  www.it-ebooks.info   392  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  but only when the server is locked or shut down. The simplest way to run mongodump is like this:19  $ mongodump -h localhost --port 27017  This will dump each database and collection from the server at localhost to a direc- tory called dump.20 The dump directory will include all the documents from each collec- tion, including the system collections that define users and indexes. But significantly, the  indexes  themselves  won’t  be  included  in  the  dump.  This  means  that  when  you restore, any indexes will have to be rebuilt. If you have an especially large data set, or a large number of indexes, this will take time. RESTORING BSON FILES To restore BSON files, run mongorestore and point it at the dump folder:  $ mongorestore -h localhost --port 27017 dump  Note that when restoring, mongorestore won’t drop data by default, so if you’re restor- ing to an existing database, be sure to run with the --drop flag.  13.3.2 Data file–based backups  Most users opt for a file-based backup, where the raw data files are copied to a new location. This approach is often faster than mongodump because the backups and resto- rations require no transformation of the data.    The only potential problem with a file-based backup is that it requires locking the database, but generally you’ll lock a secondary node and thus should be able to keep your application online for the duration of the backup. COPYING THE DATA FILES Users frequently make the mistake of copying the data files without first locking the database. Even if journaling is enabled, doing so will result in corruption of the cop- ied files. This section will cover how to bring the data files to a consistent state by lock- ing the database to allow for safe backups.  Snapshotting a live system You may wonder why you have to lock the data files even when journaling is enabled. The answer is that journaling is only able to restore a database to a consistent state from a single point in time. If you’re manually copying the data files, there may be some delay between copying each file, which means different data files may be from different points in time, and journaling can’t deal with this.  19 If you have secondary reads enabled, you can run this against the secondary of a replica set rather than the  20 If possible, this directory should be stored on a separate disk, both for performance and for extra defense  primary.  against disk failure.  www.it-ebooks.info   Backups  393  But if your filesystem, storage provider, or hosting provider explicitly supports “point- in-time” snapshots, you can use this feature to safely snapshot a live system without locking the data files. Note that everything has to be saved at exactly the same time, including the journal. This means that if your journal is on a separate disk  or you have journaling disabled , you’re out of luck unless you have a system that supports point- in-time snapshots across multiple volumes.  To safely copy the data files, you first need to make sure that they’re in a consistent state, so you either have to shut down the database or lock it. Because shutting down the database might be too involved for some deployments, most users opt for the lock- ing approach. Here’s the command for syncing and locking:  > use admin > db.fsyncLock    At this point, the database is locked against writes21 and the data files are synced to disk. This means that it’s now safe to copy the data files. If you’re running on a filesys- tem or storage system that supports snapshots, it’s best to take a snapshot and copy later. This allows you to unlock quickly.   If you can’t run a snapshot, you’ll have to keep the database locked while you copy the  data  files.  If  you’re  copying  data  files  from  a  secondary  node,  be  sure  that  the node is current with the primary and has enough oplog to remain offline for the dura- tion of the backup.   Once you’ve finished making a snapshot or backing up, you can unlock the data-  base. The somewhat arcane unlock command can be issued like this:  > db.fsyncUnlock    Note that this is merely a request to unlock; the database may not unlock right away. Run the db.currentOp   method to verify that the database is no longer locked.   13.3.3 MMS backups  Once again, the MMS team at MongoDB has a solution for this problem. MMS Backups use the replication oplog to provide point-in-time backups for your entire cluster. This works for stand-alone replica sets as well as for entire sharded cluster. As we mentioned earlier, the MMS team is constantly adding new features, so check the up-to-date docu- mentation for details.  21 Any attempts to write will block behind this lock, and reads that come after those writes will also block. This unfortunately includes reads of authentication data, meaning that new connection attempts will also block on this lock when you’re running with authentication, so keep your connections open when you’re running the backup process. See https:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference method db.fsyncLock  for more details.  www.it-ebooks.info   394  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  13.4 Security  Security is an extremely important, and often overlooked, aspect of deploying a pro- duction  database.  In  this  section,  we’ll  cover  the  main  types  of  security,  including secure environments, network encryption, authentication, and authorization.    We’ll end with a brief discussion of which security features are only available in the enterprise edition of MongoDB. Perhaps more than for any other topic, it’s vital to stay up to date with the current security tools and best practices, so treat this section as an overview  of  what  to  consider  when  thinking  about  security,  but  consult  the  most recent documentation at https:  docs.mongodb.org manual security when putting it into production.  13.4.1 Secure environments  MongoDB, like all databases, should be run in a secure environment. Production users of  MongoDB  must  take  advantage  of  the  security  features  of  modern  operating  sys- tems to ensure the safety of their data. Probably the most important of these features is the firewall.    The only potential difficulty in using a firewall with MongoDB is knowing which machines  need  to  communicate  with  each  other.  Fortunately,  the  communication rules are simple:    With a replica set, each node must be able to reach every other node.   All database clients must be able to connect with every replica set node that the  client might conceivably talk to.    All communication is done using the TCP protocol.   For a node to be reachable, it means that it’s reachable on the port that it was configured  to  listen  on.  For  example,  mongod  listens  on  TCP  port  27017  by default, so to be reachable it must be reachable on that port.  A shard cluster consists in part of replica sets. All the replica set rules apply; the client in the case of sharding is the mongos router. Additionally:    All shards must be able to communicate directly with one another.   Both the shards and the mongos routers must be able to talk to the config servers.  Figure 13.2 shows a simplified visualization of these connectivity rules, with the one addition that any arrow connecting to a boxed replica set or set of config servers means that the connectivity requirement applies to every individual server inside the box.   For the most part, running MongoDB in a secure environment is completely exter- nal to MongoDB and is a full topic on its own. But one option, --bind_ip, is relevant here.22 By default, MongoDB will listen on all addresses on the machine, B=but you may want MongoDB to listen on one or more specific addresses instead. For this you  22 Note that as of v2.6, the prebuilt packages for Linux include --bind_ip by default.  www.it-ebooks.info   13.4.2 Network encryption  Security  395  can start mongod and mongos with the --bind_ip option, which takes a list of one or more comma-separated IP addresses. For example, to listen on the loopback interface as well as on the internal IP address 10.4.1.55, you’d start mongod like this:  mongod --bind_ip 127.0.0.1,10.4.1.55  Note  that  data  between  machines  will  be  sent  in  the  clear  unless  you  have  SSL enabled, which we’ll cover in the next section.  Perhaps the most fundamental aspect of securing your system is ensuring your net- work traffic is encrypted. Unless your system is completely isolated and no one you don’t  trust  can  even  see  your  traffic   for  example,  if  all  your  traffic  is  already encrypted over a virtual private network, or your network routing rules are set up such that no traffic can be sent to your machines from outside your trusted network23 , you should  probably  use  MongoDB  with  encryption.  Fortunately,  as  of  v2.4,  MongoDB ships  with  a  library  that  handles  this  encryption—called  the  Secure  Sockets  Layer  SSL —built in.   To see why this is important, let’s play the role of an eavesdropper using the Unix command tcpdump. First, use the ifconfig command to find the name of the loop- back interface, or the interface that programs communicating from the local machine to the local machine use.    Here’s what the beginning of the output looks like on our machine:  $ ifconfig lo: flags=73   mtu 65536         inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0         ...         ...  For us, the loopback interface is lo. Now we can use the appropriate tcpdump com- mand to dump all traffic on this interface:   $ sudo tcpdump -i lo -X  NOTE Reading network traffic using tcpdump requires root permissions, so if you can’t run this command, just read along with the example that follows.  In another terminal on the same machine, start a mongod server without SSL enabled  change the data path as appropriate :  $ mongod --dbpath  data db   23 Many cloud hosting providers have tools to help with this, such as Virtual Private Clouds  VPCs , subnets, and  security groups in AWS.  www.it-ebooks.info   396  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  Then, connect to the database and insert a single document:  $ mongo ... > db.test.insert { "message" : "plaintext" }  > exit bye  Now, if you look at the tcpdump output in the terminal, you’ll see a number of packets output, one of which looks something like this:  16:05:10.507867 IP localhost.localdomain.50891 >       ➥  localhost.localdomain.27017 …     0x0000:  4500 007f aa4a 4000 4006 922c 7f00 0001  E....J@.@..,....     0x0010:  7f00 0001 c6cb 6989 cf17 1d67 d7e6 c88f  . ....i....g....     0x0020:  8018 0156 fe73 0000 0101 080a 0018 062e  ...V.s. ........     0x0030:  0017 b6f6 4b00 0000 0300 0000 ffff ffff  ....K. ......... b     0x0040:  d207 0000 0000 0000 7465 7374 2e74 6573  . ......test.tes     0x0050:  7400 2d00 0000 075f 6964 0054 7f7b 0649  t.-...._id.T.{.I     0x0060:  45fa 2cfc 65c5 8402 6d65 7373 6167 6500  E.,.e...message.        0x0070:  0a00 0000 706c 6169 6e74 6578 7400 00    ....plaintext..      Document sent in plaintext over the network  There’s our message, right in the clear B! This shows how important network  encryption is. Now, let’s run MongoDB with SSL and see what happens. RUN MONGODB WITH SSL First, generate the key for the server:  openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out mongodbcert.crt  -keyout mongodb-cert.key cat mongodb-cert.key mongodb-cert.crt > mongodb.pem  Then,  run  the  mongod  server  with  SSL,  using  the  --sslPEMKeyFile  and  --sslMode options:  $ mongod --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile mongodb.pem  Now, connect the client with SSL and do exactly the same operation:  $ mongo --ssl ... > db.test.insert { "message" : "plaintext" }  > exit bye  If  you  now  go  back  to  the  window  with  tcpdump,  you’ll  see  something  completely incomprehensible where the message used to be:  16:09:26.269944 IP localhost.localdomain.50899 >    ➥  localhost.localdomain.27017: …     0x0000:  4500 009c 52c3 4000 4006 e996 7f00 0001  E...R.@.@. .....     0x0010:  7f00 0001 c6d3 6989 c46a 4267 7ac5 5202  . ....i..jBgz.R.     0x0020:  8018 0173 fe90 0000 0101 080a 001b ed40  ...s. .........@  www.it-ebooks.info   Security  397  Document sent over the network securely encrypted      0x0030:  001b 6c4c 1703 0300 637d b671 2e7b 499d  ..lL....c}.q.{I. b     0x0040:  3fe8 b303 2933 d04b ff5c 3ccf fac2 023d  ?... 3.K.\<....=     0x0050:  b2a1 28a0 6d3f f215 54ea 4396 7f55 f8de  .. .m?..T.C..U..     0x0060:  bb8d 2e20 0889 f3db 2229 1645 ceed 2d20  . ......" .E..-.     0x0070:  1593 e508 6b33 9ae1 edb5 f099 9801 55ae  ....k3. ......U.     0x0080:  d443 6a65 2345 019f 3121 c570 3d9d 31b4  .CjeE..1!.p=.1.        0x0090:  bf80 ea12 e7ca 8c4e 777a 45dd            . .....NwzE.         Success! Is our system secure now? Not quite. Proper encryption is only one aspect of securing your system. In the next section, we’ll discuss how to verify the identity of ser- vices and users, and following that we’ll talk about how to get fine-grained control of what each user is allowed to do. SSL IN CLUSTERS Now you know how to set up SSL between the mongo shell and a single mongod, which raises the obvious question of how this extends to an entire cluster. Fortunately this is fairly similar to the previous example. Simply start every node in the cluster with the  --sslMode  requireSSL  option.  If  you’re  already  running  a  cluster  without  SSL, there’s an upgrade process to ensure that you can upgrade without losing connectivity between  your  nodes  in  the  transition;  see  https:  docs.mongodb.org manual tuto- rial upgrade-cluster-to-ssl .  Keep your keys safe! Most of the security mechanisms in this chapter depend on the exchange of keys. Make sure to keep your keys safe  and stored using the proper permissions  and not share them between servers except when necessary.   As an extreme example, if you use the same key across all machines, that means all an attacker has to do is compromise that single key to read all traffic on your network.  If you’re ever unsure about whether you should share a key, consult the official doc- umentation either for MongoDB or the underlying mechanism.  13.4.3 Authentication  The next layer of security is authentication. What good is network encryption if any- one on the internet can pose as a legitimate user and do whatever they want with your system?    Authentication allows you to verify the identity of services and users in a secure way. First we’ll discuss why and how to authenticate services and then users. We’ll then briefly  discuss  how  these  concepts  translate  to  replica  sets  and  sharded  clusters.  As always, we’ll cover the core concepts here, but you should consult the latest documen- tation for your version of MongoDB to ensure you’re up-to-date  https:  docs.mongodb .org manual core authentication .  www.it-ebooks.info   398  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  SERVICE AUTHENTICATION The first stage of authentication is verifying that the program on the other end of the connection is trusted. Why is this important? The main attack that this is meant to pre- vent is the man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker masquerades as both the client and the server to intercept all traffic between them. See figure 13.3 for an overview of this attack.  Client  Attacker  Server  Figure 13.3 Man-in-the-middle attack  As you can see in the figure, a man-in-the-middle attack is exactly what it sounds like:   A malicious attacker poses as a server, creating a connection with the client, and  then poses as the client and creates a connection with the server.     After that, it can not only decrypt and encrypt all the traffic between the client and server, but it can send arbitrary messages to both the client and the server.  Fortunately, there’s hope. The SSL library that MongoDB uses not only provides encryp- tion,  but  also  provides  something  called  certificate  authentication,  which  consists  of using a trusted third party not involved in the communication to verify the person sending the key is who they claim to be. In theory, the attacker hasn’t compromised the third party.   Generating certificates and getting them signed by the trusted third party, known as the  certificate  authority   CA   for  online  communication,  is  outside  the  scope  of  this book. There are numerous options here, and each is a topic on its own. To get started, you can work with a CA directly, such as Symantec, Comodo SSL, GlobalSign, and others, or you can use tools that have been built to make this process easier, such as SSLMate.   Once you have a certificate, you can use it in MongoDB like this  mongod --clusterAuthMode x509 --sslMode requireSSL --sslPEMKeyFile server.pem  --sslCAFile ca.pem mongo --ssl --sslPEMKeyFile client.pem  where  ca.pem  contains  the  root  certificate  chain  from  the  CA  and  client.pem  is signed by that CA. The server will use the contents of ca.pem to verify that client.pem was indeed signed by the CA and is therefore trusted.   Taking these steps will ensure that no malicious program can establish a connec- tion  to  your  database.  In  the  next  section,  you’ll  see  how  to  make  this  more  fine- grained and authenticate individual users in a single database. USER AUTHENTICATION Although service authentication is great for preventing attackers from even creating a connection to your system, sometimes we want to grant or revoke access on the level of individual users.  www.it-ebooks.info   Security  399  NOTE This API changed dramatically from v2.4 to v2.6, and may change again in future versions, so be sure to read the documentation for your server ver- sion  when  you  try  to  set  this  up.  The  examples  here  are  for  v2.6  and  v3.0, which support role-based authentication.  In MongoDB a role is essentially a set of privileges, and a privilege is any operation that can be performed in MongoDB. The role is a useful concept because sometimes our logical idea of a user “role” doesn’t map exactly to primitive database operations. For example, the built-in read role doesn’t only allow a user to perform find queries; it also allows users to run certain commands that display statistics about the databases and collections for which they have the read role.   MongoDB has a convenient set of built-in roles, but it also supports user-defined roles if these aren’t enough. We won’t cover roles in detail here; this topic falls into the category of more advanced and specialized security features, so if you’re in a situ- ation where you know you need user-defined roles, we recommend that you consult the  most  up-to-date  documentation  for  your  system  and  version  of  MongoDB.  For now, we’ll jump straight into an example of how to set up basic authentication for a single mongod. SETTING UP BASIC AUTHENTICATION First, you should start a mongod node with auth enabled. Note that if this node is in a sharded cluster or a replica set, you also need to pass options to allow it to authenti- cate with other servers. But for a single node, enabling authentication requires only one flag:  $ mongod --auth  Now, the first time you connect to the server, you want to add an administrative user account:  > use admin > db.createUser    {     user: "boss",     pwd: "supersecretpassword",     roles: [ { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" } ]   }    In  our  example,  we  gave  this  user  a  role  of  userAdminAnyDatabase,  which  essen- tially gives the user complete access to the system, including the ability to add and remove new users, as well as change user privileges. This is essentially the superuser of MongoDB.   Now that we’ve created our admin user, we can log in as this user:  > use admin > db.auth "boss", "supersecretpassword"   www.it-ebooks.info   400  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  We can now create users for individual databases. Once again we use the createUser method. The main differences here are the roles:  > use stocks > db.createUser    {     user: "trader",     pwd: "youlikemoneytoo",     roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "stocks" } ]   }   > db.createUser    {     user: "read-only-trader",     pwd: "weshouldtotallyhangout",     roles: [ { role: "read", db: "stocks" } ]   }    Now  the  trader  user  has  the  readWrite  role  on  the  stocks  database,  whereas  the read-only-trader only has the  read role. This essentially means that the first user can read and write stock data, and the second can only read it. Note that because we added these users to the stocks database, we need to authenticate using that database as well:  > use stocks > db.auth "trader", "youlikemoneytoo"   REMOVING A USER To remove a user, use the dropUser helper on the database it was added to:  > use stocks > db.dropUser "trader"   This is a bit heavyweight, so note that you can also revoke user access without com- pletely dropping them from the system using the revokeRolesFromUser helper, and grant them roles again using the grantRolesToUser helper.   To close the session you don’t need to explicitly log out; terminating the connec- tion  closing the shell  will accomplish that just fine. But there’s a helper for logging out if you need it:  > db.logout    Naturally, you can use all the authentication logic we’ve explored here using the driv- ers. Check your driver’s API for the details.  www.it-ebooks.info   13.4.4 Replica set authentication  Security  401  Localhost exception You may have noticed we were able to add a user before authenticating our connec- tion. This may seem like a security vulnerability, but it’s actually due to a convenience provided by MongoDB called the localhost exception.   This means that if the server hasn’t yet been configured, any connections from the local machine get full permissions. After you add your first user, unauthenticated con- nections  don’t  have  privileges,  as  you’d  expect.  You  can  pass  --setParameter enableLocalhostAuthBypass=0 on the command line to disable this behavior and set up your first admin user by first starting the server with authentication completely disabled, adding the user, and then restarting with authentication enabled.   This approach isn’t any more secure—during the same window where the localhost exception would’ve been a factor, anyone could’ve come into your system—but it’s another option.  Replica sets support the same authentication API just described, but enabling authen- tication for a replica set requires extra configuration, because not only do clients need to be able to authenticate with the replica set, but replica set nodes also need to be able to authenticate with each other.   Internal replica set authentication can be done via two separate mechanisms:    Key file authentication    X509 authentication  In both cases, each replica set node authenticates itself with the others as a special internal user that has enough privileges to make replication work properly. KEY FILE AUTHENTICATION The simpler and less secure authentication mechanism is key file authentication. This essentially involves creating a “key file” for each node that contains the password that replica set node will use to authenticate with the other nodes in the replica set. The upside of this is that it’s easy to set up, but the downside is that if an attacker compro- mises just one machine, you’ll have to change the password for every node in the clus- ter, which unfortunately can’t be done without downtime.   To start, create the file containing your secret. The contents of the file will serve as the password that each replica set member uses to authenticate with the others. As an example, you might create a file called secret.txt and fill it with the following  don’t actually use this password in a real cluster :  tOps3cr3tpa55word  Place  the  file  on  each  replica  set  member’s  machine  and  adjust  the  permissions  so that it’s accessible only by the owner:  sudo chmod 600  home mongodb secret.txt  www.it-ebooks.info   402  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  Finally, start each replica set member by specifying the location of the password file using the --keyFile option:  mongod --keyFile  home mongodb secret.txt  Authentication will now be enabled for the set. You’ll want to create an admin user in advance, as you did in the previous section. X509 AUTHENTICATION X509  certificate  authentication  is  built  into  OpenSSL,  the  library  MongoDB  uses  to encrypt network traffic. As we mentioned earlier, obtaining signed certificates is out- side the scope of this book. However, once you have them, you can start each node like this  mongod --replSet myReplSet --sslMode requireSSL --clusterAuthMode x509 -- sslClusterFile --sslPEMKeyFile server.pem --sslCAFile ca.pem  where  server.pem  is  a  key  signed  by  the  certificate  authority  that  ca.pem  corre- sponds to.   There’s a way to upgrade a system using key file authentication to use X509 certifi- cates with no downtime. See the MongoDB docs for the details on how to do this, or check  in  the  latest  MMS  documentation  to  see  whether  support  has  been  added  to MMS automation.  13.4.5 Sharding authentication  Sharding authentication is an extension of replica set authentication. Each replica set in the cluster is secured as described in the previous section. In addition, all the config servers and every mongos instance can be set up to authenticate with the rest of the cluster in exactly the same way, using either a shared key file or using X509 certificate authentication. Once you’ve done this, the whole cluster can use authentication.  13.4.6 Enterprise security features  Some security features exist only in MongoDB’s paid enterprise plug-in. For example, the  authentication  and  authorization  mechanisms  that  allow  MongoDB  to  interact with  Kerberos  and  LDAP  are  enterprise.  In  addition,  the  enterprise  module  adds auditing support so that security-related events get tracked and logged. The MongoDB docs will explicitly mention if a particular feature is enterprise only.  13.5 Administrative tasks  In this section, we’ll cover some basic administrative tasks, including importing and exporting data, dealing with disk fragmentation, and upgrading your system.  13.5.1 Data imports and exports  If you’re migrating an existing system to MongoDB, or if you need to seed the data- base with information from, something like a data warehouse, you’ll need an efficient  www.it-ebooks.info   Administrative tasks  403  import method. You might also need a good export strategy, because you may have to export data from MongoDB to external processing jobs. For example, exporting data to Hadoop for batch processing has become a common practice.24  There are two ways to import and export data with MongoDB:   Use the included tools, mongoimport and mongoexport.    Write a simple program using one of the drivers.25  MONGOIMPORT AND MONGOEXPORT Bundled with MongoDB are two utilities for importing and exporting data: mongoimport and mongoexport. You can use mongoimport to import JSON, CSV, and TSV files. This is frequently useful for loading data from relational databases into MongoDB:  $ mongoimport -d stocks -c values --type csv --headerline stocks.csv  In the example, you import a CSV file called stocks.csv into the values collection of the  stocks database. The  --headerline flag indicates that the first line of the  CSV contains the field names. You can see all the import options by running mongoimport --help.   Use mongoexport to export all of a collection’s data to a JSON or CSV file:  $ mongoexport -d stocks -c values -o stocks.csv  This command exports data to the file stocks.csv. As with its counterpart, you can see the rest of mongoexport’s command options by starting it with the --help flag. CUSTOM IMPORT AND EXPORT SCRIPTS You’re likely to use MongoDB’s import and export tools when the data you’re dealing with is relatively flat; once you introduce subdocuments and arrays, the  CSV format becomes awkward because it’s not designed to represent nested data.     When  you  need  to  export  a  rich  document  to  CSV  or  import  a  CSV  to  a  rich MongoDB document, it may be easier to build a custom tool instead. You can do this using any of the drivers. For example, MongoDB users commonly write scripts that connect to a relational database and then combine the data from two tables into a single collection.   That’s the tricky part about moving data in and out of MongoDB: the way the data is modeled may differ between systems. In these cases, be prepared to use the drivers as your conversion tools.  13.5.2 Compaction and repair  MongoDB includes a built-in tool for repairing a database. You can initiate it from the command line to repair all databases on the server:  $ mongod --repair  24 There’s also a Hadoop plug-in for MongoDB, sometimes known as the MongoDB Connector for Hadoop. 25 You can also use a tool known as mongoconnector to keep a different storage system in sync with MongoDB.  www.it-ebooks.info   404  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  Or you can run the repairDatabase command to repair a single database:  > use cloud-docs > db.runCommand {repairDatabase: 1}   Repair is an offline operation. While it’s running, the database will be locked against reads and writes. The repair process works by reading and rewriting all data files, dis- carding  any  corrupted  documents  in  the  process.  It  also  rebuilds  each  index.  This means that to repair a database, you need enough free disk space to store the rewrite of its data. To say repairs are expensive is an understatement, as repairing a large data- base can take days and impact traffic to other databases on the same node.   MongoDB’s repair was originally used as a kind of last-ditch effort for recovering a corrupted database. In the event of an unclean shutdown, without journaling enabled, a repair is the only way to return the data files to a consistent state, and even then you may lose data. Fortunately, if you deploy with replication, run at least one server with journaling enabled, and perform regular off-site backups, you should never have to recover by running a repair. Relying on repair for recovery is foolish. Avoid it.   What, then, might a database repair be good for? Running a repair will compact the data files and rebuild the indexes. As of the v2.0 release, MongoDB doesn’t have great  support  for  data  file  compaction.  If  you  perform  lots  of  random  deletes,  and especially if you’re deleting small documents  less than 4 KB , it’s possible for total storage  size  to  remain  constant  or  grow  despite  these  regularly  occurring  deletes. Compacting the data files is a good remedy for this excess use of space.26    If  you  don’t  have  the  time  or  resources  to  run  a  complete  repair,  you  have  two  options, both of which operate on a single collection:     Rebuilding indexes    Compacting the collection   To rebuild indexes, use the reIndex   method:  > use cloud-docs > db.spreadsheets.reIndex    This might be useful, but generally speaking, index space is efficiently reused. The data file space is what can be a problem, so the compact command is usually a better choice. compact will rewrite the data files and rebuild all indexes for one collection. Here’s  how you run it from the shell:  > db.runCommand { compact: "spreadsheets" }   This command has been designed to be run on a live secondary, obviating the need for downtime. Once you’ve finished compacting all the secondaries in a replica set, you can step down the primary and then compact that node. If you must run the compact  26 Compacting your data on disk may also result in more efficient use of space in RAM.  www.it-ebooks.info   13.5.3 Upgrading  Performance troubleshooting  405  command on the primary, you can do so by adding {force: true} to the command object. Note that if you go this route, the command will write lock the system:  > db.runCommand { compact: "spreadsheets", force: true }   On WiredTiger databases, the compact   command will release unneeded disk space to the operating system. Also note that the paddingFactor field, which is applicable for the MMAPv1 storage engine, has no effect when used with the WiredTiger stor- age engine.  As with any software project, you should keep your MongoDB deployment as up to date  as  possible,  because  newer  versions  contain  many  important  bug  fixes  and improvements.   One of the core design principles behind MongoDB is to always ensure an upgrade is possible with no downtime. For a replica set, this means a rolling upgrade, and for a sharded cluster, this means that mongos routers can still function against mixed clusters.   You can take one of two paths when dealing with upgrades:    First, you can choose to do the process manually. In this case you should check the  release  notes  describing  the  upgrade  process  and  read  them  carefully. Sometimes there are important caveats or steps that must be taken to ensure that the upgrade is safe. The advantage here is that you have complete control over the process and know exactly what’s happening when.     The  second  option  is  to  again  use  the  MongoDB  Management  Service.  MMS Automation not only can be used to provision your nodes, but can also be used to  upgrade  them.  Be  sure  to  read  the  release  notes  for  the  version  you’re upgrading  to  as  well  as  the  MMS  documentation  to  be  sure  you  know  what’s happening under the hood.  13.6 Performance troubleshooting  Performance in MongoDB is a complicated issue that touches on nearly every other topic. It’s nearly impossible to know exactly how your application will perform before you test it with your specific workload and environment. A node on the Joyent Cloud will have completely different performance characteristics than a node on EC2, which will again have completely different performance characteristics than a node that you installed in your own private datacenter.   In this section, we’ll address some common issues that come up in MongoDB sup- port, as least up through version 3.0, that are important to watch out for. First, we’ll reintroduce the working set concept; then we’ll cover two ways the working set can affect your system: the performance cliff and query interactions.   In the end, it’s up to you to monitor your system closely and understand how it’s behaving.  Good  monitoring  could  be  the  difference  between  quickly  resolving,  or  www.it-ebooks.info   406  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  even  predicting  and  preventing  performance  issues,  and  having  angry  users  be  the first to tell you your systems have slowed to a crawl.  13.6.1 Working set  We’ve  covered  the  idea  of  the  working  set  in  various  parts  of  this  book,  but  we’ll define it here again with a focus on your production deployment.   Imagine you have a machine with 8 GB of RAM, running a database with an on-disk size of 16 GB, not including indexes. Your working set is how much data you’re access- ing in a specified time interval. In this example, if your queries are all full collection scans, your “working set” will be 16 GB because to answer those queries your entire database must be paged into memory.    But if your queries are properly indexed, and you’re only querying for the most recent quarter of the data, most of your database can stay on disk, and only the 2 GB that you need, plus some extra space for indexes, needs to be in memory.   Figure 13.4 shows visually what this means for your disk use.  Working set smaller  than RAM  Working set larger  than RAM  RAM  RAM  Disk  Disk  Figure 13.4 The impact on disk usage when the working set exceeds RAM  In the bottom row of the figure, when you’re doing full table scans, you have a lot of thrashing, or moving blocks of data in and out of RAM, because you can’t keep all 16 GB in your 8 GB of RAM at once.    In the top example, you can bring the 2 GB you need into memory, and then keep it there, answering all the queries with only minimal disk access. This illustrates not only why keeping your working set in RAM is extremely important, but also shows how a simple change, such as adding the right index, can completely change your perfor- mance characteristics.  www.it-ebooks.info   13.6.2 Performance cliff  Performance troubleshooting  407  Closely related to the working set concept is an unfortunate artifact of the way Mon- goDB runs queries. As of 3.0, MongoDB doesn’t limit the resources a single operation can use27, nor does it explicitly push back on clients when it’s starting to become over- whelmed. As long as you aren’t approaching MongoDB’s limits, this won’t be a prob- lem, but as you reach the limit, you may see a “performance cliff.”   To see why this is the case, imagine you have a system with 8 GB of RAM, running a database that’s 64 GB on disk. Most of the time, your working set is only 6 GB, and your application performs perfectly well. Now, fast-forward to Christmas Eve, when you see a  traffic  spike  big  enough  to  bring  you  to  8  GB.  MongoDB  will  start  to  slow  down, because  the  working  set  no  longer  fits  in  memory  and  will  start  thrashing  to  disk. Despite this, MongoDB will continue to accept new requests.    The combination of slowing down while still accepting new requests is disastrous for performance, and you may see a steep drop-off at this point. If you think this will be  a  concern  for  you,  we  strongly  recommend  that  you  understand  exactly  how much load your MongoDB deployment can handle, and if possible put some kind of load balancer in front of it that will ensure that you steer away from the edge of this precipice.  13.6.3 Query interactions  Another side effect of the fact that MongoDB doesn’t enforce resource limits is that one badly behaving query can affect the performance of all other queries on the system.   It’s the same drill as before. Assume you have a working set of 2 GB, with a 64 GB database. Everything may be going well, until someone runs a query that performs a full collection scan. This query will not only place a huge amount of load on the disk, but may also page out the data that was being used for the other queries on the sys- tem,  causing  slowdown  there  as  well.  Figure  13.4  from  earlier  illustrates  this  issue, where the top represents normal query load and the bottom represents the load after the bad query.   This is actually another reason why access controls are important. Even if you get everything  else  right,  one  table  scan  by  an  intern  can  hose  your  system.  Make  sure everyone who has the ability to query your database understands the consequences of a bad query.28  27 A crude approximation is the  maxTimeMS cursor option, which sets a maximum time limit for processing operations. This won’t prevent one resource-hungry operation from interfering with others, but it will at least kill operations that run for longer than expected.  28 You can mitigate this a bit by running your long-running queries on secondaries, but remember from chapter 11 that the secondary must have enough bandwidth to keep up with the primary, otherwise it will fall off the end of the oplog.  www.it-ebooks.info   408  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  All about the indexes When  you  discover  a  performance  issue,  indexes  are  the  first  place  you  should look. Unless your operation is insert only, indexes are a vital part of ensuring good performance.  Chapter 8 outlines a procedure for identifying and fixing slow operations that involves enabling the query profiler and then ensuring that every query and update uses an index efficiently. In general, this means each operation scans as few documents as possible.  It’s also important to make sure there are no redundant indexes, because a redun- dant index will take up space on disk, require more RAM, and demand more work on each write. Chapter 8 mentions ways to eliminate these redundant indexes.  What then? After auditing your indexes and queries, you may discover inefficiencies that, when corrected, fix the performance problems altogether. You’ll no longer see slow query warnings in the logs, and the iostat output will show reduced utilization. Adjusting indexes fixes performance issues more often than you might think; this should always be the first place you look when addressing a performance issue.  13.6.4 Seek professional assistance  The sources of performance degradations are manifold and frequently idiosyncratic. Anything from poor schema design to sneaky server bugs can negatively affect perfor- mance. If you think you’ve tried every possible remedy and still can’t get results, con- sider allowing someone experienced in the ways of MongoDB to audit your system. A book can take you far, but an experienced human being can make all the difference in  the  world.  When  you’re  at  a  loss  for  ideas  and  in  doubt,  seek  professional  assis- tance. The solutions to performance issues are sometimes entirely unintuitive.   When or if you seek help, be sure to provide all the information you have about your system when the issue occurred. This is when the monitoring will pay off. The official standard used by MongoDB is MMS Monitoring, so if you’re using MongoDB support, being set up with MMS Monitoring will speed up the process significantly.  13.7 Deployment checklist  We’ve covered a lot of topics in this chapter. It may seem overwhelming at first, but as long as you have the main areas covered, your system will keep running smoothly. This section is a quick reference for making sure you’ve got the important points covered:    Hardware  – RAM—Enough to handle the expected working set. – Disk  space—Enough  space  to  handle  all  your  data,  indexes,  and  MongoDB  internal metadata.  – Disk speed—Enough to satisfy your latency and throughput requirements. Con- sider this in conjunction with RAM—less RAM usually means more disk usage.  www.it-ebooks.info   Deployment checklist  409  – CPU—Usually not the bottleneck for MongoDB, but if you’re getting low disk utilization but low throughput, you may have a CPU bound workload. Check this as part of careful performance testing.  – Network—Make sure the network is fast and reliable enough to satisfy your performance requirements. MongoDB nodes communicate with each other internally, so be sure to test every connection, not just the ones from your cli- ents to the mongos or mongod servers.    Security    Monitoring  – Protection of network traffic—Either run in a completely isolated environment or make sure your traffic is encrypted using MongoDB’s built-in SSL support or some external method such as a VPN to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. – Access control—Make sure only trusted users and clients programs can oper-  ate on the database. Make sure your interns don’t have the “root” privilege.  – Hardware usage  disks, CPU, network, RAM —Make sure you have some kind of monitoring  setup  for  all  your  hardware  resources  that  will  not  only  keep track of the usage, but also alert you if it goes above a certain threshold.  – Health  checks—Periodically  make  sure  your  servers  are  up  and  responsive,  and will alert you if anyone stops calling back.  – MMS  Monitoring—Monitor  your  services  using  MMS  Monitoring.  Not  only does  this  provide  monitoring,  health  checks,  and  alerts,  but  it’s  what  the MongoDB support team will use to help you if you run into trouble. Histori- cally it’s been free to use, so don’t hesitate to add this to your deployment.  – Client performance monitoring—Periodically run automated end-to-end tests as a client to ensure that you’re still performing as well as you expect. The last thing you want is for a client to be the first one to tell you that your applica- tion is slow.    Disaster recovery  – Evaluate risk—Imagine that you’ve lost all your data. How sad do you feel? In all seriousness, losing your data may be worse in some applications than oth- ers.  If  you’re  analyzing  Twitter  trends,  losing  your  data  may  cost  a  week’s worth of time, whereas if you’re storing bank data, losing that may cost quite a bit more. When you do this evaluation, assume that a disaster of some kind will happen, and plan accordingly.  – Have a plan—Create a concrete plan for how you’ll recover in each failure case.  Depending on how your system fails, you may react completely differently.  – Test your plan—Be sure to test your plan. The biggest mistake people make with  backups  and  disaster  recovery  is  assuming  that  having  a  backup  or  a plan  is  enough.  It’s  not  enough.  Maybe  the  backup  is  getting  corrupted. Maybe it’s in a format that’s impossible to reimport into your production sys- tems. As in a production system, many things can go wrong, so it’s important to make sure your recovery strategy works.   www.it-ebooks.info   410  CHAPTER 13 Deployment and administration  13.8 Summary  – Have  a  backup  plan—Your  first  disaster  recovery  plan  might  fail.  When  it does,  have  a  last  resort  available.  This  doesn’t  have  to  be  an  appealing option, but you’ll be happy it’s there if you get desperate.    Performance  – Load testing—Make sure you load test your application with a realistic work- load. In the end, this is the only way to be sure that your performance is what you expect.  This chapter has presented the most important considerations for deploying MongoDB in production. You should have the knowledge you need to select the right hardware for MongoDB, monitor your deployments, and maintain regular backups. In addition, you should have some idea about how to go about resolving performance issues. Ulti- mately,  this  knowledge  will  develop  with  experience.  But  MongoDB  is  predictable enough to be amenable to the simple heuristic presented here—except for when it isn’t. MongoDB tries to make life simple, but databases and their interactions with live applications are frankly complex. The guidelines in this chapter can point you in the right direction, but in the end it’s up to you to take an active role in understanding your system. Make sure you take full advantage of the resources available, from the MongoDB  documentation  all  the  way  to  the  official  and  community  support  from MongoDB maintainers and users.  www.it-ebooks.info   appendix A Installation  A.1  In  this  appendix  you’ll  learn  how  to  install  MongoDB  on  Linux,  Mac  OS  X,  and Windows, and you’ll get at an overview of MongoDB’s most commonly used config- uration options. For developers, there are a few notes on compiling MongoDB from its source.     We’ll  conclude  with  some  pointers  on  installing  Ruby  and  RubyGems  to  aid  those wanting to run the Ruby-based examples from the book.   Installation Before we proceed to the installation instructions, a note on MongoDB version- ing is in order. Briefly, you should run the latest stable version for your architec- ture. Stable releases of MongoDB are marked by an even minor version number. Thus, versions 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6 and 3.0 are stable; 2.1, 2.3, and 2.5 are devel- opment  versions  and  shouldn’t  be  used  in  production.  The  downloads  page  at www.mongodb.org provides  statically  linked  binaries  compiled  for  32-  and  64-bit systems. But as of MongoDB v3.0, 32-bit binaries will no longer be supported. These binaries are available for the latest stable releases as well as for the development branches and nightly  builds  of  the  latest  revision.  The  binaries  provide  an  easy way  to  install  MongoDB  across  most  platforms,  including  Linux,  Mac  OS  X,  Win- dows, and Solaris, and they’re the method we’ll prefer here. If you run into trou- ble,  you  can  find  more  information  in  the  official  MongoDB  manual  at  http:   docs.mongodb.org manual installation.  A.1.1  Production deployments  Using a package manager installation may be preferable for server deployments of MongoDB,  because  the  package  installation  usually  includes  scripts  to  start  and stop MongoDB when the machine restarts. In the precompiled binary installation  411  www.it-ebooks.info   412  APPENDIX A Installation  described here, we demonstrate how to run MongoDB from the command line, which is  perfect  for  learning  and  debugging  but  not  ideal  if  you’re  running  a  server  that other people are accessing. Each operating system distribution and package manage- ment system has small differences and idiosyncrasies, such as where MongoDB’s log file is placed. If you plan on running MongoDB as a production service, you should understand  MongoDB’s  configuration  and  think  through  error  scenarios,  such  as what would happen if the server suddenly goes down. If you’re just learning MongoDB or experimenting with it, any installation method is fine.  A.1.2  32-bit vs. 64-bit  You can download MongoDB binaries compiled for 32- or 64-bit architectures depend- ing on the MongoDB version. If you’re installing MongoDB on a 64-bit machine, we highly recommended that you use the 64-bit binaries because the 32-bit installation is limited to storing only 2 GB of data. Most machines nowadays are 64-bit, but if you’re unsure you can check a Linux or Mac OS X machine by running the command  $ uname –a  which prints information about the operating system. If the OS version includes the text x86_64  as opposed to i386 , then you’re running a 64-bit version. For Windows machines, check the documentation for how to determine which architecture your OS is running.  A.2 MongoDB on Linux  There are three ways to install MongoDB on Linux. You can download the precom- piled  binaries  directly  from  the  mongodb.org  website,  use  a  package  manager,  or compile  manually  from  source.  We’ll  discuss  the  first  two  in  the  next  sections,  and then provide a few notes on compiling later in the appendix.   A.2.1  Installing with precompiled binaries  First navigate to www.mongodb.org downloads. There you’ll see a grid with all the latest downloadable MongoDB binaries. Select the download URL for the latest sta- ble version for your architecture. These examples use MongoDB v2.6 compiled for a 64-bit system.    Open a command line and download the archive using your web browser, the curl utility  or  the  wget  utility.   You  should  check  on  the  downloads  page  for  the  most recent release.  Then expand the archive using tar:  $ curl http:  downloads.mongodb.org linux mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.7.tgz >  mongo.tgz $ tar xzvf mongo.tgz  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB on Linux  413  To run MongoDB, you’ll need a data directory. By default, the  mongod daemon will store its data files in  data db. Create that directory, and ensure that it has the proper permissions:  $ sudo mkdir -p  data db  $ sudo chown `id -u`  data db  You’re ready to start the server. Change to the MongoDB bin directory and launch the mongod executable:  cd mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.7 bin . mongod  If all goes well, you should see something like the following abridged startup log. The first time you start the server it may allocate journal files, which takes several minutes, before being ready for connections. Note the last lines, confirming that the server is listening on the default port of 27017:  Thu Mar 10 11:28:51 [initandlisten] MongoDB starting :   pid=1773 port=27017 dbpath= data db  64-bit host=iron Thu Mar 10 11:28:51 [initandlisten] db version v2.6.7 ...

If the server terminates unexpectedly, refer to section A.6.   At the time of writing this, the most recent MongoDB release is 3.0.6.  Package managers can greatly simplify the installation of MongoDB. The only major downside is that package maintainers may not always keep up with the latest MongoDB releases. It’s important to run the latest stable point release, so if you do choose to use a package manager, be sure that the version you’re installing is a recent one.    If you happen to be running Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, or Fedora, you’ll always have access to the latest versions. This is because MongoDB, Inc. maintains and pub- lishes its own packages for these platforms. You can find more information on install- ing these particular packages on the mongodb.org website. Instructions for Debian and Ubuntu can be found at http:  mng.bz ZffG. For CentOS and Fedora, see http:   mng.bz JSjC.    Packages are also available for FreeBSD and ArchLinux. See their respective pack- age repositories for details. There may also be other package managers not listed here that include MongoDB. Check the downloads page at www.mongodb.org downloads for more details.  A.2.2 Using a package manager  www.it-ebooks.info   414  APPENDIX A Installation  A.3 MongoDB on Mac OS X  If  you’re  using  Mac  OS  X,  you  have  three  options  for  installing  MongoDB.  You  can download  the  precompiled  binaries  directly  from  the  mongodb.org  website,  use  a package manager, or compile manually from source. We’ll discuss the first two options in the next sections, and then provide a few notes on compiling later in the appendix.   A.3.1  Precompiled binaries First navigate to www.mongodb.org downloads. There you’ll see a grid with all the lat- est  downloadable  MongoDB  binaries.  Select  the  download  URL  for  the  latest  stable version for your architecture. The following example uses MongoDB v3.0.6 compiled for a 64-bit system.    Download the archive using your web browser or the curl utility. You should check on the downloads page for the most recent release. Then expand the archive using tar:  $ curl https:  fastdl.mongodb.org osx mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.0.6.tgz >  mongo.tgz $ tar xzvf mongo.tgz  To run MongoDB, you’ll need a data directory. By default, the  mongod daemon will store its data files in  data db. Go ahead and create that directory:   $ sudo mkdir -p  data db  $ sudo chown `id -u`  data db  You’re now ready to start the server. Just change to the MongoDB bin directory and launch the mongod executable:   $ cd mongodb-osx-x86_64-3.0.6 bin $ . mongod  If all goes well, you should see something like the following abridged startup log. The first time you start the server it may allocate journal files, which takes several minutes, before being ready for connections. Note the last lines, confirming that the server is listening on the default port of 27017:   2015-09-19T08:51:40.214+0300 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] MongoDB starting :   pid=41310 port=27017 dbpath= data db 64-bit host=iron.local  2015-09-19T08:51:40.214+0300 I CONTROL  [initandlisten] db version v3.0.6 ... 2015-09-19T08:51:40.215+0300 I INDEX    [initandlisten] allocating new ns   file  data db local.ns, filling with zeroes...  2015-09-19T08:51:40.240+0300 I STORAGE  [FileAllocator] allocating new   datafile  data db local.0, filling with zeroes...  2015-09-19T08:51:40.240+0300 I STORAGE  [FileAllocator] creating directory    data db _tmp  2015-09-19T08:51:40.317+0300 I STORAGE  [FileAllocator] done allocating   datafile  data db local.0, size: 64MB,  took 0.077 secs  2015-09-19T08:51:40.344+0300 I NETWORK  [initandlisten] waiting for   connections on port 27017  www.it-ebooks.info   MongoDB on Windows  415  You should now be able to connect to the MongoDB server using the JavaScript con- sole by running . mongo. If the server terminates unexpectedly, refer to section A.6.   A.3.2 Using a package manager  MacPorts   http:  macports.org   and  Homebrew   http:  brew.sh    are  two  package managers for Mac OS X known to maintain up-to-date versions of MongoDB. To install via MacPorts, run the following:   sudo port install mongodb  Note that MacPorts will build MongoDB and all its dependencies from scratch. If you go this route, be prepared for a lengthy compile.     Homebrew,  rather  than  compiling,  merely  downloads  the  latest  binaries,  so  it’s much faster than MacPorts. You can install MongoDB through Homebrew as follows:   $ brew update $ brew install mongodb  After installing, Homebrew will provide instructions on how to start MongoDB using the Mac OS X launch agent.   A.4 MongoDB on Windows  If  you’re  using  Windows,  you  have  two  ways  to  install  MongoDB.  The  easier,  pre- ferred way is to download the precompiled binaries directly from the mongodb.org website. You can also compile from source, but this option is recommended only for developers and advanced users. You can read about compiling from source in the next section.   A.4.1  Precompiled binaries  First navigate to www.mongodb.org downloads. There you’ll see a grid with all the latest downloadable MongoDB binaries. Select the download URL for the latest sta- ble  version  for  your  architecture.  Here  we’ll  install  MongoDB  v2.6  compiled  for 64-bit Windows.   Download the appropriate distribution and unzip it. You can do this from the Win- dows  Explorer  by  locating  the  MongoDB  ZIP  file,  right-clicking  on  it,  and  selecting Extract  All.  You’ll  then  be  able  to  choose  the  folder  where  the  contents  will  be unzipped.  Please  keep  in  mind  that  because  MongoDB  v2.6,  prebuilt  MSIs  are  also available for download.    Alternatively,  you  can  use  the  command  line.  First  navigate  to  your  Downloads  directory. Then use the unzip utility to extract the archive:   C:\> cd \Users\kyle\Downloads C:\> unzip mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.6.7.zip  www.it-ebooks.info   416  APPENDIX A Installation  To run MongoDB, you’ll need a data folder. By default, the mongod daemon will store its data files in C:\data\db. Open the Windows command prompt and create the folder like this:   C:\> mkdir \data C:\> mkdir \data\db  You’re  now  ready  to  start  the  server.  Change  to  the  MongoDB  bin  directory  and launch the mongod executable:   C:\> cd \Users\kyle\Downloads C:\Users\kyle\Downloads> cd mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.6.7\bin C:\Users\kyle\Downloads\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.6.7\bin> mongod.exe  If all goes well, you should see something like the following abridged startup log. The first time you start the server it may allocate journal files, which takes several minutes, before being ready for connections. Note the last lines, confirming that the server is listening on the default port of 27017:   Thu Mar 10 11:28:51 [initandlisten] MongoDB starting :   pid=1773 port=27017 dbpath= data db  64-bit host=iron Thu Mar 10 11:28:51 [initandlisten] db version v2.6.7 ...

Finally, you’ll want to start the MongoDB shell. To do that, open a second terminal  window, and then launch mongo.exe:   C:\> cd \Users\kyle\Downloads\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.6.7\bin C:\Users\kyle\Downloads\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.6.7\bin> mongo.exe  A.5  Compiling MongoDB from source Compiling  MongoDB  from  source  is  recommended  only  for  advanced  users  and developers. If all you want to do is operate on the bleeding edge, without having to compile, you can always download the nightly binaries for the latest revisions from the mongodb.org website.    That said, you may want to compile yourself. The trickiest part about compiling MongoDB is managing the various dependencies. The latest compilation instructions for each platform can be found at www.mongodb.org about contributors tutorial  build-mongodb-from-source.   A.6  Troubleshooting MongoDB  is  easy  to  install,  but  users  occasionally  experience  minor  problems. These usually manifest as error messages generated when trying to start the mongod  www.it-ebooks.info   Troubleshooting  417  daemon. Here we provide a list of the most common of these errors along with their resolutions.  A.6.1 Wrong architecture  If you try to run a binary compiled for a 64-bit system on a 32-bit machine, you’ll see an error like the following:   bash: . mongod: cannot execute binary file  On Windows 7, the message is more helpful:  This version of C:\Users\kyle\Downloads\mongodb-win32-x86_64-2.6.7\bin\mongod.exe is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need a x86  32-bit  or x64  64-bit  version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.  The solution in both cases is to download and then run the 32-bit binary instead. Bina- ries for both architectures are available on the MongoDB download site  www.mongodb .org downloads .   A.6.2 Nonexistent data directory  MongoDB requires a directory for storing its data files. If the directory doesn’t exist, you’ll see an error like the following:   dbpath   data db   does not exist, terminating  The solution is to create this directory. To see how, consult the preceding instructions for your OS.   A.6.3  Lack of permissions If you’re running on a Unix variant, you’ll need to make sure that the user running the mongod executable has permissions to write to the data directory. Otherwise, you’ll see this error   Permission denied: " data db mongod.lock", terminating  or possibly this one:  Unable to acquire lock for lockfilepath:  data db mongod.lock, terminating  In either case, you can solve the problem by opening up permissions in the data direc- tory using chmod or chown.   www.it-ebooks.info   418  APPENDIX A Installation  A.6.4 Unable to bind to port  MongoDB  runs  by  default  on  port  27017.  If  another  process,  or  another  mongod,  is bound to the same port, you’ll see this error:  listen  : bind   failed errno:98     Address already in use for socket: 0.0.0.0:27017  This issue has two possible solutions. The first is to find out what other process is running on port 27017 and then terminate it, provided that it isn’t being used for some other purpose. One way of finding which process listens to port number 27017 is the following:  sudo lsof -i :27017  The output of the lsof command will also reveal the process ID of the process that listens to port number 27017, which can be used for killing the process using the kill command.   Alternatively, run mongod on a different port using the --port flag, which seems to  be a better and easier solution. Here’s how to run MongoDB on port 27018:   mongod --port 27018  A.7  Basic configuration options Here’s a brief overview of the flags most commonly used when running MongoDB:    --dbpath—The path to the directory where the data files are to be stored. This defaults  to   data db  and  is  useful  if  you  want  to  store  your  MongoDB  data elsewhere.    --logpath—The path to the file where log output should be directed. Log out-  put will be printed to standard output  stdout  by default.    --port—The port that MongoDB listens on. If not specified, it’s set to 27017.   --rest—This flag enables a simple REST interface that enhances the server’s default  web  console.  The  web  console  is  always  available  1000  port  numbers above the port the server listens on. Thus if the server is listening at localhost on port 27017, then the web console will be available at http:  localhost:28017. Spend some time exploring the web console and the commands it exposes; you can discover a lot about a live MongoDB server this way.    --fork—Detaches the process to run as a daemon. Note that fork works only on Unix variants. Windows users seeking similar functionality should look at the instructions  for  running  MongoDB  as  a  proper  Windows  service.  These  are available at www.mongodb.org.  Those are the most important of the MongoDB startup flags. Here’s an example of their use on the command line:  $ mongod --dbpath  var local mongodb --logpath  var log mongodb.log --port 27018 --rest --fork  www.it-ebooks.info   Installing Ruby  419  Note that it’s also possible to specify all of these options in a config file. Create a new text file  we’ll call it mongodb.conf  and you can specify the config file equivalent1 of all the preceding options:  storage:     dbPath: “ var local mongodb” systemLog:     destination: file     path: “ var log mongodb.log” net:     port: 27018     http:         RESTInterfaceEnabled: true processManagement:     fork: true  You can then invoke mongod using the config file with the -f option:   $ mongod -f mongodb.conf  If you ever find yourself connected to a MongoDB and wondering which options were used at startup, you can get a list of them by running the getCmdLineOpts command:   > use admin > db.runCommand {getCmdLineOpts: 1}   A.8  Installing Ruby A number of the examples in this book are written in Ruby, so to run them yourself, you’ll need a working Ruby installation. This means installing the Ruby interpreter as well as Ruby’s package manager, RubyGems.   You should use a newer version of Ruby, such as 1.9.3 or preferably 2.2.3, which is the current stable version. Version 1.8.7 is still used by many people, and it works well with MongoDB, but the newer versions of Ruby offer advantages such as better charac- ter encoding that make it worthwhile to upgrade.  A.8.1  Linux and Mac OS X Ruby comes installed by default on Max OS X and on a number of Linux distributions. You may want to check whether you have a recent version by running   ruby -v  If the command isn’t found, or if you’re running a version older than 1.8.7, you’ll want to install or upgrade. There are detailed instructions for installing Ruby on Mac OS X as well as on a number of Unix variants at https:  www.ruby-lang.org en downloads   1 As of 2.6, MongoDB uses a YAML config file format.  See docs.mongodb.org manual reference configura-  tion-options for the current documentation on the available options.  www.it-ebooks.info   420  APPENDIX A Installation   you  may  have  to  scroll  down  the  page  to  see  the  instructions  for  the  various  plat- forms .  Most  package  managers   such  as  MacPorts  and  Aptitude   also  maintain  a recent version of Ruby, and they’re likely to be the easiest avenue for getting a work- ing Ruby installation.    In addition to the Ruby interpreter, you need the Ruby package manager, Ruby- Gems, to install the MongoDB Ruby driver. Find out whether RubyGems is installed by running the gem command:   gem -v  A.8.2 Windows  You can install RubyGems through a package manager, but most users download the latest version and use the included installer. You can find instructions for doing this at https:  rubygems.org pages download.   By far, the easiest way to install Ruby and RubyGems on Windows is to use the Windows Ruby Installer. The installer can be found here: http:  rubyinstaller.org downloads. When you run the executable, a wizard will guide you through the installation of both Ruby and RubyGems.    In addition to installing Ruby, you can install the Ruby DevKit, which permits the easy compilation of Ruby C extensions. The MongoDB Ruby driver’s BSON library may optionally use these extensions.  www.it-ebooks.info   appendix B Design patterns  B.1  The early chapters of this book implicitly advocate a certain set of design patterns. Here I’ll summarize those patterns and augment them with a few patterns that fall outside the flow of the text.   Embed vs. reference Suppose you’re building a simple application in MongoDB that stores blog posts and comments. How do you represent this data? Do you embed the comments in their respective blog post documents? Or is it better to create two collections, one for posts and the other for comments, and then relate the comments to the posts with an object ID reference  _id ?   This is the problem of embedding versus referencing, and it’s a common source of confusion for new users of MongoDB. Fortunately, there’s a simple rule of thumb that works for most schema design scenarios: embed when the child objects never appear outside the context of their parent. Otherwise, store the child objects in a separate collection.    What does this mean for blog posts and comments? It depends on the applica- tion. If the comments always appear within a blog post, and if they don’t need to be ordered in arbitrary ways  by post date, comment rank, and so on , then embed- ding is fine. But if, say, you want to be able to display the most recent comments, regardless of which post they appear on, then you’ll want to reference. Embedding may provide a slight performance advantage, but referencing is far more flexible.   B.2  One-to-many As stated in the previous section, you can represent a one-to-many relationship by either  embedding  or  referencing.  You  should  embed  when  the  many  object intrinsically belongs with its parent and rarely changes. The schema for a how-to application illustrates this well. The steps in each guide can be represented as an  421  www.it-ebooks.info   422  APPENDIX B Design patterns  array  of  subdocuments  because  these  steps  are  an  intrinsic  part  of  the  guide  and rarely change:   { title: "How to soft-boil an egg",           steps: [           { desc: "Bring a pot of water to boil.",             materials: ["water", "eggs"] },           { desc: "Gently add the eggs a cook for four minutes.",             materials: ["egg timer"]},           { desc: "Cool the eggs under running water." },          ] }  Please note that if you want to guarantee the order of an array, you might need to add another  attribute  that  will  hold  the  order  of  the  array  elements,  because  some  lan- guages don’t guarantee the order of an array.   When the two related entities will appear independently in the application, you’ll want to relate them. Many articles on MongoDB suggest that embedding comments in blog posts is a good idea. But relating is far more flexible. For one thing, you can eas- ily  show  users  a  list  of  all  their  comments—using  sparse  indexes  might  help  here because  sparse  indexes  only  contain  entries  for  documents  that  have  the  indexed field. You can also show all recent comments across all posts. These features, consid- ered de rigueur for most sites, aren’t possible with embedded documents at this time.1 You typically relate documents using an object ID. Here’s a sample post:  { _id: ObjectId "4d650d4cf32639266022018d" ,   title: "Cultivating herbs",   text: "Herbs require occasional watering..." }  And here’s a comment, related by the post_id field:   { _id: ObjectId "4d650d4cf32639266022ac01" ,   post_id: ObjectId "4d650d4cf32639266022018d" ,   username: "zjones",   text: "Indeed, basil is a hearty herb!" }  The post and the comment live in their own collections, and it takes two queries to display  a  post  with  its  comments.  Because  you’ll  query  comments  on  their  post_id field, you’ll want an index there:   db.comments.createIndex {post_id: 1}   We used this one-to-many pattern extensively in chapters 4, 5, and 6; look there for more examples.   1 There’s a popular feature request for virtual collections, which could provide the best of both worlds. See  http:  jira.mongodb.org browse SERVER-142 to track this issue.  www.it-ebooks.info   Trees  423  B.3 Many-to-many  In RDBMSs, you use a join table to represent many-to-many relationships; in MongoDB, you use array keys. You can see a clear example of this technique earlier in the book where we relate products and categories. Each product contains an array of category IDs, and both products and categories get their own collections. If you have two sim- ple category documents  { _id: ObjectId "4d6574baa6b804ea563c132a" ,   title: "Epiphytes" } { _id: ObjectId "4d6574baa6b804ea563c459d" ,   title: "Greenhouse flowers" }  then a product belonging to both categories will look like this:   { _id: ObjectId "4d6574baa6b804ea563ca982" ,   name: "Dragon Orchid",   category_ids: [ ObjectId "4d6574baa6b804ea563c132a" ,                   ObjectId "4d6574baa6b804ea563c459d"  ] }  For efficient queries, you should index the array of category IDs:   db.products.createIndex {category_ids: 1}   Then, to find all products in the Epiphytes category, match against the category_id field:   db.products.find {category_id: ObjectId "4d6574baa6b804ea563c132a" }   And to return all category documents related to the Dragon Orchid product, first get the list of that product’s category IDs:   product = db.products.findOne {_id: ObjectId "4d6574baa6b804ea563c132a" }   Then query the categories collection using the $in operator:   db.categories.find {_id: {$in: product['category_ids']}}   You’ll  notice  that  finding  the  categories  requires  two  queries,  whereas  the  product search takes just one. This optimizes for the common case, as you’re more likely to search for products in a category than the other way around.   B.4  Trees Like MySQL, MongoDB has no built-in facility for tree representation and traversal— Oracle has CONNECT BY and PostgreSQL has WITH RECURSIVE for performing a tree tra- versal. Thus, if you need tree-like behavior in MongoDB, you’ve got to roll your own solution. I presented a solution to the category hierarchy problem in chapters 5 and 6.  www.it-ebooks.info   424  APPENDIX B Design patterns  The strategy there was to store a snapshot of the category’s ancestors within each cate- gory document. This denormalization makes updates more complicated but greatly simplifies reads.     Alas,  the  denormalized  ancestor  approach  isn’t  great  for  all  problems.  Another common  tree  scenario  is  the  online  forum,  where  hundreds  of  messages  are  fre- quently nested many levels deep. There’s too much nesting, and too much data, for the ancestor approach to work well here. A good alternative is the materialized path.     Following  the  materialized  path  pattern,  each  node  in  the  tree  contains  a  path field.  This  field  stores  the  concatenation  of  each  of  the  node’s  ancestor’s  IDs,  and root-level nodes have a null path because they have no ancestors. Let’s flesh out an example to see how this works. First, look at the comment thread in figure B.1. This represents a few questions and answers in thread about Greek history.  5 points by kbanker 1 hour ago  Who was Alexander the Great's teacher?  2 points by asophist 1 hour ago  It was definitely Socrates.  10 points by daletheia 1 hour ago  Oh you sophist...It was actually Aristotle!  1 point by seuclid 2 hours ago  So who really discarded the parallel postulate?  Figure B.1 Threaded  comments in a forum  Let’s see how these comments look as documents organized with a materialized path. The first is a root-level comment, so the path is null:   { _id: ObjectId "4d692b5d59e212384d95001" ,   depth: 0,   path: null,   created: ISODate "2011-02-26T17:18:01.251Z" ,   username: "plotinus",   body: "Who was Alexander the Great's teacher?",   thread_id: ObjectId "4d692b5d59e212384d95223a"  }  The other root-level question, the one by user seuclid, will have the same structure. More  illustrative  are  the  follow-up  comments  to  the  question  about  Alexander  the Great’s teacher. Examine the first of these, and note that path contains the _id of the immediate parent:   { _id: ObjectId "4d692b5d59e212384d951002" ,   depth: 1,   path: "4d692b5d59e212384d95001",  www.it-ebooks.info   Trees  425    created: ISODate "2011-02-26T17:21:01.251Z" ,   username: "asophist",   body: "It was definitely Socrates.",   thread_id: ObjectId "4d692b5d59e212384d95223a"  }  The next deeper comment’s path contains both the IDs of the original and immediate parents, in that order and separated by a colon:  { _id: ObjectId "4d692b5d59e212384d95003" ,   depth: 2,   path: "4d692b5d59e212384d95001:4d692b5d59e212384d951002",   created: ISODate "2011-02-26T17:21:01.251Z" ,   username: "daletheia",   body: "Oh you sophist...It was actually Aristotle!",   thread_id: ObjectId "4d692b5d59e212384d95223a"  }  At a minimum, you’ll want indexes on the thread_id and path fields, as you’ll always query on exactly one of these fields:   db.comments.createIndex {thread_id: 1}  db.comments.createIndex {path: 1}   Now the question is how you go about querying and displaying the tree. One of the advantages of the materialized path pattern is that you query the database only once, whether  you’re  displaying  the  entire  comment  thread  or  only  a  subtree  within  the thread. The query for the first of these is straightforward:   db.comments.find {thread_id: ObjectId "4d692b5d59e212384d95223a" }   The query for a particular subtree is subtler because it uses a prefix query  discussed in Chapter 5 :   db.comments.find {path:  ^4d692b5d59e212384d95001 }   This returns all comments with a path beginning with the specified string. This string represents the _id of the comment with the username plotinus, and if you examine the path field on each child comment, it’s easy to see that they’ll all satisfy the query. And they’ll do so quickly because these prefix queries can use the index on path.    Getting the list of comments is easy—it only requires one database query. Display- ing them is trickier because you need a list that preserves thread order. This requires a bit of client-side processing, which you can achieve with the following Ruby methods.2  2 This book’s source code includes a complete example of threaded comments with materialized paths using  the display methods presented here.  www.it-ebooks.info   426  APPENDIX B Design patterns  The first method, threaded_list, builds a list of all root-level comments and a map that keys parent IDs to lists of child nodes:   def threaded_list cursor, opts={}    list      = []   child_map = {}   start_depth = opts[:start_depth]  0   cursor.each do comment     if comment['depth'] == start_depth       list.push comment      else       matches = comment['path'].match   [dw]+ $         immediate_parent_id = matches[1]       if immediate_parent_id         child_map[immediate_parent_id] = []         child_map[immediate_parent_id] << comment       end     end   end   assemble list, child_map  end  def assemble comments, map    list = []   comments.each do comment     list.push comment      child_comments = map[comment['_id'].to_s]     if child_comments       list.concat assemble child_comments, map       end   end   list end  The assemble method takes the list of root nodes and the child map and then builds a new list in display order:   To print the comments, you merely iterate over the list, indenting appropriately for each comment’s depth:   def print_threaded_list cursor, opts={}    threaded_list cursor, opts .each do item     indent = "  " * item['depth']     puts indent + item['body'] + " {item['path']}"   end end  Querying for the comments and printing them is then straightforward:   cursor = @comments.find.sort "created"  print_threaded_list cursor   www.it-ebooks.info   B.5 Worker queues  Dynamic attributes  427  You can implement worker queues in MongoDB using either standard or capped col- lections  discussed in chapter 4 . In both cases, the findAndModify command will per- mit you to process queue entries atomically.    A queue entry requires a state and a timestamp plus any remaining fields to con- tain the payload. The state can be encoded as a string, but an integer is more space- efficient.  We’ll  use  0  and  1  to  indicate  processed  and  unprocessed,  respectively.  The timestamp is the standard BSON date. And the payload here is a simple plaintext mes- sage but could be anything in principle:   { state: 0,   created: ISODate "2011-02-24T16:29:36.697Z" ,   message: "hello world" }  You’ll need to declare an index that allows you to efficiently fetch the oldest unpro- cessed entry  FIFO . A compound index on state and created fits the bill:   db.queue.createIndex {state: 1, created: 1}   You then use findAndModify to return the next entry and mark it as processed:   q = {state: 0} s = {created: 1} u = {$set: {state: 1}} db.queue.findAndModify {query: q, sort: s, update: u}   If you’re using a standard collection, be sure to remove old queue entries. It’s possible to  remove  them  at  processing  time  using  findAndModify’s  {remove:  true}  option. But some applications may want to postpone removal for a later time, once the pro- cessing is complete.    Capped collections may also serve as the basis for a worker queue. Without the default  index  on  _id,  a  capped  collection  has  potentially  faster  insert  speed,  but the difference will be negligible for most applications. The other potential advantage is automatic deletion. But this feature is a double-edged sword: you’ll have to make sure  that  the  collection  is  large  enough  to  prevent  unprocessed  entries  from  aging out. Thus if you do use a capped collection, make it extra-large. The ideal collection size will depend on your queue write throughput and the average payload size.    Once you’ve decided on the size of capped collection to use, the schema, index, and findAndModify will be identical to those of the standard collection just described.  B.6  Dynamic attributes MongoDB’s document data model is useful for representing entities whose attributes vary. Products are the canonical example of this, and you saw some ways of modeling these  attributes  earlier  in  the  book.  One  viable  way  to  model  these  attributes  is  to  www.it-ebooks.info   428  APPENDIX B Design patterns  scope them to a subdocument. In a single products collection, you can then store dis- parate product types. You might store a set of headphones  { _id: ObjectId "4d669c225d3a52568ce07646"    sku: "ebd-123"   name: "Hi-Fi Earbuds",   type: "Headphone",   attrs: { color: "silver",            freq_low: 20,            freq_hi: 22000,            weight: 0.5          } }  and an SSD drive:  { _id: ObjectId "4d669c225d3a52568ce07646"    sku: "ssd-456"   name: "Mini SSD Drive",   type: "Hard Drive",   attrs: { interface: "SATA",            capacity: 1.2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024,            rotation: 7200,            form_factor: 2.5          } }  If you need to frequently query on these attributes, you can create sparse indexes for them. For example, you can optimize for range queries in headphone frequency response: db.products.createIndex {"attrs.freq_low": 1, "attrs.freq_hi": 1},   {sparse: true}   You can also efficiently search hard disks by rotation speed with the following index:  db.products.createIndex {"attrs.rotation": 1}, {sparse: true}   The overall strategy here is to scope your attributes for readability and app discover- ability and to use sparse indexes to keep null values out of the indexes.   If your attributes are completely unpredictable, you can’t build a separate index for each one. You have to use a different strategy—in this case, arrays of name-value pairs—as illustrated by the following sample document:   { _id: ObjectId "4d669c225d3a52568ce07646"    sku: "ebd-123"   name: "Hi-Fi Earbuds",   type: "Headphone",   attrs: [ {n: "color", v: "silver"},            {n: "freq_low", v: 20},            {n: "freq_hi", v: 22000},            {n: "weight", v: 0.5}          ] }  www.it-ebooks.info   B.7  Transactions  429  Here attrs points to an array of subdocuments. Each of these documents has two values,  n  and  v,  corresponding  to  each  dynamic  attribute’s  name  and  value.  This normalized representation allows you to index these attributes using a single com- pound index:   db.products.createIndex {"attrs.n": 1, "attrs.v": 1}   You can then query using these attributes, but to do that, you must use the $elem- Match query operator:   db.products.find {attrs: {$elemMatch: {n: "color", v: "silver"}}}   Note  that  this  strategy  incurs  a  lot  of  overhead  because  it  requires  storing  the  key names in the index. It’d be important to test this for performance on a representative data set before going into production.   Transactions MongoDB doesn’t provide ACID guarantees over a series of operations  however, indi- vidual  operations  are  atomic ,  and  no  equivalent  of  RDBMSs’  BEGIN,  COMMIT,  and ROLLBACK  semantics  exists.  When  you  need  these  features,  use  a  different  database  either for the data that needs proper transactions or for the application as a whole  or a different design like executing a series of operations one by one. Still MongoDB supports atomic, durable updates on individual documents and consistent reads, and these features, though primitive, can be used to implement transaction-like behavior in an application.    You saw an extended example of this in chapter 6’s treatments of order authoriza- tion  and  inventory  management.  And  the  worker  queue  implementation  earlier  in this appendix could easily be modified to support rollback. In both cases, the founda- tion for transaction-like behavior is the ever versatile findAndModify command, which is used to atomically manipulate a state field on one or more documents.   The transactional strategy used in all these cases can be described as compensation-  driven.3 The compensation process in abstract works like this:   1 Atomically modify a document’s state. 2 Perform some unit of work, which may include atomically modifying other doc-  uments.  3 Ensure that the system as a whole  all documents involved  is in a valid state. If so, mark the transaction complete; otherwise, revert each document to its pre- transaction state.  3 Two pieces of literature covering compensation-driven transactions are worth studying. The original is Garcia- Molina and Salem’s “Sagas” paper  http:  mng.bz 73is . The less formal but no less interesting “Your Coffee Shop Doesn’t Use Two-Phase Commit” by Gregor Hohpe  http:  mng.bz kpAq  is also a great read.  www.it-ebooks.info   430  APPENDIX B Design patterns  It’s worth noting that the compensation-driven strategy is all but necessary for long- running and multistep transactions. The whole process of authorizing, shipping, and canceling an order is one example. For these cases, even an RDBMS with full transac- tional semantics must implement a similar strategy.    There  may  be  no  getting  around  certain  applications’  requirements  for  multi- object ACID transactions. But with the right patterns, MongoDB can pull some transac- tional weight and might support the transactional semantic your application needs.   B.8  Locality and precomputation MongoDB is frequently billed as an analytics database, and plenty of users store analyt- ics data in MongoDB. A combination of atomic increments and rich documents seems to work best. For example, here’s a document representing total page views for each day of the month along with the total for the month as a whole. For brevity, the follow- ing document contains totals only for the first five days of the month:   { base: "org.mongodb", path: " ",   total: 99234,   days: {     "1": 4500,     "2": 4324,     "3": 2700,     "4": 2300,     "5": 0   } }  You can update the totals for the day and month with a simple targeted update using the $inc operator:   use stats-2011 db.sites-nov.update { base: "org.mongodb", path: " " },   $inc: {total: 1, "days.5": 1 } ;  Take a moment to notice the collection and database names. The collection, sites- nov, is scoped to a given month, and the database, stats-2011, to a particular year. This  gives  the  application  good  locality.  When  you  query  for  recent  visits,  you’re always  querying  a  single  collection  that’s  relatively  small  compared  with  the  overall analytics  history.  If  you  need  to  delete  data,  you  can  drop  a  time-scoped  collection rather than removing some subset of documents from a larger collection. That latter operation may result in on-disk fragmentation.    The other principle at work here is precomputation. Sometime near the beginning of the month, you insert a template document with zeroed values for each day of the month. As a result, the document will never change size as you increment the coun- ters therein because you’ll never actually add fields; you’ll only change their values in place. This is important because it keeps the document from being relocated on disk as you write to it. Relocation is slow and often results in fragmentation.   www.it-ebooks.info   Antipatterns  431  B.9  Antipatterns MongoDB lacks constraints, which can lead to poorly organized data. Here are a few issues commonly found in problematic production deployments.   B.9.1 Careless indexing  When users experience performance problems, it’s not unusual to discover a whole slew of unused or inefficient indexes. The most efficient set of indexes for an applica- tion will always be based on an analysis of the queries being run. Be disciplined about the optimization methods presented in chapter 7.   Keep in mind that when you have unnecessary indexes, inserts and updates will take longer because the related indexes have to be updated. As a rule of thumb, you should periodically reexamine your indexes to make sure that you’re using the right ones for the right job.  B.9.2 Motley types  Ensure that keys of the same name within a collection all share the same type. If you store a phone number, for instance, store it consistently, either as a string or an inte- ger  but not as both . The mixing of types in a single key’s value makes the applica- tion logic complex, and makes BSON documents difficult to parse in certain strongly typed languages.   B.9.3 Bucket collections  B.9.4  Collections should be used for one type of entity only; don’t put products and users in the same collection. Because collections are cheap, each type within your application should get its own collection. As a side effect, this also has huge concurrency gains.  Large, deeply nested documents There  are  two  misunderstandings  about  MongoDB’s  document  data  model.  One  is that you should never build relationships between collections, but rather represent all relationships  in  the  same  document.  This  frequently  degenerates  into  a  mess,  but users  nevertheless  sometimes  try  it.  The  second  misunderstanding  stems  from  an overly literal interpretation of the word document. A document, these users reason, is a single entity like a real-life document. This leads to large documents that are difficult to query and update, let alone comprehend.    The bottom line here is that you should keep documents small  well under 100 KB per  document  unless  you’re  storing  raw  binary  data   and  that  you  shouldn’t  nest more than a few levels deep. A smaller size makes document updates cheaper because in the case where a document needs to be rewritten on disk completely, there’s less to rewrite.  The  other  advantage  is  that  the  documents  remain  comprehensible,  which makes life easier for developers needing to understand the data model.   It’s also a good practice to put raw binary data into a separate collection and refer-  ence it by _id. Appendix C will help you deal with binary data.  www.it-ebooks.info   432  APPENDIX B Design patterns  B.9.5 One collection per user  It’s rarely a good idea to build out one collection per user. One problem with this is that  the  namespaces   indexes  plus  collections   max  out  at  24,000  by  default.  Once you grow beyond that, you have to allocate a new database. In addition, each collec- tion and its indexes introduce extra overhead, making this strategy a waste of space.  B.9.6 Unshardable collections  If you expect a collection to grow large enough to merit sharding, be sure that you can eventually shard it. A collection is shardable if you can define an efficient shard key for that collection. Review the tips in chapter 12 on choosing a shard key.  www.it-ebooks.info   appendix C Binary data and GridFS  For  storing  images,  thumbnails,  audio,  and  other  binary  files,  many  applications rely on the filesystem only. Although filesystems provide fast access to files, filesys- tem storage can also lead to organizational chaos. Consider that most filesystems limit the number of files per directory. If you have millions of files to keep track of, you need to devise a strategy for organizing files into multiple directories. Another difficulty involves metadata. Because the file metadata is still stored in a database, performing an accurate backup of the files and their metadata can be incredibly complicated.    For  certain  use  cases,  it  may  make  sense  to  store  files  in  the  database  itself because doing so simplifies file organization and backup. In MongoDB, you can use the BSON binary type to store any kind of binary data. This data type corresponds to  the  RDBMS  BLOB   binary  large  object   type,  and  it’s  the  basis  for  two  flavors  of binary object storage provided by MongoDB.   The first uses one document per file and is best for smaller binary objects. If you need to catalog a large number of thumbnails or binary MD5s, using single-document binary storage can make life much easier. On the other hand, you might want to store large images or audio files. In this case, GridFS, a MongoDB API for storing binary objects of any size, would be a better choice. In the next two sections, you’ll see complete examples of both storage techniques.  C.1  Simple binary storage BSON includes a first-class type for binary data. You can use this type to store binary objects  directly  inside  MongoDB  documents.  The  only  limit  on  object  size  is  the document size limit itself, which is 16 MB since MongoDB v2.0. Because large docu- ments like this can tax system resources, you’re encouraged to use GridFS for any binary objects you want to store that are larger than 1 MB.  433  www.it-ebooks.info   434  APPENDIX C Binary data and GridFS    We’ll  look  at  two  reasonable  uses  of  binary  object  storage  in  single  documents. First, you’ll see how to store an image thumbnail. Then, you’ll see how to store the accompanying MD5.  C.1.1  Storing a thumbnail  Imagine you need to store a collection of image thumbnails. The code is straightfor- ward. First, you get the image’s filename, canyon-thumb.jpg, and then read the data into a local variable. Next, you wrap the raw binary data as a BSON binary object using the Ruby driver’s BSON::Binary constructor:  require 'rubygems' require 'mongo' image_filename = File.join File.dirname __FILE__ , "canyon-thumb.jpg"  image_data = File.open image_filename .read bson_image_data = BSON::Binary.new image_data   All that remains is to build a simple document to contain the binary data and then insert it into the database:  doc = {"name" => "monument-thumb.jpg",        "data" => bson_image_data } @con = Mongo::Client.new [‘localhost:27017’], :database => ‘images’  @thumbnails = @con[:thumbnails] result = @thumbnails.insert_one doc   To extract the binary data, fetch the document. In Ruby, the to_s method unpacks the data into a binary string, and you can use this to compare the saved data to the original:  @thumbnails.find {“name” => “monument-thumb-jpg”} .each do doc   if image_data == doc["data"].to_s     puts "Stored image is equal to the original file!"   end end  If you run the preceding script, you’ll see a message indicating that the two files are indeed the same.  C.1.2  Storing an MD5  It’s common to store a checksum as binary data, and this marks another potential use of the BSON binary type. Here’s how you can generate an MD5 of the thumbnail and add it to the document just stored:  require 'md5' md5 = Digest::MD5.file image_filename .digest bson_md5 = BSON::Binary.new md5, :md5  @thumbnails.update_one {:_id => @image_id}, {"$set" => {:md5 => bson_md5}}   www.it-ebooks.info   GridFS  435  Note that when creating the BSON binary object, you tag the data with :md5. The sub- type is an extra field on the BSON binary type that indicates what kind of binary data is being  stored.  This  field  is  entirely  optional,  though,  and  has  no  effect  on  how  the database stores or interprets the data.1   It’s easy to query for the document just stored, but do notice that you exclude the  data field to keep the return document small and readable:  > use images > db.thumbnails.findOne {}, {data: 0}  {   "_id" : ObjectId "4d608614238d3b4ade000001" ,   "md5" : BinData 5,"K1ud3EUjT49wdMdkOGjbDg==" ,   "name" : "monument-thumb.jpg" }  C.2  See that the MD5 field is clearly marked as binary data  briefly mentioned in Table 5.6  with the subtype and raw payload. Keep in mind that MongoDB sorts BinData first by the length or size of the data, second by the BSON one-byte subtype, and last by the data, performing a byte-by-byte comparison.  GridFS GridFS is a convention for storing files of arbitrary size in MongoDB. The GridFS spec- ification is implemented by all the official drivers and by MongoDB’s mongofiles tool, ensuring consistent access across platforms. GridFS is useful for storing large binary objects in the database. It’s frequently fast enough to serve these objects as well, and the storage method is conducive to streaming.    The  term  GridFS  may  lead  to  confusion,  so  two  clarifications  are  worth  making right off the bat. The first is that GridFS isn’t an intrinsic feature of MongoDB. As men- tioned,  it’s  a  convention  that  all  the  official  drivers   and  some  tools   use  to  manage large  binary  objects  in  the  database.  Second,  it’s  important  to  clarify  that  GridFS doesn’t have the rich semantics of bona fide filesystems. For instance, there’s no pro- tocol for locking and concurrency, and this limits the GridFS interface to simple put, get, and delete operations. This means that if you want to update a file, you need to delete it and then put the new version.   GridFS works by dividing a large file into small, 255 KB chunks and then storing each chunk as a separate document—versions prior to MongoDB v2.4.10 use 256 KB chunks. By default, these chunks are stored in a collection called fs.chunks. Once the chunks are written, the file’s metadata is stored in a single document in another collection  called  fs.files.  Figure  C.1  contains  a  simplistic  illustration  of  this  1 This wasn’t always technically true. The deprecated default subtype of 2 indicated that the attached binary data also included four extra bytes to indicate the size, and this did affect a few database commands. The cur- rent default subtype is 0, and all subtypes now store the binary payload the same way. Subtype can therefore be seen as a kind of lightweight tag to be optionally used by application developers.  www.it-ebooks.info   436  APPENDIX C Binary data and GridFS  canyon.jpg 1MB  GridFSput  GridFS Interface   e.g., driver or mongoﬁles   Divide into chunks  Write ﬁle metadata  1. Write to chunks collection  fs.chunks   { ﬁles_id: 5, n: 0, data: BinData 0, " 256KB binary data " }  { ﬁles_id: 5, n: 1, data: BinData 0, " 256KB binary data " }  { ﬁles_id: 5, n: 2, data: BinData 0, " 256KB binary data " }  { ﬁles_id: 5, n: 3, data: BinData 0, " 256KB binary data " }  2. Write to ﬁles collection  fs.ﬁles   { _id: 5, ﬁlename: "canyon.jpg" }  Figure C.1 Storing a file with GridFS using 256 KB chunks on a MongoDB server prior to v2.4.10  process applied to a theoretical 1 MB file called canyon.jpg. Note that the use of the term chunks in the context of GridFS isn’t related to the use of the term chunks in the context of sharding.   That should be enough theory to use GridFS.2 Next we’ll see GridFS in practice  through the Ruby GridFS API and the mongofiles utility.  C.2.1 GridFS in Ruby  Earlier you stored a small image thumbnail. The thumbnail took up only 10 KB and was thus ideal for keeping in a single document. The original image is almost 2 MB in size, and is therefore much more appropriate for GridFS storage. Here you’ll store the original using Ruby’s GridFS API. First, you connect to the database and then ini- tialize a Grid object, which takes a reference to the database where the GridFS file will be stored.   Next, you open the original image file, canyon.jpg, for reading. The most basic GridFS interface uses methods to put and get a file. Here you use the Gridput method, which takes either a string of binary data or an IO object, such as a file pointer. You pass in the file pointer and the data is written to the database.   2 You  can  find  more  information  about  GridFS  at  http:  docs.mongodb.org manual core gridfs   and  at  http:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference gridfs .  www.it-ebooks.info   GridFS  437   The method returns the file’s unique object  ID using the latest Ruby MongoDB  driver:  require 'rubygems' require 'mongo' include Mongo $client = Mongo::Client.new [ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'images'  fs = $client.database.fs $file = File.open "canyon.jpg"  $file_id = fs.upload_from_stream "canyon.jpg", $file  $file.close  As stated, GridFS uses two collections for storing file data. The first, normally called fs.files, keeps each file’s metadata. The second collection, fs.chunks, stores one or more chunks of binary data for each file. Let’s briefly examine these from the shell.   Switch to the images database, and query for the first entry in the fs.files collec-  tion. You’ll see the metadata for the file you just stored:  > use images > db.fs.files.find {filename: "canyon.jpg"} .pretty   {   "_id" : ObjectId "5612e19a530a6919ed000001" ,   "chunkSize" : 261120,   "uploadDate" : ISODate "2015-10-05T20:46:18.849Z" ,   "contentType" : "binary octet-stream",   "filename" : "canyon.jpg",   "length" : 281,   "md5" : "597d619c415a4db144732aed24b6ff0b" }  These  are  the  minimum  required  attributes  for  every  GridFS  file.  Most  are  self- explanatory.  You  can  see  that  this  file  is  about  2  MB  and  is  divided  into  chunks 256 KB in size, which means that it was from a MongoDB server prior to v2.4.10. You’ll also notice an MD5. The GridFS spec requires a checksum to ensure that the stored file is the same as the original.   Each chunk stores the object ID of its file in a field called files_id. Thus you can  easily count the number of chunks this file uses:  > db.fs.chunks.count {"files_id" : ObjectId "4d606588238d3b4471000001" }  8  Given the chunk size and the total file size, eight chunks are exactly what you should expect. The contents of the chunks themselves are easy to see, too. As earlier, you’ll want to exclude the data to keep the output readable. This query returns the first of the eight chunks, as indicated by the value of n:  > db.fs.chunks.findOne {files_id: ObjectId "4d606588238d3b4471000001" },           {data: 0}  {   "_id" : ObjectId "4d606588238d3b4471000002" ,  www.it-ebooks.info   438  APPENDIX C Binary data and GridFS    "n" : 0,   "files_id" : ObjectId "4d606588238d3b4471000001"  }  Reading GridFS files is as easy as writing them. In the following example, you create a text file on-the-fly, give it a name, and store it using GridFS. You then find it in the database  using  a  find_one    statement  that  returns  a  Mongo::Grid::File  object. Then  you  have  to  get  the  file  ID  from  the  Mongo::Grid::File  object  to  use  it  and retrieve the text file from the database, which is saved using the perfectCopy filename:  require 'rubygems' require 'mongo' include Mongo  $client = Mongo::Client.new [ '127.0.0.1:27017' ], :database => 'garden'  fs = $client.database.fs    To create a text file with raw data file = Mongo::Grid::File.new 'I am a NEW file', :filename => 'aFile.txt'  $client.database.fs.insert_one file    Select the file from scratch $fileObj = $client.database.fs.find_one :filename => 'aFile.txt'   $file_id = $fileObj.id   And download it $file_to_write = File.open 'perfectCopy', 'w'  fs.download_to_stream $file_id, $file_to_write   You can then verify for yourself that perfectCopy is a text file with the correct data in it:  $ cat perfectCopy I am a NEW filei  That’s the basics of reading and writing GridFS files from a driver. The various GridFS APIs vary slightly, but with the foregoing examples and the basic knowledge of how GridFS works, you should have no trouble making sense of your driver’s docs. At the time of writing, the latest Ruby MongoDB Driver is v2.1.1.  C.2.2 GridFS with mongofiles  The MongoDB distribution includes a handy utility called mongofiles for listing, put- ting, getting, and deleting GridFS files using the command line. For example, you can list the GridFS files in the images database:  $ mongofiles -d images list connected to: 127.0.0.1 canyon.jpg  2004828  www.it-ebooks.info   GridFS  439  You can also easily add files. Here’s how you can add the copy of the image that you wrote with the Ruby script:  $ mongofiles -d images put canyon-copy.jpg connected to: 127.0.0.1 added file: { _id: ObjectId '4d61783326758d4e6727228f' ,                filename: "canyon-copy.jpg",               chunkSize: 262144, uploadDate: new Date 1298233395296 ,               md5: "9725ad463b646ccbd287be87cb9b1f6e", length: 2004828 }  You can again list the files to verify that the copy was written:  $ mongofiles -d images list connected to: 127.0.0.1 canyon.jpg  2004828 canyon-copy.jpg  2004828  mongofiles supports a number of options, and you can view them with the  --help parameter:  $ mongofiles --help  Usage:   mongofiles        Manipulate gridfs files using the command line.  Possible commands include:     list      - list all files; 'filename' is an optional prefix which listed                 filenames must begin with     search    - search all files; 'filename' is a substring which listed                 filenames must contain     put       - add a file with filename 'filename'     get       - get a file with filename 'filename'     get_id    - get a file with the given '_id'     delete    - delete all files with filename 'filename'     delete_id - delete a file with the given '_id'  See http:  docs.mongodb.org manual reference program mongofiles  for more   information.  general options:       --help                     print usage       --version                  print the tool version and exit  verbosity options:   -v, --verbose      more detailed log output  include multiple times for more                      verbosity, e.g. -vvvvv        --quiet        hide all log output  connection options:   -h, --host=         mongodb host to connect to  setname host1,host2 for                       replica sets        --port=         server port  can also use --host hostname:port   authentication options:   -u, --username=                username for authentication   -p, --password=                password for authentication  www.it-ebooks.info   440  APPENDIX C Binary data and GridFS        --authenticationDatabase=  database that holds the user's credentials       --authenticationMechanism= authentication mechanism to use  storage options:   -d, --db=                      database to use  default is 'test'    -l, --local=                   local filename for putget   -t, --type=                    content MIME type for put  optional    -r, --replace                  remove other files with same name after put       --prefix=                  GridFS prefix to use  default is 'fs'        --writeConcern=    write concern options e.g. --writeConcern majority,                          --writeConcern '{w: 3, wtimeout: 500, fsync: true, j:                          true}'  defaults to 'majority'   www.it-ebooks.info   index  Symbols  .  dot operator , with queries  108–109  . character 88, 93 @tweets variable 67 $** field 257 $ character 57, 93, 193 => character 55 > character 32  Numerics  -9 command-line option 387 10gen, subscription services 5–6 32-bit integer type 116 64-bit integer type 116  A  ad hoc queries 10 $add function 142 additionalOptions object 147 address already in use  error message   418  address_length field 112 addshard command 371 addShard   method 346 add_to_cart function 168–169, 175–177 $addToSet operator 137–138, 159–160,   180, 185, 193  administrative tasks 402–405  compaction and repair 403–405 data imports and exports 402–403 upgrading 405  aggregate   function 147, 252, 267  aggregation framework  operators  $sort 138 $unwind 139  overview 121 pipeline performance 146  aggregation cursor option 151 allowDiskUse option 151 explain    function 147 options 147  reshaping documents 140 arithmetic functions 142 date functions 142 logical functions 143 miscellaneous functions 145 set operators 144 string functions 141  See also e-commerce aggregation example  agile development 22–23 AGPL  GNU-Affero General Public   License  15  $all operator 105–106 $allElementsTrue function 144 allowDiskUse option 147, 151 allPlans key 240 allPlansExecution mode 238 Amazon EC2 336 analytics 22–23 ancestor_list array 164 ancestors attribute 164 $and operator 106–107, 143 antipatterns 431–432  bucket collections 431 careless indexing 431 large, deeply nested documents 431 motley types 431  441  www.it-ebooks.info   442  INDEX  finishing order 173–174 preparing order for checkout 172–173 verifying order and authorization 173  C  antipatterns  continued   one collection per user 432 unshardable collections 432 $anyElementTrue function 144 Apache license 17 AppEngine 5 application data, storage of 337–338 arbiterOnly option 302, 316–317 arbiters 300 architecture  hardware 379–380 installation problems and 417  ArchLinux 413 arithmetic functions 142 Array type 116 arrays 110–112  querying for, by size 112 update operators for 183–187  atime, disabling 382 atomic document processing 171–179  inventory management 174–179  failure 178–179 inventory fetcher 175–176 inventory management 176–178  order state transitions 172–174  attributes, dynamic 427–429 authentication 397–400  basic, setting up 399–400 removing user 400 service authentication 398 user authentication 398–399  authors field 254 average product ratings 162–163 average review, calculating 126 $avg function 127, 137  B  background indexing 215 backups 391–393  data file-based backups 392–393 for sharded clusters 373 indexes 216 MMS backups 393 mongodump and mongorestore 391–392  balancer 373 BasicCursor 223, 240 Bayer, Rudolf 292 binary data, simple binary storage 433–435  storing an MD5 434–435 storing thumbnails 434  Binary JSON.
