He has been developing applications with PHP since  2005. He administers the Turkish national support site of the world famous open  source content management script, PHP-Fusion. He's also one of the international  developers and a member of the management team of CMS, and he plays an  important role in CMS's future. He has worked as a developer and has experience on  projects such as Begendy  an exclusive private shopping website  and Futbolkurdu   a local soccer news website . He has experience working with the Facebook API, the  Twitter API, and PayPal's Adaptive Payment API  used on crowdfunding websites  such as KickStarter . He's also experienced with JavaScript, and he's infusing his  applications with JavaScript and jQuery, both on frontend and backend sides.  He has developed applications using CodeIgniter and CakePHP for about 4 years,  but these PHP frameworks didn't suit his needs completely, and that's why he  decided to use another framework for his projects. After getting introduced to  Laravel, he has developed all his applications with it.  He's also interested in Unix and Linux, and he uses Linux on a daily basis. He's  administering the world's best-known microcomputer, Raspberry Pi's biggest  Turkish community website, Raspberry Pi Türkiye Topluluğu  Raspberry Pi   Turkish Community Website .  Before authoring this book, Arda has written two other books. The first book   is Laravel Application Development Blueprints, Packt Publishing, coauthored by   H. İbrahim YILMAZ. The second book, Raspberry Pi, Dikeyeksen Consulting &  Publishing, is written in Turkish.   H. İbrahim YILMAZ is a daddy, developer, geek, and an e-commerce consultant  from Turkey. After his education at Münster University, Germany, he worked as a  developer and software coordinator in over a dozen ventures. During this period,  he developed the usage of APIs such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,  Grooveshark, and PayPal.  Currently, he's focused on creating his company about concurrent computing,  Big Data, and game programming. He writes articles on Erlang, Riak, functional  programming, and Big Data on his personal blog at http:  blog.drlinux.org.

It will walk you through the widely used design  patterns—the Builder  Manager  pattern, the Factory pattern, the Repository pattern,  and the Strategy pattern—and will empower you to use these patterns while  developing various applications with Laravel. This book will help you find stable  and acceptable solutions, thereby improving the quality of your applications.  Throughout the course of the book, you will be introduced to a number of clear,  practical examples about PHP design patterns and their usage in various projects.  You will also get acquainted with the best practices for Laravel, which will greatly  reduce the probability of introducing errors into your web applications.  By the end of this book, you will be accustomed with Laravel best practices and the  important design patterns to make a great website.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Design and Architectural Pattern Fundamentals, explains design and  architectural pattern terms and explains the classification of these design patterns  and their elements. This chapter provides some examples from the Laravel core code,  which contains the design patterns used in the framework. At end of this chapter, the  Mode-View-Controller  MVC  architectural pattern and its benefits will be explained. Chapter 2, Models in MVC, covers the function of the Model layer in the MVC  architectural pattern, its structure, its purpose, its role in the SOLID design pattern,  how Laravel uses it, and the advantages of Laravel's Model layers and Eloquent  ORM. Laravel classes that handle data are also discussed.   Chapter 3, Views in MVC, covers the function of the View layer in the MVC  architectural pattern, its structure, its purpose, and the advantages of Laravel's View  layer and Blade template engine. The role of View in the MVC pattern and Laravel's  approach to that is also covered. Chapter 4, Controllers in MVC, covers the function of the Controller layer in the MVC  architectural pattern, its structure, its purpose, and its usage in Laravel's structure. Chapter 5, Design Patterns in Laravel, discusses the design patterns used in Laravel.  We will also see how and why they are used, with examples. Chapter 6, Best Practices in Laravel, will cover basic and advanced practices in Laravel,  examples of design patterns used in Laravel that we were described in previous  chapters, and the reasons these patterns are used.

[ 4 ]   Design and Architectural  Pattern Fundamentals  Programming is actually a lifestyle rather than a job. It's an intense mental activity.  The best developers in the world think about their work 24 7. They come up with  their best ideas when they are not at their work desks. Generally, their finest work   is done away from the keyboard.  As developers need to look at problems from a different standpoint, software projects  cannot be accelerated by spending more time in the office or adding more people  to a project. Development is not just about timelines and assigned tasks. If you visit  the development centers of world-famous software companies such as Google and  IBM, you'll see that there are many opportunities for spending time away from the  keyboard for developers. Programming questions have to be thought of in the context  of the real world. So, object-oriented programming was invented to make writing  software more instinctive for our hunter-gatherer brains; that is, software components  took on the properties and behavior of objects in the real world. When looking for  a solution to a problem or a way to accomplish what we want, we generally hope  to find a way that is reusable, optimized, and cheap. We, as developers, have a few  standard ways of approaching some commonly recurring problems in programming,  which are called design patterns. When you come across certain problems that recur, you try and find solutions to  solve them that can be used by anyone and everyone. This concept is prevalent  everywhere – mechanics, architecture, and even human behavior for that matter.  Programming is absolutely not an exception.   Programming solutions depend on the needs of the problems and are modified  accordingly because each problem has its own unique conditions. Commonly  recurring problems exist in both real life and programming life. So, design patterns  are given to us to implement our project. These patterns have already been tested  and used by many other developers for solving similar problems successfully.  Using design patterns also makes it possible to work with clean, standardized,  and readable code. Deciding to write a program that does X but using pattern Y  is a recipe for disaster. It might work for programs such as hello world, fit for  demonstrating the code constructs for patterns, but not much else.  Through patterns, we could also find a way to work around the inefficiencies that a  language may have. Also, a thing to note here, inefficiency is usually associated with  negativity, but it may not necessarily be bad at all times.  In this book, we'll cover PHP design patterns with the Laravel PHP Framework. In the  first few chapters, we'll also give examples from the Laravel core code. In the chapters  that follow, we'll cover the MVC pattern fundamentals. Then we'll try to examine  the differences between an MVC pattern approach to Laravel and a common MVC  approach. We hope this book will help you increase your code quality.  Please note that finding the best stable, high-quality solution directly depends on  your knowledge of the platform and language. We highly recommend that you be  well-versed with the data types and fundamentals of object-oriented programming  in PHP and Laravel Framework.  In this chapter, we'll explain design pattern terms and learn about the classification of  these design patterns and their elements. We'll give some examples from the Laravel  core code, which contains the design patterns used in the framework. Finally, we'll  explain the Mode-View-Controller  MVC  architectural pattern and its benefits.  Design patterns Design patterns were first introduced by Eric Gamma and his three friends in 1994.  A design pattern is basically a pattern of software design that is implemented on  multiple projects, and its intended success gives an idea to prove this pattern as a  solution of commonly recurring problems.  Design patterns are ways to solve a problem and the way to get your intended result  in the best possible manner. So, design patterns are not only ways to create a large  and robust system, but they also provide great architectures in a friendly manner.  [ 6 ]   In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable and optimized  solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.  It is a description or template for how to solve a problem, and the solution can be used  in different instances. The following are some of the benefits of using design patterns:     Maintenance    Documentation    Readability    Ease in finding appropriate objects    Ease in determining object granularity    Ease in specifying object interfaces    Ease in implementing even for large software projects     Implements the code reusability concept  If you are not familiar with design patterns, the best way to begin understanding is  observing the solutions we use for commonly occurring, everyday life problems.  Let's take a look at the following image:  [ 7 ]   Many different types of power plugs exist in the world. So, we need a solution that is  reusable, optimized, and cheaper than buying a new device for different power plug  types. In simple words, we need an adapter. Have a look at the following image of  an adapter:  In this case, an adapter is the best solution that's reusable, optimized, and cheap.   But an adapter does not provide us with a solution when our car's wheel blows out.  In object-oriented languages, we the programmers use the objects to do whatever  we want to have the outcome we desire. Hence, we have many types of objects,  situations, and problems. That means we need more than just one approach to  solving different kinds of problems.  Elements of design patterns The following are the elements of design patterns:     Name: This is a handle we can use to describe the problem    Problem: This describes when to apply the pattern    Solution: This describes the elements, relationships, responsibilities, and   collaborations, in a way that we follow to solve a problem     Consequences: This details the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern  [ 8 ]   Classification of design patterns Design patterns are generally divided into three fundamental groups:     Creational patterns    Structural patterns    Behavioral patterns  Let's examine these in the following subsections.  Creational patterns Creational patterns are a subset of design patterns in the field of software  development; they serve to create objects. They decouple the design of an object  from its representation. Object creation is encapsulated and outsourced  for example,  in a factory  to keep the context of object creation independent from concrete  implementation. This is in accordance with the rule: "Program on the interface,   not the implementation."  Some of the features of creational patterns are as follows:     Generic instantiation: This allows objects to be created in a system    without having to identify a specific class type in code  Abstract Factory   and Factory pattern      Simplicity: Some of the patterns make object creation easier, so callers    will not have to write large, complex code to instantiate an object    Builder  Manager  and Prototype pattern      Creation constraints: Creational patterns can put bounds on who can create   objects, how they are created, and when they are created  The following patterns are called creational patterns:     The Abstract Factory pattern    The Factory pattern    The Builder  Manager  pattern    The Prototype pattern    The Singleton pattern  Structural patterns In software engineering, design patterns structure patterns facilitate easy ways for  communications between various entities.  [ 9 ]   Some of the examples of structures of the samples are as follows:     Composition: This composes objects into a tree structure  whole hierarchies .  Composition allows customers to be uniformly treated as individual objects  according to their composition.     Decorator: This dynamically adds options to an object. A Decorator is a   flexible alternative embodiment to extend functionality.     Flies: This is a share of small objects  objects without conditions  that    prevent overproduction.     Adapter: This converts the interface of a class into another interface that the  clients expect. Adapter lets those classes work together that would normally  not be able to because of the different interfaces.     Facade: This provides a unified interface meeting the various interfaces of a  subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface to the subsystem, which is  easier to use.     Proxy: This implements the replacement  surrogate  of another object that   controls access to the original object.     Bridge: This separates an abstraction from its implementation, which can   then be independently altered.  Behavioral patterns Behavioral patterns are all about a class' objects' communication. Behavioral patterns  are those patterns that are most specifically concerned with communication between  objects. The following is a list of the behavioral patterns:     Chain of Responsibility pattern    Command pattern Interpreter pattern       Iterator pattern    Mediator pattern    Memento pattern    Observer pattern    State pattern    Strategy pattern    Template pattern    Visitor pattern  [ 10 ]   We'll cover these patterns in the following chapters. If you want to check out the  usage of some patterns in the Laravel core, have a look at the following list:     The Builder  Manager  pattern: Illuminate\Auth\AuthManager and   Illuminate\Session\SessionManager     The Factory pattern: Illuminate\Database\DatabaseManager and   Illuminate\Validation\Factory     The Repository pattern: Illuminate\Config\Repository and   Illuminate\Cache\Repository     The Strategy pattern: IIlluminate\Cache\StoreInterface and   Illuminate\Config\LoaderInterface     The Provider pattern: IIlluminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider and   Illuminate\Hash\HashServiceProvider  What is MVC? The MVC triad of classes were used to build user interfaces in Smalltalk-80 in  1988. MVC is an architectural pattern that is used in software engineering, whose  fundamental principle is based on the idea that the logic of an application should  be separated from its presentation. It divides a given software application into three  interconnected parts, so as to separate internal representations of information from  the way that information is presented to or accepted from the user. Refer to the  following figure:  MODEL  UPDATES  MANIPULATES  VIEW  CONTROLLER  S  E  E  S  USES  USER  [ 11 ]   In the preceding figure, you'll see the elements of MVC. It shows the general  life cycle on an MVC-based application of a request. As you can see, using an  MVC architectural pattern in projects allows you to separate different layers of  applications, such as the database layer and the UI layer.  The benefits of using the MVC pattern are as follows:     Different views and controllers can be substituted to provide alternate user   interfaces for the same model. It provides multiple simultaneous views of the same model.        The change propagation mechanism ensures that all views simultaneously   reflect the current state of the model.     Changes affecting just the user interface of the application become easier    to make.    It is easier to test the core of the application, as it is encapsulated by the model.    One of the great benefits of the MVC pattern is that it allows you to recycle  the application's logic when you use different templates. For example, when  you want to implement an external API inside a part of your application, it  will be very helpful to reuse the application's logic. If the MVC approach of  Laravel is followed thoroughly, you will only need to modify the controller  to render many different templates views.  Summary In this chapter, we have explained the fundamentals of design patterns. We've also  introduced some design patterns that are used in the Laravel Framework. Finally,   we explained the MVC architectural pattern concepts and its benefits.  In the next chapter, we'll cover the MVC concept in depth and its usage in Laravel.  Before moving on to learn about design patterns and their usage in Laravel with the  actual code, the most important thing is understanding the framework's approach to  the MVC concept.  [ 12 ]   Models in MVC  Throughout the chapter, we will be discussing what Model is in the MVC structure,  what its purpose is, what its role is in the SOLID design pattern, how Laravel defines  it, and the advantages of Laravel's Model layers and Eloquent ORM. We will also  discuss Laravel's classes related to handling data.  The following is the list of topics that will be covered in this chapter:     The meaning of the Model    The roles of the Model in a solid MVC design pattern    The Model and Model Instances    How Laravel defines the Model    The database-related classes of Laravel  What is a Model? The Model is that part of the Model-View-Controller design pattern that we can  simply describe as the layer of the design pattern that handles the management of  the data, which is received from the corresponding layers and then sent back to those  layers. One thing to note here is that the Model does not know where the data comes  from and how it is received.   In simple words, we can say that the Model implements the business logic of the  application. The Model is responsible for fetching the data and converting it into  more meaningful data that can be managed by other layers of the application and  sending it back to corresponding layers. The Model is another name for the domain  layer or business layer of an application.  Datebase  Model  Interaction with  Data Model  Controller  Purposes of the Model The Model in an application manages all of the dynamic data  anything that's not  hardcoded and comes from a database driver  and lets other related components of  the application know about the changes. For example, let's say that there is a news  article in your database. If you alter it from the database manually, when a route is  called—and due to this request—the Controller requests for the data over the Model  after the request from the Routing handler, and the Controller receives the updated  data from the Model. As a result, it sends this updated data to the View, and the end  user sees the changes from the response. All of these data-related interactions are  the tasks of the Model. This "data" that the Model handles does not always have to  be database related. In some implementations, the Model can also be used to handle  some temporary session variables.  The basic purposes of the Model in a general MVC pattern are as follows:     To fetch the data using a specified  database  driver    To validate the data    To store the data    To update the data  [ 14 ]      To delete the data    To create conditional relations    To monitor the file I O    To interact with third-party web services    To handle caches and sessions  As you can see, if you follow with an MVC pattern consistently, the Model covers a  huge percentage of the application's logic. In modern frameworks, there is a common  mistake about the Model that is made by users when learning design patterns. They  usually confuse the Model with Model Instances. Although they are quite similar,  they have different meanings.  Model instances In your application, there will usually be more than one data structure to manage.  For example, let's say you are running a blog. In a simple blog system, there are  authors, blog posts, tags, and comments. Let's say you want to update a blog post;  how do you define that the data you want to update is for the blog posts? This is  where Model Instances come handy.  Model Instances are simple classes that mostly extend from the Model layer of  the application. These instances separate the data logic for each section of your  application. In our example, we have four sections to handle  users, posts, tags, and  comments . If we are going to handle these using the Model, we have to create at  least four instances  we will cover why it is at least four and not exactly four in the  Relationships section that is under Eloquent ORM in this chapter .  Datebase  Model  Interaction with  Data Model  Extends fro m m odel  Model Object  Controller  [ 15 ]   As you can see from the diagram, the Controller interacts with the Model Instance to  fetch data. Since Model Instances extend from the Model itself, instead of raw Model  output, the Controller can customize it or add other layers  such as Validation  to   the process.  Let's say you want to fetch the user who has the username George. If no Validation  layer has been added from the Model Instance to the database, the username  parameter will go to the database directly, which could be harmful. If you did add a  validation layer on your Model Instance  which checks if the username parameter is  a clean string , even if the parameter was SQL injection code, it would first be filtered  by the validation layer instead of going to the database directly and then be detected  as harmful code. Then, the Model Instance will return a message or an exception to the  Controller that the parameter is invalid. Then, the Controller will send a corresponding  message to the View, and from there, the message will be shown to the end user. In  this process, optionally, the application might even fire an Event to log this attempt.  The Model in Laravel If you recall, we mentioned earlier in this chapter that there are many important jobs  that the Model needs to handle. Laravel 4 does not use the MVC pattern directly,   but it extends the pattern further. For example, Validation—which is part of the  Model in the solid MVC pattern—has its own class, but it's not part of the Model  itself. The database connection layer has its own classes for each database driver,   but they are not packed in the Model directly. This brings testability, modularity,  and extensibility to the Models.  The Laravel Model structure focuses more on the database processes directly, and   it is separated from other purposes. The other purposes are categorized as Facades.  To access the database, Laravel has two classes. The first one is Fluent Query Builder  and the second one is Eloquent ORM.  Fluent Query Builder Fluent is the query builder class of Laravel 4. Fluent Query Builder handles base  database query actions using PHP Data Objects in the backend, and it can be used  with almost any database driver. Let's say that you need to change the database  driver from SQLite to MySQL; if you've written your queries using Fluent, then you  mostly don't need to rewrite or alter your code unless you've written raw queries  using DB::raw  . Fluent handles this behind the scenes.  [ 16 ]   Let's take a quick look at the Eloquent Model of Laravel 4  which can be found in the  Vendor\Laravel\Framework\src\Illuminate\Database\Query folder :  <?php namespace Illuminate\Database\Query;  use Closure; use Illuminate\Support\Collection; use Illuminate\Database\ConnectionInterface; use Illuminate\Database\Query\Grammars\Grammar; use Illuminate\Database\Query\Processors\Processor;  class Builder {       methods and variables come here }  As you can see, the Eloquent Model uses some classes, such as Database,  ConnectionInterface, Collection, Grammar, and Processor. All of these   are required to standardize database queries in the backend, cache the queries   if required, and return the output as a collection object.  The following are some basic examples that present how the queries look:     To get all of the names and show them one by one from a users table, use   the following code: $users = DB::table 'users' ->get  ; foreach  $users as $user  {     var_dump $user->name ; }  The get  method fetches all of the records from the table in the form of  a collection. With a foreach   loop, the records are looped, and then we  access each name column using ->name  an object . If the column we want   to access is an e-mail, then it'll look like $user->email.     To fetch the first user named Arda from the users table, use the    following code: $user = DB::table 'users' ->where 'name', 'Arda' ->first  ; var_dump $user->name ; The where   method filters the query with given parameters. The first    method directly returns the collection object of a single item from the first  matched element. If there were two users named Arda, only the first one  would be caught and set to the $user variable.  [ 17 ]       If you wanted to use OR statements in the where clauses, you could use the  following code: $user = DB::table 'users'  ->where 'name', 'Arda'  ->orWhere 'name', 'Ibrahim'  ->first  ; var_dump $user->name ;     To use operators in the where clauses, the following third parameter should   be added between the column name and variable that is to be filtered: $user = DB::table 'users' ->where 'id', '>', '2' ->get  ; foreach  $users as $user  {     var_dump $user->email ; }      If you are using offsets and limits, execute the following query: $users = DB::table 'users' ->skip 10 ->take 5 ->get  ;  This produces SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 10,5 in MySQL. The  skip $integer  method will set an offset to the query, and take $ integer   will limit the output by the natural number that has been set as the parameter.     You can also limit what is to be fetched using the select   method and use   the following join statements easily in Fluent Query Builder: DB::table 'users'     ->join 'contacts', 'users.id', '=', 'contacts.user_id'     ->join 'orders', 'users.id', '=', 'orders.user_id'     ->select 'users.id', 'contacts.phone', 'orders.price' ;  These methods simply join the users table with contacts, then join orders  with users, and then get the user ID, the phone column from the contacts  table, and the price column from the orders table.     You can group queries by parameters easily, using closure functions. This   will allow you to write more complicated queries with ease, as follows: DB::table 'users'      ->where 'name', '=', 'John'      ->orWhere function $query      {         $query->where 'votes', '>', 100                ->where 'title', ' ', 'Admin' ;  [ 18 ]       }      ->get  ;  This will produce the following SQL query:  select * from users     where name = 'John'     or      votes > 100 and title   'Admin'      You can also use aggregations in the query builder  such as count, max, min,   avg, and sum  as follows: $users = DB::table 'users' ->count  ; $price = DB::table 'orders' ->max 'price' ;     Sometimes, such builders might not be enough, or you might want to run   raw queries. You can also wrap your raw queries inside of Fluent as follows: $users = DB::table 'users'       ->select  array  DB::raw 'count *  as user_count' , 'status',          ->where 'status', ' ', 1       ->groupBy 'status'       ->get  ;     To insert new data into the table, use the insert   method:  DB::table 'users' ->insert      array 'email' => 'me@ardakilicdagi.com', 'points' => 100   ;      To update a row s  from a table, use the update   method:  DB::table 'users'  ->where 'id', 1  ->update array 'votes' => 100  ;      To delete a row s  from a table, use the delete   method:  DB::table 'users'  ->where 'last_login', '2013-01-01 00:00:00'  ->delete  ;   [ 19 ]      Benefiting of CachingIterator that's used the Collection class, Fluent   Query Builder can also cache results upon calling using the method  remember  : $user = DB::table 'users'  ->where 'name', 'Arda'  ->remember 10  ->first  ; After this query is called once, it's cached for 10 minutes; if this query is  called again, instead of fetching from the database, it'll fetch directly from   the cache instead, until 10 minutes have passed.  Eloquent ORM Eloquent ORM is the Active Record implementation in Laravel. It's simple, powerful,  and easy to handle and manage.  For each database table, you'll need a new Model Instance to benefit from Eloquent.  Let's say you have a posts table, and you want to benefit from Eloquent; you need   to navigate to app models and save this file as Post.php  the singular form of the  table name :  <?php class Post extends Eloquent {}  And that's it! You're ready to benefit from Eloquent methods for your table.  Laravel allows you to assign any table to any Eloquent Model Instance. It's not  necessary, but it's a good habit to name Model Instances with the singular name of  the corresponding table. This name should be a singular form of the table name it  represents. If you have to use a name that does not follow this general rule, you can  do so by setting a protected $table variable inside of the Model Instance.  <?php Class Post Extends Eloquent {     protected $table = 'my_uber_posts_table';  }  This way, you can assign a table to any desired Model Instance.  It's not necessary to add the instance into the models folder in app.  As long as you've set an autoload path in composer.json, you  can get rid of this folder completely and add it wherever you like.  This will bring flexibility to your architecture during programming.  [ 20 ]   Let's take a quick look at the following Model class of Laravel 4 that we just extended  from  which is in the Vendor\Laravel\Framework\src\Illuminate\Database\ Eloquent folder :  <?php namespace Illuminate\Database\Eloquent;  use DateTime; use ArrayAccess; use Carbon\Carbon; use LogicException; use JsonSerializable; use Illuminate\Events\Dispatcher; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasOne; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany; use Illuminate\Support\Contracts\JsonableInterface; use Illuminate\Support\Contracts\ArrayableInterface; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Relation; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphOne; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphMany; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo; use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder as QueryBuilder; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphToMany; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany; use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasManyThrough; use Illuminate\Database\ConnectionResolverInterface as Resolver;  abstract class Model implements ArrayAccess, ArrayableInterface,  JsonableInterface, JsonSerializable {      Methods and variables come here }  Eloquent uses Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder, which is the Fluent Query  Builder that we described earlier, and its methods are defined inside it. Thanks to  this, all of the methods that can be defined in Fluent Query Builder can also be used  in Eloquent ORM.  As you can see, all of the used classes are split according to their purpose.   This brings a better Abstraction and Reusability to the architecture.  [ 21 ]   Relationships Eloquent ORM has other benefits in addition to Fluent Query Builder. The major  benefit is Model Instance Relations, which allows Fluent Query Builder to form a  relationship with other Model Instances easily. Let's say you have users and posts  tables, and you want to get the posts made by a user with an ID of 5. After the  relationship is set, the collection of these posts can be fetched with this code easily:  User::find 5 ->posts;  This couldn't be easier, could it? There are three major relationship types: one-to-one,  one-to-many, and many-to-many. In addition to these, Laravel 4 also has the   has-many-through and morph-to-many  many-to-many polymorphic  relationships:    One-to-one relationships: These are used when both Models have only one  element of each other. Let's say you have a User Model, which should only  have one element in your Phone Model. In this case, the relationship will be  defined as follows:   User.php model Class User Extends Eloquent {     public function phone   {       return $this->hasOne 'Phone' ;   Phone is the name of           Model Instance here, not a table or column name    }    Phone.php model Class Phone Extends Eloquent {     public function user   {       return $this->hasOne 'User' ;    }  }  }     One-to-many relationships: These are used when a Model has more than  one element of another. Let's say you have a news system with categories.   A category can have more than one item. In this case, the relationship will   be defined as follows:   Category.php model class Category extends Eloquent {     public function news   {  [ 22 ]         return $this->hasMany 'News' ;   News is the name of           Model Instance here    }    News.php model class News extends Eloquent {     public function categories   {       return $this->belongsTo 'Category' ;    }     Many-to-many relationships: These are used when two Models have more   than one element of each other. Let's say you have Blog and Tag Models.   A blog post might have more than one tag, and a tag might be assigned to  more than one blog post. For such instances, a pivot table is used along with  Many to Many Relationships. The relationship can be defined as follows:   Blog.php Model Class Blog Extends Eloquent {     public function tags   {       return $this->belongsToMany 'Tag', 'blog_tag' ;             blog_tag is the name of the pivot table    }    Tag.php model Class Tag Extends Eloquent {     public function blogs   {       return $this->belongsToMany 'Blog', 'blog_tag' ;    }  Laravel 4 adds some flexibility and additional relationships to these known  relationships. They are "has-many-through" and "polymorphic relationships".  }  }  }  }  [ 23 ]      Has-many-through relationships: These are more like shortcuts. Let's say  you have a Country Model, User Model, and Post Model. A country may  have more than one user, and a user may have more than one post. If you  want to access all of the posts created by the users of a specific country, you  need to define the relationship as follows:   Country.php Model Class Country Extends Eloquent {     public function posts   {       return $this->hasManyThrough 'Post', 'User' ;    }     Polymorphic relationships: These are featured in Laravel v4.1. Let's say   you have a News Model, Blog Model, and Photo Model. This Photo Model  holds images for both News and Blog, but how do you relate this or identify  a specific photo that is either for blogs or posts? This can be done easily. It  needs to be set as follows:    Photo.php Model Class Photo Extends Eloquent {     public function imageable   {       return $this->morphTo  ;   This method doesn't take          any parameters, Eloquent will understand what will            be morphed by calling this method    }    News.php Model Class News Extends Eloquent {     public function photos   {       return $this->morphMany 'Photo', 'imageable' ;    }    Blog.php Model Class Blog Extends Eloquent {     public function photos   {       return $this->morphMany 'Photo', 'imageable' ;    }  [ 24 ]  }  }  }  }   The keyword imageable, which will describe the owner of the image, is not  a must; it could be anything, but you need to set it as a method name and put  it as a second parameter into morphMany relationship definitions. This helps  us understand how we're going to access the owner of the photo. This way,  we can call this easily from the Photo Model without needing to understand  whether its owner is Blog or News: $photo = Photo::find 1 ; $owner = $photo->imageable;   This brings either a blog     collection or News according to its owner.  In this example, you'll need to add two additional columns to  your Photo Model's table. These columns are imageable_id  and imageable_type. The section imageable is the name of  the morphing method, and the suffix's ID and type are the keys  that will define the exact ID and type of the item that it will be  morphed to.  Mass assignment When creating a new Model Instance  when inserting or updating data , we pass  a variable that is set as an array with attribute names and values. These attributes  are then assigned to the Model by mass assignment. If we blindly add all of the  inputs into mass assignment, this will become a serious security issue. In addition to  querying methods, Eloquent ORM also helps us with mass assignment. Let's say you  don't want the column e-mail in your User Model  Object  to be altered in any way   blacklist , or you just want the title and body columns to be altered in your Post  Model  whitelist . This can be done by setting protected $fillable and $guarded  variables in your Model:    User.php model Class User Extends Eloquent {      Disable the mass assignment of the column email     protected $guarded = array 'email' ;  }  }    Blog.php model Class User Extends Eloquent {      Only allow title and body columns to be mass assigned    protected $fillable = array 'title', 'body' ;  [ 25 ]   Soft deleting Let's say you have a posts table, and let's assume the data inside this table is  important. Even if the delete command is run from the Model, you want to keep the  deleted data inside your database just in case. In such cases, you can use soft deletes  with Laravel.  Soft deleting doesn't actually delete the row from the table; instead, it adds a key  if the data is actually deleted. When a soft deletion is made, a new column called  deleted_at is filled with a timestamp.  To enable the soft deletes, you need to first add a timestamp column called   deleted_at to your table  you could do this by adding $table->softDeletes     to your migration , then set a variable called $softDelete to true in your   Model Instance.  The following is an example Model Instance for soft deletes:    Post.php model Class Post Extends Eloquent {      Allow Soft Deletes    protected $softDelete = true;  }  Now, when you run the delete   method in this model, instead of actually deleting  the column, it will add a deleted_at timestamp to it.  Now, when you run the all   or get   method, the soft-deleted columns won't be  listed, like they have actually been deleted.  After such deletes, you might want to get results along with soft-deleted rows.   To do this, use the withTrashed   method as follows:  $allPosts = Post::withTrashed  ->get  ;   These results will include  both soft-deleted and non-soft-deleted posts.  In some cases, you may want to fetch only soft-deleted rows. To do this, use the  onlyTrashed   method as follows:  $onlySoftDeletedPosts = Post::onlyTrashed  ->get  ;  To restore the soft-deleted rows, use the restore   method. To restore all   soft-deleted posts, run a code like the following:  $restoreAllSoftDeletedPosts = Post::onlyTrashed  ->restore  ;  [ 26 ]   To hard delete  totally delete  the soft-deleted rows from a table, use the  forceDelete   method as follows:  $forceDeleteSoftDeletedPosts = Post::onlyTrashed  ->forceDelete  ;  When fetching rows from a table  including soft deletes , you may want to check  whether they have been soft deleted or not. This check is done by running the  trashed   method on collection rows. This method will return a Boolean value.   If true, it means the row has been soft deleted.    Let's fetch a post without the soft-delete checking: $post = Post::withTrashed  ->find 1 ;   Then let's check whether it's soft deleted or now       if $post->trashed    { return 'This post is soft-deleted';     } else {    return 'This post is not soft-deleted'; }  Eager loading Eloquent ORM also brings a neat solution to the N+1 query problem with   Eager Loading. Let's assume that you have a query and loop like the following:  $blogs = Blog::all  ; foreach $blogs as $blog  {    var_dump $blog->images   ; }  In this case, to access the images, one more query is executed for each loop in the  backend. This will exhaust the database drastically, so to prevent this, we will use the  with   method on the query. This will fetch all of the blogs and images, relate them  in the backend, and serve them as a collection directly. Refer to the following code:  $blogs = Blog::with 'images' ->get  ; foreach $blogs as $blog  {    var_dump $blog->images ; }  This way, the querying will be much faster, and fewer resources will be used.  Timestamps The main benefits of Eloquent ORM are seen when you set $timestamps to true   which is the default ; you will have two columns, the first is created_at and the  second is updated_at. These two columns keep the creation and last update times   of data as timestamps and update them automatically on the creation or update of  each row.  [ 27 ]   Query scopes Let's say that you repeat a where condition several times because it's a commonly  used clause in your application and this condition means something. Let's say you  want to get all of the blog posts that have more than 100 views  we'll call it popular  posts . Without using scopes, you'd get the posts in the following format:  $popularBlogPosts = Blog::where 'views', '>', '100' ->get  ;  However, in the example, you'll be repeating this through your application over and  over again. So, why not set this as a scope? You can do this easily using Laravel's  Query Scope feature.  Add the following code to your Blog model:  public function scopePopular $query  {    return $query->where 'views', '>', '100' ; }  After doing this, you can use your scope easily with the following code:  $popularBlogPosts = Blog::popular  ->get  ;  You can also chain the post as follows:  $popularBlogPosts = Blog::recent  ->popular  ->get  ;  Accessors and mutators One of the features of Eloquent ORM is accessors and mutators. Let's say you have  a column called name on your table, and on calling this column, you want to pass  PHP's ucfirst   method to uppercase its name. This can be done by simply adding  the following lines of code to the model:  public function getNameAttribute $value  {     return ucfirst $value ; }  Now, let's consider the opposite. Each time you save or update the name column, you  want to pass the PHP strtolower   function to the column  you want to mutate the  input . This can be done by adding the following lines of code to the model:  public function setNameAttribute $value  {     return strtolower $value ; }  [ 28 ]   Note that the method name should be CamelCased even though the column name is  snake_cased. If your column name is first_name, the getter method name should  be getFirstNameAttribute.  Model events Model events play an important part in the Laravel design pattern. Using Model  events, you can call any method right after the event is fired.  Let's say that you have set a cache for your comments, and you want to flush the  cache each time a comment is deleted. How can you catch the comment's deletion  event and do something there? Should there be various places in the application  that such comments can be deleted? Is there a way to catch exact the "deleting" or  "deleted" event? In such case, the Model events come in handy.  Models hold the following methods: creating, created, updating, updated,  saving, saved, deleting, deleted, restoring, and restored.  Whenever a new item is being saved for the first time, the creating and created  events will fire. If you are updating a current item on the Model, the updating  updated events will fire. Whether you are creating a new item or updating a current  one, the saving saved events will fire.  If false is returned from the creating, updating, saving, or deleting event, the  action will be canceled.  For example, let's check whether a user has been created. If its first name is Hybrid,  we'll cancel the creation. To add this condition, include the following lines of code in  your User Model:  User::creating function $user {     if  $user->first_name == 'Hybrid'  return false; } ;  Model observers Model observers are quite similar to Model Events, but the approach is a little bit  different. Instead of defining all events  creating, created, updating, updated,  saving, saved, deleting, deleted, restoring, and restored  inside of the Model,  it "abstracts" the logic of the events to a different class and "observes" it with the  observe   method. Let's assume we have a Model event like the following:  User::creating function $user {     if  $user->first_name == 'Hybrid'  return false; } ;  [ 29 ]   To keep the abstraction, it will be much better to wrap all of these events and separate  their logic from the Model. In an observer, these events will look like the following:  class UserObserver {     public function creating $model {        if  $model->first_name == 'Hybrid'  return false;     }      public function saving $model      {           Another model event action here     }  }  As you can imagine, you can put this class anywhere in your application. You can  even group all of these events in a separate folder for a better architectural pattern.  Now, you need to register this event Observer class to a Model. This can be done  with the following simple command:  User::observe new UserObserver ;  The main advantage of this approach is that you can use observers in more than one  Model and register more than one observer to a Model this way.  Migrations Migrations are easy tools to version control your database. Let's say there is a place  where you need to add a new column to the table or roll back to the previous state  because you did something wrong or the link to your application broke. Without  migrations, these are tedious tasks to handle, but with migrations, your life will be  much easier.  There are various reasons to use migrations; some of these are as follows:     You'll benefit from this versioning system. If you made a mistake or need   to roll back to a previous state, you can do so with only a single command  using migrations.     The use of migrations for alteration will bring about flexibility. The   migrations that are written will work on all supported database drivers,  so you won't need to rewrite database code again and again for different  drivers. Laravel will handle this in the background.  [ 30 ]      They are quite easy to generate. Using the migration commands of the  Laravel php client, which is called artisan, you can manage all of your  application's migrations.  The following is what a migration file looks like:  <?php  use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;  class CreateNewsTable extends Migration {           **         * Run the migrations.         *          public function up           {                            }           **         * Reverse the migrations.         *          public function down           {                            }  }  The up   method runs when the migration is run forward  a new migration . The  down   method runs when the migration is run backward, meaning it reverses or  resets  reverses and reruns  the migration.  After these methods are triggered via the artisan command, it runs the method up  or down, corresponding the parameters of the artisan command, and returns the  status of the message.  Database seeders Let's say you've programmed a blog application. You need to show what it's   capable of, but there are no example blog posts to show the awesome blog   you've programmed. This is where seeders come in handy.  [ 31 ]   Database seeders are some simple classes that fill random data in a specified table.  The seeder class has a simple method called run   to make this seeding s . The  following is what a seeder looks like:  <?php   class BlogTableSeeder extends Seeder {     public function run     {     DB::table 'blogs' ->insert array        array 'title' => 'My Title' ,       array 'title' => 'My Second Title' ,       array 'title' => 'My Third Title'        ;   }   }  When you call this class from a terminal using the artisan command, it connects to  the database and fills it with the given data. After this attempt, it returns a command  message to the user over the terminal about the status of the seeding.

Summary In this chapter, we have learned about the role of the Model in the MVC pattern and  how Laravel 4 "defines" the Model by extending its roles to various classes. We've  also seen what the Model components of Laravel 4 are capable of with examples.  In the next chapter, we'll learn about the role of the View and how it interacts with  end users and other aspects of the application using the MVC pattern on Laravel 4.  [ 32 ]   Views in MVC  In this chapter, we will discuss what the View is, its structure, its purpose, and the  advantages of Laravel's View layer and Blade template engine.  What is a View? The View in Laravel refers to the V in MVC. The View consists of presentation   logic aspects such as templates and caching and the code that involves presentation.  Precisely, the View defines exactly what is presented to the user. Usually,   Controllers pass data to each View to render in some format. Views collect   data from users as well. This is where you're likely to find HTML markup   in your MVC application.  Most modern MVCs, such as Laravel Framework, implement a template language  that adds a further layer of abstraction from PHP. Added layers mean added  overhead. Here, we stick with the speed of PHP within the template, yet all the  logic stays outside. This makes it easy for User Interface  UI  designers to develop  themes templates without the need to learn any programming languages.   In many MVC implementations, the View layer speaks with Controllers and Models.  The approach is well explained in the following figure:  User  Model  View  Controller  Strong Pointer Weak Pointer  As you can see in the preceding figure, the View communicates with both the  Controller and the Model. At first sight, it seems like a very flexible approach to  develop an application with OOP languages. Sharing data between all objects  of MVC and accessing them in any layer of application sounds very cool.  Unfortunately, the method causes some problems that depend on the project's size.  The foremost problems are the complexity of allocating development tasks between  teams developers. If you don't set the development rules, it will lead to chaotic  situations such as unmanageable spaghetti code. Also, we have to consider extra  costs of development such as training the developers and comparatively long  development processes, which directly affect the cost of the project.  As we mentioned at the beginning of the book, development not only involves coding  or sharing tasks, it's also the process that includes the planning and marketing of the  project development method.  [ 34 ]   Laravel ships a different kind of approach to MVC. According to Laravel, the View  layer should only communicate with the Controller. The Model communicates with  the Controller. Let's look at the following figure:  View  Only  UI components  Controller  Connection between  View and Model  As you can see in the preceding figure, the layers of application are completely  separated. Thus, you can get easily manageable code and a development team.  Generally, we need at least three files in MVCs: the Model file, the Controller file,  and the View file. Let's explain the View file through its objects.  View objects In your application, there is usually more than one HTML page that contains forms,  asset references, and so on; for example, if you are developing an e-commerce  application. In a simple e-commerce system, there are product lists, categories,   carts, and product detail pages that we need. This means that we need four templates  and too much data to present to our users. We can group the objects of the View  layer as shown:     HTML elements  div, header, section, and so on     HTML form elements  input, select, and so on     Asset and JavaScript references  .css and .js   Model  Database  and logic  [ 35 ]   When you work on a project that has dynamic data, separating the template files  does not help simplify the problem because you still need programming language  functions to process objects. This causes what we don't want to face—spaghetti code.  When a project has inline PHP code in HTML documents, you will face problems in  keeping the code simple. Let's take a look at the generic template file contents that  are not implemented with any template language in the following code:                <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text html; charset=utf-8"      >      "  >   "  >      "  >   "      >  <meta property="og:image" content="http:  www.example.com  images "       >     <meta property="og:description" content="<?php echo $meta_desc;     ?>"  >        <?php  if $user_name {  ?>  Welcome <?php echo strtoupper $user_name ;     ?> !   <?php  }else{   echo ' Welcome Guest! ';   }  ?>      [ 36 ]   As a UI developer, you need prior knowledge of the PHP language  at least  knowledge of the syntax of the language  to understand the code you see. As we  mentioned in Chapter 1, Design and Architectural Pattern Fundamentals, most modern  MVC frameworks come with a template language bundled to be used in Views.  Laravel ships an implemented template language to be used with Views; this is  called the Blade template engine, or simply Blade.  View in Laravel According to Laravel's MVC approach, the View handles data from the Controller.  This means that the View gets the data that is usually already formatted as we need.  If the View directly communicates with the Model, we have to format, validate, or  filter the data at the View layer, as seen in the previous example code. So, let's see  what a Blade template file looks like in the following code:            {{$title}}   <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text html; charset=utf-8"      >                   <meta property="og:image" content="http:  www.example.com  images "{{$thumbnail}}  >                @if $user_name    @else   @endif      Welcome {{$user_name}} !     Welcome Guest !    [ 37 ]   There is neither PHP syntax nor any unclosed brackets problems. So, we have a  cleaner template file. Thanks to Blade's built-in features, we can get clearer View  files. Generally, the header and footer sections are common to all pages in our  applications. There are two ways to add them. The first and unrecommended way is  to separate the header, footer, and body sections in three files, similar to something  shown in the following example:   Welcome {{Str::upper $user_name }} !     Welcome Guest !    @include 'header'     @if $user_name    @else   @endif     @include 'footer'   This way is not recommended because it requires each page to include both the  header and the footer. This also means that if we add a right or left column, we will  need to change all the Views of our application. The best way to implement this in  Blade is shown as follows:            {{$title}}                        <meta property="og:image" content="http:  www.example.com  images "{{$thumbnail}}  >             [ 38 ]      @yield 'content'          @extends 'master_layout'   @section ''content'     @if $user_name    @else   @endif     @stop  The preceding file is our layout View, for example, master_layout.blade.php.   As you can see, there is a function for the content that is using the yield   function.  This is a placeholder; therefore, when any View file extends this file, the section  named content will be shown instead of the yield   function. You can define as  many sections in your master layout as you need. So, when we want to use this  layout in a View file, we should use it as shown in the following code:   Welcome {{Str::upper $user_name }} !     Welcome Guest !    That's it! You can extend the master layout in as many Views as you need, and you  can create multiple layouts as your application requires.  Summary In this chapter, we learned the role of Views in the MVC pattern, and what Laravel's  approach to Views is. We saw the basics of the Blade template engine functions.   For more information, please refer to Laravel's online documentation at   http:  laravel.com .  In the next chapter, we'll cover the role of the Controller, the maestro in the MVC  philosophy of Laravel.  [ 39 ]    Controllers in MVC  Throughout this chapter, we will be discussing what a Controller is, its structure,  what its purpose is in the MVC pattern, and its usage in Laravel's extended design  pattern and structure.  The topics that will be discussed in this chapter are as follows:     What is a Controller?    The Controller's purpose in the MVC design pattern    The Controller's interaction with other components of the MVC    design pattern     How Laravel handles the Controller in its design pattern  What is a Controller? The Controller is a part of the Model-View-Controller  MVC  design pattern that  we can simply describe as the logical layer of our application. It understands the  requests that come from the other end  a user or an API request , makes calls to the  corresponding methods, performs primary checks, handles the logic of the request,  and then returns the data to the corresponding View or redirects the end user to  another route.   The purpose of the Controller The following are some of the major roles of the Controller in an MVC structure:     Holding the logic of the application and defining which event should be fired      Being the intermediary step between the Model, View, and other components   upon actions  of the application     Translating actions and responses that come from the View and Model that   can be understood by them and sending them to other layers     Making a bridge between other components of the application and   facilitating communication between them     Making primary permission checks in construct methods before any action  This can best be explained with a real-world example.  Let's assume we have a user management website, and in the administration  panel, an administrator tries to delete a user. In design patterns that follow SOLID  principles, the following things happen if an admin clicks on the delete user button:  1.  From the View, the admin sends a request to the corresponding Controller to   delete the news item.  2.  The Controller understands this request and performs primary checks.   First, it checks if the requester  the administrator, in our case  is really an  administrator and has permissions to delete this user.  3.  After the primary checks, the Controller tells the Model to delete the user. 4.  The Model performs some checks of its own and either deletes the user and   tells the Controller that the user is deleted, or tells the Controller that the user  is not available  maybe the user is already deleted .  5.  After the response comes from the Model, the Controller either tells the View  to tell the administrator the user is deleted or redirects to another page with a  response like a 404 not found page.  As you can see from the preceding example, for all interactions, the Controller holds  the major role for the communication between the components of the application.  In an MVC pattern that follows SOLID principles, without the Controller, the View  cannot interact with the Model and vice versa. Although there are some derivations  to this architectural pattern, like where View interacts with Model s  directly, in a  perfect SOLID design architecture, the Controller should always be the intermediate  element for all interactions.  [ 42 ]   The Controller can also be considered as a translator. It gets input from the View in  various ways and converts it to request s  that can be understood by the Model s ,  and vice versa.  Logic and Translator  Controller  Property Update  Component  Update  Property Change  User Action  Model  View  Controllers in Laravel In Laravel 4, the Controllers are simple PHP classes with their filenames and  classnames ending with the suffix Controller  not forced, but highly recommended;  it's a standard between developers , which extends the class BaseController, and  are stored in the folder app controllers as default. This folder structure is defined  in the composer.json file's classmap key and is not forced. Thanks to the Composer,  as long as you define where the Controllers are stored in your application's structure,  you can put them in any folder you like.  The following is a very simple Controller for Laravel 4:  <?php  }  class UserController extends BaseController {      public function showProfile $id      {         $user = User::find $id ;          return View::make 'user.profile', array 'user' => $user  ;     }  The Controller holds all the action methods for actions that are defined in routes.php,  in which all the actions  every link that the users interact with  are set in Laravel 4.  [ 43 ]   In Laravel 3, the developers had to prefix methods with either GET or POST so as to  understand the corresponding request's type. If your request was a GET request,  your method's name would have to be get_profile, and if the request was a POST  request, it'd have to be like post_profile. Thanks to Laravel 4, it's now not forced,  and you can name your methods any way you like.  A question now crops up. How do we access this method of the Controller? As we  mentioned earlier, we'll be using routes to do this.  Routes Routes are a set of rules defined in app routes.php that tell Laravel, upon receiving  an incoming request, which closure functions and or Controller methods are being  called based on the requested URL. There are various ways to define a route. Three  of these are explained as follows:     You can use closure functions and set the logic for the action directly from   app routes.php. Have a look at the following code: Route::get 'hello', function  {    return 'Ahoy, everyone!'; } ;  Here, we've called the get   method because we want this route to be  a GET request. The first parameter is the path of the action, so if we call  http:  ourwebsite.com hello, this route action will be called. The second  parameter can be from various selections. It can either be an array that holds  the name, filter and action, a string that defines the Controller's method for  action, or a closure function which holds the logic directly. In our example,  we've put a closure function and returned a string directly to the end user.  So if the user navigates to http:  ourwebsite.com hello, the end user will  see the message Ahoy, everyone! directly.     The second way to set a route is to pass a second parameter as a string, define   which Controller it is passed to, and the action to be called. Have a look at  the following code: Route::get 'hello', 'ProfileController@hello' ;  Here, the string ProfileController@hello tells Laravel that the method  hello will be called from the Controller named ProfileController. We've  separated them using the character @.  [ 44 ]      The third way is to set an array as a second parameter, which gets various   keys and values. Have a look at the following code: Route::get 'hello', array     'before'   => 'member',    'as'       => 'our_hello_page'    'uses'     => 'ProfileController@hello'   ;  The array can have more than one parameter that define the route's name, the filter  that'll be applied before calling the action, and which Controller and its method s   will be used. The following are the three different keys:     The before key defines the filter before calling the action, so you can set   some filtering parameters before calling each action. For example, if you have  a members-only area and you don't want guests to access that resource, you  can pass filters by using the before parameter in your route.     The as key defines the name of the route. This is quite beneficial. Let's say   you need to change the URL structure of your application. Classically, if you  change the route's action path, you need to change every URL or redirections  for this action through your application. Instead, if you set the links and  redirections with names, you only need to change the path once, and all links  and redirections will be magically fixed.     The uses key has the exact same structure as our second example. It holds   the name of the Controller and its method s  upon calling.  In all these examples, the route did not get any parameters, and we didn't pass any  parameters. Think like this: we have accessed the profiles area by using routes, but  in these examples, we didn't set a way to access a specific user. How would we set a  parameter to these routes? For this, we'll have to set the parameters in curly brackets.  Run the following to set a parameter to a route:  Route::get 'users {id}', function $id {    return 'Hello, the user with ID of '.$id; } ;  The parameter s  in curly brackets become a variable name directly in closure  methods. This approach also offers us a way to filter these parameters before the  Controller's method runs. Using where  , you can filter these parameters. Have a  look at the following code:  Route::get 'users {id}', function $id {   } ->where array 'id' => '[0-9]+'  ;  return 'Hello, the user with ID of '.$id;  [ 45 ]   The method where   is either an array with keys and values, or two parameters, in  which the first is the name in curly brackets, and the second is a regular expression to  filter the parameter.  In our example, we've filtered the parameter ID with a regular expression to match  only numbers, so in this way, we will be distinguishing different kinds of data to  overload the endpoint.  Also, there is another benefit to this approach. If a person tries to navigate to  http:  ourwebsite.com users xssSqlInjection, Laravel will throw a 404 error  even before going to the Controller's method.  If we follow this structure, we need to set each action one by one for each GET, POST,  PUT, and DELETE requests. If you want to use the RESTful structure for your actions,  instead of setting each route one by one, you can use the controller   method of  the Route class.  Certain steps need to be followed to set the routes of a RESTful Controller. For a user  Controller, the following are the steps:  1.  You first need to make a new Controller named UserController and set  your RESTful methods such as index  , create  , store  , show $id ,  edit $id , update $id , and destroy $id .  2.  Then you need to set the RESTful Controller in app routes.php by running   the following: Route::controller 'users', 'UserController' ;  Laravel offers a faster way to create Resourceful Controllers. These are called Resource  Controllers by Laravel. Follow these steps to set the routes of a Resourceful Controller:  1.  You first need to make a new Controller with Resourceful methods using   Laravel's PHP client, artisan. Have a look at the following code: php artisan controller:make NewsController With this command, a new file named NewsController.php is automatically  generated in the app controllers folder with all the Resourceful methods  already defined inside it.  2.  Then you need to set the Resourceful Controller in app routes.php by   running the following: Route::resource 'news', 'NewsController' ; While setting the Resourceful Controller, you can set what actions are to be  included or excluded by setting a third parameter to this Route definition.  [ 46 ]   3.  To include actions that will be defined in the Resourceful Controller  kind of   like a whitelist , you use the only key as follows: Route::resource     'news',     'NewsController',    array 'only' => array 'index', 'show'    ;  4.  To exclude actions that will be defined in the Resourceful Controller  kind of   like a blacklist , you use the except key as follows: Route::resource     'news',     'NewsController',    array 'except' => array 'create', 'store', 'update',        'destroy'    ;  5.  All Resource Controller actions have defined route names. You may also   want to override action names in some cases, and this can be done by setting  up a third parameter called names as follows: Route::resource     'news',     'NewsController',    array 'names' => array 'create' =>        'news.myCoolCreateAction'   ;  If you have gone through the previous chapter, you may remember we had filters  in routes, but we didn't use the key before in RESTful and Resourceful Controllers.  To use the key before, we can perform the steps we the previously followed or  set filters in Controllers. These can be set in the __construct   method of the  Controller  if there is none, create one  as follows:  class NewsController extends BaseController {      public function __construct       {          $this->beforeFilter 'csrf', array 'on' => 'post'  ;          $this->beforeFilter function  {              my custom filter codes in closure function         } ;  [ 47 ]           $this->afterFilter 'log',             array 'only' => array 'fooAction', 'barAction'            ;     }  }  As you can see, we've set filters using the beforeFilter   and afterFilter    methods. These methods either get a closure function or the name of the filter as a  first parameter and an optional second parameter, as an array, to define where these  filters work.  In this example, we've firstly set CSRF  Cross-site Request Forgery, which is a  method to forge a trusted request and to inject malicious code into the application  through this forged request  protection filters to all the POST actions; after that, we've  defined a filter in a closure function and used the afterFilter method to log all  fooAction and barAction events' statuses.  The following table is a list of actions that Laravel's Resource Controller handles:  Verb GET  GET  POST  GET  GET PUT PATCH DELETE   resource   resource create  Path  resource  Action Index Create Store Show  resource {resource}  resource {resource} edit Edit  resource {resource}   resource {resource}  Route name resource.index  resource.create  resource.store  resource.show  resource.edit  Update Destroy  resource.update  resource.destroy  Using Controllers inside folders In some cases, you may want to group Controllers inside a folder, and have them in  a more hierarchical structure. There are two ways to achieve this.  Before explaining these methods, let's assume we have a UserController.php   file inside an app controllers admin folder, which we've just created for   admin-related Controller files. There is a question that crops up here: how do we  make both Laravel and the Controller files understand where the Controllers are?  Namespaces are used for such requirements. Namespaces are simple ways to  encapsulate and group items.  [ 48 ]   Let's say you have the app controllers UserController.php and app  controllers admin UserController.php files. How do we call a specific one?  Namespaces come in handy here. Save the following file as app controllers  admin UserController.php:  <?php namespace admin;   The definition of namespace  use View;   What will be used  Class UserController Extends \BaseController {     public function index   {       return View::make 'hello' ;    }  }  Now we define the route as follows:  Route::get 'my admin users index', 'Admin\UserController@index' ;  Here, we've added some new additions to this Controller. They are as follows:     The first one is namespace admin;. This simply defines that this file is inside   a folder called admin.     The second one is use View;. If our Controller is under a folder or a defined   namespace unless we import them, all the classes we'll be calling will be   like namespace\class. If we didn't add this line, the View::make     function would throw an error saying Class admin\View not found. To  understand this better, you can think of this like HTML's assets calling. Let's  assume you are browsing admin users.html, and inside it there is an image  whose path is defined in this format: <img src= "assets img avatar. png"  >. As you may imagine, the image will be requested from admin  assets img avatar.png because it is inside a folder called assets. This is  exactly the same situation.     We've added a \  backslash  character while we're extending from the   BaseController class. This will signify that it will be called from root. If we  didn't add use View; to our class and wanted to make View::make   work,  we should modify it to \View::make    with a leading backslash  so that the  correct class will be requested.  [ 49 ]   If there is a totally new folder structure, it can be defined in two ways. Either add  each folder path into the autoload classmap object in the composer.json file or  define a psr-0 autoload. Let's assume we have a new app myApp folder, and inside it  is a Controller located at app myApp controllers admin UserController.php.  Add a classmap object to the Controller as follows:  "autoload": {       "classmap": [          "app commands",          "app controllers",           "app models",           "app database migrations",           "app database seeds",           "app tests TestCase.php",            "app myApp controllers admin",       ] }  Now add a psr-0 autoload to the code as follows:  "autoload": {       "classmap": [          "app commands",          "app controllers",          "app models",          "app database migrations",          "app database seeds",          "app tests TestCase.php",        ],         "psr-0": {          "myApp", "app "       }  }  Then run composer dump-autoload from the terminal to regenerate autoload  classes. By this psr-0 autoload, we've taught our Composer project to autoload  everything recursively inside the myApp folder, which is inside the app folder.  Another way is to prefix the classname with the namespace folders and use  underscores  _  between each folder.  [ 50 ]   Let's assume we have a Controller, app controllers foo bar BazController. php. Save the following inside this folder:  Class foo_bar_BazController extends BaseController {     public function index   {       return View::make 'hello' ;    }  <?php  }  Now we define the route as follows:  Route::get 'foobarbaz', ' foo_bar_BazController@index' ;  Then, we navigate to http:  yourwebsite foobarbaz. It will work automatically  even without namespacing or including classes using use.  Summary In this chapter, we learned the role of the Controller in the MVC pattern and how  you can use Controllers and set routes in Laravel 4. We also learned about filters and  RESTful and Resourceful Controllers.  For more information, you can refer to the official documentation page, located   at http:  laravel.com docs controllers. In the next chapter, we'll learn   about Laravel's unique design pattern, and how it uses Repositories, Facades,   and the Factory pattern.  [ 51 ]    Design Patterns in Laravel  In this chapter, we will discuss the design patterns Laravel uses, and how and why  are they used, with examples.  The topics that will be discussed in this chapter are as follows:     Design patterns used in Laravel    The reasons these patterns are used in Laravel  The Builder  Manager  pattern This design pattern aims to gain simpler, reusable objects. Its goal is to separate  bigger and more convoluted object construction layers from the rest so that the  separated layers can be used in different layers of the application.  The need for the Builder  Manager  pattern In Laravel, the AuthManager class needs to create some secure elements to reuse  with selected auth storage drivers such as cookie, session, or custom elements.  To achieve this, the AuthManager class needs to use storage functions such as  callCustomCreator   and getDrivers   from the Manager class.   Let's see how the Builder  Manager  pattern is used in Laravel. To see what happens  in this pattern, navigate to the vendor Illuminate Support Manager.php and  vendor Illuminate Auth AuthManager.php files, as shown in the following code:     public function driver $driver = null     {       ...     }        ...    }     protected function createDriver $driver     {       $method = 'create'.ucfirst $driver .'Driver';     protected function callCustomCreator $driver     {       return $this->customCreators[$driver] $this->app ;    }     public function extend $driver, Closure $callback     {       $this->customCreators[$driver] = $callback;        return $this;    }    public function getDrivers      {       return $this->drivers;    }     public function __call $method, $parameters     {       return call_user_func_array array $this->driver  , $method ,  $parameters ;    }  [ 54 ]   Now, navigate to the  vendor Illuminate Auth AuthManager.php file, as shown  in the following code:     protected function createDriver $driver     {        ....    }     protected function callCustomCreator $driver     {     public function createDatabaseDriver      {     protected function createDatabaseProvider      {        ....    }     public function createEloquentDriver      {       ...     protected function createEloquentProvider      {       ...     }     }     }     }  [ 55 ]      public function getDefaultDriver      {       ...    }     public function setDefaultDriver $name     {       ...    }  As we can see in the preceding code, the AuthManager class extends from the  Manager class. Laravel ships with a basic auth mechanism. So, we need to store auth  credentials in a database. First, the class checks our default database configuration  with the AuthManager::setDefaultDriver   function. This function actually uses  the Manager class for eloquent operations. All the database and auth options  such as  cookie name  are obtained from the application's config file, except the auth model  table name.  To understand this Builder  Manager  pattern better, we can take the following  presentation as an example:  c  Pizza  1 1  >  c PizzaBuilder  1  1  c Waiter  c ChinesePizzaBuilder  c AsianPizzaBuilder   >   >   >  c Client  In the preceding example diagram, we assumed that we want to fetch data, for  example, pizza, from the previous illustration. The client ordered two pizzas: an  Asian pizza and or a Chinese pizza. This pizza is requested through the Waiter  class. The PizzaBuilder class  which is the Manager class, in our case  made a pizza  according to the AuthRequest request, in our case, and delivered the pizza through  the waiter.  Also, you can navigate to vendor Illuminate Session SessionManage.php and  check for the use of this pattern in Laravel Framework.  [ 56 ]   The Factory pattern In this subsection, we'll examine the Factory pattern and its usage in Laravel  Framework. The Factory pattern is based on creating template method objects, which  is based on defining the algorithm of a class in a subclass to implement an algorithm.  There is a subclass, which is derived from a big superclass, in this pattern structure.  The main class, which we may call a superclass, only holds major and generic logic;  the subclasses are derived from this superclass. As a result, there may be more than  one subclass inherited from this superclass, which are aimed at different purposes.  Unlike other design patterns used in Laravel, the Factory method is more  customizable. For an extended subclass plus main class, you don't need to set a new  class, just a new operation. This method is beneficial if the class or its components  usually change, or methods need to be overridden, much like initialization.  While creating a design, developers usually start with using the Factory pattern  in their applications. Such a pattern is changed into an abstract Factory, Builder,  or Prototype pattern. Unlike the Factory pattern, the Prototype pattern requires  initialization once. Due to the pattern's architecture, the methods of the Factory  pattern  Factory methods  are usually called inside template methods.  There are some differences between the Factory pattern and the Abstract Factory or  Prototype pattern. They are as follows:     Unlike an Abstract Factory pattern, the Factory pattern can't be implemented   using the Prototype pattern.     Unlike the Prototype pattern, the Factory pattern doesn't need an   initialization, but it needs subclassing. This is an advantage when compared  with other patterns. Thanks to this approach, the Factory pattern can return  an injected subclass instead of an object.     Since the classes designed with the Factory pattern may return subclasses  directly for other components, no other class or component needs to know  and access the constructor methods. Due to this, it's recommended that all  constructor methods and variables should be protected or private.     There is another thing to take into consideration. As this pattern might return   subclasses aimed for the exact need, it's not recommended to make a new  instance of the class using this pattern using the key new.  [ 57 ]   The need for the Factory pattern Laravel ships various types of validation rules with the Validation class. When we  develop applications, we usually need to validate data as we proceed. To do this, a  common approach is to set the validation rules in the Model and call them from the  Controller. By "rules" here, we mean both validation type and its range.  Sometimes, we need to set custom rules and custom error messages to validate the  data. Let's examine how it works and how we are able to extend the Validation  class to create custom rules. The Controller in the MVC pattern can also be described  as a bridge between Model and View. This can best be explained with a live   world example.  Let's assume we have a news aggregation website. In the administration panel,  an administrator tries to delete the news item. In the SOLID design pattern, this  happens if an admin clicks on the Delete News button. First, as an example to check, let's open the vendor Illuminate Validation  Factory.php file, as shown in the following code:  <?php namespace Illuminate\Validation;  use Closure; use Illuminate\Container\Container; use Symfony\Component\Translation\TranslatorInterface;  class Factory {     protected $translator;     protected $verifier;     protected $container;     protected $extensions = array  ;     protected $implicitExtensions = array  ;     protected $replacers = array  ;     protected $fallbackMessages = array  ;     protected $resolver;     public function __construct TranslatorInterface $translator,        Container $container = null   [ 58 ]      {       $this->container = $container;       $this->translator = $translator;    }     public function make array $data, array $rules, array $messages        = array  , array $customAttributes = array       {        $validator = $this->resolve $data, $rules, $messages,           $customAttributes ;        if   ! is_null $this->verifier         {          $validator->setPresenceVerifier $this->verifier ;       }        if   ! is_null $this->container         {          $validator->setContainer $this->container ;       }        $this->addExtensions $validator ;        return $validator;    }        protected function addExtensions Validator $validator     {       $validator->addExtensions $this->extensions ;        $implicit = $this->implicitExtensions;        $validator->addImplicitExtensions $implicit ;        $validator->addReplacers $this->replacers ;        $validator->setFallbackMessages $this->fallbackMessages ;    }     protected function resolve array $data, array $rules, array        $messages, array $customAttributes     {  [ 59 ]         if  is_null $this->resolver         {          return new Validator $this->translator, $data, $rules,              $messages, $customAttributes ;       }       else       {          return call_user_func $this->resolver, $this->translator,              $data, $rules, $messages, $customAttributes ;       }    }        public function extend $rule, $extension, $message = null     {       $this->extensions[$rule] = $extension;        if  $message  $this->fallbackMessages[snake_case $rule ] =            $message;    }     public function extendImplicit $rule, $extension, $message =         null     {       $this->implicitExtensions[$rule] = $extension;        if  $message  $this->fallbackMessages[snake_case $rule ] =            $message;    }     public function replacer $rule, $replacer     {       $this->replacers[$rule] = $replacer;    }     public function resolver Closure $resolver     {       $this->resolver = $resolver;    }     public function getTranslator      {       return $this->translator;    }     public function getPresenceVerifier      {       return $this->verifier;    }  [ 60 ]      public function setPresenceVerifier PresenceVerifierInterface        $presenceVerifier    {       $this->verifier = $presenceVerifier;    }  }  As we can see in the preceding code, the Validation Factory class is constructed  with the Translator class and an IoC container. The addExtensions   function  is set after this. This method includes the user-defined extensions to a Validator  instance, thus allowing us to write the template  structure  to create the Validator  class's extensions. The functions, which are public, allow us to implement the  Translator class, and by this we mean that they allow us to write custom validation  rules and messages. Refer to the following CarFactory diagram:  SuzukiFactory  Suzuki  ToyotaFactory  Toyota  CarFactory  CarAssembler  Car  In the preceding diagram, you can see that all cars are based on CarFactory    the basics of all cars , regardless of the brand. For all brands, the main process is the  same  all cars have an engine, tires, brakes, bulbs, gear, and so on . You may want  either a Suzuki car or a Toyota car, and depending on this choice, the SuzukiFactory  or ToyotaFactory creates a Suzuki car or a Toyota car from the CarFactory.  The Repository pattern The Repository pattern is usually used to create an interface between two distinct  layers of an application. In our case, the developers of Laravel use this pattern to  create an abstract layer between NamespaceItemResolver  the class that resolves the  namespaces and understands which file is in which namespace  and Loader  a class  that requires and loads another class into the application . The Loader class simply  loads the given namespace's configuration group. As you might know, nearly all of  the Laravel Framework code is developed using namespaces.  [ 61 ]   The need for the Repository pattern Let's assume you're trying to fetch a product from your database using Eloquent  ORM. The method will be something like Product::find 1  in your Controller.  For abstraction purposes, this approach is not ideal. If you now put a code such as  this, your Controller knows you're using Eloquent, which ideally shouldn't happen  in a good and abstracted structure. If you want to contain the changes done to the  database scheme so that the calls outside of the class do not reference to the fields  directly but through a repository, you have to dig all codes one by one.  Now, let's create an imaginart repository interface  a list of methods that will be  used in the pattern  for the users. Let's call it UserRepository.php:  <?php namespace Arda\Storage\User;   interface UserRepository {        public function all  ;     public function get  ;     public function create $input ;     public function update $input ;     public function delete $input ;     public function find $id ;  }  Here, you can see that all the methods' names used in the Model are declared one by  one. Now, let's create the repository and name it EloquentUserRepository.php:  <?php namespace Arda\Storage\User;   use User;   class EloquentUserRepository implements UserRepository {     public function all     {     return User::all  ;   }     public function get     {  [ 62 ]       return User::get  ;   }     public function create $input    {     return User::create $input ;   }    public function update $input    {     return User::update $input ;   }    public function delete $input    {     return User::delete $input ;   }    public function find $input    {     return User::find $input ;   }   }  As you can see, this repository class implemented our UserRepository that we created  earlier. Now, you need to bind the two so that when the UserRepositoryInterface  interface is called, we actually acquire EloquentUserRepository.  This can be done either with a service provider or by a simple command, such as the  following, in Laravel:  App:bind     'Arda\Storage\User\UserRepository',    'Arda\Storage\User\EloquentUserRepository'  ;  Now, in your Controllers, you can simply use the repositories as Use Arda\ Storage\User\UserRepository as User.  [ 63 ]   Every time the controller uses a User::find $id  code, it first goes to the interface,  and then goes to the binded repository, which is the Eloquent repository in our  case. Through this, it goes to the Eloquent ORM. This way, it's impossible for the  Controller to know how the data is fetched.  The Strategy pattern The best approach to describe the Strategy pattern is through a problem.  The need for the Strategy pattern In this design pattern, the logic is extracted from complex classes into easier  components so that they can be replaced easily with simpler methods. For example,  you want to show popular blog posts on your website. In a classic approach, you  will calculate the popularity, make the pagination, and list the items relative to the  current paginated offset and popularity, and make all calculations in a simple class.  This pattern aims to separate each algorithm into separate components so that they  can be reused or combined in other parts of the application easily. This approach also  brings flexibility and makes it easy to change an algorithm system wide.  To understand this better, let's take a look at the following loader interface located at  vendor Illuminate Config LoaderInterface:  <?php namespace Illuminate\Config;  interface LoaderInterface {     public function load $environment, $group, $namespace = null ;     public function exists $group, $namespace = null ;      public function addNamespace $namespace, $hint ;     public function getNamespaces  ;     public function cascadePackage $environment, $package, $group,  $items ;  }  [ 64 ]   When we dig the code, the LoaderInterface works will follow a certain structure.  The getNamespaces   function loads all namespaces defined in the app\config\ app.php file. The addNamespace   method passes the namespaces to the load    function as grouped. If the exist   function returns true, there is at least one  configuration group that belongs to a given namespace. For the full structure,  you can refer to the repository section of this chapter. As a result, you can easily  call the method that you need through an interface of the Loader class to load  various configuration options. If we download a package through the composer, or  implement a package to an application that is being authored, the pattern makes all  of them available and loads them from their own namespaces without any conflicts,  though they are inside different namespaces or have the same filenames.  The Provider pattern The Provider pattern was formulated by Microsoft for use in the ASP.NET Starter   Kits and formalized in .NET Version 2.0  http:  en.wikipedia.org wiki  Provider_model . It is a mid layer between an API class and the Business   Logic Data Abstraction Layer of the application. The provider is the implementation  of the API separated from the API itself.  This pattern, its aims, and its usage are quite similar to the Strategy pattern. This is  why many developers are already discussing whether to accept this approach as a  design pattern.  To understand these patterns better, let's open vendor Illuminate  Auth AuthServiceProvider.php and vendor Illuminate Hashing  HashServiceProvider.php:  <?php namespace Illuminate\Auth;  use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;  class AuthServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {     protected $defer = true;     public function register      {       $this->app->bindShared 'auth', function $app        {               Once the authentication service has actually been                requested by the developer              we will set a variable in the application indicating               this, which helps us  [ 65 ]                to know that we need to set any queued cookies in the               after event later.          $app['auth.loaded'] = true;            return new AuthManager $app ;       } ;    }     public function provides      {       return array 'auth' ;    }  }  }  <?php namespace Illuminate\Hashing;  use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;  class HashServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {     protected $defer = true;     public function register      {       $this->app->bindShared 'hash', function   { return new           BcryptHasher; } ;    }     public function provides      {       return array 'hash' ;    }  As you can see, both the classes extend ServiceProvider. The AuthServiceProvider  class allows us to provide all services to AuthManager when an authentication request,  such as checking whether a cookie and session is created or whether the content is  invalid, is sent. After the authentication service has been requested, the developer can  define whether a session or cookie is set through the response through AuthDriver.  [ 66 ]   However, HashServiceProvider provides us with the related methods when a  secure hash request is done so that we can use, fetch, check, or do other things with  these hashes. Both providers return the values as an array.  The Facade pattern The Facade  façade  pattern allows a developer to unite various complicated  interfaces into a single class interface. This pattern also allows you to wrap   various methods from various classes into a single structure.  Client  Facade  Class  Class  Class  Class  Class  Class  In Laravel 4, as you may already know, almost every method looks like a static  method, for example, Input::has  , Config::get  , URL::route  , View::make  ,  and HTML::style  . However, they are not static methods. If they were static  methods, it would be quite hard to make tests for them all. They are actually the  mimics of this behavior. In the background, with the help of the IoC Container  a way  to inject dependencies into a class , Laravel actually calls another class es  through a  Facade class. The Facade base class benefits from PHP's own __callStatic   magic  method to call the required methods, such as static methods.  Class  Class  [ 67 ]   For example, let's assume we have a method called URL::to 'home' . Let's check  what the URL is and what it refers to. First, let's open app config app.php. In the  aliases array, there is a line like the following:  'URL' => 'Illuminate\Support\Facades\URL',  So, if we call URL::to 'home' , we actually call Illuminate\Support\Facades \ URL::to 'home' .  Now, let's check what's inside the file. Open the vendor Illuminate Support  Facades URL.php file:  <?php namespace Illuminate\Support\Facades;  class URL extends Facade {     protected static function getFacadeAccessor   { return 'url'; }  }  As you can see, the class actually extends from the Facade class, and there is no  static method called to  . Instead, there is a method called getFacadeAccessor  ,  which returns the string url. The getFacadeAccessor   method's purpose is to  define what to inject. This way, Laravel understands that this class is looking for  $app['url'].  This is defined in vendor Illuminate Routing RoutingServiceProvider.php,   as follows:  protected function registerUrlGenerator   {    $this->app['url'] = $this->app->share function $app        {        $routes = $app['router']->getRoutes  ;        return new UrlGenerator $routes, $app->rebinding 'request',           function $app, $request        {          $app['url']->setRequest $request ;       }  ;    } ; }  [ 68 ]   As you can see, it returns a new instance of the UrlGenerator class in the same  namespace, which holds the to   method we're looking for:    Illuminate Routing UrlGenerator.php public function to $path, $extra = array  , $secure = null  {      ... }  So each time you use a method like this, Laravel first goes to and checks the facade, it  then checks what's injected through, and then the real method through the injected  class is called.  Summary In this chapter, we learned about various design pattern uses in the Laravel PHP  framework, how and why they are used, and what problems they can solve.  In the next chapter, we'll learn about best practices to create an application using  Laravel using the design patterns in our code in a Laravel project.  [ 69 ]    Best Practices in Laravel  In this chapter, we will see examples of various previously-described design patterns  used in Laravel.  The topics that will be discussed in this chapter are as follows:     Basic and advanced practices    Real-life examples of design patterns used in Laravel    The reasons why these design patterns are used in the examples  Basic practices As a developer, when you are working on an application, there should be a  systematic order to things to prevent confusion and allow flexibility. For example, in  an MVC architecture, Controller should only hold the logic and Model should only  hold dataflow-related stuff. You should not write database queries in View files. This  way, anyone working on the project can find what they are looking for easily and can  change, fork, or improve it with greater ease. If this is not followed, the project will  turn into a mess as it gets bigger and bigger.  A basic good practice would be to avoid repeating yourself. If you're using a code  snippet or a condition a number of times, it'd be better for you to prepare a method  or a scope for that action. This way, you wouldn't have to repeat yourself over and  over. For example, let's say we have an imaginary Controller as follows:  <?php  class UserController extends BaseController {       An imaginary method that lists all active users    public function listUsers   {   As you can see, the where   condition checks if active is repeated twice. In   real-world examples, it would be used even more.  To prevent this, in Laravel, you can use query scopes. Query scopes are single  functions that help you reuse the logic in Models. Let's define a query scope in Model  and change the Controller method as follows:        $users = User::where 'active', 1 ->get  ;        return View::make 'frontend.users.list'           ->with 'users', $users ;    }       An imaginary method that finds a specific user    public function fetch $id  {        $user = User::where 'active', 1 ->find $id ;         return View::make 'frontend.users.single'           ->with 'user', $user ;     }  }  <?php  }    Model File Class User extends Eloquent {       We've defined a Query scope called active    public function scopeActive $query  {       return $query->where 'active', 1 ;    }    Controller File class UserController extends BaseController {       An imaginary method that lists all active users    public function listUsers   {        $users = User::active  ->get  ;  [ 72 ]         return View::make 'frontend.users.list'           ->with 'users', $users ;    }       An imaginary method that finds a specific user    public function fetch $id  {        $user = User::active  ->find $id ;        return View::make 'frontend.users.single'           ->with 'user', $user ;     }  }  As you can see, we've defined a method called scopeActive   in Model, which is  prefixed with the word scope and CamelCased. This way, Laravel can understand that  it's a query scope, and you can use that scope directly. As you can see, the conditions   in the Controller have also changed. They have changed from where 'active', 1    to active  .  Design patterns are advanced practices and can be used to keep the code tidy and  systematic using various approaches.  Advanced practices In this subsection, we will see various design patterns' usage in Laravel. If you test  the custom classes that include the design patterns, which are provided within the  book, they should be autoloaded in your application. This can be done either by  adding them to the ClassLoader::addDirectories   array of the global.php  file  which can be found by navigating to app start  or the start.php file in the  bootstrap folder. Alternatively, we can add a psr-0 autoload in composer.json.  To add directories from app start global.php, first find the following code:  ClassLoader::addDirectories array      app_path  .' commands',    app_path  .' controllers',    app_path  .' models',    app_path  .' database seeds',    ;  [ 73 ]   Then add your folders below. The resulting code will look as follows:  ClassLoader::addDirectories array      app_path  .' commands',    app_path  .' controllers',    app_path  .' models',    app_path  .' database seeds',       our custom directory that holds classes    app_path  .' acme',   ;  If you want to autoload classes or files from the composer.json file using the psr-0  autoload, you have to add the namespace and directory into composer.json. The key  will be the namespace and the value will be the path of the folder that holds the files  and classes to be autoloaded. Have a look at the following code:  "autoload": {      "psr-0": {         "Acme": "app lib"     } }  In this example, if our composer.json file doesn't have a psr-0 object, first we'll  create it and then add the namespace and the path values inside. You can see we  have a namespace called Acme, which is under the folder app lib.  If you don't want to autoload a whole folder but only a few single files, you can also  use the files object in composer.json. It's a single object that only holds the paths  of files.  "autoload": {     "files": [         "app acme myFunctions.php"     ] },  After adding these values, you need to dump the autoload files and make Laravel  understand them. To do this, after editing the composer.json file, simply run the  following command:  composer dump-autoload  [ 74 ]   You can also run the following command if the composer is not installed in   your environment:  php composer.phar dump-autoload  After this, the classes or files that you've just added will be autoloaded and available  for your project.  The Factory pattern As you might recollect from Chapter 5, Design Patterns in Laravel, the Factory pattern  is based on creating template method objects to implement an algorithm. Let's  assume we are developing the following application:  SuzukiFactory  Suzuki  ToyotaFactory  Toyota  Let's assume the Toyota brand only produces C-class red cars, and the Suzuki brand  only produces B-class green cars. Let's assume we have a Model for this purpose that  is defined as follows:  class CarFactoryModel extends BaseModel{      public static function createCar $manufacturer      {         switch  $manufacturer          {  <?php          }  CarFactory  CarAssembler  Car  [ 75 ]           throw new \InvalidArgumentException "Unsupported manufacturer  [$manufacturer]" ;     }      public static function createCarFromColor $color      {         switch  $color          {             case 'Red':              return static::createCar 'Toyota' ;              case 'Green':              return static::createCar 'Suzuki' ;          }          throw new \InvalidArgumentException "Unsupported color  [$color]" ;     }      public static function createCarFromClass $class      {         switch  $class          {             case 'B':              return static::createCar 'Suzuki' ;              case 'C':              return static::createCar 'Toyota' ;         }          throw new \InvalidArgumentException "Unsupported car class  [$class]" ;      } }  [ 76 ]   As you can see, in this approach, the same carFactory   class is called for both  Suzuki and Toyota because in this example both brands would have the same  processes to create the core of the car. The quality-class and color are set after the  core of the car is produced. After this is set, for the color and quality-class choices,  we can directly call the corresponding class with its brand. Let's say we are going to  buy a B-class car. Now, because the code knows which brand produces B-class cars,  it will directly call Suzuki. This Model can have a Controller like the one seen in the  following code:  class CarController extends BaseController{      public function showCarsByManufacturer $manufacturerName {          return CarFactory::createCar $manufacturerName ;  <?php      }      }      }  }      public function showCarsByColor $color {          return CarFactory::createCarFromColor $color ;      public function showCarsByClass $className {          return CarFactory::createCarFromClass $className ;  The three different routes of this approach are as follows:  Route::get  'cars {manufacturer}',  array  'as'   'uses' => 'CarController@showCarsbyManufacturer'    ;  => 'cars_by_manufacturer',   [ 77 ]   Route::get  'cars color {color}',  array  'as' => 'cars_by_color', 'uses' => 'CarController@showCarsbyColor'    ;  Route::get  'cars class {class}', array  'as' => 'cars_by_class', 'uses' => 'CarController@showCarsbyClass'    ;  In such situations, in addition to the Factory pattern, having an approach like these  three routes would be a good practice for URL richness, ease of use, and improved  search engine optimization of the website.  The Builder pattern We discussed in Chapter 5, Design Patterns in Laravel, that, in a way, the Builder  pattern is an approach to separate bigger objects into smaller ones and make them  available for reuse. In this subsection, as in the example in Chapter 5, Design Patterns in Laravel, let's assume  we are baking a pizza that has certain properties, such as Italian and small big:  c  Pizza  1 1  >  c PizzaBuilder  1  1  c Waiter  c ChinesePizzaBuilder  c AsianPizzaBuilder   >   >   >  c Client  Let's assume we have an autoloaded class as follows:  <?php  class PizzaDelivery {  [ 78 ]       protected $pizza;      protected $config = array  ;      public function __construct array $config      {         $this->pizza = new PizzaBuilder  ;         $this->setConfig $config ;     }       **     * Process some configuration parameters     *     * @param array $config     *      protected function setConfig array $config      {         $defaults = array              'spice' => true,             'type' => 'Italian',             'size' => 'Small',          ;          $config =  array_replace $defaults, $config ;         $this->config = $config;     }       **     * Build the pizza using the supplied configuration parameters     * From the constructor that is set using setConfig   method.     *      * @return null     *      public function build       {         foreach  $this->config as $option => $value  {             $method = sprintf 'set%s', ucfirst $option  ;             if  method_exists $this->pizza, $method  === true  {                 call_user_func array $this->pizza, $method ,                     $value ;             }  [ 79 ]   As you can see, we have injected a builder, the PizzaBuilder class, which includes  two chefs: one is an Italian pizza maker and the other is an Asian pizza maker. The  PizzaBuilder class in this approach can be coded as follows:          }     }       **     * @return Pizza     *      public function getPizza       {         return $this->pizza;     } }  <?php class PizzaBuilder {     protected $type = '';     protected $size = '';     protected $spice = '';     public function setSpice $spice      {         $this->spice = $spice;     }      public function setSize $size      {         $this->size = $size;     }      public function setType $type      {         $this->type = $type;     } }  [ 80 ]   As you can see, it holds all the basic stuff to bake a pizza, but the properties are  defined outside the class, through the Model using methods such as setType    and setSize  . With this approach, by only defining the properties and without  thinking about the rest, we can build and get our pizza directly from the waiter   PizzaDelivery . If we need to get an Asian pizza, we'd call the following code  anywhere in our application:  $myFavoritePizza = new PizzaDelivery array 'type' => 'Asian'  ; $myFavoritePizza ->build  ; return $myFavoritePizza->get  ;  The Strategy pattern As you might recall from Chapter 5, Design Patterns in Laravel, the Strategy pattern is  used to divide the logic into smaller parts according to their tasks so that these parts  can be reused.  In the sample application we'll code for this approach, we will make a package  shipment calculation application for different package carriers. Let's assume we   have a class like the following:  interface ShipmentPricingStrategy {      function shipmentPrice  ;  <?php  }  abstract class ShippingPriceStrategy implements  ShipmentPricingStrategy {     function __construct   {}     abstract function shipmentPrice  ; }  class FedexPriceStrategy extends ShippingPriceStrategy {      function shipmentPrice   {         return 4.95;     } }  class UpsPriceStrategy extends ShippingPriceStrategy {  [ 81 ]       function shipmentPrice   {         return 3.75;     } }  class Shipping {      public $shipping_pricing_structure;      function __construct ShippingPriceStrategy $shipment_pricing_ strategy  {          $this->shipping_pricing_structure = $shipment_pricing_ strategy;      } }  As you can see in the code, in the Shipping class, we have injected  ShippingPriceStrategy. This Strategy pattern has features for each carrier   shipmentPrice   in our case . With this approach, for different shipping carriers,  we can show different delivery prices and include them in our shipping process,  which will be defined in our Shipping class. This way, we've used the prices set in  the Strategy pattern both when showing the shipping price and counting a sum total  for the shipping process.  By assuming that the class is autoloaded, we can use the class that has the Strategy  pattern in an example like this:  <?php  $cart_total = 77.90;  $fedex_price = new Shipping new FedexPriceStrategy   ;  $ups_price = new Shipping new UpsPriceStrategy   ;  $ups_price_with_cart = $cart_total+$ups_price->shipping_pricing_ structure->shipmentPrice  ;  $fedex_price_with_cart = $cart_total+$fedex_price->shipping_pricing_ structure->shipmentPrice  ;  echo 'The cost of this order with Fedex is: '.$fedex_price_with_ cart."\n";  echo 'The cost of this order with UPS is: '.$ups_price_with_cart."\n";  [ 82 ]   As you can see, for the same shipping process  the Shipping class , by injecting  different shipping strategies for the two brands, we've managed to gain different  shipping prices due to the difference in their strategies.  The Repository pattern The main reason to use a Repository pattern is to provide abstraction and flexibility.  For example, let's say you are fetching a product from the database. By default, in  Laravel, the usual way is to use Eloquent ORM in Controller and to pass it to the  View. This way, your Controller knows that you are using Eloquent ORM to fetch  data from the data source   database. For small applications, this should be no  problem, but in bigger applications, an issue might occur. In future, for some reason,  you might want to drop MySQL using Eloquent ORM and might need to use another  ORM in MongoDB. When this happens, because the Controller knows that you are  using Eloquent ORM, you'll have to dig each Controller  or any other layer  one by  one and change them. Another limitation is that you cannot unit test this code.  This would not happen if you had used repositories. If you do this, the Controller  would connect only with the repository, and the repository would handle the other  regarding layers. Therefore, the Controller wouldn't know how the data was fetched   abstraction . This way, on bigger applications, managing stuff or testing stuff should  be much easier.  To understand this approach, first let's assume we have the ProductsController  and Product models, and we want to fetch a product with a given ID and another  method to dump all products. The Controller would look something like this:  <?php  Class ProductsController extends \BaseController {     public function findProduct $id  {       $product = Product::find $id ;       return View::make 'product'           ->with 'product', $product ;    }     public function allProducts   {       $products = Product::all  ;       return View::make 'all_products'           ->with 'products', $products ;    }  }  [ 83 ]   There is a flaw in this approach. If you are testing code that is written like this and  there is an error, you can't directly detect what the source of the error is unless  Whoops  the error handler library used in Laravel  is active. Repositories are helpful  in situations like this because they extract the logic. To inject a repository, one way is  to define and set it in a constructor method of the Controller.  Let's name this repository EloquentProductRepository, which is part of the   \Acme\Repositories namespace. Our Controller would change into something   like the following:  <?php    We use the repository in our class use Acme\Repositories\EloquentProductRepository;  Class ProductsController extends \BaseController {       A protected variable to hold the Repository    protected $product;       Let's define a constructor class, and assigning to the        variable $product     public function __construct EloquentProductRepository $product       {       $this->product = $product;    }     public function findProduct $id  {         $product = Product::find $id ;       $product = $this->product->find $id ;       return View::make 'product'           ->with 'product', $product ;    }     public function allProducts   {         $products = Product::orderBy 'id', 'desc' ->get  ;         let's give it a unique method name       $products = $this->product->getNewest  ;       return View::make 'all_products'           ->with 'products', $products ;    }  }  [ 84 ]   Note that instead of making orderBy 'id', 'desc' ->get  , we have given a  new method name, getNewest  . Now let's create this repository. Let's assume we  have a file called EloquentProductRepository.php inside the namespace Acme\ Repositories folder. Have a look at the following code:  <?php namespace Acme\Repositories;  Class EloquentProductRepository {     public function getNewest   {        return \Order::orderBy 'id', 'desc' ->get  ;     }  }     public function find $id  {       return \Order::find $id ;    }  For each method that is used, you need to define functions once you are in the  repositories. A major advantage of this approach is that it brings flexibility. Let's  say you will be using mocks, or you'll switch from Eloquent ORM to another one in  future that has totally different method names. To switch your application's database  layer from Eloquent to MongoDB, if you've used repositories, you only need to  change the used repository in your Controllers, nothing else. You won't need to dig  all of your Controllers, Models, or other components.  There is still a feature lacking here. Our Controller still knows that we are using an  Eloquent-specific repository. For a better approach and abstraction, our Controller  should not know what kind of repository we are using. To ensure this, we will have  to code an interface for this.  Now, let's create an interface in the same namespace path  it is not forced; you may  create it anywhere as long as it's loaded  as ProductInterface. Our Controller  would then look like this:  <?php    We use the interface in our class use Acme\Repositories\ProductInterface;  Class ProductsController extends \BaseController {  [ 85 ]        A protected variable to hold the Interface    protected $product;       Let's define a constructor class, and inject the interface as        $product variable    public function __construct ProductInterface $product  {       $this->product = $product;    }     public function findProduct $id  {         $product = Product::find $id ;       $product = $this->product->find $id ;       return View::make 'product'           ->with 'product', $product ;    }     public function allProducts   {         $products = Product::orderBy 'id', 'desc' ->get  ;         let's give it a unique method name       $products = $this->product->getNewest  ;       return View::make 'all_products'           ->with 'products', $products ;    }  Instead of the repository, the interface is injected and used. Now let's code the  ProductInterface interface:  }  }  <?php namespace Acme\Repositories;  interface ProductInterface {     public function getNewest  ;    public function find  ;  As you can see, the interface holds the method names, which are actually the  methods available to the implemented repository. Now let's implement this   interface to our repository to connect them:  <?php namespace Acme\Repositories;  Class EloquentProductRepository implements ProductInterface {     public function getNewest   {  [ 86 ]         return \Order::orderBy 'id', 'desc' ->get  ;     }  }     public function find $id  {        return \Order::find $id ;    }  This implementation has an advantage. Let's assume that you've implemented an  interface in the repository and it is missing the getNewest   custom method. Thanks  to this implementation, the interface will directly let you know that it needs that  specific method and it's missing.  Lastly, we need to bind the interface to the repository. One of the ways to do this is  to use Laravel's built-in App:bind  ; method. To bind the repository that we've just  created to the interface, add this line into your app routes.php file or any other file  that's autoloaded.  App::bind  'Acme\Repositories\ProductInterface',  'Acme\Repositories\EloquentProductRepository'  ;  Another way to bind these two is to create a service provider. Let's write a service  provider as follows:  <?php namespace Acme\Repositories;   use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;   class UserServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {      public function register       {         $this->app::bind 'Acme\\Repositories\\ProductInterface',  'Acme\Repositories\EloquentProductRepository' ;     } }  We've assumed that this provider is in the namespace Acme\Repositories folder.  We've also used Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider to extend our class from it.  In the public method register, we've binded the interface to our product repository.  [ 87 ]   In future, if you want to switch to MongoDB or any other interface that you've  coded, all you have to do is switch EloquentRepositoryInterface to the new   one. It will be updated everywhere in the application.  Summary In this chapter, we saw examples of basic and advanced practices of design patterns  and architectures that are used both in Laravel and in general development  processes. We have learned the advantages of various design patterns while citing  real-world examples for each one of them.  Design patterns are there to make your life easier. If development is done without  following any pattern or architecture, as the application grows, both refactoring  and implementing features would be harder after each refactoring. Also, if another  developer joins the project, he or she first needs to understand what's where. This  will possibly cause bloating, bad performance, inflexibility, and a variety of errors  that are hard to fix. The application would be a time-bomb ready to explode. Design  and architectural patterns are there to help you prevent these issues. Not only in  your Laravel application, but in anything that you're developing, as the application  grows, to keep everything under control, you must use a design pattern or a  combination of them. In the end, there will be a day you'll thank yourself for using  these patterns.
