The	Deep	Web	Superpack:	The Ultimate	Anonymous	Collection  	  	  Lance	Henderson   Burners	&	Black	Markets   Preface Hell	hath	no	fury	like	a	woman	scorned. Scorned	might	be	the	wrong	word	choice	here,	since	it	was	I	who invited	the	Homeland	Security	agents	into	my	home. “Come	on	in,	the	water’s	warm,”	I	told	them. They	strolled	in	like	vampires.	It	felt	a	little	queasy	to	walk	behind them,	like	today	was	some	kind	of	initiation	day	or	something	and	I	was the	fresh	white	meat	of	the	month.	I	also	noticed	one	of	them	 the female 	humming	softly	as	she	came	in.	Some	death	row	harmonica	tune as	I	recall.	The	one	from	Shawshank	Redemption.	Or	was	it	The	Green Mile?To	be	honest	neither	resembled	Mulder	or	Scully	like	I	thought	they would	 nor	had	a	gun	that	I	could	see ,	but	it	didn’t	really	matter.	Both agents	sounded	professional;	suited	up	and	as	stone-faced	as	any	statue on	Easter	Isle	with	little	in	the	way	of	humor	or	human	warmth	that could	be	discerned.	Automatons	dressed	to	kill.	In	fact,	the	male	agent looked	every	bit	the	consummate	professional	hitman	Alberto	the Shadow	was	in	Scarface.	You	didn’t	turn	your	back	on	a	guy	like	that. Yet	here	I	was	contemplating	asking	them	to	leave	after	only	inviting them	in	a	nanosecond	ago.	Wasn’t	happening.	Worse	was	the	whiff	of	air my	nostrils	caught	scent	of	as	they	passed	me.	It	was	the	scent	of something	dead.	Or	maybe	just	the	last	guy	that	asked	them	to	leave. As	I	poured	a	drink	I	asked	myself,	were	they	real	agents?	I	couldn’t tell.	I	suppose	I	should	have	asked	for	ID	but	I	was	still	feeling	jet-lagged from	the	Rio	trip.	With	two	days	to	go	before	Mardi	Gras,	I’d	raced	home from	the	New	Orleans	airport	to	get	some	sleep	so	I	could	meet	my brother	to	fast-paint	an	Endymion	parade	float	at	mom’s	house.	Only	this time	I’d	be	late.	Terribly	late.	Because	vampires. A	fitting	end	I	suppose,	since	my	brother	Stephen	and	I	have	PhDs	in lateness.	Like	clockwork	I	had	waited	until	the	11th	hour	to	do	what Mom	tasked	us	with:	paint	the	Endymion	float	fast	and	neat	and	all	cool like	something	out	of	Willy	Wonka.	Only	fast	and	 neat	where	we	were   concerned	was	like	asking	the	Marx	brothers	to	do	a	rush	job	on	a	Mona Lisa	forgery.	I	could	paint	well	enough,	but	my	brother,	like	Groucho, painted	single-handedly	with	one	hand	holding	a	joint	as	the	other brushed.	Hustling	was	his	specialty,	not	painting.	He	hustled	everything. Even	me.He’d	often	give	me	a	list	of	places	where	his	friends	lay	in	wait	along Veterans	Blvd	near	New	Orleans,	friends	who	dressed	the	part	but	none of	whom	were	actually	veterans.	The	mission?	Bomb	them	with	the	best booty	and	beads	when	our	float	came	around.	Only	knowing	my	brother like	I	do,	he’d	brag	down	at	Igor’s	bar	long	and	loud	like	some	train	in	the night	and	take	all	the	credit.	I’d	get	nothing. The	man	never	gave	credit	for	squat	unless	he	was	in	trouble	with the	law.	Even	as	far	back	as	sixth	grade,	he’d	scoff	whenever	I	said	to knock	off	the	bar	bragging	in	the	school	yard.	It	never	helped.	Sooner	or later,	I	warned,	a	shark	would	come	along	and	sink	a	mouthful	of	teeth into	those	lying	teeth	of	his. Then	one	scorcher	of	a	day	in	August	 middle	school,	as	I	recall ,	a thresher	shark	showed	up	when	he	caught	the	attention	of	the	local police.	It	seemed	one	freckled	boy	told	every	other	boy	in	the	school	yard that	my	brother	had	bragged	he	owned	a	shed	containing	every automatic	weapon	imaginable,	even	 I	kid	you	not 	a	suitcase	nuke straight	out	of	Fallout.	They	all	bought	this	lie,	of	course,	only	one	of	the ugly	kids	he’d	teased	had	ratted	him	out.	Shocker,	right?	Next	thing	you know	our	puritan	principal	summoned	him	and	the	cops	and	when	the boys	in	blue	arrived,	they	cuffed	him	like	he’d	pinched	every	girl’s	pink bum	in	the	yard. I	sat	there	mumbling	and	trembling	in	Ms.	Needles	math	class thinking	I	was	next	on	the	hit	list.	Had	I	overheard	the	words	‘search warrant’?	And	that	odd	scent	that	one	of	the	cops	dragged	with	her.	A dead	animal?	No	not	quite.	It	reeked	of	a	dead	human. Truth	be	told	I	was	more	worried	about	my	secret	stash.	They’d steal	my	porn	stash	and	take	Suzanne	Somers	away	from	me	forever,	I was	sure	of	it.	Asses	would	sting	 mine 	and	if	not	by	Dad	than	surely that	sharkey	cop	with	the	razor-thin	mustache	whose	last	name	sounded an	awful	lot	like	‘thresher‘. But	my	brother	didn’t	rat.	They	suspended	him	and	Dad	hit	the	roof,   but	he	didn’t	rat.	Turned	out	that	my	father	pulled	some	strings	to	keep him	out	of	jail.	The	lucky	loser. Fast	forward	to	now,	in	my	living	room,	and	that	same	shark	cop from	sixth	grade	eying	me	in	perfect	dark;	her	eyes	filled	with	wet	Texas crude	looking	to	bury	a	dinosaur	like	me.	She’d	no	doubt	had	eaten	a	few dinosaurs	by	now,	slit	a	few	throats	on	the	way	to	the	top,	and	now	here she	was	staring	me	down	like	I	was	a	fresh-born	kitten	meant	for	the Coyote	grill.	Come	on	in,	the	water’s	warm,	I’d	said.	Stupid. Speaking	of,	my	brother	was	in	trouble	again.	A	deep	sea	of	trouble. It	seemed	that	he	had	targeted	hidden	Tor	sites	scattered	around the	Darknet,	playing	his	usual	lame	pranks,	when	in	one	instance	he	took it	too	far.	The	two	agents	came	because,	well,	Stephen	just	didn’t	know when	to	leave	on	a	high	note.	He	had	told	two	undercover	agents	that	he owned	an	underground	storage	bunker	full	of	illegals	that	he	sold	off	as sex	slaves	for	a	grand	a	pop.	A	side	hustle,	he	called	it.	I	knew	this	to	be	a prank,	but	they	did	not.	How	could	they? Only	now	the	very	shark	I’d	warned	him	about	had	come	back	to bite	 me.	Oh	irony.	Teaching	Tor	when	he	didn’t	understand	the	risks posed	by	Google	and	all	other	social	media	tyrants	was	a	colossal blunder	of	biblical	proportions	on	my	part.	A	terrible	mistake	and	one	I’d not	likely	recover	from.	It	was	like	handing	Frodo’s	Ring	of	Power	to	one of	those	guys	down	at	the	Bayou	Swamp	Tour	that	stick	their	heads	into the	mouths	of	crocs	for	a	few	dollars	more.	A	lot	of	fat	good	it’d	do. Oh	and	he	had	used	a	cell	phone.	Brilliant,	right? It	hadn’t	been	hard	to	track	the	goober	down.	Google	had	helped them	connect-the-dots.	Now	they	were	here	for	a	side	of	beef	off	my backside,	the	only	question	being	which	side. So	I	escorted	the	agents	into	my	kitchen	expecting	to	be	butchered by	my	own	knives.	I	politely	I	offered	them	a	beer	or	a	Coke	or	a	steak. Hell	even	a	three	month	old	Twinkie,	which	they	declined.	I	huffed	and then	straddled	a	bar	stool	and	invited	them	to	do	the	same.	Once	again they	declined.	They	could	not	be	bought,	bribed	or	bamboozled	for	any price.“This	won’t	take	long,”	the	male	agent	said.	It’s	what	all	agents	said, everywhere.	Even	the	census	taker	has	said	the	same	a	year	prior	and	as I	recall	it’d	taken	forever	and	a	day.	The	next	words	he	said	cut	like	dry   ice. “We	take	every	threat	to	this	nation	seriously,	Lance.	Your	brother has	made	some	serious	threats,”	said	the	taller	agent	as	he	crossed	his bulky	arms.	“He’s	in	our	custody	now	but	whether	he	stays	there depends	on	you.	In	this	very	instant.” Custody?	I	didn’t	believe	him.	“Do	tell,”	I	said	as	I	folded	my	skinny arms.“We’d	like	to	see	your	phone.” My	 heart	 stopped	 as	 all	 color	 drained	 face,	 all from	 my	 monochrome. “Ahem.	Right	now,”	added	the	female	agent.	It	was	then	that	I	asked for	ID.	They	showed	it	but	it	was	too	late.	They	were	in	like	Flynn. “Prostitution	rings	carry	a	hefty	sentence	as	does	issuing	threats	to federal	law	enforcement	officers,”	the	agent	began	to	say,	“…	and	even dumping	manure	on	our	department’s	front	lawn.” He	glanced	around	the	kitchen,	running	his	hand	along	the	granite countertop. “Asset	forfeiture	is	a	big	industry	these	days.”	He	knocked	on granite.No	shit,	I	thought.	Asset	forfeiture,	courtesy	of	the	ATF	and	DEA,	had been	a	very	profitable	industry	for	eons	and	all	the	more	for	the	US government.	I’d	known	guys	with	small	basement	grow-ops	that	lost their	homes	and	land	to	the	Feds	both	in	Canada	and	the	States.	I	took nothing	for	granted	where	those	guys	were	concerned. But	I	knew	not	to	talk	without	a	lawyer	present…	except	I’d	already invited	them	in	and	like	true	vampires	it	became	apparent	that	they weren’t	keen	on	leaving	without	the	item	they	came	for.	Why	oh	why	me. With	my	voice	quaking	I	let	out	a	little	protest	that	ended	up	sounding more	like	a	mew	instead	of	a	roar.	A	cat	going	to	the	vet. “I’m	not	giving	you	my	phone,”	I	squeaked.	“I	don’t	care	what	kooky story	my	idiot	brother	told	you.” “Excuse	me?”	the	lady	asked.	She	giggled	at	this,	a	giggle	that sounded	like	a	cat	chewing	up	a	squishy	mouse	or	toothpaste	squeezed out	of	a	tube.	“You	cannot	win	against	the	federal	government.	Hand	it over.”“Hand	what	over?”   “THE	PHONE.” ”	Oh,	that.	Err…	No.” “No?	Why	not?”	she	asked. I	stabbed	a	finger	at	her	just	as	I	raised	my	voice.	“Either	make	an arrest	or	leave!	I’ll	not	be	bullied	into	submission	without	a	warrant	by	a couple	of	federal	thugs	named	Frick	and	Frack.	My	phone	is	encrypted	so it’ll	do	you	no	good	anyway.	But	I’ve	got	a	landline	here	and	my	lawyer on	retainer	so	let	me	just	call	him	up	and	get	a	recording	going.” They	both	looked	at	each	other.	“We’ll	be	back,”	the	man	said.	As they	closed	the	door	I	heard	the	lock	slide	into	place	like	a	jail	cell slamming	home.	My	cell	phone	was	about	to	become	my	jail	cell.	Had	I hammered	the	last	nail	into	my	own	coffin? Furiously	I	sped	over	to	my	brother’s	house,	so	fast	I	nearly	hit	a	dog peeing	on	a	fire	hydrant	and	didn’t	stop	to	look	back.	I	was	livid.	Beyond livid.	I	had	no	clue	if	Agent	Frick	would	be	back,	warrant	in	one	hand	and a	noose	in	the	other,	but	I’d	be	damned	if	I	was	going	to	swing	from	the nearest	tree	without	knowing	what	stupid	thing	my	brother’d	done	to bring	on	this	level	of	heat. I	found	him	parked	outside	his	spooky	old	house	in	that	fire-engine red	truck	I’d	hated	for	years,	AC-DC	blaring	Back	in	Black.	He	was twirling	his	pornstache,	no	worry	in	the	world	about	his	fate	or	mine. Typical.	I	wanted	to	smack	him.	Hard.	Right	upside	his	head	the	way	Rick James	did	to	a	few	tag-a-longs	back	in	the	80s.	But	I	stopped	when	I	saw Facebook	front	and	center.	Not	only	 that	abomination	but	Twitter, Google	Plus,	Skype,	Viber	and	Whatsapp,	with	Tor	running	in	the background. Tor!	Sweet	lawd	almighty. I	grit	my	teeth	and	shouted	“DUMMY!”	into	his	ear	and	watched	as his	phone	fell	into	his	Bud	Light	glass	under	the	hot	pink	fuzzy	dice.	He cursed	me	out. “Azzzzhole,”	he	yelled.	He	wiped	it	off,	waterproof.	Gangly	and unshaven,	he	talked	like	that	skinny	gyro	captain	loser	from	Road Warrior	who	believed	in	the	concept	of	shared	wealth	-	as	long	as	it belonged	to	someone	else	and	was	his	for	the	taking. “Couple	of	goons	hassled	me	today,”	he	mumbled.	“Same	here… brother.”	I	replied.	“Somethin’	about	you	making	threats?	And…	a	manure   dump	on	a	federal	building’s	front	lawn?” After	a	long	sigh,	a	belch	and	a	few	coarse	threats	I	finally	dragged the	intel	out	of	him.	How	he’d	not	only	issued	threats	over	Tor	but	that he’d	put	in	an	order	for	a	dump	truck	to	pile	a	ton	of	manure	on	the	FBI and	Homeland	Security’s	front	lawn	using	a	credit	card	over	Tor.	 My credit	card.	He	pulled	it	from	his	wallet	and	frisbeed	it	into	my	face	with the	stupidest	comment	I’d	ever	heard. “Tor	didn’t	work	with	your	card.	You	ain’t	paid	up	or	somethin‘?” It	was	here	that	I	went	dark	on	him. I	pulled	the	knuckle-dragger	out	and	inside	the	house	kicking	and screaming	before	letting	loose	with	every	curse	I	knew.	He	flailed	like	the swordfish	we	caught	in	the	Gulf	of	Mexico,	fins	everywhere	like	a	crazy person,	swinging	and	sweating	and	stabbing. When	we	finally	simmered	down	I	noticed	the	state	of	his	living room.	The	place	was	ransacked	more	than	usual.	Beer	cans	piled	high with	a	vacant	space	where	the	PC	had	been	lie	visible.	Three	guesses	as to	who	took	it.	The	FBI	had	come	and	let	it	slide	but	apparently	they	had friends	in	Homeland	who	needed	a	fresh	piece	of	meat.	Two	slabs actually,	order	up. When	I	pressed	him	on	it	he	replied	that	Homeland	carted	it	away while	powered	on	using	a	portable	power	source	of	some	kind.	I	knew about	such	things,	but	did	he?	Nope.	This	is	the	Gyro	Captain	guy.	The fool	who	liked	to	say	‘Don’t	play	me	the	fool!’	guy. He	tried	to	get	up	so	I	shoved	him	back	down	and	yelled,	“You	stay in	that	spot	and	don’t	you	move	a	muscle	until	I’m	finished!” I	threw	everything	I’d	said	the	week	prior	into	his	face	again	 opsec stuff	mostly ,	and	swore	I’d	take	mom’s	house	back	in	a	New	York	minute if	he	didn’t	listen	this	time.	It	wasn’t	enough	that	his	ass	and	ego	stung. He	needed	a	lobotomy. “You’re	good	at	that	nekkid	Tor	stuff.	I	ain’t!	‘Sides,	you	talk	too	fast how	in	hell	can	I	keep	up	with	that	technical	mojo?” He	was	right.	I	always	talked	too	fast	even	back	in	sixth	grade	and	on a	few	sweaty	occasions	I	could	swear	that	I	could	literally	see	my	words flying	over	and	around	his	uncombed	head;	like	if	you	shined	a	flashlight through	those	ears	you’d	see	his	eyes	flash.	So	I	went	slow.	Turtle	slow. Talking	with	my	hands	like	some	Italian	piano	player	before	a	grand   performance. “Look,”	I	began.	“If	you’re	going	to	play	the	Riddler	and	prank alphabet	agencies	then	the	absolute	least	you	can	do	is	to	muck	it	all	up in	your	own	name	and	do	so	with	some	residue	of	competence.	It’s embarrassing	when	my	name	comes	into	it.	Why’d	you	use	my	card	for it?	Why	bring	me	into	it	at	all?” Nothing	but	deadbeat	excuses	came	back. My	voice	went	as	low	and	deadly	serious	as	a	neurosurgeon	when discussing	a	terminal	patient.	I	wanted	to	take	a	red	hot	searing	iron	of opsec	rules	to	his	butt	cheeks	but	knowing	him	he’d	forget	they	were there.	So	instead	I	decided	what	he	needed	was	a	foundation	of	the basics,	the	why,	the	wherewithal,	the	way,	the	whole	enchilada	when	it came	to	cell	phones	and	anonymity.	Why	we	do	this	instead	of	that	and what	happens	if	we	don’t. “Why?”	he’d	ask. “Because	guys	who	never	sweat	the	small	stuff	as	long	as	the	power button	is	greenlit	get	burned,	that’s	why.” Then	along	comes	some	taffer	with	a	badge	and	a	gruff	voice	who hits	him	with	one	small	threat	and	then	another	and	another,	and	all	in	a friendly	‘knock	and	talk’	and	at	that	point	he	might	as	well	slap	the	cuffs on	himself.	He	doesn’t	see	the	overall	context,	the	trap	being	set,	and ends	up	like	Gulliver	with	the	Lilliputians,	pinned	to	the	ground	by	a million	tiny	threads	he	can’t	even	see. I	talked	about	the	giants:	Google.	Twitter.	Facebook.	How	the	lying scumbags	were	little	more	than	modern-day	witch	hunters	who cooperated	with	cops	to	enforce	a	gazillion	laws	no	one	cared	about	but made	them	millions	every	year. I	droned	on	about	encryption,	explaining	how	it	always	worked	it’s wonders	if	it	was	automatic	and	running	under	the	hood.	I	told	him	he had	lazy	man’s	opsec,	a	clown’s,	and	that	sooner	or	later	someone	would throw	a	grenade	into	that	clown’s	wardrobe	and	it’d	make	all	the	papers with	nice	colorful	photos	of	his	private	stash	all	laid	bare.	I	told	him	of the	types	of	encryption	most	used,	HTTPS	in	the	browser	and	cell	to tower	connections	for	his	cellular	calls,	that	they	performed	so	well because	he	was	unaware	of	their	presence. “Encrypt	everything,”	I	repeated.	I	hammered	this	over	and	over,   especially	on	cell	phones	no	matter	if	he	had	something	to	hide	or	not.	“It should	be	there	and	working	its	magic	under	the	hood	without	you having	to	hit	the	ON	switch.” “Why?”	he	asked. “Because	if	you’re	only	going	to	flip	that	encryption	switch	when and	only	when	you	need	to	secure	your	data,	you	relay	that	data’s significance	as	though	you’d	pulled	a	fire	alarm.” We	talked	about	Tor	and	it’s	brother	Freenet	and	how	both	are	used by	Chinese	dissidents	but	that	since	every	Chinese	dissident	uses	those apps	that	this	has	caused	problems	for	anyone	wanting	real	anonymity.	If its	only	used	for	committing	dissident-like	things	then	China’s	ruling	elite class	can	cherry-pick	anyone	off	one	by	one	and	all	by	that	one	lone homing	signal.	The	same	that	the	FBI	had	done	 with	a	little	help	from my	credit	card . Then	I	said	that	the	reverse	is	equally	true. “If	everybody	employs	encryption	 everywhere,	then	instead	of	it being	a	signal	to	the	fire	department	to	come	put	out	a	fire,	it	becomes impossible	to	tell	who	is	using	it	to	chat	about	Leonardo	DeCaprio’s latest	round	of	clubgirls	from	someone	intent	on	sparking	a	revolution. Use	encryption	for	every	little	thing	you	do	and	you’ll	save	lives	on	the other	side	of	the	planet	without	even	knowing	it.” He	shot	me	a	dumbfounded	look	like	encryption	had	nothing	to	do with	cell	phones	or	Tor. “If	you’d	bothered	to	pay	attention	in	sixth	grade,	you’d	have learned	all	about	state-sanctioned	liars	like	the	Gestapo	in	Nazi	Germany and	KGB	in	Soviet	Russia,	enough	to	see	through	that	agent’s	lies.”	I pointed	to	the	door.	“Like	Agent	Frick.	Didn’t	her	name	seem	familiar	to you?”“You	shut	your	mouth!”	he	snapped.	“They	had	a	no-knock	warrant what	was	I	supposed	to	do,	tell	em’	to	get	lost?” “You	just	answered	your	own	question.” “Huh?” “You	shut	your	mouth.	You	said	it	brother.	You	don’t	say	squat without	an	attorney.” He	thought	on	this	for	a	long	while	before	I	continued. “Something	else,	too.	You	also	failed	on	account	of	having	an   unencrypted	phone	and	PC.	If	the	encrypted	data	is	in	your	hands	and	not theirs	you’re	in	less	danger	of	being	bullied	around.	You	have	more leeway.	Do	China	dissidents?	In	China	once	they	 take	 away	encryption and	guns,	they’ll	seize	your	property	rights,	birth	rights,	your	progeny and	what	follows	after	that	is	a	bloody	mutiny	or	complete	slavery	where all	legal	rights	are	changed	so	that	you	cannot	resist.	You	cannot	fight back.”“And	after	that?”	he	asked. “Who	knows.	The	Stalinist	regime	may	enact	a	murder	campaign	to eliminate	anyone	perceived	as	an	enemy	of	the	state.	That’s	anyone	with a	gun	or	encrypted	files.	You	saw	what	happened	to	all	those	screaming Muslims	over	there	in	Beijing	a	few	years	back.	They	rounded	up	all those	fools	and	shot	them	at	dawn	and	didn’t	look	back.” “Probably	didn’t	wait	till	dawn	I	reckon,”	he	said.	“They	ain’t	used encryption	though	is	what	I	heard.” I	smiled.	“Might	not	have	helped	anyway.	But	thank	God	for	the	5th amendment	in	the	United	States.” A	long	silence.	I	needed	one	more	example.	Something	modern. “Look	at	Apple	and	the	FBI.	The	Feds	wanted	to	set	a	precedent	in breaking	that	terrorist’s	phone.” “Precedent?	Why’s	that?”	he	asked. “Take	any	random	shooter’s	phone.	The	FBI	already	has	the	chat logs,	flash	drives,	and	iCloud	data	from	them.	They	just	make	those statements	to	get	public	support	for	backdoors	since	there’s	nothing	the data	on	the	iPhone	can	tell	them	that	they	don’t	know	already.” “But	if	that	happens…” “Everyone’s	screwed	a	hundred	ways	from	Sunday.	Apple	gave	the them	access	to	everything	that	exists	and	still	gave	them	additional forensic	advice	on	top	of	that.	That	fact	alone	proved	it	was	a	backdoor fishing	expedition.” “Yeah.	Yeah	yer	right	I	figger.” “And	it’s	impossible	for	a	backdoor	to	target	just	one	phone.	Any new	backdoor	will	target	everyone’s	phone,	every	class,	at	a	minimum, such	as	one	iPhone	5c	affecting	all	the	others.	The	FBI	wants	Apple	to code	in	a	backdoor	that’s	signed	by	Apple	without	messing	up	the decryption	keys.	Do	that	and	it	would	almost	certainly	escalate   international	tensions	about	European	privacy	too,	not	just	the	US.” He	nodded	slowly. “They’d	blot	out	any	hope	of	Safe	Harbor	for	good	by	proving	that safe	harbor	is	anything	but	‘safe‘.” Underneath	his	long-sleeved	shirt	I	could	see	he	was	wearing	a	that hideous	Lord	of	the	Rings	tee,	still	grey	and	ragged	and	reeking	of	the same	cheap	Bud	Light	Lime	he’d	swigged	on	opening	night.	At	the	tip	I could	 see	 it	 was	 either	 Gandalf	 or	 Saruman	 peeking	 over	 the mountaintops.	I	couldn’t	tell	which. “This	isn’t	Saruman	tinkering	around.	This	is	global	Sauron,	creating his	Ring.” “But	I’m	just	one	guy.	One	peon.” “You	only	need	one	guy,	one	peon.” I	pointed	out	the	window,	up	at	the	clouds.	“See	that?	Picture yourself	way	up	there	in	a	grand	hall	with	your	great-grandfather	and several	generations	of	your	lineage	going	back	eons	when	they’re	all telling	their	brave	tales.	Imagine	telling	them	with	a	straight	face	that you	left	it	up	to	some	other	peon	because	you	weren’t	up	to	learning	how to	evade	not	only	Google	but	the	NSA	and	the	FBI	because	it’s	easier	to just	focus	on	you	and	your	late	nights	blowing	money	on	anti-freeze daiquiris	and	Angry	Birds	or	Facebook	updates	and	pranking	the	FBI building	with	a	truckload	of	bullshit.” “Now	imagine	them	shaking	their	heads	in	disgust	at	this	overgrown kid	too	proud	to	build	out	a	fortress	of	doom	-	a	guy	whose	only	concerns were	for	his	own	hide	and	to	hell	with	what	his	forefathers	fought	for. They’d	view	you	as	lacking	courage	and	any	sense	of	ethics.	They’d	look upon	you	as	a	lesser	human	being.	A	joke	to	humanity.	A	sheep.	Can	you imagine	Frodo	doing	that	to	Elrond,	Gandalf,	Legolas	and	the	rest	of	the crew	and	giving	them	a	three-fingered	salute	as	he	slid	that	ring	down his	finger	and	snuck	off	into	the	night? “Hale	no.” “Me	neither.	When	push	comes	to	shove	it’s	our	nonactions	and	not our	actions	that	bury	us.	We	dig	our	own	graves	far	too	often	enough, brother,	so	let’s	not	pay	others	to	do	it	while	we’re	still	breathing.	In	the meantime	I’ll	show	you	how	to	smooth	that	ring	down	your	finger	so	you can	give	whoever	else	wants	to	spy	on	you	a	nice	three-fingered	salute.”   I	looked	over	and	noticed	a	few	synapses	misfiring.	But	a	little confusion	wasn’t	the	end	of	the	world.	So	I	showed	him	something	from his	favorite	social	media	outlet.	Youtube.	The	very	same	he’d	used	with Tor,	something	even	he	could	see	the	wisdom	of	employing.	It	was	a classroom	lecture	called	‘Don’t	Talk	to	Cops’.	Nothing	to	do	with	cell phones,	mind	you,	but	everything	to	do	 or	not	to	do 	when	a	couple	of	G- Men	show	up	at	your	house	making	unruly	demands. The	day	after	that,	I	beat	him	to	death	with	every	opsec	trick	I	knew on	how	to	truly	be	anonymous	on	a	smartphone,	be	it	Android, Blackberry,	iPhone…	anywhere,	at	any	time. And	what	I	showed	him	that	day	is	what	I’m	about	to	show	you. Right	now.   -	Bane,	The	Dark	Knight	Rises  Cell	Opsec	and	the	Powers	That	Be “No	one	cared	who	I	was	until	I	put	on	the	mask.” 	Why	The	Government	Hates	Anonymity Most	governments	hate	anonymity.	They	hate	encryption	too,	but mostly	anonymity	since	it	covers	a	much	broader	range	of	the	mutiny they	fear.	Every	time	someone	learns	how	to	communicate	anonymously, that	iron	death-grip	that	they	hold	on	a	person’s	life	loosens	like	you wouldn’t	believe.	The	media	paints	it	a	different	color,	of	course.	They say	that	it’s	anonymity	that	drives	all	the	internet’s	ills. You’ve	heard	it	all	before.	Sexual	harassment.	Bullying.	Date	rape. Hackers.	Identity	thieves.	Flying	purple	monkeys.	And	that	if	only	we give	the	powers	that	be	more	reach	or	a	longer	vine	into	our	private lives,	then	every	bully	and	ogre’ll	burst	into	pillars	of	salt	 instantly!  while	the	world	trips	right	into	a	land	of	rainbows,	unicorns	and	yellow submarines	with	a	lofty	lolling	Ringo	Starr	leading	the	charge. You	already	know	it	to	be	fake,	of	course.	As	fake	as	Data’s	artificial thumb.But,	I’ll	let	you	in	on	a	secret	not	many	know.	And	that	is	this. Anonymity	encourages	objectivity.	Seriously,	it	does.	It	forces	you	to judge	a	person	by	the	merits	of	their	words	alone. Think	about	it. How	many	times	have	you	heard	an	interview	of	some	new	jazz artist	or	guitarist	whose	Randy	Rhoads-like	riffs	made	your	hour	long commute	more	bearable,	but	somehow	lacked	that	one	ingredient	that’d make	them	perfect	in	your	mind’s	eye?	You	find	yourself	never	fully satisfied	with	what	you	know	of	him,	so	you	dig	deeper.	And	deeper. You	want	to	know	every	dirty	little	detail	of	his	life,	then	weigh  It’s	About	Control   those	details	against	his	opinion.	Little	details	like His	politics. His	religion. His	favorite	foods. Which	websites	he	likes	and	which	he	hates. What	movies	he	watches.	What	car	he	drives.	What	sexual preference	he	likes.	You	could	go	on	forever	nitpicking	the	poor	guy. And	it’s	dirty	ethics	to	judge	a	person’s	merit	in	this	way.	But	that’s the	way	the	global	elite	do	it,	every	day,	every	hour.	They	prefer	you make	snap	judgments	because	it	reveals	a	ton	of	things	about	you	as well.	Things	that	are	all	easily	trackable. Let’s	face	it. It’s	so	much	easier	to	blow	someone’s	idea	off	if	they	happen	to	be favoring	the	other	guy	running	for	President	rather	than	judge	a	person by	what	is	said.	So	they	focus	on	the	man’s	upbringing.	Or	race.	Or gender.	Or	which	side	their	ancestors	fought	on	during	the	Civil	War.	You can	get	to	a	point	where	you	run	out	of	ad	hominem’s	to	hurl. Dangerous	ideas	are	good	for	anonymity.	Try	saying	something outrageous	on	a	political	forum	during	an	election	year,	but	under	a pseudonym.	Use	a	cell	phone	without	the	aid	of	Tor.	Note	the	hesitation you	feel	when	you	think	of	writing	under	your	real	name	and	saying something	only	someone	like	Smaug	from	the	Hobbit	would	have	the red-hot	balls	to	say.	That’s	the	power	I’m	talking	about.	Anonymity grants	that	to	you.	It	allows	you	to	share	controversial	thoughts	without fear	of	your	house	being	firebombed	with	Molotov	cocktails	filled	with flaming	manure.	And	there’s	a	few	more	perks	I’ll	add	to	the	bonfire. Anonymity	prevents	you	from	getting	fired	for	disagreeing. It	prevents	Google	from	getting	your	private	data	and	selling	it. It	prevents	you	from	being	the	target	of	stalkers,	hitmen,	and even	an	angry	former	lover	intent	on	showing	the	world	the	raging  It’s	About	Power   alcoholic	she	lived	with	some	17	years	ago	-	never	mind	that	you’ve given	up	booze	for	ten	years	straight,	all	because	she	doesn’t	like	the guy	you’re	campaigning	for	 yes,	yours	truly . The	reason	why	people	are	opposed	to	anonymity	is	that	they	want to	bully,	harass	and	oppress	people	they	disagree	with.	It’s	because	it’s always	easier	to	discredit	the	man	than	his	ideas.	When	you	get	right down	to	it,	total	100%	honesty	can	only	be	accomplished	anonymously. “Well,”	you	start	to	say.	“You	don’t	need	security	if	you	aren’t	doing something	illegal.” But	that’s	how	they	want	you	to	think. It’s	like	saying	you	may	as	well	not	lock	your	door	unless	you’re	a thief.	Same	thing.	We	all	have	to	take	action	to	protect	our	families	and assets	from	those	who	steal,	harm	or	burn.	It’s	risk	versus	payoff,	and where	your	freedom	and	peace	of	mind	is	concerned,	the	payoff	is	always worth	it. Imagine	that	you	live	in	the	Ninth	Ward	in	New	Orleans,	hurricane season.	A	city	with	thousands	of	law	abiding	citizens	 and	maybe	10,000 criminals .	You	install	a	good	lock	on	your	front	door	because	it’s	wise	to do	so.	Likewise,	you	should	install	one	on	whatever	portal	you	use	to connect	to	the	Internet.	In	most	people’s	case,	this	means	their	cell phone.That	brings	up	the	dirty	word	called	encryption.	That	is,	encrypting your	connection.	All	connections,	but	cell	phones	especially.	Most	people shy	away	from	this	because	they	think	they	need	to	be	some	kind	of super-hacker	or	that	real	hackers	only	target	celebrities	like	Jennifer Lawrence. For	example,	if	Facebook	forgets	to	encrypt	your	data,	any governmental	agency	can	use	this	data	to	corral	dissidents	like	you	and	I and	those	who’d	make	bitter	enemies	in	the	event	of	a	revolution	-	all into	a	nice	little	easy-to-read	Matrix-green	display	for	a	round-up	when the	proverbial	crap	hits	the	fan.	This	isn’t	all.	Questions	like	“Who	was your	best	friend	in	high	school?”	can	lead	to	other	accounts	being compromised. It’s	the	same	whenever	I	have	to	shred	sensitive	documents.	Taxes, transcripts,	copies	of	old	love	letters,	copies	of	passports.	I	can	say	‘screw   it’	and	shred	only	a	few	things	since	I	hate	sorting	them	all.	But	all	it takes	for	my	security	model	to	collapse	is	one	broken	link	in	the	chain. Much	less	headaches	to	shred	EVERY	sensitive	document	and	gain	peace of	mind	over	having	to	sort	each	and	every	one	of	them. Therefore	it’s	best	to	learn	how	to	encrypt	everything	from	the beginning	instead	of	trying	to	cherry	pick	which	is	the	‘best’	document	to be	encrypted.	You	avoid	not	only	government	agencies	like	the	IRS	and DEA	but	also	stalkers,	vindictive	ex-spouses	and	former	business partners.	It’s	much	easier	to	lose	a	fully	encrypted	device	than	one	with only	a	few	encrypted	folders.	Encryption	is	not	just	about	preventing eavesdroppers	from	reading	data.	It	also	prevents	them	from	changing	it.   unknown	to	most	people	:	the	quality	or	state	of	being	anonymous.  Noun	an*o*nym*i*ty	\,a-n@-‘ni-m@-te\:	the	quality	or	state	of	being  Anonymity	and	Privacy Anonymity: 	Good	ol’	Webster,	who	never	fails	to	give	us	a	watered	down definition	on	how	to	not	do	something	of	paramount	importance.	The word	itself	comes	from	Greek	and	means	‘without	a	name’,	but	that doesn’t	really	tell	us	how	to	be	invisible.	Two	points	to	make	on	this. First,	if	we’re	talking	about	true	anonymity,	the	kind	where	you’re really	off	the	grid	and	can	stay	off	the	radar	even	if	a	Delta	Force	team	is sent	in	to	capture	you,	then	you’re	not	only	nameless	but	traceless.	This book	will	be	of	little	use	to	you	because	you’re	a	Houdini	already	and Houdinis	rarely	like	to	have	helpers.	They	prefer	going	it	alone.	It’s	the same	if	you’re	a	famous	old	timer	with	old	money,	celebrity	status	or fame	who	can	buy	your	way	out	of	the	country	without	a	passport. But	traceless	anonymity	-	which	many	believe	an	impossibility	on cell	phones	-	gets	harder	to	maintain	just	as	a	boat’s	navigation	wheel becomes	harder	to	control	in	a	thunderstorm.	One	jab	in	the	right	place will	sink	a	boat	just	as	surely	as	if	Zeus	himself	lit	one	up	in	her	backside and	it	won’t	matter	how	much	you	spent	on	polishing	her	tushy.	The same	happened	to	me	when	Hurricane	Katrina	slammed	home	in	2005. A	Category-5	hurricane,	also	known	as	the	‘finger	of	God’,	came pretty	close	to	sending	me	and	my	frizzy	cat	up	to	the	pearly	gates	on	a lightning	bolt. The	wind	barely	took	off	a	few	shingles	at	first.	No	big	deal	I	thought. It	happens	in	most	heavy	storms	after	all.	Then	the	kitchen	window shattered.	Then	another.	And	another.	Then	the	darkness	came,	only before	I	could	panic	I	heard	a	propane	tank	blow	up	in	the	garage.  Katrina   BOOM. I	know	what	you’re	thinking.	Propane	tanks	don’t	just	explode	or implode	or	rupture	or	come	apart	on	their	own.	In	fact,	an	exploding propane	tank	is	a	rarity	and	doesn’t	happen	nearly	as	often	as	the	zombie movies	portray.	Only	this	one	did	because	in	a	Cat-5	hurricane, anything’s	possible. Truth	be	told,	I	didn’t	care	about	the	tank.	I	was	more	worried	about the	darkness.	That	darkness	was	so	thick	you	could	feel	it	crawl	onto your	skin	like	some	tar-covered	gelatinous	monster	straight	out	of	The Thing.	I	looked	out	onto	the	street	and	I	remember	thinking	a	lot	of	fat good	anonymity	did	in	this	situation.	I	couldn’t	see	or	hear	squat	but	I could	worry.	Oh	yes,	on	that	I	was	an	ace,	the	top	of	the	class.	No question. I	tried	to	calm	myself	but	it	only	got	worse	as	I	couldn’t	remember where	I’d	put	the	candles	the	last	time	this	happened.	I	did	know	broken windows	were	replaceable	though.	They	were,	right?	Yes,	of	course. Besides,	how	many	times	had	the	electricity	gone	out	when	it	rained? Every	afternoon	if	you	lived	in	New	Orleans	and	it	seemed	to	happen	all the	time	no	matter	Mardi	Gras	or	Jazzfest	or	how	many	crocs	swam down	the	street	when	the	sewers	clogged	up.	You	could	set	your	watch by	it.Soon	I	had	two	feet	of	water	in	my	living	room	and	Fritz	the	cat	was looking	pretty	pathetic,	like	a	wet	hamster	who’d	stuck	it’s	paw	into	an electrical	socket.	Panicked,	the	meows	began	to	sound	like	those	wailing police	sirens	on	CSI.	I	couldn’t	understand	a	thing	and	to	be	honest	he sounded	a	lot	like	Charlie	Brown’s	teacher	after	a	smoke	and	a	stroke.	He wanted	out	as	did	I. I	looked	out	to	see	the	marina	sailboats	bobbing	like	bathtub	ducks when	the	howling	wind	began	to	whistle	and	whirl	through	every	room in	the	house,	with	a	couple	of	my	favorite	anonymity	books	floating	out the	front	door.	Bad	luck	or	poetic	justice? “Screw	these	shenanigans!”	I	said.	Who’d	ever	gamble	that	this storm	was	the	whisk-you-off-to-Oz	variety?	Not	me.	And	not	the	cat	as far	as	I	could	tell.	Only	a	moment	later,	it	got	worse.	A	lot	worse. The	storm	began	to	blow	in	a	lot	of	small	objects	from	the	street	up and	over	the	gutter.	Pine	cones.	Coke	cans.	A	Mardi	Gras	necklace	that’d   been	stuck	on	the	telephone	wire	for	ages.	Stripper	panties.	A	nuke- green	Hand	Grenade	drink	container	from	Tropical	Isle,	New	Orleans most	powerful	drink	which	admittedly	was	pretty	tasty	though	it	looked like	an	alien	sex	toy.	At	any	rate	I	was	in	for	some	serious	wind-based PTSD.And	with	so	many	holes	in	my	home,	something	struck	me.	I	realized that	any	passerby	could	see	inside	and	get	a	glimpse	of	my	goods.	All	of em.	I	was	unarmed	and,	God	help	me,	without	a	Rottweiler	to	fend	off any	looters.	Dead	man	walking.	The	looters	I’d	scared	off	during	the previous	flood	might	return	for	seconds	if	the	storm	got	bad	enough,	and this	time	I	was	sure	it	would.	Fritz	and	I	were	sitting	ducks	so	I	grabbed him	in	all	his	wet	tuxedo	fur	and	jumped	into	my	fire-engine-red	truck and	headed	off	to	the	Northshore	an	hour	away.	The	cat	was	now	down to	3	lives. First	Point:	The	first	point	is	that	one	weak	point	can	kill	any security	perimeter	you	thought	you’d	set	up	just	as	surely	as	my	own broken	windows	killed	mine.	Maybe	it	was	bad	electrical	lines.	Loose ones.	One	lightning	strike	ended	it.	Boom	and	done. With	only	one	window	gone	a	vagrant	 or	varmint	or	mutant  might’ve	peeked	inside	for	shelter	and	quickly	deduced	from	the	street garbage	that	it	was	an	abandoned	house.	With	every	window	gone,	that same	bum	doesn’t	have	to	peek	inside.	He	can	see	from	the	street	what I’ve	got.	No	guns?	No	dogs?	Nothing?	Oh	but	he	sees	the	display	case	with a	lot	of	shiny	objects	inside	that	he	can	pawn. Why,	even	a	brass	lantern	that’d	fetch	a	few	coins.	Later	I’d	return	to see	a	floating	corpse,	one	straight	out	of	The	Walking	Dead,	floating	near my	house.	I	never	quite	recovered	from	that	grisly	sight. In	any	case,	I	knew	I	couldn’t	sleep	there	since	it’d	be	like	using multiple	layers	of	condoms	given	by	an	ex-stalker.	Each	one	with	small holes.	What	did	help	me	was	having	walkie-talkies	at	my	disposal.	Not Tor.And	not	Skype	or	Google	Chat	or	any	other	corporate	solution, where	the	entirety	of	my	conversations	gets	sold	on	a	silver	platter	to	the highest	bidder.	Those	guys	have	only	their	own	interests	in	mind,	none	of which	involve	my	safety.	They	care	up	to	the	point	when	they	can	make truckloads	of	cash.	That	and	the	act	of	filing	away	those	conversations   into	stealthy	databases	and	mined	for	future	patterns	and	trends.	Trends on	me,	my	lover	and	dog	and	cat. So	you	don’t	owe	Microsoft	or	Google	or	Apple	anything.	But	it’s	in your	best	interest	to	learn	how	to	live	without	them,	for	when	they	day of	reckoning	 perhaps	by	a	lightning	strike 	finally	comes,	it’ll	come	like	a thief	in	the	night. Second	Point:	You’re	a	one	man	show.	You	and	you	alone	are responsible	for	whatever	outcome	you	find	yourself	in.	Luck	favors	the prepared	and	you’ll	survive	a	storm	far	and	away	better	if	you	prepare beforehand.	Don’t	be	the	guy	who	thinks	that	good	opsec	involves bubble-gumming	his	3.5	floppies	to	the	duct	work	behind	the	vents	in	his room.Third:	Absolutes	where	good	security	is	concerned	don’t	exist.	It’s impossible	to	achieve	100%	anonymity	just	as	it’s	impossible	to	get 100%	hack-proof	data	centers	or	100%	non-casualty	rates	on	the battlefield	no	matter	how	good	your	opsec. There’s	always	a	way	in.	There’s	always	a	leak,	somewhere,	waiting for	a	couple	of	fishermen	to	discover.	A	good	security	planner	will	weigh risk	and	apply	his	resources	accordingly	but	good	anonymity	by	way	of phones,	 especially	 cell	 phones,	comes	down	to	who	is	trying	to	be anonymous	from	what	and	for	how	long.	Disappearing	from	Google	is not	the	same	as	disappearing	from	the	NSA. Take	Tor,	for	instance.	Tor	is	far	easier	to	maintain	anonymity	on	a laptop	or	PC	using	Linux	than	it	ever	will	on	Android.	It’s	a	nice	enough tool	but	there	are	many	apps	that	bleed	your	IP.	Apps	like	those	dealing with	torrents. If	you’re	planning	on	using	Tor	on	your	phone	to	download	torrents, stop	reading.	Return	this	book	for	a	full	refund.	Other	than	clogging	up the	Tor	network	and	making	the	Tor	experience	a	rotten	apple	for	other users,	it	is	hell	on	anonymity	services	since	it	routes	your	REAL	IP ADDRESS	to	destinations	unknown.	It	does	so	anonymously	of	course,	in the	same	way	an	envelope	may	be	delivered	by	anonymous	couriers.	But with	your	real	name	and	phone	number	on	the	inside	of	that	envelope, well	what’s	the	point? 	The	first	basic	tactic	is	to	change	IP	addresses,	and	do	so	frequently.   Depending	on	the	tool	you	use,	most	IP	capable	devices	have	the	ability to	set	their	own	IP	address.	This	tactic	does	come	with	a	penalty	though, because	the	frequent	changing	of	IP	addresses	is	highly	anomalous. Depending	on	the	internet	service	you’re	using	at	the	time,	it	may	be noted	faster	than	you	think.	And	if	you’re	using	Skype,	well	if	they wanted	to	they	could	easily	stream	your	voice	to	two	locations	at	once, and	there’s	nothing	you	can	do	to	prevent	that. As	well,	any	site	that	allows	anonymous	 or	at	least,	accountless  posting	can	pretty	much	only	block	visitors	by	IPs.	Then	some	of	those people	who	got	blocked	are	going	to	find	a	way	to	mask	their	IP	 proxies, Tor,	etc. 	and	get	those	IPs	blocked	too.	Eventually	you’ll	learn	as	I	did that	the	problem	isn’t	the	websites,	it’s	the	jackasses	that	got	them blocked.	Your	milage	may	vary. 	The	second	basic	tactic	is	to	spoof	and	twin	an	IP	address.	With	the first	method	you	are	using	IP	addresses	that	are	valid	for	your	local	node, but	are	currently	unused.	For	a	‘spoof	and	twin’	you	want	to	use	an	IP address	that	another	node	is	currently	using.	This	method	only	works when	your	network	adapter	can	be	put	into	promiscuous	mode	and	read traffic	destined	for	other	IP	addresses.	It	requires	that	your	device	time transmission	so	as	not	to	interfere	with	the	target	device,	and	that	it continue	reading	open	traffic	until	the	target	device	receives	a	reply	from whatever	server	you	sent	to. Even	if	I	provide	you	with	the	best	available	anonymity	methods,	if you	are	doing	something	that	would	attract	the	attention	of	law enforcement,	 those	 methods	 will	 only	 delay	 your	 eventual	 de- anonimization.	Anyone	with	the	capability	of	enlisting	the	help	of	large national	or	international	telecommunication	companies	will	find	you	in hours.	That	said,	I	will	show	you	ways	you	could	 in	theory,	say 	prevent this	event	from	happening.	Read	on.   8	Deadly	Myths	of	Cell	Phones We	need	to	dispel	a	few	myths	before	you	learn	how	to	go	off	the grid	Michael	Weston	style.	The	first	one	is	that	smartphones	are	better	at hiding	you	because	of	all	the	stealth	apps	available.	It	just	isn’t	true. 	Myth	1. 	Smartphones	are	better	than	older	‘dummy’	phones. Smarter,	yes	but	better	at	hiding	you?	A	very	loud	no	with	arms waving	wildly	from	the	rooftop.	Consider	for	a	moment	why	Russia decided	to	revert	to	typewriters	after	the	NSA	scandal	broke	over	the German	chancellor,	Angela	Merkel,	found	out	that	the	NSA	had	been listening	in	on	her	calls	for	years.	If	you	think	it’d	be	much	harder	for	any bureaucrat	to	spy	on	you	if	you	reverted	to	‘the	old	methods’,	you’d	be right.Flip	 ‘dummy’	phones	are	superior	to	smartphones	for	good operational	security,	period.	For	any	kind.	They	don’t	like	to	‘phone home’	for	one	thing,	and	the	less	apps	they	support,	the	tighter	your security.	The	reason	for	this	is	that	most	hacks	and	exploits	target	the most	commonly	used	operating	systems,	like	Windows	and	Android.	And the	‘superhackers’	at	the	NSA	love	it	when	you	use	two	dozen	apps	that you	know	little	about.	Take	a	hint	from	the	Russians. 	Myth	2. 	Home	is	safe	as	long	as	you’re	using	Tor. Wrong	again,	a	thousand	times	wrong.	Home	is	a	radioactive minefield	as	far	as	anonymity	is	concerned.	Imagine	yourself	trying	to handle	a	barrel	of	green	radioactive	goo	without	a	protective	suit.	It’s dangerously	gooey	stuff.	Though	I’ll	grant	you’d	survive	it	maybe	long enough	to	call	up	HQ	and	tell	them	you	botched	the	mission.	Keep	your phone	somewhere	distant	even	if	all	you	want	is	to	keep	the	wife	out	of your	business.	No	need	to	leave	a	loaded	gun	around. 	Myth	3. 	It	doesn’t	matter	where	you	activate	your	phone. Whenever	I	activate	a	phone,	the	opening	scene	from	my	favorite   film,	‘The	Abyss’,	rolls	in	my	head	like	an	old	film	projector	full	of nostalgia	and	greasy	engineers.	One	scene	still	haunts	me	to	this	day years	after	seeing	it.	It’s	that	horrific	opening	scene	where	an underwater	alien	ship	speeds	too	close	to	The	Montana,	a	U.S.	Navy nuclear-tipped	submarine	operating	deep	in	the	Cayman	Trough	in	the Caribbean	Sea. The	sleek,	alien	thing	glides	along	at	a	whopping	130	knots.	I	still remember	the	Captain’s	words. ‘Nothin’	goes	130	knots!’	he	yells	just	as	the	power	goes	out. The	velocity	of	the	alien	ship	knocks	out	almost	every	navigational instrument	on	the	sub,	sonar	included.	A	few	nail-biting	seconds	go	by and	when	the	power	returns,	the	sub	smashes	nose	first	into	a	cliff	and before	anyone	can	breathe,	the	whole	ship	dives	to	the	bottom	of	the ocean	floor.	But	not	before	an	officer	launches	the	sub’s	emergency beacon.That	beacon	breaches	the	surface	in	a	flurry	of	little	beeps	and pulsing	red	light	in	the	thick	of	midnight	as	ten	foot	waves	crash	all around.	Picture	a	tiny	red	blip	on	a	ten	foot	whitecap	going	Beep.	Beep. BEEP.	It’s	scary	to	think	that	the	Navy	found	them.	But	find	them	they did.It’s	not	all	that	different	when	you	activate	your	phone	in	any random	place,	where	the	activation	itself	will	send	such	a	signal	to multiple	parties	interested	in	making	your	life,	well,	not	very	private	at all.	Maybe	not	initially	mind	you.	It’s	the	slow	boiling	frog	scenario	for most.	First	they’ll	want	to	know	things	like Where	you	live. Which	sites	you	visit. What	keywords	you’re	punching	into	Google Where	you’re	using	your	Mastercard. And	who’s	related	to	you	on	all	the	social	media	sites. All	of	this	is	tracked	very	quickly	unless	you’ve	taken	action beforehand	to	limit	who	gets	this	‘emergency	beacon’.	So	how	do	we	get around	it?	There’s	a	few	no	so	obvious	ways. One	poor	man’s	solution	is	to	pay	some	starving	English	major	at	the   local	college	ten	bucks	to	activate	it	for	you	at	a	crowded	college	library you’ll	likely	never	visit.	Be	polite	of	course,	but	know	that	this	fellow mustn’t	have	any	hard	data	on	you	except	for	any	fake	data	you	provide. If	he	starts	asking	questions,	find	some	other	urchin	who	isn’t	so	nosy. Also	know	that	this	isn’t	the	ideal	solution.	It	just	sets	the	stage	for	a	very long	process	of	fogging	up	the	trail. 	Myth	4. 	Untraceable	Burners	Can’t	Be	Bought	Online	 at	least	not anonymously 	This	one	is	false	as	well.	The	problem	with	buying	things on	the	Deep	Web	isn’t	that	doing	so	requires	you	to	be	incognito.	It’s doing	so	without	getting	a	lemon.	You	can	in	fact	buy	burners	on	the Deep	Web	 more	on	this	later .	For	now	know	that	one	option	is	to	use the	Tor	Browser	Bundle	to	purchase	anonymous	burners,	though	like everything	else	on	the	deep	web	such	as	drugs,	iPhones,	Cuban	cigars, you	may	be	better	off	using	 offline	proxies	to	purchase	anything electronic.	Chinese	counterfeiting	is	popular	on	Darknet	sites	as	you’ll soon	see.	They	fool	enough	buyers	to	leave	glowing	reviews	at	first,	so it’s	buyer	beware	most	of	the	time.	That	said,	you	can	just	as	easily	find	a diamond	in	the	rough	offline. 	Myth	5. 	Using	Cash	to	Purchase	Burners	at	Retail	Stores	is	Always Anonymous. Little	mom	and	pop	stores	are	one	thing,	but	big	retail	stores	are truly	privacy-hating	places,	especially	where	the	Big	Box	Corporation	has run	off	all	the	little	shops	in	town.	Those	little	shops	made	great	places	to forge	alliances.	That	said,	if	you	bought	a	burner	from	a	big	box	store	you should	wait	a	month	before	you	activate	it.	When	I	worked	in	security we’d	rotate	the	footage	daily,	but	did	no	firm	deletions	until	30	to	45 days	out.	You	also	must	not	be	seen	talking	on-campus	with	that	college English	major	we	discussed.	Again	this	depends	on	the	level	of	opsec	you require,	but	this	is	at	a	most	basic,	elementary	level.	We’ll	get	more advanced	as	we	go	along. 	Myth	6. 	No	One	Cares	About	Your	Contact	List Two	things	to	say.	The	first	is	that	contacts	are	 dangerous.	They create	a	pattern	that,	when	lit	up	on	a	giant	NSA	screen,	is	like	lighting	a   stick	of	dynamite	with	you	being	on	the	end	of	that	stick.	Boom	again. Much	like	a	‘hidden’	partition	on	a	hard	drive	that	stores	two operating	systems	 one	real	and	one	fake	a’	la	Veracrypt ,	you	want	to set	up	false	leads	to	make	it	look	like	you	have	contacts	where	none	exist. This	fogs	up	your	trail.	One	burner	must	not	have	the	same	contacts	as the	next.	Any	contacts	provide	less	risk	on	paper	than	in	a	phone	list since	most	SIM	data	will	often	give	you	away. The	second	thing	involves	triangulation	and	pattern	matching. Intelligence	agencies	favor	“mirroring”	devices	over	all	others	because	of unique	identifiers	involved.	Over	time	you	can	give	yourself	away	by repeatedly	using	the	same	pattern,	such	as	this:	House	–>	Subway	–> Verizon	 or	your	usual	workplace 	–>	Girlfriend’s	House	–>	Home	Again Taking	this	route	over	and	over	establishes	a	mobility	pattern.	If	anyone of	importance	comes	looking	for	you,	they’ll	find	you	whether	you	use	a burner	phone	or	not.	The	way	to	prevent	this	is	to	know	your surroundings.	Conversations	are	almost	always	the	same	length	of	time. That	is,	when	talking	with	the	same	people	in	the	same	place. Think	about	it.	Your	mother	calls	you	on	days	when	she	doesn’t work	or	when	the	hubby	is	at	work,	usually	for	the	same	45	minute stretch.	Your	best	friend	John,	probably	15-20	minutes	since	there’s	less emotional	rambling.	Men	tend	to	not	beat	around	the	bush	when	talking other	men,	but	over	a	month’s	time	this	creates	a	pattern	of	recognition	if paired	with	other	calls	you	make.	All	it	takes	is	three	or	so	matching patterns	and	it’s	game	over. 	Myth	7. 	No	One	Cares	About	Broken	Phones	in	Alleyways Unless	you	want	to	go	interrogating	every	bum	from	your	home	to the	city	limits,	never	throw	out	your	phone	‘as	is’,	and	especially	not anywhere	near	your	home.	They	should	be	securely	wiped	and	then broken	down	piece	by	piece	as	though	it	were	some	ancient	artifact belonging	to	some	undead	wizard. 	Myth	8. 	You’re	Anonymous	on	any	Wireless	Network	 as	long	as you	don’t	do	anything	stupid 	This	is	the	most	deadly	myth.	It	has	to	do with	using	WiFi	networks	securely,	and	you	wouldn’t	believe	how	many high	school	geeks	think	they’re	masters	at	Tor	and	hacking	only	to	find   the	police	show	up	because	they	threatened	the	wrong	person	online from	the	wrong	dorm.	On	more	than	a	few	security	sites,	I	see	apps	like Macspoofer	and	the	like	being	recommended.	Using	any	of	these wonder-apps	may	prove	detrimental	to	your	freedom. If	your	MAC	address	is	in	a	constant	state	of	identity	crisis	 or, always	changing ,	you’re	narrowing	the	search	parameters	available	to any	adversary	who	wants	to	find	you.	For	a	group	it	draws	massive unwanted	attention.	How?	Because	the	access	point	is	connected	to multiple	MAC	numbers	over	a	short	period	of	time.	It	looks	suspicious. Any	administrator	worth	his	salt	will	look	into	it.	Better	to	look	like everyone	else	rather	than	paint	yourself	black	when	surrounded	by white	sheep. Mobile	anonymity	is	difficult,	frustrating,	bothersome	and	generally a	pain	in	the	neck.	Harder	still	is	severing	the	link	to	your	everyday	life because	depending	on	technology	to	do	it	all	for	you	is	a	fool’s	game.	A dead	end.	You	need	a	good	security	mindset,	diligence	and	the	stamina	to develop	a	mental	trigger	to	predict	accidents	before	they	happen.	We’ve all	heard	of	what	happens	when	a	loaded	gun	is	left	on	a	table	within arm’s	reach	of	a	youngster.	You	need	to	anticipate	this	before	it	happens. To	that,	ask	yourself	the	following:	Who	do	you	need	to	hide	from	and why?How	much	hard	work	and	maintenance	does	it	involve	versus	doing little?Does	it	pass	the	effort	to	payoff	test? How	much	work	is	it	to	do	it	right	versus	getting	caught	and suffering	the	embarrassment	of	being	under	the	spotlight	and,	heaven forbid,	the	family? Whether	you	use	Linux	Mint	or	Windows	7	or	a	Mac,	you	need	to	kill any	application	if	you	entered	any	personal	info	into	it	that	can	aid	in tracing	you.	Usernames	that	you	used	on	forums	should	never	be	used	in your	anonymous	phone	or	anonymous	 like	Linux	Mint! 	laptop. Also,	phone	numbers,	places	of	work,	nicknames,	hangouts,	girls you’ve	dated,	online	games	-	all	of	these	are	part	of	your	real	persona that	leaves	a	trail	right	to	your	front	door.	That	real	persona	needs	to	go into	a	coffin	the	moment	the	anonymous	You	comes	out.	Only	then	can we	know	ourselves	well	enough	not	to	be	bothered	with	worrying	if	we   did	everything	correctly.	By	that	time,	we’ve	done	it	so	many	times	that it’s	an	automatic	timepiece	in	our	subconscious.	Do	this	and	we’ll	see	our true	enemies	more	clearly,	one	of	which	is	the	NSA.   How	The	NSA	Spies	On	You Let’s	say	a	few	words	on	how	the	powers	that	be	trace	calls	to	begin with.	It’s	a	little	technical	but	then	it’s	always	preferable	to	know	the enemy’s	capabilities. If	you’re	like	me	then	you’ve	probably	rolled	your	eyeballs	enough times	whenever	a	bad	guy	on	Burn	Notice	or	CSI	had	twenty	seconds	or so	to	taunt	the	FBI	before	his	location	was	traced.	It’s	all	baloney,	and	it happens	in	every	single	cop	show	on	TV	I’ve	ever	seen.	They	think	we’re lemmings.	Well,	a	few	of	us	are. The	Rockford	Files,	CSI,	and	Burn	Notice.	I	love	every	one	of	these shows	but	it	just	doesn’t	matter	how	much	I	love	em	because	you	can’t love	it	when	they	get	it	wrong.	And	get	it	wrong	they	do	aplenty.	They	get it	wrong	because	the	writers	are	not	detectives	themselves	and	many just	want	to	get	the	script	done	asap,	so	they	never	shadow	any	in	their day	to	day	operations	at	all.	But	best-selling	authors	like	James	Patterson do	their	homework.	Go	figure. Phone	signals	came	inline	some	forty	years	ago	and	back	then	how you	got	connected	was	very	different	than	today.	A	call	was	setup	from one	switch	to	the	next,	and	the	next,	and	then	the	next	until	finally	a connecting-circuit	relayed	your	voice. These	days	most	switches	are	simultaneous	since	most	calls	are over	SS7	 that	is,	the	Signaling	System	which	manages	calls .	Each	calling station	is	traceable	at	the	beginning	too,	so	the	trace	countdown	you	see on	most	cop	shows	really	does	stretch	the	truth.	But	it	makes	for	a suspenseful	police	drama	and,	let’s	face	it,	most	people	don’t	mind suspending	disbelief	for	an	hour	if	they	can	get	good	entertainment. I’ve	trouble	doing	this	though.	Perhaps	I’m	just	an	impatient	guy when	it	comes	to	police	procedural	shows	but	one	episode	on	CSI	came across	as	gut-wrenchingly	sloppy.	It	showed	a	low-level	programmer realigning	a	satellite	from	his	laptop	 without	 any	 assistance	 from	 any other	agency.	I	nearly	fell	out	of	my	chair.	It	takes	an	insane	amount	of teamwork	and	coordination	between	other	agencies	to	do	something	of   that	technical	caliber. Mobile	phone	tracing	does	require	more	resources	than	a	landline since	a	cell	phone	number	is	not	connected	to	a	single	switch.	But	it	isn’t impossible	for	a	mobile	phone	provider	to	locate	which	towers	the phone	used	or	what	region	the	call	was	made.	One	way	of	doing	it	is	by comparing	signal	strength	and	then	correlating	that	with	the	antenna that	held	your	signal.	If	you’ve	got	an	unencrypted	non-burner	phone, the	GPS	chip	inside	will	give	up	your	location	to	any	who	are	in possession	of	it. I	bet	you’re	wondering	how	come	you	can’t	trace	a	mobile	phone like	your	cell	phone	company	can. The	reason	is	the	same	reason	that	you	can’t	identify	individuals	by IP	address	alone.	Only	the	telephone	company	knows	because	they	have the	logs.	They	own	the	equipment.	They	have	easy	access.	Even	police need	a	subpoena	to	get	subscriber	access	from	a	VPN,	 or	virtual	private network .	They	can’t	hack	the	system	for	one	individual	without	risking their	job	 or	political	career .	Well,	the	NSA	can	I	suppose,	only	that’s	a whole	other	enchilada.	But	for	the	internet	itself	no	node	within	it	is	any more	special	than	any	of	the	others	since	it	uses	the	same	band. Unlike	phones. The	short	answer	is:	You	can’t	without	the	right	opsec	and	the	right mindset.	If	you’re	using	towers	then	you	can	be	traced,	generally speaking.	But	this	isn’t	a	perfect	world	and	those	towers	aren’t	perfect either.	They	produce	false	positives	just	like	our	anti-virus	programs	do, albeit	differently.	But	you	can	toy	with	the	triangulation	angle	a	bit	to obfuscate	the	trail. One	method	involves	using	a	PBX	system	to	delay	identity	discovery. Notice	I	said	delay,	not	eradicate.	The	way	to	do	it	is	to	connect	with	a company’s	PBX	system	via	dial-up.	This	will	have	them	looking	in	the wrong	spot.	It’s	still	possible	for	them	to	trace	you	given	enough	time	but not	without	going	though	the	company	logs.	That	takes	time	too	and	to be	honest	they’d	rather	not	bother	unless	ordered	to	do	so	by	a	higher power.You	can	also	do	it	by	creating	false	leads	using	radio	waves	 yes,	a  Wait	 a	 second,	 you	 say.	 If	 that’s	 true,	 then	 how	 am	 I	 supposed	 to  prevent	my	phone	from	being	tracked?   radio 	that	links	your	voice	to	your	phone.	Do	it	right	and	the	guy	who	is chasing	you	will	end	up	chasing	the	wind.	You	can	set	the	signal	to whatever	you	want.	A	hundred	feet	becomes	a	half	a	mile	and	now	Mr. Smith’s	area	to	catch	you	has	suddenly	become	much	larger.	Much	larger means	more	time,	more	money	and	more	resources.	However,	neither	of the	above	methods	mean	anything	if	you	are	either	one	of	three	things: -	Lax	with	your	metadata	 i.e.	those	you	regularly	contact . -	Lax	with	your	situational	awareness. -	Lax	with	opsec.   The	NSA	Fingerprints	Cells Bob	from	accounting	claims	one	burner	is	as	good	as	the	next.	Tom agrees	somewhat,	but	insists	you	need	a	voodoo	doll	and	a	crazy	formula he	read	on	an	Ars	Technica	thread	to	really	make	it	anonymous.	The	new girl	in	programming,	one	sexy	Carrie-Anne,	insists	it’s	really	what	you	do outside	of	a	phone	that	matters.	Whom	do	we	trust?	Bob	the	Yes	Man, Tom	the	Tax	Expert	or	the	goth-chick-turned-hacker	Carrie-Anne?	What is	‘good	enough’	anyway? It	depends	on	where	you	are.	One	burner	can	be	as	good	as	the	next in	Southeast	Asia	if	that’s	where	you’re	headed.	Or	it	may	be	‘good enough’	if	you’re	trekking	to	the	South	Pole	or	diving	in	some	bombed out	Japanese	sub	off	the	Philippines	and	aren’t	really	hiding	from	anyone except	Great	White	sharks. But	Bangkok	and	the	Philippines	aren’t	North	America	or	the	UK.	It’s tough	defeating	towering	bullies	over	small	badgers	though	both	pose	a serious	threat.	I	know	because	I’ve	tried	-	and	failed.	When	you	get	right down	to	it,	it	mostly	depends	on	who	you’re	trying	to	hide	from. But	regardless	of	who	that	‘someone’	is,	there	are	two	main	types	of cell	technology	we	can	work	with.	The	first	is	GSM,	which	stands	for Global	System	for	Mobiles,	and	CDMA	which	stands	for	Code	Division Multiple	Access. You	and	I	can’t	cross	them,	which	is	why	I	can’t	use	my	AT&T	cell	on Verizon’s	service.	Most	of	the	major	carriers	make	it	simple	for	LEOs	to trace	calls	because	they	separate	burner	phone	traffic	from	prepaid traffic.	A	Sprint	executive	may	say	it’s	because	they	need	to	prioritize traffic.	Only	what	he	doesn’t	tell	you	is	that	it’s	used	by	the	NSA	and	law enforcement	to	track	down	‘anonymous’	callers. The	NSA	does	this	by	‘fingerprinting’	every	call.	Fingerprint	analysis is	based	on	the	contacts	unique	to	each	caller.	That	is,	 your	unique contacts,	as	well	as	how	long	you	talk	to	those	contacts	and	how	long they	talk	to	their	contacts.	It	all	adds	up	to	a	nice	fat	profile	on	you	that	is shady	at	best	and	outright	evil	at	worst.   Let’s	say	our	friend	Jerry	talks	to	Kramer,	George	and	Elaine	every day	as	he	sits	down	with	his	Wheaties.	He	has	several	phones,	different carriers,	only	the	info	he	adds	per	‘Friend’	per	contact	makes	for	one helluva	traceable	target.	Every	bit	of	data	on	these	contacts	 that	is, Kramer,	George	&	Elaine 	are	placed	on	the	SIM	card	and	match	the	exact contact	data	on	any	other	burner	he	uses.	For	federal	law	enforcement	to track	him	down	would	be	laughably	easy. For	the	NSA,	a	few	clicks	in	the	Prism	system	and	from	there	it’d	be no	effort	at	all	to	find	his	geographical	location.   Location,	Location So	then,	how	to	solve	this	problem?	Well	first	we	need	to	define what	‘location’	really	means	to	the	Big	Data	players. Carriers	like	Verizon	store	data	based	on	your	phone’s	signal- strength.	That	is,	the	‘weight’	of	your	call	between	you	and	the	nearest cell	tower.	It	stores	a	mind-boggling	amount	of	numerical	data	on	your behavior	and,	at	the	simplest	level,	this	is	known	as	‘triangulation’ locating.	The	GPS	functions	in	your	phone	use	it	more	often	than	you realize.	Apps	like	Google	Earth	and	Maps.Me	use	it	as	much	as	they	can and	provide	your	whereabouts	to	distant	servers	-	and	as	a	side	hustle bonus	are	better	able	to	target	you	with	ads	based	on	that	data.	It’s	a	real juicy	side	of	income	if	you’ve	got	Google’s	or	the	NSA’s	data	centers	to sort	it	all	out. The	second	thing	to	note	is	the	Christmas	Day	error.	Come	one wintry	Christmas	morning	when	the	cardinals	and	sparrows	flutter about	in	the	snowy	front	yard,	you	open	your	presents	to	find	a	fancy smartphone,	one	loaded	with	gizmo	after	gizmo.	It	cost	a	fortune	and	you can’t	wait	to	hit	the	ignition.	What’s	the	first	thing	you	do?	What’s	the first	thing	anyone	does? They’ll	call	up	that	number	to	activate	it.	Lickety	split. They’re	way	too	sloshed	to	realize	it,	but	doing	that	is	like	a	tipsy mouse	nibbling	a	morsel	of	cheese	in	a	trap	with	the	cat	watching	from the	cover	of	darkness. Before	they	can	kick	back	another	shot	of	Jack	Daniels	and	eggnog, they	blurt	out	their	full	name,	home	address	and	their	mistress’s password	in	front	of	the	wife.	From	that	point	on	it’s	near	impossible	to spoof	anything	because	of	the	correlation	of	that	phone	with	their	real location	-	and	all	the	locations	and	profiles	of	every	phone	user	in	the house.	Why	do	they	need	your	contact	list	now	that	you’ve	connected	to everyone	in	your	household? And	it	ain’t	just	the	NSA	either.   How	the	IRS	Spies	On	You It’s	not	just	the	NSA	that	uses	Stingray	surveillance	technology	to spy	on	the	citizenry.	The	IRS	now	uses	it	as	well	to	capture	metadata from	cell	phones.	They’re	a	part	of	the	Big	Data	empire	too,	and	they demand	only	the	best	tools	of	the	trade:	the	most	expensive	and	the	most invasive.	They	use	something	known	as	 IMSI	 interceptors	 or	cell	site simulators . Worse,	IRS	agents	now	have	the	same	authority	previously	held	only by	judges.	This	power	gives	them	authority	to	install	Pen	register	devices so	they	can	spy	on	people	they	suspect	aren’t	giving	their	fair	share.	Or anyone	that	challenges	them	for	that	matter. Historically,	these	were	used	by	the	FBI	to	capture	recordings	by Mafia	members	or	Mexican	Cartel	leaders	in	Juarez.	You	know,	real criminals.	Nowadays	everyone	with	a	U.S.	passport	is	fair	game	and	if they	run	out	of	real	criminals	to	prosecute,	well	by	golly	they’ll	just invent	a	few	more	to	keep	the	the	gravy	train	running	full-steam.	There’s even	rumors	flying	that	student	loan	defaulters	will	have	their	passports revoked.	Not	too	far	fetched	since	they	do	the	same	with	child	support obligations,	and	that’s	only	$2500,	not	$50,000. Anyway.	From	the	eagle’s	viewpoint	you	can	see	the	IRS’	Stingrays are	high-tech	doppelgangers.	They	are	clones	of	a	cell	tower	that	can force	any	phone	within	reach	to	silently	connect	so	that	any	metadata can	be	siphoned	off. Kinda	 in	 PBS	 nature documentaries,	where	the	plant	benefits	and	the	parasite	benefits	in	a kind	of	symbiosis	that’s	a	pain	to	study	in	a	college	textbook	but	fun	to watch.	Only	where	the	IRS	is	concerned,	the	benefits	flow	in	one direction	only. The	kicker?	That	parasite	will	die	far	sooner	than	the	plant.	Think	on this	for	a	moment.	What	do	you	think’s	going	to	happen	if	your	country suddenly	finds	itself	unable	to	borrow	from	anyone?	If	you’ve	studied history	you	already	know	the	answer.	They	steal	their	own	citizens’  like	 one	 of	 those	 parasites	 you	 see	   wealth	in	a	very,	well,	parasitic-like	way.	We’ve	seen	this	in	Argentina, Poland	and	France. Don’t	believe	for	a	minute	the	IRS	will	only	be	using	this	spy	tech	on the	millionaire	fat	cats	living	abroad.	Those	guys	are	small	potatoes.	If they	were	to	seize	every	fatcat’s	funds	in	every	country	on	Earth,	it’d	be enough	to	pay	for	Medicare	for	a	scant	3	years.	Then	they’d	be	right	back where	they	started.	If	you	don’t	believe	it	then	allow	me	to	quote	a	rather well-known	statesman	on	this	topic: 	  “If	you	will	not	fight	for	right	when	you	can	easily	win	without	blood shed;	if	you	will	not	fight	when	your	victory	is	sure	and	not	too	costly;	you may	 come	 to	 the	 moment	 when	 you	 will	 have	 to	 fight	 with	 all	 the	 odds against	you	and	only	a	precarious	chance	of	survival.	There	may	even	be	a worse	case.	You	may	have	to	fight	when	there	is	no	hope	of	victory,	because it	is	better	to	perish	than	to	live	as	slaves.”  -	Winston	S.	Churchill   How	Google	Spies	On	You Google	loves	you	to	death.	They	love	everyone	actually,	or	more	to the	point,	everyone’s	private	data.	There’s	gold	in	them	ones	and	zeros and	most	people	offer	em	up	quite	willingly	for	their	daily	digital	fix. Google	loves	to	store	data	about	you	when	you’re	not	looking.	That’s what	happens	when	you	invite	a	vampire	into	your	home.	Tough	as	nails to	kick	out	and	they	leave	a	trail	of	confusion	and	mayhem	when	they finally	do	hightail	it.	Like	little	cousin	Eddie	whose	long	since	outlived	his welcome.As	a	fairly	strong	privacy	advocate,	I	like	to	manage	that	online privacy	by	controlling	the	data	I	make	available	online.	The	problem	is that	Google’s	been	getting	smarter	at	meta-managing	me	by	my	own keywords	on	other	search	engines.	The	only	option	is	to	enact	whatever privacy	controls	are	required	yourself.	Or	don’t	use	any	of	Google’s services.	And	that	my	friend	is	a	very	long	list	that	includes:	Google Search	Gmail	Google	Plus	Google	Alerts	Google	Books	Google	Finance Google	Groups	Google	Hotel	Finder	Google	Flight	Search	Google Translate	Google	Trends	Life	Search	 or	Google	China 	…	and	a	host	of others.The	master	list	of	course	is	a	lot	longer.	The	data-mining	operations for	each	of	these	services	cost	millions	each	day.	Google’s	algorithm	tries to	predict	what	you’ll	want	tomorrow	or	next	Christmas.	That’s	fine	with some	people	because	it’s	legal	after	all	and	they’ve	been	doing	that	since forever.The	problem	is	that	they	share	this	with	any	government	who	pays them	or	allows	them	entry	into	the	country.	This	becomes	a	problem overseas	if	you	need	to	use	online	storage.	Enter	Google	Drive. 	Google	Drive Google	Drive	makes	for	one	helluva	solution	for	business	travelers who	need	to	protect	sensitive	files	from	cross-border	guards.	Guard	who love	to	confiscate	laptops	and	pen	drives	because,	well,	they	want	to	look   competent. Just	upload	the	data	to	Big	G	before	you	hit	the	US	border	and	you’re good	to	go.	This	also	works	if	you	have	to	travel	to	out	of	the	way	places like	Philippines. Well,	most	of	the	time.	So	what’s	the	problem	then? Google	is	the	problem,	just	as	iCloud	was	a	problem	for	a	few celebrities	who	got	hacked.	It	happens	every	year.	Just	ask	Jennifer Lawrence	how	she	feels	about	tossing	her	pics	‘in	the	cloud’	after	her nudes	got	hacked	and	leaked.	There’s	plenty	of	other	risks	too: Law	enforcement	can	access	it	with	a	judge-signed	warrant. The	NSA	can	give	the	FBI	full	access	to	your	files. Any	alphabet	agency	can	access	it.	Agencies	like	the	DEA,	ATF, CIA,	&	the	IRS	 if	they	have	the	NSA’s	ability	to	bypass	Google’s encryption	 which	Google	only	beefed	up	after	the	media	revealed that	the	NSA	was	siphoning	data	from	their	tailpipe.  Employees	may	upload	personal	info	in	the	cloud	which,	if hacked,	cause	financial	issues	and	maybe	even	a	lawsuit. Any	bank	you	deal	with	may	deny	you	any	reimbursement	of lost	funds	if	you	store	bank	details	in	the	cloud.	They’ll	consider	it ‘negligence’	on	your	part. 	It’s	more	effective	to	use	an	encryption	app	like	Veracrypt	or	PGP	to work	 with	Google	Drive.	What	I	do	is:	-	First	fire	up	Veracrypt	or Truecrypt	7.1a	-	Create	a	storage	file,	-	Pick	2	algo-based	encryption schemes	with	SHA-512	keys	-	Put	all	my	sensitive	files	in	there. -	Then	and	only	then	do	I	upload	the	encrypted	files	to	Google	Drive. When	I	need	to	alter	my	work,	say	update	a	new	draft	of	a	novel	I’m working	on	but	don’t	want	Google	scanning	it	for	‘offending’	terms,	I	just copy	the	encrypted	doc	out	of	Google	Drive,	update	it	and	then	re- encrypt	and	re-upload	to	Google	Drive.	If	I	ever	want	to	delete	it,	I	just delete	the	encrypted	storage	file.	It’s	easy	peasy	and	it’ll	be	eons	before Google	has	Skynet’s	quantum	computers	to	crack	the	encryption	key. 	Encryption	and	Google   As	I	mentioned,	any	governmental	agency	can	and	will	access	your cloud	storage	via	a	subpoena	sent	to	Google.	But	what	are	the consequences	if	law	enforcement	confiscates	your	phone?	Your	laptop?	It happens.	And	as	it	so	happens	you	may	be	arrested	on	a	totally	separate case	but	they’ve	insufficient	evidence. Except	your	laptop	and	phone	are	now	in	their	hands.	Here	are	the risks,	number	one	of	which	is: Doppelgangers.	Enemy	numero	uno.	Any	login	cookies	for Google	services	 like	Google	Docs 	can	be	copied	to	impersonate you,	or	they	can	login	to	all	Google	accounts	in	Firefox	or	Chrome and	act	as	the	Real	You. They	can	steal	your	password	from	the	browser’s	password storage	file	if	you’ve	no	master	password	set. And	with	your	password	they	can	reset	it	in	Google	and	all Google	services. Chrome	might	cache	parts	of	files	or	documents	the	last	time you	logged	in. Or	they	can	use	Data	Recovery	Tools	to	retrieve	your	deleted files. 	You	can	avoid	each	of	the	above	scenarios	by	using	a	full-disk encryption	program.	As	long	as	your	phone	or	laptop	is	powered	off when	they	take	it	 and	you’re	not	in	a	jurisdiction	where	they	can	beat the	password	out	of	you ,	you’re	safe	as	long	as	the	country	in	question respects	your	right	to	remain	silent. As	for	a	searching	solution	that	replaces	Google	outright,	I	use	and recommend	DuckDuckGo.	It’s	not	as	laser-refined	as	Google	is,	but	they must	operate	exactly	as	advertised.	One	thing	they’re	very	clear	on	is their	privacy	policy,	which	states: They	don’t	track	you. They	don’t	sell	your	search	data	to	other	websites They	don’t	require	cookies. They	don’t	collect	metadata	on	you   They	don’t	store	your	search	history. It’s	black	and	white	without	a	lot	of	legalese	that	most	people	just skip	through	anyway.	Clear	and	plain	as	day.	If	they	ever	decide	to embrace	the	dark	side	 as	Google	has 	then	the	FTC	can	file	a	lawsuit. The	main	thing	is	that	if	a	company	has	a	privacy	policy,	then	they	must stick	to	it.	No	matter	what. 	Google	Chrome Google	Chrome’s	a	lot	like	Stephen	King’s	Christine,	a	1957 Plymouth	Fury	who	loves	it’s	owner	a	bit	too	much.	She	runs	fast	and	hot and	horny	and	like	that	hellspawn	of	a	car,	Chrome’ll	resist	any temptation	to	tinker,	mod	or	otherwise	tighten	her	steel	gaped	maw because	she	thinks	she	can	do	the	job	better	than	you	can.	Besides,	why should	she	take	orders	from	some	lowly	peon,	anyway? But	I’ll	tell	you	how	it	all	ends:	It	ends	with	the	kid	owner	paying	a high	price	for	putting	a	speed	demon	ahead	of	his	family.	Chrome,	like Christine,	‘repairs’	herself	without	permission	a	little	too	often	for	my liking.She’s	certainly	fast	though,	just	like	Christine.	But	she’s	not	that	fast. And	there	are	some	serious	consequences	to	not	looking	under	the	hood. Here	are	a	few	gems	that	are	considered	‘benefits’	to	the	end	user	by Google:Each	web	url	you	type	is	sent	to	Google	for	the	auto	complete function	-	without	telling	you. Each	file	you	download	gets	sent	to	the	Big	G	too.	They	verify	it against	a	master	‘white	list’	then	link	your	IP	address	to	that	file	for months.Chrome	checks	every	hour	on	the	hour	a	list	of	blacklisted	URLs to	‘protect’	you.	Even	opening	Chrome	tells	Google	where	you	are. When	you	logon	to	Google	Gmail,	they	know	everything	about your	browser:	Tabs,	History	&	all	Bookmarks.	Then	they	store	it	in one	of	those	giant	data	centers	of	theirs. Will	load	a	site	before	you	finish	the	address.   Remember:	If	you	are	getting	it	for	free,	you	are	not	the	customer. You	are	the	product.   How	Windows	10	Spies	On	You Windows	10	is	the	flagship	of	Microsoft’s	cloud-centric	vision,	and written	under	the	hood	is	the	hope	that	you’ll	one	day	depend	on	that cloud	for	more	than	just	accessing	game	saves.	In	the	meantime, Windows	10	is	not	a	particularly	happy	operating	system	unless	it’s looking	online	for	drivers	updates,	patches	and	the	like	for	your supposed	benefit.	It	wants	to	put	a	smile	on	your	face. It	all	sounds	well	and	good	until	the	real	goal	becomes	apparent: looking	for	people	who	fit	your	own	social	circle	and	‘buying’	habits	and corralling	everyone	into	a	nice	trackable	pen…	all	without	asking	you first.Yes,	I	know.	Microsoft’s	spying	on	the	masses	is	hardly	news.	It’s	old hat	and	they’re	not	the	only	ones	doing	it	by	a	long	shot.	Every	company you	give	money	to	channels	your	money	into	some	kind	of	marketing analysis	with	the	laser	sights	focused	somehow	on	you	and	your	stuff. Supermarkets	like	Winn-Dixie	or	Wal-Mart	use	them	to	such	a	laser- refined	edge	that	they	know	when	your	daughter	is	pregnant	before	you do.	It	seems	like	a	decent	man	just	can’t	escape	this	dragnet	without going	off-grid	and	living	like	Jeremiah	Johnson	 I’ve	tried	that	too,	and failed	spectacularly	when	I	ran	into	a	grizzly.	More	on	that	later . But	let’s	not	fall	on	our	sword	just	yet.	You	can	in	fact	escape	any chance	of	law	enforcement,	governments	or	hackers	getting	a	hold	of that	data,	and	that’s	our	aim,	as	when	your	data	is	shared	with governments	or	criminals	that	abuse	this	information,	well,	a	lot	of	nasty surprises	come	down	the	pike.	Below	is	Microsoft’s	privacy	statement and	FAQ	regarding	the	Diagnostics	Tracking	Service	that	comes	with Windows	10:	“As	you	use	Windows,	we	collect	performance	and	usage information	that	helps	us	identify	and	troubleshoot	problems	as	well	as improve	our	products	and	services.	We	recommend	that	you	select	Full for	this	setting.” Full	data	includes	all	Basic	and	Enhanced	data,	and	also	turns   on	advanced	diagnostic	features	that	collect	additional	data	from your	device,	such	as	system	files	or	memory	snapshots,	which	may unintentionally	include	parts	of	a	document	you	were	working	on when	a	problem	occurred.	This	information	helps	us	further troubleshoot	and	fix	problems.	If	an	error	report	contains	personal data,	we	won’t	use	that	information	to	identify,	contact,	or	target advertising	to	you.	This	is	the	recommended	option	for	the	best Windows	experience	and	the	most	effective	troubleshooting. Them’s	Microsoft’s	words,	not	mine,	and	note	also	that	only	on Enterprise	Edition	can	one	turn	Diagnostics	Tracking	Service	off completely.	Diagnostics	Tracking	Service	consists	of	these	files: telemetry.asm-windowsdefault.json diagtrack.dll utc.app.json utcresources.dll 	It’s	not	likely	anyone	can	lockdown	Windows	10	enough	to	know what	they	send	or	don’t	send	either	by	laptop,	PC	or	cell	phone.	As	Ars Technica	has	found	out,	it’s	impossible	to	know	why	Windows	10	can’t seem	to	stop	talking	to	Microsoft’s	servers.	Furthermore,	Windows	takes system	files	or	memory	snapshots,	which	may	inadvertently	include PARTS	OF	A	DOCUMENT	YOU	WERE	WORKING	ON	when	a	problem occurred.	Note	that	Android	isn’t	much	different.	It	has	a	similar	data collection	policy	as	does	Mac	OS. 	Windows	Privacy	Settings Windows	10	comes	with	some	privacy	settings	turned	on	and	some turned	off.	You	can	open	up	the	Settings	app	and	tic	off	what	you	like	or don’t,	but	know	that	they’re	all	tied	to	your	Unique	Advertising	Identifier. This	Identifier	is	shared	across	other	apps	you	use	to	allow	Microsoft	to spy	on	you	and	show	you	targeted	ads	in	much	the	same	way	Wal-Mart does	with	your	Sam’s	Club	card.	Corporations	share	this	with	each	other and	some	sell	it	outright	for	truckloads	of	cash	-	as	do	Search	engines	like Bing	and	Google.	With	Bing	Search	sitting	there	in	the	start	menu,	you can	bet	you	rubber-flesh	copy	of	Evil	Dead	that	any	search	queries	will   Cortana  not	stay	private.	They’ll	be	outed	just	as	if	you	typed	them	into	Bing	itself. Even	URLs	get	sent	to	Microsoft	for	validation	purposes	so	it	goes without	saying	that	some	cellar	doors	should	remain	shut.	Permanently. Cortana	comes	with	Windows	10	automatically	enabled	after	install. With	this	on	you	consent	to	Microsoft	to	grant	a	personal	assistant	of sorts,	one	that’ll	send	data	about	your	activities	 including	applications you	run,	GPS	locations,	browsing	history 	back	and	forth	between	your PC	and	Microsoft.	It	also	includes	your	handwriting	and	voice	imprint. You	can	disable	these	within	Speech,	Inking	&	Typing	within	Privacy settings,	but	know	that	Cortana	isn’t	unique	in	this	kind	of	privacy	abuse, as	Google	Now	and	Siri	do	the	same	thing. It	should	be	obvious	that	this	is	a	Very	Bad	Thing	if	you	plan	on doing	anything	remotely	shady	on	the	Deep	Web.	If	you	absolutely	must use	Windows	10	 which	I	strongly	recommend	you	do	not ,	you	must	- above	all	else-disable	data	logging.	Here’s	how. Disable	Data	Logging	in	Windows	10 A	few	of	these	fixes	are	a	bit	overkill,	and	if	you’re	not	sure	what	to do	then	stick	to	the	“before	installation”	and	“after	installation”	parts. DON’T	start	mucking	about	with	the	Powershell	or	the	registry	editor	if you	don’t	have	at	least	a	good	idea	of	what	you’re	doing	though.	This goes	a	bit	farther	than	merely	being	‘computer	literate’,	obviously,	but	it illustrates	how	dangerous	Windows	really	is	to	anonymity. Before During	Installation Do	not	use	Express	Settings.	Hit	Customize,	and	make	sure everything	is	turned	off.	It’s	strongly	preferred	that	you	use	a	local account	with	Windows	10.After	Installation   ””	  Head	to	Settings	>	Privacy,	and	disable	everything,	unless	there	are some	things	you	really	need.	While	within	the	Privacy	page,	go	to Feedback,	select	Never	in	the	first	box,	and	Basic	in	the	second	box. Head	to	Settings	>	Update	and	Security	>	Advanced	Options	> Choose	how	updates	are	delivered,	and	turn	the	first	switch	off. Disable	Cortana	by	right	clicking	the	Search	bar icon.  Optional 	Disable	web	search	in	Search	by	going	to	Settings,	and turning	off	Search	online	and	include	web	results.

How	to	Tell	if	Your	Phone	is	Tapped A	phone	tapped	with	a	keylogger	is	a	bomb	waiting	to	go	off	since the	keylogger	secretly	records	 and	emails 	every	username	and password	you	type	in.	Keyloggers	aren’t	foolproof	though.	There	are	a few	signs	that	may	give	clues	that	it	isn’t	just	your	eyes	seeing	the	screen. 1. 	Unexplained	Data	Spikes	-	Are	there	any	unusual	spikes	in	the size	of	data	being	stored	on	the	device?	A	lot	of	spyware	programs	pack data	under	the	hood	when	you’re	not	looking	so	it	can	be	sent	out	later	in bulk.	Efficient	spy	payload	you	might	call	it.	My	Data	Manager	is	good	at monitoring	this	but	the	best	spyware	apps	will	evade	detection	since	the footprint	is	becoming	ever	smaller	and	the	size	of	devices	ever	bigger. 2. 	Unusual	Phone	Activity	-	Things	like	turning	itself	off	or	your lock	screen	suddenly	flashing	on	when	you’re	not	using	it. 3. 	Line	Noise	-	If	you’re	in	the	Philippines	and	making	calls,	line stability	is	often	terrible	in	provincial	areas	like	Davao	or	Dumaguete. That	means	tons	of	noise.	If	you’re	in	a	first	world	nation,	a	constant stream	of	‘clicks’	and	‘beeps’	can	signal	that	someone,	somewhere,	is listening. 4. 	Encrypted	Emails	-	This	can	happen	with	poorly	designed spyware,	where	you	receive	odd	messages	that	make	no	sense	and	are filled	with	strange	symbols.	Spy	applications	are	known	to	be	buggy	little critters	and	not	even	keyloggers	used	by	the	FBI	to	capture	keystrokes	of mafia	members	are	perfect. 5. 	Odd	Files	in	Directories	-	It’s	often	easy	to	see	spyware’s	been installed	on	your	device	by	just	looking	into	a	few	subdirectories	on	your Android	or	iPhone.	Often	I	find	if	I	do	a	Google	search	for	the	name	of	the file,	someone	somewhere	has	likewise	found	this	exact	same	file.	Better still	is	that	they’ve	opened	a	forum	thread	asking	for	help.	Most	of	the time	the	file	turns	out	to	be	quite	old.	This	saves	me	the	trouble	of	using expensive	forensic	software	like	Paraben’s	Device	Seizure	or	UFED Physical	Analyzer.   in	ANY	Country  How	to	Stay	Anonymous	Overseas… You’ve	won	the	Powerball	lottery	and	Uncle	Sam	awaits	his	cut. Problem	is,	so	are	some	ugly	long	lost	relatives	who’ve	managed	to	track you	down	and	are	now	throwing	down	an	epic	guilt	trip	by	sleeping	in	a van	next	to	your	mailbox.	They’re	threatening	to	sleep	down	by	the	river too.But	that’s	not	all. A	guy	named	Eddie	you	remember	from	3rd	grade	claims	to	have been	your	best	friend.	Except	that	he	really	wasn’t.	All	you	remember	is that	he	gave	you	back	a	chewed	up	No.	2	pencil	that	looked	fresh	out	of the	hamster	bin	at	the	pet	store. You	need	to	get	away	from	this	heat.	Settle	down	somewhere	and	let things	simmer	down	so	you	can	think	clearly.	So	you	take	aim	and	throw a	dart	at	a	world	map	on	the	wall	and	it	lands	smack	dab	in	the	middle	of Zamboanga,	Philippines.	You	hop	on	Google	Earth	and	think,	my	my,	it looks	an	awful	lot	like	Maui.	Then	you	get	all	googly-eyed	at	those turquoise-watered	beaches. Only	it	isn’t	quite	that. There’s	a	few	terrorists	walking	around	 real	ones,	not	the	old grannies	the	TSA	likes	to	pull	aside	to	interrogate .	What	could	possibly go	wrong? To	be	honest,	everything.	You’re	a	walking	ATM	in	the	Philippines and	most	of	the	locals	know	it,	though	by	how	much	is	debatable.	But they	all	think	you’re	rich.	If	you	can	afford	a	$1500	round-trip	flight	at the	other	end	of	the	world	well	then	you’re	as	rich	as	Trump,	by	god. Now,	not	everyone	is	looking	to	rip	you	off,	but	the	cab	drivers	certainly will	and	if	you’re	in	Zambooanga,	watch	out	because	that’s	the	danger zone	of	all	danger	zones. Americans,	British	citizens	and	Canadians	alike	are	kidnapped routinely	whenever	they	venture	too	far	into	Mindanao	territory.   Especially	Zamboanga.	You’d	never	know	Zamboanga	houses	terrorists because	it	looks	like	Cebu	and	even	Manila.	How	safe	are	those	cities? Not	very.	For	this	reason	you	better	get	ready	to	lie	your	tail	off	before you	ever	set	foot	on	a	plane.	Nice	guys	get	killed	over	there.	Quickly. The	first	thing	you	need	is	a	Fake	Name.	No	way	around	it.	You	have to	know	your	lies	inside	and	out	before	you’re	airborne.	Then	you	need to	build	a	foundation	to	support	this	lie	in	the	event	you’re	discovered. We’ll	use	Philippines	as	an	example	since	that’s	where	our	dart	landed and	also	because	it’s	the	most	socially	networked	country	in	the	world, bar	none.	And	I	don’t	mean	online. 1. 	First	things	first,	make	up	an	email	account	using	first	name.last name@whereever.com.	The	name	should	obviously	be	fake	and	be something	common	to	your	country	but	not	to	your	city.	So	if	you’re	from Chinatown	you	better	pick	someplace	else.	John	Smith	is	perhaps	too obvious	for	most	tall	white	guys.	You	must	never	use	this	email	for	any connections	to	your	real	name	because	the	aim	here	is	to	muddy	the	trail when	anyone	goes	looking	for	the	real	you.	They’ll	perform	reverse- image	searches,	phone	numbers,	white	pages,	and	maybe	even	Usenet and	Ars	Technica	forums	looking	for	your	favorite	Skype	nicknames. Never	let	this	fake	name	connect	to	social	media	that’s	connected	to the	real	you.	Ever.	As	well,	never	use	this	name	on	the	same	IP	address	if you	can	help	it.	Use	a	VPN	on	a	laptop	specific	to	this	fake	name.	Signup for	Facebook	if	you	must	but	realize	that	if	you	login	from	the	same	IP address	as	your	Real	You,	Facebook	will	know	it	and	will	broadcast	it	to the	world. 	2. 	Women	will	almost	always	ask	‘Is	that	your	real	name?’	when they	talk	to	you	on	Skype	or	some	other	chatroom.	IF	you	have	to	you	can tell	them	you	work	for	the	CIA	or	that	you’re	the	next	Stephen	King	and your	publisher’s	threatened	to	string	you	up	from	the	nearest	tree	if	you reveal	your	real	name.	If	anyone	online	asks	for	an	address,	sever	all communications	immediately.	They’re	likely	either	a	stalker	or	an identity	thief. 	3. 	Listed	here	are	the	primary	things	that’ll	give	up	the	goose: airport	luggage	with	your	real	name	on	it,	business	cards,	laptops,   tablets,	iPhones	with	your	real	life	pictures	of	you	as	a	baby	scattered about,	and	receipts.	Anything	in	your	wallet	is	a	dead	giveaway	unless you	have	a	prearranged	DECOY	wallet.	A	professional	liar’s	wallet. 	4. 	Never	post	old	photos	to	a	fake	Facebook	page.	Any	photos	have to	be	made	exclusively	for	that	profile	and	nothing	else	lest	they	see	old photos	from	your	real	Facebook	page. 	5. 	A	problem	area	is	check-in	at	the	Marriot	with	a	nice	girl	at	your side,	the	same	you	just	lied	to.	Only	the	cute	emerald-green	eyed	girl	at the	desk	asks	for	your	real	name.	Do	you	lie?	That	breaks	your	cover. How	about	holding	up	an	ID	card?	Nope	again.	She	could	easily	ask	you to	pronounce	it	because	not	everyone	there	speaks	perfect	English.	So now	your	goose	is	cooked.	What	to	do,	what	to	do. 	Well	for	starters	you	can	reserve	a	room	by	phone	beforehand	and not	online.	She’ll	ask	for	ID	no	matter	what	so	you	have	to	be	ready.	That means:-	Preparing	a	business	card	beforehand	with	your	website	and	fake email	and	hand	it	to	whoever	asks.	Just	don’t	act	nervous	giving	it	out	or you’ll	find	out	like	Jim	Rockford	did	in	the	70s	that	bad	liars	are	an embarrassment	to	everyone	involved,	so	be	as	supercool	as	Mr.	Orange was	in	Reservoir	Dogs. -	Put	everything	with	your	real	ID	in	a	safe	in	the	room.	Passports too	 you	did	email	yourself	a	copy	in	the	event	it’s	stolen,	right?	Those Pinoy	trikes	have	a	lot	of	sticky	fingers .	If	she	or	he	asks	what’s	in	the safe	just	say	the	next	War	and	Peace	manuscript.	Gold	to	you	but worthless	to	them. -	Only	put	your	fake	email	on	your	luggage	tags,	not	your	real	name. -	Duct-tape	your	passport	and	a	few	hundred	dollars	to	the	inside	of your	suitcase	lining.	Sew	it	back	up	so	the	baggage	handlers	don’t	get suspicious. -	Ensure	the	‘location’	feature	of	any	phone	is	turned	off.	You shouldn’t	even	bring	a	phone	like	this	but	for	the	sake	of	argument	there was	once	a	pinay	who	could	see	that	was	on	E	85th	and	3rd.	She	was	a few	blocks	off	but	close	enough	to	see	where	I	was	staying.   The	10	Best	Phones	for	Anonymity Admittedly,	smartphones	and	burner	phones	can	mean	different things	to	different	people	depending	on	the	laws	of	their	respective countries.	Sometimes	a	burner	is	just	a	prepaid	phone	to	Joe	survivalist: cheap	and	good	to	go	for	when	a	natural	disaster	strikes.	It’ll	get	the	job done.	But	that	isn’t	the	case	with	Fred	the	ex-CIA	guy.	The	word smartphone	is	a	bit	of	a	misnomer	too,	like	‘cat	owner’,	because	in	reality the	phone	will	own	you	if	you	get	sloppy	with	your	opsec. One	advantage	that	you	want	in	a	burner	is	being	able	to	ditch	it	fast. Prepaid	doesn’t	always	fall	into	this	category.	So	you	need	to	be	clear	at the	outset	what	you	intend	to	do	if	the	heat	gets	too	hot.	Plan	B,	to	say. Ditch	it	in	the	river?	But	ditching	a	Blackphone	near	to	where	you live	may	get	you	a	longer	sentence	than	actually	handing	it	over	to	the police.	For	this	reason	it	can	really	pay	to	invest	in	good	mobile security.But	first	let’s	run	through	a	couple	of	sloppy	scenarios	so	you have	an	idea	of	what	not	to	do. 	Scenario	1:	Bad	Weed All	weed	is	bad	if	the	opsec	is	bad.	But	let’s	say	it	isn’t	and	we	live	in a	perfect	world	where	everything	goes	according	to	plan.	Let’s	say	you buy	a	burner	phone	that	Otto	the	bus	driver	recommended.	He	wants	a bag	of	weed.	You	commit	to	it.	You	buy	it	on	the	Deep	Web	and	do	so	far away	from	home.	You	then	dispose	of	it	and	consider	that	number ‘burned’.	Okay	then,	that	seems	smart	enough.	Only	what	works	for	the Deep	Web	doesn’t	fly	so	straight	on	riskier	outlets.	Outlets	like	Craigslist. After	getting	that	bag	of	reefer,	you	get	a	sales	itch. You’ve	smoked	the	bag	yourself	and	figure	to	get	another	one	only when	you	do	you’re	as	high	as	Tommy	Chong	and	order	another	round using	a	non-burner	with	ties	to	your	real	number	on	the	clearnet.	You used	a	burner,	true	enough.	But	not	an	isolated	burner.	You	accessed	Tor using	your	real	phone.	Now	you’re	not	only	at	risk	of	an	LE	arrest,	but	the sheer	number	of	certifiable	psychos	out	there	that	make	Quint	from	Jaws   look	like	Pollyanna	may	just	show	up	on	your	doorstep	because	you	used a	credit	card	over	Tor.	Not	smart. 	Scenario	2:	Bad	Dates,	Good	Dates Burners	make	excellent	date	screeners	too.	No,	not	the	date	Indiana Jones	came	close	to	swallowing.	I	mean	romantic	dates.	You	save	yourself tons	of	hassle	using	a	burner	in	case	the	date	goes	sour	and	you	believe you	should	part	ways	amicably	 but	the	other	party	doesn’t .	A	burner number	thus	can	be	untraceable,	rendering	any	stalker	a	non-threat	-	as long	as	you	didn’t	invite	them	to	your	house. We’re	not	interested	in	buying	a	burner	for	dating,	obviously. We’re	interested	in	what	it’d	take	to	get	away	with	buying something	on	the	Black	Market	in	a	country	that	doesn’t	like	Black Markets.	You	know,	a	control	thing,	the	peasants	vs.	The	Man.	So	as	you flip	through	these	phones	you	need	to	ask	yourself	if	you	can	handle	the heat	that’d	come	down	if	your	identity	happened	to	be	compromised. 	 If	you’re	a	vendor	of	big	crates	of	contraband	 crates	filled	with those	little	green	Toy	Story	aliens	which	are	filled	with,	uh,	green stuff ,	even	the	high-tech	super	spy	Blackphone	will	be	of	little	use since	if	you’re	pulled	over	by	the	cops,	they’re	bound	to	bring	a sniffer	dog	that’ll	give	the	a-okay	to	strip	your	car	to	the	bone. They’ll	find	something.	They	don’t	need	the	burner	 though	granted it’d	be	nice	to	see	your	customer	list	-	any	one	of	which	will	rat	you out .Ditch	your	Glock	before	your	encrypted	phone.	Getting	caught with	a	handgun	while	dealing	anything	shady	is	like	getting	caught with	one	in	Canada.	They’ll	throw	away	the	key	after	they	throw	you in	a	cell	with	snow	gremlins. Cops	love	‘knock	and	talks’.	That’s	when	they	just	want	to	have a	‘little	chat’	to	get	you	to	incriminate	yourself.	Never	answer	the door	if	they	knock.	If	they	have	a	warrant	they’ll	likely	come	in anyway	and	bombard	you	with	questions	while	they	search.	And	on that	topic,	always,	always	make	sure	all	your	lights	work	before driving.	Otherwise	expect	a	‘talk’	on	the	interstate.   Get	a	legal	side	hustle,	hobby,	or	side	dream	to	shoot	for.	With straight-shooting	friends.	If	you	engage	the	cops	for	a	living	to	feed your	kids,	say	selling	guns	to	rival	gang	members	or	even	those granny	biker	gangs	from	Fury	Road,	you’ll	do	serious	time	sooner	or later.	Lady	luck	favors	those	with	more	to	lose. Never,	ever	break	two	laws	at	the	same	time. Bragging	can	get	you	20	years	due	to	this	little	thing	called ‘gossip’	-	your	uncle	Spanky,	your	siblings,	your	girlfriend.	More	on the	finer	details	of	Dark	Personas	in	later	chapters. If	you’re	the	best	business	in	town	then	people	will	talk.	Your name	will	be	passed	around	to	undesirables.	Burner	phones	cannot prevent	this.   Blackphone  Designed	by	an	entrepreneur,	a	technology	expert,	a	cryptographer and	a	former	Navy	SEAL,	the	Blackphone	does	just	what	it	claims	to	do.	It protects	you	from	the	prying	eyes	of	the	NSA	and	a	few	more	of	it’s	Big Data	brothers.	Unfortunately	this	protection	comes	at	a	high	price:	$629. Not	cheap.	But	for	rock-solid	security	you	could	do	a	lot	worse. It	uses	PrivatOS,	an	operating	system	that	gives	you	100%	control over	who	or	what	an	app	talks	to.	Another	plus	is	the	preventative measures	that	kick	in	when	you	power	it	on:	Protection	from	hackers and	identity	thieves	or	just	some	back-alley	kid	whose	eying	your	phone in	Wendy’s	like	Gollum’s	fishing	buddy. 	   The	specs	are	as	follows: 	Screen	Size:	4.7”	 1280	*	720    Display	Technology:	4.7”	IPS	HD Technology:	Capacitive	>4	point	multi-touch 	Camera Sensor	size	main	camera	8	MP	AF Type	of	camera	flash:	Flash	LED Front	camera	5MP	FF 	Connectivity Single	micro-SIM	slot Bluetooth	Class	4.0	LE Wi-Fi	802.11b g n Micro	USB 3.5mm	audio	jack 	Hardware Processor:	Quad-core	2GHz	System	on	Chip	 SoC  Platform:	NVIDIA	Tegra	4i 	Need	a	good	camera	to	give	to	a	scout	in	enemy	territory?	Try	the Blackphone’s	8	megapixel	rear	cam.	It’s	not	top	of	the	line	but	then	the front	cam	is	5	megapixels	and	16GB	internal	storage,	so	it’s	sufficient	for surveillance	work.	The	other	plus	is	the	CPU:	an	Nvidia	Tegra	4i	chip. As	a	rule	most	cameras	aren’t	terribly	friendly	to	privacy	to	begin with,	considering	the	metadata	available	within	the	images. Then	there’s	the	GPS	stamps.	But	the	device	has	to	be	compromised before	it	can	be	abused.	If	it’s	compromised,	anything	else	you	do	on	the device	is	no	longer	private	anyway. So	how	anonymous	is	it?	The	short	answer	is	very	anonymous.	But like	I	said,	it’s	pricey,	but	at	what	cost	security?	To	that	I’d	say	that	as	far as	anonymity	goes	all	the	apps	bundled	with	the	device	 if	you	bought them	individually 	would	cost	you	more	than	the	phone	itself.	Things like:-	an	included	1	year	membership	to	Silent	Suite -	A	1-year	“Friends	and	Family”	Silent	Circle	Subscription -	1	year	of	encrypted	web	browsing	from	Disconnect,	1GB month   -	1	year	of	secure	cloud	backup	from	SpiderOak,	5GB month 	It	also	has	the	ability	to	remote	wipe.	The	PrivatOS	got	this	one right.Granted,	you	have	to	create	an	account	for	this	to	work.	But	it’s	like holding	a	handheld	nuclear	launch	code	device.	If	your	phone’s	been stolen,	if	you’ve	loaned	it	to	Harry	whose	been	suspiciously	absent	from meetings	for	the	last	few	days,	or	your	sister	‘borrowed’	it	and	loaned	it to	her	best	friend’s	golf	partner’s	brother-in-law,	then	fire	and	forget. Remote	Wipe	is	a	dream	option. There’s	also	the	Kismet	Smarter	WiFi	Manager.	This	app	memorizes your	trusted	networks	by	triangulating	cell	towers	within	the	area.	It comes	preconfigured	to	make	any	kind	of	spoofing	of	your	network	very very	difficult.	If	you	travel	out	of	any	established	circle	of	‘trusted networks’,	the	app	turns	off	WiFi	and	your	MAC	address. Since	the	app	can	turn	off	WiFi	that	means	you	won’t	be broadcasting	your	home	network	name	to	every	Joe	Schmo	within earshot.	Lots	of	random	attacks	by	bored	hackers	and	script	kiddies	tend to	undo	people	who	don’t	care.	If	they	know	your	network’s	name	they can	spoof	it	and	begin	running	all	kinds	of	scripts	that	sniff	every	byte	of your	traffic.	That	leads	a	trail	to	your	front	door. If	you	bite	the	bullet	and	purchase	this,	check	out	the	Disconnect Secure	Wireless	service,	a	VPN	that	encrypts	everything	you	do	online. What	this	app	does	is	send	all	traffic	via	proxy	to	kill	any	tracking	data inserted	into,	say,	Supercookies.	One	click	and	done. Two	other	must-have	apps	come	preinstalled.	They	are: -	Silent	Phone -	and	Silent	Text 	I	was	skeptical	of	both	of	these	until	I	learned	that	the	designer	was none	other	than	Phil	Zimmermann	of	the	original	PGP	encryption	suite. So	I	trust	the	crypto	behind	it.	Any	video	or	chat	session	can	give	you encrypted	messages.	Better	still	is	the	‘Burn	Notice’	function,	a	Silent Text	feature	that	allows	users	to	decide	how	long	a	message	is	available before	deleting	it	from	both	the	sending	and	the	receiving	device. According	to	designers	at	Silent	Circle,	the	burn	timer	works	differently   for	the	sender	and	the	receiver	of	the	message: -	For	the	sender,	the	timer	will	start	as	soon	as	the	message	is	sent. -	For	the	person	receiving	the	message,	the	timer	will	start	once	the message	as	been	displayed	on	Silent	Text’s	conversation	screen. These	are	the	highlights. Unfortunately,	opsec	isn’t	a	product	one	can	buy.	It’s	a	24 7	mindset where	90%	of	the	reasons	you’ll	get	caught	have	more	to	do	with	your offline	self	than	anything	you	do	online.	Most	newcomers	to	the philosophy	of	opsec	aren’t	able	to	do	this	because	we	humans	are	wired to	trust	rather	than	doubt. All	of	this	is	not	to	suggest	the	Blackphone	is	perfect.	It’s	not.	In	fact when	it	debuted	in	2014,	a	fair	share	of	bugs	had	come	out	and	more than	one	site	pointed	it	out.	Remember	though	that	whenever	these issues	are	found,	they	are	fixed	promptly.   Blackphone	2 Blackphone	2 ‘burner’	phone	that	you’d	toss	away,	the Far	from	being	a	 Blackphone’s	successor	just	may	be	the	most	unhackable	smartphone	to ever	come	along.	But	unhackable	to	whom? That’s	the	million	dollar	question	you	need	to	answer	before	you plop	down	over	$700	bucks	for	one.	Are	you	a	secret	agent?	Double agent?	Hacker?	NSA	escapee?	Or	are	you	just	a	businessman	on	his	way to	China	who	needs	something	hack-proof? Right	out	of	the	gate	you’ll	notice	it’s	based	around	a	Google operating	system.	You’re	shaking	your	head,	I	know.	So	was	I.	Avoid Google.	Full	stop.	Go	with	something	like	Gentoo	Linux	with	SELinux	if you	want	a	secure	smartphone.	And	you’re	right.	If	you	need	serious security	to	avoid	any	state	surveillance,	that’s	the	golden	route.	In	fact	if you’ve	got	an	alphabet	agency	after	you,	don’t	use	a	smartphone	at	all. But	for	everyone	else	out	there	whose	last	name	isn’t	Snowden,	read	on. The	phone	itself	is	a	miniature	version	of	the	black	slab	in	2001:	A Space	Odyssey,	the	one	that	killed	the	entire	team.	Monolithic	and	eerie looking,	the	specs	are	a	decent	upgrade	from	it’s	younger	brother,	but	as we’ll	see	the	real	meat	and	potatoes	is	the	ease	of	use	it	gives	you. Display	Screen:	5.5inches,	1080p	LCD CPU:	octacore	Qualcomm	Snapdragon	615 RAM:	3GB Storage:	32GB;	microSD	slot	Operating	system:	Silent	OS	2	built	on Android	5.1.1 Camera:	13MP	rear	camera,	5MP	front-facing	camera	Connectivity: LTE,	Wi-Fi,	Bluetooth	and	GPS Dimensions:	152	x	76	x	7.9mm	Weight:	165g   	   The	Good: Multitasking:	A	dream!	The	Snapdragon	615	handled	everything	I threw	at	it	except	for	games,	and	there’s	little	sense	in	those	since	that’s   not	what	you’re	buying	the	device	for. 	Charge:	Lasted	me	almost	a	full	day,	but	the	way	I	bounce	around apps	drained	a	lot	of	juice	from	the	device,	so	I	had	to	use	it	sparingly	to not	have	to	charge	it	every	day. 	Useability:	There	was	little	visual	difference	from	stock	Android, with	no	penalties	in	the	Google	Play	Store.	What’s	available	on	my Samsung	Galaxy	Tab	4	is	available	here. 	Security:	The	Stock	Android	appearance	is	misleading.	There’s	tons of	security	settings	under	the	hood	for	you	though.	You	don’t	even	need the	Security	Center	app	to	hold	your	hand	either	 though	you	can	if	you want .	You	can	set	any	app	to	only	have	access	to	location	data,	the	web, or	nothing.	Up	to	you. It	reminded	me	a	lot	of	the	Cyanogen	OS,	which	I	highly	recommend if	you’re	unfamiliar	with	it.	A	few	of	the	goodies	are	as	follows: Define	‘spaces’	where	Google	cannot	tread.	Within	this	space,	it is	‘jailed’	in	a	sense,	and	one	space	cannot	share	data	with	another.	I had	one	for	my	contacts,	work	data,	writing	docs,	taxes	and	email, with	each	being	in	their	own	‘space’	and	not	able	to	reach	over	the fence,	so	to	speak. Manage	which	apps	live	in	each	space. Quarantine	any	app	if	you	only	want	to	test	drive	it.	That	way	if a	catastrophe	ensues,	the	damage	is	contained.	Think	of	what	the bomb	disposal	guys	do	with	the	bomb.	Similar	effect	of	running	a suspicious	app	in	a	VM	 virtual	machine . Security	updates	are	quick	and	easy	to	install. Though	pricey,	you	pay	for	the	software’s	development	and ecosystem	which	fuel	the	many	features	it	has.	Sure,	an	iPhone	is	a snuggier	fit	for	the	average	Joe	than	this	phone,	and	as	the	hardware is	faster	and	sleeker,	it’s	easy	to	learn,	and	access	to	the	iOS	system is	unmatched.	But	then	the	Blackphone	never	claims	to	take	the place	of	the	iPhone	for	end	users	anyway,	and	it’s	not	a	patch	on	the Blackphone	if	what	you	really	need	is	security	or	anonymity.   According	to	Silent	Circle	they	had	a	high	level	of	cooperation from	Qualcomm,	and	are	working	on	having	a	fully	audited baseband.

The	Ugly Having	lived	in	Niagara	Falls	I	could	write	a	book	on	my	encounters with	Toronto	police	and	how	invasive	and	downright	horrifying	it	can	be to	get	a	snarky	one	on	a	rainy	day,	double	that	for	a	border	officer.	That snarkiness	gets	worse	if	you	get	sent	to	secondary	inspection.	The	kicker is	that	this	is	just	the	phone	to	get	you	there	all	the	quicker	if	you	take	the bait	they’ll	drop	-	which	they	always	do. Visually,	it’s	a	remarkable	little	security	device.

I   see	cars	turned	inside	out	as	I	drive	into	Buffalo,	NY	from	Canada	all	the time,	though	I	see	many	more	if	it’s	a	national	holiday.

These	guys	put	up	with	a	lot	of	juvenile	acts	every	day	and the	last	thing	you	want	is	to	whip	out	a	pricey,	hardened,	hackle-raising security	phone	if	you	need	to	be	low-profile. They	want	to	see	a	phone	like	this.	It	makes	the	hot	summer	day	all the	more	bearable	and	giving	you	a	hard	time	is	the	icing	on	the	cake.   Boeing’s	‘Black’	Phone	of	Self- Destruction III.	Boeing’s	‘Black’	Phone	of	Self-Destruction 	Before	you	whip	out	your	wallet,	know	that	this	phone	cannot	be purchased	by	end	users	like	you	and	I.	But	if	you’re	an	employee	with security	clearance,	that	means	you’ve	already	consented	to	have	any online	actions	monitored	anyway	so	it’s	likely	game	over	before	you	even fire	up	this	baby. The	insides	are	nothing	special:	-	a	1.2	Ghz	Cortex	CPU,	a	4.3	screen and	average	1590	battery.	What’s	unusual	is	the	‘trusted	module’ satellite-uplink	 ability	 along	 with	 hardware-designed	 storage	 for encrypted	data.	It’s	pretty	neat	if	you	can	get	it	but	becomes	outdated rather	quickly. Then	there’s	the	‘Pure	Secure’	security	design	by	Boeing	which resists	all	forms	of	spoofing	or	modding	-	which	means	no	root	access.	So much	for	making	it	non-trackable	to	the	NSA. 	   The	specs	may	seem	lacking	but	for	a	government	employee	there’s probably	acceptable	specs	for	whatever	the	government	wants	him	to do.	For	all	we	know	they	won’t	come	in	contact	with	the	internet	at	all. Maybe	email	and	productive	apps	like	databases	and	NSA	slideshows. Who	knows. Side	note:	At	the	other	end	is	the	transparency	for	a	big	name corporation.	Take	a	company	like	Lockheed.	Now	think	of	an	outfit	like Northrup	Grumman,	a	leading	global	security	company	that	provides   products	in	unmanned	systems,	cybersecurity,	C4ISR,	and	other	slick services.Would	it	be	a	terrible	thing	for	an	intelligence	agency	to	intercept some	lackey	at	Northrup	who	conspired	with	a	Lockheed	employee	to send	a	text	to	the	Peruvian	embassy?	Maybe	he	offered	to	exchange	some interesting	maps	for	the	secret	of	ceviche?	Well	maybe	he	did.	Maybe	he didn’t.Nonetheless,	whenever	you	get	a	phone	this	specialized,	it’s	almost always	used	for	other	big	hardware	that	no	one	else	has.	If	it’s	stolen, most	of	the	time	they	can’t	use	it. But	I	thought	you	should	know	of	it	in	case	you’re	wandering around	the	Boeing	plant	one	day	and	happen	to	see	some	fuzzy- mustached	manager	named	Bucky	Goldstein	yakking	into	one	of	these. Know	that	he’s	got	a	good	piece	of	tech	in	his	hands	that	he’s	not	likely	to loan	out	-	but	no	way	is	he	evading	his	Big	Brother	the	NSA.   Blackberry IV. 	BlackBerry 	BlackBerry	made	headlines	last	year	when	it	acquired	Secusmar,	the German-based	voice-data	encryption	company	with	a	penchant	for waging	war	against	well-funded	eavesdroppers	like	the	NSA.	Prior	to	the acquisition,	they’d	worked	together	to	pad	BlackBerry	devices	with	high security	for	a	few	high-profile	politicians,	one	of	which	was	Angela Merkel.Yep,	that	Angela	Merkel,	Chancellor	of	Germany. The	same	Merkel	that	the	NSA	spied	on	and	who	later	rightly	told Obama	off	by	phone,	BlackBerry	to	BlackBerry.  Notifications:	Android	has	a	far	better	notification	system	than	other devices.	Anonymity	programs	like	Orbot	and	pretty	much	any	security app	rely	on	notifications	for	mission-critical	network	issues. 	   the	 best	  Keyboard:	 Hands	 down,	 Blackberry	 offers	 typing experience	on	the	market.	They	are	at	the	top	of	a	very	short	list	of makers	who	design	physical-keyboard	phones	these	days.	In	fact	I’ve noticed	my	words-per-minute	increased	quite	drastically	the	more	I	used it.	This	may	be	insignificant	in	a	dangerous	country	like	Iran	or Zamboanga,	Philippines,	but	while	most	average	Joes	want	some	level	of security	on	their	phone,	it	usually	comes	second	to	features	and	usability. 	Future	Customers	&	Support:	After	spending	a	month	researching the	BlackBerry	market	I	can	tell	you	that	I	was	taken	aback	when	I discovered	how	much	they’ve	cut	back	on	marketing	and	administration. They	dropped	from	almost	$400	million	to	$200	million.	People	who don’t	follow	markets	might	think	that’s	par	for	the	course,	but	it	isn’t. That’s	big	bucks.	Huge	bucks.	In	fact	it’s	almost	as	if	BlackBerry	doesn’t want	to	grow.	And	they	 need	to	grow	but	with	these	kind	of	budget slashes	it’s	unlikely	many	new	customers	will	be	forthcoming	in	future years.So	what	does	this	mean	for	security? It	means	patches	to	exploits	and	security	holes	will	be	filled sparingly,	if	at	all.	A	bad	thing.	The	silver	lining	is	that,	much	like	a	few non-Windows	systems,	BlackBerry	may	simply	cease	to	be	interesting	to most	hackers	out	there.	There	simply	won’t	be	enough	people	using them	to	justify	exploits	or	hacktivism	or	extortion-by-virus	dry	runs.	But that	isn’t	nearly	enough	to	make	up	for	the	bad. There’s	also	the	fact	that	much	of	the	top	sales	come	from	South Africa.	For	the	record	I	don’t	think	that	it’s	CIA	operatives	either.	More than	likely	it’s	teenagers	being	able	to	talk	incognito	without	fear	of	the parents	butting	into	their	business.	Teenagers	who’d	rather	use	a physical	keyboard	than	a	touch	screen.	Teenagers	that	use	BB7	phones rather	than	the	BB10s.	The	handwriting	on	the	wall	seems	to	be	that within	5	years	we’ll	see	BlackBerry	folding	up	the	big	tent	and	heading elsewhere. As	to	Blackberry’s	security	abilities	in	the	here	and	now,	read	on	to the	next	section.   BlackBerry	Security If	you’re	an	Android	user	you	may	wonder	just	how	secure BlackBerry	really	is.	What	makes	the	network	itself	more	secure	than Android?Well	the	truth	of	it	is	that	security	is	tough	to	implement	and tougher	to	stay	on	top	of.	The	king	of	the	fortress	must	protect	every entry	point	in	the	entire	estate,	while	any	foreign	invader	only	needs	one vulnerability	to	exploit.	That’s	because	they	only	have	to	get	lucky	once. Security	even	on	BlackBerry	is	only	as	strong	as	its	weakest	link.	That’s you,	my	friend. It’s	not	entirely	different	than	electricity	or	a	home	invader,	for	both follow	the	path	of	least	resistance.	But	if	you	lock	down	your	fortress with	airtight	security	and	fill	your	moat	to	the	brim	with	piranha	yet forget	about	the	secret	entrance	leading	up	from	the	sewers,	well	there goes	your	security	plan.	Right	out	the	window.	The	best	guard	in	the world	can’t	defend	against	an	arrow	to	the	back	of	the	neck. To	it’s	credit,	BlackBerry	has	something	called	COPE,	which	stands for	Company	Owned	Personally	Enabled	Devices.	You	can	read	why	this is	good	security	elsewhere	but	suffice	it	to	say	its	what	your	security needs	are	that	counts. A	friend	of	mine	in	Korea	says	he	as	well	as	his	family	all	receive malware-phishing	texts	on	a	daily	basis.	Usually	they’re	the	kind	with fake	links,	but	look	like	the	genuine	article.	If	you	click	on	the	link	using an	Android	phone,	your	screen	gets	sent	to	the	thief.	Now	he	can	see	it all.	He	says	this	is	a	widespread	problem	in	South	Korea,	but	only	on Android	phones.	Not	so	in	a	BlackBerry.   Jailbroken	Phones  take	steps	to	secure	it	yourself.  One	of	the	biggest	differences	between	Android,	iPhone	and BlackBerry	is	that	BlackBerry	is	designed	with	good	security	from	the first	layer	on	up	at	the	hardware	level.	For	many	others	such	hardened security	begins	at	the	app	level	-	the	surface	of	an	operating	system.	If you	jailbreak	your	phone	then	that	trust-module	is	broken	and	any hacker	worth	his	salt	can,	on	his	worst	day,	grab	data	housed	between the	operating	system	level	and	the	application	level	but	only	if	you	don’t That’s	the	tradeoff	with	a	jailbroken	phone.	You	get	more	flexibility and	convenience	but	at	the	cost	of	security.	It	works	the	other	way around,	too.	With	more	security	comes	less	flexibility.	Take	your	BBM messages,	for	instance.	It’s	very	difficult,	unlike	on	Android,	for	contacts such	as	those	in	an	address	book	to	be	sent	elsewhere	without	your approval.	You’re	the	one	in	charge	of	who	you	converse	with.	Deny	them or	accept	them.	Can	you	deny	the	government? Yes,	you	can,	by	using	whatever	standard	of	encryption	you	desire on	a	BES	server.	That	said,	you	can	be	compelled	by	a	judge	to	fork	over your	password	as	is	the	case	with	many	who	were	arrested	for	tax evasion.	The	way	around	this	is	to	never	allow	your	IP	address	or	any other	identifying	information	about	you	to	find	its	way	into	the	hands	of an	adversary.	And	these	days,	learning	how	to	hide	your	IP	address	is	the kindergarten	equivalent	of	learning	the	alphabet.   Encrypting	Files	on	BlackBerry There	exists	several	different	encryption	apps	you	can	use	on BlackBerry	for	anonymous	messaging.	My	personal	favorite	is	PGP,	but then	its	an	app	that’s	had	over	a	decade	of	development.	Thought	it works	beautifully	on	BlackBerry,	there	may	come	a	day	when	you	simply want	to	encrypt	files	natively	without	the	help	of	any	third	party	apps. Here’s	how:	-	From	your	home	screen,	swipe	down -	Choose	settings,	security	and	privacy	-	encryption	-	From	here	you can	choose	any	of	these:	Set	Device-Encryption	to	On Set	Media	Card	Encryption	to	On Set	your	device’s	password	 required 	You	will	find	that	it’s	not possible	to	select	files folders	by	themselves	to	encrypt	but	rather	the entire	device media	card.   Decrypting	Files  Choose	Settings,	then	Encryption	Move	slider	to	Media	or	Device from	On	to	Off	Enter	the	password	you	set	previously	Important:	Know that	implementing	the	above	gives	you	an	encryption	key	native	to	your phone	so	that	if	you	erase	this	device	then	the	key	gets	erased	as	well.	If that	happens,	any	data	that	was	on	this	device	is	unaccessible	without that	key.	To	put	this	in	perspective,	if	you	lose	your	BlackBerry	but	still retain	your	microSD	card	that	has	your	encrypted	files	 encrypted	by	the system	that	is	now	in	the	hands	of	someone	else ,	you	cannot	get	your files	on	the	microSD	back	either,	even	if	you	use	a	new	BlackBerry.	This is	linked	to	the	system	password	on	the	device	itself. The	following	apps	come	highly	recommended	should	you	need	a third-party	app	that	encrypts	individual	files: Keepsafe	Photo	Vault	-	Hide	Pictures	And	Videos	Titan	Files Max	Hide	&	Encrypt Secret	Keeper 	One	thing	to	note	is	that	when	you	encrypt	your	entire	device,	any caller’s	name	won’t	appear	once	the	device	goes	into	a	locked	state. You’ll	see	their	number	but	not	their	identity.	The	reason	for	this	is because	the	device	memory	becomes	partially-encrypted	with	each instance	of	unlocking	the	device.	Some	users	choose	to	encrypt	only	the microSD	card	for	this	very	reason. Once	again,	let	me	restate	that	wiping	your	device	will	render	the microSD	card	UNRECOVERABLE	unless	it	is	decrypted	first.	The password	is	only	used	to	encrypt	the	key,	and	the	key	is	randomly generated.	This	is	why	the	entire	device	doesn’t	have	to	be	re-encrypted when	you	change	your	password.   How	to	Disable	Automatic	OS Updates	on	BlackBerry	10 If	there	is	one	thing	I’ve	always	hated	about	operating	systems	out of	the	box,	it’s	automatic	updates.	I	loathe	them.	Android	is	notorious	for this	and	it	was	the	first	thing	I	changed	when	buying	a	Samsung	Galaxy tablet	a	few	years	back. BlackBerry	isn’t	much	different	and	many	encryption	users	simply don’t	like	auto-updates	since	they	tend	to	break	personalized	settings and	heaven	only	knows	what	else.	Where	security	is	concerned,	you want	full	control	over	your	device	since	one	update	can	destroy	your anonymity. Often	whenever	a	new	update	is	released,	if	the	device	is	WiFi- connected	the	update	is	downloaded	in	the	background	and	installed automatically.	Then	the	user	is	suddenly	asked	to	restart.	Not	good. He	could	be	in	an	important	business	meeting	in	the	middle	of	a presentation	when	this	happens.	Or	on	a	stakeout	and	get	the	update	just when	the	crap	is	about	to	hit	the	fan.	Not	fun	for	a	device	that	brags about	being	the	best	around	at	security	when	it	never	 asks	you	for permission	to	start	with. So	here’s	how	we	turn	it	off: -	Choose	Settings,	then	Software	Updates.	Look	towards	the	bottom of	the	Updates	page	and	choose	Options. -	In	the	Options	page,	the	slider	is	present	to	Enable Disable Updates.	Choose	according	to	your	needs.   Cheap	Phones   Older	&	Generic	Burner	Phones	 aka Need	an	emergency	phone?	Then	you	don’t	need	an	expensive Blackphone.	Give	the	TracFone	a	spin.	They	own	Net10	&	StraightTalk, both	prepaid	carriers,	and	make	a	few	‘bare	bones’	phones	that’ll	do	the job	just	fine.	The	trade	off	is	limited	support.	We’ll	discuss	those	at	length along	with	a	few	phones	I’ve	used	that	aren’t	really	phones	at	all.	That means	no	GPS,	3G	or	even	LTE.	But	you	get	a	much	longer-lasting battery.	There’s	pros	and	cons	to	every	one	of	them. If	on	the	other	hand	you	need	something	for	‘special’	emergencies, then	GPS	is	the	last	thing	you	want.	Here’s	why. Let’s	say	a	cell	tower	pings	your	burner	phone’s	location	every	15 minutes	or	so,	then	saves	the	geolocation	data	and	time	stamp.	A determined	adversary	might	be	able	to	query	events	where	phone	A  your	super	secret	prepaid	phone 	was	within	30	feet	of	a	not-so-secret phone	B	for	6	hours	or	so,	with	work driving	time	factored	into	it	too. How	do	we	prevent	this	from	happening? The	simple	way	is	to	never	leave	Phone	A	powered	on	anywhere near	your	real-identity	phone	 phone	B .	In	fact	secret	phone	A	should always,	without	question,	remain	stored	at	a	distant	location	even	if	it’s in	a	storage	unit	with	your	real	name	front	and	center. As	long	as	the	battery’s	taken	out. This	battery	only	gets	removed	if	you	need	to	‘go	dark’.	That’s	when the	real	phone	is	far	away	from	you	and	believe	me	there’s	far	less	risk this	way.	If	you	neglect	to	do	this,	an	adversary	with	sufficient	resources  pretty	much	anyone	with	a	shiny	badge	these	days 	can	pinpoint	both signals	and	correlate	them	to	your	real	identity. At	any	rate,	as	we	go	through	these	cheap	phones,	remember	what your	security	needs	are	and	that	no	amount	of	cash	is	too	much	for	good security.	You	get	what	you	pay	for	in	this	life,	and	good	lawyers	are	more expensive	that	good	phones	and	good	opsec.   Nokia	Lumia	520  This	phone	makes	a	great	burner	phone	as	it’s	so	cheap.	Being	a Windows	phone,	you’ll	have	to	tweak	it	to	whatever	anonymity	services you	require.	Add	to	that	there’s	a	mile-long	list	at	the	end	in	the	next section	where	I	cover	anonymity	apps.	The	bonus	is	that	it’s	a	steal	at under	$50	bucks	on	Amazon.	When	searching	for	a	phone,	I	typically read	the	1-star	reviews	first	to	gauge	whether	it’s	a	deal	killer	or	not. Now	for	the	stats.  Cons	-	Not	all	that	glitters	is	gold.	In	other	words,	don’t	expect	the gold	standard	for	such	a	small	price.	This	phone	is	lousy	for	hikers	on	the Appalachian	trail	in	need	of	good	GPS,	but	for	cloak	and	dagger	purposes it	fits	the	bill	nicely. Odd	Camera	-	Flash	is	non-existent	and	there’s	no	front	camera either.	Photo	quality	is	also	quite	poor	for	those	photographer-tourists who	always	seem	to	wander	into	North	Korea. Limited	Customization	-	The	520	doesn’t	sport	too	much	in	the	way   of	separate	profiles	with	different	settings.	I	like	to	keep	my	work	profile separate	from	my	home	profile,	with	each	having	a	distinct	ring	tone	 my ghost	phone	has	no	volume	setting .	The	volume	settings	on	the	Lumia refused	to	allow	me	to	make	the	two	distinct.	Mind	you	it	 does	offer volume,	just	not	for	many	profiles. App	Inferiority	-	You	get	what	you	pay	for.	The	many	apps	for	the Lumia	520	are	quite	humble	next	to	what’s	offered	for	Android.	And that’s	the	silver	lining.	Modern,	whiz-bang	apps	found	on	Android	often have	trackers	that	are	difficult	to	disable	and	like	to	‘phone	home’	far	too often	for	my	liking. 	Moto	G	-	Prepaid	Version Another	great	burner	phone.	It	uses	Android	and	comes	at	under $100	at	Amazon.  Specs:	4.5	inch	720p	HD	TFT	display	Quad-core	1.2GHz	processor with	450MHz	UMTS	HSPA+,	CDMA	EVDO	Rev	A	5MP	rear	camera,	plus front	facing	camera,	8GB	Internal	Memory   This	is	the	one	you	want	if	your	on	a	budget.	When	I	first	test	drove this	I	wanted	to	see	if	I	could	use	it	as	a	WiFi	mini-tablet.	I	skipped activation	and	ended	up	giving	them	no	info	at	all	and	it’s	worked	fine ever	since.	Just	swipe	off-screen	and	go	into	options,	then	turn	airplane mode	on.	After	doing	this	it	didn’t	access	any	mobile	network	and	never prompted	me	at	all,	so	I	just	set	wifi	to	on	or	off	manually. It’s	a	nice	little	mini	tablet.	Good	for	privacy.	Security?	You	can	do better,	and	a	Samsung	Galaxy	Tab	she	ain’t.	But	it	has	decent	resolution and	can	be	used	with	Flixter,	Amazon	App	store,	Google	Play	and	even games.	You’ll	get	two	free	texts	with	Verizon	so	you’ll	know	if	it’s working	or	not.   Motorola	EX-431G  The	next	excellent	burner	is	the	Motorola	EX-431G,	a	TracFone	that comes	with	a	keyboard	and	triple-plus	minutes	for	life.	The	price	varies between	twenty	and	forty	dollars	and	like	before,	you	get	what	you	pay for.	This	is	a	feature	phone	and	not	an	Android	phone.	That	means	no unlimited	talk,	text	and	internet,	so	if	you	want	a	plan	like	that	then	you’ll need	to	use	their	sister	company,	StraightTalk.	The	stats	are	as	follows: Full	QWERTY	Keyboard	Double Triple	Minutes	 depends	on	model 	2MP CameraMP3	Player MicroSD	Card	 up	to	32GB 	Mobile	Web Bluetooth Hands-Free	Speaker	FM	Radio 500	Entry	Phone	Book	Voicemail,	Caller	ID,	Call	Waiting,	Alarm Clock   Motorola	Moto	G	 3rd	Generation  A	bit	expensive	for	a	burner	phone,	but	at	$179,	I	peg	this	little phone	mainly	for	those	needing	sanity	over	anonymity,	like	parents	with kids	since	it’s	waterproof,	but	can	also	be	great	for	grandmas,	bathrooms with	soapy	floors	and	cars	in	need	of	better	communications.

The	display	isn’t	the	best	and	1GB	is	pretty	minimal	but	it	handles like	a	much	more	expensive	device	and	as	expected	Android	didn’t	cough up	any	problems.	The	camera	too	plays	nice	with	the	owner	and	since	it ships	with	IPX7	-	which	allows	for	half	an	hour	submersion	in	water w no	damage	-	you	could	do	a	lot	worse.	One	major	con	though	is	that the	battery	is	NOT	removable.	Remember	what	we	said	about	the	NSA being	able	to	track	phones	with	the	battery	still	inside.   Motorola	i355	Radio Cell	Phone This	is	the	survivalist’s	dream	phone.	It’s	cheap	at	around	$15	at most	places	like	ebay,	and	fast.	It	also	supports	Direct	Talk.	Direct	Talk	in case	you’re	wondering	is	when	a	phone	has	the	ability	 like	many	Nextel phones 	to	grant	2-way	radio	chat,	effectively	bypassing	the	cell	towers.	It needs	a	sim	card	to	be	able	to	do	this,	but	the	sim	card	doesn’t	actually connect	to	a	network tower. The	older	DirectConnect	involved	two	phones	connecting	to	a	cell tower	and	from	there	all	messages	were	relayed	to	wherever.	But	Direct Talk	bypasses	cell	towers	completely.	This	came	about	because	many Nextel	customers	found	their	jobs	bringing	them	to	areas	that	required walkie-talkies.	This	solved	that	problem	nicely. 	  Points	to	Note 	The	range	varies	but	3	miles	out	is	not	uncommon.	Believe	it	or	not, having	a	good	antenna	 that	is,	extending	it 	helps	this	range considerably.   	 Incognito	one-on-one	calls	are	supported,	even	group	calls.	You can	even	have	twenty	users	participate	in	a	group	call	if	their	close enough.	This	is	ideal	for	everyone	but	hunters	since	the	‘blip’	sound is	fairly	loud. The	i355	was	once	one	of	Nextel’s	babies	on	the	iDen	network  now	defunct	and	why	they’re	so	darned	cheap	now .	To	use	a	sim from	a	different	network	you	must	have	an	unlock	code	which	is about	twenty	bucks	or	so	from	an	online	‘unlock	shop‘. This	isn’t	to	say	the	i355	is	the	only	DirectTalk	phone.	There	are others	that	support	it,	mostly	Nextel	phones. Nextel	ic402 Nextel	ic502 Nextel	ic602 Nextel	ic902 Nextel	i275 Nextel	i315 Nextel	i325 Nextel	i335 Nextel	i355 Nextel	i365 Nextel	i425 Nextel	i455 Nextel	i560 Nextel	i570 Nextel	i580 Nextel	i615 Nextel	i670 Nextel	i760 Nextel	i776 Nextel	i850 Nextel	i870 Nextel	i880   Samsung	S150G	 TracFone  Next	up	is	the	Samsung	S150G,	also	a	TracFone.	In	the	also-bought section	at	Amazon,	you	probably	saw	like	I	did	that	some	phones advertised	as	‘Prepaid’	aren’t	so	cheap.	The	price	sometimes	doesn’t justify	what	you	get	as	you	don’t	need	to	spend	$50	dollars	for	a	burner phone.	This	Tracphone	though	can	be	had	for	as	little	as	$10	bucks.	Not quite	the	i355,	but	then	few	are. 	  On	the	Samsung	SGH-S150G	you’ll	find	a	large	keypad	with	large buttons	that	make	dialing	numbers	and	typing	text	messages	easy.	And that’s	a	lifesaver	in	a	hard	storm	with	50MPH	winds.	The	specs	are	as follows:	TracFone	Double	Minutes	features	an	LCD	color	display	Auto redial   Keypad	lock Alarm	clock Phonebook	with	up	to	1,000	entries	Polyphonic	ringtones Talk	Time:	up	to	15	hours Standby	Time:	10.4	days Includes	battery,	charger,	activation	card	and	services	guide   Disaster	Preparedness I	bought	one	of	the	aforementioned	prepaid	phones	in	2015	in Ontario,	Canada	with	cash	just	to	see	if	I	could	be	truly	anonymous	in doing	so.	Wal-Mart	was	the	buying	place	and	I	knew	there’d	be	security cam	footage	that	could	identify	me	as	the	buyer,	both	in	the	store,	in	the parking	lot	and	on	the	streetlight	cams. If	I’d	wanted	to	I	could’ve	rigged	a	fairly	good	disguise	that’d	throw off	a	decent	investigator	I	suppose	but	I	wasn’t	engaged	in	anything shady	 sigh 	so	I	just	waltzed	in	like	a	wino	off	the	street.	When	I activated	it	at	a	nearby	college,	something	struck	me	as	it	began	to	rain. These	types	of	phones	are	ideal	for	being	disaster-prepared	as	the charge	outlasts	fully-fledged	smartphones	and	tablets	by	a	country	mile. If	you	want	some	extra	insurance,	you	could	even	buy	a	couple	of additional	$10	phones	to	get	the	extra	batteries	 what	they’d	cost	on most	sites	anyway . In	a	looting	and	flood	situation	where	you’ve	got	gangs	roaming	the streets	and	breaking	into	BestBuy	to	steal	LCD	TVs	 a	la	Katrina ,	these simple	cheap	burners	could	be	life-savers	for	your	entire	family.	Better yet,	several	families	joined	at	the	hip	and	coordinating	security	and ration	procedures	might	save	everyone	involved	from	ending	up	like those	poor	Joes	stranded	at	the	New	Orleans	Superdome	during Hurricane	Katrina. Another	reason	to	have	several	is	the	FCC.	They	require	that	all	cell phones	must	have	911-call	ability	even	if	you’re	not	with	any	carrier.	For this	reason	I	rarely	throw	out	my	old	devices.	Many	can	still	dial	911, with	the	Emergency	Dialer	usually	located	at	the	bottom	of	the	locked phone. 	Points	to	Note You	may	find	yourself	stranded	in	a	hurricane.	Or	a	civil	war. Voice	may	be	down,	so	you	need	to	learn	how	to	text	or	get	a	UHF	&   GMRS	radio	to	contact	family	and	loved	ones.	Cell	phone	companies usually	install	just	enough	equipment	to	handle	normal	peak	usage. So	if	a	large	number	of	people	all	try	to	talk	at	once	it	can	cause	a	lot of	issues	even	when	everything	is	working	optimally. When	the	Cincinnati	bridge	collapsed	in	2007,	cell	users	could only	initially	call	for	help.	After	a	few	minutes	cell	phone	voice	calls were	either	too	congested	or	blocked	for	use	by	emergency personnel.	However,	text	messaging	still	worked,	even	though	there were	some	delays. Data	travels	on	a	different	network	than	voice	calls	and	because of	its	nature,	can	be	retransmitted	by	the	network	until	it	finally reaches	your	phone.	So,	even	in	the	event	of	a	brief	data interruption,	the	network	will	continually	try	to	send	your	text messages	until	they	reach	your	cell	phone. This	makes	it	ideal	for	emergency	notification,	especially	in	the initial	stages	of	an	emergency. If	you	are	trying	to	get	a	message	to	a	group	of	people,	set	up	a group	email	list	on	your	email	service	so	you	can	broadcast	instructions. Yes,	I	realize	that	your	internet	service	might	be	down	but	you	could even	set	this	up	on	your	email	service	right	on	your	cell.	Also	realize	that nearly	ALL	cell	phones	now	have	a	way	to	receive	a	text	message	unless they	are	over	10	years	old.	Yep,	a	lot	of	people	think	they	don’t	have	that service,	but	they	do.	There	are	limitations	on	some	of	the	cell	phones	in getting	messages	of	course.	Some	are	limited	to	about	100	characters	so if	you’re	sending	a	broadcast,	you’ll	want	it	to	be	short	and	precise. Anyway,	you	can	build	all	sorts	of	scenarios	as	well	as	your	own color	alert	system	to	help	get	the	message	out	in	a	short	number	of characters. 	Personal	Note In	2015	I	decided	to	buy	a	handful	of	these	cheap	prepaid	phones, only	I	swore	to	myself	I’d	keep	them	activated	in	case	something	Really Bad	happened	 which	later	did 	and	I	needed	something	other	than	my usual	cell	phone.	I	found	that	if	you	add	twenty	bucks	or	so	to	them	every few	months,	they’ll	stay	active	and	give	you	a	nice	stack	of	‘emergency’   minutes	as	long	as	you	don’t	go	hog	wild	with	talk	time.	I	keep	one	in every	vehicle	as	well	as	a	charger	in	case	I’m	on	a	trip	without	my	cell. For	strict	anonymity	though	this	comes	up	a	bit	inadequate.	But	it	will give	you	a	line	of	communication	with	the	wife,	kids	or	other	family members	who	you	may	need	to	call	in	dire	situations. Each	of	these	phones	is	connected	to	a	different	carrier’s	network, like	Sprint	and	Verizon,	in	case	one	of	them	goes	down	in	an Armageddon-like	scenario.	As	stated	before,	these	prepaid	phones	have amazingly	more	battery-charge	 and	can	withstand	drops spills 	than your	average	smartphone. 	Craigslist The	value	of	Craigslist	is	heavily	dependent	on	your	region,	but some	very	nice	phones	can	be	acquired	using	it. One	thing	though.	Always	always	carry	a	burner	when	you	deal	with anyone	on	Craigslist	and	especially	when	buying	expensive	items	like gaming	laptops,	cars	or	rare	firearms. Come	armed	if	you	can.	Let	a	friend	know	where	you’re	going.	Not that	you’re	doing	anything	shady,	but	you’ve	no	idea	if	you’re	meeting the	next	Evil	Dead	fan	who	wants	to	pick	up	where	the	cabin	demons	left off.	The	level	of	evil	out	there	is	escalating.	You	want	to	leave	as	few digital	breadcrumbs	as	possible.	Never	let	strangers	know	you’ve	got	a nice	gun	filled	basement	with	a	safe	full	of	cash	and	i355	phones. National	Guard	Sergeant	Jim	Vester	from	Indianapolis	was	killed while	trying	to	complete	a	Craigslist	transaction	for	an	iPad.	It	was	a setup	from	the	start	over	what	amounted	to	$400.	Such	a	tragedy	may have	been	averted	if	he’d	arranged	to	meet	in	a	public	place	for	the transaction.	Sadly,	he	did	not.	RIP. If	you	must	use	this	service	however,	when	posting	the	ad,	do	not allow	email	contact.	Just	put	your	contact	info	in	the	ad	body	itself.	i.e.	the phone	number	and	specify	calls	only.	This	eliminates	scams	and	weeds out	the	not	so	serious	buyers	as	well	as	stupid	“Is	the	BBQ	pit	in	the background	for	sale?”	and	“what	lowest	price	take	for?”	emails. 	Scams And	beware	of	the	Paypal eBay Craigslist	scam.	It	goes	like	this.   They	send	you	a	fake	email	that	looks	like	a	PayPal	email	would.	You then	click	the	link	in	said	email,	which	then	directs	you	to	a	website	that looks	 exactly	like	PayPal,	only	it	isn’t	actually	PayPal.	You	enter	your username password	in	said	website	and	viola,	they	now	have	your	login info.This	scam	has	been	around	for	years.	A	safer	bet	is	to	stick	with thrift	stores	and	yard	sales.	Burners	are	one	thing	but	for	selling weapons	and	related	stuff,	you’re	probably	better	off	using	Armslist.com. There’s	another	scam,	too.	Avoid	any	craigslist	buyer seller	of	costly items	that	cannot	meet	you	face	to	face.	I’ve	met	dozens	of	scammers buying	and	selling	fast	cars	and	other	expensive	items.	Only	deal	with locals	who	have	cash	in	their	hands,	ready	to	buy.	In	God	we	trust,	all others	pay	cash.   Questions	and	Answers Where	to	get	the	best	burner	phones? 	If	you	need	traceless	burners,	anywhere	you	don’t	usually	shop	that doesn’t	have	cameras	is	probably	a	good	idea.	That	means	not	in	your hometown.	Forget	Amazon	and	eBay. Burners	are	cheap	with	a	few	being	only	ten	dollars	or	so,	but	if you’re	the	truly	paranoid	type	you	can	buy	one	from	a	different	mom	and pop	store	every	time	you	need	one,	use	it	once	for	whatever	security operation	you	need,	then	wipe	the	device	and	disperse	the	pieces	in multiple	locations. Flea	Markets	are	a	good	secondary	source	for	burners.	I’ve	bought	a few	and	they’re	‘just	as	good’	as	the	Big	Box	store	kind	with	the	only caution	being	you	need	to	ensure	it	isn’t	tracking	you	from	the	outset. You’ll	need	new	a	SIM	card	as	well.	Failing	that,	there’s	also	a	few	sources on	the	Deep	Web,	aka	the	Darknet,	using	Tor	and	Bitcoins	to	purchase one.If	I	can’t	store	it	at	my	house	or	my	office	then	where	am	I	supposed to	keep	it?	A	safety	deposit	box? No.	In	fact,	never	store	it	at	a	bank	at	all	or	any	place	secured	with your	ID.	Store	it	at	a	friend’s	house	instead.	Oh	but	he	doesn’t	want	it there	either	because	if	he’s	your	friend	he	probably	knows	all	about	your top	secret	operation	and	doesn’t	want	the	liability.	Do	you	have	a	secure HQ	set	up?	Somewhere	private	and	away	from	cell	towers	where members	meet?	One	possibility	is	storing	it	at	an	abandoned	site, possibly	in	a	rural	setting. 	What	about	batteries? Batteries	are	a	problem	but	not	if	you	don’t	activate	the	phone prematurely.	One	solution	is	to	keep	them	somewhere	safe	until	the	day you	need	it.	Store	in	a	PVC	tube	and	hide	in	a	tree	with	tree	bark	super- glued	to	it.	If	you	live	near	a	lake	you’ll	see	many	places	where	one	could   be	stored	under	a	pier	in	a	waterproof	bag.	Of	course,	you	don’t	want	to store	everyone’s	batteries	or	phones	there. Good	opsec	is	hard	work.   Faraday	Cages A	faraday	bag	or	‘cage’	is	a	storage	place	where	radio	waves	are forbidden	and	by	extension	data,	since	data	uses	radio	waves	to	relay messages.	A	nice	place	to	hide	a	phone,	though	I	can’t	think	of	even	one home	appliance	that	lends	itself	to	simple	modification	for	an	effective Faraday	cage.	Microwave	ovens	make	for	one	unreliable	cage,	believe me.	Just	put	a	burner	inside	and	try	calling	it	to	see	for	yourself. The	holes	are	the	problem.	They’re	tiny	enough	to	prevent	the wavelengths	that	the	microwave	uses	from	passing	through.	Shorter wavelengths	though	 ones	with	more	energy 	 will	pass	through.	My twelve-year-old	nephew	once	came	over	and	asked	what	I	was	doing.	I told	him	flat	out	then	looked	at	him.	This	blank	expression	came	along his	face. I	hadn’t	seen	him	in	a	good	long	while	so	I	showed	him	the	same phone	I	saved	from	1983,	the	same	year	Return	of	the	Jedi	came	out.	His eyes	lit	up. ”Wow,’	he	says.	“I	bet	it’s	got	all	kinds	of	illegal	parts,”	only	then	he grabs	it	and	starts	mashing	the	holes	like	they	were	smartphone	buttons. He’d	never	seen	one	that	required	‘dialing‘. Moving	on. You’ll	have	to	buy	a	radio	frequency	shielding	bag	that	blocks	every signal	to	and	from	the	cell	phone,	or	go	to	PrivacyCase.com	and	get	one from	the	pros.	They’re	asking	more	than	everyone	else,	but	their	product works	quite	well.	They	had	it	lab	tested	and	the	thing	doesn’t	leak, period.	No	cellular,	no	wi-fi,	no	GPS,	nothing. Another	option	is	if	you	own	a	gun	cabinet	made	of	metal.	Line	the inside	with	a	1 4’	wire	mesh	and	tin	foil.	Secure	the	tinfoil	with	foil	duct tape.	Now	you	can	store	your	emergency	electronics burners	with	your weapons,	though	admittedly	this	is	time-consuming.	There’s	something else	you	outta	know,	too. That	cell	you’re	carrying	is	constantly	being	tracked	by	this	cell tower	or	that	tower	even	when	you	turn	the	GPS	function	off.	Whenever   your	phone	breaks	contact	with	these	towers,	it’ll	increase	power	to	the transmitter	to	reestablish	a	connection.	Power	consumption	goes	UP	and drains	the	battery. Then	there’s	the	digital	footprint	of	your	cell	going	off	the	grid	and then	popping	up	somewhere	else.	Maybe	even	data	related	to	 why	it went	down.	Certainly	where	it	went	down. Then	Barney	the	bored	TSA	guy	wants	to	know	what	the	deal	is.	He’s in	the	airport	and	thinks	he’s	Michael	Weston	before	he	got	‘burned’	by the	CIA.	He’ll	say,	“Well	lookie	here,	some	taffer	tryin’	to	get	all	stealthy. We’ll	teach	‘em	to	mess	with	us!”	Then	you’ve	got	problems. 	What	about	hiding	phones	in	a	fridge? Edward	Snowden	suggested	using	a	fridge	as	a	kind	of	faraday	cage. True,	a	few	may	block	sound,	but	that	has	no	bearing	on	a	radio’s frequency.	In	some	models	the	seal-gap	can	even	act	as	a	rudimentary antenna!	Microwave	ovens	aren’t	the	solution	either	since	the	door	seal blocks	RF	only	at	2.4	ghz	-	which	is	not	a	cell	band. It’s	hard	work	and	hard	to	maintain.	If	you	slip	up	with	any	of	the above,	you	best	consider	your	opsec	broken.	Once	broken	it	 cannot	 be unbroken.	It	cannot	be	repaired	since	you	don’t	know	how	many	now know	your	identity.	All	numbers,	accents,	purchases,	addresses	and	trails are	now	linked	to	you	and	you	cannot	unlink	them. It’s	why	CIA	agents	work	so	hard	at	keeping	a	low	profile.	They	offer verifiable	 false 	data	that	deceives	outsiders	into	thinking	something exists	when	it	really	doesn’t.	Unfortunately	many	of	them	lose	friends and	family	over	it,	so	they	end	up	in	a	‘bubble’	that’s	very	hard	to	break out	of.	It’s	like	that	Eagles	song:	“You	can	check	in	but	you	can	never leave.”Earlier	I	mentioned	that	your	greatest	weakness	is	yourself.	There’s another	side	to	that	coin	and	it’s	this:	the	NSA’s	greatest	weakness	is itself.	They	tend	to	rely	on	signal	intelligence	for	everything	at	the expense	of	everything	else.	They	rely	too	much	on	technology	with	not enough	eyes	on	the	ground.	This	is	in	your	favor	because	they	can	only see	what	you	give	them,	like	using	your	burner	to	call	your	girlfriend after	all	mission	burners	have	been	activated. It’s	an	elaborate	chess	match	of	move,	countermove,	attack,	but	if   you	prevent	them	from	getting	near	your	queen,	they	cannot	say checkmate. Let	me	repeat	it.	Good	opsec	is	hard	work!   20	Ghost	Apps	for	Smartphones Call	me	paranoid,	but	I’ve	never	trusted	Android	to	completely remove	 everything	an	app	may	leave	inside	my	phone.	The	uninstall process	seems	a	little	‘off’	to	me,	as	though	something	rotten	has	been left	to	fester	underneath	and	the	OS	just	doesn’t	care	if	I	know	about	it	or not.	Windows	is	a	 little	better,	but	with	Android	there’s	always	some cryptic	legalese	about	painless	network	access	and	maybe	what	it intends	to	modify,	only	it’s	in	a	kind	of	gnarled	and	twisted	doublespeak that	even	I	can’t	untangle.	Or	maybe	I	just	suck	at	deciphering	legalese.	I suck	at	deciphering	Egyptian	hieroglyphics	too,	but	then	Tutankhamen isn’t	spying	on	my	internet	habits. Nevertheless,	a	research	paper	came	out	last	year	that	shed	a	lot	of light	on	the	subject	of	just	what	goes	on	under	Android’s	hood.	They called	it	Taming	the	Android	AppStore:	Lightweight	Characterization	of Android	Apps. Here’s	what	they	did. They	tested	over	2000	of	the	Play	Store’s	free	apps	in	every	category using	a	Samsung-Galaxy	S3	phone	with	Android	4.1.	They	accomplished this	using	a	VPN	which	dumped	IP	addresses	and	other	data	using TCPdump	-	which	monitored	every	app	on	the	phone.	The	result	wasn’t pretty.They	 that	 many	 Android	 apps	 connected	  without permission 	to	at	least	one	of	five	hundred	unique	websites	without leaving	a	trail.	That’s	right.	No	popups.	No	emails.	No	opt-out.	It connected	to	all	sorts	of	things	that	kill	anonymity	outright	to	say nothing	about	general	privacy. Ad	trackers.	Behavior	analytics.	Click	trackers.	Tracking	servers.	The whole	anti-privacy	enchilada	with	Google	sitting	fat	and	happy	at	the	top of	the	heap	with	that	crooked	Joker’s	grin.	So	why	did	they	not	engage	in a	little	transparency? My	theory	is	that	it	isn’t	that	they	don’t	have	this	ability	from	a technical	standpoint.	They	do	indeed.	It’s	that	they	need	to	grant	the  found	   application	developer	access	to	your	private	data	on	a	consistent	day-to- day	basis. Speaking	of	private	data,	I’ve	found	most	privacy	advocates	to	care less	about	staying	‘hidden’	from	the	NSA	and	more	about	hiding	from corporate	entities.	Bragging	about	that	hot	new	IP	over	an	open	mic network	like	Skype	is,	to	put	it	mildly,	crazy	business. When	you	get	to	the	point	in	your	career	when	you’re	discussing business	startups,	the	first	line	of	defense	should	always,	without exception,	be	privacy	focused.	That’s	because	Microsoft,	Apple,	Google and	the	like	care	zero	about	protecting	you.	You	are	considered	by	them to	be	their	product.	Their	bottom	line.	That	includes	every	bit	of	hearsay, gossip,	or	stock	details	that	zip	around	on	Skype	which,	if	you	sign	on	the dotted	line	in	their	Terms	of	Service	agreement,	is	fair	game. In	the	end,	it	isn’t	patents,	copyrights,	and	lawsuits	that	shield	your ideas	and	ventures	and	marketable	products.	It’s	trade	secrets	-	and	that requires	you	to	kick	their	corporate	noses	out	of	your	tent.	And	your business. So	what	follows	is	the	absolute	end-all-be-all	of	must	have	addon apps	that’ll	turn	your	gremlin-built	Android	phone	into	a	veritable fortress	of	doom,	from	which	nothing	gets	in	or	out	without	your	express permission.	Sort	of	like	DungeonKeeper	for	mobile	phones,	except	you call	the	shots.   Signal  First	up	is	Signal,	the	popular	messenger	and	private	calling	app	on the	Google	Play	Store	designed	by	Whisper	Systems.	It’s	the	combining	of two	very	secure	encryption	apps	called	TextSecure	and	RedPhone,	both built	by	the	same.	Both	apps	began	on	iPhone	and	now	have	been brought	over	to	Android.	Several	bonuses	right	off	the	bat	jumped	out	at me. The	code	is	open	source,	reviewable	by	experts.	That’s	a	big one.No	ads	to	speak	of. Anyone	can	use	this	to	communicate	instantly	and	privately.     Orweb  Orweb	is	a	web	browser	created	with	your	privacy	in	mind.	It’s newbie-friendly	and,	when	coupled	with	Orbot,	can	shield	you	from network	analysis,	supercookies	and	all	without	running	Flash,	the	same Flash	that	can	introduce	exploits	into	your	Android	system. It	does	this	by	routing	your	traffic	through	international	computers remotely	rather	than	going	directly	into	a	VPN	or	other	proxy	service.	It’s slower	this	way,	but	ensures	a	level	of	security	above	that	of	the	average user.The	problem	is	that	it’s	now	outdated.	Obsolete.	As	of	now	it	has been	upgraded	to	Orfox	status.	As	for	the	old	version	 i.e.	Orweb ,	the developers	had	this	to	say:	“Orweb	is	built	upon	the	bundled	WebView  Webkit 	browser	component	inside	of	the	Android	operating	system. This	has	proven	to	be	problematic	because	we	cannot	control	the	version of	that	component,	and	cannot	upgrade	it	directly	when	bugs	are	found. In	addition,	Google	has	made	it	very	difficult	to	effectively	control	the network	proxy	settings	of	all	aspects	of	this	component,	making	it difficult	to	guarantee	that	traffic	will	not	leak	on	all	devices	and	OS versions.”   Orfox  Orfox:	Tor	Browser	for	Android 	Designed	with	source	code	from	Tor	Browser,	a	few	enhancements have	been	added	to	make	it	a	rock-solid	browser	for	Android.	With NoScript,	HTTPS	Everywhere	and	Tor	Browser	Button	added	in,	it’s	a rock-solid	tool	for	anonymous	browsing. 	   Differences	to	note: 1. 	Other	than	the	fact	Orweb	is	outdated,	Orfox	is	vastly	superior	to Orweb	as	Orweb	focuses	on	minimal	browser-fingerprinting	and	cookies   with	fewer	writes	to	disk. 	2. 	Orweb	takes	up	less	than	2MB.	Orfox	comes	in	at	27MB.	This	is mainly	due	to	Orfox	becoming	a	more	robust	browser	with	a	longer feature	set. 	From	the	Developer:	“Orfox	is	built	from	the	same	source	code	as Tor	Browser	 which	is	built	upon	Firefox ,	but	with	a	few	minor modifications	 to	 the	 privacy	 enhancing	 features	 to	 make	 them compatible	with	Firefox	for	Android	and	the	Android	operating	system.” Orfox	REQUIRES	Orbot	app	for	Android	to	connect	to	the	Tor network. In	as	many	ways	as	possible,	we	adhere	to	the	design	goals	of	Tor Browser,	by	supporting	as	much	of	their	actual	code	as	possible,	and extending	their	work	into	the	additional	Android	components	of	Firefox for	Android. The	Tor	software	protects	you	by	bouncing	your	communications around	a	distributed	network	of	relays	run	by	volunteers	all	around	the world:	it	prevents	somebody	watching	your	Internet	connection	from learning	what	sites	you	visit,	it	prevents	the	sites	you	visit	from	learning your	physical	location,	and	it	lets	you	access	sites	which	are	blocked.”   Telegram  Telegram 	Telegram	is	a	message	app	that	focuses	on	security.	It’s	fast,	simple and	ad-free.	A	few	of	the	benefits	they	offer	are: -	Cloud	Storage:	Telegram	syncs	across	all	your	devices	so	you	can always	access	your	data.	Your	message	history	is	also	stored	in	the Telegram	cloud. -	Group	Chat	&	Sharing:	you	can	form	large	group	chats	of	up	to 1000	members	if	you	need	to. -	Secret	Chats:	These	are	messages	that,	according	to	Telegram,	can be	programmed	to	self-destruct	automatically	from	both	participating devices.	This	way	you	can	send	all	types	of	disappearing	content: messages,	photos,	videos	and	files.	Secret	Chats	also	use	end-to-end encryption	to	ensure	that	a	message	can	only	be	read	by	its	intended recipient. 	   	   	So	how	secure	is	it?	That	largely	depends	on	your	security	needs.	If you	require	rock-solid	security	like	the	kind	political	dissidents	in	China   use,	then	no.	There’s	lots	of	questions	floating	around	on	the	lack	of	peer review	as	well.	But	if	you	only	want	to	keep	Google	 or	the	spouse 	out	of your	affairs,	then	yes. Using	an	app	that	has	end-to-end	encryption	is	better	than	non	end- to-end	and	that	uses	closed	source	 i.e.	Whatsapp ,	with	no	way	to	peer review	it.	Telegram	also	does	not	store	your	secret	chats,	and	the	data stays	encrypted	until	it	arrives	at	the	receiver’s	phone. However,	it	uses	non-standard	crypto.	Though	there	are	those	in	the security	community	who	become	nervous	whenever	a	developer	does this,	the	bottom	line	is	that	you	and	you	alone	must	determine	if	this	app fills	your	anonymity	needs,	or	whether	you	need	some	other	app	like CryptoCat.   Chat	Secure  ChatSecure	is	an	open-source	chat	client	that	supports	encryption over	XMPP.	Previously	known	as	‘Gibberbot’,	it’s	progressed	to	be	a	fairly reliable	chat	app	for	privacy.	The	downside	is	that	it	cannot	stay connected	or	in	an	‘always-on’	state	since	Apple	forbids	it.	The	upside	is that	it’s	free	and	works	on	every	platform:	Android,	iPhone,	Mac	with Adium,	Linux	with	Jitsi,	and	Windows	with	Pidgin. 	   	  Features: -	Every	message	you	send	with	ChatSecure	is	private	so	long	as	your recipient	uses	an	OTR-compatible	IM	client	-	Delivers	audio,	photos,	files and	text. -	Messages	sent	aren’t	stored	in	your	phone’s	memory. -	If	used	with	Orbot,	it	can	bypass	many	firewalls	and	blacklists. -	Supports	multiple	accounts   Encrypted	E-mail K-9	and	OpenKeychain:	Encrypted	E-mail 	K-9	Mail	is	built	upon	Android’s	native	email	application,	but	is for	 you	 It’s	 main	 advantage	 open-source.	 is	 simplifying	 email management.	If	you’ve	got	multiple	accounts	and	need	encryption,	K-9	is your	baby	since	it	uses	OpenPGP	via	OpenKeychain	for	encrypting messages. OpenKeychain	EASYPGP	integrates	with	K-9	and	strengthens anonymous	communications.	The	encryption	it	uses	ensures	that	any communication	can	only	be	read	by	those	with	the	proper	key.	When your	recipient	opens	your	message,	they	can	see	it	is	digitally	signed	by you	 or	not .	In	fact	that’s	the	whole	point	of	PGP,	also	known	as	Pretty Good	Privacy.	For	your	eyes	only.	That’s	to	ensure	you’re	speaking	with the	right	person. 	You	can	also	search	for	other	people’s	keys	online.	Just	remember that	PGP	is	useful	for	two	things: 1.	Privacy	and	Security,	and	2.	Authenticity. By	privacy,	I	mean	that	you	can	prevent	people	from	seeing	things you	don’t	want	them	to	see.	For	example,	you	can	encrypt	an	email	to someone	or	encrypt	a	file	with	a	list	of	passwords. By	authenticity,	I	mean	that	you	can	ensure	a	message	was sent written	by	the	person	you	think	it	was	and	that	it	wasn’t	modified by	a	third	party.	Of	course,	these	two	can	be	combined. 	I	like	to	remember	the	opening	scene	from	Wargames,	where	two missile	silo	operators	have	to	turn	their	key	simultaneously	before inputting	the	nuclear	launch	codes. 	 Don’t	worry	about	reverting	to	your	old	email	should	K-9	not	be	to  Points	to	Note:   your	liking.	This	is	easily	done	by	uninstalling	or	going	to	Settings	—> Applications	—>	Manage	Apps	—>	and	choosing	your	app	before clicking	on	“clear	defaults”.	This	resets	the	default	app	for	that	function. It’s	sort	of	like	installing	a	new	browser.	Chrome	over	Firefox,	for instance.	If	you	uninstall	Chrome,	Firefox	will	still	be	there	for	you. The	other	thing	is	that	if	you	want	to	export	the	K-9	settings somewhere,	you	will	need	to	reboot	your	phone,	after	which	the com.fsck.k9	directory	should	be	accessible	at	the	topmost	level	of	the Android	system.   KeySync:	Syncing	Trusted	Identities  KeySync	allows	you	to	sync	identities	between	OpenPGP	and ChatSecure	as	well	as	GnuPG.	The	app	needs	to	do	this	for	purposes	of establishing	trust	between	different	apps	on	your	Android	device.	Trust certificates,	say,	for	Pidgin	and	Adium,	need	to	be	converted	to ChatSecure	so	that	there’s	no	conflicting	identities.	It’s	sort	of	like	having the	same	name	and	identity	that	matches	all	your	credit	cards.	You	can use	Discover	and	MasterCard	at	the	same	place	because	of	the	identity match.	Same	concept	here. 	Syncing	to	ChatSecure Now	then.	Let’s	say	you	wanted	to	sync	between	ChatSecure	on	your phone	and	maybe	an	app	on	your	PC	or	laptop.	Here’s	what	you’d	have	to do:	-	Ensure	your	phone	is	connected	via	USB. -	Powerup	KeySync	and	let	it	detect	your	system. -	If	it	fails	to	find	it,	it	will	store	the	 otr_keystore.ofcaes	to	your phone’s	SD	card.	From	there,	ChatSecure	can	locate	it. Within	ChatSecure	you	can	go	to	your	Account	screen	&	choose “Activate	KeySync.”	Then	you	use	the	QRCode	that	you	can	see	in KeySync	 to	 complete	 this	 process.	 And	 that	 code	 acts	 as	 the key passphrase	to	your	keystore,	so	don’t	lose	it	or	email	it	to	anyone.	It all	sounds	very	convoluted,	but	you’ll	see	it	isn’t	once	you	go	through	it.   LastPass	Password	Manager  LastPass	Password	Manager 	I	absolutely	love	what	I	can	do	with	LastPass.	What	does	it	do?	Well you	can	use	LastPass	to	store	logins,	create	complex	passwords	and	keep track	of	any	team	members	passwords	you	have	to	keep	under	lock	and key.	You	only	need	to	remember	one	password	however:	 your LastPassword. It	fills	in	logins	for	you	and	syncs	passwords	&	passphrases anywhere	you	need	it.	That’s	not	all.	Some	other	neat	things	you	can	do  though	admittedly	a	few	break	your	anonymity! ,	are:	*	Save	and	autofill usernames passwords	for	all	online	accounts *	Streamline	online	shopping	with	Form	Fill	profiles	 danger	Will Robinson! 	*	Store	memberships,	credit	cards,	&	sensitive	data	in	Secure Notes	 Risky! 	*	Search	for	logins	and	notes	from	your	vault	 useful  *	Organize	sites	by	folders	 very	useful  *	Enable	multifactor	authentication	to	lock	down	your	LastPass account. *	Share	logins	with	friends family	 This	is	an	absolute	no-no	unless you	want	to	kill	your	anonymity	outright. 	*	Audit	the	strength	of	your passwords	with	the	LastPass	Security	Challenge 	In	light	of	the	above	you	may	think	what’s	the	point	since	several features	use	services	that	are	known	to	be	hostile	to	privacy.	Well,	you   don’t	need	to	use	LastPass	then.	Many	don’t	for	the	simple	reason	it	is web-based.	Try	a	Keypass	database	instead	for	offline	activity,	or	sync with	Dropbox. Actually	come	to	think	of	it,	that’s	risky	too	since	if	you’re unencrypted	laptop	or	PC	gets	stolen,	then	you	must	consider	 all passwords	compromised. But	let’s	compare	an	offline	password	manager	like	Password	Safe with	an	online	manager	like	LastPass	for	a	moment.	Weight	the	risks,	so to	speak.Believe	it	or	not,	offline	password	managers	carry	risk	just	like online	managers.	Some	believe	that	the	password	‘safe’	file	acts	as	the mother	of	all	risks	since	it’s	the	bottom	ace	card	in	a	house	of	cards.	But that’s	true	for	your	PC	too	since	all	it	takes	is	one	keylogger	to compromise	your	system. Without	any	manager	at	all	a	keylogger	can	record	every	pass	you use.	With	a	manager	app,	you	can	conceivably	lose	ALL	of	your passwords	in	one	fell	stroke.	For	this	reason	I	suggest	you	pick	one	or	the other.	They	both	harbor	strengths	and	weaknesses	with	one	strength being	that	you	can	use	your	passwords	on	anyone’s	computer.	That’s pretty	convenient	under	almost	any	scenario. Alas,	there’s	always	a	hacker	lurking	around,	and	make	no	mistake that	an	online	database	can	be	breached	by	him	and	him	alone.	In	that case,	everyone	goes	down.	Tens	of	thousands	of	users	just	like	you.	In this	there	is	the	safety	in	numbers	element	unless	the	hacker	in	question decides	to	sell	every	bit	of	data	to	the	highest	bidder.	The	silver	lining	is that	you’ll	know	about	such	a	breach	almost	immediately	from	your online	provider	 assuming	the	company	doesn’t	want	a	class-action lawsuit.      Linphone:	Encrypted	Video	and Voice	Over	IP	 VOIP   client,	  Linphone	 short	for	Linux	phone 	is	a	free	voice	over	IP,	or	VoIP service,	 and	 SIP	 currently	 developed	 by	 Belledonne Communications	in	France.	It’s	now	available	for	AppleiOS	and	Android as	well	as	PCs,	with	the	biggest	advantage	being	it	isn’t	limited	to	voice and	video.	You	can	send	texts,	chat,	make	multiple	calls	and	even	call	up your	friends	for	an	audio	conference. 	Three	major	new	capabilities	have	been	added:	a	text	messaging feature	 chat 	with	delivery	status	notification,	multiple	calls	and	audio conferencing.	In	addition,	Linphone	supports	audio	with	speex	,	G711 ,ILBC,	GSM,	SILK,	G722,	OPUS,	and	video	with	the	VP8	codec. 	If	you	want	to	talk	to	your	partners	using	Tor	then	you’ll	need	to	use Onioncat	at	both	ends	since	Linphone	uses	UDP.	Instructions	on	using Linphone	for	anonymous	VoIP	over	Tor	can	be	found	here,	at	the	Whonix site.	Just	remember	that	Tor	adds	considerable	latency	so	it	will	not	be   like	those	crystal	clear	calls	Jason	Bourne	gets	in	a	firefight	in	some	back alley	in	Pakistan.   ObscuraCam:	The	Privacy	Camera Like	Pinta	and	Gimp,	ObscuraCam	allows	you	to	blur	faces	in	any photo	or	video	that	could	lead	to	your	identification.	Use	pixelation	or blackout	or	even	a	funny	nose glasses	combo	to	edit	out	your	identity. The	app	itself	is	designed	by	the	GuardianProject	and	Witness.org,	a human	rights	training	organization. 	  Unfortunately	the	ObscuraCam	app	itself	does	not	encrypt	files	in transit.	For	that	you’ll	have	to	resort	to	some	other	encryption	app	like PGP	or	Veracrypt	and	then	go	through	the	usual	encryption	routine	like so:	-	Install	the	app	-	Create	an	encrypted	container	after	choosing	a container	size	for	encrypting	-	Send	the	file	 along	with	the	password your	recipient	needs	via	PGP .	Simple. What	I	find	lacking	in	many	online	guides	however,	is	the	lack	of metadata	discussion.	So	allow	me	a	short	tangent	on	this	important	topic.   Metadata  Put	simply,	metadata	is	used	by	search	engines,	intelligence agencies	and	even	grocery	store	chains	to	track	you.	Obscuracam removes	this.	Things	like	GPS	coordinates,	time date	of	image,	phone owner’s	name nic,	and	phone	model	aren’t	recorded.	In	my	view	this	is light	years	better	than	being	able	to	blur	faces	on	Facebook	-which	you should	not	be	on	anyway	if	you	want	privacy.	The	Exif	Data	Firefox plugin	also	makes	a	great	companion	tool	as	it	can	delete	metadata	from jpegs.	Now	onto	some	questions. 	What	else	does	metadata	cover? In	theory	the	amount	of	metadata	available	on	a	person	is	near infinite.	But	they	don’t	have	quantum	computers	yet	which	means	the amount	of	data	on	any	one	person	is	limited.	We	aim	to	limit	it	even more	since	even	a	single	file	can	reveal	a	lot	about	you	as	a	person. 	What	kind	of	files	contain	metadata? Any	kind.	Word	docs,	jpegs,	bitmaps,	mp3s.	Everything	and	anything that	carries	a	digital	signature	or	hash	can	tell	them	where	you	live,	what you	listen	to,	who	dumped	you	and	whether	you	squirt	your	ketchup	on your	fries	or	on	the	side	at	the	In	n’	Out	burger. 	I‘m	a	novelist.	I	don’t	care	about	any	of	that. Sorry	to	tell	you	this	but	novelists	have	a	lot	to	worry	about	too, especially	if	they’re	self-publishers.	Actually	traditional	pubbers	too, since	French	writer	Gregory	Delacourt	was	sued	by	Scarlett	Johansson for	‘stealing’	her	image.	But	that’s	another	tale. Novelists,	writers	and	copywriters	have	to	worry	about	privacy	just like	Stephen	King.	The	master	of	horror	storytelling	once	revealed	his biggest	blunder.	He	was	asked	if	there	was	anything	in	his	career	that	he regretted	doing	or	saying,	other	than	writing	Maximum	Overdrive.	He said,	“That	damn	American	Express	commercial	from	the	eighties.	Once   I’d	done	that,	people	all	over	the	world	knew	my	face.”   Orbot:	Proxy	with	Tor  Orbot	encrypts	your	internet	traffic	with	Tor	so	that	it	cannot	be traced.	It	does	this	by	relaying	traffic	through	relays	around	the	world. No	other	tool	does	this	like	Tor,	and	makes	it	a	useful	privacy	tool.	Even the	New	York	Times	praised	it. “When	a	communication	arrives	from	Tor,	you	can	never	know where	or	whom	it’s	from.” 	Okay,	fair	enough.	But	you	must	decide	which	is	the	bigger	risk: Your	cell	provider	or	Google.	I’d	say	both	carry	equal	risk	but,	when	you hand	them	your	identity	on	a	silver	platter,	well,	they	don’t	even	need	a judge	to	take	you	down.	Only	a	thinly-veiled	reproach.	Of	course	some countries	carry	more	risk	than	others	when	you	take	your	threat	model into	account.	Next	question. 	Is	there	a	way	to	hide	the	fact	I’m	using	Tor	 Orbot 	from	my	ISP? Hiding	Tor	usage	from	your	ISP	provider	isn’t	that	hard.	They’ll know	you’re	using	Tor	soon	enough,	just	not	what	you’re	doing	with	it. They	can	also	monitor	you	till	the	cows	come	home	but	have	no	idea what	hidden	services	you’re	accessing	nor	do	they	have	a	clue	which content	you	send	or	receive	from	while	using	Tor.	It	can	be	detected, however,	from	the	Tor	relay	node	via	the	IP	addresses	you	connect	to. To	hide	Tor	usage	itself	from	them	you’ll	need	to	use	a	Tor	bridge,	or pluggable	transport	bridges 	to	prevent	them	from	seeing	you	are	on	the   Tor	network.   Navigation  Osmand:	Offline	Maps	and Osmand	 OSM	Automated	Navigation	Directions 	is	a	navigation	app used	in	conjunction	with	OpenStreetMap	 OSM .	It	makes	a	stellar replacement	for	Google	Maps,	but	it	isn’t	anonymous	unless	you’re offline	the	whole	time.	It	uses	maps	from	OpenStreetMap	and	can	be downloaded	using	Tor. 	   Features: *	Works	online	 fast 	or	offline	 no	roaming	charges	when	you	are abroad 	*	Turn-by-turn	voice	guidance	 recorded	and	synthesized   voices 	*	Optional	lane	guidance,	street	name	display,	and	estimated	time of	arrival	*	Supports	intermediate	points	on	your	itinerary	*	Automatic re-routing	whenever	you	deviate	from	the	route	*	Search	for	places	by address,	by	type	 e.g.:	restaurant,	hotel,	gas	station,	museum ,	or	by geographical	coordinates. One	downside	is	that	while	the	screenshots	on	the	Play	Store	make it	look	simple,	it’s	not.	In	fact	it’s	fairly	complex	and	the	controls	are somewhat	unintuitive.   Ostel:	Encrypted	Phone	Calls Ostel	is	a	product	designed	for	keeping	your	calls	private.	So	private in	fact,	that	it	offers	end-to-end	encryption	at	both	ends.	And	if	you believe	the	United	States	to	be	the	only	one	data	mining	everything	on the	internet,	I’ve	got	a	friendly	rattlesnake	to	sell	you. I’ve	got	some	mixed	feelings	about	Ostel	and	I’m	sure	you	will	to.	To begin	with	you	must	register	for	an	account	at	Ostel.co.	That	was	the	first red	flag.	From	the	dial	pad	I	had	to	key	in	9196	then	click	the	green	icon in	the	corner	before	I	could	speak.	Then	came	the	echo	test	which	I	found similar	to	Skype’s	test.	All	in	all,	its	a	hit	and	miss	scenario,	but	I	concede your	luck	may	be	better	than	mine.	The	pros	are	as	follows:	-	Supports: Android,	iPhone,	Mac,	Win,	Linux	&	Blackberry Nokia	-	Integrates	well with	CSipSimple	app	for	Android	-	Supports	end-to-end	encrypted	using ZRTP	&	SRTP. -	Makes	for	a	great	privacy	tool Cons: Encrypted	phones	sound	intriguing	to	just	about	every	anonymity enthusiast	out	there,	especially	beginners.	The	problem?	Configuring some	of	these	apps	can	be	like	toying	with	a	rattlesnake	itself.	Technical hurdle	is	putting	it	mildly	indeed.	Besides	that,	encrypted	voice	apps	are really	a	hit	and	miss	and	here	are	a	few	reasons	why. Apps	such	as	this	one,	based	on	my	use	of	it,	reveal	a	lot	of	counter- intuitive	design	decisions	that	don’t	mesh	well	with	the	Android interface,	nor	with	what	Android	users	are	accustomed	to.	This	isn’t	a problem	for	a	technically	minded	person	but	beginners	will	have	a	hard time	navigating	around	since	a	lot	of	these	don’t	follow	Android	design specs.Case	in	point:	No	activity	light.	Remember	when	almost	every	PC came	with	one	so	that	you	could	see	the	hard	drive	being	accessed? That’s	absent	far	too	often	these	days.	There’s	a	few	other	red	flags,	one being	the	guessing	game	as	to	when	the	encryption	actually	began	and when	it	ended.   	Confusion.	Ostel	was	as	different	to	Linphone	as	the	sun	is	to	the moon	in	the	directions.	I’m	quite	good	guessing	games	but	even	I	tended to	wander	around	like	I	was	in	a	fog,	patting	my	hands	like	a	blind person.	I	can	imagine	how	confusing	it	would	be	for	someone	new	to encrypted	voice	calls.	In	one	instance	I	ended	up	making	a	call	through my	normal	phone	line	with	the	dial	pad.	There	was	no	indication	this	was taking	place	until	I	ran	some	tests	to	confirm	it.	Strike	one. 	Setting	up	an	account	at	Ostel.co	was	uninspiring,	with	the	SIP provider	not	being	clear	on	just	what	their	definition	of	anonymity	is, which	bothered	me.	Throughout	the	process	I	kept	thinking	that newcomers	will	abandon	ship	when	they	realize	they	cannot	call	Skype anonymously	 you	need	to	call	someone	with	a	SIP	client	to	ensure	the call	is	private .	That	should	be	loud	and	clear	on	the	front	page. 	Cannot	call	landlines	from	Ostel	and	have	it	encrypted.	This	was	a deal	killer	for	me,	but	I’ll	waive	the	strike	since	you	may	not	need	to	call them	at	all. 	Metadata.	The	app	is	bad	at	hiding	it	from	others.	Contacts,	call history	and	such,	seemed	to	be	not	terribly	high	on	the	app’s	priorities, unlike	the	Tor	Browser	Bundle.	I	admit	that	to	compare	Tor	with encrypted	phone	use	is	perhaps	premature	as	it	 is	in	it’s	infancy,	but metadata	is	the	hook,	line	and	sinker	of	the	NSA	and	thus	must	be executed	as	a	priority	one	mission	objective. 	They	log	data.	They	claim	to	log	enough	data	to	run	the	service,	but it	sounds	like	the	same	ploy	I	hear	from	VPN	providers	looking	to	cover their	backsides.	We	know	VPN	companies	are	great	at	offering	privacy but	for	anonymity,	many	come	up	lacking.	Strike	two. 	No	Tor	support.	Also	a	deal	killer,	but	this	may	be	due	to	the prematurity	of	the	service	and	not	related	to	the	company	itself.	Voice over	IP	doesn’t	work	well	with	Tor	anyway	due	to	the	way	Tor	works  torrents	as	well ,	which	means	Orbot	won’t	work	well	with	it.	Strike   three.   TextSecure  TextSecure	 now	Signal 	is	an	open-source	communication	app	that allows	you	to	avoid	SMS	fees	and	share	media	with	colleagues,	friends and	the	like,	privately.	We	list	it	here	if	you’re	a	little	uneasy	about	using Signal.	So	how	secure	is	it? Very	secure,	though	obviously	not	as	secure	as	the	newly	revamped Signal	app.	An	interesting	 though	insanely	technical 	research	paper	is available	online	and	is	called	‘How	Secure	is	TextSecure’.	It’s	put	out	by the	Horst	Institute	for	IT	Security	and	their	conclusion	was	that	three apps	outside	of	Tor	outshine	all	others	for	anonymity:	Threema, Surespot	and	TextSecure.	You	can	draw	your	own	conclusions,	but	I’ve tested	every	app	and	found	TextSecure	to	be	a	great	tool	to	use	for	any operation	that	requires	staying	off	the	grid.   Pixelknot:	Hidden	Messages Pixelknot	allows	you	to	send	a	short	message	within	a	photo	that only	the	recipient	can	read.	The	practice	involves	what	is	known	as ‘steganography’,	or	the	act	of	embedding	a	hidden	message	in	any format.	In	that	vein	it’s	somewhat	similar	to	PGP,	but	uses	the	F5 algorithm	to	obscure	your	message.	The	developers	 i.e.	The	Guardian Project 	issued	this	standard	to	strive	toward: -	Have	the	original	image	appear,	to	the	trained	human	eye, unedited. -	Have	the	bytes	of	the	image	appear,	to	a	trained	analyst, undistorted	so	much	so	as	to	arouse	suspicion. -	Have	the	complete	message	be	recoverable	no	matter	how	it	is transmitted. 	  I‘ve	used	it	for	other	types	of	communication	but	let’s	look	at	one	in particular:	Usenet.	My	favorite	stomping	ground	since	1983. Let’s	assume	for	a	moment	you	want	to	send	an	anonymous   message	to	someone	on	Usenet,	perhaps	in	one	of	the	many	Mp3 newsgroups,	and	let’s	also	assume	you	don’t	want	Google	indexing	that message	for	all	eternity.	 Well	actually,	they	will	anyway . You’d	first	pull	up	the	app,	choose	a	picture	to	hide	the	message	in, and	send	it	using	a	Usenet	posting	app	knowing	that	even	though	the picture	itself	is	quite	visible	to	others,	what	is	encoded	therein	is	not.	In fact,	they	could	not	even	tell	that	it	is	a	picture	manipulated	by	Pixelknot. It’s	true	that	Google	will	index	this	for	eons,	but	until	quantum computing	becomes	widespread,	won’t	be	able	to	decrypt	it. If	on	the	other	hand	you	post	an	encrypted	message	using	PGP,	well, it’s	obvious	you	don’t	want	others	to	see	it	if	you	post	it	in	designated encryption	newsgroups.	The	same	is	true	for	the	popular	encryption containers	like	those	of	Truecrypt	or	Veracrypt.	Any	extension	 unless you	change	it 	often	gives	away	the	app	used	and	by	extension	the	intent of	the	sender.   Own  Your	Security	Needs	Are	Not	My Admittedly,	some	of	these	apps	don’t	quite	cut	the	mustard anymore.	Perhaps	you	tried	a	few	and	for	whatever	reason	they	just didn’t	float	your	boat.	The	apps	mentioned	herein	aren’t	the	only	ones	of course.	They’re	just	the	ones	that	provided	for	my	security	needs.	Yours may	be	different.	Of	course,	I	was	a	little	worried	about	the	authorities mandating	a	‘back	door’	in	a	few	but	then	I	realized	that	using	plain	old run-of-the-mill	SMS	is	almost	always	intercepted	by	local	sheriffs	and municipal	police	to	begin	with.	Everywhere. Between	using	SMS	and	an	open-source	app	by	one	of	the	most respected	security	researchers	in	the	world,	you	probably	know	which one	to	use.	My	skills	aren’t	really	up	to	tracking	the	changelog	on	GitHub just	 trust and	 recompiling	 WhisperSystems	instead. As	a	side	note,	as	soon	as	Microsoft	paid	8.5	billion	for	Skype,	it found	itself	in	a	much	deeper	U.S.	jurisdiction	than	Windows	settled	for. Skype	makes	voice	calls	to	the	PSTN	 i.e.	the	public	switched	telephone network 	and	when	that	happened,	it	fell	under	the	CALEA	Act.	That’s	the Communications	Assistance	for	Law	Enforcement	Act,	an	act	initiated	by the	US	Congress	to	facilitate	wiretapping	of	U.S.	domestic	telephone	and Internet	traffic. Skype	encryption	is	not	end	to	end. And	now	that	Microsoft	lives	smack	dab	in	the	middle	of	every conversation	uttered	over	Skype	in	the	USA	 and	even	abroad ,	they	have a	nice	intercept	point	to	eavesdrop	from	their	servers.	By	contrast, TextSecure	 now	Signal 	does	not	own	a	voice	service.	So	there’s	no intercept	requirements.	If	TextSecure	were	ever	to	resort	back	to	SMS, then	law	enforcement	can	sniff	the	ciphertext.	But	without	the	key,	its pretty	useless.  it	 myself	 for	 Verizon’s	 SMS,	 so	 I’ll	   Ghost	Apps	for	the	Black	Market First	up	is	GRAMS,	the	Darknet	Search	Engine  Grams’s	engine	was	designed	to	be	used	primarily	for	exploring	the Deep	Web.	Announced	on	Reddit	over	a	year	ago,	it	has	made	some	great strides	in	indexing	things	you	cannot	find	on	the	regular	web.	But	like Google	in	1996,	they’re	in	a	very	early	stage	of	indexing	things,	so	it’s	not perfect	and	offers	nowhere	near	the	complexity	that	Google	does. It	does	share	some	of	the	traits	of	Google’s	algorithm	though,	like having	a	scoring	system	based	on	how	long	the	listing	has	been	up,	how many	transactions,	and	how	many	good	reviews	any	one	site	has.	That way	you’ll	see	the	best	listing	first	-	similar	to	what	you’d	see	using Google.The	Grams	Infodesk	can	be	reached	at	the	Onion	site	here: http:  grams7enufi7jmdl.onion infodesk You	will	need	Tor	to	access	this	onion	site. Duck	Duck	Go    DuckDuckGo DuckDuckGo	strives	to	become	the	next	great	internet	search	engine that	protects	user’s	privacy	and	avoids	the	filter	bubble	of	personalized search	results	that	Google	is	so	famous	for. The	results	are	a	compilation	of	about	50	sources	including	Yahoo! Search,	 BOSS,	 Wikipedia,	 Bing	 and	 its	 own	 Web	 crawler,	 the DuckDuckBot,	among	others.	The	best	part	is	that	while	the	regular search	site	is	at	DuckDuckGo.com,	you	can	use	the	Duck	onion	site	to perform	a	clearnet	search,	which	adds	yet	another	layer	of	security	to your	regular	web	usage.	The	link	is	at: http:  3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion  	Note:	Obviously	you	will	need	to	be	connected	to	the	Tor	network for	the	above	onion	link	to	work. 	Pros	to	Using	DuckDuckGo In	March,	2015,	DuckDuckGo	retrieved	more	than	9	million searches	for	the	first	time	since	she	set	sail.	That	month	also	saw	the search	engine	retrieve	more	than	250	million	searches.	Where	there are	great	numbers,	there	is	camouflage.	Plus,	their	competition could	set	new	common	rules	for	privacy	among	web	service providers,	which	would	include	Google. You	can	always	precede	a	search	query	with	g!	to	see	what Google’s	results	would	be.	For	instance: “Mustangs	!g”	->	search	for	Mustangs	on	Google. “Mustangs	!gi”	->	search	for	Mustangs	on	Google	image	“Mustangs !yt”	 ->	 !b”	 “Mustangs	 ->	 Youtube	 Bing	 More	 here: https:  duckduckgo.com bang When	DuckDuckGo	lists	results	that	it	got	from	Yahoo	or	Bing,   your	phone	or	laptop	isn’t	getting	cookies	from	Yahoo	or	Bing. Cons	to	Using	DuckDuckGo DuckDuckGo	labels	itself	as	a	privacy	search	engine,	so	it	won’t be	terribly	helpful	to	use	it	for	things	requiring	location.	A	search	for “air	conditioners	for	sale	in	New	Orleans,	LA”	will	give	you	a craigslist-like	site,	followed	by	a	contractor’s	webpage,	and	a	link	to YellowPages.	The	same	search	on	google	gives	the	names	of	some local	 and	 major-chain	 businesses	 who	 sell	 and	 install	 air conditioners. And	in	case	you’re	wondering	if	‘incognito’	mode	stops	Google’s tracking	that	results	from	your	Google	searches,	the	answer	is	no.	A	loud no	with	arms	waving	no.	Only	a	non-tracking	search	engine	like DuckDuckGo	 that	can	guarantee	your	privacy 	does	that.	Bing	and Yahoo	and	Google	will	still	record	everything	you	do	regardless	of	any incognito	mode,	as	it	affects	the	browser	options	and	not	the	search engine	of	choice. Another	thing	about	our	beloved	Google,	whose	name	keeps	popping up	like	some	handle-bar	mustached	villain	in	a	bad	play.	Google	knows your	preferred	home	temperature	and	your	work	schedule	when	you’re away	at	Six	Flags	and	when	you	go	to	sleep	and	wake	up,	all	thanks	to	the Nest	Learning	Thermostat.	That,	coupled	with	Google	Pictures	 which logs	images	on	your	phone	or	PC 	makes	for	one	very	bright	laser	red	dot on	your	back.	People	love	convenience	over	security,	even	before	Ben Franklin	wrote	his	famous	quote	on	liberty	and	security. Google	Wallet?	Again,	convenience.	They	keep	all	data	related	to every	purchase	you	make,	every	sale,	and	coordinate	it	all	with	every email	message	you	write.	Remember	what	Google	founder	Eric	Schmidt said	some	years	ago? They	now	have	far	more	data	on	you	than	the	NSA	does	and	that data	is	only	a	warrant	away.	Rest	assured	they	will	not	offer	1 10th	the privacy	that	DuckDuckGo	does.  “Google	will	soon	know	more	about	you	than	you	know	yourself!”.   NoteCipher NoteCipher	is	a	simple	notepad	app.	All	notes	created	and	stored	by this	app	are	saved	fully	secured	using	256-bit	AES	encryption.	They	are never	stored	in	an	unencrypted	state	on	the	disk,	only	in	memory.	It	was ported	to	Android	in	2011	by	the	Guardian	Project.    APG  OpenPGP	is	another	good	privacy	app	for	Android.	It’s	open	source and	its	goal	is	to	provide	a	similar	OpenPGP	implementation	as	GnuPG.   	   If	you’re	browsing	Darknet	Markets	you	may	run	across	the occasional	vendor	whose	key	wont	work	with	APG.	But	this	is	rare.	In any	case	you	can	use	GnuPrivacyGuard	to	help.   As	a	side	note,	if	you’re	worried	about	the	app	broadcasting	that you’re	using	Apg	v.1.1.	whatever	 yet	don’t	want	anyone	knowing	you use	APG ,	you	could	always	edit	the	version	before	sending	out	any message.	Example:	Put	Version:	GnuPG	v2	and	anyone	else	would assume	that’s	the	encryption	program	you	are	using.   Bitcoin	Wallet Want	to	have	your	Bitcoins	always	with	you?	Check	out	Bitcoin Wallet.You	pay	by	quickly	scanning	a	QR-code	and	if	you’re	a	merchant, you’ll	receive	payments	reliably	and	instantly.	Bitcoin	Wallet	is	the	first mobile	Bitcoin	app	and	arguably	one	of	the	most	secure. *	No	registration,	web	service	or	cloud	needed.	This	wallet	is	de- centralized. *	Display	of	Bitcoin	amount	in	BTC,	mBTC	and	mBTC. *	Conversion	to	and	from	national	currencies. *	Sending	and	receiving	of	Bitcoin	via	NFC,	QR-codes	or	Bitcoin URLs.*	Address	book	for	regularly	used	Bitcoin	addresses. *	When	you’re	offline,	you	can	still	pay	via	Bluetooth. *	System	notification	for	received	coins. *	Sweeping	of	paper	wallets	 e.g.	those	used	for	cold	storage . *	App	widget	for	Bitcoin	balance. 	   	    ChatSecure  ChatSecure	is	a	free	and	open	source	messaging	app	that	features OTR	encryption	over	XMPP.	You	can	connect	to	your	existing	accounts	on Facebook	or	Google,	create	new	accounts	on	public	XMPP	servers  including	via	Tor ,	or	even	connect	to	your	own	server	for	extra security.Unlike	other	apps	that	keep	you	stuck	in	their	walled	garden, ChatSecure	is	fully	interoperable	with	other	clients	that	support	OTR	and XMPP,	such	as	Adium,	Jitsi,	and	more. 	Strong	Cryptography ChatSecure	only	uses	well-known	open	source	cryptographic libraries	to	keep	your	conversations	private.	Other	apps	may	make claims	about	“military	grade”	security	but,	without	publicly	auditable source	code	and	verifiable	end-to-end	encryption,	you	cannot	be	100% safe.Some	of	what	it	offers:	-	XMPP	with	TLS	certificate	pinning. -	OTR	for	verifiable	end-to-end	encryption	and	forward	secrecy. -	Tor	to	help	bypass	restrictive	firewalls. -	SQLCipher	to	locally	encrypt	conversation	logs. 	Anonymouth Recall	earlier	what	we	said	about	looking	 like	 everyone	 else	when using	Tor.	Enter	Anonymouth. Stylometrics	is	the	study	of	a	person’s	writing	‘style’.	It	analyzes your	writing	and	creates	a	trackable	profile	out	of	it.	In	other	words,	your ‘voice’	in	your	writing	or	the	way	you	phrase	simple	statements,	word length,	word	choice,	misspelled	words	and	so	on.	Where	cell	phone	opsec is	concerned	it	can	be	impossible	to	predict	who	has	this	ability	and where	and	when	and	what	you	can	do	to	blend	in	without	looking	 like you’re	trying	to	blend	in.	It	can	be	a	double-edged	sword	but,	there	are	a few	pearls	I	can	dispense	with	here.   Long	messages	are	just	bad	OPSEC	any	way	you	slice	it.	To	counter this,	Edward	Snowden	used	short	and	punchy	messages	to	throw	off anyone	trying	to	trace	his	NSA	leaks	back	to	him.	This	was	good	since	if one	used	Tor	and	nothing	else	without	care	of	what	was	previously published,	it’d	be	pretty	easy	for	the	NSA	to	link	him	to	previous documents	he’d	written	on	the	open	net. As	for	us,	we	have	the	option	of	using	Anonymouth.	It’s	a	tool	for anonymizing	every	word	we	spit	out	on	the	open	web.	It’s	not	simple	to use	but	like	PGP	it	can	be	a	life	saver	if	you	need	protection	for	any sensitive	data.	How	does	it	work? It	uses	Java	to	analyze	previous	works	with	present-day	works, compares	them	and	then	tips	you	off	to	overused	words,	then	suggests fixes	to	help	you	‘blend	in’.	You	can	even	tell	it	to	scan	a	folder	or	group of	docs	you’d	like	to	‘anonymize‘. For	instance.	Let’s	say	you	are	an	Iranian	political	dissident	using Tor.	You	also	happen	to	be	a	journalist.	Although	your	anonymous	by way	of	IP	address,	the	government	in	Tehran	could	 in	theory 	still analyze	your	anonymous	posts	and	compare	them	to	your	known writings,	say	on	your	public	blog.	Same	with	leaking	emails	from	a corrupt	business.	Maybe	they’ll	compare	what	you	mailed	to	a newspaper	to	all	emails	on	a	corporate	server. There’s	plenty	of	scenarios	where	this	could	be	useful.	It	can	be downloaded	from	the	Github	website	at: github.com psal anonymouth   Ghostery  Ghostery	is	very	popular	at	the	moment.	What	does	it	do?	It	reports all	tracking	packages	detected	 and	whether	Ghostery	has	blocked	them or	not 	in	a	“findings	window”	accessible	from	clicking	on	the	Ghostery Icon	in	the	browser.	When	configured,	Ghostery	also	displays	the	list	of trackers	present	on	the	page	in	a	temporary	purple	overlay	box. With	the	“Ghost	rank”	reporting	feature	enabled,	Ghostery	transmits the	full	HTML	code	of	the	page	visited	to	Ghostery,	Inc.,	and	takes	note key	data	such	as	the	advertising	distribution	systems	that	users encounter	and	the	speed	at	which	these	load	on	the	page. I	recommend	this	app	if	you	need	to	hide	from	Google.	As	for	the NSA	or	Iranian	government?	Not	a	chance.	According	to	a	few	online sources,	they	sell	your	data.	To	whom	or	what	is	anyone’s	guess.	And there	are	claims	of	this	app	being	spyware. But,	you	can	prevent	Ghostery	from	doing	this	by	opting	out	of	the Ghost	Rank	feature.	The	feature	is	opt-in	so	if	you	didn’t	already	opt	in there	is	nothing	you	need	to	do.	If	this	feature	bothers	you,	there’s	a	few others	I	can	recommend.	One	of	which	is	PrivacyBadger.	More	on	that one	in	a	bit.   FlashControl FlashControl	gives	you	control	over	which	sites	are	allowed	to display	the	Flash	player	or	the	HTML5	player.	With	FlashControl installed,	web	content	that	requires	Flash	plugins	will	be	disabled	by default.	You	then	enable	content	by	clicking	on	a	blocked	area	on	any given	webpage,	or	via	Flashcontrol’s	address	bar	icon.	You	can	also reblock	content	that	you’ve	unblocked. This	can	help	reduce	CPU	load	and	provide	some	security	control	so that	content	isn’t	automatically	loaded	without	your	permission.	You	can get	it	at	the	Mozilla	Addons	site. Sidenote:	I	tend	to	walk	among	the	block-all-flash	and	then	click-to- play	guys,	but	I	just	wish	some	of	the	video-streaming	providers	that	use Flash	would	dump	it	and	use	HTML5.	Then	I	could	lead	a	very	Flash-free life.   Privoxy  Privoxy	is	a	 non-caching	web	proxy	with	filtering	capabilities	for enhancing	privacy,	manipulating	cookies	and	modifying	web	page	data and	HTTP	headers	before	the	page	is	rendered	by	the	browser. It’s	a	privacy	 enhancing	proxy.	That	is,	it	filters	Web	pages	and removes	advertisements.	Privoxy	can	be	customized	by	users	for	both stand-alone	systems	and	multi-user	networks	and	can	be	chained	to other	proxies. It’s	frequently	used	in	combination	with	Squid	and	can	be	used	to bypass	 Internet	 censorship.	 Get	 it	 at	 the	 Privoxy	 homepage	 at privoxy.org.   TACO Taco	stands	for	Targeted	Advertising	Cookie	Opt-Out. This	app	auto-blocks	hundreds	of	web	beacons,	bugs,	and	other tracking	technologies	that	advertisers	and	others	use	to	track	you. Sounds	like	Ghostery	to	me.	What	it	amounts	to	setting	permanent	opt- out	cookies	for	Google	and	25	others,	even	if	those	cookies	are	deleted	by Firefox.Now	a	word	from	our	sponsor. You	need	to	understand	something	about	so-called	“opt-out” cookies	and	their	respective	apps,	which	I	think	can	be	a	little misleading.	A	couple	of	thoughts. First,	if	you	read	the	fine	print	of	virtually	every	company’s	privacy policy	regarding	cookie	use,	you’ll	find	that	they	promise	not	to	display targeted	ads	to	you	based	on	your	personal	web	history.	That	is,	you’ll see	ads	that	a	person	would	see	if	they	were	not	being	tracked.	However, many	still	track	you.	When	you	start	digging	around	in	their	lawyer- speak	agreements	you’ll	often	find	that	they	rarely	promise	that	they won’t	track	you	100%,	just	that	they	won’t	show	you	personalized	ads based	on	their	data.	They	still	use	these	opt-out	cookies	to	do	any	of	the following:Track	your	movements,	as	in	what	sites	you	visit. What	you	click	on. What	you	buy	with	credit	cards	or	even	Paypal. 	Secondly,	they	then	use	this	data	for	their	own	marketing	purposes and	may	decide	to	sell	it	to	other	companies.	So	in	terms	of	privacy,	this addon	by	itself	is	inadequate	without	the	aid	of	a	lot	of	the	other	addons we	mention	-	primarily	because	it	gives	people	the	false	idea	that somehow	their	privacy	is	being	protected	by	opt-out	cookies	when	it’s not.   AdBlock	Plus  Adblock	Plus	for	Firefox	is	the	most	downloaded	browser	extension worldwide	and	winner	of	the	About.com	Reader’s	Choice	Award,	as	well as	the	Linux	New	Media	award	for	the	Best	Open	Source	Firefox Extension.	Whenever	I’ve	had	to	re-install	an	OS,	this	is	the	first	addon	I install	after	Firefox. Depending	on	the	filter	lists	you	have	activated,	you	can	even	block YouTube	video	ads	and	Facebook	tracking.	Filter	lists	are	created	by members	of	the	open	source	community	and	free	to	use.	If	you	don’t want	to	rely	on	filter	lists	you	can	create	your	own	blocking	rules	to customize	your	web	experience.	It	all	sounds	like	a	lucid	dream	for	the budding	privacy	advocate. However. AdBlock	introduced	the	Acceptable	Ads	Program	a	few	years	back. That	means	various	companies	can	pay	AdBlock	so	that	their	ads	are added	to	a	long	‘whitelist’,	so	that	you	see	them	in	your	browser.	They’ve actually	been	doing	this	for	a	good	while	now	though	not	many	users know	about	it.   NoScript  NoScript	allows	JavaScript,	Java	and	other	executable	content	to	run only	from	trusted	domains	of	your	choice.	Things	like	your	home- banking	web	site,	guarding	your	“trust	boundaries”	against	cross-site scripting	attacks	 XSS ,	cross-zone	DNS	rebinding	 	CSRF	attacks	 router hacking ,	and	Clickjacking	attempts,	thanks	to	its	ClearClick	technology. That’s	not	a	simple	description,	obviously,	and	for	good	reason	since NoScript	isn’t	a	simple	addon.	It’s	very	complex,	but	like	chess	is	easy	to learn,	hard	to	master. My	biggest	reason	for	using	it	is	that	NoScript	users	are	less vulnerable	to	exploits	than	non-users.	And	it	does	a	lot	more	than	just whitelist	what	sites	can	run	scripts.	It	also	offers	protection	against clickjacking	and	cross-site	scripting	even	if	you	whitelist	sites.	A	few users	even	run	it	while	globally-allowing	scripts	by	default	simply	to	get a	few	other	benefits.	So	it’s	more	than	just	a	privacy	tool.	It’s	an anonymity	tool.	It	comes	bundled	with	the	Tor	Browser	for	good	reason. Another	aspect	I	like	is	that	the	permissions	function	is	very domain-specific.	You	can	allow	google.com	to	run	scripts,	for	instance, but	 deny	 google-analytics.com	 or	 gstatic.com.	 Or	 you	 can	 allow maps.google.com	but	deny	all	other	.google.com	sites.	And	you	can	even  temporarily 	allow	sites	you’d	normally	deny	if	you	need	them	for	a specific	task. 	So	what’s	the	worst	that	could	happen	if	you	retain	No	Script	while allowing	scripts	globally? You’re	more	vulnerable	to	exploits	that	aren’t	being	guarded against,	for	one.	Even	if	you	visit	a	website	you	don’t	trust,	scripts	will still	run.	There’ll	just	be	some	protection	against	dodgy	techniques	that you	wouldn’t	otherwise	have.	And	some	scripts	have	an	easier	time “phoning	home”	and	fingerprinting	you.	Then	there’s	the	badly-coded sites	that	eat	up	your	RAM	and	CPU	cycles. Though	there’s	a	slight	learning	curve	to	NoScript,	it	isn’t	hard	to   figure	out.	You	can	block	most	web	bugs	from	Facebook,	Google	and Twitter	and	the	like.	The	‘like’	button	on	Facebook	is	one	such	web	bug. Every	time	you	visit	a	site	that	has	that	button	 you	need	not	press	it ,	a lot	of	data	goes	back	to	Facebook	about	your	online	habits.	Same	with Twitter’s	‘Tweet’	buttons	and	Google’s	G+	buttons. In	the	beginning,	my	biggest	nitpicks	were: Dealing	with	sites	that	want	to	run	a	gazillion	scripts	from	a huge	number	of	different	domains,	and How	hard	it	was	to	judge	the	trustworthiness	of	third-party domains. Obviously	you	must	judge	each	site	yourself	according	to	your	own opsec	needs,	but	I	solved	the	above	two	issues	this	way	for	general	open net	browsing:	Whenever	you	hit	a	new	website,	enable	enough	of	them to	get	basic	site	functionality.	Usually	this	means	you’ll	allow	the	ones with	the	site	name	in	them	and	work	outward	from	there	to	some	of	the legitimate-sounding	ones.	Enabling	past	this	point	defeats	NoScript’s purpose,	but	you’ll	eventually	get	a	feel	for	what	you	need	to	enable	to get	the	site	working.   uMatrix uMatrix	is	a	point-and-click	matrix-based	firewall.	Just	point	&	click to	forbid	or	allow	any	class	of	requests	made	by	your	browser.	Not	only does	it	block	javascript,	but	also	cookies,	css,	plugins,	images	and	more on	either	a	per	domain	or	global	basis.	The	interface	is	pretty	easy,	too.	It exists	as	a	plugin	for	both	Firefox	and	Chrome. Personally	I	like	to	keep	NoScript	for	the	XSS	protection.	uMatrix will	still	block	javascript	very	well	but	once	you	allow	some	javascript,	it will	step	aside.	NoScript	will	still	scan	allowed	javascript	for	obvious	XSS attempts	and	prevent	it. 	uBlock	Origin uBlock	Origin	is	a	content	filter	by	the	developer	of	uMatrix.	It shares	a	bit	of	the	same	functionality	of	uMatrix	but	is	better	suited	to blocking	ads.	It	can	use	the	same	filter	lists	as	Adblock	Plus.	There’s	two versions:	the	original	by	Raymond	Hill	which	has	been	renamed	from uBlock	to	uBlock	Origin,	and	a	fork	by	Chris	Aljoudi	which	retains	the original	name,	uBlock. You	can	use	all	of	the	above	since	NoScript	and	uMatrix	often	strive for	the	same	goal.	They’re	just	fundamentally	different.	NoScript	only blocks	scripts	but	uMatrix	blocks	whole	connections. From	a	 privacy	perspective,	uMatrix	is	the	way	to	go	because	the connection	never	gets	established. From	a	security	perspective,	NoScript	is	superior.	You	must	decide	if you	want	to	run	each	script.	With	uMatrix	you	can	only	decide	on	a	per connection	basis	and	NoScript	won’t	stop	third	parties	from	connecting. Either	one	presents	their	own	unique	hassles.	But	even	so,	I	recommend installing	Privacy	Badger	and	uBlock. For	more	tools	on	anonymity	 and	a	lot	of	other	useful	information  see	the	following	link	at	the	addon	switchboard: https:  github.com gorhill httpswitchboard wiki   Cell	Keyloggers Keyloggers	are	a	mixed	breed	of	dog,	and	like	any	mixed	breed	I have	some	mixed	feelings	about	them.	They	can	save	your	hide	by defending	you	to	the	death,	or	they	can	get	someone’s	reputation	or	way of	life	destroyed.	So	what’s	a	keylogger? It’s	an	app	that	secretly	records	keystrokes	and	sends	them	by	way of	sleuthy	internet	magic	to	some	evildoer	on	the	other	side	of	the	world. Or	your	dad	could	use	it	to	catch	your	mom	spying	on	him. They	really	have	a	million	uses	and,	right	or	wrong,	it	is	parents	that are	the	only	ones	truly	equipped	to	play	Big	Brother,	and	do	so	ethically. Certainly	they’ve	got	the	know-how	to	reign	in	a	reckless	teen	who’s	too street-smart	for	his	own	good.	Dad	know	the	limits	because	Dad	knows the	kid	inside	and	out.	Not	government.	Not	the	FBI.	And	most	certainly not	the	police. We’ve	seen	what	happens	to	sexting	teenagers	who	pass	around nude	photos	like	baseball	cards.	It	ain’t	pretty. Courts	and	cops	trawl	em,	raid	em	and	jail	em	and	then	claim	to ‘help’	the	kids	by	throwing	them	on	the	sex	offender’s	list	because,	well, that’s	what	they	like	to	do	to	other	people’s	kids.	I	don’t	know	about	you but	I	think	the	parents	can	do	a	much	better	job	than	any	bureaucrat.	So below	are	a	few	I	recommend	if	you’ve	got	a	14	year	old	experimenting with	car	jackings	or	gang	related	activity.	You	know,	serious	crimes. For	other	things	like	weed,	curfew	breaking	and	voyeurism,	I’d	not recommend	any	of	these,	especially	for	older	teens.	Reason	being	is because	they	may	find	out	their	being	spied	on.	Call	it	a	sixth	sense.	Then they’ll	Google	all	kinds	of	ridiculous	things	just	to	toy	with	you.	Search terms	like:Sex	change	operations. How	to	make	a	PB&J	with	the	crusts	cut	off. How	long	would	a	rubber	duck	float	in	the	Gulf	of	Oman. My	cat	wants	me	to	get	an	abortion.   Is	narcissism	genetic? How	do	cows	scratch	their	knees	if	they	itch? Stuff	like	that.	And	if	you’ve	got	a	kid	whose	intelligence	rivals	that of	Neo	in	The	Matrix,	then	you’ve	met	your	match.	He	could	get	a	USB stick,	put	a	live	install	of	Linux	on	it	and	boot	from	the	USB	drive.	Keep the	USB	drive	hidden	when	he	isn’t	using	it. It’s	a	reverse	whammy	unless	you	somehow	take	his	stick,	guess	his password,	figure	out	Ubuntu	and	find	a	way	to	install	a	Linux	keylogger. Even	if	that	happened,	he	can	just	format	it	and	put	a	fresh	copy	of Ubuntu	on	it	again. Anyway	for	the	uninitiated,	here’s	the	first	one.	It’s	called	Spy Bubble.	It	monitors	cell	phone	use	on	any	mobile	device	you	can	think	of. After	you	install	it,	monitoring	begins	instantly.	It’ll	monitor	and record	information	on	the	target	phone	in	complete	stealth,	giving	you complete	access	to	any	sensitive	information	you	could	be	looking	for.	At $50	bucks,	it	ain’t	free.	But	it’s	a	helluva	lot	cheaper	than	hiring	a	lawyer. The	downside	is	that	SpyBubble	can’t	track	stored	videos	or calendar	events.	It	can’t	block	phone	numbers,	websites	or	mobile	apps. It	can’t	set	keyword	alerts	to	send	notice	if	the	phone	is	used	to	access inappropriate	material.	You	also	can’t	use	it	to	see	BlackBerry	Messenger chats	either. Second	up	is	Spyera. 	   Third	is	MobileSpy. 	   Fourth	is	Flexispy 	   Fifth	and	last	is	MobiStealth. 	   All	of	these	keyloggers	basically	do	the	same	thing:	spy	on	your	kids, or	the	competing	used	car	lot	owner	across	the	street. Detecting	Keyloggers Detecting	keyloggers	isn’t	exactly	brain	surgery.	You	just	need	to know	where	to	look.	Sometimes	it’s	difficult,	but	there’s	usually	others online	who’ve	gone	through	the	trouble	of	posting	a	thread	on	a	forum somewhere.	So	help	abounds.	Here’s	a	few	ways	you	can	check	for keylogger	modules	that	may	have	wormed	their	way	 with	a	little	help from	the	Mrs. 	into	your	system. Most	keyloggers	use	a	kind	of	DLL-injection	to	get	under	the	hood and	stay	there	without	you	seeing	it.	That	means	that	a	DLL	will	show	up mapped	to	a	process’s	address	space,	as	seen	below:	The	pyd	 python extension 	file	sits	at	the	top	in	the	second	section	under	‘Name’.	This one’s	been	loaded	right	into	Windows	Explorer’s	address	space,	which means	it’ll	run	every	time	Explorer	is	run.	For	anything	you	need Explorer	to	do.	That	makes	it	hard	to	get	rid	of	without	dedicated	anti- virus	software	that	knows	what	to	look	for. DLLs	like	this	want	to	see	everything	you	type,	so	they	typically	load themselves	into	every	target	address	space	available.	For	a	smart	cookie who	knows	his	PC	like	the	back	of	his	hand,	he’ll	likely	see	odd	DLLs	here and	there	that	look	suspicious	-	files	he	can’t	link	to	any	products	he’s bought	or	uses.	He	can	bring	these	up	in	a	list	for	every	process.	Geeks	do this	enough	every	day	to	where	they	begin	to	see	anomalies,	or	‘ghost files’	that	shouldn’t	be	there.	They	don’t	like	to	rely	on	anti-virus programs	alone. That’s	one	thing	that	kids	are	lousy	at:	noticing	things	like	a	tiny switch	 or	GPS	device 	hooked	under	the	car	ignition.	Spyware companies	depend	on	kids	being	uninformed. Solutions? 1. 	You	can	study	the	‘drivers’	folder	for	any	strange	files. 2. 	Create	a	debug	boot	file	with	BcdEdit	and	hook	up	a	firewire cable	and	hit	a	break	point	when	the	module	loads	and	study	ALL modules,	every	one,	filtering	details	as	you	go	along.	Any	DLL driver can’t	do	squat	about	you	looking	at	it	before	it’s	loaded	into	Windows. This	is,	of	course,	the	complicated	way	of	doing	things. 3. 	Almost	all	keyloggers	phone	home	somewhere	else.	So	connect   to	a	transparent	proxy	and	note	connections	not	familiar	to	you.	You	may see	something	along	the	lines	of	‘myspy.ukraine.com’	rather	than	just your	usual	VPN	address. 4. 	Purchase	an	‘anti-keylogger’	program.	There	as	numerous	as anti-virus	vendors,	but	not	all	equal. Obviously	if	you’re	using	this	spyware	to	monitor	your	kids,	they won’t	have	half	the	brainpower	to	do	any	of	the	above	unless	they’ve	got a	few	whiz	kids	in	their	circle	of	friends.	Better	safe	than	sorry,	I’m	with the	parents	on	this	one.   Tor	and	Cell	Phones Tor	users	generally	fall	into	one	of	two	categories:	The	average	Joe who	can’t	be	bothered	to	expand	his	knowledge	of	security	past	an intermediate	level	is	one	of	them.	He’s	super	confident,	and	generally	he likes	things	easy-peasy.	Press	a	button	and	go.	Many	Mac	users	used	to fall	into	this	category	but	now	many	Windows	users	get	overconfident	in their	own	security	abilities. The	other	group	are	Tor	superhackers	who	can	smell	a	Tor honeypot	from	Hong	Kong	to	Longview,	Texas.	They	know	when	the	cops are	around.	Hounds,	they	are.	They	can	smell	the	red-blue,	red-blue	of	a police	cruiser’s	lights	long	before	they	come	on. While	their	numbers	are	few,	they’re	also	the	restless	types	since they	can’t	sleep	unless	they’ve	plugged	every	security	hole	imaginable and	chained	enough	proxies	to	circle	the	moon.	Even	then	they’re generally	the	most	paranoid	obsessed	micro-managers	this	side	of	a psych	ward.	We	aim	to	be	somewhere	in	the	middle. But	you	should	know	that	even	with	the	anonymous	Tor	browser, anonymity	on	a	cell	phone	is	harder	than	on	a	PC	because	of	how	phones are	now	entwined	with	social	media	applications	and	your	real	identity. This,	along	with	how	Google	loves	to	track	every	move	you	make	 even	if you	whistle	a	copyrighted	tune	out	your	backside ,	makes	smartphone opsec	very	problematic	indeed	for	the	survivalist	and	anonymity enthusiast. But	first,	a	refresher	on	the	basics. Tor	&	IP	Addresses I’ll	repeat	this	a	million	times	if	necessary:	Your	IP	address	is	worth GOLD	to	social	media	giants	like	Facebook	and	YouTube. Think	about	the	long-term	effects	of	monitoring	you	for	years	on end	for	a	moment. Your	browser	alone,	never	mind	all	the	leaks	of	data	your	OS	gives, provides	all	kinds	of	data	on	your	lifestyle	by	way	of	web	analytics. Things	like	where	you	like	to	shop,	what	you	say	and	to	whom	you	say	it   and	how	often.	Which	political	or	religious	forums	you	frequent.	Your pets	names.	Your	hairdresser.	Your	fixer. And	that’s	not	all.	It	links	your	family	history	on	social	media	sites.	It links	your	favorite	book	genres,	your	favorite	sexual	fantasies,	your	eye color.	The	list	goes	on	and	on.	Therefore	it	is	most	crucial	that	we	hide	it as	much	as	possible	as	we	build	out	our	cellular	fortress	of	doom	from which	nothing	can	penetrate.	If	you	don’t	know	what	Tor	is,	I	highly recommend	visiting	the	Tor	website	to	learn	the	dirty	little	details. The	gist	of	this	is	that	any	packet	sent	by	Tor	is	stripped	of	the sender’s	originating	info.	Tor	is	able	to	remove	who	sent	the	packet	and who	the	intended	recipient	is.	Think	of	it	this	way: Imagine	you	sent	an	envelope	to	person	A,	and	in	that	envelope	was an	envelope	to	send	to	person	B. -	Person	A	then	sends	the	letter	to	person	B. -	B	gets	the	envelope	from	A,	and	in	that	envelope	is	 another envelope	to	send	to	person	C. -	Person	C	gets	that	envelope	from	B,	then	looks	up	the	information that	is	requested.	Then	that	person	sends	the	response	in	an	envelope addressed	to	person	B. -	Person	B	puts	that	in	an	envelope	for	A	and	sends	to	A,	which	then puts	it	in	another	envelope	to	send	back	to	you. Tor	routing	works	like	this,	except	you	also	know	the	public	keys	for A,	B,	and	C	ahead	of	time,	so	that	when	you	send	a	message	to	person	A, the	only	thing	that	A	can	decrypt	is	the	fact	you	are	sending	a	message	to B	-	only	the	message	itself	is	still	encrypted	and	only	decryptable	by Person	C.	Meanwhile,	Person	B	receives,	decrypts,	and	relays	the message	to	C	but	never	knows	you	sent	it,	and	C	has	no	idea	who	you	or “A”	really	is.   If	you’re	in	the	United	States,	there’s	some	bad	news	to	hear,	and	it’s this:	Tor	is	generally	safer	for	citizens	that	don’t	live	in	nations	with	lots of	alphabet	agencies	 i.e.	intelligence 	running	Tor	exit	nodes	that	sniff traffic.	If	you’re	in	the	USA	and	run	Tor	-	as	long	as	no	one	is	deploying high	statistical	traffic-analysis	on	you,	your	IP	address	is	generally	safe for	the	session.	Given	enough	resources	and	time funding,	Tor	can	be not-very-safe	if	your	doing	anything	illegal. That	said,	this	leaves	a	lot	to	be	desired	when	we	need	good	opsec. So	many	ways	exist	that	could	out	your	identity.	If	you	open	Hotmail	for instance	while	surfing	with	Tor,	any	alphabet	agency	can,	with	sufficient resources,	correlate	that	address	with	Tor	activity.	Keyloggers	can	too. They	can	record	keystrokes	outside	of	Tor	and	send	them	online	to destinations	unknown.	From	Russia	with	Love.	You	could	even	run	into	a site	that	has	an	XSS	security	hole	and	have	your	identity	stolen	right	out from	under	you.	A	million	things	could	go	wrong. For	this	reason,	we	need	to	set	a	few	ground	rules	for	using	Tor.	It doesn’t	matter	what	you’re	using	it	for.	Americans	have	been	arrested	for sarcastic	comments	left	on	Facebook.	So	anything	done	on	Tor	must never	be	connected	with	any	social	media	outlet.	Ever.   10	Tor	Rules	for	Smartphone	Users The	way	we	go	about	securing	our	phone	with	Tor	is	to	assume everything	you	run	is	compromised.	Plug	all	the	holes	so	to	speak.	And the	basic	guidelines	are	the	same. No	Browser	Customizations	-	That	is,	no	customization	based on	emotional	whims.	The	Tor	Browser	can’t	fix	your	personal imprint	that	drip-feeds	intel	onto	the	net,	which	leads	to	your	front door	in	the	same	way	a	wolf	leaves	dribbles	of	urine	back	to	it’s	lair. Plugins	like	Flash,	QuickTime	and	Firefox	Personas	can	reveal	your IP	address.	Load	up	Firefox	with	a	dozen	social	media	plugins	and you	can	kiss	your	anonymity	goodbye.	This	also	means	no	YouTube. No	Facebook.	No	Twitter.	No	LinkedIn. Avoid	Chrome	and	Internet	Explorer	-	There’s	no	reason	to	use these	at	all	since	Tor	comes	pre-bundled	with	a	very	fine-tuned Firefox	setup.	Chrome	isn’t	built	for	Tor.	It’s	built	for	tracking	you. That’s	what	Google	does.	Google	didn’t	build	a	billion	dollar	search empire	by	playing	nice.	Just	as	Samsung	when	they	tried	to	sneak	an Adblock-like	app	into	the	Play	Store.	They	did	reinstate	it	later,	but not	without	some	heavy	oversight. Never	Open	Executables	-	If	I	absolutely	must	run	an	executable file,	pdf	or	document,	I	transfer	it	to	memory	stick	and	carry	it	by hand	to	a	computer	that	is	not	online.	I	then	copy paste	it	to	a virtual	 machine	 installed	  aka sandboxed 	so	that	if	a	virus	does	exist,	it’s	ability	to	do	damage	is limited.	Think	of	a	nuclear	weapon	going	off	underground	out	in	the Nevada	desert. Use	Tor	Bridges	-	If	Tor	brings	to	much	heat,	use	a	Bridge	Relay. While	vanilla	Tor	does	a	good	job,	it’s	not	perfect.	It	can’t	prevent	an NSA	data	center	with	huge	resources	from	doing	traffic	analysis	to determine	if	your	using	Tor.	If	you	want	to	hide	the	fact	you’re	using Tor,	then	opt	for	a	Tor	Bridge	Relay	instead	of	a	direct	connection	to  like	 VMWare	 with	 Windows	   monitor	size,	which	can	be	used	to	track	you.  Maximizing	 Tor	 Browser	 can	 allow	 websites	 to	 determine	 your  the	same	Tor	entry	point	everyone	else	uses. Act	Like	Everybody	Else	-	Tor	relayed	this	to	me	that	when	I maximized	Tor	Browser: The	solution	is	simple.	Always	use	the	default	options	whenever possible	unless	it	enhances	anonymity,	such	as	disabling	Javascript.	One comment	on	the	Tor	Blog	illuminates	why	this	is	the	case:	“Using	an unusual	screen	resolution	was	sufficient	to	identify	me	uniquely	to Panopticlick.com.	With	my	portrait	mode	screen	resolution	of	1200	wide by	1920	high,	the	default	window	size	of	1000x1765	was	unique,	no resizing	or	maximizing	needed.” A	website	can	find	out	information	about	your	screen	that	includes width,	height,	DPI,	color	depth,	and	even	font	smoothing.	A	1080p resolution	isn’t	so	bad,	but	the	worst	thing	you	can	do	is	to	resize	the	Tor browser	to	a	random	size	instead	of	maximizing	it.	Any	adversary	won’t have	a	clue	about	the	hardware	you’re	running,	but	you’ll	probably	be the	only	person	with	that	browser	size	on	each	site	you	visit. This	is	bad	since	it	means	your	activity	can	be	tracked	-	the adversary	will	know	that	sites	A,	B	and	C	were	visited	by	the	same person	despite	the	fact	that	Tor	used	three	different	IPs	to	access	those sites.Therefore,	act	like	everybody	else. Never	enter	your	real	information	online.	Perhaps	this	is obvious,	but	don’t	enter	in	anything	that	may	reveal	your	identity online.	If	asked	for	your	personal	details	when	signing	up	for	a	web site,	lie.Take	extra	caution	if	you	register	a	domain	name.	If	you	want	to set	up	a	site	of	your	own,	you	may	be	tempted	to	register	your	own domain.	Be	careful.	Domain	name	registrars	collect	a	lot	of information	and	reveal	a	lot	in	WHOIS	records.	If	you	register	a domain	name,	do	so	anonymously.   Anonymous	Android Strong	anonymity	takes	a	lot	of	hard	work	as	you’ll	soon	find	out.	It’s like	something	out	of	Pandora’s	Box. Securing	 a	 leaky,	 soul-stealing	 privacy-eating	 gremlin-toothed operating	system	like	Android	can	unleash	hell	quite	easily.	And	all	it takes	is	one	mistake,	a	simple	curiosity,	a	little	peek	that	leads	to another,	and	another	and	before	you	know	it	you’re	one	cocky,	self- absorbed	son	of	a	gun	who	can	do	no	wrong	when	the	inevitable happens.	You	take	unnecessary	risks. What	happens	to	those	on	a	motorcycle	who	take	risks?	Gun owners?	Athletes? The	day	you	lose	respect	is	the	day	you’ll	wind	up	beneath	an overturned	gasoline	tanker.	Like	chess	and	motorcycles,	it’s	just	not	an easy	platform	to	master.	In	fact,	Android	is	a	pain	in	the	ass	to	lock	down, a	beast	that	doesn’t	like	chains	and	being	told	what	to	do.	Just	when	you think	you’ve	got	her	figured	out,	she	shapeshifts. 	Changing	Android’s	Hardware	 firmware  Your	phone	or	tablet	has	two	operating	systems.	One	on	top,	such	as iOS	or	Android,	and	one	beneath	that	deals	with	all	things	radio.	That’s the	beast	in	the	basement	we	must	deal	with	if	we	are	to	sail	the	flagship named	Anonymity. It’s	housed	in	firmware	and	gets	its	meat	from	a	baseband processor,	so	it’s	a	little	difficult	to	access	without	modifications.	Make that,	dangerous	modifications. Most	of	them	run	on	the	ARM	processor	but	that’s	of	little consequence	since	you	can	replace	the	Android	operating	system	itself	if you	so	desire.	You	can	do	this	by	installing	CyanogenMod	along	with Team	Win	Recovery	Project. Required	apps: -	CyanogenMod -	Team	Win	Recovery	Project	image   -	F-Droid	package -	Orbot	from	F-Droid -	Droidwall	from	F-Droid -	Droidwall	Firewall	Scripts   Web  How	to	Access	Hidden	Onion	Sites on	the	Deep	Web	How	to	Access Hidden	Onion	Sites	on	the	Deep Onion	sites	are	those	sites	with	an	.onion	extension	that	can	only	be reached	by	using	the	Tor	Browser.	You	cannot	reach	them	on	the	open web.	Accessing	them	is	just	like	accessing	any	other	site	over	the	Tor network	as	long	as	you	know	the	address. To	that	end,	Reddit	holds	a	repository	of	interesting	darknet	articles and	a	massive	number	of	darknet	links	in	the	sidebar.	You	can	find	it	at: https:  www.reddit.com r darknetmarkets 	DeepDotWeb	is	another	site	where	you	can	harvest	many	.onion addresses.	They	even	have	comparison	charts	of	all	the	hidden	sites	that can	be	accessed	over	Tor,	with	pros	and	cons	and	even	reviews	of	each vendor	or	outlet,	updated	monthly.	After	installing	Tor	I	recommend	you set	your	homepage	to	https:  wtfismyip.com  or	the	Tor	IP	check	 check.torproject.org .	That	ensures	your	IP	is masked.   Linux	Darknet	Edition Linux	Darknet	is	just	a	fancy	term	for	Tails,	The	Amnesic	Incognito Live	System.	It	uses	the	Linux	operating	system	and	comes	highly recommended.	Bruce	Schneier	and	Ed	Snowden	along	with	a	host	of other	well-known	security	experts	cannot	praise	it’s	strengths	enough. It’s	cheap,	fast,	and	untraceable	even	for	those	new	to	the	Deep	Web.	As	a matter	of	fact,	it’s	the	perfect	incognito	tool	for	doing	 anything	on	the Deep	Web.What	You	Need: A	PC	or	laptop	capable	of	running	a	live	operating	system	via USB DVD. A	Blank	DVD	or	USB	Stick A	4GB	Stick	for	Persistence	 In	case	you	want	to	create	a persistent	volume	in	the	free	space	left	on	the	device	by	Tails Installer.	The	files	in	the	persistent	volume	are	saved	encrypted	and remain	available	across	separate	working	sessions . 	One	of	the	great	things	about	Tails	is	that	it	forgets	 everything	at shutdown.	All	files,	settings,	and	RAM	are	cleared.	When	you	need permanent	storage,	a	USB	or	SD	card	can	be	used.	More	than	likely	you will	have	sensitive	info	on	this	storage,	so	it	should	also	be	encrypted. 	How	to	Setup	Tails Warning:	Never	run	Tails	in	a	Virtual	Machine.	Doing	so	jeopardizes your	security	as	you	put	yourself	at	the	mercy	of	the	host	operating system.	Whonix	is	a	much	better	option	for	this,	which	I	go	into	detail	in my	Tor	&	the	Dark	Art	of	Anonymity	book.	One	reason	is	spelled	out	on the	Tails	website:  “Both	the	 host	 operating	system	 and	 the	virtualization	 software	 are  able	to	monitor	what	you	are	doing	in	Tails.”   	Which	means	“If	the	host	operating	system	is	compromised	with	a software	keylogger	or	other	malware,	then	it	can	break	the	security features	of	Tails“. Another	reason	is	that	traces	of	your	Tails	session	are	likely	to	be left	on	the	local	hard	disk.	For	example,	host	operating	systems	usually use	swapping	 or	paging 	which	copies	part	of	the	RAM	to	the	hard	disk. Download	the	Tails	ISO	image	from	the	Tails	website. Verify	the	image Now	choose	which	to	boot	from.	You’ve	2	choices:	USB	or	DVD. If	DVD:	Burn	the	iso	to	DVD. 	You	now	need	to	edit	the	Boot	Order.	Depending	on	your	computer you	should	see	an	entry	for	removable	drive	or	USB	media.	Move	this	to the	top	of	the	list	to	force	the	computer	to	attempt	to	start	from	your device	before	starting	from	the	hard	disk.	Disable	Fast	boot	and	Secure boot,	then	click	save	and	continue. You	should	see	the	Tails	operating	system	after	rebooting.	Now	feel free	to	hack	the	Pentagon	to	see	if	Area	51	really	was	the	site	of	a	crashed UFO.On	system	shutdown,	make	sure	everything	you	need	is	saved	either to	an	external	encrypted	drive	or	your	Persistence.	Upper	right	corner has	the	power	off	button.	Click	and	select	shutdown	to	turn	off. Alternatively:	Remove	USB	to	initiate	shutdown. Wait	for	the	RAM	to	be	wiped. Done.	You	have	completed	a	secure	session	with	Tails. Everything	not	saved	has	been	lost	and	is	irretrievable. 	Tails	is	the	most	respected	privacy	app	out	there	for	good	reason.	It leaks	the	least	data	of	every	system	in	existence	and	is	scrutinized mercilessly.	Whonix	is	also	a	good	choice,	but	it	is	less	used	and	thus	less scrutinized.	Therefore	you	should	use	Tails	as	a	starting	point	on	your   journey	that	is	the	Darknet	Marketplace	-	which	we’ll	descend	into	next.   Bypassing	Websites	That	Block	Tor I‘ll	keep	this	short	and	sweet.	By	now	you	know	that	Tor	isn’t foolproof,	especially	on	cell	phones. It’s	just	a	lock	on	your	shed	after	all,	a	lock	designed	to	make	you	a harder	target	than	the	next	guy.	Websites	know	this,	even	adversarial ones	who	do	not	like	Tor	users. Plenty	of	websites	will	block	any	IP	address	associated	with	Tor, even	if	it	is	not	an	exit	node.	The	sites	you	want	to	use	may	already	be listed	in	there. But	exit	nodes	are	not	hidden.	In	order	to	hide	your	Tor	usage	you need	to	proxy-chain	a	VPN	so	that	any	traffic	coming	out	isn’t	coming from	a	known	Tor	node.	You	can	see	a	list	of	exit	nodes	here: https:  check.torproject.org cgi-bin TorBulkExitList.py? ip=”YOURIP” 	In	most	cases	they	may	only	be	able	to	block	the	largest	and	most used	exit	nodes,	but	if	you	cannot	access	a	particular	website,	use	their own	tools	against	them	by	configuring	Tor	 via	the	torrc	file 	to	use	an exit	node	that	recently	joined	the	network	 up	to	a	few	hours	or	days, whichever	you	need . You’ll	sneak	into	the	castle	and	past	the	anti-Tor	drawbridge because	it	takes	time	for	a	website	to	update	the	Tor	block	list. If	on	the	other	hand	you’d	like	to	setup	Tor	to	only	use	exit	nodes from	a	specific	country	 like	the	USA	for	example ,	then	you	need	to	look for	the	torrc	file	inside	the	Tor	Browser	directory	 Data Tor  	and	add this	line	to	the	torrc	file	using	a	text	editor:	ExitNodes	{us}   is	 the	 most	 commonly	 assumed	 threat	 when	 analyzing	 theoretical anonymity	designs.	But	like	all	practical	low-latency	systems,	Tor	does	not protect	against	such	a	strong	adversary.  Government	Tracking	of	Tor	Users Can	the	government	track	which	sites	I	visit	over	Tor? 	Tor’s	design	document	Section	3.1	states:	A	global	passive	adversary 	If	you’ve	got	three-letter	agencies	after	you	and	they	have	a	special interest	in	obtaining	your	data,	it’d	be	easier	to	just	deliver	a	payload remotely	by	way	of	a	keylogger	and,	failing	that,	done	covertly	with assistance	from	local	LE	where	they	may	send	out	an	unmarked	car	to initiate	surveillance	of	your	property. These	days,	especially	in	the	United	States,	any	judge	will	gladly	take the	two	seconds	it	requires	to	sign	a	subpoena	if	law	enforcement	waves a	few	colorful	alarm	words	at	them	 terrorism,	child	porn,	survivalist gremlins ,	with	many	judges	not	bothering	to	ask	whether	or	not	you’re simply	using	Tor	to	help	the	network	out. For	most	users,	Tor	provides	the	best	available	protection	against	a well-resourced	observer.	It’s	an	open	question	how	much	protection	Tor  or	any	other	existing	anonymous	communications	tool 	provides against	the	NSA’s	large-scale	Internet	surveillance.	On	its	own,	Tor	can’t protect	against	attacks	against	vulnerabilities	on	your	computer	or	its software. If	the	adversary	is	the	NSA,	a	seriously	strong	SIGINT	entity,	the	best offense	is	a	good	defense	-	being	a	pain	in	the	neck	to	target.	That’s	the goal.	You	must	look	and	act	like	everyone	else	because	it	disrupts	the intelligence-gathering	cycle.	A	well-funded	SIGINT	entity	like	the	NSA won’t	waste	time	going	over	your	cleartext	communications	since	your metadata	&	ID	patterns	are	good	enough.	That’s	why	any	agency	worth its	salt	will	be	much	better	at	targeting	than	crypto-analysis. For	this	reason	you	should	always	use	Tor	on	something	other	than   a	cell	phone	if	you	can	help	it.	Reason	being	is	that	they	monitor everything	they	can	get	their	paws	on	before	feeding	this	data	into	the beast	system	for	whatever	endgame	their	planning.	There’s	no	doubt anymore	on	this. And	until	the	night	of	the	long	knives	and	we	see	enemies	of	the state	strung	up	by	their	feet	 like	those	old	black	and	white	photos , there	will	be	no	end	to	data	harvesting. Onionscan	may	be	of	some	use	to	check	for	security	holes.   Tor	&	SMS	Verification Like	the	annoying	buzz	of	a	fly,	Tor	users	have	to	deal	with	SMS verifications	to	register	for	a	website	on	occasion.	Hidden	services	as well,	it	seems,	must	deal	with	it,	even	merchants. Be	very	careful	with	this.	Optimally	your	threat	model	should	not require	any	such	‘verification’	outside	the	usual	opsec	tools.	Exposing yourself	 by	way	of	a	cell 	in	this	way	not	only	grants	the	media	sites	you visit	a	nice	gourmet	of	your	metadata,	but	any	network	operator,	law enforcement	or	hacker	may	join	in	for	a	bite	if	you	use	the	same	cell	to login	to	social	media	sites.	Until	we	have	traceless	SMS,	I’d	avoid	that	site for	anything	requiring	anonymity. But	 for	 Darknet	 Marketplaces,	 take	 a	 gander	 below.	 It’s	 a hypothetical	scenario	involving	a	Tor	user	who	wants	to	buy	from	a Black	Market	vendor.	Who	cares	what	he	wants	to	buy.	That’s	his business.	But	the	vendor	in	question	has	a	decent	reputation	on	Agora Marketplace,	so	the	customer	sends	over	his	PGP	info	 encrypted	of course . 	Vendor:	That	PGP	data	didn’t	make	it	through.	Use	SMS4Tor	ok?	 he sends	the	link . Customer:	I’ll	just	resend	PGP	using	the	profile	key	you	gave. Vendor:	Still	ain’t	workin,	pal.	Dunno	why	not	cuz	you	ordered	last week.Customer:	Last	week?	Wasn’t	me	as	I’ve	never	ordered	from	you. Will	you	resend	that	public	key	again	so	I	can	import	it	 again 	and	re- send?Vendor:	Methinks	you’re	using	a	different	PGP	app.	Same	as	last week.	 he	then	issues	more	demands  Notice	anything	off	about	the	above	conversation?	I	do.	The	vendor is	an	incompetent	clown.	Two	PGP	apps	not	compatible?	That’s something	either	a	cop	or	hacker	might	say	to	get	more	information	 i.e. fishing .	It’s	the	same	tactic	Homeland	Security	uses	when	they	infiltrate   chat	rooms	and	try	to	fish	for	some	new	meat	who’s	a	first-time	buyer. Whether	incompetence	comes	by	way	of	a	hacker	or	an	incompetent stooge	vendor,	never	jeopardize	your	safety	by	assuming	they	are	just having	an	‘off	day’	and	blow	it	off.	Follow	your	gut,	always.	If	something doesn’t	smell	right,	RUN.   Tor	Pranks	&	Cell	Phones There	are	a	lot	of	bored	college	students	out	there	who	believe	Tor makes	for	one	seriously	strong	suit	of	armor	against	any	and	all	would- be	opponents,	and	an	invisible	one	at	that.	An	invisible	knight	is,	well, pretty	formidable	foe.	Maybe	these	jesters	just	feel	they	were	born	in	the wrong	century.	Regardless,	we	can	learn	a	lot	from	their	folly.	You,	o’ anonymous	traveler,	must	use	the	gift	of	discernment	to	rightly	divide fantasy	from	reality	because	what	works	in	the	world	of	Faerun	doesn’t squire	well	with	the	real	world. A	Harvard	kid	decided	he	wasn’t	quite	prepared	for	final	exams,	so he	emailed	a	bomb	threat	to	get	out	of	taking	them.	He	used	Tor	and	a throwaway	email	account	to	cover	his	online	footprint,	only	little	did	he know	that	all	the	school	officials	had	to	do	was	search	through	the campus	lab’s	logs	to	discern	who	accessed	Tor	at	that	time.	It	led	them straight	to	his	dorm	room. It	probably	didn’t	help	that	he	used	Harvard’s	WiFi	to	access	Tor.	He was	the	only	one	who	did	at	that	particular	time. If	you	are	at	a	Mardi	Gras	party	and	everyone	else	has	removed	their masks	except	you,	you’re	going	to	stand	out.	If	you	want	to	be anonymous,	then	use	tools	that	enable	you	to	look	like	everyone	else when	 everyone	 else	 is	 using	 it.	Our	Harvard	friend	did	not.	Imagine yourself	paying	cash	for	something	small.	Cash	is	considered	king	for anonymity	but	can	backfire	if	you’re	the	only	one	using	it	to	pay	for	a brand	new	Camaro	in	a	200	mile	radius. Recall	what	Kevin	Mitnick	 hacker	wanted	by	the	FBI 	said	upon	his arrest;	that	Tsutomu	Shimomura,	a	computer	security	expert,	had broken	the	‘rules’	by	helping	the	Feds	nab	him	instead	of	relying	on	his technical	expertise	-	and	nothing	else.	He	thought	it	a	game	and	any attack	vector	would	come	through	Tor	and	Tor	alone.	For	this	reason	you mustn’t	think	of	anonymity	as	some	fantasy	game	with	a	ruleset.	Cops	do not	play	by	the	rules.	They	play	dirty.	They	break	the	rules.	They	break the	law.	Then	they	break	you	because	you	think	they	are	confined	by   their	own	laws.	Only	they	are	not. Any	action,	especially	a	cell	phone	prank	like	that	of	our	Harvard genius,	leaves	breadcrumbs	for	others	to	follow.	When	you	use	WiFi	at Starbucks	for	example,	then	you	are	there	in	the	flesh	doing	the	deed	and in	well	range	of	CCTV	surveillance.	There	are	fingerprints	on	your	coffee cup;	the	same	you	pitched	into	the	trashcan	alongside	your	slightly	used comb.So	blend	in	to	the	detriment	of	comfort.	Avoid	layers	of	anonymity that	produce	complex	requirements	yet	produce	more	visibility.	Ninjas in	ancient	Japan	did	not	look	like	the	sort	of	ninja	Chuck	Norris	went	toe to	toe	against	in	The	Octagon. They	didn’t	wear	black	pajamas.	They	looked	like	your	neighborly rice	farmer,	one	among	dozens	of	other	rice	farmers.	Sort	of	like	SAS wearing	burkas	to	sneak	into	ISIS	HQ.   Black	Markets	on	the	Deep	Web Here	are	a	few	things	you	can	buy	on	the	Deep	Web	you	may	not have	heard	about. Rare	Opsec	Manuals	for	Survivalists Rare	Special	Ops	Guides 3D	Printed	Guns	and	Bullets Drugs	for	Cancer Japanese	Manga Books	on	How	to	Overthrow	Governments Top	Darknet	Markets There	are	two	types	of	Blackmarket	Drug	emporiums	on	the	Deep Web.	Those	you	trust	and	those	you	don’t.	Below	is	a	list	of	some	of	the more	popular	black	market	outlets.	One	or	two	may	be	gone	already	by the	time	this	book	goes	to	press.	In	five	years	all	of	them	may	be	gone. The	point	here	isn’t	to	steer	you	into	any	one	of	these	in	particular	or even	that	I	want	you	to	buy	illegal	drugs	 I	don’t ,	but	to	remind	you	that none	of	these	sites	will	last	forever	just	as	Google	and	Microsoft	won’t last	forever. Something	will	come	along	to	replace	the	behemoths	just	as	surely the	same	as	AltaVista,	Infoseek,	Napster	and	Divx	were	replaced.	It	can happen	quick.	My	grandfather’s	motto:	Never	gamble	or	invest	more than	you	can	afford	to	lose. Agora	Marketplace Established:	Dec	3,	2013 Invite	 Required    Abraxas	Market Established:	Dec	13,	2014 Invite	 Required  Established:	Dec	22,	2014 Taken	down	by	the	FBI	in	2017 Established:	Nov	15,	2013 Invite	 Required 	Nucleus	Market Established:	Nov	24,	2014   Established:	Apr	28,	2015 Established:	Dec	29,	2013 Established:	Dec	22,	2014 Middle	Earth	Marketplace Established:	Jun	22,	2014 Established:	Apr	26,	2015 Established:	Unknown The	Russian	Anonymous	Marketplace	 aka	RAMP  Established:	Unknown   Marketplace	Invites You	may	have	noticed	that	a	handful	of	these	markets,	such	as Agora,	require	invites.	What	this	means	is	if	you’re	a	new	buyer	or vendor	or	even	just	a	nosy	parker	lurking	around,	you	cannot	register without	an	invite	link	from	an	already	registered	user.	That’s	just	how	it is	with	some	of	the	more	established	outlets. Also,	don’t	assume	that	because	a	website’s	been	around	longer	than the	others	that	it	is	more	secure,	and	never	assume	that	a	closed	door means	it	is	closed	forever,	or	for	even	a	long	time.	At	Agora	for	instance, you’ll	sometimes	see	this	error:	“Cannot	register	at	this	time,	user	limit reached.	Please	wait	until	full	time	release.” It’s	confusing	because	it’s	meant	to	be.	They	try	to	be	as	cryptic	as possible	to	throw	off	anyone	looking	to	take	them	down.	The	first	option is	to	either	sit	tight	for	a	few	hours	and	give	the	server	time	to	catch	it’s breath,	or… -	Visit	the	forum	of	the	marketplace	you’re	trying	to	reach	and	ask for	an	invite.	Failing	this,	you	can	-	Visit	the	Reddit	subforum	of	the market	in	question. Two	points	to	say	on	this. First,	if	you’re	using	a	long	term	account	and	login	using	Tor,	then your	activity	can	build	a	profile	of	sorts,	all	based	on	what	you	do	on	the Reddit	site.	Tor	can’t	really	prevent	this	from	happening	so	if	you	want	to preserve	your	anonymity,	you	must	keep	your	‘real’	identity	and	‘hidden’ identity	completely	separate.	One	way	is	to	never	log	into	any	account with	both	identities. The	second	point	about	Reddit	is	merely	a	suggestion:	Beware	of phishing	links	there,	both	on	related	as	well	as	non-Darknet	related subreddits.	I’d	not	recommend	using	any	link	in	any	subreddit,	for example,	unless	you	recognize	it.	Many	are	plagued	with	phishing	links that	comprise	more	than	half	of	the	help	desk’s	‘can’t	login	with password’	topics.	All	referral	links	are	safe	as	long	as	the	link	begins	with the	official	Agora	URL.	Anything	else	is	likely	a	phishing	link.	And	the   person	whose	referral	link	you	use	doesn’t	get	any	“notifications”	or anything	letting	them	know	you	used	it,	nor	can	they	see	how	many people	used	their	link.	You	are	completely	anonymous	to	them. If	you	can	remember	two	phone	numbers,	then	you	can	remember 16-characters	for	an	official	link.	If	you	still	can’t	be	bothered,	there’s	a third	option. 3. 	Visit	clearnet	sites	that	spell	out	where	the	site	is	and	even	have rating	systems	in	place.	One	such	place	is	DarknetMarkets.org,	but	there are	others	you	can	Google	for	yourself	that	will	also	have	the	forum .onion	address	you	need	to	access	them. Just	be	warned	that	they,	like	many	hidden	servers	across	the	Deep Web,	come	and	go	like	the	tide.	Some	will	even	change	their	.onion address	for	security	reasons	and	some	will	go	down	as	felled	trees because	of	DDOS	attacks,	hacking	attempts	or	that	gut	feeling	you	get when	the	spider	you	threw	behind	the	dresser	in	the	wee	morning	hours is	now	looking	at	you	from	across	the	room	like	he	wants	to	skate	down your	spine	with	a	flamethrower. In	other	words,	always	assume	someone	is	watching.

Darknet	Tools  DarkNet	Dictionary	and	Other If	some	of	the	technical	words	in	these	chapters	confuse	you	 and	I readily	admit	to	throwing	them	around	like	Mardi	Gras	beads ,	don’t despair.

Too	 much transparency	can	be	catastrophic	to	any	Darknet	Marketplace	or	even	a single	purchase,	especially	when	dealing	with	a	place	like	Agora.

Fake	passports	can	be	bought	online	as	gag	gifts	that	wouldn’t fool	a	TSA	officer	but	would	fool	the	mailman	and	maybe	even	the UPS	store	employee.

That	means	putting	those	coins	through	a	tumbler	like Coinbase	first	before	any	depositing	goes	on	at	the	Agora	address.	If you	withdraw	from	Agora,	it’s	the	reverse	procedure: Agora	account	to	tumbler	to	Coinbase	and	 then	into	your	Bitcoin Wallet.Which	Bitcoin	Tumblers,	you	ask?	Well,	the	most	stable	ones you	can	find.	For	2016	onward,	Grams	Helix	Light	is	the	top	choice, al	though	you’re	hit	with	a	2.5%	fee	for	the	total	cost.	BitBlender	is also	a	good	choice	but	they	require	account	setups.	SharedCoin	is yet	another	but	I	found	it	makes	it	harder	to	figure	out	who	sent bitcoins	to	what	address.	It	uses	a	different	method	of	relaying	than the	others.	This	is	primarily	for	small	buyers,	not	for	someone looking	to	pack	a	warehouse	with	marijuana	bricks	in	Chicago, Illinois.It	may	come	to	pass	that	you’ve	ordered	something	and	haven’t received	it	yet.	It’s	been	ages.	Have	you	been	scammed?	Locked	out of	your	account?	Or	maybe	your	bitcoins	never	showed	up	in	your Agora	account?	Don’t	fall	on	your	sword	just	yet.	What	you	need	to do	is	message	the	market	admins,	not	any	forum	at	Ars	Technica	or Reddit	or	anyplace	else,	and	send	a	 private 	message	to	‘Agora’ detailing	your	problem.	The	backlog	of	tickets	is	considerable	but they	will	get	back	to	you	in	48	hours,	usually.	They	tend	to	bump you	further	down	the	priority	list	if	you	go	overboard	and	start issuing	threats,	however,	so	don’t	burn	any	bridges	by	giving	them any	catitude.   To	Finalize	Early	or	Not? I	explored	this	topic	in	my	Tor	and	the	Dark	Art	of	Anonymity	book and	I’ll	mention	it	here,	albeit	briefly. Opsec	lessons	can	be	costly.	Finalize	Early,	which	means	you	pay	a vendor	 before	you	receive	the	magical	goods,	can	wreck	your	life	like none	other.	In	general	you	should	avoid	ever	doing	this	since	the	risks alone	will	give	you	an	ulcer. Many	before	you	can	attest	to	getting	ripped	off	to	the	tune	of	five figures	or	more.	Vendors	can	build	up	trust	a	long	time	before	they	bolt with	the	bitcoins,	a	scheme	called	Exit	Scamming.	That’s	when	the vendor,	a	sneering	twirly-mustached	little	man	works	his	black	magic and	makes	off	with	the	loot.	Your	loot. Newcomers	like	to	trust	them	implicitly	not	to	rip	them	off,	until they	do.	Then	they	spam	Usenet,	Reddit,	Ars	Technica	and	every	other tech	site	with	doom	and	gloom	as	though	said	evil	man	set	off	a	tactical nuke	in	New	Jersey. Amazon,	eBay	and	Newegg	all	have	trackable	systems	in	place	that, when	linked	with	those	utilized	by	credit	card	companies	and	banks,	can save	your	hide	and	get	you	your	stolen	funds	back.	Sometimes.	Darknet Marketplaces	don’t	however.	If	you	get	robbed	then	it’s	highly	likely	you won’t	be	getting	your	money	back	and	you’ll	likely	not	be	alone	in	that regard.400	positive	feedbacks	sounds	like	a	lot	of	happy	customers.	Only	it isn’t.	A	vendor	with	thousands	of	deals	under	his	belt	would	be	a	lot	of happy	customers	IF	he	has	a	good	rating	to	boot	and	IF	you’ve	done	your research,	but	even	then	it	doesn’t	justify	losing	every	coin	you	own.   International	vs.	Domestic	Orders Pride	 goeth	 before	 destruction,	 and	 an	 haughty	 spirit	 before	 a	 fall	- Proverbs	16:18 	I	always	like	to	remember	that	verse	when	I	travel	overseas.	It’s	to remind	myself	not	to	get	too	cocky	in	foreign	markets. Do	you	travel	overseas?	Have	a	passport?	Bank	cards?	Email? Imagine	that	every	day	you	wake	up	every	little	thing	that	happens	to you	has	to	be	looked	at	with	suspicion.	Emails	from	family.	Your	new girlfriend.	Whenever	the	phone	rings.	That’s	what	it	is	to	be	a	slave,	a slave	to	your	own	ego. You	may	think	there’s	something	magical	about	buying	illegal	items from	international	ports	of	call.	Don’t	believe	the	hype.	It’s	the	same	tune but	with	twice	the	headache.	Whether	international	falls	into	the	“Thou Shalt”	or	“Shalt	Not”	category	is	up	to	you	of	course,	but	how	many migraines	do	you	want?	One	lump	or	twenty?	Can	you	lose	it	all	without losing	your	sanity?	Do	you	want	it	quick	or	safe	and	secret? Turkey	and	the	Netherlands	brings	with	it	more	potency	but increased	security.	Increased	security	means	higher	risk.	Higher	risk means	more	intense	pain. Content	from	these	exotic	locales	draw	unwanted	attention	and stand	out	from	other	packages	unless	some	extensive	pre-made	cover has	been	setup.	Australia	comes	to	mind.	It’s	riskier	than	other	places. The	biggest	risk	is	where	the	Deep	Web	intersects	with	the	international Real	World	-	and	getting	the	stuff	delivered	to	you	-	and	keeping	you	and your	family	safe. A	few	pointers: NEVER	check	the	status	of	a	package	through	Tor.	Packages tracked	via	Tor	are	automatically	flagged. Never	send	contraband	from	a	state	where	it	is	legal	 i.e. Colorado .   If	you’re	a	vendor,	never	plaster	your	site	with	the	word “Cheap!!”	and	then	try	and	slide	in	heavy	shipping	costs	at	the	last second.	Customers	hate	that. Don’t	use	first.last@gmail.com	as	your	email	address,	as	other dumb	people	have	 though	granted	Ross	didn’t	know	he	was creating	a	Black	Market	Amazon,	nor	did	he	have	any	knowledge	of the	Snowden Prism Lolsec	revelations . No	teams.	EVERYONE	cooperates	or	you	can’t	operate	=	not likely.	Also,	any	website	that	must	rely	on	distribution	via	US	mail	is going	to	have	a	very	bad	day.	Couriers	are	better. 	An	international	buy	is	much	the	same	as	domestic	except	it	comes with	substantially	higher	risk	and	has	the	added	value	that	you	can	be extradited	to	the	other	country	after	the	U.S	asset	forfeiture	laws	clean your	carcass	of	any	link	to	humanity	-	assuming	there’s	anything	left since	the	U.S.A	is	the	prison	capitol	of	the	world.  Now	I’m	off	to	finally	get	those	rocket	launchers	in	my	car reloaded.    Black	Market	Arrests We’ve	seen	what	happens	with	money	and	ego.	One	always	prevails over	the	other.	Watch	the	film	Heat	starring	Al	Pacino.	One	guy	on	the team	of	thieves,	the	new	guy,	gets	everyone	else	killed	or	close	to	it.	His bad	opsec	destroys	everyone	else’s	good	opsec;	the	rotten	apple	or	yeast parable	applies	here:	A	little	bad	ruins	the	whole	dough. There’s	one	site	I	found	quite	informative	in	this	department.	It	lists every	black	market	arrest	imaginable.	Interestingly	the	list	omits	a glaring	data	set:	one	that	involves	each	darknet	market	operator’s	OPSEC -	admittedly	hard	to	quantify.	Take	Silk	Road	for	instance.	From	the	link we	can	deduce	that	opsec	just	isn’t	that	high	a	priority	for	some	users. 	  “No	 single	 theme	 emerges	 reading	 through	 the	 many	 arrests.	 Some people	are	busted	through	sheer	bad	luck	in	being	randomly	pulled	over	or their	packages	inspected;	some	are	undone	by	other	peoples’	mistakes,	and some	have	no	one	but	themselves	to	blame	for	talking	to	a	policeman	and blurting	out	all	their	secrets;	some	are	undone	by	their	trust	in	others,	and some	are	undone	by	lying	to	federal	agents;	some	are	undone	by	signing	for packages,	 while	 others	 are	 undone	 by	 a	 stray	 fingerprint;	 some	 followed the	OPSEC	rules	and	some	engaged	in	mind-boggling	follies	like	using	their real	 return	 address	 or	 accepting	 payment	 to	 their	 own	 bank	 account	 or running	their	own	clearnet	site;	some	clammed	up,	denied	everything,	and saved	themselves,	while	others	kept	records	of	everything	 perhaps	in	the misguided	 belief	 it	 would	 earn	 them	 clemency	 in	 the	 worst 	 and	 only condemned	 themselves;	 some	 were	 busted	 at	 home,	 others	 in	 the totalitarian	 zones	 of	 international	 borders;	 some	 were	 busted	 through high-tech	 browser-based	 deanonymization,	 but	 most	 through	 low-tech methods	 like	 a	 customer	 or	 friend	 snitching;	 some	 sellers’	 packages	 are spotted	 during	 Customs	 inspections,	 and	 some	 are	 noticed	 only	 when delivery	fails	&	the	bogus	return	addresses	explode.”   OPSEC	for	Buyers Mark	Twain	once	said,	“I	don’t	like	to	commit	myself	about	heaven and	hell.	You	see,	I	have	friends	in	both	places.” 	OPSEC	is	more	important	than	anything	else	when	it	comes	to buying	Darknet	product.	You	can	never	have	enough,	so	it’s	a	little	like ammo.	If	you	were	in	Ukraine	when	the	Soviets	invaded	would	you	be better	off	playing	the	part	of	sniper	or	just	cutting	bait	and	running? Sometimes	you	just	have	to	do	both.	Allow	me	to	run	through	a	few truths	that	make	this	a	little	more	applicable. 	Your	Machine	is	Your	Fortress Tor	is	a	fine	tool	for	playing	cloak	and	dagger	with	small	purchases, but	it	isn’t	suitable	for	large	orders	or	running	from	the	FBI.	Given	what’s happened	in	the	U.S.	and	UK	over	the	last	5	years	even	small	orders	may be	 detrimental	 to	 your	 freedom.	 And	 free	 speech.	 Government bureaucrats	 have	 all	 but	 guaranteed	 they	 respect	 neither	 the Constitution	nor	our	laws. So	then.	What	can	we	learn	from	Silk	Road?	Well	first	off,	there’s evidence	that	Silk	Road’s	servers	were	misconfigured	and	revealing	IP addresses	and	that	they	were	doing	it	repeatedly.	The	index	page	gave away	the	IP	address	for	several	minutes	via	a	print_r	debug	message printed	to	every	requesting	browser.	That’s	the	online	goofs,	but	you	can screw	up	offline,	too. 	Silk	Road	Lessons 1. 	Your	encryption	keys	to	your	drives	are	as	sacred	as	your	PGP keys.	Do	not	give	them	out.	Not	to	your	roommate,	your	girlfriend	or your	mother,	and	especially	not	to	your	friends.	Not	even	your	business partner	Eddie. 	2. 	Leave	your	PC	unattended	at	your	own	peril.	With	your	OS   booted	and	up	and	running,	anyone	from	thieves	to	cops	to	jealous girlfriends	can	access	anything	on	your	hard	drive	that	isn’t	nailed	as tight	as	a	coffin	 i.e.	encrypted	containers . 	3. 	Talk	at	your	own	PERIL.	That	is,	never	mention	darknet marketplaces	to	anyone.	Feign	ignorance.	While	you	needn’t	do	a disappearing	act	like	Bilbo	Baggins	did,	telling	one	person	will	almost always	have	the	same	effect	as	telling	a	dozen	people,	all	strangers.	And it	almost	always	is	valuable	to	someone,	somewhere. 	4. 	Keep	your	Darknet	Marketplace	username pass	under	lock	and key.	Write	it	down	in	a	text	file	but	encrypt	it	with	Veracrypt	or	PGP.	No stickies. 	5. 	Use	different	username passwords	for	different	markets.   Psych	Tricks The	following	are	merely	suggestions,	nothing	more,	and	are	more apt	to	apply	to	creative	types	over	say,	mathematicians. Music:	Certain	kinds	of	music	reproduce	specific	kinds	of	behavior. Stephen	King	listens	to	AC DC	when	he	writes.	He	cranks	it	up. Personally	I	feel	an	aneurism	coming	on	if	I	try	to	write	to	that.	So	I	listen to	Steve	Roach,	ambient	composer	with	titles	like	Dreamtime	Return	and Early	Man.	Dreamy	wispy	music.	It	works.	If	I	switch	it	up	then	I	lose focus	and	get	distracted	too	easily. Light Darkness:	In	almost	every	scene	in	The	Matrix,	Neo	can	be seen	always	working	in	the	dark.	Even	his	display	glows	a	matrix-green with	cryptic	lettering,	the	only	brightness	in	the	room	being	that	of	his monochrome	skin.	Works	for	me	too.	Almost	like	a	sensory-deprivation chamber	and	it’s	amazing	how	much	better	I	sleep	because	of	it. Locale:	Stephen	King	once	said	that	you	don’t	need	a	glamorous ‘study’	to	write	good	stories.	You	just	need	something	familiar.	And	he’s right.	Having	traveled	to	a	few	countries	I	can	tell	you	that	writing	in	a new	city	every	week	is	not	remotely	possible	for	me	as	there’s	just	too many	distractions.	You	need	a	spot	like	Neo	did	-	a	place	your	identity always	goes	but	never	goes	outside	of	either	by	doorway	or	otherworldly portal.Drugs:	Caffeine,	nicotine,	sugar	highs,	but	no	prescription	drugs. They	put	me	in	a	state	of	mind	that	gets	reinforced	daily,	though	I	do	toss and	turn	at	night.	Alcohol,	Stephen	King	once	stated,	helps	immensely with	epic	fiction	writing	but	kills	you	in	the	process.	I	can	vouch	for	that. Scents:	My	girlfriend	used	to	light	caramel	candles	to	scent	up	the room	whenever	she’d	come	over	from	the	ER,	usually	when	I	was	just finishing	up	a	mindblowing	chapter.	After	the	breakup	I	had	trouble finishing	chapters. The	point	of	all	of	this	is	this:	the	more	opsec	you	employ	on	a	daily basis,	the	more	your	brain	will,	IF	put	into	action,	develop	an	opsec- focused	mindset	that	doesn’t	have	to	be	turned	on	every	day.	It	just	kicks   in.	Automatic.	Razor	sharp	as	piranha	teeth.	It	does	this	because	it’s burned	in	like	ram	on	a	motherboard.	Like	pushing	a	button	to	boot Linux,	you	open	your	eyes	and	it’s	there,	waiting	for	orders.	It’ll	be	there especially	when	any	dangerous	developments	present	themselves. Develop	and	hone	this	and	you	won’t	mistake	that	woodpecker	at	6	AM for	a	group	of	angry	white-hot	stormtroopers. Engaging	in	shady	deals	is	a	little	like	gambling.	The	house	always wins	if	you	keep	playing.	If	you	can’t	work	the	opsec	well	then	the	only winning	move,	as	Matthew	Broderick	found	out	in	Wargames,	is	not	to play.	If	you	continue	to	play	recklessly,	it’ll	be	tough	to	find	a	lawyer	who takes	payment	in	bitcoins.   Vendor	Opsec  You	get	what	you	pay	for,	and	playing	cheap	gets	expensive	if	you’re caught.	For	any	Tor	hidden	server	operator,	that	means	never	letting	the reins	fall	into	someone	else’s	hands.	Not	your	associates,	your	girlfriend or	cousin	Eddie	because	it’s	you	and	you	alone	they’re	coming	after,	lock stock	and	barrel. One	torpedo	can	wipe	out	an	entire	battleship	and	they	only	have	to get	lucky	once.	You	can’t	afford	a	lucky	strike,	so	you	as	captain	need	to sense	when	something’s	‘off’	so	you	can	pull	the	plug	without	having	to explain	why.	Partners	will	demand	to	know	why	of	course,	but	it’s	better to	run	silent	and	deep. Ross	Ulbricht	failed	in	this	department.	But	we	can	learn	a	lot	from his	mistakes. Looking	through	the	court	details	of	his	arrest	one	gets	the impression	that	he	was	not	only	lax	in	basic	IT	security,	but	that	he	knew nothing	about	how	search	engines	track	users	at	all.	So	Lady	Luck	never really	had	to	come	into	the	FBI’s	playbook	at	all.	The	guy	was	just	sloppy and	might	as	well	have	slapped	on	the	cuffs	himself. Ross	was	caught	long	before	Silk	Road	grew	mega-popular.	Court documents	reveal	security	mistakes	that	a	rookie	drug	dealer	on	Miami Vice	might	have	made,	not	someone	in	charge	of	a	multi-million	dollar Deep	Web	drug	operation.	Here	are	a	few	of	Ross’s	opsec	blunders. 	 Advertising	openly	on	the	Bitcoin	Talk	forum	that	he	needed	an IT	guy	for	a	hidden	Tor	service	-	and	then	using	his	real	name	for	a Gmail	address	and	his	Silk	Road	Wordpress	site,	a	site	he	connected to	from	outside	of	Tor. Ross’s	Google	Plus	account	connected	to	his	Gmail	with	a	list	of his	favorite	Austrian	economic	theory	videos,	the	same	theories	he’d bragged	about	using	for	Silk	Road	on	more	than	one	clearnet	forum. Using	code	for	SilkRoad	from	a	public	programming	site	 i.e.   StackOverflow ,	from	an	account	never	accessed	with	Tor	with	his IP	address	being	out	in	the	open	for	months.	Any	law	enforcement official	could	track	these	breadcrumbs	at	their	leisure. Using	his	real	identity	on	LinkedIn,	with	links	to	Silk	Road musings	on	his	Wordpress	blogs. These	are	just	some	of	the	mistakes	he	made,	to	say	nothing	about his	lax	hidden	server	settings.	Besides	these,	there’s	a	lot	to	be	said	for smart	vendors	who	know	good	security. 	Vendor	Guidelines	Part	I These	are	just	like	the	buyer	opsec	rules,	except	in	reverse.	Short and	sweet.Use	a	sanitized	laptop,	cash	bought,	with	only	a	Linux	distro configured	to	run	Tor	and	 only	Tor,	with	no	other	outgoing connections	allowed. Dissolving	your	real-life	persona	and	using	different	usernames on	every	forum	visited	with	no	non-Tor	IP	addresses	exposed. Not	residing	in	the	USA.	This	is	a	big	one. No	ordering	of	fake	IDs	in	the	USA	 vendors	only 	or	any	other contraband	that’d	raise	suspicion	with	authorities. 	Vendor	Guidelines,	Part	II You’ve	read	this	far	and	want	to	be	a	vendor,	or	at	least	know	what it	takes	to	be	one	and	not	get	caught	 cue	Miami	Vice	theme . This	is	very	shady	territory.	Mostly	illegal.	The	risks	here	carry	an awful	lot	of	pain	if	you	screw	it	up,	and	it’s	far	more	pain	than	what	the Shady	Acres	Homeowner	Association	would	give	you	for	not	curbing your	dog. There’s	no	accidents	here. No	‘accidentally’	slipping	on	rings	found	in	dark,	damp	caves.	No ‘but	I	was	only	looking	for	UFOs’	excuses.	Success	in	the	black	arts	tends to	fuel	a	life	of	it’s	own	much	like	Sauron’s	ring	of	Power.	It’s	knowledge that	 wants	to	be	abused.	Before	we	discuss	the	criminal	element,	let’s   discuss	the	business	side	of	things. You	have	to	be	a	businessman.	If	you’re	smart	you	should consider	investing	$500	and	take	an	introduction	course	at	the university.	Do	it	online.	You’ll	need	to	know	the	ins	and	outs	of	mail- order,	accounts	and	ledgers	 and	when	to	dispose	of	them ,	and	how to	replenish	your	products.	Doing	it	all	anonymously	raises	the difficulty	by	a	factor	of	ten.	It’s	hard	work	even	when	it’s	legal products. Sell	fakes	at	first.	Cubic	zirconium	rings.	Flour.	Fake	credit cards.	Not	to	real	customers	but	to	yourself,	and	long	before	any	real product	matures. Money	talks.	Invest	in	a	site	that	charges	a	fee	for	vendors. People	take	you	seriously	when	they	know	you’ve	got	startup capital.Create	a	Dark	Persona.	This	is	the	hardest	part	of	all,	as	this person	must	be	the	opposite	of	the	real	You	in	every	detail:	Politics. Sexual	taste.	Movies.	Style.	Age.	Locale.	Accent.	If	you’re	confused	on what	this	means,	watch	The	Matrix.	Neo	lives	two	lives	and	the Agents	know	it.	It’s	why	it	was	so	hard	to	track	him	down.	One	is	a hacker	who	specialized	in	obtaining	contraband	and	the	other works	in	a	respected	software	company	and	 in	my	best	Agent Smith	impression …	helps	his	landlady	take	out	her	garbage. Like	Neo	your	offline	security	should	get	Top	Billing,	meaning	the little	pigtailed	girl	across	the	street	should	not	think	of	you	as	‘that	quiet, creepy	dude	who’s	cat	Lucifer	wails	like	a	police	siren	at	dinnertime’	and keeps	her	up	at	night.	They	need	to	think	positive	thoughts. They	should	trust	you	but	not	know	 too	much.	They	only	need	to never	suspect	anything	shady	is	going	on	-	that	you’re	good	at	fixing broken	computers,	bikes	and	love	big	dogs	but	you’d	never	do	anything to	hurt	anyone.	Never	anything	to	do	with	any	of	the	following:	Tor.	PGP. Freenet.	I2P.	Darkcoins.	Especially	Darkcoins	or	whatever	flavor	of	the month	they	come	in	since	they	too	change	like	the	wind. Pay	cash	for	everything. Avoid	social	media	outlets	like	the	Black	Plague.   You	know	the	ones. Facebook.	Twitter.	YouTube.	Instagram.	Pinterest.	These	are	locales polluted	with	diseased	gossip	that’ll	turn	any	normal	person	into	a zombie	walker	given	enough	time	with	an	unrooted	cell	phone. Neighbors	gossip	mainly	about	those	they	don’t	know.	They	fill	in empty	gaps	with	guesses	and	nonsense	and	sometimes	outright	lies.	To prevent	this,	go	to	social	engagements	or	pop	in	at	backyard	BBQs	and	be the	one	that	has	the	best	fireworks	on	the	4th	of	July,	the	same	who bought	expensive	beer	for	everyone. Be	a	volunteer	at	a	shelter.	A	no-kill	cat	shelter.	The	Salvation	Army. It	doesn’t	really	matter	what	as	long	as	your	neighbors	think	you’re	‘Nice Guy	Eddie‘. Help	the	neighborhood	kids	find	their	lost	dog	by	going	door	to	door with	his	pug	mugshot	you	ripped	off	the	telephone	pole.	Find	him	and they’ll	forgive	you	for	accidentally	launching	a	nuclear	weapon	in	a Pentagon	hack	attempt	 not	possible	by	the	way . You	get	busted,	you’ll	want	these	people	to	speak	up	for	you.	Do	all of	the	above	and	they’ll	form	a	standing	army	at	your	beck	and	call.	Just never	mention	Tor,	PGP	and	the	rest,	not	even	to	dear	old	Dad	who	you can	be	quite	certain	will	brag	at	every	BBQ	you	go	to	that	you’re Snowden’s	long	lost	brother. Change	PGP	keys	frequently	if	and	when	your	business	grows.	Avoid using	any	of	your	own	handwriting	on	anything.	Neither	your	name, address,	favorite	colors,	nicknames	you	use	on	various	forums. Research	the	following:	Cashing	Bitcoins	Mail	Anonymity Stealth Stealth	Materials	Competitive	Pricing	Customer	Service	 i.e.	How	to	keep your	customers	coming	back	for	more . Sales	copywriting.	Read	Cashvertising,	a	book	on	writing	copy	for anything.Research	the	best	lawyer	to	have	for	whatever	it	is	you’re	selling.   Postal	Drops	&	Controlled	Deliveries Now	for	the	real	black	market	opsec.	The	first	topic	we’ll	discuss	is controlled	deliveries,	a	term	used	by	those	on	both	sides	of	the	law. What’s	a	controlled	delivery? It’s	a	way	for	law	enforcement	to	dupe	you	into	accepting	a	package containing	illegal	goods.	It	could	be	anything.	Drugs.	Guns.	Japanese manga	that	involves	underage	‘cat’	girls.	All	in	the	hopes	you’ll	accept	the package	and	make	some	off-the-cuff	remark	about	the	contents.	They hope. Then	they	can	search	your	house.	They	need	only	establish	you knew	the	package	was	coming,	what	it	contained	or	what	you	intended on	doing	with	it.	Smoking	it,	of	course,	but	one	out	of	three	is	usually sufficient	to	get	a	search	warrant.	Let’s	dispense	with	a	few	myths	first prior	to	counter-surveillance	techniques. Myth	1:	If	a	person	receives	any	type	of	contraband	in	the	mail,	he can	be	arrested	on	the	spot.	Guilt	by	association. FALSE. If	receiving	anything	illegal	in	the	mail	is	enough	to	send	a	guy	to	the Big	House	with	Bubba,	every	school	bully	in	existence	could	get	sent	up the	creek	by	just	ordering	a	few	Scooby	sheets	of	LSD	to	his	house.	It doesn’t	work	that	way.	The	police	need	proof	that	you	know	what’s inside,	otherwise	it’s	a	no-win	case	and	they	know	it.	If	you’re	a	cool level-headed,	logical	thinking	kind	of	guy	like	Mr.	Orange	in	Reservoir Dogs	then	they’ve	got	a	problem.	If	they	see	your	stone-cold	blue	eyes are	filled	with	an	Iron	Man	resolve,	then	they	know	their	only	recourse	is to	get	you	to	flap	your	gums	before	the	adrenaline	‘fight	or	flight’	rush wears	off.	To	this	end,	there’s	a	couple	of	effective	ways	they’d	like	to deal	with	you.	Both	involve	deception. The	first	is	by	taking	the	‘Nice	Guy’	approach.	You’d	be	shocked	at how	well	they	can	get	a	stranger	to	spill	his	guts	by	playing	up	the	nice guy	angle.	Be	his	friend	so	to	speak.	His	father	confessor. When	the	heat	is	on	and	you’ve	got	a	few	stormtroopers	stomping   around	your	house	with	muddy	boots,	well,	you	want	them	to	leave.	I would	too.	And	that’s	what	they	tell	you.	We’ll	leave,	they’ll	say.	Then	the dirty	tricks	start.	They	make	any	newbie	want	to	talk	if	only	to	relieve stress.	Only	he	ends	up	spending	 years	in	prison	instead	of	a	measly three	stinking	days	because	he	never	kept	his	mouth	shut. Police	officers	and	DEA	agents	in	particular	have	had	years	to perfect	the	art	of	persuasion	by	deception.	That	means	lying	their	ass	off. If	you’ve	ever	seen	Black	Hawk	Down	then	you	know	how	ferocious a	night	raid	can	be,	where	they	may	have	to	‘clear’	a	house	by	going	room to	room	and	scaring	the	living	hell	out	of	anyone	living	there.	It’s	scary stuff.	The	cat’s	smart	enough	to	hide	under	the	bed	but	Rover	gets	shot	in the	leg.But	it	doesn’t	always	go	down	that	way. You’re	usually	seated	in	cuffs	when	the	nice	guy	routine	kicks	into high	gear.	That’s	what	they	want	to	try	first.	Nice	guy	then	mean	guy	and not	the	other	way	around	since	it’s	far	easier	to	upgrade	then	to downgrade	on	the	poor	sap’s	emotions.	Police	usually	say	something	like this.  “We	 only	 want	 the	 dealer,	 not	 you	 kid.	 Look,	 you’re	 small	 time.	 We know	it	and	you	know	it	and	your	supplier	knows	it.	You’re	useless	to	us. But	your	partner,	your	boss,	he’s	the	one	we’re	after.	The	Big	Fish.	The	Don. We	see	your	family	here	and	understand	your	situation,	we’ve	got	our	own. You’re	poor.	You	wanted	to	escape	for	an	hour,	maybe	two.	That’s	all.	We understand.	 No	 trouble	 for	 you	 if	 you	 cooperate	 and	 tell	 us	 your	 source. Where’d	you	get	these	drugs	from?”  You	give	Barney	Fife	a	long	silence	as	you	fidget	and	glance	around the	room	at	where	your	hidden	stash	is.	They’ll	say,	“Talk	so	we	can	go home	and	you	can	get	back	to	playing	The	Witcher	on	your	laptop	over there.”	 This	is	the	part	where	they’ll	lie	and	say	they’re	fans	of	the	game themselves . Should	you	talk? Can	they	be	trusted? Then	out	of	nowhere,	when	they	see	the	synapses	firing	in	your brain	that	tell	you	to	keep	your	big	trap	shut,	they	bring	out	the	‘Bad	Guy’ routine.	Nice	Guy’s	evil	twin	brother	whose	tone	sounds	an	awful	lot	like the	mouth	of	Sauron	in	the	Lord	of	the	Rings.   “Look	kid,	you’re	life’s	over.	You’re	done.	Cooked.	You’ll	lose	your	kids in	the	next	room	over	and	your	job	and	your	car	and	your	house	and	maybe even	your	cat	sitting	under	the	bed.	She’ll	be	put	to	sleep	long	before	you get	 out	 of	 jail.	 Unless	 you	 just	 give	 us	 the	 name	 so	 we	 can	 cut	 you	 some  slack,	kid.”What’s	the	first	thing	that’s	going	to	pop	into	your	head	if	you’re new	to	this? You	want	these	clowns	out	of	the	house.	Yesterday. You	want	a	clean	rep	so	the	family	doesn’t	think	you’re	Jabba the	Hutt.You	want	to	believe	them.	They’re	dressed	nice	after	all.	Clean shaven.	Shiny	boots.	Nice	haircut.	But	then	so	was	the	Terminator when	he	went	looking	for	Sarah	Connor	and	her	rebellious	pain-in- the-ass	son. Bottom	line:	Don’t	fall	for	any	of	their	lies.	You	see,	when	you’re raided	at	some	ungodly	hour	say	at	6	AM,	all	the	blood	in	your	system goes	to	your	legs	and	arms	and	you	get	what’s	called	 brain	 drain.	You become	a	moron.	A	Ferengi	or	drunk	Klingon	say	instead	of	a	logical Vulcan	who	thinks	clearly	and	invokes	that	God-given	gift	to	all	men called	 discernment.	It’s	fight	or	flight	time	and	the	cops	know	most people	won’t	use	their	brains	at	6AM	because	they’re	used	to	seeing scrambled	eggs.	They’d	rather	fight,	run	away	or	just	sign	on	the	dotted line	to	shut	em	up	so	they’ll	leave,	leave,	LEAVE! Don’t	let	this	happen.	It’s	like	walking	right	into	Hell	with	both	eyes wide	open. Don’t	talk	to	cops.	Don’t	sign	anything.	Don’t	agree	to	anything. Oh	but	you	say	you’d	end	up	in	jail?	You’ll	end	up	there	anyway regardless	of	what	they	tell	you,	only	what	they	don’t	tell	you	is	that	90% of	the	time,	if	you	keep	your	trap	shut,	the	prosecutor’ll	drop	the	case	for insufficient	evidence.	Most	evidence	comes	from	a	confession,	not	from what	the	cops	see	or	pick	up	on	site. Therefore	never	admit	to	a	thing	nor	sign	any	‘apology’	letter	or anything	else.	Note	that	they’ll	try	to	get	a	confession	before	taking	you down	to	the	station.	That’s	the	whole	point.   Myth		2:	You	Should	Always	Use	a	Fake	Name	or	ID	for	a	postal box.FALSE. We	briefly	mentioned	this	one	a	few	chapters	ago,	but	it	bears repeating.	Whether	you’re	using	a	UPS	Store	rental	box	or	the	post	office, never	ever	use	a	fake	ID	or	a	false	name.	If	one	package	of	yours	becomes compromised	then	you	could	be	looking	at	a	worse	situation	on	account that	they	will	know	you	lied.	It’ll	look	suspicious.	Probable	cause	is	much more	likely	a	given	if	they	know	you’re	a	liar.	Be	honest	with	non-law enforcement	types.	Honesty	and	silence	work	hand	in	hand	but	if	you lied	at	some	point	along	the	way	it’ll	be	hard	for	you	to	deny	any	bad intentions	with	the	rented	box. After	9 11	fake	IDs	get	you	into	heaps	of	trouble	these	days,	but doubly	so	for	ordering	darknet	stuff.	Now	they’re	linked	to	everything from	terrorism	to	identity	theft	to	Silk	Road-level	drug	empires.	So	in light	of	this,	use	your	real	name. MYTH	3:	Retrieve	the	package	quick!	Before	anyone	notices! ALSO	FALSE.	You	need	to	let	it	sit	for	a	couple	of	days	if	at	all possible.	This	is	because	the	package	is	still	‘hot’.	Granted,	police	don’t have	unlimited	funding	that	allows	them	to	survey	the	store	24 7 365 days	a	year,	even	for	a	small	fish	who	needs	a	break.	But	if	any	bust	is going	down	it’ll	likely	happen	fast. From	there	you	can	take	it	to	a	neutral	spot	and	open	it	somewhere safe.	Or	you	could	wait	a	few	days	later	to	add	that	extra	layer	of plausible	deniability	about	the	contents	of	the	package.	Again	this	goes back	to	our	opsec	mindset	and	living	out	that	opsec	mindset	day	to	day, hour	to	hour,	by	taking	action	beforehand.	That	is,	having	a	clear	plan ahead	of	time	as	well	as	a	Plan	B,	a	Plan	C,	etc.   Disclaimer:	Note	that	it’s	now	a	serious	felony	 at	least	in	the	U.S. 	to  resort	to	this	method.	9 11	changed	everything.	Your	mileage	may	vary.  Escaping	the	West! 	The	gauntlet’s	been	thrown	down.	The	challenge	issued.	You’ve	got about	six	months	to	cash	in	a	few	assets	to	get	your	money	and	your sorry-you-ever-married-a-Toronto-girl	hide	out	of	Dodge	for	good	or else	a	court	judgment	will	fly	down	like	a	bolt	of	lightning	from	Zeus	to your	arse	that’ll	leave	you	wailing	like	those	alley	cats	on	Bourbon	Street. You’ve	been	over	it	a	thousand	times.	If	you	don’t	hightail	it	you	just know	a	police	cruiser	will	be	along	at	any	moment	to	arrest	you	for whistling	a	copyrighted	tune	out	your	backside	-	and	then	you’ll	be seeing	red-blue	flashbacks	with	every	trip	to	the	john. Six	months.	Six	months. What’s	a	decent	guy	to	do?	How	do	you	start	a	brand	new	life abroad	with	only	a	U.S.	passport	and	less	than	a	hundred	grand	to	your name?	Where	do	you	go	and	how	do	you	prevent	a	tail?	Is	the	IRS’s	long reach	an	urban	myth?	Student	loans?	Child	support	for	that	illegal	you shagged	in	Phoenix? Extradition	laws	vary	but	you’ve	little	desire	to	learn	Thai	or Vietnamese	and	zero	will	to	fight	off	the	Zeta	cartel’s	pack	of	little	league brigade	in	Monterray.	You	need	an	escape	plan. Let’s	assume	you’ve	no	qualms	about	breaking	any	further	laws	at this	point.	Being	thrown	beyond	the	pearly	gates,	there’s	little	reason	to keep	playing	that	rusty	old	harp	so	you’ll	break	a	few	laws	on	the	way down	hoping	no	one	Really	Big	will	take	notice. The	first	thing	you	must	do	is	 change	 your	 identity.	There’s	a	few ways	to	go	about	it.	The	simplest	way	is	to	steal	someone	else’s.	Someone who	won’t	care.	Someone	who,	frankly,	isn’t	here	anymore.	A	baby.	Yep that’s	right,	a	baby	whose	gone	up	to	the	pearly	gates	but	on	the	way	up managed	to	drop	that	shiny	new	social	security	number	when	his	wings popped	out.   Thousands	of	babies	never	make	it	past	a	year	in	this	world	of	rain and	failure.	They	pass	on,	greener	pastures	and	all	that,	God	Bless	em, but	the	names	of	those	tykes	are	still	in	the	system.	Your	system.	The same	one	you’ve	been	paying	your	hard-earned	money	into	for	all	your life.	So	you	need	to	research	deceased	citizens	who	died	when	they	were young,	preferably	around	your	age.	This	is	the	one	time	in	all	of	human existence	when	Google	is	really	your	friend. You	get	the	number	and	that’s	the	number	you’ll	use	for	a	new driver’s	license,	passport,	bank	account	or	even	credit	union.	Combine that	with	and	off-shore	holding	corp	and	you	may	have	a	winning combination. It	may	be	that	the	deceased	is	in	fact	listed	in	the	Social	Security Administration’s	system	as	‘deceased’.	Not	always,	but	sometimes.	Your mission	is	to	keep	trying	until	you	get	one	that	isn’t	in	this	beast	of	a system.	Getting	a	‘new’	number	isn’t	easy.	The	brigands	that	run	that maniacal	ship	often	require	an	in-person	interview	before	they	give	it. Again,	not	always,	and	it’d	be	quite	embarrassing	to	explain	how	you	got by	the	last	30	years	without	one	or	a	driver’s	license. But	if	the	illegals	can	do	it,	so	can	you	IF	you’ve	got	nothing	to	lose. Nothing	is	set	in	stone	where	the	government	is	concerned	and	for	the record	they	catch	more	rule-followers	than	rule-breakers. That	said,	read	again	the	disclaimer	at	the	top	of	this	chapter. Sneaking	into	Canada	 even	if	you’re	Canadian	citizen 	without	stopping into	the	checkpoint	is	also	a	felony,	one	that’s	punishable	by	a	$5000 dollar	fine.   Sniffer	Dogs	&	Cash When	going	through	customs	checkpoints,	keep	in	mind	that	there are	dogs	that	are	trained	to	sniff	out	money.	Some	dogs	are	gifted	that way.	Some	of	them	can	even	sniff	out	cancer.	People	not	living	near	the border	think	these	dogs	are	out	all	the	damn	time.	It	isn’t	true.	I	live	in Canada	and	can	tell	you	I’ve	seen	a	dog	twice,	both	times	on	sunny	bright flower	days	and	happy	as	a	clam.	But	on	a	rainy	day?	Here’s	a	little	police secret:	cops	hate	working	in	the	rain	just	as	much	as	sniffer	dogs. State	troopers	in	particular	would	rather	sit	in	their	police	cruiser and	wait	till	the	rain	stops	on	the	interstate	from	say,	New	Orleans	to Phoenix,	to	resume	ticket	writing	or	searches.	That’s	why	if	you’re	a smuggler	or	just	a	guy	who	likes	to	bring	a	little	reefer	along	on	a	long beach	trip,	you	leave	on	a	rainy	day.	Same	with	customs.	On	some	days, the	rain	and	snow	fly	in	 sideways.	Can	you	picture	a	cop	 any	kind  enjoying	writing	out	a	stack	of	tickets	that	way?	I	can’t. Back	to	sniffer	dogs. Snoopy	can	separate	scents	so	hiding	cash	or	drugs	in	mustard	isn’t going	to	work.	His	big	wet	nose	can	smell	weed	even	under	your	nails	to say	nothing	about	clothes.	Most	of	these	dogs	though	are	trained	to	sniff out	the	serious	drugs,	drugs	like	heroin,	MDMA,	cocaine	and	every	other drug	imaginable.	And	cash.	Oh	yes.	Cash	has	quite	a	strong	scent.	Take out	a	couple	grand	from	your	bank	account	and	when	you	get	it	home, take	a	long	whiff	of	it.	It’s	potent	stuff	and	I	read	one	account	that	said there’s	traces	of	cocaine	on	every	$100	dollar	bill	in	the	US. A	sealed	ziploc	bag	will	get	you	through	50%	of	the	time	though, provided	the	bag	is	washed	thoroughly	and	any	residue	on	the	outside has	been	rinsed	away.	The	problem	here	is	that	weed,	like	cash,	gives	off a	very	potent	odor	and	given	enough	time	the	scent	will	permeate through	the	plastic.	So	you	must	do	this	within	hours	of	travel.	The longer	it’s	in	there	the	more	risky	it	gets	that	the	smell	has	permeated through	the	seal	to	reach	the	dog’s	wet	nose. One	thing	to	remember	though:   It’s	that	the	primary	function	of	a	sniffer	dog	is	to	act	as	a	legal	prop, regardless	of	what	you’re	carrying.	Yes,	a	legal	prop. Let’s	say	you	get	profiled. You’re	a	twenty-something,	college	aged,	black-skinned,	black- haired	tattooed-up	probable	drug	user.	You	get	pulled	over	on	some pretense	to	secondary	inspection	coming	into	Canada.	You	refuse consent	to	any	search.	The	cop	brings	a	drug	dog	and	that	dog	ALERTS  according	to	the	cop 	like	you’ve	got	Cheech	and	Chong	hidden	in	the trunk	with	100	pounds	of	coke.	Now	the	cop	has	a	probable	cause	for	a warrantless	search. “The	dog	barked	so	he	must	be	a	terrorist!”	 though	they	don’t generally	alert	by	barking . Regardless,	it’s	almost	always	the	officer	who	targets	you	in	95%	of the	cases	and	it	almost	never	matters	whether	the	dog	can	smell anything	or	not,	just	that	the	dog	was	present	and	the	cop	“testifies”	that it	alerted.	This	is	true	with	cash,	drugs	or	the	preggo	alien	in	the	back seat	from	Men	in	Black.	Doesn’t	matter	what	it	is. Also,	you	don’t	legally	have	to	wait	for	them	to	bring	the	drug	dog because	doing	so	would	constitute	a	detainment	-	which	they	cannot	do unless	they	are	arresting	you	on	specific	grounds.	If	they	threaten	you with	it	you	should	ask	if	you’re	being	detained.	When	they	inevitably	say “no,”	that’s	your	cue	to	leave.	Just	make	sure	that	any	other	issues	 like	a speeding	ticket 	are	already	taken	care	of	so	that	the	cop	doesn’t	go	back to	his her	car	and	just	sit	on	your	driver’s	license	until	the	dog	shows	up. 	Sailboats Sailboats	can	be	an	effective	way	to	disappear,	with	a	few	caveats. Do	you	hold	a	US	passport?	If	you	do	then	why	do	you	need	someone’s permission	to	leave	the	coast?	Hire	a	skipper	you	trust	 and	a	first	mate!  if	you	can’t	sail	and	just	need	to	get	from	point	A	to	point	B.	Blue	water boats	you	can	buy	on	the	cheap	 relatively	speaking 	for	about	20	grand. You’d	want	to	go	someplace	with	a	less	than	reliable	immigration	control system,	obviously.	A	place	without	an	extradition	treaty	with	the	U.S. Laos? It’s	your	port	of	call	but	sailing	around	southwest	Asia	is	about	as low-key	as	a	guy	can	get	without	kicking	off	a	new	career	as	a	Tibetan   monk.	The	downside	is	that	you	can	get	a	little	too	comfortable	in	other places	like	the	Mediterranean	and	end	up	exposing	your	new	identity	to first	world	officials	and	their	beast	systems.	You	don’t	want	to	end	up	in someplace	that’s	quickly	turning	into	a	shadow	of	the	USA. Are	you	broke? Don’t	sweat	it.	It’s	mostly	a	mental	barrier	which,	if	you	get	to	a	safe harbor	somewhere	abroad,	you’ll	see	it	never	was	a	barrier	at	all.	If	you lack	cold	hard	cash	and	need	to	flee	with	little	in	the	way	of	records being	assigned	to	your	hot	name,	lots	of	boats	lack	enough	crewmen	to do	the	job.	They’ve	got	their	own	safety	to	worry	about.	If	they	not enough	men,	they	don’t	sail.	They’ll	take	you	in	if	you	ask	with	a	smile. ‘Hop	aboard!’	they’ll	say	after	you’ve	promised	to	pay	for	the	cheap beer.	You	can	forget	about	getting	paid	like	the	rest,	though	they’ll probably	throw	you	some	scraps.	That’s	good	enough.	The	real	hurdle	is to	hop	on	a	boat	that	won’t	create	a	paper	trail	 as	in	no	centralized system .	Somewhere	that	doesn’t	assign	you	a	number	to	track	you	to your	dying	breath.	A	place	like	Cambodia	now	that	I	think	about	it.	If you’ve	ever	seen	Cambodian	border	checkpoints	then	you	know	how	lax they	can	be. Either	way,	be	sure	to	record	your	adventure	on	camera:	Boarding	a ship,	working	as	a	crew	member,	adventure	unknown.     “Do	not	go	gentle	into	that	good	night.

Darknet How	to	Stay	Anonymous	Online A	Beginner’s	Guide   Introduction  “If	you	want	total	security,	go	to	prison.	There	you’re	fed,	clothed, given	medical	care	and	so	on.	The	only	thing	lacking	…	is	freedom”	- Dwight	Eisenhower Friend,	My	name	is	Lance	and	I	am	the	author	of	this	book	on encryption	security	and	anonymity.	I	have	been	an	encryption	enthusiast as	well	as	writing	about	security	in	general	for	over	a	decade.	I	have	been a	member	of	many	security	and	encryption	forums	since	the	1980s,	and have	been	involved	with	computer	technology	long	before	that	 yeah	I know	that	makes	me	an	old	geezer .	But	if	there	is	a	security	or encryption	program	out	there,	I	have	used	it	and	experienced	its strengths	and	its	shortcomings	and	 more	than	likely 	attracted	the attention	of	the	authorities	 more	on	that	later . I	was	there	when	PGP	first	arrived	on	the	scene	and	when	Napster was	the	dominant	method	of	p2p	trading.	I	have	used	most	versions	of PGP,	Drivecrypt,	Bestcrypt,	Truecrypt,	Tor,	Freenet,	I2P	and	every	spinoff and	copycat	you	can	think	of. Let’s	face	it.	Today	we	are	constantly	bombarded	with	news	by	the media	of	those	trawled,	raided,	arrested,	imprisoned,	tortured	and humiliated	because	they	weren’t	necessarily	breaking	any	law	but because	they	did	not	know	the	difference	between	privacy	and anonymity.	I	waited	and	waited	for	some	smart	hacker	to	put	something up	on	Amazon	to	prevent	this	from	happening. Didn’t	happen. So	I	decided	it	would	be	me.	I	stepped	up	to	the	plate	pronto,	though truth	be	told	I	had	been	meaning	to	put	together	some	of	the rudimentary	elements	of	encryption	security	in	such	a	way	that	a	person without	any	knowledge	of	security	encryption	or	anonymity	could become	familiar. It	is	not	a	particularly	advanced	book,	but	rather	a	portal	from which	a	beginner	can	step	through	with	the	assurance	of	anonymity when	he	is	online.	To	that	end	I	present	a	few	tools	 mostly	free 	at	your   disposal	to	accomplish	this	lofty	goal.	If	you’re	an	advanced	user,	you	just might	learn	some	hidden	vulnerabilities	in	your	favorite	anonymity program.A	PhD	in	computer	science	is	not	required	to	use	encryption. Neither	are	you	required	to	be	a	programmer	of	any	sort.	You	only	have to	know	your	way	around	your	operating	system	and	be	able	to	follow directions	to	the	letter.	If	you	know	how	to	install	an	operating	system, or	for	that	matter,	any	application	at	all,	then	you	can	safely	use encryption	programs	to	preserve	your	own	digital	data	and	safety.   Privacy	and	Anonymity If	you’re	like	one	of	the	many	billions	of	people	on	the	planet	who use	the	internet	to	surf	the	net,	check	email,	download	programs	or	do any	kind	of	online	work,	then	you	probably	know	there	are	risks associated	with	being	a	habitual	internet	user.	That’s	just	how	it	is.	But	it is	not	 your	fault	that	there	are	so	many	latent	traps	and	pitfalls associated	with	online	spelunking,	in	whatever	form	that	may	be. It	is	just	a	fact	of	life	that	the	Good	lives	alongside	the	Evil	in	our lives,	offline	or	online.	This	book	is	meant	as	a	beginner’s	guide	to distinguish	between	the	Good	and	the	Evil,	and	to	conceal	your	online footprint.	To	be	a	ghost	on	the	internet,	that	is	our	aim. This	book	is	not	necessarily	for	the	advanced,	such	as	those	who teach	computer	science	courses,	but	rather	it	is	for	those	who	would	like to	learn	to	surf	without	compromising	their	identity,	or	having	their online	habits	tracked	24 7,	and	who	engage	in	some	risky	speech	against their	government	once	in	a	blue	moon.	It	is	also	for	those	who	might	not know	about	some	of	the	little	known	vulnerabilities	in	their	favorite “anonymous”	software	programs.	In	the	end,	you	just	might	learn	there is	a	vast	difference	between	“anonymity”	and	“privacy“. Let’s	start	with	the	basics.	I’ll	just	put	this	out	there	so	you	know	the weight	of	the	privacy	situation	entirely.	As	of	2014,	you	are	always	being tracked	on	the	internet	in	just	about	every	way	you	can	imagine.	Search engines,	cookie	managers,	download	managers	and	everything	you	do online	has	the	potential	to	make	someone,	somewhere,	a	LOT	of	money. Most	of	the	time,	this	is	because	laser-targeted	advertising	is	extremely profitable.	The	more	they	know	about	your	habits,	the	more	money	they make.How? Simple.	If	they	know	more	about	your	fears,	your	likes	and	dislikes, and	how	and	where	you	spend	your	money,	they	can	deliver	targeted advertising	to	you.	Laser	targeted	advertising.	That	means	more	power for	them,	less	for	you.	Now,	advertising	in	and	of	itself	is	not	such	a	bad   thing,	but	neither	is	a	loaded	gun	sitting	on	top	of	the	fridge.	By	itself	it can	do	nothing.	However	it	is	the	method	of	execution	that	defines	its usefulness. If	you	type	any	medical	search	term	into	a	major	search	engine	such as	Google,	Yahoo,	or	Bing,	soon	enough	you’ll	start	to	see	targeted	ads.	If you	search	for	“how	to	cure	a	hangover”,	you	might	not	see	anything right	away,	since	hangovers	generally	don’t	last	that	long.	However	if	you were	to	type	“how	to	cure	herpes”,	you	will	likely	be	typing	variations	of that	sentence	over	the	course	of	a	few	weeks	or	months	since	it	is	not	an easy	condition	to	treat.	Eventually	you	would	see	pay-per-click	ads	start to	manifest	themselves	in	your	search	engine	results	in	the	top	corners. These	ads	might	be	selling	all	manner	of	snake-oil	remedies	for	the	cure to	herpes,	or	they	might	be	referrals	to	medical	specialists. The	bottom	line	is	this:	why	do	they	think	you	have	this	disease? The	answer	is	because	you	repeatedly	typed	it	into	the	search	engine over	the	course	of	days months.	Over	the	course	of	a	year,	how	much	do you	reveal	about	your	medical	history	and	identity	to	your	favorite search	engine?	Do	you	ever	wish	you	could	keep	this	information private?They	like	to	“bubble”	your	identity	based	on	how	you	search:	the time	between	searches,	the	time	of	day,	your	country,	your	area.	With	the help	of	a	very	specific	item	in	your	internet	portfolio	called	an	IP	address, they	can	even	find	out	where	you	live,	who	your	ISP	is,	and	chart	a	course right	to	your	very	doorstep.	With	the	help	of	Google	Maps,	and	a	whole plethora	of	other	mapping	applications,	this	can	potentially	lead	to	some very	annoying	and or	embarrassing	situations.	Do	you	think	this information	would	be	valuable	to	door-to-door	salesmen?	Or	perhaps	a company	that	sends	out	mailed	advertisements?	Of	course. But	first	things	first,	let’s	briefly	say	a	word	about	the	difference between	privacy	and	anonymity	since	many	would-be	geeks	confuse	the two.	They	are	not	the	same	thing.	Not	by	a	long	shot. 	Anonymity	&	Privacy	-	The	Differences While	we	shouldn’t	waste	time	splitting	hairs	here,	it	is	probably	a good	idea	to	distinguish	between	the	terms	“privacy”	and	“anonymity”. The	two	terms	are	not	really	as	interchangeable	as	you	think.	Let’s	say   that	you	have	Firefox	running,	and	you	are	working	from	home	with	a direct	connection	to	your	ISP.	You	don’t	want	anyone	knowing	what you’re	doing,	so	you	select	the	“private	mode”	tab	in	Firefox.	This disables	cookies	and	inhibits	the	ability	to	store	any	remembered websites	 unless	you	choose	to	do	so . However	this	privacy	only	goes	so	far.	It	does	nothing	for	the	IP address	problem	we	discussed	earlier.	Search	engines	still	see	it,	as	does your	internet	service	provider.	Both	entities	know	which	sites	you	visit and	for	how	long,	based	on	your	IP	address.	In	short,	they	can	see everything.	Your	wife	can’t,	however.	That	is	why	the	privacy	mode	in web	browsers	were	built:	to	keep	the	sites	you	visit	private	and	out	of the	public	view. Is	this	privacy	enough	for	your	needs?	You	certainly	have	some	level of	privacy,	but	anonymity	is	another	matter.	Anonymity	takes	privacy	to an	entirely	different	level,	where	the	IP	address,	and	thus	anything	you do	online,	is	extinguished	like	a	wet	cloth	to	a	candle’s	flame	through layer	after	layer	of	digital	barriers.	If	you	want	to	have	privacy,	use Firefox’s	private	mode,	or	use	a	VPN	service	provider	in	conjunction	with this	feature	to	ensure	no	one	else	in	your	household	can	see	your	online footprints.	This	assumes	that	they	do	not	have	access	to	your	laptop	or PC. If	that’s	the	case,	it’s	game	over. If	on	the	other	hand	you	want	anonymity,	there	are	several	tools	are your	disposal,	one	of	which	is	to	use	the	Tor	network.	In	doing	so,	you will	guarantee	yourself	strict	anonymity	and	be	assured	of	simple privacy	as	well,	provided	you	don’t	do	something	stupid	like	blurt	out enough	info	 on	a	forum,	for	instance 	that	narrows	you	down	to	a	city	or state.   The	Anonymous	Tor	Network “If	money	is	your	hope	for	independence	you	will	never	have	it.	The only	real	security	that	a	man	will	have	in	this	world	is	a	reserve	of knowledge,	experience,	and	ability.” Henry	Ford Every	Internet	Service	Provider	assigns	an	IP	address	to	every	user who	logs	into	their	network.	From	there,	you	can	connect	to	the	millions of	websites,	newsgroups,	and	online	applications	that	you	enjoy	most.	IP addresses	are	like	phone	numbers.	They	tell	your	computer	where	to connect	and	send	packets	of	data.	They	need	this	information	to	not	only send	data,	such	as	html	code,	but	also	flash	code	so	you	can	watch Youtube	videos.	These	are	targeted	with	ads,	too.	And	if	you	bring	up task	manager	in	Windows,	you	can	see	Flash	player	running.	Do	you think	Adobe	is	not	sending	data	back	to	them	about	your	habits?	Let’s continue. So,	if	the	security	of	online	privacy	involves	concealing	the	IP address	between	two	computers,	how	do	those	two	computers	talk	to each	other	without	a	direct	connection?	If	you	hide	the	phone	number, how	do	you	make	the	call?	The	answer	is	simple:	you	have	someone	else in	another	country	dial	the	number	for	you.	This	is	the	first	step	to	being anonymous	online.	Do	not	use	the	IP	address	 yours 	as	a	direct connection.	Hire	a	middle	man	to	do	the	talking	for	you.	How	is	this possible?	There	are	several	ways.	You	can	use	the	free	online	program called	Tor,	which	acts	a	relay	point	between	you	and	your	online destination.	There	are	also	paid	services	called	VPNs	 virtual	private networks 	as	well	as	other	anonymous	networks	like	Freenet	and	I2P, but	we’ll	get	into	the	specifics	of	those	later. First	and	foremost,	let’s	talk	about	Tor. It	is	the	quintessential	solution	to	online	privacy	since	it	masks	your IP	address.	The	websites	you	connect	to	have	no	way	of	knowing	where you	live,	which	ISP	you	are	using,	or	what	your	browsing	habits	are. When	you	connect	to	the	Tor	network,	you	are	establishing	a	conduit   whereby	if	you	connect	to	a	website	 Google	for	instance ,	it	connects through	several	layers	of	IP	addresses,	or	“onion	layers”	to	reach	its destination.	 You	 send	 out	 a	 message,	 email,	 or	 some	 type	 of communication.	The	message	then	goes	to	Bob,	Jane	and	Herb,	then finally	reaches	the	end	of	the	line…your	favorite	webpage.	It	routes	data  backwards forwards 	through	an	onion	later	of	IP	addresses,	so	that	no one	adversary	can	see	who	sent	what	without	very	significant	resources. As	you	have	probably	guessed,	there	is	a	small	speed	hit	in	doing this.	In	order	to	hide	your	IP	address,	several	“hops”	or	intermediaries, have	to	be	jumped	through.	Like	portals.	Without	going	into	too	much technical	detail,	let’s	just	say	that	these	hops	serve	a	very	valuable purpose:	to	keep	your	private	communications	out	of	the	hands	of	those that	intend	to	snoop	on	you.	Since	your	IP	address	changes	every	time you	login	to	the	Tor	network,	they	can’t	“bubble”	you	effectively	and target	you	with	ads	because	you	look	like	a	different	person	from	a foreign	country	to	them	each	time	you	login.	The	Tor	relay	will	end	up giving	you	a	different	country	to	“pop-out”	from	with	each	session	of your	Tor	browser,	thus	making	it	impossible	to	know	your	origin	or where	you	will	go	next. Let’s	examine	an	analogy	between	Tor	and	regular	internet	usage. You’re	sitting	in	your	living	room	browsing	anonymously	via	the	Tor network.	Your	wife	on	the	other	hand	is	sitting	in	the	kitchen	on	her Macbook,	browsing	without	Tor.	You	might	wonder	if	her	browsing habits	break	your	own	anonymity.	They	don’t…up	to	a	point.	While	your isp	doesn’t	know	what	you	are	doing	online,	they	certainly	do	in	regards to	your	wife. Imagine	yourself	driving	down	Main	Street	in	a	Mercedes	with tinted	windows.	No	one	can	peer	inside	to	see	what	you	are	doing	at	the stoplight.	Not	even	the	cops.	Your	wife	on	the	other	hand	has	non-tinted windows.	People	can	glance	over	without	any	effort	and	tell	if	she	is smoking	a	cigarette,	listening	to	her	iPod	or	talking	on	her	phone.	You are	anonymous.	She	is	not.	The	ISP	along	with	any	websites	she	visits	can see	everything	she	does	online.	They	can’t	see	what	you	are	doing, however. Firefox	 and	many	other	browsers 	talk	to	different	hosts,	with	the router	acting	as	the	traffic	cop.	An	example:   Your	machine:	Port	X,	Machine	A	 Tor:	all	encrypted	traffic 	Your wife:	Port	Y,	Machine	B	 without	Tor:	all	visible	traffic  It’s	like	shooting	fish	in	a	barrel,	and	for	the	NSA,	even	easier	than that.	This	same	concept	also	applies	with	other	things	you	may	do	on your	machine	while	using	Tor.	If	you	use	BitTorrent,	your	ISP	can	still see	what	you	do	on	the	P2P	network	even	if	you	are	running	Tor simultaneously.	But	it	cannot	see	the	contents	of	the	Tor	network. Thus,	don’t	do	anything	on	your	P2P	network	that	you	wouldn’t want	your	ISP	to	know	about.	Tor	however	is	a	different	story	since	they cannot	see	what	is	going	on	between	Tor	relays.	For	all	intents	and purposes,	Tor	is	like	a	cloak	of	invisibility	that	shields	you	from	the	sight of	all	onlookers,	unless	you	have	accidentally	ripped	a	hole	in	the	cloak  i.e.	turned	on	javascript .	If	you	are	thinking,	“Wow,	it	might	be	cool	to run	BitTorrent	through	Tor	so	I	won’t	get	sued”.	A	nice	goal,	except BitTorrent	devs	aren’t	falling	over	themselves	to	implement	this	feature with	Tor,	and	the	Tor	network	can’t	really	handle	the	bandwidth	anyway. You’ll	just	make	everyone	else	miserable	by	downloading	those	720p Blu-Ray	rips	you	can	easily	get	from	Usenet	 and	with	SSL,	you’re	not likely	to	get	sued. 	It	might	be	prudent	to	spell	out	some	of	the	best practices	of	using	the	Tor	network	should	you	decide	to	use	it.	First, although	the	Tor	package	comes	with	a	preconfigured	Firefox	browser, there	are	still	some	rules	you	should	follow	that	might	not	be	apparent. 	 Never	give	any	compromising	information	on	the	Tor	network that	could	be	used	to	identify	you.	This	means	using	your	credit	card for	purchases,	accessing	your	bank	account,	or	logging	into	a	social media	site	like	Facebook.	Card	transaction	are	traceable.	Tor,	in	fact, may	even	result	in	flagging	transactions	done	via	a	tor	exit	node. Never	mix	browsers.	Don’t	use	the	same	browser	you	browse every	day	to	Facebook	and	your	ISP	email	as	you	do	to	access	the Tor	network.	Super	cookies	can	give	away	which	sites	you	visit outside	of	Tor	and	can	lead	to	a	correlation	attack	on	your identity IP	address. Always	disable	Javascript.	The	reason	for	this	is	that	exploits can	be	utilized	to	reveal	your	IP	address	through	using	flash.	Flash   videos	such	as	those	on	Youtube	only	work	if	this	is	enabled.	After installation	of	Tor,	ensure	that	the	settings	in	the	NoScript	plugin are	ON	and	not	off	by	default	in	the	plugins	options	screen. Install	a	bare	minimum	of	browser	plugins.	You	want	to	be	as vanilla	as	everyone	else.	Too	many	addins,	plugins,	games,	etc.,	can act	as	an	identity	beacon—fonts	you	use,	time	of	day	you	use	certain features,	can	all	be	used	to	build	a	profile	on	you.	BE	VANILLA. Disable	any	automatic	updates	in	the	browser’s	options	tab. This	also	includes	updates	for	any	addons.	You	should	update manually,	not	automatically.   Tor	and	Torrents  A	word	about	torrents	and	the	Tor	network.	It	might	seem	on	the surface	that	running	your	torrent	client	through	the	Tor	network	would be	an	obviously	beneficial	idea.	After	all,	if	Tor	can	cloak	your	regular Firefox	downloads,	surely	it	can	do	the	same	with	torrents	too,	right? Well,	yes	and	no.	Yes,	you	could	route	your	traffic	through	Tor	using	your favorite	torrent	client,	however	this	is	not	a	good	idea	for	several reasons.The	first	is	that	Tor	was	never	developed	to	withstand	the	kind	of punishing	traffic	bandwidth	that	usually	comes	from	torrenting. Secondly,	 most	 torrent	 clients	 like	 uTorrent,	 BitSpirit,	 and libTorrent	are	not	coded	properly	to	make	you	anonymous	on	the	Tor network.	They	often	will	ignore	their	socks	proxy	settings	since	UDP protocol	is	heavily	involved	with	torrenting,	and	will	send	your	real	IP address	to	the	tracker,	thereby	defeating	the	purpose	of	using	Tor completely.	Tor	in	fact	still	does	what	it	is	coded	to	do:	send	whatever packets	anonymously	through	the	Tor	network	to	your	destination. However,	it	sends	your	IP	address	within	the	torrent	tracker	right	along with	it…anonymously. It	would	be	like	sending	a	secret	message	in	an	envelope	directly	to the	person	you	are	attempting	to	hide	that	message	from.	This	is	not	a problem	with	the	Tor	application,	but	rather	the	way	torrent	trackers	are coded.	The	only	fix	would	be	if	the	torrent	application	coders	themselves rewrote	their	applications	to	work	harmoniously	with	the	Tor	network, something	they	probably	will	not	get	around	to	doing	anytime	soon	 and much	to	the	glee	of	Tor	developers . 	Tor	Onion	Sites One	of	the	most	secretive	elements	of	the	Tor	network	is	the existence	of	Tor	Onion	websites,	which	are	pseudo	top	level	domains acting	as	anonymous	hidden	services.	In	other	words,	they	are	hidden	in that	they	can	only	be	accessed	by	the	Tor	users	themselves	residing   within	the	Tor	network,	rather	from	the	open	web.	The	motive	for	the creation	of	such	hidden	sites	is	so	that	the	admin	of	the	site	as	well	as those	accessing	such	sites	cannot	be	traced.	Since	onion	sites	that	are based	on	the	hidden	service	protocol	cannot	be	accessed	from	the regular	internet,	the	address	of	the	onion	site	you	are	looking	for	must	be known.	You	can	connect	to	an	onion	website	on	Tor	just	as	you	can	a regular	website,	by	typing	the	address	into	the	address	bar.	For	example, you	might	want	to	go	to	Tor2Web,	in	which	case	the	address	is: http:  tor2web.org  A	warning	about	tor2web:	it	is	intended	to	offer	one-sided	security, that	is,	to	protect	the	identity	of	those	publishing	content	on	Tor,	not those	browsing	it.	If	you	want	to	be	secure	while	browsing	you’ll	need	to install	the	Tor	application.	Convenience	and	speed	should	always	take	a back	seat	where	security	is	concerned. Needless	to	say,	a	hidden	network	would	not	stay	completely	benign of	nefarious	webmasters	if	it	wasn’t	indeed	anonymous.	To	that	end,	the Hidden	Wiki	was	developed,	a	singular	.onion	page	with	a	wikipedia-like structure	outlining	in	explicit	detail	everything	from	political	activists	to every	conceivable	criminal	group	imaginable.	There	are	links	to hundreds	of	various	.onion	sites	dealing	with	everything	from	how	to obtain	illegal	drugs,	warez	operations,	virus	creation,	anonymous	use	of Bitcoins,	illegal	pornography,	hacked	Paypal	accounts	and	even	how	to hire	contract	killers.	Needless	to	say,	some	of	these	sites	need	to	be	taken with	a	grain	of	salt. Be	aware	of	your	own	country’s	laws	regarding	what	can	legally	be obtained.	What	goes	around	in	Amsterdam	or	Japan	may	not	fly	straight with	the	authorities	in	the	USA.	Remember	that	information	that	exists	in Deep	Web	is	just	that:	information.	By	itself,	the	information	can	do nothing.	Words	are	just	rearranged	letters	to	get	your	point	across. Pictures	and	videos	are	simply	ones	and	zeros	moving	across	your display.	It	is	what	they	are	eventually	used	for	that	define	their	ethics. At	the	core	of	it,	the	Hidden	Wiki	is	not	terribly	dissimilar	from	any run-of-the-mill	black	market	operation	offline.	It	just	so	happens	to	be online,	and	accessible	by	anyone	with	a	little	search	engine	sleuthing capability.	Not	all	of	the	information	in	the	Deep	Web	is	used	for nefarious	purposes.	Like	Freenet,	there	are	a	lot	of	different	sites	that   concentrate	on	exposing	human	rights	abuse,	political	corruption,	and government	scandals	involving	high-level	politicians.	In	the	end,	it	is what	you	do	with	the	data	that	determines	the	criminal	element. 	Testing	your	IP	address	visibility	on	Tor When	you	have	installed	Tor,	you	may	want	to	test	your	IP	address to	see	if	it	really	is	broadcasting	your	Tor	IP	and	not	your	real	IP	address. If	you	installed	the	default	package	of	Tor,	then	Tor	will	show	you	the	IP you	are	broadcasting	as	your	start	page.	If	you	want	to	check	it	yourself, then	go	to	http:  whatismyipaddress.com . This	will	show	you	not	only	your	IP	address,	but	your	internet service	provider	as	well,	and	where	it	is	located	on	google	maps.	It	will also	show	city	and	country.	When	you	are	using	Tor,	you	will	see	a different	city country	than	the	one	you	currently	reside	in.	Mark	down what	your	IP	address	is	outside	of	Tor,	and	check	this	site	when	your launch	Tor	if	you’re	especially	paranoid	 I	am .   VPNs  The	last	few	years	have	seen	an	emergence	of	many	different	VPN  virtual	private	network 	providers	with	server	farms	in	just	about	every country.	What	a	VPN	does	is	somewhat	similar	to	what	the	Tor	network does.	It	sends	a	different	IP	address	to	your	destination,	whether	that	is	a webpage,	usenet	provider,	or	webhost.	There	are	some	pros	and	cons	to this.	First,	it	is	not	free.	A	VPN	will	cost	the	same	amount	you	would	get for	Usenet	service:	about	ten	dollars	per	month.	This	amount	fluctuates from	provider	to	provider.	Sometimes	it	is	a	little	more,	sometimes	a	bit less,	but	all	providers	have	you	login	to	their	service	the	same	way	you would	an	ISP.	Most	of	the	configuration	is	automatic	and	doesn’t	require any	technical	wizardry	to	setup.	Five	minutes,	give	or	take. Another	major	difference	is	that	while	Tor	provides	anonymity,	and is	free,	a	VPN	will	provide	you	with	 privacy,	but	not	necessarily anonymity.	This	is	because	the	middle	man,	the	VPN	in	this	case,	knows your	real	IP	address.	They	have	to	know	this	information	in	order	to forward	your	requests.	The	VPN	service	is	built	upon	a	different technology	than	Tor.	It	is	built	for	 speed	and	 stability.	Torrenting,	you say?	Knock	yourself	out. Further,	let’s	say	that	you’re	a	Chinese	dissident.	You	don’t	like	the way	your	country	is	headed	in	regards	to	free	speech	and	human	rights. You	can’t	exactly	criticize	the	Chinese	government	in	the	Saturday	paper can	you?	Of	course	not.	So	what	is	a	good,	law-abiding	dissident	to	do? You	build	a	news	website	using	a	VPN	in	another	country	and	relay	your dissent	through	that	internet	portal.	You	don’t	necessarily	have	to	build	a website.	You	could	simply	setup	your	newsreader	to	access	Usenet	via the	VPN	connection.	In	that	way,	the	Chinese	government	could	not determine	the	origin	of	any	anti-governmental	messages	through	the	use of	the	IP	address	 unless	of	course	you	hint	of	incriminating	personal information	that	narrows	down	your	location . You	can	also	access	forbidden	places	by	the	Chinese	government, such	as	Facebook,	Skype,	private	chat	rooms	and	even	Usenet.	The   reason	these	kinds	of	places	are	blocked	by	the	Great	Firewall	of	China	is precisely	because	they	are	fertile	ground	for	free	speech	enthusiasts. While	this	may	sound	like	an	easy	way	to	circumvent	the	Chinese	police, remember	that	most	VPN	providers	offer	connections	through	almost every	civilized	country	you	can	think	of.	If	you	are	a	Chinese	dissident,	I wouldn’t	connect	to	a	VPN	located	in	China,	but	rather	Canada	or perhaps	a	country	hostile	to	China.	Most	VPN	providers	offer	a	selection of	many	servers	to	choose	from	in	which	to	route	your	messages	and traffic.On	that	note,	let’s	talk	a	bit	about	law	enforcement	and	VPNs.	Many in	the	past	have	erroneously	thought	that	a	VPN	carried	with	it	a	strong dose	of	anonymity,	similar	to	what	Tor	offered.	It	doesn’t	quite	stack	up that	way.	A	VPN	service	offers	privacy,	not	anonymity,	as	we	stated.	They do	not	route	your	data	through	intermediaries	the	way	Tor	does. Depending	on	which	VPN	you	choose,	you	could	end	up	with	one	in Switzerland	who	will	not	cave	to	anyone’s	request	for	subscriber information	outside	of	Sweden.	On	the	other	hand,	you	might	have	a	US based	provider	who	will	bow	down	to	the	whims	of	any	judge’s	warrant for	subscriber	information	in	a	New	York	minute. While	most	are	perfectly	safe	for	purposes	of	torrents	and	the	like, one	should	think	twice	about	using	a	VPN	in	a	western	country	for felonious	offenses,	as	they	will	most	likely	give	your	name	and	address up	to	law	enforcement	in	order	to	stave	off	any	fines	and or	trouble	by the	government.	There	are	of	course	ways	around	this,	such	as	not	using your	credit	card	and	paying	anonymously,	however	sometimes	it	is better	not	to	use	a	VPN	at	all	for	those	kinds	of	purposes	 think	hackers, smuggling,	illicit	banned	goods,	drugs	etc .	Vpns	have	never	been	built with	anonymity	in	mind.	Tread	carefully.   Tor	Relays  “Who	can	you	trust?	Nobody,	cause	nobody	wants	you	here.”  	Those	words,	uttered	by	Sean	Connery	in	The	Untouchables,	are	as appropriate	for	darknet	discussions	as	they	are	for	the	mob.	But	let’s	be realistic	for	a	moment.	There	are,	as	you	read	this,	ten	thousand	more organized	crime	syndicates	spread	out	over	the	net	than	you	will	ever come	across	in	the	“Deep	Web”.	They	run	the	same	secure,	enterprise- grade	software	that	Wall	Street	banks	use	and	cloak	themselves	better than	Ringwraiths.	No	outside	eyes	peer	in	unless	the	alphabet	agency	has a	guy	on	the	inside.	Cartels	like	these	rake	in	millions	in	drugs,	arms, counterfeit	pharmaceuticals,	mercs	and	excel	at	human	trafficking. The	Deep	Web	is	similar,	but	not	that	similar.	But	those	who	are	for outlawing	it	completely	are	really	advocating	for	more	control	rather than	for	less	crime,	as	was	the	case	with	Prohibition.	They	claim	the negatives	outweigh	the	positives.	Let’s	say	a	guy	in	North	Korea	gets curious	as	to	why	his	government	is	censoring	information	from	him.	He wants	to	know	why.	So	he	uses	Tor	to	access	websites	blocked	by	the North	Korean	regime	 Facebook	for	instance,	to	hook	up	with	an	uncle who	may	have	escaped	to	S.	Korea .	And	he	does	so	anonymously.	So	that is	one	positive	trait. But	this,	they	say,	does	not	outweigh	the	child	porn,	contract	killers and	heroin	runners.	They	say,	people	aren’t	going	to	Tor	to	discuss	ways of	avoiding	the	mine	fields	on	the	border	and	neither	are	they	discussing the	latest	enlightenment	from	Tibet.	Yes,	anonymity	has	its	meritorious moments,	but	someone	who	wants	to	hide	almost	always	does	so	at	the circumvention	of	the	law.	There	are	only	so	many	North	Koreans,	after all. They	assume,	quite	wrongly,	that	those	criminals	engaged	in	the above	activities	would	cease	to	exist.	They	are	wrong.	These	were around	before	Tor	and	the	Deep	Web	were	even	a	spark	in	the developer’s	minds,	and	will	thrive	regardless	of	what	government   regulations	are	cooked	up	by	congress	critters.	The	same	as	it	was	during Prohibition. 	Hazards	of	running	a	Tor	Exit	Node In	2012,	an	Austrian	named	William	Weber,	an	IT	admin,	was arrested	for	running	Tor	servers	that	route	anonymous	traffic	over	the Tor	network.	The	charge?	Distributing	illegal	images.	Police	detected	the data	coming	off	one	of	the	nodes	he	ran.	A	police	raid	ensued.	Searched his	home.	Confiscated	his	Xbox,	iPods,	all	drives	and	miscellaneous electronics	and	even	his	legally	owned	firearms.	The	court	order revealed	one	of	the	Tor	exit	nodes	 he	ran	seven 	was	transporting	the data.Notice,	we	did	not	state	that	 he	transported	the	data.	The	data	in question	is	going	to	come	down	on	some	node,	be	it	his	or	someone else’s.	That	is	how	Tor	works:	via	encrypted	traffic	that	gets	piped through	servers	on	its	own	IP	address,	through	various	layers	 hence	the term	Onion	layer 	and	decrypted	back	into	its	initial	form.	An	ISP	cannot discern	the	contents	in	transit.	However,	law	enforcement	can	see	the contents	coming	out	of	a	node	that	was	sent	from	the	other	side	of	the globe.	Holding	a	Tor	node	operator	responsible	would	be	like	holding	a forum	administrator	responsible	because	some	anonymous	poster	said he	was	going	to	kill	the	president. Misuse	of	Tor	end	nodes	are	fairly	common.	Back	in	2008,	a	man was	arrested	by	German	police	after	bomb	threats	passed	through	his Tor	node,	and	similarly,	they	confiscated	all	electronics—hardware, software,	and	threatened	imprisonment	because	someone	abused	his generosity.	These	kinds	of	cases	bring	up	a	few	parallels.	Should	the Austrian	government	sue	Google	for	having	illegal	data	flowing	through its	servers?	We’re	not	only	talking	about	images	or	bomb	threats.	Warez, kidnapping,	extortion,	bribery,	espionage,	a	long	laundry	list	of	crimes occur	on	a	daily	basis	via	their	search	engine,	and	though	Google cooperates	with	law	enforcement	 as	Weber	did ,	when	was	the	last	time you	heard	Google’s	servers	confiscated	by	a	court	order? And	then	there	is	encryption.	Should	Drivecrypt	and	Truecrypt developers	be	held	liable	for	helping	illegal	enterprises?	Truecrypt	is	a software	used	quite	heavily	by	Mexican	cartels	as	well	as	organized   crime	in	the	United	States.	Law	enforcement,	particularly	the	FBI,	tends to	shoot	first	and	ask	questions	later.	Maybe.	If	they’re	in	a	good	mood  or	ordered	to	by	a	judge .	Meanwhile,	your	electronics	are	confiscated and	your	reputation	damaged. The	entire	ordeal	has	been	setting	dangerous	precedent	for	years,	as any	average	Joe	who	just	happens	to	pass	some	part	of	an	illegal	data packet	through	his	connection	 or	unsecured	WiFi 	can	be	prosecuted. Furthermore,	police	are	not	known	for	their	technical	aptitude,	in	Austria or	anywhere	else.	They	took	his	Xbox360	and	anything	else	plugged	in that	looked	about	as	complex	as	a	toaster.	We	mustn’t	allow	Tor	node operators	to	be	scapegoats.	If	Tor	dies,	innocent	people	die.	They	won’t get	the	word	out	about	corrupt	government	actions	without	risking	their own	lives.	And	they	shouldn’t	have	to	risk	anything	to	get	the	word	out. As	of	2014,	no	one	has	been	sued	or	prosecuted	in	a	U.S.	court	of	law for	running	a	Tor	relay	 unlike	those	using	BitTorrent .	Furthermore, using	Tor	as	well	as	running	a	Tor	relay	is	perfectly	legal	under	U.S.	law. 	Benefits	of	Running	a	Tor	Exit	Node We’ve	talked	a	little	about	the	risks	of	being	a	Tor	exit	mode.	You might	be	saying,	well,	the	risks	far	outweigh	the	benefits.	And	in	some places,	you’re	right.	But	it	depends	on	where	you	live,	the	laws,	the bandwidth,	your	setup,	etc. So	what	are	the	benefits? -	Help	people	all	over	the	world	browse	the	net	anonymously	 esp. censorship-prone	countries  -	Provide	support	for	the	network -	 Exit	 nodes	 are	 always	 scarce.	 Your	 generosity	 supports development. -	Defeat	tyranny	 what’s	that?	Well,	North	Korea	for	one  -	Prevent	websites search	engines	from	tracking	you -	Help	others	get	beyond	the	Great	Firewall	of	China -	Join	the	Rebel	Alliance	 yeah	right  At	this	point	it	might	be	prudent	to	relay	my	own	experience.	The first	time	I	used	Tor,	I	was	already	fairly	good	as	not	only	admin	of several	websites	and	hosted	machines,	but	quite	good	at	encryption.	My frame	of	thought	was,	if	I	was	no	slouch	at	encryption,	Tor	would	be	a   piece	of	cake.	And	it	was…for	a	while.	I	had	plenty	of	bandwidth available,	so	I	jumped	right	in. Being	in	North	America	at	the	time,	it	would	be	a	few	weeks	to	get up	to	speed	on	all	the	pros	and	cons	of	Tor	relays,	and	not	from	the technical	standpoint,	but	the	legal.	I	envisioned	Blackhawk	helicopters and	car	chases	involving	white	vans	with	license	plates	that	read “NOTOJ”	should	I	be	so	unlucky	to	screw	up	my	configuration.	Putting	my paranoia	aside,	I	finally	got	it	running	full	speed,	and	studied	the	network logs	like	a	hawk	to	see	what	it	was	doing.	And	I	was	well-pleased.	Full	of pride,	you	might	say. Tor	traffic	trickled	in	like	a	sprinkle	before	a	storm,	and	after	three days	my	node	had	spread	just	as	the	bandwidth	limits	I	had	preset kicked	in.	The	feeling	was	euphoric.	Addicting.	I	envisioned	some	tech- starved	villager	in	North	Korea	accessing	something	verboten	by	the Korean	government.	I	kept	thinking	about	Matthew	Broderick	in WarGames	and	the	famous	line,	“The	only	way	to	win	the	game,	was	not to	play.”	Well,	I	tweaked	it	to	add,	“…by	the	Man’s	rules.”	It	was	all	good. Until	a	week	later	when	my	ISP	ordered	me	to	cut	the	Tor	umbilical. It	was	polite,	but	stern.	It	seemed	a	few	complaints	sailed	their	way.	As my	luck	would	have	it,	that	North	Korean	villager	turned	out	to	be	a swarm	of	torrentors	using	Tor	to	evade	the	trackers	setup	by	the	record industry.	It	hampered	Tor’s	bandwidth	like	a	hurricane	had	set	upon	it. “Torrents?”	I	said.	“Really?” Yes	indeed.	And	even	though	I	lived	in	Canada	at	the	time	and	wasn’t worried	about	a	torrent	of	lawsuits,	I	still	did	not	want	other	Tor	users	to be	hindered	by	greedy	users.	The	problem	I	ran	into	was	that	filtering torrent	traffic	is	a	bit	counterproductive	since	BitTorrent	is	able	to	run on	any	standard	port.	I	tried	blocking	ports	80	and	443	 web	traffic .	It wasn’t	a	silver	bullet,	however,	since	torrent	users	could	still	use	other ports.	BitTorrent	clients	like	uTorrent	and	BitLord	can	run	on	any	port, almost	all	randomly	chosen.	Thus	every	port	you	add	to	your	exit	node can	connect	to	another	client	listening	on	that	same	port.	Some	users even	enable	a	range	of	ports,	thereby	increasing	the	chance	of	getting	a DMCA	takedown	for	you. Hence,	we	come	to	the	Reduced	Exit	Policy	of	Tor,	an	alternative	to the	default	exit	policy.	You	are	still	able	to	connect	and	at	the	same	time   block	TCP	ports	 usually 	used	by	BitTorrent	users.	Below	are	a	couple	of port	lists	to	check	against	BitTorrent	clients: 	https:  secure.wikimedia.org wikipedia en wiki List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers 	http:  www.speedguide.net ports.php 	What	should	become	clear	as	crystal	at	this	point	is	that	you	should not	run	an	exit	relay	from	your	house,	with	emphasis	on	should	not.	Why not?	Because	of	the	aforementioned	scenarios	with	law	enforcement.	As we’ve	seen	in	prior	cases,	it	is	quite	easy	for	them	to	get	a	judge’s signature	 a	judge	who	knows	squat	about	Tor 	on	a	no-knock	warrant	in the	USA	should	they	start	sniffing	your	traffic.	Not	only	will	they	take your	computer,	but	everything	with	connectivity,	which	these	days includes	TVs	and	monitors.	Much	better	to	run	the	exit	relay	from	a commercial	provider	 and	there	are	many .	A	few	in	the	U.S.	who	are	not only	knowledgeable	about	Tor,	but	have	the	support	needed	to	deal	with abuse	cases	are	as	follows: 	Amazon	Web	Services	 AWS  AmeriNOC Arvixe Axigy ChunkHost Team	Cinipac Cyberonic Ethr.net Evolucix Future	Hosting 	A	full	comprehensive	list	is	available	at	the	Tor	Wiki	that	covers many	countries,	each	with	their	own	subset	of	laws	dealing	with anonymity	services	 and	extensive	comments	on	each . https:  trac.torproject.org projects tor wiki doc GoodBadISPs In	the	event	you	do	decide	to	run	a	Tor	relay	from	home	however, make	sure	you	inform	your	ISP	and	ascertain	whether	you	have	their	full   support	 i.e.	no	surprises	a	month	down	the	line .	The	abuse	complaints will	come	sooner	or	later,	just	as	they	did	for	me.	The	Tor	forums	have	a list	of	ISPs	that	are	friendly	towards	Tor	and	are	knowledgeable	about the	network,	in	addition	to	ones	that	are	not.   Freenet  Freenet	is	unlike	any	other	anonymizing	beast	on	the	entire internet.	It	takes	quite	a	wizardly	mind	to	crack	its	protection	and	to	that, it	is	a	bit	like	chess:	easy	to	grasp	the	basics,	long	and	difficult	to	become a	master.	Built	in	2000,	Freenet	is	a	vast,	encrypted	datastore	spanning thousands	of	connected	computers	across	the	globe,	all	distributing encrypted	contents	from	one	computer	to	another.	To	this	end,	it	is somewhat	similar	to	a	P2P	program	like	Emule.	Except	with	eEule,	every file,	whether	it	mp3,	rar	or	iso	is	out	there	in	the	open	for	weeks,	months and	years,	along	with	the	IP	addresses,	trumpeting	who	downloaded	and uploaded	every	file.	You	know	what	you	upload,	and	what	you	download, and	so	does	everyone	else. Freenet	is	different	in	this	regard. While	your	IP	address	is	visible,	what	you	are	uploading	out	of	your datastore	is	not.	You	initially	setup	the	size	of	the	datastore	for	others	to download	from	you.	This	datastore	is	encrypted.	You	have	no	idea	what will	eventually	be	inside,	as	the	contents	are	encrypted.	It	is	a	bit	like	a postal	worker	delivering	the	mail.	He	has	no	idea	what	is	in	the	package he	is	delivering.	That	is	not	his	job.	His	job	is	to	deliver	the	contents	to	its destination.	Therein	is	the	strength	of	Freenet. While	you	can	see	your	downloads	merrily	trickle	their	way	down	to your	laptop,	there	is	no	way	to	decrypt	your	datastore’s	content	and	see what	it	is	you’re	passing	along	to	the	nearest	node.	And	to	that,	the bigger	the	datastore,	the	more	efficiently	Freenet	runs.	After	one	inserts a	file	into	Freenet,	the	user	is	free	to	shutdown	their	pc.	This	is	unlike torrents	in	that	the	stability	of	the	torrent	file	is	dependent	on	the	length of	online	seeds.	Thus,	high	reliability	is	a	factor	with	Freenet	files,	as	the file	is	spread	between	encrypted	blocks	residing	in	the	Freenet	system. Freenet	is	slow.	So	slow	in	fact,	that	you	may	not	see	any measurable	progress	in	download	speed	for	a	couple	hours	or	so	after install,	and	it	may	be	a	day	before	you	can	see	extensive	progress	with old	 unpopular 	files.	Don’t	get	discouraged	because	of	this.	It	will	speed   up	gradually	over	time. Now,	with	your	IP	address	out	there	in	the	open,	you	might	be tempted	to	think	it	is	not	very	anonymous.	Nothing	could	be	further	from the	truth.	Whatever	you	download	is	encrypted	from	one	end	of	Freenet to	the	other,	and	decrypted	on	your	PC.	No	one	looking	in	from	the outside	can	see	who	requested	which	file	or	message.	No	one	on	the inside	knows	either,	except	you.	For	this	reason	alone,	it	is	extremely censorship-resistant.	This	level	of	anonymity	requires	each	node	that requests	data	to	operate	in	“hops”,	from	many	intermediaries,	similar	to what	you	would	see	in	Tor. However,	no	node	knows	who	requested	which	file,	thus	giving	a high	level	of	anonymity.	This	requirement	carries	a	price	in	that downloads	as	well	as	uploads	are	initially	extremely	slow,	especially	for new	data	inserts. Let’s	say	you	want	to	share	an	iso	dvd	image	on	this	network.	You fire	up	Frost	 a	front-end	addon	for	Freenet ,	then	hit	insert,	then	select the	file.	Then	depending	on	how	big	your	file	is,	you	could	be	waiting	for a	long	time,	say	several	hours,	for	the	file	to	finish.	If	this	file	had	been inserted	three	months	prior,	and	was	very	popular,	with	dozens	of	users trying	to	fetch	said	file,	then	that	file	would	download	very	fast.	However this	is	not	usually	the	case	with	new	files	since	every	kernel	of	data	on Freenet	operates	faster	if	and	only	if	it	is	a	popular	file. There	are	two	types	of	security	protocols	that	Freenet	offers: Darknet	and	Openet.	For	Openet,	you	connect	to	other	users,	called “strangers”.	There	is	nothing	sinister	about	this,	as	this	is	what	the Freenet	developers	envisioned	that	most	beginners	would	use.	The	IP address	of	said	strangers	is	visible,	but	the	anonymity	of	Freenet	isn’t nested	in	the	security	of	the	IP	address	like	Tor,	but	rather	it	is	nested	in the	encryption	methods	of	the	distributed	datastore. The	other	security	option,	which	you	are	given	at	installation,	is Darknet,	where	you	will	connect	to	“friends”	rather	than	“strangers”. These	will	be	Freenet	users	that	you	will	have	 presumably 	previously exchanged	node	references,	which	are	public	security	keys.	With	Darknet mode,	it	is	assumed	that	you	will	have	a	higher	level	of	trust,	as	your node	reference	is	related	to	your	online	Freenet	identity.	Needless	to	say, this	mode	is	not	to	be	taken	lightly.	You	really	do	have	to	TRUST	those   you	add	to	this	protocol.	That	is,	the	darknet	protocol. Within	Freenet,	there	are	no	censors.	Every	kind	of	free	speech	is allowable	and	often	encouraged.	The	very	way	in	which	Freenet	is programmed	makes	it	impossible	to	remove	any	message	from	the system	by	a	censor.	Individual	users	may	opt	to	erase	certain	comments from	the	frost	system,	for	instance,	but	this	is	only	at	the	local	level,	on their	machine,	and	not	the	Freenet	network	itself.	Thus,	no	religious group	for	instance	can	force	others	in	the	network	to	conform	to	their belief	and	discussion	system.	No	one	on	Freenet	may	deem	information so	offensive	that	it	must	be	removed.	Not	even	Freenet	developers. Needless	to	say,	this	has	some	negative	consequences	in	that	anyone may	say	anything	to	anyone	at	any	time.	Some	Freesites	on	the	Freenet network	 are	 plagued	 by	 spammers,	 identity	 thieves,	 terrorists, molesters,	government	anarchists	and	software	pirates.	The	Freenet developers	have	stated	this	is	a	necessary	evil	of	sorts	in	allowing	100% free	speech	to	reign	free.	It	could	be	argued	that	one	should	not	allow illicit	digital	goods	to	be	exchanged	between	users	just	so	people	could speak	freely,	however	one	of	the	stated	purposes	of	Freenet	is	to preserve	such	a	system	in	the	even	of	societal	collapse	or	oppression. While	there	are	no	rules	to	govern	Freenet	by	in	the	sense	of censoring	unsightly	posts,	a	few	guidelines	have	been	posted	in	scattered parts	of	Freenet	that	should	probably	be	heeded: 	1.	 	Never	give	anyone	on	Freenet	your	node-reference,	as	this contains	information	that	could	be	exploited	to	correlate	your	Freenet identity	with	your	IP	address. 2. 	Same	rule	as	Usenet:	Don’t	give	in	to	trolling	activity.	Trolling	by its	very	nature	flourishes	with	the	more	responses	it	receives.	Ignore them.3. 	Never	give	out	any	personal	info:	your	location,	where	you	grew up,	which	restaurants	you	like	most,	what	kinds	of	clothing	stores	you shop	at,	as	these	could	zero-in	on	your	location 4. 	Take	notice	of	different	regionally	spelled	words	 labor	vs. labour,	color	vs.	colour:	these	could	reveal	your	home	country . 5. 	Never	use	any	nickname	that	is	the	very	same	unique	nickname you	use	for	opennet	forums.	Use	popular	nicknames	like	Shadow,	John,   Peter	and	the	like. 	The	highest	security	setting	can	be	a	bit	foreboding,	but	perhaps necessary	in	countries	where	criticizing	the	government	could	land	you	a lifetime	in	a	work	camp.	It	has	an	encrypted	password	option	to	encrypt Freenet	usage.	This	setting	is	in	the	security	configuration,	along	with	a host	of	other	options	of	varying	system	requirements.	The	higher	the security	setting,	the	slower	Freenet	will	run	as	it	will	use	more	resources to	cover	your	footsteps. When	first	installing	Freenet,	it	will	likely	take	no	more	than	a	few minutes,	while	asking	you	which	security	level	you	would	like	to	operate at	 normal	up	to	maximum .	After	that	and	a	bit	of	time	allowed	for Freenet	to	find	nodes	to	connect	to,	you’ll	be	presented	with	a	previously hidden	world	where	a	Freenet	index	lists	every	possible	combination	of Freesites	available.	Everything	from	anarchy	sites	to	Iranian	news,	to pirated	copies	of	books,	films	and	game	roms	and	even	a	few	political how	to	documents	describing	how	to	protest	a	corrupt	government without	getting	caught	will	be	indexed. These	are	the	types	of	things	typically	either	censored	by	Google	in China,	or	deindexed	altogether.	The	only	thing	missing	is	a	disclaimer	at the	bottom	of	the	screen	welcoming	you	to	the	deepest,	darkest	depths	of the	internet,	known	as	Darknet. Optionally,	you	may	run	Freenet	from	an	encrypted	Truecrypt container	file.	You	will	need	to	create	a	Truecrypt	volume	that	is sufficiently	 intend	 on large	 enough	 to	 hold	 whatever	 files	 you	 downloading	from	Freenet.	Remember	to	keep	in	mind	that	when Freenet	asks	you	how	large	you	want	the	datastore	to	be,	the	size	you choose	could	be	a	benefit	to	other	Freenet	users.	The	larger	the datastore,	the	more	efficient	the	Freenet	network	operates. That	is	not	to	say	that	downloads	will	always	come	down	faster,	but rather	encrypted	data	will	last	longer	on	the	network.	This	is	similar	to the	retention	times	that	Usenet	providers	talk	about	when	they	try	to	sell their	servers	to	you.	The	higher	the	data	retention,	the	longer	the	files	on the	network	will	last.	There	is	also	another	bonus	to	having	a	large datastore,	say	fifty	gigabytes	or	so.	Files	that	you	may	request	may already	be	in	your	datastore	after	having	run	Freenet	for	some	time,   thereby	shortening	the	time	to	retrieve	them. With	your	Truecrypt	container	you	can	run	Freenet	with	the	volume mounted	and	not	worry	about	your	Freenet	activities	being	used	against you	in	case	of	your	computer	being	confiscated.	You	can	also	do	the	same for	your	Tor	browser	as	well.	Install	Tor	browser	bundle	to	a	mounted Truecrypt	container	and	only	run	the	program	when	mounted. 	Frost 	Frost	is	a	separate	application	than	Freenet,	which	acts	as	a	front- end.	It	makes	browsing	on	the	Freenet	network	more	akin	to	browsing Usenet	newsgroups.	Download	at: 	http:  jtcfrost.sourceforge.net 	After	running	Freenet,	you	can	optionally	run	Frost	simultaneously to	download	inserts	from	the	Freenet	network.	It	is	not	mandatory	but	it is	incredibly	helpful.	Run	Freenet,	then	Frost,	and	then	wait	an	hour	or	so for	Frost	to	find	some	groups,	and	then	hit	the	globe	button	at	the	top panel	to	subscribe	to	groups.	These	groups	all	have	discussions	going about	every	topic	under	the	sun.	Some	of	them	are	fairly	dead,	with almost	no	discussion	at	all,	and	others	swarm	with	activity. Frosty	Tips 1. 	If	you	started	downloading	something	in	Frost,	finish	it	in	Frost 2. 	Like	Usenet,	don’t	troll	the	boards.	It	will	get	you	put	on	user’s “ignore”	list	and	they	will	henceforth	not	see	any	messages	from	your nick.3. 	Never	reveal	your	node	reference	to	anyone	on	the	Frost	boards, as	it	could	be	used	to	locate	you. 4. 	Set	days	to	download	backwards	to	60	 or	however	long	you wish .	Just	be	aware	that	it	may	take	several	days	to	retrieve	all messages	if	you	select	a	very	large	amount	of	days. 5. 	In	the	options preferences	tab,	you	may	adjust	the	setting	to ignore	comments	from	users	with	less	than	four	messages	attached	to their	nickname.	This	is	very	effective	at	eliminating	most	spam	messages on	the	board.   Truecrypt,	Veracrypt,	Etc. There	are	two	types	of	encryption:	one	that	will	prevent	your	sister from	reading	your	diary	and	one	that	will	prevent	your	government.	- Bruce	Schneier It	would	be	folly	if	we	went	to	all	this	work	of	laying	out	the	security options	to	keep	our	online	footprint	out	of	nefarious	hands	and	not	say something	about	our	offline	footprint.	Put	simply,	you	should	tread carefully	with	your	offline	habits	just	as	you	should	your	online	persona. Let’s	say	you’re	in	your	favorite	cafe.	You’re	sipping	your	ice cappuccino	with	your	laptop	in	the	corner	of	the	coffee	scented	shop	and have	to	make	a	break	for	the	restroom.	It’ll	only	take	a	minute	or	so, right?	While	you’re	in	there,	the	guy	sitting	at	the	next	table	decided	to insert	a	USB	key	into	your	laptop	and	upload	a	keylogger	virus	into	your machine.	This	keylogger	is	ridiculously	small	in	size,	and	can	hide undetected	by	most	users.	It	can	even	disguise	itself	as	a	windows service	and	look	just	like	any	other	svchost	process,	all	the	while	taking snapshots	of	your	screen,	recording	everything	you	typed	for	the remainder	of	that	day,	and	emailing	them	to	whomever	installed	the virus.You	would	be	a	bit	worried	if	you	knew	about	it. However,	most	don’t	realize	they	leave	themselves	vulnerable	to such	attacks	in	public	places.	Some	experts	have	referred	to	this	as	the “evil	maid	attack”,	after	a	scenario	whereby	you	are	in	a	hotel	and	briefly step	outside	for	a	moment	and	at	which	point	the	maid	comes	in	and	has physical	access	to	your	running	machine.	They	now	have	access	to	every cookie	stored	by	your	browser	in	addition	to	any	credit	card	numbers you	have	used,	possible	phone	numbers emails	of	friends,	and	the	like. How	to	prevent	this? For	starters,	to	prevent	identity	theft	you	need	to	seriously	consider full-disk	encryption.	This	is	not	nearly	as	complex	as	you	might	think.	It is	ridiculously	easy	encrypt	your	boot	drive	and	costs	you	nothing,	and potentially	saves	you	from	months	of	headache.   There	are	several	encryption	apps	at	your	disposal:	the	paid programs,	such	as	PGP,	Drivecrypt,	and	Phonecrypt,	and	the	popular	free versions,	PGP	and	Truecrypt.	There	are	a	few	differences	between	them but	the	one	thing	to	take	away	from	both	free	and	paid	versions	is	that they	prohibit	anyone	from	booting	your	computer,	laptop,	or	phone without	the	password. Truecrypt	is	free,	and	does	this	by	creating	a	256	AES	encryption key.	You	install	the	application,	select	your	drive	you	want	to	encrypt, and	select	your	passphrase	and	create	an	encrypted	key.	Simple. How	does	this	benefit	you?	Well,	the	next	time	that	thief	who	stole your	laptop	tries	to	boot	up	the	hard	drive,	without	the	password	he’ll	be out	of	luck.	He	is	presented	with	this	password	field	before	windows even	boots,	and	if	it	is	not	keyed	in	correctly,	the	drive	halts.	The password,	if	sufficiently	long,	is	enough	to	withstand	almost	any	brute- force	attack,	even	by	the	NSA.	Just	make	sure	to	use	a	passphrase	that will	be	easy	to	remember,	but	long	enough	to	thwart	any	attacker:	15- character	passphrase	with	upper lowercase	letters	with	a	number	or two.Just	how	strong	is	Truecrypt?	It	is	considered	impossible	to	crack, on	the	order	of	millions	of	years.	It	would	take	quantum	computers	eons to	crack	even	a	moderately	length	passphrase	using	brute-force	methods. In	all	likelihood	the	absolute	weakest	link	is	you. Keyloggers	can	obtain	your	password	if	you	are	unlucky	enough	to get	one.	However,	these	are	a	fairly	rare	occurrence	if	you	keep	your operating	system,	anti-virus	and	anti-malware	programs	up	to	date.	The other	weakest	link	is	your	passphrase.	You	would	be	surprised	at	just how	many	people	use	their	own	personal	information	in	their passphrases.	Doing	this	might	make	the	password	easier	to	remember, but	also	easier	to	crack. A	good	passphrase	is	made	up	of	lower	and	upper	case	characters	in addition	to	spaces,	which	lend	more	entropy	bits	to	the	protection.	At each	instance	a	bit	is	added	to	a	passphrase,	the	computational crunching	requirement	to	crack	such	passphrase	is	doubled.	If	I	were living	in	North	Korea	or	China,	for	example,	I	would	seriously	consider	a passphrase	that	was	at	least	twenty	characters	long,	with	some	keyboard symbols	thrown	in	for	good	measure.	Most	people	do	not	like	to   remember	a	twenty	character	passphrase	however,	so	they	use	a	less random	one. Drivecrypt	is	another	encryption	program,	but	it	is	not	open-source and	is	not	free.	I	have	used	this	program	for	eight	years	and	have	to	say	if money	is	a	concern,	then	go	with	Truecrypt	as	it	has	many	of	the	same functions	that	Truecrypt	does,	and	for	zero	cost.	Drivecrypt	has	an	option called	“bootauth”	which	is	short	for	boot	authorization.	The	install process	is	similar	to	Truecrypt,	though	the	bootup	passphrase	screen	is	a little	different.	You	boot	your	hard	drive,	and	then	type	in	the	passphrase to	boot	the	OS.	Truecrypt	has	this	function	as	well. As	stated,	it	is	not	open-source.	What	that	means	is	that	it	cannot	be studied	by	the	public	sector	 read:	security	users 	to	determine	if	any backdoors	have	been	coded	in.	Like	Truecrypt,	it	offers	the	option	to create	an	encrypted	operating	system	that	holds	a	hidden	operating system	as	well	whose	existence	can	be	denied	to	those	trying	to	harm	or prosecute	you.	This	is	especially	beneficial	if	you	live	in	the	UK,	where failure	to	hand	over	a	passphrase	to	an	encrypted	hard	drive	can	get	you two	years	in	prison	on	a	contempt	of	court	charge.	However	you	could give	them	the	password	to	your	decoy	system.	There	is	no	way	they could	know	if	you	were	concealing	a	hidden	operating	system	without	a keylogger	in	place. Truecrypt	and	Drivecrypt	give	no	hints	or	leak	any	data	regarding the	existence	of	hidden	files.	The	only	way	to	mount	said	file	is	to	know the	password,	and	there	are	two	you	create	with	such	an	option:	one	for the	decoy,	and	one	for	the	hidden	container operating	system. Truecrypt	and	Drivecrypt	also	support	the	use	of	encrypted container	files,	which	when	clicked	will	mount	the	file	the	same	way	a mounting	application	like	DaemonTools	or	Nero	mounts	an	iso	image. Prior	to	mounting,	the	application	will	ask	you	for	the	password.	Mistype the	password	and	the	container	does	not	mount	at	all.	This	can	be	very handy	as	there	are	a	plethora	of	private	items	that	you	could	conceal from	government	or	any	kind	of	prosecuting	institution,	such	as	medical records,	tax	records,	school	transcripts,	business	correspondence	and the	like.Veracrypt	may	also	be	an	option	if	you	don’t	mind	the	Truecrypt interface.	In	fact,	they	look	and	act	very	similar.   VeraCrypt	main	features:	*	Creates	a	virtual	encrypted	disk	within	a file	and	mounts	it	as	a	real	disk. *	Encrypts	an	entire	partition	or	storage	device	such	as	USB	flash drive	or	hard	drive. *	Encrypts	a	partition	or	drive	where	Windows	is	installed	 pre-boot authentication . *	Encryption	is	automatic,	real-time on-the-fly 	and	transparent. *	Parallelization	and	pipelining	allow	data	to	be	read	and	written	as fast	as	if	the	drive	was	not	encrypted. *	Encryption	can	be	hardware-accelerated	on	modern	processors. *	Provides	plausible	deniability,	in	case	an	adversary	forces	you	to reveal	the	password:	Hidden	volume	 steganography 	and	hidden operating	system. 	Some	tips	for	Truecrypt Veracrypt	users:	1. 	If	you	have	one, disable	the	firewire	port,	as	this	can	be	used	to	reveal	the	encryption keys.2. 	Never	leave	any	containers	mounted	on	a	laptop	when	crossing	a border	station,	unless	you	want	your	private	information	in	said container	to	be	shared	with	the	guards. 3. 	Never	leave	your	PC	powered	on	and	unattended	for	any	lengthy amount	of	time	 public	wifi	spots,	cafes,	libraries,	college	classrooms, etc .	All	security	goes	out	the	window	when	an	attacker	 or	anyone	else  has	physical	access	to	your	machine.	Neither	Truecrypt	nor	Drivecrypt can	protect	your	data	in	such	a	case,	as	the	attacker	can	install	a keylogger	that	can	record	your	keystrokes. 	Thumbnails If	you	possess	any	incriminating	snapshots	 flings,	Wikileak	photos, informant	docs 	then	at	a	later	time	delete	the	images	in	the	folder,	be aware	that	a	shadow	copy	still	exists.	In	windows	XP	 yes,	legions	of users	are	still	clinging	to	this	OS ,	thumbnails	of	jpegs	are	stored	within each	folder	of	the	image’s	location.	So	if	you	have	a	folder	called “government	office	snapshots”,	you	will	have	thumbnails	enabled	in	the folder	settings	tab	for	any	pictures	 jpegs,	bitmaps,	etc ,	and	a	hidden thumbs.db	file	will	be	present	that	shows	a	mini	version	of	the	picture	in   a	  central	  question.	So	even	if	you	delete	the	jpegs,	this	hidden	file	will	still	reveal to	anyone	what	the	contents	of	the	original	folder	were. The	only	way	to	see	or	disable	this	hidden	file	is	to	go	to	Tools	- Options	-	View	and	set	the	option	to	“show	hidden	files	and	folders“. Until	this	is	done,	every	single	folder	with	pictures	in	it	will	store	a mini-snapshot	of	the	pictures	unless	this	is	disabled.	Windows	7	is	a completely	different	file	system	to	Windows	XP.	Instead	of	keeping	the thumbnail	cache	within	the	folder	where	the	pictures	reside,	it	stores	it location in	  %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer  I	have	found	it	much	better	to	just	leave	the	thumbnail	option	off	in Windows	7,	as	the	images	load	fairly	quickly	without	the	need	for	a	cache to	speed	things	up.	There	are	other	files,	like	text,	audio	and	the	like,	that are	also	at	risk	of	being	discovered	if	you	do	not	take	precautions	to securely	delete	the	file.	That	does	not	mean	deleted	from	the	recycle	bin, however.	When	you	delete	any	items	from	the	recycle	bin,	all	that	does	is tell	the	operating	system	that	the	space	previously	occupied	by	that	file can	be	written	to	again.	It	does	not	delete	the	file	permanently	until	that space	is	overwritten	to	again	by	some	other	program. Government	agencies	have	programs	that	can	 undelete	a	file.	The way	around	this	is	to	use	various	programs	to	securely	delete	a	file,	such as	Ccleaner.	This	app	has	an	interesting	wipe	utility	as	well,	in	that	it	can wipe	the	free	space	of	any	previously	deleted	contents	on	the	hard	drive. You	can	even	do	this	while	the	operating	system	is	in	use. Needless	to	say,	if	you	have	a	2	terabyte	hard	drive	and	you’re	only using	20%	of	the	drive,	with	80%	being	“free	space”,	then	it	will	be	a	few hours	for	it	to	finish	the	wipe	process,	dependent	on	the	speed	of	the hard	drive	and	what	other	programs	you	have	running.	It	does	not	touch any	installed	programs	that	exist	already	on	the	system	unless	you	tell	it to,	and	then	only	that	free	space	that	is	allocated	for	use. 	Swap	File Let’s	talk	briefly	about	the	“swap”	file	that	most	operating	systems use.	What	this	means	is	that	sometimes	during	heavy	PC	usage,	you	will run	low	on	system	memory,	and	then	the	operating	system	will	use	your hard	drive	as	a	temporary	ram	storage	device.	This	is	what	is	called	the   “swap	file”,	which	increases	the	speed	of	computer	operations.	This	swap file	can	be	a	veritable	gold	mine	of	data	to	someone	with	nefarious intentions. Text	files,	video	thumbnails,	and	word	document	fragments	can exist	herein,	enough	to	print	out	a	pretty	good	snapshot	of	your	past. There	have	even	been	court	cases	where	people	were	convicted	in	court using	nothing	but	thumbnail	fragments. You	can	disable	the	swap	file	windows	uses	by	going	to	control panel,	System	&	Security,	System,	Advanced,	Performance,	Settings, Advanced,	Virtual	Memory	and	click	Change.	Choose	“No	Paging	File”. Reboot.Note:	Some	resource	intensive	games	use	the	swap	file	to	speed	up their	games	when	there	is	not	enough	ram.	If	you	run	into	any slowdowns	with	normal	PC	usage	you	can	always	switch	this	option	back on,	then	reboot.   I2P  I2P,	otherwise	known	as	the	“Invisible	Internet	Project”	is	another option	that	people	can	use	to	hide	their	online	IP	address.	It	shares	a	lot of	the	same	characteristics	of	other	networks	in	that	it	routes	traffic through	neighboring	peers.	The	developers	have	stated	that	their	main goal	is	not	necessarily	one	of	100%	anonymity	 a	goal	some	say	is impossible ,	but	rather	to	make	the	system	too	troubling	and	expensive to	attack	from	the	outside.	It	is	an	 anonymizing	network	with	several layers	of	encryption	wrapped	around	all	the	data	that	travels	through	the system. 	I2P	VS	Tor You	might	think	this	sounds	a	lot	like	Freenet,	but	the	similarity	is actually	more	like	Tor’s	network.	I2P	offers	interactivity	with	websites, blogs,	forums,	chat,	search	engines	and	all	without	the	need	to	install	any of	them	locally.	Such	are	the	hallmarks	of	I2P.	Websites	that	exist	in	the I2P	network	are	called	Eepsites,	and	are	hosted	anonymously	with	I2P being	a	strict	requirement	to	access	these	websites.	In	that	vein,	it	is similar	to	the	.onion	sites	accessible	only	via	Tor.	Every	PC	that	is connected	to	the	I2P	network	shares	in	the	forwarding	of	encrypted packets	of	data	through	proxies	prior	to	the	final	destination.	Each subsequent	proxy	prunes	a	layer	of	encryption	at	various	intervals	until encryption	is	removed.	The	bottom	line	is	this:	No	one	knows	the	origin of	said	packets,	a	trait	also	shared	by	Tor.	While	it	is	true	that	both	Tor and	I2P	have	different	goals	in	mind,	there	exists	many	similarities:	- Both	exist	as	anonymizing	networks	-	Both	use	layered	encryption	to funnel	data	-	Both	have	hidden	services	-	Tor	has	Exit	Nodes	and	I2P	has Outproxies Benefits	of	Tor	over	I2P -	Larger	user	base	than	I2P;	support	from	academic	sources, constant	improvements	in	stability	and	resistance	to	attacks	-	Funding	is sourced	from	many	countries	around	the	globe	-	Large	number	of	Exit   Nodes	-	Translated	into	many	languages	-	Optimized	for	Exit	Traffic	- Memory	more	optimized	than	I2P -	Written	in	C 	Benefits	of	I2P	over	Tor -	Hidden	Services	much	faster	than	the	Tor	network. -	Not	as	many	DOS	 denial	of	service 	attacks	as	Tor. -	Compatible	with	peer-to-peer	file	sharing	 Tor	is	not . -	Tor	tunnels	last	a	long	time	compared	to	I2P.	This	ensures	less attacks	as	the	number	of	samples	a	hacker	may	use	are	limited. -	Every	peer	routes	data	for	others. -	Offers	TCP UDP. -	Written	in	Java. 	As	you	can	see,	both	networks	are	safe	enough	for	anonymity,	as long	as	you	aren’t	a	world-hunted	target.	To	this,	a	user’s	anonymity	is typically	broken	due	to	their	own	sloppy	behavior—their	overconfidence being	the	weakest	link	in	most	cases	 using	the	same	login	names	on many	websites,	mixing	these	with	Tor	and	non-Tor	websites,	and enabling	JavaScript Flash . Since	I2P	is	not	built	to	act	as	a	proxy	to	the	WWW,	you	should	use Tor	if	you	want	to	surf	anonymously.	The	outproxies	on	I2P,	as	you’ve probably	guessed,	are	similar	to	the	exit	nodes	on	Tor,	but	they	do	not have	the	greatest	support	and	tend	to	be	unstable.	Thus	you	should	use Tor	for	anonymous	web	browsing	and	I2P	for	I2p	eepsites.	One	option	is to	use	Foxy	Proxy	to	test	it	yourself.	Be	aware	however	that	since	there are	fewer	outproxies	than	Tor	exit	nodes,	it	may	be	easier	for	an adversary	to	identify	your	activities.	It	all	depends	on	how	much	risk	you want	to	assume	and	what	the	ramifications	are	if	you	are	caught	 and	in which	country . You	can	also	use	I2P	for	BitTorrent	and	iMule	as	well	as	other	P2P applications.	Like	Freenet,	you	will	find	that	I2P	will	grow	in	speed	the longer	you	use	it	without	interruption.	Torrents	will	be	faster.	Data	will come	down	like	lightning.	Tor	users	will	thank	you	for	it.	There	are already	too	many	torrent	users	on	Tor	that	clog	the	network	and	make	it difficult	for	people	in	dire	straits	who	need	anonymity	for	their	political   actions	far	more	than	the	next	Incubus	CD. While	I2P	is	a	technical	powerhouse	for	anonymity,	it	can	be	a	bit like	a	house	of	cards.	Once	the	Ace	is	pulled	from	the	bottom	layer	 by you ,	it	can	be	rendered	moot.	I2P	is	just	a	tool,	as	is	Tor	and	Freenet.	It	is not	an	invisibility	cloak.	Do	something	stupid,	like	move	too	much	when a	pack	of	Orcs	are	looking	your	way,	you’re	bound	to	get	an	arrow	in	a place	where	you	least	expect	it.	Thus,	act	smart	by	being	proactive	in anonymity: 1. 	Turn	Off	Javascript Yes,	it	bears	repeating,	with	arms	waving	in	the	air	and	shouting	at the	top	of	our	lungs.	Javascript	is	the	bane	of	not	only	Tor,	but	other networks	that	rely	on	cloaking	your	IP	address.	Leaving	this	beastly plugin	ON	allows	code	to	be	run	on	your	machine,	code	that	will	decloak you.	Look	at	your	browser	settings	and	disable	it.	Also	disable	cookies. Super	cookies	are	deployed	in	the	wild	to	track	down	Tor	users.	Don’t	let it	happen	to	you	on	I2P.	Javascript	can	reveal	a	ton	of	metrics	that fingerprint	a	user.	Display	resolution,	page	width,	font	and	so	on	can	be sent	to	an	adversary	by	stealth.	If	you’re	in	doubt,	take	a	look	at	the	web API	at	Mozilla: https:  developer.mozilla.org en-US docs Web API 	2. 	Silence	is	Golden! 	Don’t	say	a	peep.	Sure,	you	can	talk.	But	refrain	from	discussing:	the weather,	your	geography,	your	hobbies,	your	city	politician	that	was	just arrested	for	soliciting	hookers.	If	someone	says,	“Hows	the	weather	in your	town?”	You	say:	“Sunny.”	Every	time.	Alternatively,	you	may misinform.	The	CIA	does	it,	why	can’t	you?	Their	entire	organization	is built	on	secrecy	and	deception.	Don’t	get	too	choked	up	about	a	few white	lies.	Spreading	misinformation	about	trivial	things	like	the	weather and	the	local	politics	can	really	put	a	nail	in	an	adversary’s	coffin.	Ditto on	employment.	If	you	are	asked	about	your	work	and	you’re	a programmer,	say	you’re	a	mail	sorter	down	at	the	Post	Office.	They’re not	going	to	ask	you	about	the	latest	Elvis	stamp. 	3. 	Rotate	Usernames Nics   The	desire	for	convenience	often	gets	people	in	trouble.	They	use the	same	usernames	on	multiple	sites forums.	That’s	fine	for	the daytime,	open	web.	Not	so	much	for	the	darknet.	It	breaks	anonymity. Take	forums	for	example.	When	your	username	becomes	infamous	for	a wealth	of	knowledge,	change	it.	Create	a	new	one.	Don’t	tell	anyone. Entropy	rises	when	many	users	swap	information	like	this	on	a	frequent basis.	Maintain	separate	personas:	one	for	the	darknet,	one	for	regular internet.	Memorization	is	better	than	writing	it	down. 	4. 	Never	turn	off	your	router I	never	turn	mine	off.	Ever.	If	it	is	constantly	going	on	and	off	while Freenet,	Tor,	I2P	or	IRC	is	running,	after	a	while	clues	will	surface	as	to who	I	really	am,	provided	a	sufficiently	determined	adversary	has	the resources	to	do	it	 NSA .	The	cost	in	power	is	negligible,	so	don’t	go cheap	with	anonymity.	As	the	saying	goes:	out	of	speed,	anonymity	and reliability,	you	can	only	pick	two,	but	make	up	for	the	lost	component	by acting	smart. 	5. 	Power	in	Numbers:	Bandwidth Don’t	be	stingy	with	your	connection.	The	more	you	participate	in the	storm	of	users	 Freenet,	I2P ,	the	more	cloaked	you	will	be.	It	is better	to	run	24 7	if	you	can.	This	makes	it	more	difficult	for	an adversary	to	discern	if	you	sent	a	file	to	someone	else,	or	if	you	are merely	the	middle	man	to	some	file	sent	by	a	total	unknown	on	the	other side	of	the	globe.	Besides	this,	leaving	the	program	running	just	makes	it a	lot	faster	network	in	general	for	other	users.	Think	Safety	in	Numbers. 	6. 	Optional	 but	smart  In	the	browser	settings,	set	browser.safebrowsing.enabled	and browser.safebrowsing.malware.enabled	to	false.	Search	goliaths	like Google	and	Microsoft	do	not	need	to	know	the	website	URLs	you	visit. Get	into	the	habit	of	flushing	the	cache—cookies,	 etc.	You	can	set this	to	do	it	automatically	upon	exit	of	the	browser. Refrain	from	using	Foxy	Proxy	to	selective	proxy	.i2p	links.	You don’t	want	to	be	sent	to	the	clearnet.	If	an	I2P	website	is	a	honeypot, your	Firefox	browser	can	send	a	unique	identifier	in	the	referrer,	in   which	case…	anonymity	broken. At	this	point	you’re	probably	thinking	this	is	way	more	headaches than	it	is	worth.	And	you’d	be	right…in	the	beginning.	But	anything worth	doing	is	usually	hard	at	the	outset.	I	as	well	as	my	colleagues	do	all of	these	things	only	because	we	have	done	them	for	years. We	do	them	every	day. Are	we	thinking	about	them? No,	not	in	the	least	on	account	of	smart	habits	done	daily.	Do	you think	intently	about	starting	your	car?	Pulling	out	of	the	driveway?	No. But	it’s	a	good	bet	you	were	petrified	to	do	it	when	you	were	sixteen.	And pulling	out	of	your	driveway	is	a	very	complex	action,	as	are	the aforementioned	suggestions.	Just	one	of	your	brain	cells	is	more	complex than	a	747.	Don’t	waste	any	of	them. 	Torrents	and	Eepsites First	things	first.	Install	not	only	the	NoScript	plugin,	but	also	the Cookie	Whitelist	 Buttons .	Ideally	you	want	to	block	everything	when surfing	Eepsites.	There	are	a	multitude	of	add-ons	on	the	Firefox	site	but you	do	not	need	all	of	them.	You	only	need	the	ones	that	preserve	your anonymity. 	Install	QuickProxy,	also	at	the	Firefox	site.	Restart.	Then	open	the proxy	settings	using	the	edit	tab	and	then	browse	to	“Preferences”	and “Advanced”.	Then	“Settings”.	Change	your	proxy	settings	to:	127.0.0.1	for HTTP	Proxy,	Port	4444	and	127.0.0.1	and	port	4445	for	SSL	Proxy. Ensure	Socks	v4	is	checked. 	Click	“Okay”	and	exit	out.	If	you’ve	configured	it	correctly	you	should be	able	to	click	the	QuickProxy	icon	 lower	corner	of	browser 	when	you browse	Eepsites.	You	can	also	paste	in	.i2p	websites	and	hit	“Go”	the	old fashioned	way. 	Torrents An	option	for	torrents	is	to	use	I2PSnark.	If	you’re	a	beginner, ensure	the	service	is	running	by	opening	a	terminal	and	inputing: $	i2prouter	status   	If	it	is	not	running,	start	it	with: $	i2prouter	status 	Then	browse	via	Firefox	to http:  localhost:7657 i2psnark  	At	the	main	I2PSnark	page,	you	can	see	it	running.	Now	you	can create	a	torrent.	Move	a	torrent	and	the	data	into ~ .i2p i2psnark 	The	other	option	is	to	paste	the	data	you	want	to	seed	to	the	same directory,	and	in	my	case,	this	is	usually	PDFs	and	technical	manuals.	At the	Tracker	option,	you	can	choose	whatever	method	you	wish	or	create an	entirely	new	torrent.	I2PSnark	will	create	the	new	torrent	and	set	it	in a	queue.	All	that	remains	to	be	done	is	to	click	Start	in	the	top	corner	and away	you	go. Get	your	torrents	from	Postman’s	tracker: http:  tracker2.postman.i2p  	Torrents	might	be	slow	at	first,	but	do	not	get	discouraged.	You	will have	far	faster	downloads	on	I2P	than	you	ever	will	Tor.	One	can	never have	enough	good	karma	in	this	world.   Facebook	and	Other	Misfits Facebook	is	a	bit	of	a	mixed	bag	where	ethics	is	concerned.	On	the one	hand,	it	is	immensely	popular	and	profit-inducing	for	a	reason: people	love	to	chat	with	relatives,	old	neighborhood	friends,	girlfriends, mistresses	and	political	liaisons,	all	in	real-time.	People	love	connections. The	feeling	of	unity	and	solidarity.	The	benefits	are	fairly	immediate	if you’re	the	type	of	individual	who	likes	instant	gratification.	There	is nothing	quite	like	the	feeling	of	seeing	old	friends	on	your	friend’s	list who	you	have	not	seen	in	twenty-five	years,	now	instantly	accessible	for a	chat	session	at	just	about	any	time	of	day. It	used	to	be	that	Facebook	didn’t	rely	as	much	on	the	IP	address	as a	P2P	network	did.	Times	have	changed.	Nowadays,	all	of	your	personal information	is	theirs	for	the	taking,	and	in	some	cases	offered	up	on	a digital	platter	by	endusers.	Your	real	name,	phone	number,	who	your past	and	present	friends	are,	and	even	your	pets	are	all	valuable	data	as it	can	be	targeted	with	advertising	tailored	to	every	atom	of	your personality.	What	could	go	wrong,	you	ask? One	problem	facing	Facebook	users	is	that	it	is	all	too	easy	for Facebook	to	give	this	treasure	trove	of	data	up	to	the	highest	bidder. Worse,	Facebook	acts	not	as	a	protector	of	the	4th	amendment,	but	as	an destroyer	of	it.	Many	government	agencies	and	local	law	enforcement have	relied	on	Facebook	profiles	to	establish	alibis,	reveal	private	emails, and	prove	or	disprove	acts	that	may	be	criminal	or	not.	Read	the Facebook	privacy	policy	for	yourself: “We	may	also	share	information	when	we	have	a	good	faith	belief	it	is entities.” 	They’re	mandated	by	the	government	to	abide	by	subpoenas	for  necessary	 to	 prevent	 fraud	 or	 other	 illegal	 activity,	 to	 prevent	 imminent bodily	 harm,	 or	 to	 protect	 ourselves	 and	 you	 from	 people	 violating	 our Statement	 of	 Rights	 and	 Responsibilities.	 This	 may	 include	 sharing information	 with	 other	 companies,	 lawyers,	 courts	 or	 other	 government   user	information	data	except	any	private	messages	that	are	unopened and	are	less	than	181	days	of	age	 these	require	a	warrant .	The	problem is	that	the	Supreme	Court	never	recognized	a	4th	amendment	right	to privacy.	That	is,	data	being	shared	with	third	parties,	so	the	government pretty	much	has	a	blank	check	to	engage	in	“shooting-fish-in-a-barrel” type	expeditions	for	subscriber	information	that	may	or	may	not	have anything	to	do	with	any	criminal	acts. State	and	corporation	are	thus	conjoined	at	the	hip	in	a	quasi- fascism	that	is	difficult	to	defeat	and	predict,	nevermind	the	fact	that	the government	often,	when	it	has	nothing	else	to	do,	creates	laws	that	are meant	to	be	broken—over	and	over	 speed	limits,	anyone? . Thus,	outside	of	discussions	on	anonymity,	there	is	a	not	much	to	do when	the	enemy’s	archers	are	standing	upon	the	castle	towers	with flaming	arrows	aimed	at	the	exposed	king.	But	we’ll	try	nevertheless. Be	mindful	of	what	you	type	on	Facebook.	Actually,	be	paranoid, unless	you	are	one	of	the	king’s	fools.	This	should	go	without	saying,	but the	neverending	stream	of	fools	on	Facebook	often	don’t	even	recognize your	need	for	privacy	or	anonymity	to	say	nothing	of	their	own.	They	get so	accustomed	to	the	personalized	interface	that	you	start	to	think they’ve	got	in	it	for	you	with	their	shouting	your	real	name	across	the internet.You	are	not	anonymous	here,	or	on	any	other	social	media	site— Twitter,	Pinterest,	Google	Plus,	etc. In	fact,	a	new	Facebook	account	has	even	less	privacy	than	one	on	a P2P	network	like	Emule.	Where	emule	is	concerned,	you	only	had	to worry	about	the	ip	address.	With	Facebook,	your	private	life	belongs	to them	unless	you	take	drastic	action	to	prevent	it.	Yes,	you	may	have heard	more	than	a	few	complaints	from	a	few	peasants	about	the	lack	of privacy	on	Social	Media.	It	hasn’t	failed	to	reached	the	ears	of	the	ivory tower	executives	at	Facebook,	Inc.	But	what	do	they	really	think	of anonymity? 	The	Anomaly:	Anonymous	Facebook	Login 	In	April	of	2014,	CEO	Mark	Zuckerberg	announced	that	Facebook planned	to	implement	“Anonymous	Login”	for	all	users.	It	was	a   misnomer	in	the	same	way	that	“cat	owner”	is	a	misnomer.	It	offers	more privacy,	certainly,	but	not	anonymity.	It	doesn’t	come	close	to	anonymity since	you	cannot	login	to	Facebook	anonymously.	What	it	means	is	that, using	your	Facebook	login,	you	can	sign	in	to	other	websites,	say	at	Ars Technica	or	Wired,	and	make	comments	without	having	to	grant	access to	the	treasure	of	data	Facebook	holds	on	you:	your	list	of	contacts, relatives,	friends,	favorite	cereals	and	the	fact	you	hate	cats	with	a brimstone	passion. Presently	they	are	testing	this	so	called	“anonymity”	service	with	a smattering	of	social	sites	and	forums	so	as	to	better	“benefit	the enduser”,	as	Zuckerberg	claims—grant	more	control	to	its	userbase	on some	of	the	data	that	gets	transferred.	Notice	the	word	“some”…	of	the data.	Not	all. And	herein	is	the	fallacy:	most	people,	especially	those	on	social media,	do	not	know	the	difference	between	anonymity	and	privacy.	Thus the	masses	will	gobble	it	up.	Certainly	signing	up	for	a	new	service	can	be cumbersome—email,	check	link,	clink	on	link,	fill	out	forms,	click	another link	in	email,	fill	out	more	forms.	It’s	a	breath	of	fresh	air	to	know	simpler times	are	in	the	pipeline,	but	let’s	call	it	what	is:	efficiency,	not anonymity. Most	people	will	think	Facebook	will	stand	true	to	their	anonymity statement,	but	the	truth	of	it	is	that	they	lied	to	their	userbase	right	out of	the	gate,	trading	the	mundane	term	privacy	for	the	much	loftier	goal	of anonymity.	Facebook	knows	all	about	these	third	party	sites	you	visit, and	is	willing	to	offer	the	data	up	to	the	highest	bidder. Your	behavior,	your	identity,	your	favorites,	all	are	a	win-win	for Facebook,	and	a	lose-lose	for	the	third	party	sites	and	you.	If	a	nosy	judge wants	to	uncloak	you	on	a	third	party	site	over	some	“slanderous” comment	you	made,	they	need	not	go	to	the	third	party	site.	They	will	go to	Facebook.	They	know	the	name	you	signed	in	with,	the	time	you	made the	comment,	the	IP	address	you	used	to	bounce	to	the	discussion. Checkmate. In	an	interview	with	Wired’s	Steve	Levy,	Zuckerberg	had	this	to	say about	their	new	vision: “When	we	were	a	smaller	company,	Facebook	login	was	widely adopted,	and	the	growth	rate	for	it	has	been	quite	quick.	But	in	order	to   get	to	the	next	level	and	become	more	ubiquitous,	it	needs	to	be	trusted even	more.	We’re	a	bigger	company	now	and	people	have	more questions.	We	need	to	give	people	more	control	over	their	information	so that	everyone	feels	comfortable	using	these	products.” 	Sounds	suspicious,	does	it	not?	Well,	that’s	not	to	say	it’s	good	for the	goose	either.	In	this	case,	the	third	party.	Website	developers	who decide	to	use	Facebook’s	API	to	expand	their	readership	will	have	that decision	come	back	to	haunt	them	since	Facebook	“controls”	the	client that	uses	the	API	login.	They	can	shut	off	the	API	for	the	developers	just as	Nevada	can	shut	off	water	piping	out	to	California.	To	counter	this, they	will	be	ever	more	vigilant	in	mining	user	data	and	be	hesitant,	if	not fully	opposed,	to	using	this	new	“anonymous”	setting	as	it	grants Facebook	absolute	rule	over	its	userbase.	That	is,	if	they	were	 smart. Many	are	not. 	How	to	Be	Anonymous	on	Facebook 	Facebook	is	allergic	to	anonymity.	You’ve	probably	heard	that	they frown	on	anonymous	accounts.	It	is	not	entirely	difficult	to	understand why.	They	can’t	target	you	with	advertisements	if	they	don’t	know	who you	are,	and	that’s	their	bread	and	butter.	From	your	behavior	come	the metrics,	the	things	you	buy,	the	places	you	enjoy	visiting,	your	family links.	From	their	own	lips: 	This	is	a	roadblock	that	fortunately	can	be	overcome,	since	genuine names	are	not	yet	tied	to	any	form	of	government	ID	schemes	like driver’s	licenses	or	social	security	numbers	 though	they	will	be someday .	And	even	then,	the	rules	of	supply	and	demand	would	dictate even	this	would	not	dissuade	the	need	for	full	anonymity. When	you	are	neck-deep	in	the	account	creation	process	at Facebook,	you	need	to	enter	as	much	false	data	as	you	can.	The	email address	in	particular	needs	to	be	created	in	complete	anonymity.	The	big mistake	most	people	make	is	assuming	that	clocking	the	IP	address	is	a  “We	require	everyone	to	provide	their	real	names,	so	you	always	know  who	you’re	connecting	with.”   sufficient	means	to	the	end.	However	there	are	many	tracking mechanisms—complex	algorithms	designed	to	match	behavior	patterns and	preferential	choices—that	all	the	big	social	media	giants	employ.	Just one	slip	up,	a	broken	link	in	the	chain	such	as	connecting	to	a	website that	knows	your	real	identity	 BBC,	for	instance 	can	destroy	your	every effort.	Before	you	know	it,	all	the	others	have	been	alerted	by	bots, warning	pings	and	moderators	that	you’ve	talked	to	in	that	session. Endgame. Ask	yourself	this:	Would	your	closest	friends	refer	to	you	by	name	if you	attended	a	popular	masquerade	in	New	Orleans	during	Mardi	Gras? You	bet	they	would,	masked	or	not,	even	if	you	had	pleaded	with	them	to protect	your	identity.	Some	of	them	might	whisper	your	name,	not	really even	thinking	about	their	prior	oath	of	secrecy. Then	before	you	know	it,	another	who	happens	to	have	the	ears	of	a fox	overhears	your	name	being	called.	In	much	the	same	way,	Facebook identifies	you	by	your	acquaintances	just	as	others	might	do	at	the masquerade.	Who	is	he	talking	to?	A	woman?	Young	or	old?	Tall	or short?	Do	they	talk	with	their	hands?	Ah,	that’s	Maria	from	Rome.	It’s really	not	too	difficult,	and	neither	is	it	for	Facebook.	Friends	and	family lists	are	hardline	identifiers	in	Facebook	and	Google’s	algorithms.	The facial	recognition	Facebook	employs	can	only	get	more	advanced	as	it scours	the	web	for	matches	elsewhere:	Flickr.	Google.	Amazon.	Twitter. Mugshot	sites.	Surveillance	videos.	Then	there	are	photos	of	you	to worry	about:	photos	your	friends	have	that	are	out	of	your	control. Facebook	installs	super	cookies	on	your	machine	 or	one	of	their many	3rd	party	enforcers 	that	tracks	you	in	a	number	of	ways:	by	Sid number,	MAC	address,	 etc.	It	continues	to	track	you	even	after	you’ve logged	out	of	all	your	social	media	sites.	There	can	be	no	such	event	as 100%	anonymity	just	as	there	can	be	no	such	thing	as	a	perfect	human. We	are	the	weak	links. But	fear	not,	young	Jedi.	All	is	not	yet	lost. While	true	anonymity	is	difficult,	it	is	not	impossible.	We	can approach	98%	anonymity	with	some	smart	decisions.	First	things	first. Invest	in	a	VPN	account.	The	more	walls	we	have	between	us	and	the target,	the	stronger	the	cloak.	Visibility	is	cloudy	in	a	VPN	as	they	shield many	of	your	moves.	Location	awareness	is	difficult	to	detect	using	a   VPN,	but	avoid	free	public	proxies	as	Facebook	and	every	other	site	has been	spammed	to	death	with	them	and	have	shielded	themselves	from those	range	of	IP	addresses.	Thus,	a	proper	 well-respected 	VPN	is	the way	to	go.	You	will	want	speed	to	blend	in	with	other	non-anonymous users.	Every	metric	counts. You	will	need	to	disable	most	cookies	from	third-parties	but	allow Facebook	for	each	session.	Using	Firefox	portable,	you	can	set	the browser	to	auto-clear	them	upon	exiting	each	session. Set	up	your	false	data.	Everything	must	be	different	from	anything you’ve	set	at	any	other	forum.	Ars	Technica,	Wired,	WSJ—they’re	all	in bed	with	Facebook	to	one	degree	or	another.	Ensure	complete uniqueness,	and	under	no	circumstances	give	them	your	mobile	phone number,	as	this	will	nuke	your	anonymity	before	it	gets	off	the	ground. That	number,	along	with	the	IP,	is	used	primarily	for	targeted	advertising as	well	as	by	law	enforcement.	You	may	have	noticed	that	Yahoo	now requires	it	for	new	accounts.	The	reason	is	that	it	makes	things	easier	to identify	you. Avoid	a	large	group	of	friends	and	NO	RELATIVES.	This	can’t	be stressed	enough.	Relatives,	especially	the	elderly,	love	to	gossip	and	spill details	about	the	retched	veal	you	cooked	last	night,	or	the	cat	you sprayed	with	the	garden	hose	last	week.	What	you	don’t	hear	in	other’s chat	boxes	at	Facebook	can	harm	you.	Politely	tell	 never	ask 	others	not to	tag	you	or	refer	to	any	events	that	may	compromise	you:	pictures, videos,	music	that	your	“real	self”	enjoys.	Three	breadcrumbs	is	enough to	raise	the	eyebrow	of	the	algorithm.	Insist	on	them	calling	you	by	a nickname.	If	they	refuse,	remove	them. Never	use	the	same	browser	for	your	VPN	that	you	use	for	non-VPN sessions.	Install	Firefox	portable	in	its	own	directory	with	its	own shortcut	and	configured	to	the	VPN	BEFORE	creating	the	Facebook account.	Never	mix	them	up.	You	don’t	want	cross-cookie	contamination. Be	cautious	on	other	social	sites	as	well:	Google,	Twitter,	Pinterest, MySpace.	Facebook	will	not	invest	in	the	resources	to	find	you	unless	you hand	them	crumbs	of	data	yourself,	which	can	easily	be	done	on	other sites	you	are	careless	with.	So	avoid	being	too	specific	about	things related	to	your	hardwired	beliefs	on	those	other	sites,	too:	Religion. Politics.	Ethics.	Switch	them	up.	Be	a	Buddhist	for	a	session	or	two.	Or	a   real	  reflect	 his	  non-practicing	non-denominationalist.	Just	be	mindful	of	stirring	up	a hornet’s	nest.	A	friend	in	Thailand	 an	American 	who	was	well	known	in Freenet	insulted	the	Thai	king	on	Facebook,	prompting	them	to	take	a magnifying	glass	to	his	account.	The	end	result?	Facebook	changed	his name	 without	 his	 authorization—to	 identity. Embarrassing.	He’d	posted	a	link	to	his	page	on	Freenet	as	well	and	as you	can	imagine,	his	entire	identity	was	uncovered	by	this	loud	behavior. It	is	not	possible	to	convert	your	existing	Facebook	profile	into	an anonymous	one	no	matter	how	many	tweaks	you	make.	Changing	the name	will	do	nothing.	The	algorithm	 think	of	the	sentinels	from	The Matrix 	will	still	have	records	of	your	online	behavior	as	well	as	your	IP address.	Privacy,	however,	is	obtainable,	in	case	you	wish	to	shield	your identity	from	nosy	coworkers	or	other	misfits.	In	this	case	you	need	to change	your	username,	that	part	of	the	profile	others	see	then	tweak	the privacy	settings	accordingly	with	how	invisible	you	wish	to	be.	It	is	a	bit of	a	double-edged	sword	since	this	will	make	it	harder	for	others	to	see you—those	you	may	 wish	to	see	you.	You’ll	have	to	seek	them	out yourself	and	add	them.	And	this,	too,	can	reveal	your	true	identity. Nothing	typed	into	Facebook	is	ever	truly	invisible	from	the	bots	at	their disposal.   Tails Edward	Snowden.	The	name	rings	a	bell	for	most	people	around	the globe.	In	tech	circles	he	is	a	visionary.	As	for	the	non-techies,	a	few	labels come	to	mind:	Whistleblower.	Hero.	Traitor.	Regardless	of	what	you	pin him	with,	one	thing	is	certain:	He	hates	censorship	and	loves	anonymity, the	kind	of	anonymity	that	calls	for	untrackable	execution.	Before discussing	anything,	he	insisted	liaisons	use	not	only	PGP	 pretty	good privacy 	but	the	end-all-be-all	of	anonymity	tools: Tails It	is	a	simple	tool	that	frustrates	even	those	in	the	upper	echelon	of the	NSA.	And	for	good	reason,	since	even	they	do	not	know	the	wizard who	designed	it. Where	Tor	is	the	worm	of	the	anonymous	fisherman,	Tails	is	the fishing	box.	The	fish	at	the	other	end	have	no	idea	who	is	inside	the	boat, watching,	listening.	It’s	a	hacker’s	tool	but	also	a	patriot	weapon.	Using	it is	a	breeze:	install	it	on	a	USB	stick,	CD,	whatever,	boot	from	said	stick and	find	yourself	cloaked	and	shielded	from	the	NSA,	provided	that	you don’t	out	yourself.	And	if	you’re	using	Tails,	you’re	smarter	than	that anyway.Built	upon	the	shell	of	Linux,	it	acts	as	an	operating	system	and comes	with	an	assortment	of	nukes	to	launch	under	Big	Brother’s	nose: Tor	browser,	chat	client,	email,	office	suite	and	image sound	editor, among	others. Snowden	preferred	Tails	on	account	of	its	no-write	rule:	no	direct data	writing.	A	breach	from	a	remote	adversary?	Not	going	to	happen. Forensics	investigation?	Nope.	No	trace	is	going	to	be	left	on	the DVD USB.	Obviously	this	is	a	no	brainer	to	use	if	you’re	an	NSA	employee looking	to	spill	the	beans	on	unconstitutional	spying,	as	well	as	a	must- have	for	political	dissidents	and	journalists.	It	is	armored	with	plausible deniability,	the	same	as	Truecrypt. Tor	runs	like	warm	butter	when	you	boot	with	Tails.	There’s	not much	of	a	learning	curve,	and	no	excessive	tweaking	required.	You	can   use	it	in	the	same	PC	you	use	at	work.	Boot	from	USB	or	DVD.	Do	your thing	then	reboot	back	into	your	normal	PC	with	no	record	or	footprint of	your	Tailing.	For	all	intents,	you’re	a	ghost	on	the	internet.	And speaking	of	ghosts,	the	creators	of	Tails	are	anonymous	themselves.	No one	knows	their	identities.	But	what	we	do	know	is	that	they	will	not bow	to	governments	trying	to	muscle	a	backdoor	into	the	code. Linus	Torvalds,	creator	of	Linux,	said	in	2013,	“The	NSA	has	been pressuring	free	software	projects	and	developers	in	various	ways,” implying	that	they	had	made	the	effort,	and	all	with	taxpayer	funds.	A	bit like	the	cat	saying	to	the	mouse,	“Transparency	is	good	for	you.	Sleep	out in	the	open	and	not	the	damp	and	dark,	flea-infested	mousehole.”	They don’t	like	secrets. You	might	be	asking,	how	do	we	know	that	Tails	does	not	already have	a	backdoor?	How	do	we	know	that	the	NSA	has	not	already	greased their	hands?	The	evidence	is	twofold:	the	code	is	open-source	 anyone can	audit	it ,	and	the	mere	fact	that	the	NSA	made	an	effort	to	sideline end-users	says	they	fear	such	a	powerful	package.	They	cannot	peer inside	to	see	what	the	mice	are	doing.	Snowden	claimed	that	the	NSA, while	he	was	with	them,	was	a	major	thorn	in	the	side	of	that organization. At	the	time	of	Tails	conception	five	years	ago,	the	interest	had already	started	to	build	up	in	the	Tor	community	for	a	more	cohesive toolbox.	“At	that	time	some	of	us	were	already	Tor	enthusiasts	and	had been	involved	in	free	software	communities	for	years,”	they	said.	“But	we felt	that	something	was	missing	to	the	panorama:	a	toolbox	that	would bring	all	the	essential	privacy	enhancing	technologies	together	and	made them	ready	to	use	and	accessible	to	a	larger	public.” PGP	is	also	included	in	package.	You	owe	it	to	yourself	and	peace	of mind	to	learn	it.	Spend	a	Sunday	with	it	and	you’ll	be	a	competent	user. Spend	a	week	and	you’ll	be	an	enthusiast. As	well,	KeePassX	can	be	useful	if	you	want	to	store	different	info  usernames,	pass	phrases,	sites,	comments 	into	one	database.	These	two are	like	a	good	set	of	gauntlets	no	aspiring	black	knight	would	do without.	And	don’t	think	the	blacksmiths	have	just	smelted	down	some cheap	metal,	either.	The	designers	have	gone	to	a	lot	of	trouble	to	modify the	privacy	and	security	settings.	The	more	they	do,	the	less	you	have	to.   This	is	not	to	say	you	should	use	Tails	every	day.	Only	use	it	in	those times	you	feel	anonymity	is	warranted.	As	mentioned	before,	if	you	start mixing	up	services,	operating	systems	and	mac	addresses,	you	may	blow your	cover.	Though	Tails	is	packaged	with	programs	that	one	wouldn’t normally	associate	with	anonymity	 GIMP,	OpenOffice,	Audacity,	etc 	you don’t	want	to	leak	info	where	an	adversary	might	build	a	profile	on	you. You’d	be	shocked	at	how	many	applications	these	days	“dial	home” without	your	knowledge	 hint:	almost	all	of	them . But	the	true	Achilles	heel	is	the	 metadata.	Tails	is	really	lousy	at hiding	it.	It	doesn’t	try	to.	It	doesn’t	clear	any	of	it	nor	does	it	encrypt	the headers	of	your	encrypted	emails.	Are	you	an	ebook	author?	Be	careful about	PDFs	and	.mobi	files,	as	depending	on	which	software	you	use,	it can	store	the	author’s	name	and	creation	date	of	your	work.	But	this	is not	really	the	fault	of	Tails.	Rather,	it	is	the	wishes	of	the	development team	to	stay	compatible	with	the	SMTP	protocol. The	other	problem	with	metadata	is	pictures:	JPEGs,	TIFF,	BITMAPS and	so	on,	which	again,	depending	on	the	software,	can	store	EXIF	data— data	that	stores	the	date	the	picture	was	taken	as	well	as	the	GPS coordinates	of	the	image.	Newer	cameras	and	mobile	phones	like Samsung	Galaxy	are	notorious	for	this,	and	even	keep	a	thumbnail	of	the EXIF	data	intact	for	nose	parkers	with	nothing	to	do	all	day	but	to	sniff through	other	people’s	property.	A	fake	GPS	spoofer	may	be	useful	but even	that	won’t	eliminate	the	exif	data.	You’ll	need	a	separate	app	for this.	You	might	even	go	so	far	as	to	only	use	formats	that	don’t	store	any metadata	at	all.	Plain-text	is	one	option,	though	even	that	can	be watermarked. You	might	think,	“Can	I	hide	Tails	activity?”	The	short	answer	is: maybe.	It	depends	on	the	resources	of	the	adversary.	And	just	who	is	the adversary?	The	government?	The	private	detective?	The	employer?	The fingerprint	Tails	leaves	is	far	less	visible	than	what	Tor	leaves.	And	yes,	it is	possible	for	an	administrator	to	see	you	are	using	Tor,	as	well	as	your ISP.	They	cannot	tell	what	you’re	doing	on	Tor,	mind	you,	but	there	are Tor	Browser	Bundle	users,	and	Tails	users.	It	all	comes	down	to	the	sites you	visit.We’ve	seen	how	they	can	build	a	profile	on	you	from	your resolution,	window	metrics,	addons	and	extensions	and	time	zones	and   fonts,	but	to	alleviate	this	the	Tails	developers	have	tried	to	make everyone	look	the	same,	as	if	they	were	all	wearing	white	Stormtrooper armor.	Some	fall	through	the	cracks,	making	themselves	easier	for	a correlation	attack	by	installing	too	many	addons	and	thus	marking themselves	in	the	herd:	A	purple-colored	stormtrooper,	if	you	will.	Such and	such	user	has	a	nice	font	enhancer	while	no	other	user	does.	This alone	does	not	break	anonymity,	but	with	a	hundred	other	factors	and sufficient	resources,	it	might	be	the	one	detail	that	breaks	the	house	of cards.	Death	by	a	thousand	stings. You	might	find	Tor	bridges	 alternative	entry	points	on	Tor 	to	be	a good	investment	in	reading,	as	they	can	better	hide	you	from	your	ISP.	In fact,	using	a	bridge	makes	it	considerably	harder	for	your	ISP	to	even know	you	are	using	Tor.	If	you	decide	this	route	 and	you	should	if merely	using	Tor	can	get	you	arrested—	a	case	in	which	you	should	NOT use	the	default	Tor	configuration ,	the	bridge	address	must	be	known. Be	mindful	of	the	fact	that	a	few	bridges	can	be	obtained	on	the	Tor website.	If	you	know	about	it,	others	do	too—even	adversaries	like	the NSA,	but	it	is	still	stronger	for	anonymity	purposes	than	the	default	Tor config.	Like	Freenet,	it	would	be	optimal	if	you	personally	know	someone in	a	country	outside	the	USA	who	runs	a	private	obfuscated	bridge	that has	the	option	 PublishServerDescriptor	 0.	As	always,	luck	favors	the prepared.   How	to	Defeat	the	NSA It	needs	to	be	said:	The	time	is	nigh	for	the	NSA	to	dissolve.	If	not dissolved,	then	at	least	broken	up	as	Nazi	Germany	was	after	WWII.	Yeah I	hear	your	eyes	rolling.	Comparing	the	Nazis	again?	Please. But	mission	creep,	the	expansion	of	a	project	beyond	its	original goals	 often	after	initial	successes 	has	reared	its	ugly	head	once	again	as the	NSA,	once	known	as	“No	Such	Agency”,	has	far	surpassed	its	original purpose:	to	secure	American	communications	while	gathering	intel	on our	enemies.	Unfortunately,	it	seems	we	have	become	the	enemy.	We,	the path	of	least	resistance,	so	to	speak. Intelligence	gathering	is	now	such	a	high	priority	to	the	NSA	that	it has	gone	global	at	the	expense	of	sovereign	security.	The	Tailored	Access Operations	 Install spyware backdoors	on	the	enemy’s	computers…	well	and	good	until Snowden	revealed	that	they	do	the	same	to	their	own	countrymen.	It’s called	bulk	surveillance.	The	more	data	they	have,	the	louder	they	are	on claiming	victory	over	the	usual	boogeymen:	Terrorists.	Drug	lords.	 how long	was	it	to	catch	Bin	Laden? .	Emails,	calls,	even	video	is	collected without	your	consent.	You	could	say	it	is	a	system	ripe	for	abuse,	if	it were	not	already	rotting	from	the	inside	out	due	to	the	Patriot	Act  section	215 .	The	very	notion	that	the	NSA	can	shield	itself	from Congress	and	the	taxpayers	who	foot	the	bill	should	appall	most Americans. So,	what	to	do	when	the	mother	eagle	turns	on	her	chicks?	Answer: Build	your	own	nest.	First	things	first,	however.	Understand	that	if	you are	a	high	value	target	like	Bin	Laden	or	a	Mafia	don,	the	NSA	will	hack your	internet-connected	computer	or	phone	regardless.	There’s	no getting	around	it.	If	you’re	thinking,	“Well,	I	paid	a	hundred	clams	for Drivecrypt	and	Phonecrypt	and	so	it	is	safe	from	those	hucksters,”	there is	some	bad	news	for	you	to	swallow,	cowboy.	It	is	far	from	safe. Drivecrypt	 is	 commercial	 software	 and	 closed-source,	 and considering	the	free	offerings	out	there	 Truecrypt—open-source	and  directive	 makes	  obvious.	   TAO 	  this	   audited ,	the	best	case	would	be	that	you’re	only	paying	for	the	name. Worst	case?	The	NSA	has	a	backdoor	within	the	code,	or	at	least	knows	of an	exploit	no	one	else	knows	about.	You	can	thank	the	NSA’s	BULLRUN program,	which	attempts	to	“insert	vulnerabilities	into	commercial encryption	systems,	IT	systems,	networks	and	endpoint	communication devices.” In	an	ideal,	pro-Constitution	country,	the	security	of	the	citizenry against	foreign	threats	would	be	priority	one.	Instead,	we	are	faced	with a	well-funded	behemoth	that	considers	the	monitoring	and	data	farming of	citizens	priority	one.	Again,	think	“least	resistance”.	Hacked	accounts from	Blizzard	to	Kickstarter	to	Yahoo	occur	every	month	and	the	NSA seems	helpless	to	stop	it.	Only	the	truth	is	a	little	different	than	they	led us	to	believe. They	do	have	the	means	to	stop	it,	as	it	turns	out.	But	it	would require	a	significant	rerouting	of	resources	so	that	citizens	are	protected and	not	monitored	and	assumed	guilty	of	some	obscure	crime.	Worse, the	positions	of	authority	and	influence	are	unbalanced	and	skewed. Cyber	Command	should	not	be	integrated	with	NSA	priorities	at	all.	Their priorities	should	be	focused	abroad,	like	all	other	military	operations,	and not	focused	on	citizens	like	some	Eye	of	Sauron	that	creates	crime	out	of thin	air.Luckily,	a	few	have	leaked	enough	data	from	the	NSA’s	coffers	to mount	a	counteroffensive.	One	man	cannot	undo	the	damage	they’ve done,	but	a	nation	can:	the	millions	can	overpower	their	overreach	and send	them	back	to	their	proper	place. How? Knowledge	is	power.	This	hardly	changes	over	time	and	for	the	NSA, the	knowledge	resides	in	the	network	itself.	That’s	where	the	NSA	loves to	probe	and	plant	their	bugs.	To	this,	they	farm	all	the	data.	Everything. Then	hire	analysts	to	sort	it	all.	They	monitor	phone	calls,	satellite messages	and	even	listen	to	the	oceanic	cables	running	to	and	fro	to	our allies.	They	tap	the	waterfall	at	the	source,	high	above,	or	beneath	our feet	if	need	be.	Good	intel,	ripe	for	the	sifting. But	what	is	good	intel	to	them?	Well,	it’s	whatever	sets	off	the	most flags:	the	people	involved,	their	countries,	the	language	they	use,	their religion.	It	all	gets	prioritized	based	on	profiles	their	algo	agents   categorize.	The	more	red	flags,	the	higher	up	the	totem	pole	it	goes…	into a	wellspring	of	metadata.	It	is	easier	to	cherry	pick	targets	by	examining metadata	than	to	study	complete	emails	and	conversations.	It	saves	time. It	saves	money.	Metadata	to	the	NSA	is	like	cocaine	to	a	drug	dealer.	It’s valuable	stuff. The	Systems	Intelligence	Directorate	does	the	data	sifting	and sorting	in	this	case,	and	is	given	billions	by	Congress	to	optimize	its operations	every	year.	They	are	always	updating	and	honing	their capabilities.	Testing	what	works	and	what	doesn’t.	A	security	group exists	for	each	directive	handed	down	by	the	brass.	They	do	nothing	but look	for	ways	to	streamline	each	infiltration	tactic.	Make	it	all	blood simple	with	the	push	of	a	button,	a	button	that	has	global	outreach. NSA	agents	can	infiltrate	at	will,	but	they	especially	love	non- updated	hardware	like	routers.	When	was	the	last	time	you	updated your	router	encryption	key?	Right.	The	NSA	knows	this	as	well.	They have	a	backdoor	for	many	of	them	and	entire	teams	devoted	24 7	to finding	exploits	for	every	brand	of	router	and	password	encryption is	 all	 accomplished	 by	 the	 TAO	  Tailored	 Access scheme.	 This	 Operations .	Once	inside	your	PC,	they	can	easily	install	a	custom-made keylogger	that	records	your	keystrokes	and	will	send	them	quietly	under the	radar.	Your	anti-virus	will	not	detect	it.	Once	this	is	done,	it	doesn’t matter	how	complex	your	password	is.	Thus,	it	is	easy	to	see	how valuable	prevention	is. But	how	does	one	prevent	such	an	intrusion	from	a	well-funded entity?	The	answer	is	encryption.	Encrypt	your	email.	Your	data.	Your boot	pass	phrase.	Most	people	will	not	bother	with	email.	Some	might bother	with	data.	And	fewer	still	will	bother	with	encrypting	the	entire OS	as	it	can	take	hours	for	a	2TB	hard	drive. 	A	few	strict	security	suggestions: I 	The	NSA	does	not	like	Tor.	It’s	expensive	to	track	users.	When	a lot	of	money	is	asked	of	Congress,	they	start	asking	questions	and demanding	results.	They	don’t	want	anyone	asking	questions.	So	use	Tor. However,	do	not	say	anything	in	an	email	that	you	would	not	recover from	if	it	was	broadcasted	on	network	TV.	And	do	not	access	your normal	email	account	or	bank	account	using	Tor.	Can	you	see	why?   II. 	Invest	in	an	offline	netbook	or	laptop	for	mission	critical	data. Make	encrypted	backups:	Blu-Ray,	USB,	SD.	Never	allow	the	data	onto your	internet	PC	unless	in	encrypted	form:	Truecrypt	containers PGP encrypted,	 etc.	Only	decrypt	messages	offline	and	away	from	the internet.	Learn	about	SSL IPsec.	Many	Usenet	providers	offer	SSL	for free	but	leave	it	off	by	default.	Turn	it	on. III. 	Whenever	possible,	avoid	commercial	encryption	packages.	The proprietary	software	is	almost	never	audited,	unlike	Truecrypt.	What does	that	tell	you	when	they	are	afraid	of	people	looking	at	their	code? They’re	hiding	something	from	you.	When	an	encryption	program	is open-source,	it	is	more	secure,	not	less,	because	others	can	verify	its security	and	detect	any	back	doors.	Word	spreads	like	wildfire	when	a backdoor	is	discovered,	but	not	if	the	door	is	nailed	shut	from	the	other side.IV. 	Your	screen	lock	does	not	have	to	be	perfect.	It	won’t	keep	out any	government	agents	but	it	may	keep	out	nosy	wives	and	friends.	If however	the	OS	is	not	encrypted	and	your	laptop	is	stolen,	all	your	data is	theirs	for	the	taking.	Use	an	open-source	app	like	Password	Safe	to secure	them	all	from	prying	eyes. 	You’re	probably	thinking,	why	do	you	need	all	of	these	tools	for privacy?	Shouldn’t	Truecrypt	or	SSL	for	your	Usenet	be	enough?	The short	answer	is:	it	depends.	It	depends	on	your	own	level	of	risk.	What you	can	live	with	if	all	is	lost.	And	your	loss	is	the	NSA’s	gain,	through threats	of	lawsuits	and	coercions	and	unconstitutional	spying.	They’ve almost	succeeded	in	turning	the	web	into	a	vast	Orwellian	looking	glass —	with	themselves	as	the	only	keymasters.	They	can	only	succeed	if good	men	do	nothing. Trust	encryption	like	you	trust	ammunition.	And	like	ammunition,	it can	be	learned	in	a	weekend.	Mastery	however	takes	some	time	and effort,	but	know	that	by	itself,	it	will	do	nothing	but	allow	tyranny	to flourish	unless	used	for	its	original	purpose. 	Endgame 	Hopefully	if	you	have	read	this	far,	then	you	are	now	aware	of	some   of	the	dangers	that	await	us	in	the	future.	Clearly,	having	an	exposed	IP address	is	only	a	drop	in	the	ocean	next	to	the	coming	power	grab. Unfortunately,	there	are	always	going	to	be	up	and	coming	social networks	and	applications	that	try	to	go	above	and	beyond	the	use	of	the IP	address	to	monitor	you.	We	have	seen	it	happen	with	many	personal applications	over	the	years:	Internet	Explorer,	Napster,	Limewire, Myspace,	Facebook	and	the	like. These	make	their	profits	by	subverting	your	personal	choices	and then	targeting	you	based	on	those	choices,	and	when	you	get	right	down to	it,	the	longer	you	put	off	protecting	your	individuality,	the	less	choice you	will	have	in	the	long	run.	However,	you	now	have	at	least	an	effective arsenal	of	tools	in	which	to	minimize	this	subversion.	If	enough	people take	notice,	it	may	stem	or	even	reverse	the	tide	of	fascism	coming	over the	hills.More	and	more	we	are	seeing	a	gradual	erosion	of	privacy.	Some employers	reject	applicants	to	entry	level	positions	based	on	credit score.	Some	employers	demand	Facebook	usernames	and	passwords before	hire.	Some	fire	employees	for	words	on	a	Facebook	post.	In	the end	it	is	all	about	control	and	eroding	individual	choice.	For	there	is	no one	in	the	universe	more	unique	than	you.	You	are	worth	more	than	all the	stars	combined,	and	they	know	it.	And	want	to	control	it.	And	there	is no	such	thing	as	controlling	just	a	little	bit	of	a	star. Stay	safe,	always.   Tor	&	the	Dark	Art	of	Anonymity   Table	of	Content  Is	Tor	Safe?

But	what	I	thought	I	knew about	Tor	and	other	incognito	tools	was	only	a	drop	in	the	ocean	next	to what’s	really	out	there.	Stuff	you	don’t	find	on	many	tech	forums.	They’re whispered	in	private,	of	course,	and	it’s	all	been	rather	invisible	to	you unless	you	hang	out	in	hacker	forums	or	Usenet.	That	is,	until	now. Which	brings	us	to	you	and	I,	or	rather	what	I	can	do	for	you.	It’s amazing	what	a	guy	can	learn	in	a	decade	when	he	rolls	his	sleeves	up and	gets	his	hands	dirty.	Private	hacker	forums.	Usenet.	Freenet.	I scoured	them	all	for	years	and	what	I’ve	learned	isn’t	anywhere	else	on Amazon.Equally	amazing	is	what	you	can	learn	for	a	few	dollars	in	a weekend’s	worth	of	reading.	That’s	me,	and	soon	to	be	you.	Where	you will	be	by	Monday	is	where	I	am	now,	only	without	the	years	of	mistakes. Mistakes	I	made	using	Freenet,	Tails,	PGP.	You	name	it,	I	did	it.	And	boy did	I	make	big	ones:	mistakes	you’ll	avoid	because	after	you	read	this guide,	you’ll	know	more	than	85%	of	the	Tor	users	out	there,	and	know more	about	anonymity	than	most	Federal	agents.	Yes,	even	the	so-called super	hackers	at	the	NSA. If	you	don’t	come	away	satisfied,	return	it	for	a	full	refund. But	I	know	you	won’t.	Because	once	you’ve	taken	the	red	pill,	there ain’t	no	going	back.	You	can’t	unlearn	what	you’ve	learned,	unsee	what you’ve	seen,	and	you’ll	want	more.	Much,	much	more. First	off,	we’re	not	sticking	with	the	basics	here.	If	all	you	want	is Tor	for	Dummies,	look	elsewhere.	Where	we’re	going	is	dangerous territory.	It’s	shark	territory	when	you	get	right	down	to	it.	But	not	to worry.	We’ve	got	shark	repellant	and	everything	you	need	to	surf	safe. You’ll	reap	benefits	you’ve	only	dreamed	of	and	by	the	time	we’re	done, you’ll	 have	 gained	 NSA-level	 anonymity	 skills	 with	 a	 counter-   surveillance	mindset	that	rivals	anything	Anonymous	or	those	goons	at the	NSA	can	counter	with. Speaking	of	which,	they	won’t	have	a	clue	as	to	how	to	find	you. Secondly,	for	a	few	dollars	you	will	know	every	exploit	those superhackers	like	to	wield	against	Tor	users	and	more:	How	to	avoid NSA	tracking.	Bitcoin	anonymity	 real	anonymity ,	opsec	advice	and Darknet	markets	and	Darkcoins	and,	well,	it’s	a	long	list	frankly	but	by the	time	you’re	done	you’ll	be	a	Darknet	 artist	when	it	comes	to marketplaces	and	buying	things	incognito. Third,	we’ll	go	over	many	techniques	used	by	the	CIA	and	FBI	to entrap	users.	False	confessions.	Clickbait.	Tor	honeypots.	It’s	all	the same.	You’ll	learn	the	same	techniques	used	to	catch	terrorists,	hackers and	the	group	Anonymous	and	couriers	for	Reloaded.	Baits	and	Lures and	how	to	spot	an	LEA	agent	from	a	mile	away.	I	break	it	all	down	into simple	steps	that	you	can	understand.	A	few	dollars	for	this	info	will	save you	a	lifetime	of	grief.	No,	you	won’t	find	it	on	Reddit	or	Ars	Technica	or Wired.	If	you’re	mulling	this	over,	don’t.	You	need	this	now,	not	when you’re	framed	for	something	you	didn’t	do. Fourth…	reading	the	dangerous	material	herein	requires	you	take action.The	Feds	take	action.	Identity	thieves	take	action.	Hackers	take action.	Will	you?	Make	no	mistake	-	This	is	not	a	mere	guide.	It	is	a mindset.	It’s	professional	level	stuff	meant	to	keep	you	and	your	family safe	for	a	decade	out,	going	far	beyond	apps	and	proxies.	And	it’s	all yours	if	you	do	two	simple	things:	You	read,	then	act.	Simple.	Because you	know	what	they	say:	Knowledge	is	power. No,	strike	that.	Knowledge	is	potential	power.	Your	power.	But	only if	you	act. Fifth…	I	update	this	book	every	month.	New	browser	exploit	in	the wild?	I	update	it	here.	New	technique	for	uncloaking	Tor	users?	You’ll read	it	here	first.	We	all	know	how	Truecrypt	is	Not	Safe	Anymore,	but that’s	only	the	beginning. Besides,	freedom	isn’t	free. Lastly…	The	scene	from	Jurassic	Park	with	Dennis	Nedry,	I	believe, is	a	nice	frightful	analogy	to	what	happens	if	you	don’t	take	your	security seriously.	We	see	poor	Dennis	try	to	get	his	jeep	out	of	the	muck	in	the   middle	of	a	tropical	storm.	Lightning	unzips	the	sky	and	the	rain	pours. The	thunder	rolls.	A	dilophosaur	bounds	upon	him,	beautiful,	yet	painted across	his	ugly	mug	is	a	deadly	curiosity	as	it	sniffs	the	air	and	cocks	it’s head	at	Nedry	-	moments	before	spraying	his	chubby	eyes	with	poison. Blinded,	he	staggers	back	to	the	safety	of	the	jeep,	wailing	and	gnashing teeth,	only	to	discover	a	visual	horror	to	his	right:	he’s	left	the	passenger- side	door	ajar	-	wide	enough	to	let	Mr.	Curious	in	for	a	juicy	evening	meal -	which	it	savors	with	a	row	of	sharp	teeth. The	point	is	this:	Don’t	be	Dennis	Nedry.	There	are	far	bigger creatures	who’d	like	nothing	better	than	to	split	your	life	 and	family  wide	open	if	for	no	other	reason	than	they	can.	Such	is	the	nature	of	the elite.Unless,	of	course,	you	tame	them…  Not	bloody	likely.   One Is	Tor	safe?  That	seems	to	be	the	question	alright.	And	to	that,	well,	it	really depends	on	whom	you	ask	because	there	are	always	wolves	in	sheep’s clothing	out	there	who	stand	to	gain	from	a	man’s	ignorance.	Many	say no.	A	few	will	say	yes,	that	it’s	‘safe	enough’.	The	media,	for	all	their expertise	in	things	political	and	social,	come	up	woefully	lacking	when something	as	complex	as	Tor	is	discussed	and	get	a	lot	of	things	wrong. Case	in	point.	Gizmodo	reported	that	in	December,	2014,	a	group	of hackers	managed	to	compromise	enough	Tor	relays	to	de-cloak	Tor users.	If	you’re	just	hearing	this	for	the	first	time,	part	of	what	makes	Tor anonymous	is	that	it	relays	your	data	from	one	node	to	another.	It	was believed	that	if	they	compromised	enough	of	them,	then	they	could	track individual	users	on	the	Tor	network	and	reveal	their	real	life	identities. Kind	of	like	how	the	agents	in	The	Matrix	find	those	who’ve	been unplugged. Anyway	as	luck	would	have	it,	it	turned	out	to	be	kiddie	script- hackers	with	too	much	time	on	their	hands	who	simply	wanted	a	new target	to	hack.	Who	knows	why.	Could	be	that	they’d	toyed	with	the Playstation	Network	and	Xbox	users	long	enough	and	simply	wanted	a curious	peak	here	and	there.	These	were	not	superhackers. But	as	is	usually	the	case	with	the	media,	this	attack	attracted	the attention	of	a	few	bloggers	and	tech	journalists	unsympathetic	to	Tor and	frankly,	ignorant	of	what	really	constitutes	a	threat.	The	Tor	devs commented	on	it,	too:  “This	looks	like	a	regular	attempt	at	a	Sybil	attack:	the	attackers	have signed	 up	 many	 new	 relays	 in	 hopes	 of	 becoming	 a	 large	 fraction	 of	 the network.	But	even	though	they	are	running	thousands	of	new	relays,	their relays	currently	make	up	less	than	1%	of	the	Tor	network	by	capacity.	We are	 working	 now	 to	 remove	 these	 relays	 from	 the	 network	 before	 they become	 a	 threat,	 and	 we	 don’t	 expect	 any	 anonymity	 or	 performance effects	based	on	what	we’ve	seen	so	far.”   What	those	conspiracy	bloggers	failed	to	report	was	that	any decentralized	network	like	Tor	is	a	prime	target	for	attacks	such	as	the above.	But	to	truly	stand	a	chance	at	punching	a	hole	through	this	matrix, hackers	would	need	Tor	to	implicitly	trust	every	new	node	that	comes online.	That	doesn’t	happen. It	also	takes	time	for	fresh	relays	to	gather	traffic	-	some	as	long	as sixty	days	or	more	and	the	 likelihood	of	being	reported	is	rather	high since	the	IP	addresses	are	out	in	the	open	-	which	only	speeds	up malicious	reporting.	The	 real	danger,	and	has	been	since	inception,	is scaring	Tor	users	to	less	secure	methods	of	communication.	That’s	what the	NSA	wants.	The	CIA	already	does	this	in	foreign	countries.	Now	the NSA	is	following	their	lead.   Two Risks	of	Using	Tor  The	REAL	Risk	of	Using	Tor 	I	list	them	here	before	we	dive	deep	into	enemy	territory	so	you’ll know	what	to	avoid	before	installation,	and	maybe	get	an	“a-ha!” moment	in	subsequent	chapters.	As	you	read,	remember	that	having Javascript	on	is	really	only	a	drop	in	the	ocean	next	to	what	is	possible for	an	enemy	to	kill	your	anonymity. Javascript It’s	widely	known	that	leaving	Javascript	on	is	bad	for	a	Tor	user. Ninety-five	percent	of	us	know	this,	but	the	mistakes	of	the	5%	get	blown out	of	proportion	and	thrown	into	the	face	of	the	rest	of	us.	Worse,	many websites	now	run	so	many	scripts	that	it	seems	as	though	they	hate	Tor users.One	site	required	over	a	dozen.	Without	it,	the	page	was is will	be pretty	much	gimped.	Sometimes	not	even	 readable.	You	can	imagine what	might	happen	if	you	were	using	Tor	and	decided	to	visit	that	site	if it	was	set	up	to	lure	users	into	a	honeypot. I	remember	one	researcher	claimed	that	“81%	of	Tor	users	can	be de-anonymised.” Bull.That	81%	figure	came	about	because	the	targeted	users	knew	little about	the	NoScript	browser	add-on,	and	likely	mixed	Tor	usage	with their	daily	open	net	usage,	providing	ample	data	for	a	correlation	attack. But	that	was	just	the	icing	on	the	cake.	They	left	personal	details everywhere	-	using	the	same	usernames	and	passes	they	do	elsewhere	on the	open	net.	Bragging	about	their	favorite	Netflix	movies.	Talking	about local	events	 Jazzfest	in	New	Orleans! .	The	weather	 Hurricane	in	the French	Quarter! .	You	get	the	idea. 	Volunteering	as	an	Exit	Node   Another	doozy,	though	not	quite	the	granddaddy	of	all	risks,	but	still risky.	On	the	plus	side,	you	as	a	valiant	believer	in	anonymity	graciously provide	bandwidth	and	an	“exit	pipe”	to	the	rest	of	the	Tor	users  hopefully	none	of	whom	you	know 	so	that	they	may	pass	their encrypted	traffic	through	your	node.	Generous?	Certainly.	Wise?	If	you live	in	the	States…	hale	no	as	my	Uncle	Frick	in	Texas	used	to	say. It	isn’t	that	it	is	illegal	 per	 se	to	do	so.	On	the	contrary,	but	what passes	through	your	node	can	land	you	in	hot	water	if	you	live	in	a	police state.	All	exiting	traffic	from	your	node	 i.e.	other	people’s	traffic 	is	tied to	your	IP	address	and	as	others	have	found,	you	put	yourself	at	risk	by what	others	on	the	other	side	of	the	planet	do	with	your	node. Lots	of	new	Tor	users	fire	up	BitTorrent	configured	for	Tor	and	suck down	all	the	bandwidth.	It	makes	for	a	very	miserable	Tor	experience	for other	users.	You	may	get	served	with	a	copyright	violation	notice	 or sued ,	or	perhaps	raided	if	child	porn	flows	out	of	your	pipes.	Think carefully	and	do	your	research	before	taking	on	such	a	risky	charge,	lest your	computer	be	seized	and	your	reputation	ruined. 	Running	an	Exit	Relay	From	Home 	Running	it	from	home	is	even	worse	then	using	cloud	storage,	and	is infinitely	dangerous	in	the	USA	and	UK.	If	the	law	for	whatever	reason has	an	interest	in	your	Tor	traffic,	your	PC	might	be	seized,	yes,	but	that’s only	the	start.	In	the	UK,	there	is	no	5th	amendment	protection	against self-incrimination.	A	crusty	old	judge	can	give	you	two	years	just	for	not forking	over	the	encryption	keys	 which	if	they	had,	they	would	not	have bothered	raiding	at	6AM . Use	a	host	instead	that	supports	Tor.	There	is	Sealandhosting.org, for	one.	They	accept	Bitcoins	and	do	not	require	any	personal	info,	only an	email.	They	offer	Socks,	Dedicated	Servers,	Tor	Hosting	and	VPS	as well	as	Domains. We’ll	get	into	the	nitty	details	later,	but	these	are	the	Rules	I’ve	set for	myself: -	Refrain	from	routing	normal	traffic	through	it -	Never	do	anything	illegal	 more	later	as	it’s	a	grey	area  -	Never	put	sensitive	files	on	it	 financial	info,	love	notes,	court	docs    -	Be	as	transparent	as	possible	that	I’m	running	an	exit 	Intelligence	Agencies They’ve	declared	war	on	Tor	and	its	stealth	capabilities,	no	doubt about	it.	And	though	they	will	fight	tooth	and	nail	to	convince	you	it	is	for your	own	good,	really	what	it	all	comes	down	to	isn’t	so	much	national security	as	it	is	national	control:	Control	over	you	in	that	they	know	not what	you’re	doing	on	Tor,	nor	why. They	don’t	like	that. It’s	quite	pompous	of	them	to	spend	so	much	money	and	waste	so much	time	chasing	you	simply	because	they	don’t	like	you	or	your actions	not	being	easily	identifiable. As	you	probably	know,	it’s	more	costly	to	go	after	a	high-value target.	But	they	do	not	know	if	you	are	a	high-value	target	or	merely	low- hanging	fruit.	As	we’ve	seen	in	the	case	of	bored	Harvard	students, anyone	can	get	into	serious	trouble	if	they	go	into	Tor	blind	as	a	bat. Even	Eric	Holder	has	publicly	pointed	out	that	Tor	users	are	labeled as	“non-US	persons”	until	identified	as	citizens.	It’s	beyond	pompous.	It’s criminal	and	unconstitutional.	It	sounds	as	if	they	view	ALL	Tor	users	as high-value	targets. And	by	the	time	you	are	identified	as	such,	they	have	acquired enough	power	to	strip	you	as	well	as	millions	of	other	citizens	of	their rights	to	privacy	and	protection	under	the	Fourth	Amendment	of	the Constitution. They	do	this	using	two	methods: 	The	Quantum	and	FoxAcid	System 	Here	is	the	gist	of	it: -	Both	systems	depend	on	secret	arrangements	made	with	telcos -	Both	involve	lulling	the	user	into	a	false	sense	of	security -	Neither	system	can	make	changes	to	a	LiveCD	 Tails  -	Both	can	be	defeated	by	adhering	to	consistent	security	habits. Defeating	 this	 requires	 a	 mindset	 of	 diligence.	 DO	 NOT procrastinate.	Decide	ahead	of	time	to	avoid	risky	behavior.	We’ll	get	to them	all.	A	good,	security	mindset	takes	time	and	effort	and	commitment   to	develop	but	should	be	nurtured	from	the	very	beginning,	which	is	why the	RISKS	are	placed	up	front,	ahead	of	even	the	installation	chapter. Things	tend	to	drag	in	the	middle	of	a	book	like	this,	and	are	often forgotten. Speaking	of	risk,	if	you	wonder	what	truly	keeps	me	up	at	night,	it’s this:	What	do	other	nations	tell	high-level	CEOs	and	Intelligence	agencies  Hong	Kong,	for	instance ? If	the	only	thing	I	can	trust	is	my	dusty	old	486	in	my	attic	with Ultima	7	still	installed	atop	my	28.8k	dialup	modem,	then	it’s	safe	to assume	every	commercial	entity	is	jeopardized	by	the	NSA.	And	if	that’s true,	if	the	NSA	has	to	jump	hoops	to	spy	on	us,	how	easy	is	it	to	infiltrate American-owned	systems	overseas	with	our	data	on	those	systems? To	that,	if	no	corporation	can	keep	their	private	info	under	wraps, then	eventually	the	endgame	may	evolve	into	a	Skynet	grid	similar	to	the Soviet-era	East West	block	in	which	CEOs	have	to	choose	east	or	west. But	that’s	like	trying	to	decide	whether	you	want	to	be	eaten	by	a	grizzly bear	or	a	lion. So	then,	you	now	know	the	real	risks.	The	main	ones,	anyway. Every	one	of	these	risks	can	be	minimized	or	outright	defeated	using knowledge	that	is	in	this	book.	The	sad	part	is	that	most	readers	will forget	roughly	80%	of	what	they	read.	Those	who	take	action	will	retain that	80%	because	they	are	making	what	they’ve	read	a	reality:	Making brilliant	chess-like	countermoves	when	the	NSA	threatens	your	Queen.	If you	do	not	take	action	,but	merely	sit	there	like	a	frog	in	a	slowly	boiling pot	of	water,	not	only	will	you	perish	but	your	future	generations	will	as well.	Alright	then.	Enough	of	the	risks.	Let’s	get	to	it.   Three A	Foolproof	Guide Or	As	Foolproof	As	We	Can	Get	It 	Now	let’s	answer	what	Tor	is	and	what	it	does	and	what	it	cannot	do. You’ve	no	doubt	heard	it	is	some	kind	of	hacker’s	tool,	and	you’d	be	right, but	only	from	the	perspective	that	a	powerful	tool	like	Tor	can	be	used for	just	about	anything.	In	fact	anything	can	be	bought	 except	maybe voluptuous	blondes	in	red	dresses 	anonymously…	as	long	as	you’re cautious	about	it. Before	you	knock	Tor,	remember	that	it	is	not	about	buying	drugs	or porn	or	exotic	white	tiger	cubs.	It’s	about	anonymous	communication and	privacy	-	with	the	main	function	being	to	grant	you	anonymity	by routing	your	browsing	session	from	one	Tor	relay	to	another—masking your	IP	address	such	that	websites	cannot	know	your	real	location. This	allows	you	to: -	Access	blocked	websites	 Facebook	if	you	are	in	China  -	Access	.onion	sites	that	are	unreachable	via	the	open	internet -	Threaten	the	president	with	a	pie-to-the-face…and	no	Secret Service	visit! It	does	all	of	this	by	a	process	called	onion	routing. Think	of	it	as	a	multi-point-to-point	proxy	matrix.	Unlike	peer	to peer	applications	like	BitTorrent	or	eMule	which	expose	your	IP	to everyone,	Tor	uses	a	series	of	intermediary	nodes	 and	thus,	IPs 	that encrypt	your	data	all	along	the	network	chain.	At	the	endpoint,	your	data is	decrypted	by	an	exit	node	so	that	no	one	can	pinpoint	your	location	or tell	which	file	came	from	which	computer.	Due	to	this	anonymizing process,	you	are	anonymous	on	account	of	the	packed	“onion	layers”	that hide	your	true	IP	address. It	is	even	possible	to	build	a	site	such	that	only	Tor	users	can	access it.	Also	called	“Onion	Sites,”	though	technically	challenging,	you	don’t need	a	Ph.D	in	computer	science	to	build	one.	Or	even	a	Bachelor’s   degree.	These	Onion	sites	are	unaccessible	by	anyone	using	the	regular web	and	regular,	non-Tor	Firefox. We’ll	delve	deeper	into	that	later,	as	well	as	construct	a	fortress	of doom	that	nothing	can	penetrate. 	Installation Installing	Tor	is	dirt	simple.	You	can	download	it	from	the	Tor website	at: https:  www.torproject.org download download-easy.html.en If	your	ISP	blocks	you	from	the	Tor	site,	do	this: -	Shoot	an	email	to	Tor.	Tell	them	the	situation.	You	can	get	an automated	message	sent	back	to	you	with	the	Tor	installation	package. -	Go	to	Google.	Do	a	search	for	any	cached	websites,	including	Tor, that	might	have	the	install	package	to	download.	Many	tech	sites	may just	have	it	in	the	event	of	all-out	nuclear	war. -	Visit	rt.torproject.org	and	ask	them	to	mirror	it. -	Get	a	friend	to	email	you	the	Tor	installation.	Ask	for	Tails,	too. -	VERIFY	the	signature	if	you	obtain	it	elsewhere	other	than	from the	main	Tor	site,	verify	it	even	if	your	friend	hand-delivers	it.	I’ve	gotten viruses	in	the	past	from	friend’s	sharing	what	they	thought	were	“clean” apps.Now	then.	Choose	Windows,	Linux	or	the	Mac	version	and	know that	your	default	Firefox	install	will	not	be	overwritten	unless	you	want it	to.	Both	use	Firefox	but	Tor	is	a	completely	separate	deal.	You’ll	notice it	has	the	same	functions	as	Firefox:	Tabs.	Bookmarks.	Search	box. Menus.	It’s	all	here	-	except	your	favorite	add-ons. On	that	point,	you	might	be	tempted	to	install	your	favorites.	Don’t give	in	to	that	temptation.	Multiple	add-ons	that	do	nothing	for	your anonymity	might	assist	someone	in	locating	you	over	Tor	by	what	is known	as	“Browser	fingerprinting.” 	Now	you’ve	got	some	choices. One	is	to	volunteer	your	bandwidth,	which	makes	it	easier	for	other Tor	users	but	comes	with	risk.	More	on	that	later	but	for	now	just	know that	every	page	you	visit	with	the	Tor	Browser	will	be	routed anonymously	through	the	Tor	network.   There	is	however	an	important	detail	you	need	to	know	concerning security,	and	that	is	that	your	Tor	settings	are	merely	reasonable	starting points.	They	are	not	optimal.	We’re	still	at	the	infancy	stage	and	quite frankly,	optimal	as	Tor	knows	optimal	is	largely	dependent	on	hardware  network,	CPU,	RAM,	VM,	VPN ,	and	so	each	person’s	setup	will	be different.   Four What	Tor	Cannot	Do Now	for	what	Tor	cannot	do,	or	at	least	cannot	do	very	well.	In	the future	this	may	change	so	don’t	fall	on	your	sword	just	yet. 1. 	Tor	cannot	protect	you	from	attachments. This	is	not	limited	to	executables	but	anything	that	can	be	run	by way	of	code.	This	means	Flash	videos	as	well	as	RealPlayer	and Quicktime,	if	you	still	use	it.	Those	babies	can	be	configured	to	send	your real	IP	address	to	an	adversary.	Not	good.	So	never	run	any	executable	or app	unless	you	trust	the	source.	If	at	all	possible,	go	 open-source.	This also	goes	for	any	encryption	scheme	which	you	MUST	use	if	you’re	going to	use	Tor.	It	is	NOT	an	option.	Some	say	it	is	but	that’s	like	saying learning	Thai	is	optional	if	you’re	going	to	live	in	Bangkok.	You	won’t	get far	that	way. 2. 	Tor	cannot	run	torrents	well. Old	news,	right?	Thousands	still	do	this.	Better	safe	than	sorry,	they claim.	The	only	problem	is	they	are	safe	and	everyone	else	is	sorry.	Tor cannot	do	P2P	apps	like	Emule	and	Limewire	without	making	everyone else’s	Tor	experience	miserable.	It	simply	sucks	down	too	much bandwidth.	In	addition	to	some	exit	nodes	blocking	such	traffic	by default,	it’s	been	proven	that	an	IP	address	can	be	found	by	using torrents	over	Tor.	eMule,	too,	uses	UDP	and	since	Tor	supports	TCP protocol,	you	can	draw	your	own	conclusions	about	what	that	does	to your	anonymity. True,	you	may	be	spared	a	copyright	lawsuit	since	the	RIAA	likely won’t	go	through	all	that	trouble	in	trying	to	get	your	IP,	but	please	spare other	Tor	users	the	madness	of	1998	modem	speeds.	A	VPN	is	a	much better	choice. 3. 	Tor	cannot	cloak	your	identity	if	you	are	tossing	your	real	email around	like	Mardi	Gras	beads.	If	you	give	your	true	email	on	websites while	using	Tor,	consider	your	anonymity	compromised.	Your	virtual identity	must	never	match	up	with	your	real-life	identity.	Ever.	Those   who	ignore	this	rule	get	hacked,	robbed,	arrested,	or	mauled	by	capped gremlins.	Much	more	on	this	later.   Five  Tor	Apps	&	Anti-Fingerprint	Tools The	Best	of	the	Best A	few	applications	make	Tor	less	of	a	headache,	but	they	are	not particularly	well	suited	for	desktop	users	unless	you’re	doing	some	kind of	emulation.	But	with	everyone	using	mobile	these	days,	some	of	these have	benefited	me	in	ways	I	never	thought	possible.	Be	sure	and	read	the comments	in	the	Play	Store	since	updates	tend	to	break	things. 	Orbot:	Proxy	with	Tor 	  It	is	a	proxy	app	that	runs	similar	to	the	desktop	app	and	encrypts your	net	traffic	and	protects	you	from	surveillance	and	fortifies	you against	traffic	analysis.	You	can	use	Orbot	with	Twitter,	DuckDuckGo	or any	app	with	a	proxy	feature.	I’ve	used	this	for	a	long	time	now	and	have gotten	used	to	it.	Perhaps	it	is	time	to	try	something	else.   	Invisibox	-	Privacy	Made	Easy 	Just	plug	the	InvizBox	into	your	existing	router	 	modem.	A	new “InvizBox”	wifi	hotspot	will	appear.	Connect	to	the	new	hotspot	and follow	the	one	time	configuration	set	up	and	you’re	ready	to	go.	All devices	that	you	connect	to	the	InvizBox	wifi	will	route	their	traffic	over the	Tor	Network. 	Text	Secure TextSecure	encrypts	every	message	on	your	mobile	phone	and	is simple	to	learn.	Better	still,	in	the	event	you	leave	your	phone	at	Marble Slab	 Marble	Flab	to	the	Mrs. ,	rest	assured	your	privacy	is	safe	due	to encryption.	It’s	also	open-source.	Far	too	many	apps	aren’t,	and	thus cannot	be	peer-reviewed	by,	well,	anyone,	unlike	some	proprietary	apps like	those	offered	by	SecurStar	 i.e.	Drivecrypt,	Phonecrypt . 	Red	Phone 	This	app	secures	every	call	with	end-to-end	encryption,	allowing you	privacy	and	peace	of	mind.	It	uses	WiFi	and	offers	neat	upgrades	if both	callers	have	RedPhone	installed. It’s	not	for	everyone.	Though	it’s	not	as	expensive	as	say,	TrustCall, there	are	convenience	issues	like	lengthy	connection	times	and	dropped calls	 ever	Skype	someone	from	Manila? 	so	it’s	not	going	to	be	as	quick and	dirty	as	Jason	Bourne	does	it. But	the	pluses	outweigh	the	minuses.	I	especially	love	the	two-word passphrase	as	a	security	feature:	If	you	fear	Agent	Boris	is	dead	and	has been	killed	by	Agent	Doris	 who	now	has	his	phone ,	you	can	request	she speak	the	second	passphrase.	Simple	yet	effective. 	Google	and	Tor What	does	Google	think	of	Tor?	Quite	honestly	I	suspect	they	try	not to. They	probably	don’t	hate	it	like	the	NSA	does,	but	they	know	that	if every	Google	user	used	Tor	on	a	daily	basis,	much	of	their	ad	targeting   system	would,	shall	we	say,	begin	firing	blanks.	Imagine	if	a	thirteen	year old	boy	received	ads	for	Cialis,	or	an	eighty-year	old	woman	named Bertha	began	to	see	ads	for	Trojan	coupons,	or…	well	you	get	the	idea. They	don’t	mind	donating	funds,	either,	since	this	allows	a	future stake	in	the	technology	 sort	of .	To	that,	they’ve	not	only	donated	to	Tor, but	to	Freenet	as	well	and	even	Mars	rover	technology.	All	kinds	of	crazy things.	They	never	know	which	technology	is	going	to	rocket	into	orbit	a week	or	year	from	now	so	they	throw	money	around	like	Scrooge	on Christmas	morning. 	Captchas At	times	you’ll	be	using	Tor	and	find	that	Google	spits	this requirement	out	in	order	to	prove	you’re	human.	This,	on	account	of their	massive	analyses	on	search	queries,	is	what	drives	some	Tor	users to	think	Google	has	it	out	for	them. However,	Google	has	to	put	up	with	lots	of	spammers	and	general thievery;	bots	hammering	the	servers	with	tons	of	queries	in	short amounts	of	time	that	put	undue	strain	on	the	servers	can	be	one	thing, but	it	can	also	happen	if	your	employer	uses	proxies	-	many	employees working	for	the	same	company	that	uses	one	of	these	can	set	off	a	red flag.When	your	Tor	circuit	switches	to	a	new	one,	usually	it	solves	itself. There	are	other	search	engines	like	DuckDuckGo	you	can	use,	however. You	may	find	websites	do	the	same	thing.	Again,	this	is	on	account	of so	many	exit	nodes	 all	of	which	are	publicly	visible	to	any	website admin ,	slamming	the	website	with	traffic	such	that	the	hammering behavior	resemble	those	of	a	bot,	the	kind	Russian	and	Chinese	outfits like	to	use. 	SpiderOak Normally	I	warn	against	using	Cloud	Service	for	anything	you	want private.	SpiderOak	one	exception,	with	some	reservation.	It’s	a	decent enough	alternative	to	DropBox	as	it	is	coded	with	“Zero	Knowledge”	 so say	the	developer 	and	when	you	install	it,	a	set	of	encryption	keys	is created	client-side.	When	you	upload	data	to	SpiderOak	servers,	they’re encrypted	on	your	computer	and	then	uploaded.	Again,	according	to	the   developers. They	claim	that	even	if	a	subpoena	requires	subscriber	data,	they could	not	deliver	since	only	you	have	the	keys.	Not	bad,	but	I	still	would not	upload	anything	unencrypted.	A	container	file,	for	instance. The	other	downside	is	that	it	is	centralized.	Centralization	means	a single-point-of-failure.	As	well	your	data	can	be	deleted	by	them	at	any time	 true	with	any	online	service	really .	Remember	that	between	you and	a	judge,	they	will	always	side	with	the	judge.   SixTails  the	  Ever	heard	of	a	“live	system”?	Neither	had	I	until	Tails	burst	on	the scene.	Tails	allows	you	to	use	Tor	and	avoid	tracking	and	censorship	and in	just	about	any	location	you	could	want.	It	houses	its	own	operating system	and	is	designed	for	those	on	the	go. You	can	run	it	via	USB	stick,	SD	or	even	a	DVD.	Pretty	handy	as	this makes	it	resistant	to	viruses.	It’s	also	beneficial	if	you	don’t	want	your hard	drive	to	leave	remnants	of	your	browsing	session.	The	best	part	is that	it’s	free	and	based	on	Linux	and	comes	with	chat	client,	email,	office, and	browser. The	downside	to	using	a	DVD	is	that	you	must	burn	it	again	each time	you	update	Tails.	Not	very	convenient.	So	let’s	install	it	to	USB	stick instead.1. 	 Tails	 at Download	 https:  tails.boum.org install win usb index.en.html You	must	first	install	it	somewhere,	like	a	DVD,	and	then	clone	it	the USB	stick	or	SD	card. 2. 	Click	Applications	—>	Tails	—>	Tails	install	to	begin	the installation. 3. 	Choose	Clone	&	Install	to	install	to	SD	card	or	USB	Memory	Stick 4. 	Plug	in	your	device,	then	scan	for	the	device	in	the	Target-Device	drop down	menu.	You’ll	get	a	warning	about	it	overwriting	anything	on	the device,	blah-blah.	Choose	yes	and	confirm	install. 	Tails	Limitations Neither	Tails	nor	Tor	encrypt	your	docs	automatically.	You	must	use GnuPG	or	LUKS	for	that	 included ,	bearing	in	mind	that	some	docs	like Word	or	Atlantis	may	have	your	registration	info	within	the	document itself	 In	2013,	Amazon	self-publishers	discovered	pen	names	could sometimes	be	revealed	by	looking	at	the	code	of	the	above	apps	and finding	out	the	real	identity	of	authors.	Ouch. 	Personally	I	use	fake	info  installer	   when	“registering”	any	app	I	will	use	in	conjunction	with	Tor	or	Tails. 	Other	noteworthy	stuff:	-	Document	metadata	is	not	wiped	with Tails	-	Tails	does	not	hide	the	fact	you’re	using	it	from	your	ISP	 unless you	use	Tor	bridges .	They	cannot	see	what	you’re	doing	on	Tor,	true enough,	but	they	know	you’re	using	it. -	Tails	is	blind	to	human	error.	Try	not	to	use	the	same	Tails	session to	begin	two	different	projects.	Use	separate	sessions.	Isolating	both identities	in	this	way	contributes	to	strong	anonymity	for	your	sessions. 	Chrome Firefox	is	hardly	the	only	way	to	slay	a	dragon.	There’s	also	Chrome. Yes,	it’s	Google,	and	yes	Google	has	strayed	far	from	it’s	“Do	No	Evil” motto,	but	like	everything	else	in	life,	luck	favors	the	prepared.	You	just have	to	have	the	right	sword.	The	right	armor.	The	right	lockpicks.	The preparations	 reagents 	are	as	follows: I.	Install	the	ScriptNo	extension.	It	is	to	chrome	what	a	mouse	is	for	a PC,	at	least	as	far	as	precision	aiming	goes.	It	offers	excellent	control,	too, even	allowing	you	to	fine-tune	the	browser	in	ways	that	NoScript	for Firefox	cannot.	If	you	find	it	too	difficult,	ScriptSafe	is	another	option.	I’ve used	both	and	came	away	very	satisfied,	though	like	everything	else	on the	internet,	YMMV. 	II.	FlashControl	is	a	nice	alternative	to	Firefox.	In	the	event	you	don’t see	it	in	the	Google	Play	Store,	just	search	for	“Flash	Block”	and	it	should come	up	 Google	has	a	habit	of	removing	apps	that	aren’t	updated	every Thursday	under	a	Full	Moon . 	III.	Adblock.	This	one	is	just	insanely	good	at	repelling	all	kinds	of malware. 	IV.	User-agent	Switcher	for	Chrome.	Install	it.	Never	leave	home  0.0.0.0 	without	it.	It	spoofs	and	mimics	user-agent	strings.	You	can	set yours	to	look	like	Internet	Explorer.	This	will	fool	a	lot	of	malware payloads	into	thinking	you	really	are	browsing	with	IE	and	not	Firefox	or Chrome,	thus	firing	blanks	at	you.   	It	might	have	saved	Blake	Benthall,	26	year	old	operator	of	Silk	Road 2.0,	from	getting	raided	by	the	FBI	 among	a	dozen	other	drug	outfits . This	was	accomplished	over	the	span	of	many	months	since	they	had	to get	control	of	many	relays,	and	if	you	have	control	of	relays,	you	can	use sophisticated	traffic	analysis	to	study	patterns	in	IP	addresses	and	match behavior	and	browser	settings	with	those	addresses.	Recall	that	any federal	prosecutor	will	always	try	to	tie	an	IP	address	to	an	actual	person where	felonies	are	concerned. It	bears	repeating. An	IP	address	is	considered	an	 identity	for	the	purposes	of prosecution. We’re	all	a	number	to	them,	regardless.	Those	of	you	with	student loans	know	this	perhaps	more	than	anyone	else.	This	will	change	as	time goes	on	of	course	as	Tor	competitors	like	Freenet	and	other	apps	evolve to	offer	what	Tor	cannot.	Ivan	Pustogarov	said	the	FBI	did	their homework	and	when	all	was	said	and	done,	had	more	resources	on identifying	lazy	users	than	a	typical	VPN	would. 	V.	CanvasBlocker	-	 And	another	great	plugin	for	Firefox.	This prevents	sites	from	using	Javascript	 	API	to	fingerprint	users. You	can	block	it	on	every	site	or	be	discriminant	and	block	only	a	few sites.	Up	to	you.	The	biggest	thing	for	me	is	that	it	doesn’t	break	websites. More	info	here	but	in	case	you	can’t	be	bothered,	here’s	the	gist:	 The different	block	modes	are:	   	-	block	readout  API:	All	websites	not	on	the	white	list	or	black	list	can	use	the	 	API to	 display	 something	 on	 the	 page,	 but	 the	 readout	 API	 is	 not	 allowed	 to return	values	to	the	website.  -	fake	readout	API:	Canvas	Blocker’s	default	setting,	and	my	favorite! All	websites	not	on	the	white	list	or	black	list	can	use	the	 	API	to display	something	on	the	page,	but	the	readout	API	is	forced	to	return	a new	random	value	each	time	it	is	called.  -	ask	for	readout	API	permission:	All	websites	not	on	the	white	list	or black	list	can	use	the	 	API	to	display	something	on	the	page,	but the	user	will	be	asked	if	the	website	should	be	allowed	to	use	the	readout API	each	time	it	is	called.   -	block	everything:	Ignore	all	lists	and	block	the	 	API	on	all  -	allow	only	white	list:	Only	websites	in	the	white	list	are	allowed	to  websites.  use	the	 	API.  -	ask	for	permission:	If	a	website	is	not	listed	on	the	white	list	or	black list,	 the	 user	 will	 be	 asked	 if	 the	 website	 should	 be	 allowed	 to	 use	 the  	API	each	time	it	is	called.  black	list.  -	block	only	black	list:	Block	the	 	API	only	for	websites	on	the  -	allow	everything:	Ignore	all	lists	and	allow	the	 	API	on	all  websites.As	you	can	see,	it’s	powerful	stuff. 	Firefox	Armor But	first	a	little	mention	of	something	a	lot	of	people	get	wrong.	You might	be	tempted	to	enable	“Check	for	counterfeit	websites”	in	Firefox. Don’t	do	this	as	it	will	relay	sites	you	regularly	visit	to	Google’s	servers. Google’s	“predictive	text-search”	is	also	bad	as	it	relays	keystrokes	to Google	as	well.	To	change	it	you	have	to	do	it	manually	by	going	into about:config	in	the	address	bar.	That	said,	let’s	look	at	some	other privacy	settings	you	might	want	to	know	about. Javascript	-	Avoid	like	the	plague.	You	may	notice	it	is	turned	on	by default	under	the	Firefox	options	tab,	though.	By	the	Tor	Developer Team:	We	configure	NoScript	to	allow	JavaScript	by	default	in	Tor	Browser  because	many	websites	will	not	work	with	JavaScript	disabled.	Most	users would	 give	 up	 on	 Tor	 entirely	 if	 a	 website	 they	 want	 to	 use	 requires JavaScript,	 because	 they	 would	 not	 know	 how	 to	 allow	 a	 website	 to	 use JavaScript	 or	that	enabling	JavaScript	might	make	a	website	work .  There’s	a	tradeoff	here.	On	the	one	hand,	we	should	leave	JavaScript enabled	 by	 default	 so	 websites	 work	 the	 way	 users	 expect.	 On	 the	 other hand,	 we	 should	 disable	 JavaScript	 by	 default	 to	 better	 protect	 against browser	vulnerabilities	 	not	just	a	theoretical	concern! .	But	there’s	a	third issue:	websites	can	easily	determine	whether	you	have	allowed	JavaScript for	 them,	 and	 if	 you	 disable	 JavaScript	 by	 default	 but	 then	 allow	 a	 few websites	 to	 run	 scripts	  the	 way	 most	 people	 use	 NoScript ,	 then	 your choice	 of	 whitelisted	 websites	 acts	 as	 a	 sort	 of	 cookie	 that	 makes	 you   recognizable	 and	distinguishable ,	thus	harming	your	anonymity.  	Ghostery	and	Ghostrank Not	deadly,	just	useless	on	Tor	since	Tor	disables	tracking	anyway. If	you	do	use	it,	either	could	possibly	alter	your	browser	‘fingerprint’, though	not	to	the	extent	of	breaking	anonymity.	Ghostery	still	blocks	any tracking	scripts	regardless	if	you’re	on	Tor	or	not.	But	use	DuckDuckGo	if you	want	to	beef	up	your	anonymity. 	Adblock This	 could	 also	 change	 your	 fingerprint.	 Adblock	 plus	 has “acceptable	ads”	enabled	by	default,	and	there	is	also	the	scandals	that Adblock	has	been	in	over	the	years,	one	implying	that	Google	paid	the Adblock	CEO	for	Google	Ads	to	be	shown. Besides,	the	basic	idea	of	the	Tor	Browser	Bundle	is	to	use	as	few addons	as	possible.	They	figure	that	TorButton,	NoScript,	and	HTTPS Everywhere	is	sufficient	to	preserve	anonymity	without	the	added	risk	of additional	addons. 	Whonix	&	Tor If	you’re	paranoid	that	using	Tor	could	get	you	into	trouble	 if	you are	hosting	a	Hidden	Service ,	you	might	want	to	look	into	Whonix before	running	anything.	Many	power	users	who	use	Tor	daily	like	the tighter	security	it	offers.	This	is	not	to	say	that	it	is	better	than	Tails	by default.	Both	tools	offer	strengths	and	weaknesses	meant	for	different purposes,	and	you	may	find	one	is	better	than	the	other	for	your	personal situation. Like	Tails,	Whonix	is	built	with	anonymity	and	security	in	mind.	It’s also	based	off	of	Debian Linux,	so	it’s	a	good	synergy	where	anonymity	is concerned.	This	synergy	grants	anonymity	by	routing	everything through	Tor.	The	advantages	are	that	DNS	leaks	are	next	to	impossible and	malware	cannot	reveal	your	IP	address.	In	fact,	the	only	connections possible	are	routed	through	Tor	via	the	Whonix-Gateway. The	question	you	may	be	wondering	is:	how	much	security	is	too much	security?	What’s	overkill	and	what	isn’t? Well,	you	should	ask	how	far	will	you	fall	if	caught,	and	how	much   Anonymous	  Publishing Anti-Censorship	  time	are	you	willing	to	invest	in	reading	to	prevent	it.	Tails	is	easier	to grasp,	and	if	you	do	not	expect	attacks	from	sites	you	visit	then	by	all means	use	Tails. If	you	live	in	North	Korea	or	China	then	there	is	a	possibility	of	hard labor	hammering	worthless	rocks	if	they	see	any	Tor	activity	coming from	your	location	that	correlates	to	“things	they	don’t	like”	activity…	or anything	else	in	the	case	of	NK	that	offers	hope.	Guilty	until	proven innocent. So	if	the	above	applies	to	you,	use	Whonix	as	it	offers	more	security. A	few	notable	features	of	Whonix	that	make	it	more	secure: Anonymous	 E-Mail w Thunderbird	or	TorBirdy	Add	proxy	behind	Tor	 user	->	Tor	->	proxy  Chat	anonymously. IP DNS	protocol	leak	protection. Hide	that	you	are	using	Tor	Hide	the	fact	you	are	using	Whonix Mixmaster	over	Tor	Secure	And	Distributed	Time	Synchronization Mechanism	Security	by	Isolation	Send	E-mail	anonymously	without registration	Torify	any	app	Torify	Windows	Virtual	Machine	Images  VM 	VPN	Support	Use	Adobe	Flash	anonymously	Use	Java Javascript anonymously The	following	is	an	example	of	a	moderately	secure	system:	-	Host Whonix	on	a	memory	stick	with	a	flavor	of	Linux	of	your	choice	-	Use	a VPN	you	trust	 for	privacy,	not	anonymity 	-	Use	Macchanger	to	spoof any	mac	address	every	session	 Whonix	does	not	hide	your	mac	address from	sites	you	visit! .	If	Macchanger	isn’t	to	your	liking,	give	Technitium MAC	Address	Changer	a	try. -	Avoid	regular	calls	of	non-Tor	WiFi	tablets	if	using	Cafe	WiFi	- Know	where	every	CCTV	is	located	in	the	area	you	plan	to	use	Tor MAC	Addresses We	mentioned	Mac	addresses. As	technology	would	have	it,	your	new	WiFi Ethernet	card	has something	that	can	aid	intelligence	agencies	in	tracking	you.	It’s	a	48-bit identifier	burned-in	by	the	manufacturer.	Sort	of	like	an	IMEI	for	your phone.	If	by	chance	you	were	not	thinking	clearly	and	bought	your computer	with	Tor	in	mind	using	a	credit	card,	you	may	later	get targeted	by	an	FBI	“NIT”	that	swipes	your	MAC	number.	If	that	happens,   you’re	toast. The	way	to	defeat	this	is	to	have	a	disposable	MAC	 the	number,	not the	Apple	product .	One	that	you	bought	with	cash	with	no	security cams.	That	way	you	can	get	rid	of	it	in	a	flash	or	swap	it	out. They	are	also	soft-configurable. Believe	it	or	not,	Tails	itself	alters	this	randomly	with	every	session. With	a	virtual	machine,	the	FBI	Nit	may	target	a	MAC	number	from	the VirtualBox	pool.	Not	really	an	issue	unless	they	happen	to	raid	your house	and	snag	your	system	simultaneously.	So	swapping	this	out	on	a daily	basis,	as	you’ve	probably	guessed,	can	be	quite	a	pain.	It’s	mainly for	guys	who	run	illegal	markets.	Guys	who	are	always	in	the	crosshairs of	alphabet	agencies. But	then,	so	can	you.	I’ve	found	it	pays	to	think	of	oneself	higher than	what	one	is	actually	worth	when	traversing	dark	nets.	Basically, thinking	of	yourself	as	a	high	value	target.	You’ll	subconsciously	program yourself	to	research	more,	learn	more,	from	everything	from	bad security	mistakes	to	bad	friendships	to	bad	business	practices.	To	that, you	don’t	have	to	be	in	the	top	5%	of	guys	who’ve	mastered	network security.	Being	in	the	top	25%	pool	is	more	than	enough	to	make	The Man	get	frustrated	enough	to	look	for	his	flashy	headlines	elsewhere. 	Whonix	Bridges If	you	live	in	a	communist	hellscape	where	even	mentioning	Tor	can get	you	into	trouble,	using	a	Bridge	with	Whonix	can	be	quite	literally	a life	saver. 	What	Bridges	Are Bridges	are	obfuscation	tools	to	cloak	your	Tor	usage	from	a	nosy ISP	or	government	who	might	see	you	are	using	Tor,	but	not	know	what you	are	doing	with	it.	To	that	end,	Tor	bridges	are	alternative	ways	to enter	the	Tor	network.	Some	are	private.	Many	are	public.	Some	are listed	on	the	Tor	homepage.	In	a	hostile	environment	you	can	see	the value	in	using	it	to	your	advantage	as	it	makes	it	much	more	difficult	for an	ISP	to	know	you’re	using	Tor. 	What	Bridges	Are	Not   While	not	especially	unreliable,	they	are	certainly	less	reliable	than regular	Tor	usage	where	performance	goes.	But	the	tradeoff	may	be	in your	best	interest.	Only	you	can	decide	if	the	performance	hit	is warranted.	Here’s	how	to	do	it	in	Whonix. Bridges	must	be	added	manually	since	there	is	no	auto-install method	for	Whonix,	but	it	is	not	difficult.	You	simply	must	enter	them into	the	proper	directory:	etctor torrc. 	If	you’re	using	a	graphical	Whonix-Gateway,	then	browse	to:	Start Menu	->	Applications	->	Settings	->	 etctor torrc.examples	To	edit	your torrc	file	 necessary	for	bridge	adding ,	browse	to:	Start	Menu	-> Applications	->	Settings	->	 etctor torrc	Then	add	whatever	bridge	you copied	from	the	Tor	bridges	page	 or	a	private	one	if	you	have	it .	Then restart	Tor	for	it	to	take	effect.   Seven Tor	and	VPNs  There	is	a	lot	of	confusion	among	beginners	when	it	comes	to	VPN companies.	They	read	one	thing	and	see	something	else	in	the	media	that contradicts	that	one	thing.	The	cold,	hard	truth	about	VPN	companies	is that	a	few	want	your	patronage	so	badly	that	they’re	likely	to	bury	the fine	print	on	their	web	page	where	it	is	difficult	to	read.	Believe	me, that’s	fine	print	that	can	get	you	sent	to	the	Big	House	if	you’re	not careful.	It	really	is	a	minefield	where	these	companies	are	concerned. For	this	reason,	you	need	to	decide	whether	you	want	privacy	or anonymity.	They	are	different	beasts	that	require	different	setups.	And not	every	VPN	user	uses	Tor	and	not	every	Tor	user	uses	a	VPN	service, but	it	is	advantageous	to	combine	two	powerful	tools;	one	that	affords privacy	 the	VPN 	and	one	anonymity	 Tor .	Like	I	said,	two	different beasts.But	for	what	it’s	worth,	if	you	like	this	combo	then	find	a	VPN	that offers	128	bit	encryption	and	that	does	not	store	activity	logs.	That’s	the first	rule	of	business. And	here’s	the	part	where	the	fine	print	comes	in.	Many	VPN companies	 claim	they	do	not	log	a	thing…	but	will	gladly	offer	your subscriber	data	on	a	silver	platter	if	a	subpoena	demands	it.	Between	Big Money	and	Your	Freedom,	money	always	wins.	They	will	not	go	to	jail	for you,	ever.	So	do	your	due	diligence	and	research. Obviously	a	VPN	service	is	not	anonymous	by	default.	Providers	love to	tout	that	it	is,	but	let’s	face	it	there	is	nothing	anonymous	about	using someone	else’s	line	if	you	left	a	money	trail	leading	straight	to	your	front door.Enter	Tor,	slayer	of	gremlins	and	we-know-what-is-better-for-you nanny	staters.	Tor	makes	for	an	extra	and	formidable	layer	of	security	in that	the	thieves	will	have	to	go	an	extra	step	to	steal	something	from	you. Thieves	come	in	all	flavors,	from	simple	jewel	thieves	to	border	guards who	want	to	make	you	as	miserable	as	they	are.	So	it	is	a	good	idea	to   ensure	all	the	holes	in	your	Tor	installation	are	updated. Updated	applications	are	resistant	to	malware	attacks	since	it	takes time	to	find	exploitable	holes	in	the	code.

These are	sites	that	can	only	be	accessed	by	using	Tor.	The	problem	is	that	the last	link	of	connectivity	for	these	sites	needs	to	be	Tor,	not	the	VPN. You’ll	understand	what	is	involved	once	you	connect	with	one	which brings	up	our	next	question. 	How	Tor	Friendly	is	the	VPN? That	depends.	Spammers	use	Tor.	Hackers	use	Tor.	Identity	thieves use	Tor.	A	few	VPNs	have	reservations	about	letting	users	attain	100% anonymity	 by	 signing	 up	 anonymously.	 But	 if	 you	 signed	 up anonymously	then	you	have	little	to	fear	since	at	that	point	it	is	 their nose	on	the	line. There	is	one	problem:	the	hardliners	at	the	FBI	do	not	like	this attitude.	In	fact,	they’d	just	as	soon	go	after	you	if	you	use	a	VPN	over Tor.	Might	a	person	come	under	twice	the	suspicion	by	using	both? Maybe. 	From	Fee.org  “The	investigative	arm	of	the	Department	of	Justice	is	attempting	to short-circuit	 the	 legal	 checks	 of	 the	 Fourth	 Amendment	 by	 requesting	 a change	in	the	Federal	Rules	of	Criminal	Procedure.	These	procedural	rules dictate	how	law	enforcement	agencies	must	conduct	criminal	prosecutions, from	investigation	to	trial.	Any	deviations	from	the	rules	can	have	serious consequences,	 including	 dismissal	 of	 a	 case.	 The	 specific	 rule	 the	 FBI	 is targeting	outlines	the	terms	for	obtaining	a	search	warrant.  It’s	called	Federal	Rule	41 b ,	and	the	requested	change	would	allow law	 enforcement	 to	 obtain	 a	 warrant	 to	 search	 electronic	 data	 without providing	any	specific	details	as	long	as	the	target	computer	location	has been	hidden	through	a	technical	tool	like	Tor	or	a	virtual	private	network. It	 would	 also	 allow	 nonspecific	 search	 warrants	 where	 computers	 have been	 intentionally	 damaged	  such	 as	 through	 botnets,	 but	 also	 through common	 malware	 and	 viruses 	 and	 are	 in	 five	 or	 more	 separate	 federal judicial	districts.	Furthermore,	the	provision	would	allow	investigators	to seize	 electronically	 stored	 information	 regardless	 of	 whether	 that information	is	stored	inside	or	outside	the	court’s	jurisdiction.  	   current	procedure.”  The	change	may	sound	like	a	technical	tweak,	but	it	is	a	big	leap	from  	The	NSA	does	this	without	hindrance.	We	know	this	from	Snowden’s leaks	that	the	FBI	uses	the	NSA’s	metadata	from	private	citizen’s	phone records.	Thus,	a	VPN	is	not	a	truly	formidable	obstacle	to	them. But	this	takes	it	to	an	entirely	different	level	since	if	merely	signing up	for	a	VPN	provides	a	basis	for	a	legal	search,	then	they	can	snoop	on any	ISP’s	server	they	want	with	no	legal	grounds	at	all	to	justify	it. They’ve	done	similar	things	in	Brazil. But	here	in	America,	it	usually	goes	down	like	this: 1. 	Spy	on	JoBlo	to	see	what	he’s	up	to. 2. 	Make	justification	to	seize	PC Raid Data	by	reconstructing	case 3. 	Apply	pressure	to	the	right	people	with	direct	access	to subscriber	info 4. 	Subpoena	to	decrypt	subscriber’s	data.	If	they’ve	done	it	once, they	can	do	it	a	hundred	more	times.	No	Big	Deal. 	Solution If	you’re	going	to	go	the	VPN	route,	then	use	PGP:	Pretty	Good Privacy.	Never,	ever	transmit	plain	data	over	a	VPN,	not	even	one	that offers	SSL. 1. 	Talking	to	police	will	never	help	you.	Even	in	a	raid	situation. They	wake	you	at	gunpoint	at	6AM	and	corral	your	family	and	threaten to	take	everyone	to	jail	unless	someone	confesses.	It’s	all	lies,	all	the	time by	these	agencies.	A	friend	once	remarked	that	a	plain-clothes	officer once	knocked	on	his	door	to	ask	him	if	he	was	using	Tor,	only	to	make sure	he	wasn’t	doing	anything	illegal.	He	answered	yes,	but	nothing	illegal sir.	That	gave	incentive	to	go	forward	like	a	giant	lawnmower	right	over his	reputation.	He	was	proven	innocent	later	on	but	not	before	the	cops dragged	that	man’s	reputation	through	the	mud.	No	public	apology	came  Do	they	ever? . 2. 	If	they	don’t	charge	you	for	running	a	hidden	service,	walk	out.	In fact,	if	they	don’t	charge	you	with	anything…	walk	out.	Every	word	out	of your	mouth	will	aid	them,	not	you. 3. 	You	have	no	reason	to	justify	anything	done	in	your	own	home	to   them,	or	anywhere	else.	The	responsibility	to	prove	guilt	is	theirs,	not yours.But,	if	you	are	in	a	situation	where	you	have	to	talk	or	give	up	your encrypted	laptop,	always	 always	give	up	your	laptop	first.	Laptops	are cheap	and	easy	to	replace.	Five	years	is	not. 	Using	Bitcoins	to	Signup	Anonymously	to	a	VPN	Service 	Bitcoins	are	not	designed	for	absolute	anonymity,	but	neither	are VPNs.	They’re	designed	for	privacy.	So	why	use	them? Well	because	any	extra	layer	that	strengthens	your	anonymity	is	a layer	you	want.	But	just	as	with	any	advanced	tool,	you	can	lessen anonymity	if	you	are	careless	with	it.	Good,	tight	anonymity	tools	can	be a	bane	or	a	boon:	A	boon	provided	you	do	your	homework.	If	not,	folly and	embarrassment	ensues,	possibly	a	situation	where,	depending	on the	country	you’re	in,	you	might	as	well	slap	the	cuffs	on	yourself.	It’s	sad that	the	times	have	come	to	this	predicament. So	let’s	consider	then	how	one	pays	for	a	VPN	and	obtains	this	level of	absolute	anonymity	-	recognizing	that	a	VPN	by	itself	will	do	nothing to	further	this	goal.	It	is	only	one	tool	in	a	toolbox	full	of	tools	and	Bitcoin is	only	one	of	them	as	well.	You	wouldn’t	try	to	repair	a	Camaro	engine with	only	a	wrench,	would	you? Now	then,	back	to	Bitcoin. Bitcoins	are	open	source	coins,	a	digital	currency	that	utilizes	P2P- like	code,	and	like	 real	money	you	can	buy	online	products	with	it. Products	like	memory	cards	at	Newegg	or	even	a	Usenet	or	VPN premium	service.	These	are	useful	to	us.	Using	these	Bitcoins,	you	the end-user,	completely	bypass	the	need	for	a	credit	union	or	bank.	Pretty neat.	But,	they’re	not	without	their	shortcomings. For	now	simply	know	that	they	are	created	from	the	collective	CPU computations	of	a	matrix	of	users	 like	you,	for	instance 	who	donate	to their	creation.	Bitcoin	mining	is	involved,	and	though	you	may	have	seen images	of	Bitcoins	on	websites	stamped	with	a	golden	“B”,	they	are actually	not	something	you	can	carry	around	in	your	pocket. Not	in	the	way	you	think	at	least. They	have	something	in	common	with	PGP	-	public	and	private	keys   -	just	like	the	PGP	application,	only	instead	of	verifying	your	identity	like PGP	does,	Bitcoins	verify	your	 balance.	This	is	where	Bitcoin	wallets come	in.	Again,	not	a	magic	bullet	but	rather	one	tool	at	our	disposal. On	that	point,	Bitcoin	Wallets	will	only	get	better	at	strengthening anonymity	in	the	coming	years.	They	will	accomplish	this	by	breaking the	trail	to	our	real	identities.	Oh,	and	their	development	is	constantly improving. However	as	we	mentioned	earlier—embarrassment	will	result	if you	neglect	to	do	your	homework,	for	every	purchase	by	a	particular wallet	can	be	traced.	That’s	right.	If	you	buy	a	new	video	card	at	Newegg with	it,	the	same	that	holds	your	credit	card	details,	and	then	subscribe to	a	Usenet	service	or	VPN,	guess	what…	you’ve	now	established	a	trail	to your	real	identity.	The	FBI	or	Chinese	government	will	not	need	baying bloodhounds	to	sniff	you	out. But	not	if	you	make	only	one	purchase	per	wallet. This	means	never	using	it	for	 any	online	entity	in	which	you’ve purchased	goods	while	your	real	IP	is	connected.	It	also	means	forgoing Google	Plus,	Facebook,	Skype	and	all	social	media	outlets	with	said wallet.	Twitter,	Wal-Mart,	BestBuy	and	even	small	mom	&	pop	stores with	multi-social	media	buttons	splattered	all	over	their	websites—these are	enemies	of	anonymity	whether	they	know	it	or	not	 more	likely	they don’t .	They	are	not	our	friends	anymore	than	a	grenade	is	your	friend after	pulling	the	pin. A	single	individual	might	hold	several	addresses	and	make	only	two purchases	a	year,	but	if	he	cross-contaminates	by	mixing	up	 each transaction	is	recorded	in	the	Bitcoin	blockchain ,	then	anonymity	is weakened	and	in	most	cases,	destroyed	by	his	own	making.	Not	good. The	trick	is	this:	don’t	create	a	pattern.	A	string	of	purchases	create a	pattern;	the	exact	sort	of	pattern	Google	and	Amazon	code	into	their algorithms	to	search	and	better	target	you	with	interest-based	ads.	Bad for	anonymity	and	that’s	far	from	the	worse	that	can	happen. We	get	around	this	problem	by	using	Bitcoin	mixers.	These	weaken the	links	between	several	different	Bitcoin	addresses	since	the	history	of that	purchase	is	wiped	by	the	exchange	of	Bitcoins	among	other	Bitcoin users.	   Desktop	Wallet  Bitcoin	Wallets In	order	to	subscribe	to	a	VPN	or	buy	anything	online	with	Bitcoins, a	Bitcoin	wallet	is	required.	More	than	one	type	is	available	to	us.	We’ll go	through	each	and	list	their	pros	and	cons. This	is	what	I	use	and	for	good	reason:	I	have	absolute	control	over it	not	to	mention	the	thought	of	having	to	access	my	money	on	someone else’s	web	server	defeats	the	entire	idea	of	anonymity.	I	would	never store	my	encrypted	files	“in	the	cloud”	and	neither	should	you.	At	least, not	without	an	insanely	secure	system. Think	about	it.	Would	you	bury	your	safe	in	the	neighbor’s	yard	with a	For	Sale	sign	out	front?	Same	deal.	The	server	could	go	down.	The company	could	go	bankrupt.	Any	person	on	the	other	end	on	the	hosting side	can	install	a	keylogger	without	your	knowledge.	Nasty	buggers, those	things.	Desktop	wallets	aren’t	perfect,	mind	you,	but	they	are better	than	The	Cloud.	One	downside	is	that	you	must	backup	your Bitcoin	wallet,	an	especially	imperative	task	if	it	contains	a	lot	of	money.	I do	this	quite	religiously	every	week,	as	should	you.	Apologies	if	this	all sounds	like	a	Sunday	sermon,	but	some	of	this	stuff	really	must	be	taken as	gospel. 	As	the	name	implies,	you	carry	this	on	you	to	make	purchases	in	the same	way	you	would	a	credit	card.	Convenience	x	1000. There	are	many	types	of	wallets	such	as	Coinbase	and	Electrum	but	I found	Multibit	to	be	very	easy	to	learn.	It	is	available	in	both	Linux	and Windows	and	offers	a	pass	phrase	option.	Even	the	balance	sheet	looks like	a	PGP	interface,	but	yet	is	beginner	friendly	and	open-source,	so	no backdoors.	Good	for	anonymity. 	Multibit	Windows	Install 	Now	we	come	to	the	instructions	for	a	clean	install	of	this	work	of wonder. 	Download	the	installer.  Mobility Travel	Wallet   The	possible	problems	we	may	run	into:	On	Windows	7	64-bit which	is	the	system	of	choice	outside	of	Linux	these	days,	it	may	be	that the	Java	Virtual	Machine	 JVM 	is	not	correctly	located,	or	“Failed	to create	a	selector”	is	shown	in	the	error	message.	A	solution	is	to	change the	compatibility	setting: Choose	the	compatibility	dialog	 right	click—>	icon	-	Properties	—> Compatibility  Choose:	“Run	this	program	in	compatibility	mode	for	Windows	XP SP3.”Check	the	box:	“Run	this	program	as	an	administrator” 	Multibit	Linux	Install 	If	you’re	a	Linux	fan	 and	you	should	be	if	anonymity	is	something you	strive	for ,	then	download	the	Linux	 	Unix	installer	here: https:  multibit.org help v0.5 help_installing.html Open	a	terminal	window	and	create	an	installer	executable	with: 	chmod	+x	multibit-0.5.18-linux.jar 	Run	the	installer:	java	-jar	multibit-0.5.18-linux.jar 	Install. 	Thereafter	you	will	have	a	shortcut	to	start	MultiBit	in	your “Applications		Other”	menu.	If	you	see	no	MultiBit	shortcut,	you	can	run MultiBit	manually	by	doing	the	following: Open	a	terminal	window	and	‘cd’	to	your	installation	directory type	java	-jar	multibit-exe.jar 	Now	it	is	time	to	purchase	Bitcoins.	There	are	several	options	but what	we	want	to	do	is	execute	an	offline	option;	to	buy	Bitcoins	off	the grid	which	cannot	be	traced.	Cash	n’	carry. LocalBitcoins	look	promising	as	does	TradeBitcoin.	But	as	Trade looks	down	so	let’s	go	with	LocalBitcoins. -	After	you	choose	a	Bitcoin	outfit,	you	must	signup	for	the	site    anonymously 	but	be	aware	of	the	interest	charges	which	vary	from	one to	another	depending	on	how	much	you	want	to	deal	in.	For	this transaction,	use	an	email	in	which	you	anonymously	signed	up.	That means:-	Tor	Browser Tails -	No	Facebook	or	other	Social	Media Search	cookies	present	on machine-	Only	accessed	for	Tor Bitcoins. 	Choose	‘Purchase’	on	the	seller’s	page	and	the	amount	we	wish	to buy.	Remember,	we’re	not	buying	a	house	here,	only	a	VPN	to	use	with Tor.	Once	funds	are	transferred	out	of	escrow,	you	will	be	notified. Notice	that	the	trader	you	are	dealing	with	might	be	able	to	see	your financial	information,	i.e.	which	bank	you	use,	etc.,	but	you	can	always opt	to	meet	up	in	person	if	you	want.	This	carries	a	whole	other	set	of risks.Check	to	make	sure	the	funds	are	in	your	Bitcoin	Wallet. 	Paying	for	a	VPN	to	Use	with	Tor Now	it	is	time	to	pay	for	your	VPN	service…	 anonymously.	Let’s choose	Air	VPN	at	$9 mo	and	who	also	accepts	Bitcoins	for	payment. First:	Sign	up	for	the	service	but	do	not	put	any	information	that you’ve	used	on	any	other	site	such	as	usernames	or	passwords.	Also, since	we	do	not	need	to	input	any	banking	info,	no	money	trail	will	be traced	to	us.	The	email	we	use	is	a	throwaway	email	 you	did	use	Tor	to signup,	right?  Second:	Give	them	the	wallet	address	for	our	Bitcoin	payment.	Hit send.Done! Like	any	Usenet	service,	a	VPN	service	will	send	confirmation	to your	email	with	details	you	need	to	use	that	service.	Afterward	you	can see	the	details	of	this	payment	in	your	Bitcoin	wallet. As	you	can	see,	a	Ph.D	in	Computer	Science	is	not	needed	for	this extra	layer	of	anonymity.	The	problem	with	the	mass	of	people	on	Tor, however,	is	that	they	cannot	be	bothered	to	do	these	simple	extra	steps. That’s	bad	for	them.	Good	for	you.	Those	that	wear	extra	armor	are	often   the	ones	left	standing	after	a	long	battle.	But	there	is	one	topic	left	to discuss,	and	it’s	the	most	important:   Eight  Real	Identities	Outside	of	Tor  name	online?  This	is	a	big	one. One	that	I’m	guilty	of	breaking	because	even	anonymity	nuts	can crack	under	peer	pressure	every	now	and	then	and	do	something	dumb like	use	Facebook	over	Tor	 my	early	days,	thankfully .	A	question	I	kept asking	back	then	was	this:	What	kind	of	danger	is	there	in	using	your	real It	depends. Law	enforcement	and	prospective	employers	who	mine	your	social media	presence	for	data	are	often	worse	than	thieves	who	salivate	when you	announce	on	Twitter	you’ll	be	out	of	town	for	two	weeks.	Thieves, while	unsavory	and	criminally	deviant	to	be	sure,	rarely	profess	to	be just.	And	thieves,	as	stated	before,	come	in	all	shapes	and	sizes.	If	they take	your	private	data	without	asking	you	first,	that’s	stealing. Employers	can	be	the	worst	of	the	lot,	as	hypocritical	as	Harvey Two-Face,	demanding	transparency	in	your	life	but	not	their	own.	Make an	inflamed	political	post	or	drink	wine	on	vacation	in	Bora	Bora	with Filipinas	twirling	fire	sticks	and	you	could	lose	your	job,	or	be	denied	one. Not	kidding.	Mention	you	use	Tor	and	you	may	hear	your	interviewer ask:	“I	noticed	you’re	a	big	fan	of	Tor.	Could	you	elaborate	on	why	you	need Yes,	I	was	actually	asked	this	in	an	interview	for	a	position	that handled	a	lot	of	money.	It	came	out	of	nowhere,	but	what	really	bothered me	was	the	casual	way	it	was	asked,	like	every	applicant	should	have something	to	hide	if	they	desire	anonymous	communications.	Maybe	I was	some	rabid	fan	of	Jason	Bourne	and	up	to	no	good.	At	any	rate,	they did	not	like	my	answer. “Because	I	value	freedom.” I	came	out	of	that	interview	perplexed,	yet	jobless,	viewing	privacy as	somewhat	of	a	double-edged	sword	since	one	 needs	an	online presence	for	many	higher	paying	employers.	It	did	not	sit	well	with	me.	I  to	use	an	anonymizing	service?	We	like	transparency	in	our	employees.”   felt	a	little	cheated	to	be	honest	and	as	I	drove	home,	some	of	the mumblings	I	overheard	later	on	became	as	loud	as	roaring	trains	in	my ears:	Don’t	like	someone	on	Facebook?	You	probably	won’t	like	working with	them. Like	the	competitor’s	products?	Here’s	our	three-year	non-compete agreement	for	you	to	sign. You	use	Tor?	The	only	people	that	use	that	are	terrorists,	pedos	and hitmen.Soon	thereafter,	any	time	a	prospective	employer	noticed	“Tor” under	the	Hobbies	section	of	my	resume,	it	would	always	illicit	a negative	reaction.	My	breathing	would	become	erratic	as	my	heart	raced, as	if	they	were	about	to	summon	an	unbadged	“authority”	to	warn	me	of being	too	private. He	would	dress	a	lot	like	Dilbert,	only	he’d	be	skinnier,	and	with	a bumblebee-yellow	pen	and	a	clipboard.	He’d	have	multiple	facial	tics	and a	quirky	habit	of	raising	a	Vulcan	eyebrow	as	if	it	were	purely	illogical	to value	privacy.	I	have	no	idea	why	he’d	have	a	clipboard,	but	he	always did.My	solution	was	to	rightly	divide	my	public	and	private	identity	in social	settings	and	remove	any	trace	of	it	on	my	resume.	In	fact,	I	did	not give	any	indication	on	any	social	media	site,	either,	that	I	was	into	any	of the	following:	-	PGP -	Encryption,	or	encrypting	files	or	Operating	Systems	-	Tor	Relays	- I2P-	Freenet	-	Anonymity	in	general	-	 Anything	linking	to	Edward Snowden	Such	is	the	nature	of	the	masses.	One	simply	cannot	rely	on Facebook	or	Twitter	or	Google	to	respect	one’s	freedom	to	use	Tor without	announcing	it	to	the	whole	world. But	with	Tor,	Google	cannot	mine	your	browsing	session	for	ads.	No ads	=	no	soup	for	them.	From	NBC:	“The	Internet	search	giant	is	changing So	I	firewall	everything	I	do.	I	use	Ghostery	for	social	sites	and	offer  its	terms	of	service	starting	Nov.	11.	Your	reviews	of	restaurants,	shops	and products,	 as	 well	 as	 songs	 and	 other	 content	 bought	 on	 the	 Google	 Play store	could	show	up	in	ads	that	are	displayed	to	your	friends,	connections and	 the	 broader	 public	 when	 they	 search	 on	 Google.	 The	 company	 calls that	feature	“shared	endorsements.”   only	pseudonymous	details	about	myself.	In	fact,	I	try	to	avoid	any correlation	between	Tor	and	any	social	media	site	just	as	one	would	a can	of	gasoline	and	a	lighted	match. 	Anonymous	Bullies 	The	media	along	with	Google	and	Facebook	seems	to	think	that	if only	everyone’s	name	were	known	to	them,	then	every	bully	from California	to	Florida	would	go	up	in	smoke. Vampirism,	like	bullying,	comes	in	many	forms,	but	if	you’ve	ever read	Anne	Rice	then	you	know	every	clan	is	as	different	as	diamonds	are to	lumps	of	coal.	But	they	do	usually	share	similar	 beginnings.	Take adolescence	for	example. Were	you	ever	bullied	in	school?	I	was.	I	remember	every	buck toothed	spiked-club	wielding	ogre	who	pelted	me	into	nothing	but	a	wet snowball	in	7th	grade,	and	it	didn’t	stop	there.	How	I	wished	it	had,	but not	having	Aladdin’s	lamp	made	things	difficult.	I	watched	as	they	spread like	cancer,	sludging	upward	to	other	grades	for	easier	victims.	Ninth	on upward	to	12th	and	even	into	the	workforce.	Bullies	who’d	make	great orc	chieftains	if	there	were	any	openings,	such	was	their	cruelty	and	ire. I	recall	one	particularly	nasty	breed	of	ogre	in	8th	grade.	He	was	the worst	of	the	lot.	A	walking	colossus	who	sweat	when	he	ate	as	though	he were	being	taken	over	by	something	in	The	Thing.	Either	that	or	Mordor. He	certainly	had	the	arms	for	it.	When	he	arced	an	arm	over	me	it sounded	like	a	double-bladed	axe	slicing	the	air	in	half. Harassment	grew	more	fierce	and	fiery	every	year.	Later	I	would learn	that	his	entire	family,	perhaps	his	entire	generation,	grew	up	being the	baddest	of	the	bad	-	bullies	that	thrived	on	terrorizing	to	make	a name	for	themselves.	Every	one	of	them	went	on	to	become	cops	in	the New	Orleans	area.	One	died	of	diabetes.	Another	went	on	to	join	the	ATF to	fight	the	evil	scourge	called	drugs	 how’d	that	work	out? . I	knew	everything	about	these	cretins	and	not	just	their	names.	I knew	who	their	parents	were.	What	they	did	for	a	living.	Who	they	hung out	with.	What	beers	their	dad’s	drank	and	with	what	porn	mags.	Gossip spread	like	wildfire	in	high	school	and	no	detail	of	identifying information	was	ever	left	out.   And	yes,	I	told	the	principle,	a	great	big	lady	named	Beverly	whose former	job	was	working	in	some	HR	high-rise.	I	remember	multiple times	meeting	her	in	that	office	where	glitzy	awards	hung	like	a	safari hunter’s	office	and	thinking	if	only	she	had	an	elephant	gun	I	could borrow.	Boom!	My	trouble’s	be	over	 so	thought	the	13	year	old . Meetings	between	my	circus	acrobat	mother	became	fruitless	and rather	embarrassing.	Absolutely	nothing	positive	came	of	it.	The	point, however,	isn’t	that	nothing	came	of	it,	but	that	nothing	came	of	it	even	as I	knew	everything	about	the	scourge	I	faced	daily.	Knowing	their identities	did,	well,	not	much	of	anything.	Knowing	their	names	did nothing.	Knowing	how	many	other	kids	they	tormented	did	nothing	and, let’s	face	it,	kids	just	aren’t	smart	enough	to	band	together	and	attack	no matter	how	many	times	we	watched	Road	Warrior. We	can	see	how	bullying	spreads	on	Facebook.	Like	anthrax.	Little wolves	ostracize	a	rejected	member	when	a	drop	of	fear	is	shown,	so they	crucify	without	knowing	much	of	anything	about	him	or	why	he’s being	targeted.	Real	names?	Check.	Real	addresses?	Yep.	Everything	is traceable	now	just	as	it	was	way	back	then.	And	still	the	orcs	come	in	a blood-toothed	frenzy	like	sharks	to	a	wounded	dolphin. When	13	year	olds	begin	hanging	themselves	in	mom’s	bedroom	to escape	the	torture,	one	thing	is	immediately	obvious:	what	they	really want	is	to	disappear.	They	want	anonymity. But	that’s	not	something	bullies	think	highly	of.	They	won’t	allow	it. Neither	do	they	allow	running	away,	not	that	a	kid	has	the	means anyway:	No	money.	No	car.	No	distant	relatives	in	Alaska	to	run	and	live with	and	hunt	moose	all	winter. Anonymity	is	not	an	option.	It’s	a	requirement.	It	should	be	the	law on	some	level	but	isn’t.	This	is	because	if	they	gave	us	true	anonymity, they	would	lose	the	precious	power	they	wield	over	us.	If	Google	and Facebook	ever	teamed	up	with	the	federal	government	to	require	ID	to access	the	internet,	we’d	all	be	better	off	going	face-to-face	with	an Alaskan	grizzly. 	Email	Anonymity There	was	a	time	when	we	didn’t	have	to	worry	about	what	we	said in	emails.	Security?	That	was	something	geeks	did.	Geeks	and	supergeeks   who	attended	hacker	conventions	and	scoured	Usenet	for	zero-day exploits.	It	was	the	days	of	Altavista	and	Infoseek,	when	Google	was	still wet	behind	the	ears	and	Microsoft	was	still	struggling	to	satisfy	every Dos	user’s	whim.	We	wrote	whatever	we	wanted	and	hit	send	with	nary a	worry	about	third	parties	intercepting	it	and	using	our	own	words against	us.	Sadly,	no	longer. Advertising	and	search	engines	now	tailor	advertisements	to individuals	based	on	what	you	like	and	are	sure	to	click.	Trails	are	left. Messages	are	scanned.	And	Gmail	is	no	different	than	Yahoo	or	Microsoft. In	fact,	judges	wield	more	power	with	the	pen	than	any	CEO	in	any company	in	North	America. When	a	trailer	is	leaked	or	someone	says	something	nasty	about	the government,	you	can	bet	IP	addresses	will	be	subpoenaed.	Sometimes	I imagine	a	lot	of	ex-Soviet	officers	are	laughing	at	how	many	snitches	the Internet	produces	on	a	yearly	basis.	Subversion	to	the	extreme. But	is	it	possible	to	send	a	message	that	is	 foolproof	against subpoenas? There	are,	in	fact,	many	flavors	to	choose	from	to	accomplish	this task.	Below	are	a	few	rock-solid	services.	Combined	with	Tor,	they	grant you	a	virtual	fortress.	Anonymity	squared	if	your	message	is	encrypted. The	first	is	TorGuard. TorGuard	allows	users	to	use	PGP	 Pretty	Good	Privacy 	in	email	so you	needn’t	worry	about	snooping.	You	get	10MB	plus	several	layers	of protection	with	mobility	support. 	Second	is	W3,	The	Anonymous	Remailer Connectable	with	Tor,	you	only	need	an	email	address	to	send	the message	to	 preferably	encrypted	with	PGP—more	on	that	in	a	moment . Another	is	Guerrilla	Mail.	They	allow	users	to	create	throwaway emails	to	be	used	at	leisure.	Emails	sent	are	immediately	wiped	from	the system	after	you	hit	Send.	Well,	within	one	hour	at	any	rate. 	All	of	these	services	claims	of	anonymity	would	be	pretty	thin	if	we did	not	encrypt	our	messages—	which	brings	us	to	PGP. PGP	is	the	encryption	standard	of	choice	for	many	old	users	like myself,	and	for	good	reason.	It	has	never	been	cracked	by	the	NSA	or	FBI   or	any	intelligence	agency	and	likely	won’t	until	quantum	computers become	common.	It	works	by	way	of	key	pairs,	one	which	is	public	and one	private	 the	one	you	will	use	to	decrypt	your	messages	with . Worry	not	about	the	term	“keys”.	It	is	not	difficult	to	grasp	and	will be	as	easy	as	hitting	send	once	you’ve	done	it	a	few	times. The	first	thing	you	must	do	is	make	your	public	key	available.	This	is only	used	to	verify	your	identity	and	is	not	the	same	as	divulging	your passphrase	for	say,	a	Drivecrypt	container.	Your	recipient	must	also share	with	you	their	key	so	you	can	respond	in	turn. The	good	news? Only	the	two	of	you	will	be	able	to	read	each	other’s	messages.	The caveat	is	if	the	other	person	is	compromised	and	you	don’t	know	about it.	They	will	read	everything	you	encrypt.	Here	is	what	you	need	to	know: 1. 	To	begin,	make	two	keys,	one	public—for	everyone	else	but	you—and one	that	you	wouldn’t	even	share	with	your	own	mother.	You	should back	this	key	up	in	a	secure	medium,	and	remember	that	if	it	isn’t	backed up	to	three	different	types	of	media,	it	isn’t	backed	up.	If	your	truly paranoid,	send	one	on	an	encrypted	microSD	to	your	parents	in	case	of housefire.	Yes,	it	does	happen. 	2. 	If	however	you	opt	to	tell	mom,	then	she	will	need	your	public key	 you	did	publish	it	on	a	public	key	server,	right? 	Then	you	can	read it	by	way	of	your	private	key.	She	doesn’t	know	this	key	 thank	the	gods!  3. 	You	can	“sign”	any	message	you	want	over	Tor	or	anywhere	else  Freenet,	for	example,	the	highest	security	setting	of	which	demands absolute	trust	of	your	friend’s	darknet	connection 	to	verify	it	is	really you	sending	it. 	Unless	Norman	Bates	does	a	shower	scene	on	you	and	takes	your keys.	Your	mom	can	then	verify	with	your	public	key	that	it	is	really	you. 	4. 	Users	you’ve	messaged	with	 or	not 	can	sign	your	public	key	as a	way	of	verifying	your	identity.	As	you	can	see,	the	more	people	that	do this,	that	is,	vouch	for	you,	the	better. 	Important   Unless	you’ve	got	the	photographic	memory	of	Dustin	Hoffman	in Rainman,	it’s	a	good	idea	to	store	your	public private	keys	and passwords	and	also	revocation-certificate	to	backup	media	so	you	can retrieve	it	five	years	down	the	line…	should	you	need	it.	And	believe	me, you	will!Encrypt	them	in	containers.	Always	print	your	key-file	or	pass phrase	and	deposit	in	a	safe	place.	If	you	lose	it,	all	documents	encrypted with	it	are	permanently	lost.	There	are	no	back-doors	and	no	way	to decrypt	without	it.	Also,	consider	making	an	expiration	date	at	key-pair creation. If	you	like	nice	and	easy	interfaces,	try	Mymail-Crypt	for	Google’s Gmail.	It	is	a	plugin	that	allows	users	to	use	PGP-encrypted	messages	in	a handy	interface,	though	ensure	your	browser	is	air-tight	secure	and	you trust	it	with	your	private	key. 	One	More	Thing Rather	than	having	to	encrypt	files	and	upload	them	somewhere unsafe,	look	at	AxCrypt	encryption	tool.	This	is	useful	if	you’re	used	to uploading	to	Dropbox	or	Google	Drive.	Just	remember	that	in	the	event you	upload	an	encrypted	file	to	“The	Cloud,”	you	will	not	know	it	if	your password	to	said	file	has	been	compromised	without	setting	strict security	rules. With	that	said,	let’s	configure	PGP	for	Windows	-	Install	Gpg4Win	- Next,	create	your	key	in	Kleopatra	and	choose	Export-Certificate-to- Server	by	right	click	so	you	can	publish	it	to	a	keyserver.	Get	a	trusted friend	to	“sign”	and	establish	trust. -	Use	Claws-Mail	client	that	comes	packaged	with	it	or	use	Enigmail if	you’re	using	Thunderbird. -	Send	a	few	messages	back	and	forth	to	your	trusted	friend	via	PGP to	get	the	hang	of	things. -	Optionally	you	can	set	a	Yahoo Gmail Hotmail	filter	so	as	to forward	any	messages	that	contain	“Begin	PGP	message”	to	a	more private	account. 	Tor	Instant	Messaging	Bundle It	is	no	secret	that	the	NSA	has	Skype,	Yahoo	Chat	and	other	instant   message	services	in	their	hands,	but	as	long	as	the	Tor	development team	knows	about	it,	they	can	do	something	about	it. Enter	Tor	Instant	Messaging	Bundle. True	anonymity	is	the	goal	of	this	application.	It	is	built	by	the	very same	who	developed	the	Tor	browser	bundle	and	like	that	application, will	route	all	communication	through	Tor	relays…	encrypted	backwards and	forwards	and	hidden	from	the	NSA’s	prying	eyes. There	is	also	Torchat. Torchat,	like	Yahoo’s	IM,	offers	encrypted	chat	and	even	file-sharing. Since	it	is	built	upon	Tor,	you	are	assured	absolute	privacy	on	what	you say	and	to	whom	you	say	it.	Both	Windows	and	Mac	versions	are available	and	no	install	is	necessary.	Just	unzip	anywhere	and	run  preferably	from	an	encrypted	hard	drive	or	USB-Drive 	the	blue	earth symbol	titled	‘Torchat‘. A	few	more	useful	apps:	ChatSecure	-	ChatSecure	is	mainly	used	for encrypted	messaging	on	mobility	devices	but	they	offer	PC,	Linux	and Mac	versions	as	well.	From	their	website:  The	 Guardian	 Project	 creates	 easy	 to	 use	 secure	 apps,	 open-source software	libraries,	and	customized	mobile	devices	that	can	be	used	around the	 world	 by	 any	 person	 looking	 to	 protect	 their	 communications	 and personal	data	from	unjust	intrusion,	interception	and	monitoring.  Whether	your	are	an	average	citizen	looking	to	affirm	your	rights	or an	activist,	journalist	or	humanitarian	organization	looking	to	safeguard your	 work	 in	 this	 age	 of	 perilous	 global	 communication,	 we	 can	 help address	the	threats	you	face.  	Telegram	-	This	app	also	focuses	on	messaging	but	with	superior speed	and	is	similar	to	SMS	and	allows	for	picture video	sending.	There are	also	‘Secret	Chats’	that	offer	encrypted	sessions.	They	claim	no	data	is kept	on	their	servers	and	you	can	even	set	the	app	to	permanently	delete all	messages. CryptoCat	-	Billed	as	an	alternative	to	social	media	chat	apps	like those	seen	on	Facebook,	Twitter	and	the	like,	CryptoCat	gives	you encrypted	communications	using	the	AES	encryption	standard.	All encrypted	info	is	deleted	after	an	hour	of	inactivity. Freenet	-	This	is	the	granddaddy	of	all	anonymous	systems	the   is	  world	over,	both	for	file	sharing	or	any	kind	of	secret	chats.	Explaining everything	it	has	to	offer	goes	far	beyond	our	Tor	discussion	as	they	are two	different	systems,	but	I	include	it	here	as	an	alternative	if	you	find Tor	lacking. And	it	is	not	as	simple	as	Tor,	nor	is	it	as	fast	unless	you	leave	it running	24 7.	It	is	not	for	everyone	as	there	are	all	manner	of	criminal entities	that	use	it	and	you	will	notice	this	if	you	load	up	any	groups.	It	is hard	to	ignore	and	unlike	Usenet,	there	is	no	one	to	file	a	complaint	with. No	one	to	report.	It	is	anarchy	multiplied	many	times	over	in	many groups,	but	there	are	ways	of	mitigating	the	damage. But	for	absolute	anonymity	and	freedom	of	speech,	there	is	no	better tool	to	use	if	you	have	the	patience	to	learn	its	darknet	offerings. 	From	 the	 website:	 Freenet	  lets	 you anonymously	 share	 files,	 browse	 and	 publish	 “freesites”	  web	 sites accessible	 only	 through	 Freenet 	 and	 chat	 on	 forums,	 without	 fear	 of censorship.	 Freenet	 is	 decentralised	 to	 make	 it	 less	 vulnerable	 to	 attack, and	if	used	in	“darknet”	mode,	where	users	only	connect	to	their	friends,	is very	difficult	to	detect.  free	 software	 which	  Communications	 by	 Freenet	 nodes	 are	 encrypted	 and	 are	 routed through	 other	 nodes	 to	 make	 it	 extremely	 difficult	 to	 determine	 who	 is requesting	the	information	and	what	its	content	is.  Users	contribute	to	the	network	by	giving	bandwidth	and	a	portion	of their	 hard	 drive	  called	 the	 “data	 store” 	 for	 storing	 files.	 Files	 are automatically	kept	or	deleted	depending	on	how	popular	they	are,	with	the least	 popular	 being	 discarded	 to	 make	 way	 for	 newer	 or	 more	 popular content.	 Files	 are	 encrypted,	 so	 generally	 the	 user	 cannot	 easily	 discover what	is	in	his	datastore,	and	hopefully	can’t	be	held	accountable	for	it.	Chat forums,	 websites,	 and	 search	 functionality,	 are	 all	 built	 on	 top	 of	 this distributed	data	store.  An	 important	 recent	 development,	 which	 very	 few	 other	 networks have,	is	the	“darknet”:	By	only	connecting	to	people	they	trust,	users	can greatly	reduce	their	vulnerability,	and	yet	still	connect	to	a	global	network through	their	friends’	friends’	friends	and	so	on.	This	enables	people	to	use Freenet	even	in	places	where	Freenet	may	be	illegal,	makes	it	very	difficult for	 governments	 to	 block	 it,	 and	 does	 not	 rely	 on	 tunneling	 to	 the	 “free   world“.It	is	not	as	simple	as	using	a	Usenet	provider’s	newsgroup	reader. No	sir,	Freenet	requires	patience.	Using	Frost	or	Fuqid	 Front	End	apps for	the	main	Freenet	program ,	it	might	be	half	an	hour	before	you	can “subscribe”	to	groups	or	download	in	the	way	you	can	Usenet.	Some groups,	like	the	Freenet	group	and	other	technical	groups	will	be immediately	available,	but	with	few	messages.	Time	will	solve	this.	So keep	it	running	in	the	closet	and	forget	about	it	for	a	day	or	so	if	you	plan on	subscribing	to	a	lot	of	groups. It	will	be	worth	the	wait. 	Frost	&	Fuqid The	two	free	front	ends	I	recommend	are:	Frost	and	Fuqid. Frost	has	seen	a	lot	of	improvements	but	I	recommend	you	try Fuqid	first	as	it	is	the	first	external	app	for	Freenet	that	acts	as	as	an insert download	manager	for	files.	Fuqid	stands	for:	Freenet	Utility	for Queued	Inserts	and	Downloads	and	runs	on	Windows	or	Linux	under wine.The	 itself	 Freenet	 Fuqid	 at: is	 USK@LESBxzEDERhGWQHl1t1av7CvZY9SZKGbCnsD7txqX0I,nP0CHuKvlbVzcrnz79TEd22E56IbKj- KHB-W8HHi9dM,AQACAAE Fuqid -1  You	will	need	to	paste	the	above	into	Freenet’s	front	control	panel where	it	says	“Key”.	It	can	take	several	minutes	to	load	if	you’re	new	to the	system. After	you’ve	installed	it,	right	click	on	the	left	side	with	your	list	of boards	and	choose	“Add	new	board”.	For	the	name	put	in	“fuqid- announce”	with	out	the	quotes.	You	will	now	find	a	new	board	called “fuqid-announce”	in	your	list	of	boards. Right	click	this	board	and	choose	“Configure	selected	board”.	This will	bring	up	a	new	window.	On	that	window	click	“Secure	board”	to change	it	from	a	public	board.	Now	in	the	section	that	says	“Public	key” SSK@qoY- key	 paste	 E5SKRu66pmKH64xa~R~w3hXmS5ZNtqnpEGoCVww,HTVcdWChaaebfRAublHSxBSRaRFG91qCwsa3mGF3- QE,AQACAAE Now	you	have	the	announce	board	for	Fuqid	added	to	your	Frost boards.	The	latest	releases	of	Fuqid	will	be	posted	to	this	board	along  freesite	  below:	  the	  on	  in	   with	the	fuqid	board	on	FMS.	Questions?	Direct	them	to	the	Frost	or	FMS board	called	Fuqid. 	Passwords Good,	strong	passwords	are	like	having	a	couple	of	Rottweilers sleeping	in	your	den.	Most	intruders	will	leave	when	the	chaos	starts. Weak	passwords	are	like	having	a	Golden	Retriever.	Nice	and	friendly and	easy	to	trust	around	kids,	but	might	just	let	out	a	little	woof	at	3AM when	said	intruder	comes.	Then	he	will	hide	under	the	coffee	table	 the dog,	not	the	intruder . I’ve	heard	for	years	that	you	should	never	use	anything	personal	as your	password.	That	includes	family	names.	Favorite	books.	Movies.	So what’s	the	solution? Remix	your	passwords	with	a	symbol	or	two.	If	you	think	a	hacker won’t	be	able	to	guess	the	name	of	your	girlfriend’s	locker	combination, you’d	be	mistaken.	It	is	dirt	simple	to	guess	even	if	you	mix	it	up	a	bit. Computers	devoted	to	this	practice	can	guess	many	in	less	than	a nanosecond. 	But	how	do	you	remember	a	password	for	a	site	used	over	Tor	that has	symbols? Easy.	Use	a	passphrase	that	is	simple	to	recall	for	you	only.	First write	out	the	first	letter	of	each	word,	taking	not	of	case	and	position. Insert	symbols	therein.	For	instance: Last	Sunday,	the	wife	bought	me	a	Rolex	watch	and	it	was	too	ugly. Which	when	changed	is:	LS,twbmarwaiw2u	The	above	pass	is	hard	for	a hacker	to	guess	but	easy	for	you	to	remember…	assuming	you	are	good at	substitution. 	Changing	Your	Passwords Provided	you’ve	followed	the	above	to	the	letter,	you	shouldn’t	have to	rotate	out	your	passwords	every	90	days.	I’m	sure	you’ve	heard	from both	sides	of	the	aisle	their	say	on	the	subject,	but	I	believe	research	has proven	that	keeping	a	strong	password	 unless	proof	of	compromise 	is	a safe	bet. 	   The	 research	 paper	 from	 ACM CCS	 2010:	 “The	 Security	 of	 Modern Password	Expiration:	An	Algorithmic	Framework	and	Empirical	Analysis” by	 Yinqian	 Zhang,	 Fabian	 Monrose	 and	 Michael	 Reiter	 came	 to	 the conclusion	that	changing	passwords	every	few	months	did	not,	repeat,	did  NOT	 increase	 security:	 at	 least	 41%	 of	 passwords	 can	 be	 broken	 offline  from	previous	passwords	for	the	same	accounts	in	a	matter	of	seconds,	and five	 online	 password	 guesses	 in	 expectation	 suffices	 to	 break	 17%	 of accounts.  simple	password-based	authentication	should	be	abandoned	outright.  In	the	longer	term,	we	believe	our	study	supports	the	conclusion	that  …our	 evidence	 suggests	 it	 may	 be	 appropriate	 to	 do	 away	 with password	 expiration	 altogether,	 perhaps	 as	 a	 concession	 while	 requiring users	to	invest	the	effort	to	select	a	significantly	stronger	password	than they	would	otherwise	 e.g.,	a	much	longer	passphrase .	….  	Storing	Passwords	in	Tor	Browser You	may	have	noticed	that	the	“Remember	Password”	option	in	Tor Browser	is	not	available,	or	so	it	seems.	But	if	you	look	at	the	privacy setting	and	alter	the	history	setting	to	“remember	history”	and “remember	passwords	for	sites,”	it	will	no	longer	be	greyed	out. 	Diceware If	you	must	store	passwords,	a	good	option	for	a	unique	random	one is	Diceware	-	where	you	can	get	an	expire	date	for	any	password	months from	the	date	of	creation.	You	can	copy	any	password	to	a	text	file	then encrypt	it	and	mail	it	to	yourself	or	place	on	a	removable	 encrypted  drive	or	USB	stick. Remember:	Tor	does	nothing	to	improve	the	security	of	your	system to	everyday	attacks.	It	only	improves	security	online,	and	even	then	only when	used	responsibly.	Tor	has	no	idea	if	your	version	of	Windows	is unpatched	and	infected	with	a	zero-day	malware	payload	that	infected	it with	a	keylogger. One	way	in	which	a	hacker	could	guess	your	complex	password	is	if they	linked	your	Tor	usage	with	non-Tor	usage	and	compromised	your passwords	from	a	non-Tor	site.	This	is	why	you	should	never	use	the same	usernames passwords	for	Tor	that	you	do	for	non-Tor	activity.   	Preventing	Non-Tor	Activity	From	Being	Linked	with	Tor	Activity 	It	is	risky	to	browse	different	websites	simultaneously	and	preserve anonymity	since	Tor	might	end	up	sending	requests	for	each	site	over the	same	circuit,	and	the	exit	node	may	see	the	correlation. It	is	better	to	browse	one	site	at	a	time	and	thereafter,	choose	“New Identity”	from	the	Tor	button.	Any	previous	circuits	are	not	used	for	the new	session. Further,	if	you	want	to	isolate	two	different	apps	 allow	actions executed	by	one	app	to	be	isolated	from	actions	of	another ,	you	can allow	them	to	use	the	same	SOCKS	port	but	change	the	user pass. Another	option	is	to	set	an	“isolation	flag”	for	the	SOCKS	port.	The Tor	manual	has	suggestions	for	this	but	it	will	lead	to	lower	performance over	Tor.	Personally	I	like	to	use	Whonix.	Two	instances,	two	VMs.	One	of them	runs	Tor	and	the	other	with	Tor	Firefox. 	Keyloggers You	might	wonder	what	a	keylogger	has	to	do	with	Tor.	Or	for	that matter,	what	a	keylogger	even	is.	You’re	not	alone.	In	fact	you’d	be surprised	how	many	people	don’t	know	and	shocked	how	many	techs consider	them	a	non-issue. In	2010	I	caught	up	with	an	old	childhood	friend	of	mine	I	had	not seen	in	over	a	decade.	He	was	now	an	ATF	agent.	I	was	surprised	and  falsely 	assumed	his	extensive	training	meant	he	knew	as	much	as	an NSA	agent	when	it	came	to	computer	security.	Wrongo. He	replied	to	a	post	I	made	on	a	Facebook	regarding	the	hacking group	“Anonymous.” “What’s	a	keylogger?”	he	asked.	I	waited	for	someone	else	to	reply. No	one	did	so	I	told	him.	He	seemed	amazed,	dumbfounded,	as	though	it were	something	only	recently	unleashed	upon	the	net.	I	then	told	him that	they	had	been	around	a	long	time. But	 sigh ,	there’s	a	lot	of	confusion	on	what	they	do	exactly.	Some people	call	them	spyware.	Others	say	they’re	trojans.	Still	others, exploits.	They’re	a	little	bit	of	everything	to	be	honest. They	are	 surveillance	software	that	tracks	and	records	every	click   you	make,	every	website	visited,	every	keystroke	typed.	Chats,	Skype, Emails.	If	you	can	type	it,	it	can	record	it	and	all	right	under	your	very nose.	It	can	even	email	what	you	type	to	a	recipient	on	the	other	side	of the	world.	CC	numbers,	passwords	and	Paypal	login	details	are	just	the short	list	of	targets	it	can	acquire. So	how	does	one	get	in	infected? -	Opening	an	email	attachment	-	Running	an	.exe	file	from	a	P2P network	from	an	untrusted	user	-	Accessing	an	infected	website	with	an outdated	browser	-	The	NSA,	if	they	can	grease	the	right	palms	Some employers	use	them	to	track	productivity	of	employees.	Some	wives attach	one	via	USB	 Hardware	version 	to	see	who	their	hubbies	are conversing	with	at	night	after	bed.	Parents	use	them	on	the	kid’s computer.	So	it	isn’t	like	they’re	100%	malicious	all	the	time. But	they	are	devilishly	difficult	to	detect.	They	wield	an	almost vampiric	presence,	but	like	vampires	there	are	subtle	signs	you	can	glean without	whipping	out	a	wooden	stake. 	Vampire	Signs -	Sluggish	browsing	speed -	Laggy	mouse pausing	keystrokes	in	a	text	doc	-	Letters	don’t match	on	display	with	what	you	type	-	Errors	on	multiple	webpages when	loading	heavy	text graphics	There	are	two	types:	software	and hardware. 	Software	Keyloggers 	This	type	hides	inside	your	operating	system.	They	 Windows.	Linux,	not	so	much.	The	keylogger	records	keystrokes	and sends	them	to	a	hacker	or	other	mischief	maker	at	set	times	provided	the computer	is	online.	Cloaked,	most	users	will	never	see	it	working	its	dark art.	Many	popular	anti-virus	vendors	have	trouble	identifying	it	because the	definitions	change	so	frequently. 	Hardware	Keyloggers Bond	might	have	used	one	of	these.	Being	hardware,	it	is	a	physical extension	that	can	plug	into	any	USB	on	a	PC	and	can	be	bought	online	by  lurrrve   suspecting	spouses	or	kids	wanting	access	to	their	dad’s	porn	stash. Keystrokes	are	logged	to	ram	memory.	No	install	needed. Thus,	unless	you’re	the	type	to	check	your	PC	innards	every	day,	you might	not	spot	it	until	it’s	too	late.	They	also	can	be	built	right	into	the keyboard.	The	FBI	loves	swapping	the	target’s	out	with	a	carbon	copy custom-built	surveillance	device.	Granted,	this	is	mainly	for	high-value targets	like	the	Mafia	but	they’re	available	to	anyone. 	Keylogger	Prevention 	-	Check	your	keyboard	for	suspicious	attachments.	If	you	are	an employee	at	X	company	and	a	new	keyboard	arrives	at	your	desk	one morning,	exercise	caution	unless	you	trust	your	boss	200%. -	Use	a	Virtual	Keyboard.	No	keystrokes	=	no	logging! -	Use	Guarded	ID	to	prevent	hackers	from	capturing	your keystrokes.	It	works	by	scrambling	everything	you	type,	rendering	any info	useless	to	hackers. -	Use	a	decent	firewall	to	stop	a	keylogger	from	delivering	your	data. A	year	ago,	my	Comodo	firewall	alerted	me	to	suspicious	network activity	seemingly	out	of	nowhere	when	I	wasn’t	doing	anything	online. Turns	out	I	had	the	Win64 Alureon	trojan.	I	had	to	use	Malwarebytes	to detect	and	remove	it.	Norton	was	useless!   Nine Darknet	Markets Just	how	safe	is	a	Darknet	in	light	of	the	vulnerabilities	discussed? The	short	answer	is,	as	safe	as	you	make	it. You	are	the	weak	link.	The	last	link	in	the	security	chain.	And although	you	need	Tor	to	access	Onion	sites,	the	term	can	apply	to	any anonymous	network	-	networks	like	I2P	or	Freenet	or	anything	else	that cloaks	the	source	of	data	transmit,	and	by	extension,	your	identity. Which	brings	us	to	the	Darknet	Marketplace. The	complete	list	of	such	marketplaces	on	the	deep	web	are numerous,	and	the	risk	of	getting	scammed	is	quite	high.	It’s	one	reason why	you	may	not	have	heard	about	them.	They	are	often	taken	down quickly	by	either	a	venomous	reputation	or	a	law	enforcement	bust. Sometimes	they	piss	off	the	wrong	people	and	then	spammers	ddos	the site.	But	there	are	numerous	places	one	can	go	if	you’re	curious	about what	is	sold	by	whom. When	I	say	sold,	what	I	mean	is,	anything	you	want	that	cannot	be gained	through	the	usual	legal	channels.	And	remember	that	what	is	legal in	one	country	may	be	illegal	in	another.	In	Canada,	lolicon	comics	are illegal	and	can	get	you	in	big	trouble	if	you	cross	the	border.	But	not	in America.	In	the	USA	you	can	pretty	much	write	any	story	you	want.	In Canada?	TEXT	stories	involving	minors	are	verboten. The	other	difference	is	that	there	are	safety	nets	in	buying	almost anything	in	a	first	world	country	on	the	open	market.	Think	BestBuy. Mom	and	Pop	stores.	Florist	shops.	If	customers	get	injured,	what happens?	Customers	sue	via	the	legal	safety	net	and	make	a	lot	of lawyers	a	lot	of	money. But	the	Darknet	Marketplace	laughs	at	any	such	safety	nets.	In	fact, you’re	likely	to	get	scammed	at	least	a	few	times	before	finding	a reputable	dealer	for	whatever	goods	you	seek.	And	it	really	doesn’t matter	what	it	is,	either	-	Teleportation	devices?	Pets?	Exotic	trees?	It’s all	the	same	that	goes	around.	Whatever	is	in	demand	will	attract   unsavory	types	and	not	just	on	the	buyer’s	end. Therefore,	research	any	darknet	market	with	Tor,	being	careful	to visit	forums	and	check	updated	information	to	see	if	any	sites	have	been flagged	as	suspicious	or	compromised.	Some	other	advice:	-	Always	use PGP	to	communicate. -	Never	store	crypto-currency	at	any	such	marketplace. -	Assume	a	den	of	thieves	unless	proven	otherwise	by	 them.	The responsibility	is	theirs	just	as	it	is	offline,	to	prove	they	are	an	honest business.	If	you	open	your	own,	keep	this	in	mind:	customers	owe	you nothing.	You	can	only	betray	them	once. Now	for	some	examples	of	Phishers	and	Scammers	and	other	Con men.	By	their	fruits,	ye	shall	know	them. 	1. 	Silk	Road	2.0	 e5wvymnx6bx5euvy… 	Lots	of	scams	with	this one.	Much	like	Facebook	and	Google	emails,	you	can	tell	a	fake sometimes	by	the	address.	Paste	the	first	few	letters	into	a	shortcut	next to	the	name.	If	it	doesn’t	match,	steer	clear. 2. 	Green	Notes	Counter	 67yjqewxrd2ewbtp… 	They	promised counterfeit	money	to	their	customers	but	refuse	escrow.	A	dead giveaway. 	3. 	iPhones	for	half	off:	 iphoneavzhwkqmap… 	Now	here	is	a	prime example	of	a	scam.	Any	website	which	sells	electronic	gadgets	on	the deep	web	is	ripe	for	scamming	customers.	Whereas	in	the	Far	East	you will	merely	get	counterfeit	phones	with	cheap,	Chinese	made	parts	that break	within	a	month,	on	the	Deep	Web	they	will	simply	take	your money	and	say	adios.	Actually,	they	won’t	even	bother	saying	that. So	then,	how	does	one	tell	a	scam? Because	many	new	darknet	vendors	will	arise	out	of	thin	air,	with rare	products	that	will	make	customers	swoon	and	send	them	money	- without	doing	any	research	on	their	name	or	previous	sales.	A	real	hit and	run	operation.	Hit	quick	and	fast	and	dirty.	Seduce	as	many	as	they can	before	the	herd	catches	on	to	the	wolf	in	disguise.	Many	are suckered,	thinking	“it’s	only	a	little	money,	but	a	little	money	from	a	lot	of Tor	users	goes	a	long	way	in	encouraging	other	scammers	to	set	up	shop. When	you	ask	them	why	they	do	not	offer	escrow,	they	say	“We   think	it	is	unreliable suspicious unstable”	amid	other	BS	excuses.	It	is better	to	hold	on	to	your	small	change	than	leave	a	trail	to	your	treasure chest.	And	make	no	mistake	some	of	these	scammers	are	like bloodhounds	where	identity	theft	is	concerned. Do	your	research!	Check	forums	and	especially	the	dates	of	reviews they	have.	Do	you	notice	patterns?	Are	good	reviews	scattered	over	a long	period	of	time	or	is	it	rather	all	of	a	sudden—the	way	some	Amazon affiliate	marketers	do	with	paid	reviews	that	glow?	Not	many	reviews from	said	customers? If	you’ve	seen	the	movie	“Heat,”	with	Al	Pacino	and	Robert	de	Niro, you	know	when	it	is	time	to	Walk	Away.	In	the	middle	of	a	nighttime heist,	Niro	goes	outside	for	a	smoke.	He	hears	a	distant	cough. Somewhere.	Now,	this	is	middle	of	the	night	in	an	unpopulated	part	of the	city	that	comes	from	across	the	street	-	a	parking	lot	full	of	what	he thought	were	empty	trailers.	Hmm,	he	thinks	maybe	this	isn’t	such	a great	night	for	a	hot	score.	Not	so	empty	 it	was	a	cop	in	a	trailer	full	of other	hotshot	cops .	He	walks	back	into	the	bank	and	tells	his	partner	to abort.The	other	aspect	is	time.	Some	fake	sites	will	set	a	short	ship	time and	count	on	you	not	bothering	to	see	the	sale	as	finalized	before	you	can whistle	Dixie	out	of	your	ass.	After	finalization,	you’re	screwed	since	the money	is	in	their	wallet	before	you	can	even	mount	a	protest. 	Fraud	Prevention One	is	Google	believe	it	or	not,	at	http:  www.google.com imghp. Dating	sites	like	Cherry	Blossoms	and	Cupid	sometimes	use	reverse image	search	to	catch	fakers	and	Nigerian	scammers	masquerading	as poor	lonely	singles	to	deprive	men	of	their	coinage.	If	they	can	catch them,	so	can	you.	If	the	image	belongs	to	some	other	legit	site,	chances are	it	is	fake.	Foto	Forensics	also	does	the	same,	and	reports	metadata	so that	it	becomes	even	harder	to	get	away	with	Photoshop	trickery. 	When	it	is	Okay	to	FE	 Finalize	Early  FE	means	‘Finalize	Early’.	It’s	use	online	can	usually	be	found	in black	marketplaces	like	Silk	Road	and	Sheep’s	Marketplace.	It	simply means	that	money	in	escrow	is	released	before	you	receive	your	product.   Every	customer	I’ve	ever	spoken	with	advises	against	this	unless	you’ve had	great	experience	with	that	business. But…	quite	a	few	vendors	are	now	making	it	a	standard	practice	to pay	funds	up	front	before	you	have	anything	in	your	hands. On	more	than	one	Marketplace	forum,	there’s	been	heated	exchange as	to	when	this	is	proper.	You	might	hear,	“Is	this	guy	legit?	What	about this	Chinese	outfit	over	here?	He	seems	shady,”	and	others:	“A	friend	said this	guy	is	okay	but	then	I	got	ripped	off!”.	You	get	the	idea. Here	is	my	experience	on	the	matter. 1. 	It	is	okay	when	you	are	content	with	not	getting	what	you	paid for.	This	may	seem	counterproductive,	but	think	how	many	gamblers	go into	a	Las	Vegas	casino	and	never	ask	themselves	“How	much	can	I	afford to	lose?”The	answer,	sadly,	is	not	many.	Vegas	was	not	built	on	the	backs	of losers.	Some	merchants	do	not	like	escrow	at	all.	Some	do.	So	don’t	spend more	than	you	can	afford	to	lose.	Look	at	it	the	way	a	gambler	looks	at making	money. 2. 	It	is	okay	when	you	are	guaranteed	shipment.	There	are	FE scammers	out	there	that	will	give	you	an	angelic	smile	and	lie	right	into your	eyes	as	they	swindle	you.	Do	not	depend	solely	on	reviews.	A	guy	on SR	can	be	the	best	merchant	this	side	of	Tatooine	and	yet	you	will	wake up	one	day	and	find	yourself	robbed.	He’s	split	with	a	million	in	BTC	and you’re	left	not	even	holding	a	bag.	Most	won’t	do	this	to	you.	But	a	few will.	When	it	is	NOT	Okay	to	FE When	losing	your	funds	will	result	in	you	being	evicted	or	a relationship	severed.	Never	borrow	money	from	friends	and	especially not	family	unless	you	want	said	family	to	come	after	you	with	a	double- bladed	ax.	If	you	get	ripped	off,	you	lose	not	only	the	cash	but	the	respect and	trustworthiness	of	your	family.	Word	spreads.	You	don’t	pay	your debts.	What’s	that	saying	in	Game	of	Thrones? Right.	A	Lannister	always	pays	his	debts.	So	should	you. 	MultiSigna Sounds	like	something	from	Battlestar	Galactica	to	pass	from	ship	to   ship.	A	badge	of	honor	perhaps	some	hotshot	flyboy	wears	on	his	fighter jacket	that	bypassed	a	lot	of	red	tape. While	not	exactly	mandatory,	it	makes	for	interesting	reading,	and	is something	Tor	users	might	want	to	know	about	if	they	wish	to	make purchases	anonymously.	Here’s	what	happens:	When	a	purchase	is enacted,	the	seller	deposits	money	 in	this	case,	Bitcoins 	in	a	multi- signature	address.	After	this,	the	customer	gets	notification	to	make	the transaction	 $,EU 	to	the	seller’s	account. Then	after	the	seller	relays	to	MultiSigna	that	the	transaction	was	a success,	MultiSigna	creates	a	transaction	from	the	multi-signature address	that	requires	both	buyer	and	seller	so	that	it	may	be	sent	to	the network.	The	buyer	gets	the	Bitcoins	and	ends	the	sale.	Confused	yet?	I was	too	at	first.	You’ll	get	used	to	it. 	Critical MultiSigna	 only	 exists	 as	 a	 verifier cosigner	 of	 the	 entire transaction.	If	there	is	disagreement	between	seller	and	buyer,	no exchange	occurs.	Remember	the	scene	in	Wargames	when	two	nuclear silo	operators	have	to	turn	their	keys	simultaneously	in	order	to	launch? Yeah,	that.MultiSigna	will	of	course	favor	one	or	the	other,	but	not	both	if	they cannot	mutually	agree.	The	upside	is	that	is	if	the	market	or	purchaser	or vendor	loses	a	key,	two	out	of	three	is	still	available.	A	single	key	cannot spend	the	money	in	2 3	MultiSig	address. Is	it	Safe?	Is	it	Secret? I	don’t	recommend	enacting	a	million	dollar	exchange	for	a	yacht,	or even	a	thousand	dollar	one	as	they	both	carry	risk,	but	ultimately	it	is	up to	you.	Just	remember	that	trust	is	always	an	issue	on	darknets,	and you’re	generally	safer	making	several	transfers	with	a	seller buyer	who has	a	good	history	of	payment.	In	other	words,	reputation	as	always,	is everything. Alas,	there	are	a	few	trustworthy	markets	that	have	good	histories of	doing	things	properly,	thank	heavens. Blackbank	is	one.	Agora	is	another.	Take	a	look	at	the	MultiSig Escrow	 Tor: page	 http:  u5z75duioy7kpwun.onion wiki index.php Multi-Sig_Escrow  Onion	  with	  here	   	Security What	the	effect	would	be	if	a	hacker	gained	entry	to	the	server? What	mischief	might	he	make?	What	chaos	could	he	brew	if	he	can	mimic running	a	withdrawal	in	the	same	manner	that	the	server	does? If	a	hacker	were	to	gain	access	and	attempt	to	withdraw	money,	a single-signature	would	be	applied	and	passed	to	the	second	sig	signer	for co-signature.	Then	the	security	protocol	would	kick	in	where	these policies	would	be	enforced:	1. 	Rate	limits:	the	rate	of	stolen	funds	slows 2. 	Callbacks	to	the	spender’s	server:	Signing	service	verifies	with	the original	spender	that	they	initiated	and	intended	to	make	the	spend.	The callback	could	go	to	a	separated	machine,	which	could	only	contain access	to	isolated	approved	withdrawal	information. 3. 	IP	limiting:	The	signing	service	only	signs	transactions	coming from	a	certain	list	of	IPs,	preventing	the	case	where	the	hacker	or	insider stole	the	private	key. 4. 	Destination	Whitelists:	Certain	very	high	security	wallets	can	be set	such	that	the	signing	service	would	only	accept	if	the	destination were	previously	known.	The	hacker	would	have	to	compromise	both	the original	sending	server	as	well	as	the	signing	service. Let	me	repeat	that	MultiSigna	are	 never	 in	 possession	of	your bitcoins.	They	use	2	of	3	signatures	 seller,	buyer	&	MultiSigma 	to	sign	a transaction.	Normal	transactions	are	signed	by	the	seller	and	then	by	the buyer.	Purchaser	Steps	for	MultiSig	Escrow 1. 	Deposit	your	Bitcoins.	Purchase	ability	is	granted	after	6 confirmations	2. 	Make	a	private	&	public	key	 Brainwallet.org	is	a JavaScript	Client-Side	Bitcoin	Address	Generator 	3. 	Buy	item,	input public-key	&	a	refund	BTC	address	4. 	Retrieve	purchased	item	5. 	Input the	private	key	and	close   Ten The	Long	Arm	of	the	Law Can	the	law	steal	funds? Assuming	you	mean	U.S.	law,	no,	since	the	wallet	does	not	contain the	money.	The	Bitcoin	blockchain	prevents	this.	Hackers	cannot	steal	it either	since	two	private-keys	are	required	and	they	will	have	had	to	steal 2	out	of	3	private	key	holders…	not	likely. 	What	about	safety	in	using	the	private	key? Never	irresponsibly	use	the	private	key	from	your	Bitcoin	wallet. Create	a	new	one	instead.	Give	it	the	same	love	you	give	your Truecrypt DiskDecryptor	master	keys.	Lots	and	lots	of	special	love	that no	one	else	gets. 	This	sounds	awfully	risky.	Won’t	I	get	caught? Here	is	how	most	people	get	caught,	and	it	really	matters	not	what	it is.	Most	dealers	get	busted	making	the	usual	mistakes: -	Bar	Bragging -	Dropping	too	much	personal	data	to	strangers	 I.e.	Ross	Ulbricht  -	Selling	contraband	to	undercover	law	enforcement -	Snitches -	Committing	crimes	while	under	surveillance -	Managing	an	operation	that	grows	by	leaps	and	bounds	 with	loads of	newbies	making	mistakes . 	How	far	will	the	police	go	to	catch	you?	That’s	a	good	question.	The answer	thought	is	pretty	simple:	As	far	as	resources	allow. It’ll	probably	be	no	worse	than	what	Charleton	Heston	suffered being	hogtied	and	dragged	around	the	ape	city,	but	know	that	some	apes are	worse	than	others. It	boils	down	to	if	what	you’re	doing. Case	1:	In	2010,	police	in	L.A.	organized	a	phony	sweepstakes   scheme	in	order	to	lure	in	those	with	outstanding	warrants.	I	kid	you	not, they	did	not	come	up	with	this	idea	themselves,	but	rather	took	it	from The	Simpsons. They	sent	out	close	to	a	thousand	fake	letters	under	the	name	of	a marketing	group	only	to	have	a	little	over	half	a	dozen	show	up	at	the	La Mirada	Inn	for	their	free	prize:	A	BMW	238.	Nice,	eh?	Only	the	joke	was on	them	as	their	smiles	melted	upon	hearing	those	four	dirty	words, “You’re	all	under	arrest!” The	poor	saps	even	brought	ID	to	verify	their	identities.	Dumb.	They might	as	well	have	slapped	on	the	cuffs	themselves. And	this	is	an	OFFLINE	example.	Imagine	what	one	department	can do	by	lying	alone	to	an	ISP	or	search	engine.	Threats	of	fines.	Warrants. Bad	publicity.	Subpoenas	of	users.	A	bad	reputation	they	are	not	likely	to recover	from	soon.	Police	in	Vegas	in	particular	love	to	play	dirty	like this,	dredging	up	old	laws	to	ensure	every	member	in	that	Ferbie operation	has	the	book	thrown	at	him. 	In	2013,	a	Secret	Service	Agent	arrested	several	online	by	selling them	fake	IDs.	The	kicker? They	were	all	charged	under	the	RICO	Act	of	1970.	Originally created	to	put	away	mobsters,	it	allows	them	to	lasso	entire	groups	and charge	each	individual	as	if	he	committed	the	same	crime	everyone	else in	the	group	did…	no	matter	the	role. Translation:	The	courier	gets	the	same	treatment	as	the	ringleader, as	do	the	buyers.	Individually,	not	much	prison	time	in	the	grand	scheme of	things	in	1970,	but	being	charged	as	a	GROUP?	Twenty	years minimum.	Al	Capone	never	saw	such	a	hefty	sentence. It	simply	doesn’t	matter	to	a	prosecutor	if	you’re	OS	is	encrypted and	they	can’t	get	the	data.	All	they	need	to	prove	is	that	you	were	part	of the	 enterprise	operation.	That	can	be	done	outside	of	your	shiny	new Western	Digital	hard	drive	by	subpoena	to	your	ISP	and	a	few	other services	you	subscribe	to.	They’ve	done	this	 and	succeeded 	with	the newsgroup	porn	bust	years	ago	in	which	every	member	of	that	hideous pedo	group	had	encryption	coming	out	of	their	ears. Here	was	the	short	list	of	rules	in	that	group. -	Never	reveal	true	identity	to	another	member	of	the	group   -	Never	communicate	with	a	member	of	the	group	outside	usenet -	Group	membership	remains	strictly	within	the	confines	of	the Internet -	No	member	can	positively	identify	another -	Members	do	not	reveal	personally	identifying	information -	Primary	communications	newsgroup	is	migrated	regularly -	If	a	member	breaks	a	security	rule fails	to	encrypt	a	message=BAN -	Periodically	reduce	chance	of	law	enforcement	discovery	on	each newsgroup	migration	by: -	Creating	new	PGP	key	pair,	unlinking	from	previous	messages -	Each	member	creates	a	new	nickname -	Nickname	theme	selected	by	Yardbird	 Group	leader  	The	affidavits	read	like	a	Hell’s	Angels	list	of	rules.	And	though	I disagree	with	his	 the	website	owner,	not	Yardbird 	conclusion	that “there	are	basically	no	nice	people	who	provide	case	studies	of	OPSEC practices,”	I	believe	much	can	be	learned	by	studying	the	habits	of	law- abiding	citizen	and	criminal	alike,	especially	considering	the	wide	net over	which	the	NSA	is	casting	over	law	abiding	citizens. Remember	that	in	Nazi	Germany,	if	you	slandered	the	SS,	it	was considered	a	capital	offense.	The	film	‘Sophie	Scholl’	is	an	excellent example	of	underground	resistance	movement	for	the	right	reason.	It won	accolades	for	its	realistic	portrayal	of	a	college	woman	who	stood	up to	the	SS	elite	and	was	beheaded	for	it. North	Korea,	Now.	Same	thing.	They’d	have	little	issues	with	doing worse.	Beheading	might	be	almost	too	lenient	for	them	as	they	prefer prolonged,	tortuous	environments	for	their	subjects.	China?	China	has done	some	strange	things,	like	outlawing	stripping	at	funerals	and banning	Bitcoin	transactions,	and	I	do	recall	the	violent	protests	by Muslims	in	2010	and	thinking	“Those	communist	schmucks	will	round up	all	those	screaming	fools	and	shoot	them	at	dawn	and	not	look	back!” My	Chinese	girlfriend	leaned	over	to	me	as	we	watched	and mumbled,	“They	won’t	wait	till	dawn.” I	like	to	think	of	Darkcoin	as	Bitcoin’s	smarter	brother.	Much smarter	in	fact,	and	darker.	The	best	part	of	course	being	that	it	is constantly	evolving.   Like	Bitcoin	they	are	a	privacy-centric	digital	money	based	on	the Bitcoin	design.	It’s	a	design	that	allows	for	anonymity	as	you	make	day- to-day	purchases	on,	well,	just	about	anything	so	long	as	the	digital	store offers	it.With	Bitcoin,	anyone	can	see	who	made	a	purchase	by	only	looking at	the	public	blockchain.	What	Darkcoin	does	is	anonymize	your transaction	further	by	using	 Master	 nodes	-	a	decentralized	network	of servers	that	negate	any	requirement	for	third-parties:	Parties	that	could scam	you	out	of	your	coins. Though	few	outlets	use	it,	it	is	one	of	the	quickest	growing	digital currencies	out	there,	with	an	economy	breaching	over	twenty	million. Impressive.	And	that’s	not	all.	It’s	“Darksend”	feature	is	quite	fascinating —increasing	privacy	by	compounding	a	typical	transaction	with	 two other	users. Needless	to	say,	this	is	immensely	attractive	to	a	lot	of	Tor	users who	value	high	anonymity.	Whistleblowers,	journalists,	underground political	movements.	That’s	the	good	list.	The	bad	list	though,	well,	you can	never	have	the	good	without	the	bad:	Terrorists.	Contract	killers.	Tax evaders.	Fallout	players	with	the	child-killing	perk. I	hear	the	same	arguments	against	its	use	that	I	heard	with	Freenet: Bad	guys	want	to	evade	detection.	Bad	guys	trade	Darkcoins.	You	use Darkcoins.	Therefore,	you’re	a	bad	guy.	Cue	torches	and	pitchforks	and black	cats	catapulted	over	the	moat. Heroin	dealers	love	to	use	cash	yet	you	never	hear	news	outlets screaming	about	cash-only	users	linking	to	such	a	crime.	Besides,	the most	corrupt	money	launderers	are	the	central	banks.	It	is	 they	that allow	states	to	borrow	from	future	citizens	to	pay	 today’s	debts.	One need	only	look	at	the	National	Debt	to	realize	this. But	that’s	not	to	say	Darkcoins	are	without	issues.	A	few	excellent questions	have	arisen: -	What	if	these	“Masternodes”	eventually	form	centralization? -	What	if	Darkcoin	is	abandoned	by	the	creators	once	the	price	goes through	the	roof? -	Who	is	trustworthy	enough	to	“audit”	Darkcoin?	We	saw	an	audit with	Truecrypt	in	2013	which	turned	out	to	show	no	backdoors…	except that	the	developers	shut	it	down	with	a	cryptic	message	saying   Truecrypt	was	Not	Secure	Anymore.	We	can	argue	all	day	about	what that	meant. These	questions	may	never	be	answered.	But	that	should	not	stop	us from	forging	a	new	frontier	in	anonymity	services. 	Using	Darkcoin	for	Business It	is	much	harder	to	run	a	Hidden	Tor	Service	than	it	is	to	open	a business	using	Darkcoin.	It’s	so	simple	really	that	it	boggles	the	mind what	might	be	available	in	the	future…	and	with	minimal	risk	to	you. If	this	appeals	to	you,	then	get	the	Darkcoin	Wallet.	This	is	used	to send receive store	Darkcoin	with	the	benefit	of	using	Darksend	for 100%	anonymity.	Most	of	your	patrons	will	want	you	to	have	a	wallet,	so better	to	learn	it	early	in	the	business	rather	than	later. 	Pick	a	Transaction	Processor Below	are	a	few	you	can	research	to	your	liking.	Not	every	processor will	suit	everyone	just	as	every	bank	or	credit	union	will	not	appeal	to everyone.	You	must	judge	these	yourself,	weighing	your	needs	with whatever	risk	your	business	entails.	I’ve	tried	most	of	these	and	came away	satisfied	but	like	everything	else	with	crypto	currency,	what	works for	me	may	not	work	for	you.

Darkcoin	Graphics	 courtesy	of	the	Darkcoin	homepage  After	this	you	should	signup	to	the	Merchant	Directory.   Then	 optionally ,	do	some	reading	on	InstantX.	InstantX	is	a	double spend	proof	instant	transaction	method	via	the	masternode	network.	Not exactly	light	reading,	but	the	more	you	know… 	No	single	entity	has	control	of	the	entire	system.	Though	the	chance of	an	accident	borders	on	the	 not	 likely,	you	need	to	remember	that Darkcoin	is	still	in	development	and	because	of	that,	unforeseen	things happen.	So	a	healthy	dose	of	due	diligence	is	required.	I	suggest	only purchasing	with	money	that	doesn’t	break	the	bank	in	case	bad	luck happens	upon	you. Frequent	backups	are	mandatory	for	your	wallet,	more	than	Bitcoin since	the	anonymizing	process	executes	more	transactions	in	the background.	If	you’ve	ever	used	Freenet,	you	know	how	slow	the network	can	be	and	how	much	of	a	system	resource	hog	anonymity	often requires.	Thus,	make	a	new	backup	of	your	wallet	whenever	a	you	hit	a coin	ceiling.   Eleven Tor	Hidden	Services How	to	Setup	a	Hidden	Service	on	Tor 	One	benefit	to	using	Tor	is	that	it	allows	you	to	create	hidden services	that	will	mask	your	identity	to	other	users.	In	fact,	you	can	have a	website	that	is	untraceable	to	you	personally,	provided	you’ve	taken	all security	precautions	to	keep	your	system	updated.	Here	is	an	example	of an	onion	site	only	accessible	by	using	Tor: http:  duskgytldkxiuqc6.onion  	Naturally	you	can’t	access	this	with	your	Firefox	browser	without Tor,	hence	the	“hidden”	name. This	chapter	will	give	you	the	basics	on	what	you	need	to	set	up your	own	Tor	hidden	service.	It’s	not	meant	to	be	all-inclusive	that covers	everything	and	the	kitchen	sink,	but	only	to	give	you	an	idea	of the	technical	know-how	you	need	to	possess. 	Step	One:	Ensure	Tor	Works Follow	the	directions	on	installing	Tor,	securing	it	against	exploits and	security	vulnerabilities	first	and	foremost. Each	OS	has	it’s	own	vulnerabilities,	with	Windows	being	the	worst. I	recommend	you	go	with	Linux	after	you’ve	mastered	the	basics	as	it gives	you	more	control	over	Tor	and	is	far	more	resistant	to	attacks	than Windows. Now	might	be	a	good	time	to	state	the	obvious,	something	you’ve probably	realized	by	now,	and	that	is	this:	That	no	two	counter- intelligence	experts	ever	do	the	same	thing	the	same	way	all	the	time. There	is	no	red	pill	that	makes	it	“All	Clear.”	No	cheat	sheet	of	Magic Opsec	Sauce	that	everyone	can	master	if	they	only	gulp	it	down.	You	can’t memorize	every	organic	compound	combination	in	Organic	Chemistry. Believe	me,	I	tried.	There	were	far	too	many.   What	you	do	however	is	memorize	the	 general	 principles,	from which	you	can	derive	a	solution	to	every	problem	that	comes	about. Anonymity	is	sometimes	like	that.	Your	strengths	will	not	be	your neighbor’s	strengths.	Your	weaknesses	will	be	different	as	well.	You adapt	as	you	go	along,	and	I	can	guarantee	you	your	skills	as	a	hobbyist will	far	exceed	those	working	on	the	government	dole. 	Step	Two:	Installing	Your	Own	Web	Server A	local	web	server	is	the	first	thing	you	need	to	configure.	It	is	a	bit more	involved	than	space	here	allows	 without	jacking	the	price . You	also	want	to	keep	this	local	server	separate	from	any	other installations	that	you	have	to	avoid	cross-contamination.	In	fact,	you don’t	want	ANY	links	between	your	hidden	server	and	your	day-to-day computer	usage	outside	Tor. Your	server	must	be	set	to	disallow	any	data	leaks	that	might	give away	your	identity.	So	you	must	attach	the	server	to	localhost	only.	If you’re	swapping	trade	secrets	and	don’t	want	the	boss	to	know,	use	a virtual	machine	to	prevent	DNS	and	other	data	leaks,	but	only	if	you	can access	the	physical	host	yourself.	Professional	web	hosting	services	 i.e. the	Cloud 	are	a	big	no-no	since	it	is	stupid	easy	for	the	admin	to	snatch your	encryption	keys	from	RAM. Go	to	http:  localhost:8080 	via	browser,	since	that	is	the	port- number	you	entered	at	creation.	Copy	a	text	doc	to	the	usual	html-folder and	ensure	it	copies	successfully	by	logging	into	the	webpage. 	Configuration Now	comes	the	part	where	most	people	quit.	Don’t	worry,	it	isn’t hard.	It’s	just	that	beginners	see	these	numbers	and	think	“Oh	no… math!”	and	throw	the	book	out	the	window. But	that’s	not	what	you’ll	do…	because	you’re	a	smart	cookie. First,	set	your	hidden-service	to	link	to	your	own	web-server.	You can	use	Notepad	to	open	your	“torrc”	file	within	Tor	directory	and	do	a search	for	the	following	piece	of	code:		This	section	is just	for	location-hidden	services	 As	you	can	see,	the	hidden	services	function	of	Tor	is	edited	out	by the	 “”	 sign,	 where	 each	 row	 relates	 to	 a	 hidden	 service.   HiddenServiceDir	is	the	section	that	will	house	all	data	about	your	own hidden	service.	Within	this	will	be	the	hostname.file.	This	is	where	your onion-url	will	be. The	“HiddenServicePort”	allows	you	to	set	a	decoy	port	for	redirects to	throw	off	any	efforts	at	detecting	you.	So	add	these	to	your	torrc	file. HiddenServiceDir	LibraryTor var lib tor hidden_service  HiddenServicePort	80	127.0.0.1:8080 Next,	alter	the	HiddenServiceDir	to	the	real	directory	from	which Tor	runs. Windows,	 use:	 For	 HiddenServiceDir C:\Users\username\Documents\tor\hidden_service	HiddenServicePort 80	127.0.0.1:8080 	For	 homeusername hidden_service ,	 Linux:	 substituting “username”	with	whatever	you	named	that	directory. 	Restart	Tor	after	saving	the	Torrc-file	and	it	should	be	operational. Check	your	spelling	if	it	throws	out	any	errors. Now	then.	Two	files	are	created:	the	private_key	and	the	hostname; private	keys	for	your	hidden	service	which	you	should	keep	under	lock and	key.	The	hostname	is	not	your	private	key,	however.	You	can	give this	to	anyone	you	wish. A	descriptor	for	the	hidden	service	links	to	other	Tor	servers	and their	 respective	 directories	 so	 that	 Tor	 users	 can	 download	 it anonymously	when	they	link	or	access	to	your	hidden	server. 	Other	points	of	note -	Visitors	to	your	hidden	service	may	be	able	to	identify	whether your	web-server	is	Thttpd	or	Apache. -	If	your	offline	50%	of	the	time,	so	will	your	hidden	service.	Little bits	 or	lengthy	ones,	in	this	case 	of	data	like	this	are	useful	to	an adversary	creating	a	profile	on	you. -	It	is	wiser	to	create	a	hidden	service	on	Tor	clients	versus	Tor relays	as	the	relay	uptime	is	visible	to	the	public. -	Be	aware	that	you	are	not	a	Node	by	default.	On	that	point,	it	is advised	to	not	have	a	relay	running	on	the	same	machine	as	your	hidden   service	as	this	opens	security	risks. 	Shallot	and	Scallion	Option You	also	have	the	option	of	using	Shallot	or	Scallion.	Shallot	allows one	to	create	a	customized	.onion	address	for	a	hidden	service,	such	as yyyyynewbietestyyyy.onion	On	Running	a	Hidden	Tor	Server	 and	other Opsec	Magic	Sauce 	Having	used	Tor	for	many	years,	it	came	as	a pleasant	surprise	to	learn	how	few	incidents	there	were	in	which	the NSA	managed	to	disrupt	Tor.	And	I	don’t	mean	spam,	either,	but	rather something	that	brought	large	sections	of	the	network	to	a	grinding	halt. As	it	turns	out,	they’re	bark	is	much	worse	than	their	bite,	especially	if one	is	vigilant	with	their	own	secure	setup. The	thing	is,	most	Tor	users	couldn’t	be	bothered.	But	then	most users	aren’t	interested	in	running	a	hidden	server	just	as	most	P2P	users don’t	bother	seeding.	Most	are	hit	n’	run	downloaders.	They	know	that	as U.S.	citizens	they	stand	a	good	chance	of	getting	sued	if	they	leave	their balls	out	there	long	enough.	So	some	users	opt	to	not	further	their	own security	knowledge.	Let	the	Tor	devs	do	it,	they	say.	Can’t	be	bothered. Except	most	of	the	Tor	advice	by	Tor	developers	I’ve	read	come	up woefully	inadequate.	In	fact	I	find	that	they	aren’t	paranoid	 nearly enough.	It’s	always	been	my	belief	that	you	can	never	be	sufficiently paranoid	as	far	as	protecting	your	freedom	is	concerned,	since	the powers	that	be	want	to	capture	it	and	bottle	it	the	way	a	cancer	captures control	of	a	cell:	One	organelle	at	a	time	with	little	of	it’s	environment aware	of	the	slow-boiling	attack.	To	be	honest…	I	suspect	they	depend	on apathy	and	ignorance.	And	a	lot	of	users	gladly	oblige. Mr.	Frog,	meet	boiling	pot	of	water. So	then,	what	can	we	do?	Well	for	starters,	we	can	get	the	right security	mindset.   Twelve Tor	&	Your	Rig  Tor	and	Your	PC A	secure	computer	is	your	best	defense	as	the	NSA	mostly	relies	on man-in-the-middle	attacks	and	browser	exploits	that	deliver	payloads	to hidden	Tor	servers.	That	said,	you	should	anticipate	and	expect	such	an exploit	can	infiltrate	your	system	at	any	point.	Things	like	Nits	 network bugs ,	you	have	to	be	aware	of.	Thus	the	need	to	adhere	to	the	following: Use	Linux	whenever	possible.	Yes,	I	know	you’re	comfortable	using Windows	and	think	Linux	too	much	of	a	bother.	But	you	won’t	if	you’re ISP	is	subpoenaed	for	something	you	said	on	Facebook.	Something	anti- feminist,	for	instance.	So	learn	to	use	it. The	powers	that	be	typically	target	the	weakest	system	and	the laziest	users.	The	Tor	Browser	Bundle	for	Windows	was	instrumental	in taking	down	Freedom	Hosting	and	Silk	Road	because	of	unpatched vulnerabilities.	That,	and	a	few	rogue	Tor	exit	nodes	patched	unsigned Windows	packages	to	spread	malware. If	you’re	new	to	Linux,	look	at	Linux	Mint.	If	you’re	experienced, Debian	is	a	good	choice.	Windows	can’t	be	trusted	primarily	because	it	is closed-source,	but	also	because	malware	is	more	effective	on	it	than Linux.	If	Linux	is	out	of	the	question,	consider	Tails	or	Whonix	as	these apps	come	preconfigured	to	not	allow	any	outgoing	connections	to clearnet. 	Update	Update	Update Your	PC	must	also	be	updated,	always.	Not	updating	leads	to vulnerabilities	and	exploits	such	as	those	in	Windows.	Optimally,	you should	ensure	Tails	is	always	updated	each	time	you	use	Tor,	and	avoid any	sites	that	use	Java Javascript Flash	or	any	kind	of	scripting	as	these execute	code	in	ways	you	cannot	see.	Use	these	only	in	an	emergency	and never	in	your	home	system. Avoid	using	cookies	wherever	possible.	Consider	installing	the	Self-   Destructing	Cookies	add-on. Again,	you	should	not	use	anything	but	a	portable	PC	since	your home	PC	is	most	likely	not	portable	enough	to	be	discarded	in	a	trash	can in	the	event	of	compromise. Avoid	Google	wherever	possible.	Use	DuckDuckGo	or	Startpage instead	for	Tor	sessions. 	Situation	Awareness Here	we	go	again.	But	reading	things	three	times	often	becomes	a trigger	in	the	brain	later	on	for	taking	action,	so	here	it	is. If	an	agency	can	monitor	your	local	connection	as	well	as	the	link you	are	browsing,	then	 with	sufficient	resources 	they	can	apply	traffic analysis	to	pinpoint	your	real	location.	Therefore,	I	recommend	you	do not	use	Tor	in	your	residence. Just	to	clarify,	do	not	use	Tor	in	your	 legal	residence	if	doing	any kind	of	covert	work	or	anything	illegal	without	strict	security	measures in	place;	the	kind	the	average	Tor	user	will	likely	overlook.	Let	that	other guy	learn	his	lesson.	It’s	a	tough	break,	but	better	him	than	you.	He’s	a	19 year	old	named	Jimmy	who	likes	hacking.	You’re	a	32	year	old construction	guy	with	two	kids	and	a	mortgage.	Who	has	more	to	lose? Right,	you.	So	study	counter-surveillance	and	counter-forensics	like	your life	depends	on	it.	Because	it	does! For	enemies	of	the	state-level	operations,	I	would	suggest	not engaging	anything	even	near	your	online	PC	at	home.	Certainly	nothing that	makes	you	think	you	need	Tor	to	hide	it.	It	may	be	fine	for	private browsing	but	not	for	someone	planning	a	coup,	running	an	illegal operation	 home	bible	study	in	Iran,	for	instance ,	or	trying	to	disappear. Be	wary	of	using	it	in	hotels	as	well,	where	often	there	are	many cams	watching	with	24 hr	surveillance.	That	location	can	be	linked	to Tor	activity. Do	not	use	Tor	more	than	a	day	in	any	specific	location.	A correlation-attack	can	be	done	in	less	than	an	hour	if	a	black	van	is parked	nearby—a	van	you	will	not	see.	They	may	not	slap	the	cuffs	on you	as	you	walk	out	of	the	cafe	that	very	week,	but	later	they	might. Consider	the	area	a	toxic	dump	after	a	day,	regardless	if	you	must	travel to	the	next	shop	or	town.   If	you	want	to	get	really	cloak	and	dagger	about	it,	have	an	app running	 an	MMO,	for	instance 	while	you	are	out	and	about	doing	your Tor	activity	that	makes	it	look	like	you	were	home	during	that	time.   Thirteen Tor	Hidden	Services	Rules  High	Risk,	High	Reward 	CNN,	along	with	FoxNews	and	a	hotbed	of	other	media	outlets,	has been	trumpeting	the	defeat	of	certain	hidden	services	for	a	few	years now.	It	makes	for	good	headlines.	Services	like	Silk	Road	and	Freedom Hosting,	which	I’m	sure	you’ve	heard	about.	They	are	a	easy	target	for the	FBI	since	hidden	services	are	not	high	on	the	list	of	priorities	by	Tor developers	yet.	Same	for	the	NSA. Both	agencies	know	every	trick	and	hack	there	is	to	know	about running	a	hidden	service.	And	so	should	you.	This	is	not	to	say	you	need the	expertise	to	match	their	team	of	super	hackers,	but	that	you	need even	more	vigilance	to	run	such	a	service	than	you	do	 visiting	such	a service.Priority	number	one	is	simple:	if	you	run	one,	you	must	own	one. They	must	not	be	run	under	somebody	else’s	control	if	you	can	help	it, because	if	that	service	is	compromised,	everyone	goes	down.	That	means total	anonymity,	100%	of	the	time	with	world-class	jewel-thief	stealth ability.The	Silk	Road	admin	did	not	have	this	ability.	In	fact,	looking through	the	online	docs	detailing	the	arrest,	one	gets	the	impression	he was	very	lax	in	IT	security	procedure.	He	repeatedly	made	mistakes	such that	luck	on	the	part	of	LE	never	really	came	into	it	at	all.	The	guy	was just	sloppy. 	FirstNever,	ever,	ever	run	a	hidden	service	within	a	VM	that	is	owned	by a	friend	or	a	Cloud	space	provider.	Remember,	all	“The	Cloud”	is,	is someone	else’s	drive	or	network,	not	your	own.	Encryption	keys	can	be dumped	from	RAM.	And	who	owns	the	RAM? Right.	The	Cloud	provider.	Lightning	strikes	and	there	goes	your   own	anonymity	as	well	as	the	anonymity	of	your	visitors	if	they	are	lazy in	their	browser	habits.	The	FBI	delivered	a	“nit”	 network	investigative technique 	this	way	to	unpatched	Tor	Browser	Bundles	in	2013.	If, however,	you	own	the	machine,	then	it’s	a	different	story.	But	let’s	back up	a	few	steps	and	assume	you	don’t.	How	might	you	go	about	running	it on	a	host	system? Well	first	off,	you	would	need	two	separate	physical	hosts	from different	parties,	both	running	in	virtual	machines	with	a	firewall- enabled	OS	that	only	allows	Tor	network	activity	and	nothing	else. The	second	physical	host	is	the	one	the	hidden	service	runs	from, also	VM’ed.	Secure	connections	are	enabled	by	IPSec.	What’s	IPSec,	you ask?  “IPSec	 is	 a	 protocol	 suite,	 for	 securing	 Internet	 Protocol	  IP  communications	 by	 authenticating	 and	 encrypting	 each	 IP	 packet	 of	 a communication	session.	IPsec	can	be	used	in	protecting	data	flows	between a	 pair	 of	 hosts	  host-to-host ,	 between	 a	 pair	 of	 security	 gateways  network-to-network ,	or	between	a	security	gateway	and	a	host	 network- to-host .”  If	an	intruder	agent	tampers	with	anything,	you	will	know	about	it and	can	shut	down	the	service	or	move	it	to	a	safer	place,	and	all	while being	a	ghost	in	the	machine.	You	can	imagine	how	valuable	this	would be	in	North	Korea. If	you	were	in	that	cesspool	of	a	country,	you	would	be	more	than	a little	paranoid	if	the	server	went	down	even	for	a	few	seconds.	But	you could	always	move	it	to	a	more	secure	location	or	even	start	over,	and you	might	just	want	to	since	you	would	not	know	if	a	RAID	failure	had occurred	or	if	some	commie	jackboot	was	sending	a	copy	of	the	VM	to the	higher	ups. 	Second If	going	the	host	route,	you	must	ensure	that	remote-console	is always	available	to	you	by	the	host,	any	time	you	want.	You	must	do everything	remotely,	in	fact,	and	change	passwords	frequently	via	https. I’d	say	once	per	day	as	paranoia	in	such	a	climate	as	North	Korea	would be	good	for	your	health. 	   Third You	must	never,	not	even	once,	access	the	service	from	home.	Not from	your	Nexus	7.	Not	from	your	girlfriend’s	Galaxy	Note.	Not	even	via Tor	from	your	backyard	using	your	neighbor’s	WiFi.	Using	a	VPN	as	well is	risky	unless	you	know	what	you’re	doing.	Only	access	it	via	secure locations	at	least	ten	miles	away	from	your	residence.	Overkill,	some might	say,	but	then	there	is	no	such	thing	as	overkill	in	a	gulag. 	FourthMove	the	service	on	occasion.	Again,	look	at	any	Youtube	video	on how	snipers	train	to	take	out	an	enemy.	They	move	place	to	place	after each	shot	to	conceal	the	true	location	from	the	enemy.	How	often	is	up	to you.	Once	a	week?	Once	a	month?	Personally	I’d	say	every	twenty-one days.	You	can	never	be	too	secure	when	running	one	of	these.   Fourteen Darknet	Personas  living…	two	lives.	One	of	them	has	a	future,	and	one	does	not.”	—	Agent Smith,	The	Matrix 	  “We’ve	 been	 watching	 you	 Mr.	 Anderson,	 and	 it	 seems	 you’ve	 been  	You’ve	no	doubt	read	of	Tor	busts	where	an	undercover	agent snagged	a	phone	number	or	clearnet	nic	from	someone	they	were targeting	because	said	target	trusted	too	much,	too	quickly.	Take	it	from Yoda	-	You	can	avoid	this	by	retraining	yourself,	unlearning	what	you’ve learned.You	must	consider	your	Tor	sessions	the	property	of	your	other	Self. The	cloned	You	-	that	shadowy	thievish	looking	guy	above.	The	second You.	One	that	despises	Incubus	and	loves	Tool	and	views	Neo	as	just another	beta-orbiting	punk	who	got	the	luck	of	the	draw	when	Morpheus and	crew	unplugged	him.	This	clone	would	not	use	Twitter	or	YouTube or	other	social	gunk.	He	would	never	hang	with	you	nor	call	you	up	for	a few	beers.	In	fact,	he	hates	beer,	preferring	J&B	as	he	hacks	with	John Carpenter’s	The	Thing	OST	playing	as	mood	music	in	the	background.   That’s	your	other	You.	The	smarter	you. And	he	must	be	the	new	You	on	Tor.	And	you	must	forever	separate him	from	the	non-Tor	You. His	Facebook,	Twitter	and	YouTube	accounts	are	all	fake,	having never	once	used	them	on	his	home	PC. His	nics	are	different,	as	is	his	passwords,	likes dislikes	and	even the	fonts	he	uses	to	browse	the	Deep	Web.	Mixing	this	dark	persona	with your	own	would	be	like	the	boy	made	of	matter	kissing	the	anti-matter girl.Boom. Further,	any	phone	calls	this	person	makes	is	done	by	prepaid phones	that	were	not	purchased	by	any	credit	cards	he	holds.	He	is	a cash	n’	carry	guy	and	then	only	if	he	is	twenty	miles	from	home.	Any	SIM cards	he	uses	are	strictly	used	in	conjunction	with	Tor	activity	and	never used	in	phones	the	other	guy	uses.	And…	he	deliberately	leaves	false	info wherever	he	goes.	Kinda	like	the	CIA	does. But	to	better	clarify	this	idea,	let’s	assume	John	Doe	doesn’t	know any	better.	He	watches	a	movie	on	Netflix.	Then	he	mosies	on	over	to Freenet	and	drops	intel	without	even	realizing	it,	eager	to	share	his	great cinema	experience	with	his	darknet	buds	 no	pun . “Hey	guys,	just	watched	a	cool	flick	with	Russell	Crowe.	Kinda Michael	Bay-ish	and	Liam	Neeson’s	cameo	was	too	short,	but	makes	for	a good	flick	if	you	want	to	learn	how	to	disappear.	But	those	police,	sweet Jesus!	Those	rent-a-cop	guys	sure	are	as	dumb	as	a	sack	of	bricks!” Police	are	dumb,	he	says. Metadata	is	collected	by	Netflix	just	as	it	is	with	Google	and	Yahoo. Every	single	user.	They	know	every	film	you	viewed	and	even	which ones	you	hated.	He’s	even	made	forum	posts	indicating	similar	weather and,	though	not	mentioning	names,	has	griped	about	local	politicians being	handcuffed	in	very	geo-specific	arrests,	even	dropping	the	charges! How	many	Netflix	fans	do	you	think	watched	this	movie	at	the	time of	his	Freenet	post?	How	many	in	cities	that	had	local	politicians	arrested for	embezzling?	How	many	with	similar	weather	depicted	in	the	film? Most	likely	less	than	ten.	Maybe	not	even	that. There	is	also	the	handwriting	element.	Does	he	 mispell	the	same words	over	and	over?	Throw	commas	like	daggers?	Misuse	semi-colons   and	run-on	sentences?	System	clock	out	of	sync	with	his	posts?	All	of	this leads	to	a	great	profile	that	ties	his	IP	address	to	his	identity.	Often	it	is enough	to	get	a	warrant	if	he	so	much	as	whispers	that	he’s	obtained	any kind	of	contraband. Unless	of	course,	all	of	this	info	is	tailor-made	to	fit	the	other	You. We	already	know	that	the	VPN	called	Hide-My-Ass	as	well	as Hushmail	and	Lavabit	stabbed	their	users	in	the	back	when	threats	by	a judge	became	too	heated	 $5000	a	day	in	Lavabit’s	case,	until	they	forked over	user	data .	And	all	this	just	so	they	could	track	Edward	Snowden. Bottom	line:	Learn	from	Snowden’s	mistakes.	Take	every	company’s claim	of	anonymity	with	a	grain	of	salt.	The	proof	is	in	the	amount	of arrests	tied	to	said	company	or	app.	In	the	case	of	Freenet,	none. But	there	is	always	a	first	time.	Recall	that	they	only	have	to	get lucky	once,	which	more	often	than	not	relies	on	your	carelessness.   Usenet:	The	Ultimate	Guide   Table	of	Content What	is	Usenet? The	Best	Newsgroups The	Best	Usenet	Apps Usenet	Reviews:	Who	Sucks.	Who	Doesn’t Usenet	Anonymity Things	That	Break	Anonymity Moderated	Usenet Which	VPNs	You	Can	Trust The	Cloud   What	is	Usenet?  You’ve	probably	heard	the	term	“Usenet”	floating	around	various tech	forums	of	one	flavor	or	another.	Some	liken	the	technology	as	being similar	to	P2P,	while	others	state	that	it	is	nothing	like	P2P.	In	truth,	it has	a	little	bit	of	both	systems	in	that 1. 	you	can	find	almost	any	kind	of	file	therein,	such	as	mp3s,	games, movies	and	the	like	and 2. 	you	have	the	ability	to	upload	and	download	anything	you	like. Pretty	neat. Since	its	inception	in	1979	by	two	Duke	graduate	students,	Usenet has	leapt	beyond	all	expectations	in	regards	to	not	only	data	retention, but	enhancing	freedom	of	speech.	Whereas	users	were	once	inundated with	extra	charges	per	month	for	downloading	a	handful	of	data,	they now	have	the	ability	to	download	terabytes	per	month,	and	pay ridiculously	small	sums	to	do	so.	This	has	all	been	done	with	the	help	of not	only	thousands	of	server	farms	across	the	world,	but	also	by	legions of	longtime	Usenet	users	who	upload	 and	leech 	every	kind	of	data	file in	existence.	Thus,	the	true	ingredients	for	the	worldwide	success	of Usenet	hasn’t	been	so	much	because	of	Usenet	providers	themselves,	but by	end-user	subscribers	who	faithfully	upload	the	latest	movie,	game	and music	releases	every	month	to	the	over	100,000	available	newsgroups on	Usenet.What	typically	happens	when	the	average	Joe	off	the	street	wants	to subscribe	to	Usenet?	He	usually	ends	up	test	driving	a	free	trial	by	one	of the	dozens	of	Usenet	providers	for	a	period	of	two	weeks,	and	then	like any	P2P	user,	they	are	hooked	for	life.	Or	at	least,	the	life	of	the subscription. And	that	subscription	will	likely	last	a	long	time. Why? The	answer	lies	in	the	perceived	value	of	the	goods	he	acquires through	said	Usenet	subscription. As	mentioned,	the	worth	of	the	goods	acquired	far	outweighs	the   monthly	fee	of	the	Usenet	provider.	There	are	over	100,000	newsgroups, with	the	large	majority	of	them	being	TEXT	groups	rather	than	BINARY groups	 i.e.	where	the	real	meat	of	Usenet	is	stored .	The	dirty	little secret	among	longtime	Usenet	users	is	this:	Usenet	would	not	be	one- tenth	as	popular	as	it	is	if	it	weren’t	for	the	bulk	of	groups	like alt.binaries.boneless,	alt.binaries.hdtv	and	alt.binaries.complete_cd. One	could	make	the	argument	that	text	discussions	certainly	have their	place	that	benefits	society	in	some	manner,	however	the	bottom line	is	that	file	sharing	 again,	mp3s,	movies	and	games 	make	up	the bulk	of	not	only	Usenet,	but	is	the	reason	Usenet	companies	have	been able	to	grow	their	businesses	at	exponential	rates.   Usenet	vs.	P2P  If	you’ve	paid	attention	to	the	news	media	outlets	over	the	past	ten years,	you’re	aware	of	the	inherent	risks	associated	with	using	P2P systems	like	Emule,	Limewire	and	the	like	in	acquiring	copyrighted material.When	you	fire	up	a	P2P	program	like	Emule,	you	participate	in downloading	with	your	IP	address	out	in	the	open,	from	which	peers	run by	law	enforcement	 i.e.	NordicMule 	or	the	Recording	Industry	can monitor	the	source	and	destination	with	every	file	you	transmit	through the	network.	P2P	in	effect	requires	its	participants	to	upload	as	well	as download.	It	is	not	so	different	than	downloading	torrents	in	this	regard. Usenet	on	the	other	hand,	encourages	leeching	without	uploading. While	you	certainly	have	the	freedom	to	upload,	your	download speeds	are	not	crippled	if	you	decide	only	to	lurk	and	leech	from	the uploads	of	others.	What	is	more,	you	do	so	at	your	full	internet	speed, unlike	peer-to-peer	systems,	where	you	are	often	at	the	mercy	of	others in	the	swarm. When	someone	uploads	a	copyrighted	film	 Avengers,	for	instance  on	a	p2p	or	torrent	system,	it	is	far	easier	to	track	said	uploader	to	an	ip address	which	leads	straight	to	their	front	door.	If	however	the	uploader used	a	premium	Usenet	provider	to	upload	the	film,	the	movie	industry lawyer	must	first	get	his	subscriber	information	from	the	Usenet company	them	before	any	action	is	taken.	If	he	accessed	his	Usenet account	through	a	vpn	provider,	and	used	anonymous	means	to	pay	for his	Usenet	account,	then	that	adds	a	further	layer	of	privacy	that	the entertainment	industry	lawyers	will	have	to	peel	back	in	order	to	reveal his	identity.	We’ll	discuss	later	on	the	fruitfulness	of	signing	up anonymously	with	Usenet	and	Vpn	providers. Pros	to	Usenet: Not	dependent	on	seeders	like	torrents Uses	full	bandwidth	available	on	your	internet	connection   For	users	who	value	privacy  MPAA	 Movie	Industry ,	RIAA	 Recording	Industry 	cannot	see your	downloads	as	they	can	with	torrents Can	utilize	SSL	to	encrypt	data	en	route	to	your	pc	 unlike torrents  In	its	30	year	history,	no	one	has	ever	been	sued	for downloading	anything	off	Usenet	 again,	unlike	with	torrents  Cons	to	Usenet: requires	a	paid	subscription	to	access	older	posts posting reading	comments	require	a	newsreader not	as	easily accessible	as	torrent	sites 	Signing	up	for	Usenet For	those	who	are	simply	not	concerned	about	privacy,	you	may confidently	resist	the	upselling	offers	of	your	Usenet	provider’s advertisements	regarding	SSL.	At	signup	for	some	of	the	lesser	known Usenet	providers,	the	advertising	might	incline	you	to	believe	that	you absolutely	have	to	have	SSL	as	an	option,	otherwise	your	PC	will certainly	be	hacked	by	all	manner	of	gremlins,	evil	gnomes	and	other bogeymen.	Do	not	believe	it.	SSL	often	comes	free	with	a	subscription	to the	major	providers,	however	some	providers	will	still	charge	extra	for it. 	 Some	Usenet	providers	accept	bitcoins	as	a	method	of	payment.	If you	are	going	to	be	uploading	a	large	amount	of	legally	questionable	files and	are	based	in	the	US,	it	might	be	prudent	to	sign	up	anonymously	for	a Usenet	account.	Do	not	use	any	kind	of	payment	that	carries	personal information	about	you,	such	as	your	name,	bank	and	the	like. The	answer	to	this	question	is:	sort	of.	Yes,	you	can	download	with impunity.	Yes,	it	encrypted	the	data	in	route	to	your	pc,	from	which	point it	is	decrypted	with	the	decryption	key.	Most	Usenet	providers	do	not  Isn’t	Uploading	to	Usenet	Anonymous	with	SSL	Enabled?  For	users	who	value	anonymity   keep	download	logs	of	what	you	siphon	from	the	binary	Usenet newsgroups.	 However,	 the	 catch	 if	 you	 upload,	 certain is	 that	 information	is	left	as	breadcrumbs	to	your	Usenet	account.	Your messages,	in	addition	to	your	uploads	 all	of	them 	contain	unique header	identification	breadcrumbs,	so	to	speak. If	for	instance	you	were	part	of	some	conspiracy	group	of	assassins and	shouted	in	some	obscure	newsgroup	that	you	were	going	to assassinate	the	president	of	the	United	States,	then	the	Secret	Service could	look	at	your	headers	and	find	out	from	the	Usenet	provider	where you	lived	if	you	did	not	sign	up	anonymously.	The	nntp	posting	host	&	X- Trace	lines	accomplish	this	as	it	often	relays	the	identity	of	the	Usenet server,	which	in	turn	leads	to	your	specific	account. The	Secret	Service	would	have	no	idea	that	YOU	posted	it,	but	they would	know	you	used	Astraweb	or	Easynews	to	post	it.	They	in	all probability	would	not	even	need	a	subpoena	for	subscriber	information, as	most	of	the	big	Usenet	providers	would	gladly	provide	subscriber information	that	involved	terrorist	threats,	illegal	porn	or	identity	fraud  spam	is	a	bit	more	involved,	but	then	again,	the	Secret	Service	doesn’t investigate	Usenet	spam . There	also	exists	the	possibility	that	the	header	could	be	encrypted by	the	Usenet	server	themselves,	in	which	case	it	can	only	be	decrypted by	them.	The	header	might	have	some	lengthy	mosaic	of	jumbled	letters mixed	in	with	numbers.	It	might	say	“sdauhjk7tt324-=asdsad”,	which	of course	would	be	unreadable	to	anyone	except	the	Usenet	provider,	as they	hold	the	decryption	key	and	no	other	Usenet	provider	does. It	is	somewhat	similar	in	concept	to	the	headers	from	a	free	email service	such	as	Yahoo	or	Hotmail.	This	is	how	the	hacker	who	pried	into vice-presidential	 candidate	 Sarah	 Palin’s	 email	 was	 arrested:	 by revealing	the	headers	in	the	address	bar.	The	FBI	took	this	information from	a	screenshot	the	hacker	had	posted	and	traced	it	back	to	the	source. A	vpn	service	would	not	have	helped	in	such	a	scenario,	since	they themselves	are	bound	by	the	law,	and	most	of	them	reside	in	the	US anyway.	The	only	way	he	would	have	gotten	away	with	it	 that	is, bragging	via	a	screenshot	of	her	email	account	with	the	header	exposed  is	if	he	had	used	Tor	to	do	so	from	step	one. Ironically	enough,	it	seems	that	a	hacker’s	worst	enemy	is	himself.   The	Best	Newsgroups worth	 newsgroups	 binary	 Recommended	 exploring: Alt.binaries.hdtv:	This	is	perhaps	the	quintessential	newsgroup	that carries	almost	any	kind	of	high	definition	material	you	could	ever	want. Documentaries,	mainstream	films,	tv	shows	and	the	like	can	be	found here	free	for	the	taking.	Be	aware	that	many	movies	here	tend	to	be passworded.	Thus,	it	is	prudent	to	download	the	first	rar	file	of	the	set, extract	it,	and	preview	it.	Winrar	will	complain	that	it	is	broken,	but extract	it	anyway.	You’ll	get	a	ten	minute	preview	of	the	film,	or	it	will complain	about	the	lack	of	a	password	entered.	Some	passwords	can only	be	gained	from	private	forums.	If	you	see	a	movie	you	desperately want	from	the	group,	but	was	passworded,	ask	which	forum	you	can	join to	extract	the	file. Alt.binaries.hdtv.x264:	Don’t	want	to	have	to	wait	for	eons	for	a	50 gigabyte	movie	to	download	from	the	hdtv	group	above?	Try	its	sister group,	which	is	a	group	dedicated	to	re-encodes	of	most	of	the	popular movie	and	tv	titles.	Re-encoders	will	take	a	fifty	gigabyte	movie	and compress	it	down	to	an	8-12	gigabyte	file,	preserving	much	of	the	picture quality	of	the	original	fifty	gigabyte	movie.	Not	recommended	if	you watch	HD	on	a	projector	or	own	a	tv	that	is	42’	inches	and	above. However	for	those	with	a	27’	inch	monitor tv,	you	will	not	see	much difference	as	long	as	the	encoder	has	done	a	decent	job. Alt.binaries.boneless:	This	is	an	all-around	depositing	group	where all	manner	of	files	can	be	uploaded.	Anything	and	everything	gets dumped	here,	and	is	one	of	the	largest	groups	on	Usenet.	Only recommended	to	those	with	very	fast	internet	connections,	as	the	header count	often	takes	over	an	hour	on	an	average	connection.	Most	of	the group	carries	everything	you	can	imagine,	which	admittedly	can	be	quite jarring	for	newcomers	as	there	doesn’t	seem	to	be	any	“one”	topic	for	the group.Alt.binaries.movie.divx:	This	group	is	much	like	the	hdtv	groups, however	few	movies	are	here	in	HD,	saving	the	downloader	hours	worth   of	downloading	time.	If	you’re	not	sure	if	a	film	is	worth	owning,	it	might prove	prudent	to	test-drive	it	first	with	a	much	smaller	size.	Most	movies here	are	in	the	one	to	two	gigabyte	size	range	which	is	sufficient	for	a laptop	or	phone,	but	you’ll	notice	a	substantial	difference	on	a	28	inch monitor	as	opposed	to	a	dvd	with	a	decent	bitrate. Alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.blues:	  substitute	 your	 favorite	 genre instead	of	blues,	such	as	celtic,	jazz,	new-age,	rock,	heavy-metal,	classical, christian,	etc .	Be	aware	than	many	of	the	mp3	groups	have	strict	posting guidelines	in	their	faqs,	and	will	report	you	to	your	usenet	provider	if you	spam	said	groups	with	off-topic	mp3s.	However,	they	offer	a	very narrowly-defined	listening	experience	depending	on	your	favorite musical	tastes. Alt.binaries.games:	The	main	group	for	posting	pc-related	games, yet	some	console	game	get	posted	here	rather	than	their	specified groups.	Be	weary	of	viruses	in	this	group,	irregardless	of	how	big	the	file is.	A	good	anti-virus	program	is	paramount	if	you	are	going	to	be downloading	from	this	group	with	any	regularity.	Disable	“autoplay”	in your	operating	system,	as	many	a	game	iso	will,	when	mounted,	launch	a virus	at	the	first	execution	of	the	windows	autoplay	feature.	The	iso format	itself	is	not	to	blame,	but	rather	the	file	that	lie	within	the	folders themselves	on	the	disc	image	can	be	virulent. Alt.binaries.dox:	missing	an	nfo	file	for	a	game?	This	is	the	place	to ask.	Game	manuals	are	also	uploaded	here,	along	with	most	every	nfo	file you	can	imagine	from	every	“scene”	group	in	existence. A	word	of	caution	concerning	binary	groups:	You	will	not	see	much philosophical	discussion	in	these	“binaries”	groups,	aside	from	bickering about	broken	rars not	enough	pars	and	endless	requests.	If	you	want political	or	academic	debate,	subscribe	to	the	lengthy	list	 there	are thousands 	of	alt	groups	that	do	not	have	“binaries”	in	the	title.   for	  The	Best	Usenet	Apps Over	the	past	ten	years,	Usenet	companies	have	made	significant progress	in	simplifying	what	was	originally	a	very	cumbersome	process for	Usenet	customers.	After	subscribing	to	a	Usenet	provider,	it	is	now ridiculously	simple	to	access	the	treasures	that	Usenet	holds. Basics	of	Using	Newsgroups Downloading:	When	you	sign	up	for	a	ten	dollar month	plan,	your NSP	 Newsgroup	Service	Provider 	will	email	you	three	things:	your  i.e. the	 server	 username,	 password,	 and	 news	 address	 news.astraweb.com	as	an	example .	There	are	many	different	Usenet tools	available	that	are	similar	in	function	to	how	a	browser	works.	You can	opt	for	the	simpler	method,	which	requires	downloading	an	.nzb	file from	free	sites	like	Binsearch,	NZBIndex,	or	Newzbin	 paid 	and	then importing	to	a	newsreader	or	downloader	of	your	choice.	One	of	the simplest	is	an	app	called	Nzb-o-Matic	Plus.	In	the	options	screen	of	the application,	just	insert	your	user pass	combo	and	the	server	address with	port	119,	then	set	a	destination	where	your	downloads	should reside.	You	can	even	choose	the	desktop.	It’s	that	simple.	There	are	other free	newsgroup	tools	available	as	well. Newshosting	Client	 requires	signup 	Free	The	Newshosting	client self-repairs	files	for	you	if	you	have	a	subscription	to	them.	However	this is	a	bit	redundant	since	Quickpar	and	Winrar	are	free. Easynews	Web	Interface	 requires	signup 	Free	The	Easynews Interface	is	similar	to	the	Newshosting	client	in	that	you	can	see thumbnails	of	the	files	posted,	if	they	are	passworded,	and	will	check	for errors	automatically. NewsBin	Pro	$20 SABnzbd	Free NewsLeecher	$20 Binreader	Free GrabIt	Free Unison	$29.99   EZ	Global	Search	$2.99 NZB-O-MATIC	Plus:	Free	Nzb-o-Matic	is	perhaps	the	easiest	out	of all	of	the	above	tools	to	hop	aboard	Usenet.	It	is	for	downloading	only however,	but	once	you	have	the	NZB	file,	you	simply	import,	set	your username pass	and	download	away. Uploading	is	a	bit	trickier,	but	by	no	means	are	you	required	to upload	anything	to	Usenet.	In	fact,	leeching	is	encouraged,	unlike torrents.	If	you	are	new	to	Usenet,	be	aware	that	anything	you	upload outside	of	a	private	proxy	or	Tor	will	leave	your	IP	address	exposed. Take	care	if	you	are	unsure	if	your	uploads	are	copyrighted	or	not.	As they	say,	luck	favors	the	prepared. How	to	Upload	to	Usenet:	 if	you	have	no	intention	of	uploading, skip	this 	The	process	of	uploading	a	small	file	is	not	extraordinarily different	than	uploading	a	large	file.	The	main	difference	is	that uploading	a	large	file,	say	gigabytes	in	size,	takes	hours	on	a	slow	DSL connection.	Nevertheless,	let’s	go	through	some	admittedly	simplified steps	on	how	to	do	so.	You’ll	need	some	free	tools	to	do	so,	though	these are	fairly	mandatory	to	the	entire	process.	They	are:	Winrar	-	for archiving	the	files.	You	can’t	upload	a	single	25	gigabyte	Blu-Ray	movie to	Usenet	without	risking	it	failing	or	timing	out.	Thus,	it	is	better	to	use Winrar	to	break	up	your	movie	file	in	small	chunks	and	upload	those. You	would	be	pretty	angry	if	you	spent	two	days	downloading	a	Blu-Ray file	only	to	find	out	that	it	“skips”	in	the	middle	of	the	film.	Thus,	Winrar and	Quickpar	solve	this	problem	by	testing	the	authenticity	for	broken parts.	Once	you	have	Winrar	installed,	right	click	on	the	file	and	select “Add	to	Archive”	from	the	Winrar	context	menu.	Winrar	adds	this	to	the windows	context	menu,	thus	with	a	simple	right	click	you	can	archive any	file	no	matter	the	size.	Just	be	sure	and	choose	an	appropriate	size	to upload.	One	hundred	megabyte	chunks	is	sufficient	for	anything	over	1 gigabyte	in	size. Smaller	files	like	mp3s	usually	are	fine	with	the	mp3s	non-archived, but	will	come	with	par	files	to	repair	any	redundancies errors	in	them. When	downloaders	finish	downloading	all	the	rar	pieces,	they	can	right click	on	any	of	the	posted	rars	and	choose	“extract	here”	to	the	present directory,	or	any	directory	they	wish.	Before	they	do	this	however,	they will	likely	run	Quickpar	first	to	check	for	errors,	provided	YOU	have   uploaded	pars	alongside	the	rar	files	of	your	movie. Download	Winrar	at:	http:  www.rarlabs.com download.htm Quickpar	-	for	creating	par	files.	This	is	not	mandatory	for	Usenet uploads	 unless	the	newsgroup	specifically	asks	for	it…check	their	faq , but	can	be	quite	a	godsend	for	downloaders	as	often	Usenet	servers	will “hiccup”	during	the	upload	process.	Creating	parts	at	10%	redundancy	is sufficient	for	most	files. Download	Quickpar	at:	http:  www.quickpar.org.uk Download.htm Camelsystem	Powerpost	 Windows	only 	-	A	freeware	tool	used	to upload	the	rar	and	par	files	you	created.	It	is	delightfully	simple	to	use. You	will	need	your	username	and	password	combo	from	your	Usenet provider,	along	with	the	port	number	to	insert	into	the	settings	menu before	your	are	allowed	to	upload. Download	 Powerpost	 at	 http:  powerpost.camelsystem.nl e- index.phpNZB	Files	-	You	can	think	of	NZB	files	as	being	similar	to	torrent	files that	you	load	into	a	downloader	program.	Only	instead	of	using	uTorrent, you	would	import	the	file	into	something	like	Nzb-o-Matic	Plus.	The	NZB file	itself	is	the	files	you	have	selected	from	a	site	such	as	Binsearch	or NZBindex.	It	can	contain	any	number	of	pointers	to	the	files	you	want, which	may	be	in	separate	newsgroups.	Using	an	NZB	file	makes	it exponentially	easier	to	manage	the	files	you	want,	versus	those	you	don’t want.	In	the	old	days	of	Usenet,	you	had	to	use	an	archaic	program	like Agent	or	Nomad	News	to	manually	checkmark	each	rar	or	item	in separate	newsgroups	to	download	what	you	wanted.	This	process	alone could	take	an	hour	or	more	depending	on	how	many	files	you	wanted. When	NZB	files	came	along,	they	simplified	a	needlessly	cumbersome process	of	getting	what	you	wanted	from	your	favorite	newsgroups. Incomplete	Files	-	Incomplete	Usenet	files	may	look	complete	in your	newsreader,	but	upon	downloading	the	complete	set,	you	discover that	Winrar	spits	out	an	error	midway	through	extracting	the	files.	This is	usually	because	the	uploader	has	an	unstable	connection,	or	perhaps the	power	went	out	upon	uploading	his	files,	or	a	server	hiccupped during	transmission.	Usenet	servers	transfer	files	from	other	Usenet servers,	and	it	differs	somewhat	than	your	regular	run-of-the-mill internet	server.	For	this	reason,	you	should	install	the	free	Quickpar   program	to	alleviate	any	potential	headaches	this	can	cause. SFV	Files	-	SFV	files	can	be	used	to	verify	that	your	downloaded	file is	what	it	is	supposed	to	be,	and	if	any	corruption	occurred	along	the way.	It	doesn’t	repair	the	file.	That	is	what	Quickpar	does.	This	method	of repair	is	quite	different	 and	yet	more	stable 	than	what	you	might	be accustomed	to	using	BitTorrent,	where	pars	are	rarely	provided	with seeded	files.   who	doesn’t  Usenet	Reviews;	Who	sucks,	and If	you	scout	around	the	major	search	engines	and	use	search	terms like	“usenet”	“best	usenet	prices”	and	“usenet	reviews”,	you	will	literally come	across	hundreds	of	websites	all	clamoring	for	your	referral	dollars as	they	tell	you	which	Usenet	provider	is	best	and	which	ones	to	avoid. The	thing	is,	most	of	them	offer	the	exact	same	services,	and	by	and	large are	just	as	competent	as	the	next	company. They	offer	similar	services,	ease	of	use,	and	some	like	Newshosting even	offer	their	own	Usenet	browser	that	will	do	all	of	the	hard	work	for you.	Almost	all	of	them	offer	free	SSL	and	unlimited	packages	as	well. Usenet-Server	and	Astraweb	seem	to	be	the	cheapest,	though	Astraweb has	had	its	share	of	problems	regarding	incomplete	uploads	in	the	past. For	the	purposes	of	anonymity,	going	with	a	US	based	newsgroup provider	probably	isn’t	conductive	to	good	anonymity	practice.	While	it certainly	isn’t	foolproof	to	have	an	account	with	a	European	provider	if one	is	uploading	copyrighted	material	to	Usenet	 or	any	other	illegal activity ,	the	laws	in	the	US	are	more	litigious	and	draconian	than	any other	country	on	Earth	that	houses	the	server	farms	of	Usenet companies. 	The	Big	Five 	Astraweb:	Often	the	cheapest	priced	out	of	all	Usenet	providers	with unlimited	specials	at	$11,	their	past	problems	have	been	server downtime	as	well	as	incomplete	files	 as	of	2012 .	Posted	PAR	files	will certainly	make	up	the	difference…most	of	the	time.	However	on	a	dual core	fitted	pc,	quickpar	can	take	more	than	an	hour	if	a	sufficiently	large amount	of	rars	are	broken.	In	addition,	their	customer	service	is	not	as refined	as	say,	Easynews	or	Newshosting,	but	they	cannot	be	beat	for	the price	they	offer.	If	you	don’t	mind	a	few	broken	files	and	using	Quickpar   on	a	semi-weekly	basis,	and	price	is	a	concern,	Astraweb	is	the	prime choice. 	Usenet	Server:	Similar	to	Astraweb	but	more	stable	infrastructure. They	are	also	a	few	dollars	more	in	price	however	for	their	unlimited plan.	Incompletes	were	not	seen	in	over	two	years	of	using	them.	Thus, you	really	see	where	this	extra	few	dollars	per	month	went:	system retention	and	reliability. 	Newshosting:	Similar	to	Usenet-Server,	however	they	provide	a	free newsreader	that	makes	it	ridiculously	easy	to	see	which	files	are authentic	and	which	are	viruses spam	 hint:	look	at	the	file	size…if	it	is	a heinously	small	size,	it	is	probably	spam	or	malware .	The	thumbnail view	is	similar	to	what	you	would	see	with	Easynews’	web	interface	that scans	the	thumbs	of	all	the	newsgroups	you	need	to	view. 	Easynews:	One	of	the	first	companies	out	of	the	gate,	and	one	which still	does	not	have	the	unlimited	offerings	of	the	above	Usenet	providers. However,	they	are	dirt	cheap,	have	a	reliable	backbone	of	server	farms since	they	have	been	in	business	for	eons,	and	have	one	of	the	top	forums for	troubleshooting	and	tech	issues	in	the	industry.	Their	customer service	is	unrivaled	as	well.	The	only	caveat	is	that	if	you	are	a	power user	who	wants	to	download	over	a	hundred	gigabytes	worth	of	data	per month,	they	probably	should	not	be	your	first	choice.	They	are,	like Giganews,	extremely	strict	with	takedown	notices	from	lawyers.	If	HBO specials	and	documentaries	are	your	cup	of	tea,	be	aware	that	they	have the	ability	to	“nuke”	uploads	should	they	deem	it	too	“hot”	to	reside	on their	servers	 i.e.	Game	of	Thrones,	The	Sopranos,	etc  Giganews:	Undoubtedly	the	most	expensive	of	all	the	Usenet premium	providers.	They	provide	one	of	the	largest	server	backbones, and	provide	similar	services	as	the	above	mentioned	providers.	They	are considered	the	“Harvard”	of	Usenet	companies,	however	it	seems	rather needless	to	pay	for	the	name	since	you	get	most	of	the	benefits	from	the other	big	four	Usenet	companies.	Giganews	is	also	known	for	giving	in	to “take	down”	requests	for	uploaders	of	copyrighted	content,	such	as	HBO series	like	Game	of	Thrones,	in	which	files	were	purged	from	the	servers   in	such	a	large	quantity	as	to	make	pars	useless	to	recover	them.	The problem	therein,	is	that	many	smaller	Usenet	companies	use	Giganews backend	servers	for	access	to	Usenet.	Thus,	when	they	do	comply	with	a take	down	order	or	request	from	some	Hollywood	law	firm,	other	Usenet providers	are	affected.	If	money	is	not	an	issue,	Giganews	is	a	great choice	for	their	consistently	good	customer	service. 	Others:	Thundernews,	Newsdemon,	Ngroups,	 etc.	The	list	goes	on and	on.You’re	taking	a	spin	on	the	roulette	wheel	with	anyone	not	in	the top	five.	That	is	not	to	say	they	all	provide	bad	service,	but	it	is	important to	note	that	a	rock-solid	business	like	those	in	the	top	five	take	years	and years	of	backbreaking	work	and	perseverance. The	lesser	known	Usenet	providers	usually	are	lacking	one	of	three key	areas:	customer	service	 usually	emails	from	tech	support , reliability completion	of	files,	or	retention	 age	of	files .	Some	of	them are	so	newly	minted	that	they	have	no	choice	but	to	rent	part	of	their infrastructure	from	the	likes	of	Giganews	or	Highwinds,	which	have many,	many	server	farms. In	the	end	you	might	ask,	what	is	the	number	one	thing	that customers	want	from	a	Usenet	provider?	It	is	not	retention.	Most	Usenet companies	have	similar	retention	rates	that	span	many	years.	It	is	not even	completion	of	files.	Most	large	uploads	from	users	around	the	world upload	a	sufficient	number	of	pars	to	repair	any	large	group	of	posted files	such	as	Blu-Ray	movies	or	the	like.	No,	what	Usenet	customers	most want	is	GOOD	CUSTOMER	SERVICE. Customers	don’t	want	to	sit	waiting	on	the	phone	up	to	an	hour	for tech	support	to	answer.	To	wit,	they	want	someone	who	speaks	the	same language	and	in	the	same	dialect.	They	also	don’t	want	to	be	spammed with	upselling	offers	by	the	Usenet	company	in	question	 web	hosting companies	like	Godaddy	are	notorious	for	this ,	nor	do	they	like	to	be called	on	the	phone	with	such	offers. 	The	First	Rule	of	Usenet	 don’t	talk	about	Usenet! 	On	many	social media	sites	and	forums	such	as	Facebook,	Twitter	and	Reddit,	some users	will	post	advertisements	from	the	late	nineties	from	such	big	box   stores	as	BestBuy,	Wal-Mart,	Sears	and	the	like	that	show	a	dramatic difference	in	regards	to	hardware	costs.	For	example,	a	1.5	gigabyte	hard drive	from	BestBuy	in	2000	cost	over	$200	dollars.	Now	however,	for	the same	amount	of	dollars	you	can	buy	a	3	terabyte	drive.	It	is	not	that different	for	Usenet	server	farms.	As	time	goes	by	and	more	customers sign	on	for	premium	Usenet	accounts,	the	business	costs	incurred	for Usenet	companies	goes	down.	That	is	why	you	can	have	an	unlimited data	account	for	less	than	ten	dollars	a	month.	So	then,	why	is	traditional file-sharing	such	as	torrenting	more	popular? The	reason	is	because	it	is	eminently	easier	to	download	a	torrent for	free	than	it	is	to	fish	out	your	credit	card	and	set	up	a	Usenet	account. Ridiculous,	is	it	not?	It	is	also	easier	to	see	comments	on	a	torrent	site than	read	and	filter	through	all	the	spam	in	a	Usenet	newsgroup	such	as alt.binaries.boneless.	Some	interfaces,	such	as	Newshosting’s	newsgroup browser	will	filter	out	most	of	the	spam	and	passworded	files	and	make it	easier	to	use. It	is	a	well-known	fact	by	most	BitTorrent	users	that	the	Record	and Movie	industries	like	to	unleash	their	armies	of	lawyers	upon	copyright works	that	have	seeds	numbered	in	the	millions.	This	makes	it	very convincing	in	a	lawsuit	as	far	as	who	you	uploaded	files	with	and	to whom	you	didn’t.	Often,	a	movie	release	for	September	might	be	leaked in	August,	and	the	swarm	of	users	will	catch	the	attention	of	the copyright	holders	and	sue	the	downloaders	as	well	as	uploaders provided	their	true	ip	address	is	showing. This	is	less	the	case	with	Usenet,	where	it	is	not	possible	to	see	who downloaded	which	file,	even	in	casting	a	wide	net.	Thus,	if	you	live	in	a litigious	society	like	that	in	the	United	States,	it	is	to	your	benefit	to	learn to	utilize	Usenet’s	strengths	in	this	regard. On	many	forums	you	will	hear	users	say	“Usenet	is	dead”	or	“Usenet doesn’t	have	what	torrents	have”.	Take	confidence	in	the	fact	that	people who	espouse	such	nonsense	don’t	in	fact	use	Usenet	themselves.	It	is	not beyond	the	realm	of	impossibility	that	such	naysayers	are	actually attorneys,	or	employee	shills	for	the	record	industry	who	don’t	want legions	 of	 potential	 Usenet	 experts	 asking	 too	 many	 questions concerning	what	it	has	to	offer.   Usenet	Anonymity  In	this	chapter,	we’ll	discuss	ways	you	can	add	anonymity	to	your Usenet	connection,	so	that	you	can	participate	in	discussion	groups without	fear	of	persecution.	These	methods	often	are	most	useful	in situations	where	you	may	lose	your	Usenet	account	if	you	say	the	wrong things	to	the	wrong	people.	Usenet	companies	are	big	business	now,	and unlike	twelve	years	ago,	will	now	think	nothing	of	terminating	your account	of	they	get	enough	complaints.	Simply	being	unpopular	and taking	a	stand	against	the	status	quo	in	certain	newsgroups	can	get	your Usenet	account	banned	 i.e.	alt.privacy . However,	with	true	anonymity,	they	may	ban	your	account,	but	rest assured	that	not	only	will	your	words	remain	forever	on	Usenet,	but	you will	not	be	persecuted	for	speaking	out	against	a	tyrannical	government, or	a	company	that	you	work	for	 which	has	happened	many	times	by disgruntled	employees	on	Facebook . It	should	be	stated	at	the	outset	that	using	Tor	for	Usenet	binary downloads	will	actually	strain	the	Tor	network,	just	as	it	does	with torrents.	And	to	boot,	whenever	you	use	torrents	via	Tor,	the	torrent software	actually	sends	your	IP	address	to	the	recipient.	It	does	so anonymously,	in	the	same	way	a	post	office	worker	will	deliver	you	your mail.	Needless	to	say	this	defeats	the	purpose	of	using	torrents.	This problem	is	not	with	the	Tor	code,	but	rather	the	way	that	applications like	BitLord	and	BitTorrent	are	designed.	The	torrent	applications themselves	need	to	be	coded	to	allow	anonymity.	It	is	better	to	use Freenet	with	the	Frost	addon	for	p2p-like	trading	if	you	wish	to	remain anonymous. Tor	is	much	more	efficient	at	textual	discussions	and	binary downloaders	using	your	native	connection,	but	the	easiest	method	to	do this	anonymously	is	by	use	of	the	remailer	network.	By	using	such	a method,	the	identifying	Usenet	posts	are	stripped	away	from	your messages,	essentially	erasing	the	digital	trail	that	leads	back	to	your	IP address.   As	we	have	seen	from	past	media	reports	around	the	world	over	the last	several	years,	there	could	be	any	number	of	valid	reasons	you	want to	hide	your	identity. -	Maybe	you	work	for	a	computer	manufacturer,	or	perhaps	a robotics	company	and	are	concerned	about	the	lack	of	safety	measures being	enforced	by	your	superiors,	but	fear	some	kind	of	retaliation	by them	should	you	go	public,	like	the	loss	of	your	job.	Usenet	is	a	great place	to	ask	advice	and	not	worry	about	the	consequences.	Places	like Facebook	and	Twitter	on	the	other	hand	might	invite	retribution	by	the executives	or	CEO	of	your	company. -	It	could	be	that	you	want	to	vocally	protest	your	discontent	with the	direction	of	the	prevailing	winds	of	government.	Doing	so	in countries	like	the	US,	Iran,	China,	and	the	like	could	put	you	on	a	“watch” list	of	sorts,	and	before	you	know	it,	you	have	problems	relating	to	“no fly”	lists	at	airports	and	border	stations. -	Perhaps	you	want	to	establish	a	free	email	address	that	has	never had	any	contact	whatsoever	with	your	real	IP	address.	Services	like Yahoo	Mail,	Gmail,	and	Hotmail	repeatedly	scan	emails	looking	for keywords	or	files	in	which	to	flag.	Shutting	down	your	email	is	one	thing. Having	your	IP	address	along	with	the	email	forwarded	to	government entities	for	prosecution	is	quite	another.	Anonymity	prevents	this	from happening. 	Remailers As	a	crude	example,	let’s	say	you	own	a	reporting	agency	that	is active	in	most	of	the	less-than-savory	newsgroups,	and	you	use	your email	from	your	office	quite	regularly.	Then	you	see	a	rape	victim	who needs	your	assistance.	You	might	not	want	to	divulge	your	email	address identifying to	 everyone.	 Using	 a	 remailer	 will	 ensure	 that	 any	 information	of	you	will	be	erased	from	the	headers	of	any	messages	you upload	to	newsgroups.	Your	message	will	be	forwarded	to	the	recipient without	any	risks	of	public	disclosure. 	Traceable	vs.	Untraceable	Remailers Traceable:	there	are	some	types	of	remailers	that	keep	active	lists	of senders pseudonyms	whereby	receivers	can	reply	to	mail	by	fictitious   names.	When	the	remailer	gets	a	message,	it	consults	a	list	and	forwards mail	to	the	sender.	Thus,	there	is	an	element	of	privacy	to	this	method	of communication;	however	as	was	proved	in	previous	years	by	the	penet.fi  Finland 	incident,	this	does	not	provide	anonymity.	Any	hacker, government	agency,	judge,	or	the	like	can	gain	access	to	said	list	and discover	who	the	sender	is.	In	the	case	of	penet.fi,	Scientology	launched	a lawsuit	of	copyright	infringement	against	them,	in	which	a	lower	court demanded	they	turn	over	the	identity	of	its	users. Untraceable:	If	no	list	is	maintained	on	the	pseudonyms	of	users, then	security	is	increased	exponentially…provided	you	are	willing	to	give up	two	way	communications	with	your	party.	Needless	to	say,	this	has some	drawbacks,	and	is	in	some	ways	inferior	to	using	Tor	and or	PGP to	communicate.	In	addition,	there	is	always	the	possibility	of	hacker attacks	whereby	once	entry	is	gained	upon	the	server,	anonymity	is compromised.	Traffic-sniffers	along	with	a	host	of	other	tools	can	also	be used	as	a	method	of	attack,	as	they	compare	and	contrast	the	traffic emanating	from	the	server. Such	attacks	are	very	difficult	to	coordinate,	but	are	somewhat analogous	to	attacks	within	Tor	and	also	Freenet,	whereby	if	a sufficiently	high	number	of	hostile	nodes	are	controlled	within	the network,	then	probability	of	stripping	away	layers	of	anonymity becomes	more	likely.	In	other	words,	if	Law	Enforcement	for	instance, controls	all	Tor	relays,	the	long-term	effect	would	be	similar	if	they	had control	of	most	nodes	on	Freenet.	Though	they	are	admittedly	vastly different	technologies,	they	do	share	one	common	goal:	hiding	the	true	IP address	of	senders	and	recipients. Mixmaster	techniques	however	attempt	to	thwart	such	subversive attempts	by	sending	messages	through	several	servers	across	the	globe, in	various	countries	of	legality	and	law	enforcement	jurisdictions.	It becomes	exponentially	difficult	for	hackers	and or	government	entities to	bunny	hop	from	server-to-server	across	the	globe	in	order	to	track down	where	the	original	sender	resided.	Thus,	it	goes	well	above	and beyond	the	phrase	“don’t	put	all	your	eggs	in	one	basket”	and	is	more akin	to	“many	eggs,	many	baskets”.

This	of	course doesn’t	occur	if	you	use	a	service	that	strips	away	this	information. 	4. 	Signing	up	for	a	Usenet	or	VPN	service	using	credit	cards 	Realize	that	when	you	use	your	credit	card	to	purchase	anything	like a	vpn	 virtual	private	network 	or	Usenet	account,	you	are	in	fact	leaving a	money	trail	straight	to	your	identity.	If	you	are	only	after	a	small measure	of	privacy,	such	as	wanting	a	Usenet	account	that	doesn’t monitor log	your	downloads,	then	a	vpn	is	fine.	However	if	it	is anonymity	you	want,	you	will	have	to	sign	up	for	both	Usenet	as	well	as the	vpn	service	using	anonymous	means,	either	by	bitcoins,	money order,	or	a	prepaid	debit	card	with	no	identifying	information	leading back	to	you.   Truecrypt,	Usenet,	&	Passwords In	all	of	this	talk	of	posting	rars,	pars	and	messages	out	in	the	open newsgroups,	it	would	be	a	shame	not	to	mention	that	you	can	also upload	locked	containers	and	encrypted	volumes	to	Usenet	as	well.	The main	difference	is	that	you	have	to	have	the	Truecrypt	 free 	application installed,	and	create	an	encrypted	container	with	messages	or	data therein	before	uploading	it	to	a	Usenet	newsgroup.	There	are	lots	of different	newsgroups	that	allow	this	and	many	that	don’t.	However	you can	use	alt.binaries.test	as	a	means	to	communicate	covertly	with another,	or	share	files	privately	with	another	person.	The	encryption	is actually	fairly	straightforward. When	you	create	the	Truecrypt	container	with	the	data	you	want	to send	to	someone	else,	you	could	then	rar	that	one	file	 or	files 	and upload	that.	Then	the	only	ones	who	would	be	privy	to	its	contents	are those	with	the	keyfile,	which	you	could	email	to	them,	and or	the password	to	the	container. The	benefit	of	implementing	Tor	 for	text	groups,	not	binaries , Usenet	and	Truecrypt	simultaneously	is	that	you	get	the	best	of	both worlds.	You	get	the	privacy	that	a	vpn	will	allow,	in	addition	to	having the	anonymity	 different	than	privacy 	of	Truecrypt. Always	check	the	newsgroup’s	FAQ	first	before	passwording	files	as many	groups	do	not	allow	it.	What	is	the	worse	that	can	happen?	Your Usenet	provider	will	be	inundated	with	complaints	and	they	will	revoke your	posting	privileges,	which	can	be	quite	a	cumbersome	ordeal regardless	of	whether	you	have	signed	up	anonymously	or	not.	If	in doubt,	ask	the	group,	or	post	the	word	“passworded”	or	“pw”	in	the subject	line.	Groups	like	alt.binaries.hdtv,	which	are	flooded	with passworded	blu-ray	files,	will	thank	you	for	it. There	is	nothing	quite	infuriating	as	downloading	a	50	gigabyte	Blu- Ray	disc	and	finding	out	that	it	won’t	extract	the	files	because	of	a password	requirement.	This	is	in	addition	to	not	having	a	membership	to the	forum	where	such	a	password	was	revealed	in	the	first	place.   	Running	Usenet	from	a	mounted	Truecrypt	image 	Optionally,	you	could	create	an	encrypted	volume,	install	your Usenet	newsreader	into	that	container,	and	only	run	your	newsreader upon	the	mounting	of	said	container.	Just	be	aware	that	some applications	like	to	leave	temp	files	in	the	system	drive	 C: ,	but	most should	have	an	option	to	set	such	a	directory	 i.e.	set	it	within	the encrypted	container	itself .	You	will	have	to	mount	it	to	the	same	letter directory	each	time	if	you	don’t	want	to	change	it	every	session,	however it	makes	it	very	handy	to	secure	communications	privately	between	you and	someone	else	without	the	entire	newsgroup	seeing	what	you	are saying	or	trading. There	may	be	an	instance	where	you	spent	a	lot	of	money	on	a	rare, vintage	recording	of	an	obscure	album,	and	you	don’t	want	anyone	else in	the	mp3	group	trying	to	make	money	off	it	on	eBay.	Solution?	Use Truecrypt	to	encrypt	the	mp3s.	Rar	them	up	with	a	password	and	upload to	a	newsgroup	on	Usenet. If	you	are	in	a	country	that	makes	it	difficult	to	engage	in	free discussion	online,	such	as	Iran,	China	and	the	like,	make	sure	that	you	do images	 running	 with	 your	 Usenet leave	 your	 encrypted	 not	 newsreader browser.	Doing	so	leaves	all	the	data	open	to	any	kind	of government	entity	that	decides	to	raid	your	place	of	residence.	Thus,	if you	are	a	regular	poster	in	the	group	“alt.discussion.tibetan-freedom”	it would	be	wise	to	not	leave	your	PC	running	unattended	at	all,	especially with	a	Truecrypt	image	mounted	and	in	operation.   PGP You	can	also	use	PGP	to	encrypt	messages	to	newsgroup	as	well. PGP	is	a	free	encryption	application	similar	 however	more	complex 	to Truecrypt.	You	can	encrypt	messages	from	one	newsgroup	to	another,	to any	recipient	you	like,	and	they	can	in	turn	decrypt	your	message.	It	is more	 efficient	 to	 use	 PGP	 for	 the	 purposes	 of	 covert	 Usenet communication	than	it	is	to	use	Truecrypt,	as	the	applications	are	meant for	different	security	scenarios.	It	should	be	said	that	the	pgp	manual	is not	an	easy	read.	It	will	take	you	some	measure	of	effort	to	get	your	head around	encrypting decrypting	messages	from	Usenet,	as	it	is	not	as straightforward	and	newbie-friendly	as	say,	Truecrypt.	It	is	worth	your time	in	learning	however	if	you	want	to	exchange	encrypted	messages with	other	PGP	members	on	Usenet. 	PGP-related	newsgroups: alt.security.pgp 	comp.security.pgp.announce 	comp.security.pgp.discuss 	comp.security.pgp.resources 	comp.security.pgp.tech Technical	 Sources	 on	 Cryptography,	 Security	 &	 Encryption www.iacr.org	-	Intern.

Newsgroups	that	employ the	use	of	a	moderator	can	have	stark	advantages	over	unmoderated groups,	so	much	so	that	the	group	attracts	far	more	attention	from	new users	than	it	would	without	such	moderation.	The	most	glaring	problems with	a	totally	unmoderated	setting	can	be	seen	quite	clearly	within discussion	groups	on	Freenet,	where	moderation	is	not	possible. Individual	users	can	opt	to	“ignore”	all	posts	from	certain	users	on	their own,	or	create	their	own	Frost	discussion	group	with	a	private encryption	key	 that	is,	unless	said	key	is	leaked,	in	which	the	spammers engage	in	a	full	frontal	assault	on	the	group . On	Freenet,	spam,	personal	attacks,	racism	and	hatred	abound, however	the	responsibility	is	placed	upon	the	individual	to	self- censor delete	posts	within	the	group.	On	Usenet,	even	moderators	have been	unsuccessful	at	completely	eradicating	spam	and	personal	flame wars	between	members. That	is	not	to	suggest	that	a	moderator	is	the	equivalent	of	a	Big Brother-like	censor,	however	it	makes	discussion	in	the	newsgroup	more honest	and	less	prone	to	those	who	like	to	derail	threads	into	off-topic discussions.	An	inherent	downside	to	being	a	regular	on	a	heavily moderated	Usenet	newsgroup	is	that	tolerance	becomes	difficult	to maintain.After	years	and	years	of	engaging	in	civil	discourse	in	various groups,	a	user	might	find	it	a	bit	of	a	challenge	to	participate	in	a	group that	offers	a	more	relaxed	discussion	topic	structure.	In	one	of	the	mp3 newsgroups	 electronic ,	untold	numbers	of	flame	wars	have	erupted over	the	years	concerning	new	users	 as	well	as	old 	who	would	post collections	of	ambient new-age	artists. Now,	there	are	other	mp3	groups	better	suited	for	collections	by,	for   instance,	Michael	Stearns.	Few	electronic	music	fans	would	find	him suited	for	the	electronic	mp3	newsgroup,	however	every	now	and	then	a new	Usenet	user	would	show	up	and	mistakenly	post	to	the	group	his latest	offering.	He	would	be	summarily	crucified	with	curses,	flames	and threats	to	inform	his	Usenet	provider	that	he	was	spamming	the	group. This	type	of	intolerable	attitude	does	more	harm	than	good.	There was	also	many	uploads	done	of	artist	Steve	Roach,	whose	music transcends	several	different	genres:	new-age,	ambient,	trance	and electronic,	yet	the	uploader	of	said	music	was	similarly	cursed	and vehemently	badgered	by	long-term	users.   anonymity?  Which	VPN	companies	respect If	you	are	a	bit	squeamish	about	accessing	Usenet	via	your	local	ISP, you	can	always	add	an	extra	layer	of	privacy	by	subscribing	to	a	vpn  virtual	private	network 	service	close	to	you.	There	are	a	plethora	of good	vpn	providers	that	will	route	your	internet	connection	through them	and	provide	ssl	 secure	socket	layer 	encryption	so	that	your	isp cannot	see	what	you	do	online.	Most	all	of	them	use	similar	technology	to achieve	this,	and	have	comparable	speeds.	A	vpn	service	is	much,	much faster	than	using	an	onion-routing	network	like	Tor,	but	not	all	of	them will	tolerate	p2p	usage.	However,	they	will	tolerate	a	Usenet	account. Unlike	Tor,	the	vpn	provider,	which	usually	charges	somewhere	in the	range	of	ten	dollars	per	month	for	unlimited	service	 over	and	above what	you	pay	your	Usenet	provider ,	WILL	be	able	to	see	everything	that you	do	through	their	connection,	unless	you	route	that	connection through	the	Tor	network.	They	are	more	tolerable	to	Usenet	than	they are	P2P	systems,	as	Usenet	is	less	likely	to	incur	a	swarm	of	copyright lawyers	sending	them	angry	cease-and-desist	letters. Bottom	line:	some	vpns	will	log	your	IP	and	some	won’t.	If	they know	your	real	name	and	address,	you	can	be	sure	that	law	enforcement will	 and	any	other	type	of	law	agency 	with	a	subpoena.	Sometimes	not even	that.	It’s	a	hit	and	miss	game,	and	one	which	seems	entirely dependent	on	whether	the	provider	keeps	online	logs	of	the	traffic	that goes	through	their	portal.	One	popular	vpn	provider,	BlackVPN,	said	this in	their	FAQ:  “Although	 we	 do	 not	 monitor	 the	 traffic,	 incoming	 or	 outgoing connections	of	our	users	we	may	assign	users	to	a	unique	IP	address	and log	which	user	was	assigned	which	IP	address	at	a	given	time.	If	we	receive a	copyright	violation	notice	from	the	appropriate	copyright	holder	then	we will	forward	the	violation	to	the	offending	user	and	may	terminate	their account.	We	therefore	ask	our	users	not	to	distribute	or	transmit	material   which	violates	the	copyright	laws	in	either	your	country	or	the	country	in which	our	Service	is	hosted.”  	The	above	defeats	the	entire	purpose	of	anonymity	on	the	internet. A	novice	who	didn’t	know	the	difference	between	privacy	and	anonymity might	conclude	from	their	website	that	they	offered	complete	anonymity similar	to	what	Tor	offers,	but	that	is	clearly	not	the	case	at	all.	One	has to	be	quite	attentive	to	the	fine	details	of	the	advertising	on	sites	such	as theirs	to	see	if	any	logs	are	kept,	and	in	many	cases	they	will	not	reveal such	information	unless	you	explicitly	email	them	and	ask.	Interestingly, in	2011	the	website	TorrentFreak	initiated	a	rather	close	examination	of all	of	the	vpn	provider’s	response	to	the	question	“Under	what jurisdictions	does	your	company	operate	and	under	what	exact circumstances	will	you	share	the	information	you	hold	with	a	3rd	party?” Some	of	the	answers	were	expectantly	evasive,	and	others	were quite	illuminating.	One	provider,	CryptCloud,	said “We	don’t	log	anything	on	the	customer	usage	side	so	there	are	no dots	to	connect	period,	we	completely	separate	the	payment	information. Realistically,	unless	you	operate	out	of	one	of	the	‘Axis	of	Evil	Countries” Law	Enforcement	will	find	a	way	to	put	the	screws	to	you.	I	have	read	the in	 Europe	 will	 protect	 you	 from	 US	 Law nonsense	 that	 being	 Enforcement,	worked	well	for	HMA	didn’t	it?	Furthermore	I	am	pretty sure	the	Swiss	Banking	veil	was	penetrated	and	historically	that	is	more defend-able	than	individual	privacy.	The	way	to	solve	this	is	just	not	to log,	period.” 	Two	points	to	make.	One,	the	HMA	 Hide	My	Ass	vpn 	incident	he refers	to	involved	a	member	of	the	hacker	group	Lulzsec,	in	which	one	of their	core	members	was	arrested.	Two,	he	cites	the	“Axis	of	Evil”,	but clearly	they	are	not	in	one	of	those	countries. The	above	is	not	to	suggest	that	their	actual	service	is	less	than	that which	they	advertise,	but	the	distinction	between	privacy	and	anonymity often	falls	victim	to	the	gnomes	who	work	in	the	marketing	department of	said	companies.	CryptoCloud	is	located	in…San	Antonio,	Texas,	which has	one	of	the	most	brutally	unmerciful	judiciary	systems	in	the	United States.	If	a	federal	judge	 or	Congress 	wanted	the	identity	of	one	of	their   customers,	you	can	be	sure	that	such	information	would	be	handed	over in	a	heartbeat	in	order	to	avoid	heavy	day-to-day	fines.	If	they	are	based in	the	US,	they	would	 have	to	have	your	personal	identity	information available	in	order	to	avoid	bankruptcy	by	the	federal	government.	To	wit, this	doesn’t	necessarily	have	to	have	anything	to	do	with	terrorism,	cp, spam	or	counterfeiting.	It	could	be	as	simple	as	running	a	file	sharing server.	The	case	involving	Megaupload	proves	that	true	anonymity,	at least	that	which	is	beyond	the	long	arm	of	the	law,	is	difficult	to	obtain, even	if	you	reside	in	another	country.	Still,	it	is	worth	having	a	vpn account	simply	because	it	adds	an	extra	layer	of	privacy	to	your	sessions. If	you	are	a	habitual	uploader,	you	could	do	a	lot	worse	than	to	pay	ten dollars	a	month	for	an	extra	peace	of	mind. The	solution?	Sign	up	to	a	vpn	provider	anonymously.	There	are several	providers	who	accept	Bitcoins	as	payment. http:  www.thebitcoinlist.com dp_internet vps-vpn    The	Cloud	 the	Enemy	of Anonymity  It	goes	without	saying	that	men	are	voracious	collectors	of	many things	obtained	online:	mp3	collections,	digital	wallpaper,	pdf	files	and the	like.	The	term	“cloud”	has	been	given	flighty	and	unwieldy	definitions from	one	blogger	to	the	next,	as	if	the	“cloud”	is	actually	some impenetrable	fortress	in	the	digital	sky	where	no	moth	or	thief	can	break in	and	corrupt	or	steal.	However	secure	you	feel	that	your	files	are	“in the	cloud”,	it	is	perhaps	worth	remembering	that	whoever	owns	the “cloud”,	owns	your	stuff.	Thus,	the	cloud	is	nothing	more	than	a	server farm	with	hundreds	of	other	people’s	hard	drives	&	servers,	all	digitally categorizing…	your	stuff. No	longer	are	your	things	flying	under	the	banner	of	privacy	in	your own	home,	but	rather	you	are	subject	to	whatever	litigious	lawyer’s terms	and	conditions	contract	he	has	drummed	up	for	the	cloud provider.	Be	wary	of	a	future	promised	where	your	data	is	at	the	whims of	some	far	away	server	operator	who	gets	to	dictate	which	of	your purchased	music,	movies	and	games	gets	“streamed”	to	your	pc. The	Windows	8	operating	system	has	a	feature	called	“SmartScreen” that	is	used	for	checking	the	validity	and	safety	of	files	before	they	are executed.	This	type	of	feature	was	first	implemented	in	Internet	Explorer and	Windows	Live	Messenger	to	thwart	malicious	sites	from	being	able to	exploit	people’s	browsers. Thus,	verification	and	authentication	were	at	the	forefront	of	the feature,	as	it	sought	to	prevent	spam,	malware	and	adware	from infecting	people’s	computers.	A	good	thing?	Not	for	the	majority	of	users, who	found	it	rather	annoying.	It	was	a	one-step-forward,	two-steps- backward	approach	that	actually	hindered	the	internet	experience	for millions	of	users	of	Internet	Explorer	as	they	attempted	to	go	to	links that	were	not	dangerous	in	the	least. Enter	Windows	8,	in	which	the	SmartScreen	feature	tries	to	verify   whether	applications	are	“safe”	to	download	or	run	on	the	operating system.	It	checks	a	dynamic,	ever-changing	laundry	list	of	exploitable URLs	that	Microsoft	has	identified	as	harmful	for	end-users	on	pc systems.	An	additional	problem	with	this	is	that	it	is	cumbersome	to	turn off,	and	once	done,	results	in	consistent	nagging	from	the	operating system	to	re-enable	it.	Where	it	will	be	three	to	five	years	down	the road?	Will	you	have	to	have	every	app	or	file	on	your	pc	“authorized”	by Microsoft’s	servers	before	you	can	execute	them?	What	about	cloud content	and	streaming	legally	purchased	items	to	your	own	pc? For	the	uninitiated,	Microsoft	likes	to	assign	“download	reputation” points	to	digitally	signed	websites	as	well	as	programs.	The	problem with	this	is	the	same	problem	that	manifests	itself	in	anti-virus programs,	namely	that	a	lot	of	false-positives	get	thrown	in	the	user’s face,	leading	to	frustration	and	annoyance.	At	times,	downloads	will	get frozen	in	Internet	Explorer	9	as	the	downloaded	files	get	scanned.	There is	no	option	in	Internet	Explorer	9	to	switch	it	off	and	let	end-users decide	what	security	setting	to	implement.	Rare	files	constantly	get falsely	flagged	as	being	somehow	malicious	for	the	pc.	There	is	a	further element	of	privacy	intrusion	for	the	SmartScreen	feature.	It	collects	data on	every	program	you	install	on	your	operating	system,	and	checks	to see	if	a	valid	certificate	exists	on	Microsoft’s	“cloud”	 i.e.	their	server  that	verifies	its	“safety”	for	your	operating	system.	It	checks	the	hash	of the	program	installer	itself,	and	compares	it	to	a	list	at	Microsoft.	Think about	how	many	programs	you	have	installed	on	your	pc	that	are	related to	privacy:	PGP,	Truecrypt,	BitLocker,	the	installer	your	vpn	provider emailed	you,	and	perhaps	even	encrypted	keyfiles	to	your	hard	drive.	It would	be	a	gold	mine	of	epic	proportions	for	any	hacker	to	get	at	such data.Enter	Usenet.	As	of	2017,	it	is	relatively	easy	to	hop	on	Usenet without	having	to	jump	through	hoops	to	do	so.	When	you	download data	from	Usenet,	it	is	typically	decoded	by	your	newsreader	or	NZB application	and	then	saved	to	your	hard	drive.	If	you	have	an	anti-virus installed,	it	most	likely	will	have	some	element	of	checking	each executable	or	installer	that	is	downloaded	to	your	pc,	either	by	Usenet	or some	other	variant	of	internet	app.	With	the	rush	to	maximize	the	use	of cloud	computing,	however,	the	responsibility	of	initializing	these	types	of   security	settings	is	slowly	being	taken	away	from	the	end-user.	What does	this	mean	for	Usenet?	One	of	two	things	could	happen. 1. 	Eventually,	users	stream	data	off	of	usenet,	which	is	then checked	and	“verified”	through	an	intermediary	cloud	server,	before being	delivered	to	your	hard	drive	 assuming	you	have	one . 2. 	Usenet	SSL	will	be	prohibitively	expensive	and or	reserved	only for	certain	groups	in	society	 think	Government,	Intelligence,	etc . Secure,	anonymous	programs	like	PGP,	Freenet,	Truecrypt	and	the	like will	be	stigmatized	and	shunned	by	cloud	servers	for	their	inability	to unmask	and	decrypt	their	true	contents. In	2010,	an	article	titled	“The	Death	of	the	Hard	Drive”	explored Google’s	persistent	momentum	towards	a	hard-drive-less	selection	of flagship	products,	all	citing	the	benefits	of	“cloud	storage”.	In	2012, Microsoft	is	gearing	Windows	8	towards	such	a	platter-less	scenario.  “Stop	worrying	about	when	the	hard	drive	in	your	computer	will	die.  Google	wants	to	kill	it	permanently	anyway.  The	 new	 Google	 Chrome	 operating	 system,	 which	 was	 unveiled Tuesday,	as	well	as	hints	and	suggestions	from	Apple	and	Microsoft,	offers us	a	preview	of	the	PC	of	the	future.	And	it	will	come	without	that	familiar whirring	disk	that	has	been	the	data	heart	of	the	PC	for	the	past	25	years.  The	 Chrome	 OS	 will	 at	 first	 be	 available	 on	 all-black	 laptops	 from Samsung	 and	 Acer.	 And	 because	 the	 new	 platform	 stores	 everything	 — files,	 applications,	 data	 bits	 and	 bytes,	 literally	 everything	 —	 on	 online servers	rather	than	on	your	home	or	office	PC,	those	new	PCs	running	it won’t	require	gobs	of	storage.	In	fact,	they	won’t	require	any	storage	at	all. “  Further	reasons	why	you	should	never	rely	on	the	Cloud	for	your personal	data	backups. 1. 	You	are	completely	at	the	mercy	of	your	ISP’s	bandwidth	cap. They	stand	to	make	a	fortune	as	you	stream	your	own	personal	mp3s, games,	video	 which	competes	with	their	own	brand 	and	the	like	to your	personal	devices.	No	hard	drive	means	you’ll	be	streaming	quite regularly.	Bandwidth	caps	will	necessarily	cause	you	to	pay	more	for products	that	you	have	paid	in	full.	Thus,	true	ownership	becomes	a misnomer.	Instead,	you	will	“rent”	the	products	you	buy	from	online digital	sources.	Usenet	prices	will	go	up,	as	customers	will	not	be	able	to   afford	the	massive	price	spikes	in	bandwidth	costs.	One	of	the	hallmarks of	Usenet	premium	providers	is	the	“unlimited”	package.	However	what good	is	“unlimited”	when	your	ISP	caps	your	connection?	Many	ISPs  especially	those	in	Canada,	such	as	Bell	Sympatico 	falsely	advertise such	unlimited	options	and	speeds. 2. 	US	jurisdiction.	Most	of	the	server	backbones	related	to	cloud computing	reside	in	the	heart	of	the	USA.	That	means	your	private	data, while	in	the	“cloud”,	is	subject	to	laws	dictated	by	the	US	Congress	and US	Legislature.	What	is	quasi-legal	in	your	own	country	in	the	Ukraine,	or Timbuktu,	might	be	dastardly	illegal	in	the	United	States.	Some government	entities	might	insist	that	sites	like	Amazon	not	only	cancel your	account	and	delete	your	purchased	files	on	their	servers,	but	relay all	personal	subscriber	information	to	them	for	proceedings	in	an American	court.	It	has	happened	before.	There	is	also	the	opportunity	for said	government	agencies	 or	hackers 	to	intercept	your	data	streaming down	to	you	to	verify	its	authenticity.	For	your	own	good,	naturally. Google	and	Microsoft	know	what	is	best	for	you,	right? 3. 	Encryption	is	allergic	to	Cloud	Computing.	You	can	bet	the	ranch that	almost	every	Cloud	Computing	server	operator	will	demand	to	see what	is	inside	encrypted	files	in	order	to	minimize	the	risk	of	being	fined by	the	FCC	or	investigated	by	other	alphabet	agencies	like	the	IRS  taxes ,	and	FBI	 fraud copyright .	This	is	not	necessarily	the	case	today, in	2012,	but	you	can	be	sure	that	if	everyone	has	absolutely	no	choice	but to	upload	their	digital	purchases	to	their	servers,	they	will	want	to	see the	contents	of	everything	since	it	resides	on	“their”	server	cloud.	Google, Microsoft	and	Yahoo	repeatedly	scan	personal	emails	in	an	attempt	to better	target	their	user’s	browsing	habits	with	targeted	ads.	It	would	be no	different	for	mp3s,	videos	or	love	letters	contained	in	encrypted Truecrypt	volumes. 4. 	It	cheapens	individuality.	The	collective	groupthink	that	is inherent	in	the	pursuit	to	herd	all	the	digital	sheep	into	one	pen	is	the anti-thesis	of	not	only	privacy	and	human	rights	on	an	individual	level,	it makes	everyone	dependent	on	a	single	system.	In	August	2012,	Steve Wozniak,	co-founder	of	Apple	said	at	a	Washington	expose	said:	“I	really  worry	 about	 everything	 going	 to	 the	 cloud.	 I	 think	 it’s	 going	 to	 be horrendous.	I	think	there	are	going	to	be	a	lot	of	horrible	problems	in	the   next	five	years.	With	the	cloud,	you	don’t	own	anything.	You	already	signed it	away.	I	want	to	feel	that	I	own	things.	A	lot	of	people	feel,	‘Oh,	everything is	really	on	my	computer,’	but	I	say:	the	more	we	transfer	everything	onto the	web,	onto	the	cloud,	the	less	we’re	going	to	have	control	over	it.”  And	Steve	would	be	correct.	If	Cloud	computing	takes	off	the	way Google	and	Microsoft	wants,	you	will	find	someone	else	in	some	other state,	province,	or	country	setting	the	times	when	you	are	allowed	to access	your	own	data,	encrypted	or	not. 5. 	George	Orwell’s	1984.	Maybe	it	will	never	quite	happen	as	it	is alluded	to	in	the	book.	Then	again,	no	one	could	fathom	that	a	Category	5 hurricane	would	wipe	out	New	Orleans,	or	that	3000	people	would	die	at the	hands	of	19	mangy	terrorists	on	Sept.	11th,	2001.	For	several	years now,	the	US	has	expressed	the	desire	for	an	internet	“kill	switch”	to	deal with	the	less	than	desirable	in	our	society.	Today,	it	is	terrorists, spammers	and	identity	thieves.	Tomorrow,	it	is	people	who	obviously have	something	to	hide	if	they	implement	SSL	in	their	Usenet	setups	and upload	Truecrypt	volumes	“to	the	cloud”.	It	is	this	kind	of	slow	erosion	of private	property	that	forced	the	hand	of	Revolution	in	the	17th	and	18th centuries. 	The	above	reasons	are	sufficient	to	put	a	shred	of	doubt	insofar	as Usenet	usage	is	concerned.	Usenet	users	rely	on	their	physical	hard drives	for	storage	of	their	data	acquired	from	Usenet,	and	regardless	of what	that	data	is,	it	would	slowly	kill	the	Usenet	industry	if	users	had	to “stream”	their	files	from	their	Usenet	accounts	with	no	place	to	securely store	them.	They	also	enjoy	the	privilege	of	not	having	their	download logs	kept	by	anyone.	Such	is	certainly	not	true	of	most	torrent	trackers, where	every	seed	participating	in	the	swarm	reveals	their	ip	address	to anyone	connected,	day	or	night,	for	days	and	weeks	on	end. 	Disregard	Dictators,	Acquire	Privacy To	reverse	the	heavy	tide	against	groupthink	and	giving	up	private ownership	of	your	own	files	 on	Usenet,	or	elsewhere ,	a	stand	needs	to be	taken	now,	and	with	more	than	simply	our	wallets.	There	was	once	a time	back	in	the	1990s	where	the	purveyors	of	Usenet	did	not	have	to worry	about	their	posts	being	chiseled	in	stone	among	the	newsgroups   immediate	 data	 about	  which	would	last	for	generations.	Even	one	year	retention	for	textual newsgroups	was	not	that	common,	and	five	year	retention	for	binaries was	but	a	dream.	Many	Usenet	users	weren’t	afraid	to	use	their	real names	and	real	emails	in	messages.	At	the	time,	there	was	little	reason	to be.	Now	however,	in	addition	to	the	ever-ominous	threat	of	being	stalked  and	kidnapped killed 	Every	message	posted	to	Usenet	is	archived	by Google	 DejaNews Google	Groups 	in	the	same	way	that	they	are	taking high	resolution	photos	of	every	nook	and	cranny	upon	the	earth	via Google	Earth.	The	aim	of	this	digital	push	towards	“the	Cloud”	seems	to be	to	minimize	individuality	as	well	as	putting	an	end	to	privacy.	The technology	is	here	that	every	move	you	make	on	the	street	will	be recorded	not	by	security	cameras	sitting	atop	state	buildings	and	banks, but	by	each	other.	Google	has	not	only	recorded	every	single	message posted	to	Usenet	within	the	last	five	years,	it	wants	to	do	something eerily	similar	with	their	Project	Glass	product,	in	which	users	will	be	sold a	pair	of	glasses	with	a	built-in	webcam	that	monitors	everything	around it,	 giving	 their	 surroundings:	 buildings, restaurants,	museums	and	the	like.	Only	it	won’t	stop	there.	Eventually	it will	focus	on	people,	as	that	is	where	the	ad	revenue	streams	lie. According	to	Google: “We	think	Glass	helps	you	share	your	life	as	you’re	living	it;	from	life’s 	True	Security	lies	with	the	Individual,	not	the	State 	We	may	come	to	a	point	where	it	may	be	impossible	to	truly	harbor any	anonymity	at	all	on	Usenet	or	anywhere	else.	Users	who	don’t	have the	latest	“reality	enhancer”	 which	just	so	conveniently	carries	every data	imaginable	about	your	birth,	health,	academic	&	employment history 	would	suffer	severe	ostracization	from	peers	 i.e.	Facebook defriending,	etc 	As	anyone	with	a	RAID	hard	drive	setup	can	attest,  big	moments	to	everyday	experiences.	Today	we’re	kicking	off	what	we’re calling	Glass	Sessions,	where	you	can	experience	what	it’s	like	to	use	Glass while	we	build	it,	through	the	eyes	of	a	real	person,	in	real	life.	The	first Glass	Session	follows	Laetitia	Gayno,	the	wife	of	a	Googler,	as	she	shares her	story	of	welcoming	a	new	baby,	capturing	every	smile,	and	showing	her entire	family	back	in	France	every	“first”	through	Hangouts.”   technology	gets	smaller	with	each	generation,	and	holds	infinitely	more data	the	further	into	the	future	you	progress.	There	will	come	a	point where	you	will	not	need	to	wear	glasses	to	record	and	upload	your immediate	surroundings	to	the	internet.	All	of	the	surveillance	will inevitably	shrink	in	size	to	a	state	where	your	naked	eye	will	not	notice their	presence	at	all.	This	is	what	happened	with	Usenet.	No	one	knew back	in	the	1990s	that	everything	we	said	or	did	online	was	going	to	be archived	 archive.org 	for	anyone	to	peruse	decades	later. Thus,	we	now	censor	ourselves	on	Usenet	for	fear	of	being	reported to	whatever	authorities	can	punish	us	accordingly.	Excessive	data therefore,	is	actually	the	anti-thesis	of	freedom.	Usenet	SSL,	VPNs,	&	Tor all	provide	a	power	to	the	end	user	that	is	slowly	being	shunned	and minimized	by	those	with	the	power	to	do	so	 i.e.	Google,	Facebook, .	It	is certainly	not	100%	integrated	into	society	yet,	but	it	is	coming.	To	foster more	privacy	on	Usenet,	we	need	more	anonymity.	People	need	to	be free	to	speak	their	minds	and	engage	civil	discussion	without	worrying about	the	powers	that	be	 Google 	pulling	the	strings	of	censorship.	We will	get	to	the	point	where	we	will	be	accused	of	“being	up	to	no	good”	by refusing	to	play	along.	Have	an	encrypted	volume	and	plan	to	cross	the border?	The	border	guard	might	ask	you	to	decrypt.	Refuse	and	they	can confiscate	your	laptop	for	five	days,	making	the	trip	fairly	aggravating. Will	it	one	day	be	considered	a	capital	crime	to	erase	some	negative thing	about	your	past	history	on	the	internet	without	some	government entity’s	stamp	of	approval?   Escape	the	West!

But	these	days	Hell	itself seems	to	have	taken	on	an	altogether	foreign	form	that	is	wholly different	than	the	medieval	version.	These	days,	many	‘angels	of	light’ profess	to	know	what’s	good	for	us	better	than	we	do	ourselves	-	which is	sheer	lunacy. We’re	not	sheep.	We	all	see	it.	We’re	not	blind.	And	some	of	us	want to	act	as	beacons	of	light	in	a	sea	of	darkness	rather	than	go	“Baaaaa!” like	sheep	to	the	bloody	slaughter.	We	want	to	lead	others	away	from	the slaughterhouse.	But	to	do	that	requires	a	specific	set	of	skills	no	college teaches.Skills	that	will	help	us	turn	back	the	tide	of	Armageddon	on individual	sovereignty.	Because	let’s	face	it,	attacks	on	privacy	have increased	a	thousand-fold.	Every	day	new	laws	are	passed	that	make privacy	as	rare	as	pink	diamonds.	In	the	future	it	just	may	come	to	be	just as	valued	as	pink	diamonds.	Do	you	want	to	hear	your	grandkids	ask	you what	it	was	like	in	the	old	days	when	people	weren’t	monitored	24 7. Right.	Didn’t	think	so. It’s	high-time	we	fought	back	and	fought	hard.	If	you’ve	ever	seen the	Shawshank	Redemption	then	you	know	what	happens	to	weaklings	- those	that	don’t	take	action.	They	get	raped	again	and	again	and	again. Sooner	or	later	you’ll	know	what	the	meaning	of	this	phrase	is:	“His judgment	cometh	and	that	right	soon”.	It	means	war.	Wouldn’t	you rather	fight	before	the	raping	and	pillaging	starts?	I	would. Judgment	Day	is	already	here.	One	cannot	walk	down	the	street without	meeting	a	dozen	street	cams,	and	as	an	American Canadian citizen	there	are	times	when	I’ve	wanted	to	disappear	from	society altogether.	Vanish	as	though	I’d	slipped	Frodo’s	elvish	cloak	over	my neck	and	smoothed	that	runic	ring	right	down	my	middle	finger	before flipping	off	the	elites	in	power.   But	first,	a	little	story. A	story	way	back	in	2001,	ancient	of	days	and	land	of	vampires	and hooded	hoodrats	wielding	double-bladed	axes. Living	in	close	proximity	to	the	housing	projects	of	New	Orleans, most	days	driving	back	from	the	University	of	New	Orleans	were uneventful.	For	the	most	part.	Only	Mardi	Gras	seemed	to	break	the monotony	along	with	eating	soggy	beignets	 powdered	donuts 	on Bourbon	Street. Except	for	one	day	in	particular	while	sweating	in	Manila-like	traffic. On	that	day	something	terrifying	happened.	I	decided	to	take	a	shortcut which	turned	out	to	be	a	shortcut	into	trouble	for	no	sooner	that	I	sped towards	home	that	a	fourteen-year-old	girl,	black	with	ripped	jeans,	red sweatshirt	and	a	nose	that	could	put	a	bloodhound	to	shame	ran	in	front of	my	beat-up	Camaro	while	I	drove	15MPH. I	slammed	on	the	brakes	and	missed	her	hip	by	an	inch.	She slammed	her	fists	on	the	hood	of	my	car.	Boom.	Then	she	flipped	me	off real	casual	like	this	sort	of	thing	happened	every	time	it	rained.	I	hopped out,	furious,	and	proceeded	to	make	sure	she	knew	how	damn	close she’d	come	to	a	date	with	the	grim	reaper. A	cacophony	of	yelling	ensued	with	every	color	of	the	rainbows.	Soft swearing,	hard	swearing,	and	sweating	 mostly	me 	as	she	matched every	curse	word	with	one	better,	more	deviant,	and	fueled	with	twice the	rage	as	though	she’d	been	bred	for	no	other	reason	than	to	unleash	it all	upon	me	on	that	fiery	summer	day.	A	vampiric	Lady	Macbeth,	this thuggette	was.	But	none	of	that	really	mattered	to	the	law.	No	sir,	what mattered	was	when	I	grabbed	her	arm	and	stabbed	a	finger	into	her	face as	I	shouted	to	be	more	careful.	I	began	to	walk	away. Only	I	wasn’t	going	anywhere. Her	brother	came	running.	A	BIG	brother	wearing	a	dozen	gold chains	and	carrying	a	chain	big	enough	to	tie	a	velociraptor.	I	swear	the guy	looked	straight	out	of	the	A-Team.	After	that,	her	mother	came screaming	and	what	I	presumed	at	the	time	was	her	grandmother, broom	in	hand	 a	witch? .	I	panicked	as	the	big	brother	threw	me	to	the ground	as	mama	called	the	cops.	I	remember	expecting	a	black	cat	to come	along	any	minute	to	scratch	my	face	to	shreds.	I	was	going	down	in flames	though	I	was	innocent	of	any	abuse.   Fast-forward	three	weeks	later	and	I’m	having	my	ass	handed	to	me by	the	most	militant	feminist	judge	I’d	ever	laid	eyes	on.	A	real	manhater whose	harpy-like	claws	seemed	to	grow	the	more	I	sweat.	I	had	only	one choice:	Play	along.	So	I	kissed	ass	like	I’d	never	in	my	whole	miserable life.	At	the	end	of	her	screeching	rant,	I	ended	up	getting	off	on	a technicality.	The	police	had	screwed	up	somewhere,	it	seemed. My	record	was	as	clean	as	a	babe’s	arse.	Clear	as	as	crystal…	or	so	I thought	until	later	that	year	a	detective	came	knocking.	It	seemed	that the	little	girl	had	disappeared	and	to	my	horror,	found	he	knew everything	about	me.	Things	that	were	not	in	the	court	transcript.	Things I’d	done	were	recorded	by	various	cameras	set	up	around	the	city.	The entire	city	seemed	to	be	turning	a	shade	Orwellian. “Talk	to	me,”	he	said	smiling	with	that	shiny	badge	gleaming.	I frowned.	Talk	to	the	cops?	“Yeah,”	he	replied.	“Talk	to	me	or	get	put	on the	sex	offender’s	list	for	abusing	that	little	girl.” Abuse? I	clammed	up.	Granted,	I	was	native,	but	not	stupid.	He	ended	up letting	me	go	after	throwing	down	every	threat	imaginable.	After	that	I wanted	to	vanish	even	more,	and	as	I	would	later	learn,	I	wasn’t	the	first to	go	through	such	an	ordeal. Up	until	that	point,	I’d	always	trusted	the	police,	or	for	that	matter any	kind	of	higher	authority	in	government.	I	trusted	the	media.	I	trusted newspapers.	I	trusted	juries.	About	the	only	thing	I	never	trusted	were the	palm	readers	who	always	set	up	shop	around	the	French	Quarter. Well,	no	longer. From	that	point	on,	I	swore	to	myself	I’d	learn	how	to	be	invisible,	or die	trying.	True,	I	escaped	the	sex	offender	registry	by	keeping	my	mouth shut.	Others	have	not	been	so	lucky.	I’ve	heard	another	author	 Wendy McElroy 	relate	a	similar	story:  “Last	summer,	an	Illinois	man	lost	an	appeal	on	his	conviction	as	a	sex offender	 for	 grabbing	 the	 arm	 of	 a	 14-year-old	 girl.	 She	 had	 stepped directly	in	front	of	his	car,	causing	him	to	swerve	in	order	to	avoid	hitting her.  The	28-year-old	Fitzroy	Barnaby	jumped	out	his	car,	grabbed	her	arm and	 lectured	 her	 on	 how	 not	 to	 get	 killed.	 Nothing	 more	 occurred. Nevertheless,	that	one	action	made	him	guilty	of	“the	unlawful	restraint	of   a	 minor,”	 which	 is	 a	 sexual	 offense	 in	 Illinois.	 Both	 the	 jury	 and	 judge believed	 him.	 Nevertheless,	 Barnaby	 went	 through	 years	 of	 legal proceedings	that	ended	with	his	name	on	a	sex	offender	registry,	where	his photograph	 and	 address	 are	 publicly	 available.	 He	 must	 report	 to authorities.	 His	 employment	 options	 are	 severely	 limited;	 he	 cannot	 live near	schools	or	parks”  Here	I	was	thinking	I	was	the	only	guy	that	had	experienced	such	a horrific	day.	The	absurd	part	is	not	even	that	it	happened.	It’s	that	it	is never	forgiven.	It’s	never	put	in	the	past	where	mistakes	are	buried.	They are	broadcasted	forever,	branded	over	and	over	into	our	memories. Forgiveness	 i.e.	granting	your	past	actions	invisible	to	everyone	but	you and	the	Almighty 	is	outlawed. Well.	This	book	aims	to	reverse	that	trend.	It	aims	to	give	you	back your	privacy	and	if	you	need	it,	invisibility. You	don’t	want	newspaper	reporters	sticking	mics	in	your	face before	you’ve	had	your	day	in	court	do	you?	That	happened	to	me.	I remember	feeling	like	I’d	killed	everyone’s	favorite	rock	star	though	I’d never	set	foot	anywhere	near	the	concert. Think	on	how	your	life	would	change	if	any	of	the	following happened	to	you: *	Someone	uses	your	unsecured	WiFi	to	threaten	the	President. *	A	hacker	steals	your	credit	card	to	purchase	Russian	child	porn using	proxies. *	You	hear	sirens	just	as	your	phone	rings.	You	pick	up	to	hear	a news	journalist	asking	for	an	interview	since	you	were	the	last	person	to see	the	Governor	alive	at	the	Beau	Chene	Golf	and	Racquet	Country	Club  who	was	later	found	dead	in	a	pool	of	blood	in	the	restroom	-	the	same you	used!  *	The	powers	that	be	are	coming	after	you	for	child	support— without	allowing	you	to	see	your	own	children.	You	try	to	visit	Canada	to “get	away	from	it	all”	for	a	while,	when	you	are	arrested	at	the	border. Things	get	worse	when	they	find	a	few	“manga”	comics	in	your	back	seat. Manga	that	is	illegal	in	Canada	but	not	the	USA.	Chaos	ensues.	They	rip your	reputation	apart	in	the	name	of	the	law. *	Your	ten	year	old	brother	jokes	to	his	pals	on	the	school	yard	that he	has	a	shed	full	of	Rambo-like	grenades	and	a	few	barrels	of   gunpowder.	A	girl	overhears.	She	snitches.	The	cops	arrest	him	 not kidding 	but	later	let	him	go.	Years	later,	that	report	shows	up	when	he tries	to	join	the	Marines.	He	is	 rejected.	Yes,	This	really	happened	to	a relative	in	Louisiana.	And	that’s	not	to	say	Louisiana	is	any	better	or worse	than	any	other	state	where	hysteria	can	run	amok	and	drag	you along	for	the	ride.	The	fact	is,	I’ll	show	you	how	to	prevent	crap	like	this from	happening	no	matter	which	country	you	are	in. If	you	are	ever	investigated,	the	authorities	will	likely	tear	your place	apart	looking	for	anything	from	which	to	build	a	solid	case	to	hand to	the	prosecutor.	Who	knows	what	your	situation	might	be	at	that	time. You	might	need	to	go	away	for	a	while	to	strategize	with	attorneys, maintain	your	business,	speak	to	family,	move	assets,	etc.	It	is	difficult	to do	that	from	a	jail	cell. The	USA	now	has	a	“guilty	until	proven	innocent”	legal	system.	You are	not	innocent,	but	I	will	teach	you	to	gain	that	precious	commodity called	TIME	which	you	can	use	to	gather	resources	to	defend	yourself. Resources	that	go	well	with	becoming	invisible. You	will	learn: 1. 	How	to	be	anonymous	offline	as	well	as	on. 2. 	How	to	use	your	surroundings	to	lessen	risk,	special	forces	style. 3. 	How	to	detect	when	you	are	being	data-mined:	How	to	hide where	you	went	to	school,	where	you’ve	lived,	whom	you’ve	loved, whom	you	did	not.	Your	shopping	habits,	dating	habits,	political affiliations.	You	get	the	picture. 4. 	How	to	look	like	a	small	fish	and	not	a	BIG	FISH. 	But	this	is	just	the	beginning.   Burn	Notice	&	Skip	Tracers Burn	Notice	is	one	of	my	favorite	TV	shows.	I	don’t	watch	much	TV but	I	do	if	that	show	is	on.	I’d	stop	to	watch	it	even	if	a	mugger	came	in and	stuck	me	in	the	ribs	before	making	off	with	my	wallet.	It’s	that	grand. It’s	thrilling.	It’s	top	notch	espionage	and	underground	battle-of-the-wits style	American	James	Bond.	Sort	of	like	True	Lies,	but	with	better	looking agents.The	‘burn	notice’	itself	usually	comes	from	an	intelligence	agency, but	can	be	from	any	alphabet	agency	really.	It	doesn’t	even	need	to	be	on paper.	You	can	get	‘The	Call’	while	on	a	mission	in	Iran	or	Brazil	or Eastern	Europe.	What	happens	is	this:	The	CIA	calls	you	up	and	at	the most	inopportune	moment	tells	you	they	wish	to	‘wash	their	hands	of you‘.You’re	done.	You’re	cooked.	You’re	career	as	an	agent	is	finished. They	cut	the	umbilical	quick	and	every	connection	to	an	agent	is severed	in	true	Mission:	Impossible	fashion.	And	all	for	what,	you	ask? Easy.	So	they	can	save	face.	Any	agent	has	no	idea	what	he	did	 well maybe	a	few	might	have	an	idea 	but	he	knows	he	has	no	work	history, no	connections,	no	support	and	no	cash.	Poor	guy	is	BURNED.	For	good. Well,	sort	of.	If	some	bigwig	at	the	FBI	wants	info	on	him,	he	can	get it	from	said	agency	if	he	has	enough	pull	and	the	person	is	a	high-value target.As	I	watched	this	show	for	years	I	kept	thinking:	Wouldn’t	it	be great	to	give	yourself	your	own	‘Burn	Notice’?	Disappear	from	society altogether?	Get	a	fresh	start	with	new	name,	new	job,	the	works,	in	some country	where	pretty	Filipinas	fall	out	of	coconut	trees	as	you	sit	on	a beach	drinking	margaritas? Well	okay,	maybe	not	that	extravagant.	Perhaps	it’s	more	simple	for you.	You	want	to	keep	the	collector’s	off	your	back	while	you	grow	a business	to	pay	back	your	student	loans.	Start	a	new	relationship.	Get away	from	an	abusive	wife	wielding	a	double-bladed	axe. It’s	all	rather	easy	to	speculate	but	difficult	to	implement.	We	like   our	safety	nets.	We	like	our	‘safe	jobs’,	and	a	lot	of	guys	don’t	like	losing money	in	online	ventures.	So	they	play	it	safe.	They	refuse	to	take	risks. Then	one	day	when	they	need	to	leave	the	country,	they	can’t	because they	took	no	action. Then	there	are	skip	tracers	to	worry	about. Skip	tracers?	What’re	those,	they	ask?	From	wiki.  information	  locate	 a	 subject	 whose	 contact	  Skip	 tracing	 tactics	 may	 be	 employed	 by	 debt	 collectors,	 process servers,	bail	bond	enforcers	 bounty	hunters ,	repossession	agents,	private investigators,	attorneys,	police	detectives,	and	journalists,	or	by	any	person attempting	 to	 is	 not immediately	 known.	 Similar	 techniques	 have	 also	 been	 utilized	 by investigators	to	locate	witnesses	in	criminal	trials.  Before	we	deal	with	skip	tracers,	a	word	of	caution:	NEVER	fake your	own	death	or	disappearance	since	doing	so	will	bring	more	heat	on you	than	if	you	shot	Dirty	Harry	in	the	ass.	Even	a	simple	disappearance can	lead	to	a	statewide	manhunt,	or	womanhunt	in	the	case	of	Leanne Bearden	who,	after	a	2-year	globe-trotting	vacation,	vanished	one	hot Texas	day. “I’m	going	for	a	walk.	Be	back	in	one	hour!”	were	her	last	words.	She hung	herself	from	a	tree	in	a	wooded	area	close	to	her	in-laws	home. Police	helicopters,	dogs,	and	even	state	troopers	spent	hundreds	of	hours looking	for	her	 no	suicide	note ,	fearing	she’d	been	snatched	and kidnapped.	I	sat	stunned	at	all	the	Youtube	comments	calling	for	the husband’s	crucifixion,	and	all	without	any	evidence	he’d	done	anything. Don’t	do	this. Don’t	kill	yourself	over	bad	debts.	Don’t	do	it	over	unemployment  apparently	why	the	woman	hung	herself .	Don’t	do	it	over	a	failed marriage	 taken	the	Red	Pill,	yet? .	Don’t	fake	your	own	death	and	try	to buy	fake	IDs	from	Craigslist.	If	you	try	to	cross	the	Canadian	border	with a	fake	passport	 because	we	know	how	nice	those	border	officers	are	on the	Fourth	of	July	with	a	thousand	Canadian-made	cars	in	line	to	shop , that	one	guard	can	ban	you	for	life.	Ask	George	Bush	what	happened when	one	tries	to	cross	with	a	DUI	record.	He	had	to	get	a	waiver.	But more	on	this	later. Instead	what	we	want	to	do	is	plant	false	leads	that	end	in Nowhereville	for	any	Skip	Tracer	hot	on	your	trail.	That’s	what	the	next   few	chapters	are	about.	Getting	somewhere	while	leading	any	skip	tracer or	other	investigator	to	believe	they’re	on	a	wild	good	chase.   A	World	Wide	Web	of	Deceit Your	most	prized	tool	in	seeking	information	is	also	your	enemy’s most	prized	tool	for	seeking	your	loss	of	freedom	be	it	handcuffs, garnishments	or	even	asset	forfeiture,	to	which	the	ATF	has	turned	into	a profit-industry.	Your	neck	is	out	there	online	as	naked	as	the	day	you were	born. Being	the	smart	cookie	you	are,	you	know	it	isn’t	rocket	science	to vanish	online.	Lots	of	guides	explain	how	to	cloak	your	identity	using	all kinds	of	tools.	Tor	for	starters.	Most	computer	literate	people	know	of	it. Then	there’s	chatting	on	Freenet.	That’s	not	so	easy.	Then	there	are	VPNs that	hide	your	IP	address.	You	can	even	chain	proxies	to	post	encrypted messages	on	Usenet	with	them	if	you	know	how	to	buy	services anonymously. But	those	guides	rarely	tell	you	what	pops	up	when	a	seasoned	skip tracer	simply	keys	in	your	home	phone	number	or	alias	into	a	search engine	and	starts	calling	every	person	you’ve	ever	known.	That’s	the	part even	the	encryption	experts	forget	about:	That	which	is	right	under	their very	noses.	Tracers,	like	collections,	will	harass	everyone	on	your	city block	about	you.	And	boy	do	they	lie.	They	lie	with	more	skill	than	the Devil	himself! 	Aliases Let’s	talk	about	aliases.	I’d	bet	good	money	that	you	or	your	kids	use the	same	alias	on	Facebook	and	Twitter	that	you	do	on	Usenet	and	The Pirate	Bay,	or	some	combination	thereof.	Maybe	something	cool	like Windsong.	You’ll	switch	it	up	a	bit	on	other	sites,	maybe	go	by Windsinger	or	some	such.	Oh	there	might	be	an	extra	number	or	two here	and	there,	but	we	humans	are	creatures	of	habit.	We	don’t	like	hard work	and	having	multiple	different	aliases	for	every	social	media…	well some	of	us	just	cannot	be	bothered	because	that’s	too	much	work	for	us to	do.	Mistake	numero	uno. To	prove	a	point	to	one	of	my	beautiful	nieces	in	Louisiana,	I	had	her   type	in	a	nic	she	uses	on	Twitter	and	P2P.	It	wasn’t	just	her	P2P messages	that	popped	up	but	those	she’d	typed	on	Usenet	as	well	- messages	from	long	dormant	times	when	she	was	a	wee	pre-teen.	As	it turned	out,	Google	indexes	Usenet	messages	from	decades	ago.	I	almost felt	bad	for	showing	her	Usenet	at	such	a	young	age.	And	believe	me, most	of	us	Usenet	guys	back	then	never	in	a	million	years	believed	we’d have	7	year	retention	rates	offered	by	Usenet	farms. But	the	real	danger	was	using	that	same	nic	across	the	board	on several	social	media	sites. One	website	allows	you	to	look	up	people	based	on	name	alone.	We found	a	dozen,	yes…	a	dozen	Americans	in	the	south	with	the	exact	same name	as	her	but	not	one	with	the	same	nic.	Anywhere	in	social	media. The	nic?	LinuxGrl. Any	Skip	Tracer	worth	their	salt	might	think	she	has	a	nerd	gene  she	does .	She	loves	coding	C++,	Java,	too.	She	loves	The	Matrix	and adores	the	little	blonde	hacker	geek	from	Jurassic	Park	like	a	long	lost sister.	Any	Skip	Tracer	would	find	her	messages	sprawled	across	the	net on	every	tech	forum	known	to	man.	She’s	quite	open	about	her	age,	too. When	we	looked	at	all	the	info,	it	lead	a	trail	right	to	her	bedroom. So	many	years	and	so	many	clues	build	quite	the	profile.	She	freaked	out as	any	red-headed	teenager	would	but	only	because	she	feared	they might	find	out	which	boy	she	has	a	crush	on. “Ye	gods!”	I	snapped.	“That’s	all	you’re	worried	about?”	To	which she	replied,	“What	else	could	happen?” We	were	even	able	to	find	out	from	these	messages	where	she meets	her	fellow	high	school	geeks	for	PvP	Warcraft	and	Fallout marathons	 the	pen	and	paper	game,	not	the	PC	RPG .   IP	Address	Searches Be	cautious	about	skipping	privacy	protection	if	you	have	an	online business.	Skip	Tracers	can	execute	a	simple	online	WHOIS	search	that often	reveals	who	owns	the	domain,	which	would	be	you.	They	may	even gain	your	address.	If	they	cannot	find	the	domain	owner	outright,	they may	be	able	to	follow	clues	you’ve	left	in	your	posts.	But	you’d	never	be so	careless	as	to	leave	your	real	name,	right? Right.	But	the	problem	isn’t	you.	The	problem	is	your	relatives.	Your friends.	Your	business	associates.	Your	ex-lovers.	A	clever	Skip	Tracer	will lie	to	fish	the	info	out	of	them. And	they	always	sugar-coat	it,	appearing	as	someone	who	wants	to help	you	-	an	angel	of	light	and	niceness	and	puffy	clouds:	A	prospective employer.	A	lawyer	looking	to	give	away	inheritance	money	 yeah,	right . A	movie	director	who	wants	to	offer	you	the	role	of	a	lifetime. You	may	hear	a	lot	of	affiliate	marketers	say	that	it	doesn’t	matter	if you	have	WHOIS	protection	or	not,	but	I	disagree.	If	you	want	to	shield yourself,	and	by	extension,	your	freedom	 the	secret	to	happiness	btw , then	you	need	to	not	leave	a	money	trail	to	your	front	doorstep. 	The	Courts Got	a	speeding	ticket	recently?	That	will	show	up	in	a	public	court record.	And	those	records	are	not	difficult	to	get.	Anything	that	happens on	public,	tax-funded	roads	is	often	available	to	any	Joe	Blow	who	wants it.	That	includes	fender-benders,	drug	busts	and	well,	anything	that involves	you	pleading	to	a	judge. A	big	danger	is	privately	owned	property.	That	is,	property	that	can be	taken	away	from	you	by	the	IRS,	the	Dept	of	Education,	your	Uncle Frick	who	works	for	the	EPA. Loose	lips	sink	ships.	Who	else	knows	about	the	land	but	you? Relatives?	Friends?	How	easily	can	a	Skip	Tracer	contact	them	about your	land—which	they	so	desperately	want	to	buy	for	a	million	dollars  oil? ?   Worse,	you	might	be	tempted	to	put	this	land	on	a	bank	loan application	as	collateral.	Don’t	do	that	either.	Such	things	are	available	to the	public	eye.	Not	the	account	numbers	mind	you	but	your	name	and address.	If	you	want	to	be	invisible,	don’t	go	taking	your	elvish	cloak	off in	Mordor	where	any	green-skinned	orc	can	sniff	you	out	and	ambush you.   Knowledge	is	power Knowledge	is	power.	Or	rather,	knowledge	is	potential	power.	That’s the	crux	of	it	alright	as	collectors	and	skip	tracers	must	rely	on	your ignorance.	In	fact	they	prefer	you	not	know	your	rights	so	as	to	better fuel	whatever	fear	tactics	they	employ. Let’s	say	you	see	the	writing	on	the	wall	and	in	six	months	you	will default	on	a	student	loan.	You	feel	helpless.	You	know	the	collectors	will be	coming.	You	know	the	phone	will	be	ringing.	You	know	they	will	be calling	your	employer	to	harass	you	and	your	friends,	your	family,	so what	can	you	do? Allow	me	to	sound	like	a	broken	record:	Knowledge	is	power.	They rely	on	your	ignorance	and	assuming	your	lender	won’t	work	with	you and	your	Ombudsman	is	fond	of	Houdini	acts,	there	are	a	few	steps	you can	take	to	minimize	grief. If	your	name address	is	scattered	over	social	media	like	pepper	on eggs,	then	you	need	to	remove	it	before	the	slime-skinned	collectors	get a	hold	of	it. 	-	Study	the	FDCPA	like	your	livelihood	depends	on	it	 which	it	does . Know	what	they	can	get	away	with	and	what	they	can’t.	Remember, knowledge	is	power.	If	you	wield	it,	they	will	respect	it	-	Check	your aliases.	Are	they	the	same	on	every	social	media	website?	Is	your	phone number	visible?	What	about	your	email?	Can	a	collector	or	any	stranger for	that	matter	view	your	private	info	on	Facebok?	How	about	Twitter? LinkedIn? -	This	above	all:	ask	for	any	debt	or	claim	to	be	given	in	writing. Student	loans?	Ask	for	a	copy	of	the	promissory	note.	Often	they	will NOT	have	this	information.	They	will	give	every	deadbeat	excuse	in	the world	so	as	not	to	send	it	and	believe	me	friend	I	have	heard	that	ALL: “We	don’t	have	to	send	that.”	 A	lie 	“We’ll	send	it	next	week.”	 Another lie.	If	that’s	true,	ask	her	to	send	you	a	screenshot 	“You	need	to	setup	an automated	payment	plan	first.”	 BIG	LIE 	Always	contest	the	debt	and   NEVER	send	a	payment	until	you	GET	THAT	promissory	note	or	bank loan	with	your	signature. 	Also,	look	into	these	and	know	what	they	cannot	do	Gramm-Leach Act	-	Legislation	that	limits	the	abuse	they	can	leave	on	your	message machine.	Many	collectors	don’t	pay	heed	to	this	at	all.	Call	them	on	it! 	Fair	Debt	Collection	Practices	Act 	Telephone	Consumer	Protection	Act 	The	double-edged	sword	in	all	of	this	is	that	saying:	“Please	do	not call	me	again!”	This	does	not	work.	You	must	issue	this	in	writing	to	the bank.	It’s	called	a	no-contact	order.	Sometimes	it	works,	sometimes	not. A	close	friend	of	mine	happened	to	secure	a	lucrative	deal	 by	her standards	anyway 	as	an	extra	on	a	movie	set	in	Los	Angeles.	He	was	an extra	with	a	few	speaking	lines.	Not	much	to	brag	about	down	at	Igor’s bar	but	it	was	a	good	amount	for	a	day’s	work:	$500.	As	luck	would	have it,	her	effort	to	pay	down	her	student	loan	went	awry.	The	collector called	her	mother	and	a	few	friends	and	managed	to	get	the	number	of someone	on	the	set.	Snakes	are	clever! You	can	imagine	what	happened. The	whole	set	had	to	stop	filming	to	allow	her	to	answer	that	stupid call.	So	never	underestimate	what	those	hucksters	will	do	to	your reputation,	and	prepare	accordingly.   How	to	Create	an	Anonymous	Bank Account One	wintery	night	when	few	were	paying	attention,	the	Canadian Parliament	decided	to	pass	a	budget	bill	containing	the	single	most wicked	act	of	treason	in	western	history. It’s	name	is	FATCA	 Short	for	FATCAT .	Developed	by	Obama,	Harry Reid	and	Nancy	Pelosi	in	2010	with	a	fully	compliant	Democratic Congress,	it’s	workings	are	the	kind	of	thing	a	superpower	might	enact	in a	sanctions	bill	against	a	terrorist	state	like	Iran	or	North	Korea,	certainly not	Canada.	And	when	you	get	right	down	to	it,	it	is	an	act	of	financial war	-	mandating	every	bank	in	Canada	fork	over	the	financial information	of	 any	Canadian	with	US	citizenship.	It’s	passed	to	the Canadian	Tax	Service,	then	to	the	IRS	-	the	same	who	demand	all Canadians	with	U.S.	citizenship	to	file	and or	pay	taxes	to	the	US	despite not	ever	living	there. Things	like	this	are	a	slippery	slope	to	civil	wars	and	revolutions. Worse,	the	Canadian	Parliament	did	not	resist	in	selling	out	it’s	own people.	One	politician	in	Parliament	claimed	“We	had	no	choice	as	we had	thirty	days	to	decide	or	face	a	30%	penalty	on	all	investments	in	the USA.”In	other	words,	they	were	“just	following	orders.” Where’ve	we	heard	that	before? At	any	rate	it	seems	that	Big	Brother	is	alive	and	well	and	Judas himself	could	not	have	orchestrated	a	sharper	backstab.	A	few	Canadians have	filed	a	federal	lawsuit	to	be	sure,	claiming	it	to	be	unconstitutional  it	is ,	but	even	if	the	suit	is	successful	and	the	law	overturned,	banks	will not	be	in	a	hurry	to	revert	their	systems	as	it	is	so	expensive. But	make	no	mistake:	If	you	are	a	US	citizen,	they	want	to	know	so as	to	rat	you	out	to	the	IRS	for	not	paying	taxes	in	two	countries.	In essence,	for	not	being	a	nice	little	lemming	with	wrists	outstretched.	This is	a	problem	for	those	who	love	freedom,	and	by	extension,	happiness,	to   say	nothing	about	those	who	love	anonymity.   Hiding	Assets  If	you	want	to	hide	valuables	from	a	spouse	and	do	not	mind tangible	assets,	look	into	opening	an	anonymous	deposit	box	overseas.	It is	still	technically	an	“account”	but	Das	Safe,	located	in	Vienna,	does	a good	job	of	preserving	your	privacy	and	demand	no	ID	from	you.	Bear	in mind	though	that	if	you	lose	your	key,	it’s	tough	to	retrieve	another	one. Also	be	aware	that	anything	sitting	in	an	overseas	vault	is	not convenient.	It	is	time-consuming	to	get	it,	sell	it,	convert	it	to	gold	or	cash and	retrieve	it	and	all	paying	attention	to	leaving	no	financial	trail.	But then	financial	anonymity	has	never	been	cheap.	You	have	to	weigh	the needs	of	an	emergency	to	your	need	of	invisibility. 	Other	Options: Bitcoin You	can	go	the	Bitcoin	route	and	buy	currency,	but	you	will	face	stiff fees	as	Paypal	is	a	high-risk	method	when	the	two	are	paired.	And	there is	 a	 tough	 if	 you’re	 not	 good	 with	 computers. learning	 curve	 Nevertheless,	there	are	guides	that	can	walk	you	through	it	but	Bitcoins are	not	anonymous	by	themselves. 	Ptshamrock Here	you	can	buy	an	anonymous	debit	card	and	other	items.	They are	legitimate	and	have	been	around	for	years,	however	are	not	cheap, nor	are	they	perfect.	Blackhat	marketers	sometimes	use	them. 	OcraOcra	outfits	offshore	investments,	trusts	and	foundations	for,	as they	term	it,	“Wealth	Protection”	and	“International	Business”.	You	may find	they	offer	something	you	need. As	you	can	see,	there	are	downsides	to	just	about	every	facet	of anonymous	financial	accounts.	What	we	have	not	discussed	is	accessing any	of	those	accounts	online.	This	is	dangerous	and	should	be	avoided.   But	 sigh 	there	are	times	when	you	simply	must	get	access	to	an	online account	and	be	secure	doing	it.	Here’s	how:	1.	A	VPN	 Virtual	Private Network .	Trial	versions	abound.	You	need	this	to	shield	yourself	from search	engines,	not	the	government.	For	that,	use	Tor.	Buy	the	VPN,	the price	of	which	is	usually	under	ten	bucks,	then	install	Tor. 2.	Tails Tor	downloaded	to	a	memory	stick	if	you’re	truly	paranoid. My	Tor	book	gives	details	if	you	want	lengthy	examples	but	this	above all:	never	reveal	any	personal	data. 3.	Anonymous	Debit	Card,	Loadable.	If	you	load	the	card	with	cash, you	must	not	do	so	within	your	own	town.   Student	Loans  English	majors,	perhaps	more	than	any	other	major	 except	Gender Studies ,	make	up	the	bulk	of	criticism	for	student	loan	debt.	It	goes	well beyond	snide	comments	made	at	the	office.	Politicians	have	come	out slandering	liberal	arts	majors	in	general	but	you	never	hear	them criticize	STEM	degrees,	nor	do	they	mention	how	brutal	those	programs are	when	Professor	Punjab	wants	to	shrink	his	incoming	Biology	class	by 85%	to	free	up	some	research	time.	We’ve	all	heard	the	usual	questions. “Why	did	you	not	study	chemistry	or	engineering?	Or	go	for	an MBA?	Maybe	an	M.D.?”	they	ask	you. Often,	these	stone-throwers	neglect	to	do	any	research	on	these other	STEM	degrees.	If	they	did,	they’d	realize	that	they	take	out	just	as much,	if	not	more,	debt	than	their	liberal	arts	brethren.	Automation coupled	with	outsourcing	is	making	every	degree	irrelevant,	some	faster than	others.	Even	medical	students	are	graduating	with	$200,000	in student	 loan	 debt.	 That’s	 debt	 that	 is	 neither	 dischargeable	 in bankruptcy	nor	easy	to	pay	off	as	they: -	Garnish	your	wages	 but	not	before	slandering	you	to	your	work colleagues  -	Seize	your	assets -	Crucify	your	relationship	with	your	employer Now	it	is	everyone’s	problem. The	main	problem	students	face,	and	one	we	will	eradicate,	is	this: how	does	one	work	off	the	debt	without	being	terrorized?	Better	yet, how	does	one	make	a	fresh	start	when	they’ve	absolutely	exhausted	all options	save	that	of	stringing	themselves	up	from	the	nearest	tree? In	short,	how	to	disappear	at	least	temporarily	so	you	can	grow	a business	that	enables	the	paying	off	of	said	debt?	Any	businessman	will tell	you,	debt	will	kill	any	business.	You	might	be	chuckling	to	hear	this, wondering	if	such	a	thing	is	even	possible	for	an	English	major. “Pay	off	a	student	loan	to	the	tune	of	a	hundred	grand	by…	writing, you	say?	Impossible!”   It	most	certainly	is	possible.	I	know	this	because	my	brother	did	it, but	not	before	teaching	him	how	to	keep	those	baying	bloodhounds	at bay.	Knowledge	is	80%	of	the	battle.	That	is,	how	to	fight	back.	I	showed him.	He	showed	them.	And	I	will	show	you.   Tax	Offsets Unless	you	live	in	Canada,	any	federally	defaulted	student	loan	will likely	result	in	a	tax	offset	by	the	IRS	if	it	isn’t	dealt	with.	Cutting	off communication	works	only	if	you’ve	got	leverage.	If	not,	they	take	your tax	return	unless	you	happen	to	be	self-employed	 more	on	that	later . Worse	than	this	is	when	you	are	garnished	and	get	a	tax	offset.	Let’s	first discuss	what	legal	options	you	have. A	few	points:	-	Your	spouse	can	have	her	tax	return	taken	as	well even	if	she	did	not	cosign	the	loan.	She	 can	however	file	an	injured spouse	form	and	send	it	to	the	IRS.	Not	the	best	option. -	You	can	challenge	the	offset	using	this	site. https:  www.myeddebt.com borrower topReviewNavigation It’s	difficult	and	for	this	to	be	successful	you	need	to	prove	validity as	to	why	the	offset	should	not	occur.	Here	are	some	valid	reasons:	1.  You’ve	already	paid	the	debt	prior	to	them	kickstarting	the	offset	2.  You’re	 disabled	  not	 temporarily 	 3. 	 You’ve	 recently	 claimed bankruptcy	4. 	You	view	the	debt	as	unenforceable	Real	problems	arise when	people	put	off	challenging	it.	They	ignore	all	warning	signs	and only	at	the	end	realize	how	serious	it	is.	Therefore,	 prevention	is paramount	if	we	want	to	avoid	collection	agencies. 	Prevention:	The	Department	of	Education’s	Worst	Enemy Be	aware	that	if	you	try	to	outsmart	the	Dept	of	Education,	you	will have	a	tough	time	of	establishing	a	reputation	for	your	business	if	you want	to	expand	 i.e.	borrow	money .	Anonymity	will	be	your	calling	card, and	you	will	always	be	looking	over	your	shoulder	in	the	USA.	Problem is,	creditors	you	ask	for	money	don’t	like	anonymity.	It	may	get	so difficult	that	you	are	tempted	to	leave	for	Canada,	either	to	take	up	a student	visa,	work	visa	or	to	seek	permanent	residency	there. Other	digital	nomads	have	done	this	and	succeeded.	They’re	all	over the	place	in	every	sense	of	the	word.	Some	work	for	Odesk	and	eLance while	others	go	the	affiliate	route,	but	not	without	jumping	major	hoops.   That	should	be	the	last	resort	since	you	don’t	want	something	preventing you	from	using	your	passport. That	said,	let’s	discuss	how	to	prevent	an	offset	so	we	don’t	get	into that	very	long	minefield	of	red	tape. 	Consolidation Assuming	you	don’t	qualify	for	forgiveness,	the	Direct	Loan	program can	be	your	ticket	out	of	this	mess	if	you’re	not	too	deep	in	the	hole.	One option	is	to	group	your	loans	together	which	would	take	your	loan	out	of default	and	put	it	in	good	standing.	The	other	is	IBR,	or	Income	Based Repayment.	If	you’re	making	pennies	working	at	7-Eleven,	then	you	will likely	pay	nothing.	Nada.	Zero.	But	the	time	to	get	approved	can	take	one to	three	months.	You	can	do	the	math	at	the	link	below: http:  www.ibrinfo.org calculator.php 	The	other	thing	to	remember	about	consolidation	is	that	your interest	rate	must	factor	into	any	decisions	you	make.	My	advice	is	to wait	until	you	are	out	of	school	before	accruing	additional	loans	by consolidation	-	when	the	interest	rate	is	locked	at	a	low	amount. 	Rehabilitation Many	students	apply	for	rehabilitating	their	loans,	which	takes	nine months.	Talk	with	your	lender	to	work	out	a	payment	plan.	When	the rehab	process	is	complete,	default	status	is	changed	to	good	standing.	At issue	is	this:	students	are	eligible	for	taking	out	massive	student	loans  again! 	which	does	not	help	the	situation. Forbearance:	This	should	be	the	last	bullet	in	your	holster.	If	all	of the	above	fails,	you	can	put	your	loan	into	forbearance.	This	helps	stave off	the	vampiric	collectors	but	with	a	terrible	price:	excessive	interest! We’re	talking	biblical	revelatory	interest	here,	called	capitalized	interest that	will	kill	any	business	before	it	gets	off	the	ground.	Then	there	are fees	the	lender	likes	to	tack	on.	Debt	slavery	is	alive	and	well. Those	are	the	legal	ways	to	deal	with	student	loans. The	shady	way	is	to	just	let	them	default.	If	you	go	this	route,	they will	call	and	harass	you	dozens	of	times	per	day.	They	will	hound	your relatives	and	friends	and	colleagues.	It	will	show	up	on	a	credit	report	for   a	potential	employer	to	see.	And	that’s	not	even	the	most	absurd	part. Want	to	know	what	it	is? Okay,	here	it	is:	They’re	not	really	interested	in	you	paying	them into them	 back	 interested	 back.	 They’re	 deferral forbearance	so	they	can	charge	you	insane	interest	 which	they fleece	the	taxpayers	to	pay . Bottom	line:	Pay	something.	Anything.	Even	fifty	dollars	a	month. Heck	even	ten	dollars	a	month	by	money	order	is	something	traceable you	can	show	a	judge,	heaven	forbid	it	should	ever	come	to	that.  you	 putting	  in	   Social	Security	Numbers If	you’ve	ever	spent	time	googling	your	own	name,	you	know	how easy	it	is	to	find	other	people	with	the	same	name	as	you.	I	googled	my own	and	found	a	pepper-bearded	lawyer	in	Tennessee	with	the	exact same	name	that	I	have.	Same	age.	Same	name.	Different	looks	and different	jobs.	I	write	for	a	living.	He	sues	people	for	a	living. But	we	have	different	social	security	numbers.	He	probably	uses	his for	just	about	everything	under	the	sun,	including	applying	for	work before	he	went	lawyering	up.	I	don’t.	Reason	being	is	that	I	don’t	like where	I	sleep	and	fart	being	known	by	every	red-headed	harpy	named Betty	who	works	in	HR.	So	to	that	I’ve	used	a	fake	address	for	as	long	as	I remember.	When	I	didn’t	have	the	luxury	of	using	my	own,	I	used	my friend’s	address. As	any	privacy-minded	man	should. 	Employment Back	in	2008	when	Obama	took	office	and	the	economy	nose-dived, I	applied	in	person	to	some	600	jobs	to	supplement	my	income.	I	must have	lost	a	hundred	pounds	hitting	the	pavement.	The	overwhelming response	in	98%	of	the	jobs	I	applied	for? Apply	online. It	mattered	not	what	establishment	I	went	to.	FedEx.	Home	Depot. Publishers.	Newspapers.	They	all	said	the	same	thing:	Apply	online. Apply	online.	Apply	online.	I	heard	those	two	words	so	much	that	I	began to	see	them	in	my	digital	alarm	clock,	blinking	like	some	countdown	on	a thermonuclear	device.	Worse	was	the	fact	that	many	asked	me	for	my social	number	 before	 being	 hired.	 I	 found	 it	 all	 appalling	 and disrespectful	of	someone’s	privacy. Never,	ever	give	this	out	before	you	are	hired.	Doing	so	will	set	you in	the	crosshairs	of	any	collectors PIs	out	there	looking	to	gun	you	down. The	two	jobs	I	did	secure	hired	me	despite	that	I’d	given	an	obvious	fake social	number	prior	to	hiring	 1234-56-7890 .	The	interviewer	 a	man    could	have	cared	less	though	I	did	fork	over	my	real	one	when	they	said, “Welcome	aboard.” 	Things	to	Avoid Universities When	I	attended	the	University	of	New	Orleans,	the	SSN	was	used for	nearly	everything.	Checking	out	books.	Scheduling	classes.	Asking	for grade	transcripts.	I	worked	in	the	Financial	Aid	office	and	there,	too,	I found	few	students	were	referred	to	by	name.	You	were	just	a	number.	I would	call	up	to	schedule	an	appointment	and	the	first	thing	they’d	say, before	anything	else:	“What’s	your	social?” Pathetic. Even	more	pathetic	was	that	anyone	who	worked	in	the	UNO	system had	access	to	this	number.	It	mattered	not	how	secure	the	system	was against	identity	theft	because	any	schmuck	who’d	just	transferred	in could	work	in	any	department	he	wanted	as	long	as	the	work-study money	was	there.	Free	money,	they	called	it. Taxpayer	money. Be	careful	about	throwing	this	number	around	like	monopoly money. 	Class	Rosters This	was	another	biggie. On	my	way	to	the	restroom,	I	happened	to	notice	one	professor	had every	student’s	SSN	beside	their	name	on	the	class	roster.	I	began	to wonder	why	this	was,	and	if	other	professors	did	the	same	for	all	other classes.	Sadly,	there	wasn’t	anything	I	could	really	do	about	this	at	the time.Computer	Labs Back	when	we	used	a	VAX	system	at	UNO	 around	the	time	Netscape became	popular ,	we	had	to	use	our	SSN	to	login.	This	same	login	scheme was	how	one	Harvard	student	was	busted	in	2014	when	he	used	Tor	to send	a	bomb	threat…	out	of	sheer	boredom!	Not	too	bright. The	other	threat	is	that	students	walking	by	you	in	a	lab	setting	can see	you	type	it	out.	Heck	they	can	even	see	you	from	behind	since	in many	labs	the	chairs	are	fitted	close	together	to	accommodate	a	sea	of   new	students	every	semester.	Avoid	this	if	you	can	by	logging	in	from your	own	laptop. 	Grades	Listed	Outside	Class I	was	a	pre-med	gunner	before	I	got	smart	and	quit.	In	my	freshman chem	class,	grades	were	posted	outside	the	classroom	in	the	hall,	listed with	everyone	else’s	social	security	number.	I	watched	in	disarray	as many	a	student	slid	his	finger	down	the	list	to	see	his	grade.	If	I	was	the nefarious	type,	it	would	have	been	a	no-brainer	to	match	the	kid	with	the social	number	and	execute	the	beginnings	of	a	clever	identity	theft scheme. I	scratched	mine	out	with	a	Sharpie	marker. 	DormsMy	first	semester	of	college	had	me	and	my	brother	lugging	my	few meager	possessions	up	six	floors	of	my	dormitory.	But	prior	to	that,	I	had to	check	in.	Only	checking	in	was	done	 outdoors,	just	outside	the entryway. I	had	to	present	my	driver’s	license	to	show	I	wasn’t	some	old	cajun bum	dropout	from	culinary	school	to	shack	up	with	the	girls	going	to	and fro.	They	checked	my	name	on	a	paper	roster	to	see	which	room	I	had been	assigned	 I	requested	a	single	room…	they	laughed .	And	there	next to	my	name	was	my	SSN.	Wonderful,	I	thought.	That	number	again. There	have	been	a	few	incidents	with	SS	numbers	being	stolen	over the	years	and	used	for	all	kinds	of	mischief	overseas. Now	you	might	be	thinking,	why	would	someone	go	to	all	that trouble?	Steal	someone	else’s	social	security	number	so	they	can	do… what	exactly? Well,	I’ll	tell	you.	If	you’re	a	criminal,	the	best	thing	in	the	world	is	to steal	someone	else’s	identity.	For	this	reason,	you	should	never,	ever	use someone	else’s	number.	That	other	person	can	be	on	the	FBI’s	Most Wanted	list	and	the	day	you	find	that	out	will	be	too	late	without	them charging	you	with	identity	theft	yourself.   Changing	Your	Name Changing	Your	Name	Stateside Changing	your	name	isn’t	difficult.	It’s	getting	a	new	SSN	that’s	a pain.	It	isn’t	like	reaching	into	a	bag	of	Skittles.	More	often	than	not,	it’s done	by	a	court	order.	The	requirements	are	beyond	strict,	placing	the burden	of	proof	on	you,	the	ever	law-abiding	citizen…	One	being	that	you must	prove	to	a	court	of	law	that	you	are	in	danger	of	losing	your	life. And	you	need	to	prove	it,	not	just	say	it.	This	might	be	an	abusive	spouse who	tried	to	kill	you	or	the	FBI’s	Witness	Protection	Plan	or	some	such, but	the	social	security	number	will	likely	stay	with	you	without	this. Here	is	what	the	government	says	about	getting	a	new	SSN.  We	 do	 not	 routinely	 assign	 different	 Social	 Security	 numbers. Generally,	only	the	following	circumstances	are	used	to	assign	a	different number:  Sequential	 numbers	 have	 been	 assigned	 to	 members	 of	 the	 same family	and	are	causing	problems;	More	than	one	person	has	been	assigned, or	is	using,	the	same	number;  An	individual	has	religious	or	cultural	objections	to	certain	numbers  or	digits	in	the	original	number;  original	number;	or  domestic	violence,	has	occurred.  A	victim	of	identity	theft	continues	to	be	disadvantaged	by	using	the  Situations	 of	 harassment,	 abuse,	 or	 life	 endangerment,	 including  	White	Lies Privacy	advocates,	no	matter	how	careful,	cannot	get	around	the SSN	requirements	on	FAFSA	forms	without	risking	them	saying	no.	If	you use	a	fake	SSN,	you	can	be	charged	with	a	felony.	So	what	to	do? What	you	do	is	lie	to	everyone	else.	For	instance: There	was	a	time	when	I	was	contacted	by	a	collection	agency. TransMediaCorp	or	some	innocuous	name.	Usually	when	a	collection agency	calls,	if	you	listen	closely	you	can	hear	all	the	other	script   last	 name.	  monkeys	banging	away	on	their	keyboards	in	the	background,	chatting away	 mostly	lies .	My	answer	was	to	lie	right	back	to	them. “Is	this	Mr.	X?”	agent	Betty	asked. “Mr.	Who?”	I	shot	back.	 Always,	always	get	them	to	repeat	it!  She	repeated.	I	feigned	deafness.	“Say	it	once	more?” She	did	and	at	that	point,	I	corrected	her,	saying	she	had	the	right It	 was	 misspelled	 and first	 name	 but	 the	 wrong	 mispronounced.	I	feigned	being	insulted. They	had	the	wrong	guy.	Tough	break.	She	then	asked	for	my	SSN.	I gave	her	a	false	one	for	the	simple	reason	that	as	soon	as	you	identify yourself	 it	is	after	all	the	FIRST	question	they	will	ask ,	you	paint	a blood-red	target	on	your	back.	They’ve	matched	the	name	with	a	legal address.	From	there,	it	will	be	one	perpetual	nightmare	after	another. The	amount	in	question	was	a	$500	Perkins	student	loan	I	had	paid off	years	earlier,	and	one	that	I’d	taken	on	some	25	years	ago.	But	I wasn’t	about	to	tell	her	that.	God	knows	if	I	did,	they	might	consider	the debt	paid	after	I	faxed	proof	of	payment,	but	not	before	they	relayed	my name	to	other	collection	agencies	for	their	databases. After	this	episode,	I	called	up	every	service	provider	I	could	think	of that	held	my	SSN	and	had	it	changed	to	the	fictitious	one.	Cable	company. Electric.	Internet	Service	Provider.	It	turned	out	that	even	the	company that	mows	my	lawn	had	it	on	file.	Who	knows	how	they	got	it,	but	only one	company	gave	me	grief	over	the	change:	the	power	company.	So	I handled	it	in	writing,	making	sure	to	use	plenty	of	CAPS	and	BOLD	words filled	with	sound	and	fury	 signifying	nothing,	now	that	I	think	about	it . Some	people	can	better	sense	a	bluff	over	the	phone	than	by	mail. By	mail,	you	can	sound	like	Tony	Soprano	and	if	you	don’t	get	some action	you	will	send	the	boys	over	for	a	polite	little	talk. Clone	Home One	option	you	might	employ	is	using	a	mail	service	that	severs	any connection	to	you.	Examples	abound	of	companies	you	can	hire	who	ask very	few	questions.	A	few	ask	zero	questions.	I’ve	had	good	experiences with	earthclassmail.com,	for	instance,	but	there	are	others	if	you	travel internationally. Another	idea	is	to	check	out	abandoned	houses	where	you	live. Mostly	this	applies	to	city	dwellers	but	I	have	found	a	few	in	rural   settings,	too.	Use	the	address	of	the	abandoned	house	to	have	any shipments mail	sent	to	you	there.	Just	don’t	go	using	the	same	house over	and	over	again. It	probably	is	a	good	time	to	repeat	this:	Never	give	out	someone else’s	information	on	a	credit	card	or	loan	application.	Like,	ever.	This includes	their	address.	In	most	first	world	countries	this	is	a	serious crime.	Someone	somewhere	will	get	burned	as	one	success	will	lead	to another	and	it	will	become	a	habit	that	is	as	hard	to	get	rid	of	as	an alcoholic	getting	rid	of	margaritas	in	Maui.	It	can	also	destroy	any	chance you	have	if,	at	a	later	date,	you	want	to	legally	get	rid	of	debt	via bankruptcy. Lie,	but	lie	responsibly!   Passports	and	Canada This	is	an	area	I	regret	having	personal	experience	in.	Since	9 11, many	systems	have	been	built	for	inter-departmental	communications yet	airports	still	have	lax	security	-	especially	the	TSA.	Border	Stations are	an	interesting	study	and	I	dare	say	Canadian	Border	Officers	are, fortunately,	nothing	like	their	lackluster	TSA	brethren.	What	gets	flagged at	one	station	gets	flagged	at	them	all.	It’s	a	little	too	Orwellian	for	my taste	but	I	try	to	be	respectful	whenever	I’m	passing	through. If	you	drop	attitude	with	the	Canadian	agent	at	the	Niagara	Falls crossing,	the	guard	on	the	other	side	of	the	country	can	 notice	I	did	not say	will 	know	about	it	in	minutes	if	he	enters	it	into	the	system. The	SSN	is	tied	to	your	name	and	employment	but	does	not	appear on	the	passport	itself.	But	a	border	officer	can	ban	you	for	LIFE	if	you	lie about	any	criminal	record	entering	Canada.	They	locked	out	George	Bush from	entering	over	a	DUI	he’d	received	in	1976.	Not	kidding.	He	had	to get	a	waiver	and	that	was	just	to	visit,	not	actually	move	there. Sneaking	in	carries	risks	too,	unless	you	happen	to	be	Nightcrawler from	the	X-Men	and	can	teleport	yourself	in	the	blink	of	an	eye	across	the Falls.	As	far	as	I	know,	I	don’t	possess	this	ability. What	can	we	learn	from	this? We	can	learn	not	to	leave	trails. One	option	is	to	not	use	our	passport	since	it	leaves	a	trail	just	as visible	as	the	sulfur	did	for	Nightcrawler.	But	this	is	not	very	practical since	it	makes	international	travel	problematic.	Still,	sneaking	into Canada	or	into	the	USA	does	have	its	advantages	if	you	have	good	reason to	go	off	the	grid.	Many	do.	In	fact,	the	U.S.	border	sees	more	sneak	into Canada	than	the	other	way.	From	WinnipegPress:  “More	 people	 were	 caught	 trying	 to	 sneak	 into	 Canada	 at	 remote border	points	with	the	United	States	in	2008	than	the	other	way	around,	a newly	released	intelligence	report	reveals.  It	was	the	second	straight	year	that	continental	human	smuggling	and  other	surreptitious	crossings	tilted	in	Canada’s	direction.   The	RCMP	attributes	the	trend	to	factors	including	a	U.S.	crackdown on	 undocumented	 workers,	 more	 American	 agents	 along	 the	 border	 and the	shaky	state	of	the	U.S.	economy.	The	figures,	the	latest	available,	show 952	 people	 were	 caught	 entering	 Canada	 between	 legitimate	 border crossings,	 while	 819	 were	 U.S.-bound.	 They	 work	 at	 strategic	 points between	border	crossings	to	thwart	smugglers	of	everything	from	people and	drugs	to	currency	and	firearms.”  Obviously,	sneaking	across	is	not	a	new	trend.	But	let’s	assume	you need	to	sneak	into	Canada	and	need	to	do	it	quietly,	with	no	Orwellian tracking	system	sniffing	at	your	heels.	Let’s	also	assume	you	are	going	it solo…	with	no	assistance	at	all. 	Without	Assistance Crossing	outside	of	a	checkpoint	is	very	easy.	Nothing	to	it	in	fact. But	doing	it	anonymously,	now	that’s	 hard.	Harder	in	big	towns.	It’s illegal	to	try	and	you	might	not	get	caught	the	first	time.	But	most	guys will	keep	doing	what	they	think	works	the	best	and	then	rinse	and repeat.	If	they	succeeded	on	the	first	try,	well	dag	nabbit	they	are ingenious!	Rinse	and	repeat. Bank	robbers	 usually 	don’t	get	caught	the	first	time	either.	It’s when	they	do	it	again	and	again	using	the	same	method	that	gets	them caught.	Their	egos	rocket	into	orbit.	They	get	overconfident.	They	get cocky.	In	fact	you	could	apply	this	trait	to	most	low-level	crimes,	even non-violent	ones	like	sneaking	across. The	border	itself	looks	like	a	typical	power	line	cut,	forests	on	each side,	but	the	further	you	get	from	a	town,	the	less	guarded	it	is.	But	you should	know	the	ecosystem	of	whatever	area	regardless	if	you	plan	to hike drive fly	through	because	let’s	face	it,	it’d	be	quite	a	downer	to make	all	that	effort	only	to	be	the	next	contestant	on	Mr.	Grizzly’s	‘You Bet	Your	Life‘. Most	rural	spots	and	undeveloped	areas	are	heavily	guarded	by movement	sensors.	Trigger	one	of	those	and	you’ll	alert	the	authorities.   Response	time	varies	significantly,	depending	on	population	and distance	to	the	nearest	checkpoint	and	of	course,	manpower.	All	the technology	in	the	world	does	the	Borg	no	good	if	all	of	their	Borg	drones are	overworked	and	stretched	to	the	limit.	This	is	in	your	favor. It	may	be	an	hour	or	ten	minutes	before	one	arrives.	If	the	latter, you’ll	walk	a	little	ways	before	the	border	patrol	drives	up.	After	which you	get	to	meet	Officer	Simon	Sez	who	carries	a	semi-automatic	rifle along	with	four	of	his	buddies,	one	of	whom	will	ask	you	point	blank:	“Do you	realize	where	you	are,	sir?”	To	which	you	should	state	with	an innocent	smile	as	you	look	around,	feigning	relief	that	you	happened upon	this	nice	Canadian	officer:	“Hale	no	sir,	I	don’t	believe	I	do.	Can	you please	tell	us?” Politeness	with	a	dash	of	respect	 always	saying	sir 	will	win	over	a Canadian	border	guard	80%	of	the	time,	assuming	you’re	not	committing a	crime,	and	you	are	if	you’re	sneaking	across! But	that’s	if	you	get	lucky.	If	not,	you’ll	be	arrested	and	deported	if you	don’t	have	dual-citizenship.	Not	only	will	Canadian	authorities charge	and	fine	you,	so	will	American	authorities.	It’s	a	$5000	US	fine	and criminal	record	for	circumventing	a	designated	border	crossing. 	With	Assistance   Very	much	the	easier	of	the	two	since	it’s	not	exactly	rocket	science to	get	you	across	the	border	in	either	a	privately	owned	plane	or	smaller- than-usual	boat	or	other	watercraft.	Better	still	if	you’re	smuggled	in close	to	a	Mohawk	native	reservation	where	cigarette	smugglers	get picked	up	all	the	time	 and	overlooked 	by	Canadian	border	officials. In	the	event	you	do	try	to	cross,	make	sure	it’s	not	the	‘easy	path’ others	take.	It’s	all	an	illusion	setup	by	the	RCMP	to	catch	you	on	a	well- worn	trail.	Most	people	caught	do	something	stupid	like	crossing	at	the Silver	Lake	Road	area	or	farm	land	close	to	the	Huntingdon Sumas crossing.	Every	time	I	hear	of	a	bust,	and	the	details	that	come	from	that bust,	I	think	of	what	T-Rex	hunter	Roland	said	in	Jurassic	Park:	Lost World	when	he	tells	Hammond’s	successor	to	forget	about	setting	base camp	 at	 their	 present	 location	 that’s	 plagued	 with location,	 a	 velociraptors. “Listen,	we’re	on	a	game	trail	and	carnivores	hunt	on	game	trails!	Do you	want	to	setup	base	camp	or	a	buffet?” Smuggling	anything	like	contraband	by	way	of	car	is	foolish.	There are	sensors	at	border	crossings.	Those	include	vehicle	scanning	x-ray machines,	chemical	sniffers	and	sniffer	dogs.	So	any	attempt	to	hide	in	a vehicle	heading	into	Canada	just	won’t	work	either.	The	GlobeandMail ironically	enough	went	into	further	detail	on	what	not	to	do,	even revealing	that	some	hotels	along	the	border	are	under	surveillance	for illegal	crossers. Bottom	line:	Don’t	ever	go	into	velociraptor	territory	on	the	cheap!   Anonymous	Phones How	the	FBI	Traces	Calls Not	every	average	Joe	who	loathes	the	NSA	has	something	illegal	to hide,	and	I’m	about	as	average	Joe	as	you	can	get.	I	enjoy	shrimp	at	Red Lobster.	I	love	Mardi	Gras	in	the	French	Quarter	whenever	I	visit.	I	play video	games	with	the	kids	down	at	the	Fun	Arcade.	And	sometimes	I conduct	business	while	they	play	on	prepaid	phones	called	burners	while the	kids	play.	Burners	the	NSA	doesn’t	like.	In	fact	they	have	a	real	hard time	linking	those	phones	to	my	real	identity.	It	isn’t	impossible,	mind you,	only	difficult.	Since	I	am	not	a	high-value	target,	they	don’t	bother. At	least,	I	hope	they’re	not	bothering. Now	then,	you	probably	already	know	about	MVNOs	 Mobile	Virtual Network	Operators 	that	allow	you	to	sign	up	pseudo-anonymously. They	ask	for	no	identifying	info	unless	you	want	to	give	it	to	them	-	but that	alone	is	not	enough	to	thwart	the	NSA.	Phone	companies	are	now required	to	have	the	technology	to	work	with	law	enforcement	under	the 1994	CALEA	law. Worse	still	is	the	fact	that	despite	what	appeals	courts	have	said,	we still	have	no	real	expectation	of	privacy.	Most	state	law	dictate	that	as long	as	one	person	knows	about	the	recording,	it	is	legal.	Note	I	did	not say	one	other	person.	Only	one	person…	the	one	doing	the	recording. Wiretap	laws	are	a	maze	of	red	tape	that	would	make	Stalin	blush.	The counter	is	this:	not	everyone	uses	the	same	phone. That’s	in	our	favor. 	The	Cons	of	Using	a	Burner You	can	pitch	it	in	the	trash	after	use	and	dissolve	any	trail	to	you. That’s	it,	and	even	then..	as	long	as	you	took	action	to	conceal	your activity.	The	Craigslist	killer	was	caught	by	the	FBI	visa	cell	triangulation —the	GPS	signals	from	his	real	phone	and	prepaid	phone	came	from	the same	place.	He	even	had	it	on	him	when	he	bought	the	burner	phone. When	he	killed	someone,	both	phones	were	easily	traced	since	he	had   them	on	him	when	he	committed	the	crime. Not	so	smart,	but	then	most	criminals	don’t	get	caught	the	first	or second	time.	They	get	caught	on	the	third,	fourth	or	fifth	time	 remember bank	robbers? .	The	adrenaline	rush	addicts	them	to	the	point	they’re always	looking	for	the	next	fix…	often	without	upgrading	their	skillset. The	MAC	address	can	kill	anonymity	as	well.	Like	the	IP	address	for computers	tied	to	a	network,	it	can	lead	right	to	your	front	door.	There are	apps	like	Macspoofer	that	aid	in	preventing	this,	but	they	are	not perfect. 	The	Pros	of	Using	a	Burner	Phone Number	one	rule:	Do	not	use	it	continually	for	any	sensitive business	or	personal	transactions.	No	more	than	a	few	days	for something	important.	If	you’re	on	vacation	in	say,	Singapore,	and	don’t want	the	NSA	spying	on	you	and	the	kids,	that’s	easy.	Just	switch	the SIMs	out	upon	arrival.	Same	for	Philippines,	Thailand,	etc. But	for	something	like	spying?	That’s	a	whole	other	discussion.	One might	say,	“Well,	if	I’m	running	a	North	Korean	spy	op,	why	not	bypass any	surveillance	by	having	my	entire	team	switch	to	newly	bought phones	at	the	same	time?” The	problem	with	that	is	then	you’ve	created	a	clear	pattern	of	a group	of	phones	all	activating	at	the	same	time.	You	might	even	get careless	and	give	each	operative	the	same	phones.	Further,	if	the	police obtain	the	IMEI	code	off	of	the	burner,	then	all	SIM	links	previously attached	to	the	phone	are	discovered.	Good	for	them.	Not	for	you. You	could	even	be	outwitted	if	they	visit	the	places	they	think	you will	buy	the	prepaid	burners	-	obtain	the	IMEI	numbers	in	advance	so	as to	get	a	search	warrant	to	eavesdrop	on	you.	Boom.	And	you	have	to know	that	not	all	team	members	will	dispose	of	the	phones	after	every communique. Problems,	problems.	So	what	to	do? Solution: -	Manage	two	persons	responsible	for	managing	all	phones -	Buy	phones	from	different	locations,	different	days,	different purchasers -	Swap	phones	out	at	different	intervals	from	random	locations	 cell   towers -	Issue	to	operatives	at	different	dates -	Operatives	don’t	know	when	phones	were	activated -	Retire	some	phones	unexpectedly,	some	sooner,	after	risky	ops	for example-	Each	Op	is	given	set	of	other	Op’s	numbers,	which	changes	daily 	   Disappearing	from	Social	Media Let’s	cut	right	to	the	chase.	Social	Media	did	nothing	for	me	but make	disappearing	harder.	With	every	passing	year,	Facebook	wanted more	data	on	me.	More	of	my	favorite	childhood	cereals	 Chocolate Frosted	Sugar	Bombs,	I	told	them	-	the	favorite	of	Calvin	and	Hobbes . More	of	which	movies	made	me	cry.	Which	made	me	angry.	Which	made me	cringe	 the	skeleton	reveal	in	Psycho . Employers	love	this	about	social	media.	They	love	that	they	can google	your	name	and	find	all	kinds	of	dirt	on	you	from	Ars	Technica posts	to	Usenet	flame	wars	you’ve	participated	in	over	the	years.	Once upon	a	time,	Usenet	was	sacred.	You	didn’t	talk	about	Usenet.	Now	it’s monitored	by	Chinese	law	enforcement.	Yet	things	I	wrote	ten	years	back are	visible	to	anyone.	My	inner	child	mutant	came	storming	out,	fists clenched,	teeth	gritted	and	spitting	insults	before	the	troll	meme	became fashionable. While	we	can’t	exactly	take	a	Delorean	back	to	1985	and	start nuking	old	newsgroup	posts,	what	you	can	do	is	take	a	flamethrower	to the	media	giants	who	aren’t	doing	your	career	any	favors	by	allowing your	ex	to	post	photos	of	you	so	drunk	in	the	French	Quarter	that	you performed	mouth	to	mouth	on	a	fainted	carriage	mule	who	you	could swear	winked	at	you	as	it	went	down. 	Phase	1:	Nuking	the	Sites	From	Orbit I	nuked	my	own	Facebook	account	in	May	of	2010.	Little	did	I	know however	that	it	wasn’t	truly	gone.	Instead,	it	went	into	a	kind	of hibernation	state.	Surprise,	surprise.	Facebook,	like	Google	and	LinkedIn and	Twitter	and	YouTube	all	have	this	egregious	habit	of	what	I	call vampire	hoodwinking.	They	lull	you	into	thinking	your	account	is	gone, when	it	really	isn’t.	Nothing	is	really	permanently	gone	with	any	of	those behemoths.	Not	Google,	Facebook	or	even	LinkedIn.	It’d	take	the	fires	of Mt.	Doom	to	do	to	your	account	what	it	did	to	Frodo’s	ring. But	let’s	try	anyway.   	Facebook Use	this	link	to	delete	your	account. https:  www.facebook.com help delete_account This	isn’t	like	tossing	out	a	batch	of	brownies	when	you’re	on	a	new diet.	This	effect	is	 supposedly 	permanent.	You’re	not	going	to	get	it back.	You	can’t	salvage	anything	for	a	new	account.	So	contact	lists, favorites,	bookmarks,	posts,	pictures	are	all	gone	unless	you	saved	them locally	to	your	hard	drive	or	dropbox.	Now	might	be	a	good	time	to	ask for	some	awkward	pics	to	be	taken	down. 	Twitter Follow	this	to	deactivate	your	Twitter	account. https:  twitter.com settings account Like	Facebook,	once	it’s	gone,	it’s	GONE.	But	the	process	takes	time. When	I	deleted	one	of	my	pen	names,	a	horror	pen	that	wasn’t	selling,	it took	seven	days	and	a	full	moon.	I	never	was	good	at	writing	omens. 	Google+ For	Google,	go	to	the	homepage	to	deactivate. https:  accounts.google.com Login This	will	nuke	your	Gmail	and	Youtube	accounts	as	well	since	they tie	everything	together,	but	you	can	be	more	selective	in	what	you	wish to	leave.	They	call	it	“Downgrading,”	but	know	that	your	identity	might still	pop	up	in	search	engines. I	have	personally	found	AccountKiller	to	be	of	high	value	here,	as there	were	some	accounts	still	active	that	I	hadn’t	used	in	years,	but	a few	that	had	stored	my	present	phone	number	and	address	publicly. Enhancements,	they	claim. 	   Phase	2:	Nuking	Criminal	and	Public	Records Now	we	come	to	the	area	where	Skip	Tracers	love	to	dig,	and	dig DEEP.	We’re	talking	Gimli’s	drunken	dwarf	king	deep	who	loves	to	delve in	places	he	shouldn’t	 how’d	that	turn	out	for	him? . Without	any	background	information,	they	will	be	chasing	ghosts and	wild	geese	to	who	knows	where.	Bad	for	them.	Good	for	us.	We’ll nuke	what	remnants	of	our	social	selves	are	ripe	for	the	taking	-which	in the	end	only	hurt	us,	after	all.	As	we	go	through	these,	realize	this	is	a very	short	list	and	if	there	is	one	thing	I	love	about	Reddit,	it’s	that	they don’t	believe	in	short	lists. Here’s	the	major	players. Spokeo	-	This	is	the	big	one.	The	one	every	Skip	Tracer	and	collector uses	by	default.	The	amount	of	data	they	had	on	me	made	me	want	to retch	my	In	n’	Out	burger!	Former	email	addresses.	Relationships. Marriages.	Schools.	For	a	few	dollars	more	they’d	probably	tell	a collector	if	I	put	ketchup	on	my	fries	or	on	the	side.	The	kind	of	guys Agent	Smith	might	call	up	to	find	where	Neo	was	hiding. Intelius	-	I	was	in	this	database	too,	but	not	for	any	criminal	activity  whew! .	Like	Spokeo,	they	keep	a	lot	of	data	on	people	without	their consent.	Not	Agent	Smith’s	first	choice,	but	if	Spokeo	is	down…	it	is.	They trawl	social	media	sites	as	well	as	keep	criminal	data.	Rumor	has	it   mugshots	are	on	the	way.	Are	Christmas	morning	pictures	next? Zabasearch	-	I	used	this	one	once	to	find	an	old	phone	number	I’d forgotten	and	didn’t	want	to	call	up	every	friend	to	relay	the	new	one. Later	I	found	that	this	is	the	site	to	use	if	you’re	a	stalker	since,	after	June 2014,	emails	containing	personal	info	 not	searchable	by	search	engines  became	publicly	available.	Ouch. Going	through	every	site	that	I’d	given	my	data	to	over	the	last	ten years	was	like	trying	to	defect	from	a	vampire	clan.	Easier	said	than done.	They	want	something	signed	in	blood.	The	worst	however	was hitting	 paywalls	and	 upsells.	You	know,	people	who	claim	to	save	you money	and	time. One	site	did	seem	to	help	shorten	time	taken	to	erase	myself	from the	internet.	That	site	is	DeleteMe.	At	$129	bucks,	it	ain’t	cheap.	But	if you’re	strapped	for	time	and	don’t	mind	the	fee	then	it	can	be	worth	your while.	Staying	Off	The	Radar For	the	next	two	years	you	must	be	consistent	with	updates.	Check those	sites	every	few	months	for	your	compliance.	Google	your	name. Your	old	phone	numbers.	Old	addresses.	Old	flames.	Your	identity	after all	is	more	valuable	to	you	than	it	is	to	them.	To	them,	you’re	simply	a number	in	a	database,	and	if	they	had	their	way,	wouldn’t	mind	too terribly	the	thought	of	tattooing	a	number	on	the	back	of	your	neck. From	the	moment	of	Armageddon,	I’ve	used	Fake	Name	Generator for	many	things	I	do	online.	You	can	too.	Yes,	it	does	sound	like	some two-bit	app	on	the	Google	Play	Store	that	Babu	wrote	in	Bombay	one summer’s	day,	but	I	assure	you	it	isn’t.	It’s	quite	effective. If	you	want	free,	DISPOSABLE	mail,	try	Mailinator.	No	signup required.	No	passwords.   Mobile	Apps  Mobile	phones	and	tablets	that	use	WiFi	are	devious	at	hoarding every	private	detail	of	your	life.	Though	it’s	nearly	impossible	to completely	go	off-grid	with	an	online	smart	phone	used	for	business,	let’s look	at	some	options. First	up,	there’s	Tor	Browser Bet	you	never	knew	this	was	available	for	Android.	This	app connects	to	the	anonymous	Tor	network.	Probably	overkill	for	what	we wish	to	do	with	social	media,	but	helpful	for	anonymity	nuts	like	me	who like	the	ghost	in	the	machine	lifestyle.	It	spoofs	the	IP	address	you	use and	allows	you	to	mask	your	own	hardware. Next,	there’s	Spideroak.  If	you	like	cloud-storage	and	privacy,	check	out	Spideroak.	It	offers “zero-knowledge”	security	and	has	end-to-end	encryption.	The	free	plan gives	you	2GB	of	storage.	It’s	$10	otherwise	for	100GB	extra	and	goes	up from	there.   Next	up	is	Red	Phone.	I	like	this	app	for	it’s	ease	of	use	whenever	I’m in	the	USA.	It	secures	every	call	with	end-to-end	encryption,	allowing	you privacy	and	peace	of	mind.	As	well	it	uses	WiFi	and	offers	neat	upgrades if	both	callers	have	RedPhone	installed. It’s	not	perfect,	though,	but	at	least	it’s	not	as	expensive	as	say, TrustCall.	There	are	convenience	issues	like	lengthy	connection	times and	dropped	calls	 ever	Skype	someone	from	Manila? 	so	it’s	not	going	to be	as	quick	and	easy	as	Jason	Bourne	does	it	in	foreign	locations. But	the	pluses	outweigh	the	minuses.	I	especially	love	the	two-word passphrase	as	a	security	feature:	If	you	fear	Agent	Boris	is	dead	and	has been	killed	by	Agent	Doris	 who	now	has	his	phone ,	you	can	request	she speak	the	second	passphrase.	Simple,	yet	effective. Lookout	-	Lookout	Security	gives	you	the	best	protection	against theft.	Phone	lost?	You	can	login	to	the	site	at	lookout.com	to	locate	where a	thief	has	taken	your	pone.	Data	backup	is	also	a	nice	addition. CryptoCat	-	Banned	in	Iran,	Cryptocat	is	an	open-source	app	that allows	encrypted	online	chat.	It	employs	end-to-end	encryption	so	that you	can	trust	your	messages	are	private.	Better	still	is	that	it	can	be	used with	Tor	to	 anonymize	your	traffic.	They	also	received	top	scoring	in   December	2014	on	Electronic	Frontier’s	security	score	benchmark	with some	stiff	competition:	ChatSecure,	TextSecure,	Silent	Phone	and	Silent Text.	Reason	being	is	that	all	messages	are	not	only	encrypted,	but	that you	can	verify	the	other	guy’s	identity	without	the	company	having access	to	it.  BullGuard	-	Bullguard	offers	anti-theft	and	backup	similar	to cryptocat	but	also	offers	SIM	protections	 auto-locks	device	if	SIM	is removed ,	Call	Management	and	Parental	Controls	 monitors	your	kids . Mobile	security	also	lets	you	remotely	manage	your	device.   Orbot	-	A	free	app	that	gives	you	anonymity	with	an	Android	device. I	use	it	for	my	Galaxy	Tab	4.	Works	well	with	Tor	and	wasn’t	hard	to configure	for	my	web	browser,	email	client	and	Maps.Me	app.  Wickr	-	An	instant	messenger	for	iOS	&	Android,	it	offers	end	to	end encrypted	 file messages	 that…	 attachments photos,	too.	PC	Magazine	named	Wickr	an	“Editors’	Choice for	Android	secure	messaging.”  self-destruct.	  Includes	   Titanium	for	PC	and	Android	-	Without	a	doubt	my	favorite	app	on my	Android	tablet	for	backups.   Stalkers For	some	reason	stalkers	tend	to	be	overwhelmingly	male	when Hollywood	spits	them	out.	I	can	count	the	number	of	female	stalker	flicks on	one	hand:	Fatal	Attraction.	Misery.	The	Crush.	Those’re	the	ones	I’ve seen.	And	they	make	the	male	ones	look	pale	by	comparison.	Stick	the knife	into	poor	Jimmy	and	laugh	in	his	face. Not	exactly	realistic,	though	since	they’re	always	a	thousand	times worse	on	the	silver	screen	than	up	close.	Most	stalkers	are	your	next- door	neighbor	types.	But	sometimes,	well…	sometimes	there’s	an exception.	An	anomaly	if	you	will	that	slices	to	bits	any	preconceived notion	of	what	a	stalker	looks	and	acts	like.	They	break	the	rules. What	follows	is	my	own	story.	It’s	one	memory	I	can’t	quite	seem	to delete	from	my	memory	banks	no	matter	how	hard	I	try.	And	lordy,	who knows	why.	Perhaps	it’s	the	dark	element…	the	unknown.	What	COULD have	happened.	What	she	could	have	done	had	I	not	taken	it	as	seriously as	I	did.	Even	now	my	fingers	hurt	from	the	constant	flexing,	cracked- knuckle	strain	I	exert	as	I	contemplate	the	telling	of	it	all. But	I’ll	leave	out	the	truly	disgusting	parts	in	case	you’ve	just	eaten lunch.	The	Bayou	Grandma	Stalker The	new	house	I’d	rented	was	as	good	as	any	I	guessed.	Way	out there,	too,	out	near	the	bayou	and	close	to	La	Place	and	juuust	outside Kenner,	Louisiana	but	far	enough	from	the	traffic	and	airport	that	it squashed	any	worries	about	jet	engines	overhead.	But	the	mosquitoes, sweet	Jesus	were	they	big.	Winged	vampires	with	probos	so	damn	big you’d	swear	you’d	been	shot	in	the	buttocks	with	a	poison	dart	like	one of	them	pigmy	tribes	make. My	father	had	rented	the	place	to	parolees	-	mostly	thieves	from what	I’d	heard.	Big	time,	small	time,	bank	robbers,	shoplifters,	pimps. Didn’t	matter	what	kind.	It’d	been	far	enough	out	of	town	so	as	to	limit temptation,	he’d	said,	but	a	couple	months	passed	with	no	takers.	Enter   yours	truly	on	a	3-month	dry	spell	in	book	sales	and	just	generally unemployable	for	eons. I	still	remember	his	words	as	he	handed	me	the	keys:	“Don’t	turn the	place	into	a	dirty	whorehouse.	Sheriff	don’t	like	that.”	“Whore? What’re	those?”	I	asked.	He	smiled	back.	That	toothless	grin	of	his	never put	me	at	ease	like	it	did	when	I	was	five,	but	now	I	knew	how	much	of	a hard	ass	he	was. I	only	paid	a	quarter	rent	in	exchange	for	repairing	the	place,	but lordy	how	I	loathed	crawling	under	the	house	to	fix	anything.	It	wasn’t the	tarantulas	I	feared.	It	was	that	dadgum	Daddy-long-leg	spiders	that spooked	me	the	most.	Mobs!	I’d	bang	out	1000	new	words	daily	 my	self- imposed	quota	at	the	time 	and	they’d	bang	out	10000	baby	spiders	as	I typed	the	last	word.	On	some	dark	nights	I	could	swear	I	heard	em popping	out	under	the	floorboards	like	popcorn	in	a	microwave. Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop. Then	things	got	louder	in	July.	Peeper	frogs	amid	every	god- forsaken	bog	noise	in	the	universe	kept	me	up.	You’d	think	I’d	have gotten	use	to	em,	but	no.	Afternoons	were	only	slightly	better.	I	made	a promise	to	keep	busy.	I’d	survey	the	property,	check	mail,	repair	pipes, try	not	to	sweat	too	much	as	it	killed	my	writing	mood,	when	one	day	I noticed	something	off. Some	of	my	mail	looked	opened.	In	fact	it	looked	read.	That	feeling, you	know?	Smudges.	Strange	scents.	Like	the	kind	church	ladies	wear	on Sunday.	Letters	were	out	of	order,	too.	Bills	were	upside	down	like someone’d	repacked	them	after	sticking	a	cherry	bomb	into	the	mailbox. Humidity.	Maybe. I	walked	down	the	lonely	road	to	meet	the	neighbor	I’d	put	off meeting.	A	neighbor	who	lived	in	a	house	that	leaned	toward	the	airport, like	the	wood	wanted	to	fly	off	and	forever	be	rid	of	this	frog-infested shithole.	Spooky	branches	prevented	this,	of	course.	“You’re	staying here,”	the	wood	seemed	to	say. Anyway	I	knocked	and	knocked.	No	answer.	Went	around	back, knocked	some	more,	ridged	my	forehead	and	looked	around	as	I	wiped away	sweat	and	scratched.	The	bog	seemed	far	quieter	here	despite	La Place	more	than	living	up	to	its	reputation	as	the	Saharan	desert	of marshes.   …scratch….scratch….scraaaaatch.  I	left	a	note,	an	invitation	for	the	neighbor	to	come	by	and	share	a beer	with	me,	the	new	guy	 or	an	iced	tea	and	a	Bigfoot	flick	if	a	lady .	A guy	could	hope,	right? After	heading	home	I	banged	out	1500	more	words	and	popped	in The	Thing	as	I	kicked	back	a	couple	of	Buds.	“Where’s	Blair?”	a	voice	said into	the	gloom.	Ah,	I’d	forgotten	the	electricity	had	cut	out	midway	the previous	Saturday.	I	ignored	the	creaky	boards	under	my	feet	and	sank into	the	couch.	Dusty	as	hell,	it	was	like	sinking	into	a	puffy	mushroom. The	kind	some	British	kids	like	to	play	soccer	with. Just	when	the	movie	got	to	the	gross	“Let’s	see	who’s	The	Thing” blood-test-by-self-inflicted-razor,	I	heard	a	noise.	I	sat	up	just	as,	once again,	the	electricity	shut	off. Shit.Then	came	a	catty	sound.	Mauling.	A	yawning	slow	kind	of	sound. What	the	hell? The	door,	I	thought.	I	crept	to	the	door	over-thinking	it	as	usual.	A cat?	Not	a	chance	-	too	slow	to	be	a	cat.	This	was	more	like	a	taunt.	A	set of	nails	being	dragged	across	a	chalkboard	to	grate	someone’s	nerves kind	of	taunt.	My	nerves. I	looked	out	the	window.	Darkness	looked	back	at	me	and	I	started flexing	my	fingers	and	cracking	my	knuckle	one-handedly.	Think rational.	Think	logically.	But	the	darkness	was	so	thick	it	seemed	stitched into	the	clothing	of	whomever	had	disturbed	me.	Intense	camouflage. Whoever	it	was	standing	out	there.	I	could	swear	I	saw	 something. Something	frozen	so	stuff	and	absolute	it	was	as	though	dark	matter	had enveloped	it.	Despite	this,	I	hated	the	thought	of	showing	fear	by	running to	get	my	revolver	in	the	bedroom.	No,	I	thought,	and	frowned	chewing on	my	bottom	lip.	I’d	face	this	punky	prankster	head	on. I	swung	the	screen	door	open	so	hard	it	flew	off	the	hinges. The	monolithic	figure	was	gone.	Not	a	soul	stood	there,	nothing	at all	but	boggy	air.	I	stepped	out	and	as	I	did	waved	the	fog	away.	Nothing, absolutely	nothing,	made	a	sound.	Not	even	peeper	frogs. A	few	days	later	I	walked	next	door	once	more,	determined	as	ever to	find	out	if	my	neighbor	knew	of	any	rascally	kids	making	mischief	in these	mossy	parts.	God	knew	they	had	nothing	better	to	do.   This	time	I	met	her:	a	sweet	old	lady	that	could	never	harm	a	fly.	She invited	me	in.	She	even	made	tea	and	biscuits.	A	British	lady	with	a midnight	cat	straight	out	of	Sleepy	Hollow.	Herself?	Liverpool	from	the sound	of	it.	Who	knew	but	what	I	did	know	was	that	she	had	a	class	and	a grace	I	couldn’t	quite	match	due	to	my	swampbilly	upbringing.	I	let	her prattle	on	and	simply	nodded	and	hmm’ed	and	smiled	rather	than	allow my	lips	to	leak	my	ignorance. French-Acadian	lineages	was	the	topic,	her	spessscialty	apparently. Not	my	cup	of	tea	but	I	listened	anyway	as	she	did	most	of	the	talking and	I	just	sat	there	like	a	bump	on	a	log	soaking	it	all	in.	And	that	she	did with	a	vengeance!	Talked	my	ear	clean	off	as	frogs	croaked	outside. Ten	minutes	into	it,	my	mind	wandered	and	I	noticed	a	faint	lisp.	I stared	at	her	wrinkled	lips	as	they	quivered	and	bounced	from	topic	to topic	and	saw	an	oddity.	No,	not	her	lips.	Her	tongue.	Her	tongue	looked cut.	A	small	one	to	be	sure,	right	at	the	tip	that	affected	her	speech.	Was	I seeing	things?	The	day	was	hot	and	hazy. A	paper	cut?	I	wondered. The	only	time	I’d	ever	done	that	myself	was	when	I	licked	an envelope	a	little	too	fast. Lightning	struck. She’d	half-assed	the	licking	of	my	envelopes	somehow.	When	this light	bulb	bloomed	in	my	head,	I	noticed	her	eyes	widen	and	her	speech crawl.	I	coulda	sworn	I	heard	her	heart	speed	up	as	a	dark	narrative began	to	unroll	in	my	thoughts.	She	knew	I	knew.	She	had	to!	It	was written	right	there	in	her	liquid-green	eyes. I	excused	myself	to	the	restroom	and	on	the	way	back	cut	through the	kitchen	and	out	of	the	corner	of	my	eye	saw	a	familiar	name	next	to	a Home	Sweet	Home	frame	with	a	few	scattered	nails.	It	was	an	open envelope	with	my	name	on	it. I	grit	my	teeth	so	hard	my	loose	tooth	almost	popped	out.	That crinkly	old	thief! I	paused	to	rub	my	chin,	my	neck,	both	my	eyes.	Maybe	I	was	just imagining	things,	I	told	myself.	Working	too	hard.	Worrying	too	much. Swamp	fever	possibly…	or	perhaps	the	mailman	simply	slipped	one	into the	wrong	box.	I’d	done	that	myself	a	few	times	working	campus	mail back	in	the	day.   But	I	just	couldn’t	stomach	the	thought	of	that	old	bat,	smart	as	she was,	scraping	through	my	mail.	Scraping	my	things.	Stabbing	my	privacy in	the	back.	Stalking	me.	And	for	what	reason?	So	I	called	her	on	it	in	as polite	a	way	as	I	could	fathom	yet	fully	expecting	a	sincere	apology,	to which	I’d	apologize	right	back. I	was	wrong. Her	face	changed	right	before	my	eyes.	I	thought	I	was	hallucinating at	first.	That	maybe	the	old	witch	had	poisoned	my	tea	with	some	dart frog	resin.	Those	sweet,	elderly	church	fingers	clenched	as	she	stared	at the	floor	coldly,	the	paleness	of	her	jaw	becoming	steely,	a	kind	of	veil	of jaundice	sliding	over	her	face.	She	seemed	to	be	turning	to	stone!	It	was	a look	I	had	never	seen	even	in	a	hardened	criminal.	A	faraway,	ancient look,	like	she’d	just	celebrated	her	2000th	birthday	and	here	I	was spoiling	her	party	by	not	outstretching	my	own	wrists.	And	when	she fixed	her	cataract	eyes	on	me,	I	nearly	bolted	for	the	door	right	then	and there.	She	noticed	this	and	said, “Well	now,	dearie.	It	seems	that	you’ve	c—” Before	she	could	finish,	I	tipped	my	old	Port	Authority	cap	and exited	before	she	could	finish.	That	was	it.	I	was	outta	there, permanently. Later	when	I	asked	my	father	to	look	into	her	past,	it	turned	out	she was	anything	but	the	nice,	country	granny	I’d	believed.	She’d	done	time for	murder,	theft	and	chronic	shoplifting.	Oh,	and	slapping	a	judge	as	he sat	in	Preservation	Hall	just	inside	the	French	Quarter.	Just	walked	right up	to	him.	Brilliant.	This	on	top	of	the	sweet,	sugar-coated	lies	she	told me,	smiling	like	a	Cheshire	cat	right	into	my	face. I	was	forced	to	move	three	days	later	due	to	further	circus-monkey antics.The	old	crone	stole	my	mail	as	though	each	and	every	one	of	them were	sealed	with	liquid	gold. But	there	was	more.	She	broke	into	my	house	while	I	vacationed way	up	in	Thunder	Bay,	Ontario.	I’d	set	up	a	hidden	cam	to	silence	my naysaying	father	hoping	to	catch	her	in	the	act	and	send	her	to	the	Big House	once	again	with	all	the	other	harpies.	Only	I	failed. She’d	spent	hours	simply	rocking	back	and	forth	in	my	living	room with	her	black	cat	 who	kindly	relieved	himself	behind	my	couch .	My   *  father	laughed.	Pointed,	and	laughed.	But	I	was	determined.	I	did	some more	digging. It	turned	out	she	had	a	son	that	died	a	year	prior	running	from police	after	a	robbery.	A	son	with	a	history	of	crime	with	a	face remarkably	like	mine.	I	could	sense	some	residue	of	reason	behind	her madness.Only	now	I	cannot	watch	John	Carpenter’s	The	Thing	without smelling	that	darn	cat. So	what	did	I	learn	from	this?	What	can	you	learn? I	learned	that	stalkers	come	in	all	sizes	and	flavors	of	the	rainbow and	in	all	likelihood,	will	not	be	a	stranger	to	you.	You	will	know	this person	personally.	They	may	even	be	in	a	relationship	with	you. Celebrities	have	the	cash	to	deal	with	them:	Catherine	Zeta-Hones	and Dave	Letterman	come	to	mind.	Guys	like	you	and	me	must	use	our	wits since	we’re	not	winning	the	lottery	anytime	soon. The	Hitchhiker In	the	1990s	I	picked	up	a	hitchhiker	on	my	way	from	New	Orleans to	a	local	Mississippi	college	to	inquire	about	teaching	for	a	semester.	It was	a	long	ride.	My	radio	was	broken.	I	could	use	some	nice conversation,	I	thought.	Besides	that,	he	looked	like	a	clean-cut,	Leave-It- To-Beaver	type.	You’ve	seen	them:	Sharp	dresser.	Smooth	talker.	Great big	smile	with	a	perfect	row	of	teeth.	The	perfect	guy	to	sell	a	Porsche	to someone	with	eight	of	them	already.	The	kind	of	guy	you’d	trust	with your	daughter	in	your	weekend	cabin	for	the	weekend	but	who’d	later break	her	heart	in	half,	lickety-split.	When	he	got	into	the	car,	he	smelled like	Georgio	cologne	and	cigarettes. Well	we	got	to	talking	about	everything	under	the	sun.	Politics.	The weather.	The	cool	new	age	music	on	the	Weather	Channel	that	he	wanted   to	badly	to	identify	 Pat	Metheny,	I	said .	We	even	talked	about Mississippi	girls	compared	to	Canadian	girls	-	a	world	of	difference, actually.	I	asked	him	what	he	was	studying.	His	reply? “I	want	to	be	a	sorcerer	just	like	my	daddy.” I	nearly	hit	a	fire	hydrant	just	as	a	dog	was	doing	his	business.	By god,	I	had	a	male	wiccan	in	my	car	dressed	like	Bill	Gates. Before	I	could	laugh	at	this	obvious	joke	he	was	playing	on	me,	he proceeded	to	lay	out	his	whole	philosophy	of	life,	real	slow	and methodical	like,	waving	his	fingers	around	like	a	magician.	I	began	to	ask him	questions	about	this	so-called	“career.”	As	it	turned	out,	I	had	to	give him	personal	info	about	me	for	every	question	I	asked.	Sort	of	like bartering	for	dummies.	A	power	thing	to	him.	Personal	validation	was everything,	 as	 was	 his	 image.	I	went	along	with	it	just	as	my	hands became	sweat-filled	on	the	steering	wheel	and	by	the	time	I	dropped	him off	at	his	destination,	I	said	a	little	prayer	of	thanks	to	the	Almighty	that the	guy	never	pulled	a	gun	on	me. Would	he	have?	I	dunno,	maybe.	Maybe	not. Bottom	line?	Appearances	are	deceptive.	That	includes:	Scents. Visuals.	Touch.	Audio.	Strangers	can	get	into	your	head	and	stay	there unless	you	say	one	word	at	the	outset: “NO.” Say	no	to	clinginess	and	control-freaks	who’d	rather	you	hang	out with	them	then	visit	your	dying	mother	in	the	retirement	home. Now,	I	was	beyond	polite	with	him.	A	lot	of	guys	I	know	in Mississippi	wouldn’t.	They’d	boot	his	butt	right	out	as	soon	as	he	prattled on	about	his	plans	to	conquer	the	world	with	“Dark	Energy.”	But	if	you do	THAT,	you’re	gonna	risk	trouble.	Be	firm,	but	polite.	Don’t	say,	“Get the	hell	outta	my	truck,	Bozo,	before	I	pump	yer	gut	fulla	lead!” Say,	“That’s	interesting,”	which	I	did,	to	which	his	reply	was:	“So	do you	accept	my	philosophy,	brother?”  he	called	me	brother	the	entire	trip	and	it	always	coincided	with him	touching	my	knee  I	feigned	ignorance,	explaining	I	needed	him	to	tell	me	more… more…	more…	all	the	way	to	the	college.	It	worked.	But	he	did	demand my	phone	number	and	address	at	the	end.	Fake,	of	course. Violence	ensues	if	you	take	the	wrong	road,	and	that	certainly	might   have	happened	if	I’d	brought	his	whole	self-image	crumbling	to	the ground.	Leave	the	“tough-love”	talk	for	someone	else.	A	judge,	maybe.   Disappearing	Difficulties You	might	be	wondering	what	it	truly	takes	to	do	a	Houdini-style disappearing	act.	The	answer	is	this:	it	depends	on	how	invisible	you want	to	be.	There	are	different	levels	to	it	that	require	different	mindsets and	experience.	You	might	be	invisible	one	day	but	goof	the	next,	and now	people	can	see	a	sliver	of	an	outline	as	you	walk	down	the	street. They	may	come	closer	to	investigate	since	invisibility	is	a	power	few people	wield	effectively.	Power	draws	attention.	Most	people	want	that attention,	if	they	aren’t	running	like	you	are. Another	thing	it	takes,	is	balls.	Fortitude	and	courage	too,	but	mostly balls	because	you’re	not	only	evading	a	stalker	but	his	family	too	since	he can	call	any	one	of	them	at	any	time	to	aid	in	the	pursuit.	That’s	what	law enforcement	does	with	prison	escapees	-	they	call	for	help	 unless they’re	New	Yorkers	in	which	case	they	like	to	solve	the	case	all	by themselves	and	take	all	the	credit	-	kinda	like	Patton . Anyway,	stalkers	take	all	kinds	of	forms.	Even	Stalin	was	a	stalker, lurking	in	the	shadows	and	waiting	to	pounce	and	rip	out	the	heart	of anyone	rebuking	him	for	slitting	throats	on	the	way	to	the	top. So	let’s	say	you	are	on	the	run	from	someone	who	wants	to	take your	life.	Someone	far	less	powerful	than	Stalin	was.	Someone	you thought	was	Mr.	or	Ms.	Romantic,	before	they	turned	to	the	Dark	Side. The	short	of	it	is	that	you	must	have	a	battle	plan	IN	PLACE	long	before you	run.	Turning	invisible	is	the	easy	part.	Staying	invisible	is	the	hard part.Actually	now	that	I	think	about	it,	let’s	up	the	threat	a	little	bit. Forget	romance	stalkers.	Let’s	say	you’re	on	the	run	from	the	authorities. If	you	can	master	that,	you	can	master	anything	else	since	it	becomes	a hundred	times	harder	if	you	now	have	not	one,	but	 dozens	of	stalkers who	are	trained	to	find	people	on	the	run.	They	don’t	master	pathfinding  “The	quicker	we	clean	up	this	goddamned	mess,	the	quicker	we	can take	a	little	jaunt	against	the	purple	pissing	Japs	and	clean	out	their	nest, too…	before	the	goddamned	Marines	get	all	of	the	credit!”   and	detective	work	in	any	federal	training	program,	by	the	way,	not	even in	the	ATF	which	has	one	of	the	longest	programs	for	agents.	They master	it	by	doing	it	for	years	and	years	and	learning	from	not	only	their own	mistakes,	but	their	comrades	in	other	State	departments	and Federal	agencies	with	which	they	share	strategies	of	capturing	prey. It’s	not	all	gloomy,	however.	Knowing	what	the	authorities	greatest strengths	and	weaknesses	are	can	help	immensely	since	many	get	cocky and	overconfident	after	years	of	success.	Can	they	monitor	every	train station?	Bus	depots?	Can	they	shut	them	down	with	a	court	order	on	the fly?	A	few	can	post-9 11.	How	about	gas	stations	-	how	many	have cameras?	Which	ones	don’t?	Underground	tunnels	-	can	they	seal	you tight	by	closing	off	both	ends?	You	must	know	all	of	this	before	running. And	forget	about	using	even	a	small	airport	to	jet	away. 	IDThe	other	pain	the	neck	is	your	identity.	There’s	a	world	of difference	between	showing	a	fake	ID	to	a	bank	to	open	an	account	and one	that	will	get	you	past	airport	security.	So	you’ll	need	a	fake	passport which	is	expensive	 more	than	a	grand	in	most	cities,	and	you	have	to know	whom	to	contact . Do	you	plan	on	hoofing	it	by	foot	or	hitchhiking?	This	brings	a	whole new	level	of	risk	since	you’ll	stick	out	even	more	than	you’re	already sticking	out.	A	stick	in	the	mud	with	one	of	those	twirly	caps. Think	about	it.	How	many	hitchhikers	did	you	see	last	week?	If	you live	near	Yosemite	or	the	Appalachian	trailer,	I’ll	grant	maybe	thirty	or so.	Anywhere	else,	not	so	many.	Better	to	rent	a	car,	but	you	should	be picky	about	it	and	find	a	rental	outlet	that	accepts	cash	deposits.	Know that	whatever	identification	you	use	will	be	used	to	run	a	credit	check. More	risk. Sanctuary Go	someplace	where	American	tourists expats	are	few	and	far between.	You	need	not	go	to	Yemen,	but	consider	South	America	which	is filled	with	nice	little	getaways	to	let	the	heat	simmer	down.	Mexico	is	a bit	too	close	for	comfort	 though	Yucatan	is	a	nice	spot .	Many	go	to Venezuela,	but	you	don’t	want	to	stay	there	forever.	Can	your	parents visit	you?	Should	they,	if	the	evil	wizard	Foozle	is	watching	them	like   you	can	only	beat	the	dog.”  hawks?Funds You	run	out	of	money	quickly	being	on	the	run.	So	you	needs	lots	of it.	Enough	to	bankroll	your	hotels	as	well	as	gasoline	for	travel	and,	let’s face	it,	you	don’t	want	to	eat	Thai	food	24 7 365	days	a	year.	I’d	say	save at	least	five	years	worth	as	this	will	buy	more	than	you	can	imagine.	This brings	up	our	next	topic:	Friends. 	Friends There’s	a	saying	in	Hong	Kong	about	money:	“When	money	is	stolen Put	another	way,	if	you	have	money	-	you	have	 friends.	It’s	rather Nietzschian	to	my	aged	eyes	but	it	is	what	it	is.	Sad	fact	of	life,	isn’t	it? About	as	anti-virtue	as	you	can	get.	Money	indeed	does	buy	friends.	And those	same	friends	can	help	you	out	in	a	jam	and	believe	me	that	jam	will come	sooner	or	later.	The	difference	could	be	whether	you	sleep	in	a house	or	sleep	in	a	cell	with	mice	running	over	your	ankles	at	night	next to	Soapy	the	Bum. There	is	a	lot	to	be	said	about	humility	and	shunning	the	love	of money,	but	when	all	is	said	and	done	the	Almighty	might	not	help	you out	in	this	regard	if	you	don’t	prepare	for	winter.	So	get	it	then,	don’t procrastinate.	Save!	Again,	you	need	five	years	worth	if	for	no	other reason	than	to	sleep	at	night	with	peace	of	mind.	Worries	that	stack	tend to	cloud	judgment	and	contribute	to	mistakes	we	wouldn’t	otherwise have	had	made	if	we	had	green	in	the	bank.	You’ll	also	need	it	to	buy intel,	but	careful	about	buying	intelligence	on	your	enemies	since	merely looking	can	tip	them	off	if	the	guy	you	hired	is	sloppy.   Securing	Your	Computer When	I	relayed	to	my	grandmother	last	Christmas	that	I	write	books on	anonymity	and	how	to	become	invisible,	she	nearly	gagged	on	her macadamia	nut	cookie.	I	got	dead	air.	I	thought	maybe	I’d	given	her	a heart	attack.	Then	came	the	lecture.	I	was	going	to	get	arrested	by	the FBI	and	every	other	alphabet	agency.	I’d	be	waterboarded.	Chipped. Brainwashed.	I’d	be	the	next	Edward	Snowden	 though	I’m	not	nearly	as handsome . People,	old	people	especially,	tend	to	group	the	word	anonymity under	a	pretty	big	umbrella	that	includes	hackers,	spies	and	contract killers.	If	you’ve	got	an	encrypted	hard	drive,	then	you’ve	got	something to	hide,	perhaps	the	location	to	where	you	buried	Jimmy	Hoffa. “Encryption?”	she	asked,	“I	hope	you’re	not	hanging	around	one	of those	Goodfella	guys.	Besides,	isn’t	that	illegal,	dearie?	Hm?” “Not	on	your	life,	and	thank	heavens	for	small	miracles.	But	I	can	tell you	this:	”	I	reassured,	“Even	if	it	were,	I’d	 still	teach	people	how	to secure	their	data	somehow.	Keep	it	away	from	snoops.” “But	we’re	all	snoops,	dear.” “True,	but	some	are	more	snoopy	than	others.” “But	dearest,	I	don’t	want	you	getting	into	trouble	with	the government.	They’re	are	friend	y’know	and	they	know	best	 a	silent groan	from	me	at	this	point .” As	we’ve	mentioned	before,	the	last	thing	you	want	is	for	a	stalker	to grab	your	laptop	while	you’re	in	the	restroom	in	a	public	place.	This happened	to	me	on	a	cold,	foggy	morning	at	Wendy’s	close	to	the	New Orleans	French	Quarter.	Patrons	were	few	and	pigeons	were	still perched	on	the	wires	as	early	as	it	was.	Seemed	safe	enough.	No	harm	in just	leaving	my	laptop	running	since	all	I’d	intended	was	to	get	in	and	out of	the	john,	right?	My	bookbag	as	well	was	right	beside	it.	You	know	what happened	next. Next	thing	I	saw	when	I	walked	out	of	the	restroom	was	a	ten	year old	black	kid	in	grey	sweatpants	gunning	it	for	the	streetcar	that	went   round	to	the	projects;	the	worst	place	to	chase	a	thief	with	a	car. But	I	was	determined	to	get	back,	1. 	my	laptop	and	2. 	my	bookbag that	contained	the	new	shrinkwrapped	Elder	Scrolls	game	I’d	bought from	Babbages.	Later	I	recalled	being	more	concerned	with	the	game, such	were	my	hobbled	priorities. So	I	used	my	feet	and	dashed	like	the	wind,	chasing	him	down	Canal St.	all	the	way	to	St.	Charles	Ave.	When	I	finally	caught	up	with	him,	the kid	swung	and	slipped	from	my	grasp	like	one	of	those	kids	in	the Philippines	who	can	shimmy	up	a	palm	tree	in	3	seconds	flat	to	avoid	a big	cat’s	teeth.	Thankfully	I	was	the	faster	one,	at	least	horizontally.	He ended	up	dropping	it.	My	laptop	shattered	as	it	hit	the	concrete.	My	grip tightened	like	a	vice	around	his	arm.	He	snapped	at	me	like	I	was	in	the wrong.“Get	the	hell	offa	me	‘fore	I	bust	yer	face!” He	got	off	lucky,	as	did	I.	As	he	ran	down	the	street	flipping	me	off,	I realized	that	if	he’d	been	a	stalker,	an	ex-flame,	and	if	my	laptop	had been	unencrypted	I’d	have	been	toast.	He’d	have	access	to:	-	My	credit cards	-	Login	passwords	for	every	tech	forum	under	the	sun	-	Emails	- Amazon,	eBay,	Google+,	Facebook,	etc. The	same	can	happen	to	you.	Worse	case	scenario:	he	steals	your laptop	then	leaves	it	on	your	doorstep	the	next	morning	with	an anonymous	sticky	note.	Something	about	“feeling	guilty.”	Which	is	a	load of	bull	since	your	Alienware	laptop	is	now	accursed	with	a	keylogger. The	kid	wants	bank	account	access.	Greedy	access. And	that’s	just	identity	theft.	There	are	other	risks,	like	getting caught	trying	to	preserve	invisibility.	Some	people	just	like	to	stay	out	of the	spotlight	for	whatever	reason.	By	encrypting	your	laptop	you	not only	defeat	identity	thieves,	you	defeat	anyone	and	everyone	that	has	an interest	in	seeing	you	burn. 	TorI	hate	to	insert	a	bit	of	overlap	here	as	some	of	my	other	books	delve quite	deep	into	Tor	territory,	but	you	just	can’t	write	a	book	on invisibility	without	at	least	mentioning	it.	So	here	goes. Tor	hides	the	IP	address	that	websites	identify	you	with.	No	matter where	you	go	on	the	internet,	if	you’re	not	using	Tor,	you’re	being   tracked	somehow	by	someone,	somewhere.	Usually	the	big	name companies	like	Coke	and	Dell	and	Google.	The	good	news	is	that	it’s	free. As	in,	really	free.	No	upselling	at	all	as	it’s	not	a	commercial	product.	It	is the	app	for	anonymity	enthusiasts	and	beginners	alike.	So	much	so	that the	NSA	targeted	it	specifically	along	with	Truecrypt	because	they	were so	powerful.	So	powerful,	in	fact,	that	when	used	together	they	grant	you complete	invisibility	online. The	NSA	failed	to	defeat	it.	Though	that	did	not	stop	the	FBI	from taking	a	stab	at	it.	They	hacked	a	few	websites	on	the	Deep	Web	by	way of	browser	exploits	 or	NIT	-	Network	Investigative	Technique 	that manipulated	Javascript	to	reveal	IP	addresses.	Addresses	that	lead	to your	front	door.	These	exploits	that	have	been	fixed	and	it’s	important	to note	that	you	don’t	need	Javascript	for	the	internet	to	work.	Some websites,	however,	won’t	work	 porn! . Still,	after	downloading	it	from	the	Tor	homepage,	you	need	to ensure	via	the	NoScript	addon	that	Javascript	is	turned	off.	This	will break	some	websites	that	use	it	heavily	like	CNN	and	sites	with	tons	of flash	videos.	But	then	if	a	site	is	running	a	dozen	scripts	it	is	likely	those scripts	are	tracking	you	in	some	way	to	as	to	better	target	you	with	ads. 	Benefits	of	Tor 1.	Immune	to	Ad	Tracking.	What	you’ll	see	is	ads	targeted	to	some guy	in	Germany	or	Japan,	since	the	IP	will	be	that	of	a	Tor	user’s	exit relay	 Tor	users	can	volunteer	as	exit	nodes	if	they	wish,	but	it’s	not mandatory	to	use	Tor . 	2.	You	can	surf	the	Deep	Web,	aka	.onion	sites	that	are	not	reachable via	the	regular	internet.	The	downside	is	little	to	no	moderation.	If	you remember	how	‘Wild	West’	Usenet	was	back	in	the	1990s,	you’ll	have	a good	idea	of	what	it’s	like.	Freenet	is	also	like	that,	though	it	does	not connect	to	the	Deep	Web	in	the	same	way	Tor	does.	In	fact,	it’s	a	whole different	Wild	West	show,	which	we	will	go	over	shortly. 	3.	Communicate	Anonymously.	Using	Tor,	you	can	say	whatever	you want	in	a	forum	and	not	have	it	traced	back	to	the	real	You.	But	don’t expect	all	moderators	to	not	take	action	to	ban	your	account	if	you	step   over	the	line.	Yes,	I	realize	I	just	contradicted	myself	here.	Perhaps	it’s better	to	state	that	there	is	little	moderation	rather	than	no	moderation on	the	Deep	Web.	But	what	there	is,	is	moderated	by	lords	of	the	sith	in one	flavor	or	another. 	4.	Upload	to	file-sharing	sites	Anonymously.	Sites	like	those	owned by	the	former	Megaupload	founder.	If	you	need	to	get	something	to someone	without	leaving	a	trace	 even	if	the	zip	file	is	encrypted ,	such	is possible	with	Tor	as	long	as	the	website	does	not	block	it. 	TailsTails	allows	you	to	use	Tor	and	avoid	tracking	and	censorship	and	in just	about	any	location	you	could	want.	It	houses	its	own	operating system	and	is	designed	for	those	who	don’t	wish	to	use	their	main	rig	to connect	to	Tor	 though	you	still	can,	however	if	you	wish . You’ve	got	several	choices	at	your	disposal:	You	can	run	it	via	USB stick,	SD	or	even	a	DVD.	This	is	pretty	handy	as	strengthens	your resistance	to	viruses.	It’s	also	beneficial	if	you	don’t	want	your	hard	drive to	leave	remnants	of	your	browsing	session.	The	best	part	is	that	it’s	free and	based	on	Linux	 and	comes	with	chat	client,	email,	office,	and browser.	Everything	the	anonymity	enthusiast	needs	to	wear	Frodo’s cloak	online. The	downside	to	using	a	DVD	though,	is	that	you	must	burn	it	again each	time	you	update	Tails.	Not	very	convenient.	So	let’s	install	it	to	USB stick	instead. 1. 	Download	tails	installer. https:  tails.boum.org download index.en.html You	must	first	install	it	somewhere,	like	a	DVD,	and	THEN	clone	it the	USB	stick	or	SD	card. 	2. 	Click	Applications	—>	Tails	—>	Tails	install	to	begin	the installation. 	3. 	Choose	Clone	&	Install	to	install	to	SD	card	or	USB	Memory	Stick 4. 	Plug	in	your	device,	then	scan	for	the	device	in	the	Target-Device drop	down	menu.	You’ll	get	a	warning	about	it	overwriting	anything	on   the	device,	blah-blah.	Choose	yes	to	confirm	the	installation. Tails	by	itself	is	quite	a	powerful	tool	to	use	to	cloak	yourself	online. But	when	combined	with	an	air-tight	and	secure	operating	system	like Linux,	it	is	virtually	 unstoppable.	If	you	have	the	luxury	of	choosing vanilla	Tor	browser	in	Windows	or	using	Tails,	always	go	with	Tails. Windows	has	always	been	the	favorite	whipping	boy	of	the	FBI	as	well	as hackers	in	general	since	the	number	of	security	holes	far	outnumber those	in	Linux. But	Linux	doesn’t	have	nearly	the	amount	of	supported	games.	Few supported	games	=	fewer	families	using	it	=	fewer	hackers	interested	in exploiting	it	for	personal	or	financial	reasons.	Them’s	the	breaks. 	VPNs VPN	stands	for	Virtual	Private	Network.	Great	for	privacy,	lousy	for anonymity	unless	you	use	it	in	addition	to	Tor.	If	you	want	rock-solid privacy	and	anonymity	 they’re	not	the	same	thing ,	then	double-wrap. When	I	signed	up	for	my	first	VPN,	I	was	surprised	how	easy	it	was. Almost	as	easy	as	signing	up	with	my	Usenet	provider,	Astraweb.	Only instead	of	paying	$10 month	for	newsgroups,	you	pay	$10	for	a	private connection	that	masks	your	IP	address.	You	install	the	app	from	the service	like	CloudVPN	and	connect	through	that.	The	VPN	can	be	from any	country	but	if	you	want	subpoena-resistant	VPN	service	that approaches	anonymity,	you	better	pick	a	VPN	that	resides	in	a	country that	isn’t	known	for	cooperating	with	U.S.	authorities.	No,	not	Iran.	Think France,	China	or	Venezuela.	It’s	not	100%	subpoena-proof,	but	luck favors	the	prepared. 	Freenet The	Big	Brother	of	Tor,	Freenet	doesn’t	really	hide	your	IP	address. It	hides	what	you’re	downloading	with	your	IP	address.	Say	you	want	to download	a	blu-ray	movie	 not	many	of	those	on	Freenet,	but	let’s	say	for argument	that	you	had	one	you	wanted	to	share .	You’d	install	Freenet. Then	the	Frost	frontend	addon	 discussed	below .	Then	you’d	click	the upload	button	which	would	give	you	the	Chk	address	you	need	to	share	it with	others.	Then	you’d	paste	said	Chk	address	to	one	of	the	hundreds	of Freenet	groups	available.   	Benefits	of	Using	Freenet Chat	anonymously.	Freenet	is	known	for	it’s	“Darknet”	functions that	allow	complete	anonymous	communication	between	two	people	or even	a	group.	Upon	installtion,	you	choose	the	security	level.	Low security,	in	which	it	is	easy	for	others	 with	sufficient	resources 	to	find your	identity,	or	high	security,	in	which	you	only	connect	to	darknet peers	-	friends	you	absolutely	trust.	Your	files	are	still	encrypted	end	to end	so	that	no	one	knows	who	uploaded	or	downloaded	what. 	Download	Anonymously.	As	stated,	anything	you	downloaded, provided	you	chose	normal	security	levels	at	installation,	will	not	be viewable	by	anyone	else	because	of	the	end-to-end	encryption. 	Downsides	to	Using	Freenet 1. 	Freenet	is	SLOW.	It	is	not	nearly	as	fast	as	Bittorrent	or	eMule.	It takes	hours	to	days	to	download	files	a	gigabyte	in	size	or	higher.	Plus,	if you’ve	an	older	PC,	it	is	a	bit	on	the	resource-intensive	side	of	things, though	anything	with	an	i3	cpu	and	up	will	be	much	faster.	That’s	faster resource-wise.	Not	download	speed. 	2. 	Freenet	is	complicated.	It’s	not	that	hard	to	install	and	use.	It’s just	hard	to	find	darknet	peers	you	can	trust	if	you	want	Full	Anonymity. The	“average”	security	level	is	fine	for	most	people,	but	if	you’re	the leader	of	a	resistance	movement	in	Iran,	by	all	means	go	perfect	dark. Just	be	certain	your	darknet	peers	are	100%	trustworthy	-	a	hard	feat	in this	day	and	age	when	you’ve	never	actually	met	any	of	those	peers! 	3. 	Freenet	is	buggy.	It’s	insanely	good	at	giving	you	anonymity. Even	better	than	Tor,	many	say,	but	you	need	Java	installed	for	it	to work.	Because	of	the	sheer	complexity	of	it	all,	it’s	not	perfect.	Yes, Freenet	checks	whether	you	have	Java	on	install	but	even	then	it occasionally	spits	out	an	error	if	you	try	to	connect.	It’s	usually	wrapper- related	if	on	Windows.	If	this	happens,	keep	trying!	Even	now,	in	2015,	I get	errors	on	occasion.	I	just	ignore	them	and	keep	hitting	‘Connect’	until it	‘locks	on’.	Three	times	is	usually	enough.   it.	  	Oh	and	by	the	way,	never	give	your	Freenet	ID	to	anyone	on	Freenet. It	breaks	your	anonymity. 	Frost Freenet	on	its	own	is	unbearably	complex	to	my	old	eyes.	So	I	was elated	when	Frost	came	around.	It’s	a	good	front	end	to	make	reading groups	 and	downloading	CHK	files 	easier. Rest	assured,	there	are	far	more	groups	then	what	you	see	in	the above	image.	This	is	just	the	ones	available	after	install	-	a	few	I	cherry pick	just	to	get	things	going.	You’ll	have	to	click	the	“globe”	icon	at	the top	to	get	a	full	list,	and	it	will	take	some	time,	anywhere	from	an	hour	to a	day	to	reveal	every	single	group	available. But	 let’s	 download	 and	 install	 first,	 It’s	 available	 at: http:  jtcfrost.sourceforge.net  Extract	the	contents	into	wherever	you	want	to	run	the	application from.	If	an	encrypted	container,	then	you	need	to	have	that	encrypted container	mounted	first,	then	unzip	it	there. e.g.	Z:\Freenet\Frost	Next	create	a	shortcut	to	the	‘frost.bat’	file within.	I	like	to	then	drag	the	shortcut	to	my	accessories	menu	in Windows.	Then	I	disable	the	annoying	splash	screen	within	the	Frost options	screen. After	that	Frost	will	ask	you	for	an	identity	nic,	something	you	can use	to	post	messages.	This	has	nothing	to	do	with	your	IP	address,	so	fear not.	It’s	just	a	nickname	like	you’d	use	for	a	Usenet	posting	in	a discussion	group. 	Options What	I	do	is	go	into	the	News2	section	in	the	options	page	and	check to	see	if	“Hide	Messages	with	Trust	States”	has	“Bad”	checked.	Then	I look	at	the	other	option:	“Don’t	add	boards	to	known	boards	list	from users	with	trust	states”…	I	check	off	Check,	Bad,	Observe	and	None  unsigned 	so	that	I	don’t	end	up	with	boards	I	don’t	want	in	the	known boards	list.	Easy,	peasy. Now	then.	Look	in	the	News1	section	and	set	the	“number	of	days	to display.”	If	you	want	to	see	what	you	missed	for	the	last	few	months,   adjust	this	number	accordingly,	to	say	300	or	however	far	back	you	want to	download.	This	is	wholly	different	than	Usenet,	where	a	group	will	go as	far	back	as	five	years	automatically. 	Trust You	can	control	what	Frost	displays	and	what	it	does	not.	Believe me,	this	is	a	godsend	when	you	want	to	ignore	or	vet	certain	users.	This is	done	by	way	of	the	trust	settings	coded	into	Frost	itself. The	options	are:	Trust,	Observe,	Check,	or	Bad.	If	you	mark	a	user	to “Trust,”	then	that	person	can	send	you	encrypted	messages	and	vice- versa	in	addition	to	providing	missing	blocks	of	data	you	might	happen to	need	that	this	person	has.	The	Observe	and	Check	options	are	simple: Observe	means	that	I	will	observe	that	person’s	behavior	until	I	can make	up	my	mind	on	whether	to	trust	him	or	not.	Check	is	the	normal state	of	trust,	meaning	no	decision’s	been	made	on	their	trust	state. Setting	a	user’s	trust	to	BAD	will	nuke	any	posts	that	person	makes on	any	Frost	board.	That	doesn’t	mean	it’s	nuked	from	Freenet,	as	there is	no	censorship.	It’s	still	there,	just	invisible	to	my	own	eyes.	I	simply won’t	see	his	racist	rants	 of	which	there	are	many	on	Freenet . Now	then.	It	could	be	that	we’ve	had	conversations	on	Freenet	that we	don’t	want	the	wife	to	know	about,	or	the	police.	I	spoke	with	an attorney	on	here	once	and	I	remember	thinking	that	if	ever	the	police were	privy	to	what	went	on	in	that	conversation,	the	jig	was	up.	And	over a	lousy	ticket!	They’d	know	my	defense	before	I	could	even	mount	it. Well.	Speaking	of	mounting,	that’s	something	we	need	to	implement: We	need	to	encrypt	our	operating	system,	or	at	least	at	a	minimum,	our conversation	and	preferably	our	Freenet	and	Frost	installation.	We	do this	by	way	of	encrypted	containers.	If	we’re	trying	to	disappear	and	we need	to	cross	the	border	for	example,	what	we	don’t	want	happening	is Mr.	Groucho	the	Canadian	Border	Guard	getting	angry	about	wanting	to see	what	we	were	talking	about	in	that	darknet	room.	Loose	lips	and	all. I’ve	been	back	and	forth	across	the	Canadian	border	more	times than	I	can	count	and	if	there	is	one	thing	I’ve	learned,	it’s	that	the personality	of	border	guards	are	notoriously	inconsistent	across	the board.	 On	 Monday	 you’ll	 get	 someone	 with	 the	 personality	 of SuperGrover.	That	smiley	guy	could	be	asked	to	wear	a	red	cape	and	he’d   salute	his	supervisors	and	thank	them	for	the	great	idea.	Then	on Tuesday	you’ll	get	the	border	guard	no	one	likes	to	get:	a	cross	between Animal	and	those	two	grumpy	old	farts	in	the	nosebleed	seats	of	the Muppet	Show.	He’s	the	kid	who	was	scarred	for	life	when	his	mint	ice cream	cone	fell	over	at	Disneyland.	And	now	he	takes	that	trauma	out	on you!So	with	that	horrid	image	out	of	the	way,	let’s	discuss	encrypted containers. 	Counter-Forensics Encrypted	containers	are	easy	to	store	files	in.	What	isn’t	so	easy	is learning	the	application	that	enables	it.	But	fear	not.	Truecrypt	took	me but	a	mere	weekend	to	figure	out	and	when	I	did,	I	kicked	myself	for	not installing	it	sooner.	My	earliest	thought	was	that	one	needed	to	be	an advanced	coder	of	some	sort	to	use	it.	Maybe	one	of	those	so-called	NSA superhackers	we	hear	so	much	about.	I	was	so	wrong. If	you	can	install	Windows,	you	can	install	Truecrypt.	Or	Veracrypt or	Drivecrypt	or	Diskcryptor	or	any	variation	thereof.	They	all	encrypt your	files	but	have	different	ways	of	doing	it,	and	many,	many	apps	are available	as	you	will	see.	But	let’s	go	with	the	free	ones	first:	Truecrypt and	Veracrypt,	two	excellent	choices	for	us	that	give	a	lot	of	bang	for	less than	a	buck. Truecrypt	is	first	up	since	the	GUI	of	Veracrypt	is	practically	the same	as	it’s	digital	brother. “Hold	on	a	second,”	you	say.	“Isn’t	the	NSA	involved	in	undermining Truecrypt?” Yes	and	no.	It’s	true	from	NSA	slides	leaked	that	we	can	see Truecrypt	and	Tor	were	in	their	crosshairs	for	a	long	time,	but	then	so	is everything	else	that’s	tough	to	crack. Here’s	what	Veracrypt	developers	had	to	say	about	it.	You	can interpret	it	however	you	wish. “I	am	sure	the	people	involved	in	TrueCrypt	couldn’t	have	stayed anonymous	and	the	security	agencies	knew	who	they	were,”	he	said.	“But when	you	look	at	the	code,	you	get	the	idea	that	these	people	must	have been	in	their	40s	back	in	1995.	So	now	they	are	in	their	60s,	and	they	are probably	tired	or	retired.”   	Truecrypt There’s	something	else	about	Truecrypt	you	might	not	have	heard. It’s	been	discontinued	as	of	2015,	but	all	the	major	encryption	apps	work similarly	and	it	is	still	secure	according	to	many	reliable	sources.	Once you	learn	how	to	use	Truecrypt,	Veracrypt	is	a	peace	of	cake.	Or	you	can go	ahead	and	start	with	Veracrypt.	Your	choice. If	you	choose	Truecrypt,	you	need	to	know	the	basics	of	creating container	files.	Once	you	do	that,	encrypting	the	OS	is	simpler.	So	let’s create	a	container	file. Download	the	app	and	install.	Create	a	container	file.	Think	of	it	as	a treasure	chest	for	which	you	will	create	a	magic	password	to	open	it. Being	magic,	you	wouldn’t	share	that	password,	right?	Right.	So	never share	that	password. Here’s	the	quick	rundown:	1.	After	installation,	ensure	you	have enough	free	space	for	your	container.	How	big	is	the	data	you’re	putting inside?	Blu-Ray	size?	Set	it	accordingly. 2.	Select	“Create	new	Volume”	from	the	drop-down	menu. 3.	Now	you’ve	two	choices:	go	the	standard	route	or	the	double- encrypted	treasure	chest	route	 Hidden	volume ,	also	called	plausible deniability.	For	a	beginner,	let’s	go	with	a	simple	file	container	since hidden	volumes	require	two	passwords	and	can	get	a	little	tricky	if	you want	to	store	files	larger	than	4	gigs	therein. 4.	You’ll	soon	get	to	a	screen	where	you	have	to	‘Select	File’.	Click	it. Browse	to	where	you	want	to	store	this	encrypted	container	soon	to	be full	of	treasure.	Don’t	click	on	any	files	yet.	Just	type	in	a	name	in	the filename	box	and	choose	Save—	We’ll	add	our	treasure	later. 5.	Choose	AES	for	an	encryption	algorithm.	Either	is	fine	but	AES	has never	failed	to	foil	an	attacker	as	it’s	super	strong.	The	others	get	hit	with performance	penalties	on	slower	systems. 6.	Choose	the	size.	Don’t	select	a	size	too	small	if	you’re	storing	your honeymoon	HD	videos	inside. 7.	Now	comes	the	password.	The	longer	it	is,	and	more	random	with letters	and	numbers	and	symbols,	the	stronger	the	entropy	and	thus	the stronger	the	pass.	Write	it	down	if	you	must	but	never	forget	it.	There’s no	retrieving	it	if	you	do.   8.	Use	your	mouse	to	create	a	random	key,	which	changes	the	more you	move	it.	You	don’t	have	to	do	it	more	than	a	few	seconds.	The	NSA could	spend	years	and	years	trying	to	figure	out	which	direction	you moved	it	first. 9.	Now	pick	a	file	system,	but	realize	if	you’re	storing	big	files	 4gig and	up ,	you’ll	need	NTFS. 10.	You’re	done!	Now	just	click	on	the	file	you	initially	created.	Input the	pass,	and	pick	the	letter	drive	you	want	it	to	mount	to.	Then	paste	in your	videos documents treasure.	You	won’t	be	able	to	delete	this container	unless	you	 unmount	it,	which	can	be	done	on	the	Truecrypt screen. 	Passwords At	this	juncture	I	should	probably	answer	a	question	I	get	quite frequently,	which	is:	“Help	me!	I	forgot	my	password	but…	I	know	15	out of	the	20	or	so	character	string	and	in	order	so…	uh…	what	are	my chances	of	hacking	it?” The	answer	is:	Slim	to	none	unless	you	have	access	to	NSA resources,	and	even	that	is	a	long	shot	for	a	long	password.	Encrypted passwords	are	stored	as	“hash”	files.	When	you	hash	a	file,	even	if	you change	but	ONE	character	in	that	string,	the	hash	changes.	The	same	is true	of	jpegs.	Throw	a	picture	into	Gimp	and	apply	a	cool	effect	or	tweak something	small	and	voila.	It’s	changed.	Completely	different	hash	set. Same	with	encryption. 	Evil	Maid	Attack Truecrypt,	like	many	other	encryption	apps,	stores	your	encryption keys	in	memory	ram.	A	cold	boot	attack	can	possibly	siphon	this	if	the ram	is	dumped	in	the	event	of	a	raid	or	our	Jamaican	laptop	thief	gets access	to	your	running	operating	system.	If	the	former,	they	can	cart	off your	PC	 still	 running	and	freeze	the	ram	sticks	 and	dump	your	keys	- which	contain	your	password!	The	thief,	probably	not.	But	an	FBI	team with	a	black	van	parked	out	front?	You	can	bet	the	ranch	on	it.	They’re used	to	all	kinds	of	lowlifes	using	encryption.	Tax	evaders.	Counterfeit operations.	Drug	runners.	Hells	Angels	gang	members	using	PGP	to communicate	where	the	meth	lab	is.   The	takeaway	lesson	is	this:	Don’t	leave	your	computer	running with	any	encrypted	containers	mounted,	as	it	will	be	dead	simple	to	sniff your	passwords	from	your	ram.	Unless	of	course,	you	break	them	in	half -	which	in	and	of	itself	might	be	a	obstruction	of	justice	charge.	Ten	years ago	this	might	not	have	been	the	case	but	the	world	we	now	live	in	is radically	different.	It	demands	vigilance	on	the	part	of	would-be	patriots. Always	have	a	plan	B. 	Drivecrypt Drivecrypt	brings	back	a	lot	of	memories,	mostly	good.	It	was	my first	foray	into	proprietary	encryption	apps	and	seemed	to	offer	nothing but	good	things	in	those	early	days. These	days	though,	there	are	a	few	downsides	as	technology	has progressed	about	the	same	rate	as	exploits	in	the	wild.	One	is	that	it’s closed	source	and	at	over	$100,	it’s	not	cheap.	But	it’s	got	a	great	front end	and	extra	goodies	if	you	don’t	mind	paying	through	the	nose.	It wasn’t	for	me	at	the	time.	For	me	the	bigger	issue	was	if	the	NSA	greased Securstar’s	palms	enough	 or	threatened 	to	code	in	a	backdoor	for	the government.	If	you	visit	their	homepage,	you’ll	see	them	swear	up	and down	that	that’s	not	the	case.	In	the	end	you’ll	have	to	decide	for	yourself whether	or	not	they	can	be	trusted.	For	what	it’s	worth,	they’re	based	in Germany,	not	the	USA.	But	if	there	were	a	conspiracy	then	it	wouldn’t matter	which	country	they	operated	in. If	you	choose	yes,	know	that	the	demo	they	offer	does	not	offer strong	encryption	-	only	a	weak	AES	key	that	gets	upgraded	to	full strength	if	you	buy	it.	I	can’t	recommend	Drivecrypt	for	these	reasons:	1. Closed	source	2.	Pricey	3.	Bruce	Schneier,	a	respected	authority	on	all things	security,	mentioned	in	passing	after	the	Snowden	leaks	that	most commercial	applications	in	the	USA	“…probably	have	back	doors	coded into	them.”	Probably,	he	said,	which	sounds	suspiciously	like	certainly	to me.	He	probably	has	no	more	proof	of	that	than	I	do,	but	then	you	don’t need	to	see	the	code	to	know	using	closed-source	is	a	risky	endeavor after	the	NSA	 and	GCHQ 	got	caught	with	their	pants	down. 	Veracrypt Veracrypt	is	probably	your	best	bet	if	Truecrypt	has	you	worried   about	backdoors.	To	that,	even	I	have	to	admit	that	the	account	of	the strange	falling	out	by	the	development	team	had	me	worried	for	a	time. Rest	assured	Truecrypt	is	still	secure,	it’s	just	not	as	secure	as	other	apps, depending	wholly	on	what	your	security	needs	are.	Plus,	later	volumes allow	you	to	mount	Truecrypt	volumes. So	what’s	so	great	about	it?	Well,	the	developers	of	Veracrypt emulated	the	TrueCrypt	7.x	code	and	made	it	stronger	for	one	thing. Brute	forcing	is	now	much	more	difficult	because	of	the	iterations	and enhancements	added	to	it.	Whenever	you	encrypt	a	hard	drive	partition using	Truecrypt,	it	uses	1000	iterations	and	2000	for	your	containers. But	Veracrypt	uses	a	whopping	327,661	of	the	RIPEMD160	algorithm, which	keeps	your	password	and	safe	contents,	well,	safe.	For	encrypted containers?	Almost	double,	at	655,331	iterations	of	SHA-2	encryption. The	only	performance	penalty	comes	in	at	a	somewhat	slower	time	to unlock	encrypted	partitions,	a	fair	tradeoff	since	it	now	makes	it	over three	hundred	times	harder	for	a	hacker	to	crack	by	brute	force	alone. All	of	that,	plus	the	user	interface	looks	very	similar	to	Truecrypt,	so if	you’re	familiar	with	that	GUI,	there’s	not	much	of	a	learning	curve	at all. Diskcryptor	-	With	DiskCryptor	you	can	encrypt	any	disk	partitions or	even	your	main	system	partition.	Being	open-source,	it	was	intended as	a	replacement	for	Drivecrypt	Plus	Pack	 a	commercial	closed-source app 	and	PGP	full	disk	encryption.	It	supports	AES-256,	Serpent	& Twofish	algorithms	with	the	encryption	key	being	stores	in	the	first sector	of	a	volume. 	Benefits	to	using	DiskCryptor	when	I	compared	two	different systems:	-	SHA-512	hash	algorithm	in	Windows	partitions	-	Quicker	boot than	Truecrypt	or	Drivecrypt	Plus	Pack	-	No	mandatory	“Create	Rescue Disk”	like	Truecrypt	 see	workaround 	-	Compiles	easier	than	TC. 	Cons	to	Using	Truecrypt 1. 	Discontinued.	Probably	the	best	reason	to	use	Veracrypt,	though it	did	pass	a	security	audit	which	you	can	read	about	here.	DiskCryptor as	well	does	not	use	the	same	GUI	like	Truecrypt	does,	so	you’ll	have	to get	used	to	learning	a	new	one.	Not	a	problem	for	most	but	I	tend	to	be   stubborn	about	learning	new	any	new	GUI. 2. 	Limited	to	RIPEMD160	hash	algorithm	for	Windows	3. 	No support,	no	future	security	holes	fixed	4. 	A	few	motherboards  Gigabyte’s	Black	Edition	line 	don’t	like	it. UPDATE:	I	must	have	spent	a	month	trying	to	figure	out	why	the Linux-like	BIOS	of	my	Z97X-UD3H	failed	to	boot	after	I’d	input	my	TC password.	Customer	Support	laughed	as	they	knew	about	as	much	of Truecrypt	as	they	did	nuclear	waste	management	 beyond	it	looking	like green	radioactive	goo	leaking	from	a	rusty	barrel .	In	the	end	I	chalked	it up	to	a	bad	hard	drive.	THEN	a	month	later,	after	further	investigation, figured	it	due	to	having	installed	Drivecrypt	on	said	hard	drive	at	some point	in	the	past	 the	demo .	So	use	multiple	encryption	schemes	on	the same	hard	drive	with	caution. 	LibreCrypt LibreCrypt	is	open-source	disk	encryption	for	Windows	and	unlike the	above,	is	LUKS	compatible	 formerly	DoxBox .	That’s	a	big	plus	if	you like	to	dual-boot.	Even	better	is	that	it	supports	the	same	plausible deniability	that	Truecrypt	does.	It’s	listed	on	the	features	page	as “Deniable	encryption	that	protects	you	from	‘rubber	hose	cryptography’  snicker! .	If	you	don’t	know	what	that	is,	it’s	something	like	this… Other	features	include:	-	Easy	to	use,	with	a	‘wizard’	for	creating new	‘containers‘. -	Full	transparent	encryption,	containers	appear	as	removable	disks in	Windows	Explorer. -	Explorer	mode	lets	you	access	containers	when	you	don’t	have administrator	permissions. -	Compatible	with	Linux	encryption,	Cryptoloop	“losetup”,	dm-crypt, and	LUKS.	Linux	shell	scripts	support	deniable	encryption	on	Linux. -	Supports	smartcards	and	security	tokens. -	Encrypted	containers	can	be	a	file,	a	partition,	or	a	whole	disk. -	Opens	legacy	volumes	created	with	FreeOTFE     Laptops  Border	Officers	and	Encrypted Bringing	any	kind	of	guns	or	even	knives	across	the	Canadian border	is	a	serious	offense	-	at	both	ends.	Marines	have	been	arrested	in Mexico	with	shotguns	in	the	back	of	their	pickup	trucks	and	northward, cops	have	been	arrested	 yes,	cops! 	for	failing	to	check	in	handguns. Ever	since	Marc	Lepine	shot	up	a	school	in	Montreal	way	back	in	1989 over	what	he	perceived	as	feminists	ruining	his	life,	Canada	has	made	it 1000	times	more	difficult	to	own	a	firearm. Not	that	you’d	want	to	smuggle	one	in.	Canadians	are	notorious	for being	friendly	to	outsiders.	It’s	what	lies	in	the	likes	of	Banff	Park	or	out in	the	Yukon	that	demands	gun	ownership	the	most:	Polar	bears. Grizzlies.	A	few	smugglers	here	and	there	but	they	probably	will	leave you	alone	if	you	leave	them	alone. And	on	that	topic,	smuggling	anything	into	Canada	requires	cunning unheard	of,	the	likes	of	which	Jabba	the	Hutt	himself	was	never	privy	to. It’s	serious	business. And	there’s	no	end	to	crazy	ideas,	believe	me.	Stories	in	which officers	have	relayed	to	their	families	probably	number	in	the	thousands. One	involved	a	Canadian	teenager	who,	at	the	border,	sobbed	like	a little	baby	when	the	officer	asked	him	if	he	had	any	weapons.	Like	that ‘Father,	I	confess!’	scene	from	The	Godfather,	the	kid	admitted	how	he’d gotten	into	some	trouble	down	south	at	a	bachelor	party	and	found himself	stuck	with	a	handgun	he’d	never	laid	eyes	on	before.	When	sent to	secondary	checkpoint	it	turned	out	his	gun	was	a	BB	gun.	His	‘friends’ had	played	a	delicious	joke	on	him,	telling	him	he’d	killed	a	hooker.	HA, good	ol’	Southern	Comfort. Anyway.	Let’s	discuss	bringing	laptops	across	the	border	and	other electronic	devices	in	which	said	device	could	easily	make	or	break	your attempt	at	becoming	invisible.	Namely,	what	tips	them	off. Contrary	to	popular	belief,	Border	Officers	on	the	Canadian	side	do   not	know	your	entire	life	history	when	they	scan	your	passport.	When you	drive	through	a	Canadian	checkpoint,	here	is	what	happens: Your	passport	is	scanned	 the	part	that	has	all	the	‘<’	left	arrow symbols 	using	an	international-standard	that’s	easily	readable	by	a CBSA	language	named	IPIL.	This	searches	through	law	enforcement records	such	as	outstanding	warrants,	both	present	and	past.	Beyond this,	there’s	no	time	to	go	through	every	database	with	the	lineup	these guys	deal	with.	It	simply	takes	way	too	much	time	as	planes	land	every other	day	with	1000	Canadians	who	are	eager	to	get	home	to	some	nice Timbits	and	Poutine. Therefore,	the	shortcut	to	seeing	if	you’re	a	criminal	or	not	isn’t	by searching	databases,	as	useful	as	they	are	 a	seasoned	criminal	will	know how	to	secure	false	passports	anyway .	The	way	to	tell	deception	is	by studying	your	behavior	-	Tics.	Facial	changes.	Visual	cues	 where	are	you looking?	DEA	agents	study	where	you	look	to	see	if	you’ll	give	up	the drug	location	after	a	raid .	Tone.	Hesitation.	Fidgeting.	Sometimes	a smuggler	will,	when	pressed	with	questions	by	a	Sam	Elliot	lookalike, they	get	nervous. If	 you	act	nervous,	the	jig	is	up.	And	they	know	the	difference between	fatigue	and	nervousness.	But	for	what	it’s	worth,	being	an absolute	jerk	to	the	officer	will	not	put	you	on	any	blacklist.	They	have	to let	you	in	as	a	Canadian	since	that	is	what	the	Canadian	Charter	dictates. What	they	don’t	have	to	let	in	is	your	stuff.	So	what	will	put	you	on	the nasty	list?	These: -	Shipping	drugs	by	mail -	Refusing	to	report	to	secondary	inspection -	Lying	 aka	‘Making	a	False	Declaration’	which	is	admittedly	a broad	topic,	and	lies	always	travel	faster	than	truths:	If	you	lie	to	one officer	in	Vancouver,	the	one	at	Niagara	Falls	will	know	about	it  -	Having	any	bad	history	at	the	border So	what	else	might	tip	off	a	BDO? Not	giving	up	your	password.	As	stated,	they’ll	let	you	through	but not	your	beloved	laptop.	They	do	not	need	a	warrant	at	all	to	search	your phone Galaxy	Tab Ipad. So	then,	encrypt?	Yes!	By	all	means	but	you	should	have	a	hidden operating	system	because	you	absolutely,	unequivocally	want	to	give   them	something	that	makes	you	look	like	you	have	nothing	to	hide.	You don’t	have	to	make	yourself	look	like	a	schmuck.	You	simply	have	to	look like	a	professional	who	values	your	privacy. 	Solution You	need	to	lock	down	your	data	prior	to	your	border	arrival. Designate	a	section	of	your	hard	drive	so	that	it’s	encrypted	out	of	an officer’s	plain	sight	and	with	a	second	encryption	key.	There	you	will store	your	private	files.	Do	this	even	if	you	have	full	disk	encryption. Diskcryptor	offers	this	as	well	as	most	older	encryption	applications	like PGP	and	Drivecrypt. Border	officers	aren’t	forensics	experts.	They	can’t	go	through	your Windows	or	Linux	directory	to	see	you’ve	got	one	encrypted	file	that’s fifty	gigs	in	size,	nor	that	you’ve	got	a	shortcut	to	it	via	menu	that	says ‘Calculator’	which	even	has	the	stock	Windows	icon.	If	they	want	to “image”	your	hard	drive,	that’s	no	sweat	off	your	back	as	long	as	your password	is	good. Speaking	of	which,	try	to	drop	a	symbol	in	the	middle	of	your password.	Mix	it	up	with	upper lowercase	with	a	number.	Yes,	these	are harder	to	remember.	To	counter	this	you	can	use	PasswordSafe. If	you’re	on	the	way	to	the	border	station	from	the	airport,	say	from Buffalo,	NY	to	the	Canadian	Border	Station	at	Niagara	Falls,	it	might	be too	late	to	encrypt	anything.	So	do	it	before	you	get	on	the	plane.	You need	to	have	that	decoy	ready	to	show,	with	recent	activity	in	case	they want	to	boot	up	the	OS.	It	will	look	suspicious	if	the	decoy	OS	has	not been	used	in	a	month.	Perhaps	not	to	every	customs	agent,	but	there	may be	one	smart	cookie	in	the	batch	who	knows	you	can	have	a	fake	OS. Store	nothing	incriminating	on	that	decoy	OS.	Vanilla	bookmarks  no	social	media 	only.	A	nice	backdrop.	Not	the	stock	install	wallpaper that	comes	with	Windows	or	Linux.	Maybe	a	picture	you	took	on vacation	of	all	the	Latina	lovelies. Once,	while	coming	back	from	Manila	to	Canada	 a	back-breaking	22 hour	flight ,	I	stored	my	encrypted	container	in	my	camera,	one	that	the border	agent	asked	for	directions	to	flip	through	the	pics.	He	saw	some beach	pics	I’d	shot	in	Dumaguete	but	not	the	encrypted	container	on	the SD	card.	They’re	not	going	to	remove	it	with	20	cars	behind	you.   Hiding	Valuables	Underground Things	may	get	to	the	point	where	you	must	hide	valuables underground.	There’s	nothing	particularly	unethical	about	this,	so	long as	it	isn’t	dead	bodies	or	something	like	enriched	uranium	leaking	out	of barrels.	Regardless	of	what	you	store,	know	that	anything	can	happen. You	could	get	get	mauled	by	Rottweilers	in	a	junkyard.	Who	knows	why you’d	be	there.	Maybe	looking	for	spare	parts.	Maybe	to	pay	Uncle Spanky	who	runs	the	place	a	visit.	And	then	what	happens	to	your	cache when	you	get	buried	six	feet	under?	Right. We	can	avoid	a	few	problems	if	we	follow	a	few	self-imposed	rules. Avoid	X	Marks	the	Spot	-	This	is	a	big	one.	Never	mark	the	treasure cache	spot	with	anything	unnatural.	No	arrows	in	trees	or	painted	rocks with	bright	and	yellow	smiley	faces	or	mini	“Stonehenges.”	These	attract fraternity	idiots.	Idiots	will	damage	the	site	-	they	will	move	things around	when	they	call	up	other	idiots	to	come	and	have	a	hot	dog cookout…	just	before	one	of	those	drunken	fools	drops	his	cig	near	the base	of	the	tree. Google	Earth	-	Use	Google	Earth	to	locate	the	exact	coordinates. Memorize	them	but	do	not	save	it	in	Google	Earth	unless	your	drive	is encrypted.	And	forget	about	using	that	Garmen,	too.	Some	models	save your	history.	Obviously	this	should	not	be	on	your	property	if	what you’re	burying	is	illegal	 or	if	the	IRS	can	take	it .	Always	assume	that someone	will	find	it.	Someone	with	a	shiny	badge	and	lots	of	time	to	kill. Insulation!	-	Take	a	hard	drive	apart,	say	an	external	one	that’s	dead. See	how	dry	it	is?	Now	re-screw	it	and	fasten.	Then	freeze	it	for	awhile. After,	put	it	out	on	the	porch	and	then	throw	it	in	the	freezer	again.	Open it	a	few	hours	later.	Yeah,	condensation.	Lots	of	it.	This	happens	to motherboards	and	ammo	alike	so	bury	beneath	the	frost	line	since moisture	will	kill	any	electrical	component. No	Water,	No	Problems!	-	Try	not	to	bury	valuables	near	streams, rivers	 or	 heaven	 forbid,	 swamps.	 Think	 “Up”	 when	 you	 think Underground.	Escarpments	and	hills	tend	to	make	great	spots	but	only	at   night	unless	it’s	out	in	the	boonies.	So	do	cemeteries	 if	you	own	one! . Bury	it	in	a	non-populated	area	with	elevation	enough	that	discourages daily	visitors. Bury	It	Naked	-	Avoid	toting	internet	items	with	you	whenever	you visit	your	sacred	spot.	That	means:	Tablets.	Phones.	Cameras.	Laptops. Ipads.	Watches	that	have	WiFi	 Apple .	That	also	means	ditching	your	car with	the	fancy-pants	navigation	system	 one	the	cops	will	have	fun tearing	apart	to	see	where	you	visited .	Bike	it	if	necessary.	Silence	is golden.	To	this,	what	works	for	me	is	to	think	“Zombies!”	since	the undead	are	attracted	to	loud	noises	like	Camaro	engines	and	big	trucks, too.	If	in	doubt,	watch	Walking	Dead,	Season	1	where	one	of	the	group steals	a	sport’s	car	and	the	alarm	goes	off	as	he	travels	up	to	the hideaway	camp.	When	morning	comes,	so	does	the	zombie	hoarde.   Going	To	Extremes One	day,	your	financial	situation	just	might	drive	you	to	this:  Looks	tranquil,	doesn’t	it? Almost	like	someplace	a	Bond	villain	might	set	up	base	camp,	far away	from	the	eyes	of	any	intelligence	agency.	I	sometimes	meditate	and dream	of	what	I	missed	when	I	was	walking	along	beaches	like	this	not too	long	ago.	Know	where	it	is?	I’ll	give	you	a	hint.	It	isn’t	Bora	Bora, though	the	turquoise	water	certainly	does	look	it.	It’s	the	Philippines,	and if	pictures	could	relay	the	Venus-like	temps,	the	salty	wind	of	the	sea	and the	feel	of	a	waif’s	sticky	finger	slipping	into	your	pocket	to	filch	your passport,	you	might	think	twice	about	defecting	there.	A	week-long vacation	is	one	thing,	but	to	live	there	is	a	whole	other	world	filled	to	the   brim	with	it’s	own	set	of	unique	challenges. You	could	want	to	leave	for	any	number	of	reasons,	and	they’re probably	all	justified.	Your	student	loans	might	be	preventing	you	from securing	employment	or	getting	married.	Perhaps	you’re	divorce	didn’t go	quite	as	stress-free	as	planned	and	now	you’re	required	to	“maintain” your	spouse’s	lifestyle.	Or	it	could	be	you’re	just	tired	of	driving	down Main	Street,	USA	and	always	looking	over	your	shoulder	for	fear	of	being thrown	in	the	can	over	a	lousy	expired	brake	tag. There’s	something	I	need	to	tell	you	about	exotic	places	like	this. Something	I	learned	that	was	ingrained	into	my	very	soul. And	it	is	this:	Your	problems	follow	you	around	like	a	stray	puppy. No	I	don’t	mean	your	financial	problems.	Over	there	your	student loans	won’t	mean	jack.	I	mean	your	personal	issues.	Anger	management. Jealousy.	Wanton	vandalism.	Piracy.	Alcoholism.	Cat	hoarder herder. Whatever	your	ethics,	whatever	your	spiritual	weakness,	it	will	not magically	change	overnight	when	you	leave	the	West.	Don’t	hightail	it	to escape	a	bad	habit,	be	it	gambling	or	drinking	or	cockfighting.	You’ll	just run	in	a	circle	until	you	tackle	the	problem	headon. But	you	might	find	that	you	need	to	get	away	to	an	exotic	place	to heal	yourself	as	you	restart	your	life.	That’s	darn	near	impossible	to	do	if Betsy	from	SallieMae	loans	is	constantly	harassing	your	family	every hour	on	the	hour	and	Uncle	Frick	is	threatening	to	kick	you	to	the	curb	if they	don’t	stop.	That’s	no	way	to	heal.	That’s	a	way	to	the	grim	reaper’s front	door.	Now,	we	all	meet	death	at	some	point,	but	there’s	no	reason Betsy	needs	to	accelerate	it	by	giving	you	a	heart	attack. Let’s	look	at	some	destinations	that	might	give	you	some	time	to reset	your	dreams	without	the	usual	distractions. 	Philippines It	wasn’t	the	sticker	shock	of	the	trip	to	Philippines	that	almost	had me	in	tears	 $1400 	or	even	the	insanely	long	flight	 18	hours .	It	was	the sweltering	heat	I	had	to	deal	with.	I	sweat	like	a	stuck	pig	and	burned	like a	roasted	turkey	on	a	spit	under	that	Manila	sun.	Being	raised	in	New Orleans	was	no	peace	of	cake	mind	you,	but	even	our	July	heat	was nothing	compared	to	this.	I	began	to	think	some	of	them	only	went	to Mass	to	escape	it.	Who	could	blame	them?	Certainly	not	the	Almighty.   But	I	could	see	myself	adapting,	as	I	know	you	can,	if	you	don’t panic.	Keep	your	wits	about	you.	Think	rationally	about	problems  something	that	seems	lacking	in	Filipino	culture	and	you’ll	see	this	if you	use	Google	Earth	to	view	their	city	grid	layouts. Life	is	slower	there.	Relationships	are	faster,	much	faster.	By	the fourth	date	your	sweetie	will	be	proposing.	No	lie.	If	you	meet	the parents,	you’re	not	getting	out	of	her	sight,	ever,	because	she	knows every	filipina	will	be	approaching	you	en	masse. There	are	other	issues,	too.	You	cannot	own	a	gun.	If	you’re	a	white single	male	you	will	stick	out	like	Marvin	Martian	in	Bunkie,	Louisiana. No	country	is	more	networked	than	the	Philippines.	Gossip	reigns supreme	because	of	the	social	nature	of	the	entire	country. And	it	really	is	a	third	world	country	in	some	parts.	Lack	of electricity.	Lack	of	clean	water,	with	Manila	being	the	worst.	But	the women,	heavens.	You’ll	think	you’d	time-traveled	to	Hawaii	in	1955.	The level	of	attention	I	got	was	insane,	and	I’m	no	George	Clooney	either.	I’m about	as	average	Joe	as	they	come.	Walking	through	SM	mall	 as	long	as you	don’t	resemble	an	ogre ,	you’ll	have	massive	numbers	of	women approaching	you.	If	you	are	in	Davao,	Cebu,	Dumaguete,	or	pretty	much anywhere	except	Manila	 crime-ridden 	and	Zamboanga	 terrorist central ,	this	is	a	fact	of	life. Unfortunately	this	brings	unexpected	attention	where	the	sweet, endearing	Filipinas	take	lovely	selfies	of	you	eating	by	yourself	and	post it	on	Facebook	and	Twitter	and	Instagram	before	joining	you.	Your stalker	may	take	notice	if	you	use	your	real	name	with	them.	They	may even	do	an	image	search	and	start	some	carnage	there. Solution? A	fake	profile	and	persona	if	you	go	this	route	-	different	interests that	go	along	with	that	shiny	fake	ID	and	fake	last	name,	fake	Facebook. Everything	to	use	with	the	locals	but	never	the	government.	A	lockbox	is useful	for	this. 	Canada Running	to	Canada	to	escape	student	loan	debt	is	one	thing.	Running for	a	crime	like	“kidnapping”	your	son	is	another. If	you	want	to	run	to	Canada	to	escape	a	crime,	forget	it.	It’s	the	last   place	you	want	to	be	unless	you	happen	to	be	Jeremiah	“liver	eating” Johnson	and	know	how	to	trap	beaver,	scale	a	mountain	and	survive	in sub-zero	freezing	temperatures. That	Canadian	friendliness	we	see	in	John	Candy’s	movies	comes	at a	high	price:	They	will	hand	you	over	with	a	side	of	Canadian	bacon	if	U.S. authorities	demand	it.	I’ve	lived	here	for	over	twelve	years	and	though the	Canadian	police	 Toronto	excluded 	were	far	more	polite	and professional	than	any	of	my	Cajun	brethren	down	in	Louisiana,	I’ve	never heard	of	any	cases	where	they	hand	out	asylum	benefits	like	Willy Wonka	bars.	In	fact,	they	don’t	grant	asylum	to	Americans,	period. There’s	a	funny	scene	in	the	film	Escape	From	New	York	where	Van Cleef’s	character,	a	real	“hang	em	high”	supercop	kind	of	guy,	threatens Snake	Plisskan	with	death	if	he	so	much	as	thinks	of	turning	his	loaned police	glider	around	and	flying	off	to	Canada	instead	of	saving	the President	of	the	U.S.A	I	nearly	cracked	a	rib	laughing	as	I	thought,	“How stupid	does	he	think	Snake	is?” Canada	would	dropship	poor	Snake	no	matter	what	crime	he’d committed.	Oh	they’d	be	nice	about	it,	I’ll	grant	you	that.	Maybe	they’d send	him	back	handcuffed	in	a	coffin	filled	with	a	hundred	bottles	of delicious	Canadian	maple	syrup	Han	Solo-style.	After	that,	they’d	throw in	some	Tim	Horton’s	donuts.	Ol’	Van	Cleef	would’ve	loved	that,	I’m	sure. So	heed	this	advice:	Canada	is	a	no-fly	zone	if	ever	you’re	in	serious, deep	trouble.	They	turned	over	Mark	Emery,	eminent	marijuana	activist and	he	was	one	of	their	own. Remember,	just	because	a	country	does	not	have	an	extradition treaty	with	the	USA	does	not	mean	they	will	not	extradite	you. Below	is	an	interesting	list,	where	you	will	stand	a	good	chance	of “disappearing,”	and	in	the	case	of	a	country	like	Syria,	disappearance	can be	a	whole	other	world	of	hurt	if	you	don’t	have	connections. Afghanistan,	 Algeria,	 Andorra,	 Angola,	 Armenia,	 Bahrain, Bangladesh,	Belarus,	Bosnia,	Herzegovina,	Brunei,	Burkina	Faso,	Burma, Burundi,	Cambodia,	Cameroon,	Cape	Verde,	the	Central	African	Republic, Chad,	China,	Comoros,	Congo,	Djibouti,	Equatorial	Guinea,	Eritrea, Indonesia,	 Ethiopia,	 Gabon,	 Guinea,	 Guinea-Bissau,	 Ivory	 Coast, Kazakhstan,	 Kosovo,	 Kuwait,	 Laos,	 Lebanon,	 Libya,	 Macedonia, Madagascar,	Maldives,	Mali,	Marshall	Islands,	Mauritania,	Micronesia,   Moldova,	Mongolia,	Montenegro,	Morocco,	Mozambique,	Namibia,	Nepal, Niger,	Oman,	Qatar,	Russia,	Rwanda,	Samoa,	Sao	Tome	&	Principe,	Saudi Arabia,	Senegal,	Serbia,	Somalia,	Sudan,	Syria,	Togo,	Tunisia,	Uganda, Ukraine,	United	Arab	Emirates,	Uzbekistan,	Vanuatu,	Vatican,	and Vietnam. In	the	case	of	Cambodia,	we	saw	they	quite	willingly	handed	over Pirate	Bay	founder	Gottfrid	Svartholm	to	Sweden. We	saw	Edward	Snowden	run	to	Russia	when	the	heat	was	on, catching	a	flight	from	Hong	Kong	and	later	requesting	 and	being granted 	temporary	asylum.	We’ll	see	if	that	pans	out	in	the	long	term. Fredrik	‘Pirate	Bay’	Neij’s	country	of	choice	was	Laos,	after	being sentenced	to	a	whopping	one	year	in	a	Swedish	prison	and	ordered	to pay	 gasp 	$905,000	in	“damages.”	Laos	refused	to	hand	him	over.	Later in	November	2014,	Neij	was	arrested	on	an	Interpol	warrant	as	he attempted	to	cross	into	Thailand. Costa	Rica	may	be	another	option.	There	have	been	a	few	high- profile	cases	of	runners	making	it	there	but	do	your	research	beforehand. Know	the	differences	in	culture.	Know	the	history	of	extraditions	to	your native	country.	Know	how	to	get	out	fast	if	revolution	starts.	Everything safe	costs	money	so	you	need	to	have	a	substantial	savings	and	a portfolio	that	is	diversified.	This	is	so	that	no	one	bank	can	close	your accounts	over	something	like	student	loans	and	wipe	you	out. 	Thailand We	left	out	Thailand	in	the	above	list.	It’s	a	nice	place	to	run	to escape	problems.	Just	not	 criminal	problems.	Putting	aside	their extradition	treaty	with	the	U.S.,	for	one	you	need	to	speak	Thai	to	stay there	long	term.	Forget	about	what	you	heard	on	an	expat	forum	that	you can	“get	by”	with	English.	No	matter	where	you	are	-	Bangkok,	Chiang Mai,	Phukut,	you	need	the	language	to	get	around	because	it’s	hard enough	being	a	stranger	in	a	strange	land	without	expecting	everyone	to know	sign	language.	This	is	the	most	glaring	difference	between Thailand	and	Philippines,	with	clothing	being	somewhat	high	priced. 	Thailand	Expenses Rent	is	dirt	cheap,	with	some	places	like	Chiang	Mai	being	cheaper   than	others.	Bangkok	is	where	most	of	the	tourists	hang	out	and	for	good reason.	Better	food	than	out	in	the	provincial	areas	and	far	more	reliable Internet.	You	can	go	to	the	website	Numbeo.com	to	see	a	breakdown	of just	what	you’d	spend	if	you	lived	there.	For	2015,	this	is	what	you’d likely	be	looking	at: Restaurants	 average 	Meal,	Inexpensive	Restaurant	$1.48 Meal	for	2,	Mid-range	Restaurant,	Three-course	$17.81 McMeal	at	McDonalds$4.45 	Utilities	 Monthly 	Basic	 Electricity,	Heating,	Water,	Garbage 	for Apartment	$107.10 1	min.	of	Prepaid	Mobile	 No	Discounts	or	Plans 	0.04 Internet	 6	Mbps,	Unlimited	Data,	Cable ADSL 	$18.82 	Clothing 1	Pair	of	Jeans	 Levis	501 	$84.48 1	Summer	Dress	in	a	Chain	Store	 Zara,	H&M,	… 	$53.56 1	Pair	of	Nike	Running	Shoes	 Mid-Range 	$102.00 	Rent	Per	Month Apartment	 1	bedroom 	in	City	Center	$589.57 Apartment	 1	bedroom 	Outside	of	Center	$318.34 Apartment	 3	bedrooms 	in	City	Center	$1,746.38 	Two	things	jump	out	at	me	when	viewing	the	costs.	One	is	the	price for	a	nice	restaurant,	obviously	targeting	out-of-towners.	The	other	is clothing.	Clothing	there	is	similar	to	what	you	pay	in	Philippines	for electronics.	Very	expensive	for	the	average	Thai,	but	there	are	ways around	this	since	you	don’t	have	to	buy	name	brands. 	All	in	all,	it’s	possible	to	live	there	on	$600	USD	per	month,	just	not in	style. 	Religion This	is	also	in	stark	contrast	to	the	West,	as	most	Thais	are	Buddhist. Not	only	that,	the	King	is	considered	a	kind	of	sacred	entity,	a	sort	of   messianic	figure,	the	kind	you	don’t	want	to	cross.	If	you	are	in	a	theater and	the	king	is	visible,	you’ll	be	required	to	stand	like	we	do	when	we salute	the	flag	at	a	baseball	game.	Only	in	America	this	is	totally	optional. You	can	even	burn	the	flag	in	the	States.	This	confuses	the	average	Thai like	no	other. In	2008,	a	woman	visiting	Thailand	refused	to	stand	in	respect	to the	king’s	image	in	a	theater	just	before	the	film	 The	Other	Boleyn	Girl  began.	Police	had	stated	she	appeared	to	be	quite	insane	 Naturally	only an	insane	person	wouldn’t	bow	or	stand	to	a	foreign	king,	right? 	That’s not	to	say	the	Thais	don’t	have	a	sense	of	humor,	for	in	2012,	Thailand police	introduced	Hello	Kitty	armbands	as	a	way	to	shame	certain officers	for	showing	up	late	or	getting	too	many	parking	tickets.	They discontinued	this	practice	though	when	the	world	began	to	laugh  perhaps	this	was	the	whole	point? 	That’s	just	two	examples	of	major differences	that	can	cause	problems	if	you	don’t	know	the	culture.	So immerse	yourself	in	a	few	travel	books	or	forums	before	you	even	think of	going.	You	may	inadvertently	face	a	prison	sentence	for	the	crime	of ignorance. 	China China	is	pretty	big	and	easy	to	get	lost	in.	Fortunately	if	you’re	dead set	on	running	here,	you	won’t	have	to	worry	about	extradition	treaties since	mainland	China	has	none	with	the	U.S.	This	comes	in	handy	for whistleblowers	like	Snowden	who	leak	classified	documents. China	can	veto	any	extradition	if	it	interferes	with	defense	or	public policy.	It’s	all	a	bit	murky	to	be	honest.	On	a	technical	level,	yes,	Hong Kong	has	an	extradition	treaty	with	the	U.S.	but	that	was	before	Great Britain	gave	control	of	Hong	Kong	over	to	the	mainland.	In	interviews, it’s	been	crystal	clear	even	Snowden	felt	this	was	just	too	much	of	a	grey area	to	risk	staying	in	the	country	long	term.	Not	that	he	wanted	to	stay in	Moscow	since	that	was	where	he	was	when	the	passport	got	yanked  no	pun . 	Disappearing	in	China	-	The	Good,	The	Bad,	&	The	Ugly This	is	easier	said	than	done.	It’s	easy	to	flee	there,	sure,	but	hard	to disappear.	Very	hard.	Americans	abroad	tend	to	acquire	an	affliction   there	ten	times	quicker	than	even	in	the	Philippines.	It’s	called	“Rock Star”	affliction.	And	once	you’ve	got	it,	it’s	brutally	hard	to	get	rid	of	since the	celebrity	factor	alone	hits	your	ego	first.	Any	thoughts	on	being	a humble	little	shepherd	go	out	the	window	after	a	day	or	so	off	the	plane. Ethnic	diversity	isn’t	really	as	widespread	in	China	as	some westerners	think.	You	will	stick	out	like	Big	Bird	if	you	are	not	Chinese, and	if	you	are	of	the	Dutch	blonde	hair blue	eyes	variety	of	westerner, you’ll	be	as	visible	as	Big	Bird	would	be	traveling	with	those	little	green aliens	from	Toy	Story.	Believe	it. The	picture	taking	is	the	most	obvious.	Cute	at	first,	it	will	quickly grate	on	your	nerves	as	many	Chinese	will	ask	you,	“Take	picture	of	my baby?”	many	times	when	you	go	out	and	about.	Only	after	three	or	four of	these	in	a	week,	you’ll	begin	to	suspect	a	conspiracy.	Well,	it	sort	of	is. They	like	your	white	skin,	for	starters.	You’ll	even	get	special	attention	by teenage	schoolgirls	who	will	try	and	spy	on	you	while	hoping	their giggling	girlfriends	don’t	give	them	away	as	they	twirl	their	Hello	Kitty purses.	More	conservative	areas	will	yield	less	obvious	giggling	 behind curtains	instead	of	telephone	poles ,	but	the	effect	is	the	same:	It’s impossible	to	blend	in	without	actually	speaking	Chinese	and	knowing Chinese	culture. Then	come	the	questions.	From	everyone.	In	Japan	they	call	them “Gaijin	lovers”	 foreigner	lovers 	and	these	nice	yet	quirky	and	strange beings	will	come	up	to	you	in	Tokyo	 or	anywhere	else	in	Japan 	and launch	wave	after	wave	of	data	mining	questions.	In	China	this	happens as	regularly	as	the	sun	coming	up.	Again,	cute	at	first	but	it	quickly becomes	an	annoyance	after	the	twentieth	stranger	comes	up	to	you	and asks:	-	Is	true	all	Americans	own	Glock	like	John	Wayne? -	Is	Texas	like	Seinfeld? -	You	have	beautiful	wife	yet?	Our	city	offer	you	many	pretty	wives! -	Are	alien	UFO	really	in	Nevada?	 hint:	Don’t	tell	them	it’s	in	New Mexico 	-	You	has	rose	tattoo	like	all	Americans,	yes?	I	can	see?	 eyes your	crotch 	-	You	has	Hells	Angels	in	family?	Show	photos!	 begs	you	to take	out	wallet  Rudeness Now	for	some	of	the	bad	and	the	ugly. This	mainly	applies	to	Hong	Kong	and	other	metro	areas	where	the   ancient	god	Mammon	rules	with	an	iron	fist.	Bare	in	mind	that	not	every one	is	like	this.	Only	a	few	rotten	eggs	that	spoil	it	for	everyone	else.	But like	I	said,	when	discussing	rudeness	and	the	Chinese	with	an	Indian, Pakistani,	African	or	Filipino,	they	in	all	likelihood	will	think	of	Hong Kong	as	number	one	on	the	list. Deep	breath. The	horking	and	spitting	and	public	flatulence	was	bad	enough,	but worse	than	this	was	that	few	trash	cans	could	be	seen	anywhere.	If	there were,	I	didn’t	see	any	 or	maybe	they’re	just	too	expensive .	This	is	in stark	contrast	to	Japan,	where	throwing	your	Coke	can	on	the	ground	is seen	as	slapping	the	Prime	Minister’s	face.	Japanese	love	foreigners	and they	want	as	many	visitors	as	possible.	So	for	this	reason	their	streets are	sparkling	clean. In	fact,	you’d	be	hard	pressed	to	even	see	garbage	in	a	subway	or even	a	busy	city	street	in	metro	Tokyo. But	in	China?	Friend	you	don’t	know	rudeness	until	you’ve	been down	a	busy	HongKong	street	at	rush	hour.	Think	New	York	is	bad?	It’s not.	Hong	Kong	is	like	Seinfeld’s	“Bizarro	World”	where	up	is	down	and down	is	up	and	Superman	is	evil.	And	believe	me	when	I	say	I’m	no	neat freak.	But	even	I	had	expectations	that	had	to	be	adjusted	accordingly. As	you	may	have	guessed	at	this	point,	rudeness	make	disappearing problematic.	Americans,	myself	included,	tend	to	go	Wyatt	Earp	when confronted	with	rudeness	overseas.	This	causes	problems	for	anyone wanting	to	disappear	because	it	draws	massive	attention	to	yourself. Thus,	if	there	is	one	thing	I	learned,	it’s	that	when	in	HongKong,	turn	the cheek	if	at	all	possible. A	friend	of	mine	relayed	what	he’d	seen	once	on	a	weeknight	at	a high-end	restaurant	whereby	the	waiter,	who	was	obviously	nursing	a hangover	as	he	applied	every	other	ice	cold	drink	to	his	forehead	in between	taking	orders,	suddenly	horked	his	lunch	all	over	the	floor.	After cleaning	it	up,	this	waiter	doesn’t	bother	to	go	to	the	restroom	to	wash up!	He	simply	took	a	mop	to	the	floor,	pushed	the	bucket	back	into	the corner	of	the	place	and	resumed	taking	orders	with	the	same	filthy	hands he’d	horked	with.	That’s	pretty	tame,	though	next	to	other	incidents	I’ve heard.In	Hong	Kong,	the	mad	rush	to	earn	money	there	is,	well,   maddening.	Far	more	than	even	Wall	Street	exhibits.	People	ram	right into	you	in	Hong	Kong	in	the	middle	of	the	street	without	blinking.	They seem	allergic	to	apologizing.	They	don’t	even	blink	if	you	slip	and	fall. They	merely	continue	as	if	they	were	a	couple	of	medics	getting	shot	at on	the	beaches	of	Normandy	and	you’re	in	the	way.	Foreigners	have	been almost	run	over	by	cabs	that	would’ve	stopped	or	at	least	honked	had	it been	New	York. Again,	mostly	in	Hong	Kong.	Provincial	areas	are	far	more hospitable	but	even	there	you	may	find	a	woman	saying	you	“are	too	fat” if	you’ve	been	on	a	date	with	her.	This	isn’t	rudeness	to	them.	It’s	just honesty.   Counterfeiting items	 are	 everywhere	  Counterfeit	 in	 China.	 The	 Philippines unfortunately	gets	a	lot	of	it	sent	to	them	because	it’s	cheaper.	Cheap shirts	that	rip	in	two	weeks.	Cheap	Chinese	electronics	 phones,	tablets, etc 	that	break	within	two	months.	Iphones	that	aren’t	Iphones.	Hard drives	that	seem	to	have	been	made	from	twigs	and	fish	bones	that	croak after	a	week	of	use. Souvenirs	as	well	are	hit	and	miss.	You’ll	see	items	sold	in	antique stores	that	cost	far	below	what	they’d	really	sell	for	if	they	were	even 10%	authentic.	Statuettes	fall	into	this	category	and	it	is	easy	to	get suckered.	They	know	how	to	replicate	the	look	and	feel	of	something	old. Something	dusty	and	archaic	and	webby.	They	may	charge	you	$100	for something	like	a	vase	that	they	claim	is	from	8th	century	China.	If	that were	the	case,	the	price	would	be	closer	to	ten	grand.	Not	kidding.	This goes	on	all	over	China,	where	counterfeit	goods	fool	naive	visitors	every year.	If	you’re	going	drop	major	cash	on	a	statue,	ensure	it	is	appraised by	someone	you	trust	implicitly	 before	laying	your	cash	across	the counter. 	The	Disappearing	Act As	you	can	imagine,	the	cameras	everywhere	being	pointed	in	your direction	 is	 catastrophic	 to	 anonymity.	 A	 disguise	 might	 prove embarrasing	 and	possibly	attract	the	attention	of	law	enforcement 	if your	mustache	falls	off	in	front	of	a	crowd	of	gawking	Chinese.	They	may whisper,	“Is	he	a	spy?” “Why	did	he	dye	his	hair?” “Why	she	feel	need	to	wear	a	wig?” “Should	I	tell	someone?” This	in	addition	to	the	fact	most	of	those	photos	may	end	up	online somewhere.	Nevertheless,	here	are	some	things	you	might	consider. They’ve	helped	me	whenever	that	‘Stranger	in	a	Strange	Land’	feeling came	over	me.   	I. 	Learn	a	basic	level	of	Chinese	and	they	will	forgive	just	about anything	you	do	short	of	stealing	nuclear	launch	codes.	You	can’t	travel incognito	well	without	it	anyway,	so	learn	the	basics	of	how	to	get around	-	how	to	rent	cars,	hotels,	how	to	read	maps,	open	a	savings account,	check	into	a	B&B,	order	a	steak	at	a	restaurant…	And	try	to	be compassionate	with	Chinese	culture.	It	is	not	rude	for	them	to	say “You’re	getting	fat!”	like	it	is	in	America.	It’s	like	saying,	“You’re	a	little sunburned”	to	someone	Stateside.	But	it	is	 very	rude	for	a	Chinese woman	on	a	subway	to	mutter	“hei	gue”	 black	devil 	to	you	if	you’re black.	It’s	quite	the	catch-22	if	you	know	Chinese	and	want	to	call	her	out publicly	on	it.	If	you	do,	chances	are	good	her	eyes	will	well	up	with	tears and	beg	for	your	forgiveness. 	II. 	Rock	Star	Status	gets	old	believe	it	or	not.	Read	any	interview with	Steven	Tyler	or	Garth	Brooks	and	you’ll	see	that	even	those heavyweights	grow	weary	of	it	after	awhile,	as	will	you.	To	that,	don’t assume	that	since	everyone	is	taking	your	picture	that	it’s	okay	to	take everyone	 else’s	picture.	Keeping	a	low	profile	is	okay	but	not	to	the extreme,	which	may	arouse	suspicion	as	well. 	III. 	Talk	With	Your	Hands	-	If	you	don’t	speak	Chinese,	don’t	shoot	a pic	of	a	local	Chinese	guy	without	doing	some	sign	language	to	ask	first  point	to	him,	then	to	the	camera,	then	smile . 	IV. 	Be	assertive	and	say	NO	when	necessary.	Learn	how	to	say	it	in Mandarin	and	learn	not	to	worry	about	hurting	their	feelings.	Some Chinese	students	once	asked	to	snap	a	picture	of	me	because	I	am	6‘2 and	have	vampire-white	skin	 this	was	just	outside	the	French	Quarter near	the	St.	Louis	Cathedral .	I	calmly	told	them	my	vampire	clan	would be	upset	if	they	ever	found	out	I	was	walking	around	in	the	daytime	since it	was	against	the	clan’s	rules,	and	likely	come	after	who	shot	the	picture. Their	eyes	grew	as	big	as	dinner	plates. “Vampires?!	Ooh!” Snap.	Snap.	Snap.	Snap.   CIA	Manipulation	and	Disappearing Jason	Bourne	and	James	Bond	are	a	bit	of	a	joke	to	CIA	agents. Unrealitsic	is	being	too	kind.	If	agents	had	half	of	the	gadgets	Bond	uses, their	offices	would	be	filled	with	resumes	from	every	city	in	the	U.S.	But to	the	rest	of	us	normal	guys,	there’s	nothing	funny	about	Bond	being sliced	in	half	by	a	laser	or	Brosnan	resurrecting	his	heartbeat	 Die Another	Day . Well,	maybe	the	latter.	A	little. They’re	spies	we	want	to	emulate,	fair	enough,	but	sadly	a	lot	of methods	of	disappearing	into	thin	air	don’t	translate	well	from	the	silver screen	to	reality.	In	fact,	the	real	deal	is	often	quite	different. What	you	see	in	True	Lies	and	the	Bourne	movies	that	gets	the	bad guys	usually	ends	up	with	a	CIA	agent	shaking	his	head	in	the	theater.	It’s just	not	done	that	way.	Not	usually.	In	the	past,	CIA	techniques	relied	on deception	-	deceiving	the	target’s	mind	with	psychology	-	false	trails, leads,	and	lies,	lies,	lies,	but	that’s	less	common	today.	These	days	it	is about	intense	networking	and	analyzing	and	tracing	and	focusing, getting	as	much	data	as	you	can	and	all	while	being	as	quiet	as	a	church mouse.	Boring	stuff	for	James	Cameron	and	Michael	Bay. Yes,	you	do	learn	a	lot	of	survival	techniques	that,	for	a	few moments,	might	resemble	something	Bond	did	on	a	bad	hair	day	in Madrid,	but	it’s	rare.	And	if	it	comes	down	to	you	chasing	a	terrorist mastermind	through	traffic	while	riding	a	horse	that	leads	you	to	the	top of	the	Marriott,	well,	forget	it.	You’re	beyond	sloppy.	The	visibility	factor alone	would	make	world	headlines.	Attention	whoring	x	1000	=	Mission Failed.	Manipulation	Tactics Back	when	I	ran	online	ad	campaigns	 my	first	business	failure ,	I manipulated	people	left	and	right	without	even	realizing	it.	Every	day. I’d	fire	up	CPV	Lab	on	my	server	and	spend	 and	lose 	thousands running	ads	for	affiliate	companies	like	Neverblue	and	Clickbank	while   buying	traffic	from	TrafficVance	and	LeadImpact.	Not	cheap,	but	once	I split-tested	two	ads	enough	to	see	my	sales	skyrocket,	I	was	hooked.	This was	effective	manipulation.	Giving	people	what	 they	think 	they	need	in exchange	for	something	I	wanted:	a	nice	income	stream. Corporations	do	this	all	the	time.	Sears.	Target.	Wal-Mart.	Best	Buy. They’re	artists	at	it.	But	what	you	find	works	in	the	USA	might	not	work in	Canada. Point	being?	Don’t	hesitate	to	manipulate	if	it’s	required	to	keep	you invisible.	A	good	CIA	agent	will	have	zero	problems	with	manipulation	if it	means	it	will	push	the	mission	objective	 forward	-	that	is,	one	step closer	to	completion.	Best	Buy	does	this,	and	they	have	pretty	atrocious pricing	on	many	items,	not	the	least	of	which	is	the	worthless	extended warranty	they	pressure	you	into	buying. So	why	do	more	people	shop	there	instead	of	a	smaller	PC	repair shop?	The	answer	is	manipulation,	and	it	isn’t	that	different	than	what the	secretive	CIA	does.	This	doesn’t	mean	you	have	to	be	a	brown-noser. Just	know	how	to	manipulate	without	giving	valuable	intel	about	your past	away. 	Forging	Allies The	CIA	does	not	like	to	make	pure	enemies.	They	like	to	make allies.	They	like	to	forge	alliances.	To	this	end,	they	spend	tons	of	money on	operations	that	find	common	ground	with	pseudo-enemies	and accelerate	common	goals.	Suppress	the	bad	and	elevate	the	good,	which they	hope	will	turn	into	a	nice,	flowery	friendship. Then	they	send	in	spies. The	Soviets	liked	to	do	it	this	way,	only	they	employed	far	more evilness	in	the	implementation	of	it	all.	Subversion	was	the	name	of	their game.	Specifically,	subversion	tactics	to	undermine	the	 stability	of	a country.	The	moral	fabric	if	you	will.	You	know,	kill	patriotism	or	any kind	of	idealism	that	could	unify	a	country	against	outside	enemies.	It really	mattered	little	what	it	was	that	got	under	people’s	skin	as	long	as	it drove	them	to	fight	each	other,	and	that	was	good	enough. The	KGB	defector	Yuri	Bezmenov	relayed	this	expertly	and	perhaps as	ominously	as	Jonah	did	to	the	inhabitants	of	Ninevah,	but	with compassion	and	a	dire	warning	to	the	West.	Manipulation	and	deceit	are   the	tools	of	darkness.	Devastatingly	effective	yet	as	dangerous	to	deploy as	a	suitcase	nuke.	Eventually,	things	start	falling	apart. He	laid	it	out	like	a	strategic	battle	plan	at	Midway	in	his	“Love Letter	to	America,”	how	everything	the	KGB	did	to	undermine	western democracy	and	freedom	as	you	know	it	was	put	above	all	else.	The interview	 from	1983 	is	quite	telling	and	even	shocking	in	some	parts	of the	telling	of	it,	how	the	Russians	would	invite	every	diplomat	to	mother Russia,	get	them	drunk,	plastered,	pickled	and	primed	for	a	lie,	then	paint a	rosy	picture	of	how	pretty	and	flowery	Russia	was,	both	the	people	and her	politicians. Only	it	wasn’t. Prisons	were	turned	into	nurseries	overnight.	Spies	and	liars	tricked every	reporter	that	came	around	shooting	for	LIFE	and	Time.	Magazine spreads	portrayed	the	entire	country	as	victims	of	the	evil	U.S. capitalistic	empire,	yet	Russia	bore	it	all	like	a	messiah	wearing	a	crown of	thorns,	with	smiling	faces	and	vigorous	“happy”	handshakes	living under	the	benevolent	Soviet	government. And	we	know	how	that	story	ended.	The	Soviet	Union	broke	up.	The lesson,	I	believe,	for	anyone	contemplating	disappearing	in	a	free country,	is	this: Have	Ethics.	Have	a	moral	base	and	keep	your	manipulation	tactics sane	so	that,	Heaven	forbid	you	are	caught	red-handed,	you	won’t	be strung	up	from	the	nearest	tree	by	your	compatriots.	Not	to	sound	too preachy	here	but,	God	is	watching,	after	all,	and	sees	what	lies	in	a	man’s heart.	Things	that	cannot	be	legislated.	Sew	your	relationships	to	your advantage,	certainly,	but	don’t	sacrifice	your	soul	to	do	so.   How	The	NSA	Finds	Anyone Your	physical	location	is	easy	to	track	if	you’re	predictable.	To	that, most	of	us	are.	Maybe	90%	of	us. Think	about	it. We	wake	up	at	the	same	hour	and	place	most	days.	Wear	the	same style	of	clothes	every	season.	Shop	at	the	same	retail	outlets.	Visit	the same	places	come	Memorial	Day.	Date	the	same	type	of	people	even	if they	aren’t	our	dream	dates	 for	me,	redhead	librarians	with	glasses . Married	people?	Forget	it.	You’re	not	getting	off	the	NSA	radar	without good	security. 	Cell	Towers Cell	phone	grids	are	a	bit	like	computers	in	that	they	need	to	know where	you	are	in	order	to	“talk”	to	you.	Networked	computers,	too,	need IP	addresses.	Without	‘em,	there’s	 zero	communication	since	it	has nowhere	to	send	the	data	packets.	Same	with	cell	networks.	Cell geolocation	is	required	to	send	you	your	stuff;	Skype,	emails,	Warcraft pings.	Doesn’t	really	matter	what	kind	it	is,	but	know	this:	The	NSA prefers	you	favor	convenience	over	security	since	breaching	security	is harder	for	them.	If	massive	numbers	of	people	put	convenience	above security,	well	that’s	all	the	more	power	in	their	hands.	They	win,	you lose.But	triangulation	is	really	nothing	new.	It’s	just	that	now	they’ve refined	it,	looped	it,	hacked	it	and	mangled	it	in	such	a	way	that	it’s	now intertwined	with	emergency	services.	Case	in	point:	you’re	a	hiker	whose dog	gets	stuck	in	a	cliff	crevice	with	no	way	back	up.	Remember	what Ben	Franklin	said	about	liberty	and	security? And	no	two	ways	about	it.	It’s	easy-peasy	for	the	NSA	to	tap	your private	data	either	by	listening	in	or	CEO-inked	backroom	deals.	At	any rate	it’s	pretty	darn	easy	for	them	to	narrow	their	scope	to	a	particular GSM	phone	given	the	number	of	towers	everywhere.	From	their	lips	to  “Those	who	sacrifice	a	little	liberty	for	security	deserve	neither.”   your	eyes:	“GSM	Cell	Towers	can	be	used	as	a	physical-geolocation	point in	relation	to	a	GSM	handset	of	interest.” They	also	use	drones.   Drones	 and	How	to	Defeat	Them   Above,	a	U.S.	Customs	Patrol	Drone. If	you’re	trekking	across	the	border	and	wondering	whether	or	not you’ll	see	a	drone	20,000	feet	up,	chances	are	you	won’t.	It	isn’t	just	the sheer	height	of	the	blasted	things	that	are	the	problem.	It’s	how	easily Mother	Nature	tends	to	obscure	their	flight	patterns	with	clouds,	fog,	and thunderstorms,	making	any	anti-drone	technology	an	exercise	in frustration.	This	in	addition	that	they	fly	soundless.	Silent	killers	in	the night	sky.	How	would	you	know	a	twinkling	star	from	one	flying overhead? But	fear	not,	there	are	a	few	measures	we	can	deploy,	er	employ. 1. 	Sensor	Disruption	-	Any	technology	with	sensors	needs	to	see	the   target	it’s	trying	to	capture.	So	give	it	a	dose	of	it’s	own	medicine:	lasers. Ever	wonder	why	a	kid	with	a	laser-pointer	gets	a	visit	from	the	FBI when	he	points	it	at	the	cockpit	of	a	747	flying	overhead?	Right	-	the laser	disrupts	not	only	the	instruments	onboard	but	the	visibility	of	the pilots.	Blind	pilots	cannot	fly	straight	nor	can	they	read	their	navigation systems.	Same	with	drones,	and	though	pilotless,	have	cameras	that	relay images	to	a	set	of	human	eyeballs.	The	downside	of	course	is	that	you make	it	all	too	obvious	that	you’re	not	some	kid	with	the	kitty’s	laser- pointer. 	2. 	Hacking	-	This	is	far	easier	said	than	done.	It	used	to	be	that drones	could	be	hacked	just	as	flight	navigation	systems	on	a	747	can	be hacked,	but	it’s	harder	to	do	now	with	encryption.	The	movie	Interstellar goofed.	Matthew	McConaughey’s	character	 with	his	daughter’s	help  hack	into	a	drone	flying	overhead	from	years	ago.	Only	it	looks	all	too easy	because	there	is	no	encryption	to	hack	past.	Years	prior	to	the	film’s release,	North	Korea	and	Iran	both	claimed	to	have	downed	drones	using hacking	techniques	whereby	they	“spoof”	the	GPS	signal	and,	as	irony would	have	it,	send	it	on	a	suicidal	death	spiral. 	3. 	EMP	Pulse	-	The	problem	with	this	is	that	even	if	you	could create	this	by	yourself,	the	pulse	cares	not	a	whit	about	your	own electronic	equipment	or	grid.	So	it’d	be	like	shooting	yourself	in	the	foot. Actually,	worse.	Recall	the	MAD	tactic	 mutually	assured	destruction  Trinity	used	in	The	Matrix	just	as	the	A.I	machines	were	drilling	into	the Morpheus’	ship:	The	Nebuchadnezzar,	with	Neo	and	Morpheus	still jacked	in.	She	hit	the	switch	and	fried	every	bot	but	left	her	ship defenseless.	They	all	lived,	however,	an	in	the	end	it	may	just	come	to that	for	us. 	4. 	Counter-Drones	-	This	requires	downed	drones,	of	course,	unless you	manufacture	your	own.	Set	these	drones	to	survey	the	skies	for unfriendlies	and	scan	and	identify	via	encryption	keys	the	same	way	that PGP	users	do	over	the	internet.	The	issue	of	course	is	that	the	enemy	can see	these	just	as	you	can	see	theirs…	unless	you’ve	got	decoys	set	up	to give	off	fake	heat	signatures.   	5. 	Occupy	The	High	Ground	-	For	this	to	work	you’d	need	teams specially	trained	and	camouflaged	to	lookout	for	drones	all	day,	all	night, armed	with	microwave-type	weaponry.	The	microwave	itself	You’d	also need	powerful	scopes	to	distinguish	a	drone	from	a	plane	which	is	not discernable	to	the	naked	eye	even	from	high	up.	As	well,	noise-sensors would	be	required	that	detect	the	low-hum	engine	noise	from	a	drone, assuming	of	course	you	knew	the	make model	of	said	drone. 	6. 	Camouflage	-	No	I	don’t	mean	like	the	Ghillie	suit	used	in	Call	of Duty	4,	but	rather	the	natural	camouflage	given	by	large	structures. Shadows,	bridges	covered	in	vines,	that	sort	of	thing.	Just	remember	that traveling	at	night	is	risky	no	matter	what	you’re	wearing	since	the	drone will	detect	your	heat	signature	anyway.	Better	to	stick	to	tunnels,	under bridges,	railroad	tracks	and	moving	building	to	building,	cover	to	cover as	a	disguise	had	other	uses.	This	is	of	course	assuming	you	know	how	to travel	incognito	as	you	might	be	in	enemy	territory.	If	you	can	blend	in with	what	the	drone	considers	‘non-adversaries’,	then	it	will	not	be	able to	distinguish	between	you	and	Vladmir.	The	downside	is	if	that	drone	is using	facial	recognition	tech,	whereby	they	can	match	your	face	with what	they	have	on	file.	If	you’re	a	wanted	man,	better	wear	a	hood, makeup,	beard	or	whatever	you	need	to	look	thinner	or	fatter	than	you really	are.	That	also	goes	for	your	voice.	Learn	accents	because	advanced Voice	DNA	technology	is	willing	and	able	to	turn	you	in. 	7. 	Radar	-	This	is	the	expensive	option.	But	at	thirty	thousand	feet, you’re	not	going	to	see	a	drone	without	expensive	equipment	and	if you’re	dropping	money	like	Ebenezer	Scrooge,	well	you	might	as	well	go all	the	way. 	Even	if	you	were	to	step	outdoors	and	see	a	trail	from	a	jet	liner,	it will	be	as	a	tiny	sliver	even	on	a	clear,	sunny	day.	Rain	and	fog?	Forget	it. So	you	need	radar	installations	that	are	secret	enough	to	evade	enemy detection	but	close	enough	to	see	the	enemy.	Quite	the	catch-22. Detecting	the	drone	is	easier	than	detecting	it	anonymously.	There	are CO2	infrared	lasers	you	can	buy	from	various	internet	outlets.   	8. 	Civilian	Patriots	-	Obvious	perhaps,	as	there	are	over	a	million gun	owners	in	North	America,	but	it	is	unlikely	that	drones	will	be	turned against	the	populace	en	masse	anytime	soon	since	they	must	be	rearmed and	refueled,	and	a	patriotic	force	would	seize	this	opportunity	to	string the	pilots	up	from	the	nearest	tree.	And	believe	me,	they	would	find	them quickly. 	But	drone	 spying	is	different	than	a	drone	 firing.	And	in	the	end, perhaps	that	is	really	all	they	want	-	to	launch	a	hundred	thousand drones	to	spy	on	everyone	without	ever	firing	a	shot,	because	when	you know	where	someone	is	24 7,	what	restaurant	they	eat	at,	what ballgames	they	attend	and	whether	they	put	their	ketchup	on	top	of	their fries	or	on	the	side,	well,	they	don’t	really	need	to	fire	from	the	skies,	do they?   Online	Footprints  The	NSA	collects	IP	addresses	like	ants	collect	food.	It’s	a	nice analogy,	isn’t	it?	They	store	whatever	they	can	get,	usually	from	apps	that bypass	security	and	provide	you	with	convenience.	Apple	and	Samsung made	their	fortunes	this	way	-	convenience	above	all.	Thus	many	phone apps	not	only	send	your	IP	address	which	is	correlated	with	Facebook and	Skype,	but	your	login	locations:	cafes,	libraries,	etc.,	with	the	times you	did.	Thus	everyone’s	digital	fingerprint	is	stored.	Well,	most	people’s. If	you’re	one	of	the	ones	that	are	tracked,	read	on,	because	we’re	about	to put	a	stop	to	that	nonsense. Fortunately,	an	IP	address	is	not	a	person	 yet.	On	that	topic,	ask yourself	this:	how	might	their	power	be	enhanced	if	everyone	did	have their	own	unique	number,	say	like	those	in	Germany,	1938?	To	login?	To send	email?	To	play	online	games? I	walked	into	a	free	WiFi	on	a	trip	to	California	a	few	years	back.	A few	kids	had	managed	to	play	World	of	Warcraft	despite	the	posted	rules of	NO	GAMING	during	school	hours.	Well,	the	NSA	certainly	knows	which games	their	playing,	and	who	played	them	at	which	hour	if	they	decide	to go	the	subpoena	route.	This	is	how	the	NSA	finds	people	who	want	to disappear. People	on	the	run	forget	the	digital	trail	they’ve	already	established for	years.	The	NSA	hasn’t.	Sites	you’ve	visited.	Calls	you’ve	made.	Friends you’ve	unfriended.	They	know	about	them	all.	So	if	you	want	to	put	an end	to	this,	you	must	forge	a	new	identity	that	muddles	up	the	former digital	you. And	no,	turning	off	the	cell	won’t	help.	Neither	will	popping	out	the SIM	because	the	NSA	already	has	the	network	map	for	that	WiFi	area. The	only	exception	to	this	would	be	if	you	were	in	Syria. 	Bin	Laden’s	Courier Sheikh	Abu	Ahmed	was	not	an	easy	man	to	find.	The	CIA	spent	a year	tracking	him	down,	and	Bin	Laden’s	rule	of	no	calls	or	laptops	made   it	all	the	more	difficult.	So	difficult	in	fact,	that	they	had	to	rely	on	getting intel	out	of	prisoners. The	big	break,	however,	came	in	2010	when	Ahmed	broke	Bin Laden’s	rule	by	talking	about	him	on,	you	guessed	it,	a	 cell	 phone. Intelligence	agencies	were	already	monitoring	who	he	was	talking	to. When	Bin	Laden’s	name	came	up,	the	call	led	them	straight	to	the Pakistani	town	called	Abbottabad. You	probably	know	the	rest. Soon	thereafter,	Navy	SEALs	stormed	the	compound	with	18	foot walls	and	barbed	wire.	They	were	in	and	out	in	under	40	minutes	and met	little	resistance.	There	were	no	guards	or	schedules.	No	guard	dogs. No	field	of	tripmines	and	no	Barrett	.50	caliber	guns	to	worry	about.	Not much	in	the	way	of	fortification	that	couldn’t	be	easily	defeated	with	a moderately	trained	infantry.	Or	a	sledgehammer	in	the	case	of	one	SEAL. The	takeaway	here	is	that	you	don’t	want	to	draw	attention	to yourself	by	being	loud.	If	you	want	to	truly	disappear,	don’t	be	a	bar braggart.	Bin	Laden,	for	all	his	demonic	activity,	had	this	part	right.	C4	is loud.	Mines	are	suicidal.	Tripwires	can	kill	your	own	and	sentry	guards are	visible	from	the	sky.	They’re	also	notoriously	loose-lipped	as	they gossip	to	kill	time. Despite	knowing	all	this,	I	watched	Zero	Dark	Thirty	expecting	the worst.	I	facepalmed	several	times	due	to	how	loud	the	actors	playing	the Navy	SEALs	were. “Shut	up	you	fools	or	someone’ll	hear!	Stop	chattering!” Bin	laden	was	smart.	Prime	evil,	but	smart. Chatter	breaks	anonymity	faster	than	a	maggot	spoils	rotten	meat, and	sometimes	Hollywood	gets	it	wrong.	Those	SEALS	 the	real	ones  knew	how	to	be	silent.	In	fact	it’s	the	very	thing	they	do	best.	They’d prefer	to	get	in	and	out	and	 then	blow	the	place	sky	high…	as	they’re running	to	the	beach. If	there	is	one	thing	that	will	put	a	silver	bullet	in	your	disappearing act,	it’s	blabbing	about	your	old	life. “I	sure	showed	the	IRS!	Those	turkeys	won’t	bother	me	ever	again!” you	say	just	a	little	too	loudly	in	Bangkok,	piquing	the	interest	of	a former	IRS	tax	agent	a	few	stools	down. Bottom	line:	You	should	value	your	new	identity	as	though	it	were   your	life,	because,	well,	it	is.	Treat	it	as	such.	Loose	lips	and	all. 	Restrict	Physical	Access Never	trust	anyone	with	your	laptop	overseas.	If	you	loan	it	out, ensure	you’re	there	as	they	use	it. Inside	your	laptop	lies	the	heart	and	soul	of	your	business.	Break	it off	with	a	vengeful	Thai	girl	and	she	can	do	a	lot	more	than	just	the battery-acid-to-the-face	on	the	other	girl.	She	can	ruin	you.	Thus,	you must	encrypt	your	operating	system.	You	needn’t	go	as	far	as	Bin	Laden did	and	avoid	laptops	altogether,	but	you	need	to	be	aware	that	comfort breeds	mistakes,	and	costly	ones	at	that. If	you’re	a	freelancer,	an	author,	or	just	have	an	online	side	hustle, guard	your	passwords	and	pen	names	like	they	were	the	keys	to	Heaven itself.	Never	give	too	many	details,	especially	to	strangers.	Last	thing	you want	is	a	string	of	bad	 fake 	reviews	from	every	one	of	her	Thai brothers	calling	you	a	white	hot	ball	of	canine	terror	who	plagiarizes	and eats	freckled	pigtailed	girls. Want	to	stay	invisible?	Don’t	give	out	your	last	name. 	Preserve	Your	Reputation Ever	watch	Game	of	Thrones?	I	did,	right	up	until	they	offed	poor Ned	at	the	end	of	Season	1.	But	a	line	from	Tyrell	stuck	with	me:	A Lannister	always	pays	his	debts.	So	should	you.	And	no	I	don’t	mean	your student	loans.	I	mean	debts	to	friends	and	family	and	other	alliances, other	businesses.	Local,	unpaid	debts	make	enemies	 fast.	Enemies	can poor	a	can	of	puke-yellow	paint	all	over	your	invisibility	act.	Imagine poor	Bilbo	standing	there	in	front	of	all	those	guests	covered	in	yellow goop.	Cut	Them	Loose This	means	cutting	loose	someone	who	is	unstable	and	detrimental to	your	stability	-	the	same	stability	you	worked	hard	to	obtain. Financially	unstable	people	tend	to	borrow	without	asking.	Mentally unstable	people	tend	to	embarrass	and	stalk	until	you	until	your	house	is burning	down	to	the	riff	of	Ozzy. This	requires	saying	no.	In	some	cases	it	requires	firing	someone	in   your	life	who	makes	a	lot	of	noise	flapping	their	gums	 remember	Bin Laden’s	courier? .	A	maid	with	sticky	fingers,	too,	can	be	catastrophic, but	still	easier	to	fire	than	your	live-in	girlfriend.	Better	to	suffer	a bruised	ego	for	a	day	than	lose	a	business…	and	clients. When	I	dated	a	filipina	in	Dumaguete,	it	was	expected	of	me	to	bring a	gift	to	her	brother’s	birthday	party.	She	wanted	me	to	buy	him	an	Ipad. I	nearly	choked	to	death	on	my	cashews. “Can’t	you	afford	it?”	she	slyly	asked.	“Sure	can.	But	I’m	not	your white	ATM,”	I	sternly	replied. I	hurt	her	feelings,	true	enough,	but	spared	myself	the	expense	of buying	all	her	relatives	electronic	gadgets	that	cost	$300-400	per	item	on all	future	social	engagements.	Later	I	found	this	to	be	common	no	matter where	one	is	in	the	Philippines.	They	all	think	you’re	rich	if	you	are	there since	a	plane	ticket	costs	an	arm	and	a	leg. Yep,	if	you	can	pay	a	grand	for	a	ticket	to	Asia,	you’re	rich	buddy.	Bill Gates	rich. 	Risky	Friendships When	you	are	a	stranger	in	a	strange	land,	it	can	be	tempting	to accept	any	and	all	friendships	that	fall	into	your	lap.	You’ve	got	a	shiny new	identity.	You	feel	more	alive	than	ever	before.	No	debts.	No	criminal past.	No	angry	ex	looking	to	string	you	up	from	the	nearest	tree	if	you don’t	fork	over	two	grand	by	the	end	of	the	month. Then	you	meet	someone	at	a	convention	and	offer	a	beer	after	you forge	a	connection.	He	smiles	with	a	row	of	perfect	teeth.	Nods	and hmms	and	offers	expert	marketing	advice.	You	think,	“Gee,	this	guy appears	to	be	intelligent	and	business-minded.	I	like	him.	Could	make	for a	decent	business	partner.” After	all,	you	could	always	use	more	clients	as	a	digital	nomad, right?	Only	later	you	find	out	he	runs	a	tranny	dating	website	for	Thais and	wants	you	to	“meet	someone	to	discuss	better	ways	to	attract clientele.” I’m	sure	you	know	the	risks	of	such	a	scenario.   Snowden’s	Mistakes Edward	Snowden. The	man	is	an	interesting	character	study	as	to	how	far	a	single human	will	go	on	personal	ethics	alone. He	had	insisted	from	the	very	beginning	that	he	believed	the	NSA’s surveillance	programs	to	be	in	violation	of	the	U.S.	Constitution,	and	that the	people	who	founded	that	Constitution	ought	to	know	about	them. Nothing	good,	he	said,	ever	came	from	keeping	tax-funded	programs	in the	dark	from	the	taxpayers	themselves. He	also	claimed	that	he	never	intended	to	hide	his	identity	 after running	of	course .	What	can	we	learn	from	his	mistakes?	What	not	to	do if	we	decide	to	disappear? 	Mistake	1:	Moscow It	was	WikiLeaks	founder	Julian	Assange	that	provided	for Snowden’s	stay	in	Hong	Kong,	even	recommending	that	he	not	go	to South	America	on	account	of	the	physical	danger	to	himself.	Not	that	the place	is	paradise	since	the	general	instability	of	the	area	makes	for	a miserable	experience	in	a	lot	of	cities,	cartels	included. So	as	luck	would	have	it,	he	ended	up	in	Russia	when	his	passport was	yanked. And	it	isn’t	even	what	Snowden	said	that	is	most	appealing	to	the Russians.	Rather,	it’s	what	he	did	not	say	-	those	unwritten,	unspoken matrix	of	secrets	that	are	a	veritable	gold	mine	for	Russian	Intelligence. It’s	a	good	bet	that	if	Washington	ever	offers	him	a	plea	deal	and	allows him	back	on	American	soil,	we	will	see	the	same	stalling	behavior	we	saw with	Putin’s	decision.	They’ll	not	give	him	up	so	easily.	Quite	the	catch- 22. 	Mistake	2:	One	Passport With	the	kind	of	security	clearance	Edward	had,	getting	a	second passport	in	a	country	friendly	to	the	United	States	should	have	been	easy   peasy.	Yes,	said	country	would	certainly	have	handed	him	over,	but	not without	at	least	a	delay	that	might	have	granted	him	more	time.	The	U.S. government	will	know	it	if	you	do,	but	it	is	not	a	foregone	conclusion	that they	would	be	revoked	simultaneously.	If	that	were	the	case,	we’d	all	be living	under	One	Government	by	now	 Thank	Heaven	for	small	miracles . 	Mistake	3:	Facetime Facetime	kills	anonymity	quicker	than	anything	else.	This	nail	in	the coffin	had	a	two	prong	effect:	The	first	being	that	of	honesty.	Snowden could	address	the	American	public	without	there	being	any	doubt	to	the validity	of	his	identity.	If	he’d	stayed	anonymous,	he’d	have	always struggled	with	proving	who	he	was	and	that	his	words	rung	true. The	mistake	of	course	comes	in	on	that	second	effect:	The	FBI	now knew	his	face.	Eventually	the	NSA	would	have	nailed	him	even	if	he hadn’t	gone	public,	but	it	might	have	given	him	more	time	since Snowden’s	appeal	could	very	well	have	dragged	out	any	extradition request.Takeaway:	Don’t	flee	to	a	country	that	will	do	you	more	harm	than the	country	you	are	fleeing	 from.	True,	we	see	Edward	as	living	a somewhat	normal,	if	modest	life	in	that	sprawling	ex-Soviet	country… but	that	life	may	one	day	be	short	lived. When	the	dust	settles,	and	the	interviews	by	comedians	cease,	and we	no	longer	hear	of	Snowden	or	WikiLeaks,	we	might	just	have	missed the	disappearing	act	of	Putin	deciding	to	be	a	little	more	forceful	in gaining	access	to	that	vault	of	secrets	between	Edward’s	ears.	Don’t	let that	be	you.   Technology  Defeating	Facial	Recognition I‘m	not	Spiderman,	and	I’d	wager	you’re	not	Quicksilver	from	the	X- Men	 mutant	kid	who	can	run	200mph	and	push	bullets	around	like Skittles .Let’s	be	honest	for	a	moment.	I	don’t	care	for	the	government	using much	of	any	kind	of	facial-scan	technology	to	measure	how	many	steps	it takes	me	to	go	to	the	gym	or	if	I’m	whistling	a	copyrighted	tune	out	of	my backside	after	eating	a	bowl	of	Chocolate	Frosted	Sugar	Bombs. Nor	can	I	 legally,	anyway 	take	a	double-bladed	axe	to	all	of	the traffic	cams	in	the	city	where	I	live.	So	what	can	I	do?	What	can	you	do? First	off,	let’s	not	panic	since	we	have	some	credible	legal	options. Let’s	also	discuss	what	it	is	and	what	it	is	not	and	where	it	is	going	to	be	a decade	out. Facial	recognition	is	not	Star	Trek	technology,	nor	is	it	a	perfect	way to	spot	a	kidnapper	or	merely	spy	on	Uncle	Frick.	And	rest	assured	that for	the	rest	of	us,	there	are	flaws	that	can	be	exploited.	When	you	hear about	facial	recognition	technology	such	as	that	used	by	social	networks, what	they	really	refer	to	is	the	techniques	used	to	identify	a	photo	or	a moving	face	in	a	reel	of	film.	The	algorithms	target	spacial	differences and	anomalies	along	your	face:	how	far	the	chin	protrudes,	how	far	the eyes	are	apart,	the	biometrics	of	the	ears	and	so	forth.	Does	she	have Asian	features?	Russian	cheekbones	and	nose?	Indonesian	lips?	There are	almost	a	hundred	nodes	along	a	human	face	for	an	algorithm	to	work with.	That	doesn’t	sound	so	bad. Only	the	bad	news	is	that	it	only	takes	20	or	so	nodes	relative	to	a man	or	woman’s	face	to	be	identified.	If	a	satellite	can	identify	a	person’s brand	of	shoe	from	low	orbit,	you	can	imagine	how	easy	it	would	be	to size	up	a	person’s	face	and	match	that	with	a	database. The	good	news	is	that	even	mathematical	algorithms	can	be	tricked. Take	Google	for	example.	Google	spends	billions	on	its	algorithms	and   much	less	on	its	programmers,	which	coincidentally	happen	to	be	some of	the	best	on	Earth,	yet	it	is	often	simple	techniques	blackhat	marketers use	to	fool	the	engine	into	thinking	data	is	relevant	when	it	really	isn’t.	A false	positive,	to	say.	Google	coders	adapt	the	code.	The	blackhatters catch	on.	Word	spreads	around	the	hive	mind	and	they	adapt	as	well. 	Look	At	Your	Feet Alex	Kilpatrick	is	a	facial-recognition	expert	and	research	leader	at the	TIS	 Tactical	Info	Systems 	in	Texas.	He	did	an	interview	for	the	BBC where	he	talked	about	simple	ways	to	defeat	these	systems.	One	being: Look	at	your	feet.	This	obscures	your	identity	in	ways	the	cameras	can’t account	for.	And	yes,	you	guessed	right	if	you	said	the	homeless	have	the advantage	here. When	I	was	a	student	at	Loyola	University	in	New	Orleans,	donating my	plasma	kept	my	belly	full	on	a	few	hard	months	as	I	awaited	the arrival	of	my	student	loan	check.	Lots	of	students	did	this.	Selling	plasma was	like	selling	gold	when	you	were	starving	and	I	could	think	of	a	lot	of other	bodily	fluids	that	might	prove	embarrassing	to	sell. Well	as	fate	would	have	it,	I	had	to	bus	it	down	to	the	plasma	center once	when	my	car	engine	went	kaput.	Buses	in	New	Orleans	were something	I	absolutely	dreaded.	I	had	to	walk	a	block	or	so	down	Canal Street,	aka	Bum	Central.	It	was	an	educational	walk. But	it	was	no	short	walk.	And	I	recall	bringing	my	psychology	book along	on	the	RTA	route	to	kill	time.	I’d	occasionally	look	up,	grinning	at how	in	sync	the	bums	and	winos	walks	would	be:	Jazzy	yet	almost	in tune	with	each	other. You’ve	seen	it	no	doubt…	Head	down	over	a	long	beard,	shotglass	of bourbon	and	swaggering.	I	came	to	admire	them	for	their	stealthy	way	of blending	into	the	trashy	panoramic	atmosphere.	The	entire	street	had several	theaters	back	then	and	I’d	see	them	hawk	and	hork	and	spit	and panhandle	and	all	the	while	barely	raising	their	eyes	to	speak	to	honest Johns.	Some	of	them	even	wore	sunglasses. 	Sunglasses	Don’t	Work Perhaps	a	few	bums	wanted	to	be	trendy	bums.	But	the	problem with	wearing	shades	in	order	to	fool	surveillance	cams	is	that	the   algorithm	will	simply	ignore	that	section	of	your	face	and	focus	more intensely	on	other	parts	of	it.	In	fact	I’d	say	judging	from	the	research done	by	the	Chinese	on	facial	recognition	systems,	it	doesn’t	matter	how big	the	glasses	are,	either. 	Obnoxious	Clothing	DOES	Work If	you’ve	got	a	few	articles	of	clothing	with	pictures	of	other	people’s faces	on	it,	that	will	disrupt	the	algorithm	in	the	same	way	billboards disrupt	Google	Earth’s	Street	View	algorithm	that	tries	to	smear	real people’s	faces	on	the	street	for	privacy. Clothing	like	this:  Or	this:   You	don’t	necessarily	need	to	go	with	a	“face	shirt”	either,	but	the image	below	is	probably	a	stretch	for	society	to	accept:   Helmets Speaking	of	what	society	tolerates	and	what	it	doesn’t,	a	beard	and hat	disguise	is	probably	better	than	wearing	a	helmet	for	too	long.	A friend	of	mine	remarked	that	he	wears	a	full-face	helmet	whenever	he rides	a	Ninja.	Keeps	the	bugs	out	of	his	hair,	he	says,	but	when	he	tries	to pump	gasoline	while	wearing	it,	the	gas	attendant	won’t	turn	on	the pumps	until	he	takes	it	off. Well,	no	wet-behind-the-ears	teenager	is	going	to	tell	him	what	to do,	so	off	he	goes	to	another	gas	station.	An	Exxon	this	time.	The	end result:	Same	thing.	He	found	out	that	the	owners	of	these	gas	stations like	to	have	a	biker’s	face	on	the	camera	in	case	the	police	come	by asking	about	a	kidnapped	little	girl. 	IR	LEDs Remember	that	what	facial	recognition	systems	zero-in	on	is relative	triangles,	such	as	the	tip	of	your	nose	to	the	bottom	of	your	chin and	over	to	your	ears,	or	from	your	chin	to	your	forehead	and	over	to your	eyes.	You’re	unique	in	this	way	just	as	your	fingerprints	are	unique. No	two	people	are	the	same. But	an	IR	LEDs	will	disrupt	this	greatly.	We	discussed	laser	pointers disrupting	instruments	on	jets.	Well	the	same	principle	applies	here,	and I	predict	this	will	find	its	way	into	our	clothing	styles	in	the	coming	years whether	we	like	it	or	not,	depending	on	how	invasive	Big	Brother’s systems	become	in	the	next	decade. The	downside	is	that	it	doesn’t	work	unless	everyone	is	doing	it since	by	using	this	you	will	clearly	stand	out	on	a	monitor.	Some celebrities	used	to	wear use	these	to	discourage	the	paparazzi	whenever they’d	come	sniffing.	It	was	set	off	by	a	camera	flash	and	the	results	were not	quite	what	they’d	hoped. Then	again,	the	antivirus	company	AVG	is	reportedly	working	on	so- called	“invisibility	glasses”	that	thwart	facial	software	altogether.	It	uses LEDs	that	move	around	the	eyes	and	nose	which	distort	any	images	the system	takes	for	the	purpose	of	recognizing	you.   Unfortunately	it’s	only	in	the	beginning	stages	at	this	point,	but	I believe	this	is	only	the	tip	of	the	iceberg.	Can	Frodo’s	elvish	cloak	be	far behind?	College	Dorms These	are	the	absolute	 worst	for	privacy.	At	Loyola	University during	my	junior	year,	I	as	well	as	every	other	resident	of	the	Cabra	Hall residence	had	to	show	our	IDs	every	single	time	we	entered	to	the	desk attendant.	It	didn’t	matter	if	we’d	spoken	to	said	attendant	a	thousand times	that	day	or	 heaven	forbid 	we	were	related	to	her.	Neither	did	it matter	if	we	swiped	the	card	without	an	error. Nope.	Every	single	time	we	walked	through	the	front	double-steel doors	to	that	fortress	of	doom,	we	got	the	“Papers	please!”	spiel. Only	one	time	the	grad	student	behind	the	dusty	counter	caught	me on	a	bad	day	after	a	hard	rain	and	a	failed	calculus	test,	and	I	refused.	For a	nanosecond	I	even	considered	flipping	her	off.	But	no,	that’d	too	rude even	for	me	as	well	as	granting	her	that	power	of	attention	she	craved. So	I	just	walked	right	by	her	as	though	I’d	swallowed	an	invisibility potion.She	didn’t	like	that,	and	the	next	time	I	came	around	at	dinnertime about	7	o’clock,	she	lashed	out	at	me	with	a	few	insults	she’d	brewed	in my	absence.	Not	only	that,	her	face	changed	right	before	my	eyes,	going   from	conservative	librarian	girl	with	glasses	and	cinnamon	latte	to	a gorgon’s	daughter	looking	for	fresh	meat. That	was	it.	I	got	pretty	steamed	myself	and	so	I	frisbeed	the	ID	at her	like	that	feral	kid	with	the	boomerang	in	Road	Warrior	-	so	fast	I thought	it’d	put	her	eye	out.	It	struck	her	forehead	dead	center	before flipping	away,	over	her	desk	and	down	her	arm	and	into	her	bookbag. Next	thing	I	knew	I’m	in	the	resident	manager’s	office	justifying	my terrorist-like	actions.	But	more	shocking	than	this	was	that	he	had	my midterm	grades	on	a	Matrix-green	computer	screen	in	front	of	him. I	didn’t	enjoy	sitting	it	out	a	semester.   Charting	a	New	Course It	could	be	that	you	want	to	disappear	for	non-criminal	reasons.	You don’t	have	any	debt.	You	simply	want	to	get	away	to	start	a	new	chapter in	life.	Wipe	the	soul-draining	high	school	slate	clean	and	build	anew. Become	a	French	artist.	Maybe	a	trainer	of	wind	surfers	in	Bora	Bora, watching	fire	dancers	twirl	flame	every	night	as	the	sun	sinks	down while	three	filipinas	you’ve	never	met	are	eying	you	up	and	down	from the	water. 	  Maybe	you	want	to	be	a	boat	tour	guide	in	the	Philippines	that brings	all	the	newly	minted	expats	out	to	see	the	whale	feedings	while exotic	filipinas	coo	over	your	white	skin	 I	saw	with	my	own	eyes	how obsessed	filipinas	are	with	with	this	-	entire	aisles	in	pharmacies	filled with	skin-whitening	products.    Memories	often	make	the	man,	but	if	you	get	rid	of	the	things,	that is,	the	settings,	the	people,	the	jobs,	the	polluted	air,	that	miserable dragon-breathing	boss	named	Winona	who	works	in	HR,	well	you	just have	no	idea	what	gifts	await	you	on	the	other	side.	Just	do	it. It’s	not	the	things	we	did	in	life	that	we	regret	on	our	death	beds,	but the	things	we	never	took	up.	Those	procrastinations	that	we	kept	waving back	into	the	horizon,	over	and	over,	never	taking	action.	Forever	leaving it	to	some	other	guy	to	step	out	of	the	safe	zone. When	I	lived	in	a	small	town	in	Louisiana	many	years	ago,	I	kept running	into	old	girlfriends.	Old	high	school	chums.	Old	sluts.	Old memories	that	dragged	me	down	like	the	girl	I’d	never	asked	out	who was	now	the	woman	in	the	red	dress,	a	wall	survivor	now	hitched	to	the mayor.Life’s	little	moments	like	these	made	a	habit	of	creeping	up	on	me like	a	flow	of	lava	does	a	small	sleepy	town	in	Hawaii.	Moments	that	I never	thought	I’d	be	reminded	of	day	in,	day	out,	slowly	devouring	me like	lava	embers	do	straw	huts.	Slow	at	first,	warm	before	the	embrace, but	when	the	hit,	well.	They	melt	any	sense	of	adventure. So	I	made	a	break	for	a	clean	slate.	First	to	Canada,	then	to	SE	Asia. Don’t	just	dream	about	the	clean	slate.	Take	action.	Meditating	on your	dreams,	as	I’ve	discovered,	can	actually	prevent	them	from becoming	reality.	It’s	suboptimal	to	meditate	on	the	end	results	-	You sipping	margaritas	in	Bora	Bora.	That	only	works	if	you	meditate	on taking	active	steps	towards	making	the	dream	happen	in	the	first	place. So	don’t	meditate	on	the	end-result…You	must	visualize	yourself	working toward	the	dream,	mixing	the	reagents	that,	when	all	is	said	and	done,	is powerful	enough	to	give	you	wings. Are	you	a	writer?	Visualize	yourself	writing	at	the	keyboard, banging	out	five	thrilling	novels	per	year,	or	making	six	figures	by building	an	insanely	good	client	base	as	a	copywriter.   Afterword A	tough	question	I	repeatedly	asked	myself	when	I	was	overseas was	this:	Am	I	still	the	same	person	in	Dumaguete	that	I	was	in	New Orleans?	What	about	Toronto,	Canada? I	mean	I	acted	the	same,	very	laid	back	and	easy	to	approach,	almost too	easy	now	that	I	think	about	it.	I	ate	the	same	-	a	good	Mexican restaurant	with	cheese	enchiladas	and	salsa	with	a	side	of	guacamole with	Blue	Bell	Homemade	Vanilla	ice	cream	for	dessert.	I	even	smelled the	same	-	Midnight	and	Noir	cologne	since	the	day	they	arrived. Though	no	Mardi	Gras	or	beignets	were	anywhere	to	be	found	in	the Phils,	I	still	believed	in	the	same	God.	I’d	not	really	disappeared	so	much as	just	teleported,	I	feared,	just	as	Nightcrawler	did	in	so	many	comics, escaping	doom. Truly	becoming	invisible,	I	found,	involved	throwing	out	old grudges,	grudges	that	rot	the	spirit	and	the	mind.	Grudges,	I	later	found, that	not	only	cause	ulcers	but	rot	any	sense	of	risk	or	adventure.	We’re explorers	and	we	don’t	like	being	anchored	too	far	from	shore	without	a rowboat.	We	like	safety.	We	like	security.	But	sometimes	you	must	throw caution	to	the	wind	and	swim	for	it	completely	naked…	yes,	even	with sharks	lurking	about.	And	it	is	this	unknown	 How	many	sharks?	What kind?	Meat-o-sauruses? 	that	keeps	so	many	would-be	explorers	at	bay. The	key	to	overcoming	your	fear	is	courage.	Well,	that	and	a	little imagination. Envision	yourself	as	someone	else,	say,	a	storyteller	like	Bilbo Baggins,	tired	of	the	retched	relatives	squawking	like	harpies	over	who gets	what	if	he	croaks	one	midsummer	night.	Bilbo	the	wanderer.	Bilbo the	explorer. You	have	sufficient	gold	to	navigate	every	hillside,	every	culture, every	dragon’s	den.	You	can	visit	South	Korea	and	meet	the	most beautiful	people	on	Earth	and	all	with	a	clean	slate	since	no	one	knows	of your	mistakes.	Where	every	moment	is	now,	where	you	are	invisible,	yet visible.	Tokyo,	Thailand,	Philippines,	it’s	all	yours	for	the	taking.	Your   new	face	will	go	a	long	way	in	those	parts	of	the	world. So	go	and	take	action	to	make	it	real!   Conclusion Here	we	are	at	the	end	of	our	journey.	Thank	you	for	sticking	it through	to	the	end.	Hopefully	it	wasn’t	too	painful. If	you	liked	the	information	in	this	book	or	found	it	entertaining, then	please	take	a	moment	to	leave	a	review	so	others	can	learn	to protect	themselves	from	Big	Brother,	tyranny	and	other	evil-minded individual	 choice	 -	 and	 think taffers	 who	 dislike	 freedom	 and	 bureaucrats	can	make	better	decisions	than	you	can. May	God	Bless	and	Keep	You	On	Life’s	Journey!
