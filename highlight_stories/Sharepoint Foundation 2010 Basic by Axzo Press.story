B  Use prerequisites, a target student   description, course objectives, and a skills  inventory to properly set your expectations  for the course.   C  Re-key this course after class.       iv   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Topic A:  About the manual   ILT Series philosophy  Our manuals facilitate your learning by providing structured interaction with the  software itself. While we provide text to explain difficult concepts, the hands-on  activities are the focus of our courses. By paying close attention as your instructor leads  you through these activities, you will learn the skills and concepts effectively.  We believe strongly in the instructor-led class. During class, focus on your instructor.  Our manuals are designed and written to facilitate your interaction with your instructor,  and not to call attention to manuals themselves.  We believe in the basic approach of setting expectations, delivering instruction, and  providing summary and review afterwards. For this reason, lessons begin with  objectives and end with summaries. We also provide overall course objectives and a  course summary to provide both an introduction to and closure on the entire course.   Manual components  The manuals contain these major components:     Table of contents    Introduction    Units    Course summary    Glossary    Index   Each element is described below.   Table of contents  The table of contents acts as a learning roadmap.   Introduction  The introduction contains information about our training philosophy and our manual  components, features, and conventions. It contains target student, prerequisite,  objective, and setup information for the specific course.   Units  Units are the largest structural component of the course content. A unit begins with a  title page that lists objectives for each major subdivision, or topic, within the unit.  Within each topic, conceptual and explanatory information alternates with hands-on  activities. Units conclude with a summary comprising one paragraph for each topic, and  an independent practice activity that gives you an opportunity to practice the skills  you’ve learned.  The conceptual information takes the form of text paragraphs, exhibits, lists, and tables.  The activities are structured in two columns, one telling you what to do, the other  providing explanations, descriptions, and graphics.       Introduction   v   Course summary  This section provides a text summary of the entire course. It is useful for providing  closure at the end of the course. The course summary also indicates the next course in  this series, if there is one, and lists additional resources you might find useful as you  continue to learn about the software.   Glossary  The glossary provides definitions for all of the key terms used in this course.   Index  The index at the end of this manual makes it easy for you to find information about a  particular software component, feature, or concept.   Manual conventions  We’ve tried to keep the number of elements and the types of formatting to a minimum  in the manuals. This aids in clarity and makes the manuals more classically elegant  looking. But there are some conventions and icons you should know about.   Item  Italic text   Bold text   Code font  Longer strings of ►      code will look ►      like this.   Select bold item   Description  In conceptual text, indicates a new term or feature.   In unit summaries, indicates a key term or concept. In  an independent practice activity, indicates an explicit  item that you select, choose, or type.   Indicates code or syntax.   In the hands-on activities, any code that’s too long to fit  on a single line is divided into segments by one or more  continuation characters  ► . This code should be  entered as a continuous string of text.   In the left column of hands-on activities, bold sans-serif  text indicates an explicit item that you select, choose,  or type.   Keycaps like e   Indicate a key on the keyboard you must press.                                    vi   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Hands-on activities  The hands-on activities are the most important parts of our manuals. They are divided  into two primary columns. The “Here’s how” column gives short instructions to you  about what to do. The “Here’s why” column provides explanations, graphics, and  clarifications. Here’s a sample:   Do it!     A-1:  Creating a commission formula  Here’s how    1  Open Sales     2  Observe the contents of cell F4   Here’s why  This is an oversimplified sales compensation  worksheet. It shows sales totals, commissions,  and incentives for five sales reps.      The commission rate formulas use the name  “C_Rate” instead of a value for the commission  rate.   For these activities, we have provided a collection of data files designed to help you  learn each skill in a real-world business context. As you work through the activities, you  will modify and update these files. Of course, you might make a mistake and therefore  want to re-key the activity starting from scratch. To make it easy to start over, you will  rename each data file at the end of the first activity in which the file is modified. Our  convention for renaming files is to add the word “My” to the beginning of the file name.  In the above activity, for example, a file called “Sales” is being used for the first time.  At the end of this activity, you would save the file as “My sales,” thus leaving the  “Sales” file unchanged. If you make a mistake, you can start over using the original  “Sales” file.  In some activities, however, it might not be practical to rename the data file. If you want  to retry one of these activities, ask your instructor for a fresh copy of the original data  file.                Topic B:  Setting your expectations   Properly setting your expectations is essential to your success. This topic will help you  do that by providing:   Introduction   vii     Prerequisites for this course    A description of the target student    A list of the objectives for the course    A skills assessment for the course   Course prerequisites  Before taking this course, you should be familiar with personal computers and the use  of a keyboard and a mouse. Furthermore, this course assumes that you’ve completed the  following course or have equivalent experience:   It is helpful, but not required, that you have basic skills in the Microsoft Office 2010  suite. You can gain these skills by taking any of the following courses:     Windows 7: Basic     Word 2010: Basic    Excel 2010: Basic    Outlook 2010: Basic     InfoPath 2010: Basic   Target student  This course is designed for the user who has been assigned Contribute permissions to a  SharePoint Foundation Team Web site and needs to learn how to navigate and add  content to the site. You will learn how to work with lists and libraries and use  discussion boards, surveys, and blogs. You will learn also how to customize your  environment by changing and creating views and by configuring personal and regional  settings. In addition, you will learn how to configure alerts and subscribe to RSS feeds  to keep current on new site content.          viii   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Course objectives  These overall course objectives will give you an idea about what to expect from the  course. It is also possible that they will help you see that this course is not the right one  for you. If you think you either lack the prerequisite knowledge or already know most of  the subject matter to be covered, you should let your instructor know that you think you  are misplaced in the class.  After completing this course, you will know how to:     Navigate a SharePoint Foundation 2010 Team Web site.    Work with SharePoint Foundation lists  announcement, calendar, link, task, and   contact lists .   form libraries .     Use SharePoint Foundation libraries  document, picture, wiki page, asset, and     Communicate and share opinions with other team members by using discussion   boards, surveys, and blogs.     Change views and create personal views.    Modify personal SharePoint user information and set notifications on content.       Introduction   ix   Skills inventory  Use the following form to gauge your skill level entering the class. For each skill listed,  rate your familiarity from 1 to 5, with five being the most familiar. This is not a test.  Rather, it is intended to provide you with an idea of where you’re starting from at the  beginning of class. If you’re wholly unfamiliar with all the skills, you might not be  ready for the class. If you think you already understand all of the skills, you might need  to move on to the next course in the series. In either case, you should let your instructor  know as soon as possible.

The course requires that an Active  Directory Domain Controller, an Exchange server, and a SQL server be installed. In  addition, SharePoint must be installed and configured, and content must be created for  the activities. Due to the setup requirements, you will be unable to set up and re-key this  course on your own after class.       U n i t   1   Getting started   1–1   Unit time: 20 minutes   Complete this unit, and you’ll know how to:   A  Identify the components of, and navigate   through, the Microsoft SharePoint  Foundation 2010 environment.       1–2   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Topic A:  SharePoint Foundation sites   Explanation     Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 is a team collaboration system. It is the base  software in the SharePoint family of products. There are two SharePoint Server versions   Standard and Enterprise , which can be layered on top of SharePoint Foundation  SPF   to add features to your collaboration solution.   SharePoint Foundation 2010  You can use Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 to organize, manage, and share  information. The information is stored in a central location within a SQL Server  database. This information can be accessed by multiple users, regardless of their  geographical location. You can access this information by using either a Web browser  or various desktop applications, such as Microsoft Office 2010.  To view the information in a Web browser, you connect to a SharePoint site. A  SharePoint site is a collection of related Web pages where you can do such things as:     Post documents that you want to share or collaborate on with other users    Control the versions of the documents you create    Conduct discussions    Create events  calendar entries  and announcements to let the other users know   about team activities     Create libraries for storing documents, images, and forms    Create tasks and assign them to team members    Create contacts for storing information about team members    Schedule meetings and keep track your schedule   Although SPF works well for team collaboration, it isn’t a good platform to use as a  corporate portal or enterprise search solution. If you need either of these features, use  one of the two SharePoint Server 2010 products. SharePoint Server 2010 also includes a  publishing feature that allows you to create pages and publish them using workflow  forms.   The SharePoint hierarchy  A SharePoint Team site can have one or more subsites. These subsites can be further  organized into subsites. A site that does not have a parent site is called the top-level site.  This structure of a top-level site and its subsites is called a site collection, and the  structure is similar to the file and folder structure in Windows. Maintaining a  hierarchical structure helps you organize information.  For example, the fictional company Outlander Spices has a top-level Web site. The site  has subsites for the divisions, such as Sales, Support, and Acquisition. Each of these  sites is further organized into the sites for subdivisions, such as National Sales, Internet  Sales, and Technical Support. The hierarchy of sites and subsites is the site collection  for Outlander Spices. This site collection is shown in Exhibit 1-1.                Getting started   1–3      Exhibit 1-1: A site collection   Navigation  The SharePoint site window contains links you can click to navigate through and  between the content of your site and any subsites, as shown in Exhibit 1-2.       Navigate Up button  Browse   tab   Breadcrumbs  Top navigation bar  showing subsites   Left navigation bar  Quick Launch bar      Exhibit 1-2: Navigation tools in the SharePoint window   When the Browse tab is selected, as shown in Exhibit 1-2, breadcrumbs and the top  navigation bar are displayed.      Breadcrumbs are a series of links that show you where you are in the current   site’s hierarchy. Using the breadcrumb links, you can navigate through the  hierarchy, up to the home page of the current site.      The top navigation bar provides another way to navigate up to the home page of   the current site. The top navigation bar is sometimes referred to as global  navigation.                    1–4   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    The left navigation bar provides links to various content areas on the site. This bar is  often referred to as the Quick Launch bar and sometimes referred to as current  navigation. The Quick Launch bar might not contain links to all content on the site. To  view all content, click the All Site Content link at the bottom of the Quick Launch bar.  In addition to using the breadcrumbs and navigation bars, you can click the Navigate Up  button to display the hierarchy of the page you are viewing. The Navigate Up button  shows the hierarchy all the way up to the root site in the site collection. You click a link  in the hierarchy to navigate up. Whereas breadcrumbs show you the hierarchy of the  current site, the Navigate Up button displays the hierarchy of the entire site collection.    Navigating to a SharePoint site  To go to a SharePoint site:   1  Open a Web browser.   2  In the Address bar, enter the URL of your SharePoint site.  3  If prompted, enter your password and click OK.    Often, the SharePoint administrator will set the site up to authenticate using your  Windows user name and password, so you aren’t prompted to enter credentials. Instead,  the site automatically uses the credentials from your Windows login.    Here’s why  Where  is your unique student number.   A-1:  Navigating SharePoint sites  Here’s how    1  Log on to Windows 7 as   Student with a password of  !pass1234     2  Open Internet Explorer        3  In the Address bar, enter    http:  spfbasicsql-sp salesandmarketing     4  Observe the breadcrumbs   You are on the home page of the Sales and  Marketing site.         5  Click         The Navigate Up button.

Getting started   1–5         The Sales and Marketing site has three  subsites—Internet Sales, National Sales, and  Tradeshows.   To go to the home page of the Internet Sales  subsite. This is a Team site just like the Sales  and Marketing one.     7  Click your browser’s Back button        8  Observe the top navigation bar     9  Click Internet Sales    10  Click       Click Sales and Marketing   To navigate back to the Sales and Marketing  site’s home page.       11  Navigate to the National Sales   It is also a Team site.   home page    13  Navigate to the Tradeshows   This subsite is a blog site.     12  Navigate to the Sales and   Marketing home page   home page    14  Navigate to the Sales and   Marketing home page                                                 1–6   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic     15  Observe the Quick Launch bar                          Also referred to as “current navigation.”  This  bar contains links to content on the Sales and  Marketing site. Note that the Quick Launch bar  might not contain links to all content on the site.       To go to the Team Discussions page. There are  two items on the page.   To return to the Sales and Marketing site’s home  page.    16  Under Discussions, click   Team Discussion    17  Click Home    Getting started   1–7   Elements of a SharePoint site  A SharePoint site holds more than Web pages. It is a container that holds lists and  libraries and can have subsites. All SharePoint sites have common elements:      Lists — Used to store, share, and manage information. A list is similar to a   simple database or spreadsheet. The Discussion Boards and Surveys elements  are variations of the List element.     Libraries — Used to store, share, and manage files.     Views — Used to determine how list or library information will be displayed.  Views can be public  available for anyone to use  or private  available only to  the user who created the view .     Web parts — Used to build SharePoint pages. Web parts are the modular   building blocks of SharePoint pages.   The Ribbon  SharePoint 2010 uses a Ribbon interface similar to the one used in Microsoft Office  2010. The Ribbon displays menus and buttons you can use to accomplish tasks. The  Ribbon has several tabs, including Browse and Page. On some tabs, the buttons for  related commands or tasks are shown in groups. For instance, the tab shown in Exhibit  1-3 includes the Edit, Clipboard, Font, Paragraph, and Styles groups.   Similar to the Office Ribbon tabs, the SharePoint Ribbon tabs are context sensitive and  change based on where you are on the site and what task you are completing.  Sometimes the Ribbon isn’t large enough to display all the links for a particular set of  tasks. In those cases, there will be multiple tabs to switch between, such as the Editing  Tools  Format Text tab and the Editing Tools  Insert tab, shown in Exhibit 1-3.      Other  tabs   Editing Tools   Format Text  tab  active    Editing Tools    Insert tab   Exhibit 1-3: The Editing Tools  Format Text tab on the Ribbon in SharePoint      Explanation                  SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    1–8   Do it!

All Site Content     2  Observe the categories   By default, the Team site contains Document  Libraries, Picture Libraries, Lists, Discussion  Boards, Surveys, Sites and Workspaces, and a  Recycle Bin.    These items don’t have descriptions. The items  were created during class setup, and descriptions  weren’t entered.    To go to the Discussion on Market Research  page.       You navigated to a list element, so the Ribbon  displays two contextual tabs under List Tools:  Items and List.     Under List Tools.  The two List Tools tabs  contain buttons for performing common tasks  when you’re working with lists and list items.     3  Observe the following items:   Outlander Spices Forms,   Stock Photos,   Business Systems Manager  Implementation,   Sales Team Contacts,   Spice Price List,   Discussion on Market Research,  Internet Sales,   National Sales, and   Tradeshows     4  In the Quick Launch bar, click   Discussion on Market  Research     5  Observe the Ribbon tabs      6  Click the Items tab   Click the List tab     7  Go to the Sales and   Marketing home page     8  Close Internet Explorer                                        Unit summary: Getting started   Topic A   In this topic, you identified the components of a SharePoint Foundation 2010 site and  learned how to display the content on a SharePoint Team Web site.   Getting started   1–9   Independent practice activity  In this practice activity, you will go to a SharePoint Team site and navigate among  content areas on the site.    1  Open Internet Explorer.    2  Go to the Administration Team Web site at http:  spfbasicsql-sp administration.     3  How can you determine if this Web site has any subsites?   Observe the top navigation bar for links to the subsites.  In the Quick Launch bar, click All Site Content, and look under Sites and Workspaces.     4  Does this site have any subsites? What are they?   There are three subsites: Accounting, Human Resources, and Updates from the Admin Team.     5  Go to the Accounting subsite. What type of site is it?  It is a Team Web site, similar to the parent Administration site.     6  Return to the Administration site’s home page.    7  Go to the Human Resources subsite. What type of site is it?   It is a Team Web site, similar to the parent Administration site.     8  Return to the Administration site’s home page.    9  Go to the Updates from the Admin Team subsite. What type of site is it?   It is a blog site.    10  Return to the Administration site’s home page.   11  How can you get to the discussion boards on the site?   Click a discussion’s link on the Quick Launch bar.    12  Are there any discussion boards on the current site?   There is only the default Team Discussion board.     13  Are there any items in the Team Discussion board?   There are no items in the discussion.    14  Close Internet Explorer.          1–10   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic        U n i t   2   Lists   2–1   Unit time: 90 minutes   Complete this unit, and you’ll know how to:   A  Create and modify announcements.    B  Create and modify events.    C  Create and modify links.    D  Create and modify tasks.    E  Create, modify, and export contacts.    F  Delete and restore list items.        2–2   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Topic A:  Announcements  Explanation   Announcements are one of several types of lists available on SharePoint sites.   Overview of lists   A SharePoint list is simply a container used for collecting and organizing information  on a SharePoint site. As shown in Exhibit 2-1, in a list, information is organized into  rows. Each row is called a list item. The data for each list item is organized in columns.  The columns are referred to as properties, fields, or metadata.   Lists are the most common method for organizing information on a SharePoint site.  Links, tasks, discussions, announcements, and events are all examples of SharePoint  lists. If you’ve been assigned at least the Contribute permissions set on a site, you can  view, add, update, and delete list items and documents.   Column headings  List items  Add new  item link  Exhibit 2-1: A discussion list   Creating list items  To create a list item:   1  Display the list:            In the Quick Launch bar, under Lists, click the desired list.  In the Quick Launch bar, click All Site Content. Under Lists, click the  desired list.   2  Open the   - New Item dialog box:      Directly below the list, click the “Add new  ” link  such as “Add new   discussion” or “Add new announcement” .      Click the List Tools  Items tab and click New Item.   3  In the dialog box, enter data for the new list item.     The type of information you can enter varies depending on the type of list.   Fields with a red asterisk  *  are required. Exhibit 2-2 shows the dialog box used  for creating announcement items.

By  default, SharePoint Foundation keeps objects you’ve deleted in the Recycle Bin for 30  days. An example of the Recycle Bin, with deleted objects, is shown in Exhibit 2-9.   The list of deleted items displays the following information for each item:    Lists   2–25     The name of the deleted object    The original location of the object     Who created the object     The date and time the object was deleted     The size of the object   It’s important to note that the site administrator can change the number of days the  Recycle Bin stores objects, so you might want to ask what the value is for your site.  After 30 days, objects move to the administrator’s Recycle Bin and you must ask the  administrator to restore the objects for you.       Exhibit 2-9: The SharePoint Foundation Recycle Bin   To restore an object from the Recycle Bin:   1  In the Quick Launch bar, click Recycle Bin.  2  Check the box next to the object or objects you want to restore.  3  Click Restore Selection.  4  Click OK.

It is similar to a picture library, but  there are some important differences for users:     An asset library uses the Ribbon. A picture library does not.    When you upload multiple documents to an asset library, it uses the standard   Office document uploader, which allows you to browse your entire network. A  picture library uses the Microsoft Office Picture Manager, which requires you to  add Picture Shortcuts to navigate to locations other than My Pictures.     An asset library uses the image content type. A picture library uses the picture   content type.   –  The image content type doesn’t have a preview image URL field. The   picture content type does.   –  Both content types have Name, Title, Preview, Keywords, Comments, Date  Picture Taken, and Picture Size properties. The image content type also has  Author and Copyright properties.      An asset library doesn’t display thumbnails of pictures in searches. A picture   library does.   If you have Design or Full Control permissions, you can create asset libraries if you are  running SharePoint Server 2010. SharePoint Foundation 2010 doesn’t include asset  libraries as content you can create. However, wiki pages use asset libraries to store their  content. If you create a wiki library in SharePoint Foundation 2010, SPF will create an  asset library to store the content of your wiki pages.        Libraries   3–35   D-1:  Viewing the asset library for a wiki library  Here’s how    1  In the Quick Launch bar, click   Here’s why     Libraries     2  Click Site Assets        3  Click Sales Materials   To open the Sales Materials wiki library.     4  Click  Outside Sales   Where  is your assigned student number.

When an asset library is  open, the Ribbon includes the Library Tools   Documents tab. You can work with the files in  the asset library in ways similar to the ways you  work with files in a document library.   The Download a Copy button becomes  available. You can download a copy of this file  from the Site Assets library.      5  Click the Documents tab     6  Check logo02     7  Go to the Sales and Marketing      home page      Do it!                                 3–36   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Topic E:  Form libraries   Explanation     A form library is a document library that holds Microsoft InfoPath forms. You can use  forms to collect and display data in a structured format. For example, if team members  want to go on a vacation, they need to fill out a Leave Application form and specify  such information as the start and end dates for the leave, the type of leave  sick or  privilege , and the reason for the leave. These forms are stored as XML files in form  libraries.   Form libraries aren’t created on a new Team site by default. A user with Design or Full  Control permissions must create the library and add forms to it.   Filling out a form  If you are running SharePoint Foundation 2010, clients need Microsoft InfoPath  installed in order to fill out forms in a form library; otherwise, the form downloads to  their computers. If you are running SharePoint Server 2010, users can load many  InfoPath forms in their Web browsers without needing the Microsoft InfoPath  application installed.   To fill out a published form:  1  Open the form library.  2  On the Library Tools  Documents tab, click the arrow on the New Document   button. The forms that have been published and set as content types for the  library are listed. Select the desired form.   3  Next to the title of the form you want to fill out, click the down-arrow and   choose Edit in Microsoft InfoPath.   4  Fill out the form.  5  Choose File, Save. Specify a location and name for the file, and click Save.   E-1:  Filling out and saving a form  Here’s how    1  In the Quick Launch bar, under   Libraries, click Outlander  Spices Forms   Here’s why  This form library was created during class setup,  and it contains two forms. During class setup,  the forms were published to the SharePoint site  and set as content types for the library.      2  On the Library Tools  Documents  tab, click the New Document  arrow   There are two forms available in this library.         3  Choose Travel Request Form   The form opens in Microsoft InfoPath.   Do it!                       4  Fill out the form similar to the   following graphic   Use your assigned student information, and a  request date and departure date in the future.  Check Round trip to get the return information.   Libraries   3–37           5  On the File tab, click Save   By default, InfoPath saves completed forms in  the form library.     7  On the File tab, click Save As   You can also save a copy of the form on your  hard disk.     6  In the File Name box, type   Student Sales Meeting    Click Save     8  Navigate to your Documents   library   In the File name box, enter  Annual Sales Meeting  Travel Request     9  Click Save               You can now print or send a copy of the  completed form to others.                                         3–38   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Working with forms  In addition to saving the completed form to your computer, you can do the following  tasks:     Print the form.    Send the form through e-mail.    Create a file from the form.    Export the form.

B  Create personal views.       5–2   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Topic A:  Page views   Explanation     A view is a feature of SharePoint used to display information in various types of layouts.  There are two types of views—public and personal. A public view is available to all site  users, whereas a personal view is available only to the user who creates it. The default  public views available depend on the list or library you are working with. Most lists and  libraries contain a Standard view and a Datasheet view. Users with Design or Full  Control permissions can create additional public views.    Standard and Datasheet views  A Standard view is a tabular view, which presents information in columns and rows,  similar to a printed worksheet. The information cannot be edited in this view. A list  displayed in Standard view is shown in Exhibit 5-1.    Exhibit 5-1: A list in Standard view   A Datasheet view presents information in a similar column-and-row format, but the  information can be edited directly in the view. A list in Datasheet view is shown in  Exhibit 5-2.   Note: In order for SharePoint to display information in Datasheet view, a compatible  spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel 2010, must be installed. If a spreadsheet  program isn’t installed or the installed program isn’t compatible with SharePoint, an  error message will be displayed when you try to display the list or library in Datasheet  view.         Exhibit 5-2: A list in Datasheet view   Each list item might have more property fields than are shown in Datasheet view. If you  want to edit those fields, you will need to open the item itself for editing.    Do it!     A-1:  Using Standard and Datasheet views  Here’s how    1  Open Internet Explorer   Here’s why  Your home page should be set to your Site  Team site.     2  In the Quick Launch bar, under      List, click Tasks                         Views   5–3     3  Click the List Tools  List tab     4  Observe Standard view     5  Click         This list provides both Standard view and  Datasheet view.   Items aren’t directly editable. To edit an item,  you must open it for editing.   The information is displayed in a spreadsheet  format and can be edited.      6  For the “Submit expense report”   task, change % Complete to  50%   field     8  Click        7  Click outside the % Complete   To enter the percentage.     9  In the new row, enter the   following information:    You can press Tab to move between fields.   Some fields have drop-down lists that you can  use to make selections.

Calendar view  Some SharePoint content types include unique views. For example, the Calendar  content type includes Calendar view, which displays event items as part of a monthly  calendar. You can change the scope of Calendar view to display the events of a single  day or a week.    A-2:  Changing the scope of Calendar view   Here’s how    1  In the Quick Launch bar, under   Here’s why     Lists, click Calendar     2  Click the Calendar Tools    Calendar tab     3  Click     4  Click     5  Click               You can change the view’s scope by clicking the  Day, Week, and Month buttons.   To change the scope of Calendar view to a  single day.   To change the scope of Calendar view to a  week.    To return the view’s scope to a month.                         Views   5–5   Explanation     Gantt view  Similar to Calendar view, Gantt view displays items based on date columns. However,  Gantt view displays the items in a Gantt chart. As shown in Exhibit 5-3, a Gantt chart is  a horizontal bar chart showing the actual and projected amounts of time involved in  completing a particular task or project. In SharePoint Foundation, when you create a  Gantt view, each item is displayed as if it were a task in a larger project. By default,  project task lists use Gantt view.    Exhibit 5-3: Gantt view of a project task list      Do it!     A-3:  Observing a project task list in Gantt view  Here’s how    1  Go to the Sales and Marketing site   Here’s why       2  In the Quick Launch bar, under   Lists, click Business Systems  Manager Implementation   This is a project task list that was created during  class setup.     3  Observe the left pane   This is similar to Datasheet view.    You can modify and add items. You can resize  the pane, scroll the pane, and resize the columns.         4  Observe the right pane               In this pane, each project task item is shown in a  horizontal bar chart organized by start and due  date. You can scroll to the pane to view the later  dates.                                        5–6   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Sorting   Sorting is a feature that you can use to rearrange items in a view. You can sort items in  ascending or descending order based on any column. To sort items in a view, click the  down-arrow next to the heading of the column you want to sort by. The first two items  in the drop-down menu are your sort options.  Below that are the filtering options, if  they are available.  The sorting options will vary based on the content of the column.  Common option pairs are Ascending and Descending, A on Top and Z on Top, and  Smallest on Top and Largest on Top.   When a list or library is sorted by a particular column, the column heading will have an  arrow next to it. An up arrow indicates that the list is sorted by that column in ascending  order. A down arrow indicates that the list is sorted by that column in descending order.   A-4:  Sorting items in a view  Here’s how    1  In the Quick Launch bar, click   Here’s why     Lists     2  Click Spice Price List   To display the list.      3  Next to the “Price per unit”  column heading, click the  down-arrow     4  Choose Smallest on Top         To sort the list of spices from the least expensive  to the most expensive. An upward-pointing  arrow appears next to the “Price per unit”  column heading, indicating that the list is sorted  on that column in ascending order.     5  Sort the list by most expensive to      least expensive spices     6  Sort the list by Country of   origin, A on Top    The sorting order of most expensive to least  expensive is not maintained.    Explanation     Do it!                              Explanation     Views   5–7   Filtering   You can use filters in a view to hide items that you don’t want to see. A filtered list  displays only the rows that meet the criteria you specify for a column or columns. To  apply filters to a view, display a drop-down list by clicking the down-arrow next to the  heading of the column you want to filter by. The filter options are the values listed in  that column. Select the desired value to show items with only the selected value.   You can apply multiple column filters at the same time. When a list or library has a  filter applied, a funnel icon appears next to each column that has a filter applied.   Some lists, such as Tasks, have predefined filters or sorting options you can apply. To  select a predefined filter or sort, click the List Tools  List tab; then, from the Current  View drop-down list, select the desired option.

The SharePoint  administrator creates your user account, but you can then edit the information in it, such  as:     Your name    Your e-mail address    Your mobile phone number    A brief description about you    A link to a photo of you    The department you work in    Your job title    Your SIP address   SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol. It’s an Internet protocol used for live  communication between users. It’s available when SharePoint is used with Office  Communication Server  OCS .  The information in your user account is attached to your account, not to individual  SharePoint sites. If you edit your account information while logged onto one SharePoint  site, that information will be updated when you use the same account to log on to the  next site.   To edit your account’s personal information:   1  Log in to any SharePoint site.  2  In the upper-right corner, click the down-arrow next to your account name and   choose My Settings to display the User Information page.   3  Click Edit Item to open the Edit Personal Settings dialog box.  4  Enter or modify the data in the fields shown in Exhibit 6-1.  5  Click Save.

The name in the upper- right corner of the SharePoint window now  displays your name instead of “Student .”                                      Explanation     Account information and notifications   6–5   Regional settings  When you work for a company that has offices across a wide geographic area, you  might want to define settings specific for your region. You can specify:     Your locale, which determines the way the site displays numbers, dates, and the   time     Your time zone    The type of calendar you want and whether or not week numbers are shown in   the Date Navigator     An alternate calendar    Your work week    A 12-hour or 24-hour time format          SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    6–6   Do it!

It’s difficult and time  consuming to keep up with changes by simply browsing the site. To ensure that you  know of important changes, you can configure an alert, shown in Exhibit 6-2. Once  configured, an alert notifies you by e-mail of changes in a list or library or changes in a  specific item in a list or document in a library. Some SharePoint administrators will also  configure the site to allow SMS alerts. If you configure an SMS alert, SharePoint sends  a text message to your mobile phone.   Exhibit 6-2: Item alert options      Setting list item and library item alerts  To configure an alert so you are notified of changes in a specific list item or file:   1  Open the list or library containing the desired list item or file.  2  Open the title menu for the list item or file and choose Alert Me.  3  If desired, edit the default alert title.  4  Select a delivery method.  The SMS option will be grayed out unless your  SharePoint site administrator has configured the site to allow SMS alerts.    5  Select the type of change that will trigger an alert.    6  Select the desired frequency of alerts.  7  Click OK.

Your e-mail address is automatically entered  from your user account’s personal settings. By  default, SMS alerts aren’t configured on a site.  Your administrator must set them up.   This prevents SharePoint from sending you an  alert when you make a change.                                     6–10   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic      8  Observe the options for When To   Send Alerts   By default, you’ll be notified immediately  whenever a change is made.

Explanation     Account information and notifications   6–11   Setting list and library alerts  You can also set alerts to notify you of any changes within an entire list or library, not  just in specific items in a list or library. The alert options are similar to that of an  individual item alert, but list and library alerts include a Change Type option, as shown  in Exhibit 6-3.   To configure an alert on a list or library:   1  Open the list or library you want to be notified of changes in.  2  On the Library Tools  Library tab, click Alert Me.  3  If desired, edit the default alert title.  4  Select a delivery method.  The SMS option will be grayed out unless your  SharePoint site administrator has configured the site to allow SMS alerts.   5  Select the Change Type desired. You can be notified of all changes or be   notified when items are added, modified, or deleted.   6  Select the type of change that will trigger an alert.    7  Select the desired frequency of alerts.  8  Click OK.

Your e-mail address is automatically entered  from your user account’s personal settings. By  default, SMS alerts aren’t configured on a site.  Your administrator must set them up.   By default, an alert is triggered any time a  change is made in the library—either in the  library as a whole or in individual documents  within the library.   This prevents SharePoint from sending you an  alert when you make a change.   By default, you’ll be notified immediately  whenever a change is made. If you don’t want  that many e-mail alerts, you can configure daily  or weekly summaries instead.

If you haven’t already, you  will also receive messages informing you that a  change has been made in your partner’s contact  and in your document in Shared Documents.  You will also receive messages telling you that  documents have been added to the library.   The message provides details of your alert and  explains how to make changes.    You can tell that it has been edited; the original  is crossed out and the new information is shown  next to it.   It can take a while for the alerts to be processed.  You can come back and look at them during the  Independent Practice Activity if they haven’t all  arrived yet.      Do it!                                                       6–14   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Explanation      Modifying and deleting alerts   You can modify or delete any of the alerts you’ve created.    1  Go to the “My Alerts on this Site” page:     On any List Tools or Library Tools tab, click Alert Me and choose Manage   My Alerts.     From your user-account menu, choose My Settings and click My Alerts.  2  To delete an alert or multiple alerts, check their checkboxes and click Delete   Selected Alerts.

Account information and notifications   6–15   Topic C:  RSS feeds   Explanation     Really Simple Syndication  RSS  is a technology used to transmit information across  intranets and the Internet. Many Web sites use RSS feeds as a mechanism to keep their  users up-to-date on the latest site information or to deliver digital content such as  pictures, audio, and video. With an RSS feed, new content is downloaded to your  computer and can be viewed in a browser such as Internet Explorer or in other  compatible programs. SharePoint uses RSS technology to offer feeds on libraries, lists,  and other Web content such as blogs.    Viewing available feeds  You can view the RSS feeds available on any SharePoint page by navigating to the page  and then opening Internet Explorer’s “View feeds on this page” menu.    Do it!     C-1:  Viewing available feeds  Here’s how    1  In the Quick Launch bar, click   Shared Documents   Here’s why       2  Click the arrow on the RSS feed   button        3  Observe the list   To display the “View feeds on this page” menu.   There is one RSS feed available on this  SharePoint page.                      6–16   SharePoint Foundation 2010: Basic    Explanation   Subscribing to RSS feeds  When you configure an RSS feed to keep yourself up-to-date on Web content, this is  called subscribing to an RSS feed. To subscribe to a SharePoint list, library, or other  content type RSS feed, using Internet Explorer, follow these steps:   1  Go to the Web page you want to subscribe to.  2  On the List or Library tab  under Library Tools , click the RSS Feed button.   For pages without a tab, there might be an Actions menu, from which you can    choose View RSS Feed. You also might find an RSS Feed link on the Web page  you want to subscribe to. Another option is to choose the feed from the “View  feeds on this page” menu.    3  Click “Subscribe to this feed.”  4  In the Subscribe to this Feed dialog box, shown in Exhibit 6-4, do any of the   following:     Edit the default name.    Change the default folder.    Check Add to Favorites Bar.   5  Click Subscribe.
