In particular, Steve Anglin to whom I  first presented this book as an idea; Mark Powers who was there every step of the way coordinating the work;  as well as Matthew Moodie and Tri Phan, both of whom helped me maintain the technical accuracy of the  book.  I would also like to thank all the customers and colleagues with whom I’ve had the pleasure to work   with throughout the years. Without all their questions and problems they faced, I would have never  discovered many of the solutions and techniques described in this book.  Finally, I would like to thank the entire community behind the Django framework for putting together  one the best web application frameworks on the market. Without their endless amount of work, the Django  framework and this book would not have come to light.  xxv   Introduction  The web framework market is an extremely competitive environment, with many programming languages  and framework design philosophies to choose from. But if you need to build web-based software with quick  turnaround times and a scripting language, there’s a high probability the Django framework – or something  built with it – will be your top choice.  Django has competitors, but even its nearest competitor in the Python ecosystem, the Flask framework   has about one-fourth the mind share of Django, based on the benchmark of worldwide Google searches  made for Django vs. Flask.1 Outside the Python ecosystem, but still in the scripting language segment, the  Ruby on Rails framework – which emerged along the same time as Django and follows a similar design  philosophy – has always maintained an almost equal mind share with Django, as it can also be proven by the  amount of worldwide Google search activity.  So what makes the Django framework such a strong choice for web development? It provides a rapid   development foundation to create complex web applications. A rapidness that is provided by a modular  and simple philosophy of not repeating constructs and logic throughout a project’s structure  a.k.a. the DRY  principle or Don’t Repeat Yourself principle .  And it’s this DRY principle, which has given way to a thriving community, as well as a multitude of   packages and other frameworks based on the Django framework. Over 10 years after its initial release, there’s  now a full-fledged CMS  Content Management System , a turn-key e-commerce platform and over 3000  packages, all built or designed to work with the Django framework. Not to mention, there are two annual  conferences in the United States and Europe to showcase Django innovations.  This book will walk you through the many core concepts associated with the Django framework. It will  help you learn standard and best practices that are essential to creating effective Django projects. And if and  when you use a Django-based package or framework, these same foundations will help you navigate the  more complex concepts and avoid any blind spots that are part of the core Django framework.  1https:  g.co trends yXpSy  xxvii   CHAPTER 1  Introduction to the Django  Framework  The Django framework started in 2003, as a project done by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison at the  Journal-World newspaper in Lawrence, Kansas, in the United States. In 2005, Holovaty and Willison released  the first public version of the framework, naming it after the Belgian-French guitarist Django Reinhardt.  Fast forward to 2017 – the Django framework now operates under the guidance of the Django Software  Foundation  DSF , the framework core has over 1000 contributors with more than 15 release versions, and  there are over 3000 packages specifically designed to work with the Django framework.1  The Django framework has remained true to its origins as a Model-View-Controller  MVC     server-side framework designed to operate with relational databases. Nevertheless, Django has stayed  up to date with most web development tendencies – via third-party packages – to operate alongside  technologies like non-relational databases  NoSQL , real-time Internet communication, and modern  JavaScript practices. All this to the point, the Django framework is now the web development framework  of choice for a wide array of organizations, including the photo sharing sites Instagram2 and Pinterest3;  the Public Broadcasting System PBS 4; in the United States, National Geographic5; and with the help of  this book, your organization!  In this chapter you’ll learn about the Django framework design principles, which are key to   understanding the day-to-day aspects of working with the Django framework. Next, you’ll learn how to  install Django in various ways: as a tar.gz file, with pip, using git, and with virtualenv.  Once you install the Django framework, you’ll learn how to start a Django project and how to set it up  with a relational database. Next, you’ll learn about the core building blocks in the Django framework – urls,  templates, and apps – and how they work with one another to set up content. Finally, you’ll learn how to  set up the Django admin site, which is a web-based interface designed to access the relational database  connected to a Django project.  1https:  djangopackages.org  2https:  engineering.instagram.com what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of- technologies-adf2e22da2ad.pui97g5jk 3https:  www.quora.com Pinterest What-is-the-technology-stack-behind-Pinterest-1 4http:  open.pbs.org  5https:  github.com natgeo    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_1  1   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Django Framework Design Principles  If you work long enough in web development, you’ll eventually come to the conclusion that you can produce  the same results with just about any web framework and programming language. But while you can, in  fact, produce identical results, what will vary drastically is the time you spend creating a solution: the time  creating a prototype, the time adding new features, the time doing testing, the time doing debugging, and the  time deploying to scale, among other things.  In this sense, the Django framework uses a set of design principles that produces one of the most   productive web development processes compared to many other web frameworks. Note, I’m not saying  Django is a silver bullet  e.g., the best at prototyping, the most scalable ; I’m saying that at the end of the day,  the Django framework incorporates a set of design principles and trade-offs that make it one of the most  productive frameworks for building the features needed by most medium to large web applications.  Now, while you might think I’m biased – after all I’m writing an entire book about the topic – I’ll lay out  these design principles first, so you can gain a better understanding of what gives the Django framework this  edge.  Don’t Repeat Yourself  DRY  Principle Repetition might be good to emphasize a point, but when it comes to web development, it just leads to  additional and time-consuming work. In fact, the very nature of web development, which operates across  multiple tiers interacting with one another  e.g., HTML templates, business logic methods, and databases ,  lends itself to repetition.  The Django framework really tries to force you not to repeat yourself, so let’s see how Django enforces   not repeating yourself and why this is a good thing.  Let’s say you want to build a coffeehouse application to publish information about stores and also   have a contact form for customers. The first thing you’ll need to do is determine what kind of information is  required for stores and the contact form. Figure 1-1 illustrates a mock-up of two Django models for each of  these entities.  Figure 1-1.  Django models for store and contact entities  Notice how the Django models in Figure 1-1 each have different field names and a data type to restrict  values. For example, the statement name = models.CharField max_length=30  tells Django a store name  should have a maximum of 30 characters, while the statement email = models.EmailField   tells Django  the contact entity should contain a valid email value. If the coffeehouse is like most web applications, you’ll  generally end up doing the following for the store and contact entities:   	 Create relational database tables to save entity information.  	 Create business logic to ensure the entities comply with requirements.  	 Create HTML forms to allow data to be submitted for the entities.  2   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework   	 Create an interface to allow administrative users to access entities in the database.  	 Create REST services to expose entities for a mobile app version.  The crux of doing this last task list is you have the potential of repeating dozens of similar pieces of   information  e.g., names, value limits  in database definition language  DDL , HTML forms, business  validation logic, and URLs, among other things – process that’s not only time consuming, but also error  prone.  Wouldn’t it be easier that based on a statement like models.CharField max_length=30  you could   generate an HTML form input, a DDL statement, and automatically validate information to only contain 30  characters? This is exactly what Django’s DRY design principle does.  Figure 1-2 illustrates the same Django models from Figure 1-1 and the various constructs you can   generate from the same models without the need to repeat yourself.  Figure 1-2.  Django models create separate constructs based on DRY principle  As you can see in Figure 1-2, the entities that represent Django models are capable of generating HTML  forms to present to the public, an administrative interface to manage the entities, validation logic to enforce  entity values, as well as the DDL to generate database tables representing the entities.  3   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  While it’s a little premature to discuss the actual techniques to generate such constructs from   Django models, needless to say it’s much simpler than keeping track of multiple references of the same  thing  e.g., name, email  in HTML forms, DDL, validation logic, and other locations.  In this sense, Django really helps you define things in a single place and not have to repeat them  elsewhere. Note that it’s always possible to repeat yourself to obtain custom behaviors, but by default,  Django enforces DRY principles in nearly everything you do with it.  Explicit Is Better Than Implicit Python, the programming language used by Django, has a mantra-like statement called “The Zen of Python”  defined as part of the language’s Python Enhancement Proposals  PEP , specifically PEP 20.6 One of the  statements in PEP 20 states “Explicit is better than implicit” and with Django being based on Python, this  principle is also taken to heart.  Being explicit leads to web applications that are easily understood and maintained by a greater number  of people. Adding new features or understanding the logic behind a web application can be hard enough for  someone that didn’t write it originally, but if you toss into the mix constructs that have implicit behaviors,  users only face greater frustration trying to figure out what’s being done implicitly. Explicit does require a  little more work typing, but it’s well worth it when you compare it to the potential effort you can face trying to  debug or solve a problem.  Let’s take a quick look at Django’s explicitness in a common web development construct used across  different MVC frameworks: a view method. A view method acts as the C ontroller  in an MVC framework,  charged with handling incoming requests, applying business logic, and then routing requests with an  appropriate response.  To get a better feel for this explicitness, I’ll present a Django view method and an equivalent Ruby on   Rails view method that performs the same logic of fetching a store by a given id and routing the response to  a template. The following snippet is the Ruby on Rails version; note the lines with  that are comments and  indicate what’s happening.  class StoresController < ApplicationController   def show      Automatic access to params, a ruby hash with request parameters and view parameters     @store = Store.find params[:id]       Instance variables like @store are automatically passed on to view template      Automatically uses template views stores show.html.erb   end end  Although very succinct, notice all the implicit behavior surrounding the process to access data, pass   data to a template, and assign a template. The following snippet is an equivalent Django view method.   Explicit request variable contains request parameters  Other view parameters must be explicitly passed to views def detail request, store_id :     store = Store.objects.get id=store_id       Instance variables must be explicitly passed on to a view template      Explicit template must be assigned     return render request, 'stores detail.html', {'store': store}   6https:  www.python.org dev peps pep-0020   4   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Notice in this last snippet there’s no guessing where input parameters come from, they’re explicitly   declared as arguments in the view method. In addition, values are explicitly passed to a template, and the  template is also explicitly declared, so the logic is much more amicable to newcomers.  The implicitness of the Ruby on Rails view method is often called ‘magic’ and is even considered a  feature by many. It’s called ‘magic’ because certain behaviors are provided behind the scenes. However,  unless you know the framework and application down to a tee, it can be very difficult to pinpoint why certain  things are happening, making it more difficult to fix or update things. So even though ‘magic’ may be able to  save you a few minutes or hours in development time at the start, it can end up costing you hours or days in  maintenance later.  So just like in Python, the Django framework will always favor an explicit approach over any implicit   technique.  It’s important to point out explicit doesn’t equal verbose or redundant. While you’ll certainly end   up typing a little more code in Django vs. web frameworks that are implicitly driven  e.g., Rails , as it was  described in the prior DRY principle section, the Django framework goes to great lengths to avoid having to  introduce more code than necessary in a web application.  Finally, explicit also doesn’t mean no defaults. The Django framework does use reasonable defaults  where possible, it just doesn’t use default values where it isn’t obvious they’re being used. In essence, the  Django framework uses defaults, but avoids using defaults that produce ‘magical’ outcomes.  Loosely Coupled Architecture The Django framework being an MVC framework operates across multiple tiers  e.g., HTML templates,  business logic methods, and databases . However, Django takes great care of maintaining a loosely couple  architecture across all the components that operate across these tiers.  Being loosely coupled means there are no rigid dependencies between the parts that make up a Django   application. For example, in Django it’s perfectly valid to serve content directly from an HTML template,  without the need to use business logic or set up database. Just like in Django it’s also perfectly valid to forgo  using an HTML template and return raw data directly from a business logic method  e.g., for a REST service .  A later section in this chapter entitled “Set Up Content: Understand URLs, Templates, and Apps” goes   into greater detail with examples on how Django’s loosely coupled architecture works.  Install Django  There are various ways to install the Django framework. You can download Django from its main site7 and  install it like a regular Python application. You can also download and install Django via an operating system   OS  package administration tool such as apt-get - available on Linux distributions.  Yet another option is to install Django is to download it via the Python package manager pip. And yet   another alternative is to install Django directly from its source on github.8 The list of Django installation  options including their pros and cons is presented in Table 1-1.  7https:  www.djangoproject.com download  8https:  github.com django django   5   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Table 1-1.  Django installation options - Pros and Cons  Approach  Pros  Cons  Download install with pip  Python package manager.  Recommended option   Download from main site as  tar.gz file.

Access to the latest Django  features.  Latest version may not be available.  Requires manual download and install. Requires additional management of  Django dependencies  if not using  pip . Can contain bugs. Requires additional management of  Django dependencies  if not using pip .  Download install from OS  package manager  apt-get .  Easy to install. Dependencies are taken care of  automatically.  Latest version may not be available. Installed on global Python  environment.  As emphasized in Table 1-1, the recommended option to install Django is to use the Python pip  package manager because it provides the most flexibility. Next, I’ll describe each of the steps to install  Django using this approach and more importantly how to get up and running with pip.  Once I finish these steps, I’ll also describe the steps to install Django from a tar.gz file and from    git – using pip – which can be helpful if you want to try out the latest Django features.  Install Python  Prerequisite  Since Django is built on Python, you first need to install Python to run Django. The latest Django long-term  release  LTS , which is the focus of this book, is version 1.11. Django 1.11 requires that you either have a  Python 2.7.x release or a Python 3.4 or higher release  3.5 or 3.6 .  If this is the first time you use Python, it’s important to note Python 2 and Python 3 are considerably   different. But while it’s certainly true Python 3 is the future, be aware the future has been in the making since  2008 – when the first Python 3 release came to light – and Python 2 has remained stubbornly entrenched to  the point that Python 2.7.13 came out in December 2016.  So should you use Python 2 or Python 3 with Django? As far as Django’s core is concerned, it’s compatible  with both, so you can easily switch between Python 2 and Python 3. Where it gets a little more tricky is when it  comes to third-party Python packages and the Django Python code you plan to write yourself.  While many third-party Python packages have been upgraded to run on Python 3, this process has  been sluggish. As I already pointed out, Python 3 has been almost 10 years in the making, so be aware  that if you take the Python 3 route, you may encounter third-party Python packages that won’t work  with Python 3.  When it comes to your own Django application code, the ideal choice is to make your code both   Python 2 and Python 3 compatible – just like Django’s core – it isn’t that hard and I’ll use this technique  throughout the book. The sidebar contains more details on this topic of writing Python 2 and Python 3  compatible code.  Now, if want to stick to Python 2, just be aware Django 1.11 will be the last Django release to support  Python 2 – scheduled to be supported until around April 2020 – so if you eventually upgrade to something  higher than Django 1.11, you’ll also need to upgrade all your application code to Python 3 – which is why I  recommend the dual Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility technique. If you want to stick to Python 3, that’s  the future, just be aware that as described earlier, some third-party packages might not work with Python 3.  6   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  DJANGO COMPATIBILITY WITH PYTHON 2 AND PYTHON 3  django uses Six9 to run python 2 and python 3 compatible logic. Six is a set of utilities that wraps over  the differences between python 2 and python 3, allowing that same logic to operate equally in either  python 2 and python 3. the django framework’s internals – which you’ll rarely, if ever, need to inspect  or modify – already use this technique.  however, if you plan to write your django application code to be compatible with both python 2 and  python 3, then you’ll need to be a little more aware of how you write it. django publishes its own  guidelines on the various syntax and techniques you need to follow to make django application code  work with both python 2 and python 3,10 techniques that are also used throughout the book.  If you use a Unix Linux OS, Python is very likely installed on your system. If you type which python   on a Unix Linux terminal and it returns a response  e.g.,  usr bin python , it indicates the location of the  Python executable, if there is no response it indicates the Python executable is not available on the system. If you don’t have Python on your system and you’re using a Debian or Ubuntu Linux distribution, you  can use the OS package manager apt-get to install Python by typing: apt-get install python. If you have  a Unix Linux distribution that is not Debian or Ubuntu and you need to install Python, consult your Unix  Linux documentation for available Python packages or download the Python sources from http:  python. org download  to do the installation.  If you have a system that runs on a Windows OS or macOS, Python installers are available for download   from http:  python.org download .  Irrespective of your system’s OS, once you’ve finished the Python installation, ensure Python is installed   correctly and accessible from anywhere on your system. Open a terminal and type python, and you should  enter a Python interactive session like the one illustrated in Listing 1-1.  Listing 1-1.  Python interactive session  [user@~]$ python Python 2.7.12  default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10  [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  If you aren’t able to enter a Python interactive session, review the Python installation process because   you will not be able to continue with the following sections.  Update or Install pip Package Manager  Prerequisite  To make Python package installation and management easier, Python uses a package manager called pip. If  you’re using Python 2.7.9  or greater 2.x branch  or Python 3.4  or a greater 3.x branch , pip comes installed  by default. Now let’s upgrade pip on your system as shown in Listing 1-2, if you don’t have pip on your  system, I’ll provide instructions shortly on how to get it.  9https:  pythonhosted.org six  10https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 topics python3   7   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Listing 1-2.  Update pip package manager  [user@~]$ pip install --upgrade pip Collecting pip   Downloading pip-9.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl  1.3MB  Installing collected packages: pip   Found existing installation: pip 8.1.1 Successfully installed pip-9.0.1  As you can see in Listing 1-2, to update pip you invoke the pip executable with the arguments install   --upgrade pip. Upon execution, pip searches for a package by the provided name - in this case pip itself -  downloads it and performs an upgrade in case it’s already installed. If the installation output on your system  is similar to the one in Listing 1-2 - without any errors - you have successfully updated pip.  If you see an error like The program ‘pip’ is currently not installed or pip not found, it means your Python   installation is not equipped with pip. In this case, you’ll need to install the pip executable by downloading  https:  bootstrap.pypa.io get-pip.py and then executing the downloaded file with the command:  python get-pip.py. Once the pip executable is installed, run the pip update procedure from Listing 1-2.  With pip on your system, you’re ready to move on to the next step.  Install virtualenv  Optional Prerequisite  Virtualenv is not essential to develop Django applications, but I highly recommend you use it because it  allows you to create virtual Python environments on a single system. By using virtual Python environments,  applications can run in their own ‘sandbox’ in isolation of other Python applications. Initially virtualenv  can appear to be of little benefit, but it can be of tremendous help for tasks like replicating a development  environment to a production environment and avoiding version conflicts that can arise between different  applications.  Without virtualenv you can still proceed to install Django and any other Python package using pip,   but the issue is that all packages are installed under the global Python installation. Initially this can seem  convenient, because you only need to install packages once in the global Python installation. But it’s not that  convenient if you think about some of the following questions.  What happens if a new Django version is released after your first project and you want to start a second   project? Do you upgrade the first project to run on the new Django version or start the second project as if  the new Django version doesn’t exist? The first option requires additional work, while the second option  requires you to develop on an outdated Django version. By using virtual Python environments you avoid this  problem, because each project can run its own Django version in isolation.  If you consider this potential version conflict for any Python package, you’ll realize why I recommend   you use virtualenv. Many Python packages have specific version dependencies  e.g., package A depends  on package B version 2.3 and package C version 1.5 . If you update a new package with specific cross- dependency versions, it can be very easy to break a Python installation if you’re using a global Python  installation. With virtualenv you can have multiple Python installations without them interfering with one  another.  Now that I’ve explained the benefits of virtualenv, let’s install the virtualenv executable with pip, as   show in Listing 1-3.  Listing 1-3.  Install virtualenv with pip  [user@~]$  pip install virtualenv Downloading unpacking virtualenv   Downloading virtualenv-15.1.0.tar.gz  1.8Mb : 1.8Mb downloaded   Running setup.py egg_info for package virtualenv   Installing collected packages: virtualenv  8   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework    Running setup.py install for virtualenv   Installing virtualenv script to  usr local bin   Installing virtualenv-2.7 script to  usr local bin Successfully installed virtualenv Cleaning up...  As illustrated in Listing 1-3, pip automatically downloads and installs the requested package. Similar  to the pip executable, a virtualenv executable is also installed that should be accessible from anywhere  on your system. The virtualenv executable allows you to create virtual Python environments. Listing 1-4  illustrates how to create a virtual Python environment with virtualenv.  Listing 1-4.  Create virtual Python environment with virtualenv  [user@~]$ virtualenv --python=python3 mydjangosandbox Already using interpreter  usr bin python3 Using base prefix ' usr' New python executable in  mydjangosandbox bin python3 Also creating executable in  mydjangosandbox bin python Installing setuptools, pkg_resources, pip, wheel...done.  The virtualenv executable accepts several parameters. The task in Listing 1-4 makes use of the   --python flag, which tells virtualenv to create a virtual Python based on the python3 executable, creating a  Python 3 virtual environment. This is a common option when you have multiple Python versions on an OS   e.g., Python 2 and Python 3  and you need to specify the Python version with which to create the virtualenv.  You can omit the --python flag; just be aware that doing so the virtualenv is created with the default OS  python executable.  By default, virtualenv creates a pristine virtual Python environment like the one you had when  you made the initial Python global installation. Following virtualenv parameters, you only need to  specify an argument for the name of the virtual Python environment, which in the case of Listing 1-4 is  mydjangosandbox. Upon execution, virtualenv creates a directory with the virtual Python environment  whose contents are illustrated in Listing 1-5.  Listing 1-5.  Virtual Python environment directory structure  +    +---+-         +-activate    +-easy_install    +-pip    +-python     +-python-config    +-wheel  +---+-   +---+-   +---+- †  +---+-   9   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework     Tip   depending on the python version used to create the virtualenv, the bin directory can contain multiple  aliases or versions of the same command  e.g., In addition to python, python2.7, and python3; in addition to  activate, activate.csh, and activate_this.py .     Note†  directory to simulate a python installation.   local folder is only included in a python 2 virtualenv and links to top-level directories of the virtual   As illustrated in Listing 1-5, a virtual Python environment has a similar directory structure to a global   Python installation. The bin directory contains executables for the virtual environment, the include  directory is linked to the global Python installation header files, the lib directory is a copy of the global  Python installation libraries and where packages for the virtual environment are installed, and the share  directory is used to place shared Python packages.  The most important part of the virtual environment is the executables under the bin directory. If you use any   of these executables, such as pip, easy_install, python, or wheel, they execute under the context of the virtual  Python environment. For example, the pip under the bin folder installs packages for the virtual environment.  Similarly, an application that runs on the python executable under the bin folder is only able to load packages  installed on the virtual Python environment. This is the ‘sandbox’ behavior I mentioned previously.  Even though access to different virtual Python environments and executables is a powerful feature,   having different pip and python executables for multiple virtual Python environments and the executables  of the global Python installation itself, can become confusing due to long access paths and relative paths. For this reason, virtualenv has a mechanism to load virtual environments so that if you execute pip,  python, or any other executable from anywhere on your system, the executables from a selected virtual  environment are used  instead of the default global Python installation executables . This is achieved with  the activate executable inside the bin directory, a process illustrated in Listing 1-6.  Listing 1-6.  Activate virtual Python environment  [user@~]$ source . bin activate [ mydjangosandbox user@~] $  NOTE: source is a Unix Linux specific command, for other OS just execute activate  Notice in Listing 1-6 how after invoking the activate executable, the command prompt adds the virtual   environment name between parentheses. This means the executables under the bin directory of the virtual  Python environment mydjangosandbox are used over those in the global Python installation. To exit a virtual  Python environment just type deactivate and you fall back to using the global Python installation executables.  As you’ve now learned, virtualenv works transparently allowing you to maintain different Python  installations each with its own set of executables like the main python interpreter and the pip package  manager. You only need to take care of switching between virtual environments so you install and run  Python applications in the appropriate virtual environment.   In future sections I won’t make any reference to virtualenv  e.g., mydjangosandbox  since it isn’t      Note  directly related to django. though I recommend you use virtualenv, I’ll leave it up to you if you want to keep using  the global python installation python and pip executables for everything or if you prefer to keep virtual python  environments with their own executables to make python application management easier. So when you see python  executables referenced in the book, assume they are global or from a virtualenv, whichever you’re using.  10   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Install Django Once you have all the previous tools working on your system, the actual Django installation is very simple.  Listing 1-7 illustrates how to install Django using pip.  Listing 1-7.

With this same syntax you can install any specific Django version. If you don’t specify a  package version, pip downloads and installs the most recent available version for the specified package.  Sometimes a Django release may take a few days to become available through pip, in which case you’ll  receive an error. In such cases you can download the release directly from the Django main site at https:   www.djangoproject.com download . Once you download the release file in tar.gz format, you can use pip to  make the installation as illustrated in Listing 1-8.  Listing 1-8.

Install Django from Git If you want to use the most recent functionalities available in Django, then you’ll need to install Django from  its Git repository. The Git repository contains the latest changes made to Django. Even though the Django  Git version can be unstable, it’s the only way to develop with the newest Django features or get bug fixes for  problems that aren’t yet available in public releases.  11   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework   You need to install git to execute the following tasks. You can download git for several oSes at      Note  http:  git-scm.com   Just like the prior pip installation examples, pip is sufficiently flexible to make a Django installation   from Git. There are two alternatives to use pip with Git. You can provide the remote Django Git repository,  in which case pip clones the repository locally and discards it after the installation, as illustrated in Listing  1-9. Or you can clone the Django Git repository locally - where you’ll be able to make modifications at a later  time - and then run pip to do the installation, as illustrated in Listing 1-10.  Listing 1-9.  Install Django from remote Git with pip  [user@~]$ pip install git+https:  github.com django django.git Collecting git+https:  github.com django django.git   Cloning https:  github.com django django.git to . pip-31j_bcqa-build  Requirement already satisfied: pytz in  python mydjangosandbox lib python3.5 site-packages   from Django==2.0.dev20170408112615  Installing collected packages: Django       Successfully uninstalled Django-1.11   Running setup.py install for Django ... done Successfully installed Django-2.0.dev20170408112615  Listing 1-10.

In this case https:  github.com django django.git represents the Django Git repository. In  Listing 1-10 the Django Git repository is cloned locally first, and then pip is executed with the argument of  the local Git repository directory.  12   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Start a Django Project  To start a Django project you must use the django-admin executable or django-admin.py script that  comes with Django. After you install Django, both this executable and script should be accessible from  any directory on your system  e.g., installed under  usr bin , usr local bin  or the  bin  directory of  a virtualenv . Note that both the executable and script offer the same functionality; therefore I will use the  django-admin term interchangeably going forward.  The django-admin offers various subcommands you’ll use extensively for your daily work with Django   projects. But it’s the startproject subcommand you’ll use first, since it creates the initial structure of a  Django project. The startproject subcommand receives a single argument to indicate the name of project,  as illustrated in the following snippet.  Create a project called coffeehouse django-admin startproject coffeehouse Create a project called sportstats django-admin startproject sportstats  A Django project name can be composed of numbers, letters, or underscores. A project name cannot  start with a number, it can only start with a letter or underscore. In addition, special characters, and spaces  are not allowed anywhere in a project name, mainly because Django project names serve as a naming  convention for directories and Python packages.  Upon executing django-admin startproject  , a directory called   is   created containing the default Django project structure. The default Django project structure is illustrated in  Listing 1-11.  Listing 1-11.  Django project structure  +   +----manage.py  +---+-           +-__init__.py     +-settings.py     +-urls.py     +-wsgi.py  If you inspect the directory layout, you’ll notice there are two directories with the     value. I will refer to the top-level Django project directory as BASE_DIR, which includes the manage.py file  and the other subdirectory based on the project name. And I will refer to the second-level subdirectory  - which includes the __init__.py, settings.py, urls.py, and wsgi.py files - as PROJECT_DIR. Next, I’ll  describe the purpose of each file in Listing 1-11.   	   	  manage.py .- Runs project specific tasks. Just as django-admin is used to execute  system wide Django tasks, manage.py is used to execute project specific tasks.  __init__.py .- Python file that allows Python packages to be imported from  directories where it’s present. Note __init__.py is not Django specific, it’s a generic  file used in almost all Python applications.  13   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework   	  	  	  settings.py .- Contains the configuration settings for the Django project.  urls.py .- Contains URL patterns for the Django project.  wsgi.py .- Contains WSGI configuration properties for the Django project. WSGI is  the recommended approach to deploy Django applications on production  i.e., to  the public . You don’t need to set up WSGI to develop Django applications.   rename a project’s BASE_DIR. having two nested directories with the same name in a django project      Tip  can lead to confusion, especially if you deal with python package import issues. to save yourself trouble, I  recommend you rename the BASE_DIR to something different than the project name  e.g., rename, capitalize, or  shorten the name to make it different than the PROJECT_DIR .   do not rename the PROJECT_DIR. the PROJECT_DIR name is hard-coded into some project files      Caution   e.g., settings.py and wsgi.py , so do not change its name. If you need to rename the PROJECT_DIR it’s  simpler to create another project with a new name.  Now that you’re familiar with the default Django project structure, let’s see the default Django project in   a browser. All Django projects have a built-in web server to observe an application in a browser as changes  are made to project files. Placed in the BASE_DIR of a Django project – where the manage.py file is - run the  command python manage.py runserver as shown in Listing 1-12.  Listing 1-12.  Start Django development web server provided by manage.py  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py runserver Performing system checks...  System check identified no issues  0 silenced .  You have 13 unapplied migration s . Your project may not work properly until you apply the  migrations for app s : admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions. Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.  May 23, 2017 - 22:41:20 Django version 1.11, using settings 'coffeehouse.settings' Starting development server at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.  As illustrated in Listing 1-12, the command python manage.py runserver starts a development   web server on http:  127.0.0.1:8000  - which is the local address on your system. Don’t worry  about the 'unapplied migration s ' message for the moment, I’ll address it in the upcoming section  on setting up a database for a Django project. Next, if you open a browser and point it to the address  http:  127.0.0.1:8000  you should see the default home page for a Django project illustrated in  Figure 1-3.  14   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Figure 1-3.  Default home page for a Django project  Sometimes it’s convenient to alter the default address and port for Django’s development web server.   This can be due to the default port being busy by another service or the need to bind the web server to  a non-local address so someone on a remote machine can view the development server. This is easily  achieved by appending either the port or full address:port string to the python manage.py runserver  command, as shown in the various examples in Listing 1-13.  Listing 1-13.  Start Django development web server on different address and port   Run the development server on the local address and port 4345  http:  127.0.0.1:4345   python manage.py runserver 4345  Run the dev server on the 96.126.104.88 address and port 80  http:  96.126.104.88   python manage.py runserver 96.126.104.88:80  Run the dev server on the 192.168.0.2 address and port 8888  http:  192.168.0.2:8888   python manage.py runserver 192.168.0.2:8888  Set Up a Database for a Django Project  Django in its ‘out-of-the-box’ state is set up to communicate with SQLite - a lightweight relational database  included with the Python distribution. So by default, Django automatically creates a SQLite database for  your project.  In addition to SQLite, Django also has support for other popular databases that include PostgreSQL,   MySQL, and Oracle. The Django configuration to connect to a database is done inside the settting.py file  of a Django project in the DATABASES variable.  If you open the settings.py file of a Django project, you’ll notice the DATABASES variable has a default   Python dictionary with the values illustrated in Listing 1-14.  15   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Listing 1-14.  Default Django DATABASES dictionary   Build paths inside the project like this: os.path.join BASE_DIR, ...  import os BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__     DATABASES = {     'default': {         'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',         'NAME': os.path.join BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3' ,     } }     Tip    use SQLite if you want the quickest database setup.  A database setup by itself can be time consuming. If you want the quickest setup to enable Django with   a database, leave the previous configuration as is. SQLite doesn’t require additional credentials or Python  packages to establish a Django database connection. Just be aware a SQLite database is a flat file and Django  creates the SQLite database based on the NAME variable value. In the case of Listing 1-14, under a Django  project’s BASE_DIR and as a flat file named db.sqlite3.   If you use SQLite, you can skip to the last step in this section “test django database connection and      Note  build django base tables.”  The Django DATABASES variable defines key-value pairs. Each key represents a database reference name   and the value is a Python dictionary with the database connection parameters. In Listing 1-14 you can  observe the default database reference. The default reference name is used to indicate that any database  related operation declared in a Django project be executed against this connection. This means that unless  otherwise specified, all database CRUD  Create-Read-Update-Delete  operations are done against the  database defined with the default key.  The database connection parameters for the default database in this case are the keys ENGINE and NAME,   which represent a database engine  i.e., brand  and the name of the database instance, respectively. The most important parameter of a Django database connection is the ENGINE value. The Django   application logic associated with a database is platform neutral, which means that you always write database  CRUD operations in the same way irrespective of the database selection. Nevertheless, there are minor  differences between CRUD operations done against different databases, which need to be taken into account. Django takes care of this issue by supporting different back ends or engines. Therefore, depending on   the database brand you plan to use for a Django application, the ENGINE value has to be one of the values  illustrated in Table 1-2.  Table 1-2.  Django ENGINE value for different databases  Database  Django ENGINE value  django.db.backends.mysql  django.db.backends.oracle  django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2  SQLite  django.db.backends.sqlite3  MySQL Oracle PostgreSQL  16   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  The Django database connection parameter NAME is used to identify a database instance, and its value  convention can vary depending on the database brand. For example, for SQLite NAME indicates the location  of a flat file, whereas for MySQL it indicates the logical name of an instance.  The full set of Django database connection parameters is described in Table 1-3.  Table 1-3.  Django database connection parameters based on database brand  Django connection  parameter  Default value  Notes  ATOMIC_REQUESTS  False  AUTOCOMMIT  True  CONN_MAX_AGE  0  ENGINE  HOST  '' Empty string  '' Empty string   NAME  '' Empty string   PASSWORD  ''  Empty string   PORT  USER  ''  Empty string   ''  Empty string   Enforces  or not  a transaction for each view request. By  default set to False, because opening a transaction for every  view has additional overhead. The impact on performance  depends on the query patterns of an application and on how  well a database handles locking. By default set to True, because otherwise it would require  explicit transactions to perform commits. The lifetime of a database connection in seconds. By default  0 which closes the database connection at the end of each  request. Use None for unlimited persistent connections. The database back end to use. See Table 1-2 for value options. Defines a database host, where an empty string means localhost.  For MySQL: If this value starts with a forward slash  ‘ ’ ,  MySQL will connect via a Unix socket to the specified socket   e.g.,“HOST”: ‘ var run mysql’ . If this value doesn’t start with a  forward slash, then this value is assumed to be the host.  For PostgreSQL: By default ’’ , the connection to the database  is done through UNIX domain sockets  ‘local’ lines in pg_hba. conf . If the UNIX domain socket is not in the standard  location, use the same value of unix_socket_directory from  postgresql.conf. If you want to connect through TCP sockets,  set HOST to ‘localhost’ or ‘127.0.0.1’  ‘host’ lines in pg_hba. conf . On Windows, you should always define HOST, as UNIX  domain sockets are not available. The name of the database to use. For SQLite, it’s the full path  to the database file. When specifying the path, always use  forward slashes, even on Windows  e.g., C: www STORE  db.sqlite3 .  Available parameters vary depending on database back end,  consult the back end module’s own documentation. For a list  of back-end modules see Table 1-2. The password to use when connecting to the database. Not  used with SQLite. The port to use when connecting to the database. An empty  string means the default port. Not used with SQLite.  The username to use when connecting to the database. Not  used with SQLite.  17  OPTIONS  {}  Empty dictionary  Extra parameters to use when connecting to the database.    Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Install Python Database Packages Besides configuring Django to connect to a database, you’ll also need to install the necessary Python  packages to communicate with your database brand - the only exception to this is SQLite, which is included  in the Python distribution.  Each database relies on different packages, but the installation process is straightforward with the   pip package manager. If you don’t have the pip executable on your system, see the previous section in this  chapter “Install Django” in the “Install pip” subsection.  The Python packages for each database supported in Django in its ‘out-of-the-box’ state are   enumerated in Table 1-4. In addition, Table 1-4 also includes the pip command to install each package.  Table 1-4.  Python packages for different databases  Database  Python package  pip installation syntax  PostgreSQL MySQL Oracle  psycopg2  mysql-python  cx_Oracle  pip install psycopg2  pip install mysql-python  pip install cx_Oracle  SQLite  Included with Python 2.5+  N A  DATABASE DEVELOPMENT LIBRARIES  If you receive an error trying to install one of the python database packages in table 1-4, ensure the  database development libraries are installed on your system. database development libraries are  necessary to build software that connects to a database.  database development libraries are not related to python or django, so you’ll need to consult the  database vendor or operating system documentation  e.g., on a debian Linux or ubuntu Linux system  you can install the mySQL development libraries with the following apt-get task: apt-get install  libmysqlclient-dev .  Test Django Database Connection and Build Django Base Tables Once you update the Django settings.py file with database credentials, you can test it to see if the Django  application can communicate with the database. There are several tasks you’ll do throughout a Django  project that will communicate with the database, but one of the most common tasks you can do right now to  test a database connection is to migrate the project’s data structures to the database.  The Django database migration process ensures all Django project logic associated with a database is   reflected in the database itself  e.g., the database has the necessary tables expected by a Django project .  When you start a Django project, there are a series of migrations Django requires that create tables to keep  track of administrators and sessions. This is always the first migration process a Django project runs against  a database. So to test the Django database connection, let’s run this first migration on the database to create  this set of base tables.  To run a migration on a Django project against a database, use the manage.py script in a project’s BASE_ DIR with the migrate argument  e.g., python manage.py migrate . The first time you execute this command  the output should be similar to Listing 1-15.  18   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Listing 1-15.  Run first Django migrate operation to create base database tables  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py migrate Operations to perform:   Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions Running migrations:   Applying contenttypes.0001_initial...

OK   Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK   Applying sessions.0001_initial... OK  As illustrated in Listing 1-15, if the connection to the database is successful, Django applies a series   of migrations that create database tables to manage users, groups, permissions, and sessions for a project.  For the moment, don’t worry too much about how these Django migrations work or where they are located  - I’ll provide details later - just be aware these migrations are needed by Django to provide some basic  functionality.   Connect directly to the database. If you receive an error trying to connect to the database or migrating      Tip  the django project to create the initial set of database tables, try to connect directly to the database using the  same django parameters.  on many occasions a typo in the django variables name, uSer, paSSword, hoSt, or port can cause the  process to fail or inclusively the credentials aren’t even valid to connect directly to the database.  Set Up Content: Understand Urls, Templates, and Apps  Content in Django projects works with three major building blocks: urls, templates, and apps. You create and  configure Django urls, templates, and apps separately, though you connect one to another to fulfill content  delivery, which is part of Django’s loosely coupled architecture design principles.  Urls define the entry points or where to access content. Templates define the end points that give form   to the final content. And apps serve as the middleware between urls and templates, altering or adding  content from a database or user interactions. To run static content you only need to create and configure  Django urls and templates. To run dynamic content - built from a database or user interactions - you need to  create and configure Django apps, in addition to urls and templates.  But before describing how to create and configure urls, templates, and apps, it’s very important you   understand how each of these parts works with one another. Figure 1-4 shows the Django workflow for user  requests and how they work with Django urls, templates, and apps.  19   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Figure 1-4.  Django workflow for urls, templates, and apps  As you can see in Figure 1-4, there are two separate pipelines to deliver either static or dynamic content.   More importantly, notice how each of the different Django layers is loosely coupled  e.g., you can forgo the  apps layer if it isn’t required and the urls layer and templates layer are still able to communicate with one  another .  Create and Configure Django Urls The main entry point for Django urls is the urls.py file created when you start a project - if you’re unfamiliar  with a Django project structure, see Listing 1-11 earlier in the chapter. If you open the urls.py file, you’ll  notice it only has one active url to  admin  that is the Django admin - I will discuss the Django admin in the  next and final section of this chapter.  Now that you’re familiar with the urls.py file syntax, let’s activate a url to view custom content on the   home page of a Django project.  Django urls use regular expressions to match incoming requests. The regular expression pattern to  match a home page is ^$ - the next chapter includes a dedicated section on the use of regular expression  in Django urls. In addition to the regular expression pattern, an action of what to do when a request is  intercepted for a matching pattern is also needed  e.g., send the content from a specific template .  Open the urls.py file and add line 3 - the one below django.contrib import admin - and line 9 - the   one below url r'^admin ', admin.site.urls , - as illustrated in Listing 1-16.  20   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Listing 1-16.  Django url for home page to template  from django.conf.urls import url from django.contrib import admin from django.views.generic import TemplateView ... ...  urlpatterns = [     url r'^admin ', admin.site.urls ,     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html'  , ]  As show in Listing 1-16, urlpatterns is a Python list of url   statements. The url method comes from  the django.conf.urls package. The url method you just added defines the pattern for the home page - the  regular expression ^$ - followed by the action TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html' .  This last action is a helper method to direct the requesting party to a template that takes the argument  template_name='homepage.html'.  In summary, the url method you added in Listing 1-16 tells Django that requests for the home page   should return the content in the template homepage.html. The url method is very versatile and can accept  several variations, as I’ll describe shortly and extensively in the next chapter.  Now let’s test the home page. Start the development web server by executing python manage.  py runserver on the Django project’s BASE_DIR. Open a browser on the default address  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 . What do you see? An error page with Exception Type: TemplateDoesNotExist  homepage.html. This error is caused because Django can’t locate the homepage.html template defined for  the url. In the next section, I’ll show you how to configure and create templates.     Caution   If you receive the error OperationalError - no such table: django_session instead of  the TemplateDoesNotExist homepage.html error, this means the database for a django project is still not  set up properly. You’ll need to run python manage.py migrate in a project’s BASE_DIR so django creates the  necessary tables to keep track of sessions. See the previous section on setting up a database for more details.  Create and Configure Django Templates By default, Django templates are interpreted as HTML. This means Django templates are expected to have a  standard HTML document structure and HTML tags  e.g.,  ,   . You can use a regular text editor  to create Django templates and save the files with an .html extension.  Lets create a template for the url in the past section. In a text editor, create a file named homepage.html  and place the contents of Listing 1-17 into it. Save the file on your system, in a subdirectory called templates  in your Django project’s PROJECT_DIR.  Listing 1-17.  Template homepage.html          Home page for Django        21   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Once you have a directory with Django templates, you need to configure a Django project so it can find  the templates in this directory. In the settings.py file of the Django project, you need to define the template  directory in the DIRS property of the TEMPLATES variable. The DIRS property is a list, so you can define  several directories to locate templates, though I recommend you only use a single directory with various  subdirectories for classification.  As I recommended previously, you should aim to keep Django templates inside a subdirectory – using   an obvious name like templates – in a Django project’s PROJECT_DIR. So for example, if the absolute path  to a Django project PROJECT_DIR is  www STORE coffeehouse , the recommended location for a DIRS  value would be  www STORE coffeehouse templates . Listing 1-18 illustrates a sample DIRS definition in  settings.py using the PROJECT_DIR reference variable set dynamically at the top of settings.py.  Listing 1-18.  TEMPLATES and DIRS definition in settings.py  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ]  An important takeaway from Listing 1-18 is that it doesn’t use hard-coded directory paths; instead it   uses the PROJECT_DIR variable that is determined dynamically. This may seem trivial at the moment, but it’s  a good practice once the location of a Django project has a tendency to change  e.g., group development,  deployment to production .  Finally, start the Django development web server once again and open a browser on the default address  http:  127.0.0.1:8000 . Instead of the error page you saw in the previous section, you should now see the  contents of the template homepage.html on the home page.  Create and Configure Django Apps Django apps are used to group application functionality. If you want to work with content from a database or  user interactions you have to create and configure Django apps. A project can contain as many apps as you  need. For example, if you have a project for a coffeehouse, you can create an app for stores, another app for  menu items, another app for about information, and create additional apps as they’re needed. There’s no  hard rule to the number of apps in a project. Whether to make code management simpler or delegate app  work to a team, the purpose of Django apps is to group application functionality to make work easier.  Django apps are normally contained in subdirectories inside a project. This approach makes it easier to   use Python references and naming conventions. If the project name is coffeehouse, the functionality of an  app named stores is easily referred through Python packages as coffeehouse.stores.  22   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Because apps provide a modular way to group application functionality, it’s common for other people   or groups to distribute Django apps with popular functionality. For example, if a Django project requires  forum functionality, instead of writing a forum app from scratch, you can leverage one of several Django  forum apps. The more general purpose the functionality you’re looking for, the more likely you’ll be able to  find a Django app created by a third party.  YOU ALREADY WORKED WITH DJANGO APPS!  You may not have realized it, but in the previous section when you set up a database for a django  project, you already worked with django apps when you invoked the migrate operation.  By default, all django projects are enabled with six apps provided by the framework. these apps are  django.contrib.admin, django.contrib.auth, django.contrib.contenttypes, django.contrib. sessions, django.contrib.messages, and django.contrib.staticfiles. when you triggered the  migrate operation, django created the database models for these preinstalled apps.  Next, lets create a small Django app. Go to the PROJECT_DIR - where the urls.py and settings.  py files are - and execute the command django-admin startapp about to create an app called about.  A subdirectory named about is created containing the app. By default, upon creating an app its  subdirectory includes the following:   	   	   	   	  	  	  	  __init__.py .- Python file to allow app packages to be imported from other  directories. Note __init__.py is not a Django specific file, it’s a generic file used in  almost all Python applications.  migrations.- Directory that contains migrations applied to the app’s database  definitions  i.e., model classes .  admin.py .- File with admin definitions for the app - such definitions are needed to  access model class instances from the Django admin.  apps.py .- File with configuration parameters for the app.  models.py .- File with database definitions  i.e., model classes  for the app.  tests.py .- File with test definitions for the app.  views.py .- File with view definitions  i.e., controller methods  for the app.  Next, open the views.py file and add the contents from Listing 1-19.  Listing 1-19.  Handler view method in views.py  from django.shortcuts import render  def contact request :      Content from request or database extracted here      and passed to the template for display     return render request,'about contact.html'   23   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  The contact method in Listing 1-19 - like all other methods in views.py files - is a controller method  with access to a user’s web request. Notice the input for the contact method is called request. Inside this  type of method you can access content from a web request  e.g., IP address, session  using the request  reference or access information from a database, so that toward the end you pass this information to a  template. If you look at the last line of the contact method, it finishes with a return statement to the Django  helper method render. In this case, the render method returns control to the about contact.html template. Because the contact method in Listing 1-19 returns control to the template about contact.html, you’ll   also need to create a subdirectory called about with a template called contact.html inside your templates  directory  i.e., the one defined in the DIRS property of the TEMPLATES variable .  The contact method by itself does nothing, it needs to be called by a url. Listing 1-20 illustrates how to   add a url to the urls.py file linked to the contact method in Listing 1-19.  Listing 1-20.  Django url for view method  from django.conf.urls import url from django.contrib import admin from django.views.generic import TemplateView  from coffeehouse.about import views as about_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^admin ', admin.site.urls ,     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html'  ,     url r'^about ', about_views.contact , ]  The first thing that’s declared in Listing 1-20 is an import statement to gain access to the contact   method in Listing 1-19. In this case, because the app is named about and it’s under the coffeehouse project  folder, it says from coffeehouse.about, followed by import views which gives us access to the app’s views. py file where the contact method is located.  The import statement ends with as about_views to assign a unique qualifier, which is important if   you plan to work with multiple apps. For example, import statements without the as keyword, such as from  coffeehouse.about import views, from coffeehouse.items import views or from coffeehouse.stores  import views can import conflicting view method references  e.g., three methods named index , so the as  qualifier is a safeguard to ensure you don’t unintentionally use a method with the same name from another  app.  The new url definition in Listing 1-20 uses a regular expression to match requests on the about   url directory  e.g., http:  127.0.0.1:8000 about   and instead of directing the request to a template,  control is given to the about_views.contact method - where about_views refers to the imported reference  described in the previous paragraph.  Next, start the Django development web server and open a browser on the address   http:  127.0.0.1:8000 about . Notice how a request on the about url directory displays the underlying  about contact.html template defined in the contact method in views.py.  Finally, although you can now access an app’s views.py methods, you also need to configure the app  inside a project’s settings.py file. This last step is important so Django can find other app constructs you  create later  e.g., database model definitions, static resources, custom template tags .  Open the Django project’s settings.py file and look for the INSTALLED_APPS variable. You’ll see a series  of apps already defined on the INSTALLED_APPS. Notice how the installed apps belong to the django.contrib  package, this means they’re provided by the Django framework itself. Add the coffeehouse.about app to the  list as illustrated in line 8 of Listing 1-21.  24   Listing 1-21.  Add app to INSTALLED_APPS in Django settings.py  Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  INSTALLED_APPS = [     'django.contrib.admin',     'django.contrib.auth',     'django.contrib.contenttypes',     'django.contrib.sessions',     'django.contrib.messages',     'django.contrib.staticfiles',     'coffeehouse.about', ]  As illustrated in line 8 of Listing 1-21, to add apps to a project you add the app package as a string to   the INSTALLED_APPS variable. Though the coffeehouse.about app is still practically empty, adding the  app to the INSTALLED_APPS variable is an important configuration step for future actions, such as database  operations and static resources associated with the app, among other things.  Set Up the Django admin Site  The Django admin site provides a web-based interface to access the database connected to a Django  project. Even for experienced technical administrators, doing database CRUD  Create-Read-Update-Delete   operations directly on a database can be difficult and time consuming, given the need to issue raw SQL  commands and navigate database structures. For nontechnical users, doing database CRUD operations  directly on a database can be daunting, if not impossible. The Django admin site fixes this problem.  The Django admin site can expose all Django project-related data structures linked to a database, so   it’s easy for experts and novices alike to perform database CRUD operations. As a Django project grows,  the Django admin site can be a vital tool to administer the growing body of information in the database  connected to a Django project.  The Django admin site is built as a Django app; this means the only thing you need to do to set up the   Django admin site is configure and install the app as any other Django app. If you’re unfamiliar with the  term Django app, read the previous section “Set Up Content: Understand Urls, Templates, and Apps.”  The Django admin site requires that you previously configure a database and also install the Django  base tables. So if you still haven’t done this, see the prior section “Set Up a Database for a Django Project.”  Configure and Install the Django admin site App By default, the Django admin is enabled on all Django projects. If you open a Django project’s urls. py file, in the urlpatterns variable you’ll see the line url r'^admin ', admin.site.urls . This last  regular expression pattern tells Django to enable the admin site app on the  admin url directory    e.g., http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin  .  Next, if you open the project’s settings.py file and go to the INSTALLED_APPS variable, near the top of  this variable you’ll see the line django.contrib.admin that indicates the Django admin site app is enabled. Start the development web server by executing python manage.py runserver on Django’s BASE_DIR.   Open a browser on the Django admin site http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin . You’ll see a login screen like the  one in Figure 1-5.  25   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  Figure 1-5.  Django admin site login  Next, let’s create a Django superuser or administrator to access the Django admin via the interface in  Figure 1-5. To create a Django superuser you can use the createsuperuser command from manage.py as  illustrated in Listing 1-22.  Listing 1-22.  Create Django superuser for admin interface  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py createsuperuser Username  leave blank to use 'admin' : Email address: admin@coffeehouse.com Password: Password  again : The password is too similar to the email address. This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters. This password is too common. Password: Password  again : Superuser created successfully.   If you receive the error OperationalError - no such table: auth_user, this means the      Caution  database for a django project is still not set up properly. You’ll need to run python manage.py migrate in a  project’s BaSe_dIr so django creates the necessary tables to keep track of users. See the previous section   “Set up a database for a django project” for more details.  26   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework   By default, django enforces that user passwords comply with a minimum level of security. For      Tip  example, in Listing 1-22 you can see that after attempting to use the password coffee, django rejects the  assignment with a series of error messages and forces a new attempt. You can modify these password  validation rules in the AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS variable in setttings.py.  This last process creates a superuser whose information is stored in the database connected to the   Django project, specifically in the auth_user table. Now you might be asking yourself, how do you update  this user’s name, password, or email? While you could go straight to the database table and perform updates,  this is a tortuous route; a better approach is to rely on the Django admin, which gives you a very friendly  view into the database tables present in your Django project.  Next, introduce the superuser username and password you just created into the interface from    Figure 1-5. Once you provide the superuser username and password on the admin site, you’ll access the  home page for the admin site illustrated in Figure 1-6.  Figure 1-6.  Django admin site home page  On the home page of the Django admin site illustrated in Figure 1-6, click on the ‘Users’ link. You’ll see   a list of users with access to the Django project. At the moment, you’ll only see the superuser you created  in the past step. You can change this user’s credentials  e.g., password, email, username  or add new users  directly from this Django admin site screen.  This flexibility to modify or add records stored in a database that’s tied to a Django project is what  makes the Django admin site so powerful. For example, if you develop a coffeehouse project and add  apps like stores, drinks, or customers, Django admin authorized users can do CRUD operations on these  objects  e.g., create stores, update drinks, delete customers . This is tremendously powerful from a content  management point of view, particularly for nontechnical users. And most importantly it requires little to no  additional development work to enable the Django admin site on a project’s apps.  27   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  The Django admin site tasks presented here are just the ‘tip of the iceberg’ in functionality; a future   chapter covers the Django admin site functionality in greater detail.  Configure and Install the Django admin site docs App The Django admin site also has its own documentation app. The Django admin site documentation app  not only provides information about the operation of the admin site itself, but also includes other general  documentation about Django filters for Django templates. More importantly, the Django admin site  documentation app introspects the source code for all installed project apps to present documentation on  controller methods and model objects  i.e., documentation embedded in the source code of app models.py  and views.py files .  To install the Django admin site documentation app, you first need to install the docutils Python   package with the pip package manager executing the following command: pip install docutils. Once  you install the docutils package, you can proceed to install the Django admin site documentation app as any  other Django app.  Add the url to access the Django admin site documentation app. If you open the project’s urls.py file,   in the urlpatterns variable add the following line:   url r'^admin doc ', include 'django.contrib.admindocs.urls'    Ensure you add this before the url r'^admin '… line to keep more general matching expressions   toward the bottom and more granular expressions on the same url path  e.g.,  admin  toward the top. This  last regular expression pattern tells Django to enable the admin site documentation app on the  admin doc   url directory  e.g. http:  127.0.0.1:8000 admin doc  .  Next, open the project’s settings.py file and go to the INSTALLED_APPS variable. Near the final values in   this variable add the line django.contrib.admindocs to enable the Django admin site documentation app. With the development web server running, open a browser on the address http:  127.0.0.1:8000   admin doc  and you should see a page like the one in Figure 1-7.  Figure 1-7.  Django admin site doc home page  28   Chapter 1   IntroduCtIon to the django Framework  If you logged off the Django admin site, you’ll need to log in again to access the documentation since   it also requires user authentication. Once you log in, you’ll be able to see the documentation home page  for the Django admin site - illustrated in Figure 1-7 - as well as the documentation on a project’s controller  methods and model objects.  29   CHAPTER 2  Django Urls and Views  In Chapter 1 you learned about the core building blocks in Django, inclduing what are views, models, and  urls. In this chapter, you’ll learn more about Django urls, which are the entry point into a Django application  workflow. You’ll learn how to create complex url regular expressions, how to use url values in view methods  and templates, how to structure and manage urls, and how to name urls.  After urls, Django views represent the next step in almost all Django workflows, where views are   charged with inspecting requests, executing business logic, querying a database and validating data, as well  as generating responses. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create Django views with optional parameters,  the structure of view requests and responses, how to use middleware with views, and how to create   class-based views.  Url Regular Expressions  Regular expressions provide a powerful approach in all programming languages to determine patterns.  However, with power also comes complexity, to the point that there are entire books written on the topic of  regular expressions.1  Although most Django urls will never exceed a fraction of the complexity illustrated in many regular   expression books, it’s important that you understand some of the underlying behaviors and most common  patterns of regular expressions in Django urls.  Precedence Rule: Granular Urls First, Broad Urls Last Django urls need to follow a certain order and syntax to work correctly. Broad url regular expressions should  be declared last and only after more granular url regular expressions.  This is because Django url regular expression matching doesn’t use short-circuiting behavior, like a   nested conditional statement  e.g., if elif elif elif else  where as soon as one condition is met, the remaining  options are ignored. In Django urls if there’s more than one matching regular expression for an incoming  url request, it will be the top-most one’s action that gets triggered. Precedence for matching url regular  expressions is given from top  i.e., first declared  to bottom  i.e., last declared .  You shouldn’t underestimate how easy it can be to introduce two url regular expressions that match    the same pattern, particularly if you’ve never done regular expressions since the syntax can be cryptic.  Listing 2-1 illustrates the right way to declare Django urls, with more granular regular expressions toward the  top and broad regular expressions toward the bottom.  1http:  www.apress.com la book 9781590594414    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_2  31   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Listing 2-1.  Correct precedence for Django url regular expressions  from django.views.generic import TemplateVieww  urlpatterns = [     url r'^about index ',TemplateView.as_view template_name='index.html'  ,     url r'^about ',TemplateView.as_view template_name='about.html'  , ]  Based on Listing 2-1, let’s walk through what happens if Django receives a request for the url  about   index . Initially Django matches the last regular expression, which says ‘match ^about ’. Next, Django  continues upward inspecting the regular expressions and reaches ‘match ^about index ' that is an exact  match to the request url  about index  and therefore triggers this action to send control to the index.html  template.  Now let’s walk through a request for the url  about . Initially Django matches the last regular   expression that says ‘match ^about ’. Next, Django continues upward inspecting the regular expressions  for a potential match. Because no match is found - since ‘match ^about index ' is a more granular regular  expression - Django triggers the first action to send control to the about.html template, which was the only  regular expression match.  As you can see, Listing 2-1 produces what can be said to be expected behavior. But now let’s invert the  order of the url regular expressions, as shown in Listing 2-2, and break down why declaring more granular  regular expressions toward the bottom is the wrong way to declare Django url regular expressions.  Listing 2-2.  Wrong precedence for Django url regular expressions  from django.views.generic import TemplateVieww  urlpatterns = [     url r'^about ',TemplateView.as_view template_name='about.html'  ,     url r'^about index ',TemplateView.as_view template_name='index.html'  , ]  The issue in Listing 2-2 comes when a request is made for the url  about index . Initially Django   matches the last regular expression, which says ‘match ^about index ’. However, Django continues  inspecting the regular expressions and reaches ‘match ^about ' which is a broader match to the request  url  about index , but nevertheless a match! Therefore Django triggers this action and sends control to  the about.html template, instead of what was likely expected to be the index.html template from the first  match.  Exact Url Patterns: Forgoing Broad Matching In the past section, I intentionally used regular expressions that allowed broad url matching. In my  experience, as a Django project grows you’ll eventually face the need to use this type of url regular  expression – but more on why this is so, shortly.  As it turns out, it’s possible to use exact url regular expressions. Exact url regular expressions remove   any ambiguity introduced by the order in which Django url regular expression are declared.  Let’s rework the url regular expressions from Listing 2-2 and make them exact regular expressions so  their order doesn’t matter. Listing 2-3 illustrates exact regular expressions on basis of those in Listing 2-2.  32   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Listing 2-3.  Exact regular expressions, where url order doesn’t matter  from django.views.generic import TemplateVieww  urlpatterns = [     url r'^about $',TemplateView.as_view template_name='about.html'  ,     url r'^about index $',TemplateView.as_view template_name='index.html'  , ]  Notice the regular expressions in Listing 2-3 end with the $ character. This is the regular expression   symbol for end of line, which means the regular expression urls only match an exact pattern.  For example, if Django receives a request for the url  about index  it will only match the last regular   expression in Listing 2-3, which says ‘match ^about index $’. However, it won’t match the higher-up ^  about $ regular expression because this regular expression says match about  exactly with nothing else  after, since the $ indicates the end of the pattern.  However, as useful as the $ character is to make stricter url regular expressions, it’s important you   analyze its behavior. If you plan to use url Search Engine Optimization  SEO , A B testing techniques, or  simply want to allow multiple urls to run the same action, stricter regular expressions with $ eventually  require more work.  For example, if you start to use urls like  about index ,  about email , about address  and   they all use the same template or view for processing, exact regular expressions just make the amount  of urls you declare larger. Similarly, if you use A B testing or SEO where lengthier variations of the  same url are processed in the same way  e.g.,  about landing a ,  about landing b ,  about  the+coffeehouse+in+san+diego   broad url matching is much simpler than declaring exact url patterns.  In the end, whether you opt to use exact url regular expression ending in $, I would still recommend you  maintain the practice of keeping finer-grained url regulars at the top and broader ones at the bottom, as this  avoids the unexpected behaviors described in Listing 2-2 when more than one regular expression matches a  url request.  Common Url Patterns Although url regular expressions can have limitless variations – making it next to impossible to describe  each possibility – I’ll provide examples on some of the most common url patterns you’re more likely to use.  Table 2-1 shows individual regular expression characters for Django urls and Table 2-2 shows a series of  more concrete examples with url patterns.  Table 2-1.  Regular expression syntax for Django urls: Symbol  Meaning   ^  Start of url   $  End of url   +  1 or more  occurrences  []  Character grouping   ?  0 or 1 occurrences    ?P ___   Capture  occurrence that matches  regexp ___ and assign it  to name  \  Escape for interpreted  values  {n}  n occurrences     Or   .

Url Parameters, Extra Options, and Query Strings  You just learned how to use a wide variety of regular expressions to create urls for your Django applications.  However, if you look back at Listings 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3, you’ll notice the information provided on the urls is  discarded.  Sometimes it’s helpful or even necessary to pass url information to the processing construct as a   parameter. For example, if you have several urls like  drinks mocha ,  drinks espresso , and  drinks  latte , the last part of the url represents a drink name. Therefore it can be helpful or necessary to relay this  url information to the processing template to display it or use it in some other way in a view  e.g., query a  database . To relay this information the url needs to treat this information as a parameter.  To handle url parameters Django uses Python’s standard regular expression syntax for named groups.2   Listing 2-4 shows a url that creates a parameter named drink_name.  Listing 2-4.  Django url parameter definition for access in templates  urlpatterns = [      url r'^drinks  ?P \D+  ',TemplateView.as_view template_name='drinks index.  html'  ,  ]  Notice the  ?P \D+  syntax in Listing 2-4. The ?P  syntax tells Django to treat this part of  the regular expression as a named group and assign the value to a parameter named drink_name declared  between  . The final piece \D+ is a regular expression to determine the matching value; in this case the  matching value is one or more non-digit characters, as described in Table 2-1.  It’s very important you understand a parameter is only captured if the provided value matches the   specified regular expression  e.g., \D+ for non-digits . For example, for the url request  drinks mocha  the  value mocha is assigned to the drink_name parameter, but for a url like  drinks 123  the regular expression  pattern doesn’t match - because 123 are digits - so no action is taken.  If a url match occurs in Listing 2-4, the request is sent directly to the template drinks index.html.   Django provides access to all parameters defined in this manner through a Django template context variable  with the same name. Therefore to access the parameter you would use the parameter name drink_type  directly in the template. For example, to output the value of the drink_name parameter you would use the  standard {{}} Django template syntax  e.g., {{drink_name}} .  2https:  docs.python.org 3 howto regex.htmlnon-capturing-and-named-groups  35   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  In addition to treating parts of a url as parameters, it’s also possible to define extra options in the url   definition to access them in Django templates as context variables. These extra options are defined inside a  dictionary declared as the last part of the url definition.  For example, look at the following modified url Django definition from Listing 2-4:  url r'^drinks  ?P \D+ ', TemplateView.as_view template_name='drinks index.html' ,  {'onsale':True} ,  Notice how a dictionary with key-values is added at the end of the url definition. In this manner, the   onsale key becomes a url extra option, which is passed to the underlying template as a context variable. Url  extra options are accessed like url parameters as template context variables. So to output the onsale extra  option you would use the {{onsale}} syntax.  Next, let’s take a look at another variation of url parameters illustrated in Listing 2-5, which sends   control to a Django view method.  Listing 2-5.  Django url parameter definition for access in view methods in main urls.py file   Project main urls.py from coffeehouse.stores import views as stores_views  urlpatterns = patterns[     url r'^stores  ?P \d+  ',stores_views.detail , ]  Notice the  ?P \d+  syntax in Listing 2-5 is pretty similar to the one in 2-4. The thing that   changes is the parameter is now named store_id and the regular expression is \d+ to match digits. So, for  example, if a request is made to the url  stores 1  the value 1 is assigned to the store_id parameter and if  a request is made to a url like  stores downtown  the regular expression pattern doesn’t match - because  downtown are letters not digits - so no action is taken.  If a url match occurs for Listing 2-5, the request is sent directly to the Django view method   coffeehouse.stores.views.detail. Where coffeehouse.stores is the package name, views.py the  file inside the stores app and detail the name of the view method. Listing 2-6 illustrates the detail view  method to access the store_id parameter.  Listing 2-6.  Django view method in views.py to access url parameter  from django.shortcuts import render  def detail request,store_id :      Access store_id with 'store_id' variable     return render request,'stores detail.html'   Notice in Listing 2-6 how the detail method has two arguments. The first argument is a request object,  which is always the same for all Django view methods. The second argument is the parameter passed by the  url. It’s important to note the names of url parameters must match the names of the method arguments. In  this case, notice in Listing 2-5 the parameter name is store_id and in Listing 2-6 the method argument is  also named store_id.  With access to the url parameter via the view method argument, the method can execute logic with the   parameter  e.g., query a database  that can then be passed to a Django template for presentation.  36   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views   Django url parameters are always treated as strings, irrespective of the regular expression. For      Caution  example, \d+ catches digits, but a value of one is treated as ‘1’  string , not 1  integer . this is particularly  important if you plan to work with url parameters in view methods and do operations that require something  other than strings.  Another option available for url parameters handled by view methods is to make them optional, which  in turn allows you to leverage the same view method for multiple urls. Parameters can be made optional by  assigning a default value to a view method argument. Listing 2-7 shows a new url that calls the same view  method  coffeehouse.stores.views.detail  but doesn’t define a parameter.  Listing 2-7.  Django urls with optional parameters leveraging the same view method  from coffeehouse.stores import views as stores_views  urlpatterns = patterns[     url r'^stores ',stores_views.detail ,     url r'^stores  ?P \d+  ',stores_views.detail , ]  If you called the url  stores  without modifying the detail method in Listing 2-6, you would get an   error. The error occurs because the detail view method expects a store_id argument, which isn’t provided  by the first url. To fix this problem, you can define a default value for the store_id in the view method, as  illustrated in Listing 2-8.  Listing 2-8.  Django view method in views.py with default value  from django.shortcuts import render  def detail request,store_id='1' :      Access store_id with 'store_id' variable     return render request,'stores detail.html'   Notice in Listing 2-8 how the store_id argument has the assignment ='1'. This means the argument   will have a default value of '1' in case the view method is called without store_id. This approach allows you  to leverage the same view method to handle multiple urls with optional parameters.  In addition to accessing url parameters inside view methods, it’s also possible to access extra options  from the url definition. These extra options are defined inside a dictionary declared as the last argument in  a url definition. After the view method declaration, you add a dictionary with the key-value pairs you wish  to access inside the view method. The following snippet illustrates a modified version of the url statement in  Listing 2-7.  url r'^stores ',stores_views.detail,{'location':'headquarters'}   In this case, the location key becomes a url extra option that’s passed as a parameter to the view   method. Url extra options are accessed just like url parameters, so to access a url extra option inside a view  method you need to modify the method signature to accept an argument with the same name as the url  extra option. In this case, the method signature:  def detail request,store_id='1' :  37   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  needs to change to:  def detail request,store_id='1',location=None :  Notice the location argument is made optional by assigning a default value of None. Finally, it’s also possible to access url parameters separated by ? And & – technically known as a query  string – inside Django view methods. These type of parameters can be accessed inside a view method using  the request object.  Take, for example, the url  stores 1 ?hours=sunday&map=flash, Listing 2-9 illustrates how to extract   the arguments from this url separated by ? and & using request.GET.  Listing 2-9.  Django view method extracting url parameters with request.GET  from django.shortcuts import render  def detail request,store_id='1',location=None :      Access store_id param with 'store_id' variable and location param with 'location'  variable      Extract 'hours' or 'map' value appended to url as      ?hours=sunday&map=flash     hours = request.GET.get 'hours', ''      map = request.GET.get 'map', ''       'hours' has value 'sunday' or '' if hours not in url      'map' has value 'flash' or '' if map not in url     return render request,'stores detail.html'   Listing 2-9 uses the syntax request.GET.get  , '' . If the parameter is present in   request.GET it extracts the value and assigns it to a variable for further usage; if the parameter is not present  then the parameter variable is assigned a default empty value of ''– you could equally use None or any other  default value – as this is part of Python’s standard dictionary get   method syntax to obtain default values.  This last process is designed to extract parameters from an HTTP GET request; however, Django   also supports the syntax request.POST.get to extract parameters from an HTTP POST request, which is  described in greater detail in the chapter on Django forms and later in this chapter in the section on Django  view method requests.  Url Consolidation and Modularization  By default, Django looks up url definitions in the urls.py file inside a project’s main directory - it’s worth  mentioning this is on account of the ROOT_URLCONF variable in settings.py. However, once a project grows  beyond a couple of urls, it can become difficult to manage them inside this single file. For example, look at  the urls.py file illustrated in Listing 2-10.  Listing 2-10.  Django urls.py with no url consolidation  from django.conf.urls import url from django.views.generic import TemplateView from coffeehouse.about import views as about_views from coffeehouse.stores import views as stores_views  38   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html'  ,     url r'^about ',about_views.index ,     url r'^about contact ',about_views.contact ,     url r'^stores ',stores_views.index ,     url r'^stores  ?P \d+  ',stores_views.detail,{'location':'headquarters'} ,    ]  As you can see in Listing 2-10, there are a couple of urls that have redundant roots - about  and   stores . Grouping these urls separately can be helpful because it keeps common urls in their own files and  avoids the difficulties of making changes to one big urls.py file.  Listing 2-11 shows an updated version of the urls.py file with the about  and stores  roots placed in   separate files.  Listing 2-11.  Django urls.py with include to consolidate urls  from django.conf.urls import include, url from django.views.generic import TemplateView  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html'  ,     url r'^about ',include 'coffeehouse.about.urls'  ,     url r'^stores ',include 'coffeehouse.stores.urls' ,{'location':'headquarters'} ,    ]  Listing 2-11 makes use of the include argument to load urls from completely separate files. In this   case, include 'coffeehouse.about.urls'  tells Django to load url definitions from the Python module  coffeehouse.about.urls, which parting from a Django base directory corresponds to the file route   coffeehouse about urls.py. In this case, I kept using the urls.py file name and placed it under the  corresponding Django about app directory since it deals with about  urls. However, you can use any file  name or path you like for url definitions  e.g., coffeehouse.allmyurl.resturls to load urls from a file route   coffeehouse allmyurls resturls.py .  The second include statement in Listing 2-11 works just like the first one, where   include 'coffeehouse.stores.urls'  tells Django to load url definitions from the Python module  coffeehouse.stores.urls. However, notice this second statement appends an additional dictionary as a url  extra option, which means all the urls in the include statement will also receive this extra option.  Listing 2-12 illustrates the contents of the file  coffeehouse about urls.py linked via   include 'coffeehouse.about.urls' .  Listing 2-12.  Django  coffeehouse about urls.py loaded via include  from django.conf.urls import url from . import views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index ,     url r'^contact $',views.contact , ]  39   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  A quick look at Listing 2-12 and you can see the structure is pretty similar to the main urls.py file;   however, there are some minor differences. While the url regular expression r'^$' can look like it matches  the home page, it isn’t. Because the file in Listing 2-12 is linked via include in the main urls.py file, Django  joins the url regular expression with the parent url regular expression. So the first url in Listing 2-12 actually  matches  about  and the second url in Listing 2-12 actually matches  about contact . Also because the  urls.py file in Listing 2-12 is placed alongside the app’s views.py file, the import statement uses the relative  path from . import views syntax.  In addition to using the include option to reference a separate file with url definitions, the include   option can also accept url definitions as a Python list. In essence, this allows you to keep all url definitions in  the main urls.py file, but give it more modularity. This approach is illustrated in Listing 2-13.  Listing 2-13.  Django urls.py with inline include statements  from django.conf.urls import include, url from django.views.generic import TemplateView  from coffeehouse.about import views as about_views from coffeehouse.stores import views as stores_views  store_patterns = [     url r'^$',stores_views.index ,     url r'^ ?P \d+  $',stores_views.detail , ]  about_patterns = [     url r'^$',about_views.index ,     url r'^contact $',about_views.contact , ]  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html'  ,     url r'^about ',include about_patterns  ,     url r'^stores ',include store_patterns ,{'location':'headquarters'} ,    ]  The outcome of the url patterns in Listing 2-13 is the same as Listings 2-11 and 2-12. The difference is  Listing 2-13 uses the main urls.py file to declare multiple url lists, while Listings 2-11 and 2-12 rely on url  lists declared in different files.  Url Naming and Namespaces  A project’s internal links or url references  e.g.,  Home Page   tend to be hard-coded,  whether it’s in view methods to redirect users to certain locations or in templates to provide adequate user  navigation. Hard-coding links can present a serious maintenance problem as a project grows, because it  leads to links that are difficult to detect and fix. Django offers a way to name urls so it’s easy to reference  them in view methods and templates.  The most basic technique to name Django urls is to add the name attribute to url definitions in urls. py. Listing 2-14 shows how to name a project’s home page, as well as how to reference this url from a view  method or template.  40   Listing 2-14.  Django url using name   Definition in urls.py url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html' ,name="homepage"   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views   Definition in view method from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  def method request :     ....     return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'homepage'     Definition in template  Back to home page   The url definition in Listing 2-14 uses the regular expression r'^$' that translates into   or the home  page, also known as the root directory. Notice the name attribute with the homepage value. By assigning the  url a name you can use this value as a reference in view methods and templates, which means any future  changes made to the url regular expression, automatically update all url definitions in view methods and  templates.  Next in Listing 2-14 you can see a view method example that redirects control to reverse 'homepage' .  The Django reverse method attempts to look up a url definition by the given name - in this case homepage -  and substitutes it accordingly. Similarly, the link sample  Back to home  page  in Listing 2-14 makes use of the Django {% url %} tag, which attempts to look up a url by its first  argument - in this case homepage - and substitute it accordingly.  This same naming and substitution process is available for more complex url definitions, such as those   with parameters. Listing 2-15 shows the process for a url with parameters.  Listing 2-15.  Django url with arguments using name   Definition in urls.py url r'^drinks  ?P \D+  ',TemplateView.as_view template_name='drinks index. html' ,name="drink" ,   Definition in view method from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  def method request :     ....     return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'drink', args= drink.name,      Definition in template  Drink on sale    Drink on sale   The url definition in Listing 2-15 uses a more complex regular expression with a parameter that   translates into urls in the form  drinks latte  or  drinks espresso . In this case, the url is given the  argument name drink_name.  41   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Because the url uses a parameter, the syntax for the reverse method and {% url %} tag are slightly   different. The reverse method requires the url parameters be provided as a tuple to the args variable  and the {% url %} tag requires the url arguments be provided as a list of values. Notice in Listing 2-15 the  parameters can equally be variables or hard-coded values, so long as it matches the url argument regular  expression type - which in this case is non-digits.  For url definitions with more than one argument, the approach to using reverse and {% url %} is   identical. For the reverse method you pass it a tuple with all the necessary parameters and for the {% url %}  tag you pass it a list of values.   Beware of invalid url definitions with reverse and {% url %}. Django always checks at startup that      Caution  all reverse and {% url %} definitions are valid. this means that if you make an error in a reverse method or {%  url %} tag definition - like a typo in the url name or the arguments types don’t match the regular expression -  the application won’t start and throw an http 500 internal error.  the error for this kind of situation is NoReverseMatch at....Reverse for 'urlname' with arguments '  '  and keyword arguments '{}' not found. X pattern s  tried. if you look at the error stack you’ll be able  to pinpoint where this is happening and correct it. just be aware this is a fatal error and if it is not isolated to  the view or page where it happens, it will stop the entire application at startup.  Sometimes the use of the name attribute by itself is not sufficient to classify urls. What happens if you  have two or three index pages? Or if you have two urls that qualify as details, but one is for stores and the  other for drinks?  A crude approach would be to use composite names  e.g., drink_details, store_details . However, the   use of composite names in this form can lead to difficult-to-remember naming conventions and sloppy  hierarchies. A cleaner approach supported by Django is through the namespace attribute.  The namespace attribute allows a group of urls to be identified with a unique qualifier. Because the  namespace attribute is associated with a group of urls, it’s used in conjunction with the include method  described earlier to consolidate urls.  Listing 2-16 illustrates a series of url definitions that make use of the namespace attribute with include.  Listing 2-16.  Django urls.py with namespace attribute   Main urls.py from django.conf.urls import include, url  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html' ,name="homepage" ,     url r'^about ',include 'coffeehouse.about.urls',namespace="about"  ,     url r'^stores ',include 'coffeehouse.stores.urls',namespace="stores"  , ]   About urls.py from . import views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index,name="index" ,     url r'^contact $',views.contact,name="contact" , ]  42   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views   Stores urls.py from . import views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index,name="index" ,     url r'^ ?P \d+  $',views.detail,name="detail" ,     Definition in view method from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  def method request :     ....     return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'about:index'     Definition in template  Back to stores index   Listing 2-16 starts with a set of include definitions typical of a main Django urls.py file. Notice both   definitions use the namespace attribute. Next, you can see the urls.py files referenced in the main urls. py file that make use of the name attribute described in the past example. Notice both the about and stores  urls.py files have a url with name='index'.  To qualify a url name with a namespace you use the syntax  : . As you can see toward  the bottom of Listing 2-16, to reference the index in the about urls.py you use about:index and to reference  the index in the stores urls.py file you use stores:index.  The namespace attribute can also be nested to use the syntax  : :<namespac  e3>:  to reference urls. Listing 2-17 shows an example of nested namespace attributes.  Listing 2-17.  Django urls.py with nested namespace attribute   Main urls.py from django.conf.urls import include, url from django.views.generic import TemplateView  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html' ,name="homepage" ,     url r'^stores ',include 'coffeehouse.stores.urls',namespace="stores"  , ]   Stores urls.py from . import views   About urls.py from . import views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index,name="index" ,     url r'^ ?P \d+  $',views.detail,name="detail" ,     url r'^ ?P \d+  about ',include 'coffeehouse.about.urls',namespace="about"  , ]  43   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index,name="index" ,     url r'^contact $',views.contact,name="contact" , ]   Definition in view method from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  def method request :     ....     return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'stores:about:index', args= store.id,      Definition in template  See about for {{store.name}}   The url structure in Listing 2-17 differs from Listing 2-16 in that it creates about urls for each store  e.g.,    stores 1 about   instead of having a generic about url  e.g.,  about  . At the top of Listing 2-17 we use  namespace="stores" to qualify all urls in the stores urls.py file.  Next, inside the stores urls.py file notice there’s another include element with namespace="about" to  qualify all urls in the about urls.py. And finally inside the about urls.py file, there are urls that just use the  name attribute. In the last part of Listing 2-17, you can see how nested namespaces are used with the reverse  method and {% url %} tag using a : to separate namespaces.  In 99% of Django urls you can use the name and namespace parameters just as they been described.  However, the namespace parameter takes on special meaning when you deploy multiple instances of the  same Django app in the same project.  Since Django apps are self-contained units with url definitions, it raises an edge case even if Django   apps use url namespaces. What happens if a Django app uses namespace X, but you want to deploy the app  two or three times in the same project? How do you reference urls in each app, given they’re all written to  use namespace X? This is where the term instance namespace and the app_name attribute come into the  picture.  Let’s walk through a scenario that uses multiple instances of the same Django app to illustrate   this edge case associated with url namespaces. Let’s say you develop a Django app called banners to  display advertisements. The banners app is built in such a way that it has to run on different urls  e.g.,   coffeebanners , teabanners , foodbanners   to simplify the selection of banners. In essence, you are  required to run multiple instances of the banners app in the same project, each one on different urls.  So what’s the problem of multiple app instances and url naming? It has to do with using named urls that   need to change dynamically based on the current app instance. This issue is easiest to understand with an  example, so let’s jump to the example in Listing 2-18.  Listing 2-18.  Django urls.py with multiple instances of the same app   Main urls.py from django.conf.urls import include, url  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html' ,name="homepage" ,     url r'^coffeebanners ',include 'coffeehouse.banners.urls',namespace="coffee-banners"  ,     url r'^teabanners ',include 'coffeehouse.banners.urls',namespace="tea-banners"  ,     url r'^foodbanners ',include 'coffeehouse.banners.urls',namespace="food-banners"  , ]  44   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views   Banners urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from . import views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index,name="index" , ]   Definition in view method from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  def method request :     ....     return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'coffee-banners:index'       return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'tea-banners:index'       return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'food-banners:index'     Definition in template  Coffee banners   Tea banners   Food banners   In Listing 2-18 you can see we have three urls that point to the same coffeehouse.banners.urls file   and each has its own unique namespace. Next, let’s take a look at the various reverse method and {% url  %} tag examples in Listing 2-18.  Both the reverse method and {% url %} tag examples in Listing 2-18 resolve to the three different url  names using the  :  syntax. So you can effectively deploy multiple instances of the same  Django app using just namespace and name.  However, by relying on just namespace and name the resolved url names cannot adapt dynamically to   the different app instances, which is an edge case associated with internal app logic that must be included to  support multiple instances of a Django app. Now let’s take a look at both a view and template scenario that  illustrates this scenario and how the app_name attribute solves this problem.  Suppose inside the banners app you want to redirect control to the app’s main index url  e.g., due to  an exception . Now put on an app designer hat, how would you resolve this problem? As an app designer  you don’t even know about the coffee-banners, tea-banners or food-banners namespaces, as these are  deployment namespaces. How would you internally integrate a redirect in the app that adapts to multiple  instances of the app being deployed? This is the purpose of the app_name parameter.  Listing 2-19 illustrates how to leverage the app_name attribute to dynamically determine where to make   a redirect.  Listing 2-19.  Django redirect that leverages app_name to determine url   Main urls.py from django.conf.urls import include, url  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html' ,name="homepage" ,     url r'^coffeebanners ',include 'coffeehouse.banners.urls',namespace="coffee-banners"  ,     url r'^teabanners ',include 'coffeehouse.banners.urls',namespace="tea-banners"  ,     url r'^foodbanners ',include 'coffeehouse.banners.urls',namespace="food-banners"  , ]  45   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views   Banners urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from . import views  app_name = 'banners_adverts' urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index,name="index" , ]   Logic inside Banners app from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  def method request :     ....     try:        ...     except:        return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect reverse 'banners_adverts:index'    Notice the urls.py file in Listing 2-19 of the banners app sets the app_name attribute before declaring  the urlpatterns value. Next, notice the reverse method in Listing 2-19 uses the banners_adverts:index  value, where banners_adverts represents the app_name. This is an important convention, because Django  relies on the same syntax to search for app_name or namespace matches.  So to what url do you think banners_adverts:index resolves to? It all depends on where the   navigation takes place, it’s dynamic! If a user is navigating through the coffee-banners app instance  i.e., url  coffeebanners  then Django resolves banners_adverts:index to the coffee-banners instance index, if a  user is navigating through the tea-banners app instance  i.e., url teabanners  then Django resolves banners_ adverts:index to the tea-banners instance index, and so on for any other number of instances. In case a  user is navigating outside of a banners app instance  i.e., there is no app instance  then Django defaults to  resolving banners_adverts:index to the last defined instance in urls.py, which would be food-banners. In this manner and based on where the request path instance a user is coming from  e.g., if the user is on a   path with  coffeebanners  or  teabanners  , the reverse method resolves banners_adverts:index dynamically  to one of the three url app instances vs. hard-coding specific url namespaces as shown in Listing 2-18.  Now let’s assume the banners app has an internal template with a link to the app’s main index url.   Similarly, how would you generate this link in the template to take into account the possibility of multiple  app instances? Relying on the same app_name parameter solves this problem for the template link illustrated  in Listing 2-20.  Listing 2-20.  Django template link that leverages app_name to determine url   template banners index.html  {% url 'banners_adverts:index' %}   Notice the {% url %} tag in Listing 2-20 points to banners_adverts:index. The resolution process for the  banners_adverts:index is the same outlined in the previous method example that uses the reverse method.  If a user is navigating through the coffee-banners app instance  i.e., url coffeebanners  then Django   resolves banners_adverts:index to the coffee-banners instance index, if a user is navigating through  the tea-banners app instance  i.e., url teabanners  then Django resolves banners_adverts:index to the  tea-banners instance index, and so on for any other number of instances. In case a user is navigating  outside of a banners app instance  i.e., there is no app instance  then Django defaults to resolving banners_ adverts:index to the last defined instance in urls.py that would be food-banners.  46   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  As you can see, the app_name attribute’s purpose is to give Django app designers an internal mechanism  by which to integrate logic for named urls that dynamically adapt to multiple instances of the same app. For  this reason, it’s not as widely used for url naming and can be generally foregone in most cases in favor of just  using the namespace and name attributes.  View Method Requests  So far you’ve worked with Django view methods and their input – a request object and parameters – as well  as their output, consisting of generating a direct response or relying on a template to generate a response.  However, now it’s time to take a deeper look at what’s available in view method requests and the various  alternatives to generate view method responses.  The request reference you’ve placed unquestionably in view methods up to this point, is an instance  of the django.http.request.HttpRequest class.3 This request object contains information set by entities  present before a view method: a user’s web browser, the web server that runs the application, or a Django  middleware class configured on the application.  The following list shows some of the most common attributes and methods available in a request   reference:  	  	  request.method.- Contains the HTTP method used for the request  e.g., GET, POST .  request.GET or request.POST.- Contains parameters added as part of a GET or  POST request, respectively. Parameters are enclosed as a django.http.request. QueryDict4 instance.  	  request.POST.get 'name',default=None .- Gets the value of the name  parameter in a POST request or gets None if the parameter is not present. Note  default can be overridden with a custom value.   	  request.GET.getlist 'drink',default=None .- Gets a list of values for the  drink parameter in a GET request or gets an empty list None if the parameter is  not present. Note default can be overridden with a custom value.   	   	  request.META.- Contains HTTP headers added by browsers or a web server as part of  the request. Parameters are enclosed in a standard Python dictionary where keys are  the HTTP header names – in uppercase and underscore  e.g., Content-Length as key  CONTENT_LENGTH .  	  request.META['REMOTE_ADDR'].- Gets a user's remote IP address.  request.user.- Contains information about a Django user  e.g., username, email   linked to the request. Note user refers to the user in the django.contrib.auth  package and is set via Django middleware, described later in this chapter.  As you can attest from this brief list, the request reference contains a lot of actionable information to   fulfill business logic  e.g., you can respond with certain content based on geolocation information from  a user's IP address . There are well over 50 request options available between django.http.request. HttpRequest and django.http.request.QueryDict attributes and methods, all of which are explained in  parts of the book where they’re pertinent – however you can review the full extent of request options in the  footnote links in the previous page.  3https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 _modules django http request HttpRequest 4https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 _modules django http request QueryDict  47   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Once you’re done extracting information from a request reference and doing related business logic   with it  e.g., querying a database, fetching data from a third-party REST service , you then need to set up data  in a view method to send it out as part of a response.  To set up data in a Django view method, you first need to declare it or extract it inside the method body.   You can declare strings, numbers, lists, tuples, dictionaries, or any other Python data structure.  Once you declare or extract the data inside a view method, you create a dictionary to make the data   accessible on Django templates. The dictionary keys represent the reference names for the template, while  the values are the data structures themselves. Listing 2-21 illustrates a view method that declares multiple  data structures and passes them to a Django template.  Listing 2-21.  Set up dictionary in Django view method for access in template  from django.shortcuts import render  def detail request,store_id='1',location=None :      Create fixed data structures to pass to template      data could equally come from database queries      web services or social APIs     STORE_NAME = 'Downtown'     store_address = {'street':'Main 385','city':'San Diego','state':'CA'}     store_amenities = ['WiFi','A C']     store_menu =   0,'' , 1,'Drinks' , 2,'Food'       values_for_template = {'store_name':STORE_NAME, 'store_address':store_address, 'store_ amenities':store_amenities, 'store_menu':store_menu}     return render request,'stores detail.html', values_for_template   Notice in Listing 2-21 how the render method includes the values_for_template dictionary. In  previous examples, the render method just included the request object and a template to handle the  request. In Listing 2-21, a dictionary is passed as the last render argument. By specifying a dictionary as the  last argument, the dictionary becomes available to the template - which in this case is stores detail.html.     Tip   if you plan to access the same data on multiple templates, instead of declaring it on multiple views,  you can use a context processor to declare it once and make it accessible on all project templates. the next  chapter on Django templates discusses this topic.  The dictionary in Listing 2-21 contains keys and values that are data structures declared in the method   body. The dictionary keys become references to access the values inside Django templates.  OUTPUT VIEW METHOD DICTIONARY IN DJANGO TEMPLATES  although the next chapter covers Django templates in depth, the following snippet shows how to output  the dictionary values in listing 2-21 using the {{}} syntax.   {{store_name}} store   {{store_address.street}}   {{store_address.city}},{{store_address.state}}     We offer: {{store_amenities.0}} and {{store_amenities.1}}   Menu includes : {{store_menu.1.1}} and {{store_menu.2.1}}   48   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  the first declaration {{store_name}} uses the stand-alone key to display the Downtown value. the  other access declarations use dot .  notation because the values themselves are composite data  structures.  the store_address key contains a dictionary, so to access the internal dictionary values you use   the internal dictionary key separated by a dot . . store_address.street displays the street value,  store_address.city displays the city value, and store_address.state displays the state value.  the store_amenities key contains a list that uses a similar dot .  notation to access internal values.  however, since python lists don’t have keys you use the list index number. store_amenities.0   displays the first item in list store_amenities and store_amenities.1 displays the second item in list  store_amenities.  the store_menu key contains a tuple of tuples that also requires a number on account of the lack of  keys. {{store_menu.1.1}} displays the second tuple value of the second tuple value of store_menu  and {{store_menu.2.1}} displays the second tuple value of the third tuple of store_menu.  View Method Responses  The render   method to generate view method responses you’ve used up to this point is actually a shortcut.  You can see toward the top of Listing 2-21, the render   method is part of the django.shortcuts package.  This means there are other alternatives to the render   method to generate a view response, albeit the  render   method is the most common technique. For starters, there are three similar variations to generate  view method responses with data backed by a template, as illustrated in Listing 2-22.  Listing 2-22.  Django view method response alternatives   Option 1  from django.shortcuts import render  def detail request,store_id='1',location=None :     ...     return render request,'stores detail.html', values_for_template    Option 2  from django.template.response import TemplateResponse  def detail request,store_id='1',location=None :     ...     return TemplateResponse request, 'stores detail.html', values_for_template    Option 3  from django.http import HttpResponse from django.template import loader, Context  def detail request,store_id='1',location=None :      ...      response = HttpResponse        t = loader.get_template 'stores detail.html'       c = Context values_for_template       return response.write t.render c    49   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  The first option in Listing 2-22 is the django.shortcuts.render   method that shows three arguments   to generate a response: the  required  request reference, a  required  template route and an  optional   dictionary – also known as the context – with data to pass to the template.  There are three more  optional  arguments for the render   method that are not shown in Listing 2-22:   content_type that sets the HTTP Content-Type header for the response and which defaults to DEFAULT_ CONTENT_TYPE parameter in settings.py, which in itself defaults to text html; status that sets the HTTP  Status code for the response that defaults to 200; and using to specify the template engine – either jinja2  or django – to generate the response. The next section on HTTP handling for the render   method describes  how to use content_type & status, while Chapters 3 and 4 talk about Django and Jinja template engines.  The second option in Listing 2-22 is the django.template.response.TemplateResponse   class, which   in terms of input is nearly identical to the render   method. The difference between the two variations is  that TemplateResponse   can alter a response once a view method is finished  e.g., via middleware , where  as the render   method is considered the last step in the life cycle after a view method finishes. You should  use TemplateResponse   when you foresee the need to modify view method responses in multiple view  methods after they finish their work, a technique that’s discussed in a later section in this chapter on view  method middleware.  There are four more  optional  arguments for the TemplateResponse   class that are not shown in  Listing 2-22: content_type that defaults to text html; status that defaults to 200; charset that sets the  response encoding from the HTTP Content-Type header or DEFAULT_CHARSET in settings.py that in itself  defaults to utf-8; and using to indicate the template engine – either jinja2 or django – to generate the  response.  The third option in Listing 2-22 represents the longest, albeit the most flexible response creation   process. This process first creates a raw HTTPResponse instance, then loads a template with the django. template.loader.get_template   method, creates a Context   class to load values into the template, and  finally writes a rendered template with its context to the HTTPResponse instance. Although this is the longest  of the three options, it’s the preferred choice when a view method response requires advanced options.  The upcoming section on built-in response shortcuts for inline and streamed content, has more details on  HTTPResponse response types.  Response Options for HTTP Status and Content-Type Headers Browsers set HTTP headers in requests to tell applications to take into account certain characteristics for  processing. Similarly, applications set HTTP headers in responses to tell browsers to take into account  certain characteristics for the content being sent out. Among the most important HTTP headers set by  applications like Django are Status and Content-Type.  The HTTP Status header is a three-digit code number to indicate the response status for a given   request. Examples of Status values are 200, which is the standard response for successful HTTP requests  and 404, which is used to indicate a requested resource could not be found. The HTTP Content-Type header  is a MIME  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions  type string to indicate the type of content in a response.  Examples of Content-Type values are text html, which is the standard for an HTML content response and  image gif, which is used to indicate a response is a GIF image.  By default and unless there’s an error, all Django view methods that create a response with django. shortcuts.render  , a TemplateResponse   class, or HttpResponse   class – illustrated in Listing 2-22  – create a response with the HTTP Status value set to 200 and the HTTP Content-Type set to text html.  Although these default values are the most common, if you want to send a different kind of response  e.g., an  error or non-HTML content  it’s necessary to alter these values.  Overriding HTTP Status and Content-Type header values for any of the three options in Listing 2-22   is as simple as providing the additional arguments status and or content_type. Listing 2-23 illustrates  various examples of this process.  50   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Listing 2-23.  HTTP Content-type and HTTP Status for Django view method responses  from django.shortcuts import render   No method body s  and only render   example provided for simplicity   Returns content type text plain, with default HTTP 200 return render request,'stores menu.csv', values_for_template, content_type='text plain'    Returns HTTP 404, wtih default text html  NOTE: Django has a built-in shortcut & template 404 response, described in the next  section return render request,'custom notfound.html',status=404    Returns HTTP 500, wtih default text html  NOTE: Django has a built-in shortcut & template 500 response, described in the next  section return render request,'custom internalerror.html',status=500    Returns content type application json, with default HTTP 200  NOTE: Django has a built-in shortcut JSON response, described in the next section return render request,'stores menu.json', values_for_template, content_type='application json'   The first example in Listing 2-23 is designed to return a response with plain text content. Notice the   render method content_type argument. The second and third examples in Listing 2-23 set the HTTP  Status code to 404 and 500. Because the HTTP Status 404 code is used for resources that are not found, the  render method uses a special template for this purpose. Similarly, because the HTTP Status 500 code is  used to indicate an error, the render method also uses a special template for this purpose.     Tip   Django has built-in shortcuts and templates to deal with http Status codes 404 and 500, as well as  a json short-cut response, all of which are described in the next section and that you can use instead of the  examples in listing 2-23.  The fourth and last example in Listing 2-23 is designed to return a response with JavaScript Object   Notation JSON  content. The HTTP Content-Type application json is a common requirement for  requests made by browsers that consume JavaScript data via Asynchronous JavaScript  AJAX .  Built-In Response Shortcuts and Templates for Common HTTP  Status: 404  Not Found , 500  Internal Server Error , 400  Bad  Request , and 403  Forbidden  Although Django automatically triggers an HTTP 404 Status  Not Found  response when a page is not found  and also triggers an HTTP 500 Status  Internal Server Error  response when an unhandled exception is  thrown in a view, it has built-in shortcuts and templates that are meant to be used explicitly in Django views  when you know end users should get them. Table 2-3 illustrates the different shortcuts to trigger certain  HTTP status responses.  51   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Table 2-3.  Django shortcut exceptions to trigger HTTP statuses  Python code sample  HTTP status code  404  Not Found   500  Internal Server Error  400  Bad Request   403  Forbidden   from django.http import Http404 raise Http404 raise Exception from django.core.exceptions import SuspiciousOperation raise SuspiciousOperation  from django.core.exceptions import PermissionDenied raise PermissionDenied  *Django automatically handles not found pages raising HTTP 404 and unhandled exceptions raising HTTP 500  As you can see in the examples in Table 2-3, the shortcut syntax is straightforward. For example, you can  make evaluations in a Django view like if article_id < 100: or if unpayed_subscription: and based on  the result throw exceptions from Table 2-3 so end users get the proper HTTP status response.  So what is the actual content sent in a response besides the HTTP status when an exception from   Table 2-3 is triggered? The default for HTTP 400  Bad Request  and HTTP 403  Forbidden  is a single line  HTML page that says “Bad Request  400 ” and “403 Forbidden”, respectively. For HTTP 404  Not Found   and HTTP 500  Internal Server Error , it depends on the DEBUG value in settings.py.  If a Django project has DEBUG=True in settings.py, HTTP 404  Not Found  generates a page with the   available urls - as illustrated in Figure 2-1 - and HTTP 500  Internal Server Error  generates a page with  the detailed error - as illustrated in Figure 2-2. If a Django project has DEBUG=False in settings.py, HTTP  404  Not Found  generates a single line HTML page that says “Not Found. The requested URL <url_ location> was not found on this server.” and HTTP 500  Internal Server Error  generates a single line  HTML page that says “A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator".  Figure 2-1.  HTTP 404 for Django project when DEBUG=True  52   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Figure 2-2.  HTTP 500 for Django project when DEBUG=True  It’s also possible to override the default response page for all the previous HTTP codes with custom   templates. To use a custom response page, you need to create a template with the desired HTTP code and  .html extension. For example, for HTTP 403 you would create the 403.html template and for HTTP 500  you would create the 500.html template. All these custom HTTP response templates need to be placed in a  folder defined in the DIRS list of the TEMPLATES variable so Django finds them before it uses the default HTTP  response templates.     Caution    Custom 404.html and 500.html pages only work when DeBUg=False.  If DEBUG=True, it doesn’t matter if you have 404.html or 500.html templates in the right location,   Django uses the default response behavior illustrated in Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2, respectively. You need to  set DEBUG=False for the custom 404.html and 500.html templates to work.  On certain occasions, using custom HTTP response templates may not be enough. For example, if you  want to add context data to a custom template that handles an HTTP response, you need to customize the  built-in Django HTTP view methods themselves, because there’s no other way to pass data into this type  of template. To customize the built-in Django HTTP view methods you need to declare special handlers in  a project’s urls.py file. Listing 2-24 illustrates the urls.py file with custom handlers for Django’s built-in  HTTP Status view methods.  Listing 2-24.  Override built-in Django HTTP Status view methods in urls.py   Overrides the default 400 handler django.views.defaults.bad_request handler400 = 'coffeehouse.utils.views.bad_request'  Overrides the default 403 handler django.views.defaults.permission_denied handler403 = 'coffeehouse.utils.views.permission_denied'  Overrides the default 404 handler django.views.defaults.page_not_found  53   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  handler404 = 'coffeehouse.utils.views.page_not_found'  Overrides the default 500 handler django.views.defaults.server_error handler500 = 'coffeehouse.utils.views.server_error'  urlpatterns = [.... ]   if DeBUg=true, the handler404 and handler500 handlers won’t work, Django keeps using the      Caution  built-in Django http view methods. You need to set DeBUg=False for the handler404 and handler500 handlers  to work.  As you can see in Listing 2-24, there are a series of variables in urls.py right above the standard  urlpatterns variable. Each variable in Listing 2-24 represents an HTTP Status handler, with its value  corresponding to a custom Django view to process requests. For example, handler400 indicates that all  HTTP 400 requests should be handled by the Django view method coffeehouse.utils.views.bad_request  instead of the default django.views.defaults.bad_request. The same approach is taken for HTTP 403  requests using handler403, HTTP 404 requests using handler404 and HTTP 500 requests using handler500.  As far as the actual structure of custom Django view methods is concerned, they are identical to any   other Django view method. Listing 2-26 shows the structure of the custom view methods used in Listing 2-25.  Listing 2-25.  Custom views to override built-in Django HTTP view methods  from django.shortcuts import render  def page_not_found request :      Dict to pass to template, data could come from DB query     values_for_template = {}     return render request,'404.html',values_for_template,status=404   def server_error request :      Dict to pass to template, data could come from DB query     values_for_template = {}     return render request,'500.html',values_for_template,status=500   def bad_request request :      Dict to pass to template, data could come from DB query     values_for_template = {}     return render request,'400.html',values_for_template,status=400   def permission_denied request :      Dict to pass to template, data could come from DB query     values_for_template = {}     return render request,'403.html',values_for_template,status=403   As you can see in Listing 2-26, the custom HTTP view methods use the same render method from   django.shortcuts as the previous view method examples. The methods point to a template named by the  HTTP Status code, use a custom data dictionary that becomes accessible on the template and uses the  status argument to indicate the HTTP status code.  54   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Built-In Response Shortcuts for Inline and Streamed Content All the prior view response examples have worked on the basis of content being structured through a  template. However, there can be times when using a template to output a response is unnecessary  e.g., a  one-line response that says “Nothing to see here” .  Other times it makes no sense for a response to use a template, such is the case for HTTP 301    Permanent Redirect  or HTTP 302  Redirect  where the response just requires a redirection url. Table 2-4  illustrates the different shortcuts to trigger HTTP redirects.  Table 2-4.  Django shortcuts for HTTP redirects  HTTP status code  Python code sample  301  Permanent Redirect   from django.http import HttpResponsePermanentRedirect return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect “ ”   302  Redirect   from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect return HttpResponseRedirect “ ”   Both samples in Table 2-4 redirect to an application’s home page  i.e., " " . However, you can also set the   redirection to any application url or even a full url on a different domain  e.g., http:  maps.google.com  .  In addition to response redirection shortcuts, Django also offers a series of response shortcuts where  you can add inline responses. Table 2-5 illustrates the various other shortcuts for HTTP status codes with  inline content responses.  Table 2-5.  Django shortcuts for inline and streaming content responses  Purpose or HTTP Status code  Python code sample  304  NOT MODIFIED   400  BAD REQUEST   404  NOT FOUND   403  FORBIDDEN   405  METHOD NOT ALLOWED   410  GONE   500  INTERNAL SERVER ERROR   from django.http import HttpResponseNotModified return HttpResponseNotModified  * from django.http import HttpResponseBadRequest return HttpResponseBadRequest “ The request doesn’t  look right ”  from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound return HttpResponseNotFound “ Ups, we can’t find  that page ”  from django.http import HttpResponseForbidden return HttpResponseForbidden “Can’t look at anything  here”,content_type=“text plain”  from django.http import HttpResponseNotAllowed return HttpResponseNotAllowed “ Method not  allowed ”  from django.http import HttpResponseGone return HttpResponseGone “No longer here”,content_ type=“text plain”  from django.http import HttpResponseServerError return HttpResponseServerError “ Ups, that’s a mistake  on our part, sorry! ”    continued   55   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Table 2-5.   continued  Purpose or HTTP Status code  Inline response that serializes data to JSON   Defaults to HTTP 200 and content type  application json   Inline response that stream data  Defaults   to HTTP 200 and streaming content, which   is an iterator of strings  Inline response that stream binary files   Defaults to HTTP 200 and streaming   content   Python code sample  from django.http import JsonResponse data_dict = {’name’:’Downtown’,’address’:’Main  385’,’city’:’San Diego’,’state’:’CA’} return JsonResponse data_dict  from django.http import StreamingHttpResponse return StreamingHttpResponse large_data_structure   from django.http import FileResponse return FileResponse open ’Report.pdf’,’rb’    Inline response with any HTTP status code   Defaults to HTTP 200   from django.http import HttpResponse return HttpResponse “ Django inline response ”   * The HTTP 304 status code indicates a “Not Modified” response, so you can't send content in the response, it  should always be empty.  As you can see in the samples in Table 2-5, there are multiple shortcuts to generate different HTTP   Status responses with inline content and entirely forgo the need to use a template. In addition, you can see  the shortcuts in Table 2-5 can also accept the content_type argument if the content is something other than  HTML  i.e., content_type=text html .  Since non-HTML responses have become quite common in web applications, you can see Table 2-5    also shows three Django built-in response shortcuts to output non-HTML content. The JsonResponse class  is used to transform an inline response into JavaScript Object Notation  JSON . Because this response  converts the payload to a JSON data structure, it automatically sets the content type to application json.  The StreamingHttpResponse class is designed to stream a response without the need to have the entire  payload in-memory, a scenario that’s helpful for large payload responses. The FileResponse class – a  subclass of StreamingHttpResponse – is designed to stream binary data  e.g., PDF or image files .  This takes us to the last entry in Table 2-5, the HttpResponse class. As it turns out, all the shortcuts in   Table 2-5 are customized subclasses of the HttpResponse class, which I initially described in Listing 2-22 as  one of the most flexible techniques to create view responses.  The HttpResponse method is helpful to create responses for HTTP status codes that don’t have direct   shortcut methods  e.g., HTTP 408 [Request Timeout], HTTP 429 [Too Many Requests]  or to inclusively  harness a template to generate inline responses as illustrated in Listing 2-26.  Listing 2-26.  HttpResponse with template and custom CSV file download  from django.http import HttpResponse from django.utils import timezone from django.template import loader, Context  response = HttpResponse content_type='text csv'  response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename=Users_%s.csv' % str timezone.now  . today    t = loader.get_template 'dashboard users_csvexport.html'  c = Context {'users': sorted_users,}  response.write t.render c   return response  56   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  The HTTPResponse object in Listing 2-26 is generated with a text csv content type to advise the  requesting party  e.g., browser  that it’s about to receive CSV content. Next, the Content-Disposition  header also tells the requesting party  e.g., browser  to attempt to download the content as a file named  Users_%s.csv where the %s is substituted with the current server date.  Next, using the loader module we use the get_template method to load the template users_  csvexport.html that will have a CSV-like structure with data placeholders. Then we create a Context object  to hold the data that will fill the template, which in this case it’s just a single variable named users. Next, we  call the template’s render method with the context object in order to fill in the template’s data placeholders  with the data. Finally, the rendered template is written to the response object via the write method and the  response object is returned.  The HttpResponse class offers over 20 options between attributes and methods,5 in addition to the   content_type and status parameters.  View Method Middleware  In most circumstances, data in requests and responses is added, removed, or updated in a piecemeal  fashion in view methods. However, sometimes it’s convenient to apply these changes on all requests and  responses.  For example, if you want to access certain data on all view methods, it’s easier to use a middleware  class to make this data accessible across all requests. Just as if you want to enforce a security check on all  responses, it’s easier to do so globally with a middleware class.  Since middleware is a rather abstract concept, before I describe the structure of a Django middleware   class, I’ll walk you through the various built-in Django middleware classes so you can get a firmer  understanding of where middleware is good design choice.  Built-In Middleware Classes Django comes equipped with a series of middleware classes, some of which are enabled by default on all  Django projects. If you open a Django project’s settings.py file you’ll notice the MIDDLEWARE variable whose  default contents are shown in Listing 2-27.  Listing 2-27.  Default Django middleware classes in MIDDLEWARE  MIDDLEWARE = [     'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',     'django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware',     'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',     'django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware',     'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',     'django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware',     'django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware', ]  As you can see in Listing 2-27, Django projects in their out-of-the-box state come enabled with seven   middleware classes, so all requests and responses are set to run through these seven classes. If you plan  to leverage Django’s main features, I advise you not to remove any of these default middleware classes.  However, you can leave the MIDDLEWARE variable empty if you wish; just be aware doing so may break certain  Django functionalities.  5https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref request-response django.http.HttpResponse  57   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  To give you a better understanding of what the Django middleware classes in Listing 2-27 do and help  you make a more informed decision to disable them or not, Table 2-6 describes the functionality for each of  these middleware classes.  Table 2-6.  Django default middleware classes and functionality  Middleware class  Functionality  django.middleware.security. SecurityMiddleware  Provides security enhancements, such as:      SSL redirects based on the SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT and   django.contrib.sessions.middleware. SessionMiddleware django.middleware.common. CommonMiddleware  django.middleware.csrf. CsrfViewMiddleware  django.contrib.auth.middleware. AuthenticationMiddleware  django.contrib.messages.middleware. MessageMiddleware  SECURE_SSL_HOST settings.       Strict transport security through a variety of settings. Enables session support.  Provides a common set of features, such as:      Forbidding access to user agents in the DISALLOWED_USER_  AGENTS setting, which can be a list of compiled regular  expression objects.       Performing url rewriting based on the APPEND_SLASH and   PREPEND_WWW settings in order to normalize urls.       Setting the HTTP Content-Length header for non-streaming   responses.  Adds protection against Cross Site Request Forgeries by adding  hidden form fields to POST forms and checking requests for the  correct value. Adds the user attribute, representing the currently logged-in user,  to every incoming HttpRequest object. NOTE: This middleware  class depends on functionality from the middleware django. contrib.sessions.middleware. SessionMiddleware and must appear  after it. Enables cookie-based and session-based message support.  NOTE: This middleware class depends on functionality  from the middleware django.contrib.sessions.middleware.  SessionMiddleware and must appear after it.  django.middleware.clickjacking. XFrameOptionsMiddleware  Provides clickjacking protection via the X-Frame-Options  header. For more details on what is clickjacking see: http:   en.wikipedia.org wiki Clickjacking.  As you can see in Table 2-6, although the purpose of the various default middleware classes varies   considerably, their functionality applies to features that need to be applied across all requests or responses  in a project.  Another important factor of the middleware classes in Table 2-6 is that some are dependent on others.   For example, the AuthenticationMiddleware class is designed on the assumption it will have access to  functionality provided by the SessionMiddleware class. Such dependencies are important because it makes  the middleware class definition order relevant  i.e., certain middleware classes need to be defined before  others in MIDDLEWARE , a topic I’ll elaborate on more in the next section.  In addition to the default middleware classes presented in Table 2-6, Django also offers other   middleware classes. Table 2-7 illustrates the remaining set of Django middleware classes you can leverage in  your projects, which can be helpful so you don’t have to write middleware classes from scratch. 58   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Table 2-7.  Other Django middleware classes and functionality  Middleware class  Functionality  django.middleware.cache. UpdateCacheMiddleware  django.middleware.cache. FetchFromCacheMiddleware  django.middleware.common. BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware django.middleware. ExceptionMiddleware  django.middleware.gzip. GZipMiddleware  django.middleware.http. ConditionalGetMiddleware  django.middleware.locale. LocaleMiddleware  django.contrib.sites.middleware. CurrentSiteMiddleware django.contrib.auth.middleware. PersistentRemoteUserMiddleware django.contrib.auth.middleware. RemoteUserMiddleware  django.contrib. flatpages.middleware. FlatpageFallbackMiddleware  django.contrib. redirects.middleware. RedirectFallbackMiddleware  Response-phase cache middleware that updates the cache if the  response is cacheable. NOTE: UpdateCacheMiddleware must be the  first piece of middleware in MIDDLEWARE so that it’ll get called last  during the response phase. Request-phase cache middleware that fetches a page from the  cache. NOTE: FetchFromCacheMiddleware must be the last piece of  middleware in MIDDLEWARE so that it’ll get called last during the  request phase. Sends broken link notification emails to MANAGERS.  Django uses this middleware regardless of whether or not you  include it in MIDDLEWARE; however, you may want to subclass if  your own middleware needs to transform the exceptions it handles  into the appropriate responses. Compresses content for browsers that understand GZip  compression. NOTE: GZipMiddleware should be placed before any  other middleware that need to read or write the response body so  that compression happens afterward. Compression is only done by  this middleware if the request party sends gzip on the HTTP Accept- Encoding header and if content is larger than 200 bytes and the  response hasn’t set the HTTP Content-Encoding header. Handles conditional GET operations. If the response doesn’t have an  HTTP ETag header, one is added. If the response has an ETag or Last- Modified header, and the request has If-None-Match or If-Modified- Since, the response is replaced by an HttpNotModified. Parses a request and decides what translation object to install in  the current thread context. This allows pages to be dynamically  translated to the language the user desires. Adds the site attribute representing the current site to every  incoming HttpRequest object. Adds REMOTE_USER -- available in request.META -- via an external  source  e.g., web server  for the purpose of Django authentication. Allows web-server-provided authentication. If request.user is  not authenticated, this middleware attempts to authenticate  the username passed in the REMOTE_USER request header. If  authentication is successful, the user is automatically logged in to  persist the user in the session. Each time a Django application raises a 404 error, this middleware  checks the flatpages database for the requested url as a last resort.  Each time a Django application raises a 404 error, this middleware  checks the redirects database for the requested url as a last resort.  59   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Now that you know about Django’s built-in middleware classes and what they’re used for, let’s take a   look at the structure of middleware classes and their execution process.  Middleware Structure and Execution Process A Django middleware class has two required methods and three optional methods that execute at different  points of the view request response life cycle. Listing 2-28 illustrates a sample middleware class with its  various parts.  Listing 2-28.  Django middleware class structure  class CoffeehouseMiddleware object :      def __init__ self, get_response :         self.get_response = get_response          One-time configuration and initialization on start-up      def __call__ self, request :          Logic executed on a request before the view  and other middleware  is called.           get_response call triggers next phase         response = self.get_response request            Logic executed on response after the view is called.           Return response to finish middleware sequence         return response      def process_view self, request, view_func, view_args, view_kwargs :          Logic executed before a call to view          Gives access to the view itself & arguments      def process_exception self,request, exception :          Logic executed if an exception error occurs in the view      def process_template_response self,request, response :          Logic executed after the view is called,          ONLY IF view response is TemplateResponse, see listing 2-22  In order for view methods to execute the Django middleware class in Listing 2-28, middleware classes  must be added to the MIDDLEWARE variable in settings.py. So for example, if the CoffeehouseMiddleware  class in Listing 2-28 is stored in a file module named middleware.py under the coffeehouse utils  project  folders, you would add the coffeehouse.utils.middleware.CoffeeMiddleware statement to the list of  MIDDLEWARE values in settings.py.  Next, I’ll describe the two required methods in all Django middleware class shown in Listing 2-28:   	  __init__.- Used in all Python classes to bootstrap object instances. The __init__  method in Django middleware classes only gets called once, when the web server  backing the Django application starts. The __init__ method in Django middleware  must declare a get_response input, which represents a reference to a prior  middleware class response. The get_response input is assigned to an instance   60   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views   	   	   	   	  variable – also named get_response – which is later used in the main processing  logic of the middleware class. The purpose of the get_response reference should  become clearer shortly when I expand on the Django middleware execution process.  __call__.- Used in all Python classes to call an object instance as a function. The __ call__ method in Django middleware classes is called on every application request.  As you can see in Listing 2-28, the __call__ method declares a request input that  represents the same HttpRequest object used by view methods. The __call__  method goes through three phases:  	  Before view method call.- Once the __call__ method is triggered, you get the  opportunity to alter the request reference before it’s passed to a view method. If  you want to add or modify something in request before it gets turned over to a  view method, this is the phase to do it in.   	   	  Trigger view method call.- After you modify  or not  the original request, you  must turn over control to the view method in order for it to run. This phase is  triggered when you pass request to the self.get_response reference you set  in the __init__ method. This phase effectively says, “I’m done modifying the  request, go ahead and turn it over to the view method so it can run.”  Post view method call.- Once a view method finishes, the results are assigned  to the response reference in __call__. In this phase, you have the opportunity  to perform logic after a view method finishes. You exit this phase by simply  returning the response reference from the view method  i.e., return response .  process_view.- The required middleware methods – __init__ and __call__ – lack  any knowledge about the view method they’re working on. The process_view  method gives you access to a view method and its argument before the view method  is triggered. If present, the process_view middleware method is invoked right after  __call__ and before calling self.get_response request , which triggers the view  method.  process_exception.- If an error occurs in the logic of a view method, the process_ exception middleware method is invoked to give you the opportunity to perform  post-error clean-up logic.  process_template_response.- After the self.get_response request  is called and  a view method finishes, it can be necessary to alter the response itself to perform  additional logic on it  e.g., modify the context or template . If present, the process_ template_response middleware method is invoked after a view method finishes to  give you the opportunity to tinker with the response.  This is the core logic behind every Django middleware class performed by these two required methods.   Now let’s take a look at the three optional middleware class methods presented in Listing 2-28:     Warning  the process_template_response middleware method is only triggered if a view method returns a  templateresponse. if a view method generates a response with render   the process_template_response is not  triggered. see listing 2-22 for view method responses for more details.  61   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  In summary, the execution process for a single middleware class is the following:                       1.   2.   3.   5.   7.   __init__ method triggered  On server startup .  __call__ method triggered  On every request .  If declared, process_view   method triggered.  4.  View method starts with self.get_response request  statement in __call__.  If declared, process_exception   method triggered when exception occurs in  view.  6.  View method finishes.  If declared, process_template_response   triggered when view returns  TemplateResponse.  Although it’s important to understand the execution process of a single middleware class, a more   important aspect is to understand the execution process of multiple middleware classes. As I mentioned at  the outset of this section, Django projects are enabled with seven middleware classes shown in Listing 2-27,  so the execution of multiple middleware classes is more the norm rather than the exception.  Django middleware classes are executed back to back, but the view method represents an inflection point  in their execution order. The execution order for the default middleware classes in Listing 2-27 is the following:  Server start-up  __init__ on django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware called __init__ on django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware called __init__ on django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware called __init__ on django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware called __init__ on django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware called __init__ on django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware called __init__ on django.middleware.clickjacking.XframeOptionsMiddleware called  request for index   view method  __call__ on django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware called process_view on django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware called  if declared  __call__ on django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware called process_view on django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware called  if declared  __call__ on django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware called process_view on django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware called  if declared  __call__ on django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware called process_view on django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware called  if declared  __call__ on django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware called process_view on django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware called  if declared  __call__ on django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware called process_view on django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware called  if declared  __call__ on django.middleware.clickjacking.XframeOptionsMiddleware called process_view on django.middleware.clickjacking.XframeOptionsMiddleware called  if declared   start index   view method logic  if an exception occurs in index   view process_exception on django.middleware.clickjacking.XframeOptionsMiddleware called  if declared  process_exception on django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware called  if declared   62   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  process_exception on django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware called if  declared  process_exception on django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware called  if declared  process_exception on django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware called  if declared  process_exception on django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware called  if declared  process_exception on django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware called  if declared   if index   view returns TemplateResponse process_template_response on django.middleware.clickjacking.XframeOptionsMiddleware called   if declared  process_template_response on django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware called  if  declared  process_template_response on django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware  called if declared  process_template_response on django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware called  if declared  process_template_response on django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware called  if declared  process_template_response on django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware called  if  declared  process_template_response on django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware called  if declared   Notice the execution order for middleware classes prior to entering the execution of the view method,   follows the declared order  i.e., first declared runs first, last declared last . But once the view method is  executed, the middleware execution order is inverted  i.e., last declared runs first, first declared last .  This behavior is similar to a corkscrew, where to get to the center  view method , you move in one   direction  1 to 7  and to move out you go in the opposite direction  7 to 1 . Therefore the middleware  methods process_exception and process_template_response execute in the opposite order of __init__,  __call__ and process_view.  Visually the execution process for the default Django middleware classes in Listing 2-27 is illustrated in   Figure 2-3.  Figure 2-3.  Django middleware execution process  63   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Middleware Flash Messages in View Methods  Flash messages are typically used when users perform an action  e.g., submit a form  and it’s necessary to  tell them if the action was successful or if there was some kind of error. Other times flash messages are used  as one-time notifications on web pages to tell users about certain events  e.g., site maintenance or special  discounts . Figure 2-4 shows a set of sample flash messages.  Figure 2-4.  Web page flash messages  DJANGO FLASH MESSAGES REQUIRE A DJANGO APP,   MIDDLEWARE, AND A TEMPLATE CONTEXT PROCESSOR  By default, all Django projects are enabled to support flash messages. however, if you tweaked your  project’s settings.py file you may have inadvertently disabled flash messages.  in order for Django flash messages to work you must ensure the following values are set in settings.py:  the variable installeD_apps has the django.contrib.messages value, the variable MiDDleware has  the django.contrib.messages.middleware.MessageMiddleware value, and the context_processors list in  options of the teMplates variable has the django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages value.  As you can see in Figure 2-4 there can be different types of flash messages, which are technically known   as levels. Django follows the standard Syslog standard severity levels and supports five built-in message  levels described in Table 2-8.  Table 2-8.  Django built-in flash messages  Level Constant  Tag  Value  Purpose  DEBUG  debug  INFO SUCCESS  info success  WARNING  warning  ERROR  error  10  20 25  30  40  Development-related messages that will be ignored  or  removed  in a production deployment. Informational messages for the user. An action was successful, for example, “Contact info was sent  successfully.” A failure did not occur but may be imminent.  An action was not successful or some other failure occurred.  64   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Add Flash Messages Django flash messages are managed on a per request basis and are added in view methods, as this is the best  place to determine whether flash messages are warranted. To add messages you use the django.contrib. messages package.  There are two techniques to add flash messages with the django.contrib.messages package: one is   the generic add_message   method, and the other is shortcuts methods for the different levels described in  Table 2-8. Listing 2-29 illustrates the different techniques.  Listing 2-29.  Techniques to add Django flash messages  from django.contrib import messages   Generic add_message method messages.add_message request, messages.DEBUG, 'The following SQL statements were executed:  %s' % sqlqueries   Debug messages ignored by default messages.add_message request, messages.INFO, 'All items on this page have free shipping.'  messages.add_message request, messages.SUCCESS, 'Email sent successfully.'  messages.add_message request, messages.WARNING, 'You will need to change your password in  one week.'  messages.add_message request, messages.ERROR, 'We could not process your request at this  time.'    Shortcut level methods messages.debug request, 'The following SQL statements were executed: %s' % sqlqueries    Debug messages ignored by default messages.info request, 'All items on this page have free shipping.'  messages.success request, 'Email sent successfully.'  messages.warning request, 'You will need to change your password in one week.'  messages.error request, 'We could not process your request at this time.'   The first set of samples in Listing 2-29 uses the add_message   method, where as the second set uses   shortcut level methods. Both sets of samples in Listing 2-29 produce the same results.  If you look closely at Listing 2-29 you’ll notice both DEBUG level messages have the end-of-line comment   Ignored by default. The Django messages framework by default processes all messages above the INFO  level  inclusive , which means DEBUG messages – being a lower-level message threshold, as described in  Table 2-8 – are ignored even though they might be defined.  You can change the default Django message level threshold to include all message levels or inclusively  reduce the default INFO threshold. The default message level threshold can be changed in one of two ways:  globally  i.e., for the entire project  in settings.py with the MESSAGE_LEVEL variable as illustrated in   Listing 2-30 or on a per request basis with the set_level method of the django.contrib.messages package  as illustrated in Listing 2-31.  Listing 2-30.  Set default Django message level globally in settings.py   Reduce threshold to DEBUG level in settings.py from django.contrib.messages import constants as message_constants MESSAGE_LEVEL = message_constants.DEBUG   Increase threshold to WARNING level in setting.py from django.contrib.messages import constants as message_constants MESSAGE_LEVEL = message_constants.WARNING  65   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Listing 2-31.  Set default Django message level on a per request basis   Reduce threshold to DEBUG level per request from django.contrib import messages messages.set_level request, messages.DEBUG    Increase threshold to WARNING level per request from django.contrib import messages messages.set_level request, messages.WARNING   The first MESSAGE_LEVEL definition in Listing 2-30 changes the default message level to DEBUG, which   means all message level definitions get processed, since DEBUG is the lowest threshold. The second   MESSAGE_LEVEL definition in Listing 2-30 changes the default message level to WARNING, which means  message levels higher than WARNING  inclusive  are processed  i.e., WARNING and ERROR .  The first set_level definition in Listing 2-31 changes the default request message level to DEBUG, which   means all message level definitions get processed, since DEBUG is the lowest threshold. The second   set_level definition in Listing 2-31 changes the default message level to WARNING, which means message  levels higher than WARNING  inclusive  are processed  i.e., WARNING and ERROR .  If you define both default message level mechanisms at once, the default request message level  takes precedence over the default global message level definition  e.g., if you define messages.set_ level request, messages.WARNING , message levels above WARNING  inclusive  are processed, even if  the global MESSAGE_LEVEL variable is set to MESSAGE_LEVEL = message_constants.DEBUG to include all  messages.  In addition to setting up flash messages and knowing about the built-in threshold mechanism that   ignores messages from a certain level, it’s also important you realize the message definitions in Listing 2-29  assume the Django messages framework prerequisites are declared in settings.py – as described in the  sidebar at the beginning of this section.  Because you can end up distributing a Django project to a third party and have no control over the  final deployment settings.py file, the Django messages framework offers the ability to silently ignore  message definitions in case the necessary prerequisites aren’t declared in settings.py. To silently ignore  message definitions if prerequisites aren’t declared, you can add the fail_silently=True attribute to either  technique that adds messages, as illustrated in Listing 2-32.  Listing 2-32.  Use of the fail_silently=True attribute to ignore errors in case Django messages framework not  installed  from django.contrib import messages   Generic add_message method, with fail_silently=True messages.add_message request, messages.INFO, 'All items on this page have free  shipping.',fail_silently=True    Shortcut level method, with fail_silently=True messages.info request, 'All items on this page have free shipping.',fail_silently=True   Now that you know how to add messages and the important aspects to keep in mind when adding   messages, let’s take a look at how to access messages.  66   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Access Flash Messages The most common place you’ll access Django flash messages is in Django templates to display to end  users. As a shortcut and thanks to the context processor django.contrib.messages.context_processors. messages Django flash messages are available on all templates through the messages variable. But before we  get to an actual template sample, let’s take a quick look at the structure of Django flash messages.  When you add a Django flash message with one of the techniques described in the previous section,   Django creates an instance of the storage.base.Message class. Table 2-9 describes the structure of the  storage.base.Message class.  Attribute  message  level  tags  extra_tags  Table 2-9.  Django storage.base.Message structure  Description  The actual text of the message.  An integer describing the type of the message    see Value column in Table 2-8 . A string combining all the message tags    extra_tags and level_tag  separated by spaces. A string containing custom tags for this message,   separated by spaces.  level_tag  The string representation of the level.  Example  All items on this page have free  shipping. 20  Empty, by default.  info  info  As you can see in Table 2-9, there are several attributes that you can leverage to display in Django   templates. Listing 2-33 shows the boilerplate template code you can use to display all flash messages set in a  request.  Listing 2-33.  Boilerplate code to use in Django template to display Django flash messages  {% if messages %}       {% for msg in messages %}                         {{msg.message}}                     {% endfor %}   {% endif %}  Listing 2-33 starts by checking if the messages variable exists - which contains all flash messages - if it  does, then an HTML list is started with  . Next, a loop is made over all the elements in messages, where  each of these elements corresponds to a storage.base.Message instance. For each of these elements, a  list and section tag -   and   - are created to output the level_tag attribute as a CSS class and the  message attribute as the   content.  You can modify the boilerplate code in Listing 2-33 as you see necessary, for example, to include  conditionals and output certain message levels or leverage some of the other storage.base.Message  attributes, among other things.  67   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views   the htMl code in listing 2-33 uses the Css class class=“alert alert-{{msg.level_tag}}” that gets      Note  rendered into class=“alert alert-info” or class=“alert alert-success”, depending on the level_tag attribute.these  Css classes are part of the Css bootstrap framework. in this manner, you can quickly format flash messages to  look like those presented in Figure 2-2.  Although you’ll commonly access Django flash messages in Django templates, this doesn’t mean you   can’t access them elsewhere, such as view methods. You can also gain access to Django flash messages  in a request through the get_messages   method of the django.contrib.messages package. Listing 2-34  illustrates a code snippet with the use of the get_messages   method.  Listing 2-34.  Use of get_messages   method to access Django flash messages  from django.contrib import messages  the_req_messages = messages.get_messages request  for msg in the_req_messages:     do_something_with_the_flash_message msg   In Listing 2-34 the get_messages   method receives the request as input and assigns the result to the_ req_messages variable. Next, a loop is made over all the elements in the_req_messages, where each of these  elements corresponds to a storage.base.Message instance. For each of these elements, a call is made to the  method do_something_with_the_flash_message to do something with each flash message.  An important aspect to understand when accessing Django flash messages is the duration of the   messages themselves. Django flash messages are marked to be cleared when an iteration occurs on the main  messages instance and cleared when the response is processed.  For access in Django templates, this means that if you fail to make an iteration in a Django template   like the one in Listing 2-33 and flash messages are in the request, it can lead to stale or phantom messages  appearing elsewhere until an iteration is made and a response is processed. For access in Django view  methods  i.e., using get_messages   , this has no impact because even though you may make an iteration  over the main messages instance - therefore, marking messages to be cleared - a response is not processed  in a Django view method, so messages are never cleared, just marked to be cleared.  Class-Based Views  In Chapter 1 and at the start of this chapter – in Listing 2-1 – you saw how to define a Django url and make  it operate with a Django template without the need of a view method. This was possible due to the django. views.generic.TemplateView class, which is called a class-based view.  Unlike Django view methods backed by standard Python methods that use a Django HttpRequest  input parameter and output a Django HttpResponse, class-based views offer their functionality through  full-fledged Python classes. This, in turn, allows Django views to operate with object-oriented programming   OOP  principles  e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance  leading to greater reusability and  shorter implementation times.  Although Django class-based views represent a more powerful approach to create Django views,  they are simply an alternative to the view methods you’ve used up to this point. If you want to quickly  execute business logic on Django requests you can keep using view methods, but for more demanding  view requirements  e.g., form processing, boilerplate model queries  class-based views can save you  considerable time.  68   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  Built-In Class-Based Views The functionality provided by the django.views.generic.TemplateView class-based view is really a time  saver. While it would have been possible to configure a url to execute on an empty view method and then  send control to a template, the TemplateView class allows this process to be done in one line.  In addition to the TemplateView class-based view, Django offers many other built-in class-based views  to shorten the creation process for common Django view operations using OOP-like principles. Table 2-10  illustrates Django’s built-in classes for views.  Table 2-10.

Allows a url to return the contents of a template, without  the need of a view. Allows a url to perform a redirect, without the need of a  view. Allows a view to return date-based object results, without  the need to explicitly perform Django model queries.  Allows a view to execute Create-Read-Update-Delete   CRUD  operations , without the need to explicitly perform  Django model queries.  In the upcoming and final section of this chapter, I’ll explain the classes in the top half of Table 2-10 so   you can gain a better understanding of the structure and execution process of Django class-based views. The  class-based views in the bottom half of Table 2-10 that involve Django models are described in a separate  chapter on Django models.  Class-Based View Structure and Execution To create a class-based view you need to create a class that inherits from one of the classes in Table 2-10.  Listing 2-35 shows a class-based view with this inheritance technique, as well as the corresponding url  definition to execute a class-based view.  Listing 2-35.  Class-based view inherited from TemplateView with url definition   views.py from django.views.generic import TemplateView  class AboutIndex TemplateView :       template_name = 'index.html'  69   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views        def get_context_data self, **kwargs :           **kwargs contains keyword context initialization values  if any            Call base implementation to get a context          context = super AboutIndex, self .get_context_data **kwargs            Add context data to pass to template          context['aboutdata'] = 'Custom data'          return context  urls.py from coffeehouse.about.views import AboutIndex  urlpatterns = [     url r'^about index ',AboutIndex.as_view  ,{'onsale':True} , ]  I chose to create a view that inherits from TemplateView first because of its simplicity and because you   already know the purpose of this class. The example in Listing 2-35 and the first example in this chapter from  Listing 2-1 produce nearly identical outcomes.  The difference is, Listing 2-1 declares a TemplateView class instance directly as part of the url  e.g.,   TemplateView.as_view template_name='index.html'    , where as Listing 2-35 declares an instance of a  TemplateView subclass named AboutIndex. Comparing the two approaches, you can get the initial feel for  the OOP behavior of class-based views.  The first part in Listing 2-35 declares the AboutIndex class-based view, which inherits its behavior from  the TemplateView class. Notice the class declares the template_name attribute and the get_context_data    method.  The template_name value in the AboutIndex class acts as a default template for the class-based view.   But in OOP fashion, this same value can be overridden by providing a value at instance creation  e.g.,  AboutIndex.as_view template_name='other.html'  to use the other.html template .  The get_context_data method in the AboutIndex class allows you to add context data to the class-  view template. Notice the signature of the get_context_data method uses **kwargs to gain access to  context initialization values  e.g., declared in the url or parent class-views  and invokes a parent’s class  get_context_data method using the Python super   method per standard OOP Python practice. Next,  the get_context_data method adds the additional context data with the aboutdata key and returns the  modified context reference.  In the second part of Listing 2-35, you can see how the AboutIndex class-based view is first imported   into a urls.py file and then hooked up to a url definition. Notice how the class-based view is declared on the  url definition using the as_view   method. In addition, notice how the url definition declares the url extra  option {'onsale':True} that gets passed as context data to the class-based view  i.e., in the **kwargs of the  get_context_data method .     Tip    all class-based views use the as_view   method to integrate into url definitions.  Now that you have a basic understanding of Django class-based views, Listing 2-36 shows another   class-based view with different implementation details.  Listing 2-36.  Class-based view inherited from View with multiple HTTP handling   views.py from django.views.generic import View from django.http import HttpResponse from django.shortcuts import render  70   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  class ContactPage View :     mytemplate = 'contact.html'     unsupported = 'Unsupported operation'      def get self, request :         return render request, self.mytemplate       def post self, request :         return HttpResponse self.unsupported   urls.py from coffeehouse.contact.views import ContactPage  urlpatterns = [     url r'^contact $',ContactPage.as_view   , ]  The first difference in Listing 2-36 is the class-based view inherits its behavior from the general purpose  django.views.generic.View class. As outlined in Table 2-10, the View class provides the core functionality  for all class-based views. So in fact, the TemplateView class used in Listing 2-35 is a subclass of View,  meaning class-based views that use TemplateView have access to the same functionalities of class-based  views that use View.  The reason you would chose one class over another to implement class-based views is rooted in OOP   polymorphism principles. For example, in OOP you can have a class hierarchy Drink→ Coffee → Latte,  where a Drink class offers generic functionalities available to Drink, Coffee, and Latte instances; a Coffee  class offers more specific functionalities applicable to Coffee and Latter instances; and a Latte class offers the  most specific functionalities applicable to only Latte instances.  Therefore if you know beforehand you need a class-based view to relinquish control to a template   without applying elaborate business logic or custom request and response handling, the TemplateView class  offers the quickest path to a solution vs. the more generic View class. Expanding on this same principle, once  you start working with Django models and views, you’ll come to realize some of the more specialized class- based views in Table 2-10 also offer quicker solutions than creating a class-based view that inherits from the  general purpose View class. Now that you know the reason why you would chose a View class-based view  over a more specialized class, let’s break down the functionality in Listing 2-36.  Notice the class-based view ContactPage declares two attributes: mytemplate and unsupported. These  are generic class attributes and I used the mytemplate name to illustrate there’s no relation to the template_ name attribute used in Listing 2-35 and TemplateView class-based views. Class-based views derived from a  TemplateView expect a template_name value and automatically use this template to generate a response.  However, class-based views derived from a View class don’t expect a specific template, but instead expect  you to implement how to generate a response, which is where the get and post methods in Listing 2-36  come into play.  The get method is used to handle HTTP GET requests on the view, while the post method is used to   HTTP POST requests on the view. This offers a much more modular approach to handle different HTTP  operations vs. standard view methods that require explicitly inspecting a request and creating conditionals  to handle different HTTP operations. For the moment, don’t worry about HTTP GET and HTTP POST view  handling; this is explored in greater detail in Django forms where the topic is of greater relevance.  Next, notice both the get and post methods declare a request input, which represents a Django   HttpRequest instance just like standard view methods. In both cases, the methods immediately return  a response, but it’s possible to inspect a request value or execute any business logic before generating a  response, just like it can be done in standard view methods.  71   Chapter 2   Django Urls anD Views  The get method generates a response with the django.shortcuts.render method and the post   method generates a response with the HttpResponse class, both of which are the same techniques used to  generate responses in standard view methods . The only minor difference in Listing 2-36 is both the render  method and HttpResponse class use instance attributes  e.g., self.mytemplate, self.unsupported  to  generate the response, but other than this, you’re free to return a Django HttpResponse with any of the  variations already explained in this chapter  e.g., Listing 2-22 response alternatives, Table 2-5 shortcut  responses .  Finally, the last part in Listing 2-36 shows how the ContactPage class-based view is imported into a   urls.py file and later hooked up to a url using the as_view   method.  To close out the discussion on class-based views and this chapter, we come to the django.views. generic.RedirectView class. Similar to the TemplateView class-based view that allows you to quickly  generate a response without a view method, the RedirectView class-based view allows you to quickly  generate an HTTP redirect – like the ones described in Table 2-4 – without the need of a view method.  The RedirectView class supports four attributes described in the following list:   	   	  	   	  permanent.- Defaults to False to perform a non-permanent redirect supported by  the HttpResponseRedirect class described in Table 2-4. If set to True, a permanent  redirect is made with the HttpResponsePermanentRedirect class described in  Table 2-4.  url.- Defaults to None. Defines a url value to perform the redirect.  pattern_name.- Defaults to None. Defines a url name to generate a redirect url via  the reverse method. Note the reverse method is explained in the url naming and  namespace section earlier in this chapter.  query_string.- Defaults to False to append a query string to a redirect url. If  provided, the query_string value to the redirect url.  And with this we conclude our exploration into Django views and urls. In the next two chapters, you’ll   learn about Django templates and Jinja templates.  72   CHAPTER 3  Django Templates  Django templates define the layout and final formatting sent to end users after a view method is finished  processing a request. In this chapter, you’ll learn the syntax used by Django templates, the configuration  options available for Django templates, as well as the various Django template constructs  e.g., filters, tags,  context processors  that allow you to create elaborate layouts and apply formatting to the content presented  to end users.  Django Template Syntax  Although there are over 100 built-in constructs that help you build Django templates – all of which you’ll  learn as this chapter progresses – to start out, these are the most important syntax elements you need to  recognize:  	  {{output_variable}}.- Values surrounded by double curly braces at the start and  end represent output for variables. Variables are passed by Django views, url options,  or context processors into templates. In a template, you can use {{}} to output the  contents of a variable, as well as use Python’s dot notation to output deeper elements  of a variable  e.g., fields, keys, methods . For example, {{store.name}} tells a Django  template to output the store variable’s name, where store can be an object and name  a field or store can be a dictionary and name a key.   	   	  {% tag %}.- Values surrounded by curly braces wrapped with percentage signs are  called tags. Django tags offer complex formatting logic wrapped in a simple syntax  representation.  variablefilter .- Values declared after a vertical bar  are called filters. Django  filters offer a way to apply formatting logic to individual variables.  Any other syntax in Django templates besides these three variations is treated 'as is'. This means that if  a template declares the Hypertext Markup Language HTML  heading  Welcome! , a user will get a  large HTML heading. It’s that simple.  But let’s take a look at one not so obvious Django template syntax behavior that’s important you  understand right away, since it’s a recurring theme in practically everything associated with Django  templates.    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_3  73   Chapter 3   Django templates  Auto-Escaping: HTML and Erring on the Safe Side Django projects operate on the Web, so by default all templates are assumed to produce HTML. While this is  a reasonable assumption, it isn’t, until you face one of two things:   	   	  You can’t ensure Django templates produce valid HTML and in fact may produce  dangerous markup.  You want Django templates to produce non-HTML content, such as Comma  Separated Values  CSV , eXtensible Markup Language  XML , or JavaScript Object  Notation  JSON .  So how could you possibly introduce invalid HTML or even dangerous content into Django templates?  Well it’s the Internet, its content from other users or providers that can end up in your Django templates that  can cause problems  e.g., data submitted by users, third-party services, content from databases .  The issue isn’t content you place directly in Django templates – that’s given to be valid since you type   it in – the issue is dynamic content placed through variables, tags, filters, and context processors, which has  the potential to come from anywhere. Let’s analyze this further with the following variables:  store_legend = " Open since 1965! " js_user_date = " var user_date = new Date   "  If variables with this content make it to Django templates and you attempt to output them, they are  output verbatim. The store_legend won’t be output as an HTML bold statement, but rather a statement  surrounded by   and  . Similarly, the js_user_date won’t produce a JavaScript variable with a user  browser local date, but rather output the   statement literally.  This happens because by default Django auto-escapes content present in dynamic constructs     i.e., variables, tags, filters, and context processors . Table 3-1 illustrates the characters Django auto-escapes  by default.  Table 3-1.  Characters Django auto-escapes by default  Original character  Escaped to  < > ' single quote  "  double quote   &  &lt; &gt; &39; &quot;  &amp;  As you can see in Table 3-1, Django auto-escaping consists of converting potentially conflicting and  even dangerous characters – in the context of HTML – to equivalent visual representations also known as  escape characters.1  This is done because malicious users or unchecked sources can easily produce content with the   characters on the left column of Table 3-1, which can mangle a user interface or execute malicious JavaScript  code. So Django errs on the safe side and auto-escapes the characters in Table 3-1 to equivalent visual  representations. While you can certainly disable the auto-escaping of characters from Table 3-1, this has to  be done explicitly, since it represents a security risk.  1https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Escape_character  74   Chapter 3   Django templates  While auto-escaping is a good security precaution for HTML output, this takes us to the second point  in assuming Django always produces HTML. What happens if a Django template has to output CSV, JSON,  or XML content, where characters like  , ' single quote , " double quote , and &, have special meaning  to content consumers and can’t use equivalent visual representations? In such cases, you’ll also to need to  explicitly disable the default auto-escaping behavior enforced by Django.  So whether you want to output actual HTML through variables in Django templates or output CSV,   JSON, or XML without Django applying an HTML security practice to this content, you’ll need to deal with  Django auto-escaping.  There are various ways to control auto-escaping in Django templates  e.g., globally, individual variables,   individual filters , which you’ll learn as you progress through this chapter. But auto-escaping is a constant  theme in Django templates, along with these related terms:   	   	   	  Safe.- If a Django template construct is marked as safe, it means no characters from  Table 3-1 are escaped. In other words, safe equals "I know what I'm doing" output the  content 'as is'.  Escape.- If a Django template construct is marked to be escaped, it means characters  from Table 3-1 are escaped. In other words, escape equals "Ensure no potentially  dangerous HTML characters are output, use equivalent visual representations."  Auto-escape on  Auto-escape off  safe .- If a Django template uses auto-escape on,  it means Django template constructs in this scope should escape characters from  Table 3-1. If a Django template uses auto-escape off, it means Django template  constructs in this scope should be output 'as is' and not escape characters from  Table 3-1.  And with this we finish the conversation on this rather dry, yet important topic of Django auto-escaping.   Next, let’s explore the various configuration options for Django templates.  Django Template Configuration  By default, Django templates are enabled on all Django projects due to the TEMPLATES variable in settings. py. Listing 3-1 illustrates the default TEMPLATES value in Django projects.  Listing 3-1.  Default Django template configuration in settings.py  TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': [],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ]  75   Chapter 3   Django templates  The BACKEND variable indicates the project uses Django templates. The DIRS and APP_DIRS variables tell   Django where to locate Django templates and are explained in the next section. The context_processors  field inside OPTIONS tells Django which context processors to enable for a Django project. In short, a context  processor offers the ability to share data across all Django templates, without the need to define it in a  piecemeal fashion in Django views.  Later sections in this chapter describe what data is provided by default Django context processors and   how to write your own context processors to share custom data on all Django templates.  Template Search Paths Django determines where to look for templates based on the values in the DIRS and APP_DIRS variables. As  you can see in Listing 3-1, Django defaults to an empty DIRS value and sets the APP_DIRS variable to True. The APP_DIRS variable set to True tells Django to look for templates in Django app subfolders named   templates - if you've never heard of the Django app concept, look over Chapter 1, which describes this  concept.  The APP_DIRS behavior is helpful to contain an app's templates to an app's structure, but be aware the  template search path is not aware of an app's namespace. For example, if you have two apps that both rely  on a template named index.html and both app's have a method in views.py that returns control to the  index.html template e.g., render request,'index.html'  , both apps will use the index.html from the  top-most declared app in INSTALLED_APPS, so only one app will use the expected index.html.  The first set of folders illustrated in Listing 3-2 shows two Django apps with this type of potential   template layout conflict.  Listing 3-2.

In this manner, you can redirect control to a template using this additional namespace subfolder   to avoid any ambiguity. So to send control to the about index.html template you would declare  render request,'about index.html'  and to send control to the stores index.html you would declare  render request,'stores index.html' .  If you wish to disallow this behavior of allowing templates to be loaded from these internal app   subfolders, you can do so by setting APP_DIRS to FALSE.  A more common approach to define Django templates is to have a single folder or various folders that   live outside app structures to hold Django templates. In order for Django to find such templates, you use the  DIRS variable as illustrated in Listing 3-3.  Listing 3-3.  DIRS definition with relative path in settings.py  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,                  '%s dev_templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {  77   Chapter 3   Django templates              'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ]  As you can see in Listing 3-3, you can declare various directories inside the DIRS variable. Django looks   for templates inside DIRS values and then in templates folder in apps – if APP_DIRS is TRUE – until it either  finds a matching template or throws a TemplateDoesNotExist error.  Also note the DIRS values in Listing 3-3 rely on a path determined dynamically by the PROJECT_DIR  variable. This approach is helpful when you deploy a Django project across different machines, because  the path is relative to the top-level Django project directory  i.e., where the settings.py and main urls.py  file are  and adjusts dynamically irrespective of where a Django project is installed  e.g.,  var www ,  opt  website , C:  website  .  Invalid Template Variables By default, Django templates do not throw an error when they contain invalid variables. This is due to design  choices associated with the Django admin that also uses Django templates.  While this is not a major issue in most cases, it can be frustrating for debugging tasks as Django   doesn't inform you of misspelled or undefined variables. For example, you could type {{datee}} instead of  {{date}} and Django ignores this by outputting an empty string '', you could also forget to pass a variable  value to a template in the view method and Django also silently outputs an empty string '' even though you  may have it defined in the template.  To enable Django to inform you when it encounters an invalid variable in Django templates, you can use   the string_if_invalid option. The first configuration option for string_if_invalid shown in Listing 3-4  outputs a visible string instead of an empty string ''.  Listing 3-4.  Output warning message for invalid template variables with string_if_invalid  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,'%s dev_templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'string_if_invalid': "**** WARNING INVALID VARIABLE %s ****",             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ] 78   Chapter 3   Django templates  As you can see in Listing 3-4, string_if_invalid is assigned the string "**** WARNING INVALID  VARIABLE %s ****". When Django encounters an invalid variable, it replaces the occurrence with this  string, where the %s variable gets substituted with the invalid variable name, allowing you to easily locate  where and what variables are invalid.  Another configuration option for the string_if_invalid option is to perform more complex logic   when an invalid variable is encountered. For example, Listing 3-5 illustrates how you can raise an error so  the template fails to render in case an invalid variable is found.  Listing 3-5.  Error generation for invalid template variables with string_if_invalid  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    class InvalidTemplateVariable str :     def __mod__ self,other :         from django.template.base import TemplateSyntaxError         raise TemplateSyntaxError "Invalid variable : '%s'" % other   TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,'%s dev_templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'string_if_invalid': InvalidTemplateVariable "%s" ,             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ]  In Listing 3-5 string_if_invalid is assigned the InvalidTemplateVariable class that uses the %s input   variable, which represents the invalid variable name - just like the previous example in Listing 3-4.  The InvalidTemplateVariable class is interesting because it inherits its behavior from the   str string  class and uses a Python __mod__  modulo  magic method implementation. While the  __mod__  modulo  magic method is proper of number operations, in this case, it's useful because  the passed in string uses the %  modulo  symbol, which makes the __mod__ method run. Inside the  __mod__ method we just raise the TemplateSyntaxError error with the invalid variable name to halt the  execution of the template.  79   Chapter 3   Django templates     Caution    the Django admin might get mangled or broken with a custom string_if_invalid value.  the Django admin templates in particular rely heavily on the default string_if_invalid outputting empty  strings '', due to the level of complexity in certain displays. In fact, this string_if_invalid default behavior is  often considered a “feature,” as much as it's considered a “bug” or “annoyance.”  therefore if you use one of the approaches in listing 3-4 or listing 3-5 to override string_if_invalid, be  aware you will most likely mangle or brake Django admin pages. If you rely on the Django admin, you should  only use these techniques to debug a project's templates.  Debug Output When you run a Django project with the top-level DEBUG=True setting and an error occurs, Django templates  output a very detailed page to make the debugging process easier – see Chapter 5 for more details on the  DEBUG variable, specifically the section “Django settings.py for the Real World.”  By default, Django templates reuse the top-level DEBUG variable value to configure template debug   activity. Behind the scenes, this configuration is set through the debug field inside OPTIONS of the TEMPLATES  variable. Figure 3-1 illustrates what an error page looks when DEBUG=True.  Figure 3-1.  Django error page when DEBUG=True automatically sets template OPTION to ‘debug’:True  As you can see in Figure 3-1, Django prints the location of the template, as well as a snippet of the   template itself to make it easier to locate an error. This template information is generated due to the  'debug':True option, which is set based on the top-level DEBUG variable. However, you can explicitly set the  debug option to False as illustrated in Listing 3-6, in which case the error page would result without any  template details and just the traceback information, as illustrated in Figure 3-2.  80   Chapter 3   Django templates  Listing 3-6.  Option with debug equals False omits template details  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,'%s dev_templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'debug':False,             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ]  Figure 3-2.  Django error page when DEBUG=True and explicit OPTION ‘debug’:False  Auto-Escape By default, Django templates use the security practice to auto-escape certain characters – described in  Table 3-1 – contained in dynamically generated constructs  e.g., variables, tags, filters . Auto-escaping  converts characters that can potentially mangle a user interface or produce dangerous outcomes into safe  representations, a process that was described in the first section of this chapter.  81   Chapter 3   Django templates  However, you can globally disable auto-escaping on all Django templates -- and knowingly render < as     as >, etc... -- with the autoescape field in OPTIONS as shown in Listing 3-7.  Listing 3-7.  Option with auto-escape equals False omits auto-escaping on all Django templates  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,'%s dev_templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'autoescape':False,             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ]  It's worth mentioning that an alternative to disabling auto-escaping on every Django template - as it's  done in Listing 3-7 - is to selectively disable auto-escaping. You can either use the {% autoescape off %}  tag to disable auto-escaping on a section of a Django template or the safe filter to disable auto-escaping on  a single Django template variable.  If you do decide to disable auto-escaping on all Django templates as illustrated in Listing 3-7 - which   I frankly wouldn't recommend if you plan to use just HTML, because of the potential security risk-- you  can also granularly enable auto-escaping again if required. You can either use the {% autoescape on %}  tag to enable auto-escaping on a section of a Django template or the escape filter to escape a single Django  template variable.  File charset Files used in Python projects often declare an encoding value at the top  e.g.,  -*- coding: utf-8 -*-   based on the Python PEP-263 specification,2 which ensures the characters in the file are interpreted correctly.  In Django templates, you don't define the underlying file's encoding in this manner, but instead do it inside a  project's settings.py file.  There are two ways to declare the encoding character for Django templates: explicitly as part of the   file_charset field in OPTIONS inside the TEMPLATES variable or via the top-level FILE_CHARSET variable in  settings.py. The explicit declaration in file_charset within OPTIONS takes precedence over the FILE_ CHARSET assignment, but the value of file_charset defaults to FILE_CHARSET, which, in itself defaults to  utf-8  Unicode  encoding.  2https:  www.python.org dev peps pep-0263   82   Chapter 3   Django templates  So by default, Django template encoding is assigned to utf-8 or Unicode, which is one of the most   widely used encodings in software. Nevertheless, in the event you decide to incorporate data into Django  templates that isn't utf-8 compatible  e.g., Spanish vowels with accents like á or é encoded as ISO-8859- 1 or Kanji characters like 漢 or 字 encoded as JIS  you must define the FILE_CHARSET value in a project's  settings.py file - or directly in the file_charset field in OPTIONS inside the TEMPLATES - so Django template  data is interpreted correctly.  Django templates can be assigned any encoding value from Python's standard encoding values.3  Automatic Access to Custom Template tag filter Modules Django templates have access to a series of built-in tags and filters that don't require any setup steps.  However, if you plan to use a third-party template tag filter module or write your own template tag filter  module, then you need to set up access on each Django template with the {% load %} tag  e.g., {% load  really_useful_tags_and_filters %} , a process that can get tiresome if you need to access a particular  tag filter on dozens or hundreds of templates.  To automatically gain access to third-party template tags filters or your own template tags filters as if  they were built-in tags filters  i.e., without requiring the {% load %} tag , you can use the builtins field in  OPTIONS as illustrated in Listing 3-8.  Listing 3-8.  Option with builtins to gain automatic access to tags filters on all templates  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,'%s dev_templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],             'builtins': [                  'coffeehouse.builtins',                  'thirdpartyapp.customtags.really_useful_tags_and_filters',             ],         },     }, ]  As you can see in Listing 3-8, the builtins field accepts a list of modules that includes tags filters for  built-in treatment. In this case, coffeehouse.builtins represents a builtins.py file - which includes the  custom tags filters - under a project named coffeehouse. And the thirdpartyapp.customtags.really_ useful_tags_and_filters is a third-party package with tags filters that we also want to access in Django  templates without the need to use the {% load %} tag.  3https:  docs.python.org 3 library codecs.htmlstandard-encodings  83   Chapter 3   Django templates  Another default behavior of third-party template tag filter modules and custom template tag filter   modules is they are required to use their original label name for reference, while the latter also requires it to  be placed inside a folder named templatetags in a registered Django app. These two default behaviors can  be overridden with the libraries field in OPTIONS as illustrated in Listing 3-9.  Listing 3-9.  Option with libraries to register tags filters with alternative label name and under any project  directory  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': ['%s templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,'%s dev_templates ' %  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],             'libraries': {                  'coffeehouse_tags': 'coffeehouse.tags_filters.common',             },         },     }, ]  The libraries statement in Listing 3-9 'coffeehouse_tags': 'coffeehouse.tags_filters.common'   tells Django to load the common.py file - that includes the custom tags filters - from the tags_filters folder  in the coffeehouse project and make it accessible to templates through the coffeehouse_tags reference   e.g., {% load coffeehouse_tags %} . With the approach in Listing 3-9, you can place custom tag filter  modules anywhere in a Django project, as well as assign custom tag filter modules - or third-party tag filter  modules - an alternative reference value instead of their original label name.  Template Loaders Earlier in the section “Template Search Paths,” I described how Django searches for templates using the  DIRS and APP_DIRS variables, which are part of Django’s template configuration. However, I intentionally  omitted a deeper aspect associated with this template search process: each search mechanism is backed by  a template loader.  A template loader is a Python class that implements the actual logic required to search and load   templates. Table 3-2 illustrates the built-in template loaders available in Django.  84   Table 3-2.  Built-in Django template loaders  Template loader class  Description  django.template.loaders.filesystem.Loader  django.template.loaders.app_directories.Loader  django.template.loaders.cached.Loader  django.template.loaders.locmem.Loader  Chapter 3   Django templates  Searches and loads templates in directories declared  in the DIRS variable. Enabled by default when DIRS  is not empty. Searches and loads templates from subdirectories  named templates in all apps declared in  INSTALLED_APPS. Enabled by default when APP_ DIRS is True. Searches for templates from an in-memory cache,  after loading templates from a file-system or app  directory loader.  Searches for templates from an in-memory cache,  after loading templates from a Python dictionary.  As you can see, two of the Django template loaders in Table 3-2 are automatically set up by the presence  of either the DIRS or APP_DIRS variables. Nevertheless, any of the template loaders in Table 3-2 can be set up  explicitly using the loaders field in OPTIONS inside TEMPLATES.  Create Reusable Templates  Templates tend to have common sections that are equally used across multiple instances. For example,  the header and footer sections on all templates rarely change, whether a project has 5 or 100 templates.  Other template sections like menus and advertisements also fall into this category of content that’s constant  across multiple templates. All of this can lead to repetition over multiple templates, which can be avoided by  creating reusable templates.  With reusable Django templates you can define common sections on separate templates and reuse   them inside other templates. This process makes it easy to create and manage a project's templates because  a single template update takes effect on all templates.  Reusable Django templates also allow you to define page blocks to override content on a page-by-  page basis. This process makes a project's templates more modular because you define top-level blocks to  establish the overall layout and define content on a page-by-page basis.  Lets take the first step toward building reusable Django templates exploring the Django built-in    {% block %} tag. Listing 3-10 illustrates the first lines of a template called base.html with several   {% block %} tags.  Listing 3-10.  Django template with {% block %} tags                     {% block title%}Default title{% endblock title %}               85   Chapter 3   Django templates  Notice the syntax {% block  %}{% endblock   %} in Listing 3-10. Each {% block %} tag   has a reference name. The reference name is used by other Django templates to override the content for  each block.  For example, the {% block title %} tag within the HTML   tags defines a web page title. If   another template reuses the template in Listing 3-10, it can define its own web page title by overriding the  title block. If a block is not overridden on a template, the block receives the default content within the block.  For the title block the default content is Default title, for the metadescription and metakeywords  blocks the default content is an empty string.  The same mechanism illustrated in Listing 3-10 can be used to define any number of blocks  e.g.,   content, menu, header, footer . It’s worth mentioning the   argument of {% endblock   %} is  optional and it’s valid to just use {% endblock %} to close a block statement; however, the former technique  makes it clearer where a block statement ends, which is especially helpful when a template has multiple  blocks.  Although it’s possible to call the template in Listing 3-10 directly by a Django view method or url   request, the purpose of this kind of template is to use it as a base template for other templates. To reuse a  Django template you use the Django built-in {% extends %} tag.  The {% extends %} tag uses the syntax {% extends   %} to reuse the layout of another template.   This means that in order to reuse the layout in Listing 3-10 defined in a file base.html, you use the syntax  {% extends "base.html" %}. In addition, if you use the {% extends %} tag it has to be the first definition in  Django template, as illustrated in Listing 3-11.  Listing 3-11.  Django template with {% extends %} and {% block %} tag  {% extends "base.html" %} {% block title %}Coffeehouse home page{% endblock title %}   In an {% extend   %} tag statement, the   value can also use a relative path  e.g., "..      Tip  base.html" , as well as a variable passed by a view that can be a string  e.g., "master.html"  or template object  loaded in the view.  Notice in Listing 3-11 how the first template statement is {% extends "base.html" %}. In addition,   notice how Listing 3-11 defines the {% block title %} tag with the content Coffeehouse home page. The  block in Listing 3-11 overrides the title block from the base.html template. So where are the HTML    tags in Listing 3-11? There aren't any and you don't need them. Django automatically reuses the layout from  the base.html template and substitutes the blocks content where necessary.  Django templates that reuse other templates tend to have limited layout elements  e.g., HTML tags  and  more Django block statements to override content. This is beneficial because as I outlined previously, it lets  you establish the overall layout once and define content on a page-by-page basis.  The reusability of Django templates can occur multiple times. For example, you can have templates A,   B, and C, where B requires to reuse A, but C requires to reuse parts of B. The only difference is template C  needs to use the {% extends "B" %} tag instead of the {% extends "A"%} tag. But since template B reuses A,  template C also has access to the same elements in template A.  When reusing Django templates, it's also possible to access the block content from a parent template.  Django exposes the block content from a parent template through the reference block.super. Listing 3-12  illustrates three templates that show this mechanism for a block containing web page paths or “breadcrumbs.”  86   Chapter 3   Django templates  Listing 3-12.  Django templates use of {{block.super}} with three reusable templates   base.html template  {% block breadcrumb %}Home{% endblock breadcrumb %}    index.html template {% extends "base.html" %} {% block breadcrumb %}Main{% endblock breadcrumb %}   detail.html template {% extends "index.html" %} {% block breadcrumb %} {{block.super}} : Detail {% endblock breadcrumb %}  The base.html template in Listing 3-12 defines the breadcrumb block with a default value of Home. Next,  the index.html template reuses the base.html template and overrides the breadcrumb block with a value of  Main. Finally, the detail.html template reuses the index.html template and overrides the breadcrumb block  value. However, notice the {{block.super}} statement in the final block override. Since {{block.super}}  is inside the breadcrumb block, {{block.super}} tells Django to get the content from the parent template  block.  Another reusability functionality in Django templates is the inclusion of a Django template inside   another Django template. Django supports this functionality through the {% include %} tag.  The {% include %} tag expects a template argument – similar to the {% extend %} tag – which can be   either a hard-coded string reference  e.g., {% include "footer.html" %}  , a relative path to a template   e.g., {% include ".. header.html" %} , or a variable passed by a view that can be a string or Template  object loaded in the view.  Templates declared as part of {% include %} tags are made aware of context variables in the template   that declares them. This means if template A uses the {% include "footer.html" %} tag, template A  variables are automatically made available to the footer.html template.  Inclusively, it's possible to explicitly provide context variables to {% include %} statements using the  with keyword. For example, the statement {% include "footer.html" with year="2013" %} makes the  year variable accessible inside the footer.html template. The {% include %} tag also supports the ability  to pass multiple variables using the with notation  e.g., {% include "footer.html" with year="2013"  copyright="Creative Commons" %} .  Finally, if you want templates declared as part of {% include %} tags to have restricted access to context   variables from the template that declares them, you can use the only keyword. For example, if template B  uses the {% include "footer.html" with year="2013" only %} statement, the footer.html template  only gets access to the year variable, irrespective of the variables available in template B. Similarly, the {%  include "footer.html" only %} statement restricts the footer.html template to no variables, irrespective  of the variables available in the template that uses the statement.  Built-In Context Processors  By default, Django templates are enabled to have access to various variables. This eliminates the need to  constantly declare widely used variables in every single Django view methods or as url extra options. These  variables are made available through template context processors.  Django template context processors are explicitly defined in a project's settings.py file, in the   TEMPLATES variable inside the OPTIONS key. By default and as illustrated in Listing 3-1, Django projects are  enabled with four context processors built in to Django. Next, I'll describe the data variables made available  by each of these context processors.  87   Chapter 3   Django templates  Django debug context processor    django.template.context_processors.debug  The Django debug context processor exposes variables that are helpful for debugging. This context processor  makes the following variables available on all Django templates:  debug.- Contains True or False, based on the DEBUG variable in the settings.py file.  sql_queries.- Contains the database connection details  e.g., SQL statements  run  by the backing method view.   the Django debug context processor displays variable values only if the requesting Ip address is      Note  defined in the Internal_Ips variable in settings.py. even if the variables are declared in a template  e.g.,  {{debug}} or {{sql_queries}}  this restriction permits that only certain users view the debug messages in the  template, while other users won't view anything.  For example, to view the debug and sql_queries values on your local workstation, add Internal_Ips =  ['127.0.0.1'] to the settings.py file. this tells Django to display these variables values for requests made from  the Ip address 127.0.0.1.  Django request context processor    django.template.context_processors.request  The Django request context processor exposes variables related to a request  i.e., HTTP request . This  context processor makes data available through a massive dictionary named request, which includes some  of the following key-values:  request.GET.- Contains a request's HTTP GET parameters.  request.POST.- Contains a request's HTTP POST parameters.  request.COOKIES.- Contains a request's HTTP COOKIES.  request.CONTENT_TYPE.- Contains a request's HTTP Content-type header.  request.META.- Contains a request's HTTP META data.  request.REMOTE_ADDR.- Contains a request's HTTP remote address.  Django auth context processor    django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth  The Django auth context processor exposes variables related to authentication logic. This context processor  makes the following variables accessible in Django templates:  user.- Contains user data  e.g., id, name, email, anonymous user .  perms.- Contains user app permissions  e.g., True, False or explicit app permissions  a user has access to in a django.contrib.auth.context_processors.PermWrapper  object .  88   	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	   Chapter 3   Django templates  Django messages context processor    django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages  The Django messages context processor exposes variables related to the Django messages framework,  introduced in Chapter 2. Messages are added in Django view methods to the message framework, which  are then exposed in Django templates. This context processor makes the following variables accessible in  Django templates:  messages.- Contains the messages added through the Django messages framework  in Django view methods.  DEFAULT_MESSAGE_LEVELS.- Contains a mapping of the message level names to their  numeric value  e.g., {'DEBUG': 10, 'INFO': 20, 'WARNING': 30, 'SUCCESS':  25, 'ERROR': 40} .  Other Built-In Django Context Processors: i18n, media, static, tz,   and CSRF context Processors The previous context processors offer some of the most common data required across all Django project  templates, which is why they're enabled by default. However, this doesn't mean they are the only built-in  Django context processors. There are, in fact, five more built-in context processors you can use to access  certain data from all Django templates.  Django i18n context processor  django.template.context_processors.i18n  The Django i18n context processor exposes variables related to internationalization logic. This context  processor makes the following variables accessible in Django templates:  LANGUAGES.- Contains available languages for Django projects.  LANGUAGE_CODE.-Contains the project language code, based on the LANGUAGE_CODE  variable in the settings.py file.  LANGUAGE_BIDI.- Contains the current project language direction. It's set to False  for left-to-right languages  e.g., English, French, German  or True for right-to-left  languages  e.g., Hebrew, Arabic .  Django media context processor  django.template.context_processors.media  The Django media context processor exposes a variable related to media resources. This context processor  makes the following variable accessible in Django templates:  MEDIA_URL.- Contains the media url, based on the MEDIA_URL variable in the  settings.py file.  Django static context processor  django.template.context_processors.static  The Django static context processor exposes a variable related to static resources. This context processor  makes the following variable accessible in Django templates:  STATIC_URL.- Contains the static url, based on the STATIC_URL variable in the  settings.py file.  89   	   	   	  	   	   	   	   Chapter 3   Django templates   even though the static context processor is accessible  i.e., it's not deprecated  its functionality is      Tip  outdated and should be avoided. You should use the staticfiles app instead. more details are provided in   Chapter 5 in the section on setting up static web page resources  Images, Css, javascript .  Django tz context processor  django.template.context_processors.tz  The Django tz context processor exposes a variable related to a project's time zone. This context processor  makes the following variable accessible in Django templates:   	  TIME_ZONE.- Contains a project's time zone, based on the TIME_ZONE variable in the  settings.py file.  Django CSRF context Processor  django.template.context_processors.csrf  The Cross Site Request Forgeries  CSRF  context processor adds the csrf_token variable to all requests. This  variable is used by the {% csrf_token %} template tag to protect against Cross Site Request Forgeries.  Although you can gain access to the csrf_token variable value in any Django template, you will have   little - if any - need to expose it directly, as it's used as a security mechanism to detect forged requests.  Chapter 6, covering the topic of Django forms, describes what it is and how CSRF works with Django.  Due to the security significance of having the csrf_token variable available on all requests, the CSRF   context processor is always enabled - irrespective of the context_processors list in OPTIONS - and cannot be  disabled.  Custom Context Processors  When you set up data in view methods or url extra options, you do so to access the data on individual Django  templates. Custom Django context processors allow you to set up data for access on all Django templates.  A Django custom context processor is structured just like a regular Python method with an HttpRequest   object argument that returns a dictionary. The returning dictionary keys of the context processor represent  template references and the dictionary values data objects  e.g., strings, lists, dictionaries  accessible in  templates. Listing 3-13 illustrates a custom Django context processor method.  Listing 3-13.  Custom Django context processor method  def onsale request :      Create fixed data structures to pass to template      data could equally come from database queries      web services or social APIs     sale_items = {'Monday':'Mocha 2x1','Tuesday':'Latte 2x1'}     return {'SALE_ITEMS': sale_items}  As you can see in Listing 3-13, the onsale method has a request argument – representing an   HttpRequest object - and returns a dictionary. The dictionary in this case has a single key called SALE_ITEMS  and a value that is a hard-coded dictionary.  However, just as you can set up any type of data in a Django view method or url option to pass to a  template, a custom Django context processor method can also access data from the request argument    e.g., cookie, remote IP address  or even query a database and make this data available to all templates.  90   Chapter 3   Django templates  The custom context processor method can be placed inside any project file or directory. The location  and naming conventions are of little importance, because Django detects context processors through the  context_processors variable in OPTIONS of the TEMPLATES variable in a project's settings.py file. I’ll place  the context processor method in Listing 3-13 in a file called processors.py in the stores app subdirectory.  Once you save the custom context processor method, you have to configure Django to locate it.   Listing 3-14 shows the context_processors variable update to include the custom context processor  method from Listing 3-13.  Listing 3-14.  Django template context processor definitions in context_processors in OPTIONS of  TEMPLATES  'OPTIONS': {     'context_processors': [         'coffeehouse.stores.processors.onsale',         'django.template.context_processors.debug',         'django.template.context_processors.request',         'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',         'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',     ], }  In Listing 3-14 you can see the coffeehouse.stores.processors.onsale declaration, where   coffeehouse.stores represents the package.app name, processors is the file that contains the custom  context processor  i.e., processors.py inside the stores app  and onsale is the actual method that contains  the custom context processor logic.  Once you declare the context processors on you project's settings.py file, the custom dictionary with   the SALE_ITEMS key from Listing 3-13 becomes available to all Django templates.  Built-In Django Filters  Django filters are designed to format template variables. The syntax to apply Django filters is the vertical bar  character  also known as “pipe” in Unix environments  e.g., {{variablefilter}} . It’s worth mentioning  that it’s possible to use multiple filters on the same variable  e.g., {{variablefilterfilter}} .  I'll classify each built-in Django filter into functional sections so it's easier to identify them. The   functional classes I'll use are Dates, Strings, Lists, Numbers, Dictionaries, Spacing and special characters,  Development, and Testing and Urls.     Tip   You can apply Django filters to entire sections with the {% filter %} tag. If you have a group of variables  in the same section and want to apply the same filter to all of them, it’s easier to use the {% filter %} tag than to  individually declare the filter on each variable. the next section in this chapter on Django built-in tags provides  more details on the {% filter %} tag  Dates  	  date.- The date filter formats Python datetime objects and only works if the variable  is this type of Python object. The date filter uses a string to specify a format. For  example, if a variable contains a datetime object with the date 01 01 2018, the filter  statement {{variabledate:"F jS o"}} outputs January 1st 2018. The string syntax  for the date filter is based on the characters described in Table 3-3.  91   Chapter 3   Django templates   If you provide no string argument to the date filter  e.g., {{variabledate}} , it defaults to the "n j, Y"      Tip  string, which comes from the default value of Date_Format.     Note   the date filter can also accept predefined date variables {{variabledate:"Date_Format"}},  {{variabledate:"DatetIme_Format"}}, {{variabledate:"short_Date_Format" %} or {{variabledate:  "short_DatetIme_Format"}}.  the predefined date variables in themselves are also composed of date strings based on the syntax in   table 3-3. For example Date_Format default's to "n j, Y"  e.g., jan 1, 2018 , DatetIme_Format defaults  to "n j, Y, p"  e.g., jan 1, 2018, 12 a.m. , short_Date_Format defaults to "m d Y"  e.g., 01 01 2018  and  short_DatetIme_Format defaults to "m d Y p"  e.g., 01 01 2018 12 a.m. . each date variable can be  overridden with different date strings in a project's settings.py file.  Table 3-3.  Django date and time format characters Standards based  characters  Description  r U I  Uppercase i  Hour based characters a A f  s u Timezone characters e  c  g G h H i P  92  Outputs ISO 8601 format  e.g., 2015-01-02T10:30:00.000123+02:00 or 2015-01- 02T10:30:00.000123 if the datetime has no timezone [i.e.,naive datetime]  Outputs RFC 2822 formatted date  e.g., 'Thu, 21 Dec 2000 16:01:07 +0200'  Outputs seconds since Unix epoch date--January 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC Outputs whether daylight savings time is in effect  e.g., '1' or '0'  Description Outputs 'a.m.' or 'p.m.' Outputs 'AM' or 'PM' Outputs time, 12-hour hours and minutes, with minutes left off if they're zero   e.g., '1', '1:30'  Outputs hour, 12-hour format without leading zeros  e.g.'1' to '12'  Outputs hour, 24-hour format without leading zeros  e.g., '0' to '23'  Outputs hour, 12-hour format  e.g., '01' to '12'  Outputs hour, 24-hour format  e.g., '00' to '23'  Outputs minutes  e.g., '00' to '59'  Outputs time, 12-hour hours, minutes and 'a.m.' 'p.m.', with minutes left off if  they're zero and the special-case strings 'midnight' and 'noon' if appropriate   e.g., '1 a.m.', '1:30 p.m.', 'midnight', 'noon', '12:30 p.m.'  Outputs seconds, 2 digits with leading zeros  e.g., '00' to '59'  Outputs microseconds  e.g., 000000 to 999999  Description Outputs timezone name. Can be in any format, or might return an empty  string, depending on datetime definition  e.g., '', 'GMT', '-500', 'US Eastern'    continued    Chapter 3   Django templates  Table 3-3.   continued  Standards based  characters  Description  Day and week characters Description D l  Lowercase L  S  O T Z  w  z W  o  F m M n N  Y  Month characters b d j E  t Year characters L y  Outputs difference in timezone to Greenwich time in hours  e.g., '+0200'  Outputs datetime time zone  e.g., 'EST', 'MDT'  Outputs time zone offset in seconds. The offset for timezones west of UTC is  always negative, and for those east of UTC is always positive  e.g., -43200 to  43200   Outputs day of the week, textual, 3 letters  e.g., 'Thu','Fri'  Outputs day of the week, textual, long  e.g.,'Thursday','Friday'  Outputs English ordinal suffix for day of the month, 2 characters  e.g., 'st', 'nd',  'rd' or 'th'  Outputs day of the week, digits without leading zeros  e.g., '0' for Sunday to '6'  for Saturday  Outputs day of the year  e.g., 0 to 365  Outputs the week number of the year, with weeks starting on Monday based  on ISO-8601  e.g., 1, 53  Outputs week-numbering year, corresponding to the ISO-8601 week number   W  e.g., '1999'  Description Outputs textual month, 3 letters, lowercase  e.g., 'jan','feb'  Outputs day of the month, 2 digits with leading zeros  e.g., '01' to '31'  Outputs day of the month without leading zeros  e.g., '1' to '31'  Outputs month, locale specific alternative representation usually used for long  date representation  e.g., 'listopada' for Polish locale, as opposed to 'Listopad'  Outputs month, textual, long  e.g., 'January','February'  Outputs month, 2 digits with leading zeros  e.g., '01' to '12'  Outputs month, textual, 3 letters  e.g.'Jan','Feb'  Outputs month without leading zeros  e.g., '1' to '12'  Outputs month abbreviation in Associated Press style  e.g., 'Jan', 'Feb', 'March',  'May'  Outputs number of days in the given month  e.g., 28 to 31  Description Outputs Boolean for whether it's a leap year  e.g., True or False  Outputs year, 2 digits  e.g., '99'   Outputs year, 4 digits  e.g., '1999'   To literally output a date character in a string statement you can use the backslash character  e.g., {{variable  date:"jS \o\f F o"}} outputs 1st of January 2018, note the escaped \o\f   93    	   	   	   	   	  Chapter 3   Django templates  time.- The time filter formats the time component of a Python datetime object. The  time filter is similar to the date filter, which uses a string to specify a time format.  For example, if a variable contains a datetime object with a time of noon the filter  statement {{variabletime:"g:i"}} outputs 12:00. The time filter uses the same  format characters illustrated in Table 3-3 related to the time of day.   If you provide no string argument to the date filter  e.g., {{variabletime}} , it defaults to the "p" string,      Tip  which comes from the default value of tIme_Format.   the time filter can also accept a predefined time variable {{variabledate:"tIme Format"}. the      Note  predefined time is also composed of a time string based on the syntax in table 3-3. For example, tIme_Format  default's to "p"  e.g., 4 a.m.  and this can be overridden defining tIme_Format in a project's settings.py file.  timesince.- The timesince filter outputs the time that's passed between  a datetime object and the current time. The timesince filter output is expressed  in seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. For example, if a variable contains the  datetime object 01 01 2018 12:00pm and the current time is 01 01 2018 3:30pm  the statement {{variabletimesince}} outputs 3 hours 30 minutes. The timesince  filter can also calculate the time that's passed between two datetime object variables  - instead of the default current time - by appending a second datetime object  argument  e.g., {{variabletimesince:othervariable}} .  timeuntil.- The timeuntil filter outputs the time that needs to elapse from the  current time to a datetime object. The timeuntil filter output is expressed in  seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. For example, if a variable contains the  datetime object 01 01 2018 10:00pm and the current time is 01 01 2018 9:00pm  the statement {{variabletimeuntil}} outputs 1 hour. The timeuntil filter can  also calculate the time that needs to elapse between two datetime object variables  - instead of the default current time - by appending a second datetime object  argument  e.g., {{variabletimeuntil:othervariable}} .  Strings, Lists, and Numbers  add.- The add filter adds values. The add filter can add two variables or a hard- coded value and a variable. For example, if a variable contains 5 the filter statement  {{variableadd:"3"}} outputs 8. If values can be coerced to integers - like the last  example - the add filter performs a sum, if not the add filter concatenates. For a string  variable that contains "Hello" the filter statement {{variableadd:" World"}}  outputs Hello World. For a list variable that contains ['a','e','i'] and another list  variable that contains ['o','u'] the filter statement {{variableadd:othervariable}}  outputs ['a','e','i','o','u'].  default.- The default filter is used to specify a default value if a variable is false,  doesn't exist, or is empty. For example, if a variable doesn't exist in a template,  contains False or is an empty string  ''  the filter statement {{variabledefault:"no  value"}} outputs no value.  94   Chapter 3   Django templates   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  default_if_none.- The default filter is used to specify a default value if a  variable is None. For example, if a variable contains None the filter statement  {{variabledefault_if_none:"No value"}} outputs No value. Note if a variable  contains an empty string  ''  this is not considered None and the default_if_none  filter does not output its argument value.  length.- The length filter is used to obtain the length of a value. For example, if  a variable contains the string latte the filter statement {{variablelength}}  outputs 5. For a list variable that contains ['a','e','i'] the filter statement  {{variablelength}} outputs 3.  length_is.- The length_is filter is used to evaluate if the length of a value is the  size of a given argument. For example, if a variable contains latte the tag and filter  statement {% if variablelength_is:"7" %} evaluates to false. For a list variable  that contains ['a','e','i'] the tag and filter statement {% if variablelength_ is:"3" %} evaluates to true.  make_list.- The make_list filter creates a list from a string or number. For example,  for the filter and tag statement {% with mycharlist="mocha"make_list %} the  mycharlist variable is assigned the list ['m', 'o', 'c', 'h', 'a']. For an integer variable that  contains 724 the filter and tag statement {% with myintlist=variablemake_list  %} the myintlist is assigned the list ['7', '2', '4'].  yesno.- The yesno filter maps the value of a variable from True,False and None  to the strings yes,no,maybe. For example, if a variable evaluates to True the filter  statement {{variableyesno}} outputs yes, if the variable evaluates to False the  same statement outputs no, and if the variable evaluates to None the same statement  outputs maybe. The yesno filter also accepts custom messages as arguments. For  example, if a variable evaluates to True the filter statement {{variableyesno:"ye a,nay,novote"}} outputs yea, if the variable evaluates to False the same statement  outputs nay, and if the variable evaluates to None the same statement outputs novote.  divisibleby.- The divisibleby filter returns a Boolean value if a variable is  divisible by a given value. For example, if a variable contains 20 the filter statement  {{variabledivisibleby:"5"}} returns True.  filesizeformat.-The filesizeformat filter converts a number of bytes into a  friendly file size string. For example, if a variable contains 250 the filter statement  {{variablefilesizeformat}} outputs 250 bytes, if it contains 2048 the output is 2  KB, if it contains 2000000000 the output is 1.9 GB.  floatformat.- The floatformat filter rounds a floating-point number variable.  The floatformat filter can accept a positive or negative integer argument to round  a variable a specific number of decimals. If no argument is used, the floatformat  filter rounds to one decimal place, as if the argument where -1. For example,  if a variable contains 9.33253 the filter statement {{variablefloatformat}}  outputs 9.3, for the same variable {{variablefloatformat:3}} outputs  9.333 and for {{variablefloatformat:-3}} the output is 9.333; if a variable  contains 9.00000 the filter statement {{variablefloatformat}} outputs 9,  {{variablefloatformat:3}} outputs 9.000 and {{variablefloatformat:-3}}  outputs 9; and if a variable contains 9.37000 the filter statement  {{variablefloatformat}} outputs 9.4, {{variablefloatformat:3}} outputs  9.370 and {{variablefloatformat:-3}} outputs 9.370.  Numbers  95    	   	   	   	   	   	  Chapter 3   Django templates  get_digit.- The get_digit filter outputs the digit of a number variable, where 1 is the  last digit, 2 is the second to last digit, and so on. For example, if a variable contains 10257,  the filter statement {{variableget_digit:"1"}} outputs 7 and the filter statement  {{variableget_digit:"3"}} outputs 2. If the variable or argument is not an integer or  if the argument is less than 1, the get_digit filter outputs the original variable value.  phone2numeric.- The phone2numeric filter converts mnemonic letters in phone  numbers to digits. For example, if a variable contains 1-800-DJANGO the filter  statement {{variablephone2numeric}} outputs 1-800-352646. A phone2numeric  filter value doesn't necessarily need to process valid phone numbers, the filter simply  converts letters to their equivalent telephone keypad numbers.  Strings capfirst.- The capfirst filter capitalizes the first character of a string variable. For example, if a variable  contains hello world the filter statement {{variablecapfirst}} outputs Hello world.  cut.- The cut filter removes all values of a given argument from a string  variable. For example, if a variable contains mocha latte the filter statement  {{variablefilter:"mocha"}} outputs latte. For the same variable the filter  statement is {{variablefilter:" "}} outputs mochalatte.  linenumbers.- The linenumbers filter adds line numbers to each string value  separated by a new line. Listing 3-15 illustrates an example of the linenumbers filter.  Listing 3-15.  Django linenumbers filter   Variable definition Downtown Uptown Midtown   Template definition with linenumbers filter {{variablelinenumbers}}   Output 1.Downtown 2.Uptown 3.Midtown  lower.- The lower filter converts all values of a string variable to lowercase. For  example, if a variable contains Hello World the filter statement {{variablelower}}  outputs hello world.  stringformat.- The stringformat filter formats a value with Python string  formatting syntax.4 For example, if a variable contains 7 the filter statement {{var iablestringformat:"03d"}} outputs 007. Note the stringformat filter does not  require the leading % used in Python string formatting syntax.  4https:  docs.python.org 3 library stdtypes.htmlold-string-formatting  96   Chapter 3   Django templates   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  pluralize.- The pluralize filter returns a plural suffix based on the value of an  argument. For example, if the variable drink_count contains 1 the filter statement  "You have {{drink_count}} drink{{pluralizedrink_count}}" outputs  "You have 1 drink", if the variable contains 2 the same filter statement outputs  "You have 2 drinks". By default, the pluralize filter uses the letter s which is  the most common plural suffix. However, you can specify different singular and  plural suffixes with additional arguments. For example, the filter statement "We  have {{store_count}} business{{store_countpluralize:"es"}}" outputs  "We have 1 business" if store_count is 1 or "We have 5 businesses" if store_ count is 5. Another example is the filter statement "We have {{resp_number}}  responsibilit{{resp_numberpluralize:"y","ies"}}" that outputs "We have 1  responsibility" if resp_number is 1 or "We have 3 responsibilities" if resp_ number is 3.  slugify.- The slugify filter converts a string to an ASCII-type string. This means a  string in converted to lowercase, removes non-word characters  alphanumerics and  underscores , strips leading and trailing whitespace, as well as converts spaces to  hyphens. For example, if a variable contains Welcome to the 1 Coffeehouse! the  filter statement {{variableslugify}} outputs welcome-to-the-1-coffeehouse.  The slugify filter is typically used to normalize strings for urls and file paths.  title.- The title filter converts all first character values of a string variable to  uppercase. For example, if a variable contains hello world the filter statement  {{variabletitle}} outputs Hello World.  truncatechars.- The truncatechars filter truncates a string to a given number  of characters and appends an ellipsis sequence. For example, if a variable  contains Coffeehouse started as a small store the filter statement  {{variabletruncatechars:20}} outputs Coffeehouse started....  truncatechars_html.- The truncatechars_html filter is similar to the  truncatechars filter but is aware of HTML tags. This filter is designed for HTML  content, so content isn't left with open HTML tags. For example, if a variable  contains  Coffeehouse started as a small store  the filter statement  {{variabletruncachars_html:20}} outputs  Coffeehouse start... .  truncatewords.- The truncatewords filter truncates a string to a given  number of words and appends an ellipsis sequence. For example, if a variable  contains Coffeehouse started as a small store the filter statement  {{variabletruncatwords:3}} outputs Coffeehouse started as....  truncatewords_html.- The truncatewords_html filter is similar to the  truncatewords filter but is aware of HTML tags. This filter is designed for HTML  content, so content isn't left with open HTML tags. For example, if a variable  contains  Coffeehouse started as a small store  the filter statement  {{variabletruncatwords_html:3}} outputs  Coffeehouse started as... .  upper.- The upper filter converts all values of a string variable to uppercase. For  example, if a variable contains Hello World the filter statement {{variablelower}}  outputs HELLO WORLD.  wordcount.- The wordcount filter counts the words in a string. For example, if a  variable contains Coffeehouse started as a small store the filter statement  {{variablewordcount}} outputs 6.  97   Chapter 3   Django templates  Lists and Dictionaries   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  dictsort.- The dictsort filter sorts a list of dictionaries and returns a new list sorted  by a given key argument. For example, if a variable contains [{'name':'Downtown',' city':'San Diego'}, {'name':'Uptown','city':'San Diego'},{'name':'Midto wn','city':'San Diego'}] the filter and tag statement {% with newdict=variable dictsort:"name" %} the newdict variable is assigned the list [{'name':'Downtown ','city':'San Diego'},{'name':'Midtown','city':'San Diego'},{'name':'Up town','city':'San Diego'}]. The dictsort filter can also operate on lists of tuples  or lists by specify an index number  e.g., {% with otherlist=listoftuplesdictso rt:0 %}  to sort by the first element of each tuple in the list .  dictsortreversed.- The dictsortreversed filter sorts a list of dictionaries and  returns a new list sorted in reverse by a given key argument. The dictsortreversed  filter works like dictsort except it returns the list in reverse order.  join.- The join filter joins a list with a string. The join filter works just like Python's  str.join list . For example, for a list variable that contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the  filter statement {{variablejoin:"--"}} outputs a--e--i--o--u.  first.- The first filter returns the first item in a list. For example, for a list variable  that contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement {{variablefirst}} outputs a.  last.- The last filter returns the last item in a list. For example, for a list variable that  contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement {{variablelast}} outputs u.  random.- The random filter returns a random item in a list. For example, for a list  variable that contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement {{variablerandom}}  could output a, e, i, o, or u.  slice.- The slice filter returns the slice of a list. For example, for a list variable that  contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement {{variableslice:":3"}} outputs ['a','e','i'].  unordered_list.- The unordered_list outputs an HTML unordered list from a list  variable. Listing 3-16 illustrates an example of the unordered_list filter.  Listing 3-16.  Django unordered_list filter   Variable definition ["Stores",["San Diego",["Downtown","Uptown","Midtown"]]]   Template definition with linenumbers filter {{variableunordered_list}}   Output  Stores              San Diego                 Downtown      Uptown      Midtown                       98      Caution    the first level of the unordered_list filter does not include opening or closing html   tags  Chapter 3   Django templates  Spacing and Special Characters  addslashes.- The addslashes filter adds slashes to all quotes  i.e., it escapes quotes .  The addslashes filter is useful when Django templates are used to export data to  other systems that require to escape quotes  e.g., CSV files . For example, if a variable  contains Today's news the filter statement {{variableaddslashes}} outputs  Today\'s news.  center.- The center filter center aligns a value and pads it with additional  whitespace characters until it reaches the given argument of characters. For example,  if a variable contains mocha the filter statement {{variablecenter:"15"}} outputs.  "mocha".  i.e., 5 spaces to the left of mocha, 5 spaces for mocha, 5 spaces to the right  of mocha.  ljust.- The ljust filter left aligns a value and pads it with additional whitespace  characters until it reaches the given argument of characters. For example, if a  variable contains mocha the filter statement {{variableljust:"15"}} outputs.  "mocha". i.e., 5 spaces for mocha, 10 space padding .  rjust.- The rjust filter right aligns a value and pads it with additional whitespace  characters until it reaches the given argument of characters. For example, if a  variable contains latte the filter statement {{variablerjust:"10"}} outputs.  "latte"." i.e., 5 space padding, 5 spaces for latte .  escape.- The escape filter escapes HTML characters from a value. Specifically  with the escape filter:   is converted to &gt; ,'  single  quote  is converted to &39; ,"  double quote  is converted to &quot; and & is  converted to &amp.   If you use the escape filter on contiguous variables, it's easier to wrap the variables with the       Tip  {% autoescape %} tag to achieve the same results.  escapejs.- The escapejs filter escapes characters into Unicode strings that are  often used for JavaScript strings. Though the escapejs filter does not make a string  HTML safe, it does protect against syntax errors when using templates to generate  JavaScript JSON. For example, if a variable contains "mocha\r\n \'price:2.25"  the filter statement {{variableescapejs}} outputs \u0022mocha\u000D\u000A \ u0027price:2.25\u0022.  force_escape.- The force_escape filter escapes HTML characters from a value  just like the escape filter. The difference is force_escape is applied immediately  and returns a new and escaped string. This is useful when you need multiple  escaping or want to apply other filters to the escaped results. Normally, you'll use  the escape filter.  99   	   	   	   	   	  	   	  	   	   	    	   	   	   	  	   	  Chapter 3   Django templates  linebreaks.- The linebreaks filter replaces plain text line breaks with HTML tags,  a single newline becomes an HTML line break    , and a new line followed by  a blank line becomes a paragraph break    . For example, if a variable contains  385 Main\nSan Diego, CA the filter statement {{variablelinebreaks}} outputs   385 Main San Diego, CA .  linebreaksbr.- The linebreaksbr filter converts all text variable new lines to HTML  line breaks    . For example, if a variable contains 385 Main\nSan Diego, CA the  filter statement {{variablelinebreaksbr}} outputs 385 Main San Diego, CA.  striptags.- The striptags filter removes all HTML tags from a value. For example,  if a variable contains  Coffee house, the  best   drinks<  span> the filter statement {{variablestriptags}} outputs Coffeehouse, the  best drinks.     Caution   the striptags filter uses very basic logic to strip html tags. this means there’s a possibility  a convoluted piece of html isn’t fully stripped of tags. this is why content in variables passed through the  striptags filter is automatically escaped and should never be marked as safe.  safe.- The safe filter marks a string as not requiring HTML escaping.  safeseq.- The safeseq applies the safe filter to each element of a list. It's useful  in conjunction with other filters that operate on a list, such as the join filter  e.g.,  {{storessafeseqjoin:", "}} . You wouldn't use the safe filter directly on list  variables, as it would first convert the variable to a string, rather than working with  the individual elements of a list.  wordwrap.- The wordwrap filter wraps words at a given character line length  argument. Listing 3-17 illustrates an example of the wordwrap filter.  Listing 3-17.  Django wordwrap filter   Variable definition  Coffeehouse started as a small store   Template definition with wordwrap filter for every 12 characters {{variablewordwrap:12}}   Output Coffeehouse started as a small store  100  Development and Testing   	  pprint.- The pprint filter is a wrapper for Python's pprint.pprint  . The pprint  filter is useful during development and testing because it outputs the formatted  representation of an object.   Urls  Chapter 3   Django templates   	   	   	   	  iriencode.- The iriencode filter converts an Internationalized Resource  Identifier  IRI  to a string that is suitable for inclusion in a URL. This is necessary  if you're trying to use strings containing non-ASCII characters in a URL. For  example, if a variable contains ?type=cold&size=large the filter statement  {{variableiriencode}} outputs ?type=cold&amp;size=large.  urlencode.- The urlencode filter escapes a value for use in a URL. For example, if  a variable contains http:  localhost drinks?type=cold&size=large the filter  statement {{variableurlencode}} outputs http%3A  localhost drinks%3Ftype% 3Dcold%26size%3Dlarge. The urlenconde filter assumes the   character is safe. The  urlencode filter can accept an optional argument with the characters that should not  be escaped. An empty string can be provided when all characters should be escaped   e.g., {{variableurlencode:""}} outputs http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fdrinks%3Ft ype%3Dcold%26size%3Dlarge .  urlize.- The urlize filter converts text URLs or email addresses into clickable HTML  links. This urlize filter works on links prefixed with http:  , https:  , or www.. Links  generated by the urlize filter have a rel="nofollow" attribute added to them. For  example, if a variable contains Visit http:  localhost drinks the filter statement  {{variableurlize}} outputs Visit <a href="http:  localhost drinks"  rel="nofollow">http:  localhost drinks ; if a variables contains Contact  support@coffeehouse.com the filter statement {{variableurlize}} outputs  Contact  support@coffeehouse. com .  urlizetrunc.- The urlizetrunc filter converts text URLs and emails into  clickable HTML links - just like the urlize filter - except it truncates the url to  a given number of characters that include an ellipsis sequence. For example,  if a variable contains Visit http:  localhost drinks the filter statement  {{variableurlizetrunc:20}} outputs Visit <a href="http:  localhost  drinks" rel="nofollow">http:  localhost ... .     Caution  variables with html links, the filter logic won’t work as expected.   the urlize and urlizetrunc filters should only be applied to variables with plain text. If applied to   Built-In Django Tags  Django offers several built-in tags that offer immediate access to elaborate operations on Django templates.  Unlike Django filters that operate on individual variables, tags are designed to produce results without a  variable or operate across template sections.  I'll classify each of these built-in tags into functional sections so it's easier to identify them. The   functional classes I'll use are Dates, forms, comparison operations, loops, Python and filter operations,  spacing and special characters, template structures, development and testing, and urls.  101   Chapter 3   Django templates  Dates  	  {% now %}.- The {% now %} tag offers access to the current system time. The {% now  %} tag accepts a second argument to format the system date. For example, if the  system date is 01 01 2015 for the statement {% now "F jS o" %} the tag output is  January 1st 2015. The string syntax for the {% now %} tag is based on Django date  characters described in Table 3-3. It's also possible to use the as keyword to reuse  the value through a variable e.g. {% now "Y" as current_year %} and later in the  template declare Copyright {{current_year}} .   the {% now %} tag can accept Django date variables: {% now "Date_Format" %}, {% now      Tip  "DatetIme_Format" %}, {% now "short_Date_Format" %}, or {% now "short_DatetIme_Format"}.  the date variables in themselves are also composed of date strings. For example Date_Format default's to "n  j, Y"  e.g., jan 1, 2015 , DatetIme_Format defaults to "n j, Y, p"  e.g., jan 1, 2015, 12 a.m. , short_Date_ Format defaults to "m d Y"  e.g., 01 01 2015  and short_DatetIme_Format defaults to "m d Y p"  e.g.,  01 01 2015 12 a.m. . each date variable can be overridden with different date strings in a project's settings.py file.  Forms  	  {% csrf_token %}.- The {% csrf_token %} tag provides a string to prevent cross  site scripting. The {% csrf_token %} tag is only intended to be used inside HTML    tags. The data output of the {% csrf_token %} tag allows Django to prevent  request forgeries  e.g., HTTP POST requests  from form data submissions. More  details about the {% csrf_token %} tag are provided in the Django form chapter.  Comparison Operations   	  {% if %} with {% elif %} {% else %}.- The {% if %} tag is typically used in  conjunction with the {% elif %} and {% else %} tags to evaluate more than one  condition. An {% if %} tag with an argument variable evaluates to true if a variable  exists and is not empty or if the variable holds a True Boolean value. Listing 3-18  illustrates a series of {% if %} tag examples.  Listing 3-18.  Django {% if %} tag with {% elif %} and {% else %}  {% if drinks %}             {% if drinks %}              {% if drinks %}   We have drinks!                We have drinks              We have drinks {% endif %}                 {% else %}                   {% elif drinks_on_sale %}                                 No drinks,sorry              We have drinks on sale!                             {% endif %}                  {% else %}                                                            No drinks, sorry                                                          {% endif %}   a variable must both exist and not be empty to evaluate to true. a variable that just exists and is      Note  empty evaluates to false.  102    	   	   	   	   	  Chapter 3   Django templates  {% if %} with and, or and not operators.- The {% if %} tag also supports the and,  or, and not operators to create more elaborate conditions. These operators allow  you to compare if more than one variable is not empty  e.g., {% if drinks and  drinks_on_sale %} , if one or another variable is not empty  e.g., {% if drinks or  drinks_on_sale %} , or if a variable is empty  e.g., {% if not drinks %} .  {% if %} with ==, !=,  ,  = operators.- The {% if %} tag also supports  equal, not equal, larger than and less than operators to create conditions that  compare variables to fixed strings or numbers. These operators allow you to compare  if a variable equals a string or number  e.g., {% if drink == "mocha" %} , if a  variable does not equal a variable or number  e.g., {% if store.id != 2 %}  or if a  variable is greater than or lesser than a number  e.g., {% if store.id > 5 %} .  {% firstof %}.- The {% firstof %} tag is a shorthand tag to output the first  variable in a set of variables that's not empty. The same functionality of the {%  firstof %} tag is achieved by nesting {% if %} tags. Listing 3-19 illustrates a sample  of the {% firstof %} tag, as well as an equivalent set of nested {% if %} tags.  Listing 3-19.  Django {% firstof %} tag and equivalent {% if %}{% elif %}{% else %} tags   Firstof example {% firstof var1 var2 var3 %}   Equivalent of firstof example {% if var1 %}     {{var1safe}} {% elif var2 %}     {{var2safe}} {% elif var3 %}     {{var3safe}} {% endif %}   Firstof example with a default value in case of no match  i.e, all variables are empty  {% firstof var1 var2 var3 "All vars are empty" %}   Assign the firstof result to another variable {% firstof var1 var2 var3 as resultof %}  resultof now contains result of firstof statement  {% if   in %} and {% if   not in %}.- The {% if %} tag also  supports the in and not in operators to verify the presence of a constant or variable.  For example {% if "mocha" in drinks %} tests if the value "mocha" is in the drinks  list variable or {% if 2 not in stores %} tests if the value 2 is not in the stores  list variable. Although the in and not in operators are commonly used to test list  variables, it's also possible to test the presence of characters on strings  e.g., {% if  "m" in drink %} . In addition, it's also possible to compare if the value of one  variable is present in another variable  e.g., {% if order_drink in drinks %} .  {% if   is   %} and {% if   is not %}.- The {% if %} tag  also supports the is and is not operators to make object-level comparisons. For  example {% if target_drink is None %} tests if the value target_drink is a None  object or {% if daily_special is not True %} tests if the value daily_special is  not True.  103   Chapter 3   Django templates   	  {% if value      %} .- The {% if %} tag also  supports applying filters directly on a value and then performing an evaluation. For  example, {% if target_drink_listrandom == user_drink %}Congratulations  your drink just got selected!{% endif %} uses the random filter directly in a  condition.  PARENTHESES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN IF TAGS: OPERATOR  PRECEDENCE GOVERNS, USE NESTED IF TAGS TO ALTER   PRECEDENCE  Comparison operators are often aggregated into single statements  e.g., if... ...and...==...  and  follow a certain execution precedence. Django follows the same operator precedence as python.5 so,  for example, the statement {% if drink in specials or drink == drink_of_the_day %} gets evaluated as    drink in specials  or  drink == drink_of_the_day  , where the internal parentheses operations are run  first, since in and == have higher precedence than or.  In python you can alter this precedence by using explicit parentheses in comparison statements.  however, Django does not support the use of parentheses in {% if %} tags, you must either rely on  operator precedence or use nested {% if %} statements to declare the same logic produced by explicit  parentheses.  Loops  	  {% for %} and {% for %} with {% empty %}.- The {% for %} tag iterates over items  on a dictionary, list, tuple, or string variable. The {% for %} tag syntax is {% for    in   %}, where reference is assigned a new value from  variable on each iteration.  Depending on the nature of a variable there can be one or more references  e.g., for a list one reference   {% for item in list %}, for a dictionary two references {% for key,value in dict.items %} .In  addition, it’s also possible to invert the loop sequence with the reversed keyword  e.g., {% for item in  list reversed %} . The {% for %} tag also supports the {% empty %} tag which is processed in case there  are no iterations in a loop  i.e., the main variable is empty . Listing 3-20 illustrates a {% for %} and a {% for  %} and {% empty %} loop example.  Listing 3-20.  Django {% for %} tag and {% for %} with {% empty %}                                      {% for drink in drinks %}             {% for storeid,store in stores %}   {{ drink.name }}                {{store.name}}    {% empty %}                           {% endfor %}   No drinks, sorry              {% endfor %}       5https:  docs.python.org 3 reference expressions.htmlevaluation-order  104   The {% for %} tag also generates a series of variables to manage the iteration process, such as an   iteration counter, a first iteration flag, and a last iteration flag. These variables can be useful when you want  to create behaviors  e.g., formatting, additional processing  on a given iteration. Table 3-4 illustrates the   {% for %} tag variables.  Chapter 3   Django templates  Table 3-4.  Django {% for %} tag variables  Variable  Description  forloop.counter forloop.counter0 forloop.revcounter forloop.revcounter0 forloop.first forloop.last  forloop.parentloop  The current iteration of the loop  1-indexed  The current iteration of the loop  0-indexed  The number of iterations from the end of the loop  1-indexed  The number of iterations from the end of the loop  0-indexed  True if it's the first time through the loop True if it's the last time through the loop  For nested loops, this is the parent loop to the current one   	   	  {% ifchanged %}.- The {% ifchanged %} tag is a special logical tag used inside {%  for %} tags. Sometimes it's helpful to know if a loop reference has changed from one  iteration to the other  e.g., to insert a new title . The argument for the {% ifchanged  %} tag is the loop reference itself  e.g.{% ifchanged drink %}{{drink}} section{%  endifchanged %}  or a part of the reference  e.g., {% ifchanged store.name %} Available in {{store.name}}{% endifchanged %} . The {% ifchanged %} tag  also support the use of {% else %} tag  e.g., {% ifchanged drink %}{{drink. name}}{% else %}Same old {{drink.name}} as before{% endifchanged %} .  {% cycle %}.- The {% cycle %} tag is used inside {% for %} tags to iterate over a  given set of strings or variables. One of the primary uses of the {% cycle %} tag is  to define CSS classes so each iteration receives a different CSS class. For example, if  you want assign different CSS classes to a list so each line appears in different colors   e.g., white, gray, white, gray  you can use <li class="{% cycle 'white' 'grey'  %}">, in this manner on each loop iteration the class value alternates between white  and gray. The {% cycle %} tag can iterate sequentially over any number of strings or  variables  e.g., {% cycle var1 var2 'red' %} .  By default, a {% cycle %} tag progresses through its values on the basis of its enclosing loop  i.e., one by  one . But under certain circumstances, you may need to use a {% cycle %} tag outside of a loop or explicitly  declare how a {% cycle %} tag advances. You can achieve this behavior by naming the {% cycle %} tag with  the as keyword, as illustrated in Listing 3-21.  Listing 3-21.  Django {% cycle %} with explicit control of progression   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   Outputs  105   Chapter 3   Django templates   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   As you can see in Listing 3-21, the {% cycle %} tag statement initially produces the first value and   afterwards you can continue using the cycle reference name to output the same value. In order to advance  to the next value in the cycle, you call the {% cycle %} once more with the cycle reference name. A minor  side effect of the {% cycle %} tag is that it outputs its initial value where it’s declared, something that can be  problematic if you plan to use the cycle as a placeholder or in nested loops. To circumvent this side effect,  you can use the silent keyword after the cycle reference name  e.g., {% cycle 'disc' 'circle' 'square'  as bullettype silent %} .   	   	  {% resetcycle %}.- The {% resetcycle %} tag is used is to reinitiate a {% cycle %}  tag to its first element. A {% cycle %} tag always loops over its entire set of values  before returning to its first one, something that can be problematic in the context  of nested loops. For example, if you want to assign three color codes  e.g.{% cycle  'red' 'orange' 'yellow' %}  to nested groups, the first group can consist of two  elements that use up the first two cycle values  e.g., 'red' 'orange' , which means  the second group starts on the third color code  e.g., 'yellow' . In order for the  second group to start with the first {% cycle %} element again, you can use the  {% resetcycle %} tag after a nested loop iteration finishes so the {% cycle %} tag  returns to its first element.  {% regroup %}.- The {% regroup %} tag is used to rearrange the contents of a  dictionary variable into different groups. The {% regroup %} tag avoids the need to  create complex conditions inside a {% for %} tag to achieve the desired display. The  {% regroup %} tag arranges the contents of a dictionary beforehand, making the {%  for %} tag logic simpler. Listing 3-22 illustrates a dictionary with the use of the {%  regroup %} tag along with its output.  Listing 3-22.  Django {% for %} tag and {% regroup %}   Dictionary definition stores = [     {'name': 'Downtown', 'street': '385 Main Street', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'name': 'Uptown', 'street': '231 Highland Avenue', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'name': 'Midtown', 'street': '85 Balboa Street', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'name': 'Downtown', 'street': '639 Spring Street', 'city': 'Los Angeles'},     {'name': 'Midtown', 'street': '1407 Broadway Street', 'city': 'Los Angeles'},     {'name': 'Downton', 'street': '50 1st Street', 'city': 'San Francisco'}, ]   Template definition with regroup and for tags {% regroup stores by city as city_list %}    {% for city in city_list %}      {{ city.grouper }}               {% for item in city.list %}  106   Chapter 3   Django templates             {{ item.name }}: {{ item.street }}          {% endfor %}             {% endfor %}     Output San Diego     Downtown : 385 Main Street     Uptown : 231 Highland Avenue     Midtown : 85 Balboa Street Los Angeles     Downtown: 639 Spring Street     Midtown: 1407 Broadway Street San Francisco     Downtown: 50 1st Street   the {% regroup %} tag can also use filters or properties to achieve grouping results. For example, the      Tip  stores list in 3-22 is conveniently preordered by city making grouping by city automatic, but if the stores list  were not preordered, you would need to sort the list by city first to avoid fragmented groups, you can use a  dictsort filter directly  e.g., {% regroup storesdictsort:'city' by city as city_list %} . another possibility of the   {% regroup %} tag is to use nested properties if the grouping object has them  e.g., if city had a state property  {% regroup stores by city.state as state_list %} .  Python and Filter Operations   	   	  {% filter %}.- The {% filter %} tag is used to apply Django filters to template  sections. If you declare {% filter lower %} the lower filter is applied to all  variables between this tag and the {% endfilter %} tag - note the filter lower  converts all content to lowercase. It’s also possible to apply multiple filters to the  same section using the same pipe technique to chain filters to variables  e.g., {%  filter lowercenter:"50" %}...variables to convert to lower case and  center...{% endfilter %} .  {% with %}.- The {% with %} tag lets you define variables in the context of Django  templates. It's useful when you need to create variables for values that aren't exposed  by a Django view method or when a variable is tied to a heavyweight operation. It’s  also possible to define multiple variables in the same {% with %} tag  e.g., {% with  drinkwithtax=drink.cost*1.07 drinkpromo=drink.cost*0.85 %} . Each variable  defined in a {% with %} tag is made available to the template until the {% endwith  %} tag is reached.  107   Chapter 3   Django templates  PYTHON LOGIC ONLY ALLOWED BEHIND THE SCENES IN CUSTOM   DJANGO TAGS OR FILTERS  Django templates don't allow the inclusion of inline python logic. In fact, the closest thing Django  templates allow to inline python logic is through the {% with %} tag, which isn't very sophisticated.  the only way to make custom python logic work in Django templates is to embed the code inside a  custom Django tag or filter. this way you can place a custom Django tag or filter on a template and the  python logic runs behind the scenes. the next section describes how to create custom Django filters.  Spacing and Special Characters  {% autoescape %}.- The {% autoescape %} tag is used to escape HTML characters  from a template section. The {% autoescape %} accepts one of two arguments on  or off. With {% autoescape on %} all template content between this tag and the  {% endautoescape %} tag is HTML escaped and with {% autoescape off %} all  template content between this tag and the {% endautoescape %} tag is not escaped.   If you want to enable or disable auto-escaping globally  i.e., on all templates , it's easier to disable it      Tip  at the project level using the autoescape field in the optIons variable in the templates configuration, inside a  project's settings.py file, as described in the first section of this chapter.  If you want to enable or disable auto-escaping on individual variables, you can either use the safe filter to  disable auto-escaping on a single Django template variable or the escape filter to escape a single Django  template variable.  {% spaceless %}.- The {% spaceless %} tag removes whitespace between HTML  tags, including tab characters and newlines. Therefore all HTML content contained  within the {% spaceless %} and {% endspaceless %} becomes more compact.  Note the {% spaceless %} tag only removes space between HTML tags, it does not  remove space between text and HTML tags  e.g.,     my span      , only the space between     and     tags is removed, the  space between   tags that pads the myspan string remains .  {% templatetag %}.- The {% templatetag %} tag is used to output reserved Django  template characters. So if by any chance you want to display any of the characters  {%, %}, {{, }}, {, }, { or } verbatim on a template you can. The {% templatetag %}  is used in conjunction with one of eight arguments to represent Django template  characters. {% templatetag openblock %} outputs {%, {% templatetag closeblock  %} outputs %}, {% templatetag openvariable %} outputs {{, {% templatetag  closevariable %} outputs }}, {% templatetag openbrace %} outputs {, {%  templatetag closebrace %} outputs }, {% templatetag opencomment %} outputs  { and {% templatetag closecomment %} outputs }. A simpler approach is to wrap  reserved Django characters with the {% verabtim %} tag.   	   	   	  108   Chapter 3   Django templates  Template Structures   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  {% verbatim %}.- The {% verbatim %} tag is used to isolate template content from  being processed. Any content inside the {% verbatim %} tag and {% endverbatim  %} tag is bypassed by Django. This means special characters like {{ , variable  statements like {{drink}}, or JavaScript logic that uses special Django characters is  ignored and rendered verbatim. If you need to output individual special characters  use the {% templatetag %} tag.  {% widthratio %}.- The {% widthratio %} tag is used to calculate the ratio of  a value to a maximum value. The {% widthratio %} tag is helpful for displaying  content that is fixed in width but requires to be scaled based on the amount of  available space, such as the case with images and charts. For example, given the  statement <img src="logo.gif" style="width:{% widthratio available_width  image_width 100 %}%" >, if the available_width is 75 and image_width is 150  it results in 0.50 multiplied by 100, which results in 50. This image's width ratio is  calculated based on the available space and image size, in this case the statement is  rendered as:  .  {% lorem %}.- The {% lorem %} tag is used to display random Latin text, which is  useful for filler on templates. The {% lorem %} tag supports up to three parameters  {% lorem [count] [method] [random] %}. Where [count] is a number or variable  with the number of paragraphs or words to generate, if not provided the default  [count] is 1. Where [method] is either w for words, p for HTML paragraphs, or b for  plain-text paragraph blocks, if not provided the default [method] is b. And where the  word random  if given  outputs random Latin words, instead of a common pattern   e.g., Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... .  {% block %}.- The {% block %} tag is used to define page sections that can be  overridden on different Django templates. See the previous section in this chapter on  how to create reusable templates for examples of this tag.  {% comment "Optional explanation" %}.- The {% comment %} tag is used to  define comment sections on Django templates. Any content placed between the {%  comment %} and {% endcomment %} tag is bypassed by Django and doesn't appear in  the final rendered web page. Note the string argument in the opening {% comment %}  tag is optional, but helps clear up the purpose of the comment.  { }.- The { } syntax can be used for a single line comment on Django  templates. Any content placed between { and } in a single line is bypassed by  Django and doesn't appear in the final rendered web page. Note that if the comment  spans multiple lines you should use the {% comment %} tag.  {% extends %}.- The {% extends %} tag is used to reuse the layout of another  Django template. See the previous section in this chapter on creating reusable  templates for examples of this tag.  {% include %}.- The {% include %} tag is used to embed a Django template on  another Django template. See the previous section in this chapter on creating  reusable templates for examples of this tag.  {% load %}.- The {% load %} tag is used to load custom Django tags and filters. The  {% load %} tag requires one or multiple arguments to be the names of the custom  Django tags or filters. The next section of this chapter describes how to create custom  filters and how to use the {% load %} tag.  109   Chapter 3   Django templates   If you find yourself using the {% load %} tag on many templates, you may find it easier to register      Tip  Django tags and filters with the builtins option in templates so they become accessible on all templates as if  they were built in. see the first section in this chapter on template configuration for more details.  Development and Testing  {% debug %}.- The {% debug %} tag outputs debugging information that includes  template variables and imported modules. The {% debug %} tag is useful during  development and testing because it outputs 'behind the scenes' information used by  Django templates.  {% url %}.- The {% url %} tag is used to build urls from predefined values in a  project's urls.py file. The {% url %} tag is useful because it avoids the need to   hard-code urls on templates, instead it inserts urls based on names. The {% url %}   tag accepts a url name as its first argument and url parameters as subsequent  arguments.  For example, if a url points to  drinks index  and is named drinks_main, you can use the {% url %} to  reference this url  e.g.,   Go to drinks home page   ; if a url points  to  stores 1  and is named stores_detail you can use the {% url %} with an argument to reference this url   e.g.,   Go to {{store.name}} page   .  The {% url %} tag also supports the as keyword to define the result as a variable. This allows the result  to be used multiple times or at a point other than where the {% url %} tag is declared  e.g., {% url drink_ detail drink.name as drink_on_the_day%}...later in the template    Drink of the day   . Chapter 2 describes this process to name Django url's for easier management and  reverse matches in greater detail.  Custom Filters  On occasions, Django built-in filters fall short in terms of the logic or output they offer. In these  circumstances, the solution is to write a custom filter to achieve the outcome you require.  The logic behind Django filters is entirely written in Python, so whatever is achievable with Python &   Django  e.g., perform a database query, use a third-party REST service  can be integrated as part of the logic  or output generated by a custom filter.  Structure The simplest custom Django filter only requires you to create a standard Python method and decorate it with  @register.filter   as illustrated in Listing 3-23.   	   	  Urls  110   Chapter 3   Django templates  Listing 3-23.  Django custom filter with no arguments  from django import template register = template.Library    @register.filter   def boldcoffee value :     '''Returns input wrapped in HTML  tags'''     return ' %s ' % value  Listing 3-23 first imports the template package and creates a register reference to decorate the   boldcoffee method and tells Django to create a custom filter out of it.  By default, a filter receives the same name as the decorated method. So in this case, the boldcoffee   method creates a filter named boldcoffee. The method input value represents the input of the filter caller.  In this case, the method simply returns the input value wrapped in HTML   tags, where the syntax used in  the return statement is a standard Python string format operation.  To apply this custom filter in a Django template you use the syntax {{bylineboldcoffee}}. The   byline variable is passed as the value argument to the filter method, so if the byline variable contains the  text Open since 1965! the filter output is  Open since 1965! .  Django custom filters also support the inclusion of arguments, as illustrated in Listing 3-24.  Listing 3-24.  Django custom filter with arguments  @register.filter   def coffee value,arg="muted" :     '''Returns input wrapped in HTML  tags with a CSS class'''     '''Defaults to CSS class 'muted' from Bootstrap'''     return ' %s ' %  arg,value   The filter method in Listing 3-24 has two input arguments. The value argument that represents the  variable on which the filter is applied and a second argument arg="muted" where "muted" represents a  default value. If you look at the return statement you'll notice it uses the arg variable to define a class  attribute and the value variable is used to define the content inside a   tag.  If you call the custom filter in Listing 3-24 with the same syntax as the first custom filter  e.g.,   {{bylinecoffee}}  the output defaults to using "muted" for the arg variable and the final output is <span  class="muted">Open since 1965! .  However, you can also call the filter in Listing 3-24 using a parameter to override the arg variable.   Filter parameters are appended with :. For example, the filter statement {{bylinecoffee:"lead muted"}}  assigns "lead muted" as the value for the arg variable and produces the output <span class="lead  muted">Open since 1965! .  Parameters provide more flexibility for custom filters because they can further influence the final output   with data that's different than the main input.     Tip   In case a filter requires two or more arguments, you can use a space-separated or CsV-type string  parameter in the filter definition  e.g., bylinemymultifilter:"18,success,green,2em"  and later parse the string  inside the filter method to access each parameter.  111   Chapter 3   Django templates  Options: Naming, HTML, and What Comes In and Out Although the two previous examples illustrate the core structure of custom filters, they are missing a series  of options that make custom filters more flexible and powerful. Table 3-5 illustrates a series of custom filter  options, along with their syntax and a description of what it is they do.  Table 3-5.  Custom filter options.  Option syntax  Values  Description  @register.filter   name=   @register.filter is_safe=False   A sting to name  the filter True False  @register.filter   needs_autoescape=False   True False  @register.filter   expects_localtime=False   True False  Assigns a filter name different from the filter method  name. Defines how to treat a filter’s return value    safe or with auto-escape . Defines the need to access the auto-escaping status  of the caller  i.e., whether the filter is called in a  template with or without auto-escaping . If the filter is applied on a datetime value, it converts  the value to the project timezone, before running  the filter logic.  @register.filter   @stringfilter  N A  Stand-alone decorator that casts input to string.  As you can see in Table 3-5, with the exception of one option, all custom filter options are offered by   arguments of the @register.filter   decorator and include default values. So even if you declare an  empty @register.filter   decorator, four out of five options in Table 3-5 operate with default values. Note  it’s possible to add multiple options to the @register.filter   decorator separated by commas  e.g., @ register.filter name='myfilter',is_safe=True  .  Let’s talk about the name option in Table 3-5. By default and as you learned in the previous examples,  custom filters receive the same name as the method they decorate  i.e., if the backing method of a custom  filter is named coffee, the filter is also called coffee . The name option allows you to give a filter a different  name than the backing method name. Note that if use the name option and try to call the filter with the  method name, you'll get an error because the filter doesn't exist by method name anymore.  All custom filters operate on input provided by variables that can potentially be any Python type  string,   integer, datetime, list, dictionary, etc. . This creates a multitude of possibilities that must be handled in the  logic of a custom filter; otherwise errors are bound to be common  e.g., a call is made to a filter with an  integer variable, but the internal filter logic is designed for string variables . To alleviate these potential input  type issues, custom filters can use the last two options presented in Table 3-5.  The expects_localtime option in Table 3-5 is designed for filters that operate on datetime variables. If  you expect a datetime input, you can set the expects_localtime to True and this makes the datetime input  timezone aware based on your project settings.  The @stringfilter option in Table 3-5 – which is a stand-alone decorator, placed below the    @register.filter decorator – is designed to cast a filter input variable to a string. This is helpful because it  removes the need to perform input type checks and irrespective of what variable type a filter is called with   e.g., string, integer, list, or dictionary variable  the filter logic can ensure it will always gets a string.  A subtle but default behavior of custom filters is the output that is not considered safe, due to the    is_safe option in Table 3-5 defaulting to False.  This default setting causes the custom filters from Listings 3-23 and 3-24 that contain HTML   or     tags to create verbatim output  i.e., you won't see the text rendered in bold, but rather  Open since  1965!  literally . Sometimes this is desired behavior, but sometimes it's not.  112   Chapter 3   Django templates   to make a Django template render html characters after applying a custom filter with default settings,       Tip  you can use the built-in safe filter  e.g., {{bylinecoffeesafe}}  or surround the filter declaration with the  built-in {% autoescape %} tag  e.g., {% autoescape off %} {{bylinecoffee}} {% endautoescape %}  tag . however, Django filters can also set the filter is_safe option to true to make the process automatic and  avoid the need to use an extra filter or tag.  You can set the is_safe option in a custom filter to True, to ensure the custom filter output is rendered   'as is'  e.g., the   tag is rendered in bold  and HTML elements aren’t escaped .  This filter design approach though makes one big assumption: a custom filter will always be called   with variables containing safe content. What happens if the byline variable contains the text Open  since 1965 & serving > 1000 coffees day!. The variable now contains the unsafe characters & and  > , why are they unsafe? Because they have special meaning in HTML and have the potential to mangle  a page layout if they’re not escaped  e.g., the > might mean 'more than' in this context, but in HTML it  also means a tag opening, which a browser can interpret as markup, in turn mangling the page because  it’s never closed .  To avoid this potential issue of marking unsafe input characters and marking them as safe on output,  you need to rely on the calling template telling the filter if the input is safe or unsafe, which takes us to the  last custom filter option in Table 3-5: needs_autoescape.  The needs_autoescape option – which defaults to False – is used to enable a filter to be informed of the   underlying auto-escaping setting in the template where the filter is called. Listing 3-25 shows a filter that  makes use of this option.  Listing 3-25.  Django custom filter that detects autoescape setting  from django import template from django.utils.html import escape from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe  register = template.Library    @register.filter needs_autoescape=True  def smartcoffee value, autoescape=True :     '''Returns input wrapped in HTML tags'''     '''and also detects surrounding autoescape on filter  if any  and escapes '''     if autoescape:         value = escape value      result = ' %s ' % value     return mark_safe result   The needs_autoescape parameter and the autoescape keyword argument of the filter method allow the   filter to know whether escaping is in effect when the filter is called. If auto-escaping is on, then the value is  passed through the escape method to escape all characters. Whether or not the content of value is escaped,  the filter passes the final result through the mark_safe method so the HTML   tag is interpreted as bold in  the template.  This filter is more robust than a filter that uses the is_safe=True option - and marks everything as  'safe' - because it can deal with unsafe input, as long as the template user makes the appropriate use of  auto-escape.  113   Chapter 3   Django templates  Installation and Access Django custom filters can be stored in one of two locations:  Inside apps .- Stored in .py files located inside Django apps in a folder called  templatetags.  Any project location.- Stored in .py files on any folder in a Django project, configured  through the libraries field in OPTIONS of the TEMPLATES variable in settings.py.  Listing 3-26 illustrates a project directory structure that exemplifies these two locations to store custom    	   	  filters.  Listing 3-26.  Django custom filter directory structure  +-   +-__init__.py +-settings.py +-urls.py +-wsgi.py  +----common----+                              +--coffeehouse_filters.py  +---- ---+                                  +-__init__.py                 +-models.py                 +-tests.py                 +-views.py                 +----------- ---+                                                                                              +-__init__.py                                               +-store_format_tf.py +---- ---+                                   +-__init__.py                  +-models.py                  +-tests.py                  +-views.py                  +----------- ---+                                                                                               +-__init__.py                                                +-tax_operations.py  Listing 3-26 shows two apps that contain Django custom filters in two different files - store_formay.  tf.py and tax_operations.py. Keep in mind you need to create the templatetags folder manually inside  a Django app folder and also create an __init__.py file so Python is able to import the modules from  this folder. In addition, remember apps need to be defined in Django's INSTALLED_APPS variable inside  settings.py for the custom filters to be loaded.  114   Chapter 3   Django templates  In Listing 3-26 there's another .py file - coffeehouse_filters.py - that also contains Django custom  filters. This last custom filter file is different because it's located in a generic folder called common. In order  for Django to locate a custom filter file in a generic location, you must declare it as part of the libraries  field in OPTIONS of the TEMPLATES variable in settings.py. See the first section in this chapter for detailed  instructions on using the libraries field.  Even though custom filters are generally placed into files and apps based on their functionality, this   does not restrict the usage of custom filters to certain templates. You can use custom filters on any Django  template irrespective of where custom filter are stored.  To make use of Django custom filters in Django templates you need to use of the {% load %} tag inside   Django templates, as illustrated in Listing 3-27.  Listing 3-27.  Configure Django template to load custom filters  {% load store_format_tf %} {% load store_format_t tax_operations %} {% load undercoffee from store_format_tf %}  As shown in Listing 3-27 there are various ways you can use the {% load %} tag. You can make all the  filters present in a custom file available to a template - note the lack of .py in the {% load %} tag syntax - or  inclusively multiple custom files at once. In addition, you can also selectively load certain filters using the  Python-like syntax load filter from custom_file. Keep in mind the {% load %} tag should be declared at  the top of the template.   If you find yourself using the {% load %} tag extensively, you can make custom -filters available to all      Tip  templates using the builtins field. the builtins field is part of optIons in the templates variable in settings. py. see the first section in this chapter on Django template configuration for detailed instructions on using the  builtins field.  115   CHAPTER 4  Jinja Templates in Django  In addition to Django templates, the Django framework also supports Jinja templates. Jinja is a stand-alone  template engine project1 that’s very similar to Django’s built-in template system.  However, the adoption and growth behind Jinja templates in Django projects is in part due to the design   limitations of Django templates, which have changed little to nothing since Django’s creation.  Jinja Advantages and Disadvantages  In order for you to gain a high-level perspective of Jinja templates and learn if they’re a good fit for your  Django projects, I’ll first enumerate some of the main advantages and disadvantages of Jinja templates.   Let’s start with the advantages:   	  Speed and performance.- Jinja compiles template source code to Python byte- code when it’s first loaded, so the template is only parsed once, resulting in better  runtime performance. In addition, Jinja also supports the option of ahead-of-time  compilation, which can also result in better performance.  Although speed and performance are some of the most debatable advantages  to Jinja templates, given the many factors affecting speed and performance  benchmarks  e.g., database queries load, server configuration . Generally  speaking and all things being equal, a Jinja template that does exactly the same  thing as a Django template, the Jinja version will be faster than the Django version.   It’s only fair to mention Django templates also support custom loaders with caching to improve      Note  speed and performance – as described in the previous chapter – but this requires further configuration effort   in Django.   	  Flexibility.- Jinja templates are very flexible in terms of what they can contain,  supporting concepts like macros and more Python-like constructs. While some of  these practices are discouraged in web templates, you’ll come to appreciate some of  these features that are not available or severely constrained in Django templates.  1http:  jinja.pocoo.org     Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_4  117   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   	   	  Similar to Django templates.- Jinja is actually inspired by Django templates, so  there’s a lot of common ground between the two systems. Powerful features like  template inheritance and blocks work in the same way, so there’s a smaller learning  curve to use Jinja in Django projects than you might realize. In addition, security  features  e.g., auto-escaping  are also tightly integrated into Jinja, just like they are in  Django templates.   	 Asynchronous execution.- Templates can sometimes load a lot of data or use   functions that take a long time to run, causing delays in templates that must ‘wait’  for backing tasks to finish  i.e., they’re synchronous . Jinja templates support  asynchronous execution, which allows backing tasks to run their course – without  holding-back templates – and later reconvene with templates when finished. Note  this feature requires the use of asynchronous generators,2 which is only available in  Python 3.6 or newer releases.  And now some Jinja template disadvantages:  Little to no third-party package support.- Because official Django support for Jinja  templates is relatively recent - since Django 1.8, the prior long-term-support LTS   version to Django 1.11 on which this book is based on - almost all third-party  packages  e.g., Django admin  are still designed with Django templates. This can  make it difficult to have a pure Jinja template Django project and require that Jinja  templates coexist alongside Django templates, which can in turn lead to difficulties  and confusion when template customization is required.   	 New concepts.- If you’re accustomed to Django templates, some Jinja features   require additional practice to understand and use correctly  e.g., Jinja macros, Jinja  filters . Although this shouldn’t be an issue if you’re new to Django in general, as  every concept is new and will require some practice.  Transition to Jinja Templates from Django Templates  If you’re accustomed to using Django templates, this section describes the finer details you need to be aware  of when using Jinja templates, such as what Django template knowledge you can leverage in Jinja templates,  what works differently in Jinja templates compared to Django templates, and what are new things you need  to learn that you’ll come to appreciate in Jinja templates.  If you’ve never used Django templates, you can skip to the next section on Jinja template configuration   in Django, as most of what follows is intended for experienced Django template users.  What Works the Same Way in Jinja and Django Templates Just because Jinja is an entirely different template engine doesn’t mean it’s radically different from Django’s  built-in template engine. You can expect to use the same approach for Variables and blocks, conditionals  and loops, comments, as well as spacing and special characters.  2https:  www.python.org dev peps pep-0525   118   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Variables and blocks Curly braces {} are broadly used in Jinja templates just like they’re used in Django templates. To output  a variable in Jinja you use the same {{myvariable}} syntax. Similarly, you also name blocks to inherit  snippets between templates with the {% block footer %} {% endblock %} syntax. In addition, Jinja also  uses the same Django {% extends "base.html" %} syntax to create parent child relationships between  templates.  Conditionals and loops Jinja uses the same Django syntax to create conditionals: {% if variable %}{% elif othervariable %} {% else %}{% endif %}. In addition, Jinja also uses the same for loop syntax as Django: {% for item in  listofitems %}{{item}}{% endfor %}.  Comments Jinja also uses the same comment tag as Django: { This is a template comment that isn't rendered }.  However, note Jinja uses the { } tag for both single and multiline comments.  Spacing and special characters Since Jinja templates were inspired from Django templates, Jinja uses a similar approach to dealing with  spacing and special characters. For example, things like spacing filters  e.g., center and wordwrap  and  special character handling  e.g., safe and escape filters  work the same way in Jinja templates as they do in  Django templates.  What Works Differently in Jinja Templates Compared to Django  Templates However, not everything works the same way in Jinja templates; here are some Django template techniques  you’ll need to relearn to work with Jinja templates.  Filters Although Jinja uses the same pipe  symbol to apply filters to variables, Jinja filters are technically classified  into filters and tests. In Django templates there are just filters that perform tests  e.g., divisibleby , but  in Jinja these type constructs are called tests and use the conditional syntax {% if variable is test %}  instead of the standard pipe  symbol.  In addition, Jinja filters and tests are backed by standard methods. This has the advantage that passing   arguments to Jinja filters and tests is as simple as a method call  e.g., {{variablefilesizeformat true }}   vs. the unintuitive Django filter argument syntax of using a colon and even requiring arguments to be parsed  in custom Django filters  e.g., {{variableget_digit:"1"}} .  It’s also possible to create custom Jinja filters and tests - in addition to the built-in Jinja filters and tests   that are similar to Django built-in filters. However, unlike Django filters that are loaded into templates via  the {% load %} tag, Jinja custom filters and tests are registered globally and become accessible to all Jinja  templates like Django context processors.  119   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Context processors Context processors give Django templates access to sets of variables across every template in a project, but in  Jinja this functionality is called global variables. This is one area where you’ll likely miss the Django template  functionality of simply declaring context processors and getting access to sets of variables. However, it’s  relatively easy to create Jinja global variables to become accessible on all Jinja templates and act as Django  context processors.  No date elements like the {% now %} tag and filters like time and timesince Jinja in its out-of-the-box state provides no tags or filters to work with dates or times. Although Jinja does offer  the format filter that works just like Python’s standard method and can be used for date formatting, you’ll  need to write your own custom filters and tags to deal with date and time elements in a more advanced way.  {% comment %} tag not supported Jinja uses the { } tag to define either single or multiline comments, so there’s no support for the   {% comment %}, which in Django templates is used for multiline comments.  {% load %} tag not supported In Jinja the {% load %} tag to import custom tags and filters is not supported. In Jinja custom tags and filters  are registered globally and automatically become accessible to all Jinja templates.  Use {{super  }} instead of {{block.super}} In Django templates you use the syntax {{ block.super }} to access the contents of a parent template’s  block. In Jinja you must use the {{super  }} syntax to gain access to the contents of a parent template’s block.  {% csrf_token %} tag not supported, instead use csrf_input   or csrf_token variables In Django templates when you create a form that has an HTTP POST action, you place the {% csrf_token %}  tag in its body to generate a special token that avoids XSS ‘Cross-site scripting’ . To replicate this behavior  in Jinja you must use the csrf_input variable  e.g., {{csrf_input}} that generates a string like <input  type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="4565465747487">  or use the csrf_token variable that  contains the raw CSRF token  e.g., 4565465747487 .  {% for %} loop variables In Django templates the context of {% for %} loops offers access to a series of variables  e.g., counter,  first, and last iteration . Jinja templates offer a similar variable in the context of {% for %} but they are not  identical.  120   {% empty %} tag not supported in loops, use the {% else %} tag {% for %} loops in Django templates support the {% empty %} clause as a last argument to generate logic or  a message when an iteration is empty. In Jinja {% for %} loops you can use the {% else %} clause as a last  argument to generate logic or a message when an iteration is empty.  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  {% groupby %} tag not supported, use the groupby filter Django templates support the {% groupby %} tag to rearrange dictionaries or objects based on different  attributes. In Jinja you can achieve the same functionality, but you must do it through the groupby filter as  described in the Jinja groupby filter.  {% cycle %} tag not supported, use the cycler function or the loop.cycle  variable in {% for %} loops Django templates support the {% cycle %} tag to cycle over a list of values. In Jinja this functionality is  available in two forms. You can use the cycler method if you require the functionality outside of loops.   Or you can use the loop.cycle function available in all {% for %} loops.  {% lorem %} tag not supported, use the lipsum Function Django templates support the {% lorem %} tag to generate random Latin text as filler content. In Jinja you  can achieve the same functionality with the lipsum function.  Other miscellaneous tags like {% static %}, {% trans %}, {% blocktrans %},  and {% url %} not supported A series of Django template tags like {% static %} and {% trans %} are simply not available in Jinja.  However, there are third-party projects that have ported these and many other Django template tags into  Jinja extensions. A later section in this chapter on Jinja extensions discusses these options.  New Concepts and Features in Jinja Templates vs. Django Templates Now that you know what Django template knowledge you can leverage and what techniques you’ll need  to relearn to effectively work with Jinja templates, let’s take a look at some concepts that only apply to Jinja  templates.  More useful built-in filters, tests, and more resemblance to a Python environment Jinja templates offer a variety of built-in filters and tests that are sorely missing in Django templates. For  example, for something as simple as checking variable types  e.g., string, number, iterable, etc. , Jinja offers a  series of built-in tests for this purpose, where as in Django this requires creating custom filters.  Access and manipulation of complex data types  e.g., objects and dictionaries  is also vastly improved  in Jinja templates vs. Django templates. For example, Jinja offers filters such as reject, select, and map to  prune, filter, or alter data subsets on a template, a technique that although frowned upon by purists    i.e., those who stand by only manipulating data in views  are a very common requirement in real and   time-constrained projects.  121   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Jinja templates also support syntax that is more in line with a standard Python environment. For   example, in Django something like accessing a dictionary key through a variable requires a custom  filter, where as in Jinja templates this works with standard Python syntax  e.g., if you have the variables  stores={"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}, and var="key1", Django template can’t do   stores.get var , which is standard Python syntax, but in Jinja this works out of the box as expected of a  Python environment .  Global functions Jinja also supports a series of global functions. For example, Jinja offers the range function that works  just like Python’s standard function that is useful in loops  e.g., {% for number in range 50 -  coffeeshopscount  %} . In addition, Jinja also offers the global functions lipsum to generate dummy  placeholder content, dict to generate dictionaries, cycler to generate a cycle over elements, and joiner to  join sections.  Flexible tag nesting, conditionals, and references Jinja is very flexible in terms of nesting tags, particularly compared to what’s permissible in Django  templates. For example, in Jinja you can even conditionally apply the {% extends %} tag  e.g., {% if user  %}{% extends "base.html" %}{% else %}{% extends "signup_base.html" %}{% endif %}  or also use  variable reference names with inline conditions  e.g., {% extends layout_template if layout_template  is defined else 'master.html' %}  - something that’s not possible in Django templates.  Macros In Jinja, macros allow you to define function-like snippets with complex layouts that can be called from  any template with different instance values. Macros are particularly useful to limit the spread of complex  layouts across templates. With macros you define a complex layout once  i.e., as a macro  and invoke it with  different parameters to output the complex layout customized every single time, just as if were a function.  Flexible variable assignment in templates with less restrictive scope In Jinja you can use the {% set %} tag to define variables to have a valid scope until the end of the template.  Although Jinja also supports the {% with %} tag – just like the Django template version - the {% with %}  tag can become cumbersome for multiple variable definitions because it requires closing the scope with {%  endwith %} every time. The {% set %} is a good alternative for global template variables because you only  require the initial definition and the scope propagates to the end of the template without having to worry  about closing the scope.  Line statements Jinja supports the definition of logical statements in what it calls line statements. By default, a line statement  is preceded with the  symbol and can serve as an alternative to tag syntax. For example, the {% for %} tag  statement {% for item in items %} can use the equivalent line statement  for item in items, just as  the tag statement {% endfor %} can use the equivalent line statement  endfor. Line statements, more  than anything, give templates a Python feel to them that can make complex logic easier to decipher vs. using  tag statements that require the {% %} syntax.  122   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Jinja Template Configuration in Django  The first step to use Jinja in Django is to install the core package with the command pip install Jinja2.  Note the installation is for version 2  i.e., Jinja2 , which is the most recent version. While Jinja 1 is still  available, Django does not offer built-in support for version 1, so place special attention to make sure you  install version 2.  Next, you need to configure Jinja in a Django project inside the settings.py file. Listing 4-1 illustrates a   basic Jinja configuration for Django.  Listing 4-1.  Jinja configuration in Django settings.py  import os BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND':'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',         'DIRS': ['%s jinjatemplates '%  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         },     {         'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',         'DIRS': [],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'context_processors': [                 'django.template.context_processors.debug',                 'django.template.context_processors.request',                 'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',                 'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',             ],         },     }, ]  As you can see in Listing 4-1, there are two configurations declared in TEMPLATES, a dictionary for   Jinja template configuration and another dictionary with the default Django template configuration. Since  Django templates are still used by things like the Django admin and many third-party packages, I highly  recommended you use the base configuration in Listing 4-1 since it keeps other things you don’t have  template control over from breaking.  The Jinja configuration in Listing 4-1 is one of the most basic possible. In this case, the BACKEND variable   uses the django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2 value to activate Jinja templates, and is followed  immediately with the DIRS and APP_DIRS variables, which tell Django where to locate Jinja templates.  Template Search Paths The APP_DIRS variable permits the lookup of templates inside special app subdirectories named jinja2.  This is helpful if you wish to contain Jinja templates to apps, but be aware the template search path is not  aware of app namespaces. For example, if you have two apps that both rely on a template named index.html  - as illustrated in Listing 4-2 - and both apps have a method in views.py that returns control to the    123   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  index.html template  e.g., render request,'index.html'  , both apps will use the index.html from the  topmost declared app in INSTALLED_APPS, so one app won’t use the expected index.html.

In this manner, you can then redirect control to a template using this additional namespace subfolder  to avoid any ambiguity. So to send control to the about index.html template you would declare  render request,'about index.html'  and to send control to the stores index.html you would declare  render request,'about index.html' .  If you wish to disallow this behavior of allowing templates to be loaded from these internal app   subfolders, you can do so by setting APP_DIRS to FALSE.  A more common approach for Jinja templates is to have a single folder or various folders - that live   outside app structures - to hold Jinja templates. Django first looks for a matching Jinja template in the first  DIRS value and then in jinja2 folders in apps – if APP_DIRS is TRUE – until it either finds a matching template  or throws a TemplateDoesNotExist error.  For the case illustrated in Listing 4-1, the only DIRS value relies on a directory named jinjatemplates   relative to a path determined by the PROJECT_DIR variable. This variable technique is helpful when deploying  a Django project across different machines, because the path is relative to the top-level Django project  directory  i.e., where the settings.py and main urls.py file are  and adjusts dynamically irrespective of  where a Django project is installed  e.g.,  var www ,  opt website, C:  website  .  Similar to the Django template OPTIONS variable, Jinja also supports a series of customizations through   the OPTIONS variable. In the case of Jinja, the OPTIONS variable is a dictionary of key-values that correspond to  Jinja environment initialization parameters.3  By default, Django internally sets a series of Jinja environment initialization parameters to align Jinja’s  template behavior with that of Django templates. However, you can easily override these settings with the  OPTIONS variable. The next sections describe these important settings.  Auto-Escaping Behavior Django enables Jinja template auto-escaping by default, a behavior that’s actually disabled in the Jinja  engine in its out-of-the-box state. The crux of auto-escaping is that, on the one hand it errs on the side of  precaution and security - limiting the possibility to mangle output or introduce XSS  Cross-site scripting   vulnerabilities in HTML – but on the other hand, it also introduces extra processing in the template engine  that can cause performance problems.  By default, Django templates auto-escape all output from template variables –    is converted to &gt;, '  single quote  is converted to &39;, "  double quote  is converted to &quot; and & is  converted to &amp – unless you explicitly disable this behavior. Jinja in its out-of-the-box state doesn’t auto- escape anything, and you need to explicitly tell it when you want to auto-escape something.  Because the Jinja template integration for Django was done by Django designers, Jinja auto-escaping is  enabled, to err on the side of security, just like it’s for Django templates. However, you can disable Jinja auto- escaping with the autoescape parameter in OPTIONS as illustrated in Listing 4-3.  3http:  jinja.pocoo.org docs dev api jinja2.Environment  125   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Listing 4-3.  Jinja disable auto-escaping in Django  import os BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND':'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',         'DIRS': ['%s jinjatemplates '%  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'autoescape': False         },     } ]  As you can see in Listing 4-3, autoescape is assigned False and with this change Jinja templates behave   just as Jinja designers intended  i.e., you need to explicitly check where auto-escaping is necessary vs. the  Django template way to check where auto-escaping isn’t necessary .  Auto-Reload Template Behavior and Caching In its out-of-the-box state, Jinja’s template loader checks every time a template is requested to see if the  source has changed; if it has changed, Jinja reloads the template. This can be helpful in development where  a template’s source changes constantly, but can also translate into a performance hit in production where a  template’s source rarely changes and the check incurs a delay.  By default, the Django framework Jinja integration takes a sensible approach and enables Jinja   template auto-reloading based on the DEBUG variable in settings.py. If DEBUG=True - a common setting  in development - Jinja template auto-reloading is set to True and if DEBUG=False - a common setting in  production - Jinja template auto-reloading is set to False. Nevertheless, you can explicitly set Jinja’s   auto-loading behavior with the auto_reload parameter in OPTIONS.  The Jinja engine by default also caches up to 400 templates. This means that when template 401 is   loaded, Jinja cleans out the least recently used template, the latter of which must be reloaded from its origin  again if required at a later time. The Jinja cache limit can be adjusted with the cache_size parameter in  OPTIONS  e.g., cache_size=1000, to set a 1000 template cache . Setting cache_size to 0  zero  disables  caching and setting cache_size to -1 enables unlimited caching.  Another caching mechanism available in Jinja templates is byte-code caching. When you create Python   source files  i.e., those with .py extensions , Python produces mirror-like files with .pyc extensions that  contain byte-code. Generating these byte-code files takes time, but they’re a natural part of Python’s runtime  process. Jinja templates being based on Python also need to be turned into byte-code, but it’s a process you  can customize with the bytecode_cache parameter in OPTIONS.  The bytecode_cache parameter can be assigned either a custom byte-cache4 or one of Jinja’s built-in   byte-code caches, which include support for standard file-system caching or more specialized caching with  memcached.  4http:  jinja.pocoo.org docs 2.9 api bytecode-cache  126   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Invalid Template Variables You can set various behaviors when an invalid variable is encountered in Jinja templates. Django sets Jinja  with two default behaviors, one for when DEBUG=True - a common setting in development - and the other for  when DEBUG=False - a common setting in production.  If DEBUG=True and an invalid variable is set in a Jinja template, Jinja uses the jinja2.DebugUndefined   class to process it. The jinja2.DebugUndefined class outputs the variable verbatim for rendering  e.g., if  the template has the {{foo}} statement and the variable doesn’t exist in the context, Jinja outputs {{foo}},  making it easier to spot an invalid variable .  If DEBUG=False and an invalid variable is set in a Jinja template, Jinja uses the jinja2.Undefined class   to process it. The jinja2.Undefined class outputs a blank space in the position of the variable for rendering   e.g., if the template has the {{bar}} statement and the variable doesn’t exist in the context, Jinja outputs a  blank space . It’s worth mentioning this last behavior aligns with the default behavior of invalid variables in  Django templates.  In addition to the jinja2.DebugUndefined and jinja2.Undefined classes, Jinja also supports the   jinja2.StrictUndefined class. The jinja2.StrictUndefined class is used to generate an immediate error  instead of proceeding with rendering, which is helpful for quicker diagnosis of invalid variables. However, be  aware this last class changes its behavior based on the DEBUG variable; it either generates a stack error with  the invalid variable name  i.e., when DEBUG=True  or it generates a standard HTTP 500 error page  i.e., when  DEBUG=False .  Listing 4-4 illustrates how to configure a Jinja class to handle invalid variables through the OPTIONS   parameter in settings.py.  Listing 4-4.  Generate error for invalid variables in Jinja with jinja2.StrictUndefined  import os BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    import jinja2  TEMPLATES = [    {         'BACKEND':'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',         'DIRS': ['%s jinjatemplates '%  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'undefined':jinja2.StrictUndefined         },     } ]  As you can see in Listing 4-4, we first declare import jinja2 to gain access to Jinja’s classes in   settings.py. Next, we declare the undefined key inside the OPTIONS parameter and assign it the Jinja class  to process invalid variables. In this case, we use the jinja2.StrictUndefined class to get errors when  invalid templates variables are encountered, but you could equally use any of the other two Jinja classes to  handle invalid variables  i.e., jinja2.DebugUndefined or jinja2.Undefined .  127   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Template Loaders Jinja template loaders are Python classes that implement the actual logic required to search and load  templates. Earlier in the section “Template Search Paths,” I described how Jinja searches for templates using  the DIRS and APP_DIRS variables, which are part of Django’s template configuration. However, I intentionally  omitted a deeper aspect associated with this template search process: each search mechanism is backed by  a template loader.  In most circumstances, you won’t need to deal with Jinja template loaders, since Jinja loaders are taken  care of in the background by simply relying on the DIRS and APP_DIRS variables. But if you need to load Jinja  templates from somewhere else than these locations  e.g., from an in-memory structure or a database , you  can specify template loaders with the loader key inside the OPTIONS parameter.  Like Django template loaders, Jinja also offers the ability to create custom template loaders,5 in addition   to using built-in Jinja template loaders similar to those offered by Django template  e.g., loading templates  from a Python dictionary .     Tip   You can set custom values for any Jinja environment initialization parameter6 in optIons. the prior  sections are just four of the most common Jinja template parameters; later sections describe other available  optIons.   optIons is only intended for Jinja environment initialization parameters; other Jinja environment      Note  settings require configuring a separate Jinja environment class  e.g., Jinja globals, Jinja custom filters and  tests, and Jinja policies .  Create Reusable Jinja Templates  Templates tend to have common sections that are equally used across multiple instances. For example,  the header and footer sections on all templates rarely change, whether a project has 5 or 100 templates.  Other template sections like menus and advertisements also fall into this category of content that’s constant  across multiple templates. All of this can lead to repetition over multiple templates, which can be avoided by  creating reusable templates.  With reusable Jinja templates you can define common sections on separate templates and reuse them   inside other templates. This process makes it easy to create and manage a project’s templates because a  single template update takes effect on all templates.  Reusable Jinja templates also allow you to define page blocks to override content on a page-by-page   basis. This process makes a project’s templates more modular because you define top-level blocks to  establish the overall layout and define content on a page-by-page basis.  5http:  jinja.pocoo.org docs 2.9 api loaders 6http:  jinja.pocoo.org docs dev api jinja2.Environment  128   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Let’s take the first step toward building reusable Jinja templates by exploring Jinja’s built-in {% block %}   tag. Listing 4-5 illustrates the first lines of a template called base.html with several {% block %} tags.  Listing 4-5.  Jinja template with {% block %} tags                     {% block title%}Default title{% endblock title %}               Notice the syntax {% block  %}{% endblock  %} in Listing 4-5. Each {% block %} tag has a   reference name. The reference name is used by other Jinja templates to override the content for each block.  For example, the {% block title %} tag within the HTML   tags defines a web page title. If another  template reuses the template in Listing 4-5, it can define its own web page title by overriding the title block. If  a block is not overridden on a template, the block receives the default content within the block. For the title  block the default content is Default title, for the metadescription and metakeywords blocks the default  content is an empty string.  The same mechanism illustrated in Listing 4-5 can be used to define any number of blocks  e.g., content,   menu, header, footer . It’s worth mentioning the   argument of {% endblock   %} is optional  and it’s valid to just use {% endblock %} to close a block statement; however, the former technique makes it  clearer where a block statement ends, which is especially helpful when a template has multiple blocks.  Although it’s possible to call the template in Listing 4-5 directly by a Django view method or url request,   the purpose of this kind of template is to use it as a base template for other templates. To reuse a Jinja  template you use the Jinja built-in {% extends %} tag.  The {% extends %} tag uses the syntax {% extends   %} to reuse the layout of another template.  This means that in order to reuse the layout in Listing 4-5 defined in a file base.html, you use the syntax {%  extends "base.html" %}, as illustrated in Listing 4-6.  Listing 4-6.  Jinja template with {% extends %} and {% block %} tag  {% if user %}{% extends "base.html" %}{% else %}{% extends "signup_base.html" %}{% endif %} {% block title %}Coffeehouse home page{% endblock %}  Look how Listing 4-6 uses the {% extends "base.html" %} wrapped around the {% if user %}   statement. If the user variable is defined, Jinja extends the base.html template; otherwise it extends the  signup_base.html template. This conditional syntax is not possible in Django templates.  In addition, notice how Listing 4-6 defines the {% block title %} tag with the content Coffeehouse   home page. The block in Listing 4-6 overrides the title block from the base.html template. So where are the  HTML   tags in Listing 4-6? There aren’t any and you don’t need them. Jinja automatically reuses the  layout from either the base.html or signup_base.html templates and substitutes the blocks’ content where  necessary.  Jinja templates that reuse other templates tend to have limited layout elements  e.g., HTML tags  and  more Jinja block statements to override content. This is beneficial because, as I outlined previously, it lets  you establish the overall layout once and define content on a page-by-page basis.  The reusability of Jinja templates can occur multiple times. For example, you can have templates A, B,  and C, where B requires the reuse A, but C requires the reuse of parts of B. The only difference is template C  needs to use the {% extends "B" %} tag instead of the {% extends "A"%} tag. But since template B reuses A,  template C also has access to the same elements in template A.  129   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  When reusing Jinja templates, it’s also possible to access the block content from a parent template. Jinja  exposes the block content from a parent template through the super   method. Listing 4-7 illustrates three  templates that show this mechanism for a block containing web page paths or ‘breadcrumbs’.  Listing 4-7.  Jinja templates use of super   with three reusable templates   base.html template  {% block breadcrumb %}Home{% endblock %}    index.html template {% extends "base.html" %} {% block breadcrumb %}Main{% endblock %}   detail.html template {% extends "index.html" %} {% block breadcrumb %} {{super  }} : Detail {% endblock %}  The base.html template in Listing 4-7 defines the breadcrumb block with a default value of Home. Next,   the index.html template reuses the base.html template and overrides the breadcrumb block with a value of  Main. Finally, the detail.html template reuses the index.html template and overrides the breadcrumb block  value. However, notice the {{super  }} statement in the final block override. Since {{super  }} is inside  the breadcrumb block, {{super  }} tells Jinja to get the content from the parent template block.  Another reusability functionality supported by Jinja templates is the inclusion of a Jinja template inside   another Jinja template. Jinja supports this functionality through the {% include %} tag.  By default, the {% include %} tag expects the name of a template. For example,    {% include "footer.html" %} inserts the contents of the footer.html template in the position of the  template where it’s declared. The {% include %} tag also makes the underlying template aware of variables.  This means the footer.html template can have variable definitions  e.g., {{year}}  and if the calling  template has these variable definitions, the {% include %} tag automatically substitutes these values.  In addition, it’s possible to provide a list of templates as a fallback mechanism. For example,    {% include ['special_sidebar.html', 'sidebar.html'] ignore missing %} tells Jinja to first   attempt to locate the special_sidebar.html template and if it isn’t found to attempt to locate the   sidebar.html template; if neither template is found the last argument ignore missing tells Jinja to render  nothing. Note the ignore missing argument can also be used in individual statements  e.g., {% include  "footer.html" ignore missing %}, as well as lists . In addition, if the ignore missing statement is not  used and Jinja can’t find a matching template declared in {% include %}, Jinja raises an exception.  The {% macro %} tag allows the definition of reusable content snippets across templates. For example,  if you need to incorporate elaborate markup to display elements that have common characteristics, you can  define the elaborate markup once in a {% macro %} statement and then reuse this {% macro %} to output the  markup customized to each element instance.  Macros are helpful because if you decide to change the markup, you only need to change it in a single   location and the changes propagate to other locations. Listing 4-8 illustrates the definition of a {% macro %}  statement and its usage in templates.  Listing 4-8.  Jinja {% macro %} definition and use of {% import %}   base.html template {% macro coffeestore name, id='', address='', city='San Diego', state='CA', email=None  -%}             {{name}}       {{address}} {{city}},{{state}}      {% if email %}  {{email}}  {% endif %} {%- endmacro %} 130   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   index.html template calls inherited macro directly {% extends "base.html" %} {{coffeestore 'Downtown',1,'Horton Plaza','San Diego','CA','downtown@coffeehouse.com' }}   detail.html template with no extends, uses {% import %} to access macro in base.html {% import 'base.html' as base %} {{base.coffeestore 'Downtown',1,'Horton Plaza','San Diego','CA','downtown@coffeehouse.com' }}   otherdetail.html template with no extends, uses {% from import %} to access macro in base.html {% from 'base.html' import coffeestore as mycoffeestoremacro %} {{mycoffeestoremacro 'Downtown',1,'Horton Plaza','San Diego','CA','downtown@coffeehouse.com' }}  The first thing that’s done in Listing 4-8 is the {% macro %} definition declared in the base.html  template. Notice that after the {% macro snippet, there’s what appears to be a regular method named  coffeestore, which corresponds to the name of the macro with six input arguments, five of which have  default values. Next, inside the {% macro %} and {% endmacro %} statements you can see some elaborate  HTML markup that makes use of the standard {{ }} syntax to output whatever variable values are passed on  a given instance of the macro.  Since the {% macro %} in Listing 4-8 is defined inside the base.html template, any other template that   uses the base.html template can access the macro and call the macro with an instance  e.g., {{coffeestore   'Downtown',1,'Horton Plaza','San Diego','CA','downtown@coffeehouse.com' }} - hard-coded values  for simplicity  for Jinja to render the HTML markup customized with the instance values.  If you want to access a {% macro %} in other templates you have three alternatives that are also presented  in Listing 4-8. If a template extends another template  e.g., {% extends "base.html" %}  then by default it will  also gain access to the parent’s template {% macro %} definitions. It’s also possible to access another template’s  {% macro %} definitions with the {% import %} statement. For example, the statement {% import 'base.html'  as base %} imports the base.html definitions into another template with the base namespace, in which case  to invoke the {% macro %} called coffeestore you would use the {{base.coffeestore ...}} syntax. Finally,  it’s also possible to selectively import a {% macro %} definition with the {% from import %} statement. For  example, the statement {% from 'base.html' import coffeestore as mycoffeestoremacro %} imports the  coffeestore definition from the base.html template and places it under the mycoffeestoremacro name, in  which case you would use the {{mycoffeehousemacro ...}} syntax to invoke the {% macro %}.  The {% call %} tag is another option that, used in conjunction with the {% macro %} tags, favors the  reusability of macros themselves. The first usage scenario of the {% call %} tag is to invoke a {% macro %}  that requires a placeholder for content that’s defined until the invocation of the macro. Listing 4-9 illustrates  this basic scenario of the {% call %} tag along with a {% macro %}.  Listing 4-9.  Jinja {% call %} and {% macro %} use   macro definition {% macro contentlist adcolumn_width=3,contentcolumn_width=6  -%}          Sidebar ads                 {{ caller   }}               Sidebar ads      {%- endmacro %}  131   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   macro call invocation {% call contentlist   %}          This is my list      {% endcall %}   rendering       Sidebar ads              This is my list              Sidebar ads    In Listing 4-9 we first define a {% macro %} with a similar structure to that of Listing 4-8; however, notice  inside the {% macro %} the {{ caller   }} statement. The caller   method inside {% macro %} serves as  placeholder to be substituted by the calling entity.  Next, in Listing 4-9 you can see the {% call %} statement is declared with the macro call - in this   case contentlist   - and the body of the {% call %} statement contains an HTML list. When Jinja  executes the {% call %} statement, the {% call %} contents are placed in the location of the {% macro %}  {{caller  }} declaration.  A more advanced scenario of the {% call %} tag with a {% macro %} is for the caller   statement to  use references, a process that’s more natural to data that’s recursive in nature  i.e., a macro over a macro .  Listing 4-10 illustrates this recursive scenario of the {% call %} tag along with a {% macro %}.  Listing 4-10.  Jinja {% call %} and {% macro %} recursive calls   macro definition {% macro contentlist itemlist,adcolumn_width=3,contentcolumn_width=6  -%}          Sidebar ads                {% for item in itemlist %}       {{ caller item  }}      {% endfor %}               Sidebar ads      {%- endmacro %}  132   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   variable definition {% set coffeestores=[{'id':0,'name':'Corporate','address':'624 Broadway','city':'San Diego', 'state':'CA','email':'corporate@coffeehouse.com'},{'id':1,'name':'Downtown','address':'Hort on Plaza','city':'San Diego','state':'CA','email':'downtown@coffeehouse.com'},{'id':2,'name ':'Uptown','address':'1240 University Ave','city':'San Diego','state':'CA','email':'uptown@ coffeehouse.com'},{'id':3,'name':'Midtown','address':'784 W Washington St','city':'San Diego ','state':'CA','email':'midtown@coffeehouse.com'}] %}   macro call invocation {% call item  contentlist coffeestores  %}             {{item.name}}       {{item.address}} {{item.city}},{{item.state}}      {% if item.email %}  {{item.email}}  {% endif %} {% endcall %}   rendering       Sidebar ads                 Corporate       624 Broadway San Diego,CA        corporate@coffeehouse.com                Downtown       Horton Plaza San Diego,CA        downtown@coffeehouse.com                Uptown       1240 University Ave San Diego,CA        uptown@coffeehouse.com                Midtown       784 W Washington St San Diego,CA        midtown@coffeehouse.com           Sidebar ads    As you can see in Listing 4-10, the {% macro %} definition now has an argument called itemlist on   which it creates an iteration and for each item it invokes {{caller item }}. Also notice in Listing 4-10 the  {% call %} statement is now {% call item  contentlist coffeestores  %}, where item represents the  callback item sent from the macro and contentlist coffeestores  is the actual call to the macro named  contentlist along with its input coffeestores that’s a list of dictionaries. When Jinja executes the {% call  %} statement, the {% call %} contents are run recursively over each item, resulting in the output presented  at the bottom of Listing 4-10.  133   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   the built-in {% set %} statement – described in the Jinja built-in filters section – provides simpler      Tip  reuse functionality for static content blocks compared to {% macro %} statements that use variables.  e.g.,  {% set advertisement %}   {% endset %} creates the advertisement  variable that can output the contents between {% set %} and {% endset %} anywhere in a template .  Jinja Globals: Access Data on All Jinja Templates, Like  Django Context Processors  Just like Django templates offer context processors to facilitate the access of data on all Django templates,  Jinja also offers its own version of the same feature that is called globals. Jinja in its out-of-the-box state  has no globals, but in its Django integrated mode includes three globals to mimic Django’s most common  context processors, these globals are request, csrf_input, and csrf_token.  This means you get access to three Django context processors like variables in all Jinja templates used in   Django projects. However, to set up additional global variables you need to work with Jinja’s environment. To set up Jinja globals you need to access Jinja’s environment, which is where globals are stored, in a   variable properly called globals. By default, the Django-Jinja configuration uses Jinja’s built-in jinja2. Environment environment. In order to access Jinja’s environment in Django and set globals, the easiest path  is to create your own Jinja environment and use it to initialize the Django-Jinja configuration. Listing 4-11  illustrates a custom Jinja environment class that sets the global variables named static and url.  Listing 4-11.  Custom Jinja environment with global variable  from jinja2.environment import Environment from django.contrib.staticfiles.storage import staticfiles_storage from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse  class JinjaEnvironment Environment :     def __init__ self,**kwargs :         super JinjaEnvironment, self .__init__ **kwargs          self.globals['static'] = staticfiles_storage.url         self.globals['reverse'] = reverse  As you can see in Listing 4-11, the custom JinjaEnvironment class is a subclass of the jinja2.  Environment class; this is so the custom class inherits the bulk of its features from this base class provided by  Jinja. Next, you can see we use the __init__ method to initialize the base class.  Prior to exiting the initialization method of the class, you can also see we access the globals variable   of the instance. globals is composed of a dictionary, where the key-values correspond to the Jinja template  variable names and values, respectively. In this case, we create the static variable and assign it Django’s  django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.staticfiles_storage.url method. This gives the static global  variable the same behavior as Django’s staticfiles app, so that it’s possible to declare static resources just  like it’s done in Django  e.g., Jinja can then do <img src="{{ static 'images background.png'  }}"  alt="Background">  – a topic that is described in greater detail in Chapter 5 on static resource management,  but this is important to mention here due to the gap it fills in Jinja lacking functionality on this front.  The second global in Listing 4-11 creates the url variable and assigns it Django’s    django.core.urlresolvers.reverse method. This gives the url global variable the same behavior as  Django’s {% url %} tag, so that it’s possible to resolve a URL based on a name - as described in Chapter 2 on   Django url management and reverse matches - just like it’s done in Django  e.g., Jinja can then do    134   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   Go to homepage   - note this is another important gap to fill given  Jinja’s lack of functionality on this front.  Just as you can add these last two global variables to mimic the behavior of Django apps and tags that   are missing in Jinja templates, you can add more globals in the same manner or increase the complexity of a  Jinja global as needed.  Once the custom Jinja environment is ready, you need to set it up in Django’s settings.py file so it’s   used to initialize Jinja. Listing 4-12 illustrates how to set up a custom Jinja environment in Django.  Listing 4-12.  Configure custom Jinja environment in Django setttings.py  TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND':'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',         'DIRS': ['%s templates '%  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'environment': 'coffeehouse.jinja.env.JinjaEnvironment'             }         },     ]  The Jinja environment is set through the environment key, as part of the OPTIONS variable. The value   of the environment key is a string with dot notation that points to a custom Jinja environment class. In  this case, you can see the value corresponds to coffeehouse.jinja.env.JinjaEnvironment, where  JinjaEnvironment is the class, env is the file module name, and coffeehouse.jinja is the directory path.  To better illustrate the location of the env.py file containing the custom Jinja environment, Listing 4-13   illustrates a directory structure with additional Django project files for reference.  Listing 4-13.  Directory structure and location of custom Jinja environment  +---+-           +-__init__.py     +-settings.py     +-urls.py     +-wsgi.py          +-jinja-+             +-__init__.py             +-env.py  Jinja Built-In Statements Tags and Functions  Like Django  Template Tags   Jinja offers several built-in statements tags that offer immediate access to elaborate operations on Jinja  templates. I’ll classify each of these built-in statements tags and functions into sections so it’s easier  to identify them; note I’ll add the reference  Function  to indicate it’s referring to a Jinja function. The  categories I’ll use are Comparison operations, loops, Python and filter operations, spacing and special  characters, and template structures.  135   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Comparison Operations  {% if %} with {% elif %} {% else %}.- The {% if %} statement is the primary  building block to evaluate conditions. The {% if %} statement is typically used in  conjunction with the {% elif %} and {% else %} statements to evaluate more than  one condition. An {% if %} statement with an argument variable evaluates to true  if a variable exists and is not empty or if the variable holds a True Boolean value.  Listing 4-14 illustrates a series of {% if %} statement examples.  Listing 4-14.  Jinja {% if %} statement with {% elif %} and {% else %}  {% if drinks %}             {% if drinks %}              {% if drinks %}   We have drinks!                We have drinks              We have drinks {% endif %}                 {% else %}                   {% elif drinks_on_sale %}                                 No drinks,sorry              We have drinks on sale!                             {% endif %}                  {% else %}                                                              No drinks, sorry                                                          {% endif %}   a variable must both exist and not be empty to match a condition. a variable that just exists and is      Note  empty does not match a condition.  {% if %} with and, or and not operators.- The {% if %} statement also supports  the and, or, and not operators to create more elaborate conditions. These operators  allow you to compare if more than one variable is not empty  e.g., {% if drinks and  drinks_on_sale %} , if one or another variable is not empty  e.g., {% if drinks or  drinks_on_sale %}  or if a variable is empty  e.g., {% if not drinks %} .  {% if %} with ==, !=,  ,  = operators.- The {% if %} statement also  supports equal, not equal, larger than, and less than operators to create conditions  that compare variables to fixed strings or numbers. These operators allow you to  compare if a variable equals a string or number  e.g., {% if drink == "mocha" %} ,  if a variable does not equal a variable or number  e.g.{% if store_id != 2 %}  or if  a variable is greater than or lesser than a number  e.g., {% if store_id > 5 %} .  {% if   in %} and {% if   not in %}.- The {% if %} statement  also supports the in and not in operators to verify the presence of a constant or  variable. For example, {% if "mocha" in drinks %} tests if the value "mocha" is in  the drinks list variable or {% if 2 not in stores %} tests if the value 2 is not in the  stores list variable. Although the in and not in operators are commonly used to  test list variables, it’s also possible to test the presence of characters on strings  e.g.,  {% if "m" in drink %} . In addition, it’s also possible to compare if the value of  one variable is present in another variable  e.g., {% if order_drink in drinks %} .   	   	   	   	  136   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Loops  	  {% for %} and {% for %} with {% else %}.- The {% for %} statement iterates over  items on a dictionary, list, tuple, or string variable. The {% for %} statement syntax  is {% for   in   %}, where   is assigned a new  value from   on each iteration. Depending on the nature of a variable  there can be one or more references  e.g., for a list one reference, for a dictionary two  references .The {% for %} statement also supports the {% else %} statement which  is processed in case there are no iterations in a loop  i.e., the main variable is empty .  Listing 4-15 illustrates a {% for %} and a {% for %} and {% else %} loop example.  Listing 4-15.  Jinja {% for %} statement and {% for %} with {% else %}                                       {% for drink in drinks %}              {% for storeid,store in stores %}   {{ drink.name }}                   {{store.name}}      {% else %}                             {% endfor %}   No drinks, sorry               {% endfor %}    The {% for %} statement also generates a series of variables to manage the iteration process such as an   iteration counter, a first iteration flag, and a last iteration flag. Table 4-1 illustrates the {% for %} statement  variables.  Table 4-1.  Jinja {% for %} statement variables  Variable  Description  loop.index loop.index0 loop.revindex loop.revindex0 loop.first loop.last loop.length loop.cycle loop.depth  The current iteration of the loop  1-indexed . The current iteration of the loop  0-indexed . The number of iterations from the end of the loop  1-indexed . The number of iterations from the end of the loop  0-indexed . True if it's the first time through the loop. True if it's the last time through the loop. The number of items in the sequence. A helper function to cycle between a list of sequences. Indicates how deep in a recursive loop the rendering currently is, starts at level 1  loop.depth0  Indicates how deep in a recursive loop the rendering currently is, starts at level 0.  137   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  NESTED JINJA LOOPS: USE REFERENCE VARIABLE    AND CYCLE VARIABLE  on certain occasions you may need to nest multiple {% for %} statements and access parent loop  items. In Django templates, this is easy because there’s a variable for just this purpose. however, Jinja  templates don’t have this variable as you can see in table 4-1. a solution in Jinja templates is to define  a reference variable with {% set %} before entering the child loop to gain access to the parent loop, as  illustrated in the following snippet.    {% for chapter in chapters %}   {% set chapterloop = loop %}   {% for section in chapter %}       {{ chapterloop.index }}.{{ loop.index }}">{{ section }}    {% endfor %} {% endfor %}    another nested loop feature in Jinja templates is cycle, which does not exist in Django templates  as a  variable at least, it does exist as a tag . the primary use of cycle is to define Css classes so that each  iteration receives a different Css class and upon rendering each iteration is displayed in a different  color. the following snippet illustrates the use of the cycle variable.  {% for drink in drinks %}   {{ drink.name }}  {% endfor %}  note cycle can iterate sequentially over any number of strings or variables  e.g., {{ loop.cycle 'red'  'white' 'blue'  }} .   	   	  {% for %} with if.- The {% for %} statement also supports the inclusion of if  statements to filter the iteration over a dictionary, list, tuple, or string variable. In  this manner you can limit the iteration to elements that pass or fail a certain criteria.  The {% for %} statement syntax with an if clause is {% for   in    if  %}  e.g., {% for drink in drinks if drink  not in ['Cappuccino'] %}    {% for %} with recursive keyword.- The {% for %} statement also supports  recursion over nested dictionaries, lists, tuples, or string variables. Instead of  creating multiple nested {% for %} statements, you can use recursion to reuse the  same layout over each of the nested structures. Listing 4-16 illustrates a sample of a  recursive loop in Jinja.  Listing 4-16.  Jinja {% for %} statement with recursive keyword   Dictionary definition coffees={     'espresso':          {'nothing else':'Espresso',  138   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango            'water': 'Americano',           'steamed milk': {'more steamed milk than milk foam': 'Latte',                            'chocolate syrup': {'Whipped cream': 'Mocha'}            },            'more milk foam than steamed milk': 'Capuccino'      } }   Template definition with for and recursive {% for ingredient,result in coffees.iteritems   recursive %}      {{ ingredient }}     {% if result is mapping %}          {{ loop result.iteritems    }}      {% else %}          YOU GET:  {{ result }}     {% endif %}  {% endfor %}   Output espresso      water YOU GET: Americano      steamed milk           more steamed milk than milk foam YOU GET: Latte           chocolate syrup                Whipped cream YOU GET: Mocha      more milk foam than steamed milk YOU GET: Capuccino      nothing else YOU GET: Espresso   	   	   	  {% break %} and {% continue %}.- The {% break %} and {% continue %}  statements are available inside {% for %} statements and allow you to break out of  the loop or continue to the next iteration, just like the same keywords available in  regular Python loops.   {% break %} and {% continue %} require enabling the built-in jinja2.ext.loopcontrols extension. see      Note  the second to last section in this chapter on how to enable Jinja extensions for more details.  range  Function .- The range function works just like Python’s standard function  and is useful when you want to generate a loop over a given range of numbers from  i to j-1. For example, range 0,5  generates the range [0,1,2,3,4]. In addition, the  range function also supports overriding the step count --- which defaults to 1 --- in  the third position  e.g., range 0,11,2  generates [0,2,4,6,8,10] .  cycler  Function  .- The cycler function lets you cycle among a series of values. It  works just like the loop.cycle variable available in {% for %} loops, except the cycler  function can be used outside loops. The cycler function uses its next   method  to advance one item, the reset   method to cycle to the first item and the current  attribute to return the current item. Listing 4-17 illustrates a cycler method definition  with CSS classes, which is then used over multiple {% for %} loops to define a list  where each item is assigned a different CSS class based on the cycle iteration.  139   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Listing 4-17.  Jinja cycler function  {% set row_class = cycler 'white','lightgrey','grey'  %}    {% for item in items %}    {{ item }}  {% endfor %} {% for otheritem in moreitems %}    {{ otheritem }}  {% endfor %}   Output      Item 1     Item 2      Item 3      Item 4     Item 5     Other item 1     Other item 2      	  joiner  Function .- The joiner function lets you join a series of disparate sections  and join them with a given separator, which defaults to a comma-space  ", " . A  characteristic of the joiner function is that it returns the separator string every time  it’s called, except the first time to give the correct appearance in case sections are  dependent on a condition. Listing 4-18 illustrates a joiner method definition with a  slash-space  "  "  as its separator, which is then used to join a list of sections.  Listing 4-18.  Jinja joiner function  {% set slash_joiner = joiner "  "  %}  User: {% if username %} {{ slash_joiner   }}     {{username}} {% endif %} {% if alias %} {{ slash_joiner   }}     {{alias}} {% endif %} {% if nickname %} {{ slash_joiner   }}     {{nickname}} {% endif %}   Output  If all variables are defined User: username   alias   nickname  If only nickname is defined User: nickname  If only username and alias is defined User: username   alias  Etc, the joiner function avoids any unnecessary preceding slash because it doesn't print  anything the first time its called  140   Python and Filter Operations  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  {% set %}.- The {% set %} statement lets you define variables in the context of Jinja  templates. It’s useful when you need to create variables for values that aren’t exposed  by a Django view method or when a variable is tied to a heavyweight operation. The  following is a sample statement of this statement {% set drinkwithtax=drink. cost*1.07 %}. The scope of a variable defined in a {% set %} statement is from its  declaration until the end of the template.  The {% set %} statement can also define content blocks. For example, the statement  {% set advertisement %}     {% endset %}, creates the variable advertisement with the content enclosed  between {% set %} and {% endset %} that can later be reused in other parts of a  template  e.g., {{advertisement}} . The built-in {% macro %} statement – described  in the template structures section – provide more advanced reuse functionality for  content blocks.  {% do %}  This statement requires enabling the built-in jinja2.ext.do extension; see  the section Enable Jinja extensions for more details .- The {% do %} statement is  an expression evaluator that works like the {{ }} variable syntax, except it doesn’t  produce output. For example, to increment the value of a variable or add a new  element without producing any output, you can use the {% do %} statement    e.g.,{% do itemlist.append 'Forgot to add this other item'  %} .   {% break %} and {% continue %} require enabling the built-in jinja2.ext.loopcontrols extension. see      Note  the second to last section in this chapter on how to enable Jinja extensions for more details.  {% with %}.- The {% with %} statement is similar to the {% set %} statement; the  only difference is the {% with %} statement limits the scope of a variable with the {%  endwith %} statement  e.g., {% with myvar=1 %}...{% endwith %} any elements  declared in ... have access to the myvar variable . It’s also valid to declare {% set %}  statements within {% with %} and {% endwith %} statements to limit the scope of  variables  e.g., {% with %}{% set myvar=1 %}...{% endwith %} .   {% with %} requires enabling the built-in jinja2.ext.with_ extension. see the second to last section in      Note  this chapter on how to enable Jinja extensions for more details.  {% filter %}.- The {% filter %} statement is used to apply Jinja filters to template  sections. By default, Jinja filters are applied individually to template variables, but  sometimes it can be helpful to apply Jinja filters to entire template sections. For  example, if you declare {% filter lower %} the lower filter is applied to all content  between this statement and the {% endfilter %} statement - note the lower filter  statement converts all content to lowercase; the next major section in this chapter  describes Jinja's built-in filters.  dict  Function .- The dict function offers an alternative to define dictionaries  without literals  e.g., {'id':1} is equivalent to dict id=1  .  141   	   	   	   	   	   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Spacing and Special Characters By default, Jinja keeps all spacing  e.g., tabs, spaces, newlines  unchanged from how they are defined in a  template. Figure 4-1 illustrates the default rendering of a template snippet in Jinja.  Figure 4-1.  Default space rendering in Jinja template  As you can see in Figure 4-1, the spacing before, after, and by the {% for %} and {% if %} statements   themselves is generated as is. While this spacing is natural, it can be beneficial to create more compact  outputs with templates that handle a lot of data. The minus sign - appended to either the start or end of a  statement  e.g., {%-   -%}  tells Jinja to strip the new line that follows it. This is best illustrated  with the examples presented in Figure 4-2 and Figure 4-3.  Figure 4-2.  Space rendering in Jinja template with single -  142   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Figure 4-3.  Space rendering in Jinja template with double -  As you can see in Figure 4-2, the - symbol before closing the {% for %} statement makes Jinja eliminate   the new line after each iteration. In the case of the {% if %} statement also in Figure 4-2, the - symbol has  no impact because there’s no newline associated with the statement. In Figure 4-3 you can see there’s   an additional - symbol at the start of the {% endfor %} statement which makes Jinja eliminate the   newline before the start of each iteration. In the case of the {% if %} statement also is Figure 4-3, the  additional - symbol has no impact because there’s no newline associated with the statement.  Because adding - symbols to every Jinja statement can become tiresome, you can configure Jinja so that   by default it uses this behavior  i.e., just as if you added - . To alter Jinja’s default spacing behavior, you can  use two Jinja environment parameters : trim_blocks and lstrip_blocks, both of which default to False.  Note that in Django you set up Jinja environment parameters as part of the OPTIONS variable in settings.py,  as described in the prior section on setting up Jinja template configuration in Django.  Figure 4-4 illustrates the rendering of a code snippet when trim_blocks is set to True, whereas    Figure 4-5 illustrates the rendering of a code snippet when both trim_blocks and lstrip_blocks are   set to True.  Figure 4-4.  Space rendering in Jinja template with trim_blocks  143   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Figure 4-5.  Space rendering in Jinja template with both trim_blocks and lstrip_blocks set to True  As you can see in Figures 4-4 and 4-5, the rendering produced by changing the trim_blocks and   lstrip_blocks Jinja environment variables is very similar to that of using - symbols to start and end Jinja  statements. It’s worth mentioning that if you set lstrip_blocks to True and want to omit its behavior for  certain sections, you can do so by adding the plus sign + to either the start or end of a statement - just like  you use the minus sign - to achieve its opposite behavior.  {% raw %}.- The {% raw %} statement is used to output any Jinja reserved characters  verbatim until the {% endraw %} statement is reached. The {% raw %} statement is  ideal if you want to render large chunks of Jinja template code or if you have a lot of  text that includes special Jinja template characters  e.g., {{, {% .   You can output special Jinja template characters individually by quoting them as part of a hard-coded      Tip  string variable  e.g., to output {{ use {{ '{{' }}  vs. using a {% raw %} statement.  {% autoescape %} .- The {% autoescape %} statement lets you escape HTML  characters from a template section, effectively overriding Django’s Jinja default  auto-escaping behavior. The {% autoescape %} accepts one of two arguments true  or false. With {% autoescape true %} all template content between this statement  and the {% endautoescape %} statement is HTML escaped, with {% autoescape  false %} no template content between this statement and the {% endautoescape  %} statement is HTML escaped.   {% autoescape %} requires enabling the built-in jinja2.ext.auto-escape extension. see the second to      Note  last section in this chapter on how to enable Jinja extensions for more details.   	   	  144    	   	   	   	   	   	   	  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  lipsum  Function .- The lipsum function is used to display random Latin text, which  is useful for filler on templates. The lipsum function is called with four parameters:  lipsum n=5, html=True, min=20, max=100 . Where n is a number of paragraphs to  generate, if not provided the default n is 5; html defaults to True to return HTML or  you can set it to False to return regular text; and min and max represent the minimum  and maximum number of random words per paragraph. To use the lipsum function  you simply define a variable with it and the output to generate the random Latin  text  e.g., {% set latinblurb=lipsum   %} and then {{latinblurb}} to output the  random Latin text .  Template Structures  {% block %}.- The {% block %} statement is used to define page sections that can  be overridden on different Jinja templates. See the previous section on creating  reusable Jinja templates for detailed examples of this statement.  { }.- The { } statement is used to enclose comments on Jinja templates. Any  content placed between { and } is bypassed by Jinja and doesn’t appear in the  final rendered web page.  {% extends %}.- The {% extends %} statement is used to reuse the layout of another  Jinja template. See the previous section on creating reusable Jinja templates for  detailed examples of this statement.  {% include %}.- The {% include %} statement is used to embed a Jinja template  in another Jinja template. Note that by default, the {% include %} statement gets  access to the current template instance values  i.e., its context . If you want to disable  access to a template’s context you can use the {% import %} statement or pass the  keyword without context to the end of the {% include %} statement  e.g., {% from  'footer.html' without context %} . In addition, the {% include %} statement  also accepts the ignore missing keyword, which tells Jinja to ignore the statement  if the template to be included does not exist. See the previous section on creating  reusable Jinja templates for detailed examples of this statement.  {% macro %}.- The {% macro %} statement is a template function designed to output  content. It’s ideal for repetitive content snippets, where you define a {% macro %}  statement once and execute it multiple times with different variables - like a function  - on any template. See the previous section on creating reusable Jinja templates  for detailed examples of this statement. It’s also worth mentioning the built-in {%  set %} statement – described in the Python and filter operations section – provides  simpler reuse functionality for content blocks.  {% call %}.- The {% call %} statement is used in conjunction with the {% macro  %} statement to reference the caller   method within a {% macro %} statement. If  you define a {% macro %} statement with a caller   reference as part of its content,  you can rely on the {% call %} statement to invoke the {% macro %} and have the  contents of the {% call %} statement substituted in place of the caller   method.  See the previous section on creating reusable Jinja templates for detailed examples  of this statement.  145   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   	  {% import %} and {% from ... import %}.- The {% import %} statement is used  to access elements from other templates. Similar to Python’s standard import, you  can also use the from and as keywords to limit or rename the elements imported  into a template. Note that by default and due to its caching behavior, the {% import  %} statement doesn’t get access to the current template instance values  i.e., its  context , it just gets access to globals  e.g., variables and macros . If you want to  access a template’s context you can use the {% include %} statement or pass the  keyword with context to the end of the {% import %} statement to disable caching  and access a template’s context  e.g., {% from 'footer.html' with context %} .  See the previous section on creating reusable Jinja templates for detailed examples  of this statement.  Jinja Built-In Filters and Tests  Like Django Filters   The Jinja documentation makes an explicit difference between what it calls filters and tests. The only  difference is that Jinja tests are used to evaluate conditions and Jinja filters are used to format or transform  values. In Django there is no such naming difference and an equivalent Jinja test in Django is simply called a  Django filter.  The syntax to apply Jinja filters to template variables is the vertical bar character , also called a ‘pipe’ in  Unix environments  e.g., {{variablefilter}} . It’s worth mentioning you can apply multiple filters to the  same variable  e.g., {{variablefilterfilter}} . The syntax to apply Jinja tests uses the is keyword along  with a regular conditional to evaluate the validity of a test  e.g., {% if variable is divisibleby 10 %}do  something{% endif %} .  In the upcoming sections, I’ll add the reference  Test  to indicate it’s referring to a Jinja test vs. a Jinja   filter. I’ll also classify each Django built-in filter and test into functional sections so they are easier to identify.  I’ll define the broadest category ‘Strings, lists, dictionaries, numbers and objects’ for filters and tests that are  applicable for most scenarios and then more specialized sections for each data type, including ‘String and  lists’, ‘Dictionaries and objects’, Strings, Numbers, Spacing and special characters, Development and testing,  and Urls.  Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, Numbers, and Objects   	   	  default or d.- The default or d filter is used to specify a default value if a variable  is undefined or is false  i.e., it doesn’t exist or is empty . For example, the filter  statement {{variabledefault "no value" }} outputs no value only if the  variable is undefined; otherwise it outputs the variable value. If in addition you  want to provide a default value for a variable that evaluates to false, is None  or is an empty string, you have to add true as a second filter parameter  e.g.,  {{variabledefault "no value",true }} outputs no value if the variable is  undefined, false, is None, or is an empty string .  defined  Test .- The defined test is used to check if a variable is defined, and if a  variable is defined this tests return true. Listing 4-19 illustrates an example of the  defined test.  146   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Listing 4-19.  Jinja defined test  {% if variable is defined %}     value of variable: {{ variable }} {% else %}     variable is not defined {% endif %}  none  Test .- The none test is used to check if a variable is none, and if a variable is  None this tests return true.  length or count.- The length filter is used to obtain the length of a value. For  example, if a variable contains latte the filter statement {{variablelength}}  outputs 5. For a list variable that contains ['a','e','i'] the filter statement  {{variablelength}} outputs 3.  equalto  Test .- The equalto test checks if an object has the same value as another  object. For example {% if coffee.price is equalto 1.99 %} coffee prices  equals 1.99 {% endif %}. This works just like the ==, but is more helpful when  used with other filters such as selectattr  e.g., {{ usersselectattr "email",  "equalto", "webmaster@coffeehouse.com"  }}, gets users with email webmaster@ coffeehouse.com .  string  Test .- The string test checks if a variable is a string  e.g., {% if variable  is string %}Yes, the variable is a string!{% endif %} .  number  Test .- The number test returns true if a variable is a number.  iterable  Test .- The iterable test checks if it’s possible to iterate over an object.  sequence  Test .- The sequence test checks if the object is a sequence  e.g., a  generator .  mapping  Test .- The mapping test checks if the object is a mapping  e.g., a  dictionary .  callable  Test .- The callable test verifies if an object is callable. In Python a  function, classes and object instances with a __call__ method are callables.  sameas  Test .- The sameas test verifies if an object points to the same memory  address than another object.  Strings and Lists  reverse.- The reverse filter is used to get inverse representation of a value. For  example, if a variable contains latte the filter statement {{variablereverse}}  generates ettal.  first.- The first filter returns the first item in a list or string. For example,  for a list variable that contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement  {{variablefirst}} outputs a.  join.- The join filter joins a list with a string. The join filter works just like  Python’s str.join list . For example, for a list variable that contains  ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement {{variablejoin "-- }} outputs a-- e--i--o--u. The join filter also supports joining certain attributes of an object    e.g., {{ usersjoin ', ', attribute='username'  }} .  147   	   	   	   	   	  	  	   	   	   	   	   	   	   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   	   	   	   	   	   	   	   	  last.- The last filter returns the last item in a list or string. For example,  for a list variable that contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement  {{variablelast}} outputs u.  map.- The map filter allows you to apply a filter or look up attributes, just like the  standard Python map method. For example, if you have list of users but are only  interested in outputting a list of usernames a map is helpful  e.g., {{ usersmap   attribute='username' join ', '  }} . In addition, it’s also possible to invoke  a filter by passing the name of the filter and the arguments afterwards  e.g., {{  titlesmap 'lower' join ', '  }} applies the lower filter to all the elements in  titles and then joins the items separated by a comma .  random.- The random filter returns a random item in a list. For example, for  a list variable that contains ['a','e','i','o','u'] the filter statement  {{variablerandom}} could output a, e, i, o, or u.  reject.- The reject filter removes elements that pass a certain test - see bullets in  this chapter section marked as  Test  for acceptable values. For example, for a list  variable that contains [1,2,3,4,5] the loop statement with this filter {% for var   in variablereject "odd"  %}{{var}}{% endfor %} - where odd is the Jinja   test – rejects elements that are odd and thus its output is 2 and 4.  select.- The select filter selects elements that pass a certain test --see bullets in  this chapter section marked as  Test  for acceptable values. For example, for a list  variable that contains [1,2,3,4,5] the loop statement with this filter {% for var in  variableselect "odd"  %}{{var}}{% endfor %} -- where odd is the Jinja test –  selects elements that are odd and thus its output is 1, 3, and 5.  slice.- The slice filter returns a slice of lists. For example, for a variable that  contains ["Capuccino"] the filter statement {% for var in variableslice 4   %}{{var}}{% endfor %} outputs ['C', 'a', 'p'],['u', 'c'],['c', 'i'],  ['n', 'o']. It's possible to use the fill_with as a second argument – which  defaults to None – so all segments contain the same number of elements filled with  a given value. For example, {% for var in variableslice 4,'FILLER'  %} {{var}}{% endfor %} outputs: ['C', 'a', 'p'],['u', 'c','FILLER'],['c',  'i','FILLER'], ['n', 'o','FILLER'].  batch.- The batch filter returns a batch of lists. For example, a variable that contains  ["Capuccino"] the filter statement {% for var in variablebatch 4  %}{{var}} {% endfor %} outputs ['C', 'a', 'p', 'u'],['c', 'c', 'i', 'n'],['o']. It’s  possible to use the fill_with as a second argument – which defaults to None – so  all segments contain the same number of elements filled with a given value. For  example, {% for var in variableslice 4,'FILLER'  %}{{var}}{% endfor %}  outputs: ['C', 'a', 'p', 'u'],['c', 'c', 'i', 'n'],['o','FILLER','FILLER' ,'FILLER'].  sort.- The sort filter sorts elements by ascending order. For example, if a variable  contains ['e','u','a','i','o'] the statement {{variablesort}} outputs  ['a','e','i','o','u']. It’s possible to indicate descending order by setting the first  argument to true  e.g., {{variablesort true }} outputs ['u','o','i','e','a'] .  In addition, if a list is made up strings, a second argument can be used to indicate  case sensitiveness - which is disabled by default - to perform the sort operation  e.g.,  {{variablesort true,true }} . Finally, if a list is composed of objects, it’s also  possible to specify the sort operation on a given attribute  e.g., variablesort attri bute='date'  to sort the elements based on the date attribute .  148   Dictionaries and Objects  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   	   	   	   	   	  dictsort.- The dictsort filter sorts a dictionary by key, case insensitive.  For example, if a variable contains {'name':'Downtown','city':'San  Diego','state':'CA'} the filter {% with newdict=variabledictsort %} the  newdict variable is assigned the dictionary {'city':'San Diego','name':'Dow ntown','state':'CA'}. In addition, the dictsort can accept two arguments, for  case sensitive insensitive order and sorting by key value. The default behavior is  case insensitive sort by key  e.g., variabledictsort , to use case sensitive sort by  key use true as the first argument  e.g., variabledictsort true  , to use sort by  value is value as the second argument  e.g., variabledictsort false,'value'   performs a case insensitive sort by value .  attr.- The attr filter returns the attribute of an object  e.g., {{coffeehouse.city}}  outputs the city attribute value of the coffeehouse object . Note the attr filter only  attempts to look up an attribute and not an item  e.g., if coffeehouse is a dictionary  and city is a key item it won’t be found . Alternatively, you can just use the standard  Python syntax variable.name - which first attempts to locate an attribute called name  on variable, then the name item on variable or if nothing matches an undefined  object is returned-- or variable['name'] - which first attempts to locate the name  item on variable, then an attribute called name on variable or if nothing matches  an undefined object is returned.  rejectattr.- The rejectattr filter removes objects that don’t contain an attribute  or objects for which a certain attribute doesn’t pass a test – see bullets in this chapter  section marked as  Test  for acceptable values. For example, {% for ch in coffee housesrejectattr "closedon"  %} generates a loop for coffeehouse objects that  don’t have the closedon attribute or {% for u in usersrejectattr "email",  "none"  %} generates a loop for user objects that don’t have email None - note the  second argument none represents the test.  selectattr.- The selectattr filter selects objects that contain an attribute or  objects for which a certain attribute passes a test – see bullets in this chapter  section marked as  Test  for acceptable values. For example, {% for u in  usersselectattr "superuser"  %} generates a loop for user objects that have  the superuser attribute or {% for u in usersselectattr "email", "none"  %}  generates a loop for user objects that have email None - note the second argument  none represents the test.  groupby.- The groupby filter is used to rearrange the contents of a list of dictionaries  or objects into different group object sequences by a common attribute. Listing 4-20  illustrates an example of the groupby filter.  Listing 4-20.  Jinja groupby filter   Dictionary definition stores = [     {'name': 'Downtown', 'street': '385 Main Street', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'name': 'Uptown', 'street': '231 Highland Avenue', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'name': 'Midtown', 'street': '85 Balboa Street', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'name': 'Downtown', 'street': '639 Spring Street', 'city': 'Los Angeles'},     {'name': 'Midtown', 'street': '1407 Broadway Street', 'city': 'Los Angeles'},     {'name': 'Downton', 'street': '50 1st Street', 'city': 'San Francisco'}, ]  149   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango    {% for group in storesgroupby 'city'  %}      {{ group.grouper }}               {% for item in group.list %}            {{ item.name }}: {{ item.street }}          {% endfor %}             {% endfor %}     Output Los Angeles     Downtown: 639 Spring Street     Midtown: 1407 Broadway Street San Diego     Downtown : 385 Main Street     Uptown : 231 Highland Avenue     Midtown : 85 Balboa Street San Francisco     Downtown: 50 1st Street   Alternate shortcut syntax, produces same output   {% for grouper, list in storesgroupby 'city'  %}      {{ grouper }}               {% for item in list %}            {{ item.name }}: {{ item.street }}          {% endfor %}             {% endfor %}       Tip  this chapter.  150   	  tojson.- The tojson filter outputs data structures to JavaScript Object Notation JSON    e.g.{{variabletojson}} . The tojson filter accepts the indent argument – which is  set to None – to generate pretty output by a given number of spaces  e.g., {{variablet ojson indent=2 }}  generates output indented with two spaces .   You can globally set options for the tojson filter through Jinja policies, described in the last section of    Strings  	   	   	   	   	   	  	   	   	   	   	   	  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  capitalize.- The capitalize filter capitalizes the first character of a string  variable. For example, if a variable contains hello world the filter statement  {{variablecapitalize}} outputs Hello world.  list.- The list filter is used to return a list of characters. For example, if a  variable contains latte the filter statement {{variablelist}} generates  ['l','a','t','t','e'].  lower.- The lower filter converts all values of a string variable to lowercase. For  example, if a variable contains Hello World the filter statement {{variablelower}}  outputs hello world.  lower  Test .- The lower test returns true if a variable is lowercased. For example,   {% if variable is lower %}Yes, the variable is lowercase!{% endif %}  outputs the statement if variable is lowercased.  replace.- The replace filter works just like Python’s standard replace string.  The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the  replacement string. If the optional third argument amount is given, only this amount  of occurrences are replaced. For example {{ "Django 1.8"replace "1.8",  "1.9"  }} outputs Django 1.9 and {{"oooh Django!"replace "o", "",2  }}  outputs oh Django!.  string.- The string filter makes a string unicode if it isn’t already.  title.- The title filter converts all first character values of a string variable to  uppercase. For example, if a variable contains hello world the filter statement  {{variabletitle}} outputs Hello World.  upper.- The upper filter converts all values of a string variable to uppercase. For  example, if a variable contains Hello World the filter statement {{variableupper}}  outputs HELLO WORLD.  upper  Test .- The upper test returns true if a variable is uppercased. For example, {%  if variable is upper %}Yes, the variable is uppercase!{% endif %} outputs  the statement if variable is uppercase.  wordcount.- The wordcount filter counts the words in a string. For example, if a  variable contains Coffeehouse started as a small store the filter statement  {{variablewordcount}} outputs 6.  Numbers  abs.- The abs return the absolute value of the number argument. For example, if a  variable contains -5 the filter statement {{variableabs}} outputs 5.  filesizeformat.-The filesizeformat filter converts a number of bytes into a  friendly file size string. For example, if a variable contains 250 the filter statement  {{variablefilesizeformat}} outputs 250 Bytes, if it contains 2048 the output is  2 kB, if it contains 2000000000 the output is 2.0 GB. By default, decimal prefixes are  used  e.g., Giga, Mega, Kilo , if you pass an additional Boolean parameter with true   e.g., {{variablefilesizeformat true }}  then binary prefixes are used  e.g.,  Gibi, Mebi, Kibi .  151   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  float.- The float filter converts a value into a floating-point number. If the  conversion doesn’t work it returns 0.0 or a custom value argument  e.g.,  variablefloat "It didn't work"  returns "It didn't work" if variable can’t  be converted to a floating-point number .  int.- The int filter converts a value into an integer. If the conversion doesn’t work it  returns 0 or a custom value specified as the first argument to the filter – just like the  float filter. You can also override the default base 10 with a second filter argument,  which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8, and 16  respectively  e.g., {{'0b001111'int 0,2 }} a base 2 number outputs 15.  round.- The round filter rounds a number to a given precision, where the first  argument is the precision - which defaults to 0 - and the second argument is a  rounding method - which defaults to ‘common’ rounding either up or down. For  example, {{ 33.55round }} assumes ‘common’ rounding to output 34.0 . In  addition to 'common’, it’s also possible to use ‘ceil’ to always round up or ‘floor’ to  always round down  e.g., {{ 33.55round 1,'floor'  }} outputs 33.5 . Note that  even if rounded to the default 0 precision, a float is returned. If you need an integer  you can apply the int filter  e.g., {{ 33.55roundint }} outputs 34 .  sum.- The sum filter returns the sum of a sequence of numbers, plus the value  provided with the start parameter that defaults to 0. In addition, it’s also possible to  sum certain attributes of a list of objects {{ itemssum attribute='price'  }}.  divisibleby  Test .- The divisibleby test checks if a variable is divisible by a given  number. For example, if a variable contains 20 the filter statement {% if variable  is divisibleby 5  %}Variable is divisible by 5!{% endif %} outputs the  conditional statement.  even  Test .- The even test checks if a number is even.  odd  Test .- The odd test checks if a number is odd.  Spacing and Special Characters  center.- The center filter center aligns a value and pads it with additional  whitespace characters until it reaches the given argument of characters. For example,  if a variable contains mocha the filter statement {{variablecenter width="15" }}  outputs "     mocha     ".  escape or e.- The escape or e filter escapes HTML characters from a value. Specifically  with the escape filter:   is converted to &gt;,'  single quote  is  converted to &39;,"  double quote  is converted to &quot;, and & is converted to &amp.  escaped  Test .- The escaped test checks if a value is escaped.  forceescape.- The forceescape filter escapes HTML characters from a value just  like the escape filter. The difference between both filters is the forceescape filter is  applied immediately and returns a new and escaped string. This is useful in the rare  cases where you need multiple escaping or want to apply other filters to the escaped  results. Normally, you’ll use the escape filter.   	   	   	   	   	   	  	   	   	   	  	  152    	   	   	   	   	   	   	  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  format.- The format filter is used to apply Python string formatting to a variable.  For example, the statement {{ "%s and %s"format "Python", "Django!"  }}  outputs Python and Django!.  indent.- The indent filter is used to output a string with each line except the  first one indented with four spaces. It’s possible to change the number of spaces  and the indentation of the first line with additional filter arguments  e.g., {{  textvariableindent 2, true  }} the 2 indicates two spaces and true indicates to  indent the first line.  safe.- The safe filter marks a string as not requiring further HTML escaping. When  this filter is used with an environment without automatic escaping it has no effect.  striptags.- The striptags filter removes all HTML tags from a value. For example, if a  variable contains  Coffee house, the  best   drinks  the  filter statement {{variablestriptags}} outputs Coffeehouse, the best drinks.  trim.- The trim filter is used to strip leading and trailing whitespace just like  Python’s string strip   method.  truncate.- The truncate filter truncates a string to a given number of characters  - defaulting to 255 characters - and appends an ellipsis sequence. For example, if  a variable contains Coffeehouse started as a small store the filter statement  {{variabletruncate 20 }} outputs Coffeehouse ..., keeping up until character  number 20 and then discarding the last full word, finally adding the ellipsis. You can  add true as a second argument so the string is cut at an exact length  e.g., {{vari abletruncate 20,true }} outputs Coffeehouse start... including the ellipsis  characters . It’s possible to provide a different symbol than an ellipsis passing a  second parameter  e.g., {{variabletruncate 20,true,"!!!" }} would output  !!! instead of an elipsis . And finally, the truncate filter accepts a fourth argument  leeway to specify a string tolerance in characters – which defaults to 5 – to avoid  truncating strings  e.g., this avoids truncating words with less than 5 characters .   You can globally set the leeway value for the truncate filter through Jinja policies, described in the last      Tip  section of this chapter.  wordwrap.- The wordwrap filter wraps words at a given character line length  argument. By default, the wrapping occurs after 79 characters, which can be  overridden providing a first argument with the number of characters. If you set  a second parameter to false, Jinja does not split words longer than the wrapping  character length. In addition, wrapping generates a newline character as defined in  the environment -- generally the \n character - but this can be changed by specifying  the wrapstring keyword argument  e.g., {{variablewordwrap 40,true,'-'  uses  a hyphen as the wrapping newline character . Listing 4-21 illustrates an example of  the wordwrap filter.  153   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Listing 4-21.  Jinja wordwrap filter   Variable definition Coffeehouse started as a small store   Template definition with wordwrap filter for every 12 characters {{variablewordwrap 12 }}   Output Coffeehouse started as a small store   	  xmlattr.- The xmlattr filter is used to create an SGML XML attribute string based on  the items in a dictionary or object. Once you create a dictionary structure containing  attribute names and reference values, you pass it through the xmlattr filter to  generate the attribute string. By default, all values that are neither none or undefined  are automatically escaped, but you can override this behavior by passing false as the  first filter argument. Listing 4-22 illustrates an example of the xmlattr filter.  Listing 4-22.  Django xmlattr filter   Variable definition {% set stores = [     {'id':123,'name': 'Downtown', 'street': '385 Main Street', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'id':243,'name': 'Uptown', 'street': '231 Highland Avenue', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'id':357,'name': 'Midtown', 'street': '85 Balboa Street', 'city': 'San Diego'},     {'id':478,'name': 'Downtown', 'street': '639 Spring Street', 'city': 'Los Angeles'},     {'id':529,'name': 'Midtown', 'street': '1407 Broadway Street', 'city': 'Los Angeles'},     {'id':653,'name': 'Downton', 'street': '50 1st Street', 'city': 'San Francisco'}, ] %}   Template definition   {% for store in stores %}   <li {{ {'id':'%d'format store.id ,'class':'%s'format store.citylowerreplace ' ','-'    }xmlattr }}> {{store.city}} {{store.name}}  {% endfor %}     Output       San Diego Downtown      San Diego Uptown      San Diego Midtown      Los Angeles Downtown      Los Angeles Midtown      San Francisco Downton     154   Urls   	   	   	  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Development and Testing  pprint.- The pprint filter is a wrapper for Python's pprint.pprint  . The pprint  filter is useful during development and testing because it outputs the formatted  representation of an object. By default, the pprint filter is not verbose but you can  make it verbose passing it the true argument  e.g., {{variablepprint true }} .  urlencode.- The urlencode filter escapes a value for use in a URL. For example, if a  variable contains http:  localhost drinks?type=cold&size=large the filter statement  {{variableurlencode}} outputs http%3A  localhost drinks%3Ftype%3Dcold%26size %3Dlarge.  urlize.- The urlize filter converts text URLs into clickable HTML links. You can pass  the filter an additional integer to shorten the visible url  e.g., {{ variableurlize 40 }}  links are shortened to 40 characters plus an ellipsis . It’s also possible to add a  second argument as a Boolean to make the urls "nofollow"  e.g., {{ variableurlize 40,  true }} links are shortened to 40 characters and defined with rel="nofollow" .  Finally, it’s also possible to add the target argument to define a link target  e.g., {{  variableurlize 40, target="_blank" }} links are shortened to 40 characters and open  in a new window .   You can globally set rel and target values for the the urlize filter through Jinja policies, described in the      Tip  last section of this chapter.  Custom Filters and Tests in Jinja  Custom Jinja filters and tests are easy to create because they are backed by regular Python methods. For  custom Jinja filters a method should return the desired formatted value, and for Jinja tests a method should  contain the logic to return a Boolean value.  Structure The backing method for a custom Jinja filter or test has arguments that correspond to the variable itself - as  the first argument - and any remaining values passed by the filter or test as other method arguments  e.g.,  variablemycustomfilter " "  backed by a method like def mycustomfilter variable,htmltag="  " : -- note the htmltag argument has a default value in case the filter doesn’t specify this value with a  statement like variablemycustomfilter .  The only Jinja specific logic you need to consider when creating backing Python methods is related to   character safety in Jinja filters. By default, if a backing method for a Jinja filter returns a string, it’s considered  unsafe and is therefore escaped  e.g., if the result of the filter returns  , Jinja renders the result as  &lt;div&gt;  – which is the same behavior enforced by custom Django filters.  To mark the result as a safe string, the backing Python method used by a Jinja filter must return a  jinja2.Markup type, a process that’s illustrated in one of the sample filters in Listing 4-23. Listing 4-23  illustrates various backing methods for custom Jinja filters and tests.  155   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Listing 4-23.  Backing Python methods for Jinja custom filters and tests.  def customcoffee value,arg="muted" :     return jinja2.Markup '%s' %  arg,value    import jinja2  import math  def squarerootintext value :     return "The square root of %s is %s" %  value,math.sqrt value    def startswithvowel value :     if value.lower  .startswith  "a", "e", "i", "o","u"  :         return True     else:         return False  The first method in Listing 4-23 returns the value argument wrapped in an HTML   tag and   appends a CSS class with the arg argument - note the arg argument in the method definition defaults to the  muted value in case no value is provided. And also notice the customcoffee method returns a jinja2.Markup  type; this is done so Jinja renders the output as a safe string and interprets the   tag as HTML.  The second method in Listing 4-23 calculates the square root of a given value and returns the standard   string "The square root of %s is %s" where the first %s represents the passed in value and the second  %s the calculated square root. The third method in Listing 4-23 takes the value argument, transforms it to  lowercase, and checks if value starts with a vowel; if it does it returns a Boolean True otherwise it returns a  Boolean False.  Installation and Access Once you create the backing methods for custom Jinja filters and tests, you need to declare them as part of  the filters and or tests variables on Jinja’s environment configuration, which is described in the next section.  Note that it’s assumed the backing methods in Listing 4-23 are placed in a file module named filters under  the coffeehouse.jinja directory path.  To better illustrate the location of the filters.py file containing the custom Jinja extension, Listing 4-24   illustrates a directory structure with additional Django project files for reference.  Listing 4-24.  Directory structure and location of custom Jinja filters and tests  +---+-           +-__init__.py     +-settings.py     +-urls.py     +-wsgi.py          +-jinja-+             +-__init__.py             +-env.py             +-filters.py  156   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Jinja filters and tests are set up as part of Jinja’s environment configuration. Listing 4-25 illustrates a  custom Jinja environment definition that sets a series of custom Jinja filters through the variable named  filters and tests.  Listing 4-25.  Custom Jinja environment with custom filters and tests  from jinja2.environment import Environment from coffeehouse.jinja.filters import customcoffee, squarerootintext, startswithvowel  class JinjaEnvironment Environment :     def __init__ self,**kwargs :         super JinjaEnvironment, self .__init__ **kwargs          self.filters['customcoffee'] = customcoffee         self.filters['squarerootintext'] = squarerootintext         self.filters['startswithvowel'] = startswithvowel         self.tests['startswithvowel'] = startswithvowel  As you can see in Listing 4-25, each backing Python method is first imported into the custom Jinja   environment. Next, to register custom Jinja filters you access self.filters and assign it a variable key name  - corresponding to the filter name - along with the backing method for the filter. And to register custom Jinja  tests you access self.tests and assign it a variable key name - corresponding to the test name - along with  the backing method for the test.  An interesting aspect of Listing 4-25 is the registration of startswithvowel as both a filter and test,   which means the same backing method - which returns True or False - can be used for both cases. This dual  registration allows startswithvowel to either use a pipe  i.e., as a filter {{variablestartwithvowel}}  to output True or False verbatim  or the is keyword in a conditional  i.e., as a test {% if variable is  startswithvowel %}variable starts with vowel{% endif %} .  Once a custom Jinja environment is created, you need to set it up as part of Django’s configuration in   the OPTIONS variable of settings.py, as illustrated in Listing 4-26.  Listing 4-26.  Configure custom Jinja environment in Django setttings.py  TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND':'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',         'DIRS': ['%s templates '%  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'environment': 'coffeehouse.jinja.env.JinjaEnvironment'             }         },     ]  In this case, you can see in Listing 4-26 the environment value corresponds to coffeehouse.jinja.env. JinjaEnvironment, where JinjaEnvironment is the class - in Listing 4-25 - env is the file module name and  coffeehouse.jinja is the directory path. To better illustrate the location of the env.py file take a look at the  directory structure in Listing 4-24.  Once you finish this last registration step, all the declared custom Jinja filters and tests become available   on all Jinja templates just like the regular built-in filters and tags described in the previous section.  157   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango   the custom Jinja environment in listing 4-25 for custom Jinja filters and tests is the same technique      Note  used in listing 4-11 to declare Jinja globals.  Jinja Extensions  A Jinja extension is to Jinja templates what a library is for programming languages: a reusable set of features  contained in a specific format to not have to continuously ‘reinvent the wheel’.  Jinja itself includes various extensions that need to be enabled to be used. In addition, there are also   various third-party Jinja extensions that you can find helpful in certain situations  e.g., Jinja statements that  emulate Django template tags . Table 4-2 contains a list of extensions including their technical name that’s  used to enable them.  Table 4-2.  Jinja extensions with description and technical name  Extension functionality  Description  {% break %} and {% continue  %} statements  Offers the ability to break and continue in  template loops, just like the standard break  and continue Python keywords.

To install jdj_tags.extensions.DjangoCompat use pip install jinja2-django-tags.  As you can see in Table 4-2, the functionality provided by each extension varies and if you do an   Internet search for ‘Jinja2 extensions’, you are sure to find a few more options that can save you time and  work on various fronts.  To create a custom Jinja extension you need to reuse the functionality provided by Jinja’s jinja2.ext.  Extension class, as well as use Jinja’s API to create the custom logic you’re pursuing. Once you create a  custom Jinja extension and add it to your Django project, you must also enable it with the extensions key of  the OPTIONS variable in settings.py.  158   Enable Jinja Extensions Jinja extensions are set up as part of Jinja’s environment configuration, which in Django is configured in  the OPTIONS variable of settings.py, as described in the previous section on configuring Jinja templates in  Django. Listing 4-27 illustrates a sample Django configuration that enables a series of Jinja extensions.  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Listing 4-27.  Jinja extension configuration in Django  TEMPLATES = [     {         'BACKEND':'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2',         'DIRS': ['%s templates '%  PROJECT_DIR ,],         'APP_DIRS': True,         'OPTIONS': {             'extensions': [                 'jinja2.ext.loopcontrols',                 'jdj_tags.extensions.DjangoCompat',                 'coffeehouse.jinja.extensions.DjangoNow',                 ],         }    } ]  As you can see in Listing 4-27, we use the Jinja extension’s name - as described in Table 4-2 - and add it to a  list that’s assigned to the extensions key of the OPTIONS variable, which itself is part of Jinja’s TEMPLATES Django  configuration in settings.py. Note that the third extension coffeehouse.jinja.extensions.DjangoNow in  Listing 4-27 is a custom Jinja extension that I’ll create in the next and final section of this chapter.  This is all that’s necessary to enable a Jinja extension across all Jinja templates. Now that you know how   to enable Jinja extensions, the next section explores how to create custom Jinja extensions.  Create Jinja Extensions Jinja has its own extension API, which is thoroughly documented7 and tackles all the possible cases you  may need an extension for. I won’t attempt to use all of the API’s functionality, because it would be nearly  impossible to do so in a single example; instead I’ll focus on creating a practical extension and in the process  illustrate the layout and deployment process for a custom Jinja extension.  In Django templates when you want to output the current date or time, there’s a tag named {% now %}  for just this purpose; Jinja has no such statement, so I’ll create a Jinja extension to mimic the same behavior  as the Django template {% now %} tag. The Jinja {% now %} statement will function just like the Django  template version and accept a format string, as well as the possibility to use the as keyword to define a  variable with the value.  Listing 4-28 illustrates the source code for the custom Jinja extension that produces a Jinja {% now %}   statement.  7http:  jinja.pocoo.org docs 2.9 extensions   159   Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  Listing 4-28.  Jinja custom extension for Jinja {% now %} statement  from jinja2 import lexer, nodes from jinja2.ext import Extension from django.utils import timezone from django.template.defaultfilters import date from django.conf import settings from datetime import datetime  class DjangoNow Extension :     tags = set ['now']       def _now self, date_format :         tzinfo = timezone.get_current_timezone   if settings.USE_TZ else None         formatted = date datetime.now tz=tzinfo ,date_format          return formatted      def parse self, parser :         lineno = next parser.stream .lineno         token = parser.stream.expect lexer.TOKEN_STRING          date_format = nodes.Const token.value          call = self.call_method '_now', [date_format], lineno=lineno          token = parser.stream.current         if token.test 'name:as' :             next parser.stream              as_var = parser.stream.expect lexer.TOKEN_NAME              as_var = nodes.Name as_var.value, 'store', lineno=as_var.lineno              return nodes.Assign as_var, call, lineno=lineno          else:             return nodes.Output [call], lineno=lineno   After the various import statements in Listing 4-28, you can see we create the DjangoNow class that  inherits its behavior from the jinja2.ext.Extension class, the last of which is part of Jinja and used for  all custom extensions. Next, you can see we define the tags field with the set ['now']  value, which is  necessary to set up the statement tag name. If you wanted the custom statement tag to be called   {% mytimer %} then you would declare tags = set ['mytimer'] .  Next in Listing 4-28 you can see the _now and parse methods. The _now method performs the actual   current date or time calculation and checks the Django project’s timezone configuration in settings. py - a process that’s just like Django’s {% now %} tag. The parse method represents the entry point that  executes the custom {% now %} statement tag, where it uses the Jinja extension API to analyze the input  and depending on the {% now %} declaration  e.g.{% now "F jS o" %}, {% now "F jS o" as today %}   executes the _now method and returns a result.  Once you create the custom Jinja extension, you need to declare it as part of the extensions variable on   Jinja’s environment configuration, as illustrated in Listing 4-27.  To better illustrate the location of the extensions.py file containing the custom Jinja extension, Listing 4-29   illustrates a directory structure with additional Django project files for reference.  160   Listing 4-29.  Directory structure and location of custom Jinja extension  Chapter 4   JInJa templates In DJango  +---+-           +-__init__.py     +-settings.py     +-urls.py     +-wsgi.py          +-jinja-+             +-__init__.py             +-extensions.py  Note that based on the statement to import the custom Jinja extension in Listing 4-27 - coffeehouse. jinja.extensions.DjangoNow - it’s assumed the DjangoNow class in Listing 4-28 is placed in a file module  named extensions.py under the coffeehouse.jinja directory path.  Jinja Policies  Jinja policies are used to set the global behavior of Jinja built-in filters and other template constructs. Jinja  policies are set in Jinja environments – just like Jinja globals in Listing 4-11 or custom Jinja filters and tests in  Listing 4-25.  For example, you can use Jinja policies to alter the way the json or urlize built-in filters operate by   default. Listing 4-30 illustrates a custom Jinja environment that alters the Jinja built-in truncate filter and  sets the leeway option to 0.  Listing 4-30.  Custom Jinja environment with policies  from jinja2.environment import Environment from coffeehouse.jinja.filters import customcoffee, squarerootintext, startswithvowel  class JinjaEnvironment Environment :     def __init__ self,**kwargs :         super JinjaEnvironment, self .__init__ **kwargs          self.policies['truncate.leeway'] = 0  As you can see in Listing 4-30, to register Jinja policies you access self.policies and assign it the   policy key name8 – in this case corresponding to truncate.leeway - along with the policy value – in this case  corresponding to 0. By setting the Jinja policy in Listing 4-30, anytime you use the truncate filter in Jinja  templates, the leeway is set to 0, instead of the default 5.  8http:  jinja.pocoo.org docs 2.9 api policies  161   CHAPTER 5  Django Application Management  Django, like all modern application development frameworks, requires that you eventually manage tasks to  support the core operation of a project. This can range from efficiently setting up a Django application to run  in the real world, to managing an application’s static resources  e.g., CSS, JavaScript, image files .  In addition, other routine application management tasks can include the following: establishing  a logging strategy to enforce problem detection, setting up email delivery for application users and or  administrators, as well as debugging tasks to inspect the outcome of complex operations. In this chapter,  you’ll learn about these and other common topics associated with Django application management.  Django settings.py for the Real World  The settings.py is the central configuration for all Django projects. In previous chapters you already  worked with a series of variables in this file to configure things like Django applications, databases,  templates, and middleware, among other things.  Although the settings.py file uses reasonable default values for practically all variables, when a   Django application transitions into the real world, you need to take into account a series of adjustments, to  efficiently run the Django application, offer end users a streamlined experience, and keep potential rogue  attackers in check.  Switch DEBUG to False One of the first things that’s necessary to launch a Django application into the real world is to change the  DEBUG variable to False. I’ve briefly mentioned in previous chapters how Django’s behavior changes when  switching DEBUG=False to DEBUG=True. All these behavioral changes associated with the DEBUG variable are  intended to enhance project security. Table 5-1 illustrates the differences between having a project run with  DEBUG=False and DEBUG=True.    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_5  163   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Table 5-1.  Django behavior differences between DEBUG=True and DEBUG=False  Functionality  DEBUG=True behavior DEBUG=False behavior  Error handling and  notification  Displays full stack of  errors on request pages  for quick analysis.  Static resources  Set up by default on a  project’s  static  URL  for simplicity.  Displays default ‘vanilla’ or custom error pages  without any stack details to limit security threats or  embarrassments. Emails project administrators of  errors.  See the ‘Define administrators for ADMINS and  MANAGERS’ section in this section for more details on  email notifications.  Disables automatic setup to avoid security  vulnerabilities and requires consolidation in a separate  directory to run static resources on a separate web  server.  See the Set up static web page resources -  Images, CSS, JavaScript – in the next section.   Host site qualifier  Requests for all hosts  sites are accepted for  processing.  It’s necessary to qualify for which hosts sites a project  can handle requests. If a site host is not qualified, all  requests are denied.  See the ‘Define ALLOWED_HOSTS’  section in this section for more details.   As you can see in Table 5-1, the changes enforced by changing DEBUG=True to DEBUG=False are intended  for publicly accessible applications  i.e., production environments . You may not like the hassle of adapting  to these changes, but they are enforced to maintain a heightened level of security on all Django projects that  run in the real world.  Define ALLOWED_HOSTS By default, the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable in settings.py is empty. The purpose of ALLOWED_HOSTS is to  validate a request’s HTTP Host header. Validation is done to prevent rogue users from sending fake HTTP  Host headers that can potentially poison caches and password reset emails with links to malicious hosts.  Since this issue can only present itself under an uncontrolled user environment  i.e., public production  servers , this validation is only done when DEBUG=False.  If you switch to DEBUG=False and ALLOWED_HOSTS is left empty, Django refuses to serve requests and  instead responds with HTTP 400 bad request pages, since it can’t validate incoming HTTP Host headers.  Listing 5-1 illustrates a sample definition of ALLOWED_HOSTS.  Listing 5-1.  Django ALLOWED_HOSTS definition  ALLOWED_HOSTS = [     '.coffeehouse.com',     '.bestcoffeehouse.com', ]  As you can see in Listing 5-1, the ALLOWED_HOSTS value is a list of strings. In this case it defines t   wo host domains that allow bestcoffeehouse.com to act as an alias of coffeehouse.com. The leading . dot   for each domain indicates a subdomain is also an allowed host domain  e.g., static.coffeehouse.com or  shop.coffeehouse.com is valid for .coffeehouse.com .  164   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  If you wanted to accept a single and fully qualified domain  FQDN , you would define    ALLOWED_HOSTS=['www.coffeehouse.com'], which would only accept requests with an HTTP Host   www.coffeehouse.com. In a similar fashion, if you wanted to accept any HTTP host - effectively bypassing the  verification - you would define ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*'], which indicates a wildcard.  Be Careful with the SECRET_KEY Value The SECRET_KEY value in settings.py is another security-related variable like ALLOWED_HOSTS. However,  unlike ALLOWED_HOSTS, SECRET_KEY is assigned a default value and a very long value at that  e.g., 'oubrz5ado &%+t qu^fqo_uhn7*+q*9b3gje0-yj7^gronn' .  The purpose of the SECRET_KEY value is to digitally sign certain data structures that are sensitive   to tampering. Specifically, Django by default uses the SECRET_KEY on sensitive data structures like  session identifiers, cookies, and password reset tokens. But you can rely on the SECRET_KEY value to  cryptographically protect any sensitive data structure in a Django project.1  The one thing the default data structures signed with the SECRET_KEY have in common is they’re sent   to users on the wider Internet and are then sent back to the application to trigger actions on behalf of users.  It’s in this scenario we enter into a trust issue. Can the data sent back to the application be trusted? What if  a malicious user attempts to simulate another user’s cookie or session data to hijack his access? This is what  digitally signed data prevents.  Before Django sends any of these sensitive data structures to users on the Internet, it signs them with   a project’s SECRET_KEY. When the data structures come back to fulfill an action, Django rechecks these  sensitive data structures against the SECRET_KEY again. If there was any tampering on the data structures, the  signature check fails and Django halts the process.  The only remote possibility a rogue user has to successfully pull an attack of this kind is if the    SECRET_KEY is compromised - since an attacker can potentially create an altered data structure that matches  a project’s SECRET_KEY. Therefore you should be careful about exposing your project’s SECRET_KEY. If you  suspect for any reason a project’s SECRET_KEY has been compromised, you should replace it immediately  - only a few ephemeral data structures  i.e., sessions, cookies  become invalid with this change, until users  re-log in again and the new SECRET_KEY is used to regenerate these data structures.  Define Administrators for ADMINS and MANAGERS Once a Django project is made accessible to end users, you’ll want some way to receive notifications of  important events related to security or other critical factors. Django has two sets of administrative groups  defined in settings.py: ADMINS and MANAGERS. By default, both ADMINS and MANAGERS are empty. The values  assigned to both variables need to be tuples, where the first value of the tuple is a name and the second part  of the tuple is an email. Listing 5-2 shows a sample definition of ADMINS and MANAGERS.  Listing 5-2.  Django ADMINS and MANAGERS definition  ADMINS =   'Webmaster','webmaster@coffeehouse.com' , 'Administrator','admin@coffeehouse.com'    MANAGERS = ADMINS  As you can see in Listing 5-2, the ADMINS variable is assigned two tuples with different administrators.  Next, you can see the ADMINS value is assigned to the MANAGERS variable. You can, of course, define different  values for MANAGERS using the same syntax as ADMINS, but in this case I just gave both variables the same  values for simplicity.  1https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 topics signing   165   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  The purpose of having these two administrative groups in settings.py is for Django to send email   notifications of project events. By default, these events are limited and happen under certain circumstances.  After all, you don’t want to send administrators 10 email notifications every minute, 24 7.  By default, ADMINS are sent email notifications of errors associated with the django.request or    django.security packages, if and only if DEBUG=False. This is a pretty narrow criteria, as it’s intended to  notify only the most serious errors - for requests and security - and only for production environments, which  is when DEBUG=False. For no other events or conditions are the ADMINS notified by email. By default, MANAGERS are sent email notifications of broken links  i.e., HTTP 404 page   requests , if and only if DEBUG=False and the Django middleware django.middleware.common. BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware is enabled. Because HTTP 404 page requests aren’t a serious problem,  by default BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware is disabled. This is an even narrower criteria than for ADMINS,  because irrespective of a project being in development  DEBUG=True  or production  DEBUG=False , the  BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware class needs to be added to MIDDLEWARE variable in settings.py for MANAGERS  to get notifications. For no other events or conditions are the MANAGERS notified by email.  Now that you know the purpose of ADMINS and MANAGERS, add users and emails as you see fit to your   project. Remember you can always leverage the values in ADMINS and MANAGERS for other custom logic in a  Django project  e.g., notify administrators of user signups .  MODIFY LOGGING TO STOP EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS TO ADMINS  By default, users in aDMinS start receiving error emails as soon as you switch to DeBUg=False - this is  unlike ManagerS, which will never receive emails unless you add the BrokenlinkemailsMiddleware to  MiDDleWare_ClaSSeS.  to stop email notifications to aDMinS even when DeBUg=False, you can modify Django’s logging  settings, which are described in the logging section in this chapter. You can also leave aDMinS  undefined so no emails are sent out, but that leaves your project with no aDMinS definitions that may  be useful for other purposes.  Use Dynamic Absolute Paths There are some Django variables in settings.py that rely on directory locations, such is the case for   STATIC_ROOT, which defines a consolidation directory for a project’s static files or the DIRS list of the  TEMPLATES variable that defines the location of a project’s templates, among other variables.  The problem with variables that rely on directory locations is that if you run the project on different   servers or share it with other users, it can be difficult to keep track or reserve the same directories across a  series of environments. To solve this issue you can define variables to dynamically determine the absolute  paths of a project. Listing 5-3 illustrates a Django project directory structure, deployed to the  www  system  directory.  Listing 5-3.  Django project structure deployed to  www   +- www +                +--STORE--+                                    +---manage.py                                    +---coffeestatic--+                                     166   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent                                    +- Consolidated static resources                                     +---coffeehouse--+                                                                      +-__init__.py                                   +-settings.py                                   +-urls.py                                   +-wsgi.py                                                                      +---templates---+                                                   +-app_base_template.html                                                   +-app_header_template.html                                                   +-app_footer_template.html  Typically a Django settings.py file would define the values for STATIC_ROOT and DIRS in TEMPLATES as   illustrated in Listing 5-4.  Listing 5-4.  Django settings.py with absolute path values   Other configuration variables omitted for brevity STATIC_ROOT = ' www STORE coffeestatic '   Other configuration variables omitted for brevity TEMPLATES = [ { 'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates', 'DIRS': [' www STORE coffeehouse templates ',], } ]  The issue with the setup in Listing 5-4 is it will require editing if you deploy the Django application to a  server where the  www  directory isn’t available  e.g., due to restrictions or a Windows OS where directories  start with a leading letter C:  .  An easier approach illustrated in Listing 5-5 is to define variables to dynamically determine the absolute   paths of a project.  Listing 5-5.  Django settings.py with dynamically determined absolute path  import os BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__     Other configuration variables omitted for brevity STATIC_ROOT = '%s coffeestatic ' %  BASE_DIR    Other configuration variables omitted for brevity TEMPLATES = [ { 'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates', 'DIRS': ['%s templates '%  PROJECT_DIR ,], } ]  167   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  The variables defined at the top of Listing 5-5 rely on the Python os module to dynamically determine   the absolute system path relative to the settings.py file. The PROJECT_DIR=os.path.dirname os.path. abspath __file__   statement gets translated into the  www STORE coffeehouse  value, which is the  absolute system directory of files like settings.py. And to access the parent of  www STORE coffeehouse   you simply wrap the same statement with another call to os.path.dirname and define the BASE_DIR variable  so it gets translated into the  www STORE  value.  The remaining statements in Listing 5-5 use standard Python string substitution to use the PROJECT_DIR   and BASE_DIR to set the absolute paths in the STATIC_ROOT and TEMPLATE_DIRS variables. In this manner  you don’t need to hard-code the absolute paths for any Django configuration variable; the variables  automatically adjust to any absolute directory irrespective of the application deployment directory.  Use Multiple Environments or Configuration Files for Django In every Django project you’ll eventually come to the realization that you have to split settings.py into  multiple environments or files. This will be either because the values in settings.py need to change  between development and production servers, there are multiple people working on the same project with  different requirements  e.g., Windows and Linux , or you need to keep sensitive settings.py information   e.g., passwords  in a local file that’s not shared with others.  In Django there is no best or standard way to split settings.py into multiple environments or files.   In fact, there are many techniques and libraries to make a Django project run with a split settings.py file.  Next, I’ll present the three most popular options I’ve used in my projects. Depending on your needs you  may feel more comfortable using one option over another or inclusively mixing two or all three of these  techniques to achieve an end solution.  Option 1  Multiple environments in the same settings.py file with a control  variable The settings.py file is treated as an ordinary Python file, so there’s no limitation to using Python libraries or  conditionals to obtain certain behaviors. This means you can easily introduce a control variable based on a  fixed value  e.g., server host name  to conditionally set up certain variable values.  For example, changing the DATABASES variable - because passwords and the database name change   between development and production - changing the EMAIL_BACKEND variable - since you don’t need to send  actual emails in development as you do in production - or changing the CACHES variable - since you don’t  need a cache to speed up performance in development as you need in production.  Listing 5-6 illustrates the setup of a control variable called DJANGO_HOST based on Python’s socket   module; the variable is then used to load different sets of Django variables based on a server’s host name.  Listing 5-6.

Next,   a series of conditionals are declared using socket.gethostname   to determine the value of the control  variable DJANGO_HOST. If the host name starts with the letters live the DJANGO_HOST variable is set to  "production", if the host name starts with test then DJANGO_HOST is set to "testing", and if the host name  starts with neither of the previous options then DJANGO_HOST is set to "development".  In this scenario, the string method startswith is used to determine how to set the control variable   based on the host name. However, you can just as easily use any other Python library or even criteria    e.g., IP address  to set the control variable. In addition, since the control variable is based on a string, you  can introduce as many configuration variations as needed. In this case we use three different variations to  set settings.py variables - "production","testing" and "development" - but you could easily define five  or a dozen variations if you require such an amount of different setups.  Option 2  Multiple environment files using configparser Another variation to split settings.py is to rely on Python's built-in configparser module. configparser  allows Django to read configuration variables from files that use a data structure similar to the one used in  Microsoft Windows INI files. Listing 5-7 illustrates a sample configparser file.  Listing 5-7.  Python configparser sample file production.cfg  [general] DEBUG: false STATIC_URL: http:  static.coffeehouse.com   [databases] NAME: housecoffee ENGINE: django.db.backends.mysql USER: coffee PASSWORD: secretpass  [security] SECRET_KEY: %%ea cjy@v9 7!b 20gl+4-6iur28dy=tc4f$-zbm-v=!t  As you can see in Listing 5-7, the format for a configparser file is structured in various sections declared   between brackets  e.g., [general], [databases]  and below each section are the different keys and values.  The variables in Listing 5-7 represents a production environment placed in a file named production. cfg. I chose the .cfg extension for this file, but you can use the .config or .ini extensions if you like; the  extension is irrelevant to Python – the only thing that matters is the data format in the file itself.  Similar to the contents in production.cfg, you can create other files with different variables for other  environments  e.g., testing.cfg, development.cfg . Once you have the configparser file or files, then you  can import them into a Django settings.py. Listing 5-8 shows a sample settings.py that uses values from  a configparser file.  170   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Listing 5-8.  Django settings.py with configparser import  import os  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__     Access configparser to load variable values from django.utils.six.moves import configparser config = configparser.SafeConfigParser allow_no_value=True    Import socket to read host name import socket  If the host name starts with 'live', load configparser from "production.cfg" if socket.gethostname  .startswith 'live' :     config.read '%s production.cfg' %  PROJECT_DIR    Else if host name starts with 'test', load configparser from "testing.cfg" elif socket.gethostname  .startswith 'test' :     config.read '%s testing.cfg' %  PROJECT_DIR   else:  If host doesn't match, assume it's a development server, load configparser from  "development.cfg"     config.read '%s development.cfg' %  PROJECT_DIR    DEBUG = config.get 'general', 'DEBUG'  STATIC_URL = config.get 'general', 'STATIC_URL'   DATABASES = {     'default': {         'NAME': config.get 'databases', 'NAME' ,         'ENGINE': config.get 'databases', 'ENGINE' ,         'USER': config.get 'databases', 'USER' ,         'PASSWORD': config.get 'databases', 'PASSWORD'      }   }  SECRET_KEY = config.get 'security', 'SECRET_KEY'    the configuration in listing 5-8 assumes the host name starts with the name live in order to load      Note  configparser production.cfg in listing 5-7. adjust conditionals at the start of listing 5-8 to match the host name  and load the appropriate configparser file.  As you can see in Listing 5-8, configparser is loaded into Django via django.utils.six.moves, which is a  utility to allow cross-imports between Python 2 and Python 3. In Python 2 the configparser package is actually  named ConfigParser, but this utility allows us to use the same import statement using either Python 2 or  Python 3. After the import, we use the SafeConfigParser class with the argument allow_no_value=True to  allow processing of empty values in configparser keys.  171   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Then we rely on the same prior technique using Python’s socket module to gain access to the host   name and determine which configparser file to load. The configparser file is loaded using the read method  of the SafeConfigParser instance. At this juncture all configparser variables are loaded and ready for access.  The remainder of Listing 5-8 shows a series of standard Django settings.py variables that are assigned their  value using the get method of the SafeConfigParser instance, where the first argument is the configparser  section and the second argument is the key variable.  So there you have another option on how to split the variables in settings.py into multiple   environments. Like I mentioned at the start, there’s no best or standard way of doing this. Some people like  configparser better because it splits values into separate files and avoids the many conditionals of option 1,  but other people can hate configparser because of the need to deal with the special syntax and separate files.  Choose whatever feels best for your project.  Option 3  Multiple settings.py files with different names for each environment Finally, another option to split Django variables into multiple environments is to create multiple   settings.py files with different names. By default, Django looks for configuration variables in the   settings.py file in a project’s base directory.  However, it’s possible to tell Django to load a configuration file with a different name. Django uses the  operating system  OS  variable DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE for this purpose. By default, Django sets this OS  variable to  .settings in the manage.py file located in the base directory of any Django  project. And since the manage.py file is used to bootstrap Django applications, the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE  value in this file guarantees configuration variables are always loaded from the settings.py file inside the    subdirectory.  So let’s suppose you create different settings.py files for a Django application - placed in the same   directory as settings.py - named production.py, testing.py, and development.py. You have two options  to load these different files.  One option is to change the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE definition in a project’s manage.py file    to the file with the desired configuration  e.g., os.environ.setdefault "DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE",  "coffeehouse.production"  to load the production.py configuration file . However, hard-coding this value  is inflexible because you would need to constantly change the value in manage.py based on the   desired configuration. Here you could use a control variable in manage.py to dynamically determine the  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE value based on a host name - similar to the process described in the previous  option 1 for settings.py.  Another possibility to set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE without altering manage.py is to define    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE at the OS level so it overrides the definition in manage.py. Listing 5-9 illustrates  how to set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable on a Linux Unix OS so that application variables in the  testing.py file are used instead of the settings.py file.  Listing 5-9.  Override DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE to load application variables from a file called testing. py and not the default settings.py  $ export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=coffeehouse.load_testing $ python manage.py runserver Validating models...  0 errors found Django version 1.11, using settings 'coffeehouse.load_testing' Development server is running at http:  127.0.0.1:8000  Quit the server with CONTROL-C.  172   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  In Listing 5-9 we use the standard Linux Unix syntax export variable_name=variable_value to set   an environment variable. Once this is done, notice the Django application that uses the development server  displays the startup message "using settings 'coffeehouse.load_testing'".  If you plan to override the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE at the OS level to load different Django application  variables, be aware that by default OS variables aren’t permanent or inherited. This means you may need to  define the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE for every shell from which you start Django and also define it as a local  variable for runtime environments  e.g., Apache .  Set Up Static Web Page Resources - Images, CSS, JavaScript  The setup process for static resources in Django projects varies considerably if a project runs with  DEBUG=True or DEBUG=False. This means static resource deployment depends on whether you’re doing work  on a development environment - where you generally use DEBUG=True - or on a production environment -  where you generally use DEBUG=False.  Considering you’ll always start a Django project in a development environment and later migrate to a   production environment, I’ll describe the development set up process first and later describe the production  setup process.  Set Up Static Resources in a Development Environment  DEBUG=False  By default when DEBUG=False, Django automatically sets up static resources from two major locations.  The first location is static folders in all Django apps and the second location is folders declared in the  STATICFILES_DIR variable in settings.py.  Although you’ll need to manually create the static folder inside Django apps, it’s this easy to set   up static resources in a project. Because Django sets up all the static folders for every project app, it’s a  recommended practice to further add a subdirectory to the static folder  e.g.,   static <app_ name>    to qualify static resources and avoid potential naming conflicts. Listing 5-10  illustrates a sample directory structure for static resources.  Listing 5-10.

Anything under these static subdirectories is set up for access.  Also notice in Listing 5-10 the importance of the app name subdirectory within the static   subdirectories that acts as a namespace. If static resources were placed directly below the static folder in  all apps, in this scenario it would lead to two identical file paths named  static css custom.css, In which  case a call to load this static resource would lead to a conflict. Technically, Django always uses the first file it  finds, but will the first one be the right one? By using an app name subdirectory inside static it avoids any  potential conflict, with one static resource set up at  static about css custom.css and the other at    static stores css custom.css.  Because there can be static resources that don’t necessarily belong to a specific project app, Django also   supports the ability to set up static resources stored on any subdirectory.  If you look again at Listing 5-10 in between the BASE_DIR and PROJECT_DIR, you’ll see there are various   subfolders that contain popular static resource libraries - jquery, jquery-ui and bootstrap-- as well as a  subfolder website-static-default with a web site’s standard static resources – robots.txt & favicon.ico.  In order to set up these additional static resources, you define the location of these directories in   the STATICFILES_DIR variable in settings.py. Listing 5-11 illustrates an example of a STATICFILES_DIR  definition.  174   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Listing 5-11.  Django STATICFILES_DIR definition with namespaces in settings.py  BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname os.path.dirname os.path.abspath __file__     STATICFILES_DIRS =  '%s website-static-default '%  BASE_DIR ,                      'bootstrap','%s bootstrap-3.1.1-dist '%  BASE_DIR  ,                      'jquery','%s jquery-1-11-1-dist '%  BASE_DIR  ,                      'jquery-ui','%s jquery-ui-1.10.4 '%  BASE_DIR  ,   As you can see in Listing 5-11, STATICFILES_DIRS accepts a list of directories. In this case, all directories   are under a Django project’s BASE_DIR, so it’s using the BASE_DIR variable that dynamically determines  the parent directory. Another aspect of the directory list in Listing 5-11 is you can optionally declare a  namespace, similar to the approach used in an app’s static subdirectories.  The first directory definition in Listing 5-11 is a simple string  i.e., it has no namespace , which means   the static resources in website-static-default is set up with a direct access pattern. The remaining  directory definitions are tuples and not strings. By using a tuple, it defines the first part of the tuple as the  namespace and the second part as the directory with the static resources. Definitions with a namespace  mean that all static resources under a given directory will use a prefix namespace in their access pattern   e.g., to access static resources on bootstrap-3.1.1-dist the access pattern should be prefixed with  bootstrap .  Now that you know where and how to set up all static resources, let’s take a quick look at how Django  visualizes these static resources to understand what the final access patterns for static resources look like.  Listing 5-12 shows a visualization of the static resources presented in the previous listings.  Listing 5-12.  Django visualization of static resources in apps and STATICFILES_DIRS  +-favicon.ico +-robots.txt  +-jquery+        +jquery.min.js  +-jquery-ui+           +jquery-ui.min.js  +-bootstrap+           +-bootstrap.css  +-about-+        +-img-+             +-logo.png                +-css-+              +-custom.css  +-stores-+          +-img-+               +-coffee.gif                    +-css-+                +-custom.css  175   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  The files favicon.ico and robots.txt in Listing 5-12 are in the top level of the visualization because   their source directory - website-static-default - was defined without a namespace in STATICFILES_DIRS.  The remainder of the static resources are all grouped in subfolders because we either defined a   namespace for them in STATICFILES_DIRS or defined a subfolder as a namespace within an app’s static  subdirectory.  Now that you understand how Django visualizes static resources as a group and how this determines the   final access pattern for static resources, let’s turn our attention to the STATIC_URL variable in settings.py.  The STATIC_URL is used to define a URL entry point into Django’s visualization of static resources   presented in Listing 5-12. By default, STATIC_URL is assigned the  static  value. This means that if   STATIC_URL=' static ', the static resource robots.txt becomes accessible at the URL  static robots.txt,  just like stores img coffee.gif becomes accessible at the URL  static stores img coffee.gif.  This means you access static resources on the  static  URL, or on a different URL if you change the  STATIC_URL value. However, don’t go and hard-code these static resources paths on templates!  e.g., <img  src=" static stores img coffee.gif" > . You should use a variable so the final path is determined  dynamically in case STATIC_URL changes. The next section describes how to do this in Django templates.     Caution  DeBUg=true.   automatic access to static resources only works with Django’s built-in web server and when   The previous setup process for static resources has a little ‘behind the scenes’ help from Django. It only   works with Django’s built-in web server  i.e., python manage.py runserver  and only if DEBUG=True. As  soon as you change to a different web server or switch DEBUG=False even using Django’s built-in web server,  no static resource will be available as visualized in Listing 5-12.  The primary reason behind this behavior is because reserving and dispatching static resources from  an application’s main web server URL structure  e.g.,  static   is very inefficient. So this just works as a  convenience in development using Django’s built-in web server and when DEBUG=True. Of course, you can  assign a full URL domain to STATIC_URL  e.g., http:  static.coffeehouse.com   but this assumes you’ve  already set up the project’s static resources on a production-like environment, something that I’ll discuss  shortly once I describe how to access static resources in Django and Jinja templates.  Access Static Resources in Django Templates The recommended approach to reference static resources in Django templates is through staticfiles app via  the {% static %} tag. Listing 5-13 illustrates various examples of the staticfiles app syntax.  Listing 5-13.  Django {% static %} tag to reference static resources  {% load static %}   For static resource at about img logo.png     For static resource at bootstrap bootstrap.css     For static resource at jquery jquery.min.js     176   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  First it’s important to note the {% load static %} tag in Listing 5-13 is available through the staticfiles  app, which is installed by default on all Django projects in the INSTALLED_APPS variable. If for some reason  you modified the default values in INSTALLED_APPS, make sure you have the django.contrib.staticfiles  value in the INSTALLED_APPS variable or none of what follows will work.  As you can see in Listing 5-13, at the top of the template you always declare the {% load static %}   statement. Once this is done, a template can use the {% static %} tag to generate dynamic paths for static  resources. In most circumstances, the {% static %} tag relies on the STATIC_URL variable in settings.py to  generate an appropriate path to the static resources.  For more advanced cases, the {% static %} tag uses a combination of the same STATIC_URL variable  and the backing storage technology  e.g., CDN-‘Content Delivery Network’  configuration to generate an  appropriate path to the static resources.  For example, notice in Listing 5-13 how the {% static %} tag is always followed by a file path    identical to the Django visualization of static resources in Listing 5-12. Due to the STATIC_URL variable  having a value of  static , it means the {% static %} statements in Listing 5-13 get substituted with this  value  e.g., {% static 'bootstrap bootstrap.css' %} becomes  static bootstrap bootstrap.css . The cases where the {% static %} tag gets substituted for something different than the STATIC_URL   variable are when a Django project uses a nonstandard back end to serve static resources - this last scenario  is briefly discussed in the sidebar below.  WHY USE THE STATICFILES {% STATIC %} TAG VS. USING THE   STATIC_URL VARIABLE DIRECTLY IN TEMPLATES?  in the early versions of Django, Django templates used the StatiC_Url variable directly in   templates  e.g.,   . a trace of this remains in the fact that  you can still gain access to the StatiC_Url variable on all Django templates via the django.template. context_processors.static context processor.  however, with the underlying technology to serve static resources becoming more sophisticated, the  StatiC_Url variable by itself proves insufficient. For example, static-serving technologies like CDns  or amazon S3 often use special tokens to enforce authentication or caching strategies. this means a  statement like   needs to be converted into something  like   or <img  src="http:  staticresources.com about img logo32AzTB9r5.gif">. and while it’s possible  to change the StatiC_Url variable to a full domain, what becomes difficult is to modify the static  resource’s path itself.  rewriting a static resource’s path with a tag like {% static %} is easy. Because {% static %} can take  a static resource’s base string  e.g., about img logo.gif  and dynamically produce a full path with the  StatiC_Url variable and any special tokens required by the underlying static-serving technology. this  process is achieved by using a custom storage class – designed for the static-serving technology.   granted not all projects require the use of advanced static-serving technologies. But by using the   {% static %} tag of the staticfiles app to declare static resources in Django templates, you ensure a  Django project is capable of using any static-serving technology, from the most basic to the most  advanced.  177   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Access Static Resources in Jinja Templates Jinja templates offer an alternative to Django’s own templates, as described in the previous chapter. But  unlike Django templates, you’ll have to follow a different setup to use something like Django’s {% static %}  tag from the staticfiles app in Jinja templates.  To be able to use the same staticfiles app   {% static %} tag behavior in Jinja templates, you’ll need   to set up a global variable named static that hooks into this functionality. In the previous chapter on  Jinja template, the section “Set Up Data for Access on All Jinja Templates in Django  like Django Context  Processors ” describes how to create a global variable with this functionality.  Set Up Static Resources in a Production Environment  DEBUG=True  When you switch your Django project’s DEBUG variable to True or change to a different web server    e.g., Apache, Nginx , you’ll be surprised that none of the static resources in your project appear anymore.  Don’t be alarmed, this is by design. It isn’t too difficult to set up Django to serve static resources when  DEBUG=True with Django’s built-in web server or if you switch to a third-party web server.   You can access static resources to make Django’s built-in web server serve static resources as if      Tip  DeBUg=False when it’s actually set to DeBUg=true. run the web server with the --insecure flag: python  manage.py runserver –insecure.     Caution  name itself --insecure wasn’t enough to keep you from using it.   although the previous workaround is available, i recommend you don’t use it, in case the flag   Django’s built-in web server  i.e., python manage.py runserver  is really a convenience tool to get up   and running quickly, which as part of this convenience also serves static resources when DEBUG=False.  However, it really is wasteful to allow the same web server process to handle both dynamic content    Django web pages  and static resources  Images, CSS, JavaScript . The recommended approach is to use a  separate web server entirely to serve static resources, which is why Django goes to the extent of breaking this  convenience in its built-in web server when switching the DEBUG=True.  The first thing you need to do when DEBUG=True is create a directory to hold a copy of all the static resources   Django visualizes as static resources. Previously you learned that when DEBUG=False, Django visualizes static  resources from several locations and subdirectories in a single tree - illustrated in Listing 5-12. It’s precisely this  single tree Django visualizes that you need to create a copy of to run on a production environment.  You’ll need to define the STATIC_ROOT variable in settings.py. The value you assign to STATIC_ROOT  should be a directory and it will be where Django copies all of your project’s static resources - identical to  how Django visualizes them when DEBUG=True as illustrated in Listing 5-12. Note this directory should be  empty, as it’s overwritten constantly each time you perform a syncing process. The location of this directory  could be anywhere on your system depending on your needs. For simplicity, I’ll keep the STATIC_ROOT  directory under the Django project’s BASE_DIR as STATIC_ROOT = '%s coffeestatic '%  BASE_DIR .  To trigger the syncing process  i.e., copy all static resources to STATIC_ROOT , you’ll need to use the   collectstatic command available in the manage.py script. Listing 5-14 illustrates the sample output of the  syncing process.  178   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Listing 5-14.  Django collectstatic command to copy all static resources  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py collectstatic  You have requested to collect static files at the destination location as specified in your settings:       www STORE coffeestatic  This will overwrite existing files!

Once you collect all your project’s static resources in a single folder - in this case  www STORE   coffeestatic - they’re ready to be set up on a production server  e.g., Apache, Nginx, or AWS S3 . Keep in  mind the directory file structure generated by collectstatic is identical to the one visualized by Django in  the previous section illustrated in Listing 5-12.  The final step you need to do is update the STATIC_URL value in settings.py to reflect the new location   of the static resources. For example, if you mount the  www STORE coffeestatic  directory on Apache or  Nginx under the http:  static.coffeehouse.com  domain, you would set STATIC_URL='http:  static. coffeehouse.com'. Similarly, if you copy the static resources in  www STORE coffeestatic  to an Amazon  AWS S3 bucket named http:  coffeehouse.s3.amazonaws.com, you would set STATIC_URL='http:   coffeehouse.s3.amazonaws.com'  Once you make this last change, all the statements in your Django templates that use the {% static %}   tag get updated with this new full-domain URL, in which case a resource like  www STORE coffeestatic  bootstrap bootstrap.css becomes available at http:  static.coffeehouse.com bootstrap bootstrap. css or http:  coffeehouse.s3.amazonaws.com bootstrap bootstrap.css.  Django Logging  Logging is one of the most useful and also one of the most underused application management practices. If  you’re still not using logging in your Django projects or are using Python print   statements to gain insight  into what an application is doing, you’re missing out on a great of functionalities. Up next, you’ll learn about  Python core logging concepts, how to set up Django custom logging, and how to use a monitoring service to  track log messages.  179   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Python Core Logging Concepts Django is built on top of Python’s logging package. The Python logging package provides a robust and  flexible way to set up application logging. In case you’ve never used Python’s logging package, I’ll provide a  brief overview of its core concepts. There are four core concepts in Python logging:   	   	   	  Loggers.- Provide the initial entry point to group log messages. Generally, each  Python module  i.e., .py file  has a single logger to assign its log messages. However,  it’s also possible to define multiple loggers in the same module  e.g., one logger for  business logic, another logger for database logic, etc. . In addition, it’s also possible  to use the same logger across multiple Python modules or .py files.   	 Handlers.- Are used to redirect log messages  created by loggers  to a destination.  Destinations can include flat files, a server’s console, an email or SMS messages,  among other destinations. It’s possible to use the same handler in multiple loggers,  just as it’s possible for a logger to use multiple handlers.  Filters.- Offer a way to apply rules on log messages. For example, you can use a filter  to send log messages generated by the same logger to different handlers.  Formatters.- Are used to specify the final format for log messages.  With this brief overview of Python logging concepts, let’s jump straight into exploring Django’s default   logging functionality.  Django Default Logging The logging configuration for Django projects is defined in the LOGGING variable in settings.py. For the  moment, don’t even bother opening your project’s settings.py file because you won’t see LOGGING in it.  This variable isn’t hard-coded when you create a project, but it does have some logging values in effect if it  isn’t declared. Listing 5-15 shows the default LOGGING values if it isn’t declared in settings.py.  Listing 5-15.  Default LOGGING in Django projects  LOGGING = {     'version': 1,     'disable_existing_loggers': False,     'filters': {         'require_debug_false': {             '  ': 'django.utils.log.RequireDebugFalse',         },         'require_debug_true': {             '  ': 'django.utils.log.RequireDebugTrue',         },     },     'handlers': {         'console': {             'level': 'INFO',             'filters': ['require_debug_true'],             'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',         },         'null': {             'class': 'logging.NullHandler',         },  180   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent          'mail_admins': {             'level': 'ERROR',             'filters': ['require_debug_false'],             'class': 'django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler'         }     },     'loggers': {         'django': {             'handlers': ['console'],         },         'django.request': {             'handlers': ['mail_admins'],             'level': 'ERROR',             'propagate': False,         },         'django.security': {             'handlers': ['mail_admins'],             'level': 'ERROR',             'propagate': False,         },         'py.warnings': {             'handlers': ['console'],         },     } }  In summary, the default Django logging settings illustrated in Listing 5-15 have the following logging   behaviors:   	 Console logging or the console handler is only done when DEBUG=True, for log   messages worse than INFO  inclusive  and only for the Python package django - and  its children  e.g., django.request, django.contrib  - as well as the Python package  py.warnings.   	  Admin logging or the mail_admins handler - which sends emails to ADMINS – is only  done when DEBUG=False, for log messages worse than ERROR  inclusive , and only for  the Python packages django.request and django.security.  Let’s first break down the handlers section in Listing 5-14. Handlers define locations to send log  messages and there are three in Listing 5-14: console, null and mail_admins. The handler names by  themselves do nothing - they are simply reference names - the relevant actions are defined in the associated  properties dictionary. All the handlers have a class property that defines the backing Python class that does  the actual work.  The console handler is assigned the logging.StreamHandler class that is part of the core Python   logging package. This class sends logging output to streams such as standard input and standard error, and  as the handler name suggests, this is technically the system console or screen where Django runs.  The null handler is assigned the logging.NullHandler class, which is also part of the core Python   logging package and which generates no output.  The mail_admins handler is assigned the django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler class, which is  a Django custom handler utility that sends logging output as an email to people defined as ADMINS in  settings.py - see the previous section on setting up settings.py for the real world for more information on  the ADMINS variable.  181   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Another property in handlers is level, which defines the threshold level at which the handler must  accept log messages. There are five threshold levels for Python logging, from worst to least worst they are  CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, and DEBUG. The INFO level for the console handler indicates that all log  messages worse or equal to INFO – which is every level, except DEBUG – should be processed by the handler, a  reasonable setting as the console can handle many messages. The ERROR level for the mail_admins handler  indicates that only messages worse or equal to ERROR – which is just CRITICAL – should be processed by  the handler, a reasonable setting as only the two worst types of error messages should trigger emails to  administrators.  The other property in handlers is filters, which defines an additional layer to restrict log messages   for a handler. Handlers can accept multiple filters, which is why the filters property accepts a Python list.  The console handler has a single filter require_debug_true and the mail_admins handler has a single filter  require_debug_false.  Filters are defined in their own block as you can observe in Listing 5-15. The require_debug_  false filter is backed by the django.utils.log.RequireDebugFalse class, which checks if a Django  project has DEBUG=False, whereas the require_debug_true filter is backed by the django.utils.log. RequireDebugTrue class, which checks if a project has DEBUG=True. This means the console handler only  accepts log messages if a Django project has DEBUG=True and the mail_admins handler only accepts log  messages if a Django project has DEBUG=False.  Now that you understand handlers and filters, let’s take a look at the loggers section. Logger definitions   generally map directly to Python packages and have parent-child relationships. For example, Python  modules  i.e., .py files  that belong to a package named coffeehouse generally have a logger named  coffeehouse and Python modules that belong to the package coffeehouse.about generally have a logger  named coffeehouse.about. The dot notation in logger names also represents a parent-child relationship, so  the coffeehouse.about logger is considered the child of the coffeehouse logger.  In Listing 5-15 there are four loggers: django, django.request, django.security, and py.warnings.   The django logger indicates that all log messages associated with it and its children be processed by the  console handler.  The django.request logger indicates that all log messages associated with it and its children be   processed by the mail_admins handler. The django.request logger also has the 'level':'ERROR' property  to provide the threshold level at which the logger should accept log messages - a property that overrides  the handler level property. And in addition, the django.request logger also has the 'propagate':'False'  statement to indicate the logger should not propagate messages to parent loggers  e.g., django is the parent  of django.request .  Next, we have the django.security logger that is identical in functionality to the django.request   logger. And the py.warnings that indicate that all log messages associated with it and its children be  processed by the console handler.  Finally, there are the first two lines in Listing 5-15 that are associated with Python logging in   general. The version key identifies the configuration version as 1, which at present is the only Python  logging version. And the disable_existing_loggers key is used to disable all existing Python loggers. If  disable_existing_loggers is False it keeps the preexisting logger values and if it’s set to True it disables  all preexisting loggers values. Note that even if you use 'disable_existing_loggers': False in your own  LOGGING variable you can redefine override some or all of the preexisting logger values.  Now that you have a firm understanding of what Django logging does in its default state, I’ll describe   how to create log messages in a Django project and then describe how to create custom LOGGING  configurations.  182   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Create Log Messages At the top of any Python module or .py file you can create loggers by using the getLogger method of the  Python logging package. The getLogger method receives the name of the logger as its input parameter.  Listing 5-16 illustrates the creation of two logger instances using __name__ and the hard-coded dba name.  Listing 5-16.  Define loggers in a Python module   Python logging package import logging   Standard instance of a logger with __name__ stdlogger = logging.getLogger __name__    Custom instance logging with explicit name dbalogger = logging.getLogger 'dba'   The Python __name__ syntax used for getLogger in Listing 5-16 automatically assigns the package name   as the logger name. This means that if the logger is defined in a module under the application directory  coffeehouse about views.py, the logger receives the name coffeehouse.about.views. So by relying on  the __name__ syntax, loggers are automatically created based on the origin of the log message.  Don’t worry about having dozens or hundreds of loggers in a Django project for each module or .py   file. As described in the past section, Python logging works with inheritance, so you can define a single  handler for a parent logger  e.g., coffeehouse  that handles all children loggers  e.g., coffeehouse.about,  coffeehouse.about.views,coffeehouse.drinks, coffeehouse.drinks.models .  Sometimes it’s convenient to define a logger with an explicit name to classify certain types of messages.  In Listing 5-16 you can see a logger named dba that’s used for messages related to databases issues. This way  database administrators can consult their own logging stream without the need to see log messages from  other parts of the application.  Once you have loggers in a module or .py file, you can define log messages with one of several methods   depending on the severity of a message that needs to be reported. These methods are illustrated in the  following list:   	   	   	   	   	   	  	   .critical  .- Most severe logging level. Use it to report potentially  catastrophic application events  e.g., something that can halt or crash an  application .   .error  .- Second most severe logging level. Use it to report important  events  e.g., unexpected behaviors or conditions that cause end users to see an  error .   .warning  .- Mid-level logging level. Use it to report relatively  important events  e.g., unexpected behaviors or conditions that shouldn’t happen,  yet don’t cause end users to notice the issue .   .info  .- Informative logging level. Use it to report informative events  in an application  e.g., application milestones or user activity .   .debug  .- Debug logging level. Use it to report step-by-step logic that  can be difficult to write  e.g., complex business logic or database queries .   .log  .- Use it to manually emit log messages with a specific log level.   .exception  .- Use it to create an error level logging message,  wrapped with the current exception stack.  183   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  What methods you use to log messages across your project depends entirely up to you. As far as the   logging levels are concerned, just try to be consistent with the selection criteria. You can always adjust the  runtime logging level to deactivate log messages of a certain level.  In addition, I would also recommend you use the most descriptive log messages possible to maximize   the benefits of logging. Listing 5-17 illustrates a series of examples using several logging methods and  messages.  Listing 5-17.  Define log messages in a Python module   Python logging package import logging   Standard instance of a logger with __name__ stdlogger = logging.getLogger __name__    Custom instance logging with explicit name dbalogger = logging.getLogger 'dba'   def index request :     stdlogger.debug "Entering index method"   def contactform request :     stdlogger.info "Call to contactform method"       try:          stdlogger.debug "Entering store_id conditional block"            Logic to handle store_id     except Exception, e:          stdlogger.exception e       stdlogger.info "Starting search on DB"      try:          stdlogger.info "About to search db"            Loging to search db     except Exception, e:          stdlogger.error "Error in searchdb method"           dbalogger.error "Error in searchdb method, stack %s" %  e    As you can see in Listing 5-17, there are various log messages of different levels using both loggers   described in Listing 5-16. The log messages are spread out depending on their level in either the method  body or inside try except blocks.  If you place the loggers and logging statements like the ones in Listing 5-17 in a Django project, you’ll  see that logging-wise nothing happens! In fact, what you’ll see in the console are messages in the form 'No  handlers could be found for logger ... '.  This is because by default Django doesn’t know anything about your loggers! It only knows about the  default loggers described in Listing 5-15. In the next section, I’ll describe how to create a custom LOGGING  configuration so you can see your project log messages.  184   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Custom Logging Since there are four different components you can mix and match in Django logging  i.e., loggers,  handlers, filters, and formatters , there is an almost endless amount of variations to create custom logging  configurations.  In the following sections, I’ll describe some of the most common custom logging configuration for  Django projects, which include overriding default Django logging behaviors  e.g., not sending emails ,  customizing the format of log messages, and sending logging output to different loggers  e.g., files .  Listing 5-18 illustrates a custom LOGGING configuration you would place in a project’s settings.py file,   covering these common requirements. The sections that follow explain each configuration option.  Listing 5-18.  Custom LOGGING Django configuration  LOGGING = {     'version': 1,     'disable_existing_loggers': True,     'filters': {         'require_debug_false': {             '  ': 'django.utils.log.RequireDebugFalse',         },         'require_debug_true': {             '  ': 'django.utils.log.RequireDebugTrue',         },     },     'formatters': {         'simple': {             'format': '[% asctime s] % levelname s % message s',             'datefmt': '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'         },         'verbose': {              'format': '[% asctime s] % levelname s [% name s.% funcName s:% lineno d]   % message s',              'datefmt': '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'         },     },     'handlers': {         'console': {             'level': 'DEBUG',             'filters': ['require_debug_true'],             'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',             'formatter': 'simple'         },         'development_logfile': {             'level': 'DEBUG',             'filters': ['require_debug_true'],             'class': 'logging.FileHandler',             'filename': ' tmp django_dev.log',             'formatter': 'verbose'         },         'production_logfile': {             'level': 'ERROR',             'filters': ['require_debug_false'],  185   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent              'class': 'logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler',             'filename': ' var log django django_production.log',             'maxBytes' : 1024*1024*100,  100MB             'backupCount' : 5,             'formatter': 'simple'         },         'dba_logfile': {             'level': 'DEBUG',             'filters': ['require_debug_false','require_debug_true'],             'class': 'logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler',             'filename': ' var log dba django_dba.log',             'formatter': 'simple'         },     },     'root': {         'level': 'DEBUG',         'handlers': ['console'],     },     'loggers': {         'coffeehouse': {             'handlers': ['development_logfile','production_logfile'],          },         'dba': {             'handlers': ['dba_logfile'],         },         'django': {             'handlers': ['development_logfile','production_logfile'],         },         'py.warnings': {             'handlers': ['development_logfile'],         },     } }     Caution  of the Django process has file access permissions.   When using logging files, ensure the destination folder exists  e.g.,  var log dba   and the owner   Disable default Django logging configuration The 'disable_existing_loggers':True statement at the top of Listing 5-18 disables Django’s default logging  configuration from Listing 5-15. This guarantees no default logging behavior is applied to a Django project.  An alternative to disabling Django’s default logging behavior is to override the default logging   definitions on an individual basis, as any explicit LOGGING configuration in settings.py takes precedence  over Django defaults even when 'disable_existing_loggers':False. For example, to apply a different  behavior to the console logger  e.g., output messages for debug level, instead of default info level  you can  define a handler in settings.py for console with a debug level – as shown in Listing 5-18.  However, if you want to ensure no default logging configuration inadvertently ends up in a Django   project, you must set 'disable_existing_loggers' to True. Because Listing 5-18 sets 'disable_existing_  186   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  loggers':True, notice the same default filters from Listing 5-15 are re-declared, since the default filters are  lost on account of 'disable_existing_loggers':True.  Logging formatters: Message output By default, Django doesn’t define a logging formatters section as you can confirm in Listing 5-15. However,  Listing 5-18 declares a formatters section to generate log messages with either a simpler or more verbose  output.  By default, all Python log messages follow the format % levelname s:% name s:% message s, which   means "Output the log message level, followed by the name of the logger and the log message itself."  However, there is a lot more information available through Python logging that can make log messages  more comprehensive. As you can see in Listing 5-18, the simple and verbose formatters use a special syntax  and a series of fields that are different from the default. Table 5-2 illustrates the different Python formatter  fields including their syntax and meaning.  Table 5-2.  Python logging formatter fields  Field syntax  Description  % levelname s  % name s % levelno s  Name of the logger  logging channel  Numeric logging level for the message  DEBUG, INFO,WARNING, ERROR,  CRITICAL  Text logging level for the message  "DEBUG", "INFO","WARNING", "ERROR",  "CRITICAL"  Full pathname of the source file where the logging call was issued  if available  Filename portion of pathname Module  name portion of filename  Source line number where the logging call was issued  if available  Function name Time when the log record was created  time.time   return value  Textual time when the log record was created Millisecond portion of the creation time  % pathname s % filename s % module s % lineno d % funcName s % created f % asctime s % msecs d % relativeCreated d Time in milliseconds when the log record was created,relative to the time the   % thread d % threadName s % process d  logging module was loaded  typically at application startup time  Thread ID  if available  Thread name  if available  Process ID  if available   % message s  The result of record.getMessage  , computed just as the record is emitted  You can add or remove fields to the format field for each formatter based on the fields in Yable 5-2.  Besides the format field for each formatter, there’s also a datefmt field that allows you to customize the  output of the % asctime s format field in formatter e.g., with the datefmt field set to %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S, if  a logging message occurs on midnight New Year’s 2018, % asctime  outputs 2018-01-01 00:00:00 .  187   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent     Note    the syntax for the datefmt field follows python’s strftime   format.2  Logging handlers: Locations, classes, filters, and logging thresholds The first handler in Listing 5-18 is the console handler, which provides custom behavior over the default  console handler Listing 5-15. The console handler in Listing 5-18 raises the log level to the DEBUG level to  process all log messages irrespective of their level. In addition, the console handler uses the custom simple  formatter – described in the past section – and uses the same default console filters and class, which tells  Django to process log messages when DEBUG=True  i.e., 'filters': ['require_debug_true']  and send  logging output to a stream  i.e., 'class': 'logging.StreamHandler' .  In Listing 5-18, you can also see there are three different class values for each of the remaining   handlers: logging.FileHandler, which sends log messages to a standard file; logging.handlers. RotatingFileHandler, which sends log messages to files that change based on a given threshold size; and  logging.handlers.WatchedFileHandler, which sends log messages to a file that’s managed by a third-party  utility  e.g., logrotate .  The development_logfile handler is configured to work for log messages worse than DEBUG  inclusive   - which is technically all log messages - and only when DEBUG=True due to the require_debug_true filter. In  addition, the development_logfile handler is set to use the custom verbose formatter and send output to  the  tmp django_dev.log file.  The production_logfile handler is configured to work for log messages worse than ERROR     inclusive  - which is just ERROR and CRITICAL log messages - and only when DEBUG=False due to the  require_debug_false filter. In addition, the handler uses the custom simple formatter and is set to send  output to the file  var log django_production.log. The log file is rotated every time a log file   reaches 100 MB  i.e., maxBytes  and old log files are backed up to backupCount by appending a number    e.g., django_production.log.1,django_production.log.2 .  The dba_logfile is configured to work for log messages worse than DEBUG  inclusive  - which is   technically all log messages - and when DEBUG=True or DEBUG=False due to the require_debug_true and  require_debug_false filters. In addition, the handler uses the custom simple formatter and is set to send  output to the file  var log django_dba.log.  The dba_logfile handler is managed by the WatchedFileHandler class, which has a little more   functionality than the basic FileHandler class used by the development_logfile handler. The  WatchedFileHandler class is designed to check if a file changes, if it changes a file is reopened; this in  turn allows a log file to be managed changed by a Linux log utility like logrotate. The benefit of a log  utility like logrotate is that it allows Django to use more elaborate log file features  e.g., compression,  date rotation . Note that if you don’t use a third-party utility like logrotate to manage a logfile that uses  WatchedFileHandler, a log file grows indefinitely.     Caution Tip  applications. Use the Concurrentloghandler logging handler class3 to run on multi-process applications.   the rotatingFilehandler logging handler class in listing 5-18 is not safe for multi-process   2https:  docs.python.org 3 library time.htmltime.strftime 3https:  pypi.python.org pypi ConcurrentLogHandler 0.9.1  188   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent   the core python logging package includes many other logging handler classes to process messages      Tip  with things like Unix syslog, email  SMtp , and http.4  Logging loggers: Python packages to use logging The loggers section in Listing 5-18 defines the handlers to attach to Python packages – technically the  attachment is done to logger names, but I used this term since loggers are generally named after Python  packages. I’ll provide an exception to this ‘Python package=logger name’ shortly so you can gain a better  understanding of this concept.  The first logger coffeehouse tells Django to attach all the log messages for itself and its children  e.g.,  coffeehouse.about, coffeehouse.about.views and coffeehouse.drinks  to the development_logfile  and production_logfile handlers. By assigning two handlers, log messages from the coffeehouse logger   and its children  are sent to two places.  Recall that by using Python's __name__ syntax to define loggers – see Listing 5-16 and 5-17 – the name of   the loggers end up being based on the Python package structure.  Next, you can see the dba logger links all its log messages to the dba_logfile handler. In this case, it’s an   exception to the rule that loggers are named after Python packages. As you can see in Listing 5-17, a logger  can be purposely named dba and forgo using __name__ or another convention related to Python packages.  Next, the django and py.warnings loggers are re-declared to obtain some of Django’s default behavior,  given Listing 5-18 uses 'disable_existing_loggers': True. The django logger links all its log messages to  the development_logfile and production_logfile handlers, since we want log messages associated with  the django package logger and its children  e.g., django.request, django.security  to go to two log files.  Notice Listing 5-18 doesn’t declare explicit loggers for django.request and django.security unlike the   Django default’s in Listing 5-15. Because the django logger automatically handles its children and we don’t  need different handlers for each logger – like the default logging behavior – Listing 5-18 just declares the  django logger.  At the end of Listing 5-18, the py.warnings logger links all its log messages to the development_logfile   handler, to avoid any trace of py.warnings log messages in production logs.  Finally, there’s the root key in Listing 5-18, which although declared outside of the loggers section,  is actually the root logger for all loggers. The root key tells Django to process messages from all loggers –  whether declared or undeclared in the configuration – and handle them in a given in way. In this case, root  tells Django that all log messages – since the DEBUG level includes all messages – generated by any logger   coffeehouse, dba, django, py.warnings or any other  be processed by the console handler.  Disable email to ADMINS on errors You may be surprised Listing 5-18 makes no use of the mail_admins handler defined by default in Listing 5-15.  As I mentioned in the previous section on Django default logging, the mail_admins handler sends an email  error notification for log messages generated by django.request or django.security   packages loggers.  While this can seem like an amazing feature at first – avoiding the hassle of looking through log    files - once a project starts to grow it can become extremely inconvenient. The problem with the default  logging email error notification mechanism or mail_admins handler is it sends out an email every single time  an error associated with django.request or django.security packages loggers is triggered.  4https:  docs.python.org 3 library logging.handlers.html  189   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  If you have 100 visitors per hour on a Django site and all of them hit the same error, it means 100 email   notifications are sent in the same hour. If you have 3 people in ADMINS, then it means at least 300 email  notifications per hour. All this can add up quickly, so a couple of different errors and a few thousand visitors  a day can lead to email overload. So as convenient as it can appear to get email log error notifications, you  should turn this feature off.  I recommend you stick to the old method on inspecting log files on a constant basis or if you require the   same real-time log error notifications provided by email, that you instead use a dedicated reporting system  such as Sentry, which is described in the next section.  Logging with Sentry As powerful a discovery mechanism as logging is, inspecting and making sense of log messages can be  an arduous task. Django and Python projects are no different in this area. As it was shown in the previous  section, relying on core logging packages still results in log messages being sent to either the application  console or files, where making sense of log messages  e.g., the most relevant or common log message  can  lead to hours of analysis.  Enter Sentry, a reporting and aggregation application. Sentry facilitates the inspection of log messages   through a web-based interface, where you can quickly determine the most relevant and common log  messages.  To use Sentry you need to follow two steps: set up Sentry to receive your project log messages, and set   up your Django project to send log messages to Sentry.  WHY SENTRY?  although there are alternatives that offer similar log monitoring functionalities as Sentry  e.g., overops,  airbrake, raygun , what sets Sentry apart is that it’s built as a Django application!  even though Sentry has evolved considerably to the point it’s now a very complex Django application,  the fact that Sentry is an open source project based on Django, makes it an almost natural option to  monitor Django projects, since you can install and extend it using your Django knowledge – albeit there  are software-as-service Sentry alternatives.  Set up Sentry the application You can set up Sentry in two ways: install it yourself or use a software-as-service Sentry provider.  Sentry is a Django open source project, so the full source code is freely available to anyone.5 But   before you go straight to download Sentry and proceed with the installation,6 beware Sentry has grown  considerably from its Django roots. Sentry now requires a Docker environment, the relational Postgres  database, and the NoSQL Redis database. Unfortunately, Sentry evolved to support a wide variety of  programming languages and platforms, to the point it grew in complexity and is no longer a simple Django  app installation. So if you install Sentry from scratch, expect to invest a couple of hours setting it up.  5https:  github.com getsentry sentry 6https:  docs.sentry.io server installation   190   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent   earlier Sentry releases  e.g., v. 5.07  don’t have such strict dependencies and can run like basic Django      Tip  applications  e.g., any Django relational database, no Docker, no noSQl database . they represent a good  option for simple Sentry installations, albeit they require dated Django versions  e.g., v. Django 1.4 .  The Sentry creators and maintainers run the software-as-a-service: https:  sentry.io. The Sentry   software-as-a-service offers three different plans: a hobbyist plan that’s free for up to 10,000 events per  month and is designed for one user; a professional plan that’s $12  USD  a month, which starts at 50,000  events per month and is designed for unlimited users; and an enterprise plan with custom pricing for  millions of events and unlimited users.  Since you can set up Sentry for free in a few minutes with just your email – and no credit card – the  Sentry software-as-a-service from https:  sentry.io is a good option to try out Sentry. And even after  trying it out, at a cost of $12  USD  per month for 50,000 events and $0.00034 per additional event, it  represents a good value – considering an application that generates 50,000 events per month should have a  considerable audience to justify the price.  Once you create a sentry.io account you’ll enter into the main dashboard. Create a new Django project.   Take note of the client key or DSN, which is a long url that contains the @sentry.io snippet in it – this is  required to configure Django projects to send log messages to this particular Sentry Django project. If you  missed the project client key or DSN, click on the top right ‘Project Settings’ button illustrated in Figure 5-1,  and select the bottom left option ‘Client Keys  DSN ’ to consult the value.  Figure 5-1.  Sentry SaaS project dashboard  7https:  github.com getsentry sentry releases tag 5.0.21  191   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  As you can see in Figure 5-1, the Sentry SaaS project dashboard acts as a central repository to consult all   project logging activity. In Figure 5-1 you can also see the various action buttons, which allow log messages  to be sorted, searched, charted, as well as managed by different users. All of this creates a very efficient  environment in which to analyze any Django logging activity in real time.  Once you have Sentry set up, you can configure a Django project to send log messages to a Django project.  Set up a Django application to use Sentry To use Sentry in a Django project you require a package called Raven to establish communication between  the two parties. Simply do pip install raven to install the latest Raven version.  Once you install Raven, you must declare it in the INSTALLED_APPS list of your project’s settings.py  file as illustrated in Listing 5-19. In addition, it’s also necessary to configure Raven to communicate with a  specific Sentry project via a DSN value, through the RAVEN_CONFIG variable also shown in Listing 5-19.  Listing 5-19.  Django project configuration to communicate with Sentry via Raven  INSTALLED_APPS = [     ...     'raven.contrib.django.raven_compat',     ... ]  RAVEN_CONFIG = {     'dsn': ' @sentry.io  ', }  As you can see in Listing 5-19, the RAVEN_CONFIG variable should declare a dsn key with a value   corresponding to the DSN value from the Sentry project that’s to receive the log messages.  After you set up this minimum Raven configuration, you can send a test message running the python  manage.py raven test command from a Django project’s command line. If the test is successful, you will  see a test message in the Sentry dashboard presented in Figure 5-1.  Once you confirm communication between your Django project and Sentry is successful, you    can set up Django logging to send log messages to Sentry. To Django’s logging mechanism, Sentry is seen as  any other handler  e.g., file, stream , so you must first declare Sentry as a logging handler using the   raven.contrib.django.handlers.SentryHandler class, as illustrated in Listing 5-20.  Listing 5-20.  Django logging handler for Sentry Raven  LOGGING = { ...  'handlers': {        ....         'sentry': {             'level': 'ERROR',             'class': 'raven.contrib.django.handlers.SentryHandler',         },        ...   }  192   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  The sentry handler in Listing 5-20 tells Django to handle log messages with an ERROR level through   Sentry. Once you have a Sentry handler, the last step is to use the sentry handler on loggers to assign which  packages loggers get processed through Sentry  e.g., django.request or root logger, as described in the  earlier “Logging Loggers” section .  Django Email Service  Email has become a staple of practically all applications that live on the Web. Whether an application  requires sending email for signup purposes, notifications, or confirming a purchase, it’s hard to imagine a  web application that doesn’t require some kind of email functionality.  For Django projects, there are two main aspects associated with setting up email. The first step is setting   up the connection to an email server and the second is the composition of emails.  Set Up a Default Connection to an Email Server Django supports connections to any email server and also offers various options to simulate email server  connections. Email simulation is particularly powerful during development and testing where sending out  real emails is unnecessary. The setup for an email server in Django is done in settings.py. Depending on  the email server connection, you may need to set up several variables in settings.py. Table 5-3 illustrates  various email server options for Django.  Table 5-3.  Django email server configurations  Django email backend Configuration  For development  DEBUG=True  Console Email  File Email  In memory Email  Nullify Email  Python Email Server  Simulator  EMAIL_BACKEND=‘django.core.mail. backends.console.EmailBackend’ EMAIL_BACKEND=‘django.core.mail. backends.filebased.EmailBackend’ EMAIL_FILE_PATH=‘ tmp django-email-dev’ EMAIL_BACKEND=‘django.core.mail. backends.locmem.EmailBackend’  EMAIL_BACKEND=‘django.core.mail. backends.dummy.EmailBackend’ EMAIL_BACKEND=‘django.core.mail. backends.smtp.EmailBackend’ EMAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1 EMAIL_PORT=2525 Also needed is the Python command line  email server: python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer  localhost:2525  Description   Notes  Sends all email output to the  console where Django is running. Sends all email output to a flat file  specified in EMAIL_FILE_PATH.  Sends all email output to an in  memory attribute available at  django.core.mail.outbox. Does nothing with all email  output. Sends all email output to a Python  email server set up via command  line. This is similar to the Console  Email option, because the Python  email server outputs content to  the console.   continued   193   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Table 5-3.   continued  Django email backend Configuration  For production  DEBUG=False  SMTP Email Server   Standard   Description   Notes  Sends all email output to a SMTP  email server.

If your SMTP server doesn’t require authentication you can omit EMAIL_HOST_USER and   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD. * The terms SSL and TLS are often used interchangeably or in conjunction with each other  TLS SSL . There  are differences, though, in terms of their underlying protocol. From a Django setup prescriptive, you only need  to ensure what type of secure email server you connect to, as they operate differently and on different ports.  Whichever email connection you set up from Table 5-3 in settings.py is considered a Django project’s   default and is used when doing any email-related task – unless you specify otherwise when doing an email task.  Set Up a Default Connection to Third-Party Email Providers The previous section provided the most generic approach to set up a default connection to an email server  in Django. However, with the complexities involved in running email servers in today’s world – namely,  spam filtering and security issues - it can be easier and more practical to use a third-party service to relay  email from a Django project to the outside world.  Although you can use the previous section’s configurations to connect to any third-party email service,   there can be certain subtleties to set up configurations to third-party email services. In this section I’ll  provide the Django configuration details for what I consider three of the most popular third-party email  services.  194   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  DJANGO WITH EXIM, POSTFIX, OR SENDMAIL  although you can set up Django to deliver email to a local email application  i.e., running on 127.0.0.1   such as exim, postfix, or Sendmail, which then deliver email to third-party providers. i personally would  not recommend this alternative as it adds another component to set up, maintain, and worry about.   not to mention this is beyond the scope of Django, as it involves setting up different email apps with  third-party email services.  this following section describes how to set up Django to connect directly with third-party email  providers.  Email with Google Gmail Google Apps Google offers the ability to send out email through Gmail or Google Apps, the last of which is a Gmail version  for custom domains  e.g., coffeehouse.com  . Once you have a Gmail or Google Apps account, you’ll need to  set up the account’s username password credentials in settings.py.  You will not be able to use Google’s email services without hard-coding your account credentials   somewhere in your app. If you are weary of hard-coding the username password credentials in   settings.py, I suggest you create a separate account for this purpose to limit vulnerabilities, look into using  multiple environments or configuration files for Django to keep the username password in a different file, or  set up a local email server with the credentials as described in the previous sidebar.  Listing 5-21 illustrates the configuration needed to set up Django to send email via a Gmail or Google   Apps account.  Listing 5-21.  Django email configuration for Gmail or Google Apps account  EMAIL_BACKEND='django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend' EMAIL_HOST='smtp.gmail.com' EMAIL_PORT=587 EMAIL_HOST_USER='username@gmail.com OR username@coffeehouse.com' EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='password' EMAIL_USE_TLS=True  As you can see in Listing 5-21, the configuration parameters are pretty similar to those described in   Table 5-3. This is all you need to set up a default email connection to Gmail or Google Apps in Django.     Caution   Beware of sending too much email with google. Since google’s email service is free, it’s not  designed for relaying too many email messages. if your Django app sends out a couple of email messages  every hour you probably won’t have a problem, but if your app sends out email messages every second or  hundreds of email messages in the span of a few minutes, the account is likely to be blocked. if the account is  blocked, you will either need to wait a few hours or manually log into the account  i.e., via a browser  for it to  be unblocked. if the account is constantly blocked due to the email volume you send out, you should try another  email service provider.  195   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent   google overwrites the From: email field with the google account value, unless it’s added as an alias.      Note  Django allows you to set an email’s From: field to any value you want and defaults to the eMail_hoSt_USer  value in settings.py. however, to avoid spoofing, google overwrites this field to the google account email if the  From: email value is not an alias in the gmail or google app account. this means if you send an email message  in Django with From: support@coffeehouse.com and this email is not set up as an alias in the gmail or google  app account, the final email appears with From: set to the google account’s main email.  Email with Amazon Simple Email Service  SES  SES is another email service offered by AWS, which is run by Amazon.com. Unlike Google’s email service, SES  is a paid service with an average cost of 0.0001 cents per email  10 cents per 1000 emails . The easiest way to set  up Django with SES is through the Python library boto and a custom Django email back end called django-ses.  Listing 5-22 illustrates the pip requirements to install boto, which is a library to integrate multiple AWS services   using Python and django-ses, which is an open source project specifically designed to run SES with Django.  Listing 5-22.  Python pip requirements for Amazon.com SES with Django  pip install boto pip install django-ses  Once you install the Python packages in Listing 5-22 using pip, you can proceed to configure SES in   settings.py. Listing 5-23 illustrates the necessary variables to set up Django to use SES.  Listing 5-23.  Django email configuration for Amazon.com SES  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django_ses.SESBackend' AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = 'FZINISSZ3542DPIO32CQ' AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = '3Nto4vknl+xeZR+1tF3L645EUyOS+zZy uPJ1rN'  As you can see in Listing 5-23, the variable EMAIL_BACKEND is set to the custom class    django_ses.SESBackend, which provides all the necessary hooks to connect to SES.  To connect to SES you’ll also need to provide the variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, which are access credentials related to your AWS account. These last values are  provided in your AWS account..8  This is all you need to set up a default email connection to Amazon Simple Email Service  SES . There’s  no need to set up any other variable in settings.py, such as EMAIL_HOST or EMAIL_HOST_USER – everything is  taken care of by the custom email back end.  Email with SparkPost SparkPost is another third-party email service used by large companies like Twitter, Oracle, and PayPal.  Pricing wise SparkPost is a mix between the two previous services; it’s a free service for the first 100,000   emails per month, but after this volume it’s a paid service with an average cost of .0002 cents per email    20 cents per next 1000 emails per month  and lower per email rates once you send 1 million emails a month. The easiest way to set up Django with SparkPost is directly in settings.py. Listing 5-24 illustrates the   necessary variables to set up Django to use SparkPost.  8http:  docs.aws.amazon.com general latest gr aws-sec-cred-types.htmlaccess-keys-and-secret-  access-keys  196   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Listing 5-24.  Django email configuration for SparkPost  EMAIL_BACKEND='django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend' EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sparkpostmail.com' EMAIL_PORT = 587 EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'SMTP_Injection' EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ' ' EMAIL_USE_TLS = True  As you can see in Listing 5-24, the configuration parameters are pretty similar to those described in   Table 5-3 for a standard email connection. Just notice that in addition to the EMAIL_HOST_USER value being  SMTP_Injection – a SparkPost requirement – you’ll also need to assign a SparkPost API key to the   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD. The SparkPost API key is created in your SparkPost account.9  Now that you understand the various ways to set up an email connection in a Django project, let’s   explore the actual composition of emails.  Built-In Helpers to Send Email There can be many options and steps involved in sending an email. To simplify this process, Django offers  four shortcut methods you can leverage anywhere in an application  e.g., when a signup is made, when a  purchase is made, when a critical error occurs . Table 5-4 illustrates the various email shortcut methods.  Table 5-4.  Django email shortcut methods  Shortcut method   and description  Shortcut method   with all arguments*  Argument descriptions and notes  send_mail is the  most common  option to send  email.  send_mail subject,  message, from_ email=settings. DEFAULT_ FROM_EMAIL,  recipient_list,  fail_silently=False,  auth_user=None,  auth_ password=None,  connection=None,  html_ message=None   subject.- Email subject string. message.- Email message string. from_email.- Email From: field. If not provided it's set to  DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL from settings.py that by default is  webmaster@localhost. recipient_list.- Email recipients as a list of strings. fail_silently.- Offers the ability to bypass errors if email cannot be  sent. By default set to False, which means any error when attempting  to send email raises an smtplib.SMTPException exception. auth_user.- Authentication user for the SMTP server. If provided it  overrides the variable EMAIL_HOST_USER in settings.py. auth_password.- Authentication password for the SMTP server. If  provided it overrides the variable EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD in  settings.py. connection.- Django emails back end to send the mail. If provided  it overrides the variable EMAIL_BACKEND in settings.py. See  Table 5-3 for options. html_message.- An HTML string to send an HTML and text   email message. If provided, the resulting email is a   multipart alternative email with message as the text plain content  type and html_message as the text html content type.   continued   197  9https:  support.sparkpost.com customer portal articles 1933377-create-api-keys   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Table 5-4.   continued  Shortcut method   and description  Shortcut method   with all arguments*  send_mass_ mail datatuple,  fail_silently=False,  auth_user=None,  auth_ password=None,  connection=None   Argument descriptions and notes  datatuple.- Is a tuple that contains tuples representing an email  structure in the form  subject, message, from_email=settings. DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, recipient_list .  Email is sent with a From: field set to the variable SERVER_ EMAIL in settings.py that by default is root@localhost. The email  subject is prefixed with the variable EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX in  settings.py which by default is '[Django]'.  Email is sent with a From: field set to the variable SERVER_ EMAIL in settings.py which by default is root@localhost. The  email subject is prefixed with the variable EMAIL_SUBJECT_ PREFIX in settings.py which by default is '[Django]'.  mail_ admins subject,  message, fail_ silently=False,  connection=None,  html_ message=None   mail_ managers subject,  message, fail_ silently=False,  connection=None,  html_ message=None   * Method arguments without a default value  e.g. subject,message  must always be provided. Method  arguments with a default value  e.g. fail_silently=False, connection=None  are optional.  if you start to get emails with error messages once a project goes into production  i.e.DeBUg=False ,      Note  it’s because the mail_admins shortcut is automatically hooked-up for this purpose. this is due to the way  Django’s default logging works. to disable this behavior you will either need to clear all values from aDMinS in  settings.py or override the default logging behavior as described in the previous section on logging.  send_mass_mail is  more efficient than  the send_mail  method. This  is the preferred  choice when  sending multiple  emails because  it opens a single  connection to the  email server and  sends all messages  contained in  a tuple. Note  however send_ mass_mail does  not support HTML  messages like  send_mail. mail_admins  sends email to  all users defined  in the ADMINS  variable in  settings.py.  mail_managers  sends email to all  users defined in  the MANAGERS  variable in  settings.py.  198   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Custom Email: Attachments, Headers, CC, BCC, and More with  EmailMessage Although the previous email shortcut methods can be used under most circumstances, they do not support  things like attachments, CC, BCC, or other email headers. If you want total control for sending email  messages in Django, the previous shortcut methods won’t work.  Used ‘under-the-hood’ by the previous Django shortcut methods and offering the utmost flexibility for  sending email in Django is the Django EmailMessage class. The various parameters and methods supported  by the EmailMessage class are described in Table 5-5.  Table 5-5.  Django EmailMessage class parameters and methods  Parameter and or method  Description  subject body from_email  to cc  bcc  connection  attachments  headers  message    recipients    send fail_silently=False   The subject line of the email. The body text as a plain text message. The sender's address. Both plain email  e.g., webmaster@coffeehouse.com   and full name with email  e.g., Webmaster     format are acceptable. If omitted, the DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL value from  settings.py is used. A list or tuple of recipient addresses. A list or tuple of recipient addresses used in the the email CC header when  sending the email. A list or tuple of addresses used as the email BCC header when sending the  email. An email back-end instance. Use this parameter if you want to use the same  connection for multiple messages. If omitted, a new connection is created  when send   is called. A list of attachments to put on the message. These can be either email. MIMEBase.MIMEBase instances, or  filename, content, mimetype  triples. A dictionary of extra headers to put on the message. The keys are the header  name, values are the header values. It's up to the caller to ensure header  names and values are in the correct format for an email message. The  corresponding attribute is extra_headers. Sends the message. If a connection was specified when the email was  constructed, that connection is used. Otherwise, an instance of the default  backend is instantiated and used. If the keyword argument fail_silently is  True, exceptions raised while sending the message are omitted. An empty list  of recipients does not raise an exception. Useful when extending the EmailMessage class to override and put the content  you want into the MIME object. Constructs a django.core.mail.SafeMIMEText  object  a subclass of Python's email.MIMEText.MIMEText class  or a django. core.mail.SafeMIMEMultipart object holding the message to be sent. Useful when extending the EmailMessage class because the SMTP server  needs to be told the full list of recipients when the message is sent. It returns a  list of all the recipients of the message, whether they're recorded in the to, cc,  or bcc attributes.   continued  199   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Table 5-5.   continued  Parameter and or method  Description  attach    attach_file    Creates a file attachment and adds it to the message. There are two ways to  call attach  . You can pass it a single argument that is an email.MIMEBase. MIMEBase instance that gets inserted directly into the resulting message  or you can passs it three arguments: filename, content, and mimetype  e.g.,  message.attach 'menu.png', img_data, 'image png' , where filename is the  name of the file attachment as it will appear in the email, content is the data  that will be contained inside the attachment, and mimetype is the optional  MIME type for the attachment. If you omit mimetype, the MIME content  type is guessed from the filename of the attachment.  Creates an attachment using a file from the filesystem. It can be called with  the path of the file to attach  e.g., message.attach_file ' images menu.png'   and optionally with the MIME type to use for the attachment  e.g., message. attach_file ' images menu.png','image png' . If the MIME type is omitted,  it’s guessed from the filename.  With a clear idea of the functionalities provided by the EmailMessage classs in Table 5-5, let’s take a look   at some typical cases where you would use the EmailMessage class to send email.  Listing 5-25 provides a basic email example that uses options like CC, BCC. and the Reply-To header,   which aren’t support via the Django email shortcuts from the last section.  Listing 5-25.  Send basic email with EmailMessage class  from django.core.mail.message import EmailMessage   Build message email = EmailMessage subject='Coffeehouse specials', body='We would like to let you know  about this week\'s specials....', from_email='stores@coffeehouse.com',              to=['ilovecoffee@hotmail.com', 'officemgr@startups.com'], bcc=['marketing@  coffeehouse.com'], cc=['ceo@coffeehouse.com']              headers = {'Reply-To': 'support@coffeehouse.com'}    Send message with built-in send   method email.send    As you can see in Listing 5-25, the EmailMessage instance is created specifying its various class   parameters. Once this is done, you just call the send   method to send the email. It’s as simple as that.  Because no connection values are provided in the EmailMessage instance in Listing 5-25, Django uses the  default back-end connection defined in settings.py.  One drawback of the EmailMessage send   method is that it opens a connection to the email server  every time it’s called. This can be inefficient if you send hundreds or thousands of emails at once. In the  spirit of the send_mass_mail   shortcut method from the last section, it’s also possible to open a single  connection to the email server and send multiple emails with EmailMessage. Listing 5-26 shows how to use a  single connection and send multiple emails with EmailMessage.  200   Listing 5-26.  Send multiple emails in a single connection with EmailMessage class  Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  from django.core import mail connection = mail.get_connection     Manually open the connection connection.open     Build message email = EmailMessage subject='Coffeehouse specials', body='We would like to let you know  about this week\'s specials....', from_email='stores@coffeehouse.com',              to=['ilovecoffee@hotmail.com', 'officemgr@startups.com'],    bcc=['marketing@coffeehouse.com'], cc=['ceo@coffeehouse.com']              headers = {'Reply-To': 'support@coffeehouse.com'}   Build message email2 = EmailMessage subject='Coffeehouse coupons', body='New coupons for our best  customers....', from_email='stores@coffeehouse.com',              to=['officemgr@startups.com','food@momandpopshop.com'],    bcc=['marketing@coffeehouse.com'], cc=['ceo@coffeehouse.com']              headers = {'Reply-To': 'support@coffeehouse.com'}    Send the two emails in a single call connection.send_messages [email, email2]   The connection was already open so send_messages   doesn't close it.  We need to manually close the connection. connection.close    In Listing 5-26 the first step is to create a connection to the email server using mail.get_connection     and then open the connection with the open   method. Next, you create the various EmailMessage  instances. Once the email instances are prepared, you call the connection's send_messages   method with  an argument list corresponding to each of the EmailMessage instances. Finally, once the emails are sent, you  call the connection's close   method to drop the connection to the email server.  Another common email scenario is to send HTML emails. Django provides the   EmailMultiAlternatives class for this purpose, which is a subclass of the EmailMessage class. By being  a subclass, it means you can leverage the same functionalities as EmailMessage  e.g., CC, BCC , but you  don’t need to do a lot of work as the subclass EmailMultiAlternatives is specifically designed to handle a  multiple types of messages. Listing 5-27 illustrates how to use the EmailMultiAlternatives class.  Listing 5-27.  Send HTML  w text  emails with EmailMultiAlternatives, a subclass of the EmailMessage class  from django.core.mail import EmailMultiAlternatives  subject, from_email, to = 'Important support message', 'support@coffeehouse.com', 'ceo@ coffeehouse.com' text_content = 'This is an important message.' html_content = ' This is an important message.  201   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  ' msg = EmailMultiAlternatives subject=subject, body=text_content, from_email=from_email,  to=[to]  msg.attach_alternative html_content, "text html"  msg.send    Listing 5-27 first defines all the email fields, which include the text and HTML version of the email. Note   that having a text and HTML version of the email content is common practice, since there’s no guarantee  end users will allow or can read HTML email, so a text version is provided as a backup. Next, you define  an instance of the EmailMultiAlternatives class; notice the parameters are inline with those of the  EmailMessage class.  Next, in Listing 5-27 you can see a call to the attach_alternative method, which is specific to the   EmailMultiAlternatives class. The first argument to this method is the HTML content and the second is  the content type that corresponds to text html. Finally, Listing 5-27 calls the send   method - part of the  EmailMessage class, but which is also automatically part of to EmailMultiAlternatives since it’s a subclass  - to send the actual email.  In controlled environments  e.g., corporate email  where it can be guaranteed that all end users are   capable of viewing HTML email, it can be practical to just send an HTML version of an email and bypass the  text version altogether. Under these circumstances, you can actually use the EmailMesssage class directly  with a minor tweak. Listing 5-28 illustrates how to send just HTML email with the EmailMessage class.  Listing 5-28.  Send HTML emails with EmailMessage class  subject, from_email, to = 'Important support message', 'support@coffeehouse.com', 'ceo@ coffeehouse.com' html_content = ' This is an important message.  ' msg = EmailMessage subject=subject, body=html_content, from_email=from_email, to=[to]  msg.content_subtype = "html"   Main content is now text html msg.send    Listing 5-28 looks like a standard EmailMessage process definition; however, line four – msg.content_  subtype – is what makes Listing 5-28 different. If the HTML content were sent without line setting msg. content_subtype, end users would receive a verbatim version of the HTML content  i.e., without the HTML  tags rendered . This is because by default the EmailMessage class specifies the content type as text. In  order to switch the default content type of an EmailMessage instance, in line four a call is made to set the  content_subtype to html. With this change the email content type is set to HTML and end users are capable  of viewing the content rendered as HTML.  202   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  BEWARE OF JUST SENDING HTML EMAIL VERSIONS TO THE PUBLIC  although sending an htMl email version is quicker than sending a text and htMl email version, this  can be problematic if you can’t determine where end users read their email. there are certain users that  for security reasons disable the ability to view htMl emails, as well as certain email products that can’t  or aren’t very good at rendering htMl emails. So if you just send an htMl email version, there can be a  subset of end users that won’t be able to see the email content.  For this reason if you send email to end users where you can’t control their environment  i.e., email  reader , it is best you send a text and htMl email version - as illustrated in listing 5-27 - than sending  an htMl email version illustrated in listing 5-28.  Another common practice when sending emails is to attach files. Listing 5-29 illustrates how to attach a   PDF to an email.  Listing 5-29.  Send email with PDF attachment with EmailMessage class  from django.core.mail.message import EmailMessage   Build message email = EmailMessage subject='Coffeehouse sales report', body='Attached is sales  report....', from_email='stores@coffeehouse.com',             to=['ceo@coffeehouse.com', 'marketing@coffeehouse.com']             headers = {'Reply-To': 'sales@coffeehouse.com'}   Open PDF file attachment = open 'SalesReport.pdf', 'rb'   Attach PDF file email.attach 'SalesReport.pdf',attachment.read  ,'application pdf'    Send message with built-in send   method email.send    As you can see in Listing 5-29, after creating an EmailMessage instance you just open the PDF file using   Python’s standard open   method. Next, you use the attach   method from the EmailMessage that takes  three arguments: the file name, the file contents, and the file content type or MIME type. Finally, a call is  made to the send   method to send the email.  Debug Django Applications  The first steps to correct unexpected behavior in an application are generally to review what you believe are  the problematic sections of source code and the corresponding logs. Sometimes though these reviews are  fruitless, either because an application has grown in complexity or the unexpected behavior is originating in  a not so obvious location.  Under these circumstances, the next step is to start a debugging process with the help of tools to make it  easier to detect and fix the problem. In the upcoming sections, I’ll describe some of the most popular tools to  debug Django applications.  203   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Django Shell: Python manage.py Shell Just like Python’s CLI  ‘Command Line Interface’  shell where you can evaluate expressions  e.g., 1+3,  mystring = ‘django’ , Django offers its own shell version through the python manage.py shell   command - where manage.py is the top-level file in every Django project.  Django’s shell is helpful because it automatically loads a project’s dependencies and apps, so    you’re able to evaluate expressions related to your Django project  e.g., queries, methods  without having   to go through a tedious setup process. Listing 5-30 illustrates a series of sample expressions run from  Django’s shell.  Listing 5-30.  Django shell sample expressions  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py shell Python 2.7.3 [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  InteractiveConsole  >>> from coffeehouse.items.models import * >>> Drink.objects.filter item__price__lt=2 .filter caffeine__lt=100 .count   2 >>> from django.test import Client >>> c = Client   >>> response = c.get ' stores 1 '  >>> response.content ' \n<html.... .... ....   >>> c.get ' stores 5 '  Not Found:  stores 5     The first snippet in Listing 5-30 uses the from import syntax to gain access to a Django project’s model   classes, after which queries are made on the models to validate results. Note there’s no need to import  additional libraries or define database connections; all dependencies and configurations are loaded from  the Django project itself.  The second snippet in Listing 5-30 uses Django’s test library to simulate a client browser request to the    stores 1  and  stores 5  URLs, after which you can inspect the content response or the HTTP status  code  e.g., 404 Not Found . Here again note there’s no need to start a web server or open a browser; you can  quickly validate a Django project’s URLs and its responses from the Django shell.  Django Debug Toolbar The Django debug toolbar offers a more visual experience to debug Django applications compared to the  Django shell. The Django debug toolbar offers per page information through a sliding sidebar related to  things like resource usage  i.e., time , Django settings, HTTP headers, SQL queries, cache, and logging,  among other things. Figures 5-2 and 5-3 illustrate a collapsed and non-collapsed screenshot of the Django  debug toolbar.  204   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Figure 5-2.  Django debug toolbar hidden  Figure 5-3.  Django debug toolbar collapsed  As you can see in Figure 5-2, the Django debug toolbar is accessible through a small tab in the top    right-hand side of every Django project page. Figure 5-3 illustrates a collapsed version of the Django   debug toolbar where you can see its various sections; clicking on any of the sections further brings up a   pop-window with detailed information about each section.  You can install the Django debug toolbar with the pip install django-debug-toolbar command.   Once you install the django-debug-toolbar, you’ll also need to add the debug_toolbar line to the  INSTALLED_APPS variable in settings.py so Django enables the toolbar.  205   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent     Note    the Django debug toolbar only works when a project uses DeBUg=true.  In addition to the UI toolbar, the Django debug toolbar also offers the debugsqlshell utility. This   utility works like Django’s standard shell, but it outputs the backing SQL associated with any Django model  operation, as illustrated in Listing 5-31.  Listing 5-31.  Django debugsqlshell sample expressions  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py debugsqlshell Python 2.7.3 [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  InteractiveConsole  >>> from coffeehouse.items.models import * >>> Drink.objects.filter item__price__lt=2 .filter caffeine__lt=100 .count   SELECT COUNT *  AS "__count" FROM "items_drink" INNER JOIN "items_item" ON  "items_drink"."item_id" = "items_item"."id"  WHERE  "items_item"."price" < 2.0        AND "items_drink"."caffeine" < 100  [0.54ms]     Note   the debugsqlshell is part of the Django debug toolbar; therefore it must be installed as described  in the previous paragraphs  e.g., pip install django-debug-toolbar and added as debug_toolbar to the  INSTALLED_APPS variable in settings.py .  As you can see in Listing 5-31, the debugsqlshell utility is available through the manage.py command  - just like Django’s built-in shell - and after you run a Django model operation, it also outputs the SQL query  for the operation.  For detailed information on customizing the Django debug toolbar, see its official documentation.10  Django pdb pdb - short for "Python Debugger" - is a Python core package designed to interactively debug source code.  With Python pdb you can inspect the line-by- line execution of any Python application. To simplify the  process of Python pdb in the context of Django applications  e.g., debug request methods  you can use the  Django pdb package.  To install Python pdb run pip install django-pdb and then add django_pdb to the INSTALLED_APPS  variable in settings.py in the first position - the position is important so other Django apps don’t override  Django pdb’s behaviors  e.g., override runserver and test commands . Be aware the Django pdb package  only works when DEBUG=True.  There are various way to run pdb with Django; the easiest is to append the ?pdb parameter to any   Django URL you want to analyze with pdb. For example, Listing 5-32 shows a debugging sequence for the  http:  localhost:8000 drinks mocha ?pdb URL.  10http:  django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.org   206   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Listing 5-32.  Django pdb sequence  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py runserver INFO "GET  drinks mocha  HTTP 1.1" 200 11716 GET  drinks mocha ?pdb function "detail" in drinks views.py:8 args:    kwargs: {'drink_type': u'mocha'}    >  python djangodev local lib python2.7 site-packages django core handlers base.py 79 make_ view_atomic   -> non_atomic_requests = getattr view, '_non_atomic_requests', set     Pdb  n >  python djangodev local lib python2.7 site-packages django core handlers base.py 80 make_ view_atomic   -> for db in connections.all  : ... ... ... --Call-- >  www code djangorecipes 5_django_settings coffeehouse drinks views.py 8 detail   -> def detail request,drink_type :  Pdb  >  www code djangorecipes 5_django_settings coffeehouse drinks views.py 9 detail    Pdb  c  You can see Listing 5-32 starts with Django’s built-in web server and immediately receives and   dispatches a response to the regular URL  drinks mocha . Up to this point everything is standard; however,  notice the next request to the URL  drinks mocha ?pdb and the verbose output that follows.  The verbose output tells you where the request enters the application, including arguments, as well as   the initial entry point into Django’s core framework in the django.core.handlers.base.py package.  After the initial verbose output, the execution stops at the first  Pdb  instance. At this juncture you’ve   hit a breakpoint, so the console running runserver and the requesting client  i.e., browser  freeze until you  provide additional input on the console. In Listing 5-32 you can see the letter n for next is introduced and  the execution moves forward to another line, after which you’ll be presented with another  Pdb  prompt or  breakpoint. At this point, you can just press the Enter key to re-invoke the previous command  i.e., n  and  move forward.  If you want to advance without hitting another breakpoint, you can type c for continue so the execution   continues normally, without pausing again.  As you can see, the power of pdb with Django lies in the fact that you can walk through the execution   cycle of any section in a very granular way, in addition to having the ability to analyze and set variables  interactively. Table 5-6 describes the most basic commands related to pdb.  207   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Table 5-6.  Python pdb commands used at  Pdb  prompt  Pdb Command  Description   Enter   key  n c q p   l  L lowercase   s  r  Re-executes the previous command. Moves execution to the next breakpoint. Continues execution with no more breakpoints. Quits the execution immediately. Print variable s . Displays a list of source code at the current breakpoint, 11 lines worth: the breakpoint  line, 5 lines prior, and 5 lines after. Helpful to provide context. Enters a subroutine. In a non-method related breakpoint, s and n both move to the  next breakpoint. In a method related breakpoint, s enters the method or subroutine.  Breaks out of a subroutine. Used after s to return to the main routine.  In addition to appending the ?pdb parameter to a URL to enter pdb in a Django application, there are  two more alternatives. You can append the --pdb flag to runserver to enter pdb on every request made to  the application  e.g., python manage.py runserver --pdb . And you can also use the --pm flag to enter pdb  only when an exception is raised in a view  e.g., python manage.py runserver –pm .  For additional information on pdb itself, consult the official Python documentation at    https:  docs.python.org 3 library pdb.html. And for additional information on Django pdb, consult  the project’s documentation at https:  github.com tomchristie django-pdb.  Django Extensions Django extensions are a collection of tools designed for Django projects. As its name implies, it offers  extensions for a wide array of areas where Django’s standard tools level off in functionality. For debugging  purposes, Django extensions offers two tools that I believe are the most important to explore: runserver_plus  and runprofileserver.  To use Django extensions you’ll first need to install it with pip install django-extensions and then  add django_extensions to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py. Once you set up Django extensions, its various  tools become available through the python manage.py command just like Django’s standard tools.  The Django extensions runserver_plus command offers interactive and enhanced debugging for  Django projects. To use runserver_plus you’ll first need to install the Werkzeug utility - pip install  Werkzeug. Once you install Werkzeug, simply start a Django application with python manage.py runserver_plus  instead of Django’s standard python manage.py runserver. At first glance the runserver_plus command works  just like Django’s runserver ; however, if you happen to hit an exception you’ll see error pages like the ones  in Figures 5-4 and 5-5.  208   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Figure 5-4.  Django extensions runserver_plus  Figure 5-5.  Django extensions runserver_plus with interactive console  209   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  In Figure 5-4 you can see a slightly different Django exception page vs. Django’s default exception   page. This different layout is generated by Werkzeug, but the layout itself isn’t what’s interesting about this  approach: if you hover over any section of the stack trace you can start an interactive debugging session, as  illustrated in Figure 5-5. This is a much simpler and powerful debugging approach because it’s done directly  in a browser!  Another powerful Django extensions tool is runprofileserver, which can create a Python cProfile for   a Django application page. A Python cProfile provides a set of statistics that describes how often and for  how long the various parts of a program are executed, which can be helpful to determine solutions for slow  loading and resource intensive Django application pages.  The first thing you’ll need to do to use runprofileserver is to create a folder to hold the profile files   e.g., mkdir  tmp django-coffeehouse-profiles  . Next, simply start a Django application with python  manage.py runprofileserver --use-cprofile --prof-path= tmp django-coffeehouse-profiles   instead of Django’s standard python manage.py server - note the --prof-path flag value points to the  directory that will hold the profile files.  Open up a browser, head over to the Django application. and navigate through it. If you   open the folder that holds the profile files, you’ll see files like root.000037ms.1459139463.prof,  stores.000061ms.1459139465.prof, and stores.2.000050ms.1459139470.prof, where each file represents  a cProfile for each page hit.  Although it would go beyond the scope of the book to dive into cProfile analysis, not to mention there   are many tools available for this purpose, if you want a quick and easy tool to open Python cProfile files,   I would suggest SnakeViz. Just do pip install snakeviz and then run snakeviz  . Once you  run snakeviz on a file, you’ll see Python cProfile details like the ones illustrated in Figures 5-6 and 5-7.  Figure 5-6.  SnakeViz cProfile image  210   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Figure 5-7.  SnakeViz cProfile listing sorted by run time  As I mentioned at the start, Django extensions provide many tools in addition to runserver_plus and   runprofileserver, which I believe are the most appropriate for debugging tasks. Nevertheless, I would  recommend you review the Django extensions documentation available at https:  django-extensions. readthedocs.org en latest  to explore other tools that might be of use in your own projects  e.g., the  show_urls tool displays a Django project’s url routes and the graph_models tools generates graphs for a  Django project’s models .  Django Management Commands  Throughout the previous chapters – including this one – you’ve relied on management commands invoked  through the manage.py script included in all Django projects. For example, to start the development server  of a Django project you’ve used the runserver command  e.g., python manage.py runserver , and to  consolidate a project’s static resources you’ve used the collectstatic command  e.g., python manage.py  collectstatic .  Django management commands are included as part of Django apps and are designed to fulfill   repetitive or complex tasks through a one keyword command line instruction. Every Django management  command is backed by a script that contains the step-by-step Python logic to fulfill its duties. So when  you type python manage.py runserver, behind the scenes Django triggers a much more complex Python  routine.  If you type python manage.py  i.e., without a command  on a Django project, you’ll see a list of Django   management commands classified by app  e.g., auth, django, staticfiles . From this list you can gain  insight into the various management commands available on all your Django apps.  I’ll describe the purpose of Django management commands associated with core or third-party Django  apps as they come up in the book, just as I’ve done up to this point  e.g., static file management commands  in static file topics, model management commands in model topics .  What I’ll do next is describe how to create custom management commands in your Django apps, so you   can simplify the execution of routine or complex tasks through a single instruction.  211   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  Custom Management Command Structure Custom management commands are structured as Python classes that inherit their behavior from the  Django django.core.management.base.BaseCommand class. This last class provides the necessary structure  to execute any Python logic  e.g., file system, database, or Django specific  and at the same time process  arguments typically used with Django management commands. Listing 5-33 illustrates one of the most  Django management commands possible.  Listing 5-33.  Django management command class with no arguments  from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError from django.conf import settings  class Command BaseCommand :     help = 'Send test emails'      def handle self, *args, **options :         for admin_name,email in settings.ADMINS:             try:                 self.stdout.write self.style.WARNING "About to send email to %s" %  email                     Logic to send email here                  Any other Python logic can also go here                 self.stdout.write self.style.SUCCESS 'Successfully sent email to "%s"' % email                   raise Exception             except Exception:                 raise CommandError 'Failed to send test email'   Notice in Listing 5-33, the management command class must be named Command and inherit its   behavior from the Django BaseCommand class. Next, there’s a help attribute to describe the purpose of the  management command. If you type python manage.py help   or python manage.py    --help Django outputs the value of the help attribute.  The handle method contains the core command logic and is automatically run when invoking the   command. Notice the handle method declares three input argument: self to reference the class instance;  *args to reference arguments of the method itself; and **options to reference arguments passed as part  of the management command. The task logic in Listing 5-33 only uses the self reference. The other task  management example – in Listing 5-34 – illustrates how to use arguments.  The task logic in Listing 5-33 is limited to looping over the ADMINS value in settings.py and outputting  the task results. However, there’s no limit to the logic you can execute inside the handle method, so long as  it’s valid Python.  Although standard Python try except blocks work as expected inside Django management tasks, there  are two syntax particularities you need to be aware of when creating Django management tasks: outputting  messages and error handling.  To send output messages while executing task logic – success or informative – you can see Listing 5-33  uses the self.stdout.write reference, which represents the standard output channel where management  tasks run. In addition, you can see self.stdout.write uses both the self.style.WARNING and self. style.SUCCESS to declare the actual messages to output. The wrapping of messages inside self.style.* is  optional, but outputs colored formatted messages  e.g., SUCCESS in green font, WARNING in yellow font  in  accordance with Django syntax coloring roles.11  11https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref django-admin syntax-coloring  212   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  To send error messages while executing task logic, you can use the self.stderr.write reference,   which represents the standard error channel where management tasks run. And to terminate the execution  of a management task due to an error, you can raise the django.core.management.base.CommandError  exception – as it’s done in Listing 5-33 – which accepts an error message, which gets sent to the self. stderr.write channel.  In most circumstances, it’s rare to have a fixed Django management command like the one in Listing 5-33   that uses no arguments to alter its logical workflow. For example, the Django runserver command accepts  argument like addrport and --nothreading to influence how a web server is launched.  Django management commands can use two types of arguments: positional arguments – where the  order in which they’re declared gives them their meaning; or named arguments – which are preceded by  names with two dashes --  a.k.a.flags  to give them their meaning.  Although the **options argument of the handle   method – as shown in Listing 5-33 – provides access  to a management command’s arguments to alter the logical workflow, in order to use arguments in a custom  Django management command, you must also declare the add_arguments   method.  The add_arguments   method must define a management task’s arguments, including their    type – positional or named – default value, choice values, and help message, among other things. In essence,  the add_arguments   method works as a pre-processor to command arguments, which are then made  available in the **options argument of the handle   method.  The parser reference of the add_arguments self,parser  signature is an argument parser based on  the standard Python argparse package12 designed to easily process command-line arguments for Python  scripts.  To add command arguments inside the add_arguments   method you do so via the    parser.add_argument   method, as illustrated in Listing 5-34.  Listing 5-34.  Django management task class with arguments  from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError from django.conf import settings  class Command BaseCommand :     help = 'Clean up stores'      def add_arguments self, parser :          Positional arguments are standalone name         parser.add_argument 'store_id'            Named  optional  arguments start with --         parser.add_argument              '--delete',             default=False,             help='Delete store instead of cleaning it up',                def handle self, *args, **options :          Access arguments inside **options dictionary         options={'store_id': '1', 'settings': None, 'pythonpath': None,                  'verbosity': 1, 'traceback': False, 'no_color': False, 'delete': False}  12https:  docs.python.org 3 library argparse.html  213   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent  The management command in Listing 5-34 declares both a positional and a named argument.   Notice both arguments are added with the parser.add_argument   method. The difference being, named  arguments use leading dashes - and If omitted an argument is assumed to be positional.  Positional arguments by definition are required. So in the case of Listing 5-34, the store_id argument is   expected  e.g., python manage.py cleanupstores 1, where 1 is the store_id , otherwise Django throws a  ‘too few arguments’ error.  Named arguments are always optional. And because named arguments are optional, you can see in   Listing 5-34 the --delete argument declares a default=False value, ensuring the argument always receives  a default value to run the logic inside the handle   method.  The --delete argument in Listing 5-34 also uses the help attribute to define a descriptive text about the  purpose of the argument. In addition to default and help, the parser.add_argument   method supports a  wide variety of attributes, based on the Python argparse package – see the previous footnote to consult some  of the arguments support by this method.  Finally, you can see in Listing 5-34 the handle   method gets access to the command arguments via the  **options dictionary, where the values can then be used toward the structuring of the command logic. Note  the additional arguments available in **options – settings, pythonpath,etc. – are inherited by default due  to the BaseCommand class.  Custom Management Command Installation All Django management tasks are placed inside individual Python files  i.e., one command per file  and  stored inside an app directory structure under the  management commands  folder. Listing 5-35 shows the  folder structure for a couple of apps with custom management tasks.  Listing 5-35.

Management Command Automation Django management commands are typically run from the command line, requiring human intervention.  However, there can be times when it’s helpful or necessary to automate the execution of management  commands from other locations  e.g., a Django view method or shell .  For example, if a user uploads an image in a Django application and you want the image to become   publicly accessible, you’ll need to run the collectstatic command so the image makes its way to the public  and consolidation location  STATIC_ROOT . Similarly, you may want to run a cleanuprofile command every  time a user logs in.  To automate the execution of management commands, Django offers the django.core.management.  call_command   method. Listing 5-36 illustrates the various ways in which you can use the call_command    method.  Listing 5-36.  Django management automation with call_command    from django.core import management   Option 1, no arguments management.call_command 'sendtestemails'    Option 2, no pause to wait for input management.call_command 'collectstatic', interactive=False   215   Chapter 5   Django appliCation ManageMent   Option 3, command input with Command   from django.core.management.commands import loaddata management.call_command loaddata.Command  , 'stores', verbosity=0    Option 4, positional and named command arguments management.call_command 'cleanupdatastores', 1, delete=True   The first option in Listing 5-35 executes a management without any arguments. The second option   in Listing 5-35 uses the interactive=False argument to indicate the command must not pause for  user input  e.g., collectstatic always asks if you’re sure if you want to overwrite preexisting files, the  interactive=False argument avoids this pause and need for input .  The third option in Listing 5-35 invokes the management command by first importing it and then   invoking its Command   class directly vs. using the command string value. And finally, the fourth option – just  like the third – in Listing 5-35, uses a positional argument – declared as a stand-alone value  e.g., 'stores', 1   and a named argument – declared as a key=value  e.g., verbosity=0, delete=True .  216   CHAPTER 6  Django Forms  Forms are the standard way that users input or edit data in web applications. At their lowest level, forms are  made up of HTML tags with special meaning. While you can directly add HTML form tags to Django or Jinja  templates, you really want to avoid this and use Django’s built-in form support to make form processing easier. In this chapter you’ll learn how to structure Django forms and the workflow that forms undergo. You’ll   also learn the various field types and widgets supported by Django forms, how to validate form data and  manage its errors, as well as how to lay out forms and their errors in templates.  Once you have a firm understanding of the basics behind Django forms, you’ll learn how to create   custom form fields and widgets. Finally, you’ll learn more complex Django form processing techniques, such  as partial form processing, form processing with AJAX, how to process files sent through Django forms, and  how to process multiple forms on the same page with Django formsets.  Django Form Structure and Workflow  Django has a special forms package that offers a comprehensive way to work with forms. Among this  package’s features are the ability to define form functionality in a single location, data validation, and tight  integration with Django models, among other things. Let’s take a first look at a stand-alone Django form  class in Listing 6-1 that is used to back a contact form.  Listing 6-1.  Django form class definition   forms.py in app named 'contact' from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea    There’s no specific location Django expects forms to be in. You can equally place Django form      Note  classes in their own file inside an app  e.g., forms.py  or place them inside other app files  e.g., models.py,  views.py . You can later import Django form classes to where they’re needed, just like Django views or Python  packages.    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_6  217   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  The first important aspect to note in Listing 6-1 is a Django form definition is a subclass of the forms. Form class, so it automatically has all the base functionality of this parent class. Next, you can see the form  class has three attributes, two of the type forms.CharField and one of the type forms.EmailField. These  form field definitions restrict input to certain characteristics.  For example, forms.CharField indicates the input should be a set of characters and forms.EmailField   indicates the input should be an email. In addition, you can see each form field includes properties  e.g.,  required  to further restrict the type of input. For the moment this should be enough detail about Django  form field type;, the next section on Django form field types goes into greater detail on just this topic.  Next, let’s integrate the Django form in Listing 6-1 to a Django view method so it can then be passed and   rendered in a Django template. Listing 6-2 illustrates the initial iteration of this view method.  Listing 6-2.  Django view method that uses a Django form   views.py in app named 'contact' from django.shortcuts import render from .forms import ContactForm  def contact request :     form = ContactForm       return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}   The view method in Listing 6-2 first instantiates the ContactForm form class and assigns it to the   form reference. This form reference is then passed as an argument to be made available inside the about  contact.html template.  Next, inside the Django template you can output a Django form as a regular variable. Listing 6-3   illustrates how the Django form is rendered if you use the standard template syntax {{form.as_table}}.  Listing 6-3.  Django form instance rendered in template as HTML     Name:   <input id="id_name" name="name"  type="text"  >      Your email:   <input id="id_email" required  name="email" type="email"  >      Comment:   <textarea cols="40" id="id_comment"  required name="comment" rows="10">      In Listing 6-3 you can see how the Django form is translated into HTML tags! Notice how the Django   form produces the appropriate HTML   tags for each form field  e.g., forms.EmailField label='Your  email'  creates the specified   and an HTML 5 type="email" to enforce client-side validation of an  email . In addition, notice the name field lacks the HTML 5 required attribute due to the required=False  statement used in the form field in Listing 6-1.  If you look closely at Listing 6-3, the HTML output for the Django form instance are just inner HTML   table tags  i.e.,  , ,  . The output is missing an HTML   wrapper tag and supporting HTML  form tags  i.e.,   tag and action attribute to indicate where to send the form, as well as a submit  button . This means you’ll need to add the missing HTML form tags to the template to create a working web  form - a process that’s described shortly in Listing 6-4.  In addition, if you don’t want to output the entire form fields surrounded by HTML table elements  like Listing 6-3, there are many other syntax variations to output form fields granularly and stripped of  HTML tags. In this case, the {{form.as_table}} reference in the template is used to simplify things, but  the upcoming section “Set Up the Layout for Django Forms in Templates” in this chapter elaborates on the  different syntax variations to output Django forms in templates.  218   Next, let’s take a look at Figure 6-1, which shows a Django form’s workflow to better illustrate how   Django forms work from start to finish.  ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Figure 6-1.  Django forms workflow  The first two steps of the workflow in Figure 6-1 is what I’ve described up to this point. It consists of a   user hitting a URL that’s processed by a view method that returns an empty form based on the Django form  class definition. Listing 6-3 shows the raw HTML output of the Django form, but as I already mentioned, the  form is missing elements in order to become a functional web form; next I’ll describe the elements you need  to add to get a functional web form.  Functional Web Form Syntax for Django Forms So far you’ve learned how a Django form class definition can quickly be turned into an HTML form. But this  automatic HTML generation is only part of the benefit of using Django form class definitions; you can also  validate form values and present errors to end users much more quickly.  To perform these last actions, it’s first necessary to have a functional web form. Listing 6-4 illustrates the   template syntax to create a functional web form from a Django form.  219   Listing 6-4.  Django form template declaration for functional web form  ChaPTer 6   Django Forms      {% csrf_token %}    {{form.as_table}}        The first thing to notice about Listing 6-4 is the form is wrapped around the HTML   tag that  is standard for all web forms. The reason Django forces you to explicitly set the   tag is because its  attributes dictate much of a web form’s behavior and can vary depending on the purpose of the form.  In Listing 6-4, the method attribute tells a web browser that when the form is submitted it POSTs the  data to the server. The POST method value is standard practice in web forms that process user data - an  alternative method option value is GET, but it’s not a typical choice for transferring user-provided data. The  use of the POST method should become clearer shortly, but for more background on form method attributes,  you can consult many Internet references on HTTP request methods.1  Another important   attribute - which is actually missing in Listing 6-4 - is action, which tells  a web browser where to submit the form  i.e., what URL is tasked with processing the form . In this case,  because Listing 6-4 has no action attribute, a browser’s behavior is to POST the data to the same URL where  it’s currently on, meaning if the browser got the form from the  contact  URL, it will POST the data to the  same  contact  URL. If you wanted to POST the form to a separate URL, then you would add the action  attribute  e.g., action=" urltoprocessform "  to the   tag.  Keep in mind that because the same URL delivers the initial form - via a GET request - and must also   process the form data - via a POST request - the backing view method of the URL must be designed to handle  both cases. I’ll describe a modified version of Listing 6-2 – which just handles the GET request case – to also  handle the POST case in the next section.  The {% csrf_token %} statement in Listing 6-4 is a Django tag. {% csrf_token %} is a special tag   reserved for cases when a web form is submitted via POST and processed by Django. The csrf initials mean  Cross-Site Request Forgery, which is a default security mechanism enforced by Django. While it’s possible  to disable CSRF and not include the {% csrf_token %} Django tag in forms, I would advise against it and  recommend you keep adding the {% csrf_token %} Django tag to all forms with POST, as CSRF works as  a safeguard and mostly behind the scenes. The last subsection in this first section describes the reasoning  behind CSRF and how it works in Django in greater detail.  Next in Listing 6-4 is the {{form.as_table}} snippet wrapped in an   tag, which represents the   Django form instance and outputs the HTML output illustrated in Listing 6-3. Finally, there’s the <input  type="submit"> tag, which generates the form’s submit button - that when clicked on by a user submits the  form - and the closing   tag.  Django View Method to Process Form  POST Handling  Once you have a functional web form in Django, it’s necessary to create a view method to process it. In  the previous section, I mentioned how the same URL and, by extension, view method, would both handle  generating the blank HTML form, as well as process the HTML form with data. Listing 6-5 illustrates a  modified version of the view method in Listing 6-2 that does exactly this.  1https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Hypertext_Transfer_ProtocolRequest_methods  220   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Listing 6-5.  Django view method that sends and processes Django form  from django.shortcuts import render from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from .forms import ContactForm  def contact request :     if request.method == 'POST':          POST, generate form with data from the request         form = ContactForm request.POST           check if it's valid:         if form.is_valid  :              process data, insert into DB, generate email,etc              redirect to a new URL:             return HttpResponseRedirect ' about contact thankyou'      else:          GET, generate blank form         form = ContactForm       return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}   The most important construct in the view method of Listing 6-5 is the if else condition that checks   the request method type. If the request method type is POST  i.e., data submission or step 3 in Figure 6-1 ,  the form’s data is processed, but if the request method type is anything else  i.e., initial request or step 1  in Figure 6-1  an empty form is generated to produce the same behavior as Listing 6-2. Notice the last line  in Listing 6-5 is a return statement that assigns the form instance - whether empty  a.k.a. unbound  or  populated  a.k.a. bound  - and returns it to a template for rendering.  Now let’s take a closer look at the POST logic in Listing 6-5. If the request method type is POST it means   there’s incoming user data, so we access the incoming data with the request.POST reference and initialize  the Django form with it. But notice how there’s no need to access individual form fields or make piecemeal  assignments - although you could if you wanted to and this process is described in a later section in this  chapter – using request.POST as the argument of a Django form class is sufficient to populate a Django form  instance with user data; it’s that simple! It’s worth mentioning that a Django form instance created in this  manner  i.e., with user-provided data  is known as a bound form instance.  At this point, we still don’t know if a user-provided valid data with respect to a Django form’s field   definitions  e.g., if values are text or a valid email . To validate a form’s data, you must use the is_valid    helper method on the bound form instance. If form.is_valid   is True the data is processed and  subsequent action is taken; in Listing 6-5 this additional action consists of redirecting control to the  about  contact thankyou URL. If form.is_valid   is False it means the form data has errors, after which point  control falls to the last return statement that now passes a bound form instance to render the template.  By using a bound form instance in this last case, the user gets a rendered form filled with his initial data  submission and errors so he’s able to correct the data without reintroducing values from scratch.  I purposely didn’t mention anymore details about the is_valid   helper method or error message   displays, because Django form processing can get a little complex. The subsequent section “Django Form  Processing: Initialization, Field Access, Validation, and Error Handling” covers all you need to know about  Django form processing so it doesn’t interfere in this introductory section.  221   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  CSRF: What Is It and How Does It Work with Django? CSRF or Cross-Site Request Forgery is a technique used by cyber-criminals to force users into executing  unwanted actions on a web application. When users interact with web forms, they make all kinds of  state-changing tasks that range from making orders  e.g., products, money transfers  to changing their  data  e.g. name, email, address . Most users tend to feel a heightened sense of security when they interact  with web forms because they see an HTTPS SSL security symbol or they’ve used a username password  prior to interacting with a web form, all of which leads to a feeling there’s no way a cyber-criminal could  eavesdrop, guess, or interfere with their actions.  A CSRF attack relies for the most part on social engineering and lax application security on a web   application, so the attack vector is open irrespective of other security measures  e.g., HTTPS SSL, strong  password . Figure 6-2 illustrates a CSRF vulnerable scenario on a web application.  Figure 6-2.  Web application with no CSRF protection  After user “X” interacts with web application “A”  e.g., making an order, updating his email  he simply   navigates away and goes to other sites. Like most web applications, web application “A” maintains valid user  sessions for hours or days, in case users come back and decide to do other things without having to sign in  again. Meanwhile, a cyber-criminal has also used site “A” and knows exactly where and how all of its web  forms work  e.g., URLs, input parameters such as email, credit card .  Next, a cyber-criminal creates links or pages that mimic the submission of web forms on web   application “A.” For example, this could be a form that changes a user’s email in order to overtake an account  or transfers money from a user’s account to steal funds. The cyber-criminal then seeds the Internet with  these links or pages through email, social media, or other web sites with enticing or frightening headlines:  “Get a $100 coupon from site ‘A’”, “Urgent: Change your password on site ‘A’ because of a security risk’.  In reality, these links or pages don’t do what they advertise, but instead in a single click mimic web form  submissions from site “A”  e.g., change a user’s email or transfer funds .  Now let’s turn our attention to unsuspecting user “X” that visited site “A” hours or days earlier. He   catches a glimpse of these last advertisements and thinks “Wow, I can’t pass this up.” Thinking what harm  can a click do, he clicks on the bogus advertisement, the user is then sent to a legitimate site ‘A’ page as a   222   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  façade or the click ‘appears’ to have done nothing. User “X” thinks nothing of it and goes back to some other  task. If site ‘A’ did not have web forms with CSRF protection, then user “X” just inadvertently - in a single  click - performed an action on site “A” he wasn’t aware of.  As you can see, in order to perform a CSRF attack, all that’s needed is for a user to have an active session  on a given site and a cyber-criminal crafty enough to trick a user into clicking on a link or page that performs  actions on said site. Hence the term’s name: “Cross-Site,” because the request doesn’t come from the original  site, and “Request Forgery” because it’s a forged request by a cyber-criminal.  To protect against web form CSRF attacks, it’s isn’t sufficient for web applications to trust authenticated   users, because as I’ve just described, authenticated users could have inadvertently triggered actions they  weren’t aware of. Web forms must be equipped with a unique identifier - often called a CSRF token - that’s  unique to a user and has an expiration time, similar to a session identifier. In this manner, if a request is  made by an authenticated user to a site, only requests that match his CSRF token are considered valid and all  other requests are discarded, as illustrated in Figure 6-3.  Figure 6-3.  Web application with CSRF protection  As you can see in Figure 6-3, the inclusion of a CSRF token in a web form makes it very difficult to forge   a user’s request.  In Django, a CSRF token is generated in web forms with the {% csrf token %} tag that generates an   HTML tag in the form <input type="hidden" name="csrfmiddlewaretoken" value="32_character_ string">, where the 32-character string value varies by user. In this manner, if a Django application makes  a POST request - like those made by web forms - it will only accept the request if the CSRF token is present  and valid for a given user; otherwise it will generate a ‘403 Forbidden’ page error.  Be aware CSRF is enabled by default on all Django applications thanks to its out-of-the-box middleware   settings that include the django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware class charged with enforcing  CSRF functionality. If you wish to disable the CSRF support in a Django application completely, you can  just remove the django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware class from the MIDDLEWARE variable in  settings.py.  If you wish to enable or disable CSRF on certain web forms, you can selectively use the @csrf_exempt     and @csrf_protect decorators on the view methods that process a web form’s POST request.  223   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  To enable CSRF on all web forms and disable CSRF behavior on certain web forms, keep the django.  middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware class in MIDDLEWARE and decorate the view methods you don’t want  as CSRF validation on with the @csrf_exempt   decorator, as illustrated in Listing 6-6.  Listing 6-6.  Django view method decorated with @csrf_exempt   to bypass CSRF enforcement  from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt  @csrf_exempt def contact request :      Any POST-processing inside view method      ignores if there is or isn't a CSRF token  To disable CSRF on all web forms and enable CSRF behavior on certain web forms, remove the django.  middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware class from MIDDLEWARE and decorate the view methods you want  CSRF validation on with the @csrf_protect   decorator, as illustrated in Listing 6-7.  Listing 6-7.  Django view method decorated with @csrf_protect   to enforce CSRF when CSRF is disabled at  the project level  from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_protect  @csrf_protect def contact request :      Any POST processing inside view method      checks for the presence of a CSRF token      even when CsrfViewMiddleware is removed  Django Form Processing: Initialization, Field Access,  Validation, and Error Handling  Because Django form processing can have a great deal of variations, I’ll start the discussion from the same  form and view method explained in the previous section, now consolidated in Listing 6-8.  Listing 6-8.  Django form class with backing processing view method  from django import forms from django.shortcuts import render  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea   def contact request :     if request.method == 'POST':          POST, generate form with data from the request         form = ContactForm request.POST   224   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms           Reference is now a bound instance with user data sent in POST          process data, insert into DB, generate email, redirect to a new URL,etc     else:          GET, generate blank form         form = ContactForm            Reference is now an unbound  empty  form      Reference form instance  bound unbound  is sent to template for rendering     return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}   Initialize Forms: Initial for Fields and Forms, __init__ method,   label_suffix, auto_id, field_order, and use_required_attribute When users request a page backed by a Django form they’re sent an empty form  a.k.a. unbound form  -  represented by the GET section and ContactForm   instance in Listing 6-8. Although the form is always  empty from a user data perspective, the form can contain data from as part of its initialization sequence   e.g., a pre-filled form with a user’s email or name .  To perform this kind of Django form initialization you have three options. The first technique consists   of initializing the form with a dictionary of values via the initial argument directly on the form instance  declared in the view method. Listing 6-9 shows this technique.  Listing 6-9.  Django form instance with initial argument declared in view method  def contact request :         ....         ....     else:          GET, generate blank form         form = ContactForm initial={'email':'johndoe@coffeehouse.com','name':'John Doe'}           Form is now initialized for first presentation to display these values      Reference form instance  bound unbound  is sent to template for rendering     return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}   The ContactForm   now uses initial={'email':'johndoe@coffeehouse.com','name':'John Doe'}   to generate a pre-filled form instance with values for the email and name fields so end users don’t have to go  to the trouble of typing these values from scratch themselves.  The technique in Listing 6-9 is intended for one-time or instance-specific initialization values. If you   want to constantly provide the same value for a given form field, a more suitable technique is to use the  same initial argument directly on a form field, as show in Listing 6-10.  Listing 6-10.  Django form fields with initial argument  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False,initial='Please provide your name'        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email', initial='We need your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea   225   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  def contact request :         ....         ....     else:          GET, generate blank form         form = ContactForm             Form is now initialized for first presentation and is filled with initial values   in form definition       Reference form instance  bound unbound  is sent to template for rendering     return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}   Notice in Listing 6-10 how it’s now the form fields in the form class equipped with the initial   argument. It’s worth mentioning that if you use the initial argument on both the form instance and form  fields, form instance values take precedence over any form field  e.g., if you combine the statements from  Listing 6-9 and Listing 6-10, the form will always be pre-filled with email='johndoe@coffeehouse.com'  and name='John Doe' from Listing 6-9 .  One of the drawbacks of using the initial argument in form fields like Listing 6-10 is that values can’t  change dynamically at runtime  i.e., you can’t personalize the initial values based on who calls the form  like Listing 6-9 . To solve this and provide the utmost flexibility for the most complex form initialization  scenarios is a third technique using the __init__ method of a form class illustrated in Listing 6-11.  Listing 6-11.  Django form initialized with __init__ method  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea         def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :              Get 'initial' argument if any             initial_arguments = kwargs.get 'initial', None              updated_initial = {}             if initial_arguments:                    We have initial arguments, fetch 'user' placeholder variable if any                   user = initial_arguments.get 'user',None                     Now update the form's initial values if user                   if user:                         updated_initial['name'] = getattr user, 'first_name', None                          updated_initial['email'] = getattr user, 'email', None               You can also initialize form fields with hardcoded values              or perform complex DB logic here to then perform initialization             updated_initial['comment'] = 'Please provide a comment'              Finally update the kwargs initial reference             kwargs.update initial=updated_initial              super ContactForm, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs   def contact request :         ....         ....     else:  226   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms           GET, generate blank form         form = ContactForm initial={'user':request.user,'otherstuff':'otherstuff'}           Form is now initialized via the form's __init__ method      Reference form instance  bound unbound  is sent to template for rendering     return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}   The first important aspect in Listing 6-11 is how the form is initialized in the view method; notice it uses  the same initial argument but the dictionary values are now {'user':request.user,'otherstuff':'oth erstuff'}. Do these values look strange? The form doesn’t even have fields named user or otherstuff, so  what’s happening?  These last values are perfectly valid and in other circumstances would be ignored because the  Django form does indeed have no fields by these names, but since we’ll be manipulating the guts of  form initialization process in the __init__ method, we can access these placeholder values for indirect  initialization purposes. More importantly, using these placeholder values illustrates how it’s possible to use  context data or unrelated form data to initialize Django form fields.  Next, let’s turn our attention to the Django form’s __init__ method, which is invoked when you create  a form instance. The __init__ method’s arguments *args, **kwargs are standard Python syntax – if you’ve  never seen this last syntax check out the appendix on Python Basics: Methods: Default, Optional, *args &  **kwargs Arguments.  The first step in __init__ checks for an initial value and creates a reference to hold the new values to   initialize the form. If an initial value is present, a check is made for a user value to use these values for the  form’s actual name and email fields. Next, irrespective of any passed in values, a direct assignment is made  on the form’s comment field.  Finally, the form’s initial reference is updated with a new set of values that reflect the form’s actual   fields, leading to the form’s initialization using data outside the context of a form  e.g., request data, database  query, etc. . As a last step in the __init__ method, a call is made to the super   method so that the base  parent class initialization process takes place.  ALWAYS USE THE INITIAL ARGUMENT OR __INIT__ METHOD   TO POPULATE FORMS WITH INITIALIZATION DATA AND KEEP    THEM UNBOUND.  It’s important to note all the previous initialization techniques keep a form unbound, which is a term  used to describe form instances that haven’t been populated with user data. The term bound is reserved  for when a form’s field values are populated with user data. This subtle difference between bound and  unbound is really important when you enter the validation phase of Django forms described in the next  section.  This also means the syntax ContactForm initial={‘email’:‘johndoe@coffeehouse.com’,‘name’:‘john  Doe’}  is not equivalent to ContactForm {‘email’:‘johndoe@coffeehouse.com’,‘name’:‘john Doe’} . The  first variation uses the initial argument to create an unbound form instance, while the second variation  creates a bound form instance by passing the values directly without any argument.  In addition to initializing the first set of data loaded on a Django form, there are four other initialization  options for Django forms that influence a form’s layout in templates: label_suffix, auto_id, field_order,  and use_required_attribute.  When you generate the output for a Django form in a template - a topic that’s described in detail later in   this chapter in “Set Up the Layout for Django Forms in Templates” - form fields are generally accompanied  by what’s called a field label, which is another name for a human-friendly descriptor. For example, if   227   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  you have fields called name and email, their default labels are Your name and Your email, respectively.  To separate field labels from a field’s HTML markup  e.g.,    Django defines a label  suffix, which defaults to :  the colon symbol  to produce output with the pattern  :<input  type=" ">. Through the label_suffix you can define a custom label suffix symbol to separate  every form field from its label. So, for example, the ContactForm label_suffix='...'  syntax outputs every  form field label separated by ...  e.g., Your email...  .   Individual form fields can also use the label_suffix attribute; see the Django form field types section. If      Tip  label_suffix is declared in both a form field and form initialization, the former takes precedence.  Another initialization option for Django forms is auto_id that automatically generates an id and label   for every form field. By default, a Django form is always set to auto_id=True so you’ll always get auto- generated HTML ids and labels when outputting a form with form.as_table  , as illustrated in the first part  of Listing 6-12.  Listing 6-12.  Django form with automatic ids  default auto_id=True option  and no automatic ids auto_ id=False option       Name:   <input id="id_name" name="name"  type="text"  >      Your email:   <input id="id_email" name="email"  type="email"  >      Comment:   <textarea cols="40" id="id_comment"  name="comment" rows="10">          Name:        Your email:        Comment:   \r\n       Notice how the field labels in the top output of Listing 6-12 are wrapped around <label for="id_  field_name">   and the fields HTML tags include the id="id_field_name" attribute. In most cases  this is a desirable output as it allows fields to be easily referenced for purposes of attaching JavaScript events  or CSS classes. However, for other circumstances auto_id=True can produce very verbose output and  inclusively conflicting HTML tags  e.g., if you have two form instances of the same type on the same page,  there will be two identical ids .  To turn off the auto-generation of ids and labels you can initialize a form with the auto_id=False   option. For example, the ContactForm auto_id=False  syntax generates the output presented in the second  half of Listing 6-12.  Another initialization option for unbound form instances that influences a form’s layout is the field_  order option. By default, form fields are output in the order they’re declared, so the form definition in Listing  6-10 follows the output order: name, email, comment. You can override this default field output by using the  field_order option, which accepts a list of field names with the desired output order. The field_order  option can be declared as part of the initialization process or inclusively as if it were a form field.  For example, the ContactForm field_order=['email','comment','name']  syntax ensures the email  field is output first, followed by comment and name. It’s worth mentioning the field_order option can accept  an incomplete field list, such as ContactForm field_order=['email'] , which outputs the email field   228   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  followed by the remaining form fields in their declared order, in this case name and then comment. If you’re  constantly setting field_order to initialize a form’s field order, a quicker solution is to set a default field_ order as part of the form itself:  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea        field_order = ['email','comment','name']  Sets order email,comment,name  If you declare field_order as part of the form itself, on initialization, the initialization field_order   takes precedence. The upcoming section “Set Up the Layout for Django Forms in Templates” contains more  details on the practical use of field_order in templates.  Finally, the use_required_attribute option allows you to set the overall use of the HTML 5 required   attribute. By default use_required_attribute=True, which means all required form fields are output  with the HTML 5 required attribute, ensuring browsers enforces these form fields are always provided.  You can disable the use of this HTML 5 client-side validation required attribute by initializing a form with  use_required_attribute=False. Note that setting use_required_attribute=False does not influence the  Django server-side validation of a form field  e.g., if a form field is required, Django server-side validation  still catches fields that aren’t provided, irrespective of the use_required_attribute option .  Accessing Form Values: request.POST and cleaned_data Once a user fills out a Django form, the form is sent back to the server to be processed and performs an  action with the user data  e.g., creates an order, send an email, saves the data to the database  – a step that is  represented in the POST section in Listing 6-8.  One of the key advantages of Django form processing is you can use the request.POST variable to create   a bound form instance. But although the request.POST variable is the initial access point to populate a  Django form with user data, you shouldn’t use this data beyond initializing a form instance, as the data in  request.POST is too raw for direct access.  For example, in request.POST you still don’t know if the user-provided data is valid. In addition, the   data in request.POST is still treated as strings, so if your Django form happens to have an IntegerField   or  DateField   it still needs to be converted manually to the expected data type  e.g., ‘6’ to 6 integer, ‘2017-01-01’  to 2017-01-01 datetime , which is just unnecessary work that another another part of Django forms deals with.  Once you have a bound form generated with the request.POST variable, you can then access each of   the form’s field values through the cleaned_data dictionary. For example, if the bound form has a form field  called name you can use the syntax form.cleaned_data['name'] to access the user-provided name value.  More importantly, if the form field is an IntegerField   named age the syntax form.cleaned_data['age']  produces an integer value, a formatting behavior that also applies to other form fields with non-string data  types  e.g. DateField   .     Caution    You can’t access cleaned_data until is_valid   is called on the form.  By design, it isn’t possible to access a form instance’s cleaned_data dictionary unless you first call  the is_valid   method. If you try to access cleaned_data before calling is_valid   you’ll get the error  AttributeError: 'form_reference' object has no attribute 'cleaned_data'.  If you think about this for a second it’s good practice, after all, why would you want to access data that   hasn’t been validated? The next section describes the is_valid   method.  229   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Validating Form Values: is_valid  , validators, clean_   ,   and clean   The is_valid   method is one of the more important parts of Django form processing. Once you create  a bound form with request.POST, you call the is_valid   method on the instance to determine if the  included values comply with a form’s field definitions  e.g., if an EmailField   value is a valid email .  Although the is_valid   method returns a Boolean True or False value, it has two important side effects:  Calling is_valid   also creates the cleaned_data dictionary on the form instance to hold the form field   values that passed validation rules.   	 Calling is_valid   also creates the errors dictionary on the form instance to hold   the form errors for each of the fields that didn’t pass the validation rules.  Listing 6-13 illustrates a modified version of Listing 6-8 with the is_valid   method.  Listing 6-13.  Django form is_valid   method for form processing  from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect  def contact request :     if request.method == 'POST':          POST, generate form with data from the request         form = ContactForm request.POST           Reference is now a bound instance with user data sent in POST          Call is_valid   to validate data and create cleaned_data and errors dict         if form.is_valid  :              Form data is valid, you can now access validated values in the cleaned_data dict             e.g. form.cleaned_data['email']             process data, insert into DB, generate email             Redirect to a new URL            return HttpResponseRedirect ' about contact thankyou'          else:            pass  Not needed             is_valid   method created errors dict, so form reference now contains errors             this form reference drops to the last return statement where errors             can then be presented accessing form.errors in a template     else:          GET, generate blank form         form = ContactForm            Reference is now an unbound  empty  form      Reference form instance  bound unbound  is sent to template for rendering     return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}   Notice in Listing 6-13 that right after a bound form instance is created, a call is made to the is_valid    method. If all the form field values comply against the form field data types, we enter a conditional where it’s  possible to access the form values through the cleaned_data dictionary, perform whatever business logic is  necessary, and relinquish control to another page, which in Listing 6-13 is to perform redirect.  If any of the form field values fails to pass a rule, then is_valid   returns False and in the process   creates an errors dictionary with details about the values that failed to pass their rules. Because of this last  automatic creation of errors, all that’s needed after is_valid   returns False is to return the same form  instance in order to display the errors dictionary to an end user so he can correct his mistakes.  230   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  But as important as the is_valid   method is to Django form processing, its validation is just done against   a form field’s data type. For example, is_valid   can validate if a value is left empty, if a value matches a given  number range, or even if a value is a valid date: in essence anything supported by Django form field types.  But what if you want to perform more sophisticated validation after is_valid   ? Like checking a value   against a database before deeming it valid or checking two values against one another  e.g., a provided zip  code value against a provided city value . While you can add these validation checks directly after the is_ valid   call, Django offers three more efficient ways to enforce advanced rules by adding them to the form  field or form class definition.  If you want a reusable validation mechanism you can use across multiple Django form fields, the best  choice is a validator assigned through a form field’s validators option. The validators form field option  expects a list of methods designed to raise a forms.ValidationError error in case a value doesn’t comply  with expected rules. Listing 6-14 illustrates a Django form with one of its fields using a custom validator  method via the validators option.  Listing 6-14.  Django form field validators option with custom validator method for form processing  from django import forms import re  def validate_comment_word_count value :       count = len value.split          if count < 30:              raise forms.ValidationError  'Please provide at least a 30 word message,   % count s words is not descriptive enough' , params={'count': count},   class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea,validators=[validate_comment_word_count]   The first section in Listing 6-14 shows the custom validate_command_word_count  method, which    rudimentarly  checks if message has at least 30 words. If the method’s input is not at least 30 words, Django’s  forms.ValidationError error is raised to indicate a rule violation.  In the bottom half of Listing 6-14 you can see a modified ContactForm where the comment field uses the   validators=[validate_csv] option. This tells Django that after is_valid   is run and all the form fields  have been checked for errors against their data types, it should also run the validate_comment_word_count  validator method against the value provided for the comment field. If the comment value does not comply  with this rule, then a ValidatioError error is raised, which is added to the form errors dictionary – the  same one described in the past section that is used to check field values against their data types.  As you can see from the example in Listing 6-14, you can equally reuse the custom validate_comment_word_  count   method on any other form field in the same form or in another Django form through the validators  option. In addition, you can also apply multiple validators to a field since the validators option accepts a list of  validators. Finally, it’s worth mentioning the django.core.validators package contains a series of validators you  can also reuse2 and which are used behind by the scenes by certain form field data types.  In addition to the form field validators option, it’s also possible to add validation form rules   through the clean_    and clean   methods, which are created as part of a Django form class -  just like __init__   described earlier. Just like methods specified in the form field validators option,  clean_    and clean   methods are automatically invoked when the is_valid   method is run.  Listing 6-15 illustrates the use of two clean_    methods.  2https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref validators built-in-validators  231   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Listing 6-15.  Django form field validation with clean_    methods  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea         def clean_name self :            Get the field value from cleaned_data dict           value = self.cleaned_data['name']            Check if the value is all upper case           if value.isupper  :               Value is all upper case, raise an error               raise forms.ValidationError "Please don't use all upper case for your name, use   lower case",code='uppercase'              Always return value           return value        def clean_email self :            Get the field value from cleaned_data dict           value = self.cleaned_data['email']            Check if the value end in @hotmail.com           if value.endswith '@hotmail.com' :               Value ends in @hotmail.com, raise an error               raise forms.ValidationError "Please don't use a hotmail email, we simply don't   like it",code='hotmail'              Always return value           return value  In Listing 6-15 there are two clean_    methods to add validation rules for the name and email   fields. Django automatically searches for form methods prefixed with clean_ and attempts to match a form’s  field names to the remaining name, to enforce validation on the field in question. This means you can have  as many clean_    methods as form fields.  The logic inside each clean_    method follows a similar pattern to validators methods. First   you extract a field’s value from the form’s cleaned_data dictionary via the self reference that represents  the form instance. Next, you run whatever rule or logic you want against the field value, and if you deem  the value doesn’t comply you raise a forms.ValidationError, which adds the error to the form instance.  Finally, and this is only different to validators methods, you must return the field value irrespective of  raising an error or changing its value.  Sometimes it’s necessary to apply a rule that doesn’t necessarily belong to a specific field, in which  case the generic clean   method is the preferred approach vs. a clean_    method. Listing 6-16  illustrates the use of the clean   method.  Listing 6-16.  Django form field validation with clean   method  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea   232   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms        def clean self :            Call clean   method to ensure base class validation           super ContactForm, self .clean               Get the field values from cleaned_data dict           name = self.cleaned_data.get 'name',''            email = self.cleaned_data.get 'email',''              Check if the name is part of the email           if name.lower   not in email:               Name is not in email, raise an error               raise forms.ValidationError "Please provide an email that contains your name,   or viceversa"   In Listing 6-16 you can see a similar approach to the previous clean_    methods in Listing 6-15.   But because the clean   method is a class-wide method and you’re overriding it yourself, it differs from  clean_    methods in that you must first explicitly call the clean   method of the base parent form  class  i.e., super ... .clean    to ensure the base class validation is applied. Form field value extraction  is also done through the cleaned_data data dictionary, as is the validation logic and raising of forms. ValidationError to indicate a rule violation. Finally, the clean   method differs from clean_     methods in that it doesn’t return a value.  Functionally the clean   method is different because it’s called after all the methods in the validators   options and clean_    methods, a behavior that’s important because all these methods rely on  data in the cleaned_data dictionary. This means if a validators or clean_    method raises a  ValidationError error it won’t return any value and the cleaned_data dictionary won’t contain a value for  this field. So by the time the clean   method is run, the cleaned_data dictionary may not necessarily have  all the form field values if one was short-circuited in a validators or clean_    method, which is the  reason why the clean   method uses the safer dictionary access syntax cleaned_data.get ' ',''   to assign a default value in case the cleaned_data dictionary doesn’t have a given field.  Another important behavioral difference between the clean   method, clean_    and   validators methods is how they treat forms.ValidationError. When a forms.ValidationError is raised  in a validators or clean_    method, the error is assigned to the   in question in the form’s  errors dictionary - which is important for display purposes. But when a forms.ValidationError is raised  in the clean   method, the error is assigned to a special placeholder field named __all__ – also known as  “non-field errors” – which is also placed in the form’s errors dictionary.  If you want to assign an error in the clean   method to a specific form field you can use the add_error     method as illustrated in Listing 6-17.  Listing 6-17.  Django form field error assignment with add_error   in clean   method  def clean self :      Call clean   method to ensure base class validation     super ContactForm, self .clean         Get the field values from cleaned_data dict     name = self.cleaned_data.get 'name',''        Check if the name is part of the email     if name.lower   not in email:         Name is not in email, raise an error        message = "Please provide an email that contains your name, or viceversa"        self.add_error 'name', message         self.add_error 'email', forms.ValidationError message          self.add_error None, message   233   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Notice how Listing 6-17 uses the add_error   method on the form instance instead of the raise   forms.ValidationError   syntax. The add_error   method accepts two arguments: the first one the form  field name on which to assign the error and the second can be either an error message string or an instance  of the ValidationError class.  The first two add_error   methods in Listing 6-17 assign the error to the name and email fields,   respectively. And the third add_error   method with the None key assigns the error to the __all__ placeholder  making it equivalent to raise forms.ValidationError   from Listing 6-16.  Error Form Values: Errors Form errors as its been described in the previous sections are automatically added to a form instance in  the errors dictionary after calling the is_valid   method. Inclusively, it’s possible to access the errors  dictionary directly without calling the is_valid   method, unlike the cleaned_data dictionary.  The errors dictionary is important because all form errors end up on it. Whether the errors are raised  because a value doesn’t comply with a form field data type or with raise forms.ValidationError   in the  clean   method, clean_    methods, validators methods or the add_error   method in the  clean   method, all errors end up in a form’s errors dictionary.  The errors dictionary follows the pattern {' ':' '} that makes it easy   to identify form errors in either a view method or in a template for display purposes. The only exception  to this last pattern occurs when a form error isn’t field specific  e.g., such as those created in the clean    method  in which case a form error is assigned to a special key named __all__, errors which are also  called non-field errors.  Although you can access the errors dictionary as any other Python dictionary, Django provides a series   of methods described in Table 6-1 to make working with errors much easier.  Table 6-1.  Django form errors methods  Method  Description  form.errors form.errors.as_data    form.errors.as_json   escape_html=False   form.add_error  field,message   form.has_error   field, code=None   Gives you access to the raw errors dictionary. Outputs a dictionary with the original ValidationError instances. For example,  if errors outputs {’email’:[’This field is required’]}, then errors.as_data   outputs  {’email’:[ValidationError [’This field is required’] ]}. Outputs a JSON structure with the contents of the errors dictionary. For example,  if errors outputs {’email’:[’This field is required’]}, then errors.as_json   outputs  {’email’:[{’message’:’This field is required’,’code’:’required’}]}. Note that by default  as_json   does not escape its output, if you want errors to be escaped use the  escape_html flag  e.g., as_json escape_html=True  . Associates an error message to a given form field. Although typically used in the  clean   method, it can be used in a view method if necessary. Note that if field is  not specified the error message goes on to form part of the __all__ placeholder  key in errors which are deemed non-field errors. Returns a True or False value if a given field has an error. Note that by default  has_error returns True if any error type is associated with a field. To perform the  evaluation against a particular error type you can use the code keyword  e.g.,  form.has_error ’email’,code=’required’  . To check if a form has non-field errors  you can use NON_FIELD_ERRORS as the field value.  form.non_field_errors   Returns a list of non-form errors associated with a form  i.e., the __all__   placeholder key . These errors are typically created in the clean   clean method  via ValidationError or add_error None,’message’ .  234   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  You may have noticed the ValidationError class instances created in all the previous examples use  different arguments, meaning there are multiple ways to create ValidationError instances. For example,  some ValidationError instances use a simple string, but it’s also possible to create a ValidationError  instance with a list of ValidationError instances, as well as specify a code attribute to further classify an  error type. Listing 6-18 illustrates a series of ValidationError class instances using these variations.  Listing 6-18.  Django form ValidationError instance creation  from django import forms   Placed inside def clean_email self : raise forms.ValidationError "Please don't use a hotmail email, we simply don't like  it",code='hotmail'    Placed inside def clean self : raise forms.ValidationError [       forms.ValidationError "Please provide an email that matches your name, or   viceversa",code='custom' ,        forms.ValidationError "Please provide your professional email, % value s doesn't look   professional ",code='required',params={'value':self.cleaned_data.get 'email'  }   The ValidationError instance variations presented in Listing 6-18 are all optional, but can become   powerful when it comes time to display or filter error messages on a template, a process that’s described in  detail in the “Set Up the Layout for Django Forms in Templates” section later in this chapter.  Django Form Field Types: Widgets, Options, and Validations  Because of the uncontrolled nature of the Internet - with its many types of devices, browsers, and user- experience levels - it creates all kinds of demands on web forms regarding the types of data they must  handle, as well as endless variations of how data must be sanitized to comply with the original purpose  of a web form.  When you create web forms for Django applications you rely on Django form classes, which are   composed of form fields. Each Django form field is important because it dictates a small piece of  functionality that eventually composes the bulk of a web form’s overall behavior.  Django form fields define two types of functionality, a form field’s HTML markup and its server-side   validation facilities. For example, a Django form field translates into the actual HTML form markup  e.g., an   ,   or   tag , the HTML markup attributes  e.g., length, whether a field can be left  blank, or if a field must be disabled , as well as the necessary hooks to easily perform server-side validation  on a form field’s data.  Django form fields define these two types of web form functionality out of necessity. Although browsers  have progressed tremendously with technologies like HTML5 to provide out-of-the-box form field validation  through the HTML markup itself – without JavaScript – a browser is still in full control of an end user that  with sufficient knowledge can bypass and feed whatever data he wants to a form. Therefore, it’s standard  practice to further inspect form field data once it’s submitted by users to see if it complies with a form’s rules,  a process that’s made very easy thanks to the use of Django form fields.  Table 6-2 illustrates the various Django forms fields, including their type, the HTML they produce, their   default widget, and their validation behavior.  235   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms           x o b k c e h c L M T H   s e t a r e n e G           a n i a t b o o t   p u k r a m    t u p n  i       ; e u l a v e s l a F   r o e u r T n a e l o o B              k c e h c e h t   n e h w e s l a F   s n r u t e r        n e h w e u r T       ,  d e k c e h c n u   s i   x o b  .  d e k c e h c   s i   x o b k c e h c e h t           d l e i F n a e l o o B e k i l   t s u     j   s k r o W     ” n w o n k n U “   s w o     l l a o s l a   t u b        e h t   n e h w e n o N   s n r u t e r   ; e u l a v    ,  d e t c e l e s   s i   e u l a v     1   n w o n k n U    s i   e u l a v     2   s e Y e h t   n e h w e u r T              e h t   n e h w e s l a F d n a d e t c e l e s        .  d e t c e l e s   s i   e u l a v     3   o N     5 L M T H   s i h t   e t o N    .  p u k r a m        y l n o d n a n o i t a d     i l a v   l i a m e     e d i s -

For example, you can use the CharField   form field type to capture standard  text or the more specialized EmailField   form field type to ensure the captured value is a valid email. Just  as you can use ChoiceField   to generate a form list with predefined values or DateField   to enforce a  form value is a valid date.  The Relationship between Widgets and Form Fields In Table 6-2 you can see that besides the actual Django form field syntax  e.g., forms.CharField  , forms. ImageField    each form field is associated with a default widget. Django widgets for the most part go  unnoticed and are often mixed together with the functionality of a form field itself  e.g., if you want an HTML  text input   you use forms.CharField   . However, when you require changes to the  HTML produced by a form field or the way a form field’s data is initially processed, you’ll need to work with  widgets.  To make matters a little more confusing, there are many options you specify on form fields that end up   being used as part of a widget. For example, the form field forms.CharField max_length=25  tells Django to  limit a value to a maximum of 25 characters upon processing, but this same max_length option is passed to  the forms.widgets.TextInput   widget to generate the HTML    to enforce the same rule on the browser via the HTML maxlength="25" attribute. So in this case, you can  actually change the HTML output through a form field option, without even knowing about widgets!  So do you really need to work with widgets to change the HTML produced by a form field? The answer   is it depends. A lot of form fields options are automatically passed to a widget behind the scenes in effect  altering the generated HTML, but make no mistake about it, it’s a widget that’s tasked with generating the  HTML and not a form field. For cases when a form field’s options can’t achieve a desired HTML output, then  it becomes necessary to change a form field’s widget to achieve a custom HTML output.  In upcoming sections in this chapter, I’ll expand on the topic of Django widgets and describe how to   override and customize a Django form field’s default widget. Now that you know about the existence of  Django widgets and their relationship with Django form fields, I’ll continue on the topic of Django form  fields and explain the various Django form field options and their validation behavior.  DJANGO ‘HIDDEN’ BUILT-IN WIDGETS  Table 6-2 shows all the built-in form fields in Django, which can mislead you to believe the same table  also shows all Django built-in form widgets. This is not the case. The widget column in Table 6-2 only  shows the default widgets assigned to all built-in form fields. There are a few more Django built-in  widgets you can use that are also included in the forms.widgets. package:      PasswordInput.- Widget for password field  e.g., displays **** as a user types text . also  supports re-display of a field value after validation error.     hiddenInput.- Widget for hidden field  e.g.,  .     multiplehiddenInput.- Like hiddenInput but for multiple values  i.e., a list .      Textarea.- Widget for text area field  e.g.,    .  radioselect.- Like the select widget, but generates a list of radio buttons  e.g.,   <input  type="radio"> ..   .  245   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Checkboxselectmultiple.- Like the selectmultiple widget, but generates a list of check boxes  e.g.,      ..   .  TimeInput.- Like the DateTimeInput widget, but for time input only  e.g., 13:54, 13:54:59 .  selectDateWidget.- Widget to generate three select widgets for date  e.g., select widget for day, select  widget for month, select widget for year .  splithiddenDateTimeWidget.- Like the splitDateTimeWidget widget, but uses hidden input for date and  time.  FileInput.- Like the ClearableFileInput widget, but without a check box input to clear the field’s value.  Future sections in this chapter that describe a form field’s widget argument and how to customize  Django widgets, provide more context on how and when to use these additional built-in widgets.  Empty, Default, and Predetermined Values: Required, Initial, and  Choices By default, all Django form fields are marked as required, which means every field must contain a value  to pass validation. The required argument is valid on all Django form fields described in Table 6-2 and in  addition to enforcing a value is not empty on the server-side, the HTML 5 required attribute is also assigned  to a form field so a user’s browser also enforces validation.   You can initialize a form with use_required_field=False to forgo the use of the hTmL 5 required      Tip  attribute. see the previous subsection entitled “Initialize Forms.”  If you want to allow a field value to be left empty - None or empty string '' -- then a field must be   assigned the required=False argument.  You can also assign a default value to a field through the initial argument. The initial argument is   equally valid across all Django form fields described in Table 6-2 and is described in detail in the previous  subsection “Initialize forms.”  For cases in which you don’t want to allow a user the ability to introduce open-ended values for a field  you can restrict a field’s values to a predetermined set of values through the choices argument. If you want  to use the choices attribute you must use a form field data type designed to generate an HTML    list such as forms.ChoiceField  , forms.MultipleChoiceField, or forms.FielPathField  . The choices  argument cannot be used on data types like forms.CharField   designed for open-ended input.  Limiting Text Values: max_length, min_length, strip, and Validators Form field data types that accept text such as CharField  , EmailField  , and others described in Table 6-2,   can accept both the max_length and min_length arguments to restrict a field’s value to a maximum and  minimum character length, respectively.  The strip argument is used to apply Python’s strip   method - which strips all trailing and leading   whitespace - to a field’s value. The strip argument can only be used on two Django field data types,  CharField   that defaults to strip=True, and RegexField   that defaults to strip=False.  246   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  To apply more advanced limitation rules on fields that accept text values, see the previous subsection   on “Validating Form Values,” which describes validators and other techniques to limit field values.  Limiting Number Values: max_value, min_value, max_digits,   decimal_places, and Validators Form field data types that accept numbers such as IntegerField  , DecimalField  , and FloatField    can accept both the max_value and min_value arguments to restrict the upper and lower bounds of a field’s  number value, respectively.  In addition, the DecimalField   data type, which accepts more elaborate number types, can use the   max_digits argument to restrict the maximum number of digits in a value or the decimal_places argument  to specify the maximum number of decimal places in a value.  To apply more advanced limitation rules on fields that accept number values, see the previous   subsection on “Validating Form Values,” which describes validators and other techniques to limit field  values.  Error Messages: error_messages Every Django field data type has built-in error messages. For example, when a field data type is required  and no value is added by a user, Django assigns the error message This field is required to the field, as  part of a form’s errors dictionary. Similarly, if a field data type uses the max_length argument and the value  provided by a user exceeds this threshold, Django creates the error message Ensure this value has at  most X characters  it has X .  As described earlier in Listing 6-18, Django error messages are typically given a message error code  in addition to the error message itself. And it’s these message error codes that are used to assign custom  messages via the error_messages argument.  The error_messages argument expects a dictionary where each key is the message error code and its  value a custom error message. For example, to provide a custom message for the required code you would  use the syntax forms.CharField error_messages={"required":"Please, pretty please provide a  comment"} .Similarly, if you expect a form field to violate its max_length value, you would assign a custom  error message through the max_length code  e.g., error_messages={"max_length":"This value exceeds  its max length value"} .  Error codes generally map directly to the rule they violate  e.g., if a forms.IntegerField violates its   max_value, Django uses the max_value code to assign a default error message, which you can override  by using this code . However, there are over two dozen built-in error message codes  e.g., 'missing',  'contradiction' , some of which are not too obvious. For example, a forms.ImageField can generate  the error message 'Upload a valid image. The file you uploaded was either not an image or a  corrupted image.', which uses the 'invalid_image' error code, meaning that to override this default error  message you would need to know the error code beforehand to declare it as part of error_messages.  For the most part, customizing error messages for some of the more esoteric error codes is rarely   needed. But if you’re having trouble customizing error messages for a given field because you can’t  determine its error code, a little logging debugging on a form errors dictionary  e.g., form.errors.as_json    or some of the other methods in Table 6-1  can quickly net you a form’s error codes to override the messages  with the error_messages argument.  247   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Field Layout Values: label, label_suffix, help_text When you output a form field in a template besides the essential HTML form field markup  e.g., <input  type="text">  it’s almost always accompanied by a human-friendly descriptor to indicate what a field is  for  e.g., Email:   . This human-friendly descriptor is called a label and by default in  Django it’s assigned the same value as the field name.  To customize a form field’s label you can use the label argument. For example, to provide a more  descriptive label for a field named email you can use the syntax email = EmailField label="Please  provide your email" . By default, all labels on a form are accompanied by the : symbol, which functions  as a suffix. You can further customize the output of field labels with the label_suffix argument on  individual form fields or the form instance itself.  For example, the syntax email = EmailField label_suffix='-->'  overrides the default suffix label   on the email field for the --> symbol.   The label_suffix can also be used to initialize a form  e.g., form = ContactForm label_     Tip  suffix='-->'    so all fields receive a label suffix, instead of doing it field by field. see the “Initialize   Forms” section earlier for more details.  In certain circumstances it can be helpful to add more explicit instructions to a form field; for such   cases you can use the help_text argument. Depending on the template layout you use, the help_text value  is added right next to the HTML form field markup.  For example, the syntax comment = CharField help_text="Please be as specific as possible   to receive a quick response"  generates the given html_text value right next to the comment input field   e.g., Please be as specific as possible to receive a quick response   . The  next section “Set Up the Layout for Django Forms in Templates” goes into greater detail on the use of help_ text and other form layout properties.  Set Up the Layout for Django Forms in Templates  When you pass a Django form - unbound or bound - to a template there are many options to generate its  layout. You can use one of Django’s pre-built HTML helpers to quickly generate a form’s output or granularly  output each field to create an advanced form layout  e.g., responsive design3 .In addition, there can also  be many ways to output form errors  e.g., besides the fields themselves or at the top of a form . Up next, I’ll  describe the various options to output Django forms in templates.  Listing 6-19 shows the Django form I’ll use throughout the remaining layout sections – which is the   same form used throughout this chapter.  Listing 6-19.  Django form class definition  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea   3https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Responsive_web_design  248   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Output Form Fields: form.as_table, form.as_p, form.as_ul, and  Granularly by Field Django forms offer three helper methods to simplify the output of all form fields. The syntax form.as_table  outputs a form’s fields to accommodate an HTML   as illustrated in Listing 6-20. The syntax form.as_p  outputs a form’s fields with HTML   tags as illustrated in Listing 6-21. Where as the syntax form.as_ul outputs  a form’s fields to accommodate an HTML   list tag, as illustrated in Listing 6-22.     Caution   If you use form.as_table, form.as_p, form.as_ul you must declare opening closing hTmL tags, a  wrapping   tag, a Django {% csrf_token %} tag and an   button, as described in  the initial section of this chapter “Functional web form syntax for Django forms”.  Listing 6-20.  Django form output with form.as_table          Name:            \n         Your email:            \n         Comment:          \r\n<   textarea>      Listing 6-21.  Django form output with form.as_p         Name:     \n         Your email:  <input id="id_email" name="email" type="email"   required >   '   \n         Comment:  <textarea cols="40" id="id_comment"   name="comment" rows="10" required>\r\n   Listing 6-22.  Django form output with form.as_ul         Name:     \n    249   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  required >           Your email:  <input id="id_email" name="email" type="email"    \n        Comment:  <textarea cols="40" id="id_comment"   name="comment" rows="10" required>\r\n    The form.as_table, form.as_p & form.as_ul output can be made less verbose - omitting label tags      Tip  and id attributes - by initializing the form with auto_id=False. In addition, you can also change the symbol  that separates label names  by default :  with another symbol by initializing the form with the label_suffix  variable. It’s also possible to use the field_order option to alter the output field order.  Under certain circumstances, none of the previous helper methods may be sufficient to achieve   certain form layouts. For example, to create a responsive design you’ll need to output each field manually  to accommodate specific layout requirements  e.g., Bootstrap CSS grid columns . To achieve the custom  output of fields, every form instance permits access to its fields through the form.  syntax using  the attributes in Table 6-3.  Table 6-3.  Django form field attributes accessible in templates  Attribute name  Description  {{form. }}  i.e. No  attribute, just the field name by  itself  {{form. .name}} {{form. .value}}  {{form. .label}}  {{form. .id_for_label}}  {{form. .auto_id}}  {{form. .label_tag}}  {{form. .help_text}} {{form. .errors}} {{form. .css_classes}}  250  Outputs the HTML form tag - technically known as the Django  widget - associated with the field  e.g.,  .   Outputs the name of a field, as defined in the form class. Outputs the value of the field assigned with initial or user-provided  data. Useful if you need to separately output the HTML form  tag’s value attribute  e.g., for <input type=“text” name=“name”  value=“John Doe”>, {{form.name.value}} outputs John Doe . Outputs the label of a field, which by default uses the syntax “Your   ”  e.g., for the email field, {{form.email.label}} outputs  Your email . Outputs the label id of a field, which by default uses the syntax  id_   e.g., for the email field, {{form.email.id_for_label}}  outputs id_email . Outputs the auto id of a field, which by default uses the syntax  id_   e.g., for the email field, {{form.email.auto_id}}  outputs id_email . Helper method to output the HTML   tag along with id_for_ label and label e.g., for the email field, {{form.email.label_tag}}  outputs  Your email:  . Outputs the help text associated with a field. Outputs the errors associated with a field. Outputs the CSS classes associated with a field.   continued    ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Table 6-3.   continued  Attribute name  {{form. .as_hidden}}  {{form. .is_hidden}} {{form. .as_text}}  {{form. .as_textarea}}  {{form. .as_widget}}  Description  Outputs the HTML of a field as a hidden HTML field  e.g., <input  type=“hidden” > . Boolean result of a field’s hidden status. Outputs the HTML of a field as a text HTML field  e.g., <input  type=“text”> . Outputs the HTML of a field as a textarea HTML field  e.g.,     .  Outputs the Django widget associated with a field; technically  produces the same output as calling the stand-alone field with the  syntax {{form. }} – shown at the top of this table.   You can override the default output for {{form. .label}}, the suffix for      Tip  {{form. .label_tag}}, and the default output for {{form. .help_text}} in  Table 6-4, by using the label, label_suffix, and help_text options on form fields. This process is described  in the previous section on “Django Form Field Types: Widgets, options, and Validations.”  As you can see in Table 6-4, there are many field attributes available to customize the layout of a form.  Just be careful that if you output form fields granularly you don’t miss a field, because if you do miss a field,  the most likely outcome is Django won’t be able to process the form as it won’t receive values from missing  fields.  Listing 6-23 illustrates a standard {% for %} loop that ensures you don’t miss any field and provides   more flexibility than the previous form.as_table, form.as_p & form.as_ul methods.  Listing 6-23.  Django form {% for %} loop over all fields  {% for field in form %}                        {{ field.label_tag }}         {% if field.help_text %}            {{ field.help_text }}          {% endif %}         {{ field.errors }}                    {{ field }}                 {% endfor %}  In Listing 6-23, a loop is created over the form reference to ensure no fields are missed. If you want to  avoid presenting a field in certain form layouts, then I recommend you use the {{field.as_hidden}} vs.  {{field}}, as this ensures the field still forms part of the form for validation purposes and is simply hidden  from a user – more details about this scenario are provided in the upcoming section on advanced form  processing and partial forms.  251   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Output Field Order: field_order and order_fields If you use any of the techniques presented in Listings 6-20, 6-21, 6-22, or 6-23, the form fields are output in  the same order as they’re declared in the form class in Listing 6-19  i.e., name, email, comment . However,  you can use several techniques to alter the order in which form fields are output.  The first and obvious approach is to change the form field order directly in the form class definition.   Because this last technique requires altering a form’s source code, Django also offers the field_order  option. The field_order option accepts a list of form field names in the order you want them output  e.g.,  field_order=['email','name','comment'] outputs the email field first, followed by name and comment .  The field_order option is flexible enough that you can provide a partial list of form fields  e.g., field_ order=['email'] outputs the email field first and the remaining form fields in their declared order  as well  as declare nonexistent field names that are ignored and is helpful when using form inheritance.  The field_order option can be declared in two locations. First, it can be declared as part of a form class   definition, as illustrated in Listing 6-24.  Listing 6-24.  Django form field_order option to enforce field order  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea        field_order = ['email','comment','name']  As you can see in Listing 6-24, field_order is declared as any other form field and assigned a list of field   names to ensure the fields are output in the order: email, comment, and name. It’s also possible to use the  field_order option as part of a form’s initialization processes - described in detail in the form processing  section. It’s worth mentioning that if you use the field_order option on both the class definition - as shown  in Listing 6-24 - and form instance initialization, the latter value takes precedence over the former.  In addition to the field_order option, Django also offers order_fields that also expects a list of   field names to alter a form’s output field order. But unlike the field_order option that must be declared  in a form class or as part of the initialization of a form instance, order_fields can be called directly on  a form instance, which makes it a good option to use in a view method or template  e.g., form.order_ fields ['email']  .  Output CSS Classes, Styles, and Field Attributes: error_css_class,  required_css_class, Widget, Customization, and Various Form Field  Options By default, when you output form fields and labels there are no CSS classes or styles associated with them.  Django offers several mechanisms to associate CSS classes with form fields. The first two approaches are  the error_css_class and required_css_class fields, which are declared directly in a Django form, as  illustrated in Listing 6-25.  252   Listing 6-25.  Django form error_css_class and required_css_class fields to apply CSS formatting  ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False        email = forms.EmailField label='Your email'        comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea        error_css_class = 'error'       required_css_class = 'bold'  As you can see in Listing 6-25, the error_css_class and required_css_class fields are added just   like regular form fields. When a field associated with a form instance of this kind is rendered on a template,  Django adds the error CSS class to all fields marked with an error and adds the bold CSS class to all fields  marked as required.  For example, all form fields are treated as required except when they explicitly use required=False.   This means if you output an unbound form instance from Listing 6-25 using form.as_p, the comment field is  output as  Comment:  \r\n     -- note the class in the   tag. Similarly, if a field associated with a bound form instance  from Listing 6-25 raises an error, Django adds the error CSS class to the field  e.g., if the email field value  is not valid, the email field is output as  Your email: <input name="email"  type="email" value="aninvalidemail" required  > , note the bold CSS class remains because the  form field is also required .  As helpful as the error_css_class and required_css_class fields are, they still offer limited CSS   formatting functionality. To gain full control over CSS class output, you’ll need to either use some of the  more granular output options for fields in Table 6-4 or customize a form field’s widget as illustrated in  Listing 6-26.  Listing 6-26.  Django form with inline widget definition to add custom CSS class  from django import forms  class ContactForm forms.Form :       name = forms.CharField required=False         email = forms.EmailField label='Your email', widget=forms.TextInput attrs={'class' :   'myemailclass'}          comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea   Notice in Listing 6-26 how the email field is declared with the widget=forms.  TextInput attrs={'class' : 'myemailclass'}  argument. This last statement tells Django that when it  outputs the email field, it use the custom forms.TextInput widget, which declares the CSS class attribute  with the myemailclass value.  By using the form definition in Listing 6-26, the email field is output as <input class="myemailclass"   type="text"...>. If you don’t know what a Django widget is, see the earlier section entitled “The  Relationship between Widgets and Form Fields.”  The approach presented in Listing 6-26 is a powerful technique, because just as you can declare the   CSS class attribute, you can also declare any other form field HTML attribute. For example, if you wanted  to declare custom HTML attributes - such as those used by frameworks like jQuery or Bootstrap -- you can  easily use this same technique  e.g., widget=forms.TextInput attrs={'role' : 'dialog'}  would output    .  253   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  However, a word of caution now that you know how easy it is to output any HTML attribute alongside   a Django form field. Be aware that nearly all Django form field data types come with built-in options that  get translated into HTML attributes. For example, the forms.CharField max_length=25  statement gets  output to  , which means the form field max_length option  automatically generates the HTML maxlength="25" attribute. So be careful to start adding HTML attributes  indiscriminately using the approach in Listing 6-26, as they may already be supported through built-in data  type options. See the previous section on “Django Form Field Types: Widgets, Options and Validations” for  more details on these built-in data type options.  Output Form Field Errors: form. .errors, form.errors,  form.non_field_errors Just as form fields can be output in different ways, form field errors can also be output in different ways.  Toward the end of the first section in Listing 6-23, you can see how we use the {{field.errors}} syntax  to output errors associated with a particular field. However, an important thing to keep in mind when  outputting a field’s errors value in this manner is the output is generated as an HTML formatted list:         Name is required.     As you can see in Listing 6-27, the {{fields.errors}} value is list with the errorlist CSS class - which  allows you to provide CSS behaviors like a background color or borders - and the values are pre-wrapped as  list elements.  If you want to strip these wrapping HTML list tags to gain more control over the error layout  e.g.,   creating a responsive design or CSV list  you can do so creating a loop on each field.errors as illustrated   in Listing 6-27.  Listing 6-27.  Django loop over form. .errors   {% for field in form %}                       {{ field.label_tag }}         {% if field.help_text %}            {{ field.help_text }}            {% endif %}           {% for error in field.errors %}                            {{error}}                         {% endfor %}                    {{ field }}                  {% endfor %}  You can see in Listing 6-27 that inside the loop for each field, another loop is made on the field.errors   reference to granularly output and assign custom markup to each field error.  254   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  As granular as the error output in Listing 6-27 is, this type of layout assumes you want to display a form’s   error messages besides each field, in addition to requiring a loop over a form’s fields. But what if you want  to display a form’s errors at the top or besides the main form? Or if you want to keep using Django’s shortcut  methods  i.e., form.as_table, form.as_p & form.as_ul  and still display errors?  Besides the form. .errors syntax in Listing 6-27 to access field errors, Django also can   output form’s errors with the errors and non_field_errors dictionaries as illustrated in Listing 6-28.  Listing 6-28.  Django form.errors and form.non_field_errors with custom HTML output     {% if form.errors %}         {% for field_with_error,error_messages in form.errors.items %}          {{field_with_error}}  {{error_messages}}      {% endfor %}       {% endif %}     {% if form.non_field_errors %}         {% for error in form.non_field_errors %}      {{error}}      {% endfor %}       {% endif %}  As you can see in Listing 6-28, the form.errors dictionary provides an aggregated version of all the  form. .errors, where each dictionary key represents the form field name and the value is  a list of error messages with error code  e.g., required  to further filter the error list. If you want to output  every form error at the top of a form page, require error filtering by code type or want to keep using Django’s  shortcut output form methods  e.g., form.as_table  and obtain form errors, then using form.errors on a  template is the way to go.  In addition, notice toward the top of Listing 6-28 the loop over the form.non_field_errors dictionary.  The form.non_field_errors contains errors that don’t belong to a specific form field – as discussed earlier  in the “Error Form Values: Errors” section and the special error placeholder field named __all__. Because  non-field errors don’t apply to a specific form field, it’s common to output these type of errors at the top of a  form accessing the non_field_errors dictionary.  Be aware that if you use form.errors or form.non_field_errors to output errors, by default the error   reference – {{error_messages}} and {{error}} in Listing 6-28 – are wrapped as an HTML formatted list   e.g.,   ...    but you can add an additional for loop to the error   list - as in Listing 6-27 - to create a custom HTML error layout.  Finally, it’s worth mentioning there are a series of auxiliary methods designed to facilitate error output    e.g., in JSON format ; Table 6-1 in the Django form processing section describes these methods.  Django Custom Form Fields and Widgets  In Table 6-2 you saw the wide variety of built-in Django form fields, from basic text and number types,  to more specialized text types  e.g., CSV, predefined options , including file and directory types. But as  extensive as these built-in form fields are, in certain circumstances it can be necessary to build custom   form fields.  255   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Similarly, in Table 6-2 you learned how all Django forms fields are linked to Django widgets that define   the HTML produced by a form field. While in previous sections  e.g., Listings 6-25 and 6-26  you learned  how it’s possible to use a form field’s widget property to override its default widget with custom properties   e.g., a CSS class attribute  or assign it a different widget altogether  e.g., a forms.Textarea widget to a  forms.CharField field , in certain circumstances, playing around with Django’s built-in widgets  i.e., adding  attributes or switching one built-in widget for another  can be insufficient for complex HTML form inputs.  Up next, you’ll learn how to customize both Django form fields and widgets.  CUSTOMIZE DJANGO FORM FIELDS, WIDGETS, OR BOTH?  as you’ve learned throughout this chapter, there’s a fuzzy relationship between a form field and a form  widget, which can make it hard to determine which one to customize when built-in options become  insufficient.  as a rule of thumb, if you need to constantly change a form field’s data or validation logic, you should  use a custom form field. If you need to constantly change a form field’s hTmL output  e.g., form tags,  Css classes, javascript events , you should use a custom widget.  Create Custom Form Fields The good news about creating custom form fields is you don’t have to write everything from scratch,  compared to other custom Django constructs  e.g., a custom template filter or context processor . Since  Django’s built-in form fields are subclasses that inherit their behavior from the forms.Form class, you can  further subclass a built-in form field into a more specialized form field. Therefore, a custom form field can  start with a basic set of functionalities present in a built-in form field, which you can then customize as  required.  For example, if you find yourself creating forms with the built-in forms.FileField and constantly  customizing it in a certain way  e.g., for certain file sizes or types , you can create a custom form field    e.g., PdfFileField, MySpecialFileField  that inherits the behavior from forms.FileField, customize it,  and use the custom form field directly in your forms.  Listing 6-29 illustrates a custom form field that inherits its behavior from the built-in forms.  ChoiceField form field.  Listing 6-29.  Django custom form field inherits behavior from forms.ChoiceField  class GenderField forms.ChoiceField :       def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :             super GenderField, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs              self.error_messages = {"required":"Please select a gender, it's required"}             self.choices =   None,'Select gender' , 'M','Male' , 'F','Female'    As you can see in Listing 6-29, the GenderField class inherits its behavior from the built-in forms.  ChoiceField field class, giving it automatic access to the same behaviors and features as this latter class.  Next, the __init__ method – used to initialize instances of the class – a call to super   is made to ensure the  initialization process of the parent class  i.e., forms.ChoiceField  is made and immediately after values are  assigned to the error_messages and choices fields.  256   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  The error_messages and choices fields in Listing 6-29 might look familiar because they’re arguments   typically used in the built-in forms.ChoiceField and are part of Django’s standard form field arguments  described earlier in this chapter. You can similarly add any other argument supported by form fields   e.g., self.required, self.widget  so the custom form field is created with behaviors set by form field  arguments.  Once you have a custom form field like the one in Listing 6-29, you can use it to declare a form  field in a Django form class  e.g., gender =  .GenderField   vs. gender = forms. ChoiceField error_messages={...},choices=...  . As you can see, custom form fields are a great choice  if you’re doing repetitive customizations on built-in form fields.  Customize Built-In Widgets In Listings 6-25 and 6-26 you already explored some customizations associated with Django’s built-in  widgets. For example, in Listing 6-25 you saw how it’s possible to customize the default built-in widget  assigned to form fields, while in Listing 6-26 you saw how it’s possible to add custom attributes to built-in  widgets. In this section you’ll learn how to globally customize built-in widgets.  Looking back at Table 6-2, you can see, for example, the forms.widget.TextInput   widget produces   an HTML output like   and similarly all the other widgets in Table 6-2 produce  their own specific HTML output.  Given the high expectations set forth by many front-end designs, producing this type of basic   boilerplate HTML output can be a non-starter for a lot of Django projects. For example, if you want to tightly  integrate JavaScript jQuery or ReactJS logic into HTML forms, customizing the default HTML produced  by Django’s built-in widgets can be a necessity. In these circumstances, the ideal approach is to produce  custom HTML for Django’s built-in widgets, forgoing the use of the default markup defined by Django in its  out-of-the-box state.  The first thing you need to know about customizing Django’s built-in widgets is where Django keeps its  default built-in widgets. Django builds the HTML output for its built-in widgets from the Django templates  located inside the django forms templates django forms widgets  directory in the main Django  distribution  e.g., if your Python installation is located at  python coffeehouse lib python3.5 site- packages , append this directory path to locate the widget templates .  If you look inside this last directory, you’ll find templates  e.g., input.html, radio.html  for each   built-in Django widget. Be aware all these widgets templates don’t use plain HTML, but instead use Django  template syntax  e.g., {% include %} tags, {% if %} conditionals   to favor code reuse. If you’re unfamiliar  with Django template syntax, look over Chapter 3.  Now, while you could directly modify the templates in this location to alter the HTML output produced  by each widget, don’t do this. The recommended approach to customize the output for each built-in widget  is to include custom built-in widgets on a project basis. Therefore the first step to customize Django’s built-in  widgets is to build custom built-in widgets and make them part of a Django project.   Copy all the built-in widgets in the Django distribution  i.e., the templates inside django forms      Tip  templates django forms widgets   to your project and modify them as needed.  Since built-in widgets are Django templates, and they need to be placed in a project directory where   they can be discovered. This means custom built-in widgets must be placed in a project directory that’s  part of the DIRS list declared in the TEMPLATES variable in settings.py. In most cases, a project declares a  directory named templates – as part of DIRS – that also contains a project’s templates – but you can use any  directory so long as it’s declared as part of DIRS – see the section “Template Search Paths” in Chapter 3 for  more details on DIRS.  257   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Besides using a directory that’s part of the DIRS list to locate widget templates, Django also expects to   locate custom built-in widgets in the same path it uses for its default built-in widgets  i.e., those included in  the Django distribution .  Therefore, if you have a project directory named templates as part of the DIRS list, inside this templates  directory you’ll need to create the same directory path django forms widgets  and inside this last widgets  subdirectory place the custom built-in widgets  e.g., to customize the built-in input.html widget located in  the Django distribution at django forms templates django forms widgets input.html you would create  a project version at   templates django forms widgets input.html, this way the latter  input.html template takes precedence over the default built-in distribution template .  Once you have the custom built-in widgets set up in your project, you need to make two configuration   changes to your project’s settings.py. The first configuration requires you add the FORM_RENDERER variable,  as follows:  FORM_RENDERER = 'django.forms.renderers.TemplatesSetting'  By default, Django built-in widgets are loaded through a stand-alone Django template renderer –   django.forms.renderers.DjangoTemplates – which is unrelated to a project’s main TEMPLATES configuration  containing the DIRS list with a project’s templates. Because you now placed custom built-in widgets inside  a directory declared as part of the DIRS list, you need to configure Django to use a project’s main TEMPLATES  configuration as part of the form-rendering process. By setting the FORM_RENDERER variable to django. forms.renderers.TemplatesSetting, Django also inspects paths in the DIRS list of the main TEMPLATES  configuration for built-in widgets. The last subsection on widgets provides additional details on the FORM_ RENDERER variable.  Finally, because you’re overriding the django.forms package in a project to get custom built-in widgets,   you must also declare the django.forms package as part of the INSTALLED_APPS list in settings.py.  Create Custom Form Widgets Custom form widgets are used for cases where you need to keep Django’s built-in widget functionality as is,  but still need to customize the HTML output produced by widgets.   Before creating custom form widgets, look closely at the built-in widgets in Table 6-2 and the widgets      Tip  in the sidebar “Django hidden Built-In Widgets.” You may be able to find what you’re looking for without the  need to create custom widgets.  Similar to custom form fields, custom form widgets have the advantage of being class based and  can therefore inherit their behavior from built-in widgets. For example, if you find yourself constantly  customizing the built-in forms.widgets.TextInput widget in a certain way  e.g., HTML attributes or  JavaScript events , you can create a custom widget  e.g., CustomerWidget, EmployeeWidget  that inherits its  behavior from forms.widgets.TextInput, customize it, and use the custom widget directly in form fields.  For example, let’s say you’re constantly modifying Django text widgets to include the HTML 5   placeholder attribute – used to give end users a hint about the purpose of an input form field and which  goes away when a user focuses on a field. Listing 6-30 illustrates a custom form widget that generates the  HTML 5 placeholder attribute based on the field name attribute assigned to a widget.  258   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Listing 6-30.  Django custom form widget inherits behavior from forms.widgets.Input  class PlaceholderInput forms.widgets.Input :       template_name = 'about placeholder.html'       input_type = 'text'       def get_context self, name, value, attrs :             context = super PlaceholderInput, self .get_context name, value, attrs              context['widget']['attrs']['maxlength'] = 50             context['widget']['attrs']['placeholder'] = name.title               return context     Note  The forms.widgets.Input widget is a more general purpose widget than forms.widgets. TextInput and does not include text input behaviors; hence it’s often the preferred choice to build custom  widgets due to its basic feature set. It’s worth mentioning forms.widgets.Input is the parent widget of forms. widgets.TextInput, forms.widgets.NumberInput, forms.widgets.EmailInput and other input widgets  described in Table 6-2.  As you can see in Listing 6-30, the PlaceholderInput class inherits its behavior from the built-in forms.  widgets.Input widget class, giving it access to the same behaviors and features as this latter class.  Next are two class fields. The template_name field defines the backing template for the custom widget   which points to 'about placeholder.html'– note that if you omit the template_name field, the parent class  template is used  i.e., for the forms.widgets.Input widget the template is django forms widgets input. html . The input_type field is a requirement for forms.widgets.Input subclasses and is used to assign the  HTML input type attribute, values can include: text, number, email, url, password, or any other valid HTML  input type value.  Inside the custom widget class is the get_context   method, which is used to set the context for the   backing widget template – just like standard Django templates. In this case, a call is made to super   to  ensure the context for the parent widget class template  i.e., forms.widgets.Input  is set and immediately  after a pair of attributes – maxlength and placeholder – are set on the widget context in the ['widget'] ['attrs'] dictionary for use inside the widget template. Note the value for maxlength is fixed and the value  for placeholder is taken from the field name attribute and converted to a title with Python’s standard title  method. Finally, the get_context   method returns the updated context reference to pass it to the widget  template.  Now let’s take a look at the widget template 'about placeholder.html' in Listing 6-31.  Listing 6-31.  Django custom form widget inherits behavior from forms.widgets.Input   about placeholder.html <input type="{{ widget.type }}" name="{{ widget.name }}"{% if widget.value != None %}  value="{{ widget.value }}"{% endif %}{% include "django forms widgets attrs.html" %}  >   django forms widgets attrs.html {% for name, value in widget.attrs.items %}{% if value is not False %} {{ name }}{% if value  is not True %}="{{ value }}"{% endif %}{% endif %}{% endfor %}  You can see in Listing 6-31 the HTML input tag is generated with values from the widget dictionary set  through the get_context method. The values for widget.type, widget.name, and widget.value are all set  behind the scenes in the parent class  i.e., forms.widgets.Input . In addition, notice the HTML input tag  uses the built-in widget template django forms widgets attrs.html shown at the bottom of Listing 6-31.   259   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  This last widget template loops over all the elements in the widgets.attrs context dictionary and generates  the input attributes. Since the widgets.attrs context dictionary is modified in Listing 6-30 to include the  maxlength and placeholder attributes, the input tag is generated with these additional attributes  e.g.,    .  Now let’s take a step back to discuss the location of the 'about placeholder.html' widget template.   By default, Django custom widgets are only searched for inside the templates folders in all Django apps  defined in INSTALLED_APPS. This means that in order for Django to find the custom 'about placeholder. html' widget template, it must be placed inside any project app’s templates folder  e.g., given a project app  named about, the custom widget should be located under templates about placeholder.html, where the  templates folder is at the same level of an app’s models.py and views.py files . It’s possible to define custom  widgets on a global directory, but I’ll discuss this in the last subsection on widgets.  Finally, once you define the custom widget in the right location, you can use it as part of a Django form  field  e.g., email=forms.EmailField widget= .PlaceholderInput    to generate an HTML  input tag with a default placeholder attribute.  Custom Form Widget Configuration Options In the previous two sections on customizing form widgets, I didn’t mention a variety of configuration  options in order to avoid getting sidetracked from the main task at hand. But now that you know how to  customize Django’s built-in widgets and how to create custom form widgets, I can provide you with these  additional details.  The first topic is related to finding and loading custom widget templates. Django defines a form   renderer through the FORM_RENDERER variable in settings.py. Table 6-4 describes the three different values  supported by the FORM_RENDERER variable.  Table 6-4.  FORM_RENDERER values that influence finding and loading custom widget templates  Form renderer class  Description  django.forms.renderers.DjangoTemplates  Default  Searches and loads widget templates from the   django.forms.renderers.JinjaTemplates  django.forms.renderers.TemplatesSetting  built-in django forms templates  directory  i.e., the  distribution . Searches and loads widget templates from all  the templates directories inside apps declared in  INSTALLED_APPS. Searches and loads widget templates from the  built-in django forms jinja2  directory  i.e., the  distribution . Searches and loads widget templates from all  the jinja2 directories inside apps declared in  INSTALLED_APPS.  Searches and loads widget templates based on a  project’s TEMPLATES configuration  e.g., its DIRS  values . NOTE: This renderer requires you declare the  django.forms package as part of INSTALLED_APPS.  As you can see in Table 6-4, there’s even a Jinja template renderer to allow you to customize widgets   backed by Jinja templates, in addition to other renderers used in the previous sections.  260   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  In Listing 6-30 you learned how custom widget classes use fields  e.g., template_name, input_type    to specify certain behaviors. Fields in widgets classes are highly dependent on the parent widget class. For  example, although template_name is valid for all built-in widgets, more specialized built-in widgets can  accept additional fields. If in doubt, consult the fields supported for the built-in widget4 used as a widget’s  parent class.  In Listing 6-30 you also learned how to access and modify a widget’s template context through   the get_context   method. Although in Listing 6-30 you only added a couple of widget attributes to  the context['widget']['attrs'] dictionary, the parent context['widget'] dictionary is a large data  structure that stores all data associated with a widget, where you can inclusively update a widget’s field  values. The following snippet illustrates the contents of the context['widget'] for a form field using the  PlaceholderInput widget class from Listing 6-30.  {'widget': {'attrs': {'placeholder': 'Email', 'maxlength': 50}, 'name': 'email', 'is_ hidden': False, 'type': 'text', 'value': None, 'template_name': 'about placeholder.html',  'required': True}}  As you can see, in addition to the HTML input attributes stored under the attrs key, there are other  widget field keys  e.g., name, is_hidden  that are made available in a template to render the final output.  This also means there’s nothing limiting you from adding custom data keys to the context['widget']  dictionary inside the get_context   method to integrate them as part of the final template layout  e.g.,  'react':{ }, 'jquery':{ } .  Django Advanced Form Processing: Partial Forms, AJAX,  and Files  In most cases, Django form processing adheres to the steps and code sequences outlined in the first section  of this chapter, shown in Figure 6-1. However, Django form processing can require small adjustments for  certain scenarios, like those involving partial form processing, AJAX forms, and file uploads.  Partial Forms On occasions you may find yourself with the need to use a partial form based on a preexisting Django form. For  example, you get a request to add a similar form to the ContactForm used up to this point – in Listing 6-25 – but  without requiring the name and email fields. Since the ContactForm is tried and tested, including the necessary  post-processing logic  e.g., adding the form data to a CRM [Customer Relationship Management] system , it’s a  worthwhile idea to reuse the ContactForm class. But how do you go about using a Django form partially?  The first alternative to achieve partial forms is to hide the unneeded form fields from a user, allowing the  original form class to remain intact while not requiring a new subclass. This is the least invasive approach, but  you need to be careful with two aspects. The first aspect is the form template layout, shown in Listing 6-32.  Listing 6-32.  Django form with fields marked as hidden      {% csrf_token %}                       {{ form.comment.label_tag }}           {% if form.comment.help_text %}  4https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref forms widgets built-in-widgets  261   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms             {{ form.comment.help_text }}            {% endif %}           {% for error in form.comment.errors %}                            {{error}}                         {% endfor %}                    {{ form.comment }}                    {{form.name.as_hiddden}}     {{form.email.as_hidden}}      First notice in Listing 6-32 the form fields are output individually and do not use a shortcut method  e.g.,  form.as_table  or loop like some of the previous form layout examples. The reason is, the last form fields are  explicitly output as hidden through the as_hidden method – described earlier in Table 6-4. The as_hidden  method generates a form field as a hidden HTML input  e.g.,   , irrespective of its form  field data type. This mechanism effectively hides fields from end users, but keeps the fields as part of the form.  Why is it important to keep fields as part of the form and not just remove them? Validation. Remember   the form instance hasn’t changed, only the requirements; you may not need the name and email data on  this template page, but the form instance and validation logic doesn’t know that. All of which takes us to the  second aspect you need to take care of: required values.  If you publish the template in Listing 6-32 without taking care of this second aspect, you might be   surprised when you realize the form never passes validation! Why? The underlying ContactForm class treats  the email field as required, therefore it must be given a value, but since the field is now hidden from an end  user, you must take care of giving the email field a value yourself – note the name field doesn’t present this  problem because it’s configured with required=False. Therefore, in order for the template in Listing 6-32 to  work, the form must be initialized with a value like the following snippet:  form = ContactForm initial={'email':'anonymous@gmail.com'}   By initializing the form in this manner, the email form field is given this initial value as a hidden input.   So once a user submits the form, the email value is transferred back to Django as part of the form, where  validation passes since the post-processing logic gets all its expected values. Of course, if a form’s fields are  all optional  i.e., they’re marked with required=False , this initialization process is unnecessary, since the  validation won’t be expecting any value anyway.  A second alternative to achieve partial forms is to create a subclass from a form class and delete the   unneeded fields. This is a little more straightforward approach, but it does require creating a form subclass,  which may be overkill for certain scenarios. Listing 6-33 shows how to subclass a Django form class and  remove some of its parent’s fields.  Listing 6-33.  Django form subclass with removed parent fields  from coffeehouse.about.forms import ContactForm  class ContactCommentOnlyForm ContactForm :     def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :         super ContactCommentOnlyForm, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs          del self.fields['name']         del self.fields['email']  262   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  As you can see in Listing 6-33, the ContactCommentOnlyForm form inherits its behavior from the   ContactForm class. Next, inside the form class __init__ method, a call is made to the parent’s __init__ class  via super   and two calls are made on self.fields using Python’s del to remove both the name and email  fields from this form subclass.  Once you have the form subclass from Listing 6-33, you can generate an unbound instance form in a  view method and pass it to a template for rendering. Since this last subclass removes the name and email  fields, upon validation you won’t face previously described problem of missing values for hidden fields,  since the ContactCommentOnlyForm form now only has a single field.  AJAX Form Submission AJAX is a technique where JavaScript on a web page communicates with a server-side application, re- renders the web page with the result of this communication, all without a web page transition. Django forms  are often designed to submit their data via AJAX to create a smoother workflow  i.e., without changing the  original web page with a web form   The workflow for a form that uses AJAX as far as the initial form delivery is concerned – steps 1 an 2 in   Figure 6-1 – is identical to that of a regular Django non-AJAX form: you create an unbound form instance in a  view method, which is passed to a template for rendering into a web page that’s delivered to an end user.  The first difference in Django forms that submit their data via AJAX, is the web page on which the   unbound form is delivered, must also contain the necessary JavaScript logic to send the form data to the  server-side application and also process the server-side response. Listing 6-34 illustrates this JavaScript logic  using the jQuery library to submit a Django form via AJAX.  Listing 6-34.  JavaScript jQuery logic to submit Django form via AJAX   NOTE: The following is only the Django  HTML  template with AJAX logic  See Listing 6-35 for AJAX processing views.py and urls.py  Feedback              {% csrf_token %}                        {{ form.comment }}                    {{form.name.as_hiddden}}     {{form.email.as_hidden}}        $ document .ready function   {     $ "feedbackform" .submit function event  {        event.preventDefault  ;        $.ajax { data: $ this .serialize  ,                 type: $ this .attr 'method' ,                 url: $ this .attr 'action' ,                 success: function response  {  263   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms                       console.log response ;                      if response['success']  {                           $ "feedbackmessage" .html "    Succesfully sent feedback, thank you! " ;                           $ "feedbackform" .addClass "hidden" ;                      }                      if response['error']  {                           $ "feedbackmessage" .html " " +   response['error']['comment'] +" " ;                       }                 },                 error: function  request, status, error  {                      console.log request.responseText ;                 }        } ;    } ; }     The first part of Listing 6-34 is a standard Django form layout. However, notice the   tag includes   the action attribute. In previous Django forms, the action attribute was not used because the serving  url – GET request – and processing url – POST request – was the same one. In Listing 6-34, the action  attribute explicitly tells the browser the url where it should send the POST request – in this case {% url  'stores:feedback' %} is a Django template tag that gets translated into a url  e.g.,  stores feedback  . Different urls are necessary in this case, because Django view methods that handle AJAX requests responses  are different from Django view methods that handle standard web requests responses.  Now let’s turn our attention to the bottom half of Listing 6-34 and the JavaScript logic enclosed in     tags. In brief – as it would go beyond the scope of our discussion to describe jQuery syntax – the  web page awaits a click on the feedbackform form’s submit button. Once this click is detected, an AJAX  POST request using the form’s data is sent to the url defined in the form’s action attribute. Upon completion  of the AJAX request  i.e., when the server side sends a response back , the response – in JSON format – is  analyzed. If the AJAX response contains a success message, the message is output at the top of the form  and the form is hidden to avoid multiple submissions. If the AJAX response contains an error message, the  message is output at the top of the form.  Now that you know how Django form data is submitted to the server side via AJAX, Listing 6-35   illustrates the Django view method necessary to handle this AJAX request payload.  Listing 6-35.  Django view method to process Django form via AJAX   urls.py  Main  urlpatterns = [     url r'^stores ',include 'coffeehouse.stores.urls',namespace="stores"   ]   urls.py  App stores  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',views.index,name="index" ,     url r'^feedback $',views.feedback,name="feedback" , ]   views.py  App stores  from django.http import HttpResponse, JsonResponse from coffeehouse.about.forms import ContactForm 264   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  def feedback request :     if request.POST:         form = ContactForm request.POST          if form.is_valid  :             return JsonResponse {'success':True}          else:             return JsonResponse {'error':form.errors}      return HttpResponse "Hello from feedback!"   The first important point about the view method in Listing 6-35 is that it only handles POST requests.  Notice that in case the if request.POST: statement isn’t true, the view method always responds with the  Hello from feedback! string.  Next, inside the request.POST segment, the process starts out pretty similar to a standard Django form   processing sequence  i.e., a bound form instance is created and a call is made to the form’s is_valid    method to validate the user-provided data . However, notice the responses for both valid and invalid form  data use JsonResponse  . Since the AJAX form submission operates in a JavaScript context, the JSON format  response is a common format to use to send a response back to the browser.  If you turn your attention back to Listing 6-34, you can see the JavaScript logic is designed to handle and   output either JSON response  success or error  returned by the view method in Listing 6-35.  Files in Forms Django offers a couple of form fields to capture files through forms – forms.ImageField   and forms. ImageField   described in Table 6-2. However, although these form fields generate the necessary HTML  and validation logic to enforce files are submitted via forms, there are a couple of subtleties related to  processing files in forms.  The first issue is the HTML   tag for forms that transfer files must explicitly set the encoding type  to enctype="multipart form-data", in addition to using method=POST. The second issue is the contents of  files are placed in the Django request object under the special FILES dictionary key. Listing 6-36 illustrates a  form with file fields, its corresponding view method, and its template layout.  Listing 6-36.  Django form with file fields, corresponding view method, and template layout   forms.py from django import forms  class SharingForm forms.Form :      NOTE: forms.PhotoField requires Python PIL & other operating system libraries,            so generic FileField is used instead     video = forms.FileField       photo = forms.FileField widget=forms.ClearableFileInput attrs={'multiple': True}     views.py def index request :     if request.method == 'POST':          POST, generate form with data from the request         form = SharingForm request.POST,request.FILES           check if it's valid:         if form.is_valid  :              Process file data in request.FILES              Process data, insert into DB, generate email,etc  265   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms               redirect to a new URL:             return HttpResponseRedirect ' about contact thankyou'      else:          GET, generate blank form         form = SharingForm       return render request,'social index.html',{'form':form}    social index.html     {% csrf_token %}         {{form.as_ul}}              Notice how the HTML   tag declares the required attributes and in addition notice how the  request.FILES reference is used to create a bound form – along with the standard request.POST. The  remaining form structures in Listing 6-36 are identical to regular non-file forms  e.g., unbound form  creation, call to is_valid   .  But similar to regular Django form processing, once a form is valid – if is_valid   returns True – you’ll  want do something with the contents of the form data; therefore in this case, you’ll need to access request. FILES to do something with the files uploaded by a user.  But before describing how to process the contents of files in request.FILES it’s important you   understand the possible contents of the request.FILES dictionary:  Option 1  request.FILES =  {'photo': [ , ],   Option 2  request.FILES =  {'photo': [ ],'video':   'video': [ ]}  [ ]}  The request.FILES dictionary contains keys corresponding to file field names. In this case, you can see   the photo and video keys correspond to the form fields names declared in Listing 6-36 that represent files.  Next, notice the value for each key is a list, irrespective if the file form field can accept multiple files – like photo  due to the overridden widget with the 'multiple': True attribute – or a single file – in the case of video.  Now let’s analyze the contents of the lists assigned to each file form field key. Each of the list elements  represents an uploaded file. But notice how the files are represented by either the InMemoryUploadedFile  or TemporaryUploadedFile class – both of which are subclasses of the django.core.files.uploadedfile. UploadedFile class. The reason uploaded files are represented by either an InMemoryUploadedFile or  TemporaryUploadedFile instance class, is dependent on the size of an uploaded file.  As it turns out, before you even decide how to handle uploaded files, Django must decide what to   do and where to place uploaded files. To do this, Django relies on upload handlers. By default and unless  explicitly overridden in the FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS variable in settings.py,Django uses the following two  file upload handlers:  FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS= [     'django.core.files.uploadhandler.MemoryFileUploadHandler',     'django.core.files.uploadhandler.TemporaryFileUploadHandler', ]  By default, if a file is less than 2.5 MB, Django uses MemoryFileUploadHandler to place the contents of  an uploaded file into memory; if a file is larger than 2.5 MB, Django uses TemporaryFileUploadHandler to  place the contents of an uploaded file in a temporary file  e.g.,  tmp Af534.upload .  266   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  You can define FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS in settings.py to only include the file upload handler you  desire  e.g., if you wish to save memory resources remove MemoryFileUploadHandler . However, note a  file upload handler must always be active in order for file uploads to work. If you don’t like the behavior of  Django’s built-in file upload handlers, then you’ll need to write your own file upload handler.5  In addition to defining FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS in settings.py, there are two other parameters you can   declare in settings.py to influence the behavior of file upload handlers. The FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_ SIZE variable sets the threshold size at which files are held in memory vs. handled as temporary files,  defaulting to 2621440 bytes  or 2.5 MB . And the FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR variable sets the directory to which  temporary uploaded files must be saved, defaulting to None, meaning an operating system’s temporary file  directory is used  e.g., on Linux OS  tmp  .  Now that you know where and how Django stores uploaded files even before you decide how to handle  them, let’s take a look at how to process the contents of request.FILES. Listing 6-37 shows the continuation  of Listing 6-36 with the relevant snippets necessary to process uploaded files.  Listing 6-37.  Django form file processing with save procedure to MEDIA_ROOT   views.py from django.conf import settings  def save_uploaded_file_to_media_root f :     with open '%s%s' %  settings.MEDIA_ROOT,f.name , 'wb+'  as destination:         for chunk in f.chunks  :             destination.write chunk   def index request :     if request.method == 'POST':          POST, generate form with data from the request         form = SharingForm request.POST,request.FILES           check if it's valid:         if form.is_valid  :             for field in request.FILES.keys  :                 for formfile in request.FILES.getlist field :                     save_uploaded_file_to_media_root formfile              return HttpResponseRedirect ' about contact thankyou'      else:          GET, generate blank form         form = SharingForm       return render request,'social index.html',{'form':form}   After the form is_valid   method, you know each of the keys in the request.FILES dictionary are file   form fields, so a loop is created to get each file field  i.e., video, photo . Next, using the getlist   method  of the request.FILES dictionary, you obtain the list of file instances  i.e., InMemoryUploadedFile,Temporar yUploadedFile  for each file field and loop over each element to get file instances. Finally, you execute the  save_uploaded_file_to_media_root   method on each file instance.  Each file instance – represented as the formfile reference in Listing 6-37 – is either a InMemoryUploadedFile   or TemporaryUploadedFile instance type. But as I mentioned earlier, these classes are derived from the parent  class django.core.files.uploadedfile.UploadedFile, which means file instances are also UploadedFile  instances.  5https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref files uploads custom-upload-handlers  267   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  By design, the Django django.core.files.uploadedfile.UploadedFile class has a series of methods   and fields, specifically made to easily handle the contents of uploaded files, some of which include the  following:   .name.- Outputs the name of the file, as was on a user’s computer.   	  	   	   .size.- Outputs the size of the file, in bytes.   .content_type.- Outputs the HTTP Content-Type header assigned  to the file  e.g., text html, application zip .   .chunks  .- A generator method to efficiently output contents of a  file in chunks.  With the use of these UploadedFile fields and methods, you can see toward the top of Listing 6-37 the   save_uploaded_file_to_media_root   method logic includes saving the uploaded file with its original  name – using Python’s standard with...open syntax – and then using the chunks   method to efficiently  write all the pieces of the uploaded file to the file system.   The uploaded files in Listing 6-37 are saved under the settings.meDIa_rooT folder. although you      Note  can save files to any location you want, the standard practice for user uploaded files in Django is to save them  under the meDIa_rooT folder defined in settings.py.  Django Formsets  Because Django forms represent the primary means by which users introduce data into Django projects,  it’s not uncommon for Django forms to be used as a data-capturing mechanism. This, however, can lead to  an efficiency problem, relying on one Django form per web page. Django formsets allow you to integrate  multiple forms of the same type into a template – with all the necessary validation and layout facilities – to  simplify data capturing by means of multiple forms.  The good news is that all you’ve learned about Django forms up to this point – form fields, validation   workflow, template layouts, widgets, and all the other topics – applies equally to Django formsets. This  means the learning curve for formsets is rather simple, albeit you will have to learn some new concepts.  Formset initialization.- Although formsets are initialized as a group of regular Django forms, formset   initialization requires parameters specific to formsets.   	  Formset management form.- To keep track of multiple Django forms on the same  page, formsets also use a special form called a ‘management form’.  Let’s assume you’re in the process of adding online ordering capabilities to your coffehouse application.  You already have a drink form so users can place an order for a drink, but want to add the ability for users to  order multiple drinks, so you need multiple drink forms on the same page or a drink formset.  Listing 6-38 illustrates the stand-alone DrinkForm class, the corresponding view method that generates   an empty formset, and the template layout used to display the formset.  Listing 6-38.  Django formset factory initialization and template layout   forms.py from django import forms  DRINKS =   None,'Please select a drink type' , 1,'Mocha' , 2,'Espresso' , 3,'Latte'   SIZES =   None,'Please select a drink size' , 's','Small' , 'm','Medium' , 'l','Large'    268   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  class DrinkForm forms.Form :     name = forms.ChoiceField choices=DRINKS,initial=0      size = forms.ChoiceField choices=SIZES,initial=0       amount = forms.ChoiceField choices=[ None,'Amount of drinks' ]+[ i, i  for i in   range 1,10 ]    views.py from django.forms import formset_factory  def index request :     DrinkFormSet = formset_factory DrinkForm, extra=2, max_num=20      if request.method == 'POST':          TODO     else:         formset = DrinkFormSet initial=[{'name': 1,'size': 'm','amount':1}]      return render request,'online index.html',{'formset':formset}    online index.html             {% csrf_token %}     {{ formset.management_form }}               {% for form in formset %}            {{ form.as_ul }}            {% endfor %}                The DrinkForm class in Listing 6-38 uses standard Django form syntax, so there’s nothing new there.   However, the index view method starts by using the django.forms.formset_factory method. The formset_ factory is used to generate a FormSet class from a given form class. In this case, notice the formset_factory  uses the DrinkForm argument – representing the form class – to generate a DrinkForm formset. I’ll provide  details about the additional formset_factory arguments shortly.  Next, in Listing 6-38 you can see an unbound DrinkFormSet   instance is created with an initial value   – similar to how stand-alone unbound forms are created and use the initial argument. However, notice  the initial value is a list, unlike a stand-alone dictionary used in standard forms. Because a formset is a  group of forms, a formset’s initial value is a group of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents the  initial values for each form. In the case of Listing 6-38, one of the formset’s forms is set to initialize with the  {'name': 1,'size': 'm','amount':1} values.  Toward the bottom of Listing 6-38 you can see the template for the formset. The first difference   between a stand-alone form template, is the {{ formset.management_form }} statement to output the  management form. The second difference is the loop over the formset reference outputs the various forms.  In this case, each formset form is output in its entirety with {{form.as_ul}} as a inline form, but you can  equally use any Django form template layout technique to output each form instance in a custom manner   e.g., remove field id values .  269   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  Formset Factory The formset_factory   method used in Listing 6-38 is one of the centerpieces to working with formsets.  Although the example in Listing 6-38 only uses three arguments, the formset_factory   method can accept  up to nine arguments. The following snippet illustrates the names and default values for each argument in  the formset_factory   method.  formset_factory form, formset=BaseFormSet, extra=1, can_order=False, can_delete=False,                   max_num=None, min_num=None, validate_max=False, validate_min=False   As you can confirm in this snippet, the only required argument  i.e., that doesn’t have a default value    for the formset_factory   method is form. The meaning for each argument is the following:  form.- Defines the form class on which to create a formset. formset.- Defines the formset base class, defaults to django.forms.formsets.BaseFormSet. Changes   when you require a custom formset for cases like custom formset validation.  extra.- Defines the amount of empty forms added to a formset. If a formset’s forms are all empty     i.e., they’re not initialized  a formset contains an extra number of forms. If a formset’s forms contain data   i.e., they’re initialized  a formset contains the number of initialized forms + extra  empty forms .  can_order.- Adds the ORDER field  as a forms.IntegerField  to every form in a formset, with the   purpose to alter the form order in a formset. Defaults to False.  can_delete.- Adds the DELETE field  as a forms.BooleanField  to every form in a formset, with the   purpose to mark a form in a formset for deletion. Defaults to False.  max_num.- Defines the maximum number of forms to display in a formset. Defaults to None, to indicate   up to 1000 forms instances be displayed.  minimum 0 form instances be displayed.  min_num.- Defines the minimum number of forms to display in a formset. Defaults to None, to indicate a   validate_max.- Used in conjunction with max_num to ensure validation is enforced and the form   instances never exceed max_num. Defaults to False.  validate_min.- Used in conjunction with min_num to ensure validation is enforced and the form   instances are never less than min_num. Defaults to False.  Now that you’re aware of the various formset_factory   method options, let’s turn out attention back   to the method used in Listing 6-38:  formset_factory DrinkForm, extra=2, max_num=20   This formset_factory method creates a formset with the DrinkForm class; the extra=2 indicates to   always include 2 empty DrinkForm instances; this means that because the formset was initialized with one  DrinkForm instance in Listing 6-38, the total number of forms in the formset will be one, plus two empty  forms on account of extra=2; the max_num=20 argument indicates the formset should contain a maximum  20 DrinkForm instances.  Formset Management Form and Formset Processing To understand the purpose of a formset’s management form, it’s easiest to look at what this form contains.  Listing 6-39 illustrates the contents of the formset management form based on the example from Listing 6-38.  Listing 6-39.  Django formset management form contents and fields           270   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  As you can see in Listing 6-39, the contents of a formset management form  i.e., the {{formset.  management_form}} statement from Listing 6-38  are four hidden input variables. The form-TOTAL_FORMS  field indicates the total amount of forms in a formset; the form-INITIAL_FORMS fields indicates the total  amount of initialized forms in a formset; the form-MIN_NUM_FORMS field indicates the minimum number  of forms in a formset; and the form-MAX_NUM_FORMS field indicates the maximum number of forms in the  formset.  At first glance the variables in Listing 6-39 can appear unimportant, but they provide an important role   in formsets once the various forms in a formset enter the processing and rendering phase. To better illustrate  the relevance of these formset management fields, let’s modify the formset in Listing 6-38 to allow users to  add more drink forms so they can grow their order as needed.  Listing 6-40.  Django formset designed to add extra forms by user  views.py def index request :     extra_forms = 2     DrinkFormSet = formset_factory DrinkForm, extra=extra_forms, max_num=20      if request.method == 'POST':         if 'additems' in request.POST and request.POST['additems'] == 'true':             formset_dictionary_copy = request.POST.copy                formset_dictionary_copy['form-TOTAL_FORMS'] = int formset_dictionary_copy   ['form-TOTAL_FORMS']  + extra_forms              formset = DrinkFormSet formset_dictionary_copy          else:             formset = DrinkFormSet request.POST              if formset.is_valid  :                 return HttpResponseRedirect ' about contact thankyou'      else:         formset = DrinkFormSet initial=[{'name': 1,'size': 'm','amount':1}]      return render request,'online index.html',{'formset':formset}    online index.html             {% csrf_token %}     {{ formset.management_form }}               {% for form in formset %}           {{ form }}           {% endfor %}                  Add items to order             $ document .ready function   {         $ "additemsbutton" .on 'click',function event  {          $ "additems" .val "true" ;        } ; } ;    271   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  The first important modification in Listing 6-40 comes in the formset template. Notice how the form  declares a hidden input field named additems set to false, as well as a button that when clicked changes  the value of this hidden input field to true. This mechanism is a simple control variable to keep track when a  user wants to add more items to an order  i.e., add more drink forms to the formset .  Now let’s turn to the view method in Listing 6-40 that processes the formset. First, notice the formset   uses the extra_forms variable set to two to define a formset’s extra value, so the initial formset factory  contain two extra forms, just like in Listing 6-38.  Next comes the request.POST processing formset section that has two possible outcomes. If request.  POST contains the additems field and it’s set to true, it indicates a user clicked on the button to add more  forms to the formset. If request.POST does not contain the additems field or it’s set to false, it indicates the  user clicked on the standard submit button, so a bound formset set is created and a call to is_valid   is  made on the formset. Now, let’s break down the logic behind each possible outcome.  When a user adds more forms to the formset, a copy of the request.POST is made – the copy   method  is necessary because request.POST is immutable. Next, the formset’s management form field form-TOTAL_ FORMS is modified to reflect additional forms by adding the extra_forms variables. Finally, the DrinkFormSet  is re-bound with this new modified request.POST dictionary – with an altered form-TOTAL_FORMS. When  the re-bound formset is sent back to a user, the formset will now contain two additional empty forms due to  simply modifying the form-TOTAL_FORMS management formset field.  If the formset falls to the standard POST processing and validation section in Listing 6-40, here is what   happens. First, a bound formset is created using request.POST – just like it’s done with regular bound  forms – next, the is_valid   method is called on the formset – also just like it’s done in regular bound  forms. If is_valid   returns true  i.e., there are no errors in the formset or individual forms  a redirect  is made to the success page. If is_valid   returns false  i.e., there are errors in the formset or individual  forms  an errors dictionary is attached to the formset reference and control falls to the last line – return  render request,'online index.html',{'formset':formset}  – which sends the formset instance with  errors for display on the template – a process that again is almost identical to standard form validation and  error management.  As you can see, with this minor modification to one of the fields in a Django formset’s management  form, it’s possible to dynamically alter the amount of forms in a formset. Note that in most cases, it isn’t  necessary to manipulate a formset’s management form fields directly, more often Django uses these values  behind the scenes to keep track of processing and rendering tasks. Albeit once you create more advanced  formset behavior  e.g., ordering forms, deleting forms , the remaining management formsets fields take on  an equally important role and may need to be manipulated directly.  Formset Custom Validation and Formset Errors All the forms in a formset are validated against the form validation rules explained in the previous section  e.g.,  validators, clean_    methods . However, sometimes it can be necessary enforce inter-form rules in a  formset, in which case you’ll need to build a custom formset class like the one illustrated in Listing 6-41.  Listing 6-41.  Django custom formset with custom validation  from django.forms import BaseFormSet  class BaseDrinkFormSet BaseFormSet :     def clean self :           Check errors dictionary first, if there are any error, no point in validating   further          if any self.errors :             return         name_size_tuples = []  272   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms          for form in self.forms:             name_size =  form.cleaned_data['name'],form.cleaned_data['size']              if name_size in name_size_tuples:                  raise forms.ValidationError "Ups! You have multiple %s %s items in your   order, keep one and increase the amount" %  dict SIZES   [name_size[1]],dict DRINKS [int name_size[0] ]                name_size_tuples.append name_size   First, notice the class in Listing 6-41 inherits its behavior from the django.forms.BaseFormSet class,  giving it all the basic functionalities of a Django formset. Next, the custom formset class defines a clean    method, which serves the same purpose of the clean   method in a standard Django forms: to enforce  validation rules on the whole  i.e., formset  and not its individual parts  i.e., forms . The validation logic  inside the clean   method enforces that if two forms from the formset have the same name and size, an  error is raised.  Notice in Listing 6-41 how the validation error creation also uses the same forms.ValidationError    class used in standard forms. In the event the clean   method raises a validation error, the error is assigned  to a special field called non_form_errors in a formset’s errors dictionary. Listing 6-42 shows an updated  version of the formset template in Listing 6-38 illustrating how to out a formset’s non-form errors.  Listing 6-42.  Django custom formset to display non_form_errors              {% csrf_token %}     {{ formset.management_form }}     {% if formset.non_form_errors %}        {{formset.non_form_errors}}      {% endif %}      {{ formset.management_form }}               {% for form in formset %}            {{ form.as_ul }}            {% endfor %}          You can see below the {{formset.management_form}} statement in Listing 6-42 a conditional loop is   made to output any errors placed in the non_forms_errors key of the formset’s errors dictionary. Although  different in name, the purpose of the formset.non_form_errors is the same as the form.non_field_errors  for regular Django forms, to display errors not associated with a specific part. Because formsets use form  constructs the error variable is called non_forms_errors and because forms use field constructs the variable  is called non_field_errors.  Note that if any errors are present in a formset’s forms, they are placed in a form’s error dictionary just  like they are in regular forms, so you can use the techniques outlined in Listing 6-28 to customize the output  of individual form errors in a formset.  273   ChaPTer 6   Django Forms  DJANGO FORM TOOLS AND DJANGO CRISPY FORMS  In addition to the Django built-in form functionalities you’ve learned in this chapter, there are a couple  of third-party Django apps worth mentioning that are designed to solve more advanced Django form  problems.  The Django form tools package6 supports the creation of form review processes and form wizards.   a form review process forces a preview after a Django form’s data has been validated, a procedure  that’s helpful when you want end users to double-check their form data before the form life cycle ends   e.g., reservation or purchase order . a form wizard consists of grouping forms in different pages as  part of a sequence  e.g., signup or questionnaire . The benefit of the Django form tools package is it  implements all the ‘lower level’ logic needed to support these types of Django form workflows.  Django crispy forms7 is another third-party Django app focused on advanced form layouts. Django crispy  forms is a popular choice for Django forms integrated with the Bootstrap library and forms requiring  sophisticated widget and template layouts  e.g., inline and horizontal forms .  6https:  django-formtools.readthedocs.io  7http:  django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io   274   CHAPTER 7  Django Models  The typical way for Django applications to interact with data is through Django models. A Django model is  an object-oriented Python class that represents the characteristics of an entity. For example, an entity can be  a person, a company, a product, or some other concept used by an application.  Because data is at the center of modern applications and the Django framework enforces the DRY    Don’t Repeat Yourself  principle, Django models often serve as the building blocks for Django projects.  Once you have a set of Django models representing an application’s entities, Django models can also serve  as the basis to simplify the creation of other Django constructs that operate with data  e.g., forms, class- based views, REST services, Django admin pages , hence the importance of Django models as a whole.  In this chapter you’ll learn about the core behaviors of Django models, including how to create models  and how to use migrations, which are central to working effectively with models. Next, you’ll learn about the  default behaviors of Django models and how to override them with custom behaviors. In addition, you’ll  learn about the different data types available to create Django models, the different relationships available  for Django models, and how to manage database transactions with Django models.  Next, you’ll learn more about migration files, including the various ways to create migration files, how  to rename migration files, how to squash multiple migration files into a single migration file, the meaning  behind each migration file element so you can edit migration files with confidence, and the procedure to roll  back migration files.  In addition, you’ll learn about the various Django tools designed to ease the work between Django  models and databases, such backing up and loading model data with fixture files, including how to load  initial data into Django models. Next, you’ll learn about Django signals that support the software observer  pattern in Django models. Finally, you’ll finish the chapter learning how to declare Django models outside   of their default location, as well as how to configure multiple databases and use them with Django models.  This chapter assumes you've already set up a database for a Django project. If you haven't set up a   database, see Chapter 1 on setting up a database for a Django project.  Django Models and the Migrations Workflow  Django’s primary storage technology is relational  i.e., out of the box it can connect to SQLite, Postgres,  MySQL, or Oracle , so a Django model is designed to map directly to a relational database table. This means  instances of a Django model are stored as rows of a relational table named after the model.  For example, for a Django model class named Store, by default Django performs database CRUD    Create, Read, Update, and Delete  operations on a database table called  _store, where each of  the model’s Store instances represent database rows and a model’s fields  e.g., name, address, city, state   map to database table columns.    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_7  275   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Because Django models revolve around data, they are prone to change. For example, a Django model   named Store can suddenly require the modification of its original fields due to business requirements   e.g., the addition of a new field like email or the removal of a field that’s no longer needed like telephone .  Maintaining these Django models changes throughout time is also an important aspect of Django models  and is managed through the use migration files.  Create Django Models Django models are stored in models.py files located inside Django apps. As soon as you create a Django app,  an empty models.py file is added to the app for future use. If you’re unfamiliar with the term Django app, see  the Chapter 1 section on setting up content. Listing 7-1 illustrates a sample Django model definition.   remember the book’s code is at https:  github.com drubio beginningdjango, if you find it easier      Tip  to follow along with a pre-typed and structured application.  Listing 7-1.  Django model class definition in models.py  from __future__ import unicode_literals from django.utils.encoding import python_2_unicode_compatible  from django.db import models  @python_2_unicode_compatible class Store models.Model :     id = models.AutoField primary_key=True  Added by default, not required explicitly     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      objects = models.Manager   Added by default, to required explicitly     def __str__ self :         return "%s  %s,%s " %  self.name, self.city, self.state   The first two lines in Listing 7-1 import the functionality required to run Python classes in Django using   both Python 2 and Python 3. If your Django project will just run on Python 3, you can omit these import  statements. The third line in Listing 7-1 imports the django.db.models package, which is necessary to  access Django model functionality in the class definition. Next, you can see the class Store models.Model   statement. The @python_2_unicode_compatible annotation is required to run the class on Python 2, but if  you just use Python 3 you can omit this annotation.  After the main class definition in Listing 7-1, you can see four fields with the models.CharField data   type that qualify the fields as character strings. Further restricting the acceptable values for each field is the  max_length argument for models.CharField  e.g., max_length=30 indicates the maximum length for the  character field is 30 characters .  For the moment, don’t worry about the models.CharField field definitions. There are many other data   types and arguments supported by Django’s models package, I’ll describe all of these options in the next  section on Django model data types.  In addition, notice the Django model in Listing 7-1 has the id and objects fields. In this case, I   commented them out with  because you don’t need to explicitly declare them; both are automatically  added to all Django models, but I put them there so you know they exist.  276   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  The id field is a Django AutoField data type, which behind the scenes creates an integer table column   that increments automatically. For example, when you create the first Store record, the id field is set to 1  by the database, for the second Store record the database sets the id field to 2, and so on. The intent of the  id field is to make record searches easier and more efficient. Because the id represents a unique number to  identify a record, it’s used as a reference, which is also used as a database table’s primary key and as an index  to speed up record access. While you can override various behaviors of this default id field  e.g., change the  field name , I’ll leave the details of this for a later section.  The objects field is Django model’s default model manager, charged with managing all the query  operations associated with a Django model. Future sections in this chapter and the following chapter  describe the use of Django model managers.   If you want to know more about the id field added by default to all Django models, table 7-1 describes      Tip  the autoField data type, which is the basis for the id field; the section “Django Model Data types” later in  this chapter describes the purpose of the primary_key attribute used by the id field; and the save   method  described in the “Model Methods” section later in this chapter describes the practical aspects of the id field.  Finally, in Listing 7-1 you can see the class method definition for __str__ that is a standard Python   method - part of what are called ‘magic methods’ - that are helpful when attempting to view or print instances  of Django models. The __str__ method defines a human readable representation of a class instance    e.g., a Store model instance based on Listing 7-1 is output by its name, city, and state field values .  Django model definitions even when placed in an app’s models.py file still aren’t discoverable by   Django. In order for Django to discover model definitions in models.py files, it’s necessary to declare apps as  part of the INSTALLED_APPS variable in settings.py. Listing 7-2 illustrates an INSTALLED_APPS definition to  discover Django models in the coffeehouse.stores app.  Listing 7-2.  Add app to INSTALLED_APPS in Django settings.py to detect models.py definitions  INSTALLED_APPS =       'django.contrib.admin',     'django.contrib.auth',     'django.contrib.contenttypes',     'django.contrib.sessions',     'django.contrib.messages',     'django.contrib.staticfiles',     'coffeehouse.stores',    As you can see in Listing 7-2, in addition to the default apps declared in INSTALLED_APPS the   coffeehouse.stores app is added at the end. This tells Django to inspect the models.py file in the  coffeehouse.stores app to take into account any Django model definitions in it.  After the previous steps, an app’s Django model definitions in models.py are ready for use. In the next  section, I’ll describe Django model migrations and the workflow associated with models in models.py files.  Migrations and the Django Model Workflow Let’s start with an illustration of how the Django models workflow operates with migrations thrown into the  mix. Figure 7-1 shows the Django models workflow with migrations.  277   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Figure 7-1.  Django workflow for models with migrations  Illustrated on the top-left side of Figure 7-1, the workflow starts when you add or modify Django models   on a models.py file. Once you deem the changes made to a models.py file are considerable or want them  reflected on a database, you need to create a migration file. Migration files provide a step-by-step snapshot of  the changes made to a models.py file, whether you add, remove, or modify content from the models.py file.  In order to create migration files you use the makemigrations management command. When you  run this command, Django scans the models.py files for all Django apps declared in INSTALLED_APPS,  and if Django detects a change to a models.py file, it creates a new migration file for the app. This process   278   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  functions like a version control system, where migration files reflect changes made to models.py from a prior  a migration file, and the entire series of migration files tells the whole evolution of an app’s models.py file. As you can see in Figure 7-1, migration files are stored in a  migrations  subdirectory inside an app,   alongside the models.py file they track. And by default, migration files use the naming convention <number_ shortdescription> so it’s easy to track in what order they were created and what it is they contain. Next, let’s run makemigrations on the Django model you created in the last section. Listing 7-3   illustrates this sequence and adds the stores argument to limit the migration process to the stores app - if  you run makemigrations without any argument, Django inspects the models.py for every app in defined in  the INSTALLED_APPS variable in settings.py.  Listing 7-3.  Django makemigrations command to create migration file for changes made to models.py  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py makemigrations stores Migrations for 'stores':   0001_initial.py:     - Create model Store  After running makemigrations stores in Listing 7-3, you can see the migration file 0001_initial.py.  The file is given this name because it’s the first migration parting from an empty models.py. Future changes  to the models.py generate migration files named 0002.,0003...  Turning our attention back the workflow in Figure 7-1, migration files by themselves are just a first step   in the Django models workflow. Next, you can either preview or apply these migration files so the models  become part of a database.  To preview the actual SQL statements for a migration before they’re applied to a database, you run the  sqlmigrate     command. Listing 7-4 illustrates the sqlmigrate sequence for  the migration file from the last step.  Listing 7-4.  Django sqlmigrate command to preview SQL generated by migration file  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py sqlmigrate stores 0001 BEGIN; CREATE TABLE "stores_store"  "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "name"  varchar 30  NOT NULL, "address" varchar 30  NOT NULL, "city" varchar 30  NOT NULL, "state"  varchar 2  NOT NULL ;  COMMIT;  As you can see in Listing 7-4, the migration file 0001_initial.py for the stores app is set to run an   SQL statement that creates a database table named stores_store with field names that correspond to the  Django model from Listing 7-1.   You can change a Django model’s default database table name with the db_table Meta class option;      Tip  the ‘Model Meta Class’ section describes this in detail.  Previewing the SQL statements generated by a migration file might not seem too exciting at this stage,   but it can be very helpful in other circumstances. For example, if you make complex changes to a Django  model or your database is relatively large, it’s beneficial to preview the SQL before applying the migration file  directly to a database.  Finally, the last step in the workflow for Django models is to apply the migration files to a database   with the migrate command. Listing 7-5 illustrates this sequence and adds the stores argument to limit the  process to the stores app - if you run migrate without any argument, Django processes the migration files for  every app in a project.  279   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Listing 7-5.  Django migrate command to execute migration files on database  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py migrate stores Operations to perform:   Apply all migrations: stores Running migrations:   Applying stores.0001_initial... OK  In Listing 7-5 the stores.0001_initial migration is run against the database. This means the SQL   presented in Listing 7-4 is executed against the database.     Caution  migrations, as this can lead to inconsistencies and errors.   Be careful manipulating the database directly without applying the same changes via Django    If you don’t want a Django model to use migrations, you can use the managed Meta class option; see      Tip  the “Django Meta Class” section for details.  To keep track of applied migrations, on the bottom-left side of Figure 7-1 you can see the use of   the showmigrations management command. The showmigrations command outputs a list of project  migrations, with an X besides those migration files that have been applied to a database. It’s worth  mentioning the showmigrations command obtains its data by inspecting migration files in migration  folders and the django_migrations database table that keeps track of applied migrations.  Django Model Data Types  Data needs to conform to certain rules for it to be useful in any application. If it weren’t for rules, then you  can easily end up with ZIP code numbers where you expect address information or extensive text where you  expect a maximum 10-character input. Django models can use several data types to enforce model data fit  certain rules  e.g., text, number, email .  It’s important to understand Django model data types operate on two layers: at the database layer  and the Django Python layer. When you define a Django model with its data types and create its initial  migration, Django generates and executes a model’s DDL  Data definition language  to create a database  table, and this DDL contains rules that reflect a Django model’s fields  e.g., a Django IntegerField model  field gets translated into an INTEGER DB column to enforce integer values . This means that if you change  this type of Django model field  e.g., changing an integer field to a text field , it requires generating a new  migration in order for the database table to also reflect any new rule.  In addition to this rule enforcement created at the outset by a Django model at the database layer,   Django model fields also enforce data rules at the Django Python layer  i.e., prior to inserting updating data  in the database . For example, Django model field parameters like choices enforce a field’s values conform  to a set of choices; this type of rule is enforced when you attempt to create, save, or update Django model  records and is done irrespective of the database table rules. This means you can simply change a Django  model field associated with this type of rule and not have to create a new migration to alter the underlying  database table – in this case, changing the Python code is enough to change validation behavior.  Always keep this subtly in mind for Django model field data types: some Django model changes require   creating a migration, while others can simply take effect changing the Django model field code. Table 7-1  illustrates the various Django model fields and the DDL they produce for all of the four main relational  database supported by Django: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.  280   Chapter 7   Django MoDels    d e u n i t n o c      , s t n e m e r c n i o t u a   t a h t       s e t a e r c o s l a & L L U N          r e g e t n  i    n a   s e t a e r C     T O N      1 1   R E B M U N    r o f   d e s u y l i r a m     i r p        d n a E C N E U Q E S a        . s y e k y r a m     i r p m o t s u c     e s a e r c n  i   o t   R E G G I R T  d l e i f   e h t  L L U N     n o i t a d  i l a V    -

I’ll provide some Django-specific details related to working with nUll, not nUll, and empty string ‘’  issues in the next section.  As you can see in Table 7-1, Django model fields produce slightly different DDL depending on the  database brand, albeit the end behavior for all back ends maps as close as possible to one another, with  Django Python rule enforcement filling in the gaps.  For example, for a Django model field like models.DurationField  , SQLite and MySQL use the bigint  data type, whereas PostgreSQL and Oracle use the more specialized interval data type. Similarly for Django  model fields like models.CommaSeparatedIntegerField   and models.EmailField  , at the database level  these are represented as basic character varchar data types - or NVARCHAR2 in Oracle - and it’s Django  Python that enforces that the text representation is a valid CSV of integers or email, respectively.  With knowledge of the initial DDL generated by each Django model field, in the next sections I’ll   present the various Django model field options and their behavior associated with the original DDL and  Django Python validation.  Limiting Values: max_length, min_value, max_value, max_digits, and  decimal_places Limiting values to a certain range is one of the most basic options in Django model fields. For text-based  data types the max_length option enforces values don’t surpass a certain number of characters. In Table 7-1  you can see the CharField data type requires you specify the max_length option and for more specialized  text-based data types  e.g., EmailField  Django assigns a default max_length option value, which you can  override with an explicit max_length value.  For fields that use the IntegerField data type, Django offers the min_value and max_value options to  restrict a value to lower upper bounds  e.g., IntegerField min_value=0,max_value=1000  limits values to  a 0 to 1000 range . Similarly, for fields with the DecimalField data type, Django requires you specify the max_ digits and decimal_places options to enforce a value’s maximum number of digits and decimal points,  respectively.  287   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Empty, Null and Not Null Values: Blank and Null By default, all Django model fields are assigned a NOT NULL restriction at the database level; if you look at  Table 7-1 again you can confirm this by the generated DDL - the only exception is for certain fields on Oracle  databases, which is explained in the sidebar below Table 7-1.  This means that when you create update a record with a NOT NULL field on it, a value must be provided for   the field or otherwise the database rejects the operation. On certain occasions though, it can be necessary to allow  empty field values or as they’re known in the database world NULL values. To allow Django model fields to support  NULL values at the database level, you must declare the null=True field option  e.g., IntegerField null=True   allows an integer field to be left empty and generates DDL with NULL instead of the default NOT NULL .  In addition to the null option that’s enforced at the database level and which defaults to null=False,   Django also supports the blank option. The blank option also defaults to blank=False on all fields and is used  to enforce Django Python validation through forms that work on Django models  e.g., creating a Django model  record through a form in the Django admin or a custom Django form . If a Django model field is declared with  blank=True, Django permits the field to be left blank in a form, otherwise  i.e., if blank=True isn’t explicitly  declared in a model field  Django rejects the form and forces an end user to provide a value for the field.  Since the use of null and blank options can be one of the most confusing topics in Django model field  options, Table 7-2 presents a matrix with different model definitions and operations to better illustrate this  behavior.  288   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  =  ,  l l u n 0 3 = h t g n e l _ x a m    e u r T = k n a l b , e u r T    d l e i F r a h C . s l e d o m     d n a e u r T =  l l  u n  e u r T = k n a l b  d l e i F r a h C . s l e d o m  ,  0 3 = h t g n e l _ x a m     = e m a n _ e l d d m  i    e u r T = k n a l b  t l u a f e d h t i     w     e u r T = k n a l b    e u r T =  l l  u n  =  ,  l l u n 0 3 = h t g n e l _ x a m       e u r T  t l u a f e d h t i     w      e u r T =  l l  u n  _ e l d d m  i      e s l a F = k n a l b     = e m a n  , e s l a F = k n a l b     t l u a f e D     = e m a n _ e l d d m  i    e s l a F =  l l  u n  d l e i F r a h C . s l e d o m  _ x a m   d l e i F r a h C . s l e d o m    0 3 = h t g n e l              L L U N e b n a c e m a n _ e l d d m  i        L L U N   s a d e t a e r t   s i   e n o N              L L U N e b n a c e m a n _ e l d d m  i        L L U N   s a d e t a e r t   s i   e n o N  e u r T =  l l     u n o t   e u d       t ’ n a c e m a n _ e l d d m o s   d n a  i       r o f   s i   e u r T = k n a l b    ,  L L U N e b     . s  m r o f  e u r T =  l l     u n o t   e u d       t ’ n a c e m a n _ e l d d m o s   d n a  i     .

Predetermined Values: default, auto_now, auto_now_add,   and choices Sometimes it’s helpful to assign predetermined values to Django model fields. For example, to avoid empty  strings when no value is provided - as illustrated in some of the cases in Table 7-2 - you can use the default  option on a Django model field  e.g., provide a default id, city, or date . In most circumstances you assign  a default option as a hard-coded value or a method reference. Listing 7-6 illustrates an example of the  default option using both approaches.  Listing 7-6.  Django model default option use  def default_city  :     return "San Diego"  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30,default=default_city      state = models.CharField max_length=2,default='CA'   As you can see in Listing 7-6 we have two Django model fields that use the default option. First the  city field relies on the default=default_city value – note the lack of parentheses in the syntax, which  makes it a reference to the function – that tells Django to call the default_city method to populate the field  every time a new record is created.  It’s worth mentioning the method is placed outside the Django model class vs. declaring it in the same   class body; this is to allow serialization and support of Django model migrations in Python 2 projects.1   Next in Listing 7-6 you can see the state field uses the default='CA' value, which tells Django to use the  hard-coded CA string to populate the field when a new record is created.  The enforcement of default options is done entirely by Django Python  i.e., the database DDL is   unaware of any default values . This means that when you work with a model like the one in Listing 7-6,  Django Python intervenes to provide default values. For example, if you create a Django model instance as  Person.objects.create name='Downtown',address='Main Street 5' , the city and state values are  filled by Django Python to create the record. Similarly, if you go to the Django admin and attempt to create  an instance of the model in Listing 7-6, the city and state form fields are pre-filled with the default values.  Even though the default option works just as described for text fields, as well as number    and Boolean fields, it has particular behaviors for date fields - specifically models.DateField   and   models.DateTimeField   - that are important to explore, so let’s do that and while on the topic of dates   also learn about the auto_now and auto_now_add options related to date and time model fields.  1https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 topics migrations serializing-values  290   Listing 7-7.  Django model default options for dates and times, as well as auto_now and auto_now_add use  Chapter 7   Django MoDels  from datetime import date from django.utils import timezone  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      date = models.DateField default=date.today      datetime = models.DateTimeField default=timezone.now      date_lastupdated = models.DateField auto_now=True      date_added = models.DateField auto_now_add=True      timestamp_lastupdated = models.DateTimeField auto_now=True      timestamp_added = models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True   Listing 7-7 illustrates a modified version of the Store model from Listing 7-6 with a series of date field   variations. The first two additional fields date and datetime use a DateField with a default value using  Python’s standard datetime library and a DateTimeField with a default value using Django’s django.utils. timezone module, respectively – the sidebar contains more details on why the django.utils.timezone  module was used to create a date time value.  In this case, if you create a Store record based on the model in Listing 7-7, Django Python fills in the  values for the date and datetime fields based on the backing library’s functionality. Similarly, if you go to  the Django admin and attempt to create an instance of the model in Listing 7-7, the date and datetime form  fields are pre-filled with the default values for the current date and date with time, respectively.  DON’T ADD    PARENTHESES TO METHODS IN DEFAULT VALUES  If you look closely at the default values from previous listings, notice they lack    in their syntax, which  creates an important behavior. By omitting the    syntax, python assign a reference to a method and  evaluates the expression until runtime, but if you use the    syntax  e.g., default=timezone.now    python  evaluates the expression at compile time. For functions that return fixed values this is a non-issue, but  for functions that return dynamically calculated values  e.g., dates  this is critical; otherwise you get a  single value calculated at compile time  e.g., the date or datetime field would contain the same value  calculated at compile time for all records .  DON’T USE THE BASIC DATETIME.NOW FOR DATETIMEFIELD FIELDS  Django is time-zone aware by default - due to the Use_tZ = true in settings.py. this means that when  you handle dates with times  e.g., in DatetimeField model fields  you must provide time-zone aware  dates. this is why in listing 7-7 the models.DatetimeField default=timezone.now  statement uses  Django’s django.utils.timezone module, which generates time-zone aware dates.  291   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  In Listing 7-7 there’s an additional pair of DateField and DateTimeField fields that use the auto_  now=True and auto_now_add=True options. Both of these options work like the default option - in the sense  they add a default date or date & time - but have a slightly different behavior. The first important difference  is that while the default option can be used with several types of fields, the auto_now and auto_now_add  options are designed for DateField and DateTimeField fields.  Values for fields that use either the auto_now and auto_now_add options are generated when a record  is created. Values for fields that use the auto_now option are updated every time a record is changed, while  values for fields that use the auto_now_add option remain frozen for the lifetime of the record. By default,  DateField fields that use either the auto_now or auto_now_add options generate their value from datetime. date.today  , whereas DateTimeField fields that use either auto_now or auto_now_add options generate  their value from django.utils.timezone.now  .  Unlike fields with the default option where you can provide a value for the field, fields with the auto_now   and auto_now_add options can’t be overridden. This means that even if you create or update a record and  provide a value for a field with an auto_now or auto_now_add option, the value is ignored. Similarly, in the  Django admin by default fields that use the auto_now and auto_now_add option are not displayed because  their value can’t be modified. Finally, it’s worth mentioning the auto_now, auto_now_add and default options  are mutually exclusive  i.e., you can’t use more than one option in a field or it will result in an error .  As you can see, the auto_now option is ideal to track a record’s last-modified date, the auto_now_add is   ideal to track a record’s creation date, and the default option works as a general purpose modifiable date on  a form field.  Another scenario for predetermined values is to restrict a Django model field to a list of values with  the choices option to limit open-ended values and reduce disparate data and errors  e.g., a list of states  ["CA","AR"], instead of letting users introduce Ca, Cali, ar, or Arizona . Listing 7-8 illustrates an example   of a Django model field that uses the choices option.  Listing 7-8.  Django model choices option  ITEM_SIZES =                'S','Small' ,              'M','Medium' ,              'L','Large' ,              'P','Portion' ,                class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100      size = models.CharField choices=ITEM_SIZES,max_length=1   The first thing you need to use the choices option is create a list of values as a tuple of tuples as   illustrated in Listing 7-8. The ITEMS_SIZES tuple has four tuples, where the first tuple element represents  a key to use in the database  e.g., S,M  and the second tuple element represents a human-friendly  representation of the first tuple element  e.g., Small, Medium .  Next, in Listing 7-8 you can see the size field is assigned the choices=ITEM_SIZES value that tells  Django to use the keys from ITEM_SIZES as potential values. Note that in this case the keys to use in the  database are all one-character text values  e.g., S,M  that correspond to the CharField max_length=1  data  type, but you can also use numbers or Boolean values as keys so long as they match the target field data type.  292   Chapter 7   Django MoDels     Tip    the next chapter covers Django form models with the choices option.  Unique values: unique, unique_for_date, unique_for_month and  unique_for_year It’s possible to enforce a field value to be unique across all records. For example, in Listing 7-7 if you change  name=models.CharField max_length=30  to name=models.CharField max_length=30, unique=True  it  tells Django to ensure all Store records have a unique name value.  The unique option is enforced by Django at the database layer  i.e., by adding a DDL UNIQUE SQL  constraint , as well as the Django Python layer. In addition, the unique option is valid on all field types  except ManyToManyField, OneToOneField, and FileField.  To enforce uniqueness of a field along with a DateField or DateTimeField value, Django offers the   unique_for_date, unique_for_month, and unique_for_year options. For example, in Listing 7-7 to enforce  the name field value be unique with a date of the date_lastupdated field you can use the name = models. CharField max_length=30, unique_for_date="date_lastupdated"  statement that tells Django to  allow only one record with the same name and date_lastupdated  e.g., you can’t have two records with  name="Downtown" and date_lastupdated="2018-01-01", but two records with name="Downtown" and  different date_lastupdated values are allowed .  The unique_for_month and unique_for_year options provide wider ranges to enforce validation. For   example, the name = models.CharField max_length=30, unique_for_month="date_lastupdated"  statement  tells Django to only allow one record with the same name and date_lastupdated value for the same month  and the name = models.CharField max_length=30, unique_for_year="date_lastupdated"  statement tells  Django to only allow one record with the same name and date_lastupdated value for the same year.  Due to the more complex requirements of the unique_for_date, unique_for_month, and unique_for_ year options, the enforcement of these options is done at the Django Python layer. In addition, due to the  nature of the validation process these options are only valid for DateField and DateTimeField fields, noting  that for DateTimeField cases only the date portion of the value is used.  Form Values: Editable, help_text, verbose_name, and error_messages When Django models are used in the context of forms, form fields backed by Django model fields can be  influenced through various model options. The following options are identical to the form options you  learned in the previous chapter on Django forms, except these options are assigned as part of model fields   to influence forms fields.  By default, all Django model fields presented in forms are editable, but you can change this behavior   by using the editable=False option. Setting a model field with editable=False tells Django to omit it  completely in a form  e.g., in the Django admin  and as a consequence any validation associated with the  form field is also bypassed.  The help_text option allows the inclusion of additional text alongside a form field. Listing 7-9   illustrates the use of the help_text option.  Listing 7-9.  Django model help_text option  ITEM_SIZES =                'S','Small' ,              'M','Medium' ,              'L','Large' ,              'P','Portion' ,                293   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30       description = models.CharField max_length=100,help_text="Ensure you provide some   description of the ingredients"       size = models.CharField choices=ITEM_SIZES,max_length=1       calories = models.IntegerField help_text="Calorie count should reflect  size  of   the item"   In Listing 7-9 you can see there are two fields with the help_text option. When a Django form based on  this Django model is rendered in a template, the help_text defined in the model goes on to form part of the  final form layout.  By default, a Django model field name is used to generate the header of a Django form field using a   capitalized version of the model field name.  e.g., Name, Description . You can configure more verbose form  field headers with the verbose_name option  e.g., models.CharField  max_length=30,verbose_name="ITEM  NAME" , outputs the ITEM NAME header for the form field.  If you attempt to save or update a Django model in a form and any of the values don’t comply with the  underlying field types, Django generates default error messages for the non-compliant values. These error  messages while helpful are generic in nature, so it’s possible to customize these error messages for each field  with the error_messages option. The error_messages option accepts a dictionary of key-values, where keys  represent error codes and values error messages. See the previous chapter on Django forms for detailed  examples on the structure of the error_messages dictionary.     Tip    Chapter 9 covers Django model forms in greater detail.  Database Definition Language  DDL  Values: db_column, db_index,  db_tablespace, primary_key By default, Django generates a database table’s column names based on a Django model’s field names. For  example, if a Django model field is named menu, Django generates a DB column named menu. It’s possible   to override this behavior using the db_column option  e.g., name = models.CharField max_length=30,  db_column="my_custom_name" . Django generates the DDL with the my_custom_name column name .  Another database-related option for Django models is the db_index option that tells Django to generate   a database index for the field  e.g., size = models.CharField choices=ITEM_SIZES,max_length=1,db_ index=True  generates a database index for the size field . Be aware that under the following circumstances  Django automatically creates a database index, so db_index=True for the following scenarios is redundant:   	   	  If a field uses the unique=True option, Django automatically creates an index for the  field. You can disable this behavior setting db_index=False.  If a field is a ForeignKey data type, Django automatically creates an index for the  field. You can disable this behavior setting db_index=False.   the meta indexes option can also define indexes for a single or multiple fields. see the following      Tip  section on “Meta Class options” for more details.  294   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  If you use a PostgreSQL or Oracle database, it’s possible to specify a DB tablespace for a field’s index   through the db_tablespace name. By default, Django uses a project’s DEFAULT_INDEX_TABLESPACE value in  settings.py to determine a tablespace, but if a field uses the db_tablespace this value takes precedence. If  a database brand doesn’t support tablespaces  e.g., MySQL or SQLite  this option is ignored.  Finally, the primary_key option allows you to define a primary key for a model. By default, if no Django   model field is set with the primary_key=True statement, Django automatically creates an AutoField data  type named id to hold the primary key  e.g., id = models.AutoField primary_key=True   . The typical use  case for the primary_key option is for fields that are references to other fields  e.g., OneToOneField  or if you  want a custom primary key due to design constraints.  Built-In and Custom Validators: Validators In addition to the data enforcement options for Django models described in previous sections  e.g., unique,  default , Django models also offer enforcement of values through the validators option, which allow more  advanced validation logic through built-in or custom methods.  Django model offers a series of built-in validator methods in the django.core.validators package that are   used by model data types. For example, the models.EmailField data type relies on django.core.validators. EmailValidator to validate email values, just as the models.IntegerField data type uses the MinValueValidator  and MaxValueValidator validators to enforce the min_value and max_value options, respectively.  In addition to Django built-in validator methods, you can also create custom validator methods. The   only requirements to create custom validator methods are for a method to accept a model field’s input and  to throw a django.core.exceptions.ValidatorError in case the value doesn’t comply with the expected  rules. Listing 7-10 illustrates a model that uses both a built-in validator and a custom validator.  Listing 7-10.  Django model field validators option with built-in and custom validator  ITEM_SIZES =                'S','Small' ,              'M','Medium' ,              'L','Large' ,              'P','Portion' ,                 Import built-in validator from  django.core.validators import MinLengthValidator   Create custom validator from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError  def calorie_watcher value :     if value > 5000:         raise ValidationError                'Whoa! calories are % value s ? We try to serve healthy food, try something   less than 5000!' ,              params={'value': value},               if value < 0:         raise ValidationError               'Strange calories are % value s ? This can\'t be, value must be greater than 0' ,             params={'value': value},            295   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30,validators=[MinLengthValidator 5 ]      description = models.CharField max_length=100      size = models.CharField choices=ITEM_SIZES,max_length=1      calories = models.IntegerField validators=[calorie_watcher]   The first validators option in Listing 7-10 uses the built-in MinLengthValidator validator class to   enforce the values for the name field contain at least 5 characters. The second validators option in Listing 7-10   uses the custom calorie_watcher validator method to enforce the values for the calories field fit a certain  range and uses custom messages in case this range is not met. It’s worth mentioning that it’s possible to use  multiple validator methods on a single field with a list syntax  e.g., validators=[MinLengthValidators 5 , MaxLengthValidators 100 ] .  Django Model Default and Custom Behaviors  When you create a Django model class it always inherits its behavior from the django.db.models.Model  class, as illustrated back in Listing 7-1. This Django class provides a Django model with a great deal of  functionality, which includes basic operations via methods like save   and delete  , as well as naming  conventions and query behaviors for the model.  In most circumstances, the default behaviors provided by the django.db.models.Model class are   sufficient, but in other cases you’ll want to provide custom behavior. Next, I’ll enumerate a Django model’s  functionalities provided via the django.db.models.Model class.  Model Methods All Django models inherit a series of methods for operations that include saving, deleting, validating,  loading, and applying custom logic to model data. In the next sections I’ll describe the default behavior for  each of these methods and how to customize their behavior.  save   method The save   method offers one of the most common operations for Django models: to save  i.e., create or  update  a record to a database. Once you create or have a reference to a Django model instance, you call the  save   method to create update the instance on a database. Listing 7-11 illustrates this process.  296   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Listing 7-11.  Django model use of the save   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Create a model Store instance store_corporate = Store name='Corporate',address='624 Broadway',city='San Diego',state='CA', email='corporate@coffeehouse.com'    Invoke the save   method to create save the record  No record id reference, so a create operation is made and the reference is updated with id store_corporate.save     Change field on instance store_corporate.city='625 Broadway'   Invoke the save   method to update save the record  Record has id reference from prior save   call, so operation is update store_corporate.save    In Listing 7-11 two calls are made to the save   method on the same reference; the first one creates a   record on the database and the second one updates the record on the database.  Can you tell how Django knows when to create and when to update a record with the same save     method? It’s not in plain sight so don’t worry if you can’t spot it.  In the first section of this chapter when you created a Django model, I mentioned Django automatically   adds an id field as a primary key to all Django models, in order to make searching for records easier and  more efficient. The presence of this id primary key is what Django uses to determine if the save   method  performs a create or update operation.  Although there’s no trace of an explicit id primary key-value in Listing 7-11, a model instance gets an id   value after Django creates an instance. The first time the save   method is invoked in Listing 7-11, Django  attempts to create a new record because it can’t find an id primary key-value on the instance. However, if the  creation operation is successful, the database assigns the record an id primary key-value that’s returned to  Django, which updates the reference with this id primary key-value.  On subsequent calls made to the save   method on the same model reference, Django detects the   presence of the id primary key-value and performs an update operation based on this id primary key-value.  In case you’re wondering, if you add an explicit id primary key-value to a record reference, Django also  performs an update because that’s the flag it looks for to determine whether to create or update a record,  so be aware placing an explicit id primary key updates overwrites the database record associated with the  given id primary key.  Now that you have a firm understanding of the default behaviors of a Django model’s save   method,   I’ll describe the various options available for the save   method. The save   method accepts a series of  arguments to override its default behavior; Table 7-3 illustrates these arguments, their behavior, and their  default value.  297   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Table 7-3.  Django model save   method arguments  Argument  Default  Description  force_insert  force_insert=False  force_update  force_update=False  using  update_fields  using=DEFAULT_ DB_ALIAS, where  DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS  is a constant with a  value of default update_fields=None  commit  commit=True  Explicitly tells Django to force a create operation on a record   e.g., .save force_insert=True . This is rarely used but can  be helpful for cases when you don't or can't rely on Django  detecting a create operation  i.e., via the id primary key . Explicitly tells Django to force an update operation on a record   e.g., .save force_update=True . This is rarely used but can  be helpful for cases when you don't or can't rely on Django  detecting an update operation  i.e., via the id primary key . Allows save   to perform the operation against a database that's  not the default value in settings.py  e.g.. .save using='oracle'   performs the operation against the oracle database, where  oracle is a key in the DATABASES variable in settings.py  See  the later section in the chapter on multiple databases. Accepts a list of fields to update  e.g., .save update_fields=  ['name']  only updates a record's name value . Helpful when  you have large models and want to do a more efficient granular  update, because by default Django updates all model fields.  Ensures a record is saved to the database. In certain  circumstances  e.g., model forms or relationship operations   commit is set to False to create a model instance without saving  it. This allows additional operations  on forms, relationships   to be made and based on their outcome, determine to make a  standard save   call to write the record to the database.  The option you’re likely to use the most from Table 7-3 is update_fields, since it produces a   performance boost by selectively choosing which fields to update. However, Table 7-3 gives you the full  series of options in case you hit an edge-case with the save   method.  Finally, to close our discussion on the save   method, it’s possible to define an implementation of  the save   method on a Django model to execute custom logic when the method is called. Listing 7-12  illustrates this process.  Listing 7-12.  Django model with custom save   method  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2       def save self, *args, **kwargs :          Do custom logic here  e.g. validation, logging, call third party service           Run default save   method         super Store,self .save *args, **kwargs   298   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Notice the save   method in Listing 7-12 is declared inline with a Django model’s fields. In this case,   when a call is made to save   on a reference for this type of model  e.g., downtown.save    Django attempts  to run the model’s custom save   method. This is helpful in circumstances where you want to perform other  actions  e.g., log a message, call a third-party service  when a model instance is created or updated. The last  snippet in the custom save   method super Store,self .save *args, **kwargs  tells Django to run the  base save   method from django.db.models.Model.   see the Django signals section later in this chapter to execute logic before or after a model’s save        Tip  method is run.  delete   method The delete   method is used to eliminate a record from the database through a reference. For example, if in  Listing 7-11 you call store_corporate.delete   - where store_corporate is the record reference - Django  removes the record from the database. Under the hood, the delete   method relies on the id primary key to  remove the record, so it’s a requirement for a reference to have the id value to invoke the delete   method.  When the delete   method is called on a reference, its id primary key-value is removed but the   record’s remaining values remain in memory. In addition, the delete   method responds with the amount  of deleted records  e.g.,  4, {u'stores.Store_amenities': 3, u'stores.Store': 1} , indicates 4 overall  records were deleted, with 1 Store record and 3 stores.Store_amenities – the stores.Store represents a  relationship on the main Store model.  Similar to the save   method, the delete   method also supports two arguments: using=DEFAULT_ DB_ALIAS and keep_parents=False. The using argument allows you to specify an alternate database to  perform the delete   operation on - see Table 7-3 for more details on this type of argument and the multiple  database section later in this chapter. And the keep_parents arguments is useful when the delete    operation takes place on a model with a relationship and you wish to keep the parent model’s data intact  - or removed, which is the default. More details on the use of keep_parents are given in the Django model  relationships section later in this chapter.  And finally, it’s also possible to define a custom delete   method on a Django model class - just like   save   in Listing 7-12-- to execute custom logic  e.g., create an audit trail  when a record is removed.   see the Django signals section later in this chapter to execute logic before or after a model’s delete        Tip  method is run.  Validation methods: clean_fields  , clean  , validate_unique   and full_clean   When you create or update a Django model instance with the save   method, Django enforces that the  instance values comply with those of the model definition. For example, if you use the model field name =  models.CharField max_length=30  Django enforces the name value is a text field with at most 30 characters. The most important part to understand about Django model instance validation is that it’s done on two   layers: at the database layer and the Django Python layer, both of which are enforced via the model data  types you learned about in the previous section.  Let’s analyze the database layer validation layer first. Once you have a Django model and create its  initial migration - as described in the first section of this chapter on “Migrations and the Django Model  Workflow” - Django generates the database DDL  Data definition language  to create a database table in  accordance with the model definition  e.g., the Django model field CharField max_length=30  generates a   299   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  varchar 30  NOT NULL database column type . Therefore due to this initial database DDL, all Django model  values that don’t comply with validation rules are guaranteed to be rejected at the database layer where it’s  the database that performs the validation.  Now let’s analyze the Django Python validation layer. Although the Django model data types for fields    e.g., CharField max_length=30   can give the impression they act on model instances automatically,  the Django Python validation layer requires you to execute validation methods on the model instance  to enforce validation. If you don’t use these validation methods – which are the topic of this section – the  database validation layer is the only enforcer of model field data types.  Although relying on validation at the database layer is perfectly acceptable, using model validation at   the Django Python layer has the advantage of supporting more complex validation rules, as well as reducing  database load for operations that will end up being rejected by a database. However, unlike database  layer validation, which is automatically done after a Django model’s first migration, Django Python layer  validation requires you use some of the following model methods.  Let’s first explore the Django model validation clean_fields   method. Listing 7-13 illustrates a model   definition, followed by a call sequence that uses the clean_fields   method.  Listing 7-13.  Django model use of validation clean_fields   method  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2    Create a model Store instance, that violates the max_length rule store_corporate = Store name='This is a very long name for the Corporate store that exceeds  the 30 character limit',address='624 Broadway',city='San Diego',state='AZ',email='corporate@ coffeehouse.com'    No error yet   You could call save   and let the database reject the instance...  But you can also validate at the Django Python level with the clean_fields   method store_corporate.clean_fields   Traceback  most recent call last :     raise ValidationError errors  ValidationError: {'name': [u'Ensure this value has at most 30 characters  it has 84 .']}  First off, notice the model’s name field in Listing 7-13 uses the max_length=30 option to enforce that   values of this kind are capped to 30 characters. After the model definition, you can see the store_corporate  instance breaks this rule with a value greater than 30 characters, which means Django doesn’t detect broken  model rules at instance creation.  While you can attempt to call save   on this last instance and let the database reject the operation via  its DDL, you can call the clean_fields   method on the instance to tell Django to check the values of the  instance against the model date types and raise an error.  Also notice the output of the clean_fields   method in Listing 7-8 is a ValidatioError data type   with a dictionary. This last dictionary follows the key-value pattern ' '-'[<error_message_ list>]', making it easy to identify multiple validation errors and reuse this data for other purposes  e.g.,  logging, presenting the error in a template .  300   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  While the clean_fields   method validates model values individually against their data types, the   clean   method can be used to enforce more elaborate rules  e.g., relationships or specific values . Unlike  the clean_fields   method you can invoke directly, you must define an implementation of the clean    method with validation logic, as illustrated in Listing 7-14.  Listing 7-14.  Django model use of validation clean   method  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      def clean self :          Don't allow 'San Diego' city entries that have state different than 'CA'         if self.city == 'San Diego' and self.state != 'CA':              raise ValidationError 'Wait San Diego is CA!, are you sure there is another San   Diego in %s ?' % self.state    Create a model Store instance, that violates city state rule store_corporate = Store name='Corporate',address='624 Broadway',city='San Diego',state='AZ', email='corporate@coffeehouse.com'    To enforce more complex rules call the clean   method implemented on a model store_corporate.clean   Traceback  most recent call last :      raise ValidationError 'Wait San Diego is in CA!, are you sure there is another San Diego   in %s ?' %  self.state    ValidationError: [u'Wait San Diego is in CA!, are you sure there is another San Diego in AZ ?']  Notice in Listing 7-14 the Django model class defines the clean   method that enforces that if an   instance city value is San Diego its state must be CA, and if this condition is not met, a ValidationError  error is raised. Next, when the clean   method is invoked on an instance that violates this rule, a  ValidationError error is raised just like the clean_fields   method.  Another Django validation mechanism you can use is the clean_unique   method to enforce    no two instances have the same value for a field that uses unique options. Listing 7-15 illustrates the use   the clean_unique   method.   the previous section on Django model data types describes Django’s various unique values options      Note  for model fields: unique, unique_for_date, unique_for_month, and unique_for_year.  Listing 7-15.  Django model use of validation clean_unique   method with unique* fields  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2   301    Create a model Store instance store_corporate =  Store name='Downtown',address='624 Broadway',city='San Diego',state='AZ',   email='corporate@coffeehouse.com'   Chapter 7   Django MoDels   Save instance store_corporate.save     Create another instance to violate uniqueness of address field store_uptown = Store name='Uptown',address='624 Broadway', city='San Diego',state='CA'    You could call save   and let the database reject the instance...  But you can also validate at the Django Python level with the validate_unique   method store_uptown.validate_unique   Traceback  most recent call last :     raise ValidationError errors  ValidationError: {'address': [u'Store with this Address already exists.']}  Look at how the address field of the Store model in Listing 7-15 uses unique=True, which tells Django   not to allow two Store instances with the same address value. Next, we create a Store instance with  address='624 Broadway' and save it to the database. Right after, we create another Store instance with the  same address='624 Broadway' value, but because the address model field has the unique option this new  instance is in violation of the rule.  Therefore when you call the validate_unique   method on the store_uptown reference, Django  raises a ValidationError exception indicating there’s already a Store record with the same address in  the database. Note that even if you didn’t call the validate_unique   method, the database would end  up rejecting the duplicate record since the unique=True produces the necessary DDL to enforce unique  address values.  In addition to the clean_unique function performing validation on fields marked with unique options,   the clean_unique method also enforces validation for the unique_together option declared in a model’s  Meta class. This variation is illustrated in Listing 7-16.  Listing 7-16.  Django model use of validation clean_unique   method with Meta unique_together  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      email = models.EmailField       class Meta:         unique_together =  "name", "email"    Create instance to show use of validate_unique   via Meta option store_downtown_horton =  Store name='Downtown',address'Horton Plaza',city='San Diego',   state='CA',email='downtown@coffeehouse.com'    Save intance to DB store_downtown_horton.save     Create additional instance that violated unique_together rule in Meta class store_downtown_fv =  Store name='Downtown',address'Fashion Valley',city='San Diego',   state='CA',email='downtown@coffeehouse.com'   302   Chapter 7   Django MoDels   You could call save   and let the database reject the instance but lets use validate_unique store_downtown_fv.validate_unique   Traceback  most recent call last : ValidationError: {'__all__': [u'Store with this Name and Email already exists.']}  Notice how the class in Listing 7-16 declares the Meta class followed by unique_together =  "name",   "email" , which tells Django not to allow two Store instances with the same name and email value.  Next, two Store records are created with the same name and email value. Because this is in    violation of the Django model meta option unique_together =  "name", "email" , after you save   the first record store_downtown_horton and call the validate_unique   method on the second record  store_downtown_fv, Django raises a ValidationError exception indicating there’s already a Store record  with the same name and email values in the database. Toward the end of this section I’ll describe a Django  model’s Meta class options in greater detail.  Finally, the last validation method available on all Django models is the full_clean   method, which is   a shortcut to run the clean_fields  , clean   and validate_unique   methods - in that order.  Data loading methods: Refresh_from_db  , from_db  , and   get_deferred_fields   methods The refresh_from_db   method is a helpful aid if you want to update a preexisting model instance with  data from the database, either because the database was updated by another process or you accidentally   or purposely  changed the model instance and want it to reflect the data in database once again. Using  the refresh_from_db   method is as simple as executing it on a model reference  e.g., downtown.refresh_ from_db   updates the downtown instance from values in the database .  Although the refresh_from_db   method is generally called without arguments, it does support two   optional arguments. The using argument can be used to specify an alternate database from which to perform  the refresh operation, a mechanism that works just like the option used in the save   and delete   methods  and is described in Table 7-3. The fields argument can be used to selectively refresh certain model fields; if  no fields argument list is provided then the refresh_from_db   method refreshes all model fields.  In most circumstances, the initial loading mechanism for Django model instances is reasonable and   sufficient. However, if you want to customize the default loading mechanism you can define the from_db    method. Unlike the refresh_from_db   method, which can be called on a model instance, the from_db    method cannot be called directly and is intended to be part of a model class to be called every time a model  instance is created from database data. So what is a good reason for the from_db method? If you want to  defer loading model data.  For example, if you start to work with large Django models  e.g., more than 10 fields  you can quickly   notice a performance hit by accessing large amounts of data at once. To minimize this performance hit, you  can create a from_db method to defer the loading of model field data, instead of having Django load the full  field data set at once which it does by default.  Complementing the functionality of deferred model fields is the get_deferred_fields   method,  which returns a list of model fields that have been deferred from loading. Although the from_db   and   get_deferred_fields   methods don’t have as many usage scenarios as the refresh_from_db   method,  you may encounter a need for these two model methods once you work with larger and more complex  models. The next chapter’s section on CRUD operations describes the use of these methods in greater detail.  303   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Custom methods All the methods I’ve described up to this point come from Django’s django.db.models.Model class. While  it’s important to learn how to use these methods and provide your own implementation for them, this  doesn’t necessarily mean a Django model class is restricted to using just these methods. You can use your  own custom model class methods, as illustrated in Listing 7-17.  Listing 7-17.  Django model with custom method  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2       def latitude_longitude self :          Call remote service to get latitude & longitude         latitude, longitude = geocoding_method self.address, self.city, self.state          return latitude, longitude  The latitude_longitude method in Listing 7-17 gives the Django model the ability to offer a common   calculation on the model instance. For example, for a Store instance called downtown you could call  downtown.latitude_longitude   to get a result based on the instance’s address, city, and state values  aided by a remote service. This type of custom method is helpful because it favors encapsulation, keeping  the logic that operates on a Django model where it belongs – in the model class itself.  Model Manager Field: Objects The objects field - technically known as the default Django model manager - is available on all Django  models and is charged with managing all query operations related to Django model instances. This means  that when you perform Django model query operations  e.g., create, read, update, or delete  you’ll end up  using a Django model’s objects field or model manager.  A Django model’s objects reference is used directly on a model class and not an instance of a model.  For example, to read a Store model record with id=1 you would use the Store.objects.get id=1  syntax  and to delete all Store model records you would use the Store.objects.all  .delete   syntax.  The objects field of a model manager is not explicitly declared as part of Django model – just as it was   described in Listing 7-1 alongside a Django model’s id field – but it’s nevertheless present on all Django  models. You can, however, customize the default model manager to use another field name  e.g., if you  require a Django model field named objects, you can customize the model manager to be named mgr .  Listing 7-18 illustrates a model class that renames the default model manager to use the mgr reference name.  Listing 7-18.  Django default model manager renamed  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      mgr = models.Manager    304   As you can see in Listing 7-18, you explicitly declare a model field with models.Manager   to mark   another field as the default model manager. If you override the default manager in this way, you would use  the Store.mgr.get id=1  syntax to read a record with id=1 or the Store.mgr.all  .delete   syntax to  delete all store records vs. the default model manager objects syntax.  Chapter 7   Django MoDels   the next chapter on Django model queries is dedicated to exploring the functional aspects of the      Note  default model manager or objects reference, including CrUD operations with multiple records and some of the  subtle behaviors associated with QuerySet classes, as well as model managers.  Model Meta Class and Options In the previous section on model validation methods - in Listing 7-16 - I made use of the Meta class on a  Django model to enforce the uniqueness of model field values. In this section I’ll expand on the purpose and  options available for a Django model’s Meta class.  The Meta class in a Django model is intended to define behaviors for a Django model as a whole, unlike  Django model data types  e.g., models.CharField , which define granular behaviors on Django model fields   e.g., a model field data can be 30 or 50 characters in length .  The Django Meta class and its options are always declared after a Django model’s data types, as   illustrated in Listing 7-19.  Listing 7-19.  Django model with Meta class and ordering option  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2       class Meta:         ordering = ['-state']  In Listing 7-19 you can see the class Meta: statement declares the ordering = ['-state'] option.  In this case, the ordering option tells Django that when a query is made on the model it orders the results  by the state field in descending order. The ordering meta option is helpful because it overrides the default  model query order - which is by a model’s id - and it avoids the need to constantly and explicitly declare a  model query’s sort order.  Now that you have a basic understanding of a Django model's Meta class, in the upcoming sections I’ll   classify the various Meta options by category so you can easily identify them and use them appropriately.  Database Definition Language  DDL  table options: db_table, db_tablespace,  managed, required_db_vendor, required_db_features and unique_together By default, the database table name for a Django model is based on the app name and model, with all  lowercase letters and separated by an underscore. For example, for an app named stores, a model class  named Amenity uses the stores_amenity database table by default. You can define a different database   table name for a Django model with the meta db_table option.  305   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  By default, if a Django project’s backing database brand  e.g., Oracle  supports the concept of a   tablespace, Django uses the DEFAULT_TABLESPACE variable in settings.py as the default tablespace. It’s  possible to specify an alternative tablespace for a Django model through the meta db_tablespace option.  Note that if a Django project’s backing database doesn’t support the concept of a tablespace, this option is  ignored.  All Django models are subject to the life cycle described earlier in the Django models workflow in  Figure 7-1. As part of this life cycle, Django manages the DDL that creates and or destroys the backing  database table for every Django model. If you want to disable Django executing a model’s default DDL  against a database, you can do so with meta managed=False option. The managed=False option is useful  when a model’s backing database table is created by some other means and you don’t want Django to  interfere with the management of this table.  Because Django can work with different database back ends  e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL  you can  have situations where certain model definitions are designed to work with features that are not available on  all database back ends. To ensure a Django model is deployed against a certain database back end, you can  use two Meta class options.  The required_db_vendor option accepts the values sqlite, postgresql, mysql, and oracle to ensure   a project’s underlying database connection is for a given vendor; if the connection does not match the  specified vendor, the model is not migrated against the database.  The required_db_features option is used to ensure a backing database connection is enabled with a  given list of features, and if the connection does not have the specified feature list enabled, the model is not  migrated against the database.  Django defines over 75 database features in django.db.backends.base.features.py. Once a   connection is made to a database, you can get its supported Django features with:  from django.db import connection dir connection.features   The previous snippet outputs the features supported by a database connected to a Django project.   Most Django database features are supported across all brands, so the required_db_features option only  requires you to declare esoteric database features to ensure the underlying Django database can support  a given model  e.g., gis_enabled ensures a database supports Django’s Geographic Information Systems  model feature, can_share_in_memory_db is a feature supported by SQLite but not MySQL, is_sql_auto_is_ null_enabled is a feature supported in MySQL but not SQLite .  The unique_together option enforces no two model records have the same pair of values. For example,  unique_together 'city','state'  ensures only one record has a city state value  e.g., San Diego,CA  and  rejects all other attempts to create a record with the same city state value. The unique_together option  creates the DDL to enforce this rule at the database level. The unique_together option also supports the  ability to specify multiple unique field pairs through a list of tuples  e.g., unique_together  'city',  'state' , 'city','zipcode'   enforces both city state and city zipcode fields are unique together .  Database Definition Language  DDL  index options: Indexes and   index_together Indexes play an important role in the efficient lookup of relational database records. In very simple terms,  indexes are special structures that contain certain record column values that ensure queries are made faster  than doing queries on the full record values in the main database table.  The Django meta class offers two options to generate the necessary DDL  e.g., CREATE INDEX...  to   create database indexes against Django model fields: indexes and index_together.  306   Chapter 7   Django MoDels   By default fields marked as primary keys and unique don’t require explicit creation of indexes. see the      Tip  previous section on “db_index,” “primary_key” in model data types.  The index meta options accepts a list of models.Index references. A model.Index reference accepts  a fields value – which in itself is a list of model fields on which to create an index – and an optional name  value – which is a string to name the index. Listing 7-20 illustrates the use of the index meta option.  Listing 7-20.  Django model with meta class and index option  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2       class Meta:         indexes = [              models.Index fields=['city','state'] ,              models.Index fields=['city'],name='city_idx'           ]  As you can see in Listing 7-20, the Store model defines two indexes. A two-field index for the city and  state fields, as well as an index for the city field named city_idx. If no name value is provided for an index,  Django automatically gives the index a name.   By default Django creates B*tree indexes for all relational database brands. however, if you’re using      Tip  postgresQl, Django also supports Brin and gin indexes.2  The index_together meta option allows you to define a multi-field index on a Django model, just like   the model.Index reference in the indexes meta options. The only difference being the index_together  option is a top-level option of the Meta class  e.g., index_together=['city','state'] is equivalent to the  first index in Listing 7-20 .  Naming convention options: verbose_name, verbose_name_plural, label,  label_lower, and app_label By default, Django models are referenced by their class name. In most cases, relying on this name is a non- issue – like the class Store in Listing 7-20, a Store is a store anyway you see it. But on other occasions, a  model class name can use an acronym or abbreviation that while reasonable for development purposes, is  inexpressive for others  e.g., on a user interface UI  element like a template or the Django admin .  2https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref contrib postgres indexes module-django.contrib. postgres.indexes  307   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Django models can use both the verbose_name and verbose_name_plural meta class options to assign   more explicit model names. For example, if a model class is named SSN, you can declare the meta class  option verbose_name='Social Security Number' to use this last value on UIs that rely on model instances.  By default, when referring to multiple instances of a Django model class, Django pluralizes a model class  by appending an s  e.g., Store becomes Stores . The verbose_name_plural meta class option allows you  to define a custom plural value when the letter s is not applicable  e.g., the model class Strawberry with  verbose_name_plural='Strawberries' becomes Strawberries in a plural context, instead of the default  and incorrect Straberrys .  To access a Django model meta class verbose_name and verbose_name_plural values, you can use the   syntax  ._meta.verbose_name and  ._meta.verbose_name_plural.   If you want to assign a verbose name value to individual model fields, see the verbose_name in the      Tip  previous section on Django model data types.  A Django model label refers to the combination of an  . , which can   sometimes be necessary when models are used as part of forms or UI components. The Django model meta  class offers the label and label_lower read-only attributes – by read-only it means the attribute values  can’t be set  i.e., like other meta attributes such as verbose_name  but only read as part of the meta class.  For example, if a Store model is defined inside the stores app, the statement Store._meta.label outputs  stores.Store. And the label_lower attribute outputs a lowercase label value, including classes that use  camel case3  e.g., for the model class StoreFront in the stores app, StoreFront._meta.label outputs  stores.StoreFront. and Store._meta.label_lower outputs stores.storefront .  A Django app is an integral part of all Django models since it defines among other things, a model’s   default database table prefix, where a model’s migrations are placed and a model’s default reference label.  The meta class app_label attribute allows you to assign an explicit app name to a Django model. The  Django meta app_label takes precedence over the default app model naming mechanism. One of the last  sections in this chapter on placing Django models outside of models.py contains more details on the meta  app_label option.  Inheritance Meta options: Abstract and proxy The meta abstract option allows a Django model to function as a base class that doesn’t have a backing  database table, but serves as a foundation for other Django model classes. Listing 7-21 illustrates a set of  Django models that use the abstract option.  Listing 7-21.  Django model abstract option  from django.db import models  class Item models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100      class Meta:         abstract = True  class Drink Item :     mililiters = models.IntegerField    3https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Camel_case  308   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  The Item model class in Listing 7-21 is abstract, which means it behaves like other abstract classes   across programming languages.4 For Django model classes, it means no database table is created for this  type model, nor is it possible to create an instance out of it. However, it’s possible to use an abstract model as  the basis for other Django models.  In Listing 7-21 you can see the Drink model class inherits its behavior from the Item class  vs. the   standard Django models.Model class . Notice the Drink class declares the additional mililiters field, but  since it inherits its behavior from the Item class, the Drink class also gains the model Item class fields  i.e.,  the Drink class becomes a three-field model, with a database table with three columns – name, description,  and mililiters .  The meta proxy option is also designed for Django model inheritance scenarios. But unlike the   abstract option where parent classes are declared abstract and children inherit their behavior, the proxy  option is designed to give child classes access to a parent class without the child becoming a full-fledged  model class. Classes marked with the meta proxy option enable them to perform operations on a parent  class and its database table, without having a database table of their own.  For example, a Store model class can have multiple model proxies  e.g., FranchiseStore, Employee   OwnedStore  where each proxy class defines its own operations made against Store models, while not  replicating Store data into a separate table. Django model proxies are ideal to shield a parent class against  model changes  e.g., custom model managers or custom operations  while still retaining access to the  database table of the parent class.  Query Meta options: Ordering, order_with_respect_to, get_latest_by,    default_manager_name, base_manager_name, default_related_name,   and select_on_save When you make Django model queries – which are explained in full in the next chapter – there are many  kinds of default behaviors associated with their operations. If you want to use non-default query behaviors,  you can explicitly create queries with explicit arguments. However, creating explicit queries over and over  can get tiresome; you can instead rely on the meta options explained in this section to assign a model’s  default query behaviors.  The ordering meta option is used to define the default ordering for a list of model instances. Although  you can use the order_by   method to define the order for a group of model instances  e.g., Store.objects. all  .order_by '-name' , to get all Store objects in descending order by name , you can use the ordering  meta option  e.g., ordering=[-name] on the Store model  to ensure a list of model instances is always sorted  without needing the order_by   method  e.g., Store.objects.all   uses the ordering meta option to  determine query order .  The order_with_respect_to meta option is also used to define default sorting query behavior, but in  the context of model relationships. If you perform a query on a model that has a relationship and you want  to establish the default ordering on a field in the related model, you can use the order_with_respect_to  meta option.  The get_latest_by meta option is used to specify a default model field for queries that use the   latest   and earliest   methods. Both the latest   and earliest   methods specify a field by which  to get the latest or earliest model record  e.g., Receipt.objects.latest 'date'  to get the latest Receipt  model instance by date . You can use the get_latest_by meta option so queries made with, the latest    and earliest   methods don’t require an argument.  4https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Abstract_type  309   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  All models rely on the objects field as their default model manager, as described in the earlier “Model   Manager Field” section. The default_manager_name meta option is used in cases where a model has  multiple model managers and you must specify a default manager. The base_manager_name meta option is  used to specify a base model manager – which defaults to django.db.models.Manager – for cases in which  a base model manager isn’t appropriate. The next chapter describes the use custom model managers and  these meta options in greater detail.  The default_related_name meta option is used to define the reverse name for a field that serves as a  related object. This reverse name concept is explained in greater detail in the model relationships section  later in this chapter.  The select_on_save meta option is a Django legacy option, which tells Django to use the pre-1.6  Django version of a model’s save   method algorithm. This algorithm has a distinct behavior than the  save   method behavior explained earlier in this chapter.  Permission Meta options: default_permissions and permissions All Django models are given a set of permissions to manipulate object model instances. These permissions  are an integral part of Django’s built-in user management system, which is used extensively by the Django  admin and can be integrated as part of the general permission workflow of a Django project.  By default, all Django models are given permissions to add, change, and delete object instances  through the meta default_permissions set to  'add','change','delete'  – who can actually add,  change, and delete instances is covered in the chapter on Django user management and the Django admin.  You can declare an explicit meta default_permissions value on a model class to rescind one if its default  permissions  e.g., an empty tuple    if you don’t want to assign permissions or  'add','change'  to deny a  model class the delete permission .  The permissions meta attribute is designed to assign custom permissions to a Django model. For   example, you can assign custom permissions to a Django model to allow tasks that are different than the  generic add, change, delete operations  e.g., can_do_refunds on a Store model . The permissions meta  attribute accepts a list of tuple permissions, where each tuple is composed of a reference permission code  and a verbose permission description  e.g.,   'can_do_refunds','Can refund customers' ,   . A later  chapter on Django user management covers the topic of custom permissions.  Relationships in Django Models  Django models operate by default on relational database systems  RDBMS  and thus they also support  relationships among one another. In the simplest terms, database relationships are used to associate records  on the basis of a key or id, resulting in improved data maintenance, query performance, and less duplicate  data, among other things.  Django models support the same three relationships supported by relational database systems: one to   many, many to manym and one to one.  310   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  One to Many Relationships in Django Models A one to many relationship implies that one model record can have many other model records associated  with itself. For example, a Menu model record can have many Item model records associated with it and yet  an Item belongs to a single Menu record. To define a one to many relationship in Django models you use  the ForeignKey data type on the model that has the many records  e.g., on the Item model . Listing 7-22  illustrates a sample of a one to many Django relationship.  Listing 7-22.  One to many Django model relationship  from django.db import models  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100   The first Django model in Listing 7-22 is Menu and has the name field  e.g., Menu instances can be   Breakfast, Lunch, Drinks, etc. . Next, in Listing 7-22 is the Item Django model, which has a menu field, that  itself has the models.ForeignKey Menu  definition. The models.ForeignKey   definition creates the one to  many relationship, where the first argument Menu indicates the relationship model.  In addition to the database level benefits of creating a one to many relationship  e.g., improved data   maintenance , Django models also provide an API to simplify the access of data related to this kind of  relationship, which is explained in the next chapter on CRUD records across Django model relationships.  Many to Many Relationships in Django Models A many to many relationship implies that many records can have many other records associated among  one another. For example, Store model records can have many Amenity records, just as Amenity records  can belong to many Store records. To define a many to many relationship in Django models you use the  ManyToManyField data type. Listing 7-23 illustrates a sample of a many to many Django relationship.  Listing 7-23.  Many to many Django model relationship  from django.db import models  class Amenity models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100   class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      email = models.EmailField       amenities = models.ManyToManyField Amenity,blank=True   311   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  The first Django model in Listing 7-23 is Amenity and has the name and description fields. Next, in   Listing 7-23 is the Store Django model that has the amenities field, that itself has the models.ManyToMany  Field Amenity,blank=True  definition. The models.ManyToManyField   definition creates the many  to many relationship via a junction table,5 where the first argument Amenity indicates the relationship  model and the optional blank=True argument allows a Store record to be created without the need of an  amenities value.  In this case, the junction table created by Django is used to hold the relationships between the   Amenity and Store records through their respective keys. Although you don’t need to manipulate the  junction table directly, for reference purposes, Django uses the syntax  _<model_field_with_ ManyToManyField> to name it  e.g., For Store model records stored in the stores_store table and Amenity  model records stored in the stores_amenity table, the junction table is stores_store_amenities .  In addition to the database level benefits of creating a many to many relationship  e.g., improved data   maintenance , Django models also provide an API to simplify the access of data related to this kind of  relationship, which is explained in the next chapter on CRUD records across Django model relationships.  One to One Relationships in Django Models A one to one relationship implies that one record is associated with another record. If you’re familiar with  object-oriented programming, a one to one relationship in RDBMS is similar to object-oriented inheritance  that uses the is a rule  e.g., a Car object is a Vehicle object .  For example, generic Item model records can have a one to one relationship to Drink model records,  where the latter records hold information specific to drinks  e.g., caffeine content  and the former records  hold generic information about items  e.g., price . To define a one to one relationship in Django models you  use the OneToOneField data type. Listing 7-24 illustrates a sample of a one to one Django relationship.  Listing 7-24.  One to one Django model relationship  from django.db import models  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100      calories = models.IntegerField       price = models.FloatField    class Drink models.Model :     item = models.OneToOneField Item,on_delete=models.CASCADE,primary_key=True      caffeine = models.IntegerField    The first Django model in Listing 7-24 is Item, which is similar to the one presented in Listing 7-22,    except the version in Listing 7-24 has the additional calories and price fields. Next, in Listing 7-24 is the   Drink model, which has the item field, that itself has the models.OneToOneField Amenity,on_delete=  models.CASCADE,primary_key=True  definition.  5https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Associative_entity  312   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  The models.OneToOneField   definition creates the one to one relationship, where the first argument   Item indicates the relationship model. The second argument on_delete=models.CASCADE tells Django  that in case the relationship record is deleted  i.e., the Item,  its other record  i.e., the Drink  will also be  deleted; this last argument prevents orphaned data. Finally, the primary_key=True tells Django to use  the relationship id  i.e., Drink.id  as the primary key instead of using a separate and default column id, a  technique that makes it easier to track relationships.  In addition to the database level benefits of creating a one to one relationship  e.g., improved data  maintenance , Django models also provide an API to simplify the access of data related to this kind of  relationship, which is explained in the next chapter on CRUD records across Django model relationships.  Options for Relationship Model Data Types Previously you explored Django data types and the many options to customize how they handle data, such  as limiting values, allowing empty and null values, establishing predetermined values, and enforcing DDL  rules. In this section you’ll learn about the options available for Django relationship model data types.   options described in the general purpose model data type section  e.g., blank, unique  are applicable      Note  to relationship model data types unless noted.  Data integrity options: on_delete All model relationships create dependencies between one another, so an important behavior to define is  what happens to the other party when one party is removed. The on_delete option is designed for this  purpose, to determine what to do with records on the other side of a relationship when one side is removed.  For example, if an Item model has a menu ForeignKey   field pointing to a Menu model  i.e., like    Listing 7-22, a one to many relationship: an Item always belong to one Menu, and a Menu has many Items ,  what happens to Item model records if their related Menu model instance is deleted? Are the Item model  records also deleted?  The on_delete option is available for all three relationship model data types and supports the    following values:   	   	   	   	  on_delete=models.CASCADE  Default .- Automatically deletes related records when  the related instance is removed  e.g. if the Menu Breakfast instance is deleted, all Item  records referencing the Menu Breakfast instance are also deleted .  on_delete=models.PROTECT.- Prevents a related instance from being removed  e.g.  if the menu field on Item uses ForeignKey Menu,on_delete=models.PROTECT , any  attempt to remove Menu instances referenced by Item instances are blocked .  on_delete=models.SET_NULL.- Assigns NULL to related records when the related  instance is removed, note this requires the field to also use the null=True option   e.g. if the Menu Breakfast instance is deleted, all Item records referencing the Menu  Breakfast instance are assigned NULL to their menu field value .  on_delete=models.SET_DEFAULT.- Assigns a default value to related records when the  related instance is removed, note this requires the field to also use a default option  value  e.g., if the Menu Breakfast instance is deleted, all Item records referencing the  Menu Breakfast instance are assigned a default Menu instance to their menu field value .  313   Chapter 7   Django MoDels   	   	  on_delete=models.SET.- Assigns a value set through a callable to related records  when the related instance is removed  e.g., if the Menu Breakfast instance is deleted,  all Item records referencing the Menu Breakfast instance are assigned an instance to  their menu field value set through a callable function .  on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING.- No action is taken when related records are  removed. This is generally a bad relational database practice, so by default,  databases will generate an error since you’re leaving orphaned records with no  value, null or otherwise. If you use this value, you must ensure the database table  does not enforce referential integrity.  Reference options: Self, literal strings, and parent_link Model relationships sometimes have recursive relationships. This is a common scenario in one to many  relationship models with parent-child relationships. For example, a Category model can have a parent field  that in itself is another Category model or a Person model can have a relatives field that in itself are other  Person models. To define this type of relationship you must use the 'self' keyword to reference the same  model, as shown in Listing 7-25.  Listing 7-25.  One to many Django model relationship with self-referencing model  from django.db import models  class Category models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey 'self'   class Person models.Model :     relatives = models.ManyToManyField 'self'   Although model relationship data types typically express their relationships through model object   references  e.g., models.ForeignKey Menu  , it’s also valid to use literal strings to reference models    e.g., models.ForeignKey 'Menu'  . This technique is helpful when the model definition order does not  allow you to reference model objects that are not yet in scope and is a technique often referred to as model  ‘lazy-loading’.  The parent_link=True option is an exclusive option for one to one relationships  i.e., the models.  OneToOneField data type  used when inheriting model classes, to help indicate the child class field should  be used as a link to the parent class.  Reverse relationships: related_name, related_query_name, and symmetrical When you use relationship model data types, Django automatically establishes the reverse relationship  between data types with the _set reference. This mechanism is illustrated in Listing 7-26.  Listing 7-26.  One to many Django model relationship with reverse relationship references  from django.db import models  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE   314   Chapter 7   Django MoDels      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100      price = models.FloatField blank=True,null=True   breakfast = Menu.objects.get name='Breakfast'   Direct access all_items_with_breakfast_menu = Item.objects.filter menu=breakfast    Reverse access through instance same_all_items_with_breakfast_menu = breakfast.item_set.all    As you can see in Listing 7-26, there are two routes between a Django relationship. The direct   route involves using the model with the relationship definition; in this case, Item gets all the Item   records with a Menu Breakfast instance. To do this, you use Item and filter on the menu ForeignKey   reference  e.g., Item.objects.filter menu=breakfast  .  But it’s also possible to use a Menu instance  e.g., breakfast in Listing 7-26  and get all Item records   with a menu instance; this is called a reverse relationship or path. As you can see in Listing 7-26, the reverse  relationship uses the  . _set syntax  e.g., breakfast.item_set.all   to  get all Item records with a the breakfast instance .Now that you know what a reverse relationship is, let’s  explore the options associated with this term.  The related_name option allows you to customize the name or disable a reverse model relationship.   Renaming a reverse relationship provides more intuitive syntax over the _set syntax from Listing 7-26,  whereas disabling a reverse relationship is helpful when a related model is used in other contexts and  blocking access to a reverse relationship is required for accessibility reasons.  For example, in Listing 7-26 the reverse relationship uses the breakfast.item_set.all   syntax,  but if you change the field to models.ForeignKey ...related_name='menus' , you can use the reverse  relationship breakfast.menus.all   syntax. To disable a reverse relationship you can use the +  plus sign   on the related_name value  e.g., models.ForeignKey ...related_name='+'  .  Reverse relationships are also available as part of queries, as illustrated in Listing 7-27.  Listing 7-27.  One to many Django model relationship with reverse relationship queries   Based on models from listing 7-26   Direct access, Item records with price higher than 1 Items.objects.filter price__gt=1    Reverse access query, Menu records with Item price higher than 1 Menu.objects.filter item__price__gt=1   Notice how the Menu query in Listing 7-27 uses the item reference to filter all Menu records via its Item  relationship. By default, reverse relationship queries use the name of the model, so in this case, the related  Menu model is Item; therefore the query field is item. However, if you define the related_name option on a  field this value takes precedence. For example, with models.ForeignKey ...related_name='menus'  the  reverse query in Listing 7-27 becomes Menu.objects.filter menus__price__gt=1 , all of which takes us to  the related_query_name option.  The related_query_name option is used to override the related_name option value for cases where you   want the reverse query to have a different field value. For example, with models.ForeignKey ...related_ name='menus',related_query_name='onlyitemswith'  the reverse relationship reference for menus in  Listing 7-26 would still work, but the reverse relationship query from Listing 7-27 would change to Menu. objects.filter onlyitemswith__price__gt=1 .  315   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Covering an edge-case for many to many relationships is the symmetrical option. If you create a many   to many relationships that references itself – as illustrated in Listing 7-25 with the 'self' syntax – Django  assumes the relationship is symmetrical  e.g., all Person instances are relatives and therefore requires no  reverse relationships since it would be redundant  thus self-referencing many to many relationships forgo  adding a _set reverse relationship to the field. You can use symmetrical=False to force Django to maintain  the reverse relationship.     Tip    the next chapter covers Django model relationship queries in greater detail.  Database options: to_field, db_constraint, swappable, through,   through_fields, and db_table By default, Django model relationships are established on the primary key of a model, which, in itself,  defaults to a model’s id field. For example, the field menu = models.ForeignKey Menu  stores the id from  a Menu instance as the relationship reference. You can override this default behavior with the to_field  option and specify a different field on which to establish the relationship reference. Note that if you assign a  to_field value, this field must be set with unique=True.  By default, Django follows relational database conventions and constrains relationships at the database  level. The db_constraint option – which defaults to True – allows you to bypass this constraint by assigning  it a False value. Setting db_constraint=False should only by used when you know beforehand the data  relationships in a database is broken and doesn’t require constraint checking at database level.  The swappable option is intended to influence migrations for models that contain relationships   and are swappable with other models. Unless you implement a very sophisticated model hierarchy with  model swapping features, this option is primarily intended for Django’s built-in User model, which uses a  relationship and is often swapped out for custom user models. The chapter on user management contains  more details on this option.  Specific to many to many model relationships  i.e., the models.ManyToManyField data type  the   through, through_fields & db_table options, influence the junction table used in these types of  relationships. If you want to change the default name for a many to many junction table, you can use the  db_table option to specify a custom junction table name.  By default, a junction table for a many to many relationship stores a minimum amount of information:  an id for the relationship and the id’s for each of the model relationships. It’s possible to specify a separate  model to operate as a junction table and store additional information about the many to many relationship   e.g., through=MyCustomModel uses the MyCustomTable model as the many to many junction table . If you  define a through option, then it’s also necessary to use the through_fields to tell Django which fields in the  new model are used to store references for the model relationships.  Form values: limit_choices_to When Django models with relationships are used in the context of forms, it can be useful and even necessary  to delimit the amount of displayed relationships. For example, if you use an Item model with a relationship  to a Menu model, displaying the entire set of Item records as forms  e.g., in the Django admin  can be  impractical if you have hundreds of Item records.  The limit_choices_to can be used on a relationship model type to filter the amount of displayed   records in forms. The limit_choices_to can declare an inline reference field filter  e.g., limit_choices_ to={'in_stock':True}  or a callable that performs more complex logic  e.g., limit_choices_to=my_ complex_method_limit_picker .  316   Chapter 7   Django MoDels     Tip    the next chapter covers Django model forms in greater detail.  Django Model Transactions  Transactions play an important role in the integrity of model data operations. When you set up a database  for a Django project back in Chapter 1, among the many default options described in Table 1-3, were the  following transaction-related settings:  AUTOCOMMIT = True ATOMIC_REQUESTS = False  The AUTOCOMMIT option set to True ensures all operations that alter data  i.e., Create, Update, and Delete    run in their own transaction, and depending on the outcome, are automatically committed to a database if  successful or rolled back if they fail. The AUTOCOMMIT=True settings fits the expectations of most applications,  as it cuts down on the need to explicitly mark operations final and provides reasonable behaviors  i.e., if the  data operation is successful it’s made final [a.k.a. commit], if not, then it’s reverted [a.k.a. rolled back] .  However, there are occasions when grouping operations that alter data into larger transactions – all-or-  nothing tasks – is a necessity.   If you set aUtoCoMMIt = False you’ll need to explicitly declare commits. a more practical choice is to      Tip  leave the default aUtoCoMMIt = true and declare larger transactions explicitly on a case-by-case basis.  Transaction per Request: ATOMIC_REQUESTS and Decorators Django supports the ATOMIC_REQUESTS option that is disabled by default. The ATOMIC_REQUEST is used to open  a transaction on every request made to a Django application. By setting ATOMIC_REQUEST=True, it ensures the  data operations included in a request  i.e., view method  are committed only if a response is successful.  Django atomic requests are helpful when you want the logic in a view method to be an all-or-nothing   task. For example, if a view method executes fives subtasks associated with data  e.g., credit card verification  procedure, sending an email , it can be helpful to ensure that only if all subtasks are successful the data  operations be considered final, and if only one subtasks fails, then all subtasks are rolled back as if nothing  had happened.  Since ATOMIC_REQUEST=True opens a transaction for every request made on a Django application, it can   cause a performance impact on high-traffic applications. Due to this factor, it’s also possible to selectively  disable atomic requests on certain requests when ATOMIC_REQUEST=True or inclusively selectively enable  atomic requests on certain requests when ATOMIC_REQUEST=False. Listing 7-28 illustrates how to selectively  activate and deactivate atomic requests.  Listing 7-28.  Selectively activate and deactivate atomic requests with @non_atomic_requests and @atomic  from django.db import transaction   When ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True you can individually disable atomic requests  @transaction.non_atomic_requests def index request :      Data operations with transactions commit rollback individually  317   Chapter 7   Django MoDels       Failure of one operation does not influence other     data_operation_1       data_operation_2       data_operation_3     When ATOMIC_REQUESTS=False you can individually enable atomic requests  @transaction.atomic def detail request :      Start transaction.      Failure of any operation, rollbacks other operations     data_operation_1       data_operation_2       data_operation_3        Commit transaction if all operation successful  As you can see in Listing 7-28, if you decide to use ATOMIC_REQUESTS=True, you can disable   transactions per request on a view method with the @transaction.non_atomic_requests decorator from  the django.db.transaction package. If you decide to keep the default ATOMIC_REQUESTS=False, you can  enable transactions per request on a view method with the @transaction.atomic decorator from the same  django.db.transaction package.  Context Manager and Callbacks: atomic   and on_commit   In addition to the AUTOCOMMIT and ATOMIC_REQUEST transaction configurations, as well as the view method  transaction decorators, it’s possible to manage transactions at an intermediate scope. That is, coarser  transactions than individual data operations  e.g., save   , but finer transactions than atomic requests  i.e.,  view methods .  The Python with keyword can invoke a context manager6 charged with managing transactions. Context  managers for transactions use the same django.db.transaction.atomic   method – used as a decorator in  Listing 7-28 – but inside the body of a method, as illustrated in Listing 7-29.  Listing 7-29.  Transactions with context managers  from django.db import transaction  def login request :      With AUTO_COMMIT=True and ATOMIC_REQUEST=False      Data operation runs in its own transaction due to AUTO_COMMIT=True     data_operation_standalone         Open new transaction with context manager     with transaction.atomic  :          Start transaction.          Failure of any operation, rollbacks other operations  6https:  docs.python.org 3 reference datamodel.htmlcontext-managers  318   Chapter 7   Django MoDels          data_operation_1           data_operation_2           data_operation_3            Commit transaction if all operation successful       Data operation runs in its own transaction due to AUTO_COMMIT=True     data_operation_standalone2    As you can see in Listing 7-29, it’s possible to generate a transaction inside a method without   influencing its entire scope vs. atomic requests which run on the entire view method scope. In addition,  Django transactions also support callbacks, where by you can run a task once a transaction is successful    i.e., it’s committed .  Callbacks are supported through the on_commit   method, which is also part the django.  db.transaction package. The syntax for the on_commit   method is the following:  transaction.on_commit only_after_success_operation   transaction.on_commit lambda: only_after_success_with_args 'success'    The argument to on_commit   method can be either a non-argument function to run after a successful  transaction or a function wrapped in a lambda statement if the function to run after a successful transaction  requires arguments.  The transaction.on_commit   method is triggered once the transaction in which the method was   declared is successful. If the transaction running at the point where the transaction.on_commit   method  is declared fails, the on_commit   callback is never called. If there’s no transaction running at the point  where the transaction.on_commit   method is declared, the on_commit   callback is trigged immediately.   Use commit=False on a model’s save   method – described in table 7-3 – to avoid a transaction       Tip   i.e., write operation  and still create a model object in memory.  Django Model Migrations  At the start of this chapter you learned how Django models are closely tied to the migrations. Recapping, the  migrations consists of registering the evolution of Django models in an app’s models.py file into ‘migration  files’, with the purpose of later reviewing and applying these models.py changes to a database.  In essence, migration files serve as a buffer between a database and the changes made to a Django  project’s models defined in models.py files. With data being such a delicate piece of a project, migration  files provide highly desirable functionalities, such as the ability to preview database change before they’re  committed  e.g., sqlmigrate in Listing 7-4  and also the ability to go back to a certain point in time in a  models.py file state, reverting what are generally complex DDL structure changes.  Migration File Creation The manage.py makemigrations command is the entry point to create migration files. If you execute this  command without arguments, Django inspects all the models.py files for apps declared in the INSTALLED_ APPS variable and creates a migration file for apps whose models.py contents has changed from prior  migrations. Table 7-4 describes the most common makemigrations arguments and their purpose.  319   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Table 7-4.  Django most-used makemigrations arguments  Description  Argument     --dry-run --empty  --merge  --name 'my_migration_file' Creates a migration file a custom name, instead of the default   Indicates a specific app’s models.py file  e.g., manage.py makemigrations  stores, only inspects creates migrations for the models.py in the stores app . Simulates migration creation without creating the actual migration files. Creates an empty migration file, irrespective of the models.py file being  changed or not.  'auto_ . Note the leading serial number used for migration  files  e.g., 0001, 0002  is not customized, as this is a best practice to identify  migration order.  Creates a merged migration from two conflicting migration files. Required  when multiple serial number files are present in the same app  e.g., 0002_ unique_constraints.py, 0002_field_update.py , generally due to multiple  people creating a duplicate serial numbers  e.g., when you try to make a  migration in these circumstances, Django throws the error 'Conflicting  migrations detected', suggesting you use -merge to fix the problem .  As you can see in Table 7-4, the makemigrations command offers multiple ways to create migration   files. You can create empty migration files, you can simulate the creation of migration files to inspect changes  first, and you can also create migration files with a specific name, among other things.     Tip   remember you can use the sqlmigrate command to preview the sQl generated by a migration file  and the migrate command to apply the migration file to a database. see the first section in this chapter for  additional examples of model migration commands.  Migration File Renaming Migration files are not set in stone, so it’s possible to rename migration files. What steps you need to take to  rename a migration file, depend on whether a migration has been applied to a database or not. To determine  the state of a migration file with respect to a database, execute the python manage.py showmigrations, and  if a migration file has an X beside it, it means it has been applied to the database.  For migrations that haven’t been applied to the database, you can rename a migration file directly in   the migrations folder to a more descriptive name. At this point, the migration file is just a representation of  model changes that no one else knows about, so you can even delete the migration file if needed.     Caution  confusion regarding migration file order.   Migration files should always maintain the serial number prefix  e.g., 0001, 0002  since it reduces   320   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  For migrations that have been applied to a database you have two alternatives. The first option is to   rename the migration file, alter the database table that holds the migration activity to reflect this new name,  and update other migration file dependencies  if any  to also reflect this new name. Once you rename the  migration file inside the migrations folder, access the django_migrations database table, and look for the  record with the old migration file name and update it to the reflect the new migration name. Next, if there’s  a newer migration file than the one you’re renaming, the newer migration file will have a dependencies  statement – described in the migration file structure section – that must be updated with the new name. The second alternative is to roll back to a migration prior to the migration file you want to rename,  at which point you can simply rename the migration file – as an unapplied database migration file – and  then reapply the migration process back to the most recent migration file. An upcoming section describes  migration file rollback in greater detail.  Migration File Squashing A models.py files that undergoes many changes can generate dozens or even hundreds of migrations files.  In these circumstances, it’s possible to squash multiple migration files into a single migration file to simplify  file migration management. Note the term 'squash' is used vs. the more technically accurate term 'merge',  because migration file merging refers to conflicting migration files, see the --merge option in Table 7-4.  The manage.py squashmigrations command is designed to squash multiple migration files, and its   syntax is the following:  manage.py squashmigrations      As you can see, the squashmigrations command requires you specify both the app on which you   want to squash migration files, as well as the migration serial number up to which you want to squash    e.g., squashmigrations stores 0004, generates a single migration file for the stores app from the  migration files 0001, 0002, 0003,and 0004 .  The squashmigrations command also supports an additional positional argument to change the start   of the squashing process from the default 0001  e.g., squashmigrations stores 0002 0004, generates a  single migration file from the migration files 0002, 0003, and 0004   Like all file merging mechanisms, there’s always a possibility squashmigrations may not be able to  produce automatic results, in which case it generates the message 'Manual porting required', where it’s  necessary to manually edit the squashed migration file  e.g., just like it can happen with other file merging  conflict operations in platforms like git .  Squashed migration files follow the naming convention:   _squashed_ _ .py  You can rename squashed migration file just like regular migration files; just follow the same steps   described in the previous section, depending on whether the squashed migration file has been applied to a  database or not.  Squashed migration files take over the duties of un-squashed migration files. You can keep the old     un-squashed  migration files as long as you want, but they only continue to serve a purpose until the squashed  migration file is applied to a database. Behind the scenes, squashed migration files use the replaces migration  field – described in the next section – to indicate which migration files it replaces. Therefore once you apply a  squashed migration file to a database, the migration files in replaces are ignored.  321   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Migration File Structure Although migration files are automatically created based on the changes made to models.py files vs. the  prior migration files belonging to the same models.py files, this doesn’t mean you can’t or won’t have  to change the internal structure of migration files. Listing 7-30 illustrates the basic structure of a Django  migration file.  Listing 7-30.  Django migration file basic structure  from django.db import migrations, models  class Migration migrations.Migration :      initial = True      replaces = [     ]      dependencies = [     ]      operations = [     ]  First, notice in Listing 7-30 all migration files include a class named Migration that inherits its behavior  from django.db.migrations.Migration. This allows migrations to automatically receive a series of default  behaviors, similar to how Django model classes inherit their behavior from the django.db.models.Model class.  Inside each Migration class are a series of fields that determine the actions of the migration file. The  initial field is a Boolean value present on the initial migration file for every app  i.e., migration files with  the 0001 serial number . The replaces field is a list field used by squashed migration files to declare which  migration files it replaces, a value that is automatically populated when you create a squashing migration file.  The dependencies and operations fields are by far the two most common fields in migrations files.  Although they’re automatically populated once a migration file is created – just like other migration file  fields – these two fields are the ones you’re most likely to change if you require adjusting the logic executed  by a migration file.  The dependencies field is a list of tuples with the  ' ',' '  syntax, where  each tuple represents a migration dependency. For example, by default the second migration file for an app  named about contains the following dependencies value:  dependencies = [      'about', '0001_initial' , ]  This tells Django the migration file depends on the execution of the migration file 0001_initial in the   about app, ensuring this last migration file is run first.  The most common scenario for editing the dependencies field is to add inter-app migration file   dependencies. For example, if the online app depends on data from the stores app created by its 0002_ data_population migration file, you can add a dependency tuple to the online app’s first migration file to  ensure it’s run after the stores migration files  e.g.,  'stores', '0002_data_population'  .  322   Chapter 7   Django MoDels   to reference the first migration file in an app you can use the __first__ reference  e.g.,  'stores',      Tip  '__first__'  , to reference the last migration file in an app you can use the __latest__ reference  e.g.,  'stores',  '__latest__'  .  The operations field declares a list of migration operations.7 Migration operations include all   database-related tasks performed by migrations. If you were wondering how Django generates the DDL to  create, delete, alter, or rename the database table behind a model, it’s all based on migration operations. For most cases, Django generates the migration operations based on the changes made to models in    a models.py file. For example, if you add a new model, the next migration file includes a django.db.  migrations.operations.CreateModel   migration operation; if you rename a model in the models.py, the  next migration file includes a RenameModel   operation from the same django.db.migrations.operations  package; this same mechanism occurs when you change a model field  AlterModel   , add an index   AddIndex    and perform all the other modifications possible to models in a models.py file.  The most common scenario for editing the operations field in a migration file is to add non-DDL   operations  e.g., SQL DML- Data Manipulation Language  which can’t be reflected as part of model changes.  For example, you can insert SQL queries as part of a migration file through the RunSQL migration operation and  you can also run Python logic as part of a migration file through the RunPython migration operation. The section  “Django Model Initial Data Setup” describes how to use the RunSQL and RunPython migration operations.  Migration File Rollback Reverting a database to a previous state of a Django model can be done by rolling back migration files.  Reverting a database to a previous migration file is as simple as passing an additional argument to the same  migrate command that applies migration files. For example, the migrate stores 0001 statement tells  Django to migrate the stores app to the 0001 migration file, if the app’s database state is in a more recent  migration file  e.g., 0004 , Django rolls back migration files until the database reflects the 0001 migration file.  But as simple as the migration file rollback command is, the actual rollback process is anything but   simple. Since migration files can contain multiple DDL and DML operations – as described in the previous  section – there are certain migration operations that are considered irreversible. This means once a  migration is applied, Django can’t determine with certainty how to undo it.  When a rollback is attempted on a migration with an irreversible operation, Django throws the error   django.db.migrations.exceptions.IrreversibleError. Of course, irreversible does not mean impossible,  but it does mean additional work to make a migration file reversible.  Most irreversible migration operations happen on DDL migration operations  e.g., RunSQL, RunPython    where you execute certain logic as part of the migration file. To make these types of migration operations  reversible, you must equally provide the logic to revert the logic applied as part of the migration file. The  section “Django Model Initial Data Setup” describes how to create reverse operations for the RunSQL and  RunPython migration operations.  Django Model Database Tasks  Django is equipped to execute database-level tasks on Django models that are often done by database tools.  A Django project’s manage.py command offers several management subcommands for tasks like backing  up, loading, and deleting data from database tables linked to Django models, as well as re-creating Django  models from database tables and issuing interactive commands to a database.  7https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref migration-operations   323   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Backup Data: Fixtures, dumpdata, loaddata, and inspectdb The dumpdata and loaddata commands are Django’s data backup and loading tools, similar to native tools  included in databases  e.g., MySQL mysqldump, Postgres pg_dump .  Django uses the term fixture to refer to the data structures created and used by the dumpdata and   loaddata commands. Because Django fixtures are designed for Django model instance data, their structure  is based on formats that better describe this type of data. By default, Django fixtures use the JSON  JavaScript  Object Notation  format, but it’s also possible to create fixtures in XML and YAML.  The dumpdata command outputs database table data linked Django models. It accepts a wide array of   options, the most common of which are described in the following examples:   	   	   	   	  manage.py dumpdata > all_model_data.json.- Outputs data for all project models  and places it in the all_model_data.json file.  manage.py dumpdata stores --format xml.- Outputs data for all models in the  stores app in XML.  manage.py dumpdata about.contact --indent=2.- Outputs data for the Contact  model in the about app with two space indentation -- the indentation makes the  output more readable.  manage.py dumpdata items.menu –pk=1,2,3 --format yaml.- Outputs the Menu  model records with primary keys  i.e., id values  1,2,3 from the items app in a  YAML format.     Note    to output YaMl you need the pyYaMl package  e.g., pip install pyYaMl .  The manage.py loaddata command is designed to load fixture files produced by dumpdata. This means   invoking loaddata is as simple as executing manage.py loaddata  . The loaddata  command can accept relative or absolute paths to fixture files, but in addition, it also searches for fixture  files in the fixtures folder inside apps. The next section on “Django Model Initial Data Setup” describes the  procedure to use fixtures in apps.  The most important variation for the manage.py loaddata command are that it can accept multiple   fixture files as arguments  e.g., loaddata  ,  ,   , which is necessary if  fixture files have interdependencies; and it can restrict the searching loading of fixtures to certain apps  e.g.,  manage.py loaddata menu --app items, searches loads a fixture file named menu, but only inside the items  app, specifically inside its fixtures folder .  The manage.py inspectdb is a reverse-engineering process that outputs Django models generated   from database tables. Note the manage.py inspectdb outputs a single stream of model classes, so it requires  rearranging the output if the model classes are to be placed in different models.py files.  Delete Data: Flush, sqlflush, and sqlsequencereset Django also offers the flush and sqlflush commands to delete the contents of database tables linked to  Django models. The manage.py flush command triggers the actual deleting process, whereas manage.py   sqlflush outputs the SQL required to delete all data in Django model database tables  i.e., the logic  triggered by flush .  The manage.py sqlsequenereset command outputs the required SQL to reset logic used by database  sequences of a given app  e.g., manage.py sqlsequencereset stores to output the SQL necessary to reset  the sequences used by models in the stores app . Sequences are used by databases to give automatically  incrementing values to certain Django models fields  e.g., id field , and this command is used to fix issues  when sequence values become out of sync. 324   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Interact with Data: dbshell Sometimes the need to connect directly to a database linked to a Django project can become inevitable in  order to perform a complex task or query. The manage.py dbshell command is designed to connect to a  Django project’s database using the credentials in a Django projects settings.py file, in turn, avoiding the  need to type in credentials to access a database.  Depending on the database brand you’re using, the dbshell command opens an interactive command-  line shell to the built-in tool for each database brand: for PostgreSQL to the dpsql environment, for  MySQL to the mysql environment, for SQLite to the sqlite3 environment, and for Oracle to the sqlplus  environment.  Django Model Initial Data Setup  On many occasions it can be helpful or necessary to load a set of predefined data records on a Django  model. Django allows you to load predefined records by either hard-coding them in Python; using a  standard SQL script with SQL statements; or using a fixture file, which is a Django export import format  described in the previous section.  The first step to load a set of predefined data records is to generate an empty migration file to handle the   actual data loading process. Listing 7-31 illustrates how to generate an empty migration file.  Listing 7-31.  Create empty Django migration file to load initial data for Django model  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py makemigrations --empty stores Migrations for 'stores':   0002_auto_20180124_0507.py:  As you can see in Listing 7-31, Django creates the empty migration file 0002_auto_20180124_0507.py   for the stores app. At this point, you can easily rename the migration file as described in the previous section.  Once you have an empty Django migration, let’s explore the different ways to modify it to set up initial data  for a Django model.  Hard-code predefined records in Python migration file The simplest approach to set up initial data is to hard-code the set of predefined data records and make  it part of the migration file itself. Listing 7-32 illustrates a modified migration file with hard-coded model  objects to load into a database.  Listing 7-32.  Load initial data with hard-coded data in Django migration file   -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  from django.db import models, migrations  def load_stores apps, schema_editor :     Store = apps.get_model "stores", "Store"      store_corporate =  Store id=0,name='Corporate',address='624 Broadway',city='San Diego',       store_corporate.save       store_downtown =  Store id=1,name='Downtown',address='Horton Plaza',city='San Diego',   state='CA',email='corporate@coffeehouse.com'   state='CA',email='downtown@coffeehouse.com'   325   Chapter 7   Django MoDels      store_downtown.save       store_uptown =  Store id=2,name='Uptown',address='1240 University Ave',city='San   Diego',state='CA',email='uptown@coffeehouse.com'       store_uptown.save       store_midtown =  Store id=3,name='Midtown',address='784 W Washington St',city='San    Diego',state='CA',email='midtown@coffeehouse.com'       store_midtown.save    def delete_stores apps, schema_editor :     Store = apps.get_model "stores", "Store"      Store.objects.all  .delete    class Migration migrations.Migration :      dependencies = [          'stores', '0001_initial' ,     ]      operations = [         migrations.RunPython load_stores,delete_stores ,     ]  The first thing that's added to the empty migration file is the migrations.RunPython load_  stores,delete_stored  line in the operations[] list. The RunPython method runs Python code and its first  argument indicates to run the load_stores method, the second argument – which is optional – is called  the reverse code and is run when rolling back migrations – which is mentioned in the previous section on  “Migration File Rollback.”  The load_stores method in Listing 7-32 contains the hard-coded data records. This method first   gets a reference of the Store model and then creates three different instances, which are then saved to the  database. The delete_stores method does the opposite of the load_stores method – as its purpose is to  roll back the applied data – deleting Store instances.  Once you make the additions illustrated in Listing 7-32 to an empty migration file, you just need to   trigger the migration with the migrate command to load data into the database.  SQL script with SQL statements On other occasions you may already have a set of predefined records in an SQL script to populate a database  table. Listing 7-33 illustrates a sample SQL script to populate the table associated with the Store model.  Listing 7-33.  SQL script with SQL statements  INSERT INTO stores_store  id,name,address,city,state,email  VALUES  0,'Corporate','624  Broadway','San Diego','CA','corporate@coffeehouse.com' ; INSERT INTO stores_store  id,name,address,city,state,email  VALUES  1,'Downtown','Horton  Plaza','San Diego','CA','downtown@coffeehouse.com' ; INSERT INTO stores_store  id,name,address,city,state,email  VALUES  2,'Uptown','1240  University Ave','San Diego','CA','uptown@coffeehouse.com' ; INSERT INTO stores_store  id,name,address,city,state,email  VALUES  3,'Midtown','784 W  Washington St','San Diego','CA','midtown@coffeehouse.com' ;  326   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  By convention, Django names SQL scripts after the Django model its storing data for and places the SQL  scripts in a subfolder named sql inside the app where the models are. For example, the contents of Listing 7-33  are for the Store model in the stores app and therefore would be placed in the project folder stores sql  store.sql. Once you have an SQL script inside a Django project's directory structure, you can set it up as the  initial data for a Django model. Listing 7-34 illustrates a modified migration file to load data from the SQL  script in Listing 7-33 into a database.  Listing 7-34.  Load initial data with SQL script in Django migration file   -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  from django.db import models, migrations  def load_stores_from_sql  :     from coffeehouse.settings import PROJECT_DIR     import os     sql_statements = open os.path.join PROJECT_DIR,'stores sql store.sql' , 'r' .read       return sql_statements  def delete_stores_with_sql  :     return 'DELETE from stores_store;'  class Migration migrations.Migration :      dependencies = [          'stores', '0001_initial' ,     ]      operations = [         migrations.RunSQL load_stores_from_sql  , delete_stores_with_sql   ,     ]   the runsQl method used to load sQl statements relies on the sqlparse package. so if you plan to      Note  use this functionality you need to install this package  e.g., pip install sqlparse .  The first thing that's added to the empty migration file is the migrations.RunSQL load_stores_from_  sql  ,delete_stores_with_sql    line in the operations[] list. The RunSQL method runs SQL statements,  and its first argument indicates to run the load_stores method, the second argument – which is   optional – is called the reverse code and is run when rolling back migrations – described in the previous  section on “Migration File Rollback.”  The load_stores_from_sql method in Listing 7-34 reads the contents of the SQL script from a relative   path in the main project directory at stores sql store.sql and returns the SQL statements in the file. In this  case, the relative path is provided by the PROJECT_DIR variable defined in a Django project's settings.py file  and the SQL script is read using Python's standard open method. The delete_stores_from_sql method does  the opposite of the load_stores_from_sql method – as its purpose is to roll back the applied data – deleting  Store instances.  Once you make the additions illustrated in Listing 7-34 to an empty migration file, you just need to   trigger the migration with the migrate command to load data into the database.  327   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Django fixture file Another alternative to load initial data in a Django model is through a fixture file. A fixture file is a Django- specific format used to manage the data export import of Django models, described in the previous section  on Django model database tasks. Listing 7-35 illustrates a JSON fixture file to populate the table associated  with the Store model.  Listing 7-35.  Django fixture file with JSON structure  [{   "fields": {     "city": "San Diego",     "state": "CA",     "email": "corporate@coffeehouse.com",     "name": "Corporate",     "address": "624 Broadway"   },   "model": "stores.store",   "pk": 0 }, {   "fields": {     "city": "San Diego",     "state": "CA",     "email": "downtown@coffeehouse.com",     "name": "Downtown",     "address": "Horton Plaza"   },   "model": "stores.store",   "pk": 1 }]     Tip    Use dumpdata to generate fixture files, as described in the section “Model Database tasks.”  By convention, Django names fixture files after the Django model its stores data for and place fixture  files in a subfolder named fixtures inside the app where a model is located. For example, the contents of  Listing 7-35 are for the Store model in the stores app; therefore they’re placed in the project folder stores  fixtures store.json. Once you have a fixture file inside a Django project's directory structure, you can take  the next step to set it up as the initial data for a Django model.  Listing 7-36 illustrates a modified migration file to load data from the fixture file in Listing 7-35 into a   database.  Listing 7-36.  Load initial data from Django fixture file in Django migration file   -*- coding: utf-8 -*- from __future__ import unicode_literals  from django.db import models, migrations  328   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  def load_stores_from_fixture apps, schema_editor :     from django.core.management import call_command     call_command "loaddata", "store"   def delete_stores apps, schema_editor :     Store = apps.get_model "stores", "Store"      Store.objects.all  .delete    class Migration migrations.Migration :      dependencies = [          'stores', '0001_initial' ,     ]      operations = [         migrations.RunPython load_stores_from_fixture,delete_stores ,     ]  The first thing that's added to the empty migration file is the migrations.RunPython load_stores_  from_fixture,,delete_stores  line in the operations[] list. The RunPython method runs Python code as  previously described in Listing 7-32.  The load_stores_from_fixture method in Listing 7-36 uses the call_command method to load the   fixture file by simulating the command-line execution of the manage.py loaddata command. The loaddata  command requires an additional argument to search for the fixture file in a specific app. In this case, the  argument store tells Django to look for a fixture files named store in all the fixtures subdirectories for all  apps. Note the RunPython   also uses a reverse code aegument – as it was done in Listing 7-32 – to be able to  roll back the loading of fixture data.  Once you make the additions illustrated in Listing 7-36 to an empty migration file, you just need to   trigger the migration with the migrate command to load data into the database.  Django Model Signals  As you’ve learned throughout this chapter, Django models have a series of methods you can override to  provide custom functionalities. For example, you can create a custom save   or __init__ method, so  Django executes custom logic when saving or initializing a Django model instance, respectively.  While this ability provides a wide array of possibilities to execute custom logic at certain points in   the life cycle of a Django model instance  e.g., create an audit trail if the delete   method is called on an  instance , there are cases that require executing custom logic when an event happens in the life cycle of  another model instance. For example, updating an Item model’s stock value when an Order model instance  is saved or generating a Customer model instance each time a Contact model instance is updated.  These scenarios create an interesting implementation problem. One approach is to interconnect   the logic between two model classes to fulfill this type of logic  e.g., every time an Order object is saved,  update related Item objects . This last approach though can become overly complex with more demanding  requirements, because dependent classes need to be updated to perform actions on behalf of other classes.  This type problem only grows in complexity once you confront the need to execute actions on classes you  have no control over  e.g., how do you trigger a custom action when an instance of the built-in django. contrib.auth.User model class is saved? .  329   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  It turns out this scenario to trigger actions on behalf of other classes is so common in software, there’s  a name for it: the observer pattern.8 The Django framework supports the observer pattern through Django  signals.  In the simplest terms, signals are emitted by Django models into the project environment, just like   airplanes emit signals into the environment. Similarly, all you need to intercept signals is create the  appropriate receiver to intercept such signals  e.g., a receiver to detect the save signal for all project models,  a receiver to detect the delete signal for a specific model  and execute whatever custom logic it is you need to  run whenever the signal surfaces.  Built-In Django Model Signals By default, all Django models emit signals for their most important workflow events. This is a very important  fact for the sole reason it provides a noninvasive way to link into the events of any Django model. Note the  emphasis on any Django model, meaning your project models, third-party app models and even Django  built-in models, this is possible because signals are baked into the core django.db.models.Model class used  by all Django models. Table 7-5 illustrates the various signals built in to Django models.   Django also offers built-in signals for requests, responses, pre and post migrate events, and testing      Tip  events. see built-in signal reference.9  Now that you know there are always a series of signals emitted by all of your Django project models, let’s   see how to get notified of signals, in order to execute custom logic when the signal occurs.  Listen for Django Model Signals Listening for Django model signals – and Django signals in general – follows a straightforward syntax using  the @receiver decorator from the django.dispatch package, as shown in Listing 7-37.  Listing 7-37.  Basic syntax to listen for Django signals  from django.dispatch import receiver  @receiver  ,sender=   def method_with_logic_to_run_when_signal_is_emitted sender, **kwargs :        Logic when signal is emitted        Access sender & kwargs to get info on model that emitted signal  As you can in Listing 7-37, you enclose the logic you want to execute on a signal in a Python method  that follows the input signature of the signal callback; this in turn allows you to access information about  the model that emitted the signal. For most signals, the input signature sender, **kwargs fits, but this can  change depending on the signal – see the footnote reference on signals for details on the input arguments  used by each signal.  8https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Observer_pattern 9https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref signals   330   Once you have a method to run on a signal emission, the method must be decorated with the    @receiver annotation, which generally uses two arguments: a signal to listen for – those described in  Table 7-5 – which is a required argument and the optional sender argument to specify which model class to  listen into for the signal. If you want to listen for the same signal emitted by all your project’s models – a rare  case – you can omit the sender argument.  Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Table 7-5.  Built-in Django model signals  Signal s   Signal class  pre_init post_init pre_save post_save pre_delete post_delete m2m_changed  django.db.models.signals.pre_init django.db.models.signals.post_init django.db.models.signals.pre_save django.db.models.signals.post_save django.db.models.signals.pre_delete django.db.models.signals.post_delete django.db.models.signals.m2m_changed  class_prepared  django.db.models.signals.class_prepared  Description  Signal emitted at the beginning and end of  the model’s __init__   method. Signal emitted at the beginning and end of  the model’s __save__   method. Signal emitted at the beginning and end of  the model’s __delete__   method. Signal emitted when a ManyToManyField  is changed on a model instance.  Signal emmited when a model has been  defined and registered with Django’s  model system. Used internally by Django,  but rarely used for other circumstances.  Now that you have a basic understanding of the syntax used to listen for Django signals, let’s explore the   placement and configuration of signals in a Django project.  The recommended practice is to place signals in a file called signals.py under an app’s main folder     i.e., alongside models.py, views.py . This keeps signals in an obvious location, but more importantly it avoids  any potential interference  e.g., loading issues, circular references  given signals can contain logic related to  models and views. Listing 7-38 illustrates the contents of the signals.py file for an app named items.  Listing 7-38.  Listen for Django pre_save signal on Item model in signals.py  from django.dispatch import receiver  from django.db.models.signals import pre_save from django.dispatch import receiver  import logging  stdlogger = logging.getLogger __name__   @receiver pre_save, sender='items.Item'  def run_before_saving sender, **kwargs :     stdlogger.info "Start pre_save Item in signals.py under items app"      stdlogger.info "sender %s" %  sender       stdlogger.info "kwargs %s" % str kwargs    First, notice the signal listening method in Listing 7-38 uses the @receiver decorator to listen for the   pre_save signal on the Item model. This means that every time an Item model instance is about to be saved,  the method run_before_saving is triggered. In this case, a few log messages are generated, but the method  can execute any logic depending on requirements.  331   Chapter 7   Django MoDels   the sender argument in listing 7-38 uses a string model reference instead of a standard class import      Tip  reference. this ensures models in signals are lazy-loaded avoiding potential import conflicts between models  and signals.  Once you have a signals.py file with all of its signal listening methods, you must tell Django to inspect   this file to load the signal logic. The recommended practice is to do this with an import statement in the  apps.py file, which is also part of an app’s structure. Listing 7-39 illustrates a modified version of the default  apps.py to inspect the signals.py file.  Listing 7-39.  Django apps.py with custom ready   method to load signals.py  from django.apps import AppConfig  class ItemsConfig AppConfig :     name = 'coffeehouse.items'      def ready self :         import coffeehouse.items.signals  In Listing 7-39 you can see the apps.py file contains the ready   method. The ready   method, as its   name implies, is executed once the app is ready to be accessed. Inside ready   there’s an import statement  for the signals module in the same app  i.e., Listing 7-38 , which in turn makes Django load the signal  listening methods in Listing 7-38.  In addition to this change to the apps.py file to load signals, it’s also necessary to ensure the apps.py file   itself is loaded by Django. For this requirement there are two options illustrated in Listing 7-40.  Listing 7-40.  Django configuration options to load apps.py  Option 1  Declare apps.py class as part of INSTALLED_APPS  settings.py INSTALLED_APPS = [     'coffeehouse.items.apps.ItemsConfig',      ... ]  Option 2  Declare default_app_config inside the __init__ file of the app   coffeehouse items __init__.py default_app_config = 'coffeehouse.items.apps.ItemsConfig'  The first option in Listing 7-40 consists of explicitly declaring an app’s configuration class as part of   INSTALLED_APPS – in this case coffeehouse.items.apps.ItemsConfig – instead of the stand-alone package  app statement  e.g., coffeehouse.items . This last variation ensures the custom ready   method is called as  part of the initialization procedure.  The second option in Listing 7-40 consists of adding the default_app_config value to the __init__ file  of an app  i.e., the one besides the apps.py, models.py and views.py  and declaring the app’s configuration  class, in this case coffeehouse.items.apps.ItemsConfig.  The first option in Listing 7-40 is newer and supported since the introduction of the app configuration   in Django 1.9, the second is equally valid and was used prior to introduction of athe pp configuration.  332   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Emit Custom Signals in Django Model Signals In addition to the Django built-in signals presented in Table 7-5, it’s also possible to create custom signals.  Custom signals are helpful when you want to execute actions pegged to important events in the workflow of  your own models  e.g., when a store closes, when an order is created , whereas Django built-in signals let you  listen to important Django model workflow signals  e.g., before and after a model instance is saved or deleted . The first step to create custom signals is to generate a signal instance with the django.dispatch.Signal   class. The Signal class only requires the providing_args argument, which is a list of arguments that both  signal emitters and receivers expect the Signal to have. The following snippet illustrates two custom Signal  instances:  from django.dispatch import Signal  order_complete = Signal providng_args=["customer","barista"]   store_closed = Signal providing_args=["employee"]   Once you have a custom Signal instance, the next step is to add a signal emission method to trigger   a Signal instance. For Django models, the standard location is to emit signals as part of a class method, as  illustrated in Listing 7-41.  Listing 7-41.  Django model emitting custom signal  from django.db import models from coffeehouse.stores.signals import store_closed  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      ...     def closing self,employee :         store_closed.send sender=self.__class__, employee=employee   As you can see in Listing 7-41, the Store model defines a method called closing   that accepts an   employee input. Inside this closing   method, a signal is emitted to the custom Signal class named store_ closed using the send   method – inherited through Signal – which uses the arguments expected by the  custom Signal class.  Next, when you have a reference to a Store model instance and call the closing   method on any   store instance  e.g., downtown_store.closing employee=request.user   a custom store_closed signal is  emitted. And who receives this signal? Anyone who is listening for it, just like built-in Django signals. The  following snippet illustrates a signal listening method for the custom store_closed signal:  @receiver store_closed  def run_when_store_is_closed sender,**kwargs :     stdlogger.info "Start store_closed Store in signals.py under stores app"      stdlogger.info "sender %s" %  sender       stdlogger.info "kwargs %s" % str kwargs    This last listening signal method is almost identical to the ones used to listen for built-in Django signals –    presented in the past section in Listing 7-38. In this case, the only argument to the @receiver decorator  corresponds to the signal name store_closed, which indicates the method is listening for this signal. Since the  custom store_closed signal is produced in a limited location  i.e., in a single model method  – unlike built-in  signals that are produced by all models – the @receiver decorator forgoes adding the optional sender argument. 333   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Django Models Outside of models.py  By default, Django models are placed in models.py files inside apps. However, this single file can outgrow  the needs of large apps that require storing dozens or hundreds of models. There are three techniques you  can use to deallocate Django models from models.py files inside apps.  Django Models Inside Apps in the Models Folder The first technique to store Django models outside of models.py files is to create a folder named models –  inside the same app – declare class models in stand-alone files in this folder and import the classes through  this new folder’s __init__ file. Listing 7-42 shows an app folder layout for this type of model deployment.  Listing 7-42.  Django apps with models stored under models directory  +---+          +-stores app -+                   +-__init__.py                   +-models.py                   +-tests.py                   +-views.py                   +-apps.py                   +-models-+                                                        +-__init__.py                            +-menus.py                            +-equipment.py                            +-personnel.py  Notice in Listing 7-42 that alongside the standard models.py file is a models folder. Next, inside the  models folder are multiple .py files with Django models declared as they would typically be done inside  models.py. You can have as many models as needed in each .py file and as many .py files as you deem  necessary  e.g., one model per file .  However, the __init__ file inside this new models folder does require additional attention. While   __init__ files are typically left empty, in this case, the __init__ file must make a relative import for each  of the models – inside .py files – to make them visible to the app. For example, if the menus.py file contains  the Breakfast model class, the __init__ file must declare the line from .menus import Breakfast. This  one-line syntax – from .  import   – must be used in __init__.py for every model  declared in .py files inside the models folder.  With this layout you’re able to place Django models outside of a single models.py file, but the following   points apply to this first technique to relocate Django models:   	  The subfolder must be named models.- Because the models.py file is inspected by  default  as the Python path  .models , it requires an identically named Python  path  .models to detect models – with the __init__ file doing the rest of the  import work. So beware any other folder name different than models won’t work  with this configuration – the next technique to configure models outside models.py a  solution to using a different folder name.  334   Chapter 7   Django MoDels   	 Declaring an app as part of INSTALLED_APPS is sufficient, so long as the __init__  file performs the correct relative imports.- So long as an app is declared as part of  INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py, it’s sufficient for Django to detect any models  declared inside the models folder as described in Listing 7-42. Just take care of  relatively importing all models in the __init__.py file.   	   	  The app name for every model is determined automatically.- Since the models  folder is nested inside an app, all the models inside this folder receive the app name  configured in the apps.py file for the app. Although you can use the meta class app_ label option to explicitly assign an app to a model – as described earlier in the Meta  Class Options section – it’s redundant in this case because the models receive the  same app name they’re in, including the placement of their migrations files.  The models are accessible as if they were in models.py .- Athough the models are  placed in different files, the Python access path remains t app.models, so the models  are accessible as if they were in models.py  e.g., to access the Breakfast model class  inside the menus.py file, you would still use from  .models import Breakfast  from other parts of an application .  Django Models Inside Apps in Custom Folders A second technique to declare models outside models.py files is to use custom folders inside an app. This  requires using the main models.py file as the import mechanism and also requires using longer access paths  for models. Listing 7-43 shows an app folder layout with custom folders for models.  Listing 7-43.  Django apps with models stored under custom directories  +---+          +-stores app -+                   +-__init__.py                   +-models.py                   +-tests.py                   +-views.py                   +-apps.py                   +-menus+                         +-__init__.py                         +-breakfast.py                                      +-equipment+                              +-__init__.py                              +-kitchen.py  As you can Listing 7-43 the app now has multiple subfolders, where each folder contains multiple .py   files with Django models declared as they would typically be done inside models.py.  i.e., breakfast.py and  kitchen.py in Listing 7-43 contain model classes .  Since Django only looks for models under the Python path  .models, you must declare a relative  import in the main models.py file – for each of the models inside subfolders – to make them visible to the  app. For example, if the Breakfast model class is inside the menus subfolder file and breakfast.py file,  the main models.py file must declare the line from .menus.breakfast import Breakfast. This one-line  syntax – from . .  import   – must be used in models.py for every model  declared in subfolders inside an app.  335   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Because the models.py file uses a relative import path to the models themselves, this alters the standard   Django Python path to access models – from  .models... – and requires a longer path: from  . models. . .... Other than this change in import paths, the remaining configuration  options for models have no change in behavior  i.e., INSTALLED_APPS, model app name .  Django Models Outside Apps and Model Assignment to Other Apps A third technique available for Django models is to declare them completely outside of apps or inclusively  assign Django models to a different app than the one in which they’re declared. So what does it means to  ‘assign models to an app’? It means just that, you can declare models outside of apps or in a given app, but  change the app a model belongs to.  Although I don’t recommend this technique because it can lead to confusion, it does provide a different   solution that I’ll describe for the sake of completeness.  This technique requires you provide models an explicit app name through the meta class app_label   option so they’re assigned to an app. When Django detects a model it declares the meta app_label option,  this takes the highest precedent to assign a model its app name. So even if a model is declared inside a  random folder named common or an app named items, if a model’s meta app_label value is set to stores, the  model is assigned to the stores app, irrespective of its location.  The confusing aspect of using the app_label option is due to the influence an app name has on Django  models. For example, an app name is used to give a model’s database table name prefix and it’s also used to  determine the location of a model’s migration files. So if you define a model inside a folder named common  with the meta class app_label='stores', the model will end up belonging to the stores app – along with its  migration files and a prefix table app name stores – even though it’s declared in the common folder.  This last technique although flexible, as I’ve just explained, can also lead to unintuitive outcomes in the   naming and placement of Django model constructs.  Django Models and Multiple Databases  Back in Chapter 1, when you set up a database for a Django project, you used the DATABASES variable in  settings.py to define the type and connection parameters to perform all database-related operations in a  Django application. Since this variable is plural, it means you can declare multiple databases in a Django  project, as illustrated in Listing 7-44.  Listing 7-44.  Django multiple DATABASES definitions in settings.py  DATABASES = {    'default': {         ...     },    'devops': {         ...     },    'analytics': {         ...     }    'warehouse': {         ...     } }  336   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Listing 7-44 shows four different databases for a Django project, where the ... notation is the position in  which each database’s connection parameters are declared  e.g., ENGINE, NAME, and all those other described  in Table 1-3 .  The most important aspect in Listing 7-44 is the default key, which represents the database on which   all Django project database-related operations are made, unless otherwise specified. In the upcoming  sections, I’ll describe how to tell Django to perform data operations on different databases than the default.   If you want Django to do operations by default on a different database than default, you can declare      Tip  the DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS value in settings.py.  e.g., DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS='analytics', tells Django to perform all  database-related operation on the database assigned to the analytics handle, unless explicitly told otherwise .  Now that you know how to declare multiple databases in a Django project and the importance of the   default database, let’s explore how to execute instructions on multiple databases from within a Django project.  Multiple Databases for Django Models: using All Django model operations described in this chapter and the upcoming chapter are designed to run  against the database defined in the default handle in DATABASES, or if provided, the DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS  database handle. However, with multiple databases it’s possible to selectively execute operations against  different databases, overriding the default database.  Django models support the using keyword to indicate against which database to execute operations.   There are two variations of the using keyword:   	   	  The using option.- Django model methods such as save   and delete   support  the using option to indicate against which database to save or delete records. For  example, store.save using='analytics'  tells Django to save the store records to  the analytics database handle, overriding the default database value.  The using method.- The default Django model manager objects supports the  using   method to indicate against which database to perform a query. For example,  Item.objects.using 'warehouse' .all   tells Django to get all Item records from  the warehouse database handle, overriding the default database value.  Multiple Databases for Django Tools: --database In addition to Django models having the ability to selectively execute operations against different databases,  Django tools that perform database-related tasks also have the ability to specify a different database than the  default database handle.  For example, manage.py commands such as migrate, dumpdata, loaddata and others described  in this chapter support the --database flag to execute their logic against a different database than the  default database handle. For example, mange.py migrate --database devops tells Django to perform the  migration process on the devops database, overriding the default database value.  Multiple Database Routers: DATABASE_ROUTERS setting Although the using and --database options offer a solution to work with multiple databases in a Django  project, they both require spreading out the multi-database logic to different parts of an application  e.g.,  models and scripts . Django database routers offer the ability to centralize multi-database logic, so that based  on the model or type of database operation, the logic is executed against a different database than the default. 337   Django database routers are standard Python classes that implement up to four different methods   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  illustrated in Table 7-6.  Table 7-6.  Django database router methods  Method  Description  db_for_read model, **hints  db_for_write model, **hints  allow_relation obj1, obj2, **hints   allow_migrate db, app_label,   model_name=None, **hints   Suggests the database to use for read operations of a model. Suggests the database to use for write operations of a model. Suggests whether to  allow prevent no opinion  on relationship  operations between obj1 and obj2.  Suggests the database to use for migration operations.  **Hints are additional information provided to each router method to further determine which database to use  each routing case, in addition to the other input parameters.  Armed with this basic knowledge of methods used by Django database routers, let’s create a custom   router that stores Django models associated with core Django apps  e.g., users, admin, sessions  in one  database and other Django project models in another database. Listing 7-45 illustrates a Django database  router that performs this logic.  Listing 7-45.  Django database router to store core app models in devops database and all other models in  default database  class DatabaseForDevOps object :      def db_for_read self, model, **hints :         if model._meta.app_label in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes']:             return 'devops'          Returning None is no opinion, defer to other routers or default database         return None      def db_for_write self, model, **hints :         if model._meta.app_label in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes']:             return 'devops'           Returning None is no opinion, defer to other routers or default database         return None      def allow_relation self, obj1, obj2, **hints :          Allow relations between two models that are both Django core app models          if obj1._meta.app_label in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes'] and obj2._  meta.app_label in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes']:              return True           If neither object is in a Django core app model  defer to other routers or default            elif obj1._meta.app_label not in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes'] or   obj2._meta.app_label not in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes']:  database               return None         return None  338   Chapter 7   Django MoDels      def allow_migrate self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints :         if db == 'devops':              Migrate Django core app models if current database is devops             if app_label in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes']:                 return True             else:                  Non Django core app models should not be migrated if database is devops                 return False          Other database should not migrate Django core app models         elif app_label in ['auth','admin','sessions','contenttypes']:             return False          Otherwise no opinion, defer to other routers or default database         return None  The first two methods in Listing 7-45 – db_for_read   and db_for_write   – tell Django how to   proceed with the read and write operations of models. In this case, both methods check the model app_name,  if the app_name is either auth, admin, sessions or contenttypes – all of which are Django core apps – the  methods return the 'devops' value, which represents a database handle, as described in Listing 7-44. This  logic tells Django to perform all read and write operations for these type of models on the devops database.  If a model does not match any of the cited app_name values, notice both methods return None, which is an  indication the router class has no opinion on how to handle the model and passes control to another router  class or the default database to determine where to perform a model’s read write operations.  Here it’s worth mentioning you can use multiple Django database routers, with their configuration   order defining their precedence. If one Django database router cannot determine or does not define a  specific database on which to execute an operation or model, it moves on to the next database router, and  this process continues until all database routers are run out and the operation or model defaults to using  the default database. This behavior has the advantage that database routers don’t have to declare database  routing paths for every single model and operation in a project; it’s sufficient to declare routing rules for  certain models or operations, and let Django use the default database as a back stop.  Turning our attention back to Listing 7-45, the allow_relation   method is used to determine how   to route model operations when a model contains related models. For example, if a model contains a  ForeignKey field or ManyToManyField field, this relationship can cross over into another app, which in turn  influences where a database table can reside. In the case of Listing 7-45, the allow_relation   method  indicates to allow relationship operations if the related model objects belong to either the auth, admin,  sessions, or contenttypes apps.  Finally, the allow_migrate   in Listing 7-45 is used to define against which database migrations   operations are run. In this case, it indicates that if a migrate operation is done against the devops database,  it only migrates models belonging to either the auth, admin, sessions, or contenttypes apps and it should  ignore all other model migrations  i.e., the devops database should only contain model tables related to  the auth, admin, sessions, or contenttypes apps . The second part in allow_migrate   indicates that for  any other database that’s not devops, it should ignore model migrations for the auth, admin, sessions, or  contenttypes apps  i.e., the default database will not contain tables related to the auth, admin, sessions,  or contenttypes apps .  Once you have a database router class like the one in Listing 7-45, you must declare it as part of the   DATABASE_ROUTERS value list in settings.py. Assuming the database router class in Listing 7-45 is located  in the folder  coffeehouse common  in the routers.py file, then DATABASE_ROUTERS = ['coffeehouse. common.routers.DatabaseForDevOps'].  As I already mentioned, the DATABASE_ROUTERS value can be a list of database routers for which all  models pass through to determine on which database to perform their operations, and if the DATABASE_ ROUTERS list is exhausted, then the default database is used.  339   Chapter 7   Django MoDels  Once you finish setting up the database router configuration, you must run the migrate operation   on both of your project databases. Once this is done, all read and write operations related to Django core  app models will be done on the devops database and all other project models will be done on the default  database.   the manage.py migrate command only performs migrations against the default database.       Caution  this means that if you need to perform migrations against other databases – such as with this database router  configuration example – you must explicitly run the migrate with the --database flag to create migrations   for all non-default databases.  340   CHAPTER 8  Django Model Queries and  Managers  As you learned in the previous chapter, Django models encapsulate data through classes, enforce data  validation, are used to interact with a Django project’s relational database, and have a myriad of options to  guarantee and customize how data operates in Django projects.  In this chapter we’ll build on the previous Django model concepts and learn about a Django model   queries and managers. We’ll start with an in-depth look at Django model CRUD  Create-Read-Update- Delete  operations, including single, multiple, and relationship queries, covering their speed and efficiency  implications. Next, you’ll learn about the many SQL query variations supported by Django models,  including field lookups to produce SQL WHERE statements; models methods to produce SQL statements  like DISTINCT and ORDER; as well as query expressions to execute SQL aggregation operations, database  functions, and subqueries.  Next, you’ll learn how to create raw  open-ended  SQL queries when Django’s built-in SQL facilities   prove to be insufficient. Finally, you’ll learn how to create and configure custom model managers in Django  models.  CRUD Single Records in Django Models  Working with single records is one of the most common tasks you’ll do with Django models. Next, I’ll  structure the following sections into the classical web application CRUD operations and describe the various  techniques for each case so you can get a better grasp of what to use under different circumstances.  Note that although the following sections concentrate on the actual CRUD operation and its behaviors,   sometimes I’ll inevitably introduce more advanced query concepts in the examples  e.g., field lookups ,  which are described in detail in later sections of the chapter.  Create a Single Record with save   or create   To create a single record on a Django model, you just need to make an instance of a model and invoke the  save   method on it. Listing 8-1 illustrates the process to create a single record for a model called Store.     Tip  Consult the book’s accompanying source code to run the exercises, in order to reduce typing and  automatically access test data.    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_8  341   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-1.  Create a single record with model save   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Create a model Store instance store_corporate = Store name='Corporate',address='624 Broadway',state='CA',email='corporate@ coffeehouse.com'   Assign attribute value to instance with Python dotted notation store_corporate.city = 'San Diego'  Invoke the save   method to create the record store_corporate.save    If successful, record reference has id store_corporate.id  As you can see in Listing 8-1, you can declare all the instance attributes in a single step or you can use  Python’s dotted notation to assign attribute values one by one on the reference itself. Once the instance is  ready, call the save   method on it to create the record in the database. There are two important behaviors  to be aware of when you invoke the save   method:   	   	  By default, all Django models are assigned an auto-incrementing primary key named  id, created when you initiate a model’s database table – see the previous chapter’s  section on “Django Models and the Migrations Workflow” for more details. This  means the database assigns an id value to a record – unless you explicitly provide an  id value to the instance – that gets passed back to the reference.  The creation of a record is rejected if it violates any database or Django validation  rule created by the Django model. This means that if a new instance doesn’t comply  with any of these validation rules, save   generates an error. See the previous  chapter’s section on “Django Models Data Types” for more details on rule validation.  These are the two most important points when you use the save   method to create a record. For the   full set of options and subtleties associated with a Django model save   method, see the previous chapter’s  Table 7-3 and the section on “Model Methods.”  After a successful call to the save   method in Listing 8-1, you can see the object reference is assigned  the id attribute – created by the database – which serves to directly link it to a database record that can later  be updated and or deleted.  The create   method offers a shorter route alternative to create a record. Listing 8-2 illustrates the   equivalent record creation in Listing 8-1 using the create   method.  Listing 8-2.  Create a single record with create   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Create a model Store instance which is saved automatically store_corporate = Store.objects.create name='Corporate',address='624 Broadway',city='San Diego',  state='CA',email='corporate@coffeehouse'   If successful, record reference has id store_corporate.id  You can see in Listing 8-2 that the create   method is invoked on a Django model class through the   model’s default objects model manager. The create   method accepts arguments that represent the model  instance field values. The execution of create   returns an object reference to the created record including  an id value just like the save   method.  342   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Behind the scenes, the create   method actually uses the same save   method, but it uses the model   manager to allow the creation of a record in a single line.  Read a Single Record with get   or get_or_create   To read a single database record you can use the get   method – which is part of a model’s default objects  model manager – and which accepts any model field to qualify a record. Listing 8-3 illustrates a basic  example of the get   Django model method.  Listing 8-3.  Read model record with get   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Get the store with the name "Downtown" or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT....WHERE   name = "Downtown" downtown_store = Store.objects.get name="Downtown"    Define uptown_email for the query uptown_email = "uptown@coffeehouse.com"  Get the store with the email value uptown_email or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT....WHERE   email = "uptown@coffeehouse.com"' uptown_email_store = Store.objects.get email=uptown_email    Once the get   method runs, you can access an object's attributes  either in logging statements, functions or templates downtown_store.address downtown_store.email   Note you can access the object without attributes.  If the Django model has a __str__  method definition, the output is based on this method  If the Django model has no __str__ method definition, the output is just   print uptown_email_store   As you can see in Listing 8-3, the get   method uses a Django model attribute as its argument to  retrieve a specific record. The first example gets the Store record with name=Downtown and the second  example gets the Store record with email=uptown@coffeehouse.com. Once the record is assigned to a  variable, you can access its contents or attributes using Python’s dotted notation.     Tip   in addition to single fields – name=“Downtown” or email=“uptown@…” – the get   method also  accepts multiple fields to produce an and query  e.g., get email=“uptown@…”,name=“Downtown”  to get  a record were both email and name match . in addition, Django also offers field lookup to create finer single  record queries  e.g., get name__contains=“Downtown”  to produce a substring query . see the later section in  the chapter on queries classified by sQl keyword.  343   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  It’s that simple to use a Django model’s get   method. However, the get   method has some behaviors   you should be aware of:   	 With get   the query has to match one and only one record. If there are no matching   records you will get a  .DoesNotExist error. If there are multiple matching  records you will get a MultipleObjectsReturned error.   	  get   calls hit the database immediately and every time. This means there’s no  caching on Django’s part for identical or multiple calls.  Knowing these get   limitations, let’s explore how to tackle the first scenario that involves a record that   doesn’t exist. A common occurrence when attempting to read a single record that doesn’t exist is to get it  and if it doesn’t exist just create it. Listing 8-4 illustrates how to use the get_or_create   method for this  purpose.  Listing 8-4.  Read or create model record with get_or_create   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.items.models import Menu   Get or create a menu instance with name="Breakfast" menu_target, created = Menu.objects.get_or_create name="Breakfast"   As you can see in Listing 8-4, the get_or_create   method – also part of a model’s default objects   model manager – is invoked on a Django model class using a model’s attributes as its arguments to get or  create a record in one step. The get_or_create   method returns a pair of results, the model instance –  whether created or read – as well as a Boolean indicating whether a model instance was created or read    i.e., True if created, False if read .  The get_or_create   method is a shortcut that uses both the get   and the create   methods –   the last of which uses the save   method behind the scenes, as you learned in the previous section. The  difference being, the get_or_create   method automatically handles the error condition when get   finds  no matches. Listing 8-5 illustrates how the get_or_create   method functions behind the scenes, which  you can also use if you prefer to handle get   errors method explicitly.  Listing 8-5.  Replicate get_or_create   method with explicit try except block and save method  from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist from coffeehouse.items.models import Menu  try:      menu_target = Menu.objects.get name="Dinner"        If get   throws an error you need to handle it.       You can use either the generic ObjectDoesNotExist or        .DoesNotExist which inherits from       django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist, so you can target multiple       DoesNotExist exceptions except Menu.DoesNotExist:  or the generic "except ObjectDoesNotExist:"            menu_target = Menu name="Dinner"       menu_target.save    As you can see in Listing 8-5, it’s necessary to write more code  e.g., error handling, get and save calls   when you know there’s a possibility a record doesn’t exist and you want to create it anyways. So the get_or_ create   method becomes a helpful shortcut in this scenario.  344   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Now let’s take a look the second get   limitation, which involves getting multiple records on a query.  By design, the get   method throws a MultipleObjectsReturned error if more than one record matches a  query. This behavior is an actual feature, because there are circumstances when you want to ensure a query  only returns one record and be informed otherwise  e.g., a query for a user or product where duplicates are  considered erroneous .  If there’s a possibility for a query to return one or multiple records, then you’ll need to forgo the use  of get   method and use either a model manager’s filter   or exclude   methods. Both the filter    or exclude   methods produce a multirecord data structure called a QuerySet, which can be reduced to a  single record with an additional QuerySet method  e.g., Item.objects.filter name__contains='Salad' . first   to get the first Item record whose name contains the Salad substring .  Since a Django model’s filter   or exclude   methods are designed for multiple record queries, these   methods along with QuerySet behaviors are described in detail in the later section on CRUD operations for  multiple records. Additional QuerySet methods like first   are also described in the later section on model  queries classified by SQL keyword.  Update a Single Record with save  , update  , update_or_create  ,   or refresh_from_db   If you already have a reference to a model record, an update is as simple as updating its attributes using  Python’s dotted notation and calling the save   method on it. Listing 8-6 illustrates this process.   Get the store with the name "Downtown" or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT....WHERE name = "Downtown"  Listing 8-6.  Update model record with the save   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  downtown_store = Store.objects.get name="Downtown"    Update the name value downtown_store.name = "Downtown  Madison "   Call save   with the update_fields arg and a list of record fields to update selectively downtown_store.save update_fields=['name']    Or you can call save   without any argument and all record fields are updated downtown_store.save    In Listing 8-6, you can see the save   method is called in two ways. You can use the update_fields  argument with a list of fields to update certain fields and get a performance boost in large models. Or the  other alternative is to use save   without any argument, in which case Django updates all fields.  If you don’t yet have a reference to the record to update, it’s slightly inefficient to first get it  i.e., issue   a SELECT query  and then update it with the save   method. In addition, doing the update process in  separate steps can lead to race conditions. For example, if another user fetches the same data at the same  time and also does an update, you’ll both race to save it, but whose update is definitive and whose is  overwritten? Because no party is aware the other is working on the same data, you need a way to indicate -  technically known as lock or isolate - the data to avoid race conditions.  345   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  For such cases you can use the update   method – part of a model’s default objects model manager  – which performs an update in a single operation and guarantees there are no race conditions. Listing 8-7  illustrates this process.  Listing 8-7.  Update model record with the update   method  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  Store.objects.filter id=1 .update name="Downtown  Madison "   from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from django.db.models import F  Item.objects.filter id=3 .update stock=F 'stock'  +100   The first example in Listing 8-7 uses the update   method to update the Store record with id=1 and   set its name to Downtown  Madison . The second example in Listing 8-7 uses a Django F expression and the  update   method to update the Item record with id=3 and set its stock value to the current stock value   plus 100. For the moment, don’t worry about Django F expressions – they’re described later on for more  elaborate queries – just realize Django F expressions allow you to reference model fields within a query – as  an SQL expression – which is necessary in this case to perform the update in a single operation.     Caution  the update   method can update a field across multiple records if you’re not careful. the update    method is preceded by the objects.filter   method, which can return query results for multiple records. notice in  listing 8-7 the query uses the id field to define the query, ensuring that only a single record matches the query,  because id is the table’s primary key. if the query definition in objects.filter   uses a less strict lookup  e.g., a  string  you can inadvertently update more records than you expect.  Similar to the convenience get_or_create   method described in the previous section, Django also  offers the convenience update_or_create   method. This method is helpful in cases where you want to  perform an update and aren’t sure if the record exists yet. Listing 8-8 illustrates this process.  Listing 8-8.  Update or create model record with the update_or_create   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  values_to_update = {'email':'downtown@coffeehouse.com'}   Update for record with name='Downtown' and city='San Diego' is found,   otherwise create record obj_store, created = Store.objects.update_or_create      name='Downtown',city='San Diego', defaults=values_to_update   346   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The first thing that’s done in Listing 8-8 is create a dictionary with field values to update. Next, you pass  a query argument to update_or_create for a desired object  i.e., the one you wish to update or create , along  with dictionary containing the field values to update.  For the case in Listing 8-8, if there’s already a Store record with name='Downtown' and city='San   Diego' the record’s values in values_to_update are updated, if there is no matching Store record a new  Store record with name='Downtown', city='San Diego' along with the values in values_to_update. The  update_or_create method returns an updated or created object, as well as a Boolean value to indicate if the  record was newly created or not.   update_or_create only works on queries with single records. if there are multiple records that match      Note  the query in update_or_create   you'll get the error Multipleobjectsreturned just like the get   method.  If you change a model record inadvertently, you can reinstate its data from the database with the   refresh_from_db   method, as illustrated in Listing 8-9.  Listing 8-9.  Update model record from database with the refresh_from_db   method  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  store_corporate = Store.objects.get id=1  store_corporate.name = 'Not sure about this name'   Update from db again store_corporate.refresh_from_db     Model record name now reflects value in database again store_corporate.name   Multiple edits store_corporate.name = 'New store name' store_corporate.email = 'newemail@coffeehouse.com' store_corporate.address =   'To be confirmed'   Update from db again, but only address field  so store name and email remain with local values store_corporate.refresh_from_db fields=['address']   As you can see in Listing 8-9, after changing the name field value on a model record, you can call the   refresh_from_db   method on the reference to update the model record as it’s in the database. The second  example in Listing 8-9 uses the refresh_from_db   method with the fields argument, which tells Django  to only update the model fields declared in the fields list, allowing any  local  edits made to other fields to  remain unchanged.  Delete a Single Record with delete   If you already have a reference to a record, deleting it is as simple as invoking the delete   method on it.  Listing 8-10 illustrates this process.  347   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-10.  Delete model record with the delete   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Get the store with the name "Downtown" or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT....WHERE   name = "Downtown"  downtown_store = Store.objects.get name="Downtown"   Call delete   to delete the record in the database downtown_store.delete    For cases where you don’t yet have a reference to a record you want to delete, it can be slightly   inefficient to first get it  i.e., issue a SELECT query  and then delete it with the delete   method. For such  cases you can use the delete   method and append it to a query so everything is done in a single operation.  Listing 8-11 illustrates this process.  Listing 8-11.  Delete model record with the delete   method on query  from coffeehouse.items.models import Menu  Menu.objects.filter id=1 .delete    Irrespective of the delete   method you use – directly on reference or through the objects model  manager – a delete   method always returns a dictionary with the results of the delete operation. For  example, if the delete operation in 8-11 is successful it returns  1, {'items.Menu': 1}  indicating one  record of the items.Menu type was deleted. If the delete operation in 8-10 is successful, it returns    5, {'stores.Store_amenities': 4, 'stores.Store': 1}  indicating five overall records were deleted,  four of the stores.Store_amenities type and one of the stores.Store – in this case multiple records are  deleted because stores.Store_amenities is a model relationship in the Store model.     Caution  the delete   method can delete multiple records if you're not careful. the delete   method is  preceded by the objects.filter   method that can return query results with multiple records. notice in   listing 8-11 the query uses an id field to define the query, ensuring that only a single record matches the   query, because id is a table's primary key. if the query definition in objects.filter   uses a less strict lookup    e.g., a string  you can inadvertently delete more records than you expect.  CRUD Multiple Records in Django Models  In this section you’ll learn how to work with multiple records in Django models. Although the process is just  as easy as working with single records, working with multiple records can require multiple database calls,  as well as caching techniques and bulk operations, all of which need to be taken into account to minimize  execution times.  348   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Create Multiple Records with bulk_create   To create multiple records based on a Django model you can use the built-in bulk_create   method. The  advantage of the bulk_create   method is that it creates all entries in a single query, so it’s very efficient if  you have a list of a dozen or a hundred entries you wish to create. Listing 8-12 illustrates the process to create  multiple records for the Store model.  Listing 8-12.  Create multiple records of a Django model with the bulk_create   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Create model Store instances store_corporate = Store name='Corporate',address='624 Broadway',city ='San Diego',state='CA',  email='corporate@coffeehouse.com'  store_downtown = Store name='Downtown',address='Horton Plaza',city ='San Diego',state='CA',  email='downtown@coffeehouse.com'  store_uptown = Store name='Uptown',address='240 University Ave',city ='San  Diego',state='CA',email='uptown@coffeehouse.com'  store_midtown = Store name='Midtown',address='784 W Washington St',city ='San Diego',  state='CA',email='midtown@coffeehouse.com'    Create store list store_list = [store_corporate,store_downtown,store_uptown,store_midtown]   Call bulk_create to create records in a single call Store.objects.bulk_create store_list   In Listing 8-12 you can see the bulk_create   method accepts a list of model instances to create all  records in one step. But as efficient as the bulk_create   method is, you should be aware it has certain  limitations:   	   	  It does not support pre-save and post-save model signals.- To speed things up and  unlike the save   method to create single records, the bulk_create   method does  not execute pre-save and post-save model signals. If you’re unfamiliar with the  model signal concept, pre-save and post-save model signals allow the execution of  custom logic prior and after a model record is saved, a topic covered in the previous  chapter.  It does not support models that span multiple tables  i.e., have relationships among  one another .- Because records are created in bulk, there is no way to obtain primary  key references for the first type of created records, which are then used to create  related child records. If a model spans multiple tables, then you must individually  create each record using the save   method, which does support creating records  that span multiple tables.  If you face these limitations for the bulk_create   method, the only alternative is to loop over each   record and use the save   method to create each entry, as illustrated in Listing 8-13.  349   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-13.  Create multiple records with the save   method   Same store_list as Listing 8-12   Loop over each store and invoke save   on each entry  save   method called on each list  member to create record for store in store_list:     store.save    As I mentioned when I introduced the bulk_create   method, the process in Listing 8-13 can be highly  inefficient if it’s done for dozens or hundreds of records, but sometimes it’s the only option to create multiple  records in bulk. However, the speed issues related to Listing 8-13 can be improved if you manually deal with  model transactions.  Listing 8-14 illustrates how to use the save   method and group the entire record creation process in a   single transaction to speed up the bulk creation process.  Listing 8-14.  Create multiple records with save   method in a single transaction   Import Django model and transaction class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from django.db import transaction   Create store list, with same references from Listing 8-12 first_store_list = [store_corporate,store_downtown] second_store_list = [store_uptown,store_midtown]   Trigger atomic transaction so loop is executed in a single transaction with transaction.atomic  :      Loop over each store and invoke save   on each entry     for store in first_store_list:          save   method called on each member to create record                 store.save     Method decorated with @transaction.atomic to ensure logic is executed in single  transaction @transaction.atomic def bulk_store_creator store_list :      Loop over each store and invoke save   on each entry     for store in store_list:          save   method called on each member to create record         store.save     Call bulk_store_creator with Store list bulk_store_creator second_store_list           As you can see in Listing 8-14, there are two ways to create bulk operations in a single database   transaction, both using the django.db.transaction package. The first instance uses the with transaction. atomic  : statement, so any nested code within this statement is run in a single transaction. The second  instance uses the @transaction.atomic method decorator, which ensures the method operations are run in  a single transaction.  350   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  BE CAREFUL WITH EXPLICIT TRANSACTIONS  there’s a reason Django’s default database transaction mechanism creates transactions on every query:  it’s to err on the safe side and minimize the potential for data loss.  if you decide to use explicit transactions to improve performance – as illustrated in listing 8-14 – be  aware that either all or no records are created. although this can be a desired behavior, for certain  circumstances it might lead to unexpected results. Make sure you understand the implications of  transactions on the data you’re working with. the previous chapter contains a section discussing the  topic of Django model transactions in greater detail.  Read Multiple Records with all  , filter  , exclude  , or in_bulk   To read multiple records associated with a Django model you can use several methods, which include  all  , filter  , exclude  , and in_bulk  . The purpose of the all   method should be self-explanatory:  it retrieves all the records of a given model. The filter   method is used to restrict query results on a given  model property, for example, filter state='CA'  is a query to get all model records with state='CA'.  And the exclude   method is used to execute a query that excludes records on a given model property, for  example, exclude state='AZ'  is a query to get all model records except those with state='AZ'.  It’s also possible to chain filter   and exclude   methods to create more complex multiple record   queries. For example, filter state='CA' .exclude city='San Diego'  is a query to get all model records  with state='CA' and exclude those with city='San Diego'. Listing 8-15 illustrates more multiple record  query examples.  Listing 8-15.  Read multiple records with with all  , filter  , and exclude   methods   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Query with all   method or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT * FROM ...' all_stores = Store.objects.all     Query with include   method or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT....WHERE city = "San Diego"' san_diego_stores = Store.objects.filter city='San Diego'    Query with exclude   method or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT....WHERE NOT  city = "San Diego" ' non_san_diego_stores = Store.objects.exclude city='San Diego'    Query with include   and exclude   methods or equivalent SQL: 'SELECT....WHERE   STATE='CA' AND NOT  city = "San Diego" ' ca_stores_without_san_diego = Store.objects.filter state='CA' .exclude city='San Diego'   351   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  APPEND .QUERY TO VIEW THE ACTUAL SQL  sometimes it can be helpful or even necessary to view the actual sQl executed by a Django model  query. You can do so by appending .query to a query, as illustrated in the following listing:  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  import logging stdlogger = logging.getLogger __name__    Get the Store records with city San Diego san_diego_stores = Store.objects.filter city='San Diego'  stdlogger.debug "Query %s" % str san_diego_stores.query    You can also use print san_diego_stores.query   as you can see in the previous snippet, you can output the sQl query to a python logger or use the 'quick  & dirty' print statement. note that .query only works with queries that output Querysets, so it doesn't work  with queries like with the get   method – more on Querysets shortly. Chapter 5 describes other alternatives  to inspect the sQl used by model queries  e.g., Django debug toolbar  and Chapter 3 shows how to output  sQl queries in Django templates  e.g. Debug context processor sql_queries variable .  in addition to single fields – city=“san Diego” or state=“Ca” – the all  , filter  , and exclude   methods      Tip  can also accept multiple fields to produce an and query  e.g., filter city=“san Diego”, state=“Ca”  to get  records were both city and state match . see the later section in the chapter on queries classified by sQl  keyword.  Besides the all  , filter  , and exclude   methods, Django models also support the in_bulk     method. The in_bulk   method is designed to efficiently read many records, just like the bulk_create    method – described in the past section – is used to efficiently create many records.  The in_bulk   method is more efficient to read many records vs. the all  , filter  ,and exclude    methods, because all the latter methods produce a QuerySet and the former produces a standard Python  dictionary. Listing 8-16 illustrates the use of the in_bulk   method.  Listing 8-16.  Read multiple records with with in_bulk   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Query with in_bulk   all Store.objects.in_bulk    Outputs: {1:  , 2:  ,   3:  , 4:  }   Compare in_bulk query to all   that produces QuerySet Store.objects.all    352    Outputs:  ,  ,   ,  ]>  Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Query to get single Store by id Store.objects.in_bulk [1]   Outputs: {1:  }   Query to get multiple Stores by id Store.objects.in_bulk [2,3]   Outputs: {2:  , 3:  }  The first example in Listing 8-16 uses the in_bulk   method without any arguments to produce a   dictionary will the records of the Store model  i.e., just like the all   method . However, notice how the  output of the in_bulk   method is a standard Python dictionary, where each key corresponds to the id  value of the record.  The remaining examples in Listing 8-16 illustrate how the in_bulk   method can accept a list of values  to specify which record id’s should be read from the database. Here again, notice that although the behavior  is similar to the filter   or exclude   methods, the output is a standard Python dictionary vs. a QuerySet  data structure.  Now that you have a clear understanding of the various methods that can read multiple model records  and how some methods produce a QuerySet and other don’t, it begets the question, what is a QuerySet and  why is it used in the first place? So before we move on to the next parts of this broader section – on how to do  CRUD operations on multiple records - we’ll take a brief detour to explore the QuerySet data type.  Understanding a QuerySet: Lazy Evaluation and Caching The first important characteristic of a QuerySet data type is technically known as lazy evaluation. This  means a QuerySet isn’t executed against the database right away, it just waits until it’s evaluated. In other  words, the act of running a snippet like Store.objects.all   doesn’t involve any database activity right  away. Listing 8-17 illustrates how you can even chain query after query and still not trigger database activity.  Listing 8-17.  Chained model methods to illustrate concept of QuerySet lazy evaluation   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Query with all   method stores = Store.objects.all    Chain filter   method on query stores = stores.filter state='CA'   Chain exclude   method on query stores = stores.exclude city='San Diego'   Notice the three different statements in Listing 8-17 that chain the all  , filter  , and exclude     methods. Although it can appear Listing 8-17 makes three database calls to get Store records with  state='CA' and excludes those with city='San Diego', there is no database activity!  This is how QuerySet data structures are designed to work. So when does a query made on a QuerySet   data type hit the database? There are many triggers that make a QuerySet evaluate and invoke an actual  database call. Table 8-1 illustrates the various triggers.  353   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Table 8-1.  Django QuerySet evaluation triggers that invoke an actual database call  Evaluation Trigger  Description  Example  Iteration  for store in Store.objects.all  :  Slicing with ‘step’ argument  Creating a loop on a QuerySet  triggers a database call. Slicing a QuerySet with a third  argument  a.k.a. ‘step’ or ‘stride’  argument  triggers a database call.  NOTE: Slicing a Queryset with 1 or  2 arguments just creates another  QuerySet.  Pickling a QuerySet forces all the  results to be loaded into memory  prior to pickling. Calling repr   on a QuerySet  triggers a database call. NOTE:  This is for convenience in the  Python interactive interpreter, so  you can immediately see query  results. Calling len   on a QuerySet  triggers a database call. NOTE:  If you only want the number of  records, it’s more efficient to  use the Django model count    method. Calling list   on a QuerySet  triggers a database call.  Making a Boolean test on a  QuerySet triggers a database call.  NOTE: If you only want to check if  a record exists, it’s more efficient  to use the Django model exists    method.   A list of every 5th record, for the first  100 records Store.objects.all  [:100:5]  This does NOT trigger a database hit,   2 arguments   Records 50 to 100 Store.objects.all  [49:99]  All records starting from the 6th Store.objects.all  [5:]  This does NOT trigger a database hit   1 argument  Store.objects.all  [0]  First record import pickle stores = Store.objects.all   pickled_stores = pickle.dumps stores  repr Store.objects.all     total_stores = len Store.objects.all     NOTE: The count   method is more  efficient to get a total count efficient_total_stores = Store.objects. count     Check if there’s a store with city=‘San  Diego’ if Store.objects.filter city=‘San Diego’ :  There is a store in ‘San Diego’ pass NOTE: The exists   method is more  efficient for a Boolean check san_diego_stores = Store.objects. exists city=‘San Diego’   list   method  store_list = list Store.objects.all     Boolean tests  bool  , or, and  or if statements   * Pickling is Python’s standard mechanism for object serialization, a process that converts a Python object into  a character stream. The character stream contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the object at  a later time. Pickling in the context of Django queries is typically used for heavyweight queries in an attempt  to save resources  e.g., make a heavyweight query, pickle it, and on subsequent occasions consult the pickled  query . You can consider pickling Django queries a rudimentary form of caching.  Pickling*  repr   method  len   method  354   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Now that you know the triggers that cause a QuerySet to make a call to a database, let’s take a look at   other important QuerySet subject: caching.  Every QuerySet contains a cache to minimize database access. The first time a QuerySet is evaluated   and a database query takes place - see evaluation triggers in Table 8-1 - Django saves the results in the  QuerySet’s cache for later use.  A QuerySet’s cache is most useful when an application has a recurring need to use the same data, as  it leads to less hits on a database. However, leveraging a QuerySet’s cache comes with a few subtleties tied  to the evaluation of a QuerySet. A rule of thumb is to first evaluate a QuerySet you plan to use more than  once and proceed to use its data to leverage the QuerySet cache. This is best explained with the examples  presented in Listing 8-18.  Listing 8-18.  QuerySet caching behavior   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   CACHE USING SEQUENCE  Query awaiting evaluation lazy_stores = Store.objects.all    Iteration triggers evaluation and hits database store_emails = [store.email for store in lazy_stores]  Uses QuerySet cache from lazy_stores, since lazy_stores is evaluated in previous line   store_names = [store.name for store in lazy_stores]   NON-CACHE SEQUENCE  Iteration triggers evaluation and hits database heavy_store_emails = [store.email for store in Store.objects.all  ]  Iteration triggers evaluation and hits database again, because it uses another   QuerySet ref   heavy_store_names = [store.name for store in Store.objects.all  ]   CACHE USING SEQUENCE  Query wrapped as list   for immediate evaluation stores = list Store.objects.all     Uses QuerySet cache from stores first_store  = stores[0]  Uses QuerySet cache from stores second_store = stores[1]  Uses QuerySet cache from stores, set   is just used to eliminate duplicates store_states = set [store.state for store in stores]   Uses QuerySet cache from stores, set   is just used to eliminate duplicates store_cities = set [store.city for store in stores]    NON-CACHE SEQUENCE  Query awaiting evaluation all_stores = Store.objects.all    list   triggers evaluation and hits database store_one = list all_stores[0:1]   list   triggers evaluation and hits database again, because partially evaluating a  QuerySet does not populate the cache store_one_again = list all_stores[0:1]   355   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   CACHE USING SEQUENCE  Query awaiting evaluation coffee_stores = Store.objects.all    Iteration triggers evaluation and hits database [store for store in coffee_stores]  Uses QuerySet cache from coffee_stores, because it's evaluated fully in previous line store_1 = coffee_stores[0]  Uses QuerySet cache from coffee_stores, because it's already evaluated in full store_1_again = coffee_stores[0]  As you can see in the examples in Listing 8-18, sequences that leverage a QuerySet’s cache trigger  the evaluation of the QuerySet right away and then use a reference to the evaluated QuerySet to access  the cached data. Sequences that don’t use a QuerySet cache either constantly create identical QuerySet  statements or make the evaluation process late for each data assignment.  The only edge case for caching QuerySet’s that doesn’t fit the previous behavior is the second to last  example in Listing 8-18. If you trigger a partial evaluation of QuerySet by slicing it  e.g., [0] or [1:5]  the  cache is not populated. So to ensure a QuerySet cache is used, you must evaluate a QuerySet and then slice  the results, as illustrated in the last example in Listing 8-18.  Read Performance Methods: defer  , only  , values  , values_list  ,  iterator  , exists  , and none   Although QuerySet data structures represent a step forward toward dealing with multiple data records by  integrating lazy evaluation and caching mechanisms, they don’t cover the entire performance spectrum  needed to deal with large data queries.  A common performance problem you’ll face with large data queries is related to reading unnecessary   record fields. Although selectively choosing which fields to read from a database record can be an  afterthought in most circumstances, it can have an important impact for queries made on Django models  with more than a couple of fields.  The first methods available to increase performance while reading model records are the defer   and   only   methods, both of which are intended to delimit which fields to read in a query. The defer   and  only   methods accept a list of fields to defer or load, respectively, and are complementary to one another  depending on what you want to achieve. For example, if you want to defer loading the majority of model  fields, it’s simpler to specify which fields to load with only  , if you want to defer loading one or a few fields  in a model you can specify the fields in the defer   method. Listing 8-19 illustrates the use of the defer    and only   methods.  Listing 8-19.  Read performance with defer   and only   to selectively read record fields  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item   Item names on the breakfast menu breakfast_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Breakfast' .only 'name'    All Store records with no email all_stores = Store.objects.defer 'email' .all     Confirm loaded fields on overall query breakfast_items.query.get_loaded_field_names    Outputs: { : {'id', 'name'}}  356   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  all_stores.query.get_loaded_field_names    Outputs: { : {'id', 'address', 'state', 'city', 'name'}}   Confirm deferred fields on individual model records breakfast_items[0].get_deferred_fields    Outputs: {'calories', 'stock', 'price', 'menu_id', 'size', 'description'} all_stores[1].get_deferred_fields    Outputs: {'email'}   Access deferred fields, note each call on a deferred field implies a database hit breakfast_items[0].price breakfast_items[0].size all_stores[1].email  As you can see in Listing 8-19, both the defer   and only   methods can be chained to a model manager    i.e., objects  either at the start or end of a query, as well as be used in conjunction with other methods like  all   and filter  . In addition, notice how both methods can accept a list of fields to defer or load.  To verify which model fields have been deferred or loaded, Listing 8-19 illustrates two alternatives.  The first technique consists of calling the get_loaded_field_names   on the query reference of a query  statement to get a list of loaded fields. The second technique consists of calling the get_deferred_fields    method on a model instance to obtain a list of deferred fields.  So how do you obtain deferred fields? Easy, you cast call them. Toward the end of Listing 8-18, notice  how even though the breakfast_items represents a query that only loads the name field, a call is made to  the get the value of the price and size fields. Similarly, the all_stores reference in Listing 8-19 represents  a query that defers the email field; nevertheless you can get a record’s email field value by just calling it.  Although this last technique requires an additional database hit to get the deferred field s , it also illustrates  how easy it is to get a record’s entire fields even if they’re deferred.  The values   and values_list   methods offer another alternative to delimit the fields fetched by a  query. Unlike the defer   and only   methods that produce a QuerySet of model instances, the values    and values_list   methods produce QuerySet instances composed of plain dictionaries, tuples, or lists.  This has the performance advantage of not creating full-fledged model instances, albeit this also has the  disadvantage of not having access to full-fledged model instances.  The values   and values_list   methods accept a list of fields to load as part of a query, a process   that’s illustrated in Listing 8-20.   You can use the values   and values_list   methods without any field argument to produce full model      Tip  records as plain dictionaries, tuples, or lists.  Listing 8-20.  Read performance with values   and values_list   to selectively read record fields  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item   Item names on the breakfast menu breakfast_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Breakfast' .values 'name'  print breakfast_items   Outputs:    357   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   All Store records with no email all_stores = Store.objects.values_list 'email','name','city' .all   print all_stores   Outputs: <QuerySet [ 'corporate@coffeehouse.com', 'Corporate', 'San Diego' ,    'downtown@coffeehouse.com', 'Downtown', 'San Diego' ,  'uptown@coffeehouse.com',   'Uptown', 'San Diego' ,  'midtown@coffeehouse.com', 'Midtown', 'San Diego' ]>  all_stores_flat = Store.objects.values_list 'email',flat=True .all   print all_stores_flat   Outputs: <QuerySet ['corporate@coffeehouse.com', 'downtown@coffeehouse.com', 'midtown@ coffeehouse.com', 'uptown@coffeehouse.com']>   It isn't possible to access undeclared model fields with values   and values_list   breakfast_items[0].price ERROR  Outputs AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'price'  The first variation in Listing 8-20 generates an Item QuerySet with the name field, which as you can see   produces a list of dictionaries with only the name field and value. Next, a query is made to get the email,  name, and city fields for all Store models using the values_list   method. Notice that unlike the values    method, the values_list   method produces a more compact structure in the form of a tuple. In Listing 8-20   you can also see the values_list   method accepts the optional flat=True argument to flatten the  resulting tuple into a plain list.  Finally, toward the end of Listing 8-20 you can see that when using the values   and values_list    methods it isn’t possible to obtain undeclared fields by just calling them, like it’s possible with the defer    and only   methods. This behavior is due to the water-down QuerySet produced by the values   and  values_list   methods, which aren’t full-fledged model objects.  The iterator   method is yet another option available in Django models that creates an iterator over   the results of a QuerySet. The iterator   method is ideal for large queries that are intended to be used  once, as this lowers the required memory to store data, which is an inherent property of all Python iterators.  Listing 8-21 illustrates a query that uses the iterator   method and appendix A describes the core concepts  behind Python iterators.  Listing 8-21.  Read performance with iterator  , exists  , and none    from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   All Store with iterator   stores_on_iterator = Store.objects.all  .iterator    print stores_on_iterator   Outputs:     Advance through iterator with __next__   stores_on_iterator.__next__    Outputs:    stores_on_iterator.__next__    Outputs:     Check if Store object with id=5 exists Store.objects.filter id=5 .exists    Outputs: False  358   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Create empty QuerySet on Store model Store.objects.none    Outputs:    Another Django model read performance technique is the exists   method, which is illustrated in  Listing 8-21 and is used to verify if a query returns data. Although the exists   method executes a query  against the database, the query used by exists   is a simplified version compared to a standard query,  in addition to the exists   method returning a Boolean True or False value compared to a full-fledged  QuerySet. This makes the exists   method a good option for queries that operate on conditionals, where  it’s only necessary to verify if model records exists and the actual records data is unnecessary.  Finally, the Django model none   method – illustrated at the end of Listing 8-21 – is used to generate   an empty QuerySet, specifically of a subclass named EmptyQuerySet. The none   method is helpful for  cases where you knowingly need to assign an empty model QuerySet, such as edge cases related to Django  model forms or Django templates, which expect a QuerySet instance in one way or another. In such cases, it  becomes necessary to create a dummy QuerySet, instead of inefficiently creating QuerySet that return data  and deleting its contents.  As you’ve learned in this subsection, in addition to the QuerySet data structure, Django also offers many   methods specifically designed to efficiently read large or small amounts of records associated with Django  models.   remember the in_bulk   method from the past section also provides read performance over the basic      Tip  all  , filter  , and exclude   methods.  Update Multiple Records with update   or select_for_update   In the section on single record CRUD operations, you explored how to update single records with the  update   method; this same method can handle updating multiple records. This process is illustrated in  Listing 8-22.  Listing 8-22.  Update multiple records with the update   method  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  Store.objects.all  .update email="contact@coffeehouse.com"   from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from django.db.models import F  Item.objects.all  .update stock=F 'stock'  +100   The first example in Listing 8-22 uses the update   method to update all Store records and set their   email value to contact@coffeehouse.com. The second example uses a Django F expression and the  update   method to update all Drink records and set their stock value to the current stock value plus 100.  Django F expressions allow you to reference model fields within a query, which is necessary in this case to  perform the update in a single operation.  Although the update   method guarantees everything is done in a single operation to avoid race conditions,   on certain occasions the update   method may not be enough to do complex updates. Offering another  alternative to update multiple records is the select_for_update   method that locks rows on the given query  until the update is marked as done. Listing 8-23 illustrates an example of the select_for_update   method.  359   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  SELECT_FOR_UPDATE   SUPPORT IS DATABASE DEPENDENT  under the hood, the Django select_for_update   method is based on sQl’s seleCt…For upDate  syntax that is not supported by all databases. postgres, oracle, and MysQl databases support this  functionality, but sQlite does not.  in addition, there's the special argument nowait  e.g., select_for_update nowait=true  to make a  query non-blocking . By default, if another transaction acquires a lock on one of the selected rows, the  select_for_update   query blocks until the lock is released. if you use nowait, this allows a query to run  right away and in case a conflicting lock is already acquired by another transaction the Databaseerror is  raised when the Queryset is evaluated. Be aware though, MysQl does not support the nowait argument  and if used with MysQl, Django throws a Databaseerror.  Listing 8-23.  Update multiple records with a Django model with the select_for_update   method   Import Django model class from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from django.db import transaction   Trigger atomic transaction so loop is executed in a single transaction with transaction.atomic  :     store_list = Store.objects.select_for_update  .filter state='CA'       Loop over each store to update and invoke save   on each entry     for store in store_list:          Add complex update logic here for each store          save   method called on each member to update         store.save     Method decorated with @transaction.atomic to ensure logic is executed in single  transaction @transaction.atomic def bulk_store_updae store_list :     store_list = Store.objects.select_for_update  .exclude state='CA'       Loop over each store and invoke save   on each entry     for store in store_list:          Add complex update logic here for each store          save   method called on each member to update         store.save             Call bulk_store_update to update store records bulk_store_update store_list_to_update   Listing 8-23 shows two variations for select_for_update  , one using an explicit transaction and the   other decorating a method to scope it inside a transaction. Both variations use the same logic; they first  create a query with select_for_update  , then loop over the results to update each record and use save    to update individual records. In this manner the rows touched by the query remain locked to other changes  until the transaction finishes.  360   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Be aware that when using the select_for_update   it’s absolutely necessary to use transactions using  any of the techniques described in Listing 8-23. If you run the select_for_update   method in a database  that supports it and you don’t use transactions as illustrated in Listing 8-23 - maintaining Django’s default  auto-commit mode - Django throws a TransactionManagementError error because the rows cannot be  locked as a group. Using the select_for_update method in a database that offers no support for it has no  effect  i.e., you won’t see an error .  Delete Multiple Records with delete   To delete multiple records you use the delete   method and append it to a query. Listing 8-24 illustrates  this process.  Listing 8-24.  Delete model records with the delete   method  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  Store.objects.filter city='San Diego' .delete    The example in Listing 8-24 uses the delete   method to delete the Store records with city='San   Diego'.  CRUD Relationship Records Across Django Models  In the previous chapter, you learned how Django model relationships can help you improve data  maintenance through special model data types  i.e., ForgeignKey, ManyToManyField, and OneToOne . CRUD  operations made on Django model relationships also have a special syntax.  Although the same syntax from previous sections is applicable for direct operations made on Django   model relationship data types, you can also make reverse operations on the model that’s opposite to the  Django model that defines the relationship data type.   Direct Django model operations operate through a Manager class, and reverse operations Django      Note  model operations are done through a relatedManager class.  One to Many CRUD Operations One to many relationships are established through ForgeignKey model data types. Listing 8-25 shows a   one to many relationship between two models, including a series of direct query operations on the   related model.  Listing 8-25.  One to many ForeignKey direct query read operations  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE   361   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100    Get the Menu of a given Item Item.objects.get name='Whole-Grain Oatmeal' .menu.id   Get the Menu id of a given Item Item.objects.get name='Whole-Grain Oatmeal' .menu.name   Get Item elements that belong to the Menu with name 'Drinks' Item.objects.filter menu__name='Drinks'   In Listing 8-25 you can see the Item model declares a ForeignKey relationship to the Menu model. Once  an Item model is related to a Menu model in this way, it’s possible to access a Menu model using Python’s dot  notation as shown in Listing 8-25  e.g., menu.id and menu.name to get the id and name of the related Menu  instance on the Item reference . Notice in Listing 8-25 it’s also possible to create a query that references a  related model using __  two underscores   a.k.a. “follow notation”  to indicate a field in the related model.  The operations in Listing 8-25 use the same query syntax as non-relationship models, because the  operations are created parting from the model that has the relationship data type. However, Django also  supports CRUD operations initiated on models that don’t have the relationship data type.  Listing 8-26 illustrates a series of CRUD actions made through an instance of the Menu model done  against its related Item model. These tasks are called reverse operations, because the model holding the  relationship – ForeignKey – is reached in reverse.  Listing 8-26.  One to many ForeignKey reverse query read operations with _set syntax  from coffeehouse.items.models import Menu, Item  breakfast_menu = Menu.objects.get name='Breakfast'    Fetch all Item records for the Menu breakfast_menu.item_set.all     Get the total Item count for the Menu breakfast_menu.item_set.count     Fetch Item records that match a filter for the Menu breakfast_menu.item_set.filter name__startswith='Whole'   Listing 8-26 starts with a standard Django query for a Menu record. Although the Menu model lacks an  explicit relationship to the Item model, the Item model does declare a relationship to a Menu model, and  Django creates a reverse access pattern with the  . _set syntax.  Therefore, parting from a Menu record, you can see it’s possible to get all Item records that have a   relationship with a Menu record using the menu_record.item_set.all   syntax. Similarly, as shown in the  last example in Listing 8-26, it’s possible to generate a query that filters a set of Item records parting from a  Menu record using the same _set syntax.     Tip   You can change the _set syntax to a more explicit name or disable this behavior altogether, with the  related_name and related_query_name model field options. see the previous chapter section on “options for  relationship Model Data types” in the subsection “reverse relationship options.”  362   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Just as the reverse _set syntax is used to perform read operations parting from models that don’t   have an explicit relationship field toward the model that has the relationship field, it’s also possible to use  the same _set syntax to execute other database operations  e.g., Create, Update, Delete , as illustrated in  Listing 8-27.  Listing 8-27.  One to many ForeignKey reverse query create, update, delete operations with _set syntax  from coffeehouse.items.models import Menu, Item  breakfast_menu = Menu.objects.get name='Breakfast'    Create an Item directly on the Menu  NOTE: Django also supports the get_or_create   and update_or_create   operations breakfast_menu.item_set.create name='Bacon, Egg & Cheese Biscuit',description='A fresh  buttermilk biscuit...',calories=450    Create an Item separately and then add it to the Menu new_menu_item = Item name='Grilled Cheese',description='Flat bread or whole wheat  ...',calories=500   Add item to menu using add    NOTE: bulk=False is necessary for new_menu_item to be saved by the Item model manager  first  it isn't possible to call new_menu_item.save   directly because it lacks a menu instance breakfast_menu.item_set.add new_menu_item,bulk=False    Create copy of breakfast items for later breakfast_items = [bi for bi in breakfast_menu.item_set.all  ]   Clear menu references from Item elements  i.e. reset the Item elements menu field to null   NOTE: This requires the ForeignKey definition to have null=True   e.g. models.ForeignKey Menu, null=True   so the key is allowed to be turned null  otherwise the error 'RelatedManager' object has no attribute 'clear' is thrown breakfast_menu.item_set.clear     Verify Item count is now 0 breakfast_menu.item_set.count   0   Reassign Item set from copy of breakfast items breakfast_menu.item_set.set breakfast_items    Verify Item count is now back to original count breakfast_menu.item_set.count   3   Clear menu reference from single Item element  i.e. reset an Item element menu field to null   NOTE: This requires the ForeignKey definition to have null=True   e.g. models.ForeignKey Menu, null=True   so the key is allowed to be turned null  otherwise the error 'RelatedManager' object has no attribute 'remove' is thrown item_grilled_cheese = Item.objects.get name='Grilled Cheese'  breakfast_menu.item_set.remove item_grilled_cheese   363   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Delete the Menu element along with its associated Item elements  NOTE: This requires the ForeignKey definition to have blank=True and on_delete=models. CASCADE  e.g. models.ForeignKey Menu, blank=True, on_delete=models.CASCADE   breakfast_menu.delete    In Listing 8-27 you can see that after obtaining a reference to a Menu record, you can generate an Item   record using the create   method directly on the _set reference. Listing 8-27 also illustrates how it’s  possible to first generate an Item record and later link it to a Menu record using the add   method that also  works on the _set reference.     Note  the add  , create  , remove  , clear  , and set   relationship methods all apply database changes  immediately for all types of related fields. this means there’s no need to call save   on either end of the  relationship.  Next, Listing 8-27 is an example of the clear   relationship method. The clear   method is used to   dissociate relationships, in the case of Listing 8-27, it sets the Menu reference for all Item records associated  with a Menu named 'Breakfast' to NULL  i.e., it doesn’t delete any data, it just removes the relationship  reference . It’s worth mentioning that in order to call the clear   method, a model field must be declared  with the null=True option in order for the relationship reference to be set to NULL.  The add   relationship method in Listing 8-27 is used to associate a list of instances on a relationship.   In the case of Listing 8-27, it reverts the logic made by the clear   method in the same listing. An important  aspect of the add   relationship method is that behind the scenes it uses a model’s standard update    method to add the relationship, and this in turn requires both model records to be previously saved before  creating the relationship. You can bypass this limitation by using the bulk=False – used in Listing 8-27 – to  delegate the save operation to the related manager and create the relationship without saving the related  object beforehand.  The remove   relationship method works like the clear   relationship method, but is designed to  dissociate relationships in a granular way. In the case of Listing 8-27, the remove   method sets the Menu  reference for Item record named 'Grilled Cheese' to NULL  i.e., it doesn’t delete any data, it just removes  the relationship reference . Similar to the clear   relationship method, a model field must be declared with  the null=True option in order for the relationship reference to be set to NULL.  Finally, Listing 8-27 illustrates how calling the delete   method on a model instance with a   relationship deletes the instance on which it’s called and also its related model instances. In the case of  Listing 8-27, breakfast_menu.delete   deletes the Menu named 'Breakfast' and all the Item instances  linked to it. Similar to the clear   and remove   relationship methods, the delete   relationship method  requires a model field be declared with the on_delete=models.CASCADE option in order to automatically  delete related models.   see the previous chapter section on “options for relationship model Data types” in the subsection      Tip  “Data integrity options” for other on_delete options.  364   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Many to Many CRUD Operations In a similar fashion to one to many relationships, many to many relationships also support both direct and  reverse CRUD operations. Listing 8-28 shows a many to many relationship between two models, including a  series of direct query operations on the related model.  Listing 8-28.  Many to many ManyToManyField direct query read operations  class Amenity models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100   class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30          address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      email = models.EmailField       amenities = models.ManyToManyField Amenity,blank=True    Get the Amenity elements of a given Store Store.objects.get name='Downtown' .amenities.all     Fetch store named Midtown midtown_store = Store.objects.get name='Midtown'    Create and add Amenity element to Store midtown_store.amenities.create name='Laptop Lock',description='Ask our baristas...'    Get all Store elements that have amenity id=3 Store.objects.filter amenities__id=3   In Listing 8-28 you can see the Store model declares a ManyToManyField relationship to the Amenity   model. Once an Store model is related to an Amenity model in this way, it’s possible to access the Amenity  model using Python’s dot notation as shown in Listing 8-28  e.g., amenities.all   to get all related Amenity  instance on the Store reference . In addition, Listing 8-28 also illustrates how it’s possible to create Amenity  instances using the create   method directly on the model amenities reference. Also notice in Listing 8-28  how it’s possible to create a query that references a related model using __  two underscores   a.k.a. “follow  notation”  to indicate a field in the related model.  The operations in Listing 8-28 use the same query syntax as non-relationship models, because the  operations are created parting from the model that has the relationship data type. However, Django also  supports CRUD operations initiated on models that don’t have the relationship data type.  Listing 8-29 illustrates a series of CRUD actions made through an instance of the Amenity model done   against its related Store model. These tasks are called reverse operations, because the model holding the  relationship – ManyToManyField – is reached in reverse.  365   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-29.  Many to many ManyToManyField reverse query create, read, update, and delete operations  with _set syntax  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store, Amenity  wifi_amenity = Amenity.objects.get name='WiFi'    Fetch all Store records with Wifi Amenity wifi_amenity.store_set.all     Get the total Store count for the Wifi Amenity wifi_amenity.store_set.count     Fetch Store records that match a filter with the Wifi Amenity wifi_amenity.store_set.filter city__startswith='San Diego'    Create a Store directly with the Wifi Amenity  NOTE: Django also supports the get_or_create   and update_or_create   operations wifi_amenity.store_set.create name='Uptown',address='1240 University Ave...'    Create a Store separately and then add the Wifi Amenity to it new_store = Store name='Midtown',address='844 W Washington St...'  new_store.save   wifi_amenity.store_set.add new_store    Create copy of breakfast items for later wifi_stores = [ws for ws in wifi_amenity.store_set.all  ]   Clear all the Wifi amenity records in the junction table for all Store elements wifi_amenity.store_set.clear     Verify Wifi count is now 0 wifi_amenity.store_set.count   0   Reassign Wifi set from copy of Store elements wifi_amenity.store_set.set wifi_stores    Verify Item count is now back to original count wifi_amenity.store_set.count   6   Reassign Store set from copy of wifi stores wifi_amenity.store_set.set wifi_stores    Clear the Wifi amenity record from the junction table for a certain Store element store_to_remove_amenity = Store.objects.get name__startswith='844 W Washington St'  wifi_amenity.store_set.remove store_to_remove_amenity    Delete the Wifi amenity element along with its associated junction table records for Store elements wifi_amenity.delete    366   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  In Listing 8-29 you can see the various examples of many to many Django model reverse query   operations. Notice the similarities to the one to many relationship CRUD operation examples shown in  Listings 8-26 and 8-27. Among the notable differences of calling relationship methods in one to many and  many to many relationships, are the following:   	   	  The add   and remove   relationship methods when applied on many to many  models uses a model’s standard bulk_create   and delete   methods to add  and remove the relationship, respectively. This in turn means a model’s standard  save   method isn’t called; therefore if either model’s save   method executes  custom logic, it will never run with the add   and remove   relationship methods.  If you want to execute custom logic when a many to many relationship is created or  removed, use the m2m_changed signal. See the previous chapter section on model  signals for additional details.  If you declare a custom junction table for a many to many model relationship, the  add  , create  , remove  , and set   relationships methods are disabled. See  the previous chapter section “Options for Relationship Model Data Types” in the  subsection “Database Options” for how to use custom junction tables.  One to One CRUD Operations CRUD operations on Django one to one relationships are much simpler than the previous relationship  CRUD operations, simply because one to one relationships are inherently much simpler. In the previous  chapter, you learned how one to one relationships resemble an inheritance hierarchy, where one model  declares generic fields and a second  related  model inherits the fields of the former and adds more  specialized fields.  This means one to one relationships just have direct query operations, as reverse operations don’t make  sense since models follow a hierarchy structure. Listing 8-30 shows a one to many relationship between two  models, including a series of query operations on the related model.  Listing 8-30.  One to one OneToOneField query operations  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  See Listing 8-25 for Item model definition  class Drink models.Model :     item = models.OneToOneField Item,on_delete=models.CASCADE,primary_key=True      caffeine = models.IntegerField     Get Item instance named Mocha mocha_item = Item.objects.get name='Mocha'    Access the Drink element and its fields through its base Item element mocha_item.drink.caffeine   Get Drink objects through Item with caffeine field less than 200 Item.objects.filter drink__caffeine__lt=200    Delete the Item element and its associated Drink record  NOTE: This deletes the associated Drink record due to the on_delete=models.CASCADE in the  OneToOneField definition mocha_item.delete    367   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Query a Drink through an Item property Drink.objects.get item__name='Latte'   As you can see in Listing 8-30, the operations for one to one Django model relationships are much   simpler than the previous example, albeit the query operations still use the same dotted notation to move  through the relationship models and fields as well as __  two underscores   a.k.a. “follow notation”  to  perform queries by field on the related model.  Read Performance Relationship Methods: select_related   and  prefetch_related   In these last Django model relationship CRUD operation sections — Listings 8-25 through 8-30 — you  learned how easy it is to traverse from one model to another model via its relationship field to access other  fields. For example, for a one to many relationship between an Item and Menu model, you can access the  name field on a Menu record using the syntax item.menu.name; similarly for a many to many relationship  between a Store and Amenity model, you can access the name field on an Amenity record using the syntax  store.amenities.all  [0].name.  While this dot notation provides an effortless approach to access fields in related models – similar to   how the defer   and load   methods allow effortless access to deferred data – this technique also generates  additional database hits that can be prevented with the select_related   and prefetch_related    methods.  The selected_related   method accepts related model fields arguments that should be read as part   of an initial query. Although this creates a more complex initial query, it avoids additional database hits  on related model fields. Listing 8-31 illustrates an example of the select_related   method, along with a  query that forgoes its use.  Listing 8-31.  Django model select_related syntax and generated SQL  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  See Listing 8-25 for Item and Menu model definitions   Inefficient access to related model for item in Item.objects.all  :      item.menu  Each call to menu creates an additional database hit   Efficient access to related model with selected_related   for item in Item.objects.select_related 'menu' .all  :      item.menu  All menu data references have been fetched on initial query   Raw SQL query with select_related print Item.objects.select_related 'menu' .all  .query  SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name", "items_ item"."description", "items_item"."size", "items_item"."calories", "items_item"."price",  "items_item"."stock", "items_menu"."id", "items_menu"."name" FROM "items_item" LEFT OUTER  JOIN "items_menu" ON  "items_item"."menu_id" = "items_menu"."id"    Raw SQL query without select_related print Item.objects.all  .query  SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name", "items_ item"."description", "items_item"."size", "items_item"."calories", "items_item"."price",  "items_item"."stock" FROM "items_item"  368   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  In Listing 8-31 you can see there are two variations to access the related Menu model for all Item model   records. The first variation uses the Item.objects.all   syntax to get all Item model records and then  directly accesses the menu field to gain access to the corresponding Menu record. The problem with this  approach is that getting the Menu record for each Item record generates an additional database hit, so if you  have 100 Item records this implies an additional 100 database hits!  The second variation in Listing 8-31 adds the select_related 'menu'  method to the query, ensuring   the related Menu record for each Item record is also fetched as part of the initial query. This technique  guarantees that all relationship data is fetched in a single query.  In the bottom half of Listing 8-31 you can see the raw SQL generated when the select_related     method is used and omitted. When select_related   is used, a more complex LEFT OUTER JOIN query is  used to ensure all related data is read in one step.  The prefetch_related   method solves the same problem as the select_related   method, but does   so using a different technique. As you saw in Listing 8-31, the select_related   method fetches related  model data in a single query by means of a database JOIN; however, the prefetch_related   method  executes its join logic once the data is in Python.  Although a database JOIN solves a multi-query problem in a single query, it’s a heavyweight operation   that is often used sparingly. For this reason, the select_related   method is limited to single value  relationships  i.e., ForeignKey and OneToOneField model fields , since multi-value relationships associated  with a junction table  i.e., ManyToManyField  can produce an inordinate amount of data in a single query.  When a query uses the prefetch_related   method, Django first executes the primary query and later   generates QuerySet instances for all the related models declared inside the prefetch_related   method.  All of this happens in a single step, so by the time you attempt to access related model references, Django  already has a pre-filled cache of related results, which it joins as Python data structures to produce the final  results. Listing 8-32 illustrates an example of the prefetch_related   method.  Listing 8-32.  Django model prefetch_related syntax and generated SQL  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  See Listing 8-25 for Item  model definitions  See Listing 8-28 for Store  model definitions   Efficient access to related model with prefetch_related   for item in Item.objects.prefetch_related 'menu' .all  :      item.menu  All menu data references have been fetched on initial query   Efficient access to many to many related model with prefetch_related    NOTE Store.objects.select_related 'amenities' .all   is invalid due to many to many model for store in Store.objects.prefetch_related 'amenities' .all  :      store.amenities.all     Raw SQL query with prefetch_related print Item.objects.prefetch_related 'menu' .all  .query  SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name", "items_ item"."description", "items_item"."size", "items_item"."calories", "items_item"."price",  "items_item"."stock" FROM "items_item"   Raw SQL query with prefetch_related print Store.objects.prefetch_related 'amenities' .all  .query  SELECT "stores_store"."id", "stores_store"."name", "stores_store"."address", "stores_ store"."city", "stores_store"."state", "stores_store"."email" FROM "stores_store"  369   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The first query in Listing 8-32 is equivalent to the query presented in Listing 8-31 that fetches the related   Menu model for all Item model records, except that it uses the prefetch_related   method. The second query  in Listing 8-32 is made on a many to many model relationship to fetch the related amenities model instances  for all Store model records using the prefetch_related   method. It’s worth mentioning this last query is  only possible with the prefetch_related   method because it’s a many to many model relationship.  Finally, in the bottom half of Listing 8-32, you can confirm the raw SQL produced by queries that use   the prefetch_related   method appear as a plain SQL query  i.e., no JOIN . In this case, it’s Django  Python itself that’s charged with managing and creating the additional QuerySet data structures needed to  efficiently read related model data.   the prefetch_related   method can be further optimized with a prefetch   object to further filter a      Tip  prefetch operation or inclusively use selected_related.1  Model Queries by SQL Keyword  In the previous sections you learned how to query single, multiple and related records with Django model  methods. However, the matching process was done for the most part on exact values. For example, a query  for the Store record with id=1 translated into the SQL WHERE ID=1 or a query for all Store records with  state="CA" translated into the SQL WHERE STATE="CA".  In reality, exact SQL matching patterns are far from most real world scenarios that require finer grained   SQL queries. In the following sub-sections, you’ll learn about the various Django model query options  classified by SQL keywords, this way you can easily identify the required Django syntax using the better  known SQL keywords as identifiers.  WHERE Queries: Django Field Lookups The SQL WHERE keyword is among the most used keywords in relational database queries, because it’s used  to delimit the amount of records in a query through a field value. Up to this point, you’ve mostly used the  SQL WHERE keyword to create queries on exact values  e.g., WHERE ID=1 ; however, there are many other  variations of the SQL WHERE keyword.  In Django models, variations of the SQL WHERE keyword are supported through field lookups, which   are keywords appended to field filters using __  two underscores   a.k.a. “follow notation” .  THE PK LOOKUP SHORTCUT  Django queries rely on model field names to classify queries. For example, the sQl Where iD=1  statement in a Django query is written as … id=1 , and the sQl Where naMe=“Ca” statement in a  Django query is written as … state=“Ca” .  in addition, Django models can also use the pk shortcut – where pk=“primary key” – to perform queries  against a model’s primary key. By default, a Django model’s id field is the primary key, so id field and pk  shortcut queries are considered equivalent  e.g., store.objects.get id=1  store.objects.get pk=1  .  a query with a pk lookup only has a different meaning than one with an id field, when a model defines a  custom primary key model field.  1https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref models querysets prefetch-objects  370   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  = EQUAL and != NOT EQUAL queries: exact, iexact Equality or = queries is the default WHERE behavior used in Django models. There are two syntax variations  for equality searches; one is a short-handed version and the other uses the exact field lookup, Listing 8-33  shows both approaches.  Listing 8-33.  Django equality = or EQUAL query  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item   Get the Store object with id=1 Store.objects.get id__exact=1    Get the Store object with id=1  Short-handed version  Store.objects.get id=1    Get the Drink objects with name="Mocha" Item.objects.filter name__exact="Mocha"    Get the Drink objects with name="Mocha"  Short-handed version  Item.objects.filter name="Mocha"   As you can see in Listing 8-33, you can either use the exact field lookup to explicitly qualify the query   or use the short-handed syntax  = . Because exact WHERE queries are the most common,  Django implies exact searches by default.   You can do case insensitive equality queries with the iexact field lookup  e.g., match ‘iF’,‘if’,‘if’, or ‘iF’ .      Tip  see liKe and iliKe queries section for details.  Inequality or != searches also have two syntax variations presented in Listing 8-34.  Listing 8-34.  Django inequality != or NOT EQUAL query with exclude   and Q objects  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from django.db.models import Q   Get the Store records that don't have state 'CA' Store.objects.exclude state='CA'    Get the Store records that don't have state 'CA', using Q Store.objects.filter ~Q state="CA"     Get the Item records and exclude items that have more than 100 calories Item.objects.exclude calories__gt=100    Get the Item records and exclude those with 100 or more calories, using Q Item.objects.filter ~Q calories__gt=100    371   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  As you can see in Listing 8-34, one syntax variation uses the exclude   method to exclude objects that  match a given statement. Another alternative is to use a Django Q object to negate a query. In Listing 8-34   you can see the Q object Q state="CA"  that matches state values with CA, but because the Q object is  preceded with ~ tilde symbol  it’s a negation pattern  i.e., matches state values that aren’t CA .  Both the exclude   and Q object syntax produce the same results. Q objects are mostly used in more   complex queries, but in this case a negated Q object works just like exclude  .  AND queries To create SQL WHERE queries with an AND statement you can add multiple statements to a query or use   Q objects, as illustrated in Listing 8-35.  Listing 8-35.  Django AND query  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from django.db.models import Q   Get the Store records that have state 'CA' AND city 'San Diego' Store.objects.filter state='CA', city='San Diego'    Get the Store records that have state 'CA' AND city not 'San Diego' Store.objects.filter Q state='CA'  & ~Q city='San Diego'    The first example in Listing 8-35 adds multiple field values to the filter   method to produce a WHERE     AND   statement. The second example in Listing 8-35 also uses the filter   method,  but uses two Q objects to produce a negation with the AND statement  i.e., WHERE   AND NOT     through the & operator.   if you’re looking for a broader anD query than the ones in listing 8-35, for example, get store objects      Tip  with state ‘Ca’ anD those with state ‘aZ’, look at either or queries or in queries.  if you’re looking to combine two queries, for example, query1 anD query 2, look at the Merge queries section  later in this same chapter.  OR queries: Q   objects To create SQL WHERE queries with an OR statement you can use Q objects, as illustrated in Listing 8-36.  Listing 8-36.  Django OR query  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from django.db.models import Q  372   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Get the Store records that have state 'CA' OR state='AZ' Store.objects.filter Q state='CA'   Q state='AZ'     Get the Item records with name "Mocha" or "Latte" Item.objects.filter Q name="Mocha"   Q name='Latte'    Both examples in Listing 8-36 uses the   pipe  operator between Q objects to produce a WHERE     OR   statement, similar to how the & operator is used for AND conditions.  IS and IS NOT queries: isnull The SQL IS and IS NOT statements are typically used with WHERE in queries involving NULL values. And  depending on the database brand, SQL IS and IS NOT can also be used in Boolean queries. To create SQL  WHERE queries with an IS or IS NOT statement you can use a Python None data type with an equivalency  test or the isnull field lookup, as illustrated in Listing 8-37.  Listing 8-37.  Django IS and IS NOT queries  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Drink from django.db.models import Q   Get the Store records that have email NULL Store.objects.filter email=None    Get the Store records that have email NULL Store.objects.filter email__isnull=True    Get the Store records that have email NOT NULL Store.objects.filter email__isnull=False   The first example in Listing 8-37 attempts a query on Python’s None value; in this case None gets   translated to SQL’s NULL  i.e., IS NULL . The second and third examples in Listing 8-37 use the isnull field  lookup, to create IS NULL and IS NOT NULL queries, respectively.  IN queries: in The SQL IN statement is used with WHERE clauses to generate queries that match a list of values. To create  SQL WHERE queries with an IN statement you can use the in field lookup, as illustrated in Listing 8-38.  Listing 8-38.  Django IN queries  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Drink   Get the Store records that have state 'CA' OR state='AZ' Store.objects.filter state__in=['CA','AZ']    Get the Item records with id 1,2 or 3 Item.objects.filter id__in=[1,2,3]   As you can see in Listing 8-38, the Django in field lookup can be used to create a query for records that   match a list values from any field  e.g., integers, strings .  373   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  LIKE and ILIKE queries: contains, icontains, startswith, istartswith, endswith,  iendswith The SQL LIKE and ILIKE queries are used with WHERE clauses to match string patterns, with the former  being case sensitive and the latter case insensitive. Django offers three field lookups to generate SQL LIKE  queries, depending on the string pattern you wish to match. Listing 8-39 illustrates how to generate three  different SQL LIKE queries with Django field lookups.  Listing 8-39.  Django LIKE queries  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item, Drink   Get the Store records that contain a 'C' anywhere in state  LIKE '%C%'  Store.objects.filter state__contains='C'    Get the Store records that start with 'San' in city  LIKE 'San%'  Store.objects.filter city__startswith='San'    Get the Item records that end with 'e' in name  LIKE '%e'  Drink.objects.filter item__name__endswith='e'   As you can see in Listing 8-39, the % symbol represents an SQL wildcard and is placed in different   positions in the SQL LIKE pattern value depending on the Django field lookup: to generate an SQL query  with the LIKE '%PATTERN%' you use the contains field lookup; to generate an SQL query with the LIKE  'PATTERN%' you used the startswith field lookup; and to generate an SQL query with the LIKE '%PATTERN'  you use the endswith field lookup.  Django also supports the SQL ILIKE queries, which function as LIKE queries, but are case insensitive.   Listing 8-40 illustrates how to create ILIKE queries with Django field lookups.  Listing 8-40.  Django ILIKE queries  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item   Get the Store recoeds that contain 'a' in state anywhere case insensitive  ILIKE '%a%'  Store.objects.filter state__icontains='a'    Get the Store records that start with 'san' in city case insensitive  ILIKE 'san%'  Store.objects.filter city__istartswith='san'    Get the Item records that end with 'a' in name case insensitive  ILIKE '%A'  Item.objects.filter name__iendswith='A'    Get the Store records that have state 'ca' case insensitive  ILIKE 'ca'  Store.objects.filter state__iexact='ca'   The examples in Listing 8-40 are just like those in Listing 8-39, but the only difference is Django’s field   lookups are preceded with the letter i to indicate a case-insensitive ILIKE query.  It’s worth mentioning the last example in Listing 8-40 is a case-insensitive version of = EQUAL and   != NOT EQUAL queries. However, because iexact uses ILIKE under the hood it’s mentioned again in this  section.  374   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  REGEXP queries: regex, iregex Sometimes the patterns supported by SQL LIKE & ILIKE statements are too basic, in which case you can  use an SQL REGEXP statement to define a complex pattern as a regular expression. Regular expressions  are more powerful because they can define fragmented patterns, for example: a pattern that starts with sa  followed by any letters, followed by a number; or a conditional pattern, such as pattern that starts with Los  or ends in Angeles. Django supports the SQL REGEXP keyword through the regex field lookup and also  supports case-insensitive regular expression queries through the iregex field lookup.  Although it would be beyond the scope of our discussion to describe the many regular expression   syntax variations, a sample regular expression query to match Store records with a city that starts with Los  or San would be: Store.objects.filter city__regex=r'^ LosSan  +' .  Note the recommended practice to define patterns for regex or iregex field lookups is to use Python  raw string literals. A Python raw string literal is a string preceded by r that conveniently expresses strings  that would be modified by escape sequence processing  e.g., the raw string r'\n' is identical to the standard  string '\\n' . This behavior is particularly helpful with regular expressions that rely heavily on escape  characters. Appendix A describes the use of Python raw strings in greater detail.  > GREATER THAN and < LESS THAN queries: gt, gte, lt, lte SQL WHERE statements associated with numeric fields often use the mathematical operators >, >=, <,  and <= to restrict queries to certain number ranges. Django models support the use of the mathematical  operators >, >=, < and <= through the gt, gte, lt, and lte field lookups, respectively. Listing 8-41 illustrates  the use of these field lookups in Django.  Listing 8-41.  Django GREATER THAN and LESSER THAN queries  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item   Get Item records with stock > 5 Item.objects.filter stock__gt=5    Get Item records with stock > or equal 10 Item.objects.filter stock__gte=10    Get Item records with stock < 100 Item.objects.filter stock__lt=100    Get Item records with stock < or equal 50 Item.objects.filter stock__lte=50   Date and time queries: Range, date, year, month, day, week, week_day, time,  hour, minute, second Although SQL WHERE queries for date and time fields can be done with equality, greater than and lesser  than symbols, writing SQL date and time queries can be time consuming due to their special characteristics.  For example, to create an SQL query to get all records with a 2018 year timestamp, you need to create a query  like 'WHERE date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-12-31'. As you can see, syntax-wise these queries can  become complex and error prone if you add the need to deal with things like timezones, months, and things  like leap years.  375   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  To simplify the creation of SQL WHERE queries with date and time values, Django offers various field   lookups, which are illustrated in Listing 8-42.  Listing 8-42.  Django date and time queries with field lookups  from coffeehouse.online.models import Order from django.utils.timezone import utc import datetime   Define custom dates start_date = datetime.datetime 2017, 5, 10 .replace tzinfo=utc  end_date = datetime.datetime 2018, 5, 21 .replace tzinfo=utc    Get Order recrods from custom dates, starting May 10 2017 to May 21 2018 Order.objects.filter created__range= start_date, end_date     Get Order records with exact start date orders_2018 = Order.objects.filter created__date=start_date    Get Order records with year 2018 Order.objects.filter created__year=2018    Get Order records with month January, values can be 1 through 12  1=January, 12=December . Order.objects.filter created__month=1    Get Order records with day 1, where values can be 1 through 31. Order.objects.filter created__day=1    Get Order records from January 1 2018 Order.objects.filter created__year=2018,create__month=1,created__day=1    Get Order records that fall on week number 24 of the yr, where values can be 1 to 53. Order.objects.filter created__week=24    Get Order recrods that fall on Monday, where values can be 1 to 7  1=Sunday, 7=Saturday . Order.objects.filter created__week_day=2    Get Order records made at 2:30pm using a time object Order.objects.filter created__time=datetime.time 14, 30     Get Order records made at 10am, where values can be 0 to 23  0=12am, 23=11pm . Order.objects.filter date__hour=10    Get Order records made at the top of the hour, where values are 0 to 59. Order.objects.filter date__minute=0    Get Order records made the 30 second mark of every minute, where values are 0 to 59. Order.objects.filter date__second=30   376   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The first example in Listing 8-42 uses the range field lookup, which takes two Python datetime.  datetime objects to define a date range for the query. Although range is the most flexible approach to create  date and time queries, there are other field lookup alternatives that offer simpler syntax. The date field  lookup allows you to create a query for an exact date.  The year, month, and day field lookups allow you to create queries that match records for a given   year, month, or day, respectively. In addition, if you look at the middle of Listing 8-42, you’ll notice it’s also  possible to create a query with multiple field lookups to match a combination of year, month, and day.  Finally, toward the bottom half of Listing 8-42 you can see the week and week_day field lookups can   create a query for records that match a given week of the year or day of the week, respectively. In addition  to the time field lookup designed to make a query based on a datetime.time object, as well as the hour,  minute, and second field lookups designed to create queries for records that match a given hour, minute, or  second, respectively.   to make a query that only extracts dates and times from a record  and not the full record , look at the      Tip  DistinCt section under the date and time subsection.  CAN’T FIND AN SQL WHERE STATEMENT? CUSTOM LOOKUPS,   EXTRA  , SUBQUERIES, OR RAW QUERY  although Django provides an extensive list of field lookups to generate various sQl Where statements,  this doesn’t mean you will always find the necessary field lookup to generate a desired sQl Where  statement. in such cases, you have the following alternatives:                  Create a custom lookup: just like other Django custom constructs, you can create  custom lookups with custom sQl Where statements.2  use the extra   method: the Django model extra   method can also be used to create a  custom sQl Where statement.3  use a subquery: subqueries allow the creation of Where statements dependent on  the results of other queries. a later section in this chapter addresses how to crate sQl  subqueries on Django models.  raw sQl query: You can create a raw  open-ended  sQl query with verbatim sQl  Where statements. a later section in this chapter addresses how to execute raw sQl  queries on Django models.  DISTINCT Queries The SQL DISTINCT keyword is used to filter duplicate records and is supported in Django models through  the distinct   method. By default, SQL DISTINCT and the Django distinct   method are applied against  the contents of entire records. This means that unless a query limits its number of fields or a query spans  multiple models, the distinct   method will never produce distinct results. Listing 8-43 illustrates several  queries that use the distinct   method that better illustrate this behavior.  2https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 howto custom-lookups  3https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref models querysets extra  377   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-43.  Django DISTINCT queries with distinct    from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Get all Store records number Store.objects.all  .count   4   Get all distinct Store record number Store.objects.distinct  .count   4   Get distinct state Store record values Store.objects.values 'state' .distinct  .count   1   ONLY for PostgreSQL, distinct   can accept model fields to create DISTINCT ON query Store.objects.distinct 'state'   The first query in Listing 8-43 gets the total count for all Store records, whereas the second query gets   the total count for distinct Store records. Notice how even though the second query uses the distinct    method, both counts are the same, since there’s at least one field value  e.g., id  across all records that is  distinct.  The third query in Listing 8-43 makes use of the values   method to restrict the query records to only  the state field. Once this is done, the distinct   method is applied to the query followed by the count    method, to get the total number of distinct state values. By applying a selective query field method  e.g.,  values   or values_list    prior to the distinct   method, the logic performed by the distinct   method  produces a logical output.  The final example in Listing 8-43 passes a model field to the distinct   method to produce an SQL   DISTINCT ON query. This last distinct   method syntax is only supported for PostgreSQL databases that  understand the SQL DISTINCT ON statement.  Dates and times queries: dates   and datetimes   In addition to the distinct   method, Django also offer two special methods designed to extract DISTINCT  date and time values from records. The dates   and datetimes   methods generate a list of datetime. date or datetime.datetime objects  respectively  based on model record values that match distinct dates or  times.  The dates   method accepts three arguments, two required and one optional. The first argument    required  is a date field on which to perform the DISTINCT query, the second argument  required  is the  date component on which to perform the DISTINCT query, which can be 'year', 'month', or 'day'. The  third argument  optional  is the query order that defaults to 'ASC' for ascending, but can also be for 'DESC'  descending.  The datetimes   method also accepts three arguments, two required and one optional. The first   argument  required  is a date time field on which to perform the DISTINCT query, the second argument   required  is the date time component on which to perform the DISTINCT query, which can be 'year',  'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', or 'second'. The third argument  optional  is the query order that  defaults to 'ASC' for ascending, but can also be for 'DESC' descending.  Listing 8-44 illustrates a series of examples using the dates   and datetimes   methods.  378   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-44.  Django DISTINCT date and time queries with dates and datetimes   methods  from coffeehouse.online.models import Order   Get distinct years  as datetime.date  for Order objects Order.objects.dates 'created','year'   Outputs:     Get distinct months  as datetime.date  for Order objects Order.objects.dates 'created','month'   Outputs: <QuerySet [datetime.date 2017, 3, 1 ,datetime.date 2017, 6, 1 ,datetime. date 2018, 2, 1 ]>   Get distinct days  as datetime.datetime  for Order objects Order.objects.datetimes 'created','day'   Outputs:   ...]>   Get distinct minutes  as datetime.datetime  for Order objects Order.objects.datetimes 'created','minute'   Outputs:   ...]>  As you can see in Listing 8-44, the dates   method produces a list of datetime.date objects generated  from a given date component across all model records, whereas the datetimes   method produces a list of  datetime.datetime objects generated from a given date time component across all model records. Note the  examples in Listing 8-44 apply the dates   and datetimes   methods to all model records, but it’s valid to  use these methods on any query  i.e., filter   or exclude   .   You can also use an aggregation query to count distinct values. see the aggregation queries section      Tip  for additional details on this process.  ORDER Queries: order_by   and reverse   SQL queries often use the ORDER keyword to tell the database engine to sort query results based on certain  field or fields. This technique is helpful because it avoids the additional overhead of sorting records outside  the database  i.e., in Python . Django models support the SQL ORDER statement through the order_by    method. The order_by   method accepts model fields as input to define the query order, a process that’s  illustrated in Listing 8-45.  Listing 8-45.  Django ORDER queries  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Get Store records and order by city  ORDER BY city  Store.objects.all  .order_by 'city'    Get Store recrods, order by name descending, email ascending  ORDER BY name DESC, email ASC  Store.objects.filter city='San Diego' .order_by '-name','email'   379   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The first example in Listing 8-45 defines a query for all Store objects ordered by city. By default, order_ by sets the order ascending  i.e., ’A’ records first, ’Z’ records last . The second example in Listing 8-45 defines  a Store query but with multiple fields, so the query is first ordered by the first field and then with the second.  In addition, the second example illustrates the use of the –  minus  symbol to override the default ascending  order, -name indicates to order records by name but in descending order  i.e., ’Z’ records first, ’A’ records last .   You can declare the ordering Meta option on a model to set its default query ordering behavior, instead      Tip  of declaring the order_by   method. see the previous chapter’s Query meta options section.  In addition to the order_by   method, Django models also support the reverse   method that inverts  the results of a QuerySet. The reverse   method works just like Python’s standard reverse   method that  inverts the order of a list, except it’s designed to operate on Django QuerySet data structures before the data  is materialized.  LIMIT Queries THE SQL LIMIT statement is used when you want to avoid reading an entire set of records in a query and  instead limit the resulting records to a smaller set. The SQL LIMIT statement is helpful for cases when you  purposely want to read query records gradually  e.g., large queries that are displayed on multiple pages,  a.k.a. pagination  – or you want to sample a query  e.g., get the first, last, latest, or oldest record in a query .  Django models offer various mechanisms to generate LIMIT queries described in the next sections.  LIMIT and OFFSET queries: Python slice syntax SQL LIMIT queries are often accompanied by the OFFSET statement, the last of which is used to extract  records starting from a given point in the whole set of records. Django models support the creation of SQL  queries with LIMIT and OFFSET statements using standard Python slice syntax  i.e., the same syntax used to  split lists . Listing 8-46 illustrates how to generate LIMIT and OFFSET queries.  Listing 8-46.  Django LIMIT and OFFSET queries with Python slice syntax  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.items.models import Item   Get the first five  LIMIT=5  Store records that have state 'CA' Store.objects.filter state='CA' [:5]   Get the second five  OFFSET=5,LIMIT=5  Item records  after the first 5  Item.objects.all  [5:10]   Get the first  LIMIT=1  Item object Item.objects.all  [0]  As you can see in Listing 8-46, the technique to generate LIMIT and OFFSET queries is through Python’s   slice syntax applied directly to QuerySet data structures. In case you’ve never used Python’s slice syntax,  the technique is straightforward: The syntax QuerySet[start:end] gets items from start to end-1 of a  QuerySet, the syntax QuerySet[start:] gets items from start through the rest of a QuerySet,and the syntax  QuerySet[:end] gets items from the beginning of a QuerySet through end-1.  380   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Pseudo LIMIT 1 order queries: first   and last   Under certain circumstances, the SQL LIMIT statement is used to get a single record that’s the first or last  record in a set of records. Django models support the first   and last   methods, which generate a LIMIT 1  query just as if you created a query with the slice syntax [0] – describe in Listing 8-46.  The first   and last   methods are typically preceded by the order_by   model method, in order to   guarantee an expected record order and thus get the first or last record of said records. If the first   and  last   methods are applied without the order_by   model method, then queries are applied against the  default ordering mechanism – by the id field – and thus first   returns the record with the first id value  and last   returns the record with the last id value.  For example, the query Store.objects.filter state='CA' .first   gets the first Store record with   state='CA' with the lowest id  since order defaults to id , a query that’s equivalent to Store.objects. filter state='CA' [0]. The query Item.objects.all  .order_by 'name' .last   gets the last Item  record with the name that comes last in the alphabet  since order is specified by name , a query that’s  equivalent to Item.objects.all  .order_by 'name' .reverse  [0].  Pseudo LIMIT 1 date and time queries: latest   and earliest   For SQL LIMIT queries associated with dates or times, Django offers the latest   and earliest   methods  to obtain the most recently or first created model records  respectively  based on a date field. Both the  latest   and earliest   methods accept a date field on which to perform a query and provide much  shorter syntax to deal with LIMIT queries related to dates or times vs. the first   and last  . This is  because latest   and earliest   methods automatically perform the order_by   operation on the field  provided as an argument.  For example, Order.objects.latest 'created'  gets the most recent Order record based on the   created field, whereas Order.objects.earliest 'created'  gets the oldest Order record based on the  created field.   use the get_latest_by Meta option in a model to set a default field on which to execute the latest   and      Tip  earliest   methods. see the previous chapter on Meta options for additional details.  Merge Queries SQL queries often need to be merged to produce different sets of results, such as combining the records of  multiple SQL queries or obtaining common records between multiple SQL queries. Django supports various  ways to merge SQL queries, both as QuerySet data structures, as well as through SQL query statements like  UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.  QuerySet merger: Pipe and itertools.chain As you’ve learned throughout this chapter, Django models most often use QuerySet data structures to  represent SQL queries. Such QuerySet data structures often require to be merged, to present a larger set of  results and avoid having to perform new database queries. Listing 8-47 illustrates the two syntax variations  available to merge QuerySet data structures.  381   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-47.  Combine two Django queries with   pipe  and itertools.chain  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item, Drink from itertools import chain  menu_sandwich_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Sandwiches'  menu_salads_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Salads'  drinks = Drink.objects.all     A pipe applied to two QuerySets generates a larger QuerySet lunch_items = menu_sandwich_items  menu_salads_items    can't be used to merge QuerySet's with different models  ERROR menu_sandwich_items  drinks   itertools.chain generates a Python list and can merge different QuerySet model types lunch_items_with_drinks = list chain menu_sandwich_items, drinks    The first option in Listing 8-47 uses the   pipe  operator to combine two QuerySet data structures. This   technique produces yet another QuerySet data structure, but has the caveat of only working on QuerySet’s  that use the same model  e.g., Item .  The second option in Listing 8-47 uses the Python itertools package to merge two QuerySet data   structure with the chain   method. This technique produces a standard Python list – with the respective  model objects – and is the more flexible option because it can combine QuerySet data structures even if they  use different models  e.g., Item and Drink .  UNION queries: union   The SQL UNION statement is used to merge two or more queries directly in the database. Unlike the  previous merge query techniques – illustrated in Listing 8-47 – which take place in Django Python, UNION  queries are done entirely by the database engine. Django supports the SQL UNION statement through the  union   method, as illustrated in Listing 8-48.  Listing 8-48.  Merge Django queries with union    from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  menu_breakfast_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Breakfast'  menu_sandwich_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Sandwiches'  menu_salads_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Salads'    All items merged with union   all_items = menu_breakfast_items.union menu_sandwich_items,menu_salads_items  print all_items.query  SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id" ... WHERE "items_menu"."name" = Breakfast UNION   SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id" ... WHERE "items_menu"."name" =   Sandwiches UNION SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id"... WHERE   "items_menu"."name" = Salads  382   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-48 first declares three standard SQL queries that produce QuerySet data structures. Next,  notice how the union   method is linked to one of the queries and the remaining queries are passed as  arguments. Finally, Listing 8-48 illustrates how the results of the union   method produce a query with  multiple SQL UNION statements that merge the individual queries.  In addition to the union   method accepting different QuerySet instances as arguments, the union     method also accepts the optional keyword all argument that is set to False. By default, the union   method  ignores duplicate values across QuerySet instances; however, you can set the all argument to True to tell  Django to merge duplicate records  e.g., menu_breakfast_items.union menu_sandwich_items,menu_ salads_items, all=True  .  INTERSECT queries: intersection   The SQL INTERSECT statement is used to obtain records that intersect  i.e., are present  across multiple  queries. Django supports the SQL INTERSECT statement through the intersection   method, as illustrated  in Listing 8-49.  Listing 8-49.  Intersect  Common  Django query records with intersection    from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  all_items = Item.objects.all   menu_breakfast_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Breakfast'    Intersected  common  records merged with intersect   intersection_items = all_items.intersection menu_breakfast_items  print intersection_items.query  SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name"... INTERSECT   SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name"... WHERE   "items_menu"."name" = Breakfast  Listing 8-49 first declares two standard SQL queries that produce QuerySet data structures. Next, notice   how the intersection   method is linked to one of the queries and the remaining query is passed as an  argument. Finally, Listing 8-49 illustrates how the results of the intersection   method produce a query  with an SQL INTERSECTION statements to produce the common records across queries.  The intersection   method only accept QuerySet instances as arguments. In addition, be careful   when declaring more than two QuerySet instances on an intersection   query, as only records that are  present in all QuerySet instances form part of the final query result.  EXCEPT queries: difference   The SQL EXCEPT statement is used to obtain records that are present in a query, but missing in other  queries. Django supports the SQL EXCEPT statement through the difference   method, as illustrated in  Listing 8-50.  Listing 8-50.  Except Django query records with difference    from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  all_items = Item.objects.all   menu_breakfast_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Breakfast'  menu_sandwich_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Sandwiches'  menu_salads_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Salads'   383   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Extract records in all_items, except those in:      menu_breakfast_items, menu_sandwich_items & menu_salads_items ex_items = all_items.difference menu_breakfast_items, menu_sandwich_items, menu_salads_ items  print ex_items.query  SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name"...EXCEPT   SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name"... EXCEPT   SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name", ... EXCEPT   SELECT "items_item"."id", "items_item"."menu_id", "items_item"."name" ... WHERE   "items_menu"."name" = Salads  Listing 8-50 first declares four standard SQL queries that produce QuerySet data structures. Next, notice   how the difference   method is called on the all_items query and the remaining queries are passed as  arguments to be excluded from the all_items query. Finally, Listing 8-50 illustrates how the results of the  difference   method produce a query with multiple SQL EXCEPT statements that exclude query records  from the parent query.  Aggregation Queries SQL queries sometimes need to produce values derived from the core fields contained in Django models   e.g., mathematical calculations such as counts, averages, maximum or minimum values from sets of  records . Storing this type of aggregate information as individual Django model fields is redundant – since  it can be derived from core data – and calculating this data outside the context of a database is also wasteful   e.g., reading all records and producing the aggregate results in Python .  SQL offers the necessary statements for a database to solve this problem, through aggregation functions.  An aggregation function forms part of an SQL query, which is executed by the database engine and returned  as a stand-alone result – when used in conjunction with the aggregate   method – or as an additional  field along with the resulting SQL response – when used in conjunction with the annotate   method.  Django supports aggregation queries through a series of methods that include count  , aggregate  , and  annotate  , as well as aggregation classes.  COUNT queries: count   method and Count   class The SQL COUNT aggregation function is used in cases where you only need to get the number of records  that match a certain criteria, rather than reading all records that make up a query. Queries that use SQL  COUNT are also more efficient because it’s the database engine that makes the calculation, instead of getting  all the data and making the calculation in Python.  Django models supports the SQL COUNT aggregation function through the count   method and the   aggregate Count class. Both variations are illustrated in Listing 8-51.  Listing 8-51.  Django COUNT queries with aggregate  , annotate  , and Count    from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  from django.db.models import Count   Get the number of stores  COUNT *   stores_count = Store.objects.all  .count   print stores_count  4  384   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Get the number of stores that have city 'San Diego'  COUNT *   stores_san_diego_count = Store.objects.filter city='San Diego' .count     Get the number of emails, NULL values are not counted  COUNT email   emails_count = Store.objects.aggregate Count 'email'   print emails_count  {'email__count': 4}   Get the number of emails, NULL values are not counted  COUNT email    AS "coffeehouse_store_emails_count"  emails_count_custom = Store.objects.aggregate coffeehouse_store_emails_count=Count 'email'   print emails_count_custom  {'coffeehouse_store_emails_count': 4}   Get number of distinct Amenities in all Stores, NULL values not counted  COUNT DISTINCT name   different_amenities_count = Store.objects.aggregate Count 'amenities',distinct=True   print different_amenities_count  {'amenities__count': 5}   Get number of Amenities per Store with annotate stores_with_amenities_count = Store.objects.annotate Count 'amenities'    Get amenities count in individual Store stores_With_amenities_count[0].amenities__count   Get number of Amenities per Store with annotate and custom name stores_amenities_count_custom = Store.objects.annotate amenities_per_store=Count 'amenities'   stores_amenities_count_custom[0].amenities_per_store  The first two examples in Listing 8-51 append the count   method as the last part of a Django query to   get a total count.  The third example in Listing 8-51 uses the aggregate   function and the aggregate Count class to get  the total count of emails in Store records. Notice how a query with the aggregate   method produces a  dictionary, where the key is the counted field – in this case email – suffixed with the __count to indicate  aggregate class, and the dictionary value is the resulting count. The fourth example in Listing 8-51 is very  similar to the third one, except it prefixes the aggregate Count class with a custom string to simulate the SQL  AS keyword, so the resulting dictionary value uses the custom string coffeehouse_store_emails_count as  the key result.  if no string is assigned to an aggregate class  e.g., Count  in a query, the resulting query output      Note  defaults to:  __ .  The fifth example in Listing 8-51 illustrates how the aggregate Count class can accept the optional   distinct=True argument to omit duplicate values in the count. In this case, a count is made for all  amenities associated with Store records, but the count only reflects distinct amenities values.  Although the aggregate   method produces aggregation results, it’s limited to only producing   the aggregation result by itself, that is, it requires additional queries to get the core data from where the  aggregation result was calculated. The annotate   method solves this problem, as shown in Listing 8-51.  385   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The last two examples in Listing 8-51 use the annotate   method to add an additional field to a query’s   records to hold an aggregate result. The second to last example in Listing 8-51 adds the amenities__count  field via the aggregate Count   class to all Store records. And the last example in Listing 8-51 assigns a  custom string to the aggregate Count   class to create the custom amenities_per_store field to hold the  amenities count for all Store records.  MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG, VARIANCE and STDDEV queries: Max  , Min  , Sum  ,  Avg  , Variance  , and StdDev   classes In addition to the SQL COUNT aggregation function, SQL queries also support other aggregation functions  for mathematical operations that are best done in the database. These SQL aggregation functions include  MAX to get a maximum value from a set of records, MIN to get a minimum value from a set of records, SUM  to a sum of values from a set of records, AVG to get the average from a set of records, VARIANCE to get the  statistical variance of values from a set of records, and STDDEV to get the statistical deviation from a set of  records.  Django models support all the previous SQL aggregation functions through the use of aggregation   classes – just like Count   aggregation described in Listing 8-51. Therefore to make use of these additional  SQL aggregation functions, you use a Django model’s aggregate   or annotate   methods in conjunction  with the relevant aggregation class, a processed that’s illustrated in Listing 8-52.  Listing 8-52.  Django MAX, MIN,SUM, AVG, VARIANCE and STDDEV queries with Max  , Min  , Sum  ,  Avg  , Variance   and StdDev   classes  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from django.db.models import Avg, Max, Min from django.db.models import Sum from django.db.models import Variance, StdDev   Get the average, maximum and minimum number of stock for all Item records avg_max_min_stock = Item.objects.aggregate Avg 'stock' , Max 'stock' , Min 'stock'    print avg_max_min_stock  {'stock__avg': 29.0, 'stock__max': 36, 'stock__min': 27}   Get the total stock for all Items item_all_stock = Item.objects.aggregate all_stock=Sum 'stock'   print item_all_stock  {'all_stock': 261}   Get the variance and standard deviation for all Item records  NOTE: Variance & StdDev return the population variance & standard deviation, respectively.        But it's also possible to return sample variance & standard deviation,        using the sample=True argument item_statistics = Item.objects.aggregate Variance 'stock' , std_dev_stock= StdDev 'stock'   {'std_dev_stock': 5.3748, 'stock__variance': 28.8888}  As you can see in the first example in Listing 8-52, it’s possible to define multiple aggregate classes to  a single query as part of the aggregate   method, in this case the query gets the average, minimum, and  maximum stock values across all Item records.  386   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The second example in Listing 8-52 gets the sum of all stock values across all Item records by using   the aggregate Sum class. Notice how it’s possible in this second example to prefix the aggregate class with a  custom string to act as an SQL AS keyword, in order for the query to output the results with a different value  than the aggregate class name. Finally, the last example in Listing 8-52 calculates the variance and standard  deviation for all stock values across all Item records.   if you want to perform more complex aggregation queries, such as multi-field math operations       Tip   e.g., multiplication , see the F expressions subsection.  if want to perform more complex aggregation queries, see the section on Model queries with raw    open-ended  sQl.  Expression and Function Queries SQL queries irrespective of their many statements generally reference values provided by the calling  environment. For example, when you create a query to get all Store records that have certain state values,  Django Python provides a value reference for the state, similarly, if you create a query to get all Item  records that belong to a certain Menu model, Django Python provides a value reference for the Store.  For certain SQL queries, though, it’s necessary to use references that point toward data in the actual  database. This is necessary because the results for certain SQL queries depend on the data present in the  database, or because, manipulating the data outside the context of a database  i.e., Python  represents an  additional effort that can easily be solved in SQL.  You already learned about this technique in the past section on Aggregation queries, where an SQL  query can tell a database engine to calculate things like counts and averages, without the need to pull the  data and do the operations outside the database  i.e., in Python . Aggregation queries rely on a special  subset of expressions properly called aggregation expressions, but in this upcoming sections you’ll learn how  Django supports many other types of SQL expressions.  Another SQL technique designed in the same spirit of SQL expressions to favor the delegation of work   to the database engine are SQL functions. SQL functions are intended to allow a database to alter the results  of query  e.g., concatenate two fields or transform a field to upper lowercase  and alleviate the need to such  tasks in the calling party environment  i.e., Django Python . In the upcoming section you’ll also learn about  different SQL functions supported by Django models.  SQL expression queries: F expressions Django F expressions are among the most common type of SQL expressions you’ll use in Django models.   At the start of this chapter you were exposed to the utility of F expressions when you learned how it’s possible  to update a record in a single step, and let the database engine perform the logic without the need pull the  record out of the database.  Through an F expression, it’s possible to reference a model field in a query and let the database perform   an operation on the model field value without the need to pull the data from the database. In turn, this  not only provides a more succinct query syntax – a single update query, instead of two  one to read, one to  update  – it also avoids ‘race conditions’.4  4https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Race_condition  387   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-53 illustrates various ways that F expressions can be used on update queries.  Listing 8-53.  Django F   expression update queries  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from django.db.models import F   Get single item egg_biscuit = Item.objects.get id=2   Check stock egg_biscuit.stock 2  Add 10 to stock value with F   expression egg_biscuit.stock = F 'stock'  + 10  Trigger save   to apply F   expression egg_biscuit.save    Check stock again egg_biscuit.stock    Ups, need to re-read refresh from DB egg_biscuit.refresh_from_db    Check stock again egg_biscuit.stock 12   Decrease stock value by 1 for Item records on the Breakfast menu breakfast_items = Item.objects.filter menu__name='Breakfast'  breakfast_items.update stock=F 'stock'  – 1    Increase all Item records stock by 20 Item.objects.all  .update stock=F 'stock'  + 20   The first example in Listing 8-53 reads a single model record and applies an F   expression to the stock   field. Once the F   expression is applied, it’s necessary to call the save   method on the record for the  database to trigger the update. Next, notice that in order for the model record reference to reflect the results  of the F   expression, you must reread the record from the database – in this case with the refresh_from_ db   method – given the database is the only party aware of the result of the update operation.  Next in Listing 8-53, you can see how it’s also possible to perform a subtraction operation on an F     expression, as well as apply an F   expression to all the records in a QuerySet through the update   method.  In addition to updating records without the need to extract data from the database, F   expressions   can also be used in database read operations. F   expressions are helpful for read queries and aggregation  queries where the results are best determined by the database engine, as shown in Listing 8-54.  Listing 8-54.  Django F   expressions in read queries and aggregate queries  from django.db.models import  F, ExpressionWrapper, FloatField from coffeehouse.items.models import Drink, Item  calories_dbl_caffeine_drinks = Drink.objects.filter item__calories__gt=F 'caffeine' *2   items_with_assets = Item.objects.annotate                                   assets=ExpressionWrapper F 'stock' *F 'price' ,                                  output_field=FloatField      388   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Notice how the first query example in Listing 8-54 lacks any fixed values and is instead composed of   references that are checked by the database engine to return records that match the condition. In this case,  the query obtains all Drink records that have calories greater than two times their caffeine content, where  its database engine – via the F   expression – is tasked with determining which Drink records comply with  this rule.  The second example in Listing 8-54 creates an aggregate query from two F   expressions. In this case,  a new field called assets is calculated with the annotate   method, by multiplying the value of a record’s  stock and price fields via F   expressions. Unlike the aggregation queries examples in the previous section,  this aggregation has two important differences and arguments:   	   	  ExpressionWrapper.- Because the aggregate query in Listing 8-54 is composed of  multiple model fields, it’s necessary to delimit its scope by wrapping the aggregate  query in the ExpressionWrapper statement.  output_field.- When an aggregate query is composed of multiple model fields  and the data types differ, it’s necessary to specify output_field with a model data  type. In Listing 8-54, because stock is an IntegerField model field and price is a  FloatField model field, the output_field tells Django to generate the aggregated  assets field as a FloatField, thus avoiding data type ambiguity.  SQL function queries: Func expressions and Django database functions Func expressions are another expression subset supported by Django models, which have the same purpose  as other SQL expressions: to use the database to execute operations, instead of fetching data and later  performing the operation outside the database  i.e., in Python .  Func expressions are used in Django to trigger the execution of database functions. Unlike F   expressions that are used to perform basic operations against model fields, Func expressions are used to  execute more sophisticated functions supported by databases and run them against models fields.  Listing 8-55 illustrates an example of a Func expression that calls an SQL function, as well as a couple of   Django database functions that simulate SQL functions.  Listing 8-55.  Django Func   expressions for SQL functions and Django SQL functions  from django.db.models import  F, Func, Value from django.db.models.functions import Upper, Concat from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   SQL Upper function call via Func expression and F expression stores_w_upper_names = Store.objects.annotate name_upper=Func F 'name' , function='Upper'   stores_w_upper_names[0].name_upper 'CORPORATE' stores_w_upper_names[0].name 'Corporate'   Equivalent SQL Upper function call directly with Django SQL Upper function stores_w_upper_names_function = Store.objects.annotate name_upper=Upper 'name'   stores_w_upper_names_function[0].name_upper 'CORPORATE'   SQL Concat function called directly with Django SQL Concat function stores_w_full_address = Store.objects.annotate full_address=                                Concat 'address',Value ' - ' ,'city',Value ' , ' ,'state'    389   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  stores_w_full_address[0].full_address '624 Broadway - San Diego, CA' stores_w_full_address[0].city 'San Diego'  The first example in Listing 8-55 makes use of the Func   expression to generate the additional name_ upper field via annotate  . The purpose of the additional name_upper field is to get the name of all Store  records in an uppercase format, a process that fits perfectly with the SQL UPPER function. In the case of  Listing 8-55, the Func   expression declares two arguments: an F expression to specify the model field on  which to apply the function and the function argument to specify the SQL function to use. Once the query  is created, you can see in Listing 8-55, each record has access to the additional name_upper field with an  uppercase version of the name field, as well as access to the other model fields.  Although Func   expressions are the most flexible option to generate Django model queries with SQL  expressions, Func   expressions can be verbose for default scenarios. Django offers a quicker alternative to  generate SQL expressions via SQL functions that are of the django.db.models.functions package.  The second query in Listing 8-55 is equivalent to the first query, but notice this variation uses the  Django database Upper   function as an argument of the annotate   method, similar to how Django  aggregate classes are declared in annotate   statements.  The third example in Listing 8-55 generates the additional full_address field via annotate    and makes use of the Django database Concat   function. The purpose of the Concat   function is  to concatenate the values of multiple model fields. In the case of Listing 8-55, the Concat   function  concatenates the values of the Store model’s address, city, and state. In order to leave spaces between the  concatenated field values, the Concat   function uses the Django Value   expression to output verbatim  separators and spaces. Once the query is created, you can see in Listing 8-55 that each record has access to  the additional full_address field with a concatenated value of the address, city, and state fields, as well  as access to the other model fields.  Django includes over a dozen database functions in the django.db.models.functions package5 for   strings, dates, and other data types you can leverage as SQL functions in queries.  SQL subqueries: Subquery expressions SQL subqueries are queries that are nested inside other standard CRUD queries or inclusively other  subqueries. Most SQL subqueries are used under two scenarios. The first scenario occurs when you need  to create SQL queries with related fields that span multiple tables, yet the underlying tables don’t have an  explicit relationship between one another.  This first SQL subquery scenario is common for queries involving multiple Django models with missing  relationship data types  i.e., OneToOneField, ForeignKey, and ManyToManyField . Listing 8-56 illustrates this  SQL subquery scenario solved through the use of Subquery expressions.  Listing 8-56.  Django Subquery expression with SQL subquery to get related model data  from django.db.models import OuterRef, Subquery  class Order models.Model :     created = models.DateTimeField auto_now_add=True   5https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref models database-functions   390   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  class OrderItem models.Model :     item = models.IntegerField       amount = models.IntegerField       order = models.ForeignKey Order    Get Items in order number 1 order_items = OrderItem.objects.filter order__id=1   Get item order_items[0].item 1  Get item name ?   OrderItem item field is IntegerField, lacks Item relationship  Create sub-query to get Item records with id item_subquery = Item.objects.filter id= OuterRef 'id'      Annotate previous query with sub-query order_items_w_name = order_items.annotate item_name=Subquery item_subquery.values 'name'  [:1]    Output SQL to verify print order_items_w_name.query  SELECT `online_orderitem`.`id`, `online_orderitem`.`item`,     `online_orderitem`.`amount`, `online_orderitem`.`order_id`,       SELECT U0.`name` FROM `items_item` U0 WHERE U0.`id` =  online_orderitem.`id`  LIMIT 1       AS `item_name` FROM `online_orderitem` WHERE `online_orderitem`.`order_id` = 1  Access item and item_name order_items_w_name[0].item 1 order_items_w_name[0].item_name 'Whole-Grain Oatmeal'  The first lines in Listing 8-56 show the Order and OrderItem models, including a query that gets all the  OrderItem records that belong to Order number 1. Next, you can see that although the OrderItem model has  an item field, its value is an integer. This presents a problem because it isn’t possible to obtain the name and  other properties associated with an item field integer value, or in other words, the OrderItem records are  missing a relationship to the Item model. This problem can be solved with a subquery.  Next in Listing 8-56, the Item.objects.filter id= OuterRef 'id'    subquery is declared to get all   the Item records by id, which is the value the main OrderItem expects to map to item values. The special  OuterRef syntax work like an F expression to be evaluated until the parent query is resolved; after all, the  Item records to get by id are dependent on the parent query  e.g., The subquery should only Item records by  id for only those items in an OrderItem record .  Once the subquery is defined in Listing 8-56, it’s linked via the annotate   method and the Subquery     expression to the initial OrderItem query. Next, you can see the SQL generated by the query contains a  subquery referencing the Item model. Finally, Listing 8-56 illustrates the output of the additional item_name  field on the OrderItem query that’s generated via a subquery.  The second scenario involving subqueries is when an SQL query must generate a WHERE statement with   values that are dependent on the results of another SQL query. This scenario is illustrated in Listing 8-57.  391   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-57.  Django Subquery expression with SQL subquery in WHERE statement   See Listing 8-56 for referenced model definitions from coffeehouse.online.models import Order from coffeehouse.items.models import Item from django.db.models import OuterRef, Subquery   Get Item records in lastest Order to replenish stock most_recent_items_on_order = Order.objects.latest 'created' .orderitem_set.all     Get a list of Item records based on recent order using a sub-query items_to_replenish = Item.objects.filter id__in=Subquery                                      most_recent_items_on_order.values 'item'     print items_to_replenish.query  SELECT `items_item`.`id`, `items_item`.`menu_id`, `items_item`.`name`, `items_ item`.`description`, `items_item`.`size`, `items_item`.`calories`,  `items_item`.`price`, `items_item`.`stock` FROM `items_item` WHERE `items_item`.`id`   IN  SELECT U0.`item` FROM `online_orderitem` U0 WHERE U0.`order_id` = 1   The first step in Listing 8-57 gets all OrderItem records from the latest Order record, with the purpose to  detect which Item stock to replenish. However, because OrderItem records use a plain integer id to reference  Item records, it’s necessary to create a subquery that gets all Item records based on the OrderItem integer  reference.  Next in Listing 8-57, a query is made for Item records whose id is contained in a subquery. In this case, a  Subquery expression is used to point toward the most_recent_items_on_order query that only gets the item  values  i.e., integer values  from the most recent Order record.  Finally, Listing 8-57 illustrates how the generated query uses a WHERE statement that makes use of a   subquery.  JOIN QUERIES  the sQl join keyword is used to produce queries from multiple database tables. Django supports  join queries for related models through the select_related   method, described earlier in the CruD  relationship records across Django models.  if you want to create a join query between tables that don’t have a Django model relationship, you can  use a raw sQl query, described in the next section.  Model Queries with Raw  Open-Ended  SQL  As extensive as Django model queries are, there can be circumstances when neither of the options presented  in previous sections is sufficient to execute certain CRUD operations. Under these circumstances, you must  rely on raw  open-ended  SQL queries, which represent the most flexible approach to execute operations  against databases connected to Django projects.  392   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Django offers two ways to execute raw SQL queries. The first consists of using a model manager’s raw     method that fits the resulting SQL query data into a Django model, which has the added advantage of raw  SQL queries behaving as close as possible to native Django model queries. And a second approach consists  of using a Python database connection – managed by Django – to fetch the SQL query data and process it  with lower-level Python DB API functions  e.g., cursor .6  SQL Queries with a Model Manager’s raw   Method A model manager’s raw   method should be your first option to execute raw SQL queries, since the results  are structured as a RawQuerySet class instance, which is very similar to the QuerySet class instances  produced by Django model queries you’ve used up to this point.  Thus a RawQuerySet class instance – just like a QuerySet class instance – offers an easy way to access   records using a Django model’s fields, the ability to defer the loading of model fields, as well as indexing and  slicing. Listing 8-58 illustrates a series a raw SQL query performed with a model manager’s raw   method.  Listing 8-58.  Django model manager raw   method  from coffeehouse.items.models import Drink, Item   Get all drink all_drinks = Drink.objects.raw "SELECT * FROM items_drink"    Confirm type type all_drinks   Outputs:     Get first drink with index 0 first_drink = all_drinks[0]   Get Drink name  via item OneToOne relationship  first_drink.item.name   Use parameters to limit a raw SQL query caffeine_limit = 100   Create raw   query with params argument to pass dynamic arguments drinks_low_caffeine = Drink.objects.raw "SELECT * FROM items_drink where caffeine <  %s",params=[caffeine_limit] ;  The first snippet in Listing 8-58 uses the Drink model manager’s raw   method to issue the SELECT  * FROM items_drink query. It’s worth mentioning this raw query produces the same results as the native  Django query Drink.objects.all  , but unlike native queries that produce QuerySet data structures, notice  how raw   method queries produce RawQuerySet data structure.  Because a RawQuerySet data structure is a subclass of QuerySet, Listing 8-58 shows how it’s   possible to use many of the same mechanisms as QuerySet data structures. For example, access to  records is also done by index  e.g., [0] to get the first elements  and it’s also possible to access related  models using dot notation.  6https:  www.python.org dev peps pep-0249   393   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Finally, the last example in Listing 8-58 illustrates how to create raw SQL queries with dynamic   arguments using the params argument. In all cases where you need to create raw   SQL queries that depend  on dynamic values  e.g., provided by a user or another subroutine  you should always create the backing  raw SQL query string with placeholders – %s – which then get substituted through the params argument. In  the case of Listing 8-58, notice how the caffeine_limit variable is declared in params to later be substituted  into the raw SQL query. The params argument ensures dynamic values are escaped from queries before  being applied to the database, avoiding a potential SQL injection security attack.7  The raw   SQL example in Listing 8-58 is straightforward because the results of the query map directly   to the intended model. In other words, the SELECT * FROM items_drink query produces the necessary  results for Django to create Item records without additional help. Sometimes though, raw   SQL queries  require additional configuration to be able to create the underlying model records.  For example, if you perform a raw SQL query on a legacy table or multiple tables, with the intention to  use the raw   method of a certain model, you must ensure Django is able to interpret the results of raw SQL  query to the model, by either using SQL AS statements in the raw SQL or relying on the raw   translations  parameter. Listing 8-59 illustrates both techniques.  Listing 8-59.  Django model manager raw   method with mapping, deferred fields, and aggregate queries   Map results from legacy table into Item model all_legacy_items = Item.objects.raw "SELECT product_name AS name, product_description AS  description from coffeehouse_products"    Access legacy results as if they are standard Item model records all_legacy_items[0].name   Use explicit mapping argument instead of 'as' statements in SQL query legacy_mapping = {'product_name':'name','product_description':'description'}   Create raw   query with translations argument to map table results all_legacy_items_with_mapping = Item.objects.raw "SELECT * from coffeehouse_products",  translations=legacy_mapping    Deferred model field loading, get item one with limited fields item_one = Item.objects.raw "SELECT id,name from items_item where id=1"   Acess model fields not referenced in the raw query, just like QuerySet defer   item_one[0].calories item_one[0].price   Raw SQL query with aggregate function added as extra model field items_with_inventory = Item.objects.raw "SELECT *, sum price*stock  as assets from items_ item" ;  Access extra field directly as part of the model items_with_inventory[0].assets  The first example in Listing 8-59 declares a raw   method with multiple SQL AS statements, in this case,  each of the AS clauses corresponds to an Item model field. In this manner, when Django inspects the results  of the raw query, it knows how to map the results to Item instances, irrespective of the underlying database  table column names.  7https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki SQL_injection  394   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The second example in Listing 8-59 declares a raw   method with the translations argument whose   value is a Python dictionary that maps database table column names to Django model fields. In this case,  when Django encounters an unknown database table column name in the raw query results, it uses the  translations dictionary to determine how to map the results to Item instances.  The third example in Listing 8-59 illustrates how even when issuing a partial raw SQL query with the  raw   method, Django is capable of fetching missing fields as if it were a native QuerySet data structure.  Finally, the fourth example in Listing 8-59 illustrates how the raw   method is capable of handling extra  fields declared as aggregation queries and how they become accessible as if they were added with the native  model aggregate   method.  SQL Queries with Python’s DB API Although the Django model raw   method offers a great alternative to create raw SQL queries and have  the ability to leverage native Django model features, there are circumstances where raw SQL queries with  a model’s raw   method won’t work. Either because the results of a raw SQL query can’t be mapped to a  Django model, or because, you simply want access to the raw data without any Django model influence.  Under such circumstances, you’ll need to use the second Django alternative to perform raw SQL   queries, which consists of directly connecting to a database and explicitly extracting the results of a query.  Although this second Django alternative is technically the most flexible to interact with a database, it also  requires using lower-level calls from Python’s DB API.  The only thing you can leverage from Django when performing raw SQL queries using this technique   is the database connection defined in a Django project  i.e., the DATABASES variable in settings.py .  Once a database connection is established, you’ll need to rely on Python DB API methods like cursor  ,  fetchone   and fetchall   – as well as perform manual extraction of the results – to be able to successfully  run raw SQL queries.  Listing 8-60 illustrates SQL queries using the Python DB API in the context of Django.  Listing 8-60.  Django raw SQL queries with connection   and low-level DB API methods  from django.db import connection   Delete record target_id = 1 with connection.cursor   as cursor:     cursor.execute "DELETE from items_item where id = %s", [target_id]    Select one record salad_item = None with connection.cursor   as cursor:     cursor.execute "SELECT * from items_item where name='Red Fruit Salad'"      salad_item = cursor.fetchone     DB API fetchone produces a tuple, where elements are accessible by index salad_item[0]  id salad_item[1]  name salad_item[2]  description   Select multiple records all_drinks = None with connection.cursor   as cursor:  395   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers      cursor.execute "SELECT * from items_drink"      all_drinks = cursor.fetchall     DB API fetchall produces a list of tuples all_drinks[0][0]  first drink id  The first statement in Listing 8-60 imports django.db.connection, which represents the default  database connection defined in the DATABASES variable in settings.py. Once you have a connection  reference to the Django database, you can start to make use of the Python DB API, which generally starts  with the use of the cursor   method.8  The first raw SQL query in Listing 8-60 opens a cursor on the connection and executes the cursor.  execute   method to perform a delete operation. Because delete queries don’t return results, the operation  is considered concluded after the calling the cursor.execute   method   if you declare multiple database reference in DataBases, you can cause the django.db.connections      Tip  reference to create a cursor on a specific database, instead of the default:  from django.db import connections  cursor = connections['analytics'].cursor    Cursor connects to 'analytics' DB  The second raw SQL query in Listing 8-60 first declares the salad_item placeholder variable to store   the results of the raw SQL query. Once this is done, another cursor is opened on the connection to execute  a select operation using the same cursor.execute   method. Because select queries return a result, an  additional call is made on the cursor.fetchone   method to extract the results of the query and assign  them to the placeholder variable. Note the fetchone   method is used because it’s expected the raw SQL  query will return a single record result.  Next, observe how the results of raw SQL query in salad_item are accessed by an index. Since the   Python DB API cursor.fetchone   method makes no use of field names or other references, you have to  know the order in which record fields are returned, a process that can be particularly cumbersome for raw  SQL with many fields.  The third raw SQL query in Listing 8-60 first declares the all_drinks placeholder variable to store the   results of the raw SQL query. Once this is done, another cursor is opened on the connection to execute  anther select operation using the same cursor.execute   method. Because select queries return a result,  an additional call is made on the cursor.fetchall   method to extract the results of the query and assign  them to the placeholder variable. Note the fetchall   method is used because it’s expected the raw SQL  query will return multiple record results.  Next, observe how the results of raw SQL query in all_drinks are accessed by multiple indexes. Since   the Python DB API cursor.fetchall   method makes no use of field names or other references, the first  index represents a record in the result and the second index represents a field value from a given record.  Model Managers  As you’ve learned throughout the examples presented in this and the previous chapter, a Django model’s  objects reference or default model manager offers an extensive array of functionalities to execute database  operations.  8https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Cursor_ databases   396   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Under most circumstances, Django models don’t require any modifications to their default model   manager or objects reference. However, there can be circumstances where the need arises to customize a  Django model’s default model manager or inclusively create multiple model managers.  Custom and Multiple Model Managers One of the main reasons to create custom Django model managers is to add custom manager methods, to  make the execution of recurring queries on a model easier.  For example, running queries such as Item.objects.filter menu__name='Sandwiches'  or Item.  objects.filter menu__name='Salads'  is simple, but if you start writing these same queries over and over,  the process can become tiresome and error prone. This is particularly true for raw SQL queries, which take  more time to write and have a higher degree of complexity.  A custom manager method allows you to write a query once as part of a model, and later invoke the   custom manager method – just like other model manager methods  e.g., all  , filter  , exclude    – to  trigger the query. Listing 8-61 illustrates a custom model manager class with a custom method, including a  model that uses it, in addition to various model manager calls.  Listing 8-61.  Django custom model manager with custom manager methods  from django.db import models   Create custom model manager class ItemMenuManager models.Manager :     def salad_items self :         return self.filter menu__name='Salads'       def sandwich_items self :         return self.filter menu__name='Sandwiches'        Option 1  Override default model manager class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30      ...     objects = ItemMenuManager     Queries on default custom model manager Item.objects.all   Item.objects.salad_items   Item.objects.sandwich_items     Option 2  Create new model manager field and leave default model manager as is     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30      ...     objects = models.Manager       menumgr = ItemMenuManager    397   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers   Queries on default and custom model managers Item.objects.all   Item.menumgr.salad_items   Item.menumgr.sandwich_items    ERROR Item.objects.salad_items    'Manager' object has no attribute 'salad_items'  ERROR Item.objects.sandwich_items    'Manager' object has no attribute 'sandwich_items' Item.menumgr.all    The first class in Listing 8-61 is the ItemMenuManager that functions as a custom model manager. Notice   how this class inherits its behavior from the models.Manager class, which is what gives it model manager  behavior. Next, the ItemMenuManager class declares two methods that return QuerySet results. Notice  how the class methods reference self – representing the model class instance – and call standard model  methods to trigger database queries.  It’s worth mentioning custom model managers don’t necessarily need to use native model queries or   return QuerySet data structures, and custom model managers can equally contain any logic  e.g., Python DB  API calls  or return any data structure  e.g., Python tuples .  Once you have a custom model manager there are two options to assign it to a model class. The first   option, illustrated in Listing 8-61, consists of overriding a model’s default model manager objects and  explicitly assigning it a custom model manager. Once this is done, you can use the same objects reference  to call the custom model manager methods. In addition, notice in Listing 8-61 that even when overriding the  default model manager objects, a model continues to have access to the built-in model manager methods   e.g., all    because the custom model inherits its behavior from the parent models.Manager class.  Next, Listing 8-61 illustrates the second option to integrate a custom model manager. This option   consists of adding a new model field to reference a custom manager and leave the default manager objects  as is. In this case, the custom model manager methods become accessible through the new field reference   e.g., Item.menumgr.salad_items    and the objects reference continues to work with its default behavior.     Tip   When you declare multiple model managers in a model, you can set the default model manager using  the default_manager_name meta option. see the previous chapter for additional details on model meta options.     Warning  if you don’t define a default model manager in a multi-manager model, Django choose the first  manager declared in the model. this can have unexpected behaviors in model operations that can’t explicitly  choose model managers  e.g., dumpdata  unlike queries that can use dot notation to choose a model manager.  Custom Model Managers and QuerySet Classes with Methods Model managers are closely tied to methods that return QuerySet data structures. As you’ve seen, nearly  all methods chained to the default model manager objects  e.g., all  , filter    generate QuerySet data  structures. When you create custom model managers, it’s possible to override the default behavior for these  QuerySet methods, as well as create your own custom QuerySet classes and methods.  One of the most important QuerySet methods in model managers is the get_queryset   method,   used to define a model’s initial QuerySet or what’s returned by a model manager’s all   method. In custom  model managers, the get_queryset   method is particularly important because it lets you filter the initial  QuerySet depending on the purpose of a model manager.  398   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  Listing 8-62 illustrates multiple custom model managers that define custom logic for the get_  queryset   method.  Listing 8-62.  Django custom model managers with custom get_queryset   method  class SanDiegoStoreManager models.Manager :     def get_queryset self :         return super SanDiegoStoreManager, self .get_queryset  .filter city='San Diego'   class LosAngelesStoreManager models.Manager :     def get_queryset self :         return super LosAngelesStoreManager, self .get_queryset  .filter city='Los Angeles'       class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30          ...     objects = models.Manager       sandiego = SanDiegoStoreManager       losangeles = LosAngelesStoreManager     Call default manager all   query, backed by get_queryset   method Store.objects.all    Call sandiego manager all  , backed by get_queryset   method Store.sandiego.all    Call losangeles manager all  , backed by get_queryset   method Store.losangeles.all    The first two classes in Listing 8-62 represent custom model managers; however, notice that unlike the   custom model manager in Listing 8-61, both the SanDiegoStoreManager and LosAngelesStoreManager  classes define the get_queryset   method. In both cases, the get_queryset   method returns a QuerySet  generated by calling the parent model manager get_queryset   method  i.e., all    – via the super    method – and applying an additional filter   to the parent depending on the purpose of the custom model  manager  e.g., get stores by city .  Once the custom managers are defined, Listing 8-62 declares the custom model managers as separate   fields in the Store model class. Finally, in Listing 8-62 you can see calls made to each of the model managers  using the all   method, which return the appropriate filtered results depending on the logic of the backing  get_queryset   method.  An alternative to multiple custom model managers is to create a single custom manager and rely on   a custom QuerySet class and methods to execute the same logic, a technique that’s illustrated in Listing 8-63.  Listing 8-63.  Django custom model manager with custom QuerySet class and methods  class StoreQuerySet models.QuerySet :     def sandiego self :         return self.filter city='San Diego'       def losangeles self :         return self.filter city='Los Angeles'   class StoreManager models.Manager :     def get_queryset self :         return StoreQuerySet self.model, using=self._db   399   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers      def sandiego self :         return self.get_queryset  .sandiego        def losangeles self :         return self.get_queryset  .losangeles    class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30          ...     objects = models.Manager       shops = StoreManager    Store.shops.all   Store.shops.sandiego   Store.shops.losangeles    The StoreQuerySet class in Listing 8-63 is a custom QuerySet class that defines the sandiego     and losangeles   methods, both of which apply additional filters to its base QuerySet. Once you have a  QuerySet class, it’s necessary to associate it with a custom model manager. In Listing 8-63, you can see the  StoreManager class represents a custom model manager, which defines its get_queryset   method to set its  initial data through the custom StoreQuerySet class.  Next, notice how the custom model manager StoreManager class defines the additional sandiego     and losangeles   methods, which are hooked up to call the methods by the same name in the custom  StoreQuerySet class.  Finally, the custom model manager StoreManager is set up as the shops field in the Store model class,  where you can observe how calls are made via the shops reference to trigger the query methods backed by  the custom StoreQuerySet class.  As helpful as the technique in Listing 8-63 is to cut down on the amount of model managers, if you look  carefully at Listing 8-63, there’s still a fair amount of redundancy declaring similar named methods for both  a custom model manager and a custom QuerySet class.  To cut down on redundant methods when using custom model managers and custom QuerySet classes,   the latter type of class offers the as_manager   method to automatically convert a QuerySet class into a  custom model manager, a technique that’s illustrated in Listing 8-64.  Listing 8-64.  Django custom model manager with custom QuerySet converted to manager  class StoreQuerySet models.QuerySet :     def sandiego self :         return self.filter city='San Diego'       def losangeles self :         return self.filter city='Los Angeles'   class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30          ...     objects = models.Manager       shops =  StoreQuerySet.as_manager    Store.shops.all   Store.shops.sandiego   Store.shops.losangeles    400   Chapter 8   Django MoDel Queries anD Managers  The example in Listing 8-64 defines the same custom QuerySet class as the one in Listing 8-63; however,  notice the lack of a custom model manager class. Instead, the Store model definition in Listing 8-64 directly  references the custom StoreQuerySet class and calls the as_manager   on it to convert the QuerySet class  into a model manager. Finally, notice how the calls made via the shops reference are identical to the ones in  Listing 8-63. In this manner, the technique in Listing 8-64 saves you the additional work of creating explicit  custom model managers if you’re using custom QuerySet classes.  Custom Reverse Model Managers for Related Models Earlier in the CRUD relationship records subsection, you learned how models that have relationships  between one another use reverse queries or _set syntax to execute operations from the model that doesn’t  have the relationship definition.  These reverse operations are executed by a model manager dubbed RelatedManager, which is a   subclass of a model’s default manager. This means all reverse queries or _set syntax calls are based on the  objects model manager reference or whatever default model manager is used by a model.  If you configure a default model manager on a model, then all the reverse operations on a model will  automatically use this same manager. However, it’s possible to define a custom model manager exclusively  for reverse operations, while ignoring the default model manager. This technique consists of explicitly  declaring a model manager as part of the reverse operation, as shown in Listing 8-65.  Listing 8-65.  Django custom model manager for reverse query operations  from django.db import models  class Item models.Model :     ...     objects = models.Manager     Default manager for direct queries     reverseitems = CustomReverseManagerForItems    Custom Manager for reverse queries   Get Menu record named Breakfast breakfast_menu = Menu.objects.get name='Breakfast'    Fetch all Item records in the Menu, using Item custom model manager for reverse queries breakfast_menu.item_set manager='reverseitems' .all    Call on_sale_items   custom manager method in CustomReverseManagerForItems   breakfast_menu.item_set manager='reverseitems' .on_sale_items    Listing 8-65 first declares the Item model with its default objects model manager and a custom model   manager assigned to the reverseitems field. Next, a query is made to get a Menu record, followed by various  queries to get the Menu record’s related Item records via the reverse _set syntax.  However, notice how the reverse query operation in Listing 8-65 with _set syntax uses the manager  argument to indicate which model manager to use for reverse operations; in this case, the reverseitems  model manager is used to execute the queries, instead of the default objects model manager.  401   CHAPTER 9  Django Model Forms and   Class Views  In the previous two chapters you learned how Django models are used to move data between a relational  database and a Django project. Although this is the main purpose of Django models, there’s another  important set of functionalities fulfilled by Django models that isn’t tied directly to a database.  In this chapter you’ll learn how to create Django forms parting from Django models, a process that   further extends Django’s DRY  Don’t Repeat Yourself  principle. You’ll learn how a Django model can  produce a Django form, including its fields, validations, and also save its data to a database, all without  writing many of the form scaffolding logic described in Chapter 6.  Next, you’ll learn about Django class-based views with models. Although you can continue to use the   Django view techniques covered in Chapter 2 – just like the form techniques in Chapter 6 – with a firm  grasp of Django models, you can further apply the Django DRY principle to views. You’ll learn how to create  class-based views to execute model CRUD operations, in turn, reducing the amount of logic required to  incorporate model CRUD operations in views.  Django Model Form Structure and Workflow  Django models represent the standard way to move data into and out of a database. But as you’ve learned  throughout the previous two chapters, the phase of moving data into and out of a database requires you to  programmatically manipulate model records  e.g., inside view methods in views.py files  to execute the  needed CRUD operation on a model.  While this is a perfectly valid workflow for any web framework, you can improve this process of moving  data into and out of a database by linking Django models to a more natural input output mechanism: forms.  Once you programmatically create enough Django model records in real-life projects, you’ll see a   pattern emerge: the logic behind most Django model operations is dictated by user interactions. Either an  end user creates an Order model record, an end user reads a Store model record, an administrator updates  a Menu model record, or an administrator deletes an Item model record. And what do these end users and  administrators use to communicate these model operations? Exactly, forms in a user interface  UI .  Now let’s take a look at the flip side of linking forms to models. In Chapter 6 you learned about Django   forms, but did you realize what’s the most likely operation you’re going to do with the form data after its  processed? You’re most likely to save it to a database, which involves Django models.  So in the spirit of Django’s DRY principle, model forms offer a way to use a Django model as the   foundation to produce a Django form to execute CRUD operations on a Django model. In other words,  instead of creating a stand-alone Django form and then creating the necessary 'glue' code to create a Django  model instance, or vice versa, creating a stand-alone Django model and then creating the necessary form to  do CRUD operations on a model record, Django model forms allow you to not repeat yourself.    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_9  403   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Create Django Model Forms  Back in Chapter 6 you created a Django form to capture a name, email, and comment. Next, we’ll redesign  this form as a model form to be able to quickly save the data to a database.  The first step to create a model form is to create a model as the foundation for the data. Listing 9-1   illustrates a Django model class and immediately after a Django model form created from the model.   Consult the book’s accompanying source code to run the exercises, in order to reduce typing and      Tip  automatically access test data.  Listing 9-1.  Django model class and model form  from django import forms  class Contact models.Model :       name = models.CharField max_length=50,blank=True        email = models.EmailField           comment = models.CharField max_length=1000   class ContactForm forms.ModelForm :       class Meta:                   model = Contact             fields = '__all__'  The first important aspect of Listing 9-1 is the Django model follows the standard model syntax, with  three fields that use model fields to restrict the type of data stored by the model. The model in Listing 9-1  is kept simple to better illustrate model forms, but it’s possible to add any other model functionality you  learned in the previous two chapters  e.g., validators, clean methods, Meta options .  Next in Listing 9-1 is the ContactForm class that represents the form and which inherits its behavior   from the django.forms.ModelForm class, the last of which is what makes it a model form. Notice the  ContactForm class lacks any form fields like those you learned in Chapter 6 in Table 6-2; instead it declares a  Meta class section like the one used in models.  The Meta class section for the ContactForm specifies two options: model and fields. The model option  indicates which model to use to generate the form, in this case, the Contact model also in Listing 9-1. The  fields option indicates which model fields to use to generate the form, in the case, '__all__' tells Django  to use all the model fields in the model.  The powerful aspect of ContactForm in Listing 9-1 is it uses two statements to create a form that reflects  the same field types as the Contact model. Not only does this avoid repeating yourself  e.g., typing in explicit  form fields , the form fields also inherit the validation behaviors of the model  e.g., models.EmailField    get translated into forms.EmailField . But I’ll describe more details and options about this model-to-form  inheritance behavior shortly, once I finish describing the basics of model forms.  Once you have a model form class, you might be wondering how does its processing differ from a   standard Django form? Very little actually; the same concepts you learned in Chapter 6 to process, validate,  and lay out forms are just as valid for model forms, as shown in Listing 9-2.  404   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Listing 9-2.  Django model form processing   views.py method to process model form def contact request :     if request.method == 'POST':          POST, generate bound form with data from the request         form = ContactForm request.POST           check if it's valid:         if form.is_valid  :              Insert into DB             form.save                redirect to a new URL:             return HttpResponseRedirect ' about contact thankyou'      else:          GET, generate unbound  blank  form         form = ContactForm       return render request,'about contact.html',{'form':form}    See chapter 6 for form layout template syntax in about contact.html  In Listing 9-2 you can see the view method sequence follows the same pattern as a standard Django  form. When a user makes a GET request on the view method, an unbound form instance is created that is  sent to the user and rendered via the about contact.html template. Next, when a user submits the form via  a POST request, a bound form is created using the request.POST argument, which is then validated using  the is_valid   method. If the form values are invalid, the bound form with errors is returned to the user  so he can correct the mistakes, and if the form values are valid, in the specific case of Listing 9-2, the user is  redirected to the  about contact thankyou page.  However, there’s one important processing difference in model forms that’s bolded out in Listing 9-2.  After a form’s values are determined to be valid, a call is made to the save   on the model form instance.  This save   method is tied to a form’s backing model save   method, which means the form data is  structured as a model record and saved to the database.  As you can realize, this process to create and process a model form is a real time saver vs. having to a   create and process a stand-alone form and a stand-alone model.  Django Model Form Options and Field Mapping  Now that you understand the basic operation of model forms, let’s take a look at its various options. Most  model form options are declared in the Meta class statement, as you saw in Listing 9-1. However, it’s also  possible to declare regular form fields, to either override the default model field behavior or include new  form fields altogether.  Model Form Required Options: Model and Fields or Exclude Model forms inherit their behavior from the forms.ModelForm class – instead of the standard forms.Form  class – therefore Django always expect a model on which to base the form, which is the purpose of the meta  model option. Therefore a model option value is always a requirement of model forms.  405   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Django doesn’t expect the structure of a model to fit perfectly with a form, to the point Django also  expects you to explicitly tell it which fields of the backing model should or shouldn’t become part of the  model form. This is achieved with either the fields option – to indicate which model fields become part of  the model form – of the exclude option – to indicate which model fields shouldn’t become part of the model  form. The fields or exclude option is always required, even when a model form will contain all fields of the  backing model. Notice how the model form example in Listing 9-1 declares the option fields='__all__' to  create a model form that captures the same set of fields as its backing model.  When you declare a model form with something other than fields='__all__'  e.g., a shortened list  of model fields  or the exclude option  e.g., a list of model fields to omit in the form , be aware that you’re  willfully and potentially breaking a model’s rules. For example, by default all model fields are required, so  if you create a model form that omits certain fields – either with fields or exclude – the form itself can  appear normal, but the model form will never successfully finish its standard workflow, unless you manually  add the omitted fields. Under such circumstances, end users will see an ‘invalid form error’ because the  model part of the form is broken due to a required model field value. The upcoming section on model form  validation and initialization describes how to manually add omitted field values to model forms.  As you can see, you can create a model form with more or less fields than its backing model. In addition,   it’s also possible to add new fields to a model form – which aren’t part of a backing model – as well as  customize the default form field produced by a model field.  In order to describe a solution to these last two scenarios, the next section describes the different form  fields produced by each model field – so you can determine if you need to customize the default behavior -  and the subsequent section describes how to customize and add new fields to a model form.  Model Form Default Field Mapping Models forms follow certain rules to transform model field data types – described in Table 7-1 – into form  field data types – described in Table 6-2. In most cases, model field data types get transformed into mirror- like equivalent form field data types. For example, if a model field uses the models.CharField data type, a  model form converts this field to a forms.CharField data type.  Table 9-1 illustrates the model form mapping used between model data types and form data types. Note  that data types with mirror-like data type mappings between models and forms are enclosed in the first line  in Table 9-1.  406   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Table 9-1.  Model form data type mapping between models and forms  Model field  Form field  models.BooleanField models.DateField models.DateTimeField models.DecimalField models.EmailField models.FileField models.FilePathField models.FloatField models.ImageField models.IntegerField models.IPAddressField models.GenericIPAddressField models.NullBooleanField models.SlugField models.TimeField models.URLField models.AutoField models.BigAutoField models.BigIntegerField  models.CharField  models.CommaSeparatedIntegerField models.ForeignKey models.ManyToManyField models.PositiveIntegerField models.PositiveSmallIntegerField models.SmallIntegerField  forms.BooleanField forms.DateField forms.DateTimeField forms.DecimalField forms.EmailField forms.FileField forms.FilePathField forms.FloatField forms.ImageField forms.IntegerField forms.IPAddressField forms.GenericIPAddressField forms.NullBooleanField forms.SlugField forms.TimeField forms.URLField Not represented in the form, because Auto-model fields are  generated by the database. forms.IntegerField, with min_value set to  -9223372036854775808 and max_value set to  9223372036854775807  forms.CharField, with max_length set to the model field’s  max_length and empty_value set to None if null=True forms.CharField forms.ModelChoiceField forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField forms.IntegerField, with min_value set to 0 forms.IntegerField, with min_value set to 0 forms.IntegerField  models.TextField  forms.CharField, with widget=forms.Textarea  As you can see in Table 9-1, over 50% of Django model data types map directly to equivalent form data   types. Most of the remaining model data types map to slightly adjusted form data types to better fit the  backing model type  e.g., models.PositiveIntegerField maps to a forms.IntegerField but with a form  min_value value of 0 .  It’s only four model data types in Table 9-1 that don’t map directly to form data types described in  Chapter 6 in Table 6-2. The models.AutoField and models.BigAutoField model data types are never  represented in model forms, for the simple reason their values are auto-assigned by a database, so they have  no place to be input in forms. The models.ForeignKey and models.ManyToManyField model data types  represent model relationships, which means their data comes from separate models. In turn, the models. ForeignKey and models.ManyToManyField model data types don’t map to regular form field for strings or  numbers, but rather form fields that represent other model data, which is the purpose of the special form  data types: forms.ModelChoiceField and forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField. These two last form fields are  described in the later subsection on model forms with relationships.  407   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views      Tip  to consult the htMl produced by a form field data type  e.g.,   consult table 6-2,  which contains the mapping between form fields and form widgets, the last of which produces the actual form  htMl markup.  Model Form New and Custom Fields: Widgets, Labels, help_texts,   error_messages, field_classes, and localize_fields Now that you know how all model fields are transformed into form fields in a model form, let’s address how  to add and customize form fields in a model form.  Adding a new form field to a model form is as simple as declaring a form field as if it were a regular   form. It’s also possible to customize the default form field data type used by a model field data type    i.e., the mappings in Table 9-1 , by declaring a new form field with the same name as a model field, to take  precedence over the default model-form field mapping.  Listing 9-3 illustrates the Django model class and model form from Listing 9-1, updated to include a   new form field and a form field that overrides a default model-form field mapping.  Listing 9-3.  Django model form with new and custom field  from django import forms  def faq_suggestions value :        Validate value and raise forms.ValidationError for invalid values       pass       class Contact models.Model :       name = models.CharField max_length=50,blank=True        email = models.EmailField           comment = models.CharField    class ContactForm forms.ModelForm :       age = forms.IntegerField         comment = forms.CharField widget=forms.Textarea,validators=[faq_suggestions]        class Meta:                   model = Contact             fields = '__all__'  Listing 9-3 first adds the new age form field to capture an integer value in the form. Although the   underlying Contact model is never aware of the age field or value, with this modification the model form will  require this field to be provided as part of the form workflow.  Next in Listing 9-3 is the comment form field, which overrides the underlying model field by the same   name. In this case, overriding the comment form field has the purpose of adding a custom widget, as well as  adding a custom validators method to verify the comment value before the form is deemed valid – note that  both the widget and validators options are standard form options described in Chapter 6.  The form field overriding mechanism in Listing 9-3 has both an advantage and disadvantage. The   advantage is you get full control of the form field to define any options. The disadvantage is a model field  option’s  e.g., max_length  – that would be passed to the form field – are lost and need to be redeclared as  part of the new form field statement.  408   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   To preserve a model field’s underlying behavior and still be able to customize certain form field options,   model forms support additional meta class options besides the model, fields, and exclude options.  Listing 9-4 illustrates a model form’s additional meta options to override the default model-form field  mapping, while keeping the underlying model field behavior.  Listing 9-4.  Django model form with meta options to override default form field behavior  from django import forms  class Contact models.Model :       name = models.CharField max_length=50,blank=True        email = models.EmailField           comment = models.CharField    class ContactForm forms.ModelForm :       class Meta:                   model = Contact             fields = '__all__'             widgets = {                'name': models.CharField max_length=25 ,                'comment': form.Textarea attrs={'cols': 100, 'rows': 40}              }             labels = {                'name': 'Full name',                'comment': 'Issue'             }             help_texts = {                'comment': 'Provide a detailed account of the issue to receive a quick answer'             }             error_messages = {                'name': {                'max_length': "Name can only be 25 characters in length"                 }             }             field_classes = {                'email': EmailCoffeehouseFormField             },             localized_fields = '__all__'  The most important aspect of the meta model form options in Listing 9-4 is they’re pluralized names  of the form field options described in Chapter 6. The highlighted model form meta options in Listing 9-4  are pluralized because they can declare options for multiple form fields as a dictionary, where each key  represents the form field name and its value the option value.  For example, the widgets and labels meta options in Listing 9-4 define custom widgets and labels for   both the name and comment model form fields. The help_texts meta option defines the help_text option for  the comment model form field, while the error_messages meta option declares a custom form error message  for the max_length key error on the name model form field.  Next, the field_classes meta option in Listing 9-4 is used to declare a custom form field for the email   model form field. Finally, the localized_field meta option in Listing 9-4 is set to __all__ to tell Django  to localize  i.e., convert into a different language  all model form fields. If the localized_field option is  omitted, then model form fields are not localized. It’s worth mentioning you can selectively localize certain  model form fields by passing a list of model form fields to the localized_field option, just like it’s done  with the fields and exclude options.  409   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Django Model Forms with Relationships  As you learned in the previous two chapters, Django models can have relationships between one another,  which in turn makes models have a data type  e.g., ForeignKey, ManyToManyField  that references records in  another model.  When models containing such data types are used in the context of model forms, Django relies on two  special form fields. By default, ForeignKey model fields are converted to ModelChoiceField form fields, and  ManyToManyField model fields are converted to ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields.  The benefit of the ModelChoiceField and ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields is that they generate   a form field based on a Django model query. So instead of manually populating a form field with model  data, the ModelChoiceField and ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields generate a friendly HTML      input field with model records.  ModelChoiceField and ModelMultipleChoiceField Form Field  Options: queryset, empty_label, to_field_name, and   label_from_instance   ModelChoiceField and ModelMultipleChoiceField are standard form fields usable on any Django      Tip  form that requires model data. they are used by default on model forms with relationships, but they’re not  restricted to model forms  i.e., forms inherited from forms.ModelForm .     Note   ModelChoiceField and ModelMultipleChoiceField being standard form fields  i.e., part of the  Django forms package , also accept the standard form options: required, widget, label, initial, help_text, and  limit_choices_to – described in Chapter 6.  Since ModelChoiceField and ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields use model records to source their   data, they unequivocally require a model query. For model forms that inherit their behavior from forms. ModelForm and their underlying models contain a ForeignKey or ManyToManyField model field, this model  query is set automatically. For example, if an Item model contains a ForeignKey to a Menu model, an Item  model form presents all Menu records in a form to allow users to select a single Menu record. Similarly, if a  Store model contains a ManyToManField to an Amenity model, a Store model form presents all Amenity  records in a form to allow users to select multiple Amenity records.  While this behavior is acceptable in most circumstances, it can be necessary to provide an explicit query   to ModelChoiceField or ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields, either when you need to filter the default  behavior to use all model records on a model form field or when these form fields are used in a regular form   i.e., that inherits forms.Form .  Listing 9-5 illustrates the two techniques to set a model query on either the ModelChoiceField and   ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields using the queryset option.  Listing 9-5.  Django model form and standard form with custom query for ModelChoiceField and  ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields  from django import forms from coffeehouse.stores.models import Amenity  410   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      def __str__ self :         return "%s" %  self.name   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100   class ItemForm forms.ModelForm :     menu = forms.ModelChoiceField queryset=Menu.objects.filter id=1       class Meta:                model = Item         fields = '__all__'  class StoreForm forms.Form :     name = forms.CharField           address = forms.CharField       amenities = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset=None      def __init__ self, *args, **kwargs :         super StoreForm, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs          self.fields['amenities'].queryset = Amenity.objects.filter name__contains='W'   The first technique in Listing 9-5 defines an inline queryset value by overriding the menu field with a   custom ModelChoiceField   on the ItemForm model form. In this case, instead of the ItemForm model form  having a menu field with all Item records, the menu field is restricted to only the Item record with id=1.  The second technique in Listing 9-5 defines an empty queryset value on a standard form that uses  a forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField   form field on the amenities field. But inside the form’s __init__  method, the amenities field is set to a query that restricts its records to Amenity records that contain the  letter W.  It’s worth mentioning, both queryset techniques illustrated in Listing 9-5 are equally valid in both   model forms and regular forms, as well as ModelChoiceField   and ModelMultipleChoiceField   form  fields.  By default, ModelChoiceField   form fields that don’t define an initial value are generated with the  empty HTML  ---------  choice as the default field value. It’s possible to customize the  value of this empty option with the empty_label option  e.g., empty_label='Please select a value', to  output  Please select a value  . It’s also possible to disable the inclusion of this empty  option with empty_label=None.  By default, both ModelChoiceField   and ModelMultipleChoiceField   form fields generate their   HTML     input field values from a model record’s primary key value  i.e., id  and model  __str__ method representation. For example, given the Menu model definition in Listing 9-5, an HTML      input field for this model would look like the following snippet:          ---------        Breakfast        Salads        Sandwiches        Drinks     411   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Note each   value corresponds to a record’s primary key id value and the   text   corresponds to a record’s name field returned by the model’s __str__ method.  It’s possible to customize the   value used in both ModelChoiceField   and   ModelMultipleChoiceField   form fields with the to_field_name option. For example, setting to_field_ name='name' in the context of this last snippet, changes the HTML     input field to the  format  Breakfast .   Using a to_field_name value breaks the underlying model form’s ability to be saved to the      Caution  database, since the model’s relationship value is set to a different value than the primary key expected by the  model relationship.  In addition to customizing the   value, it’s also possible to customize the   text in form  fields to something other than a model’s __str__ method, by overriding a label_form_instance method in  either a ModelChoiceField   and ModelMultipleChoiceField   form field. Listing 9-6 illustrate a custom  form field designed for this purpose.  Listing 9-6.  Django custom form field to customize   text for ModelChoiceField and  ModelMultipleChoiceField form fields  from django import forms from django.forms import ModelChoiceField  class MenuModelChoiceField ModelChoiceField :     def label_from_instance self, obj :         return "Menu %s  %s" %  obj.id,obj.name   class ItemForm forms.ModelForm :     menu = MenuModelChoiceField queryset=Menu.objects.all        class Meta:               model = Item         fields = '__all__'   HTML menu form field output      ---------     Menu 1  Breakfast     Menu 2  Salads     Menu 3  Sandwiches     Menu 4  Drinks     The first step in Listing 9-6 creates the MenuModelChoiceField custom form field that inherits its  behavior from the ModelChoiceField form field and defines an implementation for the label_from_ instance method. In this case, the label_from_instance method tells Django to generate   text  values prefixed with the Menu  static string, followed by a model’s id and name. Note this same technique  can be used to customize a ModelMultipleChoiceField, just make sure to change the custom form field’s  inheriting class.  412   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Next, the MenuModelChoiceField custom form field in Listing 9-6 is added to the ItemForm model form   in the same listing through the menu field. Because MenuModelChoiceField is a custom ModelChoiceField  form field, it’s necessary to specify an explicit queryset value to populate the form field, which in this case  corresponds to all Menu model records.  Finally, Listing 9-6 illustrates the HTML   text output for the menu field follows the pattern   defined in the custom MenuModelChoiceField custom form field.  Django Model Form Processing  Now that you have a solid understanding of the various model form options, it’s time to take a deeper look at  model form processing, which was briefly introduced in Listing 9-2.  The most important factor to take into account when processing model forms is you’re working with  two entities: a form and a model. In the model form processing example presented in Listing 9-2, this fact  isn’t too obvious, mainly because the form fits the backing model perfectly. However, when you modify any  of the model form parts, working with a single reference that represents both a form and a model can require  more forethought.  Model Form Initialization: Initial and Instance Model forms can use two initialization parameters: initial and instance. The initial argument works  just like the standard initial form argument – described in Chapter 6 – providing the initial values for an  unbound form. The instance argument is used to initialize a model form with a model instance, which in  turn is also used to initialize the values of an unbound form.  In all model forms, as you learned in the previous sections, form definitions take precedence over any  underlying model definitions. This means all model form values in the initial argument take precedence  over values defined via the instance argument. Listing 9-7 illustrates a model form initialization sequence  using both the initial and instance parameters.  Listing 9-7.  Django model form initialization with initial and instance  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  preloaded_item = Item.objects.get id=1    Model form from Listing 9-6, initialize with instance form = ItemForm instance=preloaded_item    Unbound form set up with instance values form.as_p           Menu:                         ---------                    Menu 1  Breakfast               Menu 2  Salads               Menu 3  Sandwiches               Menu 4  Drinks                  413   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views            Name:            <input type="text" name="name"                value="Whole-Grain Oatmeal" required maxlength="30" id="id_name"  >            Remaining fields committed for brevity   Model form from Listing 9-6, initialize with instance and override with initial form2 = ItemForm initial={'menu':3},instance=preloaded_item    Unbound form set up with instance values form2.as_p     Unbound form set up with instance values, but overridden with initial form2.as_p           Menu:                         ---------                    Menu 1  Breakfast               Menu 2  Salads               Menu 3  Sandwiches               Menu 4  Drinks                     Remaining fields committed for brevity  The first step in Listing 9-7 is to obtain an Item model record to populate the ItemForm model form; in   this case, a query is made to get the Item model record with id=1. Next, the Item model record is used to  initialize the model form with the instance values. In Listing 9-7, the form is output with the standard as_p    form method, where you can confirm the form fields are preselected to reflect the underlying model record.  Next in Listing 9-7 is an initialization sequence for the same ItemForm model form, but which also   uses the initial argument in combination with the instance argument. In this case, because the initial  argument provides the 'menu':3 value, the unbound form’s menu field is set to a value of 3, instead of the  model record’s instance menu value of 1. Thus confirming the initial argument values take precedence over  instance argument values.  Note that it’s equally valid to only use the initial argument – without the instance argument – to   initialize a model form as if it were a regular form. At the initialization phase of a model form, the model part  of the form is unaware of any values, it’s only until the model form enters its validation phase the underlying  model is made of aware of any form values.  Model Form Validation Similar to model form initialization, model form validation can appear to be intertwined because you’re  dealing with a single variable that references both a form and a model. But as long as you’re aware of the  fundamental steps of form validation – described in Chapter 6 – and model validation – described in   Chapter 7 – model form validation is straightforward.  414   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Back in Listing 9-2, you learned how a model form is converted to a bound form  i.e., a form containing   user data  by passing the request.POST value in a view method  e.g., ContactForm request.POST  . Once  you have a bound form, the standard Django form validation workflow continues to apply for model forms:  a call is made to the is_valid   method on the form reference to validate the user submitted data against  form validation rules. If any of the form rules don’t comply, an errors dictionary is added to the form  reference with the causes, which makes its way back to the user as a re-rendered form with the errors. If the  is_valid   method succeeds, the processing logic of the model form can move to the next step.  Once a model form passes the is_valid   method test, you can actually use the same standard  form cleaned_data   method to gain access to a dictionary with the contents of the valid form data   e.g., form.cleaned_data   contains {'name': '...','email': '...','comment': '...', } .   But since you’re working with a model form, the step you’re more likely take is to use the form data to  further interact with a model.  To facilitate this process, Django adds the instance field to the form reference, containing the form   data structured as an instance of the underlying model of the model form. The instance field is particularly  important when you need or must manipulate the model data prior to attempting a model operation. And  this is the most critical aspect of the model form validation process: even after the form is_valid   method  passes and the data is used to structure a model instance in the instance field, this model instance data  must still undergo model validation or risk being rejected by the backing model validation rules.  For straightforward model form scenarios, where a model and form map directly to one another – like   the one in Listing 9-2 – manipulating the instance field is unnecessary  e.g., Right after the form is_valid    method passes, you can call the save   method on the form reference to save the model instance in  instance . But for model forms where the model and form differ in the amount of fields, you’ll need to  perform additional logic after the form is_valid   method passes and before a called is made to the model  form’s save   method.  Listing 9-8 illustrates two validation procedures for a model form where the form omits fields from the   underlying model.  Listing 9-8.  Django model form with reduced form that requires model update before saving  from django import forms from django.conf import settings  class Contact models.Model :       user = models.ForeignKey settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, null=True, default=None        name = models.CharField max_length=50,blank=True        email = models.EmailField           comment = models.CharField    class ContactForm forms.ModelForm :       class Meta:                   model = Contact             exclude = ['user']   Option 1  Form model processing with missing value assigned with instance          if form.is_valid  :              Check if user is available             if request.user.is_authenticated  :                  Add missing user to model form                 form.instance.user = request.user              Insert into DB             form.save    415   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views    Option 2  Form model processing with missing value assigned after model form sequence              if form.is_valid  :              Save instance but don't commit until model instance is complete              form.save   returns a materialized model instance that has yet to be saved             pending_contact = form.save commit=False                Check if user is available             if request.user.is_authenticated  :                  Add missing user to model form                 pending_contact.user = request.user              Insert into DB             pending_contact.save    The Contact model in Listing 9-8 is similar to the model class used in previous listings, but has   the additional user field to register a Django user as part of the model record. Next, in Listing 9-8 is the  ContactForm model form – based on this last Contact model – which uses the exclude option to omit the  user model field from the form.  Because you’re purposely omitting the user field from the model form, an end user will have no way of  providing it – even in the unlikely case he would know his internal user. Therefore, as part of the validation  process, it’s necessary to update the model to contain the internal user, which is always available in the  request reference of a view method.  In the first validation sequence in Listing 9-8, you can see that after the model form passes the is_  valid   method, a quick check is made to confirm if the user is authenticated; if so, the model’s instance  reference is accessed to update the user model field. Once this is done, the model form’s backing instance  contains a value for the omitted user field and upon calling the save   method, the model record is saved  with values for all its model fields.  The second validation sequence in Listing 9-8 uses the commit=False to materialize the model instance   of the model form without saving it to the database. Once this is done, the model form’s work is done, so  you’re left with a basic model record instance that needs to be updated and saved to the database. You can  see in Listing 9-8 an identical check is made to confirm if the user is authenticated, if so, the unsaved model  record user reference is updated and a final called is made to the model’s save   method to commit the  record to the database.  Django Model Formsets  Just as standard Django forms can be grouped together as a set in what’s called a formset, Django model  forms can also be grouped into what’s called a model formset. Similarly, just as Django model forms  resemble standard Django forms, model formsets also have a lot of similarities with standard formsets. Up next, I’ll describe the particularities of model formsets building on the knowledge presented in   the last part of Chapter 6 on standard formsets. So if you’re unfamiliar with formset terms  e.g., factory and  management form , go back and read this last section, as the following assumes you have prior knowledge  on these basic formset concepts.  Model Formset Factory The modelformset_factory   method is the centerpiece to working with model formsets. The  modelformset_factory   method can accept up to 19 arguments, 9 of which are identical to standard  formsets and the remaining ones specific to model formsets. The following snippet illustrates all the names  and default values for each argument in the modelormset_factory   method, with bolded text representing  model formset specific options.  416   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   modelformset_factory model, queryset=model.objects.all  ,                     form=ModelForm,fields=None, exclude=None,                   formset=BaseModelFormSet, extra=1, can_order=False, can_delete=False,                   max_num=None, min_num=None, validate_max=False, validate_min=False,                   widgets=None, localized_fields=None,labels=None,                   help_texts=None, error_messages=None,                   field_classes=None,formfield_callback=None   As you can confirm in this snippet, the only required argument  i.e., that doesn’t have a default value    for the modelformset_factory   method is model. The meaning for each argument is the following:  model.- Defines the model class on which to create a formset. queryset.- Defines the queryset to create a formset. By default, all model records are used to create the   formset  i.e., the model.objects.all   queryset if used .  fields.- Defines the model form fields to include as part of the model to create the model formset – just   like the fields meta model form option.  like the exclude meta model form option.  widgets meta model form option.  exclude.- Defines the model form fields to omit as part of the model to create the model formset – just   widgets.- Defines overriding widgets for the model form to create the model formset – just like the   localize_fields.- Defines model form fields to localize  i.e., support multiple languages  to create the   formset – just like the localize_fields meta model form option.  labels.- Defines overriding label for the model form to create the model formset – just like the labels   meta model form option.  help_texts meta model form option.  help_text.- Defines overriding help text for the model form to create the model formset – just like the   error_messages.- Defines overriding error messages for the model form to create the model formset –   just like the help_texts meta model form option.  like the field_classes meta model form option.  field_classes.- Defines overriding field classes for the model form to create the model formset – just   formsetfield_callback.- Defines a method to execute prior to creating a form field from a model field.   Generally used to customize a model form field – as described in the earlier model form section – in the  context of a formset.     Tip  see Chapter 6 for details on the additional modelformset_factory option, which were already described  in the standard formsets section.  Given that model formset logic is a combination of the model form techniques described earlier and formset   techniques described in Chapter 6, I won’t readdress the same techniques once again. You can look over the  book’s source code for a working model formset example in the source code for Chapter 9 under the online app.  Class-Based Views with Models  Back in Chapter 2, you learned how class-based views allow you to create views that operate with object- oriented programming  OOP  principles  e.g., encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance  leading to  greater reusability and shorter implementation times. Now that you know how Django models work, we can  address class-based views that integrate with models described in the last part of Table 2-10.  Unlike standard Django views – explored in the early sections of Chapter 2 – which allow open-ended   logic to process a request and generate a response, class-based views with models encapsulate the logic  performed against Django models in a more modular way.  417   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   For example, the logical patterns to create, read, update, and delete model instances in a standard   view method, generally follow a very consistent workflow: get input data from a url or form, execute CRUD  operation on the model, and send the response to a template.  In the spirit of Django’s DRY principle, class-based views with models offer a way to cut down on the  boilerplate code used in standard view methods and use class fields and methods to define the workflow  used for Django model CRUD operations.  Create Model Records with the Class-Based View CreateView As you’ve learned up to this point, the creation of Django model instances in real-life projects comes  accompanied by a series of constructs that can include model forms, GET POST request processing, and the  use of templates, among other things.  The Django CreateView class-based view is specifically designed to cut down on the amount of   boilerplate code needed to perform the creation of a model record. Listing 9-9 illustrates a class-based view  that uses the CreateView class.  Listing 9-9.  Django class-based view with CreateView to create model records   views.py from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView from .models import Item, ItemForm from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy  class ItemCreation CreateView :     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'    models.py from django import forms from django.db import models  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100   class ItemForm forms.ModelForm :     class Meta:         model = Item         fields = '__all__'         widgets = {             'description': forms.Textarea  ,         }   urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.items import views as items_views  418   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   urlpatterns = [     url r'^new $', items_views.ItemCreation.as_view  , name='new' , ]   templates items item_form.html               {% csrf_token %}         {{ form.as_p }}          Create         The first part in Listing 9-9 illustrates the ItemCreation class-based view that inherits its behavior from   the CreateView class. Notice this view lacks a request reference, processing logic, or return statement, all  of which were common in the standard view methods described in Chapter 2. So what is the ItemCreation  class-based view actually doing?  Because you know beforehand you want to create a model record, the CreateView class – used by the   ItemCreation class-based view – supports all the necessary boilerplate logic and requires a minimum set of  code to fulfill its model record creation logic.  The ItemCreation class-based view in Listing 9-9 uses the model field to tell Django to create Item   model records. In addition, the form_class field specifies the ItemForm form – also declared in Listing 9-9  – which is used to create model records. In addition, the success_url field is used to return control to the  item:index url when model record creation is successful.  WHY REVERSE_LAZY IN CLASS-BASED VIEWS,    INSTEAD OF REVERSE?  Due to the simultaneous import order of models, views, and urls in class-based views, using the  standard reverse   method to resolve url names can result in the error: django.core.exceptions. ImproperlyConfigured: The included URLconf ‘–----’ does not appear to have any patterns in it. If you  see valid patterns in the file then the issue is probably caused by a circular import.  the reverse_lazy method ensures any reverse url name resolution is attempted only after all models,  views, and urls have been properly imported; therefore it’s the common choice in the context of   class-based views.  You may still be left wondering, where are the save   and is_valid   methods for the ItemCreation  class-based view in Listing 9-9 if it’s creating model records? By default there aren’t any. Because you just  want to create a model record, the parent CreateView class takes care of this supporting logic.  The next part in Listing 9-9 contains the urly.py file with the hook to set up the class-based view into  the application. In this case, the ItemCreation class-based view is set to run on the  new url and is declared  as part of the url   method by using the class-based view as_view   method – note this url set up technique  is identical for all class-based views and was described toward the end of Chapter 2 for class-based views  without models.  So what happens when a user visits the  new url? Control is sent to the ItemCreation class-based    view. And because this view’s purpose is to create an Item model record, the class-based view looks for a  template to render the form, under the TEMPLATES directory path of a project following the convention      _form.html.  419   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   In the last part of Listing 9-9, you can see the template templates items item_form.html, where   templates represents a TEMPLATES directory path value, items the app name, and item the model name  defined for the class-based view. In addition, notice the contents of the item_form.html template use a  standard form layout, which you can adjust like any Django form.  So where is the POST form handler and error handling in Listing 9-9? By default, there isn’t any either.   Once a user gets an unbound form illustrated at the bottom of Listing 9-9, the form processing and validation  is taken care of behind the scenes by the ItemCreation class-based view. If the form contains errors, the  template is re-rendered – like any other form – using the same template in Listing 9-9. If the form data is valid,  form processing is deemed successful and the class-based view creates an Item model record – like a model  form – redirecting control to the item:index url defined in the class-based view success_url field.  As you can see in this example, a class-based view that inherits its behavior from the CreateView class,   cuts down the boilerplate code needed to a create model record.  CreateView Fields and Methods While at first glance a class-based view that inherits its behavior from the CreateView class can appear to be  inflexible, it’s possible to override its default behaviors like any Django construct.  As it turns out, the CreateView class inherits its behavior from many other Django class-based views,  which is what gives the CreateView class – and its implementing child classes like the class-based view in  Listing 9-9 – its behind-the-scene powers. The CreateView class inherits its behavior from the following  class-based view classes:  django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.base.TemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.edit.BaseCreateView django.views.generic.edit.ModelFormMixin django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin django.views.generic.edit.ProcessFormView django.views.generic.base.View  So why are these classes even important? Because they provide the default behavior for all CreateView   class-based views. The scant fields declared in the ItemCreation class-based view in Listing 9-9 are only  three fields for CreateView class-based views. It’s possible to declare over a dozen more fields and methods  – that belong to this past list of classes – to provide behaviors, such as using another template other than     _form.html; specifying the content type for the response  e.g., text csv ; custom  methods to run when a model form is valid or invalid; as well as declaring custom methods to manually  execute GET and POST workflow logic.     Note  a CreateView class-based view inherits many fields and methods from its parent classes. the following  options are the most common ones; for an exhaustive list consult each of the CreateView parent classes.  Basic CreateView options: Model, form_class, and success_url fields As you’ve already seen in Listing 9-9, the essential logic fulfilled by a CreateView class-based view is to  create a model record using a form, which in turn requires a basic set of parameters. First, the model field is  basic to the whole operation, because a CreateView class-based view must know beforehand which type of  model record to create. Second, the form_class is also a basic parameter, because a user must be presented  with a form to capture the data to create the model record.  420   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Finally, because successfully creating a model record entails notifying a user about the action and   moving away from the form page, the success_url field is also a basic part of a CreateView class-based view  to indicate where to redirect a user after a model record is created.  Customize template name, MIME type and context: template_name and  content_type fields and get_context_data    method Sometimes relying on the CreateView class-based view template naming convention   <model_ name>_form.html is unfeasible, either because you have a preexisting template to reuse or simply because  you don’t like the default convention. You can declare the template_name field as part of a CreateView class- based view to override this convention. Similarly, it’s also possible to override the default MIME type used  by a class-based view response – if the template contains something other than text html  e.g., text csv   – using the content_type field as part of a CreateView class-based view.  In addition, you can alter the context data passed to a class-based view template by defining an   implementation of the get_context_data   method. This last process is common when you need to pass  additional data to a template – besides the form reference – or change the actual form reference to another  name.  Listing 9-10 illustrates a CreateView class-based view that makes use of the template_name and   content_type fields, as well as the get_context_data   method.  Listing 9-10.  Django class-based view with CreateView with template_name, content_type, and   get_context_data     views.py from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView from .models import Item, ItemForm, Menu  class ItemCreation CreateView :     template_name = "items item_form.html"     context_type = "text html"     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      def get_context_data self,**kwargs :         kwargs['special_context_variable'] = 'My special context variable!!!'         context = super ItemCreation, self .get_context_data **kwargs          return context          You can see in Listing 9-10 the template_name and content_type fields are declared as part of the   class-based view. In this particular case, both field values are assigned their default values – making them  redundant – for simplicity; but you can adjust accordingly to your needs.  The get_context_data   method in Listing 9-10 first adds the custom special_context_variable key  to make it available to the class-based view template  i.e., items item_form.html . Next, a call is made to the  parent class’s get_context_data   method  i.e., CreateView  to run its context set up logic, which consists  of setting up the form reference which is also used in the template. Finally, the context reference with all the  template context values is returned by the get_context_data   method for use inside the template.  As you can see in Listing 9-10, by simply adding fields and overriding methods in a CreateView class-  based view, you can easily start changing its default behavior.  421   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Customize form initialization and validation: Initial field, get_initial   ,   get_form   , form_valid   , and form_invalid    methods The initial field on a CreateView class-based view works just like a standard form’s initial argument to  specify default values for an unbound form. For example, declaring the field initial = {'size':'L'} on a  CreateView class-based view sets its form’s size field to L.  Form initialization can sometimes require more complex requirements than a single line statement, in   which a CreateView class-based view also offers the get_initial   method. The get_initial   method  functions like the __init__ method used in standard forms – in that you can introduce open-ended logic   to set up default values – but is intended solely to set up initial values and to return a dictionary of   values – unlike the __init__ method where you can introduce other actions besides default form values   e.g., change widgets, add validation .  Listing 9-11 illustrates the use of the initial argument and get_initial   method on a CreateView   class-based view.  Listing 9-11.  Django class-based view with CreateView with initial and get_initial     views.py from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView from .models import Item, ItemForm, Menu  class ItemCreation CreateView :     initial = {'size':'L'}     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      def get_initial self :         initial_base = super ItemCreation, self .get_initial           initial_base['menu'] = Menu.objects.get id=1          return initial_base  The first step in Listing 9-11 set the initial field to set the class-based view’s form size field to L. Next,   the get_initial   method is declared to add another default value to a class-based view form.  Inside the get_initial   method, the first step is to call the parent class’s get_initial   method  i.e.,   CreateView  to run its initial set up logic; this ensures the class’s initial field value  i.e., {'size':'L'}  is  taken into account to as part of the initial value. Next, the initial_base reference is updated to set the  form’s menu field to the Menu record with id=1. Finally, the get_initial   method in Listing 9-11 returns a  dictionary containing both the initial field value set by the class-based view and the custom form value set  in its body.  The get_form   method of a CreateView class-based view is designed to tap into the full initialization   process of a form and not just on setting its default values like the initial field and get_initial   method.  This makes get_form   method suited to perform broader form initialization tasks like setting form  widgets and validation initialization, like its done in the __init__ method in standard forms. Inclusively,  it’s possible to use the get_form   method to specify default form values and forgo the use of initial and  get_initial   altogether. Listing 9-12 illustrates the use of the get_form   method in a CreateView   class-based view.  422   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Listing 9-12.  Django class-based view with CreateView with get_form     views.py from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView from .models import Item, ItemForm, Menu  class ItemCreation CreateView :     initial = {'size':'L'}     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      def get_form self :         form = super ItemCreation, self .get_form           initial_base = self.get_initial           initial_base['menu'] = Menu.objects.get id=1          form.initial = initial_base         form.fields['name'].widget = forms.widgets.Textarea           return form  The first step in the get_form   method in Listing 9-12 is to call the parent class’s get_form   method   i.e., CreateView  to get the base form. Next, a call is made to the class-based view’s get_initial   method  to get its initial form value, as well as set up a default value for the form’s menu field using a model query.   In this case, the form initialization form dictionary has the same values as those in Listing 9-11.  Next, the form initialization dictionary is assigned to the base form using the standard initial form  reference. Finally, before returning an instance of the form class, a custom widget is set on the form’s name  field, overriding the default widget of the form name field.  In addition to initialization tasks, the form validation process for a CreateView class-based view can   also be customized. The form_valid   and form_invalid   methods are used to access the points at which  a class-based view form is deemed successful or erroneous, respectively. Listing 9-13 illustrates an example  that uses the form_valid   and form_invalid   methods in a CreateView class-based view.  Listing 9-13.  Django class-based view with CreateView with form_valid   and form_invalid     views.py from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from django.contrib import messages from .models import Item, ItemForm, Menu  class ItemCreation CreateView :     initial = {'size':'L'}     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      def form_valid self,form :         super ItemCreation,self .form_valid form           Add action to valid form phase         messages.success self.request, 'Item created successfully!'          return HttpResponseRedirect self.get_success_url        def form_invalid self,form :          Add action to invalid form phase         return self.render_to_response self.get_context_data form=form    423   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   As you can see in Listing 9-13, the form_valid   method gains access to the form instance via its form   input argument, which in turn allows you to perform actions on the form when it passes its validation phase.  In this case, no action is taken on the form itself to simplify things, but an additional piece of logic is added  to illustrate the customization process.  The first step in the form_valid   in Listing 9-13 is a call to the parent class’s form_valid   method   i.e., CreateView  to run its form validation setup logic, this ensures the base class’s form validation is run  first to verify any form rule violations  e.g., add errors to the form . If a call to the parent’s form_valid    method detects a rule violation, then the class’s form_valid   method  i.e., the one Listing 9-13  short- circuits and falls back to the form_invalid   method. If the parent’s form_valid   method passes, the logic  in Listing 9-13 continues to add a Django message framework success message to present to a user.   it’s also possible to add Django message framework success messages to a class-based view form      Tip  validation process through a mixin. Mixins for class-based views are described in the last section of this  chapter.  Finally, because you’re handling a valid form workflow, the form_valid   method in Listing 9-13    must explicitly redirect a user to a location to finish its work. In this case, a standard Django  HttpResponseRedirect method is used with the class-based view’s get_success_url   method, the last of  which gets the class-based view success_url field value.  The form_invalid   method in Listing 9-13 does nothing in particular to handle an invalid form. It   simply does the minimum amount work – by means of class-based view methods – which is to return control  to the same template location and add the context that contains the form with errors to present to a user. As you can see, the benefit of the form_valid   and form_invalid   methods in a CreateView class- based view is they allow you to customize the form validation workflow, without the need to modify other  parts of a CreateView workflow  e.g., saving the form data to the database .  Customize view method workflow: get   and post   methods Besides the previous customization options for a CreateView class-based view, it’s also possible to get  absolute control over the workflow done by a class-based view with either the get   or post   methods. The  get   method is used to tap into the HTTP GET workflow associated with a class-based view, whereas the  post   method is used to tap into the HTTP POST workflow associated with a class-based view.  Although the use of the get   or post   methods can offer some of the greatest flexibility to a class-  based view, they also require to explicitly declare the initialization, validation, and redirect sequences of a  class-based view. This means class-based views that use either the get   or post   methods can resemble  more the standard open-ended Django views – described in Chapter 2 – than the succinct class-based view  presented earlier in Listing 9-9.  Still, sometimes the appeal of class-based views is so great, the use of the get   or post   methods   is warranted. Listing 9-14 illustrates an example that uses the get   and post   methods in a CreateView  class-based view.  Listing 9-14.  Django class-based view with CreateView with get   and post     views.py from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView from django.shortcuts import render from django.contrib import messages  424   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   class ItemCreation CreateView :     initial = {'size':'L'}     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      template_name = "items item_form.html"     def get self,request, *args, **kwargs :         form = super ItemCreation, self .get_form            Set initial values and custom widget         initial_base = self.get_initial           initial_base['menu'] = Menu.objects.get id=1          form.initial = initial_base         form.fields['name'].widget = forms.widgets.Textarea            return response using standard render   method         return render request,self.template_name,                       {'form':form,                        'special_context_variable':'My special context variable!!!'}       def post self,request,*args, **kwargs :         form = self.get_form            Verify form is valid         if form.is_valid  :              Call parent form_valid to create model record object             super ItemCreation,self .form_valid form               Add custom success message             messages.success request, 'Item created successfully!'                   Redirect to success page                 return HttpResponseRedirect self.get_success_url             Form is invalid          Set object to None, since class-based view expects model record object         self.object = None          Return class-based view form_invalid to generate form with errors         return self.form_invalid form   You can see in Listing 9-14 that both the get   and post   methods have access to a request input –  an HttpRequest instance – like standard view methods. This request reference allows class-based views  access to request data, such as HTTP meta data  e.g., user’s IP address , which is a topic described in detail  in Chapter 2.  The first step in the get   method in Listing 9-14 is to create an unbound form using the parent class’s  get_form   method  i.e., CreateView . Because the get   method gives you full control over the workflow,  it would be equally valid to create an unbound form using standard form syntax  e.g., form = ItemForm   ,  but since it’s a class-based view, the example leverages a class-based view construct. Once the unbound  form is created, a series of initial values and a custom widget is set on the form, just like it’s done in the  previous class-based view examples.  Once the unbound form is ready, notice the return statement of the get   method uses the standard  render   method used in regular view methods. In this case, the render   method redirects control to the  class-based view template and sets the template context with the unbound form and an additional special_ context_variable variable to use in the template.  Next, the post   method in Listing 9-14 is tasked with processing the form with user data. The first step  in the post   method is to get a bound form instance using the class-based view get_form   class. Similarly  to the get   method, it would be equally valid to create a bound form using standard form syntax  e.g., form  = ItemForm request.POST  .  425   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   With a bound form instance, a check is made to verify if the user provided form data is valid, just like  it’s done with standard forms  e.g., form.is_valid   . If the form data is valid, a call is made to the parent  class’s is_valid   method  i.e., CreateView , which ensures the core logic of a class-based view is executed  when a form is valid  e.g. saving the form data to a database . Here it’s possible once again to use any  standard model construct, but calling the parent class’s is_valid   method is easier to execute this routine  logic to create a model object record. Once the routine validation logic is complete, a success message is  added to present to an end user and a redirect is made to the class-based view’s success url. If the form data  is invalid, the class-based view’s object field is set to None – since class-based views expect to handle an  object record instance in POST processing – and control is returned using the class-based form_invalid    method that takes care of the underlying details vs. using the render   method to create a standard view  method response.  As you can now understand from this example in Listing 9-14, a CreateView class-based view can be  just as flexible as a standard view method. It’s simply a matter of knowing and understanding the different  fields and methods supported by a CreateView class-based view. Of course, if you feel the custom logic for  a CreateView class-based view becomes too unwieldy, you can always fall back to a standard view method  presented back in Chapter 2.  Read Model Records with the Class-Based Views ListView and  DetailView Similar to the process of creating model records, the process to read model records also follows a near  identical process for all models: create a query to get model record s  and then use a template to display  the model record s . The Django ListView and DetailView class-based views are specifically designed to  cut down on the amount of boilerplate code needed to display a list of Django model records and a single  Django model record, respectively.  The ListView class-based view can quickly set up a query for a list of model records and display them in   a template. Listing 9-15 illustrates a class-based view that uses the ListView class-based view.  Listing 9-15.  Django class-based view with ListView to read list of records   views.py from django.views.generic.list import ListView from .models import Item  class ItemList ListView :     model = Item   urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.items import views as items_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',items_views.ItemList.as_view  ,name="index" , ]   templates items item_list.html   {% regroup object_list by menu as item_menu_list %}   {% for menu_section in item_menu_list %}     {{ menu_section.grouper }}               {% for item in menu_section.list %}  426   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views            {{item.nametitle}}              {% endfor %}             {% endfor %}  The first definition in Listing 9-15 is the ItemList class, which inherits its behavior from the ListView  class-based view class. The model field in the ItemList class set to Item tells Django to generate a list of all  Item model records  e.g., Item.objects.all   .  Next, the ListView class-based view is hooked up to a root url regular expression – r'^$' – using the   as_view   method, the last of which is available on all class-based views and was also used in the past  section to set up a CreateView class-based view.  Finally, the last part in Listing 9-15 illustrates the template item_list.html that generates a loop over  the object_list reference, the last of which is the default context variable used by a ListView class-based  view that contains the model record list.  Recapping, the most important default behaviors of a ListView class-based view are the following: The list of records is made from all records of the model defined in the model option. The template to render the list of records uses the convention    _list.html   under the TEMPLATES directory path of a project.  The context variable passed to a template  i.e., the one containing the records  is named object_list. As you can see in this example, a ListView class-based view cuts down the boilerplate code needed to   present a list of model records to one field.  The DetailView class-based view is another record reading construct, designed to quickly set up a   single record query and present the results in a template. Listing 9-16 illustrates a class-based view that uses  the DetailView class.  Listing 9-16.  Django class-based view with DetailView to read model record   views.py from django.views.generic. import DetailView from .models import Item  class ItemDetail DetailView :     model = Item   urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.items import views as items_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^ ?P \d+  $',items_views.ItemDetail.as_view  ,name="detail" , ]   templates items item_detail.html   {{item.nametitle}}   {{item.description}}   ${{item.price}}   For {{item.get_size_display}} size: Only {{item.calories}} calories {% if item.drink %} and {{item.drink.caffeine}} mg of caffeine.  {% endif %}    427   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   The first definition in Listing 9-16 is the ItemDetail class, which inherits its behavior from the   DetailView class-based view class. The model field in the ItemDetail class is to Item, which tells Django to  get an Item model record. Unlike the ListView class-based view class in Listing 9-15 that reads all model  records, a DetailView class-based view class must always limit its model query to a single record, which is  where the class-based view url definition comes into play.  The DetailView class-based view in Listing 9-16 is hooked up to a root url regular expression – r'^$'   – using the as_view   method – just like other class-based views – but notice the url definition contains  the  ?P \d+  url parameter, which gets passed to the class-based view to delimit the model query to a  single record.  For example, if a request is made on the url  items 1 , the 1 is assigned to the pk parameter, which   is passed to the classed-based view, to build the model query Item.objects.get pk=1  that gets the Item  model record with pk=1 – note the pk field stands for primary key, which is generally equivalent to the id  field.  In this manner, as the url requests made on the DetailView class-based view change  e.g.  items 2 ,    items 3  , so does the backing query made for a model a record, and with it the record returned to be  displayed in the template.  Finally, the last part in Listing 9-16 illustrates the template item_detail.html that outputs various   fields of the item reference that represents the model record. In this case, the item reference is used  because the default context variable used by a DetailView class-based view for a model record is the name  of the model itself.  Recapping, the most important default behaviors of a DetailView class-based view are the following: The model record is determined based on the model option and the url pk parameter that delimits the   query to a single record based on the model’s primary key.  The template to render the record uses the convention    _detail.html under   the TEMPLATES directory path of a project.  The context variable passed to a template  i.e., the one containing the record  is named after the model   of the class-based view  e.g., if model=Item, the context variable is named item .  As you can see in this example, a class-based view that inherits its behavior from the DetailView class   cuts down the boilerplate code needed to present a single model record.  ListView Fields and Methods Similar to the CreateView class-based view presented earlier, it’s possible to override many of default  behaviors of a ListView class-based view.  As it turns out, the ListView class-based view inherits its behavior from many other Django class-based   views, presented in the following list:  django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectTemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.base.TemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.list.BaseListView django.views.generic.list.MultipleObjectMixin django.views.generic.base.View     Note   a ListView class-based view inherits many fields and methods from its parent classes. the  following options are the most common ones; for an exhaustive list consult each of the ListView parent  classes.  428   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Basic ListView option: Model field As you saw in Listing 9-15, the essential logic fulfilled by a ListView class-based view is to create a list of  records from a model. Therefore the model field option is essential to indicate on which model to create a  record list.  The next sections describe how to customize a ListView class-based view, including how to delimit and   generate multiple pages for a list of records, as well as how to override other default behaviors.  Customize template context reference name: context_object_name In Listing 9-15, you can see the template of the ListView class-based view uses the rather unfriendly context  variable named object_list. This is the default behavior, but to help template editors, it’s possible to use a  different context variable to contain the list of records.  The context_object_name field is used to define a custom context variable name to manipulate the list   of records inside a template  e.g., context_object_name = 'item_list' .   a ListView class-based view also inherits its behavior from many of the same classes as the      Tip  CreateView class described earlier. therefore, you can also use the template_name field to specify a custom  template name; the content_type field to specify a MiMe type; and the get_context_data   method to alter  the context used by a template.  Customize record list: Queryset and ordering fields and pagination behavior By default, a ListView class-based view generates a list for all records that belong to a model. While this  behavior is reasonable, it can also be necessary to create a ListView class-based view that returns more  limited criteria, in which case it’s necessary to delimit the backing model query. The queryset field is used  to define a custom query to generate a list of records.  Another helpful option to customize a record list is to specify the field order in which to generate the   record list. Similar to the standard order_by   method used in model queries, a ListView class-based view  can specify the ordering field to define the sort order of a record list.  Listing 9-17 illustrates the use of the queryset and ordering fields in a ListView class-based view.  Listing 9-17.  Django class-based view with ListView to reduce record list with queryset   views.py from django.views.generic.list import ListView from .models import Item  class ItemList ListView :     model = Item     queryset = Item.objects.filter menu__id=1      ordering = ['name']  As you can see in Listing 9-17, the queryset field is assigned a standard model query to produce Item  records with a menu id=1. In this manner, the resulting record list passed by ListView the class-based view  to the template only contains Item records that match these criteria. In addition, Listing 9-17 also makes use  of the ordering = ['name'] field, which in this case ensures the query to generate the record list is sorted  by the Item model’s name field.  429   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Although the queryset option is helpful to delimit the size of the record list presented by a ListView   class-based view, sometimes it’s necessary to deal with a large record list and still be able to delimit the  amount of results displayed in a template. For such scenarios, you can use pagination to split out a large  record list over multiple pages.  Since pagination by definition depends on the use of multiple pages, it forces you to adjust not only a   ListView class-based view definition, but also the url structure and template used by the class-based view to  support multiple pages. Listing 9-18 illustrates a pagination example for a ListView class-based view, which  is based on the example from Listing 9-15.  Listing 9-18.  Django class-based view with ListView to read list of records with pagination  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',items_views.ItemList.as_view  ,name="index" ,     url r'^page  ?P \d+  $',items_views.ItemList.as_view  ,name="page" , ]   views.py from django.views.generic.list import ListView from .models import Item  class ItemList ListView :     model = Item     paginate_by = 5   urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.items import views as items_views   templates items item_list.html   {% regroup object_list by menu as item_menu_list %} {% for menu_section in item_menu_list %}     {{ menu_section.grouper }}               {% for item in menu_section.list %}          {{item.nametitle}}              {% endfor %}             {% endfor %}   {% if is_paginated %}     {{page_obj}}  {% endif %}  The relevant pagination logic in Listing 9-18 is in bold. First off, the paginate_by = 5 is added to   the class-based view definition, which tells Django to limit the record list to 5 records per page. Since the  ListView class-based view will require a page number to display records beyond the first 5 records of query  – since pages are limited to 5 – the natural place to obtain a page number is through a url  e.g.,  page 1  to  create a list with the first 5 records of a query,  page 2  to create a list with the records 6 through 10, etc. .  430   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Next in Listing 9-18, you can see a new url definition with the  ?P \d+  parameter hooked up the  ListView class-based view. This url definition allows a request that matches the regular expression pattern   e.g.,  page 1 , page 2   to pass the url page parameter value to the class-based view. When a ListView  class-based view detects a url page parameter value with the presence of the paginate_by option, it adjusts  the query for the record list to return the appropriate set of records to a template based on the page  e.g.,   page 1  generates a list of records from 1 to 5 of the overall query,  page 2  generates a list of records from 6  to 10 of the overall query, etc. .  Finally, the last section in Listing 9-18 represents the backing template for a ListView class-based view  that uses pagination. The {% is_paginated %} tag and {{page_obj}} context reference are used to let users  know on which page of the overall record list they’re on.     Tip   a ListView class-based view can also use the get   class-based view method to get full control over  the view workflow. see the previous section on the CreateView class-based view, which describes how to use  it and its implications.  DetailView Fields and Methods Like other class-based views, a DetailView class-based view can also be created with custom fields and  methods to override their default behaviors.  As it turns out, the DetailView class inherits its behavior from many other Django class-based views,   which are described in the following list:  django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.base.TemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.detail.BaseDetailView django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin django.views.generic.base.View     Note  a DetailView class-based view inherits many fields and methods from its parent classes. the  following options are the most common ones; for an exhaustive list consult each of the DetailView parent  classes.  Basic DetailView options: Model field and url with pk parameter As you saw in Listing 9-16, the essential logic fulfilled by a DetailView class-based view is to get a model  record and display it in a template. Therefore the model field is one of the essential pieces to this type of  class-based view and must always be provided.  In order to get a specific model record, a DetailView class-based view must also define a url parameter   that helps it select a model record. By default, this url parameter must be named pk and its value is used to  perform a query on the model value using the pk field, which is generally equivalent to a model’s id field.  431   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views      Tip   a DetailView class-based view also inherits its behavior from many of the class-based view classes  described earlier. therefore, you can also use the template_name field to specify a custom template name; the  content_type field to specify a MiMe type; the get_context_data   method to alter the context used by a  template; as well as the context_object_name field to declare a different context variable to access a record in  a template.  Customize url and query parameters: pk_url_kwarg, slug_field and   slug_url_kwarg By default, a DetailView class-based view expects a url argument named pk to determine on which model  record to make a query by its primary key. However, if you already have a preexisting url or simply don’t like  this inexpressive url parameter name, you can assign a custom url parameter with the pk_url_kwarg field.  For example, setting pk_url_kwarg='item_id' on a DetailView class-based view, allows a url to   be defined as url r'^ ?P \d+  $',items_views.ItemDetail.as_view    vs. the default  url r'^ ?P \d+  $',items_views.ItemDetail.as_view   .  Even though performing the record query of a DetailView class-based view with the pk field is a common  practice – given the pk field is generally an integer field with a database index to increase lookup performance  – sometimes in can be necessary to perform the record query of a DetailView class-based with another model  field  e.g., to create more user SEO-friendly urls like  item capuccino , instead of  item 1  .  Listing 9-19 illustrates a DetailView class-based view that uses the slug_field option to allow a model   record query to be made against a model field other than pk.  Listing 9-19.  Django class-based view with DetailView and slug_field option   views.py  views.py from django.views.generic import DetailView from .models import Item  class ItemDetail DetailView :     model = Item     slug_field = 'name__iexact'   urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.items import views as items_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^ ?P \w+  $',items_views.ItemDetail.as_view  ,name="detail" , ]   Template identical to listing to template in Listing 9-16  The first important aspect in Listing 9-19 is that the url definition has a url parameter named slug that   matches any word pattern due to the w+ regular expression. This means urls such as  items espresso   and  items latte  match this url, unlike the prior DetailView class-based url definition that uses the pk  parameter to match numeric values with d+ regular expression.  432   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   When a DetailView class-based view receives a url parameter named slug, it signals the class-based  view that the model record query should done on a model field other than pk. Because this slug value can  be ambiguous  e.g., it can represent one of several model field values, such as name, cost, or description , it’s  necessary to qualify which model field the slug value represents, which is the purpose of slug_field field.  In the case of Listing 9-19, the slug_field field is set to name__iexact, which tells the DetailView   class-based view to perform a case-insensitive model query with the slug value on the Item model name  field. The case-insensitive query is provided by the __iexact lookup and is important in case the database  record values are mixed case  e.g., the url  items capuccino  would match an Item name record capuccino,  Capuccino,,or CAPUCCINO. Without case inventivenesses, the Item name record would need to be exactly  capuccino to match the url .  Although not presented in the sample in Listing 9-19, another option available for a DetailView class- based view is the slug_url_kwarg option, which has a similar to the pk_url_kwarg option described earlier.  By default, a DetailView class-based view that uses a slug query  i.e., non pk query  expects a url   argument named slug to determine on which model field to make a query to obtain a record. However, if  you already have a preexisting url or simply don’t like this inexpressive url parameter name, you can assign a  custom url parameter with the slug_url_kwarg field.  For example, setting slug_url_kwarg='item_name' on a DetailView class-based view, allows a url  to be defined as url r'^ ?P \w+  $',items_views.ItemDetail.as_view    vs. the default  url r'^ ?P \w+  $',items_views.ItemDetail.as_view   .     Tip   a DetailView class-based view can also use the get   class-based view method to get full control  over the view workflow. see the previous section on the CreateView class-based view that describes how to  use it and its implications.  Update Model Records with the Class-Based View UpateView When you update a Django model record, the typical process involves fetching the model record you want to  update from a database, presenting the model data in a form so a user can make changes, and finally saving  the changes back to the database. The Django UpdateView class-based view is specifically designed to cut  down on the amount of boilerplate code needed to update a Django model record.  Due to its functionality, the UpdateView class-based view operates like a combination of the CreateView   – which creates a model record through a form – and the DetailView – which displays a model record.  Listing 9-20 illustrates an example of an UpdateView class-based view.  Listing 9-20.  Django class-based view with UpdateView to edit a record   views.py from django.views.generic import UpdateView from .models import Item  class ItemUpdate UpdateView :     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'    urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.items import views as items_views  433   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   urlpatterns = [      url r'^edit  ?P \d+  $', items_views.ItemUpdate.as_view  , name='edit' , ]   templates items item_form.html           {% csrf_token %}         {{ form.as_p }}                     {% if object == None%}Create{% else %}Update{% endif %}              The first definition in Listing 9-20 is the ItemUpdate class that inherits its behavior from the UpdateView   class-based view class. The model field in the ItemUpate class sets a value to Item, which tells Django to  update Item model records. In addition, because you’re dealing with an update operation, the Item model  record must be presented in a form – which is the purpose of the from_class option – as well as define a  success url to redirect a user if an update is successful, which is the purpose of the success_url option.  Next in Listing 9-20 is the url definition that hooks up the UpdateView class-based view class. Because  an UpdateView class-based view must present a specific model record to edit, it relies on a url parameter to  limit a query to a single record. In this case, notice the url contains the pk url parameter that gets passed to  the class-based view – just like it’s done with a DetailView class-based view.  For example, if a request is made for the url  items edit 1 , 1 is passed as the pk argument to the   UpdateView class-based view, which in turn performs the query Item.objects.get pk=1  to retrieve the  record and present it in a form for editing.  Finally, the last part in Listing 9-20 illustrates the template item_form.html that displays the record   inside a form to edit. One important aspect of the default UpdateView class-based view template is that it’s  the same default template used by a CreateView class-based view. This is because both class-based views  share the same parent class-based view class for this functionality, not to mention the purpose of the form  is the same  e.g., the form in a CreateView class-based view is sent empty for a user to fill in new record  data, where as the form in a UpdateView class-based view is sent pre-filled with a record to update the  record data .  For this reason, the template in Listing 9-20 is almost identical to the template in Listing 9-9 used in a   CreateView class-based view. The minor difference is that if the template detects the presence of the object  variable in its context, it means the UpdateView class-based view is passing a record for editing and the form  button is set to Update; otherwise, if no object variable is present, it means the CreateView class-based view  is calling the template and the form button is set to Create.  Recapping, the most important default behaviors of an UpdateView class-based view: The model record to update is determined based on the model option and a url pk parameter that   delimits the query to a single record based on the model’s primary key.  The template to render a form to update a record uses the convention    _  form.html under the TEMPLATES directory path of a project, noting it’s the same default template used by  CreateView class-based views, for which you can rely on the presence of the object context variable to  determine if it’s the UpdateView calling the template.  The context variable passed to a template  i.e., the one containing the record  is named object, albeit   the form is automatically populated with this record value.  As you can see in this example, a class-based view that inherits its behavior from the UpdateView class,   cuts down the boilerplate code needed to edit a model record.  434   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   UpdateView Fields and Methods Like other class-based views, UpdateView class-based views can also be created with custom fields and  methods to override their default behaviors.  As it turns out, the UpdateView class inherits its behavior from many other Django class-based views,   presented in the following list:  django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.base.TemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.edit.BaseUpdateView django.views.generic.edit.ModelFormMixin django.views.generic.edit.FormMixin django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin django.views.generic.edit.ProcessFormView django.views.generic.base.View     Note  an UpdateView class-based view inherits many fields and methods from its parent classes. the following  options are the most common ones; for an exhaustive list consult each of the UpdateView parent classes.  Basic UpdateView options: Model, form_class and success_url fields, and url  with pk parameter As you saw in Listing 9-20, the essential logic fulfilled by an UpdateView class-based view is to get a model  record and display it in a form for editing. Therefore the model field is one of the essential pieces for this type  of class-based view and must always be provided. In addition, because a record is updated via form, it’s also  necessary to specify a form through the form_class option, as well as a success url through the success_url  option for when an update is successful.  In order to get a specific model record, an UpdateView class-based view must also define a url   parameter that helps it select a model record to edit. By default, this url parameter must be named pk and  its value is used to perform a query on the model value using the pk field, which is generally equivalent to a  model’s id field.     Tip   an UpdateView class-based view also inherits its behavior from many of the class-based view classes  described earlier. therefore, you can also use the template_name field to specify a custom template name; the  content_type field to specify a MiMe type; the get_context_data   method to alter the context used by a  template; as well as the context_object_name field to declare a different context variable to access a record in  a template.  in addition, because an UpdateView class-based view requires obtaining a model record, it can also use the   pk_url_kwarg field to accept a different url parameter named differently than pk; the slug_field field to  specify an alternative record query field; and the slug_url_kwarg field to accept a different url parameter  named differently than slug.  Finally, an UpdateView class-based view can also use the get   and post   class-based view methods to get  full control over the view workflow. the previous class-based view sections describe how to use all these   class-based view fields and methods.  435   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   Delete Records with the Class-Bases View DeleteView When you delete a Django model record, besides executing the actual delete operation, it’s generally a good  practice to present a confirmation page to a user. The Django DeleteView class-based view is specifically  designed to cut down on the amount of boilerplate code needed to delete a model record, while presenting a  confirmation page. Listing 9-21 illustrates a DeleteView class-based view example.  Listing 9-21.  Django class-based view with DeleteView to delete record   views.py from django.views.generic.edit import DeleteView from .models import Item  class ItemDelete UpdateView :     model = Item     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'    urls.py from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.items import views as items_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^delete  ?P \d+  $', items_views.ItemDelete.as_view  , name='delete' ,   ]   templates items item_confirm_delete.html             {% csrf_token %}         Do you really want to delete "{{ object }}"?          Yes, remove it!       The first definition in Listing 9-21 is the ItemDelete class, which inherits its behavior from the   DeleteView class-based view class. The model field in the ItemDelete class sets a value to Item, which tells  Django to delete Item model records. In addition, because you’ll want users to confirm the delete operation,  the success_url option must also be declared to specify where to take users after the delete operation is  successful.  Next in Listing 9-21 is the url definition that hooks up the DeleteView class-based view class. Because   a DeleteView class-based view must be told which model record to delete, it relies on a url parameter to  provide this query delimiter. In this case, notice the url contains the pk url parameter that gets passed to the  class-based view – just like it’s done with a DetailView class-based view.  For example, if a request is made for the url  items delete 1 , 1 is passed as the pk argument to the  DeleteView class-based view, which in turn performs the query Item.objects.get pk=1  to prepare the  record for deletion.  Finally, the last part in Listing 9-21 illustrates the item_confirm_delete.html template that is used for  the user-facing deletion sequence. Notice this template contains a pseudo-form  i.e., no form fields  with a  question and submit button. The reason for this pseudo-form is the item_confirm_delete.html template  has a dual function.  436   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   If an HTTP GET request is made on a DeleteView class-based view, a page with this pseudo-form is   returned to the user presenting him with the question Do you really want to delete "{{ object }}"?,  where object is the model record to be deleted. If the user clicks on this pseudo-form submit button, it  issues an HTTP POST request – notice the   tag – to the same DeleteView class-based  view, which invokes the actual delete procedure. In this manner, this template with a pseudo-form allows a  user to confirm if he really wants to delete the record after hitting a url delete link  e.g.,  items delete 1  ,  instead of immediately deleting a record when hitting a url delete link.  Recapping, the most important default behaviors of a DeleteView class-based view are the following: The model record to delete is determined based on the model option and a url pk parameter that   delimits the query to a single record based on the model’s primary key.  The template to render a form to update a record uses the convention    _  confirm_delete.html under the TEMPLATES directory path of a project.  The context variable passed to a template  i.e., the one containing the record to delete  is named   object.  An HTTP GET request on a DeleteView class-based view presents the confirmation page from the <app_ name>  _confirm_delete.html template. An HTTP POST request on a DeleteView class-based  view performs the actual delete procedure.  As you can see in this example, a class-based view that inherits its behavior from the DeleteView class,   cuts down the boilerplate code needed to delete a model record.  DeleteView Fields and Methods Like other class-based views, a DeleteView class-based view can also be created with custom fields and  methods to override their default behaviors.  As it turns out, the DeleteView class inherits its behavior from many other Django class-based views,   presented in the following list:  django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectTemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.base.TemplateResponseMixin django.views.generic.edit.BaseDeleteView django.views.generic.edit.DeletionMixin django.views.generic.detail.BaseDetailView django.views.generic.detail.SingleObjectMixin django.views.generic.base.View     Note   a DeleteView class-based view inherits many fields and methods from its parent classes. the  following options are the most common ones; for an exhaustive list consult each of the DeleteView parent  classes.  Basic DeleteView options: Model and success_url fields and url with pk  parameter As you saw in Listing 9-21, the essential logic fulfilled by a DeleteView class-based view is to get a model  record and delete it while presenting a confirmation page. Therefore the model field is one of the essential  pieces to this type of class-based view and must always be provided. In addition, because a record is set to be  deleted, it’s also necessary to specify a success url through the success_url option to redirect a user after the  record is deleted.  437   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   In order to get a specific model record, a DeleteView class-based view must also define a url parameter that   helps it select a model record to delete. By default, this url parameter must be named pk and its value is used to  perform a query on the model value using the pk field, which is generally equivalent to a model’s id field.     Tip   a DeleteView class-based view also inherits its behavior from many of the class-based view classes  described earlier. therefore, you can also use the template_name field to specify a custom template name; the  content_type field to specify a MiMe type; the get_context_data   method to alter the context used by a  template; as well as the context_object_name field to declare a different context variable to access a record in  a template.  in addition, because a DeleteView class-based view requires obtaining a model record, it can also use the   pk_url_kwarg field to accept a different url parameter named differently than pk; the slug_field field to  specify an alternative record query field; and the slug_url_kwarg field to accept a different url parameter  named differently than slug.  Finally, a DeleteView class-based view can also use the get   and post   class-based view methods to get  full control over the view workflow. the previous class-based view sections describe how to use all these  class-based view fields and methods.  Class-Based Views with Mixins Although all class-based views that operate on models typically follow the same workflow to create, read,  update, and delete model records, it’s fair to say that after seeing the previous class-based view sections,  you’ll often find yourself adjusting the default behavior of class-based views.  While it can be perfectly reasonable to adjust the methods and fields of a class-based view a couple of   times, it can get tiresome if you need to do it over and over to obtain the same functionality across dozens or  hundreds of class-based views.  Nowhere is this more evident than when you’re forced to define a get   or post   method in a class-  based view, to include some functionality that’s not supported in a class-based view  e.g., CreateView,  ListView, DetailView, UpdateView, DeleteView , which requires typing in a long-winded workflow that can  turn out to be repetitive if done multiple times. To cut down on repetitive customizations in the context of  class-based views, you can use mixins.  For starters, you’ve already used mixins in the context of class-based views, even if you didn’t realize  it. If you looked closely at the class-based view classes that provide the behaviors to the model class-based  views described in previous sections, you may have noticed many include the term mixin in their name    e.g., ModelFormMixin, FormMixin, SingleObjectMixin .  A software mixin is a construct that allows inheritance-like behavior between classes, noting the emphasis   on inheritance-like. When you use class inheritance, a parent-child class relationship is often described with  the ‘is a’ term  e.g., if a Drink class inherits its behavior from an Item class, a Drink is an Item . A mixin class, on  the other hand, allows a class to adopt the behaviors of a mixin class without the 'is a' behavior.  In other words, a mixin class is a way to add functionality to classes, with the mixin class serving  as a reusable component. For example, you can have a mixin Checkout class used by a Store class and  OnlineStore class, which allows the functionality of the mixin class to be reused in any other class. Notice  that for mixin classes, the inheritance ‘is a’ behavior doesn’t apply, you can’t say a Store is a Checkout or an  OnlineStore is a Checkout, it’s more of 'uses a' behavior. Therefore although mixin classes – semantically  speaking – are used to inherit behaviors, technically speaking they don’t use inheritance as it’s commonly  known in software engineering, hence the use of the term inheritance-like.  438   Chapter 9   Django MoDel ForMs anD Class Views   So why are mixins important to class-based views? It turns out, all of the base class-based view classes   you learned about in the previous section are built on class-based views mixins. This not only means you  can mix and match mixins to create custom class-based views, but you can also create or reuse other mixins  to enhance the functionality of class-based views.  Earlier when you learned about the CreateView   class-based view, you may recall the examples in   Listing 9-13 and 9-14 added a Django framework success message to inform a user when a record was  created. In the case of Listing 9-13, this required tapping into the form_valid   class-based view method to  add this message, while in the case of Listing 9-14, this required tapping into the post   class-based view  method. Although both approaches are perfectly valid, declaring either of these methods in a class-based  view for the sole purpose of adding a Django framework success message is a lot of work.  By using a mixin on a class-based view, you can simplify the addition of Django framework success   messages in a class-based view to a single field, without the need to customize more elaborate methods and  or add logic to a class-based view.  Listing 9-22 illustrates a CreateView class-based view that uses a mixin to support this functionality to   add a Django framework success message to a class-based view response.  Listing 9-22.  Django class-based view with CreateView and mixin class   views.py from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin from .models import Item, ItemForm  class ItemCreation SuccessMessageMixin,CreateView :     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      success_message = "Item % name s created successfully"   Mixin classes should always be declared first to take precedence over coarser grained       Caution  class-based views classes in the context of multiple inheritance class-based views  e.g. class   ItemCreation SuccessMessageMixin,CreateView  .  The first important aspect of Listing 9-22 is the import statement for the SuccessMessageMixin   mixin class, which is what gives any class-based view the ability to easily add success messages. Next, the  SuccessMessageMixin mixin class is added to the ItemCreation class, along with the CreateView   class-based view to give the class-based view its core functionality. Notice the mixin class is added to the  class-based view using standard Python inheritance syntax.  Once the ItemCreation class-based view gains access to the SuccessMessageMixin mixin class behavior,  all that’s needed to generate a success message is to define the actual message in the success_message field.  In this manner, when a success operation occurs in the context of the class-based view  e.g., the success_url  is triggered , the class-based view automatically adds the success_message value to the request to display to  an end user.  As you can see in Listing 9-22, the process to add a Django framework success message to a class-based   view is greatly simplified and made reusable by means of a mixin class. This is particularly true, when you  compare it to the approaches taken in Listings 9-13 and 9-14, consisting of overriding class-based view  methods that require a lot of typing – many repetitive – to fulfill a simple task.  439   CHAPTER 10  Django User Management  In this chapter you’ll learn about Django administers users, groups, and permissions. You’ll learn how to  conditionally display content depending on a user, how to restrict urls and class-based views, as well as  how to manage CRUD  Create-Read-Update-Delete  permissions for Django model records based on user  permissions.  In addition, you’ll also learn how to customize Django’s built-in user model to support additional data  fields, as well as how to automate user management tasks like signup, password reminders, and password  reset emails. Finally, you’ll learn how to create custom authentication back ends to validate user credentials  with different technologies, including allowing users to access a Django application with a Facebook,  Google, or Twitter account.  Introduction to the Django User System  The Django user system is based on the django.contrib.auth package built in to the Django framework.  In this section you’ll learn about the core concepts offered by this package, which is the default user system  used by a variety of Django apps including the Django admin.  User Types, Subtypes, Groups, and Permissions There are two main types of Django user classes: User and AnonymousUser. If a user authenticates himself   i.e., provides a valid username password  Django recognizes him as a User. On the other hand, if a user just  surfs an application without any authentication, Django recognizes him as an AnonymousUser.  Any User can be further classified into one of various subtypes:   	   	   	  superuser.- The most powerful user with permissions to create, read, update, and  delete data in the Django admin, which includes model records and other users.  staff.- A user marked as staff can access the Django admin. But permissions to create,  read, update, and delete data in the Django admin must be given explicitly to a user.  By default, a superuser is marked as staff.  active.- All users are marked as active if they’re in good standing. Users marked as  inactive aren’t able to authenticate themselves, a common state if there’s a pending  post-registration step  e.g., confirm email  or a user is banned and you don’t want to  delete his data.    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_10  441   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Django also offers the concept of a Group class to grant a set of users the same set of permissions   without having to assign them individually. For example, you can grant permissions to a group and then  assign users to the group to make permission management easier. In this manner, you can revoke or add  permissions in a single step to a set of users, as well as quickly give new users the same permissions.  In addition, you can assign Django permissions granularly to a User or Group in order for them to do   CRUD  Create-Update-Delete  records on Django models, a process that is done through Permission model  records. Or you can also assign coarser-grained Django permissions on URL view methods or template  content to grant access to a User, Group, or even Permission assignee.  Now that you know the basic concepts behind Django’s user system, let’s explore the more common   operations associated with Django users in greater detail.  Create Users The first user you’ll want to create is a superuser. If you already set up the Django admin in Chapter 1,  then you’ll already have a project superuser. Either way, I’ll recap the process here since you can have any  number of superusers. Listing 10-1 illustrates the various ways in which you can create a superuser.   Consult the book’s accompanying source code to run the exercises, in order to reduce typing and      Tip  automatically access test data.  Listing 10-1.  Create Django superuser  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py createsuperuser Username  leave blank to use 'admin' : Email address: admin@coffeehouse.com Password: Password  again : Superuser created successfully.  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py createsuperuser --username=bigboss                       --email=bigboss@coffeehouse.com Password: Password  again : Superuser created successfully.  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py shell Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  InteractiveConsole  >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User >>> user = User.objects.create_superuser username='angelinvestor',                                  email='angelinvestor@coffeehouse.com',                                  password='seedfunding'  >>>     Note    a Django username must be unique; preexisting usernames are rejected.  442   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  As you can see in Listing 10-1, you can create a superuser with the createsuperuser command in   the manage.py utility, where you’re asked for a username, email. and password. And you can also create a  superuser with the same createsuperuser command using inline arguments --username and --email, in  which case you’re only prompted for a password.  In addition, it’s also possible to create a superuser through the Django shell using the User model class   with the create_superuser   method. Notice how the create_superuser   method requires the same  username, email, and password arguments.  When you create a superuser in any of these ways, the user is also automatically set as a staff member  and marked as a active, so you don’t need to take any additional steps to access the Django admin – which  requires staff member permissions – or proceed with authentication, which requires a user to be marked as  active.  Sometimes you just want to create a regular user, in which case you can use Django’s shell utility and   create a user directly through the User model. This process is illustrated in Listing 10-2.  Listing 10-2.  Create regular Django user through shell  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py shell Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.  InteractiveConsole  >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User >>> user = User.objects.create_user username='downtownbarista',                                  email='downtownbarista@coffeehouse.com',                                  password='cappuccino'  >>> user.is_staff False >>> user.is_active True >>> user.is_superuser False  As you can see in Listing 10-2, after you gain access to the Django shell you import the User model class   and invoke the create_user   method with the username, email, and password arguments. The result of  the create_user   method contains the newly created user.  To confirm the create_user   method generates a regular user, you can see in Listing 10-2 a call to the  various User model attributes, confirming the user is neither staff or superuser and is just marked as active. Finally, it’s also possible to create users through the Django admin. To do this you’ll first need to make   sure you have superuser access to the Django admin. Once you access the Django admin, you’ll see a screen  like the one in Figure 10-1, click on the ‘Users’ link. The ‘Users’ link takes you to a screen like the one in  Figure 10-2, click on the button ‘Add User+’ in the top right. The ‘Add User+’ button takes you to a screen like  the one in Figure 10-3 where you can introduce the credentials for a new user.  443   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-1.  Django admin site home page  Figure 10-2.  Django admin Users list  444   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-3.  Django admin to create new user  If you wish to change the subtype  i.e. superuser, staff  of a user created in this manner, you can also do   it in the Django admin, a process that’s described in the next section.  Manage Users Once a user is in a Django application, you’ll end up managing him. This management can be either  revoking his privileges, adding to his privileges, or even editing his profile information. You can manage  Django users in two ways, in the Django admin or by manipulating a User model in the Django shell or  directly in your application.  The easiest way to manage users is directly in the Django admin. Once you access the Django admin  you’ll see a screen like the one in Figure 10-1, if you click on the ‘Users’ link you’ll be taken to a screen like  the one in Figure 10-2 that contains a list of Django users. Each Django user presented in Figure 10-2 has  his username as a link, and if you click on this link you’ll be taken to the user’s page, which is illustrated in  Figures 10-4, 10-5, and 10-6 where you can edit a user’s profile.  445   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-4.  Django admin change user page - Part 1  Figure 10-5.  Django admin change user page - Part 2  446   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-6.  Django admin change user page - Part 3  The first part of a user’s profile that you can edit is illustrated in Figure 10-4. Here you can edit his   username, his password - by clicking on the ‘this form’ link at the end of the small text - his first name, his  last name, as well as his email. In addition, you can see there are three check boxes where it’s possible to  change a user’s active, staff, and superuser status.  If you scroll down, you’ll see the second part of a user’s profile that you can edit, which is illustrated   in Figure 10-5. Here you can assign a user to different groups, as well as assign a user individual CRUD  permissions over Django models. Here I would advise you to carefully evaluate the need to assign  individual CRUD permissions to a user; a more flexible approach is to create groups and assign them CRUD  permissions and then assign users to groups, this way the permissions become easier to track and reusable  for other users.  If you scroll further down to the end, you’ll see the third part of a user’s profile that you can edit, which   is illustrated in Figure 10-6. Here you can view and update a user’s last login, as well as the date a user was  created. At the bottom right of the page, you can see the various save buttons to store any changes made to  the page. And in addition, at the bottom left there’s a ‘Delete’ button to remove a user completely; however,  I would advise you to consider just unchecking a user’s active status to restrict access. This last step is  sufficient to block a user from accessing an application again and it keeps his other data untouched in case  you want to undo the action.  Another option to modify a user’s profile is to directly manipulate his User model record. As illustrated  in Listing 10-3, you first make a query for the desired user and then modify the model attributes or execute  one of the User model helper methods.  Listing 10-3.  Manage Django user through shell  [user@coffeehouse ~]$ python manage.py shell Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Just be aware that because you’re making a query, any  changes made to fields must be followed by a call to the save   method on the reference for fields to be  persisted. Tables 10-1 and Table 10-2 contain a full list of fields and methods available on the User model.  Table 10-1.

Since the User model can be  changed for another, this method is the recommended approach  instead of referencing the username attribute directly. For a User this method always returns False; it's only used as a way to  differentiate between User and AnonymousUser. For a User this method always returns True, as it's only used to find  out whether the user has gone through the AuthenticationMiddleware   representing the currently logged-in user . Returns the first_name and the last_name fields, with a space in between. Returns the first_name. Sets the user's password to the given raw string, taking care of the  password hashing. Note that when the raw_password is None, the  password is set to an unusable password, as if set_unusable_password    were used. Returns True if the given raw string is the correct password for the user,  talking care of the password hashing for making the comparison. Marks the user as having no password set. Note this isn't the same as  having a blank string for a password. check_password   for this user will  never return True. This is helpful if authentication takes place against an  existing external source  e.g., LDAP directory . Returns False if set_unusable_password   has been called for the user. Returns a set of group permission strings for the user. If the obj is  passed, only returns the group permissions for the specific object. Returns a set of group and user permission strings for the user. If the obj  is passed, only returns the group permissions for the specific object. Returns True if the user has the specified permission, where perm is  in the format  . ”. Note if the user is  inactive, this method always returns False. If the obj is passed, the check  occurs on the specific object and not on the model. Returns True if the user has each of the specified permissions, where  each perm is in the format  . ”. Note  if the user is inactive, this method always returns False. If the obj is  passed, the check occurs on the specific object and not on the model. Returns True if the user has permissions in the given package    i.e., the Django app label . If the user is inactive, this method always  returns False.  Sends an email to the user. If from_email is None, Django uses the  DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL in settings.py. Also note this method relies on  Django's send_mail   method to which it passes the **kwargs argument.  See the Django email shortcut methods for more details on the send_ mail   method and **kwargs values,  449   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent     Tip    User model data is stored in the database table auth_user.  PASSWORD STRENGTH OPTIONS  By default, Django enforces password follow certain rules, such as not being similar to a username,  containing a minimum amount of characters, avoiding common words, and forcing passwords to   consist of more than numbers. these password rules are defined in a project’s settings.py file in the  aUth_passWorD_VaLIDators variable, as follows:  AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [     {         'NAME':  'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarity   Validator',      },     {         'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator',     },     {         'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator',     },     {         'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator',     }, ]  this list of validators can be edited to suit the needs of a project, by either removing certain rules or  inclusively making them more strict with options.1  Create and Manage Groups Django groups can be created in the Django admin. With a superuser account, access the Django admin  and you’ll see a screen like the one in Figure 10-1, and click on the ‘Groups’ link. The ‘Groups’ link takes  you to a screen like the one in Figure 10-7, and then click on the button ‘Add Group+’ in the top right. The  ‘Add Group+’ button takes you to a screen like the one in Figure 10-8 where you can create a new group  introducing its name.  1https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 topics auth passwords included-validators  450   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-7.  Django admin Groups list  Figure 10-8.  Django admin to create new group  451   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  As you can see in Figure 10-8, all that’s need to create a group is a name and you can optionally specify   permissions given to the group to do CRUD operations on Django models in the application.  The management of groups is simpler than users and can also be completely done from the Django   admin. What you’ll end up doing most of the time is assigning users to groups.  To assign a user to a group, when you’re editing a user you’ll see a selection grid for just this purpose,  which is illustrated in Figure 10-5. To edit a group’s properties - name and Create-Delete-Update Django  model permission - you can do so from the same page where you created it illustrated in Figure 10-8. To  delete a group from the Groups list illustrated in Figure 10-7, you select the group you wish to delete and  select the action from the drop-down list, as illustrated in Figure 10-9.  Figure 10-9.  Django admin to delete group   group model data is stored in the database table auth_group. and User-group relationships is stored      Tip  in the database table auth_user_groups.  Permission Types  By default, permissions in a Django project enforce certain actions. In the previous section, you learned how  users can be given the status of superuser, staff, and active, all of which are permissions designed to work  with the Django admin and the overall access workflow of a Django project. In addition, you also learned  how users or groups can be given the ability to create, delete, or update Django model records, all of which  are permissions assigned to individual Django models.  In this section, I’ll expand on the topic of permissions and describe the default behaviors of   permissions, as well as how to create your own permissions for other purposes.  452   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  User Permissions: Superuser, Staff, and Active In the previous section, you learned how to assign Django users different subtypes: superuser, staff, and  active. The following is a list of permissions associated with each of these user subtypes:   	   	   	  superuser.- Permission to create, read, update, and delete users in the Django  admin, as well as create, read, update, and delete all Django model records in a  project through the Django admin.  staff.- Permission to access the Django admin. Even if a user is marked as a  superuser, a user must also be marked as staff to access the Django admin. Users  marked as staff must be given additional permissions on each Django model to  execute tasks.  active.- Permission to log in into the application  Django admin or elsewhere . An  inactive user is effectively barred from using his credentials to authenticate into a  Django project. For example, in order to access the Django admin a user must be  marked as active – in addition to staff. Also, any section of a Django project  e.g., view  or template  can be marked to require active status, forcing users to log in.  All three user subtypes are stored in the database as part of the User model, subtypes that can be   confirmed by using the methods in Table 10-2 that belong to the User model. Although User permissions are  heavily used in the Django admin, this doesn’t mean they’re restricted to it. For example, it’s possible to rely  on a User permissions like superuser, staff, or active to allow or deny access to other parts of a Django project   e.g., a link in a template, a url view method, or others actions .  The next section on permission enforcement describes these processes in detail. Next, I’ll describe   another type of permissions that is associated with Django models.  Model Permissions: Add, Change, Delete, and Custom Model permissions are linked to the ability to create, delete, or update Django model records. In the  first section of this chapter, you can see in Figure 10-5 a selection grid to assign add, change, and delete  permissions on individual models to each user in a Django project. And in Figure 10-8, you can see an  equivalent selection grid to assign these same type of add, change, and delete permissions on individual  models for each group in a Django project.  These add, change, and delete permissions are managed at the database level through permission   model records, records that are automatically created when you run a Django model’s first migration.  Managing these types of permissions once they’re created is very straightforward, as the assignment is made  directly on a user - illustrated in Figure 10-5 - or group illustrated in Figure 10-8.   Model permission data is stored in the database table auth_permission, which also references the      Tip  django_content_type table that maintains a list of installed Django models. In addition, model permission- user relationships are stored in the database table auth_user_user_permissions and model permission-group  relationships are stored in the database table auth_group_permissions.  Similar to the behavior of user permissions, model permissions aren’t necessarily restricted to model   operations. For example, it’s perfectly possible to allow or deny access to a view or a template section if a  user or group has a certain model permission  e.g., if a User has the ability to create a Store model or change  an Item model, and allow access to a page or link .  But again, the next section on permission enforcement describes these processes in detail. Next, I’ll   describe how to customize model permissions for Django models.  453   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Model Meta permission options: default_permissions and permissions Sometimes the need can arise to change the default permissions given to a model. By default, all Django  models are given the add, change, and delete permissions. Although it’s up to an administrator to grant  these permissions to users and groups, sometimes it can be necessary to eliminate some or all of these  permissions from a Django model  e.g., eliminate the presence of the change and delete permissions from a  data-sensitive model .  In addition, sometimes it can also be necessary to add custom permissions to a model that doesn’t fit   the default add, change, and delete permissions  e.g., permissions such as give_refund or can_hire, to  assign users groups permissions to access certain parts of an application .  To alter the default permissions given to a model  i.e., add, change, and delete , you can use a   model’s meta class default_permissions field. In addition, you can add custom permissions to a model’s  permissions through a model’s meta class permissions field.  Listing 10-4 illustrates a model class that makes use of the model meta permissions and default_  permissions fields.  Listing 10-4.  Customize a Django model’s permissions with default_permissions and permissions  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30          address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      class Meta:         default_permissions =  'add',           permissions =   'give_refund','Can refund customers' , 'can_hire',   'Can hire employees'    Notice in Listing 10-4 the Store model’s default_permissions field is set to  'add', , which effectively   removes the change and delete permissions. If you add this model meta statement, you’ll notice the Store  model’s default permissions change, as illustrated in the UI Figure 10-10.  In addition, in Listing 10-4 notice the model meta permissions field sets two custom permissions:   give_refund and can_hire, where each custom permission is composed of a tuple with the first element  representing the code – used in the database – and the second element a friendly UI name. If you add this  model meta statement, you’ll notice the Store model adds these two custom permissions, as illustrated in  the UI Figure 10-10.  454   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-10.  Custom default model permissions and custom model permissions  Permission Checks and Enforcement  Now that you know about the different types of Django permissions, we can explore how to leverage these  permissions outside out of their primary context  i.e., user permissions outside the Django admin and  model permissions outside of Django CRUD operations .  Up next, you’ll learn how to change and enforce Django permissions in views, urls, templates, models,   and class-based views.  View Method Permission Checks Because view methods process incoming requests and dispatch responses to end users, they represent an  ideal location to enforce permission checks. For example, you can use a permission check on a view method  to return different content, depending if a user is logged in  i.e., is a User vs. an AnonymousUser  or is a  superuser, staff, or active subtype.  Listing 10-5 illustrates a permission check inside the logic of a view method to return different results   based on a user’s login status, as well as another variation that uses a decorator to restrict view method  access based on a user’s login status.  Listing 10-5.  Permission check in view methods with internal checks and @login_required   Internal check to see if user is anonymous or not def homepage request :     if request.user.is_anonymous  :          Logic for AnonymousUser     else:          Logic for User  455   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent   Method check to see if user is logged in or not  i.e. a User  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required  @login_required def profile request :      Logic for profile   the User model is available on all view method requests  e.g., request.user , thanks to Django's      Note  AuthenticationMiddleware that is enabled by default. see Chapter 2 for additional details on Django  middleware.  The first example in Listing 10-5 uses the is_anonymous   method available on all User models  – described in Table 10-2. If this last method determines the user making the request is anonymous –  meaning he hasn’t logged in – a certain course of action and response is taken. On the other hand, if the  is_anonymous   method determines the user making the request is logged in, another course of action and  response is taken.   You can use any User model field or method - in table 10-1 or table 10-2 - besides the is_anonymous      Tip  method to perform a check  e.g., is_staff, is_superuser .  The second example in Listing 10-5 uses the @login_required   decorator to restrict the entire view   method to logged-in users  i.e., requests that have User and blocks requests with AnonymousUser . This last  technique is helpful when known beforehand the view method doesn’t require a conditional permission  workflow like the first example in Listing 10-5.  Permissions checks on view methods can also be performed to verify if a user complies with a certain   permission test. For example, a view method can be blocked to users that belong to a certain group or to  users that have certain model permissions. Listing 10-6 illustrates three additional view method permission  checks using the @user_passes_test and @permission_required decorators.  Listing 10-6.  Permission check in view methods with @user_passes_test and @permission_required   Method check to see if User belongs to group called 'Barista' from django.contrib.auth.decorators import user_passes_test from django.contrib.auth.models import Group  @user_passes_test lambda u: Group.objects.get name='Baristas'  in u.groups.all    def dashboard request :      Logic for dashboard   Explicit method check, if User is authenticated and has permissions to change Store model   Explicit method with test def user_of_stores user :     if user.is_authenticated   and user.has_perm "stores.change_store" :         return True     else:         return False  456   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent   Method check using method @user_passes_test user_of_stores  def store_manager request :      Logic for store_manager   Method check to see if User has permissions to add Store model  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required  @permission_required 'stores.add_store'  def store_creator request :      Logic for store_creator  The first example in Listing 10-6 uses the @user_passes_test decorator and defines an inline test. The  snippet lambda u: Group.objects.get name='Baristas'  in u.groups.all   fetches the Group model  record with the name Baristas and checks if the requesting user belongs to this group. If the requesting user  does not belong to the Baristas group then the test fails and access is denied; otherwise the user is allowed  to run through the view method.  The second example also uses the @user_passes_test decorator, but instead of defining an inline test  it relies on the user_of_stores   method to perform the test logic. This is particularly helpful if the test is  complex, which can make it hard to follow inline logic, compared to having a regular method. As you can  also see in Listing 10-6, the user_of_stores   verifies if the user is authenticated and also if he has update  permissions on the Store model - note the string stores.change_store is the syntax used by Django's  Permission model records.  The last example in Listing 10-6 uses the @permission_required decorator that is designed to validate  if a user has a given Permission record. In this case, notice the decorator has the input string stores.add_ store that indicates that only users that have permission to add a Store model can run through the view  method.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A USER FAILS A PERMISSION CHECK?  For internal validation checks  e.g., those made in the body of a method, such as if request.user. is_anonymous  :  you have absolute control, so you can redirect a user to any page or add flash  messages to display on a template.  For the decorator validation checks @login_required, @user_passes_test, and @permission_ required the default failure behavior is to redirect a user to Django’s login page. Django’s default  login page UrL is  account login , a value that can be overridden with the LOGIN_URL variable in  settings.py, details of which I’ll provide in an upcoming section.  For the @permission_required decorator, it’s also possible to redirect a failed test to Django’s  http 403  Forbidden  page by adding the raise_exception=True attribute  e.g., @permission_ required 'stores.add_store',raise_exception=True  .  457   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  URL Permission Checks In certain circumstances you can have a Django workflow that doesn't involve a view method and  simply sends control from a URL directly to a static template. In such cases, it's also possible to enforce  permission checks directly on URL definitions. Listing 10-7 illustrates similar validation checks like the  ones in Listings 10-5 and 10-6 applied to URL definitions in urls.py.  Listing 10-7.  Permission checks in urls.py for static templates  from django.conf.urls import  include, url from django.views.generic import TemplateView  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required,permission_required,user_passes_ test from django.contrib.auth.models import Group  urlpatterns = [       url r'^online baristas ',          user_passes_test lambda u: Group.objects.get name='Baristas'  in u.groups.all              TemplateView.as_view template_name='online baristas.html'  ,name="onlinebaristas" ,       url r'^online dashboard ',          permission_required 'stores.add_store'            TemplateView.as_view template_name='online dashboard.html'  ,name="onlinedashboard" ,       url r'^online ',          login_required TemplateView.as_view template_name='online index.html'  ,name='online' , ]  As you can see in Listing 10-7, after you import the required decorators you just need to integrate the  validation tests in the URL definition. The @user_passes_test and @permission_required decorators are  declared as stand-alone methods followed by the URL definition  e.g., user_pass_test   TemplateView. as_view...  . The @login_required decorator though takes the TemplateView statement as its input. It  should be pointed out the behavior for failed tests in Listing 10-7 is the same as those in Listings 10-5   and 10-6, described in the sidebar “What Happens When a User Fails a Permission Check?'”  Another possibility that can arise for validation checks is to perform them on a group of view methods  URLs, so that instead of adding a decorator to each individual view method - as illustrated in Listing 10-6--  you only do it once for a whole group. This view method URL grouping process is particularly common  when defining URLs in urls.py through the include   method. Listing 10-8 illustrates how to enforce  validation checks on sets of urls that use the include   method.  Listing 10-8.  Permission checks in urls.py for include   definitions  from django.conf.urls import include, url from django.core.urlresolvers import RegexURLResolver, RegexURLPattern  class DecoratedURLPattern RegexURLPattern :     def resolve self, *args, **kwargs :         result = super DecoratedURLPattern, self .resolve *args, **kwargs          if result:             result.func = self._decorate_with result.func          return result  458   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  class DecoratedRegexURLResolver RegexURLResolver :     def resolve self, *args, **kwargs :         result = super DecoratedRegexURLResolver, self .resolve *args, **kwargs          if result:             result.func = self._decorate_with result.func          return result  def decorated_includes func, includes, *args, **kwargs :     urlconf_module, app_name, namespace = includes     patterns = getattr urlconf_module, 'urlpatterns', urlconf_module          for item in patterns:         if isinstance item, RegexURLPattern :             item.__class__ = DecoratedURLPattern             item._decorate_with = func          elif isinstance item, RegexURLResolver :             item.__class__ = DecoratedRegexURLResolver             item._decorate_with = func      return urlconf_module, app_name, namespace  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required,permission_required,user_passes_test from django.contrib.auth.models import Group  from coffeehouse.items.urls import urlpatterns as drinks_url_patterns  urlpatterns = [     url r'^items ',        decorated_includes login_required,include items_url_patterns,namespace="items"   ,     url r'^stores ',       decorated_includes permission_required 'stores.add_store' ,       include 'coffeehouse.stores.urls',namespace="stores"   ,     url r'^social ',        decorated_includes user_passes_test lambda u: Group.objects.get name='Baristas'  in   u.groups.all   ,        include 'coffeehouse.social.urls',namespace="social"   , ]  Because Django doesn't have built-in support for permissions checks in include   definitions, you can  see in Listing 10-8 we first define two custom classes followed by the custom method decorated_includes.  If you follow the sequence in Listing 10-8, you can see the decorated_includes   method accepts two input  arguments, first the permission test  e.g., login_required, permission_required  and then the standard  include   method with the URL definitions. It should also be pointed out the behavior for failed tests in  Listing 10-8 is the same as those in previous listings, described in the sidebar “What Happens When a User  Fails a Permission Check?”  Template Permission Checks Another permission check available in Django projects is in templates, a process that's helpful if you want  to show hide content  e.g., links  based on a user's permissions. Listing 10-9 illustrates a series of Django  template syntax examples.  459   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Listing 10-9.  Permission checks in templates  {% if user.is_authenticated %}    {  Content for authenticated users  } {% endif %}  {% if perms.stores.add_store %}    {  Content for users that can add stores } {% endif %}  {% for group in user.groups.all %}    {% if group.name == 'Baristas'  %}         { Content for users with 'Baristas' group }    {% endif %} {% endfor %}     Note  the user and perms variables used to perform permissions checks in templates are available thanks  to Django’s auth context processor, which is enabled by default - see Chapter 3 details on the use of Django  context processors.  You can see in Listing 10-9 all of the template syntax examples use the user and perms variables to   perform a conditional permission check. The first example checks to see if the user is authenticated through  is_authenticated. The second example verifies if perms - which holds a user's permissions - has access to  create Store model records, using Django's Permission syntax stores.add_store. And the third example in  Listing 10-9 loops over a user’s groups, to check if the user is in the Baristas group; if it's, it outputs content  for this type of user.     Tip   Loops in Django templates to check a property are very inefficient. although the last example in Listing 10-9  works, it’s a very inefficient mechanism. a better solution is to create a custom filter and perform a direct query in the  filter  e.g., {% if userhas_group:"Baristas" %}, with the has_group filter containing the bulk of the logic check .  In this case I opted for the syntax in Listing 10-9 to keep everything in one place, but be aware the more efficient  solution for this type of logic is to use a custom filter described in Chapter 3.  Class-Based View Permission Checks As you learned toward the end of Chapter 2 and in Chapter 9, class-based views provide better reusability  and encapsulation for the logic contained in view methods. However, due to the way class-based views are  composed, they require a different approach to check permissions than regular view methods presented in  Listings 10-5 and 10-6.  Although you can technically check permissions in class-based views – just like it’s done in standard  view methods – by defining a class-based view’s get   and or post   methods, this technique also forces  you to declare the bulk of a view’s logic, which is inefficient in a class-based view if all you’re trying to do is  incorporate permission checks.  Listing 10-10 illustrates a series of options to perform permission checks in class-based views.  460   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Listing 10-10.  Permission checks in class-based views  from django.views.generic import ListView from django.views.generic.detail import DetailView from django.views.generic.edit import CreateView, UpdateView, DeleteView from django.utils.decorators import method_decorator from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin  from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required,user_passes_test from django.contrib.auth.models import Group  from django.contrib.auth.mixins import LoginRequiredMixin, UserPassesTestMixin,  PermissionRequiredMixin  class ItemList LoginRequiredMixin,ListView :     model = Item     context_object_name = 'items'     template_name = 'items index.html'  class ItemDetail UserPassesTestMixin,DetailView :     model = Item     pk_url_kwarg = 'item_id'         template_name = 'items detail.html'     def test_func self :         return self.request.user.is_authenticated  class ItemCreation PermissionRequiredMixin,SuccessMessageMixin,CreateView :     model = Item     form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      success_message = "Item % name s created successfully"     permission_required =  'items.add_item',   @method_decorator login_required, name='dispatch'  class ItemUpdate SuccessMessageMixin,UpdateView :     model = Item     pk_url_kwarg = 'item_id'         form_class = ItemForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      success_message = "Item % name s updated successfully"  @method_decorator user_passes_test lambda u: Group.objects.get name='Baristas'  in u.groups. all   , name='dispatch'  class ItemDelete DeleteView :     model = Item     pk_url_kwarg = 'item_id'         success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'   461   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  The first class-based view in Listing 10-10 ItemList uses the LoginRequiredMixin mixin to enforce   that only logged-in users are able to access the class-based view. The second class-based view ItemDetail  uses another mixin named UserPassesTestMixin to ensure that only users that pass a permission test  are allowed to access the class-based view. To define a permission test for a class-based view that uses  the UserPassesTestMixin mixin, notice the test_func   method is used. This last method gains access  to a user – via self.request – and returns a True or False value based on the test, which in Listing 10-10  consists of simply calling is_authenticated.  The third class-based view in Listing 10-10 ItemCreation uses the PermissionRequiredMixin mixin   to enforce only users that have certain model permissions are allowed access to the class-based view.  To declare model permissions on a class-based view that uses the PermissionRequiredMixin mixin, the  permission_required option is used with a tuple value of permissions. In the case of Listing 10-10, the   'items.add_item',  value follows the model permission syntax  . , ensuring  only users that have permission to add Item records to the items app are allowed access the class-based view.  The last two class-based views in Listing 10-10 ItemUpdate and ItemDelete make use of the @method_ decorator decorator to enforce class-based permissions. The @method_decorator decorator is specifically  designed to apply standard view method decorators – like the ones used in Listings 10-5 and 10-6 – to class- based view methods, accepting two arguments: a decorator and the class-based view method on which to  apply the decorator. In the case of Listing 10-10, you can see the ItemUpdate class-based view applies the  login_required decorator to the dispatch   method to only allow logged-in users to access the class-based  view. And the ItemDelete class-based view applies the user_passes_test decorator to the dispatch    method to only allow users that belong to the Baristas group access to the class-based view.  User Authentication and Auto-Management  In the first section of this chapter you learned how to create users. But recall that for this process to work, you  either had to use a Django command-line tool or the Django admin. These techniques, while valid, are not  intended and won't scale for end users that visit an application.  Similarly, up to this point in the chapter, the only location for users to log in and log out has been   through the Django admin authentication form. This last form is not an ideal location for end users either,  not only because it lacks a layout made for an application, but also because it’s not intended for users who  never plan to interact with a project’s database.  If you plan on end users authenticating themselves into an application, you need to provide a way for   users to sign up, a way for users to log in, and log out as well as a way for users to remember and change their  passwords. The same django.contrib.auth package that supports the User model also includes a series of  prebuilt constructs designed to create user authentication workflows.  The first prebuilt mechanism available to authenticate users is a set of urls that allow users to log in and  log out of an application, allow users to change their password, as well as allow users to reset their password  supported by an email notification.  Listing 10-11 illustrates how to add the full set of django.contrib.auth urls to the main urls.py   file – using an include statement – as well as the equivalent individual url statements in case you want to  selectively pick and choose which urls to use in a project.  Listing 10-11.  Configure urls from django.contrib.auth package  from django.conf.urls import url from django.contrib.auth import views   Option 1 to include all urls  See option 2 for included urls  urlpatterns = [     url r'^accounts ', include 'django.contrib.auth.urls'  , ]  462   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent   Option 2   Explicit urls, all included in django.contrib.auth  urlpatterns = [     url r'^accounts login $', views.LoginView.as_view  , name='login' ,     url r'^accounts logout $', views.LogoutView.as_view  , name='logout' ,      url r'^accounts password_change $', views.PasswordChangeView.as_view  , name='password_change' ,     u rl r'^accounts password_change done $', views.PasswordChangeDoneView.as_view  ,   name='password_change_done' ,      url r'^accounts password_reset $', views.PasswordResetView.as_view  , name='password_reset' ,      url r'^accounts password_reset done $', views.PasswordResetDoneView.as_view  ,        url r'^accounts reset  ?P [0-9A-Za-z_\-]+   ?P [0-9A-Za-z]  name='password_reset_done' ,  {1,13}-[0-9A-Za-z]{1,20}  $',          views.PasswordResetConfirmView.as_view  , name='password_reset_confirm' ,      url r'^accounts reset done $', views.PasswordResetCompleteView.as_view  ,   name='password_reset_complete' ,  ]  The first option in Listing 10-11 configures all the django.contrib.auth urls on the accounts url. This  begets the question, why the accounts url? Because, by default all django.contrib.auth actions use this url  as their root  e.g., in previous sections, recall that attempting to access resources that require login performs  a redirect to  accounts login . So by using this url include   statement with django.contrib.auth.urls,  all django.contrib.auth actions get a functioning url, which are also backed by the necessary view method  logic! But more on view method logic shortly.  Because the url include   statement has a 'use all urls or none' behavior, the second option in Listing 10-11   represents the use of granular url statements to configure the same django.contrib.auth urls. This last option  is helpful if you want to disable certain django.contrib.auth urls but still keep other django.contrib.auth urls  active  e.g., disable password changing urls, but keep login and logout urls .  As you can see, using either option in Listing 10-11 provides you with a quick solution to hook up   django.contrib.auth actions to urls, the latter of which are also hooked up to default class-based views that  are also part of the django.contrib.auth package.  Login and Logout Workflow The entry points into the login and logout workflows – as you can see in Listing 10-11 – are the  accounts  login  and  accounts logout  urls, respectively. If a call is made on the  accounts login  url the django. contrib.auth.views.LoginView class-based view is triggered, and if a call is made on the  accounts  logout  url the django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView class-based view is triggered.  Like all Django built-in class-based views, both the LoginView and LogoutView class-based views   require little to nothing in terms of code and configuration. The only thing they both require is a template to  present a login form and a template with a logout success message, respectively.  The LoginView class-based view looks for the template registration login.html under a directory   defined as part of the TEMPLATES DIRS variable in settings.py. And the LogoutView class-based view looks  for the template registration logout.html, also under a directory defined as part of the TEMPLATES DIRS  variable in settings.py.   see the book’s accompanying source code for the layout and fields required by the registration      Tip  login.html and registration logout.html templates.  463   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  The login workflow offers two configuration options in settings.py that allow you to modify its   behavior without the need to customize the LoginView class-based view. The LOGIN_URL variable defaults to   accounts login  and is used as the url where users are redirected when they attempt to access resources  that require authentication and aren’t logged in. The LOGIC_REDIRECT variable defaults to  accounts  profile  and is the url where users are redirected to after a successful log in. The django.contrib.auth  package provides no entry point for the  accounts profile  url, so you must either configure this url or  simply change it to a different location  e.g., LOGIN_REDIRECT=' ' to redirect users to the home page after a  successful login .  The logout workflow supports the LOGOUT_REDIRECT variable in settings.py to define where users are  taken when they log out. The LOGOUT_REDIRECT variable defaults to  accounts logout , but can be updated  to redirect users to a different location  e.g., LOGOUT_REDIRECT=' ' to redirect users to the home page after  they log out .  Other than creating the templates, setting up the urls – described in Listing 10-11 – and optionally  changing the login url location and login out redirect behaviors, there is nothing else you need to do to  enable the login and logout workflows provided by the django.contrib.auth package. If you want a user to  log in, simply point them to the  accounts login  url and if you want them to log out point them to the   accounts logout  url. All the other workflow details  e.g., authentication, password verification, error form  handling, session expiration  are taken care of by the LoginView and LogoutView class-based views.  Password Change Workflow The password change workflow requires two url entry points: the  accounts password_change  url that  triggers the PasswordChangeView class-based view and the  accounts password_change done  url that  triggers the PasswordChangeDoneView class-based view.  The PasswordChangeView class-based view looks for a template containing a form to change passwords   in registration password_change_form.html under a directory defined as part of the TEMPLATES DIRS  variable in settings.py. And the PasswordChangeDoneView class-based view looks for a template containing  a success message in registration password_change_done.html, also under a directory defined as part of  the TEMPLATES DIRS variable in settings.py.   see the book’s accompanying source code for the layout and fields required by the registration      Tip  password_change_form.html and registration password_change_done .html templates.  Other than creating the templates and setting up the urls – described in Listing 10-11 – there is nothing   else you need to do to enable the password change workflow provided by the django.contrib.auth  package. If you want a user to change his password, simply point them to the  accounts password_change   url. All the other workflow details  e.g., password verification, database update, form error handling  are  taken care of by the PasswordChangeView and PasswordChangeDoneView class-based views.  Password Reset Workflow The password reset workflow consists of two sub-workflows. The first sub-workflow captures a user’s email  and sends him an email with a link to reset his password. The second sub-workflow processes the reset link  and validates a new password for the user.  The first sub-workflow uses the  accounts password_reset  url, which triggers the   PasswordResetView class-based view and the  accounts password_reset done  url, which triggers the  PasswordResetDoneView class-based view. The second sub-workflow uses the  accounts reset  url, which  triggers the PasswordResetConfirmView class-based view and the  accounts reset done  url, which  triggers the PasswordResetCompleteView class-based view.  464   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  The PasswordResetView class-based view looks for a template containing a form to reset a user’s  password in registration password_reset_form.html and the PasswordResetDoneView class-based  view looks for a success message template in registration password_reset_done.html, both under a  directory defined as part of the TEMPLATES DIRS variable in settings.py. For the second sub-workflow,  the PasswordResetConfirmView class-based view looks for a template with a form to introduce a new user  password in registration password_reset_confirm.html and the PasswordResetCompleteView class- based view looks for a success message template in registration password_reset_complete.html, both  under a directory defined as part of the TEMPLATES DIRS variable in settings.py.  By default, the password reset workflow generates an email with instructions to take a user to the   second sub-workflow to reset his password. Also by default, the reset email contains a link to the domain  localhost:8000, which can be customized by installing the Django site django.contrib.sites app  e.g.,  add django.contrib.sites to INSTALLED_APPS and SITE_ID=1 in settings.py, and update the site with id  1 in the Django admin to reflect a new domain . Additionally, you can define a custom email layout in the  registration password_reset_email.html template and place it under a directory defined as part of the  TEMPLATES variable in settings.py.   see the book’s accompanying source code for the layout and fields required by the registration      Tip  password_reset_form.html, registration password_reset_done.html, registration password_reset_ confirm.html, registration password_reset_complete.html, and registration password_reset_ email.html templates.  Other than creating the templates and setting up the urls – described in Listing 10-11 – and optionally   changing the default email layout, there is nothing else you need to do to enable or allow users to remember  their passwords using workflow provided by the django.contrib.auth package. If you want a user to  remember his password, simply point them to the  accounts password_reset  url. All the other workflow  details  e.g., email token validation, password verification, database update, form error handling  are  taken care of by the PasswordResetView, PasswordResetDoneView, PasswordResetConfirmView, and  PasswordResetCompleteView class-based views.  User Signup Workflow Users can sign up automatically to a Django application with the help of a few constructs from the django. contrib.auth package. Although the user signup workflow is not as baked in to the django.contrib.auth  package as the previous user-related workflows, it’s still easy to create.  The first step to create a user signup workflow is to configure a url entry point to allow users to create an   account, as illustrated in Listing 10-12.  Listing 10-12.  Configure url for user sing up workflow   urls.py main from django.conf.urls import url from django.contrib.auth import views  from coffeehouse.registration import views as registration_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^accounts ', include 'django.contrib.auth.urls'  ,     url r'^accounts signup $',registration_views.UserSignUp.as_view  ,name="signup" ,     ]  465   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Listing 10-12 illustrates a url accessible at  accounts signup , in addition to all the urls provided by   the django.contrib.auth package that include the previous user-related workflows. Notice the  accounts  signup  url is set to be processed by the UserSignUp class-based view from the coffeehouse.registration  app, which means it’s a class-based view you need to create for the project.  Listing 10-13 illustrates the UserSignUp class-based view tasked with the user signup workflow, which  automates the creation of User model records, which was previously done using the Django command-line  tool or the Django admin.  Listing 10-13.  Signup workflow fulfilled by custom CreateView class-based view  from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse_lazy from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect from django.contrib.messages.views import SuccessMessageMixin  from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login  class UserSignupForm UserCreationForm :     email = forms.EmailField required=True      class Meta:         model = User         fields =  "username", "email", "password1", "password2"   class UserSignUp SuccessMessageMixin,CreateView :     model = User     form_class = UserSignupForm     success_url = reverse_lazy 'items:index'      success_message = "User created successfully"     template_name = "registration signup.html"     def form_valid self, form :         super UserSignUp,self .form_valid form                   The form is valid, automatically sign-in the user         user = authenticate self.request, username=form.cleaned_data['username'],                                                  password=form.cleaned_data['password1']          if user == None:              User not validated for some reason, return standard form_valid   response             return self.render_to_response self.get_context_data form=form                       else:              Log the user in             login self.request, user               Redirect to success url             return HttpResponseRedirect self.get_success_url     The UserSignUp class-based view in Listing 10-13 is a standard CreateView class-based view that uses   the mixin SuccessMessageMixin – if you’re unfamiliar with this type of class-based view to create model  records or the concept of mixins, see the previous chapter, which explains both these topics.  The UserSignUp class-based view sets the model option to User to tell Django to create django.  contrib.auth.models.User records. Next, the form_class option is set to UserSignupForm that is also  defined in Listing 10-13. Followed are the success_url and success_message options to indicate a url and  success message when a User record is created, as well as the template_name to specify a template with the  form presented to capture the User fields.  466   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  The custom UserSignupForm model form in Listing 10-13 is based on the UserCreationForm from   the django.contrib.auth package. From a practical standpoint, the UserSignUp class-based view could  have used UserCreationForm as its form_class, however, this last built-in form only contains username  and password fields. In this case, to solicit an email as part of the user signup process, the custom  UserSignupForm model form adds the email field to the base UserCreationForm form class. Note that  because the backing User model already includes an email field, no modification is required to the model.  In order to automatically sign in users once a User model record is created, the UserSignUp class-based   view includes custom logic in its form_valid   method. In the case of Listing 10-13, the authenticate  method from the django.contrib.auth package is invoked with the form values, verifying the credentials  are valid. If the credentials are valid – which given the workflow should be 100% of the time, unless an  unforeseen hacking event takes place – the authenticate method returns a User instance and immediately  executes the login method – also from the django.contrib.auth package – which creates a session  i.e.,  signs in  the user, after which control is redirected to the success page of the class-based view. In the  unforeseen event the authenticate method doesn’t return a User instance, the form_valid   method  returns its standard payload, which is the validated form.  As you can see from Listings 10-12 and 10-13, you can create a user signup workflow to let users create  their own accounts and lift the administrative burden of creating user accounts from the Django admin or  Django command-line tool.   the signup workflow in Listing 10-13 is permissive in the sense it doesn’t verify emails and      Tip  automatically signs users in. this was done for simplicity and may work for most projects as is. But you can  add extra safeguards to the signup workflow  e.g., send a verification link, set users to inactive until verification  link is clicked  by adding this logic to the different class-based view methods, before or after the User record is  created.   the Django allauth package, described later in this chapter, has built-in support for email      Tip 2  verification.  Custom User Model Fields  The default Django User model  i.e., django.contrib.auth.models.User class , uses a minimum set of data  fields, which include username, email, first_name, last_name, date_joined, and last_login; in addition to  the permission related fields password, is_superuser, is_staff, and is_active.  While these last fields are enough for Django’s built-in user functionality, they can fall short if you’re   expecting to store additional user data  e.g., age, telephone, address . There are two approaches to support  additional user data: create a separate model to store additional data and create a user relationship to it   i.e., a User with a ForeignKey  or override the default django.contrib.auth.models.User class to create a  custom user class.  Listing 10-14 illustrates the first technique by creating an additional model to store extra user data and   creating a relationship to the django.contrib.auth.models.User class.  Listing 10-14.  Model with extra user fields related to default Django user model  from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.db import models  467   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  class UserExtra models.Model :     user = models.ForeignKey User      age = models.IntegerField blank=True,null=True      telephone = models.CharField max_length=15,blank=True,null=True   The UserExtra model in Listing 10-14 functions like any other model with a ForeignKey data type, and   as such, has some performance and maintenance implications when used in these circumstances. On the  negative side, the user data is distributed in two database tables. One table for User records and another for  UserExtra records, which inevitably requires two queries or a join query to obtain all data for a given user  – see Chapter 7 for queries across model relationships. On the positive side, this technique keeps a project’s  default Django User model class intact, requiring no additional configuration or development effort.  Next, let’s take a look at the second technique that consists of creating a custom user class, a process   that’s illustrated in Listing 10-15.  Listing 10-15.  Custom User model to override default Django User model   models.py  app registration  from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser from django.db import models  class CoffeehouseUser AbstractUser :     age = models.IntegerField blank=True,null=True      telephone = models.CharField max_length=15,blank=True,null=True    admin.py  app registration  from django.contrib import admin from .models import CoffeehouseUser  class CoffeehouseUserAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     pass  admin.site.register CoffeehouseUser, CoffeehouseUserAdmin    settings.py AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'registration.CoffeehouseUser'  The first section in Listing 10-15 shows the CoffeehouseUser class to be used as the custom user class.  Notice the class inherits its behavior from the AbstractUser class that gives it the same fields and behaviors  as the default User class  e.g., username, email, etc. . Next, the CoffeehouseUser class declares the age and  telephone fields using standard model fields, giving the custom user class two more fields than the default  User class.  Because the custom CoffeehouseUser class will override a project’s default User class, this means the  default django.contrib.auth.models.User class is no longer used. Therefore, you must configure Django  to use the custom CoffeehouseUser class anywhere user logic is required.  The second section in Listing 10-15 shows the Django admin configuration necessary to access the   new custom user class from the Django admin and be able to create, read, update, and delete users, just like  it’s done with the standard django.contrib.auth.models.User model class. Note the next chapter covers  Django admin configuration in greater detail.  Finally, the third section in Listing 10-15 shows the Django settings.py file with the AUTH_USER_MODEL   set to registration.CoffeehouseUser, where registration represents the app name and CoffeehouseUser  the custom user model. This last configuration ensures user logic made throughout a project is made on the  CoffeehouseUser model and not the default User model.  468   Once you run the migration operation with this custom user model class and configurations from   Listing 10-15, you’ll see Django project users gain two additional fields.  Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent     Caution  Custom user model implementations like the one in Listing 10-15 should only be done at the  outset of a project  i.e., one of the first project migrations .  Because a user model plays such a central role in managing access to a Django project, you should not   attempt to implement custom user models like the one in Listing 10-15 midway through a project. Doing  so runs the risk of breaking dependencies – foreign keys – used by other models to refer to default django. contrib.auth.models.User model records; in addition, this also changes the underlying database table  where user data is stored. By implementing a custom user model at the outset of a project, you guarantee  any possible model dependencies made on a user are done against custom user records and user data is  stored in a single database table from the outset.  In fact, if you plan to use a custom user model, but don’t know which new fields to add at the outset, you   can create a placeholder user model like the following:  class CoffeehouseUser AbstractUser :       pass  This snippet creates a model identical to the default django.contrib.auth.models.User class, but lays  the groundwork to create user dependencies on the custom model, while allowing the ability to add fields to  the custom model as they’re needed with standard migrations like any other model.  Finally, another factor to take into account when using a custom user model – which isn’t obvious   in Listing 10-15 – is how to reference a custom user model in other places of a project. When you use the  default User class, the statement from django.contrib.auth.models import User is commonplace  in models.py and views.py files to reference a user, but with a custom model this reference is no longer  applicable.  To support custom user models, Django offers the helper method get_user_model that returns a  reference to whatever user model is defined in the AUTH_USER_MODEL variable in settings.py. In this  manner, you can use the statement from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model to obtain a  reference to a project’s user model from anywhere in a project. The next section contains an example that  uses the get_user_model method.  Custom Authentication Back Ends  An authentication process is important because it determines which users are allowed access to an  application. The default authentication process used by Django consists of comparing a username and  password – provided on a web form – against User records in a database. If the username and password  match against a User record, the authentication process is deemed successful, but if the values don’t match,  then the authentication process is deemed a failure.  Django itself includes a series of built-in authentication back-end classes2 to support variations of   this authentication process. In addition, in the final section of this chapter I’ll introduce you to the allauth  Django package that supports a series’ authentication back ends  e.g., authentication against social media  accounts .  2https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref contrib auth module-django.contrib.auth.backends  469   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  But to illustrate the concept of a custom authentication back end from the ground up, I’ll create a simple  authentication back end that relies on emails for authentication and can use any user type  i.e., custom user  models or the default User model .  By default, Django projects use the django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend authentication   back-end class, designed to compare username and password sets – provided by an end user – against  a project’s users in a database. Now ask yourself, what do you think is easier to remember as a login  credential, a username or an email? If you’re like most people in this day in age, you’re more likely to have  answered email.  Listing 10-16 illustrates a custom authentication back end that is able to authenticate users by means of   an email credential and not the default username.  Listing 10-16.  Custom authentication back end to support authentication with email   models.py  registration app  from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model  class EmailBackend object :     def authenticate self, request, username=None, password=None, **kwargs :         User = get_user_model           try:             user = User.objects.get email=username          except User.DoesNotExist:             return None         else:             if getattr user, 'is_active', False  and  user.check_password password :                 return user         return None     def get_user self, user_id :         User = get_user_model                   try:             return User.objects.get pk=user_id          except User.DoesNotExist:             return None   setting.py AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',                                         'coffeehouse.registration.models.EmailBackend']  Listing 10-16 declares the EmailBackend class for the custom authentication back end. Like all custom   authentication back-end classes, you must declare at minimum the authenticate   and get_user    methods, where the first method is used to define the authentication logic and the second to return the user  of the request.  The authenticate   method gains access to both the username and password fields provided by an   end user, as part of the base authentication workflow. Next, you can see the authenticate   method gains  access to a project’s user model relying on the get_user_model   method helper, which ensures that even  if a project uses a custom user model, the authentication workflow is done on the correct user class, as  described in the previous section.  Once a reference is obtained to a project’s user class, notice the authenticate   method performs a query   for a user on the email field with the provided username, which effectively allows the username value provided  by a user to be treated as an email field for authentication purposes. If a user matches the email provided as  the username value, then the try-except-else block in Listing 10-16 performs a call to check_password      470   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  to validate the password against the matching user. If the password matches, authenticate   returns the  authenticated user, and if the password doesn’t match authenticate   returns None.  The final section in Listing 10-16 is the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS variable in settings.py, which is   assigned a list of authentication back-end classes. In this case, the default django.contrib.auth.backends. ModelBackend class is kept to ensure the default authentication workflow of username password is  attempted first. Next, the custom EmailBackend authentication back-end class from Listing 10-16 is added,  to ensure the authentication workflow is done treating the input data as an email password set.  As you can see from this example in Listing 10-16, by adding this simple custom authentication back- end class, you can allow users to introduce either their username or email to authenticate themselves in a  Django application.   If you use the custom authentication back-end class in Listing 10-16, change the username label in      Tip  the login form to 'Username email' to notify users they can use both.  User Management with Django allauth  As you’ve see throughout this chapter, the django.contrib.auth package provides a great deal of  functionality to manage users and groups, permissions, as well as authentication workflows. But as you’ve  probably also realized, the django.contrib.auth package can also suffer from a lot of legacy behaviors that  don’t work well for web applications in today’s day and age. For example, django.contrib.auth doesn’t  support things like social authentication – which is almost a requirement in today’s Internet – in addition,  django.contrib.auth is also designed to work with usernames out of th -box – and not emails – which is  also a very outdated practice.  Still because the django.contrib.auth package is built into Django, there are often many Django   packages  e.g., the Django admin and other third-party packages  that assume a Django project uses the  django.contrib.auth package and its functionalities.  So on the one hand, it’s essential you keep using the django.contrib.auth package to maintain user   management compatibility across other Django packages that expect the presence of django.contrib.auth,  but on the other, you don’t want to be stuck with 2005 practices asking users to provide usernames and not  allowing them to authenticate with social media accounts.  Among the many third-party packages and potential solutions available to solve this Django user   management integration, the Django allauth package offers one of the best features set  e.g., social  authentication and email based users , as well as the best integration with the django.contrib.auth  package. So up next, I’ll describe the setup process for the Django allauth package.  Install and Set Up django-allauth To install the Django allauth package, use the following pip statement:  pip install django-allauth  Once you make the installation, let’s create a base Django allauth configuration with the intent to fulfill   the following user management features:   	 Use email as the primary user identifier, but maintain username credentials for   compatibility with other packages  e.g., Django admin .  Require email verification to avoid junk users.   	  	  Set the foundations to add Django social authentication  Facebook, Google, Twitter.   471   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Listing 10-17 illustrates the necessary additions to make to a project’s settings.py file, to enable a base   Django allauth configuration with these features.  Listing 10-17.  Base Django allauth settings.py configuration   Ensure the 'django.contrib.sites' is declared in INSTALLED_APPS  And also add the allauth, allauth.account and allauth.socialaccount to INSTALLED_APPS  INSTALLED_APPS = [      Django sites app  required     'django.contrib.sites',     'allauth',     'allauth.account',     'allauth.socialaccount', ]   Ensure SITE_ID is set sites app SITE_ID = 1   Add the 'allauth' backend to AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND and keep default ModelBackend AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [ 'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',                            'allauth.account.auth_backends.AuthenticationBackend']   EMAIL_BACKEND so allauth can proceed to send confirmation emails  ONLY for development testing use console EMAIL_BACKEND='django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'   Custom allauth settings  Use email as the primary identifier ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email' ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True  Make email verification mandatory to avoid junk email accounts ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'mandatory'  Eliminate need to provide username, as it's a very old practice ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False  In addition to the changes in Listing 10-17 to the settings.py file, you'll also need to register the   Django allauth url entry points in the main urls.py file. Listing 10-18 illustrates the changes you need to  make to the main urls.py file.  Listing 10-18.  Django allauth url configuration urls.py  urlpatterns = [     ...     url r'^accounts ', include 'allauth.urls'  ,     ... ]  As you can see in Listing 10-18, the url regular expression tells Django to mount the Django allauth   allauth.urls urls under the  accounts  path, just like it’s done for the standard Django django.contrib. auth package urls back in Listing 10-11.  472   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Django allauth uses the same url patterns and behaviors almost exactly as the standard django.contrib.  auth package. This means Django allauth configures its login page at the  accounts login  url and the  logout page at the  accounts logout  url. Django allauth does include a series of new urls in its include    statement from Listing 10-18  e.g., email verification , but I’ll describe these new urls as we move forward. Similarly, the same settings.py variables used for authentication purposes by the standard django.  contrib.auth package are also applicable to Django allauth. For example, you can set LOGIN_URL to override  the default  accounts login  url location and you can also set the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL that defaults to the   accounts profile  url. In fact, just like the django.contrib.auth package, Django allauth doesn’t include  the  accounts profile  url entry point, so you may as well override the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL variable in  settings.py to point to another url  e.g., LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL=' ' to redirect the user to the home page  after a successful login .  Finally, once you’ve followed these configuration steps, you need to do the following miscellaneous   steps to ensure Django allauth runs correctly:   	   	  Run python manage.py migrate from the command line, to ensure all the database  tables required by Django allauth are created.  Ensure the django.contrib.sites package reflects the application's domain. By  default, the django.contrib.sites defaults to the domain example.com, you can  change this value in the Django admin to ensure certain features  e.g., email  use the  correct application domain.  First Log In and Log Out with Superuser in Django allauth First, create a Django superuser using any of the techniques outlined at the start of this chapter in Listing 10-1  and take note of the email. Next, go straight to the  accounts login  url and you'll see a page like the one  illustrated in Figure 10-11.  Figure 10-11.  Django allauth defult login screen  473   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Now let’s pause for a second and contemplate what Django allauth just provided. Figure 10-11   illustrates a login page for which you didn’t even have to create its template – unlike the django.contrib. auth log in workflow. In addition, notice the login form in Figure 10-11 asks for an email credential and you  didn’t even need to create a custom authentication back end to support this functionality either.  Next, introduce the superuser email password into the sign-in form in Figure 10-11 and click on the   ‘Sign in’ button, if the credentials are correct, you’ll be redirected to a ‘Verify your E-mail address’ page. This  is by design, remember in Listing 10-17 the base Django allauth configuration enforce email verification   ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'mandatory' ; therefore until the user’s email address is verified, access  is denied.  If you’re using the same email settings described in Listing 10-17 – to send emails to the console – you   will see an email like the one in Listing 10-18 where you’re running the Django development server.  Listing 10-18.  Confirm email for new user in django-allauth  MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text plain; charset="utf-8" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Subject: [coffeehouse.com] Please Confirm Your E-mail Address From: webmaster@localhost To: cashier@coffeehouse.com Date: Wed, 12 Aug 2018 00:57:50 -0000 Message-ID:    Hello from coffeehouse.com!  You're receiving this e-mail because user daniel at example.com has given yours as an e-mail  address to connect their account.  To confirm this is correct, go to http:  localhost:8000 accounts confirm-email 1aflixsbb6sn1 4hptkntiyrgvk1r0pppqsurx6fxrs6wmlb96u8y3gotxzep0qie   Thank you from coffeehouse.com! coffeehouse.com  Copy and paste the verification link in the email to your browser. Once you click on the verification   link, you’ll be asked to confirm the user’s email. When you click on the ‘Confirm’ button to make the final  verification, you’ll be sent to the  accounts login  url once again showing a small flash message indicating  the account was confirmed.  Now reintroduce the superuser email password into the sign-in form in Figure 10-11 once again and  click on the ‘Sign in’ button. This time you’ll be redirected to  accounts profile  url or the url defined in  the LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL variable in settings.py.  At this point, you’re logged into the application as a superuser using the login workflow form provided   by Django allauth. Next, go directly to the Django admin  admin  url and you can confirm you’re able to  access it directly! In this case, there’s no need to reauthenticate yourself using the Django admin form,  because you already logged in using the Django allauth workflow.  Finally, in order to log out of the application you can visit the  accounts logout  url, where you’ll be  presented with a confirmation question asking if you’re sure you want to log out, and clicking on the ‘Sign  out’ button materializes the log out action.  As you can see from this exercise, Django allauth provides very tight integration with the standard login   workflow used by the Django admin and the django.contrib.auth package, on top of the features already  outlined: email verification, built-in templates, built-in authentication workflow with email, and backward  compatibility with usernames.  474   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  User Signup with Django allauth If you review the  accounts login  url illustrated in Figure 10-11, you can see there’s a ‘Sign up’ link that  takes you to the URL  accounts signup . Click on this link, and you’ll be presented with a form that asks for  an email and a password to create a user account.  Once you fill out the form, click on the ‘Sign up’ button. If the submission is successful, you’ll be   redirected to the ‘Verify your E-mail address’ page. This is the same behavior described in the previous  section, due to Django allauth requiring email verification before allowing access to an application.  Similarly, proceed to inspect the email generated by Django allauth and copy-paste the verification   link to complete the user sign up process. Next, you can proceed to log in with this user’s credentials, which  default to a regular user.  An interesting point about this signup process that may not be obvious, is Django allauth creates a user   using only his email, which raises some questions: What happens if this user later becomes a superuser or  staff member to access the Django admin? Will the Django admin login form that relies on usernames not  work? Nothing of the sort; it will work as expected.  Behind the scenes, Django allauth creates a regular Django user and integrates it with Django allauth   features  e.g., email login, social authentication . This built-in integration is an excellent feature because you  get all the benefits of Django allauth, plus users get to keep Django’s default user management where the  same user can get Django admin access, superuser and staff permissions, ability to belong to groups, and  permission assignment.  The convention Django allauth uses to create usernames is to take an email’s local part  i.e., anything  before @  as the username handle. For cases where multiple emails with the same name create an account,  Django allauth assign a digit to the username  e.g.nancy@coffeehouse.com=nancy, nancy@hotmail. com=nancy2, nancy@gmail.com=nancy3 .  Password Reset and Change with Django allauth One of the most common management tasks required by users is often related to passwords, whether it’s  resetting their password because they forgot it or changing it for security reasons. Django allauth provides  built-in support for both these password scenarios. If you go to the  accounts password reset  url, you’ll  see a form where a user can introduce his email to reset his password.  Once you introduce an email on this last form, click on the ‘Reset My Password’ button and Django   allauth sends a confirmation email like the one in Listing 10-19 with a password reset link.  Listing 10-19.  Reset email for new password django-allauth  MIME-Version: 1.0 Content-Type: text plain; charset="utf-8" Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit Subject: [coffeehouse.com] Password Reset E-mail From: webmaster@localhost To: nancy@coffeehouse.com Date: Wed, 19 Aug 2018 03:05:09 -0000 Message-ID:    Hello from coffeehouse.com!  You're receiving this e-mail because you or someone else has requested a password for your  user account at coffeehouse.com. It can be safely ignored if you did not request a password reset. Click the link below to  reset your password.  475   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  http:  localhost:8000 accounts password reset key 5-44f-0f6fbf1251fd33ee4b40   Thank you for using coffeehouse.com! coffeehouse.com -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Next, if you click on the reset link in the email, you’ll be taken to another page where you can introduce  a new password. After you click on the ‘Change password’ button, and if the process is successful, you’ll see  a password confirmation flash message indicating the user password was updated.  The other option available in django-allauth related to passwords is to allow a user to change their  password while they’re logged in. If you go to the  accounts password change  url, you’ll see a screen  with a form to introduce a new password. After you click on the ‘Change Password’ button, you’ll see a  confirmation message on the same screen indicating the user password was updated.  Add and Change User Email with Django allauth To aid users in the possibility of changing their initial email signup address, Django allauth has a dedicated  page to manage email addresses. If you go to the  accounts email  url, you’ll see the page illustrated in  Figure 10-12.  Figure 10-12.  Django allauth email management  As you can see in Figure 10-12, in addition to the possibility of adding other emails to the account,   a user can also change his primary email, resend a verification for an email, or even remove an email  associated with an account.  476   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Change Templates for Django allauth The Django allauth built-in templates provide basic functionality as you’ve seen in the previous sections. All  the built-in templates inherit their behavior from a template named base.html and their content is enclosed  in {% block content %}{% block %}. This means you can create a template called base.html in your  Django project with all the elements you wish  e.g., custom colors, header menu  and declare the {% block  content %}{% block %} in it and the Django allauth built-in templates are rendered in this context.  If you want to fully customize the templates used by Django allauth  e.g., to include mobile-friendly   forms or some other deep change , you can provide overriding templates in your Django project.  Django allauth relies on over 15 HTML templates and 6 email templates; for this reason, it’s easier if  you copy the Django allauth default templates to your Django project and then modify them as needed.  You should ensure the Django allauth templates are copied with their original account subfolder that  should be accessible under a DIRS value of the TEMPLATES variable in settings.py. Depending on your  Python installation, the default Django allauth templates can be found on the path  lib python3.5 site- packages allauth templates .     Tip    see the book’s accompanying source code, which includes the layout of all Django allauth templates.  Models and Database Tables Behind Django allauth Although Django allauth leverages Django’s default user model django.contrib.auth.models.User or a  custom user model if it’s provided as part of the AUTH_USER_MODEL configuration, Django allauth relies on a  series of new models to support its advanced user management features. Figure 10-13 illustrates the Django  admin showcasing the series of Django allauth models.  Figure 10-13.  Django admin with models for django-allauth  477   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  The first Django allauth inclusion illustrated in Figure 10-13 corresponds to the ‘Accounts’ app, which  includes the ‘Email addresses’ model. The ‘Email addresses’ model keeps track of emails, their association  to user model records  e.g., django.contrib.auth.models.User , the primary email status, as well as an  email’s verification status. It should be noted ‘Email addresses’ model records are stored in the account_ emailaddress database table.  It’s also worth mentioning that in Figure 10-13 you can see the standard ‘User’ and ‘Group’ models from   the django.contrib.auth.models.User package. Django allauth continues to make use of a project’s user  model to store core user data  e.g., passwords   The second set of Django allauth models included in Figure 10-13 correspond to social accounts, which  are used to allow Django authentication on social media sites  e.g., Facebook, Google, Twitter , which is the  topic of the next and last section in this chapter.  Social Authentication with Django allauth  Social authentication involves creating workflows - also known as applications - on third-party sites  e.g.,  Facebook, Google, Twitter  to allow users of such sites the ability to reuse their identity to access external  resources - which in our case will be Django applications. This ability is a very valuable feature in Django  applications, because it allows users to register in a few clicks, instead of going through a more involved  registration process.  At the most basic level, social authentication processes involve tokens that are authorized by users,   which are then exchanged between third-party sites and the requesting party  i.e., your Django application   to indicate a user’s consent. In addition, depending on the application and its configuration, the requesting  party  i.e., the Django application  can solicit basic user information  e.g., email , as well as more elaborate  information  e.g., a user’s friends in a Facebook application  from the third-party site.   the following sections assumes you’ve already set up a base Django allauth configuration, as      Note  described in the previous section.  Set Up Django allauth for Different Social Providers There are many social providers supported by Django allauth and each provider is supported through its own  package that needs to be added to the list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py as illustrated in Listing 10-20.  Listing 10-20.  Social provider app installation for Django allauth in settings.py  INSTALLED_APPS = [      Django sites framework is required     'django.contrib.sites',     'allauth',     'allauth.account',     'allauth.socialaccount',     'allauth.socialaccount.providers.facebook',     'allauth.socialaccount.providers.google',     'allauth.socialaccount.providers.twitter',   ]  SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {'facebook': {}, 'google':{}, 'twitter':{}}  478   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  As you can see in Listing 10-20, the last three apps in the INSTALLED_APPS list correspond to three social   providers: Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Adding these providers to INSTALLED_APPS is the first step to  enable them in social authentication with Django allauth.  In addition to the google, facebook, and twitter apps, Django allauth also supports over 50 other   social authentication workflows from various providers3 under the same allauth.socialaccount. providers package.  In Listing 10-20 you can also see the SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS variable with a dictionary of keys that   correspond to each social provider. Each key has an empty dictionary value that will eventually contain  provider-specific configuration options. In the next sections, I’ll describe how to set up each social provider  and fill in these configuration values.   Don’t add social provider configurations to settings.py until you have real connection      Caution  parameters to social providers. You’ll get errors due to the missing configuration in the login page and other  workflow authentication pages.  In addition to the configuration parameters in SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS, you’ll also need to add a   social provider’s application credentials as ‘Social applications’ model records through the Django admin.  Go to the Django admin and click on the ‘Social applications’ model – shown in Figure 10-13.  Next, you’ll be presented with a screen like the one in Figure 10-14 where you can edit and add social   applications, and click on the ‘Add social application’ button in the top right button. On this page, you’ll see  a screen like the one in Figure 10-15 where you can select a social provider and introduce various values  associated with a social application  e.g., name, client id, secret key . For the moment we don’t have any of  these values, but keep this Django admin page open, because next I’ll describe where to get the values for  each of the three social providers you added to the INSTALLED_APPS variable in Listing 10-20.  Figure 10-14.  Django social application list page  3http:  django-allauth.readthedocs.io en latest providers.html  479   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  480  Figure 10-15.  Django social application create edit page  Set Up Facebook with Django allauth To set up Facebook social authentication in Django allauth you need a Facebook account to create an  application on their site. Head over to https:  developers.facebook.com apps. If you’ve previously  created a Facebook application you’ll see a screen like the one in Figure 10-16, but if you’ve never created an  application then you won’t see a list of applications, but you’ll still see the ‘Add a New App’ green button in  the top right corner like Figure 10-16.   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-16.  Facebook application list page  Click on the ‘Add a New App’ button in the top right corner of Figure 10-16 and you’ll see a pop-up like  the one in Figure 10-17. Fill out the two options for the app name  e.g., Coffeehouse  and contact email and  click on the ‘Create App ID’ button.  Figure 10-17.  Facebook create application pop-up  When you click on the ‘Create App ID’ button, the app is created and you’re taken to the app’s main page.   Next, let’s go back to the page with the list of apps – illustrated in Figure 10-16 – by clicking on the ‘See all  apps’ button on the left-column drop-down or by just visiting the https:  developers.facebook.com apps  url again – you can come back later to app’s main page by clicking on the app on the page with the list of apps.  481   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  While on the Facebook app list page – Figure 10-16 – hover your mouse pointer over the top right corner   of the application you just created until an arrow appears, click on the arrow, and from the pop-up menu  click on the ‘Create Test App’ option as illustrated in Figure 10-18.  Figure 10-18.  Facebook created test application pop-up menu  Next, a pop-up appears where you can assign a name to the test app or leave the default name; choose   accordingly. Upon termination, you’ll see a screen like the one in Figure 10-19 with all the app configuration  parameters. If you don’t see Figure 10-19, go back to the Facebook app list page in Figure 10-16, hover over  the top right corner again, and select the test application from the pop-up menu.  482   Figure 10-19.  Facebook test app main page  In Figure 10-19, you can see there’s an ‘App ID’ value, as well as a hidden ‘App Secret’ value you can   see by clicking on the ‘Show’ button. In addition, on the left-hand side you can see a series of tabs to further  customize an application’s parameters. Click on the ‘Settings’ ‘Basic’ menu in the left-hand column.  While on the ‘Settings’ ‘Basic’ menu, in the center bottom of the page you’ll see a large button ’+ Add  platform’, as shown in Figure 10-20. Click on the ‘+ Add platform’ button and in the pop-up menu select the  ‘Website’ option. This adds a ‘Website’ box above the ‘+ Add platform’ button, in this box’s input field add  the url of your Django application  e.g., http:  localhost  to tell Facebook to accept login request from this  domain – as illustrated in Figure 10-20 – and in addition, on the ‘App Domains’ input field near the top of the  page also add the url of you Django application – as it’s also illustrated in Figure 10-20.  Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  483   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-20.  Facebook test app configuration for authorized domain requests  Next, go to the Django admin and in the ‘Social applications’ model create edit page - illustrated in   Figure 10-15 - create a Facebook application by selecting ‘Facebook’ from the provider list, introduce a  friendly name in the ’Name’ box, introduce the Facebook ‘App ID’ value in the ‘Client Id’ box, and introduce  the Facebook ‘App Secret’ value in the ‘Secret key’ box.  Next, open your Django project’s settings.py file and update the SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS variable   with the Facebook configuration parameters illustrated in Listing 10-21.  Listing 10-21.  Facebook social provider configuration for Django allauth in settings.py  SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS =  { 'facebook':                                {'METHOD': 'oauth2',                                 'SCOPE': ['email'],                                 'AUTH_PARAMS': {'auth_type': 'reauthenticate'},                                 'LOCALE_FUNC': lambda request: 'en_US',                                 'VERSION': 'v2.4'                                }                            }  The settings in Listing 10-21 are the most basic set of values to run Facebook authentication, but there   are many other options you can consult in the Django allauth documentation. Next, start your Django  application and visit the  accounts login  page to attempt to log in, you will see a page like the one  illustrated in Figure 10-21.  484   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-21.  Django login with social authentication options  As you can see in Figure 10-21, unlike the login page from the Django allauth-based configuration, there   are now options to sign up with Facebook, Google, and Twitter. Click on the Facebook link and you’ll be  redirected to a Facebook page to grant authorization, as illustrated in Figure 10-22.  Figure 10-22.  Facebook social authorization pop-up  485   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  As you can see in Figure 10-22, a user is told the action will share his public profile and email upon   confirmation. If the user clicks ‘Continue as...’ Facebook contacts the Django application with a token and  the user’s information  i.e., public profile info and email . At this juncture, Django allauth creates a user and  puts him through the regular Django allauth user creation workflow.  Because of the previous base Django allauth configuration – on which this social configuration is based   – that enforced email verification, a user won’t be able to log in to application until he verifies his email  account via Django allauth, irrespective of the Facebook authentication workflow. Once a user confirms his  email through a verification link sent by Django allauth, a user is marked as verified and can proceed to log  in to the application – note this email verification process is not specific or required for social authentication  and you can disable it you want to allow automatic login immediately after Facebook returns a response. With the Facebook authentication and email verification complete, a user can sign in to the Django   application by clicking on the ‘Facebook’ sign-in link at any time thereafter.  Under the hood, Django allauth keeps track of social authentication tokens and accounts in the ‘Social   application tokens’ and ‘Social accounts’ models, which are both accessible in the Django admin.  In addition, Django allauth also creates a regular Django user  e.g., the django.contrib.auth.models.  User kind  with the Facebook workflow, so the same user is capable of leveraging Django’s standard  authentication system  e.g., to become superuser or staff . Note however that this type of user relies on a  Facebook authorization token – and has no password – so authentication must always be done through the  social Facebook authentication link in  accounts login , with the Django admin not working for this type  of user because it requires a typed-in password.  Bear in mind that in addition to the multiple Facebook-specific configuration Django allauth options   that are beyond the scope of this discussion, there are other social authentication concepts  e.g., token  revocation, callback URLs  that you’ll need to explore and configure on your own – given they are not Django  specific – to offer a streamlined social authentication process to end users.   the previous procedure is done as a Facebook ‘test application' – see Figure 10-18. For the live      Note  version of a Django application, you must perform this identical procedure on the primary  i.e., non-test   channel of the same Facebook application.  Set Up Google with Django allauth To set up Google social authentication in Django allauth, you’ll need a Google account to create an  application on their site. Head over to https:  console.developers.google.com . If you’ve previously  created Google projects you’ll land on a default project. While you can create the social authentication  workflow on any Google project, I recommend you create a new project for this purpose.  On the top menu bar – to the right-hand side of the ‘Google APIs’ logo – there’s a menu with the default   project name: click on it, and a pop-up appears with a list of projects. Inside this last pop-up and besides  the search box is a ‘+’  plus  button named ‘Create project’. Click on the ‘Create project’ button and you’ll be  taken to the page illustrated in Figure 10-23. Introduce a project name and click on the ‘Create’ button.  486   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-23.  Google create project page  After you click on the ‘Create button’, you’ll be taken to the project’s home page shown in Figure 10-24.  Ensure you’re placed in the project you just created verifying the name of the selected project in top menu  bar – to the right-hand side of the ‘Google APIs’ logo. If it’s not the correct project, click on project and from  the pop-up select the appropriate project from the list of projects.  Figure 10-24.  Google project main page  487   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  On the left-hand side menu of Figure 10-24, click on the ‘Credentials’ option. Next, on the center of the  page, click on the ‘Add credentials’ button and from the drop-down menu select the ‘OAuth client ID’ option  as illustrated in Figure 10-25.  Figure 10-25.  Google project Oauth client ID option  Once you click on the ’OAuth client ID’ option you’ll be taken to the ‘Create Client ID’ page illustrated   in Figure 10-26. You should select the ‘Web application’ option; however, notice the warning at the top of the  page indicating ‘To create an OAuth client ID, you must first set a product name on the consent screen’. So  let’s take care of this consent screen first, so click on the ‘Configure consent screen’ button from Figure 10-26  to take you to the page in Figure 10-27.  488   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-26.  Google project create client ID page  Figure 10-27.  Google project OAuth consent screen  489   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  The consent screen in Figure 10-27 is used to customize how an end user is greeted by Google when  seeking authorization from an app, in our case the Django application. Fill in the required ‘Product name  shown to users’ field and save the changes. Once the consent screen is saved, you’ll be taken back to the  screen in Figure 10-26 where you can select the ‘Web Application’ option.  In the ‘Web application’ page, the ‘Name’ field is given the default ‘Web client 1' value, which you can   adjust accordingly. Set the ‘Authorized JavaScript origins’ option to the Django application’s domain    e.g., http:  localhost  and also set the ‘Authorized redirect URIs’ option to the Django allauth url    accounts google login callback , which is here that Google will contact the application after successful  authentication – note this last value must use a full-qualified domain  e.g., http:  localhost accounts  google login callback  .  Once you input the necessary values in the ‘Web application’ page, click on the ‘Create’ button and   you’ll see a pop-up like the one in Figure 10-28 with the application Client ID and Client Secret - if you close  the pop-up you can later access the same values in the main ‘Credentials’ menu on the left-hand side.  Figure 10-28.  Google project Client ID and Client Secret  Next, go to the Django admin and in the ‘Social applications’ model create edit page – illustrated in   Figure 10-15 – create a Google application by selecting ‘Google’ from the provider list, introduce a friendly  name in the ‘Name’ box, introduce the Google ‘Client ID’ value in the ‘Client Id’ box, and introduce the  Google ‘Client Secret’ value in the ‘Secret key’ box  Next, open your Django project's settings.py file and update the SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS variable   with the Google configuration parameters illustrated in Listing 10-22.  Listing 10-22.  Google social provider configuration for django-allauth in settings.py  SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = { 'google':                              { 'SCOPE': ['email'],                                'AUTH_PARAMS': { 'access_type': 'online' }                              }                           }  490   The settings in Listing 10-22 are the most basic set of values to run Google authentication, but there are  many other options you can consult in the Django allauth documentation. Next, start the Django application  and visit the  accounts login  page – in Figure 10-21 – to attempt a Google login. Click on the ‘Google’  signup link and you'll be redirected to a Google grant authorization page, illustrated in Figure 10-29.  Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-29.  Google social authorization page  As you can see in Figure 10-29, a user is informed he will share who he is and his email upon   confirmation. If the user clicks ‘Accept’, Google contacts the Django application with a token and the user’s  information  i.e., public profile info and email . At this juncture, Django allauth creates a user so he’s able to  sign into the Django application by simply clicking on the ‘Google’ sign-in link every time.  Because Google itself requires on valid emails to work, it’s implied a user authenticating via Google uses   an active and valid email, therefore Django allauth skips the email verification process and automatically  marks a user as verified - unlike Facebook authentication, where users can keep using Facebook with a stale  and potentially invalid email.  Under the hood, Django allauth keeps track of social authentication tokens and accounts in the ‘Social   application tokens’ and ‘Social accounts’ models, which are both accessible in the Django admin.  In addition, Django allauth also creates a regular Django user  e.g., the django.contrib.auth.  models.User kind  with the Google workflow, so the same user is capable of leveraging Django's standard  authentication system  e.g., to become superuser or staff . Note, however, this type of user relies on a Google  authorization token – and has no password – so authentication must always be done through the social  Google authentication link in  accounts login , with the Django admin not working for this type of user  because it requires a typed-in password.  Set Up Twitter with Django allauth To set up Twitter social authentication in Django allauth you’ll need a Twitter account to create an  application on their site. Head over to https:  apps.twitter.com app new and you’ll see a screen like the  one in Figure 10-30 to create a Twitter app.  491   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-30.  Twitter create app page  Fill out the required details for the new Twitter app, ensuring the ‘Callback URL’ field is set to    http:  localhost:8000 accounts twitter login callback , which is where Twitter will contact the  Django application upon successful authentication. Create the application and you’ll be redirected to the  Twitter application’s main page. Next, click on the ‘Keys and Access Tokens’ tab, where you’ll see a screen  like the one in Figure 10-31.  Figure 10-31.  Twitter app Key and Access Tokens page  492   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Next, go to the Django admin and in the ‘Social applications’ model create edit page - illustrated in   Figure 10-15 - create a Twitter application by selecting ‘Twitter’ from the provider list, introduce a friendly  name in the ‘Name’ box, introduce the Twitter ‘Consumer Key  API Key ’ value in the ‘Client Id’ box, and  introduce the Twitter ‘Consumer Secret’ value in the ‘Secret key’ box.  Django allauth doesn’t support any Twitter configuration options as part of the SOCIALACCOUNT_  PROVIDERS variable in settings.py, so you can skip this configuration step.  Next, start your Django application and visit the  accounts login  page – in Figure 10-21 – to attempt   to Twitter login. Click on the ‘Twitter’ sign in link and you’ll be redirected to a Twitter grant authorization  page, illustrated in Figure 10-32.  Figure 10-32.  Twitter social authorization page  As you can see in Figure 10-32, a user is told he will share tweets and other information upon   confirmation. If the user clicks ‘Authorize app’, Twitter contacts the Django application with a token and  the user’s information  i.e., public profile info . At this juncture, the user is redirected back to the site and  Django allauth asks a user for his email to finish the account creation process, as illustrated in Figure 10-33.  493   Chapter 10   Django User ManageMent  Figure 10-33.  Django allauth email request after Twitter social authorization  Note this last email request in Figure 10-33 is necessary because Twitter does not provide an email   with their social authentication – difficult as it may be to believe, it’s a known Twitter social authentication  limitation.  Because the base Django allauth configuration enforces email verification – to avoid garbage emails – a   user is sent a verification email in which he has to click on a link to finish activation.  Once a user confirms his email by clicking on the verification email link, he can sign in to the Django   application by clicking on the ‘Twitter’ sign-in link at any time. Under the hood, Django allauth keeps track  of social authentication tokens and accounts in the ‘Social application tokens’ and ‘Social accounts’ models,  which are both accessible in the Django admin.  In addition, Django allauth also creates a regular user  e.g., the django.contrib.auth.models.User   kind  with the Twitter workflow, so the same user is capable of leveraging Django’s standard authentication  system  e.g., to become superuser or staff . Note however that this type of user relies on a Twitter  authorization token – and has no password – so authentication must always be done through the social  Twitter authentication link in  accounts login , with the Django admin not working for this type of user  because it requires a typed-in password.  494   CHAPTER 11  Django admin Management  The Django admin is a user-friendly application to administer the contents of a relational database linked  to a Django project. Although the Django admin is almost effortless in terms of setting it up – as described  in Chapter 1 – there are multiple configuration options you’ll learn in this chapter to create more powerful  Django admin displays and functionalities.  In this chapter you’ll first learn how to register Django models in the Django admin. Next, you’ll learn   how to display records in the Django admin and use techniques like ordering, inline editing, pagination,  search and actions buttons, among other things. In addition, you’ll learn how to customize Django admin  forms and relationships to easily create, update, and delete model records with the Django admin.  Next, you’ll learn how to customize Django admin pages through configuration fields and custom   templates, as well as how to add custom data and override Django admin class methods and fields to create  the most flexible Django admin pages possible. Finally, you’ll learn how to configure and enforce Django  admin permissions, as well as how to create multiple Django admin site instances.  Set Up Django Models in the Django admin  Although the Django admin provides an excellent management tool for a Django project's database, simply  creating and installing Django models isn't enough to access their data in the Django admin.  In order to access Django model records in the Django admin you must register and configure Django   models in admin.py files. An admin.py file is automatically placed inside a Django app – alongside the  models.py and views.py files – when you create an app.  Although you can technically use a single admin.py to register and configure all Django models - just  like you can have a single models.py to define all Django models - it's a recommended practice that each  Django app uses its own admin.py file to manage its corresponding model defined in models.py.  There are three ways to register a Django model for the Django admin in admin.py files, all of which are   illustrated in Listing 11-1.  Listing 11-1.  Register Django models in admin.py file  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Option 1 - Basic admin.site.register Store    Option 2 - Allows customizing Django admin behavior class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       pass    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_11  495   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin    Option 3 – Decorator @admin.register Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       pass  The first option in Listing 11-1 provides basic Django model registration and consists of declaring a   Django model class as the input of the admin.site.register method. If you don't require customizing the  default Django admin behavior for a model, this option is sufficient.  The second option in Listing 11-1 makes use of a Django admin class that inherits its behavior from  the admin.ModelAdmin class. In this case, you can see the class is empty, but it's possible to customize the  Django admin behavior, as I'll describe throughout this chapter. Once the Django admin class is declared,  it must be registered and associated with a Django model using the same admin.site.register method  in option one, where the first argument is the Django model and the second argument is the Django  admin class.  The third option in Listing 11-1 makes use of a Django admin @admin.register decorator. The   syntax difference between option three and option two is that the registration and association takes place  decorating the Django admin class with @admin.register where the decorator takes the Django model as its  argument.  It’s worth mentioning that although options two and three are functionally equal, using the @admin.  register decorator - option three - has the limitation that you can't reference the Django admin class in its  __init__   method  e.g., super StoreAdmin, self .__init__ *args, **kwargs  , which is an issue in  Python 2 and for certain designs; if you're in this situation then you must use option two to register a model  with the admin.site.register method.  Now that you know how to register Django models in the Django admin, I'll describe the various  options available to customize the Django admin behavior through a Django admin class. To make it  easier to look for custom options, I'll classify the options into two main sections: 'Read record options' and  'Create,update,delete record options' to cover the entire scope of CRUD operation options available in the  Django admin, in addition to including subsections to group functionality under each main section.  Django admin Read Record Options  When you're on the main page of the Django admin and click on a Django model, you're taken to a page that  shows the record list of that specific model. Figures 11-1 and 11-2 illustrate this record list page for a Store  model.  496   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-1.  Django admin record list page with no model __str__ definition  Figure 11-2.  Django admin record list page with model __str__ definition  As you can see in Figures 11-1 and 11-2, each Django model record is displayed with a string. By default,  this string is generated from the __str__   method definition of the Django model, as described in Chapter 7.   If the __str__ method is missing from a Django model, then the Django admin displays the records like  Figure 11-1 as 'Store object'; otherwise it returns the result generated by the __str__ method for each   record - which in this case of Figure 11-2 is the name, city, and state attributes of each Store record.  497   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Record Display: list_display, format_html, empty_value_display While the basic display behavior presented in Figures 11-1 and 11-2 is helpful, it can be very limited for  models with an inexpressive or complex __str__   method. A Django admin class can be configured with  the list_display option to split up the record list with a model's various fields, thereby making it easier to  view and sort records. Listing 11-2 illustrates a Django admin class with the list_display option.  Listing 11-2.  Django admin list_display option  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_display = ['name','address','city','state']  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   As you can see in Listing 11-2, the Django admin StoreAdmin class defines the list_display option   with a list of values. This list corresponds to Django model fields, which in this case are from the Store  model. Figures 11-3 and 11-4 illustrate the modified record list layout by adding the list_display option.  Figure 11-3.  Django admin record list page with list_display  498   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-4.  Django admin record list page with model list_display sorted     Tip   if you want to keep displaying the value generated by a Django model through its __str__ method in  the Django admin, it’s valid to add it to the list_display option  e.g., list_display = ['name','__str__'] .  In Figure 11-3 you can see a much cleaner record list layout where each of the fields declared in list_  display has its own column. In addition, if you click on any of the column headers - which represent model  fields - the records are automatically sorted by that attribute, a process that's illustrated in Figure 11-4 and  which greatly enhances the discoverability of records.  Besides supporting the inclusion of Django model fields, the list_display option also supports   other variations to generate more sophisticated list layouts. For example, if the database records are not  homogeneous  e.g., mixed upper and lowercase text  you can generate a callable method to manipulate  the records and display them in the Django admin in a uniform manner  e.g., all uppercase . Additionally,  you can also create a callable that generates a composite value from record fields that aren't explicitly in  the database  e.g., domain names belonging to email records  that makes the visualization of the record list  more powerful in the Django admin. Listing 11-3 illustrates several of these callable examples using several  method variations.  Listing 11-3.  Django admin list_display option with callables  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store   Option 1  admin.py def upper_case_city_state obj :     return  "%s %s" %  obj.city, obj.state  .upper   upper_case_city_state.short_description = 'City State'  499   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_display = ['name','address',upper_case_city_state]   Option 2  admin.py class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['name','address','upper_case_city_state']     def upper_case_city_state self, obj :         return  "%s %s" %  obj.city, obj.state  .upper       upper_case_city_state.short_description = 'City State'   Option 3  models.py from django.db import models  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      email = models.EmailField       def email_domain self :         return self.email.split "@" [-1]     email_domain.short_description = 'Email domain'   admin.py class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_display = ['name','email_domain']  In Listing 11-3 you can see three callable variations that are all acceptable as list_display options.  Option one in Listing 11-3 is a callable that's declared outside a class and is then used as part of the list_ display option. Option two declares the callable as part of the Django admin class and then uses it as part  of the list_display option. Finally, option three declares a callable as part of the Django model class that is  then used as part of the list_display option in the Django admin class. Neither approach in Listing 11-3 is  'better' or 'inferior' than the other; the options simply vary in the syntax and arguments used to achieve the  same result, you can use whatever approach you like.  On certain occasions you may want to render HTML as part of a record list in the Django admin  e.g.,   add bold   tags or colored   tags . To include HTML in these circumstances, you must use the  format_html method because the Django admin escapes all HTML output by default – since it works with  Django templates. Listing 11-4 illustrates the use of the format_html method.  Listing 11-4.  Django admin list_display option with callable and format_html   models.py from django.db import models from django.utils.html import format_html  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      def full_address self :         return format_html '%s -  %s,%s ' %  self.address,self.city,self.state    500   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management   admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_display = ['name','full_address']  When a model field uses a BooleanField or NullBooleanField data type, the Django admin displays  an “on” or “off” icon instead of True or False values. In addition, when a value for a field in list_display  is None, an empty string, and for cases when a field in list_display is any empty iterable  e.g., list , Django  displays a dash -, as illustrated in Figure 11-5.  Figure 11-5.  Django admin default display for empty values  It's possible to override this last behavior with the empty_value_display option as illustrated in   Figure 11-6. You can configure the empty_value_display option to take effect on all Django admin models,  on a specific Django admin class, or individual Django admin fields as illustrated in Listing 11-5.  501   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-6.  Django admin override display for empty values with empty_value_display  Listing 11-5.  Django admin empty_value_display option global, class, or field-level configuration   Option 1 - Globally set empty values to ???  settings.py from django.contrib import admin admin.site.empty_value_display = '???'   Option 2 - Set all fields in a class to 'Unknown Item field'  admin.py to show "Unknown Item field" instead of '-' for NULL values in all Item fields  NOTE: Item model in items app  class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['menu','name','price']     empty_value_display = 'Unknown Item field'  admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin    Option 3 - Set individual field in a class to 'No known price' class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['menu','name','price_view']     def price_view self, obj :          return obj.price     price_view.empty_value_display = 'No known price'  Record Order: admin_order_field and ordering When you use custom fields in list_display  i.e., fields that aren't actually in the database, but are rather  composite or helper fields calculated in Django , such fields can't be used for sorting operations because  sorting takes places at the database level. However, if an element in list_display is associated with a   502   database field, it's possible to create an association for sorting purposes with the admin_order_field option.  This process is illustrated in Listing 11-6.  Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Listing 11-6.  Django admin with admin_order_field option   models.py from django.db import models from django.utils.html import format_html  class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30,unique=True      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      def full_address self :         return format_html '%s -  %s,%s ' %  self.address,self.city,self.state       full_address.admin_order_field = 'city'   admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_display = ['name','full_address']  As you can see in Listing 11-6, the admin_order_field declaration tells Django to order the model   records by city when attempting to perform a sort operation in the Django admin through the composite  full_address field. Note that it's also possible to add a preceding - to the admin_order_field value to  specify descending order  e.g., full_address.admin_order_field = '-city' , just like it’s done in standard  model sort operations.  By default, record list values are sorted by their database pk  primary key  field – which is generally the   id field – as you can appreciate in Figure 11-3  i.e., record pk 1 at the bottom and record pk 4 at the top .  And if you click on any of the header columns the sort order changes as you can see in Figure 11-4.  To set a default sorting behavior - without the need to click on the header column - you can use the  Django admin class ordering option or the Django model meta ordering option that you learned about  in Chapter 7. If no ordering option is specified in either class then pk ordering takes place. If the ordering  option is specified in the Django model meta option, this sorting behavior is used universally and if both a  Django model and Django admin class have ordering options, then the Django admin class definition takes  precedence.  The ordering option accepts a list of field values to specify the default ordering of a record list. By   default, the ordering behavior is ascending  e.g., Z values first@bottom, A values top@last , but it's possible  to alter this behavior to descending  e.g., A values first@bottom, Z values top@last  by prefixing a -  minus  sign  to the field value. For example, to produce a record list like the one if Figure 11-4 by default you would  use ordering = ['name'] and to produce an inverted record list of Figure 11-4  i.e., Uptown at the top and  Corporate at the bottom  you would use ordering = ['-name'].  Record Links and Inline Edit: list_display_links and list_editable If you look at some of the past figures you'll notice there's always a generated link for each item in the record  list. For example, in Figure 11-2 you can see each 'Store' record is a link that takes you to a page where you  can edit the 'Store' values, similarly in Figure 11-4 you can see the 'Store' name field is a link that takes you   503   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  to a page where you can edit the 'Store' values, and in Figure 11-6 you can see each 'Menu' name field is a  link that takes you to a page where you can edit the 'Menu' values.  This is a default behavior that lets you drill-down on each record, but you customize this behavior   through the list_display_links option to generate no links or inclusively more links. Listing 11-7  illustrates two variations of the list_display_links option and Figures 11-7 and 11-8 the respective  interfaces.  Listing 11-7.  Django admin with list_display_links option   Sample 1   admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_display = ['name','address','city','state']       list_display_links = None  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin    Sample 2   admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['menu','name','price_view']     list_display_links = ['menu','name']  admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin   Figure 11-7.  Django admin no links in records list due to list_display_links  504   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-8.  Django admin multiple links in records list due to list_display_links  The first sample in Listing 11-7 illustrates how the StoreAdmin class is set with list_display_links  = None that results in the page presented in Figure 11-7 that lacks links. The second sample in Listing 11-7  shows the ItemAdmin class with the list_display_links = ['menu','name'] that tells Django to generate  links on both menu and name fields values and which results in the page presented in Figure 11-8 that  contains multiple links.  The need to click on individual links on a record list to edit records can become tiresome if you need to  edit multiple records. To simplify the editing of records, the list_editable option allows Django to generate  inline forms on each record value, effectively allowing the editing of records in bulk without the need to  leave the record list screen. Listing 11-8 illustrates the use of the list_editable option and Figure 11-9 the  respective interface.   technically list_editable is a Django admin update option, but since the update is done inline and on      Note  a page designed to read records, it’s included here.  Listing 11-8.  Django admin with list_editable option   admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_display = ['name','address','city','state']       list_editable = ['address','city','state']  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   505   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-9.  Django admin editable fields due to list_editable  In Listing 11-8 you can see the list_editable = ['address','city','state'] option, which tells   the Django admin to allow the editing of address, city. and state values in the record list. In Figure 11-9  you can see how each of these field values in the record list is turned into an editable form and toward the  bottom of the page the Django admin generates a 'Save' button to save changes when an edit is made.  It's worth mentioning that any field value declared in the list_editable option must also be declared  as part of the list_display option, since it's not possible to edit fields that aren’t displayed. In addition, any  field values declared in the list_editable option must not be part of the list_display_option, since it’s  not possible for a field to be both a form and a link.  Record Pagination: list_per_page, list_max_show_all, paginator When record lists grow too large in the Django admin, they are automatically split into different pages. By  default, the Django admin generates additional pages for every 100 records. You can control this setting with  the Django admin class list_per_page option. Listing 11-9 illustrates the use of the list_per_page option  and Figure 11-10 shows the corresponding record list generated by the configuration in Listing 11-9.  Listing 11-9.  Django admin with list_per_page option   admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['menu','name','price']     list_per_page = 5  admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin   506   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-10.  Django admin list_per_page option limit to 5  As you can see in Figure 11-10, the display of nine records is split into two pages due to the list_per_ page = 5 option illustrated in Listing 11-9. In addition to the page icons at the bottom left of Figure 11-10,  notice the right-hand side of these icons is a ‘Show all’ link. The ‘Show all’ link is used to generate a record  list with all the records in a single page. But note that because this additional database operation can be  costly, by default, the ‘Show all’ link is only shown when a record list is 200 items or less.  You can control the display of the ‘Show all’ link with the list_max_show_all option. If the total record  list count is less than or equal the list_max_show_all value the ‘Show all’ link is displayed, if the total record  list count is above this number then no ‘Show all’ link is generated. For example, if you declare list_max_ show_all = 8 option to Listing 11-9 then no ‘Show all’ link would appear in Figure 11-10 because the total  record list count is 9.  The Django admin uses the django.core.paginator.Paginator class to generate the pagination   sequence, but it’s also possible to provide a custom paginator class through the paginator option. Note that if  the custom paginator class does not inherit its behavior from django.core.paginator.Paginator then you  must also provide an implementation for ModelAdmin.get_paginator   method.  Record Search: search_fields, list_filter, show_full_result_count,   preserve_filters The Django admin also supports search functionality. The Django admin class search_fields option adds  search functionality for text model fields through a search box – see Table 7-1 for a list of Django model text  data types. Listing 11-10 illustrates a Django admin class with the search_fields option and Figure 11-11  illustrates how a search box is added to the top of the record list.  507   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Listing 11-10.  Django admin search_fields option  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       search_fields = ['city','state']  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   Figure 11-11.  Django admin search box due to search_fields option  In Listing 11-10 the city and state fields are added to the search_fields option, which tell the Django   admin to perform searches across these two fields. Be aware that adding too many fields to the search_ fields option can result in slow search results, due to the way Django executes this type of search query.  Table 11-1 presents different search_fields options and the generated SQL for a given search term.  Table 11-1.  Django search_fields options and generated SQL for search term  search_fields option  Search term  Generated SQL condition  search_fields = [‘city’,‘state’]  San Diego  search_fields = [‘^city’,‘^state’]  San Diego  search_fields = [‘=city’,‘=state’]  San Diego  *search_fields = [‘@city’,‘@state’] San Diego  WHERE  city ILIKE ‘%San%’ OR state ILIKE ‘%San%’   AND  city ILIKE ‘%Diego%’ OR state ILIKE ‘%Diego%’  WHERE  city ILIKE ‘San%’ OR state ILIKE ‘San%’  AND   city ILIKE ‘Diego%’ OR state ILIKE ‘Diego%’  WHERE  city ILIKE ‘San’ OR state ILIKE ‘San’  AND   city ILIKE ‘Diego’ OR state ILIKE ‘Diego’    Full-text search  WHERE  city ILIKE ‘%San%’ OR state  ILIKE ‘%San%’  AND  city ILIKE ‘%Diego%’ OR state  ILIKE ‘%Diego%’   * Full-text search option only supported for MySQL database  508   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  As you can see in Table 11-1, the search_fields option constructs a query by splitting the provided   search string into words and performs a case insensitive search  i.e., SQL ILIKE  where each word must be in  at least one of the search_fields. In addition, notice in Table 11-1 it’s possible to declare the search_fields  values with different prefixes to alter the search query.  By default, if you just provide model field names to search_fields, Django generates a query with  SQL wildcards % at the start and end of each word, which can be a very costly operation, since it searches  across all text in a field record. If you prefix the search_field with a ^ - as illustrated in Table 11-1 - Django  generates a query with an SQL wildcard % at the end of each word, making the search operation more  efficient because it’s restricted to text that starts with the word patterns. If you prefix the search_field with a  = - as illustrated in Table 11-1 - Django generates a query for an exact match with no SQL wildcard %, making  the search operation the most efficient, because it’s restricted to exact matches of the word patterns. Finally,  if you’re using a MySQL database, it’s also possible to add the @ prefix to search_fields to enable full-text  search.  POWER SEARCHES, NON-TEXT SEARCHES, AND OTHER BACK ENDS   FOR DJANGO ADMIN SEARCHES  Search engines offer various kinds of power search syntax to customize search queries, but the Django  admin search_fields option doesn’t support this type of syntax. For example, in a search engine it’s  possible to quote the search term "San Diego" to make an exact search for both words, but if you  attempt this with the Django admin search, Django attempts to search for literal quotes: "San" and  "Diego" separately. to tweak the default search_fields behavior you must use the options presented in  table 11-1 or ModelAdmin.get_search_results  .  the default search behavior for a Django admin class can be customized to any requirements with the  ModelAdmin.get_search_results   method that accepts the request, a queryset that applies the  current filters, and the user-provided search term. in this manner, you can generate non-text searches   e.g., on integers  or rely on other third-party tools  e.g., Solr, haystack  to generate search results.  The list_filter option offers quicker access to model field values and works like pre-built search   links. Unlike the search_fields option, the list_filter option is more flexible in terms of the data types it  can work with and accepts more than just text model fields  i.e., it also supports Boolean fields, date fields,  etc. . Listing 11-11 illustrates a Django admin class with the list_filter option and Figure 11-12 illustrates  the list of filters generated on the right-hand side of the record list.  Listing 11-11.  Django admin list_filter option  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['menu','name','price']     list_filter = ['menu','price']  admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin   509   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-12.  Django admin list filters due to search_fields option  In Listing 11-11 the list_filter option is declared with the menu and price fields, which tell Django to   create filters with these two fields. As you can appreciate in Figure 11-12, on the right-hand side of the record  list is a column with various filters that includes all the values for the menu and price field values. If you  click on any of the filter links, the Django admin displays the records that match the filter in the record list, a  process that’s illustrated in Figures 11-13, 11-14, and 11-15.  Figure 11-13.  Django admin list with single filter  510   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-14.  Django admin list with single filter  Figure 11-15.  Django admin list with dual filter  An interesting aspect of Django admin filters that can be seen in Figure 11-15 is that you can apply   multiple filters, making it easier to drill-down into records that match very specific criteria.  In addition, if you look at fFgures 11-13, 11-14, and 11-15 you can see how filters are reflected as   URL query strings. For example, in Figure 11-13 the ?menu__id__exact=2 string is appended to the URL,  which tells Django admin to display a list of records with a menu id of 2; in Figure 11-15 the ?menu__id__  511   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  exact=3&price=3.99 string tells Django admin to display a list of records with a menu id of 3 and a price  value of 3.99. This URL argument syntax is based on the same syntax used to make standard Django model  queries -- described in Chapter 8 - and which is helpful to generate more sophisticated filters ‘on the fly’  without the need to modify or add options to the underlying Django admin class.  When you apply a filter or filters to a record list and the filtered results are greater than 99 records,  Django limits the initial display to 99 records and also adds pagination, but in addition also displays the  full count of objects that match the filter s   e.g., 99 results  153 total  . This additional count requires an  additional query that can slow things down with a large number of records. To disable the generation of this  additional count applicable to filter use you can set the show_full_result_count option to False.  Another characteristic of applying a filter or filters is that when you create, edit, or delete a record and   finish the operation, Django takes you back to the filtered list. While this can be a desired behavior, it’s  possible to override this behavior through the preserve_filters option so the Django admin sends you  back to the original record list. If you set the preserve_filters = False option in a Django admin class  while on a filtered record list and create, edit, or delete a record, the Django admin takes you back to the  original record list with no filters.  Record Dates: date_hierarchy Dates and times are displayed as you would expect in the Django admin UI, as string representations of the  underlying Python datetime value. But there’s a special option for DateField and DateTimeField model  data types that works like a specialized filter. If you use the date_hierarchy option on a Django admin  class and assign it a field that’s a DateField or DateTimeField  e.g., date_hierarchy = 'created', where  timestamp is the name of the field , Django generates an intelligent date filter at the top of the record list like  the one illustrated in Figures 11-16, 11-17, and 11-18.  Figure 11-16.  Django date filter by month with date_hierarchy  512   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-17.  Django date filter by day with date_hierarchy  Figure 11-18.  Django date filter single day with date_hierarchy  As you can see in Figures 11-16, 11-17, and 11-18, the intelligent behavior comes from the fact that upon   loading the record list, Django generates a unique list of the available months or days corresponding to the  values of the date_hierarchy field. If you click on any of the options of this filter list, Django then generates  a unique list of records that matches the values of the month or day in the filter list.  513   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Record Actions: actions_on_top, actions_on_bottom, actions Besides the ability to click on an item in a Django admin record list to edit or delete it, at the top of the record  list there’s a drop-down menu preceded with the word ‘Action’, which you can see in many of the previous  figures. By default, the ‘Action’ drop-down menu provides the ‘Delete selected options’ item to delete  multiple records simultaneously by selecting the check box on the left-hand side of each record.  If you wish to remove the ‘Action’ menu from the top of the record list you can use the actions_on_top  options and set it to False. In addition, if you wish to add the ‘Action’ menu to the bottom of the record list  you can use the actions_on_bottom = True option that is illustrated in Figure 11-19 - note that it’s possible  to have an ‘Action’ menu on both the bottom and top of the record list page.  Figure 11-19.  Django admin list with Action menu on bottom due to actions_on_bottom  Another option related to the ‘Action’ menu is the actions_selection_counter that displays the  amount of selected records on the right-hand side of the ‘Action’ menu and which can also be seen in   Figure 11-19. If you set actions_selection_counter = False then the Django admin omits the amount of  selected records related to the ‘Action’ menu.  Although the ‘Action’ menu is limited to a single action - that of deleting records - it’s possible to define   a list of actions through the actions option in Django admin classes.1  Record Relationships Django model relationships – one to one, one to many, and many to many – described in the previous model  chapters, have certain behaviors in the context of Django admin classes and the Django admin that are  worth describing separately in the following subsections.  1https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref contrib admin actions   514   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Display: list_display  continued  When you have a one to many relationship and declare the related ForeignKey field as part of the list_ display option, the Django admin uses the __str__ representation of the related model. This last behavior  is presented in Figure 11-5 with a list of Item records, where the Item model defines the menu field with  models.ForeignKey Menu  and thus the output of the field is the Menu model __str__ method.  The list_display option can’t accept a ManyToManyField field directly because it would require  executing a separate SQL statement for each row in the table; nevertheless it’s possible to integrate a  ManyToManyField into list_display through a custom method in a Django admin class, a process that’s  illustrated in Listing 11-12 and Figure 11-20.  Listing 11-12.  Django admin list_display option with ManyToManyField field   models.py from django.db import models  class Amenity models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100   class Store models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      address = models.CharField max_length=30      city = models.CharField max_length=30      state = models.CharField max_length=2      email = models.EmailField       amenities = models.ManyToManyField Amenity,blank=True    admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['name','address','city','state','list_of_amenities']     def list_of_amenities self, obj :         return  "%s" % ','.join [amenity.name for amenity in obj.amenities.all  ]       list_of_amenities.short_description = 'Store amenities'  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   515   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-20.  Django admin list_display option with ManyToManyField field  In Listing 11-12 you can see the Store model has a ManyToManyField field with the Amenity model. In  order to present the values of the ManyToManyField field in the Django admin through list_display you  can see it’s necessary to create a custom method that makes an additional query for these records.   Figure 11-20 presents the rendered Django admin record list for this ManyToManyField field. Be aware   this design can place a heavy burden on the database because it requires an additional query for each  individual record.  Order: admin_order_field  continued  The admin_order_field option also supports sorting on fields that are part of related models. For example,  in Listing 11-13, you can see the admin_order_field option is applied to a field that’s part of the model with  a ForeignKey field relationship.  Listing 11-13.  Django admin admin_order_field option with ForeignKey field   models.py class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      creator = models.CharField max_length=100,default='Coffeehouse Chef'      def __str__ self :         return u"%s" %  self.name   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu      name = models.CharField max_length=30    admin.py from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  516   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['menu','name','menu_creator']     def menu_creator self, obj :         return obj.menu.creator     menu_creator.admin_order_field = 'menu__creator'  admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin   The most important thing worth noting about Listing 11-13 is the double underscore to specify the   field menu__creator, which tells the Django admin to access a field in the related model – note this double  underscore is the same syntax used to perform queries in Django model relationships queries described in  Chapter 8.  Search: search_fields and list_filter  continued , admin.RelatedOnly  FieldListFilter, list_select_related Two other Django admin class options that support the same double underscore syntax  a.k.a. "follow  notation"  to work across relationships are search_fields and list_filter. This means you can enable  search and generate filters for related models  e.g., search_fields = ['menu__creator'] . A variation of the list_filter option that only applies to model relationships is admin.  RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter. When model records that belong to a relationship can span beyond a single  relationship, it can lead to the creation of unneeded filters.  For example, let’s take a relationship between Store and Amenity models; you can generate Django   admin filters for Amenity values on the Store record list, but if the Amenity model records are generic and  used beyond the Store model  e.g., Amenity values for Employees  you’ll see inapplicable filter values in  the Store record list. The use of the admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter prevents this, a process that’s  illustrated in Listing 11-14 and Figures 11-21 and 11-22.  Listing 11-14.  Django admin list_filter option with admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter   admin.py class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['name','address','city','state','list_of_amenities']     list_filter = [['amenities',admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter]]     def list_of_amenities self, obj :         return  "%s" % ','.join [amenity.name for amenity in obj.amenities.all  ]       list_of_amenities.short_description = 'Store amenities'  517   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-21.  Django admin list_filter option with no RelatedOnlyFieldListFilterDjango  Figure 11-22.  Django admin list_filter option with RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter  In Listing 11-14 notice how the field to generate filters on - in this case amenities - is wrapped in its  own list along with admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter. To understand the difference between the use  and absence of admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter look at Figures 11-21 and 11-22. In Figure 11-21  notice the last filter on the list is ‘Massage Chairs’ - an Amenity record - and yet no Store record on the main  list has this Amenity. To eliminate this inapplicable filter from the Store record list you can use admin. RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter and get the results from Figure 11-22, which only show Amenity filters related  to Store records.  518   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Finally, another option that’s applicable to Django admin classes with model relationships is the   list_select_related. The list_select_related option functions just like the list_select_related  option used in queries involving relationships, to reduce the amount of database queries that involve  relationships  e.g., it creates a single complex query, instead of later needing to issue multiple queries for  each relationships .The list_select_related option can accept a Boolean or list value. By default, the  list_select_related option receives a False value  i.e., it’s not used . Under the hood, the list_select_ related option uses the same select_related   model method to retrieve related records, described in  Chapter 8.  If list_select_related = True then select_related   is always used. For finer-grained control of   list_select_related you can specify a list, noting that an empty list prevents Django from calling select_ related   at all and any other list values are passed directly to select_related   as parameters.  Django admin Create, Update, Delete Record Options  Besides Django admin read record options, primarily used to modify the main page of every model in the  Django admin  i.e., where the list of records for each model is presented , there are other Django admin  pages used to create, update and delete Django model records that also support a series of options.  When you click on the ‘Add  ’ button on the top right of every Django admin page that  presents model records, you’re taken to a form-like page where you can provide values for a new record –  illustrated in Figure 11-23 – and when you click on a record in a Django admin record list, you’re also taken  to a form-like page where you can edit or delete field values for the record – illustrated in Figure 11-24.  Figure 11-23.  Django admin page to create model record  519   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-24.  Django admin page to edit or delete model record   See the filter_horizontal and filter_vertical options in Figures 11-37 and 11-38 for friendlier      Tip  Uis for the amenities field shown in Figures 11-23 and 11-24.  In the next subsections I’ll describe the various options available in the Django admin to create, update,   and delete records, which is worth noting, is the same page for all three operations.  Record Forms: fields, readonly_fields, exclude, fieldsets,   formfield_overrides, form, prepopulated_fields By default, the Django admin generates a form for all the fields in a Django model you’re working on. For  example, in Figures 11-23 and 11-24 you can see six fields in the Django admin form that correspond to six  field definitions for the Store Django model. Behind the scenes, since the Django admin uses forms filled  with model records, Django admin forms operate and have options that are almost identical to the model  forms described in Chapter 9.  The first option available to alter the amount of Django admin form fields vs. its backing model is the  fields option. The fields option lets you alter the order in which the form fields appear or create a form  with a subset of model fields. Listing 11-15 illustrates the use fields in a Django admin class and Figure 11-25  illustrates the UI generated by Listing 11-15.  Listing 11-15.  Django admin fields option for Django admin forms  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       fields = ['address','city','state','email']  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   520   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-25.  Django admin fields option for Django admin forms  In Listing 11-15 you can see the fields option contains four fields vs. six fields in the original backing   Store Django model; and in Figure 11-25 you can confirm that the Django admin form is generated with just  four fields.  Another variation of the same fields option for Django admin forms is combining multiple form fields   into the same UI line. This is easily achieved by nesting fields in their own tuple. For example, if you define  fields = ['address', 'city','state' ,'email'], the city and state forms fields are generated on the  same line in the form, as illustrated in Figure 11-26.  Figure 11-26.  Django admin fields option with wrapped fields for Django admin forms  521   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management     Tip   the list_editable option creates an inline form to edit records without the need to enter a dedicated  form page like the one in Figures 11-25 and 11-26. See the previous section on ‘record links and inline edit’.  As helpful as the fields options is, on other occasions it can be necessary to display a form field but not  allow it to be changed, because omitting a field altogether may lead to confusion. To disallow the editing of a  form field you can use the readonly_fields option. Listing 11-16 illustrates the use of the readonly_fields  option and Figure 11-27 its UI layout.  Listing 11-16.  Django admin readonly_fields option for Django admin forms  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       readonly_fields = ['name','amenities']  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   Figure 11-27.  Django admin readonly_fields option for Django admin forms  In Listing 11-16 you can see the readonly_fields option make the name and amenities fields read only.   Because the fields option is not used, all the model fields are used to generate a form. In Figure 11-27 you  can see how the name and amenities fields are shown as text rather than input form fields, making them  uneditable.  A side effect of only using the readonly_fields option is that these field definitions are placed at   the bottom of the form, as seen in Figure 11-27. If you want to maintain the same form field order as the  original Django model, then you need to explicitly define the form fields using the fields option, in this way  the form field order follows the fields option and any field in readonly_field is displayed as read only,  respecting the field position set in the fields option.  Besides supporting model field names, the readonly_fields option also supports callable methods to  further add custom behavior. Listing 11-17 illustrates the use of the readonly_fields option with a callable  and Figure 11-28 the UI layout.  522   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Listing 11-17.  Django admin readonly_fields option with callable for Django admin forms  from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     fields = ['name','address', 'city','state' ,'email','custom_amenities_display']     readonly_fields = ['name','custom_amenities_display']     def custom_amenities_display self, obj :          return mark_safe "Amenities can only be modified by special request, please contact   the store manager at %s to create a request" %  obj.email,obj.email        custom_amenities_display.short_description = "Amenities"  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   Figure 11-28.  Django admin readonly_fields option for Django admin forms  In Listing 11-17 you can see the readonly_fields option uses the custom_amenities_display callable   to create a custom field. In Figure 11-28 toward the bottom, you can see this new custom field - in place of  the original amenities field - which shows a friendlier message than Figure 11-27 and is also uneditable.  The exclude option for forms in Django admin classes is complementary to the fields option. Whereas   the fields option requires it to explicitly create of list of fields to include in a Django admin form, and the  exclude offers the inverse behavior, requiring it to explicitly list fields that shouldn't be part of a Django  admin form. For example, for a Django model with the fields a,b,c the Django admin class fields =  ‘a’,‘b’   option is equivalent to the exclude =  ‘c’  option  i.e., both options generate the same Django admin form . The fieldsets option for Django admin classes provides greater control over the layout of pages used   to create and edit records in the Django admin. Unlike the fields option that can alter the order of form  fields or even nest form fields on the same line - as illustrated in Figure 11-26 - the fieldsets option works  with the fields option to divide a page into sets. Listing 11-18 illustrates the use of the fieldsets option and  Figures 11-29 and 11-30 the corresponding layout.  523   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Listing 11-18.  Django admin fieldsets option for Django admin forms  from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     fieldsets = [         ['Store general information', {             'fields': ['name', 'email']         }],         ['Store location options', {             'classes': ['collapse'],             'fields': ['address', 'city', 'state' ],         }],     ]  admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   Figure 11-29.  Django admin fieldsets option for Django admin forms  524   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-30.  Django admin fieldsets option for Django admin forms  collapsed   In Listing 11-18 you can see the fieldsets options accepts a list value composed of two lists, where   each list represents a section of the Django admin page as illustrated in Figures 11-29 and 11-30. Each  of the internal lists is made up by a first argument that represents the title or header of the section and a  second argument that’s a dictionary. This last dictionary itself contains values assigned to a field’s key -  which functions just like the fields option described previously - and a classes key that gives the section  certain behaviors through CSS classes. In this case, you can see the second section in Listing 11-18 indicates  'classes': ['collapse'], which tells Django to make the section collapsible, in Figures 11-29 and 11-30  you can appreciate this collapsed and un-collapsed behavior.  In addition to the collapse option used in the classes key in fieldsets, another helpful CSS class   option is wide, which adds more horizontal space between fields. Note that it's valid to add any number of  CSS classes to the classes key, either CSS classes included with the Django admin  i.e., collapse and wide   or even custom CSS classes.  The formfield_overrides option provides a way to override the default form widgets associated   with a Django model field in a Django admin form. By default, all Django model fields have a given widget  assigned to them for the purpose of generating a form – a topic discussed in Chapter 9, specifically Table 9-1.  However, if you feel the default widget for a given model field is inadequate for the Django admin, you can  use the formfield_overrides option as illustrated in Listing 11-19.  Listing 11-19.  Django admin formfield_overrides option for Django admin forms  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models import Menu  class MenuAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     formfield_overrides = {         models.CharField: {'widget': forms.Textarea}     }  admin.site.register Menu, MenuAdmin   525   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  The formfield_overrides option in Listing 11-19 tells the Django admin to use the forms.Textarea  widget - which generates a standard HTML   tag - for all model fields that use the CharField. In  Figure 11-32 you can see the effects of applying the formfield_overrides option of Listing 11-19, whereas in  Figure 11-31 you can see the default widget used for CharField field, which is a standard HTML   tag.  Figure 11-31.  Django admin default CharField field display in Django admin form  Figure 11-32.  Django admin custom CharField field display in Django admin form using formfield_overrides  526   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  While all the previous options allow you to tweak parts of a form used in the Django admin, sometimes   it’s necessary to create a form from scratch for the Django admin instead of tweaking the underlying form  generated by the Django model  e.g., if you require custom validation for the Django admin form . To specify  a custom form for a Django admin class you can use the form option.  Finally, one more option associated with Django admin forms that’s specific to models that require slug   field values is prepopulated_fields. If you’re unfamiliar with the term ‘slug’, in the simplest terms a slug  field value is a machine-friendly representation of a string, for example, uppercase letters are converted to  lowercase and special characters like spaces are converted to dashes. Through the prepopulated_fields  option, you can tell Django that while a user types in a value for a given field in a Django admin form, it  automatically fills another field in the form with the slug representation of the first.  For example, for the prepopulated_fields = {'address': ['city','state']} option, if a user types   in a value of San Diego into the city form field and CA in state, Django fills the address form field with the  value of san-diego-ca. It’s worth mentioning this functionality is achieved through JavaScript integrated  into the Django admin and also that the prepopulated_fields option doesn’t accept DateTimeField,  ForeignKey, or ManyToManyField fields as backing model data types.  Actions, Links, and Positions: save_on_top, save_as Clone records ,  save_as_continue and view_on_site At the bottom of each form page to create, update, and delete Django model records are all the buttons to  perform actions on the page: ‘Delete’, ‘Save and add another’, ‘Save and continue editing’, and ‘Save’, all of  which are illustrated in Figure 11-33. If a form is too large it can be difficult to reach these action buttons  without scrolling down, so to solve this scenario Django admin classes support the save_on_top option,  which creates the same action buttons at the top of the page as illustrated in Figure 11-34. Note that to  generate the layout in Figure 11-34 you use save_on_top = True.  Figure 11-33.  Django admin standard action button on form page  527   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-34.  Django admin save_on_top option on form page  Sometimes the need can arise to generate an identical or almost identical record from a preexisting  record in the Django admin. Because copy-pasting values from one form to another in the Django admin  can be a time-consuming and error-prone process, Django admin classes also support the save_as option  to clone preexisting model records. If you set the save_as = True option on a Django admin class, Django  replaces the ‘Save and add another’ button with the ‘Save as new’ button, as illustrated in Figure 11-35.  Figure 11-35.  Django admin save_as  Clone  option on form page  528   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  If you click on the ‘Save as new’ button illustrated in Figure 11-35, Django saves an identical record -   effectively cloning the record you see on screen - using a different id value to differentiate between the two.  Note that if the underlying Django model prohibits this action  e.g., fields must be unique , the operation  does not take place and an error is thrown indicating the cause.  When you use the save_as = True option and perform the action of cloning a record  i.e., clicking on  the ‘Save as new’ button , the Django admin keeps you on the form of the newly cloned record in case you  want to change it further. You can use the save_as_continue = False option, to tell the Django admin to  redirect you to the main model list page after cloning a record.  Django model classes support an instance method called get_absolute_url   that makes it possible   to resolve the public URL of a record via a Django model’s fields  e.g., the URLs  store 1 ,  store 2 ,   store 3  fit a pattern, where each number represents a Store id value, in which case the get_absolute_ url   method for the Store model would return  store  . In the Django admin, the get_ absolute_url   method is tied directly to a link that aids in viewing the record at its public URL destination,  and Figure 11-36 illustrates this link in the top right corner.  Figure 11-36.  Django admin 'View on site' button due to get_absolute_url   Django model method  In Figure 11-36, the ‘View on site’ button in the top right generates a link based on the Django model’s   get_absolute_url   method, as well as the current record’s value defined in this last method. In this  manner, in a single click you’re able to visualize the record you’re editing in the Django admin at its public  URL destination. If you wish to disable this button you can add the view_on_site = False option to the  Django admin class. Note that if the underlying Django model class does not define the get_absolute_ url   method, no button is displayed, irrespective of the view_on_site value.  Relationships: filter_horizontal, filter_vertical, radio_fields,   raw_id_fields, inlines Django model relationships tasks related to create, update, and delete operations, also have certain  behaviors in the context of Django admin classes that are worth describing separately.  When you use a ManyToManyField field on a Django model and access it in the Django admin, Django   generates HTML     form tags to choose the values for the ManyToManyField field - as  illustrated at the bottom of Figures 11-23 and 11-24. However, because this type of selection method can be  cumbersome for large lists, the Django admin offers the filter_horizontal and filter_vertical options  to generate separate panels to make value selection easier. Figure 11-37 illustrates the layout of the   filter_horizontal option and Figure 11-38 illustrates the layout of filter_vertical option.  529   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-37.  Django admin filter_horizontal option for ManyToManyField  Figure 11-38.  Django admin filter_vertical option for ManyToManyField  In Figures 11-37 and 11-38 you can see there are two panels to select and unselect values for a given  ManyToManyField, with the only difference being filter_horizontal stacks the panels horizontally - in  Figure 11-37 - and filter_vertical stacks the panels vertically - in Figure 11-38.  Assuming the ManyToManyField field is named amenities, to achieve the layout in Figure 11-37 you   would declare filter_horizontal = ['amenities'] and to achieve the layout in Figure 11-38 you would  declare filter_vertical = ['amenities'].  530   When you use a ForeignKey model data type or the choices option in a Django model field and access   it in the Django admin, Django also generates HTML     form tags to choose the value for the  ForeignKey field - as illustrated at the top of Figure 11-39.  Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-39.  Django admin default select list for ForeignKey or choices option  A Django admin class can change this default layout with the radio_fields option to generate a layout   with HTML radio buttons. Listing 11-20 illustrates the two alternatives for the radio_fields option in a  Django admin class and Figures 11-40 and 11-41 the UI layouts.  Listing 11-20.  Django admin radio_fields option for ForeignKey field  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models import Item   Option 1  Horizontal   class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     radio_fields = {"menu": admin.HORIZONTAL}  admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin    Option 2  Vertical   class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     radio_fields = {"menu": admin.VERTICAL}  admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin   531   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-40.  Django admin horizontal radio_fields option for ForeignKey or choices option  Figure 11-41.  Django admin vertical radio_fields option for ForeignKey or choices option  In Listing 11-20 you can see option one defines the radio_fields value with the {"menu": admin. HORIZONTAL} dictionary, where menu represents the ForeignKey field or a field with the choices option  and admin.HORIZONTAL is the orientation of the radio fields - this option generates a layout like the one in  Figure 11-40. Option two in Listing 11-20 defines the radio_fields in a similar way except it uses the admin. VERTICAL value to tell the Django admin to generate a vertical layout for the radio fields as illustrated in  Figure 11-41.  Another Django admin alternative for ForeignKey or ManyToManyField fields is the raw_id_fields   option, which as its name implies relies on the raw id field value s  to assign a ForeignKey value or  ManyToManyField values. Figure 11-42 illustrates how a raw_id_fields option looks like in the Django  admin.  532   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-42.  Django admin raw_id_fields option for ForeignKey or ManyToManyField option  As you can see in Figure 11-42, the Django admin generates a basic text box where you can assign  id values, aided by the adjacent magnifying glass button that allows you to search for and select values.  Assuming the ForeignKey or ManyToManyField field is named menu, to achieve the layout in Figure 11-42 you  would declare raw_id_fields = ["menu"]. Note that for a ForeignKey field the acceptable value is a single  id and for a ManyToManyField field you can also introduce a list of ids separated by commas  i.e., a CSV .  Finally, we come to the Django admin class inlines option, designed for reverse models relationships.  When you create or edit a model with a relationship in the Django admin, if this is done on the model with  the relationship field definition  i.e., ForeignKey or ManyToManyField , the Django admin displays the  related model values inline or adds a ‘+’ button to add new model values, as shown in Figure 11-37 – for  ForeignKey menu values – and Figure 11-39 – for ManyToMany amenities values. However, when you attempt  to edit or create values on the reverse model relationship  i.e., the model that doesn’t have the relationship  field  the Django admin only shows the model by itself as shown Figure 11-31. It’s possible to edit or create  related model values on a reverse model relationship with the inlines option.  The inlines option first requires you to create a Django admin TabularInline or StackedInline  class, both of which are subclasses of the InlineModelAdmin class, which is a more specialized version  of the standard admin.ModelAdmin class used to create standard Django admin classes. Once you have  TabularInline or StackedInline class, you can declare it as part as the value of the inlines option.  Listing 11-21 illustrates two Django admin examples that use a TabularInline and StackedInline class   on models that have a one to many and many to many relationship.  Listing 11-21.  Django admin inlines option for ForeignKey and ManyToManyField field   admin.py  ForeignKey  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models import Item, Menu  class ItemInline admin.TabularInline :     model = Item  class MenuAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['name']     inlines = [         ItemInline,     ]  533   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  admin.site.register Menu, MenuAdmin    admin.py  ManyToManyField  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store, Amenity  class StoreInline admin.StackedInline :     model = Store.amenities.through  class AmenityAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     inlines = [         StoreInline,     ]  admin.site.register Amenity, AmenityAdmin   The first example in Listing 11-21 illustrates the ItemInline class, which inherits its behavior from   built-in TabularInline class. Because this last class is designed to represent a model in the Django admin,  it also declares the model field with the Item model class. Next, the MenuAdmin class is a standard Django  admin class designed for the Menu model class, but notice it uses the inlines option with the ItemInline  class. Because of this last configuration, when you go to edit or create Menu model record in the Django  admin, all Item model records associated with a given Menu model record are displayed inline as illustrated  in Figure 11-43.  Figure 11-43.  Django admin inlines option with TabularInline for ForeignKey  534   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  As you can see in Figure 11-43, in addition to the standard Django admin form to edit or create Menu  records, there’s also a formset displaying all Item model records for the given Menu record; in this case, the  formset contains Item records that belong to the Drinks Menu record. Also notice the form fields for each  form in the formset in Figure 11-43 are inlined as tabs, which is a behavior provided by the TabularInline  class.  The second part of Listing 11-21 illustrates the StoreInline class that inherits its behavior from built-in   StackedInline class. Because this last class is designed to represent a model in the Django admin, it also  declares the model field with the Store.amenities.through model class, this additional model syntax –  amenities.through – is necessary because the Store to Amenity model is a many to many relationship.  Note the through keyword is standard for many to many relationship queries and is described in the earlier  Django model chapters.  Next, the AmenityAdmin class is a standard Django admin class designed for the Item model class, but  notice it uses the inlines option with the StoreInline class. Because of this last configuration, when you  go to edit or create an Amenity model record in the Django admin, all Store model records associated with a  given Amenity model record are displayed inline as illustrated in Figure 11-44.  Figure 11-44.  Django admin inlines option with StackedInline for ManyToManyField  As you can see in Figure 11-44, in addition the standard Django admin form to edit or create Amenity  records, there’s also a formset displaying all Store model records for the given Amenity record; in this case,  the formset contains Store records that have the Amenity Laptop locks record. Also notice the form  fields for each form in the formset in Figure 11-43 are inline stacks, which is a behavior provided by the  StackedInline class.  535   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management   InlineModelAdmin classes  i.e., TabularInline or StackedInline  in addition to the model option,      Tip  also support standard Django admin class – admin.ModelAdmin – options described earlier  e.g., form, fields,  exclude , as well as standard formset options described in Chapter 6 and model formset options described in  Chapter 9  e.g., formset, extra, max_num, min_num .2  Django admin Custom Page Layout, Data, and Behaviors  In addition to the Django admin class options described in previous sections, there are multiple ways to  customize the layout, data, and behaviors of Django admin pages. You can customize certain global values  used across all Django admin pages without the need to modify any Django template. But in addition, it’s  also possible to customize any template used by a Django admin page – like the log in, log out, password  update, display record, and create update delete record page – to alter its layout  e.g., modify the default  blue CSS skin or component positions in the page .  Finally, it’s also possible to customize the data passed to Django admin pages, as well as modify the   default behavior run by Django admin pages  e.g., CRUD actions  by means of methods and fields declared  as part of a Django admin class.  Django admin Custom Global Values for Default Templates By default, the Django admin is configured as part of a Django project’s urls.py file, as shown in the  following snippet:  from django.conf.urls import url from django.contrib import admin  urlpatterns = [     url r'^admin ', admin.site.urls , ]  While admin.site.urls – from the django.contrib package – lets you set up the Django admin on the   admin  url, the same django.contrib.admin.site object also allows you to customize certain values used  by all Django admin pages.  Listing 11-22 illustrates how to customize several Django admin fields through the django.contrib.  admin.site object.  Listing 11-22.  Django admin django.contrib.admin.site object to customize fields  from django.conf.urls import url from django.contrib import admin  admin.site.site_header = 'Coffeehouse admin' admin.site.site_title = 'Coffeehouse admin' admin.site.site_url = 'http:  coffeehouse.com ' admin.site.index_title = 'Coffeehouse administration' admin.empty_value_display = '**Empty**'  2https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref contrib admin inlinemodeladmin-options  536   urlpatterns = [     url r'^admin ', admin.site.urls , ]  Chapter 11   Django aDmin management   it’s also possible to define the custom admin field values in Listing 11-22 inside the settings.py      Tip  file. Simply import django.contrib.admin and declare the admin fields to centralize them with other custom  configurations in settings.py.  As you can see in Listing 11-22, before declaring admin.site.urls as a url statement, there are a series   of declarations on the admin.site object that are also part of the django.contrib package:   	   	   	   	   	  admin.site.site_header.- Defines the title used across all Django admin pages   e.g., in the navy blue header and login page . See Figures 11-45 and 11-46.  admin.site.site_title.- Defines the title used across all Django admin pages, as  part of the HTML title. See Figures 11-45 and 11-46.  admin.site.site_url.- Defines the domain  e.g., coffeehouse.com  to use as part  of the Django admin ‘View site’ link, to easily access the live site from the Django  admin. See Figure 11-45.  admin.site.index_title.- Defines the title of the main Django admin page. See  Figure 11-45.  admin.empty_value_display.- Defines the default value to display when a Django  admin model value is empty.  Figure 11-45.  Django admin main index with custom global values  537   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Figure 11-46.  Django admin login page with custom global values  As you can see in Figures 11-45 and 11-46, with a few simple statements like the ones in Listing 11-22,   you can customize the Django admin template content, without the need to interact with templates or HTML.  It’s worth noting the admin.empty_value_display option described in Listing 11-22 is applied to  all Django admin models when a record field contains an empty value. Examples of the admin.empty_ value_display option were described earlier in this chapter in the ‘Record Display’ section, specifically in  Figures 11-5 and 11-6, as well as Listing 11-5.  Django admin Custom Page Layout with Custom Templates Although the django.contrib.admin.site object options presented in Listing 11-22 offer a quick way to  customize Django admin pages, they can fall short in the face of more sophisticated requirements, in which  case you must rely on custom templates.  The default templates used by the Django admin are located under the  django contrib admin  templates  directory of your Django installation inside your operating system’s or virtual env Python  environment  e.g.,   lib python3.5 site-packages django contrib admin  templates  .  Similar to the Django template customization techniques described in previous chapters  e.g., Django  form widgets, Django allauth , you can create a copy of these default templates and place them inside your  project. In this manner, the templates inside a project take precedence over the default Django admin  templates, where you can customize the project templates to fit your needs.  The Django admin  django contrib admin templates  directory contains two template folders:   admin and registration. Copy them to a project directory that’s part of a DIRS folder of the TEMPLATES DIRS  variable in settings.py.  538   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management     Tip    See the book’s accompanying source code that includes the layout of all Django admin templates.  All the Django admin templates inherit their behavior from the admin base_site.html template,   which itself inherits its behavior from the admin base.html template. If you’re unfamiliar with how Django  template inheritance works, look over Chapter 3, which describes this topic.  If you open the admin base.html template, you can see the core structure behind every Django   admin page, such as the HTML   section  e.g., CSS files, meta tags , navigation header, and message  notification block, among other things. Therefore, you can modify the admin base.html template to include  custom CSS or JavaScript files to alter the ‘look & feel’ of every Django admin page.  In addition to the admin base.html template, there are many other templates inside the admin and   registration directories whose functions are described in the following list:   	   	   	   	   	  	  admin 404.html and admin 500.html.- Defines the layout for Django admin not  found and error pages  i.e., HTTP 404 and HTTP 500 , respectively.  admin index.html.- Defines the layout for Django admin index pages, on the main  page – shown in Figure 11-45 – as well as those for app indexes showing all models.  admin change_list.html.- Defines the layout for Django admin list pages, those  used to read records, shown from Figures 11-1 to 11-22.  admin change_form.html.- Defines the layout for Django admin form pages, those  used to create, update, and delete records, shown from Figures 11-23 to 11-44.  admin login.html.- Defines the Django admin login page, shown in Figure 11-46.  registration folder.- Contains templates for the various Django admin page  password change actions, as well as the Django admin logout page layout.     Note   other pages in the admin folder not described in this list  e.g., filter.html, object_history.html   are more granular templates – included as part of the larger templates in this list – which you can customize as  necessary.  As you can see, by creating a copy of the Django admin templates and placing them in your project,   you can fine-tune the layout of every Django admin page by modifying its backing template. An important  modular behavior worth mentioning about the Django admin index.html, change_list.html and change_ form.html templates, is how they can be applied to individual Django admin apps or models.  By default, if you provide a custom layout for the admin index.html, admin change_list.html or   admin change_form.html templates, these templates are used for all apps and models in the Django admin   i.e., globally . However, sometimes it can be necessary to customize Django admin index pages, list pages,  or form pages for only certain apps  e.g., stores app  or inclusively an individual model  e.g., Item model .  To define a custom Django admin template for all models in an app, you can create a Django admin   template and place it under the template path admin     e.g., admin stores change_list.html  to define a change_list.html template for all stores app models .  To define a custom Django admin template for a single model, you can create a Django admin template   and place it under the template path admin       e.g., admin items item change_list. html to define a change_list.html template to use on the Item model of the items app .  539   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management     Note   only the templates admin index.html-admin app_index.html, change_form.html, change_list. html, delete_confirmation.html, object_history.html, and popup_response.html can be customized on  a per app and per model basis.  Django admin Custom Static Resources If you customize the Django admin admin base.html template in your project with custom CSS or JavaScript  files, these static resources take effect on every Django admin page. While this can be a desired effect in  certain circumstances, in other cases, it can be necessary to only apply custom static resources to certain  Django admin pages.  Django admin classes support the Media class to define both CSS and JavaScript files and include   them on all pages associated with a given Django admin class. The advantage of using the Media class on a  Django admin class is that you don’t need to deal with templates or HTML markup, with the Django admin  automatically loading the static resources as part of every admin page linked to an admin class. Listing 11-23  illustrates a Django admin class that makes use of the Media class.  Listing 11-23.  Django admin class with Media class to define custom static resources  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models Item  class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_per_page = 5       class Media:             css = {                 "screen":  "css items items.css",              }             js =  "js items items.js",   admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin   As you can see in Listing 11-23, the Media class supports the css and js fields to declare both CSS and   JavaScript static files, respectively. In the case of css, Listing 11-23 declares a dictionary, where the key  corresponds to the CSS media type and the value is a tuple with a CSS file. For the case of js, Listing 11-23  declares a tuple pointing to a JavaScript file. All files declared as part of a Media class are automatically  searched for in Django’s static file directory paths – as described in Chapter 5.  The final outcome of Listing 11-23 is that all Django admin pages associated with the ItemAdmin   admin class  e.g., index.html, change_list.html, change_form.html  will include an additional CSS  import statement  e.g., <link href=" static css items items.css" type="text css" media="screen"  rel="stylesheet"  > , as well as an additional JavaScript import statement  e.g., <script type="text  javascript" src=" static js items items.js">  .  It’s worth pointing out that while you can include any third-party CSS or JavaScript library in a Django  admin page  e.g., Bootstrap, D3 , Django admin pages already include the popular jQuery 2.2 library under  the django.jQuery namespace to fulfill certain functionalities. The Django admin uses a jQuery namespace,  to let you import any other jQuery library version in Django admin pages without fear of conflict. If you want  to leverage the included Django admin jQuery library for your own custom JavaScript, you must wrap your  JavaScript logic in this namespace, as illustrated in the following snippet:  540   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management   function $  {        Custom JavaScript logic leveraging the Django admin built-in jQuery libray     $ document .ready function   {        $ '.deletelink' .on 'click',function   {             if  !confirm 'Are you sure you want to delete this record ?'   {               return false;            }        } ;     } ; }  django.jQuery ;    <-- Note wrapping namespace  As you can see in this last snippet, by wrapping your custom JavaScript logic in the django.jQuery   namespace, it gains access to the Django admin built-in jQuery library  i.e., the custom JavaScript logic gains  access to the jQuery $ scope .  GRAPPELLI PROJECT – AN OUT-OF-BOX DJANGO ADMIN   SUPPLEMENT  if you want try a different ‘look & feel’ for the Django admin, without having to write custom templates  or supporting CSS & javaScript files, there are various Django apps designed for this purpose.  one of the most popular apps is the ‘grappelli project’.3 grappelli uses the ‘Compass’ CSS authoring  Framework to include additional Django admin features like: auto-complete, inline sortable ‘drag & drop’  and support for jQuery plug-ins, among other things.  Django admin Custom Data and Behaviors with admin Class Fields  and Methods Although the modification of Django admin templates allows you to generate any type of Django admin  page layout, it can still fall short for cases where you need to include custom data in Django admin pages   e.g., add data from another model for reference  or override the default CRUD behaviors of Django admin  pages  e.g., perform a custom audit trail for delete actions .  Django admin classes like the ones you’ve written in this chapter since Listing 11-1, rely on over two   dozen fields – all of which you explored in the previous sections in this chapter as Django admin read  options and create update delete options – and over three dozen methods4 to define a Django admin page’s  default data and behaviors.  In a very similar way to how you can customize the default behaviors and data used by Django class- based views – described in Chapter 9 – Django admin classes can also define their own custom fields and  methods to override their default data and behaviors.  The bulk of this chapter already covered all the Django admin class fields to customize Django admin   page behaviors, so I won’t readdress them once again. However, I will provide examples of the most  common Django admin class methods to illustrate how to add custom data and override other default  behaviors in Django admin pages.  3http:  grappelliproject.com  4https:  docs.djangoproject.com en 1.11 ref contrib admin adminsite-methods  541   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Listing 11-24 illustrates a Django admin class that uses a custom implementation of the changelist_  view   method – which adds custom data to access in the underlying Django admin change_list.html  template – as well as a custom implementation of the delete_view   method – to execute custom logic  when a delete action is taken on a Django admin class.  Listing 11-24.  Django admin class with custom changelist_view   and delete_view   methods  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     search_fields = ['city','state']     def changelist_view self, request, extra_context=None :          Add extra context data to pass to change list template         extra_context = extra_context or {}         extra_context['my_store_data'] = {'onsale':['Item 1','Item 2']}          Execute default logic from parent class changelist_view           return super StoreAdmin, self .changelist_view              request, extra_context=extra_context               def delete_view self, request, object_id, extra_context=None :          Add custom audit logic here                   Execute default logic from parent class delete_view           return super StoreAdmin, self .delete_view              request, object_id, extra_context=extra_context            admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin   As you can in Listing 11-24, both the changelist_view   and delete_view   methods are declared   inline with the Django admin search_fields option you learned earlier. In this case, the changelist_ view   method in Listing 11-24 is triggered whenever you visit the list view page of the Store model in the  Django admin  e.g., illustrated in Figure 11-10 . Notice the changelist_view   method adds a custom value  to the extra_context variable, which is then returned as part of the response, in this case it’s a hard-coded  value, but you can equally add any type of data like a model query or third-party API call to pass to the  Django admin page. Because of this last workflow, the list view page of the Store model  i.e., the change_ list.html template  can gain access to custom data to display as part page.  The delete_view   method in Listing 11-24 is triggered whenever you delete a Store model in the   Django admin. In this case, the delete_view   method in Listing 11-24 simply triggers the default action of  deleting a record by calling the parent class’s delete_view   method, but you can see how it’s possible to  execute custom logic  e.g., create an audit trail  whenever a delete action is performed on a Store model in  the Django admin.  As I’ve already mentioned, Django admin classes rely on over three dozen methods to implement  their default behavior, all of which you can customize to suit your requirements. Given the amount of  custom variations that this amount of methods can generate, you can use the example in Listing 11-24  as a guide and consult the footnote in the previous page for other methods you can customize in Django  admin classes.  542   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Django admin CRUD Permissions  By default, the Django admin allows access to users with superuser and staff permissions – in case you’ve  never heard of the terms Django superuser, Django staff, or Django permissions, see the previous chapter  that describes Django user management.  A Django superuser, as its name implies, means it’s a user with ‘super’ permissions. By extension, this   means a superuser has access to any page in the Django admin, as well as permissions to Create, Read, Update,  and Delete any type of model record available in the Django admin. Because Django superusers represent an  ‘all or nothing’ proposition, the Django admin is also designed to allow access to Django staff users.  Any Django user marked as staff is given access to the Django admin, but nothing else, unless explicitly   given permissions, as illustrated in Figure 11-47.  Figure 11-47.  Django admin main page for staff user with no permissions  As you can see in Figure 11-47, the main Django admin page is empty. Although this scenario of an   empty Django admin main page can also present itself when you have no registered models in a project’s  admin.py files, this case represents a scenario for a staff user with no explicit model permissions.  In order for staff users to gain access to Django admin pages, they must be given explicit permissions by  means of model permissions, given Django admin pages operate on the basis of CRUD model actions  e.g., a  Django admin page to create model records, a Django admin page to delete model records .  By default, all Django models are given add, change, and delete permissions, which you can assign to   staff users. As a consequence, each of these model permissions represents an access permission for a Django  admin page.  For example, if a staff user is given the delete permission on a model, it means he’s also given access  to delete records of said model in the Django admin. Similarly, if a staff user is given the add permission on  a model, it means he’s given access to the create record page of said model in the Django admin. Finally, if  a staff user is given the change permission on a model, it means he’s given access to the edit record page of  said model in the Django admin.  543   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management   granting a delete permission to a user on a given model also requires granting the change      Note  permission to fulfill the delete action in the Django admin. this is because the Django admin delete action is  available on the Django admin record change page.  As you can deduce from this behavior, by using staff users and model permissions, you can allow very  fine-grained access to different sections of the Django admin, instead of the ‘all or nothing’ Django admin  superuser behavior.  Still, Django admin staff users have one important missing behavior: the ability to allow read only   access for model records in the Django admin. Because Django models default to having add, change and  delete permissions  i.e. CUD [Create, Update, Delete] behaviors , a read permission is deemed implicit  with the presence of change  i.e. if you’re able to change a record, then you’re able to read it . Therefore,  to achieve a standalone read-only permission in the Django admin, you must add a custom model read  permission  i.e. the missing R in CRUD .  The previous chapter describes custom model permissions in greater detail, but I’ll describe this   process in Listing 11-25 for the context of the Django admin by adding a read only permission.  Listing 11-25.  Django model with custom read permission and Django admin class enforcing read  permission   models.py from django.db import models  class Menu models.Model :     name = models.CharField max_length=30      creator = models.CharField max_length=100,default='Coffeehouse Chef'   class Item models.Model :     menu = models.ForeignKey Menu, on_delete=models.CASCADE      name = models.CharField max_length=30      description = models.CharField max_length=100      class Meta:         permissions =                'read_item','Can read item' ,             admin.py from django.contrib import admin  from coffeehouse.items.models import Item  class ItemAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :       list_per_page = 5       list_display = ['menu','name','menu_creator']       def get_readonly_fields self, request, obj=None :         if not request.user.is_superuser and request.user.has_perm 'items.read_item' :             return [f.name for f in self.model._meta.fields]  544   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management          return super ItemAdmin, self .get_readonly_fields              request, obj=obj            admin.site.register Item, ItemAdmin   The first step highlighted in Listing 11-25 is the Item model with a custom permission named read_ item with the friendly name 'Can read item'. After you run the Item model in Listing 11-25 through its  corresponding migration, the Item model will get a custom read_item permission. Next, create a staff user  and assign it both the read_item and built-in change permission of Item model. Once a staff user is given  these permissions, you must enforce the Django admin class for the Item model only allow read access to  users with these permissions.  When a user is given the change permission on a model, the Django admin grants a user access to the   Django admin form page, which is used to update records of a given model and is shown from Figures 11-23  to 11-44. But since you want to restrict the update functionality to read only, you must set this page’s form  fields to read only, which is the purpose of the get_readonly_fields   method in the second part of the  Listing 11-25.  By defining an admin class with a custom get_readonly_fields   method, you can tell the Django  admin under which circumstances you want to set a Django admin page’s form fields to read only. In this  case, you can see the logic of the get_readonly_fields   method in Listing 11-25 uses the is_superuser    and has_perm   methods the determine if the calling party is not a superuser  i.e. staff  and if the user has  the read_item permission on the Item model. If this last rule is true, then the get_readonly_fields    method sets all the model form fields to read-only, which is the whole purpose the get_readonly_fields    method. If this last rule is false, then the get_readonly_fields   method returns its default behavior calling  the parent class’s default get_readonly_fields   method.  As you can see with this brief exercise, by using custom Django admin class methods in conjunction  with standard and custom Django model permissions, there are no limitations to restricting or allowing  CRUD operations in the Django admin.  Multiple Django admin Sites  Throughout this chapter, you’ve learned the Django admin site is activated under the  admin  url using  django.contrib.admin.site.urls. In addition, the Django admin site also requires the definition of Django  admin classes to be placed inside a Django project’s app admin.py files and registered using one of the  techniques described in Listing 11-1  e.g. django.contrib.admin.site.register Store,StoreAdmin    While this is the standard practice for almost all Django admin site installations, this process can differ  for cases when you want or need to set up multiple Django admin sites. This of course begets the question  'Why would you want or need multiple Django admin sites ?'  Mulitple Django admin sites are helpful because they let you separate the access locations for different  types of users or groups. For example, you can have a Django admin site designed to let employees perform  CRUD operations across different models, while having a completely different Django admin site designed  to let providers perform more limited CRUD operations across another set of models.  If you maintain a single Django admin site, creating a solution for multiple types of users and models  can be very difficult as you only have user permissions to enforce CRUD operation access, as described in  the previous section. With multiple Django admin sites, you can register models in one or both admin sites  depending on your requirements.  The first step to create multiple Django admin sites is to create multiple instances of the django.  contrib.admin.AdminSite class, as illustrated in Listing 11-26  545   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Listing 11-26.  Django admin multiple sites accessible on different urls   urls.py  Main directory  from django.conf.urls import include, url from django.views.generic import TemplateView  from django.contrib import admin admin.site.site_header = 'Coffeehouse general admin'  from coffeehouse.admin import employeeadmin, provideradmin  urlpatterns = [ url r'^$',TemplateView.as_view template_name='homepage.html' ,name="homepage" , url r'^admin ', admin.site.urls , url r'^employeeadmin ', employeeadmin.urls , url r'^provideradmin ', provideradmin.urls , ]   admin.py  Main directory  from django.contrib.admin import AdminSite  class EmployeeAdminSite AdminSite :     site_header = 'Coffeehouse Employee admin' employeeadmin = EmployeeAdminSite name='employeeadmin'   class ProviderAdminSite AdminSite :     site_header = 'Coffeehouse Provider admin' provideradmin = ProviderAdminSite name='provideradmin'   First, notice Listing 11-26 declares the standard Django admin with the django.contrib.admin class  in urls.py, including a custom site_header value to mount the Django admin on the standard  admin   url. Next, two custom Django admin instances are configured on their own urls –  employeeadmin  and   provideradmin  – using a urls reference that corresponds to a custom django.contrib.admin.AdminSite  class.  Both the EmployeeAdminSite and ProviderAdminSite custom Django admin site classes are defined in  their own admin.py file in the top level directory of the project  i.e. alongside the main urls.py file . Notice  how each of the custom Django admin site classes inherits its behavior from the django.contrib.admin. AdminSite class. Next, observe how each instance of the AdminSite classes in Listing 11-26, also defines the  site_header field to define a custom header for each Django admin site instance, just like it’s done with the  standard Django admin site.  At this juncture, if you visit either the  employeeadmin  and  provideradmin  urls for the custom   Django admins, you’ll access a main Django admin page like the one in Figure 11-47. The reason you’ll see  an empty Django admin page in both cases, is because each custom Django admin site still doesn’t have any  models registered to it.  To register Django admin classes with a custom Django admin site, you can use any of the techniques  already described in Listing 11-1. The difference though is you must register a Django admin class with an  instance of a specific Django admin site  e.g. employeeadmin, provideradmin  instead of the default django. contrib.admin class, as illustrated in Listing 11-27.  546   Chapter 11   Django aDmin management  Listing 11-27.  Django admin class registration on multiple Django admin sites   admin.py  stores app  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store,Amenity  class StoreAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     search_fields = ['city','state']   Default model registration on main Django admin admin.site.register Store, StoreAdmin    Model registration on custom Django admin named provideradmin from coffeehouse.admin import provideradmin provideradmin.register Store, StoreAdmin    admin.py  items app  from django.contrib import admin from coffeehouse.items.models import Menu  class MenuAdmin admin.ModelAdmin :     list_display = ['name','creator']   Default model registration on main Django admin admin.site.register Menu, MenuAdmin    Model registration on custom Django admin named provideradmin from coffeehouse.admin import employeeadmin employeeadmin.register Menu, MenuAdmin   Notice in Listing 11-27, that in addition to the default Django admin class registration done through  admin.site.register, the Store class is registered with the custom provideradmin Django admin class  and the Menu class is registered with the custom employeeeadmin Django admin class, both of which are the  custom Django admin classes declared in Listing 11-26.  As you can see in Listing 11-27, it’s perfectly valid to register the same Django admin class on multiple   Django admin sites, a process that allows you to selectively access certain models under different Django  admin sites.   multiple Django admin sites don’t preclude user permissions, authentication or url visibility. By      Caution  default, all Django users can use the same credentials and are assigned the same permissions across multiple  Django admin sites. this means it’s up to you to enforce effective model permissions across all Django admin  sites, limit model registration for each Django admin site, as well as avoid easy to guess Django admin urls to  avoid unintended access.  547   CHAPTER 12  REST Services with Django  Representational state transfer  REST  services or simply RESTful services have become one of the most  popular techniques in web development since they first appeared in the year 2000. While there's a long  background story on REST services,1 which I won't get into here, the appeal and explosive growth of REST  services in web development is simply due to how they solve a common problem in an easy and reusable  manner.  In this chapter, you’ll learn about the options available to create REST services with Django, including   plain Python Django REST services and framework specific REST services. In addition, you’ll learn how  to create REST services with plain Python Django packages and when they’re preferable over using  framework specific REST services packages. In addition, you’ll also learn how to create and use some of the  most important features of REST services created with the Django REST framework, as well as incorporate  essential security into Django REST framework services.  REST Services in Django  A REST service provides access to data through an end point or Internet URL making no assumption about  who uses it  e.g., an IoT device, a mobile phone or, a desktop browser ; this means there's no device or  environment requirements to access REST services – all you need is Internet access.  On top of this, because REST services operate on Internet URLs, they provide a very intuitive access  scheme. For example, the REST service URL  products  can mean 'get all product data', while the URL    products 10 20  can mean get all data for products with a price between 10 and 20 and the URL    products drinks  get all product data in the drinks category.  The power of this last approach is there's no steep learning curve  e.g., language syntax, complex   business logic  to access REST service variations that solve elaborate data queries. Because of these  features and versatility, REST services work as a reusable data backbone across a wide array of areas and  applications. For example, practically the entire web API  Application Programming Interface  world  operates around REST web services, because by definition an API must provide a device environment  neutral way for customers to access their functionality. In fact, there's a high chance most web sites you visit  make use of REST services in one way or another, a practice that allows web site operators to reuse the same  data and then format it for users on desktop browsers, IoT devices, mobile applications, RSS feeds, or any  other target like Accelerated Mobile Pages AMP .2  With this brief overview of REST services, let's start with the simplest option available to create REST   services in Django.  1https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Representational_state_transfer 2https:  www.ampproject.org     Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9_12  549   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Standard View Method Designed as REST Service You can actually create a REST service in Django with just the Django package and Python's core packages,  with no need to install any third-party package. Listing 12-1 illustrates a standard Django url and view  method designed to function as a REST service.  Listing 12-1.  Standard view method designed as REST service   urls.py  In stores app  from coffeehouse.stores import views as stores_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^rest $',stores_views.rest_store,name="rest_index" , ]   views.py  In stores app  from django.http import HttpResponse from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store import json  def rest_store request :     store_list = Store.objects.all       store_names = [{"name":store.name} for store in store_list]     return HttpResponse json.dumps store_names , content_type='application json'    Sample output  [{"name": "Corporate"}, {"name": "Downtown"}, {"name": "Uptown"}, {"name": "Midtown"}]  The url statement in Listing 12-1 defines an access pattern on the stores app under the rest directory    i.e., final url  stores rest   . This last url statement is hooked up to the rest_store view method –  also in Listing 12-1 – which makes a query to get all Store records from the database, then creates a  list comprehension to generate a list of store names from the resulting query and finally uses Django's  HttpResponse to return a JSON response with the store names using Python's json package. The design in  Listing 12-1 is one of the simplest REST services you can create in Django and has some important points:   	   	  Serialization.- Notice the Store query is not used directly in the response, but  rather a list comprehension is created first. This is done to serialize the data into  an appropriate format. Due to the way Django queries are built, results may not be  naturally serializable, so a list comprehension is used to ensure the data is a standard  Python dictionary that can be converted to JSON with the json package. I’ll provide  more details on why serialization is an important piece of working with REST  services in the following sidebar.  Response handling.- Notice the use of Django's low-level HttpResponse method vs.  Django’s more common render   method to generate a response. While it’s possible  to use Django’s render   method and further pass the data to a template to format  the response, for most REST services this is unnecessary as responses tend to be  raw data  e.g., JSON, XML  and can be generated without a backing template. In  addition, notice in Listing 12-1 the HttpResponse uses the content_type argument  that adds the HTTP Content-Type application json header telling the requesting  party the response is JSON. The HTTP Content-Type response value is important  because it avoids consumers having to guess how to process a REST service response   550   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django   e.g., another Content-Type option can be application xml for REST services with  XML responses . HTTP response handling for Django view methods is discussed in  greater detail in Chapter 2.   	   No  Query parameters.- For simplicity, the view method in Listing 12-1 has no  parameters, so it provides a very rigid output  i.e., all stores in a JSON format .  ERROR: IS NOT JSON XML SERIALIZABLE  one of the most common errors you’re likely to encounter when you create reSt services in Django  is the ‘is not jSon XML serializable’ error. this means Django isn’t capable of serializing  i.e.,  representing converting  the source data into the selected format – jSon or XML. this error happens  when the source data is made up of objects or data types that can produce undetermined or ambiguous  serializing results.  For example, if you have a Store model class with relationships, how should Django serialize these  relationships? Similarly, if you have a python datetime instance how should Django serialize the value,  as DD MM YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY, or something else? in every case, Django never attempts to guess the  serialization representation, so unless the source data is naturally serializable – as in Listing 12-1 - you  must explicitly specify a serialization scheme – as i’ll explain next – or you’ll get the ‘is not jSon XML  serializable’ error.  Now that you have a brief understanding of a simple REST service in Django, let’s rework the REST  service in Listing 12-1 to make use of parameters so it can return different data results and data formats.  Listing 12-2.  Standard view method as REST service with parameters and different output formats   urls.py  In stores app  from coffeehouse.stores import views as stores_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^rest $',stores_views.rest_store,name="rest_index" ,     url r'^ ?P \d+  rest $',stores_views.rest_store,name="rest_detail" , ]   views.py  In stores app  from django.http import HttpResponse from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from django.core import serializers  def rest_store request,store_id=None :     store_list = Store.objects.all       if store_id:         store_list = store_list.filter id=store_id      if 'type' in request.GET and request.GET['type'] == 'xml':         serialized_stores = serializers.serialize 'xml',store_list          return HttpResponse serialized_stores, content_type='application xml'      else:         serialized_stores = serializers.serialize 'json',store_list          return HttpResponse serialized_stores, content_type='application json'   551   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  The first thing that’s different in Listing 12-2 is an additional url statement that accepts requests with a  store_id parameter  e.g.,  stores 1 rest ,  stores 2 rest  . In this case, the new url is processed by the  same rest_store   view method to process the stores index from Listing 12-1  i.e.,  stores rest    Next, the view method in Listing 12-2 is a modified version of the view method in Listing 12-1 that  accepts a store_id parameter. This modification allows the REST service to process a url request for all  stores  e.g.,  stores rest   or individual stores  e.g.,  stores 1 rest  for store number 1 . If you’re  unfamiliar on how to set up Django urls with parameters, see Chapter 2, which describes url parameters.  Once inside the view method, a query is made to get all Store records from a database. In case the   method receives a store_id value, an additional filter is applied on the query to limit the results to the given  store_id. This last query logic is perfectly efficient due to the way Django queries work – if you’re unfamiliar  with the behavior in Django queries, see Chapter 8 “Understanding a QuerySet” section.  Next, an inspection is made on the request to see if it has the type parameter with an xml value. If a  request matches this last rule  e.g.,  stores rest ?type=xml , then an XML response is generated for the  REST service; if it doesn’t match this last rule, then a JSON response – the default – is generated for the REST  service.  While the example in Listing 12-2 also uses HttpResponse and the content_type argument just like   Listing 12-1, notice the data is prepared with Django’s django.core.serializers package that is designed  to make data serialization easier - unlike the REST service in Listing 12-1 that required pre-processing the  query data with a listing comprehension and then using Python’s json package to complete the process.  The use of django.core.serializers is very simple in Listing 12-2. The serialize   method is used,   which expects the serialization type as its first argument  e.g., 'xml' or 'json'  and the data to serialize  as the second argument  e.g., the store_list reference that represents the query . There’s much more  functionality behind the django.core.serializers package  e.g., filters  that I won’t explore here to keep  things simple, but Figures 12-1 and 12-2 show two sample results from the REST service in Listing 12-2.  Figure 12-1.  JSON output from Django REST serviceXML output from Django REST service  552   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Figure 12-2.  XML output from Django REST service  As you can see in Figures 12-1 and 12-2, Django is capable of serializing a query and outputting its result   as a REST service response in either JSON or XML, with just the few lines in Listing 12-2. It’s likely these few  lines from Listing 12-2 can take you a long way toward building your own REST services in Django, but if  you’ve never done REST services or plan to use REST services as the centerpiece of an application or web  site, you should pause to analyze your requirements.  Because REST services solve a common problem in an easy and reusable manner, they tend to suffer   from scope creep, a characteristic where changes appear to be never ending and functionality is always ‘not  quite finished’. After seeing this initial Django REST service example, ask yourself the following questions:   	 Do you need to support REST services for more than a couple of Django model   types?  e.g., Store,Drink,Employee .   	 Do you need to customize the JSON XML response to something that doesn’t   map directly to Django model records?  e.g., use a custom schema, filter certain  attributes .   	 Do you need to provide a friendly interface for users, describing what a REST service   does and what parameters it accepts?   	 Do you need to support some kind of authentication mechanism so the REST service   isn’t publicly available?   	 Do you need REST services to support more than just displaying data or read   operations?  e.g., update and delete operations ?  If you said yes to most of the previous questions, then your REST services undertaking is beyond basic.   While you could continue building on the example in Listing 12-2 – using a standard Django view method  and additional Python packages – to support all of the previous scenarios, supporting these more elaborate  REST services features in Django is a path many have gone down before, to the point there are dedicated  frameworks for just this purpose.  553   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Django REST Framework3 The Django REST framework is now in its third version. Compared to writing your own REST services  from plain Python Django packages as I just described, the Django REST framework offers the following  advantages:   	   	  A web browsable interface.- Provides a user-friendly descriptive page for all REST  services  e.g., input parameters, options . Similar to how the Django admin provides  a near effortless interface to view a Django project’s database, the Django REST  framework offers a near effortless interface for end users to discover a Django  project’s REST services.  Integrated authentication mechanisms.- To restrict access to REST services and save  you time integrating authentication logic, the Django REST framework is tightly  integrated with authentication mechanisms like OAuth2, HTTP Signature, HTTP  digest authentication, JSON Web Token Authentication, and HAWK  HTTP Holder- Of-Key Authentication Scheme , among others.   	 More flexible and sophisticated serializers.- To avoid having to reinvent the wheel   and constantly deal with ‘Is not serializable’ errors, the Django REST framework has  its own serializers designed to work with complex data relationships.  These are just some of the core benefits of using the Django REST framework. As you can realize, if you  plan to create more than a couple of REST services, investing the time to learn the Django REST framework  is well worth the time vs. dealing with the scaffolding code necessary to deploy REST services using plain  Python Django packages.  Django Tastypie Framework4 The Django Tastypie framework emerged as an alternative to the Django REST framework. Although the  Django Tastypie framework is in its 0.14 version, don’t let the pre-1.0 release number fool you: the Django  Tastypie framework has been in development since 2010. Although both the Django Tastypie framework and  Django REST framework can potentially produce the same results, the Django Tastypie framework has these  differences:  Tastypie provides more default behaviors, making it simpler to configure and set up REST services than   with the Django REST framework.  Tastypie is still the second most used Django REST package5 - albeit it gets half the downloads of the   Django REST framework - so it’s still an attractive option for many Django projects.  Tastypie was originally developed by the same creators of Django haystack, which is still the most   popular Django search package6 - so Tastypie operates on some very solid Python Django fundamentals. Even though the Django Tastypie framework is not as mainstream as the Django REST framework, if   you feel overwhelmed creating REST services with the latter, you can always try out the former to arrive  at a faster REST solution rather than building your REST services from scratch with plain Python Django  packages.  3http:  www.django-rest-framework.org  4http:  tastypieapi.org  5https:  djangopackages.org grids g rest  6https:  djangopackages.org grids g search   554   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Django REST Framework Concepts and Introduction  The Django REST framework is distributed as a standard Python package. So to get started, you need to  install the Django REST framework with the command: pip install djangorestframework.  Once you install the Django REST framework package, add it to the INSTALLED_APPS list variable in your   Django project’s settings.py file with the name rest_framework. Once this is done, you can start working  with the Django REST framework. Next, let’s walk through the core concepts and creation process of a REST  service using the Django REST framework.  Serializers and Views Serializers are one of the main building blocks of the Django REST framework used to define the  representation of data records, which are generally based on Django models. As described in the previous  section on Introduction to REST services options for Django, Python records can have ambiguous data  representations  e.g., a record with a datetime value can be represented as DD MM YYYY, DD-MM-YYYY,  or MM-YYYY  and a serializer removes any uncertainty about how to represent a record. Listing 12-3  illustrates a Django REST framework serializer using one of its serializers package.  Listing 12-3.  Serializer class based on Django REST framework   coffeehouse.stores.serializers.py file from rest_framework import serializers  class StoreSerializer serializers.Serializer :     name = serializers.CharField max_length=200      email = serializers.EmailField    As you can see in Listing 12-3, a Django REST framework serializer is a standard Python class, which  in this case, inherits its behavior from the Django REST framework’s serializers.Serializer class. Next,  inside the serializer class are a set of fields that use the data types from the serializers package of the same  Django REST framework. Notice the similar structure between this Django REST framework serializer class  and Django model classes or Django form classes  i.e., they inherit their behavior from a parent class and  use different fields to represent different data types like character and email fields .  The example in Listing 12-3 is one of the simplest Django REST framework serializer classes possible,  because it only has two fields and inherits its behavior from the very basic serializers.Serializer class.  But just as with Django models and forms, as you progress with the Django REST framework, you’ll find  yourself using more advanced data types, as well as creating serializers with more sophisticated base classes  than serializers.Serializer. I’ll describe a more advanced serializer shortly. Next let’s explore a view in  the context of the Django REST framework.  Serializer classes by themselves do nothing and must be integrated with views that do the bulk of the   REST service logic  i.e., handle incoming requests, query a database for data , which then use serializers to  transform data. In the first section in this chapter, you learned how a regular Django view method can be  turned into REST services. While it’s perfectly possible to use a Django REST framework serializer class - like  the one in Listing 12-3 - in a regular Django view method, the Django REST framework also provides an  additional view syntax - illustrated in Listing 12-4 - to make it easier to build REST services.  555   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Listing 12-4.  Django view method decorated with Django REST framework  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.stores.serializers import StoreSerializer  from rest_framework.decorators import api_view from rest_framework.response import Response  @api_view ['GET','POST','DELETE']  def rest_store request :     if request.method == 'GET':         stores = Store.objects.all           serializer = StoreSerializer stores, many=True          return Response serializer.data      elif request.method == 'POST':         ... logic for HTTP POST  operation     elif request.method == 'DELETE':         ... logic for HTTP DELETE operation  First notice the method in Listing 12-4 is a regular Django view method, but it uses the @api_view  decorator from the Django REST framework. The arguments to @api_view indicate which HTTP REST  methods to support - see Chapter 2 or Chapter 6 for details on the topic of HTTP methods in Django or  wikipedia’s REST entry,7 as HTTP methods is a generic REST concept rather than a Django REST topic. Next,  inside the view method, a series of conditions are executed to process the different HTTP request methods  that form the REST service.  If a GET request is made on the view method, a query is made to get all Store model records. However,   notice in this case of Listing 12-4, it uses the StoreSerializer from Listing 12-3 to transform the Django  queryset. In addition, the return statement uses the Django REST framework Response method instead of  Django’s standard HttpResponse or render methods.  More importantly, notice both the request and response logic in Listing 12-4 lacks any kind of REST  output format  e.g., JSON, XML . By leveraging the Django REST framework, you no longer need to deal  with the low-level details of detecting or handling output formats-- this is taken care of directly by the REST  framework and based on how you make requests to the REST service, which I’ll describe shortly.  Next, the rest_store   view method in Listing 12-4 must be configured to become accessible at a url.    A line like url r'^rest $',stores_views.rest_store,name="rest_index"  added to the app’s urls.py  file solves this issue. Once you do this, if you access the URL you’ll see a result like the one in Figure 12-3.  7https:  en.wikipedia.org wiki Hypertext_Transfer_ProtocolRequest_methods  556   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Figure 12-3.  Django REST framework main service response   if you get the error 'TemplateDoesNotExist at  stores rest  rest_framework api.     Caution  html' instead of the page in Figure 12-3, it means you haven’t added the reSt framework to your project’s  INSTALLED_APPS as described at the start of this section  e.g., INSTALLED_APPS = ['rest_framework'] .  As you can see in Figure 12-3, the REST framework service response is very informative and pretty   compared to Django’s basic HttpResponse response generated by the Django REST service created in the  initial section of this chapter.  For example, you can see the different options offered by the REST service and invoke its various   operations in a few clicks. Also notice the output from the REST service only has Store objects with two  fields due to the StoreSerializer definition in Listing 12-3. Next, let’s modify the serializer class to output  complete Store records. Listing 12-5 shows an updated serializer class based on Listing 12-3.  Listing 12-5.  Serializer class using Django model based on Django REST framework  from rest_framework import serializers  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store  class StoreSerializer serializers.ModelSerializer :     class Meta:         model = Store         fields = '__all__'  557   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  In order to serialize full Store records based on a Django Store model, Listing 12-5 makes use of the  Django REST framework ModelSerializer class to simplify the serializer syntax. More importantly, notice  how the REST framework StoreSerializer class in Listing 12-5 uses syntax that’s identical to Django model  forms that are also based on Django models.  In this case, the StoreSerializer class uses a Meta class with the model option set to Store to specify  the Django model to serialize and the fields option set to __all__ to indicate all model fields should be  serialized – note the fields option can equally declare a limited list of model field names, just like it’s done  in model forms.  With this more specialized parent serializer ModelSerializer class in Listing 12-5 – vs. the generic   Serializer class in Listing 12-3 – it’s this simple to serialize Django model classes for REST services using  the Django REST framework.  But as powerful as these Django REST framework serialization features are and as helpful as the Django   REST framework view syntax used in Listing 12-4 is - cutting down on low-level logic and presenting a  user-friendly interface - there’s still a lot of scaffolding code in the view method that can be further trimmed  down.  To further simplify the construction of REST services, the Django REST framework can make use of   class-based views.  Class-Based Views Chapter 2 introduced the concept of Django class-based views and Chapter 8 expanded on the topic with  class-based views that use Django models to perform CRUD operations. Since the principles of class-based  views in Django have already been covered, l’ll assume you have a minimum level of familiarity with the  topic; if not, then go back to these other chapters to learn the basics.  Listing 12-6 illustrates a class-based view based on a REST framework class, which simplifies the earlier   standard view method – in Listing 12-4 – decorated with @api_view from the REST framework.  Listing 12-6.  Django REST framework class-based views  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.stores.serializers import StoreSerializer  from rest_framework.views import APIView from rest_framework.response import Response  class StoreList APIView :      def get self, request, format=None :         stores = Store.objects.all           serializer = StoreSerializer stores, many=True          return Response serializer.data       def post self, request, format=None :         ...         logic for HTTP POST operation      def delete self, request, format=None :         ...         logic for HTTP DELETE operation  558   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Notice in Listing 12-6 how the class inherits its behavior from the Django REST framework APIView   class. This allows the class to contain various methods representing each of the REST service’s HTTP  methods  i.e., GET,POST, DELETE , – similar to how it’s done with standard Django class-based views that  handle multiple HTTP methods  e.g., form processing .  As you can see, Listing 12-6 produces much more readable REST services logic, compared to the   regular Django view method in Listing 12-4, which requires you to manually inspect a request and perform  conditional statements. The logic inside the get method in Listing 12-6 uses the same Django REST  framework syntax used in Listing 12-4, so there’s nothing new.  In the same way you must hook up a regular Django view method to a url, you must also associate a  Django REST framework class-based view to make it accessible on a certain url. Listing 12-7 illustrates a  urls.py file with the syntax to access the REST service class-based view from Listing 12-6.  Listing 12-7.  Django URL definition linked to Django REST framework class-based views  from django.conf.urls import url from coffeehouse.store import stores_views  urlpatterns = [     url r'^$',stores_views.index,name="index" ,     url r'^rest $',stores_views.StoreList.as_view  ,name="rest_index" ,    ]  In Listing 12-7 you can see the urls.py file declares the r'^rest $' url pattern is mapped to the Django   REST framework StoreList class using the as_view   method, which is a staple of all Django class-based  views to link them to a url. In this manner, if an HTTP GET request is made on the  stores rest  url, it’s  handled by the get   method of the class-based view and if an HTTP POST request is made on the same   stores rest , it’s handled by the post   method of the class-based view.  It’s worth mentioning that hitting a url backed by a REST framework class-based view like the one in   Listing 12-6 also produces the same interface shown in Figure 12-3, which is produced by the standard view  method from Listing 12-4.  Now, as helpful as REST framework class-based views are to simplify REST service logic, class- based views still require you to write all of the logic behind each method. For example, in the get    method in Listing 12-6 a query is made to get all Store records, then serialize the data, and finally  return a response. For the post   method in Listing 12-6, you would similarly need to insert update a  Store record with the provided data and with the delete   method you would need to delete a Store  record with the provided data.  Once you write a couple of class-based views with the Django REST framework, you’ll realize there’s a  constant pattern behind each type of view method  e.g., read a record, serialize it, and return a response .  On top of this, you’ll also come to realize what a close relationship there is between REST methods  e.g.,  GET,POST and DELETE  and the operations they execute on Django models  i.e., Create-Read-Update- Delete  CRUD  operations .  To avoid having to constantly write the same CRUD operations and boilerplate logic for different Django   objects associated with REST services, the Django REST framework following Django’s DRY  Don’t Repeat  Yourself  principle and Django’s class-based model view principle offers another construct: mixins.  Mixins and Generic Class-Based Views A mixin is used to encapsulate and reuse the same logic and be able to use it in a class-based view. For  example, instead of writing the same logic from Listing 12-6 - get all records, serialize them, and generate a  response - over and over for different REST services  e.g., Item, Drink, or Store services ; you can use the  mixins.ListModelMixin class and quickly achieve the same result.  559   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  I won’t go into greater detail about mixin classes here, mainly because mixin classes are not as widely   used as other Django REST framework options, not to mention Django mixins were already described in  Chapter 9 in the context of class-based views that use models.  For most Django framework REST services, you’ll either end up using class-based views - to get full control   over the logic - or a more succinct approach based on mixins called ‘mixed-in generic class views’. Listing 12-8  illustrates an equivalent mixed-in generic class view based on the class-based view from Listing 12-6.  Listing 12-8.  Django mixed-in generic class views in Django REST framework  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.stores.serializers import StoreSerializer  from rest_framework import generics  class StoreList generics.ListCreateAPIView :     queryset = Store.objects.all       serializer_class = StoreSerializer  Notice Listing 12-8 is even more succinct than prior iterations of the same REST service. In this case, the   generic class name ListCreateAPIView is indicative of what the class produces - A REST view to generate  a list - based on the queryset option that specifies to get all Store records and the serializer option that  points to the StoreSerializer class in Listing 12-5.  Just as before and even though you now have a REST service composed of a couple of lines, the Django   REST framework can further extend Django’s DRY principle with the use view sets and routers.  View Sets and Routers The generic class view in Listing 12-8 is pretty powerful for just three lines, but it’s just one class to display a  list of Store records. Let’s assume you now need to create a REST service to a display a specific Store record,  another REST service to update a Store record, and yet another REST service to delete Store records. In this  scenario, you would need to create three more generic class views and three more URL mappings to roll out  this basic CRUD functionality. But instead of creating separate view classes for each case, you can instead  rely on a Django REST framework view set.  A Django REST framework view set, as its name implies, is a group of views. To create a Django REST   framework view set all you need to do is create a class that inherits its behavior from one of the Django  REST framework’s classes intended for this purpose. Listing 12-9 illustrates a view set created with the  ModelViewSet class.  Listing 12-9.  Django viewset class in Django REST framework  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.stores.serializers import StoreSerializer  from rest_framework import viewsets  class StoreViewSet viewsets.ModelViewSet :     queryset = Store.objects.all       serializer_class = StoreSerializer  560   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Listing 12-9 is as short as the REST service class in Listing 12-8, but besides the class name change, it’s   the parent ModelViewSet inherited class that gives this REST service a whole new dimension. Using this class  alone, a REST service is automatically hooked up to display a Store record list, as well as to create, read,  update, or delete individual Store records.  Because a view set generates multiple views, you’re still left with the issue of configuring each view to a  url, in which case the easiest path is to use a Django REST framework router. A router is to a view set what a  url statement is to class-based view: a way to hook up an end point. Listing 12-10 illustrates the urls.py file  set up with a Django REST framework router.  Listing 12-10.  Django URL definition with Django REST framework router for view set  from django.conf.urls import include, url from coffeehouse.stores import views as stores_views  from rest_framework import routers  router = routers.DefaultRouter   router.register r'stores', stores_views.StoreViewSet   urlpatterns = [     url r'^rest ', include router.urls,namespace="rest"  ,     ]     Caution   view set and router combinations automatically create sensitive reSt end points  e.g., delete and  update , which by default are accessible to anyone. See the next section on reSt framework security to restrict  these service end points.  The first step in Listing 12-10 is to initiate a router with routers.DefaultRouter   and then register the   different view sets with it. As you can see in Listing 12-10, the router registration process uses the router. register method that accepts two arguments: the first argument indicates the REST url prefix - in this case  stores - and a second argument to specify the view set - in this case the StoreViewSet class from Listing 12-9.  Next, you can see the router is assigned using Django’s standard url and include methods. In this  case, the router instance is assigned under the r'^rest ' url, which means the final root url of the Store  view set becomes  rest stores  as shown in Figure 12-4.  561   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  Figure 12-4.  Django REST framework view set main page  As you can see in Figure 12-4, the REST framework presents a default Api Root page. You can further   navigate to other urls under the Api Root page  i.e.,  stores rest   to perform other CRUD actions  associated with the view set  e.g., an HTTP GET request on  stores rest stores  to get a list of all Store  records, an HTTP GET request on  stores rest stores 1  to get the Store record with id=1, or an HTTP  DELETE request on  stores rest stores 2  to delete the Store record with id=3 .  And with this description of view sets and routers, we conclude the coverage of basic concepts needed   to set up REST services with the Django REST framework. Now that you’re familiar with the basics, in the  next section you’ll learn how to secure REST services built with the Django REST framework.  Django REST Framework Security  Although the Django REST framework represents a great time saver to create REST services that allow access  to an application’s data, you need to be careful you don’t inadvertently allow access to data or functionalities  you didn’t mean to. Using the wrong class or configuration parameter with the Django REST framework can  leave your application open to a security risk, even though the Django REST framework is fundamentally  secure.  Set Up REST Framework Services Permissions By default, all REST framework services are open to anyone, so long as they know or discover a REST service  end point  i.e., the url . While this default behavior is convenient, it can also represent a grave security  threat, particularly if you create REST framework services with sensitive operations  e.g., Update or Delete  actions  or view sets – such as the one in Listing 12-9 – which automatically create end points that support  sensitive operations.  562   The default REST framework permission can be configured through the REST_FRAMEWORK variable in   setting.py file, via the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option. Out of the box, the REST framework sets this  option to use the rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny class, as illustrated in the following snippet:  Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  REST_FRAMEWORK = {     'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES':           'rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny',       }  This means that unless you define a DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option in your Django project’s   settings.py file, all REST framework services are open to the public. To lock down access to REST services  to the public, you can change the REST framework’s default permission strategy.  Listing 12-11 illustrates the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option set to the rest_framework.  permissions.IsAuthenticated class, which enforces that only users logged in via Django’s built-in user  system – described in Chapter 10 – be allowed access to REST framework services.  Listing 12-11.  Django REST framework set to restrict all services to authenticated users  REST_FRAMEWORK = {     'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES':           'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',       }  In addition to the rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated class, the REST framework also   supports the classes in Table 12-1 to be part of the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option.  Table 12-1.  Django REST framework permission classes  REST framework permission class  Description  rest_framework.permissions.AllowAny rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated  rest_framework.permissions.IsAdminUser  rest_framework.permissions. IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly rest_framework.permissions. DjangoModelPermissions  rest_framework.permissions. DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly  rest_framework.permissions. DjangoObjectPermissions   Default  Allows access to anyone. Allows access to logged-in users via Django’s built-in  user system. Allows access to Django admin users, based on Django’s  built-in user system. Allows read access to anyone  logged in or not , but  requires logging in to perform non-read operations. Allows access to logged-in users, but also requires that  said users have the necessary add change delete model  permissions on which the REST service operates with. Just like the DjangoModelPermissions class, but allows  read access to anyone  logged in or not .  Similar to the DjangoModelPermissions class, except it  works per-object permissions on models on which the  REST service operates with.  563   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  As you can see in Table 12-1, the REST framework provides various classes to set the default   access permission for all REST services in a project. For example, if you’re fine allowing public read  access to a project’s REST services but want to restrict more sensitive REST services operations, the  IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly and DjangoModelPermissionsOrAnonReadOnly classes from Table 12-1 are  good alternatives for the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option.  Still, by relying on the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option you give every REST service in a project the   same access permission. What if you want to provide a more flexible or strict permission strategy for one or  two services? The REST framework also supports specifying more granular permissions on individual REST  services, using the same classes in Table 12-1.  Listing 12-12 illustrates a modified version of the REST service from Listing 12-4 that uses @permission_  classes decorator to specify a different permission strategy than the global DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES  option.  Listing 12-12.  Django view method decorated with Django REST framework and @permission_classes  decorator  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.stores.serializers import StoreSerializer  from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated from rest_framework.response import Response  @api_view ['GET','POST','DELETE']  @permission_classes  IsAuthenticated,    def rest_store request :     if request.method == 'GET':         stores = Store.objects.all           serializer = StoreSerializer stores, many=True          return Response serializer.data   As you can see in Listing 12-12, the standard view method in addition to being decorated with    @api_view is also decorated with @permission_classes. In this case, the @permission_classes decorator is  set with the IsAuthenticated class values, ensuring this REST service permission strategy take precedence  on the service over the default service permission in DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option.  Listing 12-13 illustrates a modified version of the REST service from Listing 12-9 that uses permission_ classes field to specify a different permission strategy than the global DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option.  Listing 12-13.  Django viewset class in Django REST framework and permission_classes field  from coffeehouse.stores.models import Store from coffeehouse.stores.serializers import StoreSerializer from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated  from rest_framework import viewsets  class StoreViewSet viewsets.ModelViewSet :     permission_classes =  IsAuthenticated,      queryset = Store.objects.all       serializer_class = StoreSerializer  564   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  As you can see in Listing 12-13, the REST framework view set method makes use of the permission_  classes field. In this case, the permission_classes field is set with the IsAuthenticated class values,  ensuring this REST service permission strategy takes precedence on the service over the default service  permission in DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES option.  Set Up REST Framework Login Page By default, if a user attempts to access a REST framework via a browser and doesn’t have the necessary  permissions, a user is presented with a warning page like the one in Figure 12-5.  Figure 12-5.  Django REST framework access denied page  Although Figure 12-5 represents a standard access denied page, it has one glaring omission: it’s a dead   end with no link to let users log in. If a user reaches the page in Figure 12-5, he needs to manually go to a  Django login page in either the application or the Django admin, to provide his credentials and then go back  to the REST service to access it.  This last workflow creates an unnecessary burden on users, which is why the REST framework provides  an easy way to integrate a login page – including a login logout link on all its pages – that’s tied directly to the  same authentication back end of the Django admin.  Listing 12-14 illustrates a Django project’s main urls.py that declares the REST framework’s urls to   automatically activate its built-in login page and links.  Listing 12-14.  Django REST framework url declaration to enable log in  from django.conf.urls import include, url urlpatterns = [     url r'^rest-auth ', include 'rest_framework.urls',namespace='rest_framework'  , ]  565   Chapter 12   reSt ServiCeS with Django  In Listing 12-14 you can see rest_framework.urls is configured with Django’s standard include     statement and namespace argument, in addition to being configured on the rest-auth  url, the last of which  you can change to any url pattern of your choosing.  With this addition to a Django project’s main urls.py file, all REST framework pages are generated with  a login link in the top right corner, which takes users to a login page accessibly under the login path of the url  configuration  e.g., if url r'^rest-auth ' , the login page is available at  rest-auth login  .  ENHANCED REST FRAMEWORK USER INTERFACE OPTIONS  although the built-in user interface  Ui  provided by the reSt framework – presented in Figures 12-3  through 12-5 – offers a better alternative than presenting raw data reSt services output – like   Figures 12-1 and 12-2 – the reSt framework Ui is still rather rudimentary when you compare it to   more modern Ui web layouts.  there are various alternatives to the reSt framework Ui, which are specifically designed to work with  the reSt framework. Some of the more mature projects include Django reSt Swagger8 and DrF Docs.9  8http:  marcgibbons.github.io django-rest-swagger  9http:  drfdocs.com   566   APPENDIX A  Python Basics  Python, like most programming languages, has certain behaviors that can confuse anyone who is new to the  language. This appendix contains an overview of the Python features that are most important to understand  for anyone who wants to create Django applications and who is already familiar with another programming  language  e.g., Ruby, PHP .  In this appendix you’ll learn about Python strings, Unicode, and other annoying text behaviors; Python   methods and how to use them with default, optional, *args, and **kwargs arguments; Python classes and  subclasses; Python loops, iterators, and generators; Python list comprehensions, generator expressions,  maps, and filters; as well as how to use the Python lambda keyword for anonymous methods.  Strings, Unicode, and Other Annoying Text Behaviors  Working with text is so common in web applications that you’ll eventually be caught by some of the   not-so-straightforward ways Python interprets it. First off, beware there are considerable differences in how  Python 3 and Python 2 work with strings.  Python 3 provides an improvement over Python 2, in the sense there are just two instead of three ways   to interpret strings. But still, it’s important to know what’s going on behind the scenes in both versions so you  don’t get caught off-guard working with text. Listing A-1 illustrates a series of string statements run in Python  2 to showcase this Python version’s text behavior.  Listing A-1.  Python 2 literal unicode and strings  Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import sys >>> sys.getdefaultencoding   'ascii' >>> 'café & pâtisserie' 'caf\xc3\xa9 & p\xc3\xa2tisserie' >>> print '\xc3\xa9'  é >>> print '\xc3\xa2'  â    Daniel Rubio 2017  D. Rubio, Beginning Django, https:  doi.org 10.1007 978-1-4842-2787-9  567   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  The first action in Listing A-1 shows the default Python encoding that corresponds to ASCII and   which is the default for all Python 2.x versions. In theory, this means Python is limited to representing 128  characters, which are the basic letters and characters used by all computers – see any ASCII table for details.1  This is just in theory though, because you won’t get an error when attempting to input a non-ASCII character  in Python.  If you create a string statement with non-ASCII characters like 'café & pâtisserie', you can see in  Listing A-1 the é character is output to \xc3\xa9 and the â character is output to \xc3\xa2. These outputs,  which appear to be gibberish, are actually literal Unicode or UTF-8 representations of the é and â characters,  respectively. So take note that even though the default Python 2 encoding is ASCII, non-ASCII characters are  converted to literal Unicode or UTF-8 representations.  Next in Listing A-1 you can see that using the print   statement on either of these character sequences  outputs the expected é or â characters. Behind the scenes, Python 2 offers the convenience of inputting non- ASCII characters in an ASCII encoding environment, by automatically encoding strings into literal Unicode  or UTF-8 representations. To confirm this behavior, you can use the decode   method, as illustrated in  Listing A-2.  Listing A-2.  Python 2 decode unicode and u” prefixed strings  Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8'   Outputs: u'caf\xe9 & p\xe2tisserie' >>> print u'\xe9'   Outputs: é >>> print u'\xe2'   Outputs: â  In Listing A-2 you can see the statement 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8'  outputs u'caf\xe9   & p\xe2tisserie'. So now the same string decoded from Unicode or UTF-8 converts the é character or \ xc3\xa9 sequence to \xe9 and the â character or \xc3\xa2 sequence to \xe2. More importantly, notice the  output string in Listing A-2 is now preceded by a u to indicate a Unicode or UTF-8 string.  Therefore the é character can really be represented by both \xc3\xa9 and \xe9, it's just that \xc3\xa9   is the literal Unicode or UTF-8 representation and \xe9 is a Unicode or UTF-8 character, representation.  The same case applies for the â character or any other non-ASCII character. The way Python 2 distinguishes  between the two representations is by appending a u to the string. In Listing A-2 you can see calling  print u'\xe9'  - note the preceding u - outputs the expected é and calling print u'\xe2'  outputs the  expected â.  This Python 2 convenience of allowing non-ASCII characters in an ASCII encoding environments works  so long as you don’t try to forcibly convert a non-ASCII string that’s already loaded into Python into ASCII, a  scenario that’s presented in Listing A-3.  Listing A-3.  Python 2 UnicodeEncodeError: ‘ascii’ codec can’t encode character  Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8' .encode 'ascii'   1https:  www.cs.cmu.edu ~pattis 15-1XX common handouts ascii.html  568   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  Traceback  most recent call last :   File " ", line 1, in   UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xe9' in position 3: ordinal not  in range 128   In Listing A-3 you can see the call 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8' .encode 'ascii'  throws   the UnicodeEncodeError error. Here you’re not getting any convenience behavior – like when you input  non-ASCII characters – because you’re trying to process an already Unicode or UTF-8 character  i.e., \xe9  or \xe2  into ASCII, so Python rightfully tells you it doesn’t know how to treat characters that are outside of  ASCII’s 128-character range.  You can, of course, force ASCII output on non-ASCII characters, but you’ll need to pass an additional   argument to the encode   method as illustrated in Listing A-4.  Listing A-4.  Python 2 encode arguments to process Unicode to ASCII  Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8' .encode 'ascii','replace'   Outputs: 'caf? & p?tisserie' >>> 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8' .encode 'ascii','ignore'   Outputs: 'caf & ptisserie' >>> 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8' .encode 'ascii','xmlcharrefreplace'   Outputs: 'caf&233; & p&226;tisserie' >>> 'café & pâtisserie'.decode 'utf-8' .encode 'ascii','backslashreplace'   Outputs: 'caf\\xe9 & p\\xe2tisserie'  As you can see in Listing A-4, you can pass a second argument to the encode   method to handle non-  ASCII characters: the replace argument so the output uses ? for non-ASCII characters; the ignore argument  to simply bypass any non-ASCII positions; the xmlcharrefreplace to output the XML entity representation  of the non-ASCII characters; or the backslashreplace to add a backlash allowing the output of an escaped  non-ASCII reference.  Finally, Listing A-5 illustrates how you can create Unicode strings in Python 2 by prefixing them with the   letter u.  Listing A-5.  Python 2 Unicode strings prefixed with u''  Python 2.7.3  default, Apr 10 2013, 06:20:15  [GCC 4.6.3] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> u'café & pâtisserie' u'caf\xe9 & p\xe2tisserie' >>> print u'caf\xe9 & p\xe2tisserie'  café & pâtisserie  In Listing A-5 you can see the u'café & pâtisserie' statement. By appending the u to the string   you’re telling Python it’s a Unicode or UTF-8 string, so the output for the characters é and â are \xe9 and \ xe2, respectively. And by calling the print statement on the output for this type of string preceded by u, the  output contains the expected é and â letters.  Now let’s explore how Python 3 works with unicode and strings in Listing A-6.  569   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  Listing A-6.  Python 3 unicode and string  Python 3.5.2  default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23  [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> import sys >>> sys.getdefaultencoding   'utf-8' >>> 'café & pâtisserie' 'café & pâtisserie'  As you can see in Listing A-6, the encoding is UTF-8 or Unicode, which is the default for all Python 3.x   versions. By using UTF-8 or Unicode as the default, it makes working with text much simpler. There’s no  need to worry or deal with how special characters are handled; everything is handled as UTF-8 or Unicode.  In addition, because the default is Unicode or UTF-8, the leading u on strings is irrelevant and not supported  in Python 3.  Next, let’s move on to explore the use of Python’s escape character and strings. In Python, the backslash  \ character is Python’s escape character and is used to escape the special meaning of a character and declare  it as a literal value.  For example, to use an apostrophe quote in a string delimited by quotes, you would need to escape the  apostrophe quote so Python doesn’t confuse where the string ends  e.g., 'This is Python\'s "syntax"' .  A more particular case of using Python’s backslash is on those special characters that use a backslash  themselves. Listing A-7 illustrates various strings that use characters composed of a backslash so you can see  this behavior.  Listing A-7.  Python backslash escape character and raw strings  >>> print "In Python this is a tab \t and a line feed is \n"  In Python this is a tab and a line feed is  >>> print "In Python this is a tab \\t and a line feed is \\n"  In Python this is a tab \t and a line feed is \n >>> print r"In Python this is a tab \t and a line feed is \n"  In Python this is a tab \t and a line feed is \n  In the first example in Listing A-7 you can see the \t character is converted to a tab space and the \n   character to a line feed  i.e., newline . This is the actual character composition of a tab - as a backslash  followed by the letter t - and a line feed -- as a backslash followed by the n. As you can see in the second  example in Listing A-7, in order for Python to output the literal value \t or \n you need to add another  backslash - which is after all Python’s escape character.  The third example in Listing A-7 is the same string as the previous ones, but it’s preceded by r to make it  a Python raw string. Notice that even though the special characters \t and \n are not escaped, the output is  like the second example with escaped characters.  This is what’s special about Python raw strings. By preceding a string with r, you tell Python to interpret   backslashes literally, so there’s no need to add another backslash like the second example in Listing A-7.  Python raw strings can be particularly helpful when manipulating strings with a lot of backslashes. And   one particular case of strings that rely a lot on backslashes is regular expressions. Regular expressions are  a facility in almost all programming languages to find, match, or compare strings to patterns, which makes  them useful in a wide array of situations.  570   The crux of using Python and regular expression together is they both give special meaning to   backslashes, a problem that even the Python documentation calls The Backslash Plague.2 Listing A-8  illustrates this concept of the backslash plague and raw strings in the context of Python regular expressions.  APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  Listing A-8.  Python backslash plague and raw strings with regular expressions  >>> import re  Attempt to match liternal '\n',  equal statement: re.match "\\n","\\n"    >>> re.match "\\n",r"\n"   Attempt to match liternal '\n',  equal statement: re.match "\\\\n","\\n"    >>> re.match "\\\\n",r"\n"     Attempt to match liternal '\n',  equal statement: re.match r"\\n","\\n"    >>> re.match r"\\n",r"\n"     In Listing A-8, we’re trying to find a regular expression to match a literal \n - in Python syntax this would  be r"\n" or "\\n". Since regular expressions also use \ as their escape character, the first logical attempt at a  matching regular expression is "\\n", but notice this first attempt in Listing A-8 fails.  Because we’re attempting to define a regular expression in Python, you’ll need to add an additional   backslash for Python and yet another one to escape the regular expression, bringing the total to four  backslashes! As you can see in Listing A-8, the regular expression that matches a literal \n is the second  attempt "\\\\n".  As you can see in this example, dealing with backslashes in Python and in the context of regular   expression can lead to very confusing syntax. To simplify this, the recommended approach to define regular  expressions in Python is to use raw strings so backslashes are interpreted literally. In the last example in  Listing A-8, you can see the regular expression r"\\n" matches a literal \n and is equivalent to the more  confusing regular expression "\\\\n".     Note    Python’s escape character and raw string behavior is the same in both Python 2 and Python 3.  Methods Arguments: Default, optional, *args, and **kwargs  Methods are one of the most common things you’ll create in Python. Declared with the syntax def <method_ name> arguments  and called with the syntax result =   input , what can be tricky to  understand about Python methods is their argument input syntax.  The obvious way you define and call methods is to have the same number of arguments on both sides,   but this is far from most real-world cases where data can be missing or the number of arguments can change  based on the circumstances. Listing A-9 illustrates a basic method definition with multiple calls using  different syntax.  2https:  docs.python.org 3 howto regex.htmlthe-backslash-plague  571   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  Listing A-9.  Python method definition and call syntax with * and **  def address city,state,country :     print city      print state      print country   address 'San Diego','CA','US'  address 'Vancouver','BC','CA'   us_address =  'San Diego','CA','US'  address *us_address   canada_address = {'country':'US','city':'San Diego','state':'CA'} address **canada_address   The address method in Listing A-9 represents the most obvious syntax with three input parameters.   Next, you can see two calls are made to the method also with the also obvious syntax: address 'San  Diego','CA','US'  and address 'Vancouver','BC','CA' . Following these calls are another two calls  made with the not-so-obvious syntax address *us_address  and address **canada_address .  A variable preceded with * is called a positional argument and tells Python to unpack the tuple assigned   to it, which in turn passes each value as an individual argument. A variable preceded with ** is called a  keyword argument and tells Python to unpack the dictionary assigned to it, which in turn passes each value  as an individual argument.  As you can confirm in Listing A-9, the us_address variable is in fact a three-item tuple that is then used   as the input argument in address *us_address . And the canada_address variable is in fact a three-item  dictionary that is then used as the input argument in address **canada_address .  An interesting behavior of the values in ** is they don’t have to follow a strict order  i.e., as expected by  the method . Because these values are classified by keyword in a dictionary, Python can map each keyword  according to the expected method argument order. This is unlike the values in * that need to be in the same  order expected by a method, which is why they’re called positional arguments because position matters.  Another important Python method syntax is making an argument optional. In Listing A-10 the address_  with_default method uses a default argument value for country, which in turn makes it optional.  Listing A-10.  Python method optional arguments  def address_with_default city,state,country='US' :     print city      print state      print country   address_with_default 'San Diego','CA'  address_with_default 'Vancouver','BC','CA'  address_with_default **{'state':'CA','city':'San Diego'}   The first call in Listing A-10 address_with_default 'San Diego','CA'  only provides two input   arguments and the call still works, even though the address_with_default method definition declares three  input arguments. This is because the missing country argument takes the default method value US.  The second call in Listing A-10 address_with_default 'Vancouver','BC','CA'  provides all three  input arguments with the third value effectively overriding the default method value US for CA. Finally, the  third call in Listing A-10 address_with_default **{'state':'CA','city':'San Diego'}  uses the **  syntax to unpack an inline dictionary with two values, and the missing argument country takes the default  method value US.  572   In addition to using the positional * syntax for calling methods, it’s also possible to use this same syntax   to define method arguments, as illustrated in Listing A-11.  APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  Listing A-11.  Python method positional argument  def vowels *args :     print "*args is %s" % type args       print "Arguments %s " % ', '.join args    vowels 'a'  vowels 'a','e'  vowels 'a','e','i'  vowels 'a','e','i','o'  vowels 'a','e','i','o','u'   Notice the method in Listing A-11 def vowels *args  uses the * syntax to define the method    argument. The * character has the same meaning described earlier, which is to unpack the values in a tuple.  In this case, by using it in a method argument, it gives the method the flexibility to accept any number of   arguments. You can confirm this flexibility by seeing the various calls to the vowels   method in Listing A-11,   which take from one to five arguments.  Because you can’t directly reference input arguments with a positional argument - unless you manually  split them - Listing A-12 shows another method that first defines a standard input variable and then declares  a positional argument.  Listing A-12.  Python method with standard and positional argument  def address_with_zipcode zipcode,*args :     print zipcode      print "*args is %s" % type args       print "Arguments %s " % ', '.join args    address_with_zipcode 92101,'100 Park Boulevard','San Diego','CA','US'  address_with_zipcode 'V6B 4Y8','777 Pacific Boulevard','Vancouver','BC','CA'   As you can confirm with the various calls made to address_with_zipcode   in Listing A-12, the first   value is assigned to the first input variable and the rest of the values are assigned to the positional argument.  Listing A-13 illustrates yet another method syntax that uses a keyword argument in the method definition.  Listing A-13.  Python method with keyword argument  def address_catcher **kwargs :     print "**kwargs is %s" % type kwargs       print "Keyword arguments %s " % ', '.join ['%s = %s' %  k,v  for k,v in kwargs.items  ]    address_catcher zipcode=92101,street='100 Park Boulevard',city='San Diego',state='CA',  country='US'  address_catcher postalcode='V6B 4Y8',street='777 Pacific Boulevard',city='Vancouver',  province='BC',country='CA'   Notice the method in Listing A-13 uses the ** syntax to define the method argument. The ** character  has the same meaning described earlier, which is to unpack the values in a dictionary. In this case, by using  it in a method argument, it gives the method the flexibility to accept any number of keyword arguments.  You can confirm this flexibility by seeing the various calls to address_catcher   in Listing A-13, which use  different keys; one call uses zipcode and state, while the other uses postalcode and province.  573   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  a keyword argument.  Finally, Listing A-14 illustrates a method that uses a standard input variable, a positional argument, and   Listing A-14.  Python method with standard, positional and keyword argument  def address_full country,*args,**kwargs :     print country      print "*args is %s" % type args       print "Arguments %s " % ', '.join args       print "**kwargs is %s" % type kwargs        print "Keyword arguments %s " % ', '.join ['%s = %s' %  k,v  for k,v in kwargs.items  ]    address_full 'US','100 Park Boulevard','San Diego',state='CA',zipcode=92101  address_full 'CA','777 Pacific Boulevard','Vancouver',province='BC',postalcode='V6B 4Y8'   If you look over the sample calls to address_full   method in Listing A-14, you’ll see this process  works by assigning input values as the method slots requires. The first input value is always assigned to  the standard input variable country, the next input values up to the first keyword=value are assigned to  the positional argument *args, and all the input values with a keyword=value syntax are assigned to the  keyword argument **kwargs. Be aware the input sequence when you use all three types of input types must  always follow this order to avoid ambiguity.   the * and ** characters are what really matter in Python methods. syntax wise you’re more likely to      Note  encounter the references *args and **kwargs, but what really matters are the * and ** characters. to Python,  you can equally declare *foo and **bar; however, the names *args and **kwargs are so prevalent you’re more  likely to encounter these than custom names.  Classes and Subclasses  Python classes are used to give greater structure and object-orientated facilities to many projects, so it’s  important to have a firm grasp on class behaviors and syntax. Even if you’ve used object-orientated design  in other language like Java or PHP, Python has some particularities that you need to understand. Listing A-15  shows a simple Python class.  Listing A-15.  Python class syntax and behavior  class Drink  :       """ Drink class """       def __init__ self,size :             self.size = size        Used to display object instance       def __str__ self :             return 'Drink: size %s' %  self.size         Helper method for size in ounces       def sizeinoz self :             if self.size == "small":                   return "8 oz"  574   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs              elif self.size == "medium":                   return "12 oz"             elif self.size == "large":                   return "24 oz"             else:                   return "Unknown"  thedrink = Drink "small"  print thedrink  print "thedrink is %s " % thedrink.sizeinoz     The first thing to notice about Listing A-15 is it uses the Python class keyword to declare the start of   a Python class. Next, you can see various class methods that are declared with the same def keyword as  standard Python methods. Notice all the class methods use the self-argument to gain access to the class  object instance, a construct that’s prevalent in almost all Python classes, since Python doesn’t grant access  to the instance transparently in class methods like other object-oriented languages  e.g., in Java you can just  reference this inside a method without it being a method argument .  Now let’s move on the some calls made on the Drink class in Listing A-15. The first call in Listing A-15  Drink "small"  creates an instance of the Drink class. When this call is invoked, Python first triggers the  __init__ method of the class to initialize the instance. Notice the two arguments __init__ self,size . The  self variable represents the instance of the object itself, while the size variable represents an input variable  provided by the instance creator, which in this case is assigned the small value. Inside the __init__ method,  the self.size instance variable is created and assigned the size variable value.  The second call in Listing A-15 print thedrink  outputs the thedrink class instance that prints Drink:   size small. What’s interesting about the output is that it’s generated by the class method __str__, which  as you can see in Listing A-15 returns a string with the value of the size instance variable. If the class didn’t  have a __str__ method definition, the call to print thedrink  would output something like <__main__. Drink object at 0xcfb410>, which is the rather worthless unfriendly in-memory representation of the  instance. This is the purpose of the __str__ method in classes, to output a friendly instance value.  The third call in Listing A-15 print "thedrink is %s " % thedrink.sizeinoz    invokes the   sizeinoz   class method on the instance and outputs a string based on the size instance variable created  by __init__. Notice the sizeinoz self  method declares self - just like __init__ and __str__ - to be able  to access the instance value and perform its logic.  Now that you have a basic understanding of Python classes, let’s explore Python subclasses. Listing A-16   illustrates a subclass created from the Drink class in Listing A-15.  Listing A-16.  Python subclass syntax and behavior  class Coffee Drink :       """ Coffee class """       beans = "arabica"       def __init__ self,*args,**kwargs :             Drink.__init__ self,*args              self.temperature = kwargs['temperature']        Used to display object instance       def __str__ self :              return 'Coffee: beans %s, size %s, temperature %s' %  self.beans,self.size,self.  temperature   thecoffee = Coffee "large",temperature="cold"  print thecoffee  print "thecoffee is %s " % thecoffee.sizeinoz     575   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  Notice the class Coffee Drink  syntax in Listing A-16, which is Python’s inheritance syntax  i.e., Coffee  is a subclass or inherits its behavior from Drink . In addition, notice that besides the subclass having its own  __init__ and methods, it also has the beans class field.  Now let’s create some calls on the Coffee subclass in Listing A-16. The first call in Listing A-16 Coffee   "large",temperature="cold"  creates a Coffee instance that is a subclass of the Drink instance. Notice the  Coffee instance uses the arguments "large",temperature="cold" and in accordance with this pattern, the  __init__ method definition is def __init__ self,*args,**kwargs .  Next is the initialization of the parent class with Drink.__init__ self,*args ; the *args value in this   case is large and matches the __init__ method of the parent Drink class. Followed is the creation of the  self.temperature instance variable, which is assigned the value from kwargs['temperature']  e.g., the  value that corresponds to the key temperature .  The second call in Listing A-16 print thecoffee  outputs the thecoffee class instance which prints   Coffee: beans arabica, size large, temperature cold. Because the Coffee class has its own __str__  method, it’s used to output the object instance - overriding the same method from the parent class - if  there were no such method definition, then Python would look for a __str__ method in the parent class   i.e., Drink  and use that, and if no __str__ method were found, then Python would output the in-memory  representation of the instance.  The third and final call in Listing A-16 print "thecoffee is %s " % thecoffee.sizeinoz    invokes  the sizeinoz   class method on the instance and outputs a string based on the size instance variable. The  interesting bit about this call is it demonstrates object-orientated polymorphism, and the Coffee instance  calls a method in the parent Drink class and works just like if it were a Drink instance.  Loops, Iterators, and Generators  Loops are one of the most common programming constructs. In Python, though, there are a series of subtle  loop behaviors that are essential to grasp in order to understand some of Python’s more advanced features.  First let’s start by exploring the typical for loop syntax applied to a Python string, list, and dictionary, which is  illustrated in Listing A-17.  Listing A-17.  Python implicit iterator behavior  astring = 'coffee' coffee_types = ['Cappuccino','Latte','Macchiato'] address = {'city':'San Diego','state':'CA','country':'US'}   Standard for loop, with implicit iterator for letter in astring:     print letter    Loop with enumerator  counter  for counter,letter in enumerate astring :     print counter,letter    Standard for loop, with implicit iterator for coffee in coffee_types:     print coffee    Loop with enumerator  counter , starting at 1 for counter,coffee in enumerate coffee_types,start=1 :     print counter,coffee   576   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs   Standard for loop, with implicit iterator for key,value in address.items  :     print key,value    Standard for loop, with implicit iterator for address_key in address.keys  :     print address_key    Standard for loop, with implicit iterator for address_value in address.values  :     print address_value   As you can see in Listing A-17, the standard for loop syntax in Python is for   in  .  In each case, the for loop steps through uninterrupted through every   in the  , where the    varies depending on the    e.g., for a string   the   are letters, for a list    the   are list elements .  In addition to the standard for syntax, Listing A-17 also make use of three special methods. The first  one is the built-in Python function enumerate  , which functions as a counter. In the second and fourth  examples you can see the   is wrapped in the enumerate   method, which gives the loop access  access to a counter variable that’s declared alongside the   variable. By default, the enumerate    counter starts at 0 but can be set to start at any number by using the start argument. In addition, Listing A-17  also makes use of the dictionary keys   and items   methods, which extract a list of dictionary keys and  values, respectively.  Although the examples in Listing A-17 are straightforward, there is more going on behind the scenes.  When you create for loops like the ones in Listing A-17 the   on which you’re creating, the loop  actually uses a construct called an iterator. To advance through the  , Python uses the iterator’s  __next__ method to walk through each of the items in the  . Because there’s no syntax related to  the iterator or __next__ method, these for loops are said to use implicit iterators.  Iterators are such an important concept in Python, they’re first-class citizens with built-in support in the   language, just like strings, integers, lists, and dictionaries. In addition, to support iterators, other data types  must implement what’s called the iterator protocol, which is why you can automatically invoke a for loop on  strings, lists, dictionaries, and other data structures without actually seeing an iterator or __next__ method.  To further illustrate the concept of iterators, let’s explore a set of similar examples to the ones in    Listing A-18 but this time with explicit iterators.  Listing A-18.  Python explicit iterator behavior  astring = 'coffee' coffee_types = ['Cappuccino','Latte','Macchiato']   Create explicit iterators astring_iter = iter astring  coffee_types_iter = iter coffee_types    Print iterator types print type astring_iter   print type coffee_types_iter     Call next   to advance over the iterator  In Python 2 next   works the same  e.g. astring_iter.next      In Python 3 __next__   works the same  e.g. astring_iter.__next__      577   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  >>> next astring_iter  'c' >>> next astring_iter  'o' >>> next astring_iter  'f' >>> next astring_iter  'f' >>> next astring_iter  'e' >>> next astring_iter  'e' >>> next astring_iter  Traceback  most recent call last :   File " ", line 1, in   StopIteration   Call next   to advance over the iterator  In Python 2 next   works the same  e.g. coffee_types.next      In Python 3 __next__   works the same  e.g. coffee_types.__next__     >>> next coffee_types_iter  'Cappuccino' >>> next coffee_types_iter  'Latte' >>> next coffee_types_iter  'Macchiato' >>> next coffee_types_iter  Traceback  most recent call last :   File " ", line 1, in   StopIteration  order_numbers = iter [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]   Get order number next order_numbers   Do other stuff next order_numbers   Do other stuff next order_numbers   The first two lines in Listing A-18 declare a string and list. Next, you can see both values are wrapped   with the built-in Python function iter   that’s used to create an explicit iterator. To advance or walk through  an iterator, you use the Python built-in function next   on the iterator reference - or you can also use the  iterator’s next   method in Python 2 or the iterator’s __next__   method in Python 3. As you can see in  Listing A-18, each time next   is called on the iterator reference, it advances to the next item just like a for  loop, until it reaches the end and throws StopIteration when no more items are present.  Now that you’ve seen both implicit and explicit iterators, you might be left wondering what’s the point  of explicit iterators and calling next   to advance each time? The point is that explicit iterators give you the  opportunity to pause and get the next element whenever you want, whereas for loops with implicit iterators  just run through the elements uninterrupted.  578   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  This opportunity to pause and get the next element when you need a powerful feature is best illustrated   with the last example in Listing A-18. You can see at the end of Listing A-18 the order_numbers iterator is a  list of numbers. Next, a call is made to the next   method on the order_numbers iterator to fetch the next  item only when its needed, giving us the ability to continue doing other work in between fetching items. As powerful a concept as pausing an iteration is, the last iterator example in Listing A-18 has some   flaws. First, it’s a long list of values that won’t scale for hundreds or thousands of items, which is problematic  both in terms of hard-coding the values, as well as keeping them in memory. In addition, using the iter    method and declaring everything as a global iterator variable can lead to debugging and scoping issues. A  cleaner and more efficient solution to achieve the same result is to use a generator.  A generator is an iterator embodied as a function. In a standard function - like those described in the  past section - you call the function and it runs uninterrupted until it finds return or reaches the end and  returns None by default. In a generator function - which is simply called generators - you can integrate pauses  into a function so that each time it’s called, it’s a continuation of the previous call. In addition, generators  have the ability to generate values on-demand - which is how they get their name - so they’re much more  efficient when it comes to handling large data ranges.  Listing A-19 illustrates a series of generators and their critical piece, which is Python’s yield keyword.  Listing A-19.  Python generator behavior  def funky_order_numbers  :     yield 100     yield 350     yield 575     yield 700     yield 950  order_numbers = funky_order_numbers   print type order_numbers    Call next   to advance over the generator  In Python 2 next   works the same  e.g. order_numbers.next      In Python 3 __next__   works the same  e.g. order_numbers.__next__     >>> next order_numbers  100 ... ... >>> next order_numbers  950 >>> next order_numbers  Traceback  most recent call last :   File " ", line 1, in   StopIteration  def generate_order_numbers n :     for i in range 1,n :         yield i  regular_order_numbers = generate_order_numbers 100   Call next   to advance over the generator  In Python 2 next   works the same  e.g. regular_order_numbers.next      In Python 3 __next__   works the same  e.g. regular_order_numbers.__next__      579   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  >>> next regular_order_numbers  1 ... ... >>> next regular_order_numbers  99 >>> next regular_order_numbers  Traceback  most recent call last :   File " ", line 1, in   StopIteration  def generate_infinite_order_numbers n :     while True:           n += 1           yield n  infinite_order_numbers = generate_infinite_order_numbers 1000    Call next   to advance over the generator  In Python 2 next   works the same  e.g. infinite_order_numbers.next      In Python 3 __next__   works the same  e.g. infinite_order_numbers.__next__     >>> next infinite_order_numbers  1001 ... ...  next   never reaches end due to infinite 'while True:' statement  The first generator in Listing A-19 funky_order_numbers   is unconventional in trying to illustrate the   use of yield, which is a combination of return and stop behavior. Once you assign a generator to a reference,  you can start stepping through the generator with Python’s built-in function next   - or you can also use the  generator’s next   method in Python 2 or the generator’s __next__   method in Python 3.  The first time a next   call is made, the generator gets to yield 100, where it returns 100 and stops until   next   is called again. On the second next   call the generator gets to yield 350, it returns 350, and stops  until next   is called again. This process goes on until the last yield statement is reached and Python return  StopIteration - just like it does with iterators.  Using multiple yield statements and hard-coding values in a generator is rarely done, so the second   generator in Listing A-19 gives more justice to the name generator. The generator generate_order_ numbers n  accepts an input number and then creates a loop from 1 to n, where each iteration returns yield  i, where i is the iteration number.  As you can see in Listing A-19, the first step is to assign the generator to a reference by initializing it with   a number. Once the assignment is made, you walk through the generator calling the next   method and  each time it returns the current counter until you reach the initialization number. An interesting behavior of  generators is they generate their return values on-demand, so in this case even if you initialize the generator  with a large number, say 10000000, the generator doesn’t create a 10000000 element list that takes up  memory, it generates and returns values as they’re needed.  The third generator in Listing A-19 generate_infinite_order_numbers   is designed to never end.   The generator generate_infinite_order_numbers n  accepts an input number and then creates an infinite  loop to return yield n+i on each iteration. In the same way as the other generators, you call the next    method on the reference and each time it returns a subsequent value. Because of the while True: statement  that represents an infinite loop, this generator never ends and thus never returns StopIteration.  580   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  List Comprehensions, Generator Expressions, Maps, and  Filters  List comprehensions offer a concise way to express Python operations that involve lists. Although you can  express the same logic using standard for loops and if else conditionals, there’s a high probability you’ll  eventually encounter or use a list comprehension because of its compact nature. Listing A-20 illustrates a  series of list comprehensions, as well as their equivalent standard syntax representation.  Listing A-20.  Python list comprehensions  country_codes = ['us','ca','mx','fr','ru'] zipcodes = {90003:'Los Angeles',90802:'Long Beach',91501:'Burbank',92101:'San  Diego',92139:'San Diego',90071:'Los Angeles'}   Regular syntax country_codes_upper_std = [] for country_code in country_codes:     country_codes_upper_std.append country_code.upper      Equivalent ist comprehension country_codes_upper_comp = [cc.upper   for cc in country_codes]   Regular syntax zip_codes = [] for zipcode in zipcodes.keys  :     zip_codes.append zipcode    Equivalent ist comprehension zip_codes_comp = [zc for zc in zipcodes.keys  ]   Regular syntax zip_codes_la = [] for zipcode,city in zipcodes.items  :     if city == "Los Angeles":         zip_codes_la.append zipcode    Regular syntax one_to_onehundred = [] for i in range 1,101 :     one_to_onehundred.append i    Equivalent  list comprehension one_to_onehundred_comp = [i for i in range 1,101 ]   Equivalent list comprehension zip_codes_la_comp = [zc for zc,city in zipcodes.items   if city == "Los Angeles"]  As you can see in Listing A-20, the syntax for list comprehensions is [  for item in   container  ]. At first you’ll need some time to get accustomed to the syntax, but  eventually you’ll find yourself using it regularly because it takes less time to write than equivalent regular  code blocks.  581   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs  The last example in Listing A-20 produces a list with the numbers 1 to 100, and it’s an interesting   example because it’s an inefficient approach for most cases that require a number series. In the past section,  you learned how generators can create on-demand sequences requiring little memory vs. ordinary lists that  require more memory to store data. While you could use the generator syntax from the previous section,  Python also has a shorthanded notation for generators named generator expressions, which is illustrated in  Listing A-21.  Listing A-21.  Python generator expressions  one_to_onehundred_genexpression =  i for i in range 1,101   print type one_to_onehundred_genexpression   one_to_onehundred_genexpression.next   one_to_onehundred_genexpression.next    first_fifty_even_numbers =  i for i in range 2, 101, 2   first_fifty_even_numbers.next   first_fifty_even_numbers.next    first_fifty_odd_numbers =  i for i in range 1, 101, 2   first_fifty_odd_numbers.next   first_fifty_odd_numbers.next    As you can see in Listing A-21, the syntax is almost identical to list comprehensions; the only difference   is generator expressions use parentheses    as delimiters, instead of brackets []. Once you create a  generator expression, you simply call the next   method on its reference to get the next element in the  generator.  As helpful as list comprehensions are at reducing the amount of written code, there are two other   Python constructs that operate like list comprehensions and are helpful for cutting down even more code or  for cases where the logic for list comprehensions is too complex to make them understandable.  The map   function can apply a function to all the elements of a container and the filter   function   produces a new container with elements that fit certain criteria. Listing A-22 presents some of the list  comprehension from Listing A-20 with the map   and filter   functions.  Listing A-22.  Python map   and filter   examples  country_codes = ['us','ca','mx','fr','ru'] zipcodes = {90003:'Los Angeles',90802:'Long Beach',91501:'Burbank',92101:'San  Diego',92139:'San Diego',90071:'Los Angeles'}   List comprehension country_codes_upper_comp = [cc.upper   for cc in country_codes]   Helper function def country_to_upper name :     return name.upper     Map function country_codes_upper_map = map country_to_upper,country_codes    List comprehension zip_codes_la_comp = [zc for zc,city in zipcodes.items   if city == "Los Angeles"]  582   APPENDIX A   PythoN BAsIcs   Helper function def only_la dict_item :     if dict_item[1] == "Los Angeles":        return True   Filter function zip_codes_la_filter_dict_items = filter only_la,zipcodes.items    print zip_codes_la_filter_dict_items  zip_codes_la_filter = [tup[0] for tup in zip_codes_la_filter_dict_items]  As you can see in Listing A-22, the syntax for the map   function is map  ,     . This technique helps keep a cleaner design, maintaining the logic in a separate method  and the invocation of said method on every element contained in the map   method itself. The map    function produces the same type of input container, but with each of its elements altered by its first  argument or logic method.  The syntax for filter   is filter  ,  . In Listing A-22  you can see the container is a dictionary and the only_la   helper function is used to evaluate each container  element and return True if the second tuple value  i.e., the dictionary value  is "Los Angeles."  Unlike the map   function that uses the results of its logic method, the filter   function only checks   for True or False values. If the logic method on a container element evaluates to True, the element becomes  part of the new container as is  i.e., in this case the dictionary item , if the logic method on a container  element evaluates to False then the element is discarded. Finally, in Listing A-22 you can see that because  the filter   function returns dictionary items, an additional list comprehension is made to get the desired  key values  i.e., zip codes  as a list.  Lambda Keyword for Anonymous Methods  Python uses the lambda keyword to define inline or anonymous methods. It's mostly used when you want  method behavior  e.g., input variables and scope protection  but want to avoid declaring a full-fledged  method with def because the logic is too simple; want to minimize written code; or want to keep the logic in  a single location.  Similar to list comprehensions that are not essential but are widely used to simplify iteration logic, the  lambda keyword is also not essential but is widely used to incorporate method-like behavior with a simpler  syntax. To get accustomed to the lambda keyword, when you see a statement like lambda x:    just make the mental transformation to def anon_method x :  . Listing A-23 illustrates various lambda examples based on past examples.  Listing A-23.  Python lambda examples  country_codes = ['us','ca','mx','fr','ru'] zipcodes = {90003:'Los Angeles',90802:'Long Beach',91501:'Burbank',92101:'San  Diego',92139:'San Diego',90071:'Los Angeles'}   Map function with lambda country_codes_upper_map = map lambda x: x.upper  ,country_codes    Filter function with lambda zip_codes_la_filter_lambda_dict_items = filter lambda  zipcode,city : city == "Los  Angeles",zipcodes.items    print zip_codes_la_filter_lambda_dict_items  zip_codes_la_filter = [tup[0] for tup in zip_codes_la_filter_lambda_dict_items]  583   Index   A, B A B testing techniques, 33 Accelerated Mobile Pages  AMP , 549 admin management  actions, links and positions, 527  get_absolute_url   method, 529 save_as  Clone  option, 528 save_on_top option, 528  admin.py file, 495 changelist_view   method, 542 CRUD permissions, 543 delete_view   method, 542 forms, 520  CharField field display, 526 fieldsets option, 524 fields option, 520 formfield_overrides option, 525 readonly_fields option, 522–523 wrapped fields, 521  global values, 536 models, 495 page layout, 538 read record options, 496  action menu, 514 admin_order_field and ordering, 502 date_hierarchy, 512 dual filter, 511 empty_value_display option, 501 format_html method, 500 inline edit and links, 503 list_display_links option, 504 list_display option, 498 list_editable option, 505 list page, 497 list_per_page option, 506 model __str__ definition, 497 pagination, 506 search option, 507  relationships, 529  admin_order_field option, 516 admin.RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter, 517  edit delete model record, 520 filter_horizontal option, 530 filter_vertical option, 530 ForeignKey field, 516 horizontal radio_fields option, 532 inlines option, 533–535 list_display option, 515 ManyToManyField field, 516 model record creation, 519 radio_fields option, 531 raw_id_fields option, 533 RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter, 518 RelatedOnlyFieldListFilterDjango, 518 search_fields and list_filter, 517 select list, 531 StackedInline class, 535 TabularInline class, 534 vertical radio_fields option, 532  sites, 545  configuration and installation, 25 database CRUD, 25 doc home page, 28 home page, 27 interface, 26 login page, 26  static resources, 540  Application management  application  debugsqlshell, 206 manage.py shell, 204 pdb, 206 toolbar, 204  email  see Email service  extensions  interactive console, 209 runserver_plus and runprofileserver, 208–209 SnakeViz cProfile image, 210  logging  see Logging option  management commands  add_arguments   method, 213 automation, 215    Daniel Rubio 2017  D.

Discover the Django web application framework and get started building Python-based web applications. This book takes you from the basics of Django all the way through to cutting-edge topics such as creating RESTful applications. Beginning Django also covers ancillary, but essential, development topics, including configuration settings, static resource management, logging, debugging, and email. Along with material on data access with SQL queries, you’ll have all you need to get up and running with Django 1.11 LTS, which is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3. Once you’ve built your web application, you’ll need to be the admin, so the next part of the book covers how to enforce permission management with users and groups. This technique allows you to restrict access to URLs and content, giving you total control of your data. In addition, you’ll work with and customize the Django admin site, which provides access to a Django project’s data. After reading and using this book, you’ll be able to build a Django application top to bottom and be ready to move on to more advanced or complex Django application development.
