These technologies are not completely new, but there has been so much growth  around this programming model that it can be difficult to find your bearings when  trying to create a new website. It seems like every popular website has a different,  special trick in rendering attractive layouts or in creating responsive and dynamic  experiences. A beginner can feel hopeless in trying to learn how to program like this.  Fortunately, many JavaScript libraries have arisen to meet this intense demand.   Most of these libraries enable client-side functionality through special shortcuts   so that a developer can utilize very powerful functionality without writing, or even  understanding, complicated JavaScript code. The jQuery libraries are a very good  example of this; they provide rich functionality and UI controls with only a few lines  of code, hiding the complicated programming underneath.  Telerik has taken this model one step further. They have built a powerful JavaScript  framework called Kendo UI that is built on top of jQuery, but can create complete  widgets with even simpler code. Not only this, it also includes server-side code  libraries that enable developers to create widgets on the server, and all JavaScript is  generated automatically! This is an enormous productivity boost, and enables both  experienced web developers and beginners to operate on the same playing field. This  book will take you on an initial journey through the Kendo UI Framework and show  you how to create an entire set of useful and powerful widgets that will make your  web pages shine like the best sites on the Internet.  What this book covers Chapter 1, Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, and Grid, teaches the  foundation of the Kendo UI DataSource and Template JavaScript objects. Learn the  basics of these tools and the most important widget of all—the Grid. These concepts  will form the basis for all of your creations with the Kendo UI framework.   Preface  Chapter 2, The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage, shows how to use Kendo UI to create   a word wheel, or auto-complete, effect on a textbox so that word suggestions appear   as the user types. Learn how to use this widget and how to connect it to different   data sources. Chapter 3, Using and Customizing Calendar, shows how to create a full-featured  calendar control on a web page with very little required code. Learn how to use   the Kendo UI framework to customize this widget to tailor it to your needs. Chapter 4, The Kendo MVVM Framework, introduces you to Model-View-ViewModel   MVVM  development with Kendo UI. JavaScript MVVM frameworks are powerful  systems that allow you to bind dynamic data to web pages through declaring HTML  attributes. These systems can be complicated, but the Kendo UI MVVM framework is  as easy as this can get. Learn how to use this to enable powerful dynamic web pages. Chapter 5, HTML Editor and Custom Tools, demonstrates the Kendo UI Editor widget.  This HTML editor widget allows you to give users a useful area to format text input  with styles and layout. This is a perfect feature for blogs, forums, and review sites.  Learn how to use and customize this widget for your own web pages. Chapter 6, Menu and ListView, introduces you to the Menu and ListView widgets   from Kendo UI so you can effectively format and display data on your web pages.  The Menu widget creates a dynamic menu that opens with hover effects and allows  for custom animation and behaviors. The ListView is a very flexible widget that  allows you to format and template data however you like. Learn how to use these  widgets to display data on your own pages. Chapter 7, Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip, illustrates how to build accordion  controls and tabs on your web pages. Accordion controls provide a useful way to  include a lot of content on a page without making the page grow in size. It can show  only a single section of content at a time while still providing instant access to the  rest. Tabs are very useful for creating navigation bars on a page that show what  other areas of your site that a user can visit. You will learn how to create accordion  controls with the PanelBar widget and how to create tabs using the TabStrip widget.  See how using these widgets can make your web pages look better. Chapter 8, Slider Essentials, will teach you how to use the Kendo UI Slider widgets  to display number ranges with an attractive twist. This widget is a very convenient  method of collecting numerical input from web forms with graphical bars that can  slide and move in steps. Learn how to add these widgets to your web pages to make  your web forms really shine.  [ 2 ]   Preface  Chapter 9, Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets, will illustrate how to lay out  resizable content areas on your web pages and how to visualize hierarchical data  with a simple widget. The Splitter widget helps organize web pages into resizable  zones. The TreeView widget creates dynamic displays for hierarchical data. Learn  how to create these widgets and connect them to data sources. Chapter 10, The Upload and Window Widgets, provides instructions on how to build  powerful file upload pages and interactive dialog boxes into your web site. The  Upload widget creates a powerful file upload utility that works with AJAX and even  allows drag-and-drop functionality. The Window widget creates modal dialog boxes  that make areas of your web pages appear when necessary on top of other content.  Learn how to make these widgets and add them to your pages. Chapter 11, Web API Examples, takes what you have learned about the Kendo UI  widgets and introduces you into a more advanced area of development using the  ASP.NET Web API framework. Web API provides a powerful server-side backend  for your Kendo UI widgets and opens up the possibilities for creative custom  development. Learn how to manage this technology in your own web applications  with ASP.NET MVC.  What you need for this book To complete the examples in this book, you will first need Visual Studio 2012. You  can download a free trial of Visual Studio from www.microsoft.com visualstudio  if you do not already have it installed. You will also need the Kendo UI Complete  for ASP.NET MVC install package from Telerik which you can get at http:  www. kendoui.com download.aspx.   Who this book is for This book is designed for beginner web developers, who are starting to learn how to  utilize JavaScript libraries to create rich and interactive web applications. The user  should be familiar with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Some knowledge of ASP.NET  MVC is helpful, but not required.  Conventions In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between  different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an  explanation of their meaning.  [ 3 ]   Preface  Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions,  pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:   "The both tick placement option will place the tick marks on both sides of a slider."  A block of code is set as follows:        stateOrTerritory {       width:200px;     }     AutoCompletePage        When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the  relevant lines or items are set in bold:  new StateTerritory{ Name = "Washington", IsContiguous = true, IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "West Virginia", IsContiguous = true, IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "Wisconsin", IsContiguous = true, IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "Wyoming", IsContiguous = true,  IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }  New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen,  in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Notice that the  content of the Kendo UI Window widget is not yet shown, it must first be activated  through an event; in this case that event is clicking on the Show Window button."  Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.  Tips and tricks appear like this.  [ 4 ]   Preface  Reader feedback Feedback from our readers is always welcome.

[ 6 ]   Interacting with Data:  DataSource, Templates,  TabStrip, and Grid  Today is an exciting time to be a web developer. Web browsers and web standards  have matured to the point that today's programmer has rich frameworks available to  boost productivity and to reach wide audiences with less code and fewer headaches.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have converged into a powerful and coherent unit  that allows web applications to be both aesthetically and architecturally beautiful  and elegant. Kendo UI, from Telerik, is a modern framework that embraces  these advances and provides a set of tools to enable rich web development and  configurable widgets, all with a familiar and accessible syntax.  Along these same lines, development tools have been improving as well and  Visual Studio 2012 from Microsoft is a good example. JavaScript is now a first-class  citizen in the Microsoft world and there are many improvements for JavaScript  development in the IDE, along with improved support for HTML5 and CSS3. This  is largely to support a new programming model in Windows 8 that allows web  developers to take their skills to the Windows 8 desktop, but these improvements  also directly benefit ASP.NET development —especially ASP.NET MVC. This is the  programming environment that we will use throughout this book to demonstrate  and learn the Kendo UI framework for the web.   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  Setting up the sample project Kendo UI for web development is a client-side, jQuery-powered JavaScript  framework that is not dependent on any specific server technology or platform.  This means that you can type and run the client-side examples in this book using  your choice of tools and debugging testing environment. However, Telerik has  also released a great set of server-side extensions for the Microsoft ASP.NET MVC  framework that can significantly boost productivity. To take advantage of both of  these models, I will be using Visual Studio 2012 and the ASP.NET MVC 4 project  template for all my demonstrations and I invite you to follow along with me. Visual  Studio 2012 Express is a freely available download from http:  www.microsoft. com visualstudio eng products visual-studio-overview, if you do not  already have it installed.  Rather download completed samples? The samples that are displayed in this book are available for download  and you can start from the completed code if you do not want to follow  all of the steps of setting it up yourself.  Once you have Visual Studio 2012 installed, click on New Project either from the  Start page or from the File menu. Then choose ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application  from the Web group of project choices. As you can see from the following  screenshot, I have named my project LearningKendoUIWeb:  [ 8 ]   Select this and click on OK. The next window will display some selections for the  type of template you want to use. I chose the basic template, but you can choose any  of the templates other than the empty template in order to follow along with the  examples. You do not need to create a unit test project for the purposes of this book.  Chapter 1  Downloading the example code You can download the example code files for all Packt books you  have purchased from your account at  http:  www.packtpub. com . If you purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit  http:   www.packtpub.com support and register to have the files  e-mailed directly to you.  [ 9 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  Visual Studio will create the folder structure for your new project, and will copy  all of the necessary files into that structure so that you can run your project in the  debugger. Once this is complete, you will see your project tree in the Solution  Explorer section of the Visual Studio IDE.  Now that we have our structure, it is time to download the Telerik Kendo UI files  and place them in their proper location. Navigate to the Telerik Kendo UI website  at http:  www.kendoui.com download.aspx and download the 30-day free trial  of the Kendo UI Complete package that includes the server wrappers for ASP.NET  MVC. It will arrive as a ZIP file containing everything that you need for development  with Kendo UI. Extract the contents of the ZIP file somewhere you will remember  since you will need to reference these files throughout the rest of the book. This  screenshot shows what the ZIP file should contain:  Now, follow these steps:  1.  Go back to Visual Studio and right-click on the Content folder in the Solution   Explorer and choose Add, New Folder. Name the new folder kendo.   [ 10 ]   Chapter 1  2.  Right-click on the kendo folder that you just created and create two more  folders—Default and textures. Now, right-click on the Default folder   and choose Add, Existing Item. In the file dialog that displays, navigate to the folder with the unzipped Kendo  files, then open the Styles folder and then the Default folder inside it.  3.   4.  Select all of the files in this folder and click on the Add button. This will add  all of these items to the Visual Studio project so that they show in Solution  Explorer and can be managed from the Visual Studio IDE.  5.  Next, follow these same steps to add all of the items to the textures folder.  Once you have these files in place, right click on the kendo folder in Solution  Explorer again and choose Add, Existing Item.  In the dialog that displays, choose these two specific files from the Styles folder   of the unzipped kendo files and add them as well:     kendo.common.min.css    kendo.default.min.css  Once these two files appear in Solution Explorer, rename them by removing the .min  portion of their file names  kendo.default.min.css becomes kendo.default.css ;  this will be explained in greater detail in next few paragraphs. The Content folder in  Solution Explorer should look something like this when you are finished:  [ 11 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  Next, we will prepare the Scripts folder by following some very similar steps.  Create a kendo folder inside of the Scripts folder in Solution Explorer and then  copy these files from the js folder of the downloaded Kendo files:     jquery.min.css    kendo.all.min.js    kendo.aspnetmvc.min.jskendo.web.min.js  Once again, remove the .min portion of their filenames. We will, however, need two  versions of the kendo.aspnetmvc.js file as will be explained later. Go ahead and copy  the file, but only remove the  .min  portion of the filename from one  copy. This way you will have one copy of the file with a .min filename and another  copy of the file without the .min file name. The completed kendo folder in Solution  Explorer should look something like this:  As a web developer, you are surely familiar with the exercise of referencing scripts  and styles in the head portion of your web pages. ASP.NET MVC 4 comes with a  great feature that enables bundling and minimization of these scripts, along with  built-in caching, so that the browser can download these files faster and thereby  increase the performance of your site with very little effort on your part. This  feature also works with CDN locations, so that you can run with local files during  debugging and still reference CDN hosted scripts or style sheets when your site  is deployed. To enable this functionality for our sample project, you will need to  add the following code to the BundleConfig.cs file in the App_Start folder of the  project. First, add this code at the top of the file to enable CDN functionality and to  save the paths of the CDN locations that we want to use:     Enable CDN bundles.UseCdn = true;     CDN paths for kendo stylesheet files var kendoCommonCssPath = "http:  cdn.kendostatic.com 2013.1.319  styles kendo.common.min.css"; var kendoDefaultCssPath = "http:  cdn.kendostatic.com 2013.1.319  styles kendo.default.min.css";  [ 12 ]   Chapter 1     CDN paths for kendo javascript files var kendoWebJsPath = "http:  cdn.kendostatic.com 2012.2.710 js kendo. web.min.js";  Then, add this code at the bottom of the file to create the bundles for your Kendo  files. By passing the CDN location as the second parameter of the ScriptBundle  constructor, Visual Studio will build your solution using your local files when  debugging and will build your solution using the CDN location files when building  in release mode. This is also where I should explain why we removed the .min  portion of the JavaScript and stylesheet filenames. The bundling and minification  features of ASP.NET MVC intentionally ignore files that include .min in their  filenames during debugging. This means that none of your script references from  the Kendo download will work during debugging because we do not have the pre- minified files included in our project. There are several documented ways to deal  with this problem floating around the Internet, but the easiest way to address this for  our project is just to rename to files to avoid the entire issue.     Create the CDN bundles for kendo javascript files bundles.Add new ScriptBundle "~ bundles kendo web js", kendoWebJsPath  .Include "~ Scripts kendo kendo.web.js"  ;    The ASP.NET MVC script file is not available from the Kendo Static  CDN,    so we will include the bundle reference without the CDN path. bundles.Add new ScriptBundle "~ bundles kendo mvc js"  .Include "~ Scripts kendo kendo.aspnetmvc.js"  ;     Create the CDN bundles for the kendo styleshseet files bundles.Add new StyleBundle "~ bundles kendo common css",  kendoCommonCssPath      .Include "~ Content kendo kendo.common.css"  ; bundles.Add new StyleBundle "~ bundles kendo default css",  kendoDefaultCssPath      .Include "~ Content kendo kendo.default.css"  ;  Now that we have the BundleConfig.cs file properly configured, we can adjust the  references in the head portion of our _Layout.cshtml file. The _Layout.cshtml  file acts as our default master page by creating a uniform head structure for all of  our pages and a default layout within which all the other pages place their specific  content. Open the _Layout.cshtml file in the Views, Shared folder and make some  changes. By default, it will have some script references that appear in the body  portion of the page and some that appear in the head portion.   [ 13 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  There are undoubtedly some good reasons for doing this, but since we will have  references to Kendo scripts in the body of our page before these script references  would appear, we need to move everything to the head portion. Since this file is   not very long, I have included my finished version here so that you can copy it:  @using Kendo.Mvc.UI;            @ViewBag.Title  @Styles.Render "~ Content css"  @Styles.Render "~ bundles kendo common css"  @Styles.Render "~ bundles kendo default css"  @Scripts.Render "~ bundles jquery"  @Scripts.Render "~ bundles kendo web js"  @Scripts.Render "~ bundles kendo mvc js"      @RenderBody    @RenderSection "scripts", required: false       Note also that I have added an @using statement at the top of the file, make sure you  copy that as well since it will enable Intellisense on all of your pages. Intellisense  is a feature of Visual Studio that auto-completes code as you write and is a great  productivity booster. To fully enable this, you will also need to add a reference to   the Kendo.Mvc.dll file to your Visual Studio project:  1.  First, right-click on the LearningKendoUIWeb project in the Visual Studio   Solution Explorer and choose Add Reference.  [ 14 ]   Chapter 1  2.  Next, click on Browse and navigate the file dialog to the location where you   downloaded the Kendo files.  3.  Find the folder named aspnetmvc, open the folder named Binaries inside it,   and then open the folder named Mvc3 inside that.   4.  Here you will find the Kendo.Mvc.dll file; click on it and choose Add.  5.  With this reference added, you can make the code inside it available to all    of your web pages by adding a special entry in a file called web.config.   [ 15 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  6.  This file is located in the root of your LearningKendoUIWeb project. Open  web.config and locate the section called namespaces. Add the Kendo.Web. UI namespace to the list like this:                                          Now create a folder to hold static content in the project. Right-click the project name  in Solution Explorer, choose Add, New Folder. Call the new folder static. This will  be the location where we place all of our client-side examples that run apart from the  MVC framework.  Visual Studio 2012 includes some good improvements in JavaScript Intellisense and  it is going to help us as we write our code. Open the file called "_references.js"  in the scripts folder and delete all of the text in it. This is the entire contents of my  "_references.js" file, copy this into yours as well:                     Visual Studio 2012 uses this file as the list of JavaScript libraries that it should use  for Intellisense in the editor. I have included the jQuery file included with the Kendo  zipped package and two JavaScript files that we will be using in the majority of  our web pages. Once you have this in place, you will get some very helpful coding  assistance in your JavaScript files like this:  [ 16 ]   Chapter 1  Notice how all of the Kendo options show up as you type JavaScript code in the  editor? As you program the examples throughout this book, this will become  something that you will help you.  OK, now we are ready!  KendoUI syntax styles When using the KendoUI framework in your web pages, you will find that there are  two ways to add the widgets to your content. The standard method is to use a jQuery  syntax within script elements like this:          $ "makeMeADatePicker" .kendoDatePicker  ;    The convention, as shown, is to select the elements through jQuery and then apply  a JavaScript method from the Kendo namespaces that alters the content into an  interactive Kendo UI widget.  There is another way, now available through HTML5, to add Kendo UI widgets  to your content through a method known as declarative initialization. This is a  practice where you typically add special attributes to your elements that start with  "data-" and then call an initializer that reads these attributes and then applies the  appropriate changes. See this code as an example:      kendo.init $ "makeMeADatePicker"  ;    [ 17 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  This type of syntax allows for a cleaner separation between JavaScript and mark-up,  and is important in the MVVM pattern that we will cover later in the book. It is also  powerfully expressive and can make the code more readable, since relevant attributes  are contained directly within the elements to which they pertain. Script blocks  containing code do not necessarily appear beside the code actually being affected,  which can make things difficult to trace in a complicated project.  Kendo UI MVC – basics Since we will be using ASP.NET MVC quite a bit in this book, I should define some  important terms so that there isn't any confusion later. MVC stands for Model-View- Controller; so let's establish a common terminology around these. First, a web page  is referred to as a view and, when using Razor syntax with C, the web pages have a  file extension, cshtml. There is also the option of using Visual Basic in which case the  web pages have a file extension, vbhtml, but we will be using C in this book so you  won't see this in the examples.  Second, the controller is a server-side classfile that is responsible for all of the logic  used in generating the content included in a web page  view . The controller, along  with the route table, is also responsible for establishing the publicly accessible URLs  to which the server will respond, and enforcing which HTTP verbs are required  to access them. In general, a controller is responsible for contacting any external  dependencies, such as a database or web server, performing any necessary logic  and calculations on the data retrieved from those external dependencies, and then  packaging up all of that processed data into an object called the model.  The model, then, is an object container that contains the data that the web page   view  needs in order to display itself. In a properly separated system, the controller  is the engine that performs all logic, data manipulation, user-input handling,  authorization, and security. The view is the data presenter and is concerned only  with the graphical representation of the data it has been given; no logic apart from  what is required for presentation  not to say that presentation can't be complex .   The model is the standard data format that the controller uses to send its final  product to the view to be presented to the user.  When programming in the ASP.NET MVC environment, Kendo UI offers a rich set  of server-side extensions for creating its widgets. Instead of typing out an HTML  element, specifying its attributes and wiring it up to Kendo UI JavaScript, the entire  process can be done using server-side objects that appear in the view. For example,  creating a DatePicker widget in MVC Razor syntax looks like this:  @ Html.Kendo  .DatePicker  .Name "datePickerField"    [ 18 ]   Chapter 1  No HTML, no JavaScript, just extension methods on the HTML class. When the page  is generated, however, you can see what was sent to the browser:  <input class="k-input" id="datePicker" name="datePicker" type="date"   >   jQuery function  {jQuery "datePicker" .kendoDatePicker {format:"M d  yyyy", min:new Date 1900,0,1,0,0,0,0 ,max:new Date 2099,11,31,0,0,0,0 } ;} ;    The extension methods create all the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS information  dynamically. You can see how the final output uses the jQuery method of selecting  the input element and using .kendoDatePicker …  to create the widget through  JavaScript. So, although the programmer didn't type out the JavaScript, it was still  necessary for Kendo UI to work; the MVC extensions are only wrappers around the  normal Kendo UI client-side framework.  I should also explain that even though the view is what generates the final web  page sent to the user's browser, it is processed on the server first. The Razor syntax   everything that starts with @  never appears in the final page markup, it is processed  on the server in order to generate the final markup. This means that the Kendo MVC  extension methods are really a server-side shortcut to creating the final markup  needed to make them work as they normally would in JavaScript.  Programming in the MVC framework allows for a very clean separation of concerns  within the web server itself and this, in turn, allows for a great deal of flexibility  around how the views run and how dependent they are on server-side logic. For  example, widgets that use data can receive this data either as embedded material in  the view itself  a dependency on server-side logic , or they can query for data from  the client-side by calling action methods that return JSON  less dependency   on server-side logic .  As an example of a server-dependent implementation, here is a strongly-typed  view with embedded model data that can then be used by widgets on the page.  A strongly-typed view is a view page that specifies a specific type of object that  contains its model data. You can see the strongly-typed model object in this sample  on the first line starting with @model:  @model IEnumerable    @Html.Raw ViewBag.serverData      varserverData = eval $ "serverData" .html   ;  [ 19 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  for  var i = 0; i<serverData.length; i++  { console.log serverData[i].Name ;     }    ViewBag is a dynamic object that is available to you within controller action methods  and view pages. It is a dictionary object that can contain any data or objects that you  need in your view pages. The controller can add anything that you need to ViewBag,  and your view pages will then have access to that data or object just as this sample  code has shown. In this case, the controller has attached an object called serverData  that contains a JSON representation of its model data. We are using the JavaScript  function called eval   to parse it into a JavaScript object and then showing on the  JavaScript console what was inside. This is merely an example of how to embed data  into the view itself without having to use additional network requests, such as the  jQuery functions $.get or $.ajax, to retrieve data to display on the page; it may  prove beneficial in some cases where network traffic needs to be weighed against  immediate data availability that the server can provide up front.  The ViewBag.serverData property is filled in the controller like this:  publicActionResultAutoCompletePage   { var repository = new SampleRepository  ; var data = repository.GetStatesAndTerritories  ; ViewBag.serverData = new JavaScriptSerializer  .Serialize data ; return View data ; }  Note that in this example the controller is both filling in this ViewBag property and  sending the same data to the view as a strongly-typed model; this isn't necessary, but  it is handy here since we can leverage the server's JavaScriptSerializer class to  create JSON for us before we send it to the view. Here is what the JavaScript console  shows when we fill ViewBag.serverData with the JSON representation of an array  of objects that have a Name property:  [ 20 ]   Chapter 1  It is far more common to request data from a separate endpoint and then use it once  it has been retrieved. This allows for data from external sources, and breaks the  dependency on the server to provide the data inside the page, which in turn means  the specific server implementation is likely less important and less complex. jQuery  provides several common and friendly ways of retrieving JSON data such as $.ajax,  $.get, and $.getJSON. Kendo also provides standard ways of retrieving external  data through configuration options on its widgets, often through the property method  transport.read. We will see more about this in the rest of this chapter as we discuss  DataSource and Grid, and throughout the rest of the book.  Managing data The Kendo UI framework consists of two parts—the framework components and  the user interface  UI  widgets. Most of the content that we will cover in this book  relates to the user interface widgets and how to use them, but we will begin with  the important topic of how to manage data within Kendo UI. The DataSource  component and Templates provide a good starting place and will build a foundation  that we will use throughout the rest of this book.  [ 21 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  Templates Kendo UI Templates are script blocks that contain a small section of page markup  that is used by other Kendo UI widgets to display repeating content. We will cover  these first, since they will be used throughout the rest of our examples. Here is an  example of a simple template:  var template = kendo.template " = horseColor  " ; $ "horseDiv" .html template {   horseColor: 'brown}  ;  Running this code would set the HTML content of the horseDiv to a span element  that contained the horseColor value that was passed into the template function  object. It would produce the following code output:    brown    Templates can also be written within a special type of HTML script block so that  their layout appears more naturally within the HTML content.       = rank    = rating    = title    = year        In this template sample, note the lines containing the code fragments = variable_ name . These indicate the sections of code that are interpreted by the Kendo UI  Template engine. The variable names inside these code blocks are supplied to the  template when it is used. The JavaScript property names that you use inside of a  template need to be properties on the object that is passed to the template when it is  called. Note also that the script type is x-kendo-template instead of javascript,  this is important so that the browser will not attempt to execute the script block on  its own. This is a code sample showing this template being initialized in JavaScript:    var template = kendo.template $ "template" .html   ;  functionshowMovies   { $ "moviesTable" .html template              {rank: 1, rating: 9.2, title: 'Prometheus', year: 2012}           ;     }  [ 22 ]   Chapter 1  showMovies  ;    Notice how the template is created through a call to kendo.template  . This  method takes the literal template code as its parameter, which is why the example  shows a call to the jQuery statement $ "template" .html   since this code  returns the literal content of the template script block as it appears in the web page.  So, in this example, it is equivalent to calling kendo.template '  = rank   …' . This means that templates can also be created in-line by typing out the  exact template code directly in the constructor.  When the template object is called as a method, it needs the data passed in as a  parameter. When the example code above runs, it produces this output:       1   9.2   Prometheus   2012       Templates can also include JavaScript which makes it possible to do more advanced  operations, such as iterating over an array and rendering the template for each item  in that array individually. In this case, you supply the template with an array of  objects instead of a single object as before. This time, using the explicit parameter  name data is critical. Note how JavaScript code is surrounded by single  signs like   javascript code  and variable statements are surrounded by = and then  as  in = variable statement . Note also that the space between the  signs and the  content inside is important.     for vari=0; i<data.length; i++  {     = data[i].rank    = data[i].rating    = data[i].title    = data[i].year          }     Templates are an important part of building functional Kendo UI widgets, and they  become even more useful when used in tandem with the DataSources and Grids as  we will see later.  [ 23 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  DataSource The Kendo UI DataSource is a JavaScript object that gives data a common interface  for the various Kendo UI widgets. The full documentation for the DataSource object  can be found on the Kendo UI website at this address: http:  docs.kendoui.com  api framework datasource. The DataSource is a fairly complicated object and  relies on some building blocks that deserve explanations of their own. These building  blocks are the Kendo objects known as Schema, Transport, and Model. Let's address  these first and then continue exploring the DataSource itself.  It is important to note that when creating a DataSource object, you should use the  new keyword to instantiate a new object instead of just using an object literal:  var dataSource = new kendo.data.DataSource {... ...} ;  Model The Model object is from the namespace kendo.data.Model and inherits from  Kendo's ObservableObject. It provides a known structure, or model, to the data  that is used by a DataSource and can also be used to enable some more advanced  functionality such as change tracking. To create a new model, you must do so  through the method kendo.data.Model.define  . In this method, you pass an  object that defines the structure of the model and sets configurable options on the  data elements within. Here is an example of a model:  var Service = kendo.data.Model.define  { id: "serviceId",    the identifier of the model fields: { "serviceName": { type: "string"         }, "unitPrice": { type: "number"         }, "serviceId": { type: "number"   }     } } ;  var currentService = new Service  { serviceName: "Rotate Tires", unitPrice: 29.95, serviceId: 400  [ 24 ]   Chapter 1  } ;  console.log currentService.get "serviceName"  ;    outputs "Rotate  Tires" console.log currentService.get "unitPrice"  ;    outputs 29.95  In this example, we have created a model with three properties and we set the data  type for each of them. We then created a new model object from our model definition  and demonstrated how to access its properties through the model.get   method.  We just demonstrated that the ID of the model object is defined through the property  called id, and that the fields are defined through a property called fields. Within the  fields property, these are the options that can be set to configure each data element:  fields: { "serviceName": {       Property name for a field type: "string",    "string" default , "number", "boolean", or "date" defaultValue: "Inspection",    Default value for field when model is                              created. Default for string is "", number                             is 0, and date is new Date    .i.e. today  editable: true,    Specifies whether field is editable nullable: false,    Specifies if default value should be used when  empty parse: function  {...}    Specifies custom parser for field value validation: {...}    Specifies the validation options used by Kendo                          Validator such as 'required', 'min', and  'max'.     },... }  These are not all required, but they are available when you want a very specific  configuration. Here is an example from the Kendo UI site:  var Product = kendo.data.Model.define  { id: "id",    the identifier is the "id" field  declared below  fields: {    * name of the field *   name: { type: "string",    the field is a string validation: {    validation rules required: true    the field is required     }, defaultValue: " "    default field value   },     * name of the field *  price: { type: "number",    the field is a number  [ 25 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  validation: {    validation rules required: true,    the field is required min: 1    the minimum value is 1     }, defaultValue: 99.99    default field value   },     * name of the field *  id: { editable: false,    this field is not editable nullable: true    a default value will not be assigned         }     } } ;  Since the properties within a model are observable, you need to use special getter   and setter methods to properly trigger the behaviors that other functions and   objects are observing. To retrieve the current value of one of these properties, use  model_name.get   such as currentService.get 'unitPrice' . To set the value of  the property and thereby change it, use model_name.set   such as currentService. set 'unitPrice', 14.95 . The concept of observable objects is a key feature of the  MVVM framework that we will cover in a later chapter.  Two other methods available on model objects are isNew and toJSON. The isNew  method checks if the model is new or not. This is determined by whether or not  the id field is still set at the default value. If the id field is not set at the default  value, the model object is not considered new. The toJSON method returns a JSON  representation of the complete model's properties and values.  Since, as I mentioned, the model inherits from ObservableObject, it exposes   three events to which you can attach custom behaviors—change, get, and set.   The syntax for these is to use model.bind   with the name of the event and a  function to handle it:  currentService.bind 'change', function e { alert e.field + " just changed its value to " + currentService.get [e.field]  ; } ;  [ 26 ]   Chapter 1  Schema The schema object within a DataSource is responsible for describing the raw data  format. It functions at a higher level than the model, and can even contain a model  definition within it. The Schema's job is to instruct the DataSource on where to find  information on errors, aggregates, data, groups, and total records within the raw  data object that the DataSource is using. Each of these pieces of information exists   as a property within the schema object like this:  schema: {   errors: function response  {     return response.errors;   },   aggregates: function response  {     return response.aggregates;   },   data: function response  {     return response.data;   },   total: function response  {     return response.totalCount;   } }  In the preceding code sample, each of the properties has been set to a function which,  when passed the raw data object, will return the appropriate data from within that  object. These properties can also be set to text fields, in which case the field name  given must exist at the top level of the object and already contain the appropriate  data in the appropriate format:  schema: {   errors: "errors_field_name",   aggregates: "aggregates_field_name",   data: "data_field_name",   total: "total_field_name" }  The aggregates property needs data returned in an object format with a structure  something like this. Each property name inside the aggregates object can contain  information on its aggregate values, such as the maximum value  max , minimum  value  min , or the total count:  { unitPrice: {      Field Name   max: 100,        Aggregate function and value   min: 1        Aggregate function and value  [ 27 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid    }, productName: {     Field Name   count: 42        Aggregate function and value   } }  In this case, the data has a max and min defined on the unitPrice field and a count  defined on the productName field. The DataSource object has not calculated these  values; rather they are already present in the raw data sent from the remote server,  and the schema has indicated to the DataSource object where to locate them. It is  possible to use a function to calculate aggregate values, but it is normal for the raw  data to already contain these values within it as returned by a remote server.  As I said earlier, the schema can contain a model definition within it. If this is the  case, the DataSource will call kendo.data.Model.define on the model definition   for you, in order to create the model objects from the raw data:  var dataSource = new kendo.data.DataSource { schema: {   model: {     id: "ProductID",     fields: {     ProductID: {       editable: false,       nullable: true       },       ...  If you have already defined a Model definition, you can simply reference it and the  DataSource will use it just the same:  vardataSource = new kendo.data.DataSource { schema: { model: Product    Use the existing Product model     } } ;  The schema object has a parse property, which you can set to a function that   will be called before the raw data is processed. This gives you a chance to do any  pre-processing if you need it. There is also a type property that can be set to either  json or xml.  [ 28 ]   Chapter 1  Transport The transport object contains properties that a DataSource can use to communicate  with a remote server for any of its normal data functions. Those data functions are  create, destroy, read, and update  corresponding to the different actions that can  be taken on a record . Each of these data functions exists as a property object within  the transport object and follows the same pattern of configuration options. I should  note that not all of the data functions are required; only those functions that your  DataSource should perform need to be defined within your transport object.   This is the basic configuration structure for the transport object.  transport: {   create: {    this sets configuration for creating new records                on the remote server   },   destroy: {    this sets configuration for deleting records                 on the remote server   },   read: {     this sets configuration for reading records               from the remote server   },   update: {    this sets configuration for updating records                on the remote server   },   autoSync: false,    set true to automatically sync all changes   batch: false        set true to enable batch mode }  Here are the different options for configuring the transport object's remote data  operations. Each of the four properties follows the same configuration pattern, but  in this code sample I have shown different ways of configuring them for the sake of  example. In this first code sample, I have configured the create operation to simply  send the value of an HTML element to the remote server.  create: {    for creating data records on remote source. url: " orders create",    the url to the create service. data: {     data to send to the create service as part of the request.    this can also be specified as a function call. orderId: $ "input" .val   }, cache: true,    make false to force fresh requests every time. contentType: "application json",    default is       "application w-www-form-urlencoded" dataType: "json",    "jsonp" is also common. type: "POST"    which http verb to use.   }  [ 29 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  In this example, we have set the destroy method to use a jQuery $.ajax function  to send data to the remote server instead of configuring it directly on the destroy  configuration object. You can do this if you prefer the jQuery syntax and want to  easily attach callback functions to the results of the operation.  destroy: {     same options as "create", with some alternatives shown.          this is how you use $.ajax   to run this remote service call.              this option can be used with "create", "destroy", "read",                  and "update"     $.ajax  { url: " orders destroy", data: options.data,    the data field contains paging, sorting,                              filtering, and grouping data success: function result  {                   notify the DataSource that the operation is complete Options.success result ; } } ; }  In this example, we have created a function to serve as the source of data for the read  operation. This might be useful if you need to perform some custom logic before  receiving remote data, or if you need to bypass the remote data source entirely for  some reason.  read: {     same options as above in "create" and "destroy". data: function   {     this is how you specify data as a function. return { id: 42, name: "John Doe" }; } }  Remember that the configuration options you just saw are valid for any of the  transport operations, I simply showed different operations as an example for each  configuration. When a DataSource is configured with a transport configuration like  this, it will use the properties and functions within these options to perform the  related actions. It will call read when it is loading data, update when a record has  been changed, destroy when a record has been deleted, and create when a new  record is added.  [ 30 ]   Other DataSource properties When reading from local data, you need to reference it by using the property called  data like this:  var someData = [{ title: 'Prometheus', year: 2012, rating: 9, rank: 25  }];  Chapter 1  var dataSource = new kendo.data.DataSource { data: someData } ;  Some other properties of DataSource that we have not yet seen are more for data  manipulation—aggregate, filter, group, sort, page, and pageSize. They can  work on the data client-side, or they can request that the server do the operations by  using the serverAggregates, serverFiltering, serverGrouping, serverSorting,  and serverPaging properties by adding these to the DataSource object properties  list and setting them to true.  The aggregate property takes an array of fieldnames and aggregate function names:  aggregate: [{ field: 'title', aggregate: 'count' }]  The filter property can take a simple object, an array of simple objects, or a  configurable object with some more logic to specify filtering that should be done   on the data:     simple object filter: { field: 'title', operator: 'startswith', value: 'Shawshank' }     ...or array... filter: [{field: 'year', operator: 'eq', value: '1998'}, {field: ...     ...or configurable object... filter:{ logic: "or", filters: [ { field: 'title', operator: 'startswith', value: 'Shawshank' }] }  These are the different operators that can be used with the filter object. They can also  be used when asking the server for filtering by using the serverFiltering property.     Equality: eq, ==, isequalto, equals, equalto, equal       Less: lt, <, islessthan, lessthan, less  Inequality: neq, !=, isnotequalto, notequals, notequalto, notequal, ne  [ 31 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid     Less or Equal: lte, <=, islessthanorequalto, lessthanequal, le    Greater: gt, >, isgreaterthan, greaterthan, greater    Greater or Equal: gte, >=, isgreaterthanorequalto, greaterthanequal,   ge     Starts With: startswith    Ends With: endswith    Contains: contains  The group and sort properties can take either an object or an array of objects   to specify grouping:  group: { field: 'year', dir: 'asc' } sort: { field: 'title', dir: 'desc' }  The page and pageSize properties both take numbers to indicate the page number  and records per page respectively.  DataSource methods The DataSource methods are used to either change or retrieve certain elements of  the DataSource object. Several of them are related to the same data manipulation  properties that we just talked about—aggregate, aggregates, filter, group, page,  pageSize, and sort. In each of these cases, calling the method without parameters  will return the current value of the like-named property within the DataSource;  calling the method with a parameter value will set the value of the like-named  property of the DataSource to the new value passed in:     get the current group descriptors var g = dataSource.group  ;     set a new value for filtering dataSource.filter { field: 'year', operator: 'gt', value: 1990 } ;  There are also methods for adding and removing records. The methods add and  insert both add a new record to the DataSource. The add method simply takes a  model object or an object literal matching the current data format of the items in the  DataSource. The insert method takes the same object as add, but also specifies an  index property indicating the zero-based location at which to insert the new record.  The remove method takes a model object and removes it from the DataSource:     add a new item dataSource.add { year: 1997, title: 'The Fifth Element', rating: 10  } ;  [ 32 ]   Chapter 1     insert an item at the 6th position in the DataSource dataSource.insert 5, {year: 1995, title: 'Twelve Monkeys', rating  9.5} ;     remove an item from the DataSource var movie = dataSource.at 5 ; dataSource.remove movie ;     get the 3rd item in the DataSource var movie = dataSource.at 2 ;  The at, get, and getByUid methods retrieve specific records from the DataSource:     get the model instance with an id of 5     id is determined by the value of the schema.model.id property  var movie = dataSource.get 5 ;     get the model instance, or ObservableObject if no model has been  set    uid is a property inherited from ObservableObject varuid = $ "tr" .data "uid" ; var movie = dataSource.getByUid uid ;  The fetch, query, read, sync, cancelChanges, and view methods are used for  managing the current contents and structure of the DataSource:     fetches data using the current filter sort group paging  information.    will fetch data from transport if data is not already available in  memory. dataSource.fetch  ;    can optionally take a callback function which                        is executed once the data is ready.     executes a query over the data  i.e. paging sorting filtering  grouping     this effects what the call to dataSource.view   will return. dataSource.query { page: 5, pageSize: 20, group:{field:'year',dir:'a sc'}} ;     read data into the DataSource using the transport.read setting dataSource.read  ;     also conveniently causes the change event to  fire  [ 33 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid     synchronizes changes through the transport for any pending CRUD  operations.    if batch mode is enabled, it uses only one call per operation type   create,      read, update, destroy  dataSource.sync  ;     discards all un-synced changes made to the DataSource dataSource.cancelChanges  ;     returns the current state of the items in the DataSource with all  applied   settings such as paging, sorting, filtering, and grouping.    to ensure that data is available, this method should be used from   within the change event of the DataSource change: function e {     ... kendo.render template, dataSource.view   ; }  To finish up the list, we will look at data, total, and totalPages:     retrieve an observable array of items  the current data within the  DataSource  var movies = dataSource.data  ;     set the DataSource to some new data datSource.data [{year: 2009, title: 'Cargo', rating: 6.8}, {year: ...  ] ;     get, but not set, the total number of items in the DataSource var total = dataSource.total  ;     get, but not set, the total number of pages of items in the  DataSource var pages = dataSource.totalPages  ;  It is important to note that you must call dataSource.read   in order for the  DataSource object to initiate the read process and populate itself with data. In other  words, until you call dataSource.read  , there is nothing to read inside your  DataSource.  DataSource events There are three events that are available on the DataSource object—change, error,  and requestStart. The change event is fired when data is changed or read from  the transport. The error event is fired any time an error occurs during data read or  data sync; it is also fired if schema.errors has been set within the DataSource and   [ 34 ]   the response from a server operation contains data in the field specified by schema. errors. The requestStart event is fired when a data request is about to start. Like  other events, these can be set as part of the DataSource definition or later through the  bind method.  Chapter 1     set event handler as part of DataSource definition var dataSource = new kendo.data.DataSource { change: function e {            handle event     } } ;     or set event handler later through the bind method dataSource.bind "error", function e {        handle event } ;  As you will see later, the change event can be a good place to put some code in   order to generate markup while a DataSource is reading in new records. It is also   the appropriate place to put any other code that should respond to changes in   the DataSource.  Getting started with basic usage Now that we have seen the definitions of the components within a DataSource,  we will put together our first example page to demonstrate the basic usage of the  DataSource object in JavaScript. Add a new HTML file to the static folder of the  project and name it DataSource.html. Start out by adding this code:         DataSource                         Rank   Rating   [ 35 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid   Title   Year                          We have referenced jQuery and Kendo UI Web JavaScript files in the head of our  page. Now let's add a template block after the div tag so that we can script the  creation of additional table rows:       = rank    = rating    = title    = year        Now what we need is the ability to take some data and fill out that table using the  layout as defined by this template, enter the DataSource. Add this code after the  template script block that you just typed in:        $ document .ready function   {            create a template using the above definition var template = kendo.template $ "template" .html   ;  var movies = [ { "rank": 1, "rating": 9.2, "year": 1994, "title": "The Shawshank Redemption" }, { "rank": 2, "rating": 9.2, "year": 1972, "title": "The Godfather" }, { "rank": 3, "rating": 9, "year": 1974, "title": "The Godfather: Part II" }, { "rank": 4, "rating": 8.9, "year": 1966, "title": "Il buono, ilbrutto, ilcattivo." }, { "rank": 5, "rating": 8.9, "year": 1994,  [ 36 ]   Chapter 1  "title": "Pulp Fiction" }, { "rank": 6, "rating": 8.9, "year": 1957, "title": "12 Angry Men" }, { "rank": 7, "rating": 8.9, "year": 1993,  "title": "Schindler's List" }, { "rank": 8, "rating": 8.8, "year": 1975,  "title": "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" }, { "rank": 9, "rating": 8.8, "year": 2010,  "title": "Inception" }, { "rank": 10, "rating": 8.8, "year": 2008,  "title": "The Dark Knight" }         ];  var dataSource = new kendo.data.DataSource { data: movies, change: function    {    subscribe to the CHANGE event of the data source $ "movies tbody" .html  kendo.render template, this.view    ;    populate the table             }         } ;     read data from the "movies" array dataSource.read  ;     } ;    Let's step through this code. You should recognize the first few lines where a Kendo  template is created from the script block that you typed just a few paragraphs ago.  After that, you see a JavaScript array of objects holding data about various movies.  This array is going to be the raw data behind the DataSource object that comes  next. The DataSource object is instantiated  note the new keyword  into the variable  called dataSource. It references the movies array as its data parameter and then  defines a function to handle the change event of the DataSource object. Inside  this change event, we are using jQuery to select the movies table and then using  kendo.render   to generate markup from our template variable for each item in  our dataSource object. Note how the template we are using does not need special  JavaScript to iterate over a collection; the DataSource object passes all of the data   to the change event through this.view  . Finally, we call dataSource.read    which reads in the data and consequently fires the change event, thereby adding   the content to our movies table.  [ 37 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  The kendo.render   method takes a template function as its first argument and  then an array of data as its second argument. It runs the data through the template,  generating the resulting markup and returning it back to the caller. In the case above,  we have used jQuery to set the   element's HTML to the result of this kendo. render  function. Binding to remote data Our last example was a demonstration of using local data  a JavaScript array  with   a DataSource. It is also very common and important to use the DataSource with data  that exists on a remote system. To simulate this, we will turn to the ASP.NET MVC  framework to create a server for our remote data. In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, right-click on the Controllers folder  and choose Add, Controller. Name the new controller KendoController and leave  the rest of the dialog that opens at its default settings.  [ 38 ]   The newly created controller class will appear in the editor portion of Visual Studio  and you will see a generic Index   method sitting in the file. This method is known  as an action method and is used to process an HTML response back to a web  browser. The comment above it indicates the route and HTTP verb that are used to  locate this action method:  Chapter 1     GET:  Kendo   public ActionResult Index   { return View  ; }  In this case, it shows that typing the route "Kendo", as in http:     Kendo , would match this action method and cause it to return its view to the  browser. It would also work to specify http:    Kendo Index and  it is usual to supply both the controller name, "Kendo", and the action method name,  "Index", in a normal route. As a matter of convention, the MVC framework names  all controller classes with the suffix "Controller", but it does not use the suffix when  referring to the controller in an actual route  such as the path in the address bar of  your web browser . This means that the KendoController class is referred to as  "kendo" when it is part of a route. GET is the default HTTP verb that this controller  will accept when the browser requests this route.   At the top of KendoController, add a using statement for a namespace that we are  about to create—LearningKendoUIWeb.Repository. Also add Kendo.Mvc.UI and  Kendo.Mvc.Extensions:  Add a new action method called RemoteData and set it up like this:  publicJsonResultRemoteData   { var repository = new SampleRepository  ; var data = repository.GetAllMovies  ; returnJson result, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet ; }  This is a simple method that instantiates a repository  which we will create in just a  moment , gathers some data from that repository, and then returns it to the client as  JSON. The second parameter to the Json   method notifies the controller class that it  is acceptable to return JSON data from this method even though the verb is GET.  [ 39 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  Right-click on the Models folder and click on Add, Class. Name the new class  Movie.cs. This is a very simple class to hold data about a movie:  namespace LearningKendoUIWeb.Models { public class Movie   { public int Rank { get; set; } public double Rating { get; set; } public int Year { get; set; } public string Title { get; set; }   } }  Add a new folder to the project and call it Repository. Add a class to this folder  called SampleRepository.cs:  using LearningKendoUIWeb.Models;  namespaceLearningKendoUIWeb.Repository { public class SampleRepository   { public List GetAllMovies       { var movies = new List { new Movie { Rank = 1, Rating = 9.2,                      Title = "The Shawshank Redemption", Year = 1994 }, new Movie { Rank = 2, Rating = 9.1,                     Title = "The Godfather", Year = 1974 }             };             Return movies;       }    } }  Feel free to add more movies to this list, the more the better. Now we have a simple  repository class that can return a list of movie objects, so the action method we  created in KendoController is finally valid. When the RemoteData action method is  called, it will return the list of Movie objects as a JSON array of objects like this:  [ 40 ]   Chapter 1  I have added more movies to my repository, but the structure of the result is the  same. This is exactly the sort of data that DataSource knows how to use. Here is how  to wire up DataSource to use it, find the line in the RemoteData.cshtml file where  the dataSource variable is created in JavaScript and change the code so that it looks  like this:  var dataSource = new kendo.data.DataSource {   transport: { read: { url: 'Kendo RemoteData '         }     }, change: function    {         $ "movies tbody" .html kendo.render template, this.view    ;     } } ;  Instead of the using the data property to point to a locally available array of objects,  we are using the transport property to tell Kendo that we need to request the data  from a remote source. In this case, all we have specified is how the DataSource can  read remote data and that is all we need, since the only method call we make to the  DataSource is in this line:  dataSource.read  ;  These examples have only scratched the surface, but it does show the DataSource in  action in a real page. It is hard, however, to really demonstrate a DataSource object  in isolation. The DataSource is only actually useful when it serves a data-rich widget,  like the Kendo UI Grid. In the pages to follow, we will explore this Grid widget  and will be able to demonstrate a more fully configured DataSource that the Grid  can take full advantage of. We will also see how to configure both the Grid and the  DataSource through the MVC Razor syntax within a view page.  [ 41 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  Page layout Now that we have discussed the DataSource and Template features of the Kendo UI  framework, we can turn our attention to widgets that provide graphical elements on  our web pages. Some of these widgets actually assist you in organizing the content  or the data in your page, and the Grid is a very good example of this, which we will  cover next.  Grid The Kendo UI Grid is a very handy widget to be familiar with. It is an easy way   to transform data into a usable and interactive grid that would normally take a   full-featured server control  as in ASP.NET WebForms  or some complex and   time-consuming JavaScript development in the page markup. In fact, it is remarkably  easy to set up a simple example. Let's say we have some JavaScript data like this that  we want to display within a web page:    var repairs = [{ name: "State Inspection", price: 39.75, labor: 1, staff: 1             },             { name: "Brake & Clutch System Service", price: 149.95, labor: 3, staff: 1             },             { name: "Power Steering Service", price: 109.96, labor: 3, staff: 1             },             { name: "Cooling System Service", price: 126.95, labor: 2, staff: 1             },             { name: "Oil Change",  [ 42 ]   Chapter 1  price: 37.77, labor: 1, staff: 1             },             { name: "CV Axle Replacement", price: 271.11, labor: 5, staff: 2             },             { name: "Battery Cabling Replacement", price: 179.97, labor: 2, staff: 1             },             { name: "Battery Replacement", price: 118.38, labor: 1, staff: 1             },             { name: "Fuel Induction Service", price: 168.88, labor: 3, staff: 2             },             { name: "Engine Air Filter Replacement", price: 36.63, labor: 1, staff: 1             },             { name: "Timing Belt Replacement", price: 221.75, labor: 3, staff: 2             },             { name: "Drive Belt Replacement", price: 194.79, labor: 3,  [ 43 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  staff: 2             }         ];    In order to turn this into a well-formatted dynamic table, it would normally require  some looping and HTML markup generation, probably through jQuery. With Kendo  UI, however, all we have to do is create a kendoGrid   function and we can see  some magic in action. Take note of how little code is involved to create a grid from  this data here:               $ "repairsGrid" .kendoGrid { dataSource: repairs         } ;    And here is the page output from this simple code:  See how the code involved didn't even require a table to be present within the web  page? Kendo UI generated everything that it needed in order to display this data as  a grid on the page. Now we can turn our attention to creating grids that are more  interactive and intelligent, and explore what the Kendo UI Grid widget has to offer  in displaying data from different sources.  [ 44 ]   Columns First of all, we can take control of the formatting of the Grid by specifying properties  on a columns object array. This object array is used to indicate to the Grid how to  display the data appropriately so that it appears as you want on the page. Here  is a columns object example using the Grid that we saw just a moment ago to  demonstrate the various options available for formatting:  Chapter 1  $ "repairsGrid" .kendoGrid { ... columns: [{ field: "name", title: "Service", width: 300     },     { field: "price", title: "Price", width: 50, format: "${0:.}"     },     { field: "labor", title: "Labor", width: 50, template: "= labor hour s "     },     { field: "staff", title: "Staff", width: 50, template: "= staff  tech s "     }]  [ 45 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  Here is the effect on the output:  There are also simple options for enabling some dynamic interactive behaviors by  specifying which columns are filterable or sortable. Note that these are only useful   if the Grid, as a whole, has pageable and or sortable set to true.  $ "repairsGrid" .kendoGrid {     ... columns: [{ field: "name", title: "Service", width: 300, sortable: true, filterable: true     },     { field: "price", title: "Price", width: 50, format: "${0:.}", sortable: true, filterable: true     },     { field: "labor", title: "Labor", width: 50, template: "= labor  hour s ", sortable: true, filterable: true  [ 46 ]   Chapter 1      },     { field: "staff", title: "Staff", width: 50, template: "= staff  tech s ", sortable: false, filterable: false     }], sortable: true, filterable: true  Note in the following screenshot, how the Service column has been sorted  alphabetically and I have clicked the filter icon, which enables me to input a filter on  the data to be displayed on the page. You can see the filter icon right above the open  window on the screen, it looks like a small funnel. Kendo UI takes care of actually  doing the sorting and the filtering by means of the dataSource property that we set  on the Grid. This means that settings you have put in place on the dataSource that  you supply to the Grid will be used by the Grid for sorting and filtering:  [ 47 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  When the Grid has been configured to allow editing of data, the columns property  allows you to specify a custom editor function that can be used when changing data  in that column. This can be a useful way of giving the user an easier way to input  a change, or even to control the sort of changes that can be made. For example, this  updated code sample shows adding an editor function to the Labor column so that  it displays a drop-down list when edited, giving the user a specific set of options to  choose from. There are a couple of other changes here that we will talk about next:  $ "repairsGrid" .kendoGrid { dataSource: repairs, columns: [   { title: "Action", width: 75, command: ["edit"]   }, { field: "name", title: "Service", width: 300, sortable: true, filterable: true   }, { field: "price", title: "Price", width: 50, format: "${0:.}", sortable: true, filterable: true   }, { field: "labor", title: "Labor", width: 50, template: "= labor  hour s ", sortable: true, filterable: true, editor: function  container, options  { varselectEditor = $ "<select name=" + options.field + "> " ; selectEditor.append new Option "1", 1  ; selectEditor.append new Option "2", 2  ; selectEditor.append new Option "3", 3  ;  [ 48 ]   Chapter 1  selectEditor.append new Option "4", 4  ; selectEditor.append new Option "5", 5  ; selectEditor.appendTo container ;     }   },   { field: "staff", title: "Staff", width: 50, template: "= staff  tech s ", sortable: false, filterable: false   }], sortable: true, filterable: true, editable: "inline"  Here is the output of the editor function, showing the drop-down list that appears  when a row enters the edit mode. It is important to set the name attribute of the    element so that Kendo can bind the user's choice back to the dataSource  when the edit is saved.  [ 49 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  When using a custom editor function like this, the container and options objects  that are passed in have some specific properties available to them that can be useful  to you when writing your function. The container object is the page element to  which you should add any new mark-up, as we did in our example. The options  object contains two properties: options.field and options.model. The options. field property contains the name of the field that you should use in your new  mark-up so that Kendo can bind everything properly. The options.model property  contains a reference to the actual model of the data being edited if one was specified  in the dataSource; this gives you access to data that could be important when  creating your custom logic.  Additional changes that appeared in the code sample were the editable: "inline"  property on the Grid definition  required for editing to work; the alternative to  inline is popup, which opens a special window for editing the record , and the  new column that includes command buttons. The command property of a column  object takes an array of command buttons to generate within each row. The available  options for this array include edit, create, destroy, save, and cancel. We will  return to this topic soon when we go into more detail on how to bind a Grid to  CRUD operations.  Note that all that was necessary to add these command buttons to the Grid was  to specify the command property of the column object. I did not add any    elements to the column, nor did I create JavaScript event handlers. Kendo UI generated  all of this necessary markup for me through the Grid widget's existing functionality.  A significant portion of Grid functionality can be enabled through properties that  describe the Grid's current capabilities. Each of them end in -able. These properties  are editable, filterable, groupable, navigatable, pageable, scrollable,  selectable, and sortable. We have already seen filterable and sortable and  that they take simple true false values when used. We have also seen editable, but  there is more that can be done with this option:  ... editable: { confirmation: "Are you sure?",    text displayed to confirm a delete                                    operation destroy: true,            whether or not to delete item when button                             is clicked mode: "popup",                    options are "incell", "inline",                                     and "popup" template: "= ... ",             template to use for pop-up editing update: true                      switch item to edit mode when                                     clicked? }  [ 50 ]   The groupable property lets the user group columns by dragging them to the top of  the screen. The groupable option also includes a property, groupable.messages. empty that will be displayed in an empty grouping area on a Grid. If you specify this  messages property, the groupable: true value is assumed and does not need to be  specified. The navigatable property turns on or off keyboard navigation within the  Grid. Here is how the bottom of our Grid definition would look with groupable and  navigatable turned on:  Chapter 1  ... sortable: true, filterable: true, editable: "inline", navigatable: true, groupable: { messages: { empty: "Drag column header here for grouping"     } }  And the output in the page when rendered with these options:  The pageable option can be simply set to true false, like several of the other  options, but it also allows for more fine-grained control if you desire it:  ... pageable: { pageSize: 10,  [ 51 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  previousNext: true,    show buttons navigating to first last next                          previous numeric: true,    show numeric portion of the pager in the Grid? buttonCount: 10,    number of buttons to show in numeric pager input: true,    create input element allowing user to navigate to page pageSizes: [5,10,20],   array of page size choices for user refresh: true,     show a refresh button in the Grid? info: true,    show a label with current paging information in it messages: { display: "Detail Template – {1} of {2} items",    info text empty: "No Records",    text to show when there are no records page: "Page",    first part of text of input option of: "of Detail Template",    last part of text of input option itemsPerPage: "items per page",    text for selecting page size first: "Go to first page",    text of first page button tooltip previous: "Go to the previous page",    previous page tooltip next: "Go to next page",    next page tooltip last: "Go to the last page",    last page tooltip refresh: "Refresh"    text of refresh button tooltip   } }  Our example code configured for paging with 10 items per page would appear   like this:  ... sortable: true, filterable: true, editable: "inline", navigatable: true, groupable: { messages: { empty: "Drag column header here for grouping" } }, pageable: { pageSize: 10 }  [ 52 ]   And the output generated with these options:  Chapter 1  The scrollable property configures whether a Grid can have a vertical scroll bar  within it, and is usually specified if you have restricted the height of the Grid on  your page. It can be set to a simple Boolean value of true false.  The selectable property indicates whether selection is enabled or disabled within  the Grid. Its possible values are row, cell, multiple, row, and multiple, cell.  Here is how our example Grid looks with selectable: "multiple, cell".   Note that I have selected some rows for display.  [ 53 ]   Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid  The toolbar property enables a toolbar for the Grid with a certain set of commands,  similar to the command property of the column objects. Each toolbar within the  toolbar object array can have a name, template, and text configured:  ... toolbar: [ "create", { name: "save", text: "Save This Record" }, { name: "cancel", text: "Cancel Changes: }]  Note how a toolbar can be a simple text value indicating which command to  implement. You can also specify objects to contain the configuration data that   you want  as in the preceding screenshot . Refer to the following screenshot:  Summary In this chapter, we have covered a lot of fundamental information so that you can get  started creating Kendo UI-enabled web pages properly. It is essential to understand  how to use a Template and how to use a DataSource in order to do much at all with  the Kendo UI framework. Second to these, the Grid is an essential component of the  Kendo UI framework and knowing how to configure it will give you a head start  when building pages that need to display tabular data to a user.  In the next chapter, we will learn about the AutoComplete widget. It allows you to add  a word-wheel effect to input text boxes, to assist users in typing information that can  be looked up from a data source. It is a great tool that many users are drawn to and  will add a lot of functionality to your web pages without a lot of effort in writing   the code.  [ 54 ]   The AutoComplete Widget  and its Usage  The AutoComplete widget from Kendo UI creates the "word wheel" effect on an  input box as a user types. A word wheel is an effect where words appear beneath  a textbox as a user types that help suggest possible search terms. You often see this  on search engines such as Google and Bing. This can be used to give the user a list  of approved choices from which he or she can choose, or it can also help the user  type specific keywords accurately, since the canonical form of the item appears  directly beneath the input box for the user to select. It also saves the user's time if  he or she only has to type one or two characters of a potentially long search term.  The AutoComplete widget in Kendo UI is very easy to configure and brings this  functionality to users of your site with little effort on your part.   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage  AutoComplete widget – basics Open the Visual Studio project that you created in the previous chapter and then  open the KendoController.cs class in the Controllers folder. Let's add a new  action method for our initial AutoComplete test page.  public ActionResult AutoCompletePage   {   return View  ; }  Right-click on the action method's name and choose Add View. For now, choose the  defaults that appear in the dialog and this will take you to the web page so that we  can get started.  [ 56 ]   Chapter 2  Binding AutoComplete to a local source Since we are referencing the default layout that we created in the last chapter, we  will get all of the Kendo and jQuery files that we need in our page header without  having to retype anything.  We will start by demonstrating how to use the AutoComplete widget purely through  JavaScript with local data binding. We will need an input element, a JavaScript array,  and some jQuery.        stateOrTerritory {       width:200px;     }     AutoCompletePage       varstatesAndTerritories = ["Alabama",             "Alaska",             "American Samoa",             "Arizona",             "Arkansas",             ...             "Washington",             "West Virginia",             "Wisconsin",             "Wyoming"];      $ "stateOrTerritory" .kendoAutoComplete {       dataSource: statesAndTerritories,       filter: "startswith",       placeholder: "Choose state or territory...",       separator: ", "     } ;     [ 57 ]   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage  We can use a list of the United States and Territories for a nice sampling of the  alphabet and a list long enough for a demonstration. All that we have done so far  is created some data in JavaScript for the AutoComplete to use, and then wired it  up with jQuery and Kendo UI to the input element at the top of the page. We have  specified that we want to use the statesAndTerritories JavaScript array as our  data source, that we wanted the filter to run in "startswith" mode, that we want  placeholder text in the input element, and that the items in the array are separated  by a comma. These properties are explained in more detail at the end of the chapter.  Run this and you should see an input box with some nice looking placeholder text  in your browser. Type some letters in it and you get an immediate result with some  state and territory suggestions.  Binding AutoComplete to Remote Data Now that we have seen how to wire up the AutoComplete widget using local  JavaScript data, let's see how to do it with remote data. Add a new class called  StateTerritory.cs to the Models folder in the Visual Studio project. Structure it to  hold the relevant data about states and territories so that we can use this in our page.  namespace LearningKendoUIWeb.Models {   public class StateTerritory   {     public string Name { get; set; }     public bool IsState { get; set; }     public bool IsTerritory { get; set; }  [ 58 ]   Chapter 2      public bool IsContiguous { get; set; }   } }  Now open the SampleRepository.cs class file and add some logic to create a  repository of our state and territory data. Note that I have intentionally counted  the District of Columbia as both a state and a territory for the purposes of future  examples.  public List GetStatesAndTerritories   { var stateTerritories = new List { new StateTerritory{ Name = "Alabama", IsContiguous = true,  IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "Alaska", IsContiguous = false,  IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "American Samoa", IsContiguous = false, IsState = false, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "Arizona", IsContiguous = true,  IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "Arkansas", IsContiguous = true, IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, ... new StateTerritory{ Name = "Washington", IsContiguous = true, IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "West Virginia", IsContiguous = true, IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "Wisconsin", IsContiguous = true, IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }, new StateTerritory{ Name = "Wyoming", IsContiguous = true,  IsState = true, IsTerritory = false }     }; return stateTerritories; }  Now we have some server-side data that we can play with, but we still need to  expose it across HTTP. Go back to the KendoController.cs class file and add   a new action method like you see in this code block:  public JsonResult AutoCompleteData   {   var repository = new SampleRepository  ;   var data = repository.GetStatesAndTerritories  ;   returnJson data, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet ; }  [ 59 ]   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage  This will expose our collection of states and territories as a JSON array of  StateTerritory objects. Remember to set the JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet  property or this will not work. Now we can modify our AutoCompletePage.cshtml  file to use the transport property to get its data.  $ "stateOrTerritory" .kendoAutoComplete {   dataSource: {     transport: {     read: {       url: " Kendo AutoCompleteData "           }     }   },   dataTextField: "Name",   filter: "startswith",   placeholder: "Choose state or territory...", } ;  Run the page again and watch it pull data from the server. We have to specify which  field contains the data text field, since our JSON data is structured as objects and not  simply an array. We also no longer need the separator property.  [ 60 ]   Using AutoComplete with MVC through  Models We can take this one step further and transform our code into Razor syntax with  MVC. First, create a controller action method to return data from the server.  Chapter 2  public ActionResult AutoCompletePage   {   var repository = new SampleRepository  ;   var data = repository.GetStatesAndTerritories  ;   return View data ; }  Next, open AutoCompletePage.cshtml and delete everything in it after the   tag.  At the top of the file, we need to add a declaration so that this View page becomes  strongly-typed to our new model class StateTerritory.cs.  @model IEnumerable   Now add this code that utilizes the HTML helper class and the Kendo   extension methods.   AutoCompletePage  @ Html.Kendo  .AutoComplete       .Name "statesAndTerritories"      .DataTextField "Name"      .BindTo Model      .Filter "startswith"      .Placeholder "Choose state or territory..."     Recognize the syntax? Except for the BindTo Model  statement, these method names  are the same as the properties we used in JavaScript  except that they start with capital  letters, of course . The call to BindTo Model  is how the MVC controller passes  data into the MVC view. In this case, we strongly-typed our view to a collection   IEnumerable  of StateTerritory objects, and here in the code we are telling the  Kendo framework that this model contains the data to display in the AutoComplete.  The data in this model is used while the page is being created by the server, and is only  accessible through the Razor syntax code statements in the View page.   [ 61 ]   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage  Even though we just wired up the AutoComplete to the server through MVC,  the method we used isn't really like a call to remote data. It is actually using local  data, by saving all of the model data from the server into the JavaScript where the  AutoComplete is initialized. There isn't anything wrong with this, so long as we  do not attempt to embed so much data into the page that it loads slowly. In fact it  is likely a good way to boost performance in some situations, but it is important  to know where the data is and how the page is accessing it. If we want the page to  request the data from a URL, we need to make some changes to our view.  Using AutoComplete with MVC through  Ajax Open the view and make a change to the AutoComplete   extension method call just  like this code block.   AutoCompletePage  @ Html.Kendo  .AutoComplete       .Name "statesAndTerritories"      .Placeholder "Choose state or territory..."      .DataTextField "Name"      .Filter "startswith"      .DataSource source =>         { source.Read read =>             { read.Action "AutoCompleteData", "Kendo" ;             }              .ServerFiltering false ;         }     We have removed the BindTo Model and replaced it with a call to DataSource    where we use a lambda expression to define how to create the data source. In this  case, we have configured it to use the action method that returns the JSON data  we configured earlier, and also that the server is not performing any filtering. This  effectively sets our web page up in the same way as our original JavaScript page that  used the transport property to get JSON data from the server.  [ 62 ]   Chapter 2  Sending data to the server We want to be able to filter the data for the AutoComplete widget on the server  side. We can either use the data property within the transport JavaScript object,  or we can continue with our MVC example and specify the data to send inside the  DataSource lambda expression. Let's say, for example, that we want to be able to  choose what type of states and territories show up in the AutoComplete widget. We  can accomplish this by sending some data along with the request, then having the  server revise the data that it sends back. Replace the contents of AutoCompletePage. cshtml with this updated code.   AutoCompletePage   Choose whether to see States:     Show States   Show Only Territories      @ Html.Kendo  .AutoComplete       .Name "statesAndTerritories"      .Placeholder "Choose state or territory..."      .DataTextField "Name"      .Filter "startswith"      .DataSource source =>         {           source.Read read =>           {               read.Action "AutoCompleteData", "Kendo"                      .Data "onAdditionalData" ;             }              .ServerFiltering false ;         }      var autocomplete = $ "statesAndTerritories" . data "kendoAutoComplete" ;  functiononAdditionalData   {   return {     showStates: $ "stateType" .val           }     }    [ 63 ]   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage  Notice the call to Data "onAdditionalData"  in the lambda expression and the  new JavaScript method onAdditionalData   with the same name. When the data  source for the AutoComplete is read, it will fire this JavaScript event and send the  result to the server with a parameter named showStates. In order to receive this data  into your action method, you need to add a parameter to it with a matching name.  public JsonResult AutoCompleteData bool showStates = true  {      setting showStates = true means that it is an optional parameter      with the default value of true.   var repository = new SampleRepository  ;   var data = repository.GetStatesAndTerritories  ;   if  !showStates    {     data = data.Where s =>s.IsState == false .ToList  ;   }   return Json data, JsonRequestBehavior.AllowGet ; }  Now, when the AutoComplete code sends the showStates parameter as part of its  web request, the controller will use the value of that to determine whether or not to  filter the data that it sends back.  Using Templates to Customize  AutoComplete Kendo templates can be used to customize the appearance of the items in your  AutoComplete. This can even get quite fancy with images and special styles. Here is  a simple example. Update the Razor portion of the AutoCompletePage.cshtml page  to look like this:  @{ var template = "= Name  - = IsState "; } @ Html.Kendo  .AutoComplete       .Name "statesAndTerritories"      .Placeholder "Choose state or territory..."      .DataTextField "Name"      .Filter "startswith"      .DataSource source =>     {       source.Read read =>       {  [ 64 ]   Chapter 2          read.Action "AutoCompleteData", "Kendo"                      .Data "onAdditionalData" ;       }      .ServerFiltering false ;     }      .Template template     Here we have added a variable called template that is holding our Kendo template  definition. We then referenced that in our AutoComplete   setup code. Run the page  and take a look.  Configuring all of the AutoComplete  properties The AutoComplete widget has several different properties that can be set during its  initialization to customize its behavior. Here is a structured code sample to show you  what is available on the AutoComplete widget.  $ "autocomplete" .kendoAutoComplete { dataSource: dataSource,    see chapter 1   animation: {   close: {     effects: "fadeOut",       duration: 300,       hide: true,       show: false     },     open: {     effects: "fadeIn",       duration: 300,  [ 65 ]   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage        show: true     }   },   dataTextField: "Name",    name of field in data source to display   delay: 500,    milliseconds before auto complete activates   enable: true,    set "false" to disable   filter: "contains",    type of filtration, passed to remote source   height: 200,    height of drop-down list   highlightFirst: true,    highlight first item in list?   ignoreCase: true,   minLength: 1,    minimum characters before activating drop-down list   placeHolder: "Enter value...",    placeholder text   separator: ", ",    separator for completion of search terms.     allows for multiple search terms by using comma or                          other delimiter   suggest: false,    auto-type rest of search term?   template: template    see chapter 1 }  Hooking into AutoComplete widget  events The AutoComplete widget has several different events that it fires while performing  actions on your page. You can bind them after the AutoComplete widget has been  initialized like this:  varautoComplete = $ "autoComplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ; $ "autoComplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" .bind "change",  function e  {        handle event } ;  Or you can define them within the properties of the AutoComplete widget itself   like this:  $ "autoComplete" .kendoAutoComplete { close: function e  {            handle event     } } ;  In either case, this is the list of events to which you can attach your own code.  [ 66 ]   Chapter 2  Change The change event fires as the selection in the AutoComplete widget changes.   You can bind events after initialization.  Close The close event fires when the drop-down list is closed from the AutoComplete  widget.  Open The open event fires every time the drop-down list is opened from the  AutoComplete widget.  Select The select event fires when any of the elements is selected from the AutoComplete  widget. It passes the argument e.item to the function that handles it so that you can  access the item that was selected.  Using the API AutoComplete methods To access the AutoComplete widget from within JavaScript code, you can access it  through the API by calling it this way through jQuery:  var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;  Once you have a variable reference to the AutoComplete widget, you will be able to  call the API methods and manipulate it through code as you wish. These are the API  methods available on the AutoComplete widget.  Close The close   method closes the drop-down list on the AutoComplete widget.     get a reference to the autocomplete widget var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;  autocomplete.close  ;  [ 67 ]   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage  DataItem The dataItem   method returns the data record at the specified index.   This dataItem object will be the specific object from the AutoComplete   widget's data source at the specified index. In our examples above, it would   be a specific stateOrTerritory object.  var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;     get the dataItem corresponding to the passed index. var dataItem = autocomplete.dataItem 1 ;  Destroy The destroy   method prepares the AutoComplete widget for safe removal from  the DOM. It detaches all event handlers and removes data attributes. It does not  actually take the final step of removing it from the DOM; that is an action you must  program yourself.  var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;     detach events autocomplete.destroy  ;  Enable The enable   method toggles the AutoComplete widget on and off.     get a reference to the autocomplete widget var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;     disables the autocomplete autocomplete.enable false ;     enables the autocomplete autocomplete.enable true ;  Refresh The refresh   method re-renders the items in the drop-down list of the  AutoComplete widget.     get a reference to the Kendo UI AutoComplete var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;    re-render the items in drop-down list. autocomplete.refresh  ;  [ 68 ]   Search The search   method filters the data source of the AutoComplete widget using the  provided parameter and then rebinds the drop-down list.     get a reference to the autocomplete widget var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;  Chapter 2     Searches for item which has "Inception" in the name. autocomplete.search "Inception" ;  Select The select   method selects a drop-down list item from the AutoComplete widget  and sets the text of the AutoComplete input box.     get a reference to the autocomplete widget var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;     selects by jQuery object autocomplete.select autocomplete.ul.children  .eq 0  ;  Suggest The suggest   method forces a suggestion onto the text of the AutoComplete widget.     note that this suggest is not the same as the configuration method    suggest which enables disables auto suggesting for the AutoComplete       get a reference to the Kendo UI AutoComplete varautoComplete = $ "autoComplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;     force a suggestion to the item with the name "Inception" autoComplete.suggest "Inception" ;  Value The value   method gets or sets the value of the AutoComplete widget.     get a reference to the autocomplete widget var autocomplete = $ "autocomplete" .data "kendoAutoComplete" ;     get the text of the autocomplete. var value = autocomplete.value  ;  [ 69 ]   The AutoComplete Widget and its Usage  Summary The AutoComplete widget is a great way to aid users on your site. Any time an input  box's values can be predicted, such as when they come from a specific set of values  or when searching common terms, an AutoComplete widget will immediately make  your site easier to use and your users are sure to notice and appreciate it. Not only  that, but the configuration is so straightforward that you can enable it without   much effort.  In the next chapter we will learn how to use the Calendar widget. This widget will  allow you to display and configure interactive calendar controls in your web pages  so that users can easily select dates. It will also give you a way of binding data to  calendars to show important dates. The Telerik Kendo UI Calendar widget will help  change a complicated JavaScript calendar into a simple-to-use tool for developing  great web pages.  [ 70 ]   Using and Customizing  Calendar  Calendars have long been a feature of web pages that require some clever JavaScript.  HTML5 is working toward making it all much simpler, but browser support still  isn't consistent. This is where Kendo UI is a perfect solution, being a framework that  combines HTML5 and JavaScript to create cross-browser consistency using the latest  standards. Like always, the Kendo UI solution couldn't be simpler to implement.  Calendar widget – basics The Kendo UI Calendar widget transforms a simple HTML element, such as a div,  into a specialized HTML table that displays a calendar. It also wires up JavaScript  functionality to this table to support all of the Calendar widget events and methods.  To see the simplest possible implementation of this widget, create a new action  method in the Kendo controller so that we have a URL for "calendar":  Then add a view for this action method and set up an empty div to hold a Kendo  calendar widget:  public ActionResult Calendar   {     return View  ; }  @{     ViewBag.Title = "Calendar"; }   Calendar      Using and Customizing Calendar          $ "calendar" .kendoCalendar  ;    The output is amazing considering how little code we have written:  Click around on the calendar and observe how much functionality it already  has. The arrows at the top of the calendar navigate forward or backward by one  month. The text at the top of the calendar, shown as October 2012 in the preceding  screenshot, navigates up to a broader level of dates which makes it easy to select a  different year or decade. The date at the bottom of the calendar is a hyperlink that  navigates directly to the current date. As we add functionality later in this chapter,  we can make the calendar do even more.  Configuring the Calendar widget Since the Calendar widget only has a few properties, let's start by examining them  and then move on to examples in using them. The calendar widget has two different  types of properties:      Data template properties: These properties configure the data behind the   calendar widget     Display formatting properties: These properties configure how the calendar   is rendered on the page and how that data is formatted   [ 72 ]   Chapter 3  Here are these properties listed in code format. Add this code to the page and run it:  $ "calendar" .kendoCalendar {     culture: 'en-US',    specifies the culture     depth: 'month',      specifies navigation depth                          century decade month year      max: new Date 2012,11,31 ,    latest date calendar can show     min: new Date 1980, 0, 1 ,    oldest date calendar can show     start: 'year',       specifies the start view  century decade  month year      value: new Date 2012,9,25 ,    initially selected date     format: 'yyyy MM dd'     format string used when the value   of  this                             calendar is requested } ;  The calendar, when configured as above, renders initially by showing a selection of  months available within the currently selected year  start: 'year' . Since we have  configured it to allow a navigation depth into each month  depth: 'month'  we can  click on a month and then see that month and all of its available days:  Even though the current view is "year", today's date  is still visible within the footer of the calendar.  [ 73 ]   Using and Customizing Calendar  Speaking of the footer, let's take a look at the data template properties that the  calendar makes available. The three main properties here are data, month, and footer  and they are the primary way to customize the calendar widget. To demonstrate a  simple example of customizing specific dates in a calendar, add this code to a page and  run it:   Calendar            .specialDay {         color: white;         background-color: orange;         border:1px solid black;     }          if  $.inArray +data.date, data.dates  != -1  {           = data.value        } else {          = data.value       }          var datesArray = [+new Date 2012, 5, 15 , +new Date 2012, 5, 21 ];      $ "calendar" .kendoCalendar {         culture: 'en-US',    specifies the culture         depth: 'month',       specifies navigation depth         max: new Date 2012, 5,31 ,    latest date calendar can show         min: new Date 2012, 5, 1 ,    oldest date calendar can show         start: 'month',       specifies the start view         value: new Date 2012,5,11 ,    initially selected date         format: 'yyyy MM dd',     format string used to format the  date values         dates: datesArray,         month: {             content: $ "redDays" .html  ,             empty: "X"         },         footer: "Today is = kendo.toString data, 'd'  " } ;    [ 74 ]   Let's step through this code together. First, we have a special style instruction  for how special days are to be displayed. In this case, white text on an orange  background with a solid black border. We also specify a Kendo UI template block  with JavaScript to determine whether the date being rendered is one of our special  days. If it is one of the special days, then we want the custom style applied to it;  otherwise just render it as usual.  Chapter 3        .specialDay {         color: white;         background-color: orange;         border:1px solid black;     }          if  $.inArray +data.date, data.dates  != -1  {           = data.value        } else {          = data.value       }     Next, we define the actual configuration of the calendar widget. This is where  the relationship between the month property and the dates property becomes  apparent: the dates property supplies the data that the month property uses to  render the days on the calendar. In the template that we have defined, we check to  see if the current date being rendered is included in the dates array and then use  data.value to render the number of the date currently executing. Notice also that  we have prepended the dates in the dateArray with a plus sign + to force them  into a numeric date that we can easily compare with $.inArray  . This is not a  requirement in every case, but works for this example.        var datesArray = [+new Date 2012, 5, 15 , +new Date 2012, 5, 21 ];      $ "calendar" .kendoCalendar {         culture: 'en-US',    specifies the culture         depth: 'month',       specifies navigation depth         max: new Date 2012, 5,31 ,    latest date calendar can show         min: new Date 2012, 5, 1 ,    oldest date calendar can show         start: 'month',       specifies the start view         value: new Date 2012,5,11 ,    initially selected date         format: 'yyyy MM dd',     format string used to format the  date values         dates: datesArray,  [ 75 ]   Using and Customizing Calendar          month: {             content: $ "redDays" .html  ,             empty: "X"         },         footer: "Today is = kendo.toString data, 'd'  " } ;    The other things to note are the new property called footer that is used to render  a template for the footer of the calendar, which has access to today's date through  the data property passed to it. Also, note that the month object has another property  called empty that is used to render dates that fall outside of the min or max property  value ranges.  With the calendar set up in this way, it looks like this in the browser:  Note the special display of the dates supplied through the dateArray,  the dates out of range, and the new text used in the footer.  Calendar Widget using MVC The Calendar widget can also be configured through the ASP.NET MVC extension  methods. To imitate the calendar we just created, you can replace the contents of  your view with this code:   Calendar        .specialDay {         color: white;         background-color: orange;         border:1px solid black;  [ 76 ]   Chapter 3      }          if  $.inArray +data.date, data.dates  != -1  {   = data.value        } else {          = data.value       }          var datesArray = [+new Date 2012, 5, 15 , +new Date 2012, 5, 21 ];   @ Html.Kendo  .Calendar       .Name "mvcCalendar"      .Depth CalendarView.Month      .Max new DateTime 2012, 6, 30       .Min new DateTime 2012, 6, 1       .Start CalendarView.Month      .Value new DateTime 2012, 6, 11       .Format "yyyy MM dd"      .MonthTemplate " if  $.inArray +data.date, datesArray  != -1  {  " +                     " = data.value  " +                     " } else { " +                     "= data.value " +                     " } "      .Footer "Today is = kendo.toString data, 'd'  "         This is the output when using this new code:  [ 77 ]   Using and Customizing Calendar  Pretty similar, isn't it? Note that the MVC extension hid the dates below max and  min and didn't give us an empty property on the month. There are a few other  unique things to note as well. First, notice that we are still using an array of dates  through JavaScript inside the view. This is because the month template is running in  JavaScript, not through MVC extensions, and needs access to this data on the client.  Because of this, and because of the fact that the MVC extensions do not provide  a dates property, we have to change the template from using data.dates to the  actual name of the JavaScript array—datesArray. In this example, I typed out the  template code directly into the MVC extension method, but there is also a method  called MonthTemplateId   where you can pass the HTML id of the template  already on the page.  Also, remember to always call the .Name   method on every Kendo MVC extension  object; it is required for the code to work. This is how the MVC extension methods  assign a unique name and id attribute to the rendered HTML output, and how all of  the JavaScript methods and events are properly wired up in the web browser. If you  do not include the .Name   method, you will also see a runtime error when you try  to run the page.  Methods available on the Calendar  widget The Calendar widget exposes several methods that can be used to interact with it  on the page. These methods can be used to configure the widget by changing its  properties or firing specific functionality in real time. Here is a code form of the  available methods specific to the Kendo UI Calendar widget:  var calendar = $ "calendarId" .data "kendoCalendar" ;     Set a new max date calendar.max new Date 2013,11,31  ;    Retrieve the current max date var lastDay = calendar.max  ;     Set a new min date calendar.min new Date 2011, 11, 31 ;    Retrieve the current min date var oldestDay = calendar.min  ;     Navigate to a specific date using a specific view calendar.navigate new Date 2012,2,5 , "month" ;  [ 78 ]      Navigate down to a lower view  i.e. goes from "year" to "month"  calendar.navigateDown new Date 2012,6,7  ;    date is optional  Chapter 3     Navigate to the future calendar.navigateToFuture  ;     Navigate to the past calendar.navigateToPast  ;     Navigate up to a higher view  i.e. goes from "year" to "decade"  calendar.navigateUp "year" ;     Set a new value  selected date  for the calendar calendar.value new Date 2012,4,7  ;     Get the current value  selected date  of the calendar var selectedDate = calendar.value  ;  Let's take an example of some of these and see it in action on our page.   Modify the code we just created for the MVC view like this:   Calendar        .specialDay {         color: white;         background-color: orange;         border:1px solid black;     }          if  $.inArray +data.date, data.dates  != -1  {   = data.value        } else {          = data.value       }          var datesArray = [+new Date 2012, 5, 15 , +new Date 2012, 5, 21 ];   @ Html.Kendo  .Calendar       .Name "mvcCalendar"      .Depth CalendarView.Month .Start CalendarView.Month      .Value new DateTime 2012, 6, 11       .Format "yyyy MM dd"      .MonthTemplate " if  $.inArray +data.date, datesArray  != -1  {   [ 79 ]   Using and Customizing Calendar  " +                     " = data.value  " +                     " } else { " +                     "= data.value " +                     " } "      .Footer "Today is = kendo.toString data, 'd'  "           Navigate Up    Navigate Down    Pop-Up Value        $ "navigateUp" .click function    {         var calendar = $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" ;         calendar.navigateUp  ;     } ;     $ "navigateDown" .click function    {         var calendar = $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" ;         calendar.navigateDown calendar.value   ;     } ;     $ "showValue" .click function    {         var calendar = $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" ;         alert calendar.value   ;     } ;    In order to use the calendar widget as a JavaScript object, we have to call the  .data   function on the page element that contains the calendar that we created.  Click the buttons on the page and see what they do. It should give you some idea of  what the calendar widget can offer, and how you could plug your own interactive  code into a calendar to improve the user experience.  [ 80 ]   Chapter 3  Events fired by the Calendar widget The Kendo UI calendar widget has two events—change and navigate. These events  fire when the action after which they are named occurs. The Change fires when the  selected date is changed, navigate fires when the calendar is navigated—such as  when the month is changed or the view is moved up from "month" to "year".  What if you wanted the calendar to only appear when a user selected a certain  input box on a page, and then place its value into that input element? You could try  something like this. Modify the final script block of the page that we are working  on to look like this example:        $ function    {         $ "mvcCalendar" .hide  ;     } ;     $ document .ready function    {         $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" .bind "change",  function  e  {             var date = $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" . value  ;             $ "showTheCalendar" .val kendo.toString date, 'd'  ;         } ;     } ;     $ "showTheCalendar" .focusin function    {         $ "mvcCalendar" .slideDown  ;     } ;     $ "nameInput" .focusin function    {         $ "mvcCalendar" .slideUp  ;     } ;     $ "ageInput" .focusin function    {         $ "mvcCalendar" .slideUp  ;     } ;     $ "navigateUp" .click function    {         var calendar = $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" ;         calendar.navigateUp  ;     } ;     $ "navigateDown" .click function    {         var calendar = $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" ;         calendar.navigateDown calendar.value   ;     } ;     $ "showValue" .click function    {         var calendar = $ "mvcCalendar" .data "kendoCalendar" ;         alert calendar.value   ;     } ;    [ 81 ]   Using and Customizing Calendar Here we have some events, wired up by simple jQuery and jQuery UI, that show or  hide the calendar and take its value when selected. The change event of the calendar  is used to determine when to place the new date value into the input element of the  page. This is how the page appears when first rendered.  The calendar is hidden until the user clicks into the first textbox. As soon as that  happens, the events we wired up cause the calendar to appear so that the use can  select the appropriate date for the page.  [ 82 ]   Chapter 3  Summary The Kendo UI calendar widget is easy to configure, and offers a rich element on your  page that can make working with dates a much simpler task. It can be configured  from either JavaScript or MVC extensions and makes use of Kendo templates for  highly customizable formatting and display. I have only shown basic examples of  what can be done with the templates and events; you can take these and run with  them to create some very useful interactive content.  In the next chapter we will learn about one of the most powerful features of the  Kendo UI framework of all, the Model-View-ViewModel  MVVM  framework. This  framework lets you bind data and functionality to your page through simple HTML  attributes and enable real-time changes to your data, or to a server, with immediate  feedback for the user. The MVVM framework is a great tool that you will want to use  in all of your pages.  [ 83 ]    The Kendo MVVM  Framework  JavaScript development has come a long way since its inception and the appearance  of rich MVVM frameworks is wonderful evidence of that evolution. These allow the  developer to separate responsibilities within the code to better handle complexity.  They also provide a beautifully simple syntax so that the MVVM framework itself is  left to handle the tedious work of binding dynamic data into your web pages. If you  have never used a JavaScript MVVM framework before, you are in for a treat with  the Kendo MVVM framework.  Understanding MVVM – basics MVVM stands for Model  M , View  V , and View-Model  VM . It is part of a  family of design patterns related to system architecture that separate responsibilities  into distinct units. Some other related patterns are Model-View-Controller  MVC   and Model-View-Presenter  MVP . These differ on what each portion of the  framework is responsible for, but they all attempt to manage complexity through  the same underlying design principles. Without going into unnecessary details here,  suffice it to say that these patterns are good for developing reliable and reusable  code and they are something that you will undoubtedly benefit from if you have  implemented them properly. Fortunately, the good JavaScript MVVM frameworks  make it easy by wiring up the components for you and letting you focus on the code  instead of the "plumbing".   The Kendo MVVM Framework  In the MVVM pattern for JavaScript through Kendo UI, you will need to create a  definition for the data that you want to display and manipulate  the Model , the  HTML markup that structures your overall web page  the View , and the JavaScript  code that handles user input, reacts to events, and transforms the static markup into  dynamic elements  the View-Model . Another way to put it is that you will have data   Model , presentation  View , and logic  View-Model .  In practice, the Model is the most loosely-defined portion of the MVVM pattern and  is not always even present as a unique entity in the implementation. The View-Model  can assume the role of both Model and View-Model by directly containing the Model  data properties within itself, instead of referencing them as a separate unit. This is  acceptable and is also seen within ASP.NET MVC when a View uses the ViewBag or  the ViewData collections instead of referencing a strongly-typed Model class. Don't let  it bother you if the Model isn't as well defined as the View-Model and the View. The  implementation of any pattern should be filtered down to what actually makes sense  for your application.  Simple data binding As an introductory example, consider that you have a web page that needs to display  a table of data, and also provide the users with the ability to interact with that data,  by clicking specifically on a single row or element. The data is dynamic, so you do  not know beforehand how many records will be displayed. Also, any change should  be reflected immediately on the page instead of waiting for a full page refresh from  the server. How do you make this happen?  A traditional approach would involve using special server-side controls that can  dynamically create tables from a data source and can even wire-up some JavaScript  interactivity. The problem with this approach is that it usually requires some  complicated extra communication between the server and the web browser either  through "view state", hidden fields, or long and ugly query strings. Also, the output  from these special controls is rarely easy to customize or manipulate in significant  ways and reduces the options for how your site should look and behave. Another  choice would be to create special JavaScript functions to asynchronously retrieve  data from an endpoint, generate HTML markup within a table and then wire up  events for buttons and links. This is a good solution, but requires a lot of coding and  complexity which means that it will likely take longer to debug and refine. It may  also be beyond the skill set of a given developer without significant research. The  third option, available through a JavaScript MVVM like Kendo UI, strikes a balance  between these two positions by reducing the complexity of the JavaScript but still  providing powerful and simple data binding features inside of the page.  [ 86 ]   Creating the view Here is a simple HTML page to show how a view basically works:  Chapter 4         MVVM Demo 1              th { width: 135px;    }          People Data       Name   Hair Color   Favorite Food      <tbody data-template="row-template"  data-bind="source: people">         Here we have a simple table element with three columns but instead of the body  containing any tr elements, there are some special HTML5 data-* attributes  indicating that something special is going on here. These data-* attributes do nothing  by themselves, but Kendo UI reads them  as you will see below  and interprets their  values in order to link the View with the View-Model. The data-bind attribute  indicates to Kendo UI that this element should be bound to a collection of objects   called people.   [ 87 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  The data-template attribute tells Kendo UI that the people objects should be  formatted using a Kendo UI template. Here is the code for the template:                    This is a simple template that defines a tr structure for each row within the table.   The td elements also have a data-bind attribute on them so that Kendo UI knows to  insert the value of a certain property as the "text" of the HTML element, which in this  case means placing the value in between   and   as simple text on the page.  Creating the Model and View-Model In order to wire this up, we need a View-Model that performs the data binding.   Here is the View-Model code for this View:    var viewModel = kendo.observable { people: [             {name: "John", hairColor: "Blonde", favoriteFood:  "Burger"},             {name: "Bryan", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood:  "Steak"},             {name: "Jennifer", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood:  "Salad"}         ]     } ; kendo.bind $ "body" , viewModel ;    A Kendo UI View-Model is declared through a call to kendo.observable   which  creates an observable object that is then used for the data-binding within the View.  An observable object is a special object that wraps a normal JavaScript variable with  events that fire any time the value of that variable changes. These events notify the  MVVM framework to update any data bindings that are using that variable's value,  so that they can update immediately and reflect the change. These data bindings also  work both ways so that if a field bound to an observable object variable is changed,  the variable bound to that field is also changed in real time.   [ 88 ]   Chapter 4  In this case, I created an array called people that contains three objects with  properties about some people. This array, then, operates as the Model in this  example since it contains the data and the definition of how the data is structured.  At the end of this code sample, you can see the call to kendo.bind $ "body" ,  viewModel  which is how Kendo UI actually performs its MVVM wiring. I passed  a jQuery selector for the body tag to the first parameter since this viewModel object  applies to the full body of my HTML page, not just a portion of it.  With everything combined, here is the full source for this simplified example:         MVVM Demo 1              th { width: 135px;         }          People Data       Name   Hair Color   Favorite Food      <tbody data-template="row-template"  data-bind="source: people">                      [ 89 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework    var viewModel = kendo.observable { people: [        {name: "John", hairColor: "Blonde", favoriteFood: "Burger"},        {name: "Bryan", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood: "Steak"}, { name: "Jennifer", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood: "Salad" }             ]         } ; kendo.bind $ "body" , viewModel ;        Here is a screenshot of the page in action. Note how the data from the JavaScript  people array is populated into the table automatically:  Even though this example contains a Model, a View, and a View-Model, all three  units appear in the same HTML file. You could separate the JavaScript into other  files, of course, but it is also acceptable to keep them together like this. Hopefully   you are already seeing what sort of things this MVVM framework can do for you.  Observable data binding Binding data into your HTML web page  View  using declarative attributes is great,  and very useful, but the MVVM framework offers some much more significant  functionality that we didn't see in the last example. Instead of simply attaching data to  the View and leaving it at that, the MVVM framework maintains a running copy of all  of the View-Model's properties, and keeps references to those properties up to date in  real time. This is why the View-Model is created with a function called "observable".  The properties inside, being observable, report changes back up the chain so that the  data-bound fields always reflect the latest data. Let's see some examples.  [ 90 ]   Chapter 4  Adding data dynamically Building on the example we just saw, add this horizontal rule and form just below  the table in the HTML page:       Add a Person  <input type="text" name="personName" placeholder="Name"  data-bind="value: personName"  >  <input type="text" name="personHairColor" placeholder="Hair Color"  data-bind="value: personHairColor"  >  <input type="text" name="personFavFood" placeholder="Favorite Food"  data-bind="value: personFavFood"  >   Add     This adds a form to the page so that a user can enter data for a new person that  should appear in the table. Note that we have added some data-bind attributes, but  this time we are binding the value of the input fields not the text. Note also that we  have added a data-bind attribute to the button at the bottom of the form that binds  the click event of that button with a function inside our View-Model. By binding  the click event to the addPerson JavaScript method, the addPerson method will be  fired every time this button is clicked.  These bindings keep the value of those input fields linked with the View-Model object  at all times. If the value in one of these input fields changes, such as when a user types  something in the box, the View-Model object will immediately see that change and  update its properties to match; it will also update any areas of the page that are bound  to the value of that property so that they match the new data as well.  The binding for the button is special because it allows the View-Model object to  attach its own event handler to the click event for this element. Binding an event  handler to an event is nothing special by itself, but it is important to do it this way   through the data-bind attribute  so that the specific running View-Model instance  inside of the page has attached one of its functions to this event so that the code  inside the event handler has access to this specific View-Model's data properties and  values. It also allows for a very specific context to be passed to the event that would  be very hard to access otherwise.  [ 91 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  Here is the code I added to the View-Model just below the people array. The first  three properties that we have in this example are what make up the Model. They  contain that data that is observed and bound to the rest of the page:  personName: "",          Model property personHairColor: "",     Model property personFavFood: "",       Model property addPerson: function    { this.get "people" .push { name: this.get "personName" , hairColor: this.get "personHairColor" , favoriteFood: this.get "personFavFood"  } ; this.set "personName", "" ; this.set "personHairColor", "" ; this.set "personFavFood", "" ; }  The first several properties you see are the same properties that we are binding to in  the input form above. They start with an empty value because the form should not  have any values when the page is first loaded. It is still important to declare these  empty properties inside the View-Model in order that their value can be tracked  when it changes.  The function after the data properties, addPerson, is what we have bound to the click  event of the button in the input form. Here in this function we are accessing the people  array and adding a new record to it based on what the user has supplied in the form  fields. Notice that we have to use the this.get   and this.set   functions to access  the data inside of our View-Model. This is important because the properties in this  View-Model are special observable properties so accessing their values directly may  not give you the results you would expect.  The most significant thing that you should notice about the addPerson function is  that it is interacting with the data on the page through the View-Model properties.  It is not using jQuery, document.querySelector, or any other DOM interaction  to read the value of the elements! Since we declared a data-bind attribute on the  values of the input elements to the properties of our View-Model, we can always   get the value from those elements by accessing the View-Model itself. The values   are tracked at all times. This allows us to both retrieve and then change those   View-Model properties inside the addPerson function and the HTML page will  show the changes right as it happens. By calling this.set   on the properties and  changing their values to an empty string, the HTML page will clear the values that  the user just typed and added to the table. Once again, we change the View-Model  properties without needing access to the HTML ourselves.  [ 92 ]   Here is the complete source of this example:  Chapter 4         MVVM Demo 2              th { width: 135px;         }          People Data       Name   Hair Color   Favorite Food       <  tbody>        Add a Person  <input type="text" name="personName" placeholder="Name" data- bind="value: personName"  >  <input type="text" name="personHairColor" placeholder="Hair Color"  data-bind="value: personHairColor"  >  <input type="text" name="personFavFood" placeholder="Favorite Food"  data-bind="value: personFavFood"  >   Add                  [ 93 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework        var viewModel = kendo.observable { people: [                 {name: "John", hairColor: "Blonde", favoriteFood:  "Burger"},                 {name: "Bryan", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood:  "Steak"},                 {name: "Jennifer", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood:  "Salad"}             ], personName: "", personHairColor: "", personFavFood: "", addPerson: function    { this.get "people" .push { name: this.get "personName" , hairColor: this.get "personHairColor" , favoriteFood: this.get "personFavFood"                  } ; this.set "personName", "" ; this.set "personHairColor", "" ; this.set "personFavFood", "" ;             }         } ; kendo.bind $ "body" , viewModel ;        [ 94 ]   And here is a screenshot of the page in action. You will see that one additional  person has been added to the table by filling out the form. Try it out yourself to   see the immediate interaction that you get with this code:  Chapter 4  Using observable properties in the View We just saw how simple it is to add new data to observable collections in the   View-Model, and how this causes any data-bound elements to immediately   show that new data. Let's add some more functionality to illustrate working   with individual elements and see how their observable values can update content   on the page.  To demonstrate this new functionality, I have added some columns to the table:     People Data       Name   Hair Color   Favorite Food      Live Data       <  tbody>    [ 95 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  The first new column has no heading text but will contain a button on the page for  each of the table rows. The second new column will be displaying the value of the  "live data" in the View-Model for each of the objects displayed in the table.  Here is the updated row template:                   <button type="button"  data-bind="click: deletePerson">Delete      &nbsp;-&nbsp;   &nbsp;-&nbsp;          Notice that I have replaced all of the simple text data-bind attributes with input  elements and valuedata-bind attributes. I also added a button with a clickdata- bind attribute and a column that displays the text of the three properties so that you  can see the observable behavior in real time.  The View-Model gets a new method for the delete button:  deletePerson: function  e  { var person = e.data; var people = this.get "people" ; var index = people.indexOf person ; people.splice index, 1 ; }  When this function is called through the binding that Kendo UI has created, it passes  an event argument, here called e, into the function that contains a data property. This  data property is a reference to the model object that was used to render the specific  row of data. In this function, I created a person variable for a reference to the person  in this row and a reference to the people array; we then use the index of this person  to splice it out of the array. When you click on the Delete button, you can observe  the table reacting immediately to the change.  Here is the full source code of the updated View-Model:           [ 96 ]   Chapter 4      <input  type="text" data-bind="value: favoriteFood"  >   <button type="button" data-bind="click: deletePerson">Delete      &nbsp;-&nbsp;   &nbsp;-&nbsp;         var viewModel = kendo.observable { people: [         {name: "John", hairColor: "Blonde", favoriteFood: "Burger"},         {name: "Bryan", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood: "Steak"},         {name: "Jennifer", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood: "Salad"}             ], personName: "", personHairColor: "", personFavFood: "", addPerson: function    { this.get "people" .push { name: this.get "personName" , hairColor: this.get "personHairColor" , favoriteFood: this.get "personFavFood"                  } ; this.set "personName", "" ; this.set "personHairColor", "" ; this.set "personFavFood", "" ;             }, deletePerson: function  e  { var person = e.data; var people = this.get "people" ; var index = people.indexOf person ; people.splice index, 1 ;             }         } ; kendo.bind $ "body" , viewModel ;        [ 97 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  Here is a screenshot of the new page:  Click on the Delete button to see an entry disappear. You can also see that I have  added a new person to the table and that I have made changes in the input boxes   of the table and that those changes immediately show up on the right-hand side.   This indicates that the View-Model is keeping track of the live data and updating   its bindings accordingly.  Making better use of observable arrays In the last several examples, we have been using an array called people to show a  dynamic table with Kendo UI bindings. This has worked fine so far, but with more  complicated Models and functionality we can run into a wall, so to speak. For example,  there is no way to have the "live data" come from the Model objects themselves; we  had to concatenate three span elements in the template to form the final output. This  could cause problems for more complicated and full-featured pages, where you may  have an array of Model objects that need to be able to handle events and calculate  values on their own, instead of at the View-Model level.  Modify the row template like this:                   <button type="button"  data-bind="click: deletePerson">Delete       [ 98 ]   Chapter 4       We have changed the property names in the data-bind declaration so that they  point to an inner property that we created for them, called stuff. The important part  of the example is that we also changed the final column to point to a calculated value  function called dataString. The meaning of this will become clear as we continue.  Next, update the JavaScript block for the View-Model so that it looks like this:    var viewModel = kendo.observable { people: [], personName: "", personHairColor: "", personFavFood: "", addPerson: function    { this.get "people" .push new person { name: this.get "personName" , hairColor: this.get "personHairColor" , favoriteFood: this.get "personFavFood"              }  ; this.set "personName", "" ; this.set "personHairColor", "" ; this.set "personFavFood", "" ;         }, deletePerson: function  e  { var person = e.data; var people = this.get "people" ; var index = people.indexOf person ; people.splice index, 1 ;         }     } ;  var person = function  data  { var self = this; this.name = kendo.observable { stuff: data.name } ; this.hairColor = kendo.observable { stuff: data.hairColor } ; this.favoriteFood = kendo.observable { stuff: data.favoriteFood } ; this.dataString = function    { returnself.name.get "stuff"  + " - " +  self.hairColor.get "stuff"  + " - " + self.favoriteFood.get "stuff" ;         }     };  [ 99 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  viewModel.get "people" .push new person { name: "John",  hairColor: "Blonde", favoriteFood: "Burger" }  ; viewModel.get "people" .push new person { name: "Bryan",  hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood: "Steak" }  ; viewModel.get "people" .push new person { name: "Jennifer", hairColor:"Brown", favoriteFood: "Salad" }  ;  kendo.bind $ "body" , viewModel ;    We made several changes, so let's step through them carefully. The first important  change is right at the top, where we have replaced the static array declaration with  the people property as an empty array with the bracket notation []. Secondly, we  created a new type of object called person and gave it a constructor function with its  own internal observable objects. Each of these observable objects needs an object to  manage, simple values don't work quite as well, so we made an arbitrary property  for them called stuff. The only thing going on here is that the properties of this new  person object type are pointing to observable objects instead of simple data. Why?  Because if the properties are not observable, then the View-Model will not be notified  of the change and the user interface will not be updated through data-binding.  The purpose of this change is to enable calculated values local to the specific instance  of the object, which we have done with the dataString function inside of the person  constructor. As you can see, the dataString function extracts the values from the  locally observable properties and returns them as a formatted string. This is significant  because it means that every person object has its own copy of this function, and that  the View-Model itself is not involved in this calculation. This means that each object  inside of the View-Model's people array can observe changes specific to itself and  calculate values based on those changes. This type of Model can become very useful  for advanced scenarios.  After declaring the person constructor function, we manually added some new  person objects to the people array and then called kendo.bind   as usual. When  rendered, the page looks and behaves just as it did in the previous example, but now  the Model objects are smarter. Here is the full source code of the updated View-Model:                   <button type="button"   [ 100 ]   Chapter 4  data-bind="click: deletePerson">Delete            var viewModel = kendo.observable { people: [], personName: "", personHairColor: "", personFavFood: "", addPerson: function    { this.get "people" .push new person { name: this.get "personName" , hairColor: this.get "personHairColor" , favoriteFood: this.get "personFavFood"                  }  ; this.set "personName", "" ; this.set "personHairColor", "" ; this.set "personFavFood", "" ;             }, deletePerson: function  e  { var person = e.data; var people = this.get "people" ; var index = people.indexOf person ; people.splice index, 1 ;             }         } ;  var person = function  data  { var self = this;             this.name = kendo.observable { d: data.name } ; this.hairColor = kendo.observable { d: data.hairColor } ; this.favoriteFood = kendo.observable { d: data.favoriteFood } ; this.dataString = function    { returnself.name.get "d"  + " - " + self.hairColor.get "d"  + " - " + self.favoriteFood.get "d" ;             }         };  viewModel.get "people" .push new person { name: "John", hairColor: "Blonde", favoriteFood: "Burger"         }  ; viewModel.get "people" .push new person {  [ 101 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  name: "Bryan", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood: "Steak"         }  ; viewModel.get "people" .push new person { name: "Jennifer", hairColor: "Brown", favoriteFood: "Salad"         }  ;  kendo.bind $ "body" , viewModel ;        And the output when the page is run:  Data-bind properties for Kendo MVVM There are thirteen different types of values that can be used inside of the data-bind  Kendo UI attribute. Here is a summary of their definitions and uses.  The attr property The attr property is used to bind the value of a View-Model to a specific HTML  attribute of a page element. For example, this is very useful for setting attributes   such as the src for an image or the href for an anchor tag.  [ 102 ]   Chapter 4  ...   View-Model definition imageSource: 'http:  www.images.com randomImage.jpg', ...    A binding like this would guarantee that the image would change along with the  View-Model to allow for dynamically loading or changing images on a web page.  Note that the attr property can set multiple attributes at once when they are  separated by commas like this:  data-bind="attr: {attribute1: value, attribute2: value, attribute3:  value, ...}"  This property can be used with any HTML element and with any valid HTML  attribute  including custom HTML5 data-* attributes .  The checked property The checked property is used to bind the checked status of an input element with  type checkbox or radio. For checkboxes, the data-bound property can be either a  Boolean  true false  value or an array. For radio selections, the property needs to  be a string. For example:  isChecked: true, ...     Simple Boolean binding    The data-bound property will be updated when the user clicks the  checkbox     animals: ["cow", "pig"], ...     Array binding for checkboxes    The array will change based on which checkboxes are checked by the  user    The initial page will show both the "cow" and "pig" inputs as  checked         tablet: "surface", ...  [ 103 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework     String binding for radio buttons    The string will change based on which radio option is selected by  the user    The initial page will show the input with the value "surface" as  checked  <input type="radio" name="tablet" value="surface" data-bind="checked:  tablet"  > <input type="radio" name="tablet" value="ipad" data-bind="checked:  tablet"  > <input type="radio" name="tablet" value="android" data-bind="checked:  tablet"  >  As you will see later, the checked binding can be very useful in conjunction with the  visible invisible bindings so that the checkboxes or radio buttons on the page  will dynamically show or hide other portions of the page.  The click property The click property binds the click event of a button to a function inside of the  View-Model. It is a shortcut to the events binding that we will see later. Unlike  a traditional click event wire-up, the Kendo UI framework will pass context data  to the event handler to allow for a richer event-handling experience. For example,  when a click event is bound within a row template, the event argument passed to the  event handler will have access to the item from the source collection. This allows the  event handler to operate against that Model data directly without any further DOM  exploration and keeps all of the observable functionality in place.  Technically, Kendo UI supplies the DOM event wrapped in a jQuery event  object to the event handler indicated in the binding, but it also manages the data  property like we talked about in the previous paragraph. Since the event argument  is still connected to the DOM event, you can call stopPropogation   and  preventDefault   on that event argument to stop the DOM from performing any  other actions in the page.  We already saw examples of the click binding in our code samples above so here  are some of the snippets that we used there:     Our example row template that included the click binding that will    pass the data property to the event handler              [ 104 ]   Chapter 4       <button type="button"  data-bind="click: deletePerson">Delete              Our example form that included the click binding that has no    relevant data property to pass to the event handler    Add a Person  <input type="text" name="personName" placeholder="Name"  data-bind="value: personName"  >  <input type="text" name="personHairColor" placeholder="Hair Color"  data-bind="value: personHairColor"  >  <input type="text" name="personFavFood" placeholder="Favorite Food"  data-bind="value: personFavFood"  >   Add     ...     This version of the click binding does not use the event argument addPerson: function    { this.get "people" .push new person { name: this.get "personName" , hairColor: this.get "personHairColor" , favoriteFood: this.get "personFavFood"      }  ; this.set "personName", "" ; this.set "personHairColor", "" ; this.set "personFavFood", "" ; },     This version of the click binding uses the event argument to    current data item from the source collection deletePerson: function  e  { var person = e.data; var people = this.get "people" ; var index = people.indexOf person ; people.splice index, 1 ; }  [ 105 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  The custom property Kendo UI allows for custom bindings so that you can create custom behaviors related  to the View-Model of your page. An example on the Kendo UI documentation site uses  a jQuery UI slideDown and slideUp call based on a Boolean value in the View-Model  as a short-cut to some UI transformations. Refer to the Kendo UI documentation for a  more detailed API reference for custom bindings.  The disabled enabled properties The disabled and enabled bindings work on input, select, and text area HTML  elements. Just as their names would indicate, they disable or enable the bound  elements respectively. These bindings are designed for use with Boolean properties,  but for the sake of JavaScript loose-typing they will consider the non-Boolean values  0, null, undefined, and ""  empty string  as false and all other non-Boolean values  as true. An example code is as follows:  allowEdit: false, ...     This input element will be initially disabled until the   View-Model's allowEdit    View-Model's allowEdit property is changed to true    The events property The events binding is a convenient way to wire-up event handlers in your   View-Model to events on HTML elements in your View. The click binding,   as we saw above, is a specific example of this pattern and operates in exactly   the same way. For example:  <button type="button" data-bind="events: {blur: blurHandler, click:  clickHandler, mouseover: mouseHandler,...}">Interactive Button   The html text properties The html binding sets the innerHtml content of an HTML element using the value of  a property from the View-Model. This binding differs from the text binding in that  it does not encode HTML tags before generating its output, which means that HTML  tags in the View-Model property will be rendered as HTML instead of as text  which  is probably what you want if you are using the html binding . An example:  spanContent: " Some Content ",...  [ 106 ]   Chapter 4      This would generate output like this in the source of the rendered page:    Some Content    The text binding works in exactly the same way as the html binding, except that it  sets the simple text between element tags and it does encode HTML before output,  so do not put HTML in the property containing the text to display unless you want  the tags to show as part of the text output.  The invisible visible properties The invisible and visible bindings work on HTML elements that you want to  either show or hide dynamically. Just as their names indicate, they make the given  element invisible or visible respectively. These bindings are designed for use with  Boolean properties, but for the sake of JavaScript loose-typing they will consider the  non-Boolean values 0, null, undefined, and ""  empty string  as false and all other  non-Boolean values as true. An example code is as follows:  showDetails: true, ...     This element will be initially visible unless the View-Model's    showDetails property is changed to false  All sorts of text here...   As mentioned earlier, it can be very useful to connect the value of a checkbox or a  radio button with the visible status of other elements on a page. This allows you to  change what data is displayed on the page based on selections that the user makes.  Here is a simple example:  showDetails: false, ...  <input type="checkbox" data-bind="checked: showDetails"  name="showDetails"  >   All sorts of text and details…   This code will make the checkbox control the visibility of the paragraph element that  would contain some text that you only want displayed if the checkbox is checked.  This is probably simpler than code you would use in a normal web application,   but it illustrates the basic point.  [ 107 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  The source property The source binding is designed to render a Kendo UI template using the value of  a View-Model property. If the property is an array, then the Kendo UI framework  will render the template for each element of the array. This template is specified by  the data-template attribute attached to the HTML element in question, and should  indicate the template by its id attribute. When the templates are rendered, they will  be placed directly beneath the element with the source attribute in the DOM. This is  why you would place the source attribute on the tbody element of a table so that the  tr elements in the Kendo UI template will be rendered and placed directly beneath it  in the DOM so that they will appear as rows in a table. This binding can work on any  element where it makes sense to include a collection of lower level elements, a table is  just a natural example; other good uses would be ul, ol, and select elements.  We saw the source binding with a table already in our code samples. I will paste a  little of it here as a reminder:     table with the source binding on the tbody element    People Data       Name   Hair Color   Favorite Food      Live Data       <  tbody>   ...    the template that creates the rows                  <button type="button"  data-bind="click: deletePerson">Delete           [ 108 ]   This is a good example of using the source binding with an array of objects. The  source binding can also be used with an array of simple values, in which case you  would use the keyword this inside the template instead of a property name inside  an object:  Chapter 4              The source binding can also be used with a single object  as opposed to an array  in  which case it behaves just like binding to an array with a single element. You can also  bind to the View-Model itself if you want to access a single property within it as the  source, in which case you reference the source as a property of the this keyword:     table with the source binding on the tbody element    People Data       Name   Hair Color   Favorite Food      Live Data       <  tbody>   ...    the template that creates the rows                  <button type="button"  data-bind="click: deletePerson">Delete          ...    [ 109 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  var viewModel = kendo.observable { name: "john", hairColor: "blonde", favoriteFood: "burger"     } ; ...    Notice how the structure is the same as if you were referencing a single object, but  we are using the this keyword since we are referencing the View-Model directly.  When binding to a select element, note that you can use an array of simple values  or an array of objects. If you just an array of objects, use the data-text-field to  indicate which property contains the text to display within each option, and use  the data-value-field to indicate which property contains the value within each  option element.  The style property The style binding is a great way to create a dynamic relationship between data in  your View-Model and CSS styles on your page. It is a very simple binding that  creates a direct relationship between the properties in your View-Model and the  styles in your markup. An example:      var viewModel = kendo.observable { myColor: "orange", myFontWeight: "bold"     } ;    Obviously, this becomes a lot more useful if you tie some logic to the styles you  are using in your page, such as changing the styles for alternating table rows or  changing the color of text if it meets some special criteria  such as an overdrawn  balance looking red .  Notice that we used the style property fontWeight which should look strange to you.  If you need to reference styles that normally contain a hyphen  font-weight , you  need to use a camel-cased version in the binding so that it works as a valid JavaScript  property name. So font-weight becomes fontWeight in the actual binding statement.  Finally, if you set the style value to an empty string, it will reset the value back to its  original setting.  [ 110 ]   Chapter 4  The value property The value binding works in a very similar way to the text binding, except that it  sets the value of an input element instead of the text of a display element. The bound  value in the View-Model is updated on blur by default, such as when you press Tab  to leave the input element on the page. If you want the View-Model property to  be updated based on a different DOM event, you can set that in the data-value- update property on the same element as the binding. We have already seen the   use of the value binding in our code samples. Here is an example of using the   data-value-update binding to customize some behavior:     the row template      <input type="text" data-bind="value: name"              data-value-update="keyup"  >       Remember that this is a two-way binding and is most useful for retrieving data from  the users as they fill out a form.  Much like the checked binding that we saw above, the value binding works with  select elements in a similar way. By binding the value of a select element to a  string property, it will be bound to the value of the selected option element inside  of the select element if the options have values, or the text of the selected option  element if no value is present. Here is how this would look in the markup:     Binding using the value, the selectedCar property will be bound to  the numbers    Honda   Toyota   Ford        Binding using the text, the selectedCar property will be bound to  the text    between the option tags    Honda   Toyota   Ford     [ 111 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  Of course, you can also bind both the source and the value of a select element to  the View-Model. You are not limited to a single binding in the data-bind property.  Also, as you might expect, you can bind the value of a multiple-select element if  you are binding it to an array  instead of a simple string  so that it can hold multiple  values.  Declarative widgets through Data-Role  MVVM attributes Kendo's MVVM also allows declarative initialization of widgets through the   data-role attribute. Declarative initialization is a different method of creating   Kendo widgets by using the data-role attribute instead of setting up the widget  through JavaScript. This is not as flexible as the JavaScript method, but it does allow  for a lot of functionality with almost no code at all. Here is a section of code taken from  the Kendo UI Web website that shows some basic set up as an introduction. The full  details for these widgets can be found there.       Widget         AutoComplete  <input data-role="autocomplete" data-text-field="name"  data-bind="source: colors, value: autoCompleteValue" >          ComboBox  <select data-role="combobox" data-text-field="name" data-value-field="value" data-bind="source: colors, value: comboBoxValue">           DatePicker         [ 112 ]   Chapter 4       DropDownList  <select data-role="dropdownlist" data-text-field="name" data-value-field="value" data-bind="source: colors, value: dropDownListValue">           Grid  <div data-role="grid" data-sortable="true" data-editable="true" data-columns='["Name", "Price", "UnitsInStock",  {"command": "destroy"}]' data-bind="source: gridSource">           NumericTextBox  <input data-role="numerictextbox" data-format="c"  data-bind="value: numericTextBoxValue"  >          Slider             TimePicker             TabStrip       First   Second       First page:   [ 113 ]   The Kendo MVVM Framework  Pick a time: <input data-role="timepicker"  data-bind="value: timePickerValue" >      Second page:  Time is: <span data-bind="text: displayTimePickerValue">               TreeView  <div data-role="treeview" data-animation="false" data-drag-and-drop="true" data-bind="source: treeviewSource">         This is a great example of using multiple bindings together, and of which bindings  rightly pertain to which widgets.  Summary The Kendo MVVM framework brings complicated interactive JavaScript into the  realm of simple HTML attributes, templates, and View-Model functions. It is a very  powerful feature and is one that you are likely to become very accustomed to using  in your web pages. Keep in mind as you develop code that Kendo is a system in  which features can be built together very nicely; for example, you could use a Kendo  data source object as the source binding for a table or select list.  When you have powerful tools like this within your reach, you will find that  function-rich pages become normal instead of exceptionally difficult and that your  programming experience will be better than ever. In the next chapter, we will learn  about the Kendo UI HTML Editor widget. This widget adds a full-featured HTML  editing box to your web pages so that users can create content in a friendly input  area with formatting, images, and hyperlinks. It is especially useful if users can  contribute content on your site, such as with a blog or a forum.  [ 114 ]   HTML Editor and Custom  Tools  Interactive HTML editors are an important part of any website that encourages  users to post their own written content. Forums and blogs frequently offer these  controls so that users can create content with attractive styling just as if it was  created in a word processor. It is especially useful for users who are unfamiliar with  how to format text using HTML tags or CSS styles. For that matter, even users who  are familiar with HTML and CSS can appreciate not having to type it all out. This  chapter will introduce the following topics:     Kendo Editor widget basics    Configuring the Editor widget tools    Using HTML snippets    Customizing the Editor widget tools  Understanding the HTML Editor The Kendo Editor widget  creates an area on a web page where a user can create  formatted text content. To see a basic example in action, copy this code into a new  HTML page called HtmlEditor.html. This will allow you to see the widget in use   on an actual page and will provide a starting point for the rest of the chapter.                     HTML Editor and Custom Tools      textarea { width: 100%; height: 300px;         }                    $ document .ready function    {             $ "editor" .kendoEditor  ;         } ;        This is assuming all default settings since no settings or options are explicitly set.  Note that we have bound the kendoEditor function to a  textarea element, this is important and you should always  bind HTML Editor controls to a textarea element so that the  functionality can degrade gracefully for browsers that may not  support the required JavaScript features.  If we had implemented this using ASP.NET MVC, it would look like this in the view:  @using Kendo.Mvc.UI;  @{ ViewBag.Title = "Html Editor"; }   textarea { width: 100%; height: 300px;     }     Html Editor  @ Html.Kendo  .Editor           .Name "htmlEditor"    [ 116 ]   Note again that the Kendo MVC extensions will generate the HTML Editor within a  textarea element, which is why the style declaration for textarea elements works  in the page output.  Regardless of whether you use HTML or an MVC view, this is how the page output  looks with all defaults assumed. I have added some text using the HTML Editor  features to illustrate the purpose of the control:  Chapter 5  Take a look at all of the tool buttons across the top of the Editor widget. Click on  them as you type text to observe what they do. Also, note that the different buttons  generated by the Kendo HTML Editor all support the HTML tabindex so you  can use the Tab key and the Shift + Tab key combination to move back and forth  respectively between the commands in order if you want.  For many sites, this is probably sufficient functionality already. To use the formatted  text that the user has created, simply retrieve the value of the textarea element and  it will contain both the content and HTML markup.  Don't forget to check your input Since you are openly allowing the user to post HTML markup within  the content of his or her data, take extra care to sanitize the input before  you place it into a database or load it into another page. Even though  the HTML markup generated by the Kendo tool is safe, you can never  trust the final markup that is transmitted to the server from the user's  browser and must always treat it as if it may contain harmful code.  Before you use the formatted text, however, you also need to check whether the  value you are processing has been HTML encoded or not. If you retrieve the raw  value of the textarea element from the DOM, you will get HTML encoded data.  This means that  text  becomes &lt;strong&gt;text&lt;  strong&gt; which may or may not be what you actually want.   [ 117 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  To get the non-HTML encoded data, you need to call the value   function on the  kendoEditor object by using code like this:  var editor = $ "editor" .data "kendoEditor" ; var nonEncodedText = editor.value  ;  But again, you need to be careful with what you are doing. You cannot post  non-HTML encoded data like this to most web servers without bypassing some  important security measures. The safer option would be to post the data to the web  server in an HTML encoded form, then decode it and sanitize on the server-side  before using it. This way you can still rightly reject some potentially malicious code  from the page outright before starting the process of interpreting the user input.  Here is an updated page with some buttons that show you the different outputs   from the DOM val   function versus the kendoEditor value   function:                       textarea { width: 100%; height: 300px;         }           Show Kendo  Value    Show HTML  Value            $ document .ready function    {             $ "editor" .kendoEditor  ;             $ "showHtmlVal" .click function    { alert $ "editor" .val   ;             } ; var editor = $ "editor" .data "kendoEditor" ;             $ "showKendoVal" .click function    {  [ 118 ]   Chapter 5  alert editor.value   ;             } ;         } ;        This is the text retrieved from the Kendo value   function.  This is the text retrieved from the innerHTML of the Editor Widget.  [ 119 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  Adding and removing buttons from the  toolbar There are a few more standard tools that are available in the HTML Editor toolbar  that are not included by default:  To include these tools, you need to specify the tools property when you create   the kendoEditor object like this and list the specific tools that you want displayed:     Subscript    Superscript    View HTML  $ "editor" .kendoEditor { tools: [ "bold", "italic", "underline", "strikethrough", "fontName", "fontSize", "foreColor", "backColor", "justifyLeft", "justifyCenter", "justifyRight", "justifyFull", "insertUnorderedList", "insertOrderedList", "indent", "outdent", "formatBlock", "createLink", "unlink", "insertImage", "subscript", "superscript", "viewHtml" ] } ;  [ 120 ]   If you specify tools you need to name all the standard tools too, if you leave any out  they will be removed from the toolbar on your page. Conversely, here is how you  would add the subscript and superscript tools using ASP.NET MVC, curiously the  viewHtml is not available in this method:  Chapter 5  @ Html.Kendo  .Editor   .Name "htmlEditor"  .Tools tools => tools .SubScript   .SuperScript      It could hardly be more concise, especially since with this method all of the default  tools are assumed and you only have to add those that you want to include. If you  wanted to clear out the default list of tools and then add only those that you want,  you would first call Clear   within the Tools lambda expression and then add the  specific tools that you wanted afterwards.  Here is the output with all of the standard tools included:  Adding the Styles tool The Styles tool can be added to the HTML Editor toolbar to give the user access to  some predefined styles that you have created. This could be useful if your users are  using a special theme or if there are global styles that you want the users to have easy  access to. To enable this, you configure the tools through the kendoEditor object and  specify which options should appear in a drop-down list of styles. Here is an example:  $ "editor" .kendoEditor { tools: [ "bold", "italic", "underline",  [ 121 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  "strikethrough", "fontName", "fontSize", "foreColor", "backColor", "justifyLeft", "justifyCenter", "justifyRight", "justifyFull", "insertUnorderedList", "insertOrderedList", "indent", "outdent", "formatBlock", "createLink", "unlink", "insertImage", "subscript", "superscript", "viewHtml", "style" ], style:[ {text: "Big Blue", value:"bigBlue"}, {text: "Dark Grey", value:"darkGrey"} ], stylesheets:[ "css StyleTool.css" ] } ;  Here are the contents of the StyleTool.css file:  .bigBlue { font-size:large; color:blue; } .darkGrey { color:white; background-color:111111; }  [ 122 ]   Chapter 5  To make this work, I added the Style tool to the list of tools and then added the  style configuration property and the optional stylesheets configuration property.  The style configuration property defines the different options that appear in the  Styles drop-down list, and which CSS classnames should be applied when these  styles are selected for some text in the HTML editor textarea. The stylesheets  configuration option allows you to import some additional stylesheets if they are  necessary to display your custom styles.  Here is how you would implement these styles using ASP.NET MVC:  @ Html.Kendo  .Editor   .Name "htmlEditor"  .Tools tools => tools .SubScript   .SuperScript   .Styles styles => styles .Add "Big Blue", "bigBlue"  .Add "Dark Grey", "darkGrey"     .StyleSheets css =>css .Add " Content StyleTool.css"      Here is the output from this code:  I included some styled text for the sake of demonstration and clicked on the Styles  drop-down list to show how the options in that list are also styled to match their  respective CSS classes.  [ 123 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  Tool for inserting HTML snippets The Snippets tool is a special toolbar option that is designed to insert predefined blocks  of text into the editor window with a single click. It can be used for adding canned  responses to common questions, signature blocks, time stamps, or any number of  scenarios where pre-typed text would be useful. To enable this, just like the Styles  option you configure the tools through the kendoEditor object and specify which  options should appear in a drop-down list of styles. Here is an example:  $ "editor" .kendoEditor { tools: [ "bold", "italic", "underline", "strikethrough", "fontName", "fontSize", "foreColor", "backColor", "justifyLeft", "justifyCenter", "justifyRight", "justifyFull", "insertUnorderedList", "insertOrderedList", "indent", "outdent", "formatBlock", "createLink", "unlink", "insertImage", "subscript", "superscript", "viewHtml", "style", "insertHtml" ], style:[ {text: "Big Blue", value:"bigBlue"}, {text: "Dark Grey", value:"darkGrey"} ], stylesheets:[ "css StyleTool.css" ],  [ 124 ]   Chapter 5  insertHtml:[ { text: "Today's date", value: "December 7, 2012" }, { text: "Signature", value: " Sincerely, John Adams " } ] } ;  Notice that this requires very little configuration to enable. We have included  the insertHtml option in the tools configuration property and then added the  insertHtml configuration property at the end of the kendoEditor definition. Inside  the insertHtml configuration property, we have included an array of very simple  objects. They define the title of each item that should appear in the drop-down list  and the exact mark-up that should be pasted into the HTML Editor when the title   is selected.  Here is how you would implement these Snippets using ASP.NET MVC:  @ Html.Kendo  .Editor   .Name "htmlEditor"  .Tools tools => tools .SubScript   .SuperScript   .Styles styles => styles .Add "Big Blue", "bigBlue"  .Add "Dark Grey", "darkGrey"   .Snippets snippets => snippets .Add "Today's Date", DateTime.Today.Date.ToShortDateString    .Add "Signature", " Sincerely, John Adams "     .StyleSheets css =>css .Add " Content StyleTool.css"      Here is the output from this code:  [ 125 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  Customizing HTML Editor tools The Kendo HTML Editor control allows you to add your own custom options to  the toolbar. This is a remarkable touch of flexibility in the Kendo UI framework,  and is something that you may find quite useful if the available built-in tools do  not completely suit your needs. The HTML Editor can accept at least three types  of custom tools. There could be more but these three appear in the published  documentation on the Kendo UI website:     Override Built-in Tools    Custom Template Tools    Custom In-line Tools  Drop-down list tools If you would like to alter some of the built-in drop-down list tools, you can redefine  which options appear inside them. This does not alter the nature of the tools or  what the tools do. It only determines which options appear in the drop-down  lists of the tools when you click on them. As an example, consider limiting which  options appear in the font tool. By replacing the contents of the items array, you can  customize exactly which options appear in the tool when it displays on the page:  $ "editor" .kendoEditor { tools: [ { name: "fontName", items:  [{text:"Garamond", value: "Garamond, serif"}, {text:"Calibri", value:"calibri, sans-serif"}] } ] } ;  This code sample demonstrates a customized fontName tool limited to two specific  options. These two fonts are not included in the default fontName tool as we saw  before, but you could also include default fonts in this custom list as well. Here is   the output of the HTML Editor configured with this custom tool:  [ 126 ]   Chapter 5  You will notice that the first two options in the list are not options that I defined in my  source code—inherited font and Verdana. These appear because the HTML Editor is  enabling the font on the page from the outer containing HTML markup and is calling  it the inherited font. It then labels this same font by name in case that helps the user  make a font selection, so inherited font and Verdana are actually both referring to the  same font inherited from the outer HTML markup of the overall page.  This type of custom tool configuration should work with any of the custom tools that  appear as a drop-down list such as the font name, font size, and format block tools.  Button tools It seems unlikely that you will need to override many of these controls since it would  probably be more effective to create your own tool instead. Just in case you wanted  to see how it was done, however, here is a sample of code taken from the Kendo UI  website that demonstrates how to replace the viewHtml tool with custom code that  replaces its functionality:            Update   Cancel           [ 127 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  $ "editor" .kendoEditor { tools:  [{ name: "viewHtml", tooltip: "View HTML", exec: function e  { var editor = $ this .data "kendoEditor" ;  var dialog = $ $ "viewHtml-template" .html    .find "textarea" .val editor.value   .end   .find ".viewHtml-update"  .click function   { editor.value dialog.element .find "textarea" .val   ; dialog.close  ; }  .end   .find ".viewHtml-cancel"  .click function   { dialog.close  ; }  .end   .kendoWindow { modal: true, title: "View HTML", deactivate: function   { dialog.destroy  ; } } .data "kendoWindow" ;  dialog.center  .open  ; } }] }     [ 128 ]   Here is the code as it appears on the page:  Chapter 5  This source code includes both a template and the kendoEditor configuration.   You can see that this code is basically opening a dialog, filling it with the content  from the HTML Editor control, wiring up the events for the buttons inside the dialog,  and then displaying it to the user. It gives an example, at least, of what overriding  one of the built-in tools looks like. Note that the logic for the tool's execution is   inside a property called exec; this is common for all custom button tools as well.   The tooltip property is the text that is displayed when the mouse is hovered over   the button in the toolbar.  Custom template tools If you want to create your own custom tool that has a drop-down list of options, the  custom template tool is the best choice. It allows you to use a Kendo UI template to  markup how the tool should be displayed on the toolbar, and you can wire up its  functionality separately so that your tool can do whatever it needs to do:      Show Kendo  Value    Show HTML  Value     Editor BG:    None<  option> Blue  Green<  option>      $ document .ready function    { $ "editor" .kendoEditor { tools: [ {  [ 129 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  name: "editorBackground", template: $ "editorColor-template" .html   } ] } ; $ "showHtmlVal" .click function    { alert $ "editor" .val   ; } ; var editor = $ "editor" .data "kendoEditor" ; $ "showKendoVal" .click function    { alert editor.value   ; } ; $ "customTool" .change function  e  { $ "editor" .data "kendoEditor" .body.style.backgroundColor = $ "customTool" .val  ; } ; } ;    You can see the Kendo template where the label and select elements are declared.  The behavior for the select element is defined in the jQuery code, but the custom  drop-down list tool is added to the HTML Editor through the tools property.  Here is the output of the page with this custom tool:  [ 130 ]   Chapter 5  This is how you create custom tools that behave as a drop-down list. As you can see,  the behavior is left completely up to you so you, can create whatever tool you need  for your site's use case.  Custom in-line tools If you want to create your own button tool on the toolbar, the in-line tool is the right  choice. It allows you to define a tool name and the code to execute when that tool is  selected from the toolbar.  $ "editor" .kendoEditor { tools: [ { name: "addHr", tooltip: "Insert Horizontal Rule", exec: function  e  { var editor = $ this .data "kendoEditor" ; editor.exec "insertHtml", { value: " " } ; } } ] } ;  This code shows a custom tool called addHr that will add an hr element to the  HTML Editor control when clicked. You can also see the use of the exec function on  the kendoEditor where you can indicate one of the built-in functions tools of the  HTML Editor and then provide an object that supplies the parameters for it.  Here is the output from this code:  [ 131 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  Using the HTML Editor API The Kendo HTML Editor widget has a large set of API configuration options  which allow you to fine-tune the widget to the specific needs and situation of  your web page. It also exposes a set of methods and events that you can use to  programmatically enable and react to functionality that the Edit widget exposes   as it runs on the page. These options, taken together, are how you extend the Editor  widget beyond its out of the box abilities.  Configuration options We have already covered some of this in the material above, but here are the  configuration options available for the HTML Editor control. As always, please   check the Kendo UI Web documentation at docs.kendoui.com api web editor   for a more detailed list of configuration settings for these options, and to get the  latest changes or additions to the API.  $ "editor" .kendoEditor { encoded: true,     whether or not the editor should emit encoded html                      tags messages: {        define custom labels for the built-in tools and                      dialogs bold: "Bold",       …    }, stylesheets: {…},    see above, custom stylesheets to load for editor tools: {…},     see above, custom and built-in tools to display in the                   editor imageBrowser: {     the imageBrowser tool can accept a custom                       configuration transport: {     the endpoints to use for image operations read: "imagebrowser read", destroy: "imagebrowser destroy", create: "imagebrowser createDirectory", uploadUrl: "imagebrowser upload", thumbnailUrl: "imagebrowser thumbnail"    path for thumbnails of images imageUrl: " content images {0}",     "{0}" is placeholder for virtual                                               path and image name  [ 132 ]   Chapter 5  }, path: " myInitialPath ",     Initial path of images to display fileTypes: ".png,.gif,.jpg,.jpeg",     Allowed image file extensions schema: {…},    a schema can be defined to interpret data returned from                  a remote endpoint when parsing data to display images messages: {…}    custom messages for imageBrowser controls and dialogs    } } ;  Events As with any HTML element or JavaScript object in a complex site, a web page fires  events as the user performs certain actions within a page. By hooking into these  events with your own JavaScript code, you can react to the page's changes and data  in real time and organize the functionality of your page based on actions that the  user performs. The HTML Editor control fires the following events in response   to user actions:     change: This event fires every time that the data inside of the Editor    Widget changes.     execute: This event fires fires when a tool is executed. It fires every time    a tool bar button has been clicked and the code behind that button has   been executed.     keydown: The keydown event fires every time a user presses a key down   while typing inside of the Editor Widget window. Hooking into this event  allows you to respond to text as the user is typing it.     keyup: The keydown event fires every time a user presses and releases a key   while typing inside of the editor widget window. Hooking into this event  allows you to respond to text as the user is typing it.     paste: The paste event fires every time text is pasted into the Editor    Widget area.     select: The select event fires every time text inside of the Editor Widget    has been selected by a user.  [ 133 ]   HTML Editor and Custom Tools  Summary The HTML Editor gives you a lot of functionality for a very small amount of  necessary coding. In most cases, the default control will meet all of your needs for  HTML editing on a normal site. But, if you find yourself with a need for a highly  customized tool, this HTML Editor supports a rich API, detailed configuration  options, and easily accessible events for capturing and responding to use actions.  This is a control that is not appropriate for every site, but when you need something  like this, it is a tremendous boost to productivity to find it all in such a useful and  usable package.  In the next chapter, we will cover two very important Kendo widgets—Menu and  ListView. These widgets give you the ability to create responsive and feature-rich  cascading page menus and organized data structures inside of your pages with the  same Kendo approach that you have seen in all of the previous chapters. Building on  what you already know, using these new widgets will be easy and you should be up  and running before you know it.  [ 134 ]   Menu and ListView  The Kendo UI Menu widget is designed to give you an easy way to implement  an interactive JavaScript menu that opens and closes as the user commands and  providers a rich visual display on a web page. These types of menus are available  through other tricks as well, such as CSS, but the Kendo UI widget gives you a much  more configurable framework and access to a simplified JavaScript API.  The Kendo UI ListView widget is a control for visualizing a collection of data  elements in a graphically pleasing way, especially if the data contains images or  special styles. Like all Kendo UI options, the configuration is consistent and sensible  and allows you to create great-looking content, and provides display options for  editing and selection.  These controls are a good addition to your toolset for creating modern web pages.  Learning the Menu widget basics The Menu widget creates a fantastic drop-down menu with fly-out sections for  the menu's contents. It is functionally rich and requires very little code for most  implementations. As an introduction, here is a code sample of a basic menu created  from a static unordered HTML list:             Kendo UI Menu                                  Menu and ListView                                                                Music                                                                             Blues   Folk                                                                Contemporary Blues                                   Contemporary Folk                                   Traditional American                                   World Folk                                                                                                                Christian   Gospel                                                                Christian Rock   Hip Hop                                   Contemporary Christian                                   Traditional Gospel                                                                                  ...                                                                               Videos                                                Movies                           TV                           Trailers                                                                                Events                                                         News                                                                 $ document .ready function    {                 $ "menu" .kendoMenu  ;  [ 136 ]   Chapter 6              } ;                This is a menu showing different music styles, videos, and some other options just  to demonstrate how the code looks. The top-level   elements in the unordered  list all appear as actual menu headings in the output, in this example they are Music,  Videos, Events, and News.  Notice that each of these top-level elements contains its own  name and then can optionally contain a nested unordered list      within itself, which becomes the choices that appear  when that top-level item is selected on the page.  Moving down the chain, each of the   elements in the nested list can also contain  its own   for a further nested menu of options. This creates a cascading effect  where menu options can continue to expand as you move your mouse to different  options. Also note that the final top-level   item, News, is marked with a disabled  attribute which means that it will still display in the output but not be selectable.  Here is the output from this code as the page is first loaded:  Here is the Menu widget once the mouse is hovered over some of the elements in  the menu. Try this on your own and see how fast and fluid the menu reacts to these  events; it is very impressive.  [ 137 ]   Menu and ListView  Like most of the widgets in the Kendo UI framework, the Menu widget does not  have to run from static HTML, it can be fuelled by a DataSource object of either local  or remote data. Here is the code adapted to use a local DataSource object instead of  static HTML:             Kendo UI Menu                                                          var menuData = [             {                 text: "Music",                 items: [                     {                         text: "Blues Folk",                         items: [                             { text: "Contemporary Blues" },                             { text: "Contemporary Folk" },                             { text: "Traditional American" },                             { text: "World Folk" }                         ]                     },                     {                         text: "Christian   Gospel",                         items: [                             { text: "Christian Rock   Hip Hop" },                             { text: "Contemporary Christian" },                             { text: "Traditional Gospel" }                         ]                     },                                          ...                 ]             },             {                 text: "Videos",                 items: [                     { text: "Movies" },                     { text: "TV" },                     { text: "Trailers" }  [ 138 ]   Chapter 6                  ]             },             {                 text: "Events"             },             {                 text: "News",                 enabled: false             }         ];                     $ document .ready function    {             $ "menuDemo" .kendoMenu                  { dataSource: menuData } ;         } ;            Note that the DataSource object can be configured with all the options that you have  seen in the earlier chapters, and could just as easily be configured with a transport  property for remote data.  The output is identical to the static HTML we used the first time:  [ 139 ]   Menu and ListView  As is the case with most of the Kendo UI widgets, the interactive content on the page  is identical whether the data comes from the page mark-up or from a JavaScript data  source. To adapt this to use the MVC extension methods, we can create an MVC  View with the following source code in the cshtml file:  @using Kendo.Mvc.UI;  @{     ViewBag.Title = "Mvc Menu"; }   Mvc Menu  @ Html.Kendo  .Menu       .Name "menuDemo"      .Items items =>         {             items.Add  .Text "Music" .Items sub =>             {                 sub.Add  .Text "Blues   Folk" .Items subsub =>                 {                     subsub.Add  .Text "Contemporary Blues" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Contemporary Folk" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Traditional American" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "World Folk" ;                 } ;                 sub.Add  .Text "Christian   Gospel" .Items subsub =>                 {                     subsub.Add  .Text "Christian Rock   Hip Hop" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Contemporary Christian" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Traditional Gospel" ;                 } ;                 ...                              } ;             items.Add  .Text "Videos" .Items sub => {                 sub.Add  .Text "Movies" ;                 sub.Add  .Text "TV" ;                 sub.Add  .Text "Trailers" ;             } ;             items.Add  .Text "Events" ;             items.Add  .Text "News" .Enabled false ;         }     [ 140 ]   Note, how in this code sample, I have declared the data statically. It could just as  easily be gathered from a different source using logic within C code, or even left   as part of the JavaScript and retrieved from a remote source across HTTP.  The output, as you can see from this screenshot, is identical to the other two   code samples:  Chapter 6  This illustrates three unique ways to create a Kendo UI Menu widget and the  differences between them.  Menu items with images Menu items so far have only included text. The Menu widget, however, can also  contain an imageUrl property or a spriteCssClass property to display an image  along with the text. The image or sprite will appear as an icon to the left of the menu  item text.  Here is an example of using the imageUrl property to show an icon for the Videos  menu item:  ... {   text: "Videos",   imageUrl: "images reel.png",   items: [     { text: "Movies" },     { text: "TV" },     { text: "Trailers" }   ] }, ...  [ 141 ]   Menu and ListView  By adding this property, the output now displays the image in the menu:  This is how the code sample would look in MVC:  items.Add  .Text "Videos" .ImageUrl " static images reel.png" . Items sub => {   sub.Add  .Text "Movies" ;   sub.Add  .Text "TV" ;   sub.Add  .Text "Trailers" ; } ;  Notice the ImageUrl extension method that adds the image to the output.  To use a sprite, you would first set the background image of the menu items that  should display the icons and then indicate a CSS class using the spriteCssClass  property that will specify the pixel offset for each particular icon. Each menu item  that has a spriteCssClass property specified will automatically be decorated with  the k-sprite CSS class so that this is wired up properly. Here is a potential example:    menuDemo .k-sprite {   background-image: url "images sprites.png" ; } .someIcon {   background-position: 0 0; } .someOtherIcon {   background-position: 0 -32px; }   ...   ... {   text: "Videos",   spriteCssClass: "someIcon",   items: [     { text: "Movies" },     { text: "TV" },  [ 142 ]   Chapter 6      { text: "Trailers" }   ] }, ...  The CSS section of this sample shows assigning the background-image property  for all of the k-sprite class-decorated elements and also designating two sprite  pixel background-position styles. The script section shows the spriteCssClass  property in use, which will assign that portion of the sprites image as the icon for  that menu item.  Menu items with URLs So far all of the examples I have shown are menu items that do not perform any  actions when selected. All that you have to do is add the url property to the menu  item in order to make it navigate when clicked on. So, for any menu item that you  want to navigate the user to a different page, include a url property, as shown here,  and it will do so:  ... {   text: "Videos",   spriteCssClass: "someIcon",    url: "http:  www.kendoui.com",   items: [     { text: "Movies" },     { text: "TV" },     { text: "Trailers" }   ] }, ...  Notice how the web browser in this screenshot is showing the URL that the Videos  menu item now navigates to.  [ 143 ]   Menu and ListView  Menu API configuration options The Kendo UI Menu widget, as should be expected by now, is configurable through  a full set of API properties and methods. These options are properties that can be  configured, so that the Menu widget becomes suited to the needs of your web page  and style. These configurations are specified at the point in code where you create  the Menu widget. These sections will show you the options you can use.  The animation property The animation action of the Kendo UI Menu can be configured for style, speed,  and direction. When you configure the open action of the menu, Kendo will  automatically assign the reverse behavior for the close action. If you want to  configure the close action independently of the open action, then you should  configure them both separately, as shown here:  ... $ "menu" .kendoMenu {   animation: {     close: {     animation to use when closing a menu       effects: "slideIn",     'slideIn'   'fadeIn'   'expand'       duration: 10     },     open: {     animation to use when opening a menu       effects: "slideIn:Down",    You can assign a direction too       duration: 10     }   } } ; ...    or you can disable animation entirely $ "menu" .kendoMenu {   animation: false } ;  The direction property The direction property determines which direction the menus will open when the  user hovers over them. The available options here are top, bottom, left, and right.  $ "menu" .kendoMenu {   direction: "bottom" } ;  [ 144 ]   Chapter 6  ...    or you can specify how each level of submenus open separately $ "menu" .kendoMenu {   direction: "bottom right"    "bottom" for menu, "right" for sub  menus } ;  Some more options There are a few additional options available for configuring menu behavior. You can  configure how the menu behaves in relation to mouse movement and clicks with  the closeOnClick, openOnClick, and hoverDelay properties. You can configure  whether the overall menu is oriented horizontally or vertically with the orientation  property, and you can instruct the Kendo UI framework on how you want menus to  fit to a page with the popupCollision property. All of this is shown here:  $ "menu" .kendoMenu {   closeOnClick: true,     close menus when item is selected   hoverDelay: 100,     delay before menus open close   openOnClick: false,     root submenus open with item is selected   orientation: "vertical",    root menu orientation:   popupCollision: "fit"    how to adjust menu to screen boundaries                            Use "fit flip" for vertical menus.                            Set to false to disable boundary detection  completely. } ;  Configuring menu methods Some of the methods for the Kendo UI Menu widget require that you get a reference  to an existing menu item object  not just the HTML element  as a reference point for  appending or inserting some additional menu items. In this case, you can access the  menu item objects through a reference to the Kendo Menu like this:  var menu= $ "menuDemo" .kendoMenu  .data "kendoMenu" ;  In this code, you can get a reference to the Kendo Menu object from the same line of  code where you instantiate it. This way, you can reference this object in other parts  of your page and JavaScript logic. You can also get a reference to the Kendo Menu  object by calling .data …  on the HTML element that contains it at any point in your  code, but doing it in one step is nice.  [ 145 ]   Menu and ListView  Once you have this reference, you can access the children inside of the Kendo Menu  through the element property:  menu.element.children "li" .eq 3 ;  In this code sample, we are accessing the fourth li element in the children of this  particular menu object. The return value here will be a JavaScript object that can be  used as the reference point for the append, insertAfter, and insertBefore methods.  The append  , insertAfter  , and insertBefore    methods The append method takes two arguments: the JSON notation of the new menu  item s  to be appended as children, and a reference to the menu item that will   be the parent of the newly appended items:  var menu = $ "menu" .data "kendoMenu" ; var referenceItem = menu.element.children "li" .eq 1 ;  menu.append    [{     text: "new menu item",     url: "http:  www.music.com",     items: [...]   }],   referenceItem  ;  This code would append this menu item as a child to the second menu item on the  page. The insertAfter and insertBefore methods work exactly the same way,  except that they insert the new menu items at the same menu level and either after   or before the reference item respectively.  All of these methods return the Menu object to  support method chaining.  [ 146 ]   Chapter 6 The close  , enable  , open  , and remove   methods These methods for the Kendo UI Menu do not require a JavaScript object reference;  they operate directly on the HTML elements within the menu on the page. Because  of this, you can use a jQuery selector type syntax to choose which item s  to act upon  in a familiar syntax.  The enable method takes two parameters: the selector for the HTML element s  and  then a true or false value to indicate whether the item should be enabled  true  or  disabled  false :  var menu = $ "menu" .data "kendoMenu" ; menu.enable "secondItem", false ;  This particular code sample will disable the element with an HTML id value   of secondItem.  The other methods here, that is, close, open, and remove, only take a single  parameter which is the selector of the HTML element s . Please note that the  element's ID values or class names are not assigned by the framework for you,   you have to assign these values to your elements yourself in order to select them:  var menu = $ "menu" .data "kendoMenu" ; menu.close ".green" ;  menu.open "item3" ;  menu.remove "lastItem" ;  All of these methods return the Menu object to  support method chaining.  Menu events There are three events fired by the Kendo UI Menu: close, open, and select.   Each of these is given an event argument with an item property that contains   the HTML   element that was closed, opened, or selected, as shown here:      $ document .ready function    {     function onSelected e  {       var menu = $ "menu" .data "kendoMenu" ;       menu.enable ".green", false ;       alert "disabling green menu" ;     }  [ 147 ]   Menu and ListView      $ "menu" .kendoMenu { select: onSelected } ;        } ;    This code sample shows a method wired up to handle the select event, which  will then disable all menu items with a class name of green. Since this code is not  considering which specific element was selected, it will fire the same code regardless  of which element was selected. Here is a different example:      $ document .ready function    {     function onSelected e {       alert e.item.innerHTML ;     };     var menu= $ "menuDemo" .kendoMenu        { dataSource: menuData, select: onSelected } .data "kendoMenu" ;   } ;    This code examines the specific element that was selected and alerts its innerHTML  property back to the user.  The Kendo UI ListView The Kendo UI ListView widget is designed to present a collection of data on a web  page with a richer set of functionality than a standard HTML list. The ListView  widget retrieves its data through a Kendo DataSource object, it presents its data  through one or more Kendo Template blocks, and it allows interaction with its data  by giving the user the ability to both select and edit the data on the page.  ListView basics Basically, the ListView widget displays a collection of data by using a template   and a DataSource object:             ListView                             [ 148 ]   Chapter 6                .animal {             width:250px;             height:200px;             position:relative;             float:left;         }         .animal-label {             font-size:large;         }         .animal-image {             max-height:100px;             max-width: 150px;             margin: 5px;         }         listView {             width:750px;             height:100%;         }                                               <img src=".. images = imageName " alt="= animalName                 image" class="animal-image"  >              = animalName                                 var animals = [             { animalName: "African Elephant",                imageName: "african-elephant.jpg" },             { animalName: "African Lion", imageName: "african-lion. jpg" },             { animalName: "Alpaca", imageName: "alpacas.jpg" },             { animalName: "Badger", imageName: "badger.jpg" },             { animalName: "Black Bear", imageName: "bear-black.jpg" },             { animalName: "Bison", imageName: "bison.jpg" },             { animalName: "Jack-Rabbit",                imageName: "black-tailed-jackrabbit.jpg" },             { animalName: "Caribou", imageName: "caribou.jpg" },  [ 149 ]   Menu and ListView              { animalName: "Giraffe", imageName: "giraffe.jpg" },             { animalName: "Hummingbird", imageName: "humming-bird.jpg"  },             { animalName: "Jaguar", imageName: "jaguar.jpg" },             { animalName: "Lemur", imageName: "lemur.jpg" },             { animalName: "Red Fox", imageName: "red-fox.jpg" },             { animalName: "Striped Skunk", imageName: "striped-skunk. jpg" }         ];          $ document .ready function    {             $ "listView" .kendoListView {                 dataSource: animals,                 template: kendo.template $ "template" .html                } ;         } ;            The following code sample, from the top down, shows some styles for the elements  that will appear inside the ListView widget. These style declarations are important   in order to properly lay out the images inside the ListView widget on the web page:      .animal {     width:250px;     height:200px;     position:relative;     float:left;   }   .animal-label {     font-size:large;   }   .animal-image {     max-height:100px;     max-width: 150px;     margin: 5px;   }   listView {     width:750px;     height:100%;   }    [ 150 ]   Chapter 6  We then create the div element that will contain the ListView widget and the  Kendo UI Template that structures the individual ListView elements. This template  determines how each item in the ListView will be rendered inside the web page.   Any changes to the ListView items must occur here:               <img src=".. images = ${imageName }" alt="= ${animalName }        image" class="animal-image"  >      = ${animalName }         We then have the JavaScript object literal that contains some data and the instantiation  of the ListView where the dataSource and template properties are set:            var animals = [             { animalName: "African Elephant",                imageName: "african-elephant.jpg" },             { animalName: "African Lion", imageName: "african-lion. jpg" },             { animalName: "Alpaca", imageName: "alpacas.jpg" },             { animalName: "Badger", imageName: "badger.jpg" },             { animalName: "Black Bear", imageName: "bear-black.jpg" },             { animalName: "Bison", imageName: "bison.jpg" },             { animalName: "Jack-Rabbit",                imageName: "black-tailed-jackrabbit.jpg" },             { animalName: "Caribou", imageName: "caribou.jpg" },             { animalName: "Giraffe", imageName: "giraffe.jpg" },             { animalName: "Hummingbird", imageName: "humming-bird.jpg"  },             { animalName: "Jaguar", imageName: "jaguar.jpg" },             { animalName: "Lemur", imageName: "lemur.jpg" },             { animalName: "Red Fox", imageName: "red-fox.jpg" },             { animalName: "Striped Skunk", imageName: "striped-skunk. jpg" }         ];          $ document .ready function    {             $ "listView" .kendoListView {                 dataSource: animals,                 template: kendo.template $ "template" .html                } ;  [ 151 ]   Menu and ListView          } ;        As always, remember that the DataSource object can be fully configured to point to  remote data sources, can be structured using a schema, or can use any of the other  options that you might want to take advantage of in a production scenario.  You can see how each element from the DataSource object has been rendered with  the template, styled, and presented on the page as you would expect.  [ 152 ]   Chapter 6  Selecting elements with ListView The ListView widget has a richer set of behaviors to offer than simply displaying  data, however, and to start let's look at how it allows "selection" of elements. In  this code sample, I have added some more properties and an event handler to the  ListView instantiation logic to demonstrate this:          $ document .ready function    {             $ "listView" .kendoListView {                 dataSource: animals,                 template: kendo.template $ "template" .html   ,                 selectable: "multiple",                 change: notifyUser             } ;              function notifyUser e  {                 var selected = $.map this.select  , function  item  {                     return animals[$ item .index  ].animalName;                 } ;                 alert selected.join ", "  ;             }         } ;        The selectable property has been set with multiple to allow for multiple selection  of items  you can select multiple items on the page by holding the Ctrl button on  the keyboard while clicking with a mouse . We also added an event handler for the  change event so that we can see an alert box that displays which elements have   been selected.  In the notifyUser event handler function, I want to explain what is happening  because it looks a bit confusing at first glance. The variable selected is given an array  value of all of the selected elements' animalName property values. It does this by  using $.map on the results of this.select  . What is this.select  ? Well, when  Kendo fires an event from a widget, it sets the context of that event handler so that this  refers to the Kendo widget that fired the event. So, in this case, this is a reference to  the ListView itself. This means that calling this.select   in this event handler will  return a collection of all of the selected elements within the ListView. The function as  the second parameter of $.map then grabs the animalName property from each of these  elements by using its index from the animals array. The result of this code is an array  of strings containing all of the animalName values of the selected elements from the  ListView. This is then displayed to the user using [array].join  .  [ 153 ]   Menu and ListView  Here is the output with some items selected and the alert box showing from the  event handler:  Notice how the names of the animals are all showing up in the alert box that has  popped up on the page. This is great because it means that you can accurately track  selections that the user makes within your ListView and respond to those actions  however you need to.  Editing elements with ListView The ListView widget also provides a good syntax for allowing edits to the data  within the DataSource object. You need to create a separate template to display   that allows the user to make edits and then make sure that you assign some of  the Kendo-specific class names, so that it displays and understand the commands  correctly. Here is the code of the new template. Place it right beneath the template   we created in the last example.  [ 154 ]   Chapter 6                              <img src="images = imageName " alt="= animalName   image"                 class="animal-image"  >                               <input type="text" data-bind="value:animalName"  name="animalName"                     required="required"  >                                <a class="k-button k-button-icontext k-update-button"                     href="\\"> <  span>Save                  <a class="k-button k-button-icontext k-cancel-button"                     href="\\"> <  span>Cancel                                 Did you notice the unusual characters in the href attribute of the  two buttons in the template? The double-backslash characters, \\,  prevent the hash mark from being rendered as part of the Kendo  template. If this hash mark was not escaped with these backslashes,  the template would not render at all.  Next, we have added some more configurations to the JavaScript block that creates  our ListView widget. Specifically, we now have an editTemplate property that  points to the template that we just created:            var animals = [             { animalName: "African Elephant",                imageName: "african-elephant.jpg" },             ...                      ];          $ document .ready function    {             $ "listView" .kendoListView {                 dataSource: animals,                 template: kendo.template $ "template" .html   ,                 editTemplate: kendo.template $ "edit-template" . html                } ;  [ 155 ]   Menu and ListView          } ;            Here is a screenshot where the name of the Caribou has been edited to Reindeer:  ListView API and configuration We have already covered several of the aspects of the ListView in our preceding  examples; here are the remaining configuration properties from the documentation:  $ "listView" .kendoListView {   autoBind: true,    if false, you must call read   manually  [ 156 ]   Chapter 6    dataSource: ...,    demonstrated above   editTemplate: ...,    demonstrated above   navigatable: false,    whether or not keyboard navigation is enabled   selectable: false,    true false or "single" "multiple" are valid  options   template: ...,    demonstrated above   altTemplate: ...    template used for alternating styles if desired } ;  ListView methods The ListView widget has several methods available. Most of them are designed  to manipulate the items within the ListView, so that you can control the behavior  through code. Like with any widget, you need a reference to the listView JavaScript  object before you can call these methods, like this:  var listView = $ "listView" .data "kendoListView" ; ... listView.add ...   Get the reference through the .data ...  method and then you can call the   ListView-specific methods. Here is a brief overview of the methods that take   no parameters:     add: Inserts an empty item into the ListView and prepares it for editing    cancel: Cancels changes in currently edited items    clearSelection: Clears ListView's selected items and triggers the change   event     refresh: Reloads the data and reprints the ListView    save: Saves the edited ListView item. If validation succeeds, it will call the   datasource's sync method.  There are a few additional methods that do take parameters. The edit method This method edits the specified ListView item and triggers the edit event.   This method takes a single parameter which is the ListView item that needs   to be edited. Here is a sample:  var listView = $ "listView" .data "kendoListView" ; ... listView.edit listView.element.children  .first   ;  [ 157 ]   Menu and ListView The remove method This method removes the specified ListView item and triggers the remove event.   It also triggers the datasource's sync method.  var listView = $ "listView" .data "kendoListView" ; ... listView.remove listView.element.children  .first   ;  The select method This method selects the specified ListView item. If this method is called without any  arguments, it will return a collection of all of the selected items in the ListView. This  is what we did in the code sample for selecting items. Here is a code sample for using  the method with a parameter:  var listView = $ "listView" .data "kendoListView" ; ... listView.select listView.element.children  .first   ;  ListView events The ListView widget exposes several events for hooking into its lifecycle and  behavior. We have already seen some of these in our examples. These events can all  be assigned to handlers during the ListView instantiation as we save earlier in the  chapter. Here is a list:     change: Fires when the ListView selection is changed    dataBound: Fires when the ListView has received data from the DataSource   object and is about to render it     dataBinding: Fires when the data is about to be rendered on the page    edit: Fires when the ListView enters edit mode    remove: Fires before the ListView item is removed  [ 158 ]   Chapter 6  Summary The Menu and ListView widgets are great tools for structuring data on your web  pages. The Menu widget makes it simple to create interactive JavaScript menus for  navigation and even for displaying data with graphics. The ListView widget should  become a standard option for you when you want a standard way of rendering  collections of data elements on a web page. It gives you the ability to hook up  functionality that would otherwise require a lot of code and debugging.  In the next chapter, we will take a look at the Kendo UI PanelBar widget. Its API is  very similar to the Kendo UI Menu widget, as you will see, and it is a powerful way  to render accordion controls in a web page. Much like the Kendo UI Menu widget, its  primary responsibility is to organize hierarchical content in a way that saves screen  space, but still provides a sensible structure for users to understand.  [ 159 ]    Implementing PanelBar   and TabStrip  The PanelBar and TabStrip widgets are special Kendo UI controls for organization  data, which make it possible for a web page to contain a large amount of content but  display only one piece of that content at a time. These content sections are broken  up into panels with the PanelBar widget, or into tabs with the TabStrip widget. In  both cases, the effect is very similar and is a very useful way of keeping a web page  from becoming too cluttered. This chapter will explain the basics of implementing  the PanelBar and TabStrip controls with both HTML and ASP.NET MVC, and then  illustrate the following features:     Adding images to PanelBar and TabStrip items    Adding URLs to PanelBar and TabStrip items    Loading AJAX content with PanelBar and TabStrip    Controlling PanelBar and TabStrip animation effects  PanelBar basics The PanelBar widget is the Kendo UI way of implementing an interactive JavaScript  "accordion" on a web page. This type of control is very useful for displaying lists of  data that could potentially take up a large amount of screen space, but compressing  it into a format that still makes sense to users. As an introduction, here is a code  sample of a basic PanelBar created from a static unordered HTML list. This HTML  list will be reformatted into an accordion control that displays a single area of the list  at a time. As you will see, when you run the code sample, this allows a large amount  of data to be visually compressed into a smaller space. It also allows the user to select  which area of the list he or she is interested in viewing and hides the details of the  other sections. This gives a powerful demonstration of some of the commonality  between Kendo widget implementations:   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  Note that I have used the same data as in the last  chapter for the Menu control.             Kendo UI PanelBar                                                                                              Music                                                                             Blues   Folk                                                                Contemporary Blues                                   Contemporary Folk                                   Traditional American                                   World Folk                                                                                                                Christian   Gospel                                                                Christian Rock   Hip Hop                                   Contemporary Christian                                   Traditional Gospel                                                                              ...                                                                               Videos                                                Movies                           TV   [ 162 ]   Chapter 7                           Trailers                                                                                Events                                                         News                                                                 $ document .ready function    {                 $ "panelBar" .kendoPanelBar  ;             } ;                This source code creates a PanelBar with the same data from the Menu in the last  chapter. The top-level   elements in the unordered list all appear as actual  accordion headings in the output. In this example, just as in the menu example, they  are Music, Videos, Events, and News. Notice that each of these top-level elements  contains its own name and then can optionally contain a nested unordered list      within itself which becomes the choices that appear when that top-level item is  selected on the page. Moving down the chain, each of the   elements in the nested  list can also contain its own   list for a further nested menu of options, which is  impressive as not all accordion implementations can handle this level of nested data.  This creates a cascading effect where menu options can continue to expand as you  move your mouse to different options. Also note that the final top-level   item,  News, is marked with a disabled attribute which means that it will still display in the  output but not be selectable.  [ 163 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  Here is the output from this code:  The Videos panel was clicked before this screenshot was taken so that you can see  some of the data opened, it normally starts with all of the panels closed.  Just as before with the Menu widget, the PanelBar widget does not have to run from  static HTML, it can be fuelled by a DataSource object of either local or remote data.  Here is the code adapted to use a datasource instead of static HTML:                            panelBarDemo img{         max-height: 30px;         max-width: 30px;       }                              var panelBarData = [             {                 text: "Music",                 items: [                     {                         text: "Blues Folk",                         items: [  [ 164 ]   Chapter 7                              { text: "Contemporary Blues" },                             { text: "Contemporary Folk" },                             { text: "Traditional American" },                             { text: "World Folk" }                         ]                     },                     {                         text: "Christian   Gospel",                         items: [                             { text: "Christian Rock   Hip Hop" },                             { text: "Contemporary Christian" },                             { text: "Traditional Gospel" }                         ]                     },                     ...                 ]             },             {                 text: "Videos",                 imageUrl: " Images reel.png",                 items: [                     { text: "Movies" },                     { text: "TV" },                     { text: "Trailers" }                 ]             },             {                 text: "Events"             },             {                 text: "News",                 enabled: false             }         ];                     $ document .ready function    {             $ "panelBarDemo" .kendoPanelBar { dataSource:  panelBarData}  ;         } ;            [ 165 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  Note that the DataSource object can be configured with all the  options that you have seen in earlier chapters and could just as easily  be configured with a transport property for remote data.  In this code sample, we have also implemented a new feature, the imageUrl  property for the Videos tab. By specifying the URL of an image in the project,   the output will show this image next to the tab's title on the screen, which you   can see in the following screenshot:  To adapt this to use the MVC extension methods, you would create an MVC View  with this source code in the cshtml file:  @using Kendo.Mvc.UI;  @{     ViewBag.Title = "Mvc PanelBar"; }        li img {         max-height: 25px;         max-width: 25px;     }    [ 166 ]   Chapter 7   Mvc Menu  @ Html.Kendo  .PanelBar       .Name "panelBarDemo"      .Items items =>         {             items.Add  .Text "Music" .Items sub =>             {                 sub.Add  .Text "Blues   Folk" .Items subsub =>                 {                     subsub.Add  .Text "Contemporary Blues" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Contemporary Folk" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Traditional American" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "World Folk" ;                 } ;                 sub.Add  .Text "Christian   Gospel" .Items subsub =>                 {                     subsub.Add  .Text "Christian Rock   Hip Hop" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Contemporary Christian" ;                     subsub.Add  .Text "Traditional Gospel" ;                 } ;                 ...             } ;             items.Add  .Text "Videos" .ImageUrl " static images reel. png" .Items sub => {                 sub.Add  .Text "Movies" ;                 sub.Add  .Text "TV" ;                 sub.Add  .Text "Trailers" ;             } ;             items.Add  .Text "Events" ;             items.Add  .Text "News" .Enabled false ;         }     Note, how in this code sample, we have declared the data statically. It could just as  easily be gathered from a different source using logic within C code, or even left  as part of the JavaScript and retrieved from a remote source across HTTP. We can  also see here how the image is supplied through ASP.NET MVC syntax instead of  through the JavaScript in the last example.  [ 167 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  The output, as you can see from this screenshot, is identical to the other two   code samples:  This illustrates three unique ways to create a Kendo UI PanelBar widget, just like   the Menu widget from before, and the differences between them.  Adding sprite images to PanelBar items We have already seen some examples of how the PanelBar widget can contain an  imageUrl property to display an image next to a section title. It can also use a more  advanced image option by specifying a sprite image through the spriteCssClass  property. In either case, the image or sprite will appear as an icon to the left of the  menu item text.  As we have already partially seen, here is an example of using the imageUrl  property to show an icon for the Videos menu item:  ... {   text: "Videos",   imageUrl: " images reel.png",   items: [     { text: "Movies" },     { text: "TV" },     { text: "Trailers" }   ] }, ...  [ 168 ]   By adding this property, the output now displays the image in the menu:  Chapter 7  This is how the code sample looks when using MVC syntax:  items.Add  .Text "Videos" .ImageUrl " images reel.png" .Items sub => {   sub.Add  .Text "Movies" ;   sub.Add  .Text "TV" ;   sub.Add  .Text "Trailers" ; } ;  Notice the ImageUrl extension method that adds the image to the output.  To use a sprite, you would first set the background image of the menu items that  should display the icons and then indicate a CSS class using the spriteCssClass  property that will specify the pixel offset for each particular icon. Each menu item  that has a spriteCssClass property specified will automatically be decorated with  the k-sprite CSS class so that this is wired up properly. Here is a potential example:    panelBarDemo .k-sprite {   background-image: url "images sprites.png" ; } .someIcon {   background-position: 0 0; } .someOtherIcon {   background-position: 0 -32px; }   ...   ... {   text: "Videos",   spriteCssClass: "someIcon",   items: [  [ 169 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip      { text: "Movies" },     { text: "TV" },     { text: "Trailers" }   ] }, ...  The CSS section of this sample shows assigning the background-image property  for all of the k-sprite class-decorated elements and also designating two sprite  pixel background-position styles. The script section shows the spriteCssClass  property in use which will assign that portion of the sprite's image as the icon for  that menu item.  Adding URLs to PanelBar items So far all of the examples we have seen are PanelBar items that do not perform any  actions when selected. All that we have to do is add the url property to the PanelBar  item in order to make it navigate when clicked on. So, for any PanelBar item where  we want to navigate the user to a different page, include a url property and it will  do so:  ... {   text: "Videos",   spriteCssClass: "someIcon",    url: "http:  www.microsoft.com",   items: [     { text: "Movies" },     { text: "TV" },     { text: "Trailers" }   ] }, ...  Loading AJAX content with PanelBar Instead of embedding all of the content into one page, a PanelBar widget can be  used to load content from other URLs dynamically using AJAX. This will reduce  the overall size of the page since only one section of the PanelBar will be loaded at  a time. It can also allow you to load content from other locations in your site that  may change independently of the site that contains your PanelBar, which can reduce  duplicate text or markup. To enable this functionality, use the contentUrls property  of the PanelBar to indicate which sites contain the markup that should be placed  inside the accordion:  [ 170 ]   Chapter 7  Secondly, we have to create placeholders in the HTML markup to indicate where this  AJAX content will appear once it has loaded. All this requires is a structure like the  following code with   elements that contain empty   elements which will  receive the AJAX content at the appropriate time:  $ "panelId" .kendoPanelBar {   ...   contentUrls: [     "content1.html",     "content2.html"  ] } ;                Remote content                            More content                   With this combination of markup and JavaScript code, the PanelBar will load  content1 for the first tab, content2 for the second tab, and so on. It is a good idea to  keep the content on these pages very simple so that it can fit into the PanelBar areas  without being distorted.  [ 171 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  Controlling PanelBar animation effects The animation features of the PanelBar can be controlled through the animation  property when configuring the PanelBar object in JavaScript. The animation  property can be set to false to completely disable all animation effects, or it can be  configured like the following code sample for specific behaviors:  $ "panelId" .kendoPanelBar {   ...   expandMode: "single",     "multiple" for multiple open tabs at once   animation: {     collapse: {       duration: 1000,     milliseconds for animation effect       effects: "fadeOut"    "fadeout" is the only option for collapse     },     expand: {       duration: 500,       effects: "expandVertical fadeIn"    choose either or both of  these     } } ;  The only available animation effect for the collapse action is fadeOut. For the expand  action, you can choose expandVertical, which is the normal action for expanding a  PanelBar, and fadeIn which changes the opacity as it expands.  Introducing the TabStrip widget The TabStrip widget is very similar to the PanelBar widget. In fact, they perform  nearly the same function except that the PanelBar Widget organizes content into  panels that are stacked vertically while the TabStrip widget organizes content  into panels that are stacked horizontally. They are so similar, in fact, that we will  use nearly the same code to demonstrate both of them. You have already seen the  PanelBar widget in the preceding sections. Now we will take a look at the TabStrip  widget and see how it functions within web pages.  TabStrip basics The TabStrip widget creates a series of tabs that are used to show only one specific  section of content at a time. The content within a tab can be almost anything, ranging  from simple text and markup all the way up to large   sections with enough  content to fill an entire web page. You have surely seen web pages that have tabs  across the top of the screen to organize different types of material onto a single web  page. The Kendo TabStrip widget is one way to create this effect on your own pages.

Memorabilia signing on April 15th                                                 $ document .ready function    {                 $ "panelBar" .kendoTabStrip  ;             } ;                [ 173 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  For this widget, the markup is required to follow a specific pattern. The TabStrip  itself must be declared on a   element that contains an unordered list     and  a collection of   elements right after the unordered list. This is all evident in the  preceding code sample. The unordered list contains all of the tab titles. The collection  of   elements contains all of the content that appears within each of the tabs  in the same order they appear in the markup. This is how this particular example  appears when run inside of a web browser:  Using TabStrip with a datasource Much like the PanelBar, the TabStrip can be configured to use a datasource instead of  being created on top of existing HTML markup already on a web page. To adapt the  code sample from the last section into this pattern, replace the body of the page with  this code:                    $ document .ready function    {       $ "panelBar" .kendoTabStrip {         dataTextField: 'text',         dataContentField: 'content',         dataSource: [         {           text: 'Music',           content: 'Next concert in May of 2013!'         },         {           text: 'Videos',           content: 'Next music video in July of 2013!'         },         {           text: 'Events',           content: 'Memorabilia signing on April 15th'         },         {           text: 'News',           content: ''  [ 174 ]   Chapter 7          }         ]       } ;     } ;        The output from this code is exactly the same as before, except that the News   tab is not disabled since there is not a property to define a disabled element   using a datasource:  Adding images to the TabStrip widget All of the TabStrip tabs so far have only included text. The TabStrip widget, however   just like the PanelBar widget , can also contain an imageUrl property to display  an image next to a tab's title. It can also use a more advanced image option by  specifying a sprite image through the spriteCssClass property. In either case,  the image or sprite will appear as an icon to the left of the tab's title text. Here is an  example of using the imageUrl property to show an icon for the Videos menu item:  ... {   text: "Videos",   imageUrl: " images reel.png",   content: "Next music video in July of 2013!" } ...  By adding this property, the output now displays the image in the menu:  [ 175 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  This is how the same code sample looks when using MVC syntax:  @using Kendo.Mvc.UI;  @{     ViewBag.Title = "Mvc TabStrip"; }        li img {         max-height: 25px;         max-width: 25px;     }     Mvc TabStrip  @ Html.Kendo  .TabStrip       .Name "tabStripDemo"      .Items items =>         {             items.Add  .Text "Music"                  .Content "Next concert in May of 2013!" ;             items.Add  .Text "Videos"                  .Content "Next music video in July of 2013!"                  .ImageUrl " images reel.png" ;             items.Add  .Text "Events"                  .Content "Memorabilia signing on April 15th" ;             items.Add  .Text "News" .Enabled false ;         }      You should be able to notice quite a few similarities to the code we used earlier for  the PanelBar widget. To use a sprite with the TabStrip, you can follow the same  procedures as we discussed for the PanelBar.  Adding URLs to TabStrip tabs To use a TabStrip tab as a hyperlink to another page, you can configure the url  property for that tab and it will take on this role. By doing this, we are no longer  using the tab to show any content on the page, it simply navigates directly to another  web page when it is clicked.  ... {   text: 'News',  [ 176 ]   Chapter 7    content: '',   url: 'http:  www.kendoui.com' } ...  After altering the code in this way, the News tab will become a hyperlink instead   of an actual tab to display content.  Loading AJAX content with TabStrip To load AJAX content into a tab, we need to indicate the URL for each tab's content  in the configuration. This follows the same pattern as the other options within the  TabStrip, so this should look very familiar to you by now:      $ document .ready function    {     $ "panelBar" .kendoTabStrip {       dataTextField: 'text',       dataContentField: 'content',       dataImageUrlField: 'dataImageUrl',       dataUrlField: 'url',       dataContentUrlField: 'contentUrl',       dataSource: [         {             text: 'Remote Content',             contentUrl: 'content1.html'         },           {             text: 'More Content',             contentUrl: 'content2.html'           }         ]     } ;   } ;    [ 177 ]   Implementing PanelBar and TabStrip  When we run the web page in a browser, it appears like this with the remote content  loaded dynamically as we click on the tab's titles:  Controlling the TabSrip widget's animation  effects The animation effects for the TabStrip widget are exactly the same as for the PanelBar  widget. They are controlled through the animation property when configuring  the TabStrip object in JavaScript. The animation property can be set to false to  completely disable all animation effects, or it can be configured like the following  code sample for specific behaviors:  $ "tabSripId" .kendoTabStrip {   ...   animation: {     collapse: {       duration: 1000,     milliseconds for animation effect       effects: "fadeOut"    "fadeout" is the only option for collapse     },     expand: {       duration: 500,       effects: "expand:vertical fadeIn"    choose either or both of  these     } } ;  The only available animation effect for the collapse action is fadeOut. For the expand  action, you can choose expand:vertical, which is the normal action for expanding  a TabStrip, and fadeIn which changes the opacity as it expands.  [ 178 ]   Chapter 7  Summary The PanelBar widget is a highly configurable JavaScript accordion widget that gives  you considerable "bang for your buck". For a categorized list of data elements that  you need to compress into a smaller amount of screen space, the PanelBar widget is  the perfect choice for your web page. The TabStrip widget is an easy JavaScript tab  framework that allows you to organize your page content with tabs and even load  remote content dynamically onto your page when a tab is clicked. Both of these great  widgets should add useful features to your website.  In the next chapter, you will learn about the Kendo UI Slider widgets and how to use  them to collect input from users in a graphically interesting way. The slider widgets  present an HTML input as a visual bar where the user can drag a handle to the  desired option instead of typing a number into a field in a form.  [ 179 ]    Slider Essentials  The Kendo UI framework includes special widgets called sliders that show a slider  bar on a web page, so that a user can drag a handle to increase and decrease the  slider in order to choose a value. These sliders normally have tick marks and labels  that indicate the highest and lowest numbers available as well as range between  them. These widgets are great visual tools to help users select numbers on a fixed  scale, instead of just typing in a value that may or may not be appropriate. This   could be useful in a rating system, for example, or on any input control where only   a certain set of numbers are allowed. As you will see, Kendo UI allows for a good  level of configurability, so you can customize the appearance and functionality of   the UI to suit your needs.  Introducing Slider and RangeSlider The first thing we should cover is the two different types of slider widgets that  Kendo UI makes available. There is the standard Kendo UI Slider widget and there  is a Kendo UI RangeSlider widget. The Kendo UI RangeSlider widget is designed  for more advanced scenarios where your page needs to capture a range  a bottom  and a top number  of numbers from a user in a single page element instead of just a  single value.  It is important to understand that these slider widgets are special visual aids for use  in supplying a number into an input HTML element. The final output of a slider  widget is the number that the user has selected and this number is set as the value of  the input HTML element underneath. This is important so that the input element can  then be posted inside of an HTML form and used by a web server on the other end  when the form is posted.   Slider Essentials  Along these lines, be sure to follow this pattern when creating a Kendo UI Slider  widget on your page:  <!— value is optional, but will set the initial value of the slider if  present -->   ...     $ function  {     $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {...} ;   } ;    The kendoSlider method needs to be bound to an actual input HTML element.   So what about the Kendo UI RangeSlider widget? It uses two numbers but an input  control contains only one value. How does it maintain these two separate values?  The answer is that it uses two input elements inside of a container div tag:              ...     $ function  {     $ "rangeSliderId" .kendoRangeSlider {...} ;   } ;    This way, the Kendo UI RangeSlider widget is created on a div element and it builds  its range values into the two input elements inside of that container div to properly  render it on the page.  Using Slider and RangeSlider with the MVC  extension methods The following code sample illustrates the basics of instantiating slider widgets by  using ASP.NET MVC extension methods. The Name method must be called for all   the Kendo widgets to work properly.  @ Html.Kendo  .Slider  .Name "horizontalSlider"   ... @ Html.Kendo  .RangeSlider  .Name "horizontalRangeSlider"    [ 182 ]   Chapter 8  Implementing the basics As an introduction, I have created a sample page that shows sliders and range sliders  in a variety of configurations. We will use this same code sample in the following  sections where we discuss the features and options. In this sample, we have fixed the  positions of the elements using CSS absolute positioning. This is not necessarily best  practice for web page design, but it works to show these controls in isolation. In this  first code block, we are creating the HTML markup necessary to contain the Slider  widgets. Each Slider is created on top of a div element with input elements inside.  This will be explained more after the following code sample:    ...                       Slider  Widgets                                                                                                                RangeSlider Widgets                     <div style="position:absolute;top:65px;left:388px"             id="verticalRangeSlider">             <!-- these inputs are required for containing the two                  Values in the range -->                                              <div id="horizontalRangeSlider"  [ 183 ]   Slider Essentials              style="position:absolute;top:285px;left:300px;">             <!-- these inputs are required for containing the two                  Values in the range -->                                 You will see that we have created four separate slider widgets on the page, two  of them are normal slider widgets and two of them are range slider widgets. The  following JavaScript code section is what transforms the HTML markup into Kendo  widgets for the web page. You can also see some of the configuration options in these  samples, which we will discuss in detail in just a few paragraphs.                $ document .ready function    {           create the vertical slider widget             $ "verticalSlider" .kendoSlider {                 min: -10,                 max: 20,                 orientation: "vertical",                 smallStep: 2,                 largeStep: 10,                 tickPlacement: "both"             } ;                 create the horizontal slider widget             $ "horizontalSlider" .kendoSlider {                 min: 0,                 max: 20,                 smallStep: 1,                 largeStep: 5             } ;                 create the vertical rangeslider widget             $ "verticalRangeSlider" .kendoRangeSlider {                 min: 0,                 max: 20,                 orientation: "vertical",                 selectionStart: 2,                 selectionEnd: 6,                 smallStep: 1             } ;                 create the horizontal rangeslider widget             $ "horizontalRangeSlider" .kendoRangeSlider {  [ 184 ]   Chapter 8                  min: 0,                 max: 30,                 selectionStart: 5,                 selectionEnd: 15,                 smallStep: 1,                 largeStep: 5,                 tickPlacement: "none"             } ;         } ;            Here is the output from executing the preceding code block:  We organized the content on the page so that you could see the different slider  widgets and their output. The two sliders on the left, one vertical and one horizontal,  are both normal slider widgets. The two sliders on the right side, one vertical and  one horizontal, are both range slider widgets. I also adjusted properties on each of  them so that they are showing unique options for the sake of demonstration. We will  cover these options as we go through the rest of this chapter.  [ 185 ]   Slider Essentials  Basic implementation using MVC  extension methods The following code sample illustrates how to instantiate these same sliders   by using the ASP.NET MVC extension methods. I have only included the actual  slider widgets, not the full HTML page.         Slider Widgets      @ Html.Kendo  .Slider  .Name "verticalSlider"          .HtmlAttributes new { id = "verticalSlider" }          .Min -10          .Max 20          .Orientation SliderOrientation.Vertical          .Value 5          .SmallStep 2          .LargeStep 10          .TickPlacement SliderTickPlacement.None          .Tooltip tt =>              tt.Format "{0}"        @ Html.Kendo  .Slider  .Name "horizontalSlider"          .HtmlAttributes new { id = "horizontalSlider" }          .Min 0          .Max 20          .Orientation SliderOrientation.Horizontal          .Value 7          .SmallStep 1          .LargeStep 5          .TickPlacement SliderTickPlacement.Both            RangeSlider Widgets      @ Html.Kendo  .RangeSlider  .Name "verticalRangeSlider"          .HtmlAttributes new { id = "verticalRangeSlider" }          .Min 0          .Max 20          .Orientation SliderOrientation.Vertical          .Values new double[] { 2, 6 }          .SmallStep 1       @ Html.Kendo  .RangeSlider  .Name "horizontalRangeSlider"          .HtmlAttributes new { id = "horizontalRangeSlider" }          .Min 0          .Max 30   [ 186 ]   Chapter 8          .Orientation SliderOrientation.Horizontal          .Values new double[] { 5, 15 }          .SmallStep 1          .LargeStep 5          .TickPlacement SliderTickPlacement.Both      Just as in the normal JavaScript and HTML example above, the output from these  MVC extensions creates the same output. All four of the sliders appear with the same  options and configuration and also have the same behavior.  Using tooltips and pop-up texts The slider widgets give several visual cues to the user to indicate their value and  their control functions. There are tooltips, or hover effects, which indicate what the  buttons at the end of the sliders will do. These tooltips are always present, they do  not require any additional configuration or code, although they can be customized  using the API. The following screenshot shows the tooltip text that appears over the  Increase button:  [ 187 ]   Slider Essentials  The following screenshot shows the tooltip text that appears over the   Decrease button:  There are also tooltip labels that indicate the value of the tick marks, if present, and  that indicate how to interact with the slider control by dragging with the mouse.   The following screenshot shows the tooltip text over the tick mark that represents   the number 18:  The following screenshot shows the tooltip text over the drag handle:  Lastly, when a user drags the controls of a range slider widget, the page will show  a label that indicates the currently selected range. The following screenshot shows  the tooltip text over the selected range, in this case, showing that the handles are  positioned at 4 and 15:  Learning keyboard controls It is also important to note that the slider controls can also be manipulated using   the keyboard arrow buttons and the Page Up and Page Down buttons when the slider  widget has the focus on the page. Pressing the arrow button either up or down   [ 188 ]   will increase or decrease the value of the slider by the number contained in the  smallStep property. Pressing Page Up or Page Down will increase or decrease the  value of the slider by the number contained in the largeStep property.  These properties, smallStep and largeStep, can be set when the slider widget   is instantiated in JavaScript as we saw in our earlier sample code:  Chapter 8  $ "verticalSlider" .kendoSlider {   min: -10,   max: 20,   orientation: "vertical",   smallStep: 2,   largeStep: 10,   tickPlacement: "both" } ;  The numbers do not have to be even, they can be any whole number increment   that makes sense for your application.  Customizing the user interface of the  slider widgets Many of the properties of the slider widgets can be used to customize how the user  can interact with them on the web page. The text that shows up in the tooltips and  tick mark labels can be customized to show different text that may be more specific  to your page. You can also customize the orientation of the sliders and their   default values.  Tooltip customization The tooltip property of the slider widgets can be customized with a custom format  or a custom template and can also be disabled completely, if unwanted. For example,  imagine that your slider widget is intended for the user to select degrees  such as on  a thermometer . You could customize the format of the tooltip to reflect that unique  format. You will also see that when changing the format of the tooltip, the format of  the data labels will automatically change to match it:  $ "verticalSlider" .kendoSlider {   min: -10,   max: 20,   orientation: "vertical",   smallStep: 2,   largeStep: 10,  [ 189 ]   Slider Essentials    tickPlacement: "both",   tooltip: {     format: "{0}"   } } ;  The default format is "{0}", so by adding the degree symbol after this, it will appear  properly on the page:  Notice how the labels and the tooltip both changed to match the new format.   Also note that I added the format using a degree symbol that was not HTML  encoded, the Kendo UI system handled the appropriate encoding for me.  The full options for configuring the tooltip property are displayed here:     options for a kendoSlider tooltip: {   enabled: true,     enable tooltips or not   format: "{0}",     format string for tooltips   template:{     value: "..."     template value for tooltips     }   } } ...    options for a kendoRangeSlider tooltip: {   enabled: true,     enabled or not   format: "{0}",     format string for tooltips   template:{     selectionStart: "...",     template value for start range           selectionEnd: "..."     template value for end range     }   } }  [ 190 ]   Chapter 8  You should not use both a format and a template, since both of those properties are  designed to customize the display of the tooltips. The template, as you have seen  in previous chapters, would need to follow the normal Kendo template syntax and  could be used to create a highly customized tooltip for your slider control.  Customizing tooltip options using MVC extension  methods This is how a configured tooltip looks when using ASP.NET MVC extension methods.  ... .Tooltip tt =>    tt.Enabled true    .Format "{0}"    .Tempalte "template would go here"   @* misspelled in the Kendo code  *@  Remember that, just as in JavaScript, you would not set both the format and the  template at the same time. Also note that the Kendo library has misspelled a word, it  has "tempalte" instead of "template". Be sure to check your code here in case Telerik  has fixed the spelling.  Customizing the default values A slider widget can be configured to start with a specific default value. For a normal  Kendo slider widget, this comes in the form of the value property either of the input  HTML element or in the initialization of the Kendo slider widget in JavaScript, as  shown here:     ...    or  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   value: 4,   ... }  [ 191 ]  Either of these methods will set the initial, or default value of the slider widget to the  number 4.   Slider Essentials  For the Kendo range slider, you need to set both of the numbers for the range, so you  need to use different properties called selectionStart and selectionEnd or set the  value properties of both of the inputs in the HTML:               ...    or  $ "rangeSliderId" .kendoRangeSlider {   selectionStart: 2,   selectionEnd: 8   ... }  Both of these methods will set the start of the selected range to 2 and the end of the  selected range to 8.  Customizing tick placement The tick marks and data labels on the slider widgets can also be customized by  choosing one of four supported options for their display: topLeft, bottomRight,  both, and none. These are set through the configuration property called  tickPlacement.  Placing the tick at the top left The topLeft tick placement option will place the tick marks on the left side of   a vertical slider or on the top side of a horizontal slider.  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   tickPlacement: "topLeft"   ... } ;  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   tickPlacement: "topLeft"   ... } ;  [ 192 ]   Here is the output:  Chapter 8  Placing the tick at the bottom right The bottomRight tick placement option will place the tick marks on the right side   of a vertical slider or on the bottom side of a horizontal slider:  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   tickPlacement: "bottomRight"   ... } ;  [ 193 ]   Slider Essentials Placing ticks on both sides The both tick placement option will place the tick marks on both sides of a slider:  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   tickPlacement: "both"   ... } ;  Removing the ticks entirely The none tick placement option will remove all tick marks from a slider:  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   tickPlacement: "none"   ... } ;  [ 194 ]   Chapter 8  Customizing slider orientation You have already seen the two orientations of the slider widgets—horizontal and  vertical, but here is a brief look at the code necessary to enable these two options:  $ function  {   orientation: "vertical"     "horizontal" or "vertical"   ... }  If you do not set the orientation, the default orientation will  be horizontal.  Learning API methods When interacting with the slider widgets, you must reference the JavaScript object  through the data   method as usual:     Kendo Slider Widget var slider = $ "sliderId" .data "kendoSlider" ;     Kendo RangeSlider Widget var rangeSlider = $ "rangeSliderId" .data "kendoRangeSlider" ;  The enable and disable Methods The slider widgets support methods for enabling and disabling the controls in the  web page through the enable   and disable   methods. The syntax is the same  for both slider widgets and range slider widgets, assuming you have the correct  reference to the object through JavaScript.     get a reference to the slider var slider = $ "sliderId" .data "kendoSlider" ;     disable a slider slider.disable  ;     enable a slider slider.enable  ;  [ 195 ]   Slider Essentials  A disabled slider widget appears as partially transparent, or grayed out, on the web  page. In the following screenshot, the slider on the left is disabled and the slider on  the right is enabled:  Using the values The value of a slider widget can be both set and retrieved from the JavaScript API.  The syntax is different between the slider and the range slider since they each use   a different number of values internally.  Using values from a Kendo slider Setting and retrieving values for a Kendo slider is straightforward since it contains  only a single value, as shown here:     get a reference to the slider var slider = $ "sliderId" .data "kendoSlider" ;     set the value of the slider to 7 slider.value 7 ;     get the value of the slider var sliderValue = slider.value  ;    returns a number  Using values from a Kendo range slider When setting or retrieving values from a range slider, you must communicate using  JavaScript arrays so that you can hold both values from the slider object.     get a reference to the slider var rangeSlider = $ "rangeSliderId" .data "kendoRangeSlider" ;     set the values for the range slider to 2 and 8 rangeSlider.value [2,8] ;     get the values from the range slider var sliderValues = rangeSlider.value  ;    returns an object array  [ 196 ]   Chapter 8  Hooking into events Just as with the other Kendo UI widgets, event handlers can be bound during object  instantiation, or later through a JavaScript bind   method call. These examples will  only show the instantiation code.  Using the change event The slider widgets will fire a change event when the user changes the value of a  slider either through clicking one of the arrows, moving the slider with the mouse,   or using the keyboard controls.  The change event for a Kendo slider widget The change event for a Kendo slider widget can be bound and used like   the following:  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   change: changeHandler,   ... } ;  ...  function changeHandler  e {   alert e.value ;     e.value contains the new value of the slider }  The e.value property will contain the new value of the slider widget so that you can  respond to the event properly in your JavaScript code.  The change event for a Kendo range slider widget The change event for a Kendo range slider widget can be bound as shown in the  following code snippet this. It differs from the change event for the slider widget in  that it passes an array to the event handler instead of a single value.  $ "rangeSliderId" .kendoRangeSlider {   change: changeHandler,   ... } ;  ...  fuction changeHandler  e {  [ 197 ]   Slider Essentials    alert e.value.toString   ;     e.value is an array of the new range  values }  The slide event The slide event is identical in syntax to the change event, but it only fires when  the user moves the slider by using the mouse, it will not fire for keyboard events or  button clicks. The preceding examples for the change event are valid for the slide  event as well.  $ "sliderId" .kendoSlider {   slide: changeHandler,   ... } ;  The change and slide events with MVC  extension methods This is how event handlers can be wired up by using ASP.NET MVC extension  methods. Please note that the output is identical to the one outlined before; this is  simply the syntax necessary for executing the following code using MVC. See the  previous sections for more information.  .Events events => events   .Slide "slideHandler"    .Change "changeHandler"    Summary The Kendo UI Slider and Kendo UI RangeSlider widgets are very handy tools for  collecting numbers for an input element in a web page. When collecting numbers that  must fall within a specified range, these widgets are much friendlier than returning  error messages to the user about a number being invalid. I would suggest using them  where appropriate to make your site much more interesting for your users.  In the next chapter, you will learn about the Splitter and the TreeView widgets  that allow you to load resizable dynamic content into your pages and to organize  hierarchical content in a tree-like display. These widgets will help you build  powerful pages that can handle and load content on the fly and display content   in organized patterns.  [ 198 ]   Implementing the Splitter   and TreeView Widgets  In this chapter, you will learn about two different widgets from the Kendo UI Web  framework, the Splitter widget and the TreeView widget. The Splitter widget is a  tool used for organizing content inside of a web page. It creates block-like regions  within the web page that can contain normal page elements or even additional  Splitter widget controls to further subdivide the content area. The TreeView widget  is a tool used for displaying data that is organized hierarchically, such as in tree.  A good example of data organized this way is a folder structure on a hard drive.  Folders can contain files or additional folders. When diagrammed, this creates a  nested structure such as a tree and is well suited for the TreeView widget.  The Splitter widget The Kendo UI Splitter widget is a powerful tool for creating a dynamic page layout.  It generates bordered sections within a web page that can be resized, scrolled,  collapsed, and nested. These sections are built on top of div elements and extend  these underlying div elements with impressive functionality. As you see how to use  this widget throughout this section, I am sure you can imagine many ways of putting  it to use.  Learning the Splitter widget The Kendo UI Splitter widget is designed to extend div HTML elements into flexible  content areas that can split up elements of your web pages, hence the name "splitter".  These content areas become resizable blocks that allow the user to choose which  portions of a page should occupy more of the visible screen. Each of these blocks can  be configured with specific behaviors and options, such as scroll bars and the ability  to collapse page elements with a single click.   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets  Here is a sample of some HTML markup that can be used with the Kendo UI   Splitter widget. Take special note of how the div elements are organized and nested;  it will become important when you see the JavaScript code that instantiates the  Kendo objects:                                                                                                           The outer-most div, the one with the id value of outerSections, contains three  div elements between its tags. You can also see that each of these div elements  beneath the outerSections div contain child div elements of their own. These  child elements will become Kendo UI Splitter widget sections within the larger  outerSections area. Two of these child div elements, topSubSections and  bottomSubSections, also contain a further nested hierarchy that will become  nested Kendo UI Splitter widget sections within the outerTopSection and  outerBottomSection areas respectively.  In this JavaScript code block, you can see that there are three kendoSplitter  widgets created independently. The first Splitter widget is organized in a vertical  sequence; it is the outer-most area and will contain the following two Splitter widget  objects within itself. The second and third Splitter widget areas are organized  horizontally and are nested within other Splitter widget objects, as you will see in the  following screenshot:      $ function    {     $ "outerSections" .kendoSplitter {       orientation: "vertical",       panes: [  [ 200 ]   Chapter 9          { collapsible: false, size: "200px", scrollable: false },         { collapsible: false, size: "200px", scrollable: false },         { collapsible: false, size: "200px", scrollable: false }       ]     } ;     $ "topSubSections" .kendoSplitter {       orientation: "horizontal",       panes: [         { collapsible: true, scrollable: false },         { collapsible: true, scrollable: false }       ]     } ;     $ "bottomSubSections" .kendoSplitter {       orientation: "horizontal",       panes: [         { collapsible: true, scrollable: false },         { collapsible: true, scrollable: false },         { collapsible: true, scrollable: false }       ]     } ;   } ;    You can see the three Splitter widget areas that are stacked vertically down   the page. The top-most area contains two horizontally stacked areas inside of it.   The bottom-most area contains three horizontally stacked areas. These all match   to the HTML and JavaScript code that you just saw.  [ 201 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets  Loading content The contents of the Splitter widget areas you just saw were all empty for the sake of  demonstration. This is not necessary, however. The content areas can contain all of  the normal HTML content that a div element would normally contain. For example,  you could fill some of the areas up with text, as done in the following code snippet:            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...             Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit...        This text will now appear within the Splitter widget box and be resized or collapsed  as necessary:  Loading content with AJAX A more configurable method of populating the contents of these Splitter widget areas  is to load it via AJAX calls. To enable this functionality, simply use the contentUrl  property of the JavaScript object literal that defines a Splitter widget content area and  indicate the page that you want to load via AJAX. The Kendo UI Framework will  take care of the rest for you.  $ "bottomSubSections" .kendoSplitter {   orientation: "horizontal",   panes: [     { collapsible: true, scrollable: false },     { collapsible: true, scrollable: false },     { collapsible: true, scrollable: false,   [ 202 ]         contentUrl: "LoremIpsum.html" }   ] } ;  Chapter 9  Hooking into Splitter events The Kendo UI Splitter widget is equipped with a range of rich behaviors. Most of  these behaviors, whether enacted through a user action or through a method call,  trigger an event. Like any event in JavaScript, you can attach your own event handler  functions to these events and respond to the actions with your own custom code.  This section will show the different events available on the Kendo UI Splitter widget  and demonstrate how to hook into them.  The collapse event The collapse event fires when a user collapses a Kendo UI Splitter widget section by  clicking on the collapse icon between two of the panes. This icon appears as a small  triangle that is pointing in the direction that the collapse action will move it. The  following is the code that is used to wire up the collapse event with an event handler:     Binding during Splitter Widget creation $ "splitterElement" .kendoSplitter {   ...   collapse: collapseEventHandler   ... } ;     Dynamic binding and unbinding var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ; splitter.bind "collapse", collapseEventHandler ; spliter.unbind "collapse", collapseEventHandler ;  [ 203 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets The contentLoad event The contentLoad event fires when content is loaded into a Kendo UI Splitter widget  pane. The normal use of this event is to react to the point when AJAX content has  finished loading from the remote source. The following is the code that is used to  wire up the contentLoad event with an event handler:     Binding during Splitter Widget creation $ "splitterElement" .kendoSplitter {   ...   contentLoad: contentLoadEventHandler   ... } ;     Dynamic binding and unbinding var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ; splitter.bind "contentLoad", contentLoadEventHandler ; spliter.unbind "contentLoad", contentLoadEventHandler ;  The expand event The expand event fires when a Kendo UI Splitter widget pane is expanded by a user  clicking on the expand icon after a pane has been collapsed. This icon appears as  small triangle pointing in the direction that the pane will expand when clicked, as  shown here:  The following is the code that is used to wire up the expand event with an   event handler:     Binding during Splitter Widget creation $ "splitterElement" .kendoSplitter {   ...   expand: expandEventHandler   ... } ;  [ 204 ]   Chapter 9     Dynamic binding and unbinding var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ; splitter.bind "expand", expandEventHandler ; spliter.unbind "expand", expandEventHandler ;  The layoutChange event The layoutChange event fires when the layout of a Kendo UI Splitter widget has  changed. This event is more generic than expand, collapse, and resize, so it  will often appear in conjunction with those events since all of them also indicate  that the layout has changed. The following is the code that is used to wire up the  layoutChange event with an event handler:     Binding during Splitter Widget creation $ "splitterElement" .kendoSplitter {   ...   layoutChange: layoutChangeEventHandler   ... } ;     Dynamic binding and unbinding var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ; splitter.bind "layoutChange", layoutChangeEventHandler ; spliter.unbind "layoutChange", layoutChangeEventHandler ;  The resize event The resize event is fired when a user drags the handle between two Kendo UI  Splitter widget panes in order to resize them. This event is also triggered during  collapse and expand. The following is the code that is used to wire up the resize  event with an event handler:     Binding during Splitter Widget creation $ "splitterElement" .kendoSplitter {   ...   resize: resizeEventHandler   ... } ;     Dynamic binding and unbinding var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ; splitter.bind "resize", resizeEventHandler ; spliter.unbind "resize", resizeEventHandler ;  [ 205 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets  Making calls to Splitter API methods The Kendo UI Splitter widget is equipped with a range of methods that enable its  rich behaviors. Most of these methods, when fired, trigger an event. Like any event  in JavaScript, you can attach your own event handler functions to these events  and respond to the actions with your own custom code. This section will show the  different methods available on the Kendo UI Splitter widget.  Getting a reference to the splitter object The first thing to remember when working with methods on all Kendo UI widgets   is that you must get a reference to the JavaScript object before these methods   are available. To do this, you must use the JavaScript method .data  . Here is   an example:  var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ;  Notice how jQuery is used to select the Document Object Model  DOM  element  where the Kendo UI Splitter widget has been created and then the .data   function  has been called with the parameter text kendoSplitter indicating the type of object  that we are trying to get. Now that the Kendo UI Splitter widget instance has been  retrieved, methods can be called from the splitter variable directly.  splitter.collapse "outerPane" ;  Using the ajaxRequest method The ajaxRequest method is used to load AJAX content into a specific Kendo UI  Splitter widget pane. This method takes three parameters. The first parameter is a  string used to select the specific pane into which the AJAX content should be loaded.  It uses jQuery syntax to select the element, so to select an element with an id value  of pane1, you would use pane1 to select it. The second parameter is the URL of the  remote endpoint that contains the content to load into the pane. The third parameter  is optional and is used to send data to the remote endpoint if it takes parameters in  order to send the data back. Here is a code sample showing the method in action:     Get a reference to the Kendo UI Splitter Widget var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ;     Call the ajaxRequest method splitter.ajaxRequest "pane1", "someContent.html" ;  Note that this method will cause the contentLoad  event to fire.  [ 206 ]   Chapter 9  Using the collapse method The collapse method is used to collapse a specific Kendo UI Splitter widget pane.  This method takes one parameter. The parameter is a string used to select the specific  pane which should be collapsed. It uses jQuery syntax to select the element, so to  select an element with an id value of pane2, you would use pane2 to select it. Here  is a code sample of the method in action:     Get a reference to the Kendo UI Splitter Widget var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ;     Call the collapse method splitter.collapse "pane2" ;  Note that this method will cause the layoutChange and resize  events to fire, but it will not cause the collapse event to fire since the  user did not initiate the action with the mouse.  Using the expand method The expand method is used to expand a specific Kendo UI Splitter widget pane.   This method takes one parameter. The parameter is a string used to select the specific  pane which should be expanded. It uses jQuery syntax to select the element, so to  select an element with an id value of pane2, you would use pane2 to select it.   Here is a code sample of the method in action:     Get a reference to the Kendo UI Splitter Widget var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ;     Call the expand method splitter.expand "pane2" ;  Note that this method will cause the layoutChange and resize  events to fire, but it will not cause the expand event to fire since the  user did not initiate the action with the mouse.  [ 207 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets Using the max and min methods The max and min methods are used to set the maximum or minimum size of a  specific Kendo UI Splitter widget pane. These methods take two parameters. The first  parameter is a string used to select the specific pane that will be configured. It uses  jQuery syntax to select the element, so to select an element with an id value of pane3,  you would use pane3 to select it. The second parameter is a string value representing  the new maximum or minimum size. This value is represented either as a number of  pixels or as a percentage. Here is a code sample of the method in action:     Get a reference to the Kendo UI Splitter Widget var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ;     Call the max method splitter.max "pane3", "300px" ;     Call the min method splitter.min "pane3", "25%" ;  Note that this method will not cause any events to fire.  Using the size method The size method is used to set the size of a specific Kendo UI Splitter widget pane.  This method takes two parameters. The first parameter is a string used to select the  specific pane that will be configured. It uses jQuery syntax to select the element,  so to select an element with an id value of pane4, you would use pane4 to select  it. The second parameter is a string value representing the new size. This value is  represented either as pixels or as a percentage. It must fall within the range of the  max and min size values. Here is a code sample of the method in action:     Get a reference to the Kendo UI Splitter Widget var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ;     Call the size method splitter.size "pane4", "300px" ;  Note that this method will cause the layoutChange and  resize events to fire.  [ 208 ]   Chapter 9  Using the toggle method The toggle method is used to switch the state of a specific Kendo UI Splitter widget  pane between collapsed and expanded. If the pane is currently expanded, the toggle  method will collapse it. If the pane is currently collapsed, the toggle method will  expand it. This method takes two parameters. The first parameter is a string used  to select the specific pane that will be toggled. It uses jQuery syntax to select the  element, so to select an element with an id value of pane5, you would use pane5  to select it. The second parameter is an optional Boolean value  true or false  that  indicates a specific state that the pane should be set to irrespective of its current state.  A value of true sets the pane to an expanded state. A value of false sets the pane to  a collapsed state. Here is a code sample of the method in action:     Get a reference to the Kendo UI Splitter Widget var splitter = $ "splitterElement" .data "kendoSplitter" ;     Call the toggle method splitter.toggle "pane5" ;     Force the pane to expand splitter.toggle "pane5", true ;     Force the pane to collapse splitter.toggle "pane5", false ;  Note that this method will cause the layoutChange and resize  events to fire, but it will not trigger the collapse or expand events.  TreeView The Kendo UI TreeView widget is a useful widget when you need to display data  that is organized hierarchically. Files on a hard disk and business organizational  structures are good examples of data that is organized in this way. The data has a  top-level element  such as root folder or a CEO  and then has several individual  elements  such as files or employees  and groups  such as folders or departments   beneath that top-level element. Each group can have further levels of groups such  that the final diagram can be imagined as a tree with a root and many branches   groups of elements  that divide many times and ultimately end with leaves   individual elements . As you can imagine, data like this is not always very easy  to visualize and lay out on a web page. Fortunately, the Kendo UI TreeView  widget comes to our rescue as an easy way to display this data complete with rich  interaction and configuration options.  [ 209 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets  Learning TreeView The Kendo UI TreeView widget is designed to work with data that is nested in HTML  unordered lists. These are a natural fit for a TreeView to work since they can be nested  hierarchically just as Kendo UI intends to display and organize them. Much like the  other Kendo UI widgets that organize data, the TreeView widget can be instantiated  on top of HTML that has already been rendered on a web page or it can build the  HTML itself when fed data through a data source object. Here is a simple example of  instantiating a Kendo UI TreeView widget on top of pre-rendered HTML:                Organization Chart               Administration            Office Manager       Resource Manager       Administrative Assistant                    Consulting                   Software Development              Desktop Applications       Web Applications                     Business Intelligence               Special Projects     Portals and Collaboration                      $ document .ready function    {  [ 210 ]   Chapter 9    $ "treeview" .kendoTreeView  ;   } ;    This page shows an organization chart categorized by department and job function.  As you can see in the following screenshot, the Kendo UI TreeView widget does  a nice job of displaying this. The HTML is capable of rendering hierarchical data  without any assistance from the Kendo UI Framework, but ordinary HTML does not  offer collapsible sections or any of the other special behaviors that you will see as  you read on in this section.  Binding to a data source As you just saw, the Kendo UI TreeView widget is designed to work either on top  of existing HTML markup or it can bind to a JavaScript data source. Much like the  other Kendo UI widgets that are designed to display and organize data, this data is  best contained within a Kendo DataSource object that supports the many functions  inherent within the Kendo Framework. To display the page that you saw earlier in  this fashion, you can use the following code:      $ document .ready function    {   var orgChart = [{     text: 'Organization Chart', expanded: true, items: [     { text: 'Administration', expanded: true, items: [       { text: 'Office Manager' },       { text: 'Resource Manager' },       { text: 'Administrative Assistant' }       ]     },     { text: 'Consulting', expanded: true, items: [  [ 211 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets        {       text: 'Software Development', expanded: true, items: [         { text: 'Desktop Applications' },         {text: 'Web Applications'}       ]       },       {text: 'Business Intelligence'}       ]     },     { text: 'Special Projects' },     { text: 'Portals and Collaboration' }     ]   }];   $ "treeview" .kendoTreeView {     dataSource: orgChart   } ;   } ;    Notice how each element can contain its own list of child elements through the  items property, such as how the Software Development group contains two child  elements: Desktop Applications and Web Applications. These child elements  can also contain their own list of child elements, and so on. This is how a tree of data  is formed and this is how the Kendo UI TreeView widget processes the data into a  graphical tree on the web page. As with any Kendo DataSource connection, the data  can be bound to a remote source and does not have to be hardcoded into the page.  Using drag and drop Since the Kendo UI TreeView widget is enabled with special functionality through the  Kendo Framework, it can do much more than standard HTML unordered lists. One  of these special functions is dragAndDrop. When this feature is enabled on a Kendo UI  TreeView widget, the user can click on an element in a TreeView and drag it around  to anywhere else on that TreeView. Not only this, but if there are multiple TreeView  widgets on the same page with drag and drop enabled, the user can drag elements  from one TreeView widget to another! To enable this functionality, all you have to do  is set the dragAndDrop property of the Kendo UI TreeView widget to true.  $ document .ready function   {   $ "treeview" .kendoTreeView {     dataSource: files,     dragAndDrop: true   } ; } ;  [ 212 ]   When this has been enabled, the elements of the TreeView widget show a darkened  background as a mouse hovers over them to help instruct the user that they are  interactive. When an element in the TreeView is dragged, an icon appears next to it  to help indicate what action will happen when the mouse button is released. The +  sign indicates that an item will be added to a hierarchical section, as shown in the  following screenshot:  Chapter 9  However, if the mouse is hovering in a position that will leave the item within a list,  the icon changes to a picture that looks like a short list of items. At the same time,  a small line will appear within the list that will receive the item to indicate where it  will be placed, as shown here:  [ 213 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets  Configuring animation effects You may have already noticed that the Kendo UI TreeView widget places small  triangular icons next to each section of the tree layout where items exist underneath  another item. If you click on one of these triangular icons with your mouse, the  section will either collapse into a hidden state or will expand into a visible state.  When this transition between hidden and visible occurs, the Kendo UI Framework  will animate it with some effects that make it visually appealing. These effects can be  configured to suit your own personal preference:  $ "treeview" .kendoTreeView {   ...   animation: {     expand: {           configure the expand animation       duration: 200,    milliseconds of animation       hide: false,      ?       show: true,       ?       effects: "expandVertical fadeIn"    one or both of these     },     collapse: {         configure the collapse animation       duration: 200,    milliseconds of animation       hide: false,      ?       show: true,       ?       effects: "fadeOut"    "fadeOut" is the only option here     }   }   ... } ;  Displaying images The Kendo UI TreeView widget is designed to enable an attractive layout for your  content. To this end, the Kendo UI Framework has built-in support for displaying  small images inside of the TreeView widget next to the items that you are displaying.  This can be done in one of two ways. The first way is to use individual image files  for each image that you want to display. The second way is to use a CSS sprite image  that contains many images together that are offset by a certain number of pixels.  [ 214 ]   To use individual image files in a Kendo UI TreeView widget, you can use the  imageUrl property of the TreeView items. The following is how this appears in code:  Chapter 9  var orgChart = [{   text: 'Organization Chart', expanded: true, items: [   {     text: 'Administration', expanded: true,     imageUrl: ' Images icon-organizational-chart.gif',     items: [     { text: 'Office Manager' },     { text: 'Resource Manager' },     { text: 'Administrative Assistant' }     ]   },   {     text: 'Consulting', expanded: true,     imageUrl: ' Images icon-organizational-chart.gif',     items: [     {     text: 'Software Development', expanded: true, items: [       { text: 'Desktop Applications' },       {text: 'Web Applications'}     ]     },     {text: 'Business Intelligence'}     ]   },   {     text: 'Special Projects',     imageUrl: ' Images icon-organizational-chart.gif',   },   {     text: 'Portals and Collaboration',     imageUrl: ' Images icon-organizational-chart.gif',   }   ] }];  [ 215 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets  Using images like this renders the graphics against the left side of the TreeView  widget directly in-line with the text of each TreeView item that is decorated with   an imageUrl property, as shown in the following screenshot:  The other way to use images with your TreeView widget is to reference them from a  CSS sprite image file. By using sprite images, you can decrease the number of times  your web page has to call the server for separate image files and this can increase the  performance of your site. If you have a sprite image that contains your images, you  can reference it as follows in code:    .org{   background-image: url ' Images icon-organizational-chart.gif' ;   max-height: 25px;   max-width: 25px;   }       $ document .ready function    {   var orgChart = [{     text: 'Organization Chart', expanded: true, items: [     {       text: 'Administration', expanded: true,       spriteCssClass: 'org',       items: [       { text: 'Office Manager' },       { text: 'Resource Manager' },       { text: 'Administrative Assistant' }       ]     },     ...  [ 216 ]   Using sprites like this renders the graphics against the left side of the TreeView  widget directly in-line with the text of each TreeView item that is decorated with   an imageUrl property, similar to how the images were rendered previously.  Chapter 9  Using templates The Kendo UI TreeView widget is highly configurable. Along with the ability to add  images and sprites, as you just saw in the previous section, it can also be customized  through the use of Kendo templates. These templates can be used to create a display  that is customizable into any display that you want. As an example, consider the  following code sample that is used to create a special TreeView display with icons   to the right of each item that can be clicked to remove the item from the Tree  View display:      : item.text     if  !item.items  {       [x]     }       $ "treeview" .kendoTreeView {   template: kendo.template $ "treeview-template" .html   ,   ... } ;       Delete button behavior  [ 217 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets  $ document .on "click", ".delete-link", function e  {   e.preventDefault  ;   var treeview = $ "treeview" .data "kendoTreeView" ;   treeview.remove $ this .closest ".k-item"  ; } ;    First, notice the template block at the top of the code sample. The template is  specifying that the item text is displayed. Then, only if the item does not have  a collection beneath it, the anchor link is displayed that can be clicked to delete  the item from the TreeView widget. Second, notice that the template is set in the  TreeView setup code using the template property. Finally, notice that the anchor  link's behavior has been wired up using an event handler. The function to delete  an item from a TreeView relies on the TreeView API and must be wired up using  JavaScript. Here is a screenshot of the way this looks on a web page:  Hooking into TreeView events The Kendo UI TreeView widget fires several different types of events during  the course of its operation. These events provide you, the developer, with the  opportunity to run your own code in response to actions that the TreeView runs  as it operates. Some of these actions are directly related to user involvement, such  as when a user clicks on something. Some of them are more indirect and fire as the  TreeView widget changes its state such as when it loads content. Since there are a  large number of events associated with the TreeView widget, we will examine them  here with brief descriptions for each one:     collapse: The collapse event fires when the user clicks on an arrow icon   that causes a section of the TreeView widget to collapse.  [ 218 ]   Chapter 9     dataBound: The dataBound event is triggered after the data source change  event has been processed, such as when items are added or removed from  the data source or when the data source is initially populated.     drag: The drag event is triggered when an item is dragged from or within a  TreeView widget. The drag event supplies a lot of very specific details about  its location to the event handler which can be used in your custom code.     dragEnd: The dragEnd event is triggered when an item has been released at  the end of the drag action and it is inserted back into a TreeView widget in a  new location.     dragStart: The dragStart event is triggered at the start of a drag action as   the user begins to drag an item from a TreeView widget.     drop: The drop event is triggered when an item is dropped after a drag   action. The drop event supplies a lot of very specific details about its location  to the event handler which can be used in your custom code.     expand: The expand event fires when the user clicks on an arrow icon that   causes a section of the TreeView widget to expand.     select: The select event is triggered when a node is selected by a user   clicking on it with the mouse.     navigate: The navigate event is triggered when the focus changes from one   TreeView node to something else on the page.  Making calls to the TreeView API methods The Kendo UI TreeView widget is equipped with a wide range of methods that  enable its rich behaviors. These methods allow you to manipulate the TreeView  widget manually in all of the ways that it supports. By using these API methods,   you can configure and engage the TreeView widget however your application needs.  Like the events section just discussed, there are many methods that the TreeView  widget supports. I will list them all here with brief descriptions:     append: The append method appends an element to the end of an existing      collapse: The collapse method collapses an expanded TreeView    TreeView widget section.  widget section.     dataItem: The dataItem method retrieves a model data item that is bound   to a TreeView widget element.     enable: The enable method enables or disables a TreeView widget element.    expand: The expand method expands a collapsed TreeView widget section.  [ 219 ]   Implementing the Splitter and TreeView Widgets     findByText: The findByText method finds a TreeView element by its       findByUID: The findByUID method finds a TreeView element by its    text value.

Summary The Kendo UI Splitter and the Kendo UI TreeView widgets offer a lot of functionality  as you develop your web pages. The Splitter widget is an impressive tool in  organizing content sections that are collapsible, expandable, and resizable. This type of  functionality is not normally so easy. The TreeView widget offers a feature-rich version  of a hierarchical unordered HTML list with some very useful features for graphics,  collapsible tree sections, and a large number of methods and events. Both of these  widgets should add a lot of value to your web site.  In the next chapter, you will learn about two final widgets from the Kendo UI Web  Framework, the Window and the Upload widgets. The Window widget allows  you create and manage modal pop-up pages with specialized content. The Upload  widget gives you a richer set of features around the traditional HTML upload  element for a great file-upload experience for the users of your website.  [ 220 ]   The Upload and Window  Widgets  Modern web applications have advanced to the point that file uploads and dialog  boxes have matured from simple, unattractive HTML elements into interactive and  customizable controls. This powerful functionality does not come for free, however;  it requires well written JavaScript and CSS styling. The Kendo UI Framework for the  Web provides prebuilt controls that give you this functionality for very little effort.  This chapter will explore these controls and illustrate their use.  Uploading files File uploads have traditionally been a clumsy element within web pages. Uploading  multiple files was an even worse experience, often requiring multiple HTML upload  elements which forced users to click on a separate button for every file. The Kendo  UI Framework provides a specialized Upload widget that helps both users and  developers in this process. Instead of clicking on buttons for every file, users can  simply drag and drop as many files as necessary onto a web page and have them  upload automatically, and asynchronously, in the background. Developers, likewise,  can program to receive multiple files simultaneously and receive file uploads  through JavaScript without causing web pages to become slow and unresponsive.   The Upload and Window Widgets  Learning the Upload widget Since the Upload widget is designed to upload the contents of one or more files to  a server, even the most basic implementation of this widget requires a server that  can accept file uploads. You can accomplish this by using your ASP.NET MVC  project. To receive the file uploads, you need to create an action method that accepts  IEnumerable  as an input parameter. The following is how  the server will receive the files from the Kendo UI Upload widget:     Action method to receive uploaded files [HttpPost]     This attribute guarantees that only                 Form POST requests can call this action method public ActionResult Submit IEnumerable  files  {   if  files != null    {        ...         Process the files and save them        ...   }    return View  ; }  With this server code in place to receive the uploaded files, you can now build the  page that will host the Kendo UI Upload widget from where the user will choose  the files to upload. The following code sample shows an HTML form that has been  configured for use as a Kendo UI Upload widget. Take special note that the form has  two required input elements: a file input and a submit input. These are the normal  input elements that you should expect for any form that uploads files, but in this  case, there is also a script element that creates a special Kendo UI Upload widget  on the file upload element.  Here is the HTML for the index view:                  HTML file upload                   Submit button                [ 222 ]   Chapter 10    $ document .ready function   {     $ "files" .kendoUpload  ;     Create the Kendo Upload Widget   } ;    The following is how this markup will appear on an actual web page. Take special  note that the file input element is displayed as a button instead of the normal style  that you see with default HTML.  With all of this in place, you can click on the Select button to choose a file to upload  to the server. Once you have selected that file and clicked OK, the server will   receive the file and will run any processing instructions that you have set in   the server-side code.  [ 223 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets  The preceding screenshot shows the file selection dialog that will appear on the  user's computer, so that he or she can choose the files to upload.  By adding a breakpoint within the action method code that receives the uploaded  files, you can see how ASP.NET MVC interprets the posted data using Visual Studio  2012. The following is a screenshot of an uploaded file and the objects that display  information about that uploaded file. In this case, I uploaded a small text file called  Reflection.linq. You can see that the web server has received the file successfully  and is able to process it as you see fit. This screenshot is showing Visual Studio  in debug mode, which allows us to see the internal state of objects. Also, in this  screenshot, we can see that the first object in the IEnumerable   is a file with the FileName property value of Reflection.linq:  Enabling asynchronous uploads While the upload experience that we just saw is already a superior experience to a  traditional HTML upload element, the experience can get much better. JavaScript is  now capable of sending file uploads asynchronously, or in the background, which  means that the user does not have to submit a form that causes the page to reload. In  other words, the process can run faster and smoother and requires less involvement.  To enable this functionality, all you have to do is add the async configuration property  to the Kendo Upload widget instantiation block. The following code sample shows  how to do it:                                         [ 224 ]   Chapter 10      $ document .ready function   {     $ "files" .kendoUpload      {       async: {          async configuration         saveUrl: "save",      the url to save a file is ' save'         removeUrl: "remove",    the url to remove a file is ' remove'         autoUpload: true      automatically upload files once selected       }     }      ;   } ;    This functionality also requires some changes to the server. Although the majority  of this code is the same as in the earlier example, this action method returns  ContentResult instead of an ActionResult, because this action method is not  sending a new web page back to the browser. Instead, it sends back a string result that  notifies the JavaScript in the web page that the file upload s  completed successfully. If  something goes wrong with the file upload s , the server will send an error code, such  as a code 500 internal server error.  public ContentResult Save IEnumerable  files  {      The Name of the Upload component is "files"   if  files != null    {     foreach  var file in files      {          ...          Process the files and save them...          ...   }       Return an empty string to signify success   return Content "" ; }  [ 225 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets  Uploading multiple files simultaneously By default, the Kendo UI Upload widget enables uploading multiple files at the same  time, but you can specify this setting explicitly, as in the following code sample:      $ document .ready function   {     $ "files" .kendoUpload        {         multiple: true       }      ;   } ;    To upload multiple files, use the Ctrl key while you click on the files in the upload  window. See the following screenshot for a display of multiple files selected at   once. When you click the OK button, all of the files will be uploaded together to   the server and will be processed in a single transaction. No more multiple buttons   and dialogs required!  [ 226 ]   Chapter 10  Removing uploaded files As files are uploaded with the Kendo UI Upload widget, you will see a list of the  filenames appear on the page in the file upload area. If you are using the standard  upload behavior, not the async configuration, the files listed on the page have  not yet been uploaded to the server. Rather, their filenames have been stored in  preparation for when you click the Submit button on the page to submit the HTML  with the files attached. You can see a list of files in the following screenshot that have  been marked for upload; they have not yet been sent to the server:  Since these files have not yet been uploaded, you can click the Remove button beside  any of these files to remove them from the list without any side effects. If you are  using the asynchronous file upload functionality, however, the files are uploaded  instantly to the server and there is no way to remove them until they have already  been fully uploaded. As you can see in this next screenshot, this file has already been  loaded asynchronously to the server and has already been saved somewhere by that  sever code:  There is still a way to remove the file, but it requires some extra code on the server to  make this work. Specifically, for removing asynchronous automatic uploads, another  controller action method is required. This action method receives a list of one or  more file names and deletes them from the server since they have already been  uploaded and saved. The Kendo UI Upload widget calls this method automatically  when the Remove button is clicked on the page.  public ContentResult Remove string[] fileNames  {      The parameter of the Remove action must be called "fileNames"  [ 227 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets    if  fileNames != null    {     foreach  var fullName in fileNames      {          ...          delete the files          ...     }   }       Return an empty string to signify success   return Content "" ; }  Tracking upload progress While a file is being uploaded asynchronously, you can see the progress of the  upload with a progress bar displayed beneath the filename and a swirling circle   of dots to indicate that the action is still occurring. The following screenshot shows   a file upload in progress:  Cancelling an update in progress While a file upload is taking place asynchronously, a button will appear beside the  progress bar for cancelling the upload. If you click this button, it will attempt to  cancel the asynchronous upload that is in progress. You should note that cancelling  asynchronous uploads is never a guaranteed success. Most file uploads occur very  quickly and it is unlikely that you will be able to cancel it in time. Also, even if you are  able to click the Cancel button in time, the process will still continue for a short period  of time before the background threads respond to the cancellation. This is just to say   that cancelling a file upload may work, but it also may not and it is hard to predict  either way.  [ 228 ]   Chapter 10  Using file drag and drop If you are using the asynchronous file upload functionality, there is another special  feature that you can take advantage of. Since the asynchronous file upload processes  the files immediately through JavaScript, the web page can enable some special  behavior, such as dragging and dropping files onto the page using your mouse. This  functionality is also enabled by default, so you can take advantage of it without any  further configuration. All you have to do is drag a file from your computer and drop it  on the screen where the Kendo UI Upload widget is present. As you drag the file onto  the page, you will see the page react by showing some text instructing the user where  to drop the file. When the file is dropped, the upload starts immediately.  The Kendo UI Window widget JavaScript has long supported pop-up windows that can send messages to a user  in a web browser. These messages can be simple text for the user to see, they can be  confirmation boxes to ask permission, or they can even sometimes prompt the user  to enter some information. Of course, these pop-up messages have two big problems.  First, they are unattractive and have the appearance of a system message instead of a  coherent portion of a website. Second, they have been so overused and abused in the  past that many users disable them entirely or make it a habit to avoid sites that use  them because they are annoying at best and a potential security risk at worst.  Modern web programmers have found a solution to this problem. JavaScript  frameworks have been created that can create a different kind of pop-up message.  Instead of using the actual system prompts that JavaScript did in the past, they have  found a way to display hovering HTML div elements that are not actual pop-up  messages at all, they are a true portion of the page that can be hidden or displayed  on demand. The Kendo UI Window widget is a tool to build these nice hovering  page elements.  [ 229 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets  Since the underlying concept to this technology is hiding and displaying specific  HTML div elements, the basic use of this widget is simply to create a Kendo UI  Window widget directly on a div tag. This will hide it until you are ready to   show it and, once you are ready to show it, it will animate it onto the screen as a  hovering element above the rest of your page. See the following code sample for   a basic example:       Windows Azure is a cloud computing platform   and infrastructure, created by Microsoft, for building,    deploying and managing applications and services through   a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters.    It provides both platform as a service  PaaS  and    infrastructure as a service  IaaS  services and supports    many different programming languages, tools and frameworks,    including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software    and systems. Windows Azure is Microsoft's competing product    to Amazon's AWS cloud computing platform, Google App Engine,   and other systems.     See Details      $ document .ready function   {     $ "window" .kendoWindow {       width: "600px",       title: "About Windows Azure",       close: onClose     } ;          var onClose = function  {       $ "windowButton" .show  ;     };      $ "windowButton" .on "click", function  {       $ "window" .data "kendoWindow" .open  ;       $ "windowButton" .hide  ;     } ;   } ;    [ 230 ]   Chapter 10  You can see the Kendo UI Window widget being created over the HTML element  with an id value of window. The button with the ID of windowButton is wired up to  open the Window widget and the event handlers hide this button while the Window  widget is open and then show it again when the Window widget is closed.  The markup inside your div will be the markup inside the Window widget when  it appears. This means that all of your styles and layouts are still shown properly in  the same way as the rest of your page; there is no disconnect. The following is how  this code looks when rendered on the page. Notice that the content of the Kendo UI  Window widget is not yet shown, it must first be activated through an event; in this  case that event is clicking on the Show Window button:  This is how the Kendo UI Window widget looks when it is activated:  Customizing Window actions The Kendo UI Window widget adds some default functionality to all windows that it  creates. There is a button at the upper-right corner of the window, which is used as a  close button, there is a title bar to give the purpose of the window content clear to the  user, and the window is resizable if a user clicks one of the edges with a mouse and  drags it. The buttons that appear in the upper-right corner of the Window widget can  be customized for your web page and specific needs.  [ 231 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets  As you see, the only button that appears by default is the close button. However,  there are three other buttons that can be added very easily: Refresh, Minimize,  and Maximize. These buttons already have default functionality attached to them.  The Refresh button will refresh the content inside the Window widget if it has  been loaded from a remote source. The Minimize button will reduce the size of the  Window widget to just the title bar. The Maximize button will enlarge the Window  widget so that it takes up the entire web browser's screen size. After you click  either the Minimize or Maximize buttons, a new special button appears for the sole  purpose of restoring the Window widget back to its original position and size. Here  is the code you need to use in order to enable these actions in your Window widget:      $ document .ready function   {     $ "window" .kendoWindow {       width: "600px",       title: "About Windows Azure",       actions: ["Minimize", "Maximize", "Close"],       close: onClose     } ;      var onClose = function  {       $ "windowButton" .show  ;     };      $ "windowButton" .on "click", function  {       $ "window" .data "kendoWindow" .open  ;       $ "windowButton" .hide  ;     } ;   } ;    [ 232 ]   Here is how the Window widget appears with these actions enabled:  Chapter 10  Here is a minimized Window widget, note that the Minimize button has been  changed to the button which will restore the original size and shape of the window:  Here is a maximized Window widget in the next screenshot. Note that the Maximize  button has been changed to the button that will restore the original size and shape of  the window:  [ 233 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets  Loading content with AJAX All of the examples you have seen so far have displayed local content in the Window  widget, or content already embedded in the web page. This is only useful in limited  scenarios. The Window widget is much more flexible when it can load content from  external sources, such as other web pages in your overall site. To make this work,  you need to configure the Window widget with a content source. You can see an  example of this in the following code sample:      $ document .ready function   {     $ "window" .kendoWindow {       width: "600px",       title: "Rams's Ten Principles of Good Design",       content: "OtherPage.html",       close: onClose     } ;      var onClose = function  {       $ "windowButton" .show  ;     };      $ "windowButton" .on "click", function  {       $ "window" .data "kendoWindow" .open  ;       $ "windowButton" .hide  ;     } ;   } ;    With this enabled, the Window widget will load and display this external content  as soon as it is activated. This has the added benefit that the loaded content is not  downloaded until necessary, so the page will load somewhat faster. Here is a Window  widget that has loaded external content in this way:  [ 234 ]   Chapter 10  Using the animation effects When the Window widget is activated on the page, it animates onto the screen  with some pleasant effects. By default, it will use the zoom effect which makes the  Window widget appear as if it zooms in from a very small object into the full size.  The other available effects are the toggle effect, the expand effect, and a choice of  whether or not the Window widget animation should start as semi-transparent. The  following code sample shows the animation effects as they are configured by default:  Note that no special animation configuration is included. The only way  to run the default animation is to leave the animation configuration  element out of the setup.      $ document .ready function   {     $ "window" .kendoWindow {       width: "600px",       title: "About Alvar Aalto"     }       close: onClose     } ;  [ 235 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets      var onClose = function  {       $ "windowButton" .show  ;     };      $ "windowButton" .on "click", function  {       $ "window" .data "kendoWindow" .open  ;       $ "windowButton" .hide  ;     } ;   } ;    To enable the toggle animation, change the code so that it appears like the following  code sample. The toggle animation is actually the absence of a special animation,  so that the Window Widget appears or disappears immediately instead of going  through a graphical transition.      $ document .ready function   {     $ "window" .kendoWindow {       width: "600px",       title: "About Alvar Aalto",       animation: {     open: {       effects: ""     },     close: {       effects: ""     }     }       close: onClose     } ;      var onClose = function  {       $ "windowButton" .show  ;     };      $ "windowButton" .on "click", function  {       $ "window" .data "kendoWindow" .open  ;       $ "windowButton" .hide  ;     } ;   } ;    [ 236 ]   To enable the expand animation, change the code so that it appears like the following  code sample. The reverse configuration property is used to reverse the animation  for the close effect.  Chapter 10      $ document .ready function   {     $ "window" .kendoWindow {       width: "600px",       title: "About Alvar Aalto",       animation: {     open: {       effects: "expand:vertical"     },     close: {       effects: "expand:vertical",       reverse: true     }     }       close: onClose     } ;      var onClose = function  {       $ "windowButton" .show  ;     };      $ "windowButton" .on "click", function  {       $ "window" .data "kendoWindow" .open  ;       $ "windowButton" .hide  ;     } ;   } ;    The transparency effect can be used with any of these animation effects, and it is  enabled or disabled separately. The following code sample shows how to enable or  disable the animation. The only difference from the previous example is the extra  string value fadeIn at the end of the effects property values.      $ document .ready function   {     $ "window" .kendoWindow {       width: "600px",       title: "About Alvar Aalto",       animation: {     open: {       effects: "expand:vertical fadeIn"  [ 237 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets      },     close: {       effects: "expand:vertical fadeIn",       reverse: true     }     }       close: onClose     } ;      var onClose = function  {       $ "windowButton" .show  ;     };      $ "windowButton" .on "click", function  {       $ "window" .data "kendoWindow" .open  ;       $ "windowButton" .hide  ;     } ;   } ;    Using the Window widget events The Kendo UI Window widget provides a set of events that fire in response to  various user events. Since there a number of these, I will list them here with brief  descriptions for each one:     Activate: This event fires when the Window widget animation completes   after opening  after closing  with a mouse  with the mouse     Close: This event fires when the Window widget is closed    Deactivate: This event fires when the Window widget animation completes      Dragend: This event fires when a user finishes dragging a Window widget      Dragstart: This event fires when a user starts to drag a Window widget      Error: This event fires when a Window widget encounters an error while   loading remote content through AJAX  [ 238 ]      Open: This event fires when a Window widget opens    Refresh: This event fires when the remote content within a Window widget   is refreshed from the remote source     Resize: This event fires when a Window widget is resized by a user with    the mouse  Chapter 10  Using the Window widget API methods The API methods allow us to execute functionality on the Window widget on  demand in our JavaScript code. See the following brief description on what sort   of options we have when calling API methods:     Center: Calling this method returns the Window widget to the centre    of the screen.     Close: Calling this method closes the Window widget.    Content: Calling this method either gets the current content of a Window   widget when called with no parameters or sets the content of a Window  widget when provided new content as a parameter.     Maximize: Calling this method maximizes a Window widget.    Minimize: Calling this method minimizes a Window widget.    Open: Calling this method opens a Window widget that is closed.    Refresh: Calling this method refreshes the content of a Window widget   from its remote source through AJAX. This method only works for Window  widget objects that have an AJAX content property set.     Restore: Calling this method restores a Window widget from the minimized   state back into the normal size and position.     SetOptions: Calling this method sets the configuration options of    a Window widget.     Title: Calling this method either gets or sets the title of a Window widget    ToFront: Calling this method brings a Window widget to the front of other   elements on the page     ToggleMaximization: Calling this method either maximizes a Window  widget that is not currently maximized or returns a maximized Window  widget back to its original size and position.  [ 239 ]   The Upload and Window Widgets  Summary In this chapter, we learned how to use the Window and Upload widgets. These  widgets give you the power to create scalable and interactive web pages that your  users will appreciate. Most importantly, these widgets provide ready-made solutions  to very common web development problems so that you can focus on your code  instead of solving repetitive problems.  In this book, we have seen a full array of the different Kendo UI Web tools that are  available for developing powerful web pages. As you have seen in every chapter,  these widgets are very friendly to use and offer a wide range of configuration  options to be tailored to your specific needs and situation. Not only this, but Telerik  has an active community of developers that can assist with implementation details  through web forums and blogs and even paid support, if necessary. I hope you  have enjoyed learning about the powerful tools available from Telerik in the Kendo  UI Web framework. These tools will lower the overall time investment and effort  involved in delivering rich web pages, and that is something most of us can   happily appreciate.  [ 240 ]   Web API Examples  Many of the widgets that we explored in the previous chapters are most useful   when paired with more advanced server-side code. For example, many web  applications use databases and work with files. While the previous chapters   showed the client-side code, such as HTML and JavaScript, that is necessary to   use these widgets, they did not focus on the ASP.NET server-side C code that   many real-world applications utilize. To demonstrate how to use the Kendo UI  Framework with these types of scenarios, this chapter will show some specialized  examples of using the Kendo UI Framework with the ASP.NET Web API and with  the Entity Framework.  If you are unfamiliar with the ASP.NET Web API framework, you can  visit www.asp.net web-api for some good examples, videos, and  walkthroughs.  Getting familiar with the ASP.NET   Web API The most recent release of the ASP.NET MVC Framework, MVC 4, included  templates for a new feature known as Web API controllers. These controllers are  specialized HTTP communication endpoints and allow for the creation of RESTful  API services. A RESTful API service is a HTTP web service that allows clients to  communicate using standard HTTP verbs  Get, Post, Put, Delete, and Patch  in  order to perform operations on the server.   Web API Examples  Traditionally, ASP.NET has had the ability to create web services as SOAP  endpoints  as opposed to REST endpoints . SOAP web services use XML  schemas and are very good at serializing and deserializing strongly-typed  objects and have been widely adopted in production systems. Compared  with RESTful services, SOAP services are very verbose and brittle, as  a change to the schema is required to implement any new features.  Additionally, the explosive growth around JavaScript has made RESTful  services more appealing to developers since they can be easily accessed  through HTML script blocks and common JavaScript code.  RESTful web services are becoming more and more common on the Internet. Many  popular web-based services expose public RESTful APIs to enable integration with  mobile apps, web-based dashboards, and other software projects. This widespread  adoption is due largely in part to the equally widespread adoption of JavaScript  Object Notation  JSON  for serializing and deserializing objects. JSON makes it  simple for any web client to interpret data from any web server without requiring  specialized or proprietary licenses or algorithms.  A RESTful web request is very simple and you use them every day, if you did not  already know it. Every time you type a URL into a web browser, you are issuing an  HTTP GET request to the server at that URL address. Likewise, most web pages that  include forms use the HTTP POST verb to post that data back to the web server to be  saved. This may also jog your memory back to some of our code samples in previous  chapters. Do you remember seeing the [HttpGet] and [HttpPost] attributes on  some of the controller action methods? These attributes indicated to ASP.NET that  only a specific type of HTTP verb  either a GET or a POST  is allowed for that action  method. This does have security implications of course, but it is actually more useful  for determining which method the server should use depending on which HTTP  verb the client sent along with the request. In other words, a controller could have  five different action methods with different HTTP verb attributes for each one, as  shown here:  [HttpGet] public ActionResult Get int objectId = 0  {   ... }  [HttpPost] public ActionResult Post Object postedObject  {   ... }  [ 242 ]   Chapter 11  [HttpPut] public ActionResult Put Object objectToPut  {   ... }  [HttpPatch] public ActionResult Patch Object objectToPatch  {   ... }  [HttpDelete] public ActionResult Delete int objectId  {   ... }  The problem with the preceding code is that it creates a separate route for each of the  different functions for the page. If this page were accessible from the route http:   mysite.com movies, we could use http:  mysite.com movies get 25 to see data  for a specific movie, but we would have to use a completely different route in order to  add a new movie or to delete a movie, such as http:  mysite.com movies put. This  may not seem like such a big problem for a website where URLs can be embedded in  forms and links without much interaction from the user, but this is a big problem for  developers trying to create a program to access the API from remote code.  The ASP.NET MVC Web API solves this problem by creating special controllers  solely for the purpose of creating RESTful services. In a standard MVC controller,  each action method creates a new route  or URL  that ultimately generates some  web content inside a view. In a Web API controller, however, each action method  specifies a single HTTP verb for the same route  or URL . In other words, a Web API  controller serves only a single HTTP endpoint; it only operates for a single route. For  an API developer, this is perfect. A single HTTP endpoint, such as http:  mysite. com api movies, can respond to all of the HTTP verbs appropriately without having  to use different URLs for each operation.  [ 243 ]   Web API Examples  Inside of the API controller, each of the HTTP verbs gets one or more action methods  for serving that specific type of request. The route to the controller defaults to the  controller's name. So a controller called MoviesController.cs would default to the  route http:  mysite.com api movies. This is as far as the route goes; the only  difference now between requests to this endpoint is in which HTTP verb the request  includes and which parameters are passed in as arguments. The following is the  default code generated by the ASP.NET Web API template for an API controller:     GET api values public IEnumerable  Get   {   return new string[] { "value1", "value2" }; }     GET api values 5 public string Get int id  {   return "value"; }     POST api values public void Post [FromBody]string value  { }     PUT api values 5 public void Put int id, [FromBody]string value  { }     DELETE api values 5 public void Delete int id  { }  Notice that the names of the action methods are the names of HTTP verbs. This is not  an accident, it is required that the action method names either match an HTTP verb  name or begin with an HTTP verb name. So an action method can either be called  Get or it could be called GetMovie. Also notice that there are two different versions  of the Get action method in this controller. Just like in a standard controller, the same  action method can be listed multiple times as long as the signature for each method  is unique. In this case, it allows us to have a standard Get method that does not  require any parameters and a more specialized Get method that returns information  for a specific record.  [ 244 ]   Chapter 11  You can visit http:  www.asp.net web-api overview web- api-routing-and-actions routing-in-aspnet-web-api for  a good overview of Web API routing rules and naming conventions.  You will also notice that these action methods do not have the HTTP verb attributes  on them. For an API controller, these attributes are not required. There is a new  attribute in the code sample, however. You can see it in front of the parameters for  the Post and Put action methods: [FromBody]. This special attribute is used to assist  the model binder in locating the parameter in the body of the HTTP request. It is not  always necessary, such as when you are binding a complex object that the model  binder can clearly see is made up of specific properties with specific names. For a  simple string value as in this code sample, however, it needs to know that you intend  to bind the HTTP request body to that input parameter. There is also an attribute   [FromUri]  to indicate that a parameter comes from the URL. Most of the time,  these parameters will be unnecessary but they are available to help solve problems  that the model binder is unable to solve on its own. It is worth some more research  if you unfamiliar with it. The basic rules that Web API uses for model binding work  like this:     Simple types are taken from the URL  URI     Complex types are taken from the request body  Simple types include all of the .NET Framework primitive types, plus DateTime,  Decimal, Guid, String, and TimeSpan. For each action method, at most one  parameter can read the request body. If you try to mark more than one parameter  with [FromBody], you will either get a runtime error or null values.  You can visit http:  blogs.msdn.com b jmstall  archive 2012 04 16 how-webapi-does-parameter- binding.aspx for more information on parameter binding with  Web API.  [ 245 ]   Web API Examples  Another important concept to understand about API controllers is that they do not  return views like standard controllers do. Rather than generating HTML markup  for a web browser to display, API controllers generate raw data that is intended  for specialized client code, such as JavaScript, to consume. The format of this data  is something that you do not have to worry about. Notice how the action methods  in the previous code sample simply return string values without using the Json    method that we have seen in some of the previous chapters. We do not need to tell  the API controller how to format its data because it will auto-negotiate the correct  format with the client during the communication process. The most common format  is JSON, but some clients may prefer XML or other data types that the ASP.NET  framework understands how to serialize.  You may be interested in knowing how this auto-negotiation works.  Here is the answer: it is based largely on the Accept header from the  client during the API call. You can even create your own content types  to extend the API framework for customized scenarios. See this page  for more information: http:  www.asp.net web-api overview  formats-and-model-binding content-negotiation.  Since API controllers are not designed to render web pages with markup, you will  need to create normal controllers for your web pages as you are used to doing. To  interact with the API controllers, it is very common to utilize JavaScript, especially  jQuery, to access the API endpoints with a specific HTTP verb to accomplish  whatever task your page is designed for.  Getting familiar with Entity Framework  Code First Most applications use a database to store information. Most databases, however,  store information in a way that does not exactly match up with server-side object  oriented programming. This is a very common problem and has given rise to the  field of Object Relational Mapping  ORM  systems. Many of these exist, but  Microsoft has created one specific to the .NET framework known as the Entity  Framework  EF . It is basically a framework designed to more easily write code that  stores information in a database but still behaves like an object oriented system. If  you have downloaded the sample content for this chapter, go ahead and open the  Chapter 11 solution now to follow along. Otherwise, create a new ASP.NET MVC 4  project and choose the Web API template when asked.  [ 246 ]   Chapter 11  The particulars of the Entity Framework are numerous and there is not enough  space here to explore them. We will go through a basic example of how to utilize the  Entity Framework Code First model so that we can show this in the examples for  this chapter. In order to use the Entity Framework, you must first install it into your  Visual Studio project through NuGet. You can do this by right-clicking the project in  the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio and choosing Manage NuGet Packages…, as  shown here:  [ 247 ]   Web API Examples  On the next screen, you should make sure that you are viewing the Online  catalogue. Type the text Entity Framework into the search box and choose Install  when it appears in the results window. Once installed, it will display a green check  mark indicating that it is ready for use:  This will install all of the necessary components of the Entity Framework into  your Visual Studio solution. We will be using a feature of the Entity Framework  known as Code First. This feature allows us to create classes, or entities, for our  data first before the database even exists. The biggest benefit from this model is  that it guarantees that the database will be designed and the data will be stored in  accordance with our object oriented architecture.  If you have not already done so, now is a good time to download the  sample content for this chapter. All of these examples and files will  already be present there, so you can follow along with working code.  [ 248 ]   For the sake of illustration, we will create our entity classes in the Models folder  inside of our Visual Studio project. Create a class called Movie.cs in the Models  folder like this:  Chapter 11  The Entity Framework will infer from the properties here that the Id property should  become the primary key inside the database. Now that we have our model, we need  to tell the Entity Framework that we want to make a database that includes it. Create  another class in the Models folder and call it MoviesContext.cs, as shown here:  public class Movie {   public int Id { get; set; }   public string Name { get; set; }   public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }   public int Rating { get; set; }   public int Rank { get; set; } }  ... using System.Data.Entity; ...  public class MoviesContext : DbContext {   public DbSet  Movies { get; set; } }  This code informs the Entity Framework that we want a DbContext context that  includes a DbSet of Movie entities. Let's go ahead and add some movies to our  database, so that we can make use of them in our examples. To get started, we need a  page where we can type in the movie data and have the web server save that data to  the database.   [ 249 ]   Web API Examples  Create a MoviesController controller with these options selected; it will  automatically scaffold action methods and views with basic operations for   managing the Movie entity that we just created.  If you cannot find your Movie entity or the MoviesContext class,  try building your project and trying again.  Now go to the Movies Index page and create some movies. The first time you run  the project, it may be very slow. The reason for this is that Entity Framework is  creating your database on-the-fly in the background from the model and the context  that you provided earlier. By the time you see the web page, the database will be  up and running. You can see how I have created a few in the following screenshot.  Create at least ten so that the examples have some data later in the chapter.  [ 250 ]   Chapter 11  Although there is a lot more to learn about the Entity Framework, this brief example  has taken you all the way from a single class to a fully working database. We will  be using this movies database in the rest of the examples for this chapter. If you are  not familiar with the Entity Framework and would like to learn more, I recommend  inspecting the MoviesController.cs class that we just created with Visual Studio  to see how it created the default actions; you can then visit www.msdn.com for the  official documentation on the topic.  Getting familiar with OData The ASP.NET Web API framework supports data queries through a syntax known as  OData. OData is a query language that is compatible with HTTP URLs so that it can  appear in URL query strings. It provides two very powerful benefits to API action  methods that are used to return lists of data. First, it automatically translates the  OData query language into an actual data query on the data inside of your API action  method. This is amazingly powerful and may be hard to believe until you can actually  see it. Basically, it is a search engine for free. Second, the OData features allow the  queries to occur on the server. This means that the server can query the data source for  the specific elements that match and then return the result back to the client. The client  does not have to query the full set of data and then filter on its own. This is a huge  performance improvement and also simplifies both client and server code.  There are four ways by which you can enable the OData query features for your   API controllers. Each providing more fine-grained control than its predecessor.     Enable query support globally through WebApiConfig.cs    Add the [Queryable] attribute to specific API action methods        Inherit from ODataController instead of ApiController Inherit from EntitySetController instead of ODataController  The first option will globally enable query support for any ApiController action  method with an IQueryable return type. To enable this, open the WebApiConfig. cs file inside of the App_Start folder and un-comment the line of code with config. EnableQuerySupport  :     Uncomment the following line of code to enable query support     for actions with an IQueryable or IQueryable  return type.    To avoid processing unexpected or malicious queries, use the     validation settings on QueryableAttribute to validate     incoming queries.    For more information, visit     http:  go.microsoft.com fwlink ?LinkId=279712. config.EnableQuerySupport  ;  [ 251 ]   Web API Examples  The second option will enable query support for specific action methods that you  decorate with the [Queryable] attribute. This gives you more configuration choices  than the previous option because the [Queryable] attribute has many properties  that you can configure to fine-tune its behavior. An action method decorated with  this attribute looks like the following:     GET api values [Queryable] public IQueryable  Get   {   return new string[] { "value1", "value2" }.AsQueryable  ; }  The third option involves inheriting your controller class from ODataController  instead of ApiController. This will enable the full OData support that the Web  API offers and also requires some more configuration to be done, so that the OData  engine understands the Entity Data Model  EDM  for the entities that it is exposing.  ODataModelBuilder modelBuilder = new ODataConventionModelBuilder  ; modelBuilder.EntitySet  "Movies" ; Microsoft.Data.Edm.IEdmModel model = modelBuilder.GetEdmModel  ; config.Routes.MapODataRoute "ODataRoute", "OData", model ;  The preceding code needs to run as the web application starts, so it should be placed  either in Global.asax or in one of the App_Start classes, such as WebApiConfig. cs. It reads the same type of entity model as the Entity Framework and loads this into  an OData route so that Web API understands how each part of the model is related,  what the primary keys are, and so on. This enables more advanced scenarios such as  property navigation. For more information on this, you can visit http:  www.asp. net web-api overview odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api getting-started- with-odata-in-web-api create-a-read-only-odata-endpoint for   an introduction.  The fourth option is similar to the previous option, but it enables more OData  functionality automatically that the ODataController class would have to do  manually. It still requires the ODataModelBuilder class as in the last option.   The URL just listed also covers information on this topic.  For our examples in this chapter, we will be using the [Queryable] attribute to  enable query support for specific action methods. I encourage you to explore this  technology more on your own, it is a powerful and extensible framework that can  provide huge productivity boosts to your code. To learn more about OData, you can  visit www.odata.org.  [ 252 ]   Chapter 11  Using DataSourceRequest with Kendo  Grid As we saw in the first chapter, the Kendo Grid widget is designed to allow a rich   set of features such as paging, filtering, and sorting. We saw previously how this   can be driven on the client side through JavaScript and the Kendo DataSource  object. The Grid widget becomes even more powerful, however, when connected  with server-side functionality to help drive its features.  The Kendo UI Framework for ASP.NET MVC includes a special object to help facilitate  this functionality within standard MVC controllers. It does not require the Web API or  OData, although you could use them if you want to configure the Kendo DataSource  by hand. In this example, we will learn how to use the DataSourceRequest object and  how it helps drive the functionality of a Kendo Grid widget.  First, add a new action method to the MoviesController class that we   created earlier.  public ActionResult MoviesGrid [DataSourceRequest]DataSourceRequest  request  {   return Json       db.Movies.ToDataSourceResult request , JsonRequestBehavior. AllowGet ; }  You should notice right away the special attribute in the signature of the action  method called [DataSourceRequest]. This attribute comes from the Kendo.Mvc. Extensions namespace, so you will need to include that in a using statement at  the top of the controller. This attribute is necessary for the Kendo UI Framework  to properly understand the communication between the Grid widget and this  server-side action method. It is also important that the [DataSourceRequest]  attribute is decorating a DataSourceRequest object and that the return  value from this action method is passed through the extension method called  ToDataSourceResult request . These special methods drive the Kendo  functionality for data binding, sorting, paging and filtering.  [ 253 ]   Web API Examples  With this code in place, add a new action method to the KendoController called  Grid, which will be the action method we use for the view.  Create a view for this method and place the following Razor code inside it:  public ActionResult Grid   {   return View  ; }  @using Kendo.Mvc.UI;  @{     ViewBag.Title = "Grid"; }  @ Html.Kendo  .Grid   .Name "moviesGrid"      .Columns columns =>         {             columns.Bound p => p.Name ;             columns.Bound p => p.ReleaseYear ;             columns.Bound p => p.Rating ;             columns.Bound p => p.Rank ;         }               .Pageable       .Sortable       .Filterable       .DataSource dataSource => dataSource         .Ajax           .PageSize 5          .Read read => read.Action "MoviesGrid", "Movies"           As you have seen before, this Html helper method from the Kendo UI Framework  generates a Grid widget on the view page. We have configured the columns and  enabled the Grid to be pageable, sortable, and filterable. The significant  part for this example is that we have set the DataSource object to point to the  MoviesGrid action of the Movies controller, which we set up earlier with the special  Kendo attribute and objects. When we run our project and navigate to this new view,  we get a Kendo Grid widget like the following, which has working paging buttons,  filter buttons, and sortable column headings:  [ 254 ]   Chapter 11  Unlike in Chapter 1, Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid,  however, this Grid widget is asking the server to calculate the sort order, the pages,  and the filtered results. It does this by sending special data instructions to the server  that are interpreted by the special Kendo attribute and objects. To see these data  instructions, you can turn on the Internet Explorer developer tools by pressing  the F12 key while the website is running. In the toolbar that appears, click on the  Network tab and then click Start Capturing. After clicking these buttons, click on  one of the Grid functions, such as the page arrow or one of the column headings.  You will see some activity in the developer toolbar, which means that the Grid is  communicating with the server through JavaScript AJAX calls. Double-click on the  first item in the list that shows the address  Movies MoviesGrid, as shown here:  Double-clicking this item will open up a detailed description of the HTTP request.  Click on the Request body tab to see what the Grid sent to the server:  [ 255 ]   Web API Examples  You can see here that the Grid has asked for page number 2 with a page size of 5  records. This is how the Kendo Grid communicates with the server, through the  HTTP request body.  Driving the ListView with Web API Similar to the Grid widget, the ListView widget is able to utilize the  [DataSourceRequest] attribute to help drive special functionality for its operations.  In this case, we will not simply be querying the data from the server, but also editing  it with the Web API.  Create an action method for our ListView example in the KendoController class,   as shown here:  private MoviesContext db = new MoviesContext  ;  Then add a view for this action method and add the following HTML markup inside:  public ActionResult ListView   {   return View db.Movies ; }  @using Kendo.Mvc.UI;  @model IEnumerable   @{     ViewBag.Title = "ListView"; }                                Name               ${Name}               Rating               ${Rating}               Rank               ${Rank}                         [ 256 ]   Chapter 11          <a class="k-button k-button-icontext k-edit-button"             href="\\">  Edit          <a class="k-button k-button-icontext k-delete-button"             href="\\">  Delete           ListView   This basic HTML and Kendo template will be used to build the page once the data  has been retrieved. You can see how the template is simply showing each element  of a Movie object and then providing the edit and delete buttons. Next, add the  following MVC Razor code at the bottom of this view to wire everything together:  @ Html.Kendo  .ListView Model      .Name "moviesListView"      .TagName "div"      .ClientTemplateId "template"      .Editable       .DataSource dataSource => {         dataSource             .Read read => read.Action "MoviesGrid", "Movies"               .Update update => update.Type HttpVerbs.Post                .Url " api MovieApi"               .PageSize 5              .Model config => config.Id "Id"  ;     }      .Pageable     Here, we have created a Kendo ListView, specified the ID of the template to use  when rendering it on the page, marked it as editable, and specified the data source.  Inside of the data source, we have indicated where to retrieve the data to display    the Read method  and where to send updated data  the Update method .  [ 257 ]   Web API Examples  Next, we need to create an editor template for the Movie object, so that this ListView  can edit our Movie objects. Make a new folder under the Views Shared folder called  EditorTemplates. Then, add a view to the EditorTemplates folder and call it  Movie.cshtml.  Open the Movie.cshtml view file and add the following code there:  @model Chapter11.Models.Movie                   Name           @Html.EditorFor model => model.Name            Rating           @Html.EditorFor model => model.Rating            Rank           @Html.EditorFor model => model.Rank                       <a class="k-button k-button-icontext k-update-button"             href="\\">  Save          <a class="k-button k-button-icontext k-cancel-button"             href="\\">  Cancel           This view will be used by the ListView widget when the Edit button is clicked on  a Movie item. The following is how the page looks by default  when viewing the  movies . You can see the different elements of a move item and the buttons used to  edit or delete it:  [ 258 ]   Chapter 11  This is how a movie item is rendered when you click on the Edit button. See how the  fields are now rendered as we specified in the EditorTemplate folder for the Movie  data type.  Since we have wired this up to the Web API, we can observe the changes being   sent to the server for processing if we set a breakpoint in Visual Studio inside   the API method that is being called. You can see that I have done this in the  following screenshot:  [ 259 ]   Web API Examples  With Visual Studio set this way, the program will stop when an update is made and  you can inspect the data to observe what is happening. For a production application,  you would want to use the Entity Framework to edit the movie object and save the  changes to the database.  Summary In this chapter, we have seen how to use the Web API for some more realistic  scenarios involving two of the Kendo widgets that deal with managing data. We also  quickly explored the ASP.NET Web API fundamentals as well as Entity Framework  and OData. These tools, used together, can be a very powerful set and can create  nearly any custom solution that you need.  The examples we just saw, both use a special attribute that Telerik has provided  to help with model binding and server-side paging and filtering. It is nice to make  use of special helpers like this when they are available. I encourage you to continue  to explore these technologies on your own and see how you can create your own  custom solutions on your own web pages.
